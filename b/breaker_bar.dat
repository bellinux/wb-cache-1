40|$|In {{the scope}} of NOURTEC, an EEC project, efforts are made to {{simulate}} the behaviour of executed foreshore supplies {{with the aid of}} mathematical computer models. One of the models used are line models. On behalf of the DUT two studies contribute to NOURTEC line modelling. One concentrates on the longshore transport, and the present study focuses on cross-shore sediment transport. Both studies try to improve the applicability of line models in evaluating and forecasting the behaviour of the coast, specially after a nourishment. The cross-shore profiles supplied and evaluated in {{the scope of}} NOURTEC, and many other cross-shore profiles as well, are characterised by one or more <b>breaker</b> <b>bars.</b> Foreshore supplies very often have the same length scales as these <b>breaker</b> <b>bars.</b> At the Terschelling coast, for instance, a nourishment was executed by filling the trough between the outer two bars. This illustrates that, studying cross-shore morphology after a supply, one should include the phenomenon of <b>breaker</b> <b>bars</b> in the study as well. This report contains a study about both <b>breaker</b> <b>bars</b> and supplies. Concentrating on the cross-shore profile, in this study <b>breaker</b> <b>bars</b> and supplies are interpreted as harmonic or instantaneous disturbances of an equilibrium profile respectively. An equilibrium profile is a profile shape {{for which there is no}} sediment transport. The essence of line modelling is that a cross-shore profile, for given wave and sediment parameters, tends towards an equilibrium shape. Using this concept, <b>breaker</b> <b>bars</b> can be schematised by a harmonic boundary condition and supplies by an initial surplus of sediment in the equilibrium profile. In this study, the equilibrium profile shape and the consequences of a disturbance are described by two expressions. One is the well known continuity equation, and the other is a sediment transport equation. The latter describes the magnitude and the direction of sediment transports as a function of the profile height and the profile slope. Transports due to wave asymmetry, undertow and the gravity force are included in this expression. In case the profile height and the profile slope meet the equilibrium profile shape for a certain location in the profile, the sediment transport equals zero. Thus it follows that, in case of a disturbance of the equilibrium profile slope, these two expressions describe a diffusion process. In this report, the diffusion process is analyzed both analytically and numerically. The analytical part merely concentrates on the derivation of scale rules, not on the accuracy of the outcome. A scale parameter was defined for the diffusion process due to the gravity force. A more extended analysis including wave asymmetry and undertow as well did not lead to significant different results. The analytical part is concluded with a proposal for further study. In the numerical part a computer program is developed based on the sediment transport equation and the continuity equation. As could be expected from the analytical results, no spontaneous increase of any disturbance was found. It appears that <b>breaker</b> <b>bars</b> can only be generated at the upper boundary of the profile. In that case propagation in seawards direction is found, together with a strong dissipation in the upper part of the profile. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

40|$|<b>Breaker</b> <b>bars</b> in {{the surf}} zone of sandy beaches {{generally}} evolve between straight bars parallel to the shore and meandering crescentic bars associated with intense (dangerous) currents flowing seaward through rip channels. Understanding the behavior of such systems is fundamental as they control the entire surf zone dynamics, {{the shape of the}} coastline, and the exchange of floating material with the shoreface. Although the mechanisms behind the meandering of an originally straight bar have been studied extensively, a clear physical explanation on the crescentic bar straightening was missing. Recent field observations have highlighted that this morphological reset can be due to wave obliquity. By using a two-dimensional horizontal morphological model, we show that the bar straightening by oblique waves occurs because the rip current is both weakened in intensity and shifted downdrift from the channel deepest section.

50|$|The most {{prevalent}} form is the ratcheting socket wrench, often improperly called a ratchet. A ratcheting socket wrench is the device within a hand tool {{in which a}} metal handle {{is attached to a}} ratcheting mechanism, which attaches to a socket, which in turn fits onto a type of bolt or nut. Pulled or pushed in one direction, the ratchet loosens or tightens the bolt or nut attached to the socket. Turned the other direction, the ratchet does not turn the socket but allows the ratchet handle to be re-positioned for another turn while staying attached to the bolt or nut. This ratcheting action allows the fastener to be rapidly tightened or loosened in small increments without disconnecting the tool from the fastener. A switch is built into the ratchet head that allows the user to apply the ratcheting action in either direction, as needed, to tighten or loosen a fastener. Other common methods of driving socket wrenches include pneumatic impact wrenches, hydraulic torque wrenches, torque multipliers and <b>breaker</b> <b>bars.</b> Some lesser known hybrid drivers include striking wrench tools with square drive, and hydraulic impact wrenches (typically powered by on site hydraulic power such as present with military tanks, and many rail car applications).|$|R

Interruptions in accretion produced burrowed, ferruginous horizons. When building ceased, the ooid bars were deeply penetrated by large vertical burrowers. Commonly an ooid bar was succeeded by or graded laterally into a thin, ferruginous phosphatic intraclast lag deposit that developed when relatively higher coastal energy of storms or renewed transgression winnowed the sediment-starved mudflats.

40|$|In 1993 an {{artificial}} sand nourishment {{was carried out}} at the coast of Terschelling. The total amount of supply was deposited in a trough between two <b>breaker</b> <b>bars,</b> up {{to a level of}} about NAP - 5 m. The present report gives a prediction of the development of the coast in the next 10 years. For this, a mathematical model has been used, in which the coast is characterized by 3 lines, roughly representing the beach, the inshore and the area between NAP- 6 m and NAP- 9 m. The model simulates the diffusion of the supply in longshore and cross-shore direction. Two extremes cases are considered: 1. cross shore diffusion without longshore diffusion 2. cross shore diffusion with longshore diffusion The diffusitivity is determined by the wave climate and by a sand transport formula (the Svasek variation of the CERC formula, (Bijker & Svasek, 1969)). As the effect of the curvature of the inshore on the curvature of the beach is not included in this case, the diffusitivity of sand along the beach will be rather overestimated. Starting from the assumptions, given in section 2. 2, the computations give the result that the present erosion of the beach, estimated as 2. 75 m/year, will be compensated for 13 years in case 1 and for 7 years in case 2. The values of the longshore diffusitivity constants have apparently a rather high influence on the results of the computations. The effect on the beach of the supply between NAP- 9 m and NAP- 6 m is found to be approximately one third of the result with the supply at the inshore (between NAP- 6 m and NAP- 3 m). The recommendation is therefore to carry out the supply as high as economically attractive. MASTII-CT 93 - 0049 Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{fundamental}} properties of a coastline is its sediment composition. Coastal sediments are rarely composed of one type of sediment. Due to these differences, the sediments are sorted {{on the beach and}} foreshore. The effect of density variations of the sediment on coastal sediment transport has been studied in a wave flume experiment. Two sands with an equal grain size distribution but with different densities (heavy minerals and quartz) have been used. Detailed measurements of profile evolution and of sediment composition have been used. to assess the sediment transport rates for each sediment fraction. The experiments show that the presence of heavy minerals in the sediment results in reduced erosion on the beach face; the <b>breaker</b> <b>bar</b> is smaller and its crest is more pronounced. The transport rates of different sediment fractions are not only determined by the availability at the bed. In the inner surf zone close to the beach, armouring occurs; in the inner surf zone close to the <b>breaker</b> <b>bar,</b> sediments are entrained more easily than expected. For effective armouring, the heavy mineral fraction in the bed should exceed a certain level. This threshold concentration is reached first close to the beach and extends later in seaward direction.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{was to develop a}} mechanical pulping process capable of producing good-quality pulp, while consuming less electrical energy. The study focused on applying of grits to TMP refining to enhance the breaking of the fiber cell wall promoting faster development of pulp fibers to the desired quality for papermaking. The study comprises tests at laboratory scale and development of an application for industrial, including trials at pilot scale. A preliminary trial with the grit application in TMP refining was conducted at laboratory scale. The results showed that the grits should be introduced {{between the first and second}} stages in TMP refining. The grit treatment on the TMP fibers caused disruption of the wall structure, opening of the outer layers and peeling-off of the cell wall. The efficient disruption with minimal shortening and weakening of fibers was found to be operated at a low-intensity and high-frequency of treatment. According to an experiment with first-stage TMP pulp, the disrupted pulp developed faster during subsequent refining, while the energy consumption was reduced by up to 30 % without a significant loss of pulp quality. With the aim of developing an industrial application, the refiner segments were modified by applying grits on the refiner segment surfaces. The grits were made from self-fluxing tungsten-carbide powder and a Ni-base alloy powder, which were laser-clad onto the surface of <b>breaker</b> <b>bars,</b> the inner part of a segment. Trials with grit segments were carried out on a pilot refiner. The grit segments were applied in first-stage TMP refining, followed by treatment with base segments operated under normal mill conditions.

A refiner equipped with grit segments, operated at a speed of 2400 rpm, produced pulp with a higher level of disruption of fiber cell walls than a refiner equipped with the reference segments.

40|$|A {{large-scale}} wave flume experiment {{has been}} carried out involving a T[*]=[*] 4 s regular wave with H[*]=[*] 0. 85 m wave height plunging over a fixed barred beach profile. Velocity profiles were measured at 12 locations along the <b>breaker</b> <b>bar</b> using LDA and ADV. A strong undertow is generated reaching magnitudes of 0. 8 m/s on the shoreward side of the <b>breaker</b> <b>bar.</b> A circulation pattern occurs between the breaking area and the inner surf zone. Time-averaged turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) is largest in the breaking area on the shoreward side of the bar where the plunging jet penetrates the water column. At this location, and on the bar crest, TKE generated at the water surface in the breaking process reaches the bottom boundary layer. In the breaking area, TKE does not reduce to zero within a wave cycle which leads to a high level of “residual” turbulence and therefore lower temporal variation in TKE compared to previous studies of breaking waves on plane beach slopes. It is argued that this residual turbulence results from the breaker bar-trough geometry, which enables larger length scales and time scales of breaking-generated vortices and which enhances turbulence production within the water column compared to plane beaches. Transport of TKE is dominated by the undertow-related flux, whereas the wave-related and turbulent fluxes are approximately an order of magnitude smaller. Turbulence production and dissipation are largest in the breaker zone and of similar magnitude, but in the shoaling zone and inner surf zone production is negligible and dissipation dominates...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDetailed {{measurements}} are presented of velocities and turbulence under a large-scale regular plunging breaking wave {{in a wave}} flume. Measurements were obtained at 12 cross-shore locations around a mobile medium-sand <b>breaker</b> <b>bar.</b> They focused particularly on {{the dynamics of the}} wave bottom boundary layer (WBL) and near-bed turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), measured with an Acoustic Concentration and Velocity Profiler (ACVP). The breaking process and outer flow hydrodynamics are in agreement with previous laboratory and field observations of plunging waves, including a strong undertow in the bar trough region. The WBL thickness matches with previous studies at locations offshore from the bar crest, but it increases near the breaking-wave plunge point. This relates possibly to breaking-induced TKE or to the diverging flow at the shoreward slope of the bar. Outer flow TKE is dominated by wave breaking and exhibits strong spatial variation with largest TKE above the <b>breaker</b> <b>bar</b> crest. Below the plunge point, breakinginduced turbulence invades the WBL during both crest and trough half cycle. This results in an increase in the time-averaged TKE in the WBL (with a factor 3) and an increase in peak onshore and offshore near-bed Reynolds stresses (with a factor 2) from shoaling to breaking region. A fraction of locally produced TKE is advected offshore over a distance of a few meters to shoaling locations during the wave trough phase, and travels back onshore during the crest half cycle. The results imply that breaking-induced turbulence, for large-scale conditions, may significantly affect near-bed sediment transport processes...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} novel {{insights into}} suspended sediment concentrations and fluxes under a large-scale laboratory plunging wave. Measurements of sediment concentrations and velocities were taken at 12 locations around an evolving <b>breaker</b> <b>bar,</b> covering the complete breaking region from shoaling to inner surf zone, with particular high resolution near the bed using an Acoustic Concentration and Velocity Profiler. Wave breaking evidently affects sediment pick-up rates, which increase by {{an order of}} magnitude from shoaling to breaking zone. Time-averaged reference concentrations correlate poorly with periodic and time-averaged near-bed velocities, but correlate significantly with near-bed time-averaged turbulent kinetic energy. The net depth-integrated suspended transport is offshore-directed and primarily attributed to current-related fluxes (undertow) at outer-flow elevations (i. e. above the wave bottom boundary layer). The wave-related suspended transport is onshore-directed and is generally confined to the wave bottom boundary layer. Cross-shore gradients of sediment fluxes are quantified to explain spatial patterns of sediment pick-up and deposition and of cross-shore sediment advection. Suspended particles travel {{back and forth between the}} breaking and shoaling zones following the orbital motion, leading to local intra-wave concentration changes. At locations between the <b>breaker</b> <b>bar</b> crest and bar trough, intra-wave concentration changes are due to a combination of horizontal advection and of vertical exchange with the bedload layer: sediment is entrained in the bar trough during the wave trough phase, almost instantly advected offshore, and deposited near the bar crest during the wave crest phase. Finally, these results are used to suggest improvements for suspended sediment transport models...|$|E

This data set is useful for analysis of hydrodynamic and morphodynamic processes present in the Egmond (double <b>breaker</b> <b>bar)</b> system. Extensive calibration and validation of numerical models as not only a dense spatial coverage of the modelled area is available, but also detailed measurements of boundary conditions, such as the wind field and deep water wave height. Analysis of the relative wave height in the breaker region, shows a marked influence of the deep-water wave steepness on the maximum value of the relative wave height. Initially, the Battjes&Stive (1985) relationship for wave breaker parameter was applied by the UNIBEST-TC profile model. Based on the trend of the variation of the maximum relative wave height {{as a function of the}} deep-water wave steepness, found in the data analysis, the wave breaking simulation could be improved. In general, the model results give a good approximation of longshore currents. Comparison of the cross-shore velocities of the model and measurements is more difficult. Longshore current instabilities are measured in the Egmond field site during the campaign. The relative small cross-shore velocities are influenced significantly by this meandering nearshore velocity. An averaged profile is used, representing the entire area of interest. In general, the modelled movement of the bars is in reasonable correspondence with the measurements. However, significant differences in the measured and computed movement of the bars can be observed. During high wave conditions the offshore movement is over-estimated.

40|$|Novel {{series of}} {{experiments}} are presented that demonstrate morphological hysteresis in the evolution to equilibrium of beach profiles under sequences of different wave climates. The experiments were conducted in a wave flume at medium scale using both monochromatic and random waves, representing 2 D conditions. Beach profiles were obtained with high spatial resolution at frequent intervals with a laser profiler, from which shoreline location, bar position and sediment transport rates were derived. Experiments were conducted for sequences of wave climates, where a sequence comprised of 6 - 13 sequential tests, each commencing with the beach profile from the preceding test. Each test was run until equilibrium conditions were obtained and had a constant wave height, increased or decreased relative to the preceding test. Cyclical conditions were also included, with erosive and accretive wave conditions of short durations alternating through multiple cycles, so that equilibrium conditions were not reached during a test. With a sequence of increasing wave heights, {{the relationship between the}} shoreline position and the bulk cross-shore sediment transport, at equilibrium, was non-monotonic, indicating a maximum in the landward sediment transport rate. For test series comprised of a sequence of increasing wave heights followed by a sequence of decreasing wave heights, morphological hysteresis was observed in the equilibrium shoreline position and bulk cross-shore sediment transport, such that shoreline recession, or offshore transport, continued in some instances after reductions in wave height. This is inconsistent with classical equilibritim type shoreline evolution models. However, when equilibrium conditions were not reached, in the cyclic sequences, no such morphological hysteresis was observed and a dynamic equilibrium is reached. The morphological hysteresis occurs because of the decay, stranding, or increased relative depth, of the <b>breaker</b> <b>bar</b> following a reduction in wave height, often in conjunction with a new <b>breaker</b> <b>bar</b> generated by further offshore transport in the inner surf zone. Similar sequences of morphological response are evident in field data and larger scale tests in the literature. Finally, it is shown that the morphological hysteresis can be explained using the classical equilibrium beach state model of Wright et al. (1985) by introducing the concept of a subsequent alternate active beach state, which may occur following a change in wave conditions...|$|E

This sport increased until the long stretch of water, which had been as calm as St. Regis Lake at twilight, resembled the quick current of a Canadian stream. It was a fascinating, wonderful sight. But it was also peculiarly exasperating, because when the fish roll in this sportive, lazy way they will not bite. For an hour I trolled through this whirlpool of flying spray and twisting tarpon, with many a salty drop on my face, hearing all around me the whipping crash of breaking water.|$|R

Before the boat could reach her she was among the <b>breakers</b> on the <b>bar,</b> which were so terrible at that part of the coast as to render landing in a small boat quite out of the question. In a few minutes the dhow was hurled on the beach and began to break up, while her crew and cargo of slaves swarmed into the sea and tried to gain the shore. It seemed to those in the boat that some hundreds of negroes were struggling at one time in the seething foam.|$|R

The site of the Lido of Sete is currently evaluating these techniques and thus provided an exceptional laboratory to analyze coastal behavior associated with soft defenses. An Argus video monitoring system was deployed in 2011 to survey this area. The monitoring before, {{during and after the}} management works permitted to describe the natural evolution of the beach and nearshore area, and the morphological response following the deployment of a submerged geotextile wave <b>breaker.</b> The <b>bar</b> system, characterized by well-developed crescentic patterns was linearized and progressively rotated to become parallel to the geotextile. Consequently, the beach began the same rotation, inducing a shoreline advance of 15 m. After this period of adaptation, the system of bar/shoreline remained quite stable, and morphological response to storm events significantly decreased as it was observed during the storm of November 2014. These results indicate a quite efficient response of the site to the deployment of the geotextile. Additional surveys of the wave breaker state are currently undertaken by the local authority to obtain a full {{feedback on}} the resistance and durability of this kind of protection against coastal erosion...|$|R
