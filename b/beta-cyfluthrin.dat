Given the short larval and adult lifecycle, delayed planting of sunflower crops is effective in preventing yield reductions caused by sunflower beetle.

ABSTRACT: If insecticides are not possible to exclude {{in the management of}} some pests, it is relevant that the resposable of an IPM program could known the effects of those products on natural enemies of primary pests of its crop. The objective of the present research was to assess the residual effects, and the lethal and sublethal toxicity of <b>beta-cyfluthrin,</b> bifenazate, clorantraniliprol, flonicamid, spirotetramat and thiametoxam on Catolaccus hunteri, an ectoparasitoid of the pepper weevil. For all experiments the residual contact method was used. We used leaf disks of pepper plants as the surface for exposition. Significant differences were found on lethal toxicity, according to the IOBC thiametoxam was moderately harmful (98 % of mortality, category 3) and <b>beta-cyfluthrin</b> was harmful (100 % of mortality, category 4) on C. hunteri. On the other hand, bifenazate, clorantraniliprol, flonicamid and spirotetramat were harmless (0 % of mortality). <b>Beta-cyfluthrin</b> and thiametoxam showed long residual effects, in both cases it was more than 34 days. Aditionally, <b>beta-cyfluthrin</b> was more residual than thiametoxam for 12 o 18 days. Talking about the sublethal effects the fecundity and the number of larvae eliminated, because of host feeding, were not different from the control. Longevity of C. hunteri disminished because of exposition to bifenazate, clorantraniloprol, spirotetramat and thiametoxam and it was shorter than the control. We only found sublethal effects on a flying test with <b>beta-cyfluthrin,</b> 28 % of females did not fly on the 30 min observation after exposition to that product. We discussed the relevance of those differences and indicated the importance of conducting assays with the same product under different aplication methods...|$|E

30|$|<b>Beta-cyfluthrin</b> (and the racemic mixture, cyfluthrin) is a {{synthetic}} pyrethroid insecticide. Cyfluthrin {{is a mixture}} of four isomers (two cis and two trans) while <b>beta-cyfluthrin</b> only contains the two active isomers (one cis and one trans) [13]. Since the two isomers that are left out are not active, we assume that the ecotoxicological effect of <b>beta-cyfluthrin</b> and cyfluthrin is the same. This group of chemicals has a neurological mode of action in insects (e.g. [14]). The effects of cyfluthrin on rainbow trout were evaluated in 1985 in an early life stage (ELS) study using constant exposure, conducted for regulatory purposes (Bayer AG, unpublished; hereafter referred to as ‘Experiment 1 ’). In this study, substantial mortality was observed in mean measured (mm) concentrations of 31.8 ng/L and higher, and significant effects on growth were observed in concentrations of 17.7 ng/L (mm) and higher. In later publications it has been concluded that pyrethroids in general tend to be neurotoxic to fish [15] and that they have been found to induce locomotory abnormalities in rainbow trout [16]. Using the adverse-outcome pathway (AOP) concept, Groh et al. [17] highlighted that locomotion impairment by pyrethroids results in reduction in food intake and consequential reduced growth. Nevertheless, feeding behaviour of fish—as an assessed parameter—had not yet been monitored in a <b>beta-cyfluthrin</b> or cyfluthrin study.|$|E
40|$|The insecticidal {{effect of}} Temprid, a {{formulation}} that contains <b>beta-cyfluthrin</b> and imidacloprid, was tested on concrete {{for control of}} seven stored-product insect species: the rusty grain beetle, Cryptolestes ferrugineus (Stephens); the sawtoothed grain beetle, Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L.); the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst); the confused flour beetle, T. confusum Jacquelin du Val; the hide beetle, Dermestes maculatus (DeGeer); and the psocids Liposcelis bostrychophila Badonnel and L. paeta Pearman. Temprid, which contains 10. 5 % <b>beta-cyfluthrin</b> and 21 % imidacloprid, was tested {{at the rate of}} 17. 2 ml of formulation/ 4. 1 liters of water/ 100 m(2). Adults were exposed for 4, 8, 14, and 24 h, and then daily for 7 d, on untreated dishes or dishes treated with Temprid. In the untreated dishes, mortality of C. ferrugineus and O. surinamensis was lower when food was present, but food did not affect mortality of the other species. Presence of food did not affect mortality of any of the species tested in the treated dishes. C. ferrugineus, O. surinamensis, and the two psocid species were very susceptible to Temprid, with mortality of 97 - 100 % after 7 d of exposure. In contrast, D. maculatus, T. castaneum, and T. confusum were tolerant to Temprid, as mortality did not exceed 57, 25, and 17 %, respectively, at the 7 -d exposure. A separate series of similar bioassays with Tempo, a formulation that contains 11. 8 % <b>beta-cyfluthrin</b> alone, which was applied at the same dose rate as Temprid, was conducted using O. surinamensis and T. castaneum as the target insect species, and results showed that Tempo was at least as effective as Temprid.

40|$|The {{susceptibility}} of six Australian {{broiler house}} populations and an insecticide susceptible population of lesser mealworm, Alphitobius diaperinus (Panzer) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), to cyfluthrin, <b>beta-cyfluthrin,</b> gamma-cyhalothrin, and deltamethrin was investigated. One broiler house population had equivalent susceptibility to the susceptible to <b>beta-cyfluthrin</b> and gamma-cyhalothrin, with higher susceptibility to cyfluthrin and deltamethrin. The remaining five populations demonstrated strong resistance to cyfluthrin (19 - 37 -fold), the insecticide used most widely for management of A. diaperinus in Australia. Each cyfluthrin-resistant population demonstrated reduced susceptibility to <b>beta-cyfluthrin</b> (resistance ratios were 8 - 17 -fold), deltamethrin (2. 5 - 8 -fold), and gamma-cyhalothrin (6 - 12 -fold) {{compared with the}} laboratory population, but cross-resistance patterns varied considerably between populations. Adding piperonyl butoxide (PBO) {{had no effect on}} the susceptibility of the susceptible population to any of the insecticides, but it increased the susceptibility of each of the five cyfluthrin-resistant populations: to cyfluthrin (synergism ratio range, 1. 9 - 5. 0 -fold), <b>beta-cyfluthrin</b> (1. 6 - 4. 1 -fold), and gamma-cyhalothrin (1. 7 - 2. 0 -fold). PBO had a more variable effect on susceptibility to deltamethrin, with three of the cyfluthrin-resistant populations being more susceptible to deltamethrin in the presence of PBO, but susceptibility of the remaining two populations was unaffected by adding PBO (synergism ratio range, 0. 9 - 2. 5 -fold). Overall, the addition of PBO to the four pyrethroids had variable effects on their susceptibility. This variability indicated the presence of other resistance mechanisms in beetle populations apart from metabolic resistance. In addition, the relative importance of metabolic resistance in each beetle population varied widely between pyrethroids. Thus, it cannot be assumed that PBO will reliably synergize pyrethroids against cyfluthrin-resistant lesser mealworm populations when using it to mitigate insecticide resistance...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate the efficacy of <b>beta-cyfluthrin</b> (Responsar 12. 5 % SC), against a standard susceptible strain of German cockroach, Blattella germanica, using three different dosages, at three different exposure times, on two types of surface, parlous (mosaic) and non parous (glassed ceramic of tiles). Comparison of the resifts indicated that <b>beta-cyfluthrin</b> at 12. 5 a. i. mg/m 2, has negligent residual activity on both mosaic and glazed ceramic tiles from one to two weeks. However at 25 a. i. mg/m 2 (highest dosage), had the longest residual activity on mosaic, it was active for six, seven and nine weeks, while on glazed ceramic tiles the residual activity increased slightly to seven and nine and nine weeks, when the nymphac were exposed for 10, 15 and 20 min, respectively. These results of the bio-assay test indicate that 12. 5 a. i. mg/m 2 is too low for any residual spraying. Application of <b>beta-cyfluthrin</b> at a target dosage rate of 25 and 37. 5 a. i. mg/m 2 showed longer residual deposit effect than the earlier dosage.

30|$|Available {{literature}} and regulatory {{studies show that}} the severity of effects of <b>beta-cyfluthrin</b> (a synthetic pyrethroid) on fish is influenced by the magnitude and duration of exposure. To investigate how the exposure pattern to <b>beta-cyfluthrin</b> (constant vs peak) may influence the response of the fish, we used a mechanistic effect model to predict the survival and growth of the rainbow trout over its early life stages (i.e. egg, alevin and swim-up fry). We parameterized a toxicokinetic–toxicodynamic (TKTD) module in combination with a dynamic energy budget model enabling us to describe uptake and elimination, as well as to predict the threshold concentration for survival and sublethal effects (feeding behaviour and growth). This effect model was calibrated using data from an early life stage experiment where trout was exposed to a constant concentration of cyfluthrin. The model was validated by comparing model predictions to independent data from a pulsed-exposure study with early life stages of rainbow trout.|$|E

30|$|The DEB model (with TKTD module) {{presented}} here was calibrated using a study where rainbow trout early life stages were constantly exposed to cyfluthrin (Experiment 1), and {{then used to}} predict effects where the early life stages were exposed to pulses of <b>beta-cyfluthrin</b> (the realistic worst case exposure profile based on the PECs, realized in Experiment 2). For some of the concentrations, the effects are overestimated, while for others the effects are underestimated during the calibration. We attribute this discrepancy to the biological variability of the test system. Even though model calibration to the data did not match our performance criteria for high test concentrations, performance was good during validation testing: the model predicted no effects for the experimental conditions tested in Experiment 2, which was {{in agreement with the}} observations. This is because the lower peak concentrations that were tested in the pulsed-exposure experiment (32, 48, 72 ng beta-cyfluthrin/L) were in same order of magnitude as the NOEC of the constant-exposure study (10 ng cyfluthrin/L). At such levels, the model performed well during calibration. The tested scenario was the worst case scenario, which is why higher peaks (for which the model could not be validated) are not expected to occur. Therefore, we conclude that the model can adequately predict independent data on the outcome for exposed eggs, alevins and swim-up fry, from both the qualitative (response pattern) and quantitative points of view under realistic exposure scenarios for <b>beta-cyfluthrin.</b>|$|E

30|$|When {{including}} toxicant {{effects in}} a DEB model, five modes of actions are commonly tested: effects on assimilation/feeding, effects on maintenance, effects on growth and maturation, and effects on costs for making eggs/direct hazard to offspring [8]. Based on {{the conclusions of}} Groh et al. [17] and the observations of Experiment 2, we chose ‘decrease of feeding’ as the mode of action during calibration. The same scaled internal concentration was used for both lethal and sublethal effects. However, different thresholds were needed to capture the delayed onset of lethal effects. As mentioned previously, {{we assume that the}} ecotoxicological effect of <b>beta-cyfluthrin</b> and cyfluthrin is the same. Thus, we do not apply a correction factor when extrapolating the effects from one to the other.|$|E
30|$|One {{hypothesis}} that {{could explain the}} observed pattern lies in the developmental process of the gills in the early life stages of the rainbow trout. The developing trout transition from full cutaneous respiration in the egg to full gill respiration as swim-up larvae (see, e.g. [23]). After hatching, respiration first takes place via {{the surface of the}} yolk sac, while the gills continue to develop. At feeding, gill development is completed, and respiration takes place fully through the gills. We hypothesize that only at the start of feeding, the uptake rate of the (<b>beta-)cyfluthrin</b> is fast enough to lead to effects. As a simplification, we thus assume that the uptake of the compound only starts when the fish have started to feed (as can be seen in Fig. 3).|$|E
30|$|In the model, {{effects on}} {{biological}} endpoints {{were linked to}} the scaled internal concentration, which is presented in Fig. 3. For the simulation of Experiment 2, the predicted scaled internal concentration of <b>beta-cyfluthrin</b> remained below the no-effect concentration for survival (red line) for all cohorts, which is why no compound-induced mortality was predicted by the model. For modelled ‘effects on feeding’, the highest scaled internal peak concentrations were greater than the threshold for effects (blue line; almost zero) in Cohort A and Cohort B, which led to predictions of a slight effect on growth. In reality, in Experiment 2, there were no effects on feeding behaviour or growth at all concentrations for Cohort B and at 32 ng/L for Cohort A. We hypothesize that due to the short duration of the (experienced) exposure and fast internal metabolism, the compound did not induce effects on feeding behaviour and growth in these cases.|$|E
30|$|The {{results of}} the {{experiments}} and the modelling {{suggest that there is}} no significant effect of (<b>beta-)cyfluthrin</b> on eggs or alevins up to concentrations of 400 ng/L at constant exposure and 450 ng/L in a two-peak-exposure scenario. This may seem somewhat surprising, since most type I and type II pyrethroids have been found to cause mortality and developmental deformities in zebrafish embryos [20, 21]. It has even been suggested that by default, a potent insecticide exhibits high toxicity to fish [20]. On the other hand, high concentrations of fenvalerate (another type II pyrethroid) have previously shown to lead to delayed hatching in zebrafish eggs, but the larvae that hatched were not found to differ from the control [22]. This supports the finding of our study, which suggests that the eggs and alevins are not affected by the compound, and that they only experience the effects of the exposure after swim-up.|$|E

The special structural behavior makes the material have good capability to seizure and capture template molecules which enhanced the MISF’s recognition efficiency and the property of separation and enrichment. The material was environmental friendly and easy to operate. The binding characteristic of the imprinted film to the three pesticides was evaluated by equilibrium binding experiments. The SEM of the three MISF has been performed to characterize the morphology of MISF. The MISFs were combined with chemiluminescence (CL) technology by modifying the sol-gel into 96 micro-well plate to establish one molecular imprinting-chemiluminescence (MI-CL) sensor which realized high selectivity, sensitivity and high throughput simultaneous assay of three pesticides. The proposed method was successfully applied to the simultaneous determination of multi-component pesticide residue in foodstuff...|$|E
40|$|Three {{insecticide}} mixtures {{that contain}} two classes of insecticides (pyrethroid and neonicotinoid) were recently developed to control bed bugs. We evaluated three integrated bed bug management strategies in apartments, each using the same non-chemical control methods {{and one of the}} three insecticide mixture products: Tandem (lambda-cyhalothrin + thiamethoxam), Temprid SC (<b>beta-cyfluthrin</b> + imidacloprid), and Transport Mikron (bifenthrin + acetamiprid). No insecticides were applied in the Control apartments. In all apartments, we installed vinyl mattress encasements (if not already present) and applied steam to beds and other infested upholstered furniture. Insecticide sprays were applied in the three treatments. Each treatment and the Control included 8 – 10 occupied apartments. Re-treatment was conducted during biweekly inspections if necessary. After eight weeks, the mean (± SEM) bed bug count reduction in the Tandem, Temprid SC, Transport Mikron, and Control was 89 ± 9, 87 ± 6, 98 ± 1, and 23 ± 54 %, respectively. Only Tandem and Transport Mikron treatments resulted in significantly higher population reduction than the Control at eight weeks. There {{were no significant differences in}} mean percent reduction among the three treatments (Tandem, Temprid SC, Transport Mikron) at eight weeks. Tandem spray caused significantly faster bed bug reduction than Temprid SC spray and Transport Mikron spray...|$|E
40|$|Bed bugs (Cimex lectularius L. and Cimex hemipterus F.) {{are among}} the most {{difficult}} urban pests to manage. Many essential oil-based bed bug control products that are considered reduced risk to mammals compared to synthetic insect neurotoxins have become commercially available, but their effectiveness as a stand-alone control method is unknown. This study assessed the field efficacy of an essential oil-based bed bug control product (EcoRaider; a. i. 1 % geraniol + 1 % cedar oil + 2 % sodium lauryl sulfate) compared to a pyrethroid and neonicotinoid mixture spray (0. 075 % Temprid SC; a. i. <b>beta-cyfluthrin</b> + imidacloprid). After 12 weeks, the three treatments—EcoRaider, Temprid SC, and EcoRaider + Temprid SC caused 92. 5 ± 2. 7, 92. 9 ± 3. 0, and 91. 7 % ± 2. 7 % bed bug count reduction, respectively. No significant differences existed in the bed bug reduction among the treatments. Bed bugs were eliminated from only 22 % of the treated apartments. Among those still with bed bugs, 76 % of the residents did not know bed bugs were present. We documented the residents’ self-control practices and discussed the potential of using essential oil-based insecticides in bed bug management programs to minimize the health risks to building occupants and pets and to slow down the development of insecticide resistance...|$|E
40|$|An {{approach}} to the synthesis of hydroxyl-terminated polymethylphenylsiloxane (PMPS-OH) was proposed and the synthesized PMPS-OH was successfully applied as a precursor to prepare a novel coating for solid-phase microextraction (SPME) via the sol-gel process. The thickness and length of the prepared coating was 70 mu m and 1. 5 cm, respectively. The extraction efficiency of the PMPS-coated fiber for selected pesticides was {{higher than that of}} commercial fibers including 100 mu m polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), 85 mu m polyacrylate (PA) and 65 mu m polydimethylsiloxane/divinylbenzene (PDMS/DVB). The influence of the extraction process, extraction temperature, extraction time, stirring rate, ionic strength, GC inlet conditions, desorption temperature and time for PMPS-coated fiber application was studied and optimized. Several experiments were carried out to evaluate the analytical characteristics of the proposed SPME-GC-ECD method under optimized conditions. The linearity was from 0. 5 to 100 ng g(- 1) for p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDD and bifenthrin, and from 2 to 100 ng g(- 1) for o,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDT, fenpropathrin, <b>beta-cyfluthrin</b> and cyhalothrin. The detection limits of these pesticides were between 0. 13 and 1. 45 ng g(- 1). The recovery of the pesticides spiked in various vegetables at 4 ng g(- 1) ranged from 42. 9 % to 105. 3 %, and the relative standard deviations were less than 16. 2 %. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V.

30|$|In 2016, an ELS {{study with}} <b>beta-cyfluthrin</b> using a {{realistic}} worst case time-variable (peak) exposure profile was conducted for regulatory purposes (ADAMA, unpublished; hereafter {{referred to as}} ‘Experiment 2 ’). In this study, three different life stages were tested: ‘Cohort C’ (exposed as eggs), ‘Cohort B’ (exposed as alevins) and ‘Cohort A’ (exposed as swim-up fry). Feeding behaviour was included as a new explanatory endpoint in addition to growth, clinical signs and mortality. Cohorts were exposed to two static dosing events with a 14 -day natural dissipation interval under the presence of sediment. Nominal peak-exposure concentrations were 0 (control), 32, 48, 72, 180 and 450 ng/L. No effects on survival were observed. The pulsed exposure consisted of two static dosing events with natural dissipation {{in the presence of}} sediment. A statistically significant impairment of feeding behaviour was observed at 48, 72, 180 and 450 ng/L (nominal). The severity of impairment was concentration dependent. At 48 and 72 ng/L, the fry returned to normal feeding within 96 h of the exposure peak. A statistically significant difference in growth was found for swim-up fry exposed to a peak of 72, 180 and 450 ng/L (3.4 % shorter body length than the control in the highest concentration). Based on observations made in Experiment 2 and the conclusions put forward by Groh et al., we hypothesize that observed clinical signs impaired feeding behaviour and consequently growth in both experiments.|$|E
30|$|During model validation, no {{differences}} {{from the control}} were predicted for weight and length at all treatment levels for the fish exposed as eggs (Cohort C), and very low level effects were predicted for the fish exposed as alevins (Cohort B). This is in full agreement with conclusions from empirical data. However, data availability for <b>beta-cyfluthrin</b> was not ideal for an in-depth model validation. The data set did not provide any information on effects (since there were hardly any observed) and can thus only be used to illustrate that the model is {{in agreement with the}} prediction of no effects. Having a validation study that shows effect would be preferable for further validation of the modelling approach. Moreover, TKTD model calibration and validation is best done using time-dependent data (e.g. [18]). In both ELS studies, the only information on effects on growth is body size measurements {{at the end of the}} test (as prescribed in the OECD guideline). For a DEB analysis, ELS studies would yield much more information if measurements on growth over time would be available. Even one additional data point (e.g. weight/length after hatching or at swim-up) would substantially increase the informative value of the data for a DEB analyses and thus the confidence in the subsequent model predictions. Following the recently published EFSA opinion on TKTD models (REF), validation data should comprise of at least two exposure profiles with at least 2 pulses each separated by a no-exposure interval of different duration. Moreover, mortality or immobility reported for at least 7 time points. If these rules are followed when conducting modified exposure studies, the data will be useful for the validation of TKTD models.|$|E
