5|$|The trio {{fight their}} way through Roman′s men, {{reaching}} an underground chamber where Nate believes the statue is buried. Meanwhile, Eddy, consumed by paranoia, warns Roman that an unearthly force has been killing off his men, which the former dismisses as nonsense. Nate investigates the chamber but not <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> separated from Sully via a booby-trapped secret doorway. Unfortunately, Nate and Elena, after deciding to carry on without Sully, find not the statue but Drake's corpse, with whom he sadly leaves the ring (believing he never found the sarcophagus). A group of zombie-like creatures swarm him and his companions, including Eddy and his bodyguard. In the chaos that follows, Eddy and his man are killed. Nate and Elena press on and find themselves in an old Nazi submarine base built into the island. Looking for a way out, Nate finds a letter written by Drake exposing the truth: El Dorado is protected by a curse that turned both the Spanish colonists and the German soldiers into monsters. Drake sought to destroy it, but the creatures killed him before he could; a picture reveals that Drake's corpse {{was in front of}} the statue before it was moved by the Germans.|$|E

500|$|For Being There, Tweedy {{wanted to}} blend the {{experiences}} he had making music with {{the ones he}} had listening to music. One of the first songs that Tweedy wrote was [...] "Misunderstood", a song about a tortured musical artist {{from the point of}} view of a fan. The song contains several overt references to the breakup of Uncle Tupelo, including the addition of insults that Farrar used against Tweedy—specifically one calling him a [...] "mama's boy". Part of the song's lyrics ("Take the guitar player for a ride/See, he ain't never been satisfied/He thinks he owes some kind of debt/Be years <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> over it") are originally from Peter Laughner, an underground alternative rock artist from Cleveland that died at 24 in 1977, taken from his song [...] "Amphetamine". The song concludes with the artist lashing out against the listener with satirical self-pity, a rebellion against the way that fans saw Uncle Tupelo as only an archetype of Gram Parsons inspired country rock. To induce a feeling of chaos on the track, the members of Wilco recorded a track where the members switched to novel instruments and placed sections of it into the song. The theme of a [...] "tortured artist" [...] is found in other songs as well; the end of [...] "Sunken Treasure" [...] features Tweedy calling for the renewal of his youth as a punk rocker.|$|E

500|$|By 1908, {{the summer}} conference {{had come to}} favor battlecruisers over armored cruisers. The {{increasing}} range of torpedoes and the distances at which future gun battles {{were expected to be}} fought seemed to favor speed over armor. Gunnery officers [...] "laid great stress upon the value of getting the range first and then smothering, or beating down, the enemy's fire <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> the range." [...] The conference concluded that battlecruisers would be worth building, with the caveat that they be considered in the same category as armored cruisers, in support of the battle fleet but not to fight in the line with fully armored battleships. A majority report recommended a top speed of at least 20 percent above that of battleships. As U.S. battleships then being built were expected to steam at , this meant a minimum speed for battlecruisers of [...] The Bureau of Construction and Repair (C) sketched out such ships the following year, {{at the request of the}} Secretary of the Navy, as fast equivalents of the [...] ships being considered. By adopting a [...] hull on a displacement of , it could produce a vessel that could travel at [...] and carry eight 50-caliber 12-inch guns in four twin turrets and equivalent armor; the savings in weight from eliminating two of the Wyomings six turrets more than balanced the added length and height of the armor belt. An enlarged belt was required by a deeper hull, as all American battlecruiser studies required deep hulls to retain their girder strength because those hulls had to be abnormally long to attain their speed. If the armor belt were reduced by an average of three inches, a fifth turret could be added. Four intermediate proposals included one with intermediate armor and eight 12-inch guns and one with Wyoming armor and six 12-inch guns. None of these designs included superfiring turrets. The General Board retained these sketches but did not recommend construction.|$|E

2500|$|In a {{classical}} turn-based system, only one character may act at a time; all other characters remain still, {{with a few}} exceptions that may involve the use of special abilities. The order in which the characters act is usually dependent on their attributes, such as speed or agility. This system rewards strategic planning more than quickness. It also points to the fact that realism in games is a means to the end of immersion in the game world, not an end in itself. A turn-based system makes it possible, for example, to run within range of an opponent and kill him <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> a chance to act, or duck out from behind hard cover, fire, and retreat back without an opponent being able to fire, which are of course both impossibilities. However, tactical possibilities have been created by this unreality that did not exist before; the player determines whether the loss of immersion in the reality of the game is worth the satisfaction gained from the development of the tactic and its successful execution. Fallout has been praised as being [...] "the shining example of a good turn-based Combat System".|$|E
