40|$|This study {{compared}} victim <b>blaming</b> and perpetrator <b>blaming</b> in {{a sample}} of police officers (N = 123), comparing the responses of police officers specially trained to deal with rape victims with those who had not received this training. Victim <b>blaming</b> was significantly predicted by rape myth acceptance and belief in a just world but not by gender role. For perpetrator <b>blaming,</b> significant differences were found for gender role, but no significant relationship was found with rape myth acceptance or belief in a just world. There {{were no significant differences between}} officers who were specially trained and those who were not in terms of victim <b>blaming,</b> but there were significant differences in relation to perpetrator <b>blaming.</b> No relationships were found between police experience (measured as years of service) and victim <b>blaming</b> or perpetrator <b>blaming.</b> These findings are discussed in the context of previous victim and perpetrator <b>blaming</b> research and the real-world implications for criminal justice systems...|$|R

There is apparently no clear consensus on the matter.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} how quotes from authority sources impacted college students’ attribution of responsibility in sexual assault scenarios. Undergraduate students (N = 97) {{from a small}} liberal arts college in the Southwest read one of three quotes related to victim blaming: one that <b>blames</b> the victim for the situation, is against <b>blaming</b> the victim, and a neutral-unrelated quote. Next they read a scenario leading up to a sexual assault. Levels of victim <b>blaming</b> were measured using {{a modified version of}} the Attitudes toward Rape Victims Scale (Ward, 1988). The results indicated that authority quotes did not significantly affect participants’ victim <b>blaming</b> attitudes. However, males reported higher victim <b>blaming</b> perceptions than females, which supported a secondary hypothesis about gender differences in victim <b>blaming.</b> The data shows that while some results were significant, authority sources may not be the best avenue to elicit differences in victim <b>blaming</b> attitudes. Future research should explore how rape myth education affects victim <b>blaming</b> attitudes and examine how to best reduce male perceptions of victim <b>blaming...</b>|$|R

5|$|A {{court of}} enquiry was held the {{following}} month in Liverpool by the Board of Trade, and focused particularly on {{the roles of the}} captains in the tragedy as well as the design of the Liverpool lifeboat. The court found that no-one was to <b>blame</b> for the loss of either Ellen Southard or the Liverpool lifeboat. Captain James Martin and his crew were praised for their gallantry in getting everyone off the ship, and absolved of any <b>blame</b> with respect to the capsizing of the lifeboat. The lifeboat was furthermore found to be of sound design and suitably adapted to her role, but debate continued for many years about the merits of the tubular design vs the self-righting one, as well as the requirement for lifeboats to be powered.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} victim <b>blaming</b> for body weight and victim <b>blaming</b> for rape. This study aims {{to bring these}} two research strands together to examine victim <b>blaming</b> attitudes towards overweight rape victims. Weight stigma and victim <b>blaming</b> are significant problems in health care, so a sample of future health care providers were recruited to examine their attitudes towards rape victims depending on weight and sexual history. Hypothetical patient files were presented, followed by a questionnaire assessing victim <b>blaming</b> attitudes. Results indicated that sexual history still has a strong influence on victim <b>blaming</b> (more so for men than women), and that patient weight did not influence participants 2 ̆ 7 attitudes towards patients. A three-way interaction was found which indicated that sexual history did not influence attitudes towards overweight patients, but {{that men and women}} had opposite reactions to normal weight patients.
