5|$|In April 1963, Galaxy Publishing {{brought out}} {{the first issue of}} Worlds of Tomorrow, another science-fiction {{magazine}}, also edited by Pohl. The magazine published some well-received material and was profitable, but Guinn, the publisher and owner, decided in 1967 that it would be <b>better</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> Galaxy resume a monthly schedule; both Worlds of Tomorrow and Galaxy were bimonthly at that time, while If was monthly. With the August 1967 issue Worlds of Tomorrow was merged with If, though it was another year before Galaxy actually switched to a monthly schedule. By this time, If had become monthly again, starting with the July 1964 issue (though the schedule had an initial hiccup, omitting September 1964).|$|E
5|$|The album's {{original}} cover art by Burton Silverman features a watercolour {{portrait of a}} long-haired, bearded man in shabby clothes. The idea for the cover came from a photograph Anderson's wife took of a homeless man on Thames Embankment, and Anderson later felt {{it would have been}} <b>better</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> used the photograph rather than commission the painting. Ian Anderson recalls posing for a photograph for the painting, though Silverman claims it was a self-portrait. The artwork was commissioned and purchased by Chrysalis Records head Terry Ellis. Artist Silverman claims the art was only licensed for use as an album cover, and not for merchandising; and approached the band seeking remuneration for its further use. Silverman and Anderson have different accounts of level of enmity involved in this. The original artwork for both the front and back covers are now privately owned by an unknown family, apparently having been stolen from a London hotel room.|$|E

ODA leader Pavel Sehnal said that Kulhánek is a right-wing candidate, that was missing in the election. Miloš Zeman stated {{that he does not}} know Kulhánek well but remembers him as a successful manager of Škoda Auto, adding that he does not have a problem with Kulhánek's candidacy because he believes that it is <b>better</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> more candidates.|$|E
25|$|The Poles' {{resistance}} in Warsaw is a Jewish resistance. Only yids {{are capable of}} the blackmail of putting {{women and children in}} the front line, {{to take advantage of the}} Germans' sense of scruple. The Germans have no interest in the destruction of Romania. Only a pro-German government can save us... What is happening on the frontier with Bukovina is a scandal, because new waves of Jews are flooding into the country. Rather than a Romania again invaded by kikes, it would be <b>better</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a German protectorate.|$|E

25|$|The line {{originally}} {{opened to}} provide access from the centre for the new residential areas {{in the eastern part}} of city, along the right bank of the Neva River. However, delays in the construction of the future Frunzensko-Primorskaya Line (Line 5), compelled the metro officials to temporarily link the already completed northern part of the Line 5 (starting from Sadovaya) to Pravoberezhnaya Line, as they felt that it was <b>better</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a single connected line rather than two unconnected ones. From that point on, the line expanded northward, as per original plans of Line 5 expansion.|$|E
25|$|Persephone ("Sephy") Hadley is a cross, {{with dark}} skin, and the {{daughter}} of a wealthy senior politician, Kamal. Callum McGregor is a nought, with light skin. They used to play together when Jasmine, Sephy's mother, employed Meggie, Callum's mother, as a nanny. However, Jasmine fires Meggie for being unable to provide an alibi for Jasmine when Kamal confronts Jasmine's about his suspicions of her infidelity: that is only strongly suggested for now but is made explicit later. Since then, Sephy and Callum's friendship has been secret. As best friends, their relationship is frowned upon by society, like interracial friendships in the Southern United States before the Civil Rights Movement but in reverse, as dark skin is considered much <b>better</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> than light skin.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, in Lincolnshire, the new Spalding to Lincoln {{direct line}} opened from Spalding via Sleaford to Ruskington on 6 March 1882 {{and on the}} Lincoln on 1 August, on which date the Great Northern and Great Eastern Joint Railway came into being {{comprising}} {{in addition to the}} new Spalding– Lincoln line, the former GNR March to Spalding and Lincoln to Doncaster lines and the former GER Huntingdon to March line plus the Ramsey branch from Somersham. To the GER this was the line to the Yorkshire coal fields they had long been seeking, to the GNR it provided a new alternative line for freight from Huntingdon to Doncaster to relieve pressure on the main line. In the first five months of the joint line, the GNR lost £50,000 due to diverted traffic, but according to Lord Colville, chairman of the GNR, it was <b>better</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> half the receipts of a joint line than to have to compete with a new entirely foreign through line.|$|E

25|$|Result: Maria {{suggested}} that Odyssey create a cookbook aimed at professional women; whilst David and Andrew disagreed, everybody else did {{and despite the}} idea being badly received by the focus group, Maria persuaded Sean {{to go with it}} anyway, as she thought that it was <b>better</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a target market. The resulting book, while produced fairly professionally, was strongly criticised due to the cover not even making clear that it was a cookbook. On Platinum, the team came up with a book called #Where'sMummy?, which was aimed at people leaving home for the first time, and was designed to tie in with Twitter and other forms of social media. Lucy did not get on with the sub-team of Amy, Alice and Ashleigh and frequently argued with them, and when the book was produced, it contained many spelling errors that the clients were not impressed by (though they did acknowledge the time constraints the group were under). However, Navdeep delivered strong pitches for the cookbook, and Platinum secured orders from all three retailers, with a final total of 7,500 orders. On Odyssey, Maria and Andrew fronted the first two pitches, which seemingly went down well with the clients and {{with the rest of the}} team. However, Sean made the unusual decision to change the pitchers to Patrick and David for the third pitch, which did not go so well. Odyssey ultimately only got 800 orders, from just one of the retailers.|$|E

500|$|Among {{the lead}} actors, only Pierce had {{experience}} with voice acting {{prior to the}} making of Treasure Planet. Conli explained {{that they were looking}} for [...] "really the natural voice of the actor", and that sometimes it was <b>better</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an actor with no experience with voice work as he utilizes his natural voice instead of [...] "affecting a voice". The voice sessions were mostly done without any interaction with the other actors, but Gordon-Levitt expressed a desire to interact with Brian Murray because he found it difficult to act out most of the scenes between Jim Hawkins and John Silver alone.|$|E
500|$|William Plomer, {{writing in}} The Spectator after the book's first publication, thought it mistaken [...] "to regard Mr Waugh's more {{surprising}} situations as farcical or far-fetched; {{they are on}} the whole extremely realistic". However, the mixture of genres was not immediately understood or appreciated by some of Waugh's admirers; Connolly's initial thought was that Waugh had been [...] "destroyed as a writer", by snobbery and association with country-house living. In Sykes's view, the fleeting appearances in the book of characters from Waugh's farcical world, such as Lady Metroland, are awkward and intrusive—the world of A Handful of Dust is not outlandish: [...] "Evelyn would have done <b>better</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> forgotten Lady Metroland and her world altogether".|$|E
500|$|The Final Fantasy Legends soundtrack was {{composed}} by Nobuo Uematsu {{and consists of}} sixteen tracks. Uematsu struggled with composition at first, as the Game Boy's sound hardware {{was different from the}} Famicom's, featuring a new stereo option, unique waveforms, and only three musical notes. Kawazu wanted the game's music to resemble that of Square's two preceding Final Fantasy titles, but Uematsu chose to develop new waveforms. Despite Game Boy's limited audio capabilities, Uematsu expressed desire to compose music for it again in 2000, though added regarding the notion of a remake [...] "it would be <b>better</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> high quality music and graphics, but {{we need to make sure}} that the users enjoy the game." ...|$|E

Band members were divided over their experience of working with producer Rubin; some doubted his commitment to Slipknot as he split his time between many artists at once. Lead vocalist Corey Taylor admitted {{in an interview that}} he drank heavily throughout their time in the mansion, saying [...] "I would drink from the moment I got up until the moment I passed out." [...] He {{explained that}}; [...] "everything I did while I was drinking sounded like shit", while expressing how unhappy he was with the choice of vocal takes which ended up on the album.

Her other television roles include recurring appearances as Marlene on Dharma & Greg, and Penny in two episodes of Dead Like Me. Smith has also appeared in Phil of the Future and Teen Angel. Her one-scene role as pregnant checkout girl Nancy in 1991's City Slickers earned her [...] "more attention than all [...] previous roles combined", and taught her [...] "that it's far <b>better</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> small parts in big movies that everyone sees." [...] In 1997, she appeared as Lulu the palm reader in the independent film Just Write. Her other roles include parts in Barry Levinson's Toys and James L. Brooks' As Good as It Gets. Brooks, who is also executive producer of The Simpsons, had cast Smith in his 1994 film I'll Do Anything (in one of the film's musical numbers), but her part was cut. Aside from The Simpsons, Smith has recorded few voice-over parts, only commercials and the film We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story.
