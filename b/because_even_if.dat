25|$|In many cases, a dimmer can be {{replaced}} by a constant power module (CPM), which is typically a 20- or 50-ampere breaker in a dimming module casing. CPMs are used to supply line voltage to non-dimming electrical devices such as smoke machines, chain winches, and scenic motors that require constant operating voltage. When a device is powered by a CPM, it is fully energized whenever the CPM is turned on, independent of lighting console levels. CPMs must be used (in lieu of dimmers) to power non-dimming devices that require specific line voltages (e.g., in the US, 110 V, 60Hz power) in order to avoid damage to such devices. Dimmers are seldom used to control non-dimming devices <b>because</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> a dimmer channel is trusted to always operate at full power, it may not be controlled when communications are disrupted by start up and shut down of the lighting control surface, noise interference, or DMX disconnects or failure. Such a loss of control might cause a dimmer to dim a circuit and thus potentially damage its non-dimming device.|$|E

500|$|The {{dopamine}} system plays {{a crucial}} role in several aspects of addiction. [...] At the earliest stage, genetic differences that alter the expression of dopamine receptors in the brain can predict whether a person will find stimulants appealing or aversive. [...] Consumption of stimulants produces increases in brain dopamine levels that last from minutes to hours. [...] Finally, the chronic elevation in dopamine that comes with repetitive high-dose stimulant consumption triggers a wide-ranging set of structural changes in the brain that are responsible for the behavioral abnormalities which characterize an addiction. Treatment of stimulant addiction is very difficult, <b>because</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> consumption ceases, the craving that comes with psychological withdrawal does not. Even when the craving seems to be extinct, it may re-emerge when faced with stimuli that are associated with the drug, such as friends, locations and situations. Association networks in the brain are greatly interlinked.|$|E

500|$|Failures {{that lead}} to an {{application}} for cy-près are of two sorts; subsequent failure, where the trust, constituted properly, failed {{after a period of}} action, and initial failure, where the trust fails at creation. Subsequent failure cases are designed to have the charity's funds applied to more effective purposes, and as such money already donated to the charity cannot be returned to the next of kin of the original money; in Re Wright, it was said that [...] "once money has been effectually dedicated to charity... the testator's next of kin or residuary legatees are for ever excluded". Schemes for initial failure, on the other hand, ask the court to decide whether the gifts should be returned to the testator's estate and next of kin or be applied to a new purpose under cy-près. When deciding if a gift has failed, there is a distinction made between gifts to unincorporated bodies and incorporated bodies, as laid down in Re Vernon's Will Trust. This is because gifts to an unincorporated body must be treated as gifts to that body's purpose, not to the body itself, since unincorporated bodies cannot hold property. As such, the gift does not revert to the next of kin <b>because</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> the body is dissolved, the gift's purpose is (presumably) still valid.|$|E
500|$|The song {{has been}} {{described}} by several critics as a masterpiece. In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine placed the song at No.404 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, commenting that Dylan [...] "never sounded lonelier than in this seven-minute ballad, cut in a single take on Valentine's Day 1966." [...] (When Rolling Stone updated their list in 2010, the song dropped to No.413.) In 1999, Britain's Poet Laureate, Andrew Motion, chose it as his candidate for the best song lyric ever written. Motion praised [...] "the concentration and surprise" [...] of Dylan's lyrics, and said that, although he distanced himself from some of the singer's views about women, the [...] "rasp of his anger" [...] was a part of his greatness. The International Observer named the song the second best ever recorded in 2017, stating, [...] "The 24 year old Dylan was beginning to realize that no matter how many perfect songs he wrote he could not achieve immortality through his art as he perhaps once believed, <b>because</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> people were still listening to the music in 500 years, he would still be dead." [...] Commenting on the song in a 1985 interview, Dylan said, [...] "I still sing that song every once in a while. It still stands up now as it did then, maybe even more in some kind of weird way." ...|$|E
500|$|On the Foundation's motion, Judge Alison J. Nathan severed and {{dismissed}} from the lawsuit the partnership's copyright claim. According to Judge Nathan, the Constitution allows federal courts to decide only [...] "Cases" [...] or [...] "Controversies", which means ongoing or imminent disputes over legal rights, involving concrete facts and specific acts, that require court intervention {{in order to}} shield the plaintiff from harm or interference with its rights. The judge held that the partnership's complaint fell short of that standard <b>because</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> the Foundation continued to claim ownership of the design's copyright—and even if its claim was invalid—that claim would not legally harm the partnership or prevent it from making its own lawful uses of the design. The partnership did not claim that it owned the design's copyright, only that the Foundation did not. Since, according to the court, the Foundation promised not to sue the partnership for any [...] "potentially copyright-infringing uses of the Banana Design", the partnership could continue using the design {{and there would be}} no legal action that the Foundation could take (under copyright law) to stop it. And if, the court concluded, the partnership could continue with business as usual (as far as copyright was concerned) regardless of whether the Foundation actually owned the design's copyright, a court decision would have no practical consequences for the partnership; it would be a purely academic (or [...] "advisory") opinion, which federal courts may not issue. The court therefore [...] "dismissed without prejudice" [...] the partnership's request that it resolve whether the Foundation owned the design's copyright.|$|E

5000|$|Subordinating conjunctions, {{also called}} subordinators, are conjunctions that join an {{independent}} clause and a dependent clause, and also introduce adverb clauses.
