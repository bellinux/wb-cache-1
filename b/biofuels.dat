40|$|<b>Biofuel</b> is an alternative, sustainable, {{environmental}} friendly and renewable source of energy. <b>Biofuel</b> has gained attention nowadays {{due to the}} potential of reduced environmental impacts as well as increased economic and social benefits. The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine the prospects of <b>biofuel</b> to the environment, economy and social. This study employs qualitative research method whereby the insight regarding <b>biofuel</b> was collected through interview with a practitioner in this sector.

A 4. 5 kW at 1500 rpm single cylinder air cooled direct injection diesel engine {{was used for the}} present experimental work. The experimental results show that the brake thermal efficiency marginally increases with <b>biofuel</b> from 29. 98 % (neat diesel) to the maximum of 32. 4 % with <b>biofuel</b> at 80 % of maximum load. Also experiments were conducted with different blends of <b>biofuel</b> and diesel (B 20 and 840). Though the NO emissions are high with neat <b>biofuel</b> and blends, the other emissions like CO, HC and particulate matter (PM) are decreased. The PM emissions decrease when the percentage <b>biofuel</b> increases in the blend. It reduces from 8271 ng/s with neat diesel to 8137 ng/s with B 40. It further reduces to the minimum of 7842 ng/s with neat <b>biofuel.</b> The cylinder peak pressure increases as the <b>biofuel</b> quantity increases in the blend. The rate of premixed combustion increases with neat <b>biofuel</b> and its blends than neat diesel. Addition of <b>biofuel</b> with diesel decreases the combustion duration and ignition delay due to higher cetane number of <b>biofuel.</b> (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

The US Department of Energy (DOE) has identified pyrolysis based platforms as promising <b>biofuel</b> production pathways. Although the <b>biofuel</b> market remains in its early stage, it is expected {{to play an important role}} in climate policy in the future in the transportation sector. In this thesis, we will first propose a <b>biofuel</b> supply chain model to study the supply chain design and operational planning for advanced <b>biofuel</b> production, then a <b>biofuel</b> market model is developed to study the interactions between farmers, <b>biofuel</b> producers, blenders, and consumers along the <b>biofuel</b> supply chain in the market competitive setting. For the <b>biofuel</b> supply chain model, the focused production pathway is corn stover fast pyrolysis with upgrading to hydrocarbon gasoline equivalent fuel. The model is formulated with a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) to investigate facility locations, facility capacities at the strategic level, and feedstock flow and <b>biofuel</b> production decisions at the operational level. In the model, we accommodate different biomass supply and <b>biofuel</b> demand scenarios with supply shortage penalty and storage cost for excess <b>biofuel</b> production. Numerical results illustrate the supply chain design and operational planning decision making for advanced <b>biofuel</b> production. Unit costs for advanced <b>biofuel</b> under changing of scenarios are also analyzed. The case study demonstrates the economic feasibility of <b>biofuel</b> production at a commercial scale in Iowa. The second part of the thesis work focuses on analyzing the interaction between the key stakeholders along the supply chain. A bottom-up equilibrium model is built for <b>biofuel</b> market to study the competition in the advanced <b>biofuel</b> market, explicitly formulating the interactions between farmers, <b>biofuel</b> producers, blenders, and consumers. The model simulates the profit maximization of multiple market entities by incorporates their competitive decisions in farmers 2 ̆ 7 land allocation, biomass transportation, <b>biofuel</b> production, and <b>biofuel</b> blending.

40|$|AbstractDepletion of {{petroleum}} derived fuel and environmental concern has promoted {{to look over}} the <b>biofuel</b> as an alternative fuel sources. But a complete substitution {{of petroleum}} derived fuels by <b>biofuel</b> is impossible from the production capacity and engine compatibility point of view. Yet, marginal replacement of diesel by <b>biofuel</b> can prolong the depletion of petroleum resources and abate the radical climate change caused by automotive pollutants. Energy security and climate change are the two major driving forces for worldwide <b>biofuel</b> development which also have the potential to stimulate the agro-industry. Nonetheless, there are other problems associated with <b>biofuel</b> usage such as automotive engine compatibility in long term operation and also food security issues that stem from <b>biofuel</b> production from food-grade oil-seeds. Moreover, severe corrosion, carbon deposition and wearing of engine parts of the fuel supply system components are also caused by biodiesel. Discussing all this advantages and disadvantages of biodiesel, it is comprehended that, a dedicated biodiesel engine is the ultimate solution for commercializing biodiesel. Brazil successfully boosted their bioethanol marketing by introducing flexible-fuel vehicles (FFV), which have a dedicated engine for both ethanol and gasoline. A similar approach can bring a breakthrough in <b>biofuel</b> commercialization and production. So dedicated <b>biofuel</b> engine is a challenge for mass commercialization and utilization of <b>biofuel.</b> In this lecture worldwide <b>biofuel</b> scenario is assessed by <b>biofuel</b> policies and standards.

40|$|With rapid {{expansion}} of <b>biofuel</b> production, major concerns have arisen over higher food costs and competition between food, feed, and <b>biofuel</b> for energy-rich commodities.

We assume input and output coefficients and substitution elasticities adjust over time in response to changing prices in a dynamic market environment with productivity growth. Three alternative oil price scenarios are considered for <b>biofuel</b> feedstock production and conversion. The price of oil puts both a floor and ceiling on feedstock price. We conclude that global <b>biofuel</b> expansion will be limited {{in the absence of}} government incentives and mandates, unless high real oil prices prevail.

The US Department of Energy (DOE) has employed increasing effort on promoting the advanced <b>biofuel</b> productions. Although the advanced <b>biofuel</b> remains at its early stage, it is expected {{to play an important role}} in climate policy in the future in the transportation sector. This dissertation studies the emerging <b>biofuel</b> supply chain and markets by analyzing the production cost, and the outcomes of the <b>biofuel</b> market, including blended fuel market price and quantity, <b>biofuel</b> contract price and quantity, profitability of each stakeholder (farmers, <b>biofuel</b> producers, <b>biofuel</b> blenders) in the market. I also address government policy impacts on the emerging <b>biofuel</b> market. The dissertation is composed with three parts, each in a paper format. The first part studies the supply chain of emerging <b>biofuel</b> industry. Two optimization-based models are built to determine the number of facilities to deploy, facility locations, facility capacities, and operational planning within facilities. Cost analyses have been conducted under a variety of <b>biofuel</b> demand scenarios. It is my intention that this model will shed light on <b>biofuel</b> supply chain design considering operational planning under uncertain demand situations. The second part of the dissertation work focuses on analyzing the interaction between the key stakeholders along the supply chain. A bottom-up equilibrium model is built for the emerging <b>biofuel</b> market to study the competition in the advanced <b>biofuel</b> market, explicitly formulating the interactions between farmers, <b>biofuel</b> producers, blenders, and consumers. The model simulates the profit maximization of multiple market entities by incorporating their competitive decisions in farmers’ land allocation, biomass transportation, <b>biofuel</b> production, and <b>biofuel</b> blending. As such, the equilibrium model is capable of and appropriate for policy analysis, especially for those policies that have complex ramifications and result in sophisticate interactions among multiple stakeholders. The third part of the dissertation investigates the impacts of flexible fuel vehicles (FFVs) market penetration levels on the market outcomes, including cellulosic <b>biofuel</b> production and price, blended fuel market price, and profitability of each stakeholder in the <b>biofuel</b> supply chain for imperfectly competitive <b>biofuel</b> markets. In this paper, I investigate the penetration levels of FFVs by incorporating the substitution among different fuels in blended fuel demand functions through “cross price elasticity” in a bottom-up equilibrium model framework. The complementarity based problem is solved by a Taylor expansion-based iterative procedure. At each step of the iteration, the highly nonlinear complementarity problems with constant elasticity of demand functions are linearized into linear complimentarity problems and solved until it converges. This model can be applied to investigate the interaction between the stakeholders in the <b>biofuel</b> market, and to assist decision making for both cellulosic <b>biofuel</b> investors and government...|$|R
