For single-mode fiber, fiber ends are typically polished with a slight curvature that makes the mated connectors touch only at their cores. This is called a physical contact (PC) polish. The curved surface may be polished at an angle, to make an angled physical contact (APC) connection. Such connections have higher loss than PC connections, but greatly reduced <b>back</b> <b>reflection,</b> because light that reflects from the angled surface leaks out of the fiber core.

5000|$|For {{applications}} requiring {{very low}} back-reflection, the fiber end-face is polished {{at an angle}} (the typical industry standard being 8°) to prevent light that reflects from the interface from traveling back up the fiber. Because of the angle, the reflected light does not stay in the fiber core but instead leaks out into the cladding. Angle-polished connectors only mate properly to other angle-polished connectors. Mating to a non-angle polished connector causes very high insertion loss. Generally angle-polished connectors have higher insertion loss than good quality straight physical contact ones. [...] "Ultra" [...] quality connectors may achieve comparable <b>back</b> <b>reflection</b> to an angled connector when connected, but an angled connection maintains low <b>back</b> <b>reflection</b> even when the output end of the fiber is unmated.|$|E

5000|$|Another type {{of fiber}} laser is the fiber disk laser. In such lasers, the pump is not {{confined}} within the cladding of the fiber, but instead pump light is delivered across the core multiple times because the core is coiled on itself like a rope. This configuration is suitable for power scaling in which many pump sources are used around {{the periphery of the}} coil. [...] Fiber disk lasers have exceptional protection against <b>back</b> <b>reflection</b> compared to traditional fiber lasers. Fiber disk lasers can be used for welding and cutting applications requiring more than 1000 watts of power.|$|E
5000|$|The power {{reduction}} {{is done by}} such means as absorption, reflection, diffusion, scattering, deflection, diffraction, and dispersion, etc. Optical attenuators usually work by absorbing the light, like sunglasses absorb extra light energy. They typically have a working wavelength range in which they absorb all light energy equally. They should not reflect the light or scatter the light in an air gap, since that could cause unwanted <b>back</b> <b>reflection</b> in the fiber system. Another type of attenuator utilizes a length of high-loss optical fiber, that operates upon its input optical signal power level {{in such a way}} that its output signal power level is less than the input level.|$|E
50|$|Such a cap allows spontaneously emitted photons {{to escape}} from the active layer and {{prevents}} them from resonating in the cavity. Rays cannot bounce (Figure 3) as in an uncovered disk. This could allow an order of magnitude increase in the maximum power achievable by a disk laser. In both cases, the <b>back</b> <b>reflection</b> of the ASE from the edges of the disk should be suppressed. This can be done with absorbing layers, shown with green in Figure 4. At operation close to the maximal power, {{a significant part of the}} energy goes into ASE; therefore, the absorbing layers also should be supplied with heat sinks, which are not shown in the figure.|$|E
50|$|It is {{therefore}} natural that even {{small amounts of}} back-reflections are amplified inside the SLED chip in a similar manner, producing optical power levels of several tens of milliwatts at the back facet, which may destroy the SLED device. SLEDs should be carefully protected against external optical feedback. Even small levels of feedback can reduce the overall emission bandwidth and the output power, or sometimes even lead to parasitic lasing, causing narrow spikes in the emission spectrum. Some devices may even be damaged by optical feedback. Note that the Fresnel reflection from a perpendicularly cleaved fiber end is already well above the level of feedback which can be tolerated. If <b>back</b> <b>reflections</b> cannot be avoided, an optical isolator must be installed directly behind the SLED module. The isolator provides a low insertion loss from the SLED to the fiber and a high insertion loss in the back direction. However, SLEDs from certain component manufacturers are on the market featuring intrinsically safe designs with high robustness against optical <b>back</b> <b>reflections.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Quantum {{tunnelling}} {{falls under}} the domain of quantum mechanics: the study of what happens at the quantum scale. This process cannot be directly perceived, but much of its understanding is shaped by the microscopic world, which classical mechanics cannot adequately explain. To understand the phenomenon, particles attempting to travel between potential barriers {{can be compared to}} a ball trying to roll over a hill; quantum mechanics and classical mechanics differ in their treatment of this scenario. Classical mechanics predicts that particles that do not have enough energy to classically surmount a barrier {{will not be able to}} reach the other side. Thus, a ball without sufficient energy to surmount the hill would roll back down. Or, lacking the energy to penetrate a wall, it would bounce <b>back</b> (<b>reflection)</b> or in the extreme case, bury itself inside the wall (absorption). In quantum mechanics, these particles can, with a very small probability, tunnel to the other side, thus crossing the barrier. Here, the [...] "ball" [...] could, in a sense, borrow energy from its surroundings to tunnel through the wall or [...] "roll over the hill", paying it back by making the reflected electrons more energetic than they otherwise would have been.|$|E
50|$|In {{fiber optics}} and telecommunications, an index-matching {{material}} {{may be used}} in conjunction with pairs of mated connectors or with mechanical splices to reduce signal reflected in the guided mode (known as return loss) (see: Optical fiber connector). Without the use of an index-matching material, Fresnel reflections will occur at the smooth end faces of a fiber unless there is no fiber-air interface or other significant mismatch in refractive index. These reflections may be as high as -14 dB (i.e., 14 dB below the optical power of the incident signal). When the reflected signal returns to the transmitting end, it may be reflected again and return to the receiving end at a level that is (28 plus twice the fiber loss) dB below the direct signal. The reflected signal will also be delayed by twice the delay time introduced by the fiber. The twice-reflected, delayed signal superimposed on the direct signal may noticeably degrade an analog baseband intensity-modulated video signal. Conversely, for digital transmission, the reflected signal will often have no practical effect on the detected signal seen at the decision point of the digital optical receiver except in marginal cases where bit-error ratio is significant. However, certain digital transmitters such as those employing a Distributed Feedback Laser may be affected by <b>back</b> <b>reflection</b> and then fall outside specifications such as Side Mode Suppression Ratio, potentially degrading system bit error ratio, so networking standards intended for DFB lasers may specify a back-reflection tolerance such as -10 dB for transmitters so that they remain within specification even without index matching. This back-reflection tolerance might be achieved using an optical isolator or by way of reduced coupling efficiency.|$|E

40|$|This {{alignment}} {{technique was}} developed while performing heterodyne velocimetry measurements at LLNL. There {{are a few}} minor items needed, such as a white card with aperture in center, visible alignment laser, IR <b>back</b> <b>reflection</b> meter, and a microscope to view the bridge surface. The work was performed on KCP flyers that were 6 and 8 mils wide. The probes used were Oz Optics manufactured with focal distances of 42 mm and 26 mm. Both probes provide a spot size of approximately 80 ?m at 1550 nm. The 42 mm probes were specified to provide an internal <b>back</b> <b>reflection</b> of - 35 to - 40 dB, and the probe back reflections were measured to be - 37 dB and - 33 dB. The 26 mm probes were specified as - 30 dB and both measured - 30. 5 dB. The probe is initially aligned normal to the flyer/bridge surface. This provides a very high return signal, up to - 2 dB, due to the bridge reflectivity. A white card {{with a hole in}} the center as an aperture can be used to check the reflected beam position relative to the probe and launch beam, and the alignment laser spot centered on the bridge, see Figure 1 and Figure 2. The IR <b>back</b> <b>reflection</b> meter is used to measure the dB return from the probe and surface, and a white card or similar object is inserted between the probe and surface to block surface reflection. It may take several iterations between the visible alignment laser and the IR <b>back</b> <b>reflection</b> meter to complete this alignment procedure. Once aligned normal to the surface, the probe should be tilted to position the visible alignment beam as shown in Figure 3, and the flyer should be translated in the X and Y axis to reposition the alignment beam onto the flyer as shown in Figure 4. This tilting of the probe minimizes the amount of light from the bridge reflection into the fiber within the probe while maintaining the alignment as near normal to the flyer surface as possible. When the <b>back</b> <b>reflection</b> is measured after the tilt adjustment, the level should be about - 3 dB to - 6 dB higher than the probes specified <b>back</b> <b>reflection.</b> This 3 to 6 dB increase in <b>back</b> <b>reflection</b> from the surface relative to the probes specified <b>back</b> <b>reflection</b> is the optimal level for acquiring data from the flyer.
