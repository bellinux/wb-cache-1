New methods of generating non linear chirp waveforms and of improving their Doppler tolerance has been investigated by Doerry Further studies of Hyperbolic chirps have been carried out by Kiss, Readhead, Nagajyothi and Rajarajeswari and Yang and Sarkar. Convolution windows have been investigated by Sahoo and Panda who show that they can result in very low sidelobes yet be Doppler tolerant, but may suffer from some pulse broadening. [...] Wen and his co-workers have also discussed convolution windows. Some new window functions have been proposed by Samad and Sinha and Ferreira, which claim improved performance over the familiar functions. Several techniques to lower the sidelobe levels of the compressed pulses for non-linear FM chirps are compared by Varshney and Thomas.In a paper by Vizitui, sidelobe reduction is considered where phase pre-distortion is applied to non-linear FM chirps, rather than to linear chirps. Lower sidelobes and some improvement in Doppler tolerance is claimed.There have been extensive investigations of phase modulation for pulse compression schemes, such as <b>biphase</b> (binary <b>Phase</b> <b>shift</b> <b>keying)</b> and polyphase coding methods, but this work is not considered here.|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{modulation}} {{is a key}} factor in communication, because without an appropriate modulation method or scheme, getting an expected throughput in such a communication effort would be impossible to achieve. Communication engineers and researchers have not relented in trying to find the best modulation methods aimed at achieving an expected throughput, bandwidth/power efficiency, low error performance, etc in digital communication networks. Digital modulation is preferred to the analogue modulation due to their error-free capability. Moreso, this choice of digital modulation is dependent on the type of communication network that is to be established. However, trade-offs must be made between the bandwidth efficiency, power efficiency and the cost of implementation of such a network. This paper focuses onsome methods usually employed in the process of modulation in digital communication networks. Specifically, binary <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> <b>keying,</b> quadrature <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> <b>keying,</b> eight <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> <b>keying</b> and sixteen <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> <b>keying</b> are investigated, using the matrix laboratory (MATLAB) software as the simulation tool in which the bit error rate (BER), symbol error rate (SER), spectral efficiency and power efficiency are comparatively analysed.
