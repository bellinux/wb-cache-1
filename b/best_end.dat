500|$|... "The Time Is Now" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode—along with the preceding episode [...] "The Fourth Horseman—an [...] "A". VanDerWerff {{felt that it}} [...] "may {{be one of the}} four or five best cinematic depictions {{of the end of the}} world ever filmed", praising the uncommon approach of depicting the world ending, rather than just showing the aftermath. Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 5 out of 5. Gibron felt that the two-part episodes were [...] "a one-two punch that many dramatic series would die for", finding the conclusion to have been effectively hinted at throughout the season. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated [...] "The Time Is Now" [...] five stars out of five. Shearman felt that the episode would have been [...] "the <b>best</b> <b>end</b> to the show imaginable", had the series not produced a third season. He considered the episode's writing and conclusion to have been a brave decision, potentially alienating its viewers but producing [...] "a thrilling and unforgettable piece of television"; he also considered the season as a whole to be less consistent but more daring than the first season.|$|E

2500|$|Both {{ends of the}} All-Southern team {{came from}} Vanderbilt, Hek Wakefield and Lynn Bomar. Bomar, who was a {{consensus}} All-American in 1923, was the only Southern player selected for Walter Camp's All-American team– {{and one of the}} first All-Americans selected for his first team from the South, as well as the last. Georgia athletic director Herman Stegeman called Wakefield [...] "the best player in the South." [...] Coach Dan McGugin ranked Wakefield as the <b>best</b> <b>end</b> he ever had in his long career at Vanderbilt.|$|E
2500|$|The Capital Times from Wisconsin picked Kirk as the <b>best</b> <b>end</b> in {{the west}} and noted, [...] "The Wolverine flank {{protected}} by Kirk is one of the strongest in the country. [...] Little has been gained around him, while on the offense his backs have had plenty of success -- thanks to Kirk who helps pave the way." [...] The Iowa City Press-Citizen wrote that Kirk [...] "seems to stand out by himself" [...] among the ends, noting that he [...] "attracted most attention for his receiving of passes and his deadly spilling of interference." ...|$|E
2500|$|An 1890 [...] {{profile of}} the Princeton {{football}} team described Warren as follows:"Ralph Herbert Warren, always called 'Pop' in college, completes the quartette of the old team. [...] He is looked upon {{as one of the}} <b>best</b> <b>end</b> rushers now playing. A sure tackler and always well down the field on a punt, he is an invaluable man. [...] He, too, however, has a disabled knee, and if he does not recover in time for the Yale game, {{it will be hard to}} fill his place. [...] When he began playing last year he was only a Freshman." ...|$|E

2500|$|On August 15, 1945, the United States celebrated Victory over Japan Day, {{marking the}} end of {{hostilities}} in World War II. Less than two weeks later, on August 27, 1945, after a two-week break following summer practice, Michigan began fall drills in Ann Arbor. [...] During a scrimmage in early September, end Ed Bahlow, a Navy training veteran who had played for Wisconsin in 1943 and was considered Michigan's <b>best</b> <b>end</b> prospect since Ed Frutig, sustained a broken leg, just above his right ankle, in a collision with Dan Dworsky and was lost to the team for the season.|$|E
2500|$|Billy Evans {{echoed the}} same sentiment:"Kirk was unquestionably the <b>best</b> <b>end</b> the west, {{if not the}} country, has {{produced}} in years. [...] As a defensive player, he was without a peer. [...] He also was very proficient in handling the forward pass. [...] Kirk starred in every game that Michigan played during the 1922 season. [...] No one player meant more {{to the success of}} Yost's great eleven than Kirk. [...] Every critic in the west selected Kirk on either the 'Big Ten' or middle west all-star teams. [...] A great majority of the critics of the country placed him on their All-American elevens." ...|$|E
2500|$|The season's only loss came to Minnesota {{in a close}} 7–6 game. Frutig nearly won {{the game}} for Michigan as he blocked a George Franck punt, which Reuben Kelto {{recovered}} on the Minnesota three-yard line. But Minnesota intercepted Harmon's pass in the end zone, and Michigan lost by one point. Harmon had also missed a point after touchdown kick earlier in the game. Despite the loss, one columnist said of Frutig's performance against Minnesota: “The <b>best</b> <b>end</b> I saw all year I saw in this game. That was Frutig of Michigan and that goes for offense and defense. He ruined about six coming in there trying to block those Gopher punts. He did block one.” ...|$|E
5000|$|The <b>best</b> <b>ending</b> has Chris and Jill {{escaping}} the mansion alongside a third S.T.A.R.S. member (Rebecca or Barry, {{depending on who}} is the player character) after defeating the Tyrant and destroying the mansion.|$|R

2500|$|The Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences praised Portal for its [...] "hint of comedy", citing GLaDOS' [...] "humorous and homicidal" [...] personality. Writer Lou Kesten, in {{discussing}} humor in video games, cited GLaDOS as possibly {{being the first}} time he discovered that video games could make him laugh out loud. The New York Times editor Charles Herold praised GLaDOS, calling her comments [...] "wildly funny". In an article titled [...] "The GLaDOS Effect - Can Antagonists Rule the World?", Gamasutra publisher Simon Carless describes her as the one true memorable character from Portal. He states that she is the reason he keeps returning to play Portal, describing her as funny, unexpected, and beguiling. The Daily Telegraphs Tom Hoggins wrote that GLaDOS [...] "became one of gaming’s most compelling villains" [...] and that [...] "it managed to get people attached to an inanimate cube. It had the <b>best</b> <b>end</b> credits song of all time. It was funny, smart, fresh and managed to feel like the plucky, accidental hero". GameSpy's Nathan Meunier wrote that [...] "without inhuman antagonist GLaDOS spewing a laugh-inducing tirade of thinly veiled threats in her deadpan robotic drone as you progress deeper into the bowels of Aperture Science, Portal would have been a very different game".|$|E
2500|$|Redden {{enrolled}} at the University of Michigan where {{he became one of}} the stars of Fielding H. Yost's famous [...] "Point-a-Minute" [...] teams of 1901, 1902, and 1903. [...] The 1901 team compiled a record of 110 and outscored its opponents 5500. In Redden's sophomore, junior and senior years, Michigan was 3301 and outscored opponents by a total of 1,764 to 18. [...] At the end of his senior season, Redden was a unanimous first-team All-Western selection, including designations by the Chicago Record-Herald, The Chicago Daily News, and The Inter-Ocean. [...] He was one of only five players upon whom the [...] "Western football critics have been able to unanimously agree." [...] The Chicago Daily News also designated Redden as the captain of its 1903 All-Western team and explained its choice as follows:"Redden's cool head in a game, his speed and strong playing mark him as the most legitimate selection for captain among all the other captains ... Redden's speed up the field on punts, his ability to stiff arm every interferer without slackening up that speed, and his open-field tackling mark him as the <b>best</b> <b>end</b> for the pure type of end work the west has seen in years. [...] Offensively his skill lies in assisting his tackle in boxing an opponent and assisting the runner after he has passed the line." ...|$|E
2500|$|Platinum adds an {{area called}} the [...] "Wi-Fi Plaza", {{an area that}} {{features}} several Pokémon species-themed mini-games and allows up to 20 players {{to be present in}} it. Platinum also introduces the Vs. Recorder, which allows players to record battles held in the Battle Frontier or on Wi-Fi. The GTS system, a system that allows players to trade anonymously on the Wi-Fi connection, returns in Platinum; one change to the GTS system allows players to be notified via email when a trade has commenced, though outside Japan, this feature has been reduced to being merely a message on the player's Wii. A variety of changes have been made to the appearance and availability of Pokémon; Giratina, Shaymin, and Rotom all have new forms, with Rotom having four new forms. The trios of Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres, along with the trio of Regice, Regirock, and Registeel, {{have been added to the}} game as well. The game also adds the Battle Frontier, a feature first introduced in Pokémon Emerald. Platinums Pokémon Contests play similarly to Diamond and Pearls; they feature three stages, awarding ribbons to Pokémon for having the <b>best</b> <b>end</b> result. Baked goods called Poffins can be made from berries and fed to Pokémon in order to improve certain traits, depending on the kind of Poffin made. In addition to compatibility with Diamond and Pearl, Platinum offers compatibility with the Game Boy Advance Pokémon RPGs. Players can upload Pokémon from Platinum to the Wii games Pokémon Battle Revolution and My Pokémon Ranch, though the latter is only compatible with Platinum in Japan. A significant addition is the Distortion World, which features distorted physics versus those in the standard game.|$|E
