25|$|A {{range of}} new 750cc and 900cc triple-cylinder bikes and 1000cc and 1200cc four-cylinder bikes were {{launched}} at the September 1990 Cologne Motorcycle Show. The motorcycles used famous model names from {{the glory days}} of Meriden Triumph and were first made available to the public between March (Trophy 1200 being the first) and September 1991. All used a modular liquid-cooled DOHC engine design in a common large diameter steel <b>backbone</b> <b>frame.</b> The modular design was to ensure that a variety of models could be offered whilst keeping production costs under control—an idea originally put forward, in air-cooled form, in the early 1970s by Bert Hopwood but not implemented by the then BSA-Triumph company.|$|E
50|$|From 1974 through 2004, the YZ 125 had {{a single}} <b>backbone</b> <b>frame</b> made from steel. It {{generally}} averaged from 176 to 198 lb. For the 2005 year, however, Yamaha switched to a single <b>backbone</b> <b>frame</b> constructed from an aluminum alloy. This frame material change dropped the weight to 190 lb.(dry weight) For 2008 models, additional weight savings in the wheel assemblies and front fork suspension have yielded additional weight savings making wet weight, no gas sub-200 lb. Aluminum framed YZ125's are notably 'flickable' and sometimes this trait {{is seen as a}} drawback since they tend to become more difficult to control on rough surfaces.|$|E
5000|$|By 1907, Rover had {{discontinued}} the <b>backbone</b> <b>frame</b> and {{was using}} an ash chassis with steel flitch plates. [...] Robert Jefferson and Robert Weallas drove a Rover 8 from Coventry to Istanbul, {{becoming the first}} people to cross Europe in an automobile.|$|E
50|$|In 1966, Dick {{designed}} and fabricated a large diameter <b>backbone</b> Chromoly <b>frame</b> for his BSA A65. Elements of its geometry became {{the hallmark of}} several of his designs.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, racing {{motorcycles}} still used steel-tubed frames {{developed in the}} 1950s. As motorcycle engine and tire technology progressed, motorcycle frames {{became more and more}} stressed. In 1982, Cobas developed a stronger and lighter aluminum twin-beam chassis to replace the steel <b>backbone</b> <b>frames.</b> The technology was copied by major motorcycle manufacturers and by the 1990s, all the major racing teams in Grand Prix competition used the aluminum frame design pioneered by Cobas.Cobas began constructing racing motorcycles named Sirokas in 1978, which were successful in the Spanish road race national championships. In 1982, he created the Kobas brand motorcycle designing his own chassis powered by Rotax engines. Spanish rider Sito Pons rode a Kobas to a third place at the 1982 Finnish Grand Prix and followed that with a fourth place at the Czechoslovakian Grand Prix. The following year, Carlos Cardús won the 250cc European Championship riding a Kobas.|$|R
50|$|Since its {{introduction}} in 1974, the YZ250 {{has had a}} single <b>backbone</b> steel <b>frame.</b> For the 2005 model year, however, the YZ250 has a new frame made entirely from aluminum, which brought the dry weight down to 212 lb, and more recently in 2010, to 211 lb. The bike has a swingarm rear suspension system {{with more than a}} foot of travel, as well as telescopic inverted forks with 11.8 in of travel. Front and rear hydraulic disc brakes round out the YZ.|$|R
50|$|A steel, square-tube <b>backbone</b> <b>frame</b> {{supports}} the stressed member engine. In front, a cartridge fork (adjustable beginning in 2004) guides the wheel, while a single Showa shock, adjustable only for preload (and rebound damping beginning in 2004) connects with the aluminum swingarm and carries the weight in back. Its brakes are dual-disc {{in the front}} and single-disc in the rear.|$|E
50|$|The XV920R had {{a unique}} {{enclosed}} chain final drive, a large, 8 in headlamp, a high-capacity sculpted fuel tank, and rear-set controls and footpegs. Like the Virago, {{it had a}} stamped-steel <b>backbone</b> <b>frame,</b> also serving {{as part of the}} air-induction system. It had a mono-shock rear suspension, with (air) preload and damper adjustments. The front suspension had air preload adjustment only.|$|E
50|$|The YZ450F {{received}} a major update in 2006, with over 300 parts changed and improved. The power was smoothed out, and the bike was made easier to ride, putting {{to rest the}} complaint that the YZ had too much power. The transmission was returned to a more traditional five-speed. An all-new aluminum single <b>backbone</b> <b>frame</b> shaved another 10 pounds off the weight.|$|E
40|$|We {{inspect the}} {{geometry}} of proteins by identifying their <b>backbones</b> as <b>framed</b> polygons. We find that the left-handed helix region of the Ramachandran map for non-glycyl residues corresponds to an isolated and highly localized sector in {{the orientation of the}} C_β carbons, when viewed in a Frenet frame that is centered at the corresponding C_α carbons. We show that this localization in the orientation persists to C_γ and C_δ carbons. Furthermore, when we extend our analysis to the neighboring residues we conclude that the left-handed helix region reflects a very regular and apparently residue independent collective interplay of at least seven consecutive amino acids.

50|$|For 1980 the IT175G {{caught up}} with the pace of motocross {{development}} and shared the frame of the YZ125G. This allowed the rear shock to move to a laid down position, bolted {{to the top of the}} <b>frame</b> <b>backbone.</b> The shock itself was adjustable for preload and rebound and a box section aluminum swing arm was used for the first time along with 36mm forks with air caps.|$|R
50|$|The Europa Series 2, or Lotus Type 54, was {{introduced}} in April 1968 (approximately chassis number 0645 onwards). The S2 used the same 1470cc Renault engine and mechanical components as the earlier Series 1, but added {{a number of key}} refinements including opening electric windows, adjustable seats, a new fully carpeted interior and a polished wooden fascia panel for the dashboard. The most significant change was the switch from fully-bonded construction to the use of bolt fasteners to attach the fibreglass body to the <b>backbone</b> steel <b>frame.</b> While reducing the torsional and flexural stiffneses somewhat, the use of a separable body was welcomed by the automotive insurance industry as it greatly reduced the complexity and cost of making repairs to the vehicle.|$|R
50|$|It has a 4-2-4 exhaust system. The Z1000 uses a <b>backbone</b> <b>frame</b> that {{supports}} the engine as a stressed member. Engine mounts can be removed to ease access for maintenance. Compression damping is done on one fork leg, rebound damping on the other. This technology is from dirt bikes, and is rare on street motorcycles. The Nissin brakes have four piston calipers.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{structural}} feature of Tatra trucks {{is the central}} load carrying tube, also called a <b>backbone</b> <b>frame.</b> All {{other parts of the}} truck are mounted to this rigid assembly. The inherently high torsional and flexural rigidity of this layout protects superstructures from the motions and forces on the axles. Torque distribution to the axles is also carried within the backbone.|$|E
50|$|This is a {{modification}} of the perimeter frame, or of the <b>backbone</b> <b>frame,</b> in which the passenger compartment floor, and sometimes also the luggage compartment floor have been integrated into the frame as loadbearing parts, for extra strength and rigidity. Neither floor pieces are simply sheet metal straight off the roll, but have been stamped with ridges and hollows for extra strength.|$|E
50|$|The chassis was {{inspired}} by Lotus's Elan. The 1.3 L (later replaced with a 1.4 L) and 1.6 L engines were Ford CVH units, front mounted driving the rear wheels through a four-speed gearbox on the 1300 and 1400, and a five-speed gearbox with the 1600. The suspension was independent all round using coil springs with semi trailing arms at the rear. The body panels were made of polyurethane or glass reinforced polyester, fitted to a semi-space <b>frame</b> <b>backbone</b> chassis. The panels were designed to be easily removed and replaced to repair accident damage. A removable hard top was available as an option.|$|R
40|$|The current pathogen-typing {{methods have}} {{suboptimal}} sensitivities and specificities. DNA sequencing offers {{an opportunity to}} type pathogens with greater degrees of discrimination using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) than with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and other methodologies. In a recent cluster of Escherichia coliO 157 :H 7 infections attributed to salad bar exposures and romaine lettuce, a subset of cases denied exposure to either source, although PFGE andmultiple-locus vari-able-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) suggested that all isolates had the same recent progenitor. Interrogation of a pre-selected set of 3, 442, 673 nucleotides in <b>backbone</b> open reading <b>frames</b> (ORFs) identified only 1 or 2 single nucleotide difference...|$|R
2500|$|The {{construction}} of Olympic and Titanic took place virtually in parallel, with Olympics keel laid down first on 16 December 1908 and Titanics on 31 March 1909. Both ships took about 26 months {{to build and}} followed much the same construction process. They were designed essentially as an enormous floating box girder, with the keel acting as a <b>backbone</b> and the <b>frames</b> of the hull forming the ribs. At {{the base of the}} ships, a double bottom [...] deep supported 300 frames, each between [...] and [...] apart and measuring up to about [...] long. They terminated at the bridge deck (B Deck) and were covered with steel plates which formed the outer skin of the ships.|$|R
50|$|In most respects, the MT-07 is a {{conventional}} middleweight roadster. It uses a compact tubular <b>backbone</b> <b>frame,</b> albeit with some echoes of a trellis frame. Its rear monoshock unit is placed horizontally within the subframe {{to give a}} shorter wheelbase, to save weight and to lower the centre of gravity. Front forks are conventional telescopic items, whereas its 3-cylinder sibling, the MT-09, has USD forks. Anti-lock braking is available as an option.|$|E
5000|$|The 3/20 {{was larger}} than the 3/15, with an 84.6 in {{wheelbase}} and a body 3 in lower than the 3/15. The 3/20 used a <b>backbone</b> <b>frame</b> unrelated to the 3/15's Austin Seven [...] "A" [...] frame. It inherited the 3/15 DA-4's independent front suspension and added a swing axle independent rear suspension, using a transverse leaf spring {{similar to that used}} at the front. The standard bodies for the car were built by Daimler-Benz in Sindelfingen.|$|E
5000|$|The All-Steel was an {{automobile}} {{produced by the}} All-Steel Motor Car Co. of St. Louis from 1915 to 1916. Also known as the Alstel, it had a rather conventional 4-cylinder engine, but had a unique narrow platform <b>backbone</b> <b>frame</b> that enclosed the propeller shaft and gearbox. The body, electrically welded, {{was attached to the}} frame and rear axle at a mere three points, and as such, the body was easily removed. It cost a mere $465.|$|E
40|$|As {{the field}} of {{computer}} networking has evolved, so too has {{the use of these}} networks. Modern networks must be capable of performing more than simple data transfer. To be of value, a network must be able to handle the convergence of different types of traffic: voice, video, and data; and the Quality of Service requirements associated with each type. This thesis performs a detailed analysis of the different types of traffic, the two primary transmission media, fiber optical and copper based connections, and the connection-orientation technology to route the traffic. Presented in this thesis is a fiber-based hybrid network consisting of Asynchronous Transfer Mode at the <b>backbone</b> layer and <b>Frame</b> Relay and Passive Optical Networking at the local access layer. The proposed Universal Traffic Network, based on present-day technology, is a viable solution to the challenge imposed by the convergence of different traffic types. U. S. Navy (U. S.

40|$|This report {{documents}} {{the activities and}} results of Phase I of the Evaluation of Broadband Networking Technologies project for Sprint. The two primary purposes of Phase I were to develop a base of general simulation models for studying broadband networks and to obtain head-to-head performance comparisons for several technology configurations with integrated traffic mixes. The technologies under consideration were Frame Relay,Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), and IEEE 802. 6. Both Frame Relay and ATM are switch-based technologies that differ in their data unit sizes ("large" and variable for Frame Relay, "small" and fixed for ATM), intended transmission rates (45 Mb/s {{is seen as an}} upper bound for Frame Relay and a lower bound for ATM), and other protocol details. IEEE 802. 6 is also known as Distributed Queue Dual Bus (DQDB) and is the basis for a service called Switched Multimegabit Data Service (SMDS) offered by local exchange carriers. The 802. 6 definition includes provisions for integrated traffic (voice, data, etc), whereas SMDS is defined as a data-only service. In the context of the present study,the term " 802. 6 " is more appropriate. This report assumes basic familiarity with these technologies. This study recognized that the technology used on network access links could very well be different from the technology used on the backbone network trunks. Four access/backbone combinations (listed in Table 1) were evaluated in Phase I. We will refer to these combinations as Frame Relay/ATM, ATM/ATM, pure 802. 6, and 802. 6 /Frame Relay. TABLE 1.

5000|$|The {{major changes}} {{were in the}} frame, engine, swingarm, and a-arms. The most visible change is in the frame {{right in front of}} the {{cylinder}} the 85-86 frame has a single down bar, but the '87+ has a single wishbone down-tube. The 85-86 exhaust goes out the side of the cylinder and the '87+ goes straight out the front in between the split downbar, hence the head pipe design changed for '87+. For '87+, a head motor mount was added and connects the engine to the <b>backbone</b> of the <b>frame</b> (under tank). The 85-86 is also a non powervalved motor as the '87+ have powervalves (aka: [...] "poor man's turbo-charger"). The front shocks are also about 3" [...] longer than previous models. The air intake from the carburetor to the cylinder is in a 5 bolt pattern and larger than the other years providing more air flow. Hence, the 87's are desired by tuners and racers for the larger base air flow. The 1987-on LT250R and the LT250R's big brother, the LT500R or Quadzilla, used the 5-bolt intake design. Also the '87+ used a 6 speed transmission instead of the 5 speed used on the 85-86 models. The engine color was changed from silver used on the 85-86 models to blue for the '87+ models.|$|R
5000|$|Recumbent tandem trikes allow {{two people}} to ride in a {{recumbent}} position with an extra-strong <b>backbone</b> <b>frame</b> to hold the extra weight. Some allow the [...] "captain" [...] (the rider who steers) and [...] "stoker" [...] (the rider who only pedals) to pedal at different speeds. They are often made with couplers so the frames {{can be broken down}} into pieces for easier transport. Manufacturers of recumbent trikes include Greenspeed, WhizWheelz and Inspired Cycle Engineering (ICE).|$|E
5000|$|The Honda CD175 is a [...] {{motorcycle}} {{made from}} 1967 to 1979 by the Honda Motor Company. Described by Honda as a [...] "great new all-rounder, at home around town or putting the highway behind you", {{it was the}} touring model in Honda's 175 cc motorcycle lineup that also included the sportier CB175 and the off road CL175 version. The CD175 shared some components and design elements in common with other models from Honda including the early-model pressed steel <b>backbone</b> <b>frame,</b> sometimes known as [...] "T bone".|$|E
50|$|It is {{generally}} {{characterized as a}} fully faired sibling of the Z1000 streetfighter, sharing the same 1,043cc liquid-cooled, electronic fuel-injected, 16-valve four-stroke inline-four engine and aluminum twin-tube <b>backbone</b> <b>frame,</b> but with ergonomics, storage, larger fuel tank and other design elements more oriented to the sport touring market. The Ninja 1000 is also strangely fitted with an electronic speed limiter,not because {{it is capable of}} exceeding the 300 km/h (186 mph) agreed to in the gentlemen's agreement but apparently to keep its top speed the same as the unfaired and unlimited Z1000.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{hippocampus}} {{is essential}} for declarative memory synthesis and is a core pathological substrate for Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common aging-related dementing disease. Acute increases in plasma cortisol are associated with transient hippocampal inhibition and retrograde amnesia, while chronic cortisol elevation is associated with hippocampal atrophy. Thus, cortisol levels could be monitored and managed in older people, to decrease their risk of AD type hippocampal dysfunction. We generated an in silico model of the chronic effects of elevated plasma cortisol on hippocampal activity and atrophy, using the systems biology mark-up language (SBML). We further challenged the model with biologically based interventions to ascertain if cortisol associated hippocampal dysfunction could be abrogated. Results The in silico SBML model reflected the in vivo aging of the hippocampus and increased plasma cortisol and negative feedback to the hypothalamic pituitary axis. Aging induced a 12 % decrease in hippocampus activity (HA), increased to 30 % by acute and 40 % by chronic elevations in cortisol. The biological intervention attenuated the cortisol associated decrease in HA by 2 % in the acute cortisol simulation and by 8 % in the chronic simulation. Conclusion Both acute and chronic elevations in cortisol secretion increased aging-associated hippocampal atrophy {{and a loss of}} HA in the model. We suggest that this first SMBL model, in tandem with in vitro and in vivo studies, may provide a <b>backbone</b> to further <b>frame</b> computational cortisol and brain aging models, which may help predict aging-related brain changes in vulnerable older people. </p...|$|R
40|$|Processing dye-sensitized {{solar cells}} gains more and more {{importance}} as interest in industrial applications grows daily. For large-scale processing and optimizing manufacturing in terms of environmental acceptability as well as time and material saving, a detailed knowledge of certain process steps is crucial. In this paper we concentrate on the sensitizing step of production, i. e., the anchoring of the dye molecules onto the TiO 2 semiconductor. A vacuum-tight attentuated total reflection infrared (ATR-IR) flow-through cell was developed, thus allowing measurements using a vacuum spectrometer to monitor infiltration of dye molecules into the porous TiO 2 film in situ at high sensitivity. In particular, {{the influence of the}} anchor and backbone of perylene dye molecules as well as the influence of solvents on the adsorption process was investigated. The experiments clearly show that an anhydride group reacts much slower than an acid group. A significantly lower amount of anhydride dye can be adsorbed on the films. Ex situ transmission experiments furthermore indicate that the availability of OH groups on the TiO 2 surface may limit dye adsorption. Also the <b>backbone</b> and base <b>frame</b> of the dye can influence the adsorption time drastically. Electrical cell characteristics correlate with the amount of adsorbed dye molecules determined by in situ ATR-IR measurements. The latter is also sensitive toward the diffusion of the dye through the porous layer. To gain {{a deeper understanding of the}} interplay between diffusion and adsorption, simulations were performed that allowed us to extract diffusion and adsorption constants. Again it was demonstrated that the anchoring group has a strong effect on the adsorption rate. The influence of the solvent was also studied, and it was found that both adsorption and desorption are affected by the solvent. Protic polar solvents are able to remove bound dye molecules, which is a possible pathway of cell degradation. Most importantly, the analysis shows the potential of this approach for the evaluation of molecules or additives concerning their characteristics important for cell processing...|$|R
5000|$|The Panhard CD {{inherited}} its Grand Touring coupé {{body with}} distinctive tapering rear and [...] "double-bubble" [...] roof from the CD Dyna. The lightweight body {{was made of}} fibreglass, which lent itself to the curvy shape and the economies of a small production run of vehicles. Deutsch and Romani had sculpted a form that was extremely aerodynamic, with a drag coefficient (...) of 0.22. The body was mounted on a torsionally-rigid central <b>backbone</b> <b>frame</b> that followed the pattern set by earlier DB designs. The complete chassis weighed 40 kg. The front bodywork was a single piece that tilted up and back to expose the front chassis and entire drive-train.|$|E

50|$|Early Speed Triples {{were all}} carbureted, and were {{designated}} T300 series bikes (Technically, T309). 1994/1995 models {{came with the}} standard 885 cc water-cooled engine and a rugged five-speed transmission. Subsequent Speed Triples all had the same engine with six speed transmissions, except for the brief run of 750 cc bikes. As with all the modular Triumphs, the T309 series Speed Triple had a very large single steel tube <b>backbone</b> <b>frame,</b> and used the engine as a stressed member. Forks were 43mm multi-adjustable Kayaba units and the same Japanese firm's shock could be set for preload and rebound damping. Kayaba (now known as KYB) had had a special relationship with Hinckley Triumph from its earliest days.At the rear was a single monoshock with a progressive linkage, and at the front were standard hydraulic forks fitted with dual disk brakes.|$|E
50|$|Tatra {{differentials}} are {{a unique}} design that uses two opposing {{spiral bevel gears}} {{instead of the usual}} single set. The differential gears are part of the input drive shaft rather than between the output axles as in a conventional differential. All versions of the Tatra differential have locking pins that can force the differential gears to rotate together, “locking” the differential. This arrangement had two distinct advantages. The first is that the dual output bevel gears allow the axles to swing around the drive axle without the need for universal couplings. The second is that the input drive shaft goes essentially straight through the differential housing, allowing simple coupling to a second set of swing axles. This modular design enables configurations of 2, 3, 4, 5, or even 6 axles with all axles driven. The whole assembly is part of the <b>backbone</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|E
50|$|The 499 cc single-cylinder, high-camshaft OHV, {{air-cooled}} Vincent engine had a {{light alloy}} barrel and cylinder {{head with a}} cast-iron liner, and a 'backbone' type combined frame and oil tank. The engine acting as a stressed member of the frame, and most other components {{in common with the}} post-war twin-cylinder models. Unlike the twins, it had a Burman BAP four-speed gearbox held by a vertical piece of cast aluminium, which mated with the <b>backbone</b> <b>frame</b> that it shared with the twin models. At the time and to this day some members of the motorcycling fraternity quipped that it was really only 'half of' the desirable Rapide twin-cylinder model, although in fact the specification had more in common with the higher performance Black Shadow twin-cylinder model, sharing compression ratio (7.3:1) and the larger carburettor. Unlike the Black Shadow however, it did not have polished internals nor was it selectively assembled. All Comet models had both front (Vincent Girdraulic forks) and rear suspension with damping {{at a time when most}} manufacturers had only front suspension.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1930s Tatra engineers, under the {{direction}} of Hans Ledwinka's son Erich and design engineer Erich Übelacker, started work on the development of a small people's car with a rear-mounted engine in a <b>backbone</b> <b>frame.</b> Ledwinka believed that a rear-mounted engine RR layout would bring with it several big advantages [...] - [...] i.e. reducing the efficiency loss, noise and vibration of the driveshaft of the FR layout. No driveshaft meant there would be a flat floor with no need for central floor tunnel so that the passengers' seating position would be lower and well forward of the rear axle, which would lead to a lower centre of gravity, more favourable inter-axle weight distribution, and lower overall height. Mounting the engine in the rear would mean shortening the front part of the body to make a longer tail possible, which was consistent with the laws of aerodynamics. Also, engine noise would not disturb the passengers and would not be heard when driving at a speed of over 50 km/h. Air-cooling would be simpler and more effective at coping with the extremes of temperatures during the depths of winter and height of summer, than water cooling systems of the time, considering the climate in Central-Europe. As the company was considering starting to manufacturing aeroplanes, it got experience with laws of aerodynamics and decided to apply them for the prospective car.|$|E
