5000|$|Tolerances for {{the profile}} symbols are equal {{bilateral}} unless otherwise specified, {{and for the}} position symbol tolerances are always equal bilateral. For example, {{the position of a}} hole has a tolerance of [...]020 inches. This means the hole can move +/- [...]010 inches, which is an equal <b>bilateral</b> <b>tolerance.</b> It does not mean the hole can move +.015/-.005 inches, which is an unequal <b>bilateral</b> <b>tolerance.</b> Unequal bilateral and unilateral tolerances for profile are specified by adding further information to clearly show this is what is required.|$|E
30|$|A 61 -year-old woman {{visited her}} primary care doctor because of general malaise, face edema, skin pigmentation, insomnia, and polyuria. Blood {{examination}} revealed marked hypokalemia and impaired glucose <b>tolerance.</b> <b>Bilateral</b> adrenal enlargement was observed on abdominal ultrasonography, {{and she was}} referred to our hospital for further examination. Endocrine examination showed both elevated plasma cortisol (107.7  pg/mL) and ACTH levels (1100  pg/mL), and increased urinary excretion of free cortisol (6650 mcg/day) and 17 -ketogenic steroids (78.7  mg/day). Plasma cortisol and ACTH levels were elevated without any diurnal rhythm. Plasma cortisol was not suppressed by the overnight 8 -mg dexamethasone suppression test. There was no response of plasma ACTH or cortisol to exogenous corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). Other hormones of the pituitary, thyroid, and adrenal medulla were all in normal ranges. Thus, ectopic ACTH syndrome was strongly suggested.|$|R
40|$|The loss of {{dopamine}} neurons {{observed in}} Parkinson’s disease (PD) elicits severe motor control deficits which are {{reduced by the}} use of dopamine agonists. However, recent works have indicated that D 3 -preferential agonists such as pramipexole can induce impulse control disorders such as food craving or compulsive eating. In the present study, we performed an intermittent daily feeding experiment to assess the effect of chronic treatment by pramipexole and VTA <b>bilateral</b> lesion on <b>tolerance</b> for sucrose solution. The impact of such chronic treatment on spontaneous locomotion and spatial memory was also examined. Changes in sucrose tolerance could indicate the potential development of a change in food compulsion or addiction related to the action of pramipexole. Neither the bilateral lesion of the VTA nor chronic treatment with pramipexole altered the spontaneous locomotion or spatial memory in rats. Rats without pramipexole treatment quickly developed a stable intake of sucrose solution in the 12 h access phase. On the contrary, when under daily pramipexole treatment, rats developed a stronger and ongoing escalation of their sucrose solution intakes. In addition, we noted that the change in sucrose consumption was sustained by an increase of the expression of the dopamine 3 receptor in the core and the shell regions of the nucleus accumbens. The present results may suggest that long term stimulation of the dopamine 3 receptor in animals induces a strong increase in sucrose consumption, indicating an effect of this receptor on certain pathological aspects of food eating...|$|R
