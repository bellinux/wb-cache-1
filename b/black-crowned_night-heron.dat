5000|$|Well {{established}} rookeries {{are found}} {{on two of}} the island's lagoons, where <b>black-crowned</b> <b>night-herons,</b> great egrets, and great blue herons nest and raise their young. Osprey and bald eagles also nest on the island; and although there is not a wood stork rookery on Callawassie Island, significant numbers of this formerly endangered species have made the island their home. Other bird species known to frequent the island include: doves (Zenaidura carolinensis), quail (Colinus virginianus), crows (Corvus sp.), and vultures (Carthes aura). Marshes provide a habitat for marine oriented species including terns, gulls, sandpipers [...] ), loons and ibis.|$|R

5000|$|McCormick Island {{regularly}} supports {{thousands of}} waterfowl during the migratory season, {{such as the}} common loon, horned grebe, red-breasted merganser, lesser scaup, and bufflehead. [...] McCormick Island also represents the highest concentration of wading birds in Pennsylvania during the breeding season including the great egret, yellow-crowned night-heron and <b>black-crowned</b> <b>night-heron.</b> The island also provides important breeding habitat for the <b>black-crowned</b> <b>night-heron,</b> which is classified as a candidate- at risk species in Pennsylvania and under consideration for Pennsylvania endangered species status. Thus McCormick Island is declared an Important Bird Area (IBA) by The National Audubon Society. Any disturbance on the island could possibly impact the bird habitat. McCormick Island provides a great avian habitat because of the forested wetland complex and shallow foraging areas, and open water. Typically, the main birds spotted on McCormick Island are: great blue heron, green back heron, black-crown night heron, egrets, and bald eagles. Non avian species documented on the island include river otter, beaver, muskrat, snapping turtle, yellow-bellied slider turtle, map turtle and water snake. American toad populations are abundant on the islands.|$|E
40|$|Birds {{belonging}} to the orders Ciconiiformes and Phoenicopteriformes are common inmates of zoological gardens. There are 12 species of the order Ciconiiformes and 1 species of the order Phoenicopteriformes bred in the Ohrada Zoo. All these species bred in the zoo {{are found in the}} Old World chiefly. The successful breeding of mentioned species depends on detailed knowledge of their biology and on providing appropriate breeding conditions. This thesis is an effort for complete analysis of the history and the present of breeding mentioned species in the Ohrada Zoo. The main aim of this thesis was to evaluate the success of nesting of birds mentioned orders in relation to breeding conditions in the zoo according to all available data processing; and to evaluate the success of nesting season of the year 2012 according to watching nesting of the birds in mentioned year. The own watching was carried out since 9 th April to 30 th June 2012. There are 6 species in this zoo which breed successfully regularly: the Cattle Egret (Bubulcus ibis), the Little Egret (Egretta garzetta), the <b>Black-crown</b> <b>Night-heron</b> (Nycticorax nycticorax), the Glossy Ibis (Plegadis falcinellus), the Eurasian Spoonbill (Platalea leucorodia) and the Greater Flamingo (Phoenicopterus ruber roseus). One species ? the Black Stork (Ciconia nigra) bred {{for the very first time}} in this zoo in 2012. Especially successful is the Greater Flamingo breeding in the Ohrada Zoo. The Eurasian Spoonbill, The <b>Black-crown</b> <b>Night-heron,</b> the Glossy Ibis and the Cattle Egret breeding is successful in relation to breeding conditions in this zoo, too. The nesting season of the year 2012 was exceptionally successful for the Cattle Egrets, the Eurasian Spoonbills and the Glossy Ibises, on the contrary this nesting season was not very successful for the Little Egrets...|$|R

40|$|The NYSDEC adopted {{management}} objectives {{based on}} recommendations {{made by the}} Task Force. In 1994, a United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) depredation permit was obtained to remove cormorant nests to reduce impacts to nesting <b>Black-crowned</b> <b>Night-Herons</b> Nycticorax nycticorax on Gull Island and to protect private property interests on Bass Island. NYSDEC has annually renewed its authority for nest removal on Bass and Gull Islands. In 1999, NYSDEC developed a comprehensive fish and wildlife management plan for the eastern basin of Lake Ontario (NYSDEC 2000). The USFWS depreda-tion permit was amended accordingly, authorizing cor-morant reproductive suppression on Little Galloo Island to protect waterbird diversity. Beginning 6 May 1999, all accessible cormorant nests on Little Galloo Island were coated with vegetable oil at two-week intervals to prevent hatching. The egg oiling program was also con-ducted in 2000. Impacts associated with cormorant man-agement on the three islands was assessed in both years.

50|$|The park's {{location}} on Lake Ontario {{makes it a}} perfect stop over for migrating birds along the Michigan Flyway. For this reason is it also an important location for viewing migrating birds and monarch butterflies. The park's long beaches make it particularly appealing to migrating shorebirds. Limestone islands near the park area support large nesting colonies of double-crested cormorants, Caspian and common terns, several gull species, great blue herons, great egrets, and <b>black-crowned</b> <b>night-herons.</b> In early spring, Presqu'ile Bay is an important staging area for thousands of migrating waterfowl. The park also includes a large marsh which provides nesting habitat for rails, bitterns and other wetland birds. There are also forested areas and open fields: {{a wide variety of}} habitats in a relatively small park. There is also a fairly substantial population of white-tailed deer, whose grazing is doing significant damage to native plants in general, and to tree regeneration in particular. Presqu'ile has been identified as a Canadian Important Bird Area. In all this small park has seven distinct ecosystems.|$|R
40|$|The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation {{initiated}} a Double-crested Cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) control {{program in the}} eastern basin of Lake Ontario to mitigate cormorant impacts in 1999. Key objectives included {{improving the quality of}} Smallmouth Bass (Micropterus dolomieu) and other fisheries, restoring the structure and function of the warmwater fish community and reducing cormorant impacts to nesting habitats of other colonial waterbird species. In eight years of intensive control, cormorant numbers declined, with a corresponding reduction in estimated fish consumption. Diversity and numbers of co-occurring waterbirds either increased or have not been shown to be negatively impacted by management. Woody vegetation favorable to <b>Black-crowned</b> <b>Night-Herons</b> (Nycticorax nycticorax) has been maintained. A ca. 2. 5 -fold increase in the abundance of Smallmouth Bass abundance in assessment nets over the last seven years is a sign of improved recruitment to the fishery. Since the target population level of 4, 500 to 6, 000 cormorants has essentially been achieved, the eastern Lake Ontario cormorant program is expected to shift in 2007 from a population reduction focus towards a less intensive program intended to prevent population resurgence...|$|R

40|$|In northwestern Italy, {{traditional}} {{rice cultivation}} using permanent flooding {{has been replaced}} by cultivation that uses a reduced water depth and a shortened submersion period. Prey availability for the numerous herons and egrets using this intensive rice cultivation region changed as well, with a diminution of amphibians and an increase of crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) and oriental weatherfish (Misgurnus anguillicaudatus). The prey intake in 2014 was compared with data available for 1987 for the three most common species of waterbirds that forage in the paddies. Total biomass intake by Grey Herons (Ardea cinerea) feeding in the paddies decreased from 28 g dry mass/min in 1987 to 7 g in 2014, and by <b>Black-crowned</b> <b>Night-Herons</b> (Nycticorax nycticorax) from 8 g to 5 g, while the intake by Little Egrets (Egretta garzetta) remained similar (12 and 13 g in 1987 and 2014, respectively). The observed levels of prey intake allowed breeding Grey Herons to meet their energy needs by feeding exclusively in the rice paddies in 1987, but not in 2014. The other two study species could not meet their daily requirements for successful breeding by feeding in the paddies only, either in 1987 or 2014. Yet the three species bred successfully in the study area, and their reproductive output remained stable both in 1987 and 2014. Successful breeding was probable by the three species foraging in other habitats, such as rivers, small natural wetlands and irrigation canals, in the region...|$|R
40|$|Ospreys (Pandion haliaetus) winter {{throughout}} the country of Colombia. Recoveries of banded Ospreys indicate that many are shot {{in the country with}} the number increasing since the 1970 s. The increased incidence of shooting has coincided with the development of aquaculture facilities in Colom- bia that raise tilapia (Oreochromis spp.). Because these facilities typically lose production to birds such as Ospreys that depredate fish, we conducted a survey of 83 facilities in three states or departments in Colombia in 2001 to determine the species of birds that take fish at aquaculture facilities and the numbers that are killed each year. Our results showed that bird depredation occurs at aquaculture facilities {{throughout the}} country, but mostly in the southern portion of the country in the department of Huila. Facility managers reported shooting Ospreys in all three departments with as few as five individuals shot annually in Antioquia in northern Colombia to as many as 270 shot annually in Huila. In addition, facility managers reported shooting nine other species of birds including Green Kingfishers (Chloroceryle americana), Great Kiskadees (Pitangus sulphuratus), Snowy Egrets (Egretta thula), Great Egrets (Casmerodius allms), Olivaceous Cormorants (Phalacrocorax olivaceus), <b>Black-crowned</b> <b>Night-Herons</b> (Nyc- ticorax nycticorax), White-necked Herons (Ardea cocoi), Cattle Egrets (Bubulcus ibis), and Striated Herons (Butorides striatus), for a total estimate of 3 ̆e 9000 birds shot in the three departments annually. A number of alternative methods to shooting had been used to reduce losses to birds including the installation of netting, overhead wires, scarecrows, and noise making devices, but, neither these methods nor shooting, were effective in deterring avian predators...|$|R
40|$|Host {{selection}} by vector mosquitoes is {{a critical}} component of virus proliferation, particularly for viruses such as West Nile (WNV) that are transmitted enzootically to a variety of avian hosts, and tangentially to dead-end hosts such as humans. Culex tarsalis is a principal vector of WNV in rural areas of western North America. Based on previous work, Cx. tarsalis utilizes a variety of avian and mammalian hosts and tends to feed more frequently on mammals in the late summer than {{during the rest of the}} year. To further explore this and other temporal changes in host selection, bloodfed females were collected at a rural farmstead and heron nesting site in Northern California from May 2008 through May 2009, and bloodmeal hosts identified using either a microsphere-based array or by sequencing of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene. Host composition during summer was dominated by four species of nesting Ardeidae. In addition, the site was populated with various passerine species as well as domestic farm animals and humans. When present, Cx. tarsalis fed predominantly (. 80 %) upon the ardeids, with <b>Black-crowned</b> <b>Night-Herons,</b> a highly competent WNV host, the most prevalent summer host. As the ardeids fledged and left the area and mosquito abundance increased in late summer, Cx. tarsalis feeding shifted to include more mammals, primarily cattle, and a high diversity of avian species. In the winter, Yellow-billed Magpies and House Sparrows were the predominant hosts, and Yellow-billed Magpies and American Robins were fed upon more frequently than expected given their relative abundance. These data demonstrated that host selection was likely base...|$|R
50|$|The lake holds large {{populations of}} water birds and was {{designated}} as a Ramsar Site on August 26, 1998. Several threatened species such as the huge Titicaca water frog and the flightless Titicaca grebe are largely or entirely restricted to the lake, and the Titicaca orestias has likely become extinct (last seen in 1938) due to competition and predation by the introduced rainbow trout and the silverside Odontesthes bonariensis. In addition to the Titicaca orestias, native fish species in the lake's basin are other species of Orestias, and the catfish Trichomycterus dispar, T. rivulatus and Astroblepus stuebeli (the last species not in the lake itself, but in associated ecosystems). The many Orestias species in Lake Titicaca differ significantly in both habitat preference and feeding behavior. About 90% of the fish species in the basin are endemic, including 23 species of Orestias that only {{are found in the}} lake.

40|$|Canadian and U. S. federal {{wildlife}} agencies completed four decadal surveys, {{spanning the}} years 1977 to 2009, to census colonial waterbirds breeding on the Great Lakes and adjoining bodies of water. In this paper, we reports abundance, distribution, and general population trends of three species: <b>Black-crowned</b> <b>Night-Heron</b> (Nycticorax nycticorax), Great Egret (Ardea alba), and Great Blue Heron (Ardea herodias). Estimates of nest numbers ranged from approximately 4000 - 6100 for the <b>Black-crowned</b> <b>Night-Heron,</b> 250 - 1900 for the Great Egret, and 3800 - 6400 for the Great Blue Heron. Average annual rates {{of change in}} nest numbers between the first (1977) and fourth (2008) census were â' 1 % for the <b>Black-crowned</b> <b>Night-Heron,</b> + 23 % for the Great Egret, and â' 0. 27 % for the Great Blue Heron.

However, lethal control of birds at aquaculture facilities has raised concerns about the effects on the distribution and abundance of populations of the species killed. We {{examined the relationship between}} numbers of piscivorous birds reported killed under U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) permits at aquaculture facilities in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania and species population trends within the respective states. The USFWS issued 26 permits to 9 facilities from 1985 through September 1997. Eight species appeared on permits, but only six species were reported killed: <b>black-crowned</b> <b>night-herons</b> Nycticorax nycticorax, double-crested cormorants Phalacrocorax auritus, great blue herons Ardea herodias, herring gulls Larus argentatus, ring-billed gulls L. delawarensis, and mallards Anas platyrhynchos. Over 13 years, the authorized number of birds to be killed per species or group (e. g., gulls) ranged from 5 to 800 (mean = 240, SD = 300), whereas the reported number of birds killed per species or group (1985 - 1996) ranged from 0 to 289 (mean = 83, SD = 118). Across states and species, the number of birds authorized to be killed per permit ranged from 2 to 60 (mean = 27, SD = 20), whereas reported kills ranged from 0 to 45 (mean = 12, SD = 10).

40|$|We {{examined}} the nesting ecology of a Blackcrowned Night-Heron (Nycticorax nycticorax) colony located at wetlands associated with Lake Calumet in south Cook County, Illinois, during the 2002 and 2003 nesting seasons. This area of southeastern Chicago {{has been greatly}} impacted by heavy industry, solid and chemical waste disposal, urbanization, and altered hydrology. <b>Black-crowned</b> <b>Night-Herons</b> (BCNH) have nested at five known locations at Lake Calumet wetlands during 1984 ??? 2003. Emergent cover (giant reed, Phragmites australis) was of primary importance to this colony for nesting during that time. Cottonwoods (Populus deltoides) also were used for nesting from the late 1980 s to mid- 1990 s. During 1993 ??? 2003 the herons began arriving at the colony as early as March 10. During the two years of this study the earliest indications of nest building and courtship occurred {{during the first week}} in April; the first pairs and precopulatory displays were observed during second week of April in both years. The egg-laying period extended from April 20 to June 12 in 2002, and from April 16 to May 27 / 28 in 2003. Hatching occurred from mid-May to {{the first few days of}} July in 2002, and from mid-May to June 19 / 20 in 2003. Juvenile dispersal in 2002 occurred from mid-July through late August, and from early July through mid-August in 2003. Reproductive parameters in BCNH nesting at the north end of Indian Ridge Marsh (IRM), the primary nesting location for this colony in both years, were typical for this species. In 2002 the ???recruitment??? rate (number of young/nest surviving to 15 days) of 1. 74 young/pair was below the threshold of 2. 0 ??? 2. 1 young/nesting pair thought to be necessary to maintain BCNH populations. However, recruitment increased to 2. 22 young/ pair in 2003, which was among the highest previously reported. The most important cause of nest failure was poorly constructed (flat) nests which allowed the eggs to roll out into the water. Although some eggs were lost to gulls and some hatched young were taken by unknown mammalian or avian predators, predation was not an important cause of nest losses at IRM. published or submitted for publicationis peer reviewe...|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Eggs of geotropic cormorants (Phalacrocorax brasilianus), <b>black-crowned</b> <b>night-herons</b> (Nycticorax nycticorax) and great egrets (Ardea alba) were collected from a herons located in Alexander Island, near the Houston Ship Channel, in Galveston Bay. Eggs of geotropic cormorants were also taken from three additional islands in Galveston Bay, and from two locations outside the bay. Each egg was analyzed for persistent organochlorine pesticides (i. e. DDTS, chlorates, HCHs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Selected eggs were also analyzed for polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDD), and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDF) to determine differences and similarities in the accumulation of these contaminants among species, and to evaluate potential impacts on reproduction. A H 4 IIE rat hepatoma cell bioassay containing a luciferase reporter gene was conducted on selected extracts to determine TCDD- equivalents (TCDD-EQS) and compare these values with the toxic equivalents (TEQs) calculated from instrumental analysis. DDE concentrations were higher in eggs of geotropic cormorants from control locations outside the bay than inside the bay, possibly due to different regional sources. Predominant PCB congeners in the three species were 153, 138, 180, 118, 99, 187, and 170. These congeners comprised between 56 and 68 % of the total PCB load in the samples. Mean total PCB concentrations were higher in geotropic cormorant eggs from Alexander Island than in eggs from areas farther away from the Houston Ship Channel, including control areas outside the bay. PCB 126 was highest in eggs of geotropic cormorants from Vingt-et-un and Smith Point Islands within Galveston Bay. 2, 3, 7, 8 TCDD was the only dioxin detected in eggs from all locations within Galveston Bay. TEQ concentrations in eggs ranged from 67 pg/g at the control site to 452 pg/g at Alexander Island. TCDD-EQ concentrations were highest in eggs (437 pg/g and 413 pg/g, respectively) of cormorants from Vingt-et-un and Smith Point Islands. Overall, DDE, PCBs, 2, 3, 7, 8 TCDD, TEQ, and TCDD-EQ concentrations were below levels known to affect reproduction.

Hepatic microsomal activities of benzyloxyresorufin-O-dealkylase and ethoxyresorufin-O-dealkylase were significantly elevated (up to sixfold and ninefold induction, respectively) in pipping embryos from the Baltimore Harbor colony compared to the reference site, whereas values in embryos from the Rock Creek Park colony were intermediate. Concentrations of organochlorine pesticides and metabolites in pipping embryos from both sites in the Chesapeake watershed were greater than at the reference site but below the known threshold for reproductive impairment. However, concentrations of 10 arylhydrocarbon receptor-active polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners and estimated toxic equivalents were up to 37 -fold greater in embryos collected from these two sites in the Chesapeake Bay region, with values for toxic congeners 77 and 126 exceeding those observed in pipping heron embryos from the Great Lakes. Monooxygenase activity of pipping embryos was associated with concentrations of several organochlorine pesticides, total PCBs, arylhydrocarbon receptor-active PCB congeners, and toxic equivalents (r= 0. 30 – 0. 59), providing {{further evidence of the}} value of cytochrome P 450 as a biomarker of organic contaminant exposure. Organochlorine contaminant levels were greater in 10 -d-old nestlings from Baltimore Harbor than the reference site but had no apparent effect on monooxygenase activity or growth. These findings demonstrate induction of cytochrome P 450 in pipping <b>black-crowned</b> <b>night-heron</b> embryos in the Chesapeake Bay region, probably by exposure to PCB congeners of local origin, and the accumulation of organochlorine pesticides and metabolites in nestling herons from Baltimore Harbor. Biomonitoring with additional waterbird species (e. g., bald eagle, common tern, great blue heron) that appear to be more sensitive to PCBs than black-crowned night-herons is recommended to document health of waterbirds and remediation of the Chesapeake Bay...|$|E
40|$|Using the {{universal}} P 2 /P 8 primers, {{we were able}} to obtain the gene segments of chromo-helicase-DNA binding protein (CHD) -Z and CHD-W from ten species of ardeid birds including Chinese egret (Egretta eulophotes), little egret (E. garzetta), eastern reef egret (E. sacra), great egret (Ardea alba), grey heron (A. cinerea), Chinese pond-heron (Ardeola bacchus), cattle egret (Bubulcus ibis), <b>black-crowned</b> <b>night-heron</b> (Nycticorax nycticorax), cinnamon bittern (Ixobrychus cinnamomeus) and yellow bittern (I. sinensis). Based on conserved regions inside the P 2 /P 8 -derived sequences, we designed new PCR primers for sex identification in these ardeid species. Using agarose gel electrophoresis, the PCR products showed two bands for females (140 bp derived from CHD-W and the other 250 bp from CHD-ZW), whereas the males showed only the 250 bp band. The results indicated that our new primers could be used for accurate and convenient sex identification in ardeid species.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Wildlife Management, 1992 Waterbird use {{and aquatic}} {{vegetation}} were studied during seven seasons and in five units representing three water types at Arcata Marsh and Wildlife Sanctuary (AMWS), 1 July 1990 - 30 June 1991. Dominant vegetation types were cover-mapped and sampled for species composition, biomass, and stem density. The PH, salinity, turbidity, and water depth measurements also were taken at appropriate vegetation plots. The five study units represented, a saline basin (Klopp Lake) {{filled with water}} from Humboldt Bay, a freshwater unit (Butcher Slough Log Pond, BSLP) filled with well water; and three freshwater units filled with treated domestic wastewater effluent. The PH was greatest in the units in late spring except BSLP where it was highest in late fall. Salinity was greatest in Klopp Lake in mid fall. All four freshwater units had salinities of less than one ppt. The BSLP was significantly less (p< 0. 05) turbid than the wastewater units from late fall through summer. Dominant vegetation types included marsh pennywort (Hydrocotyle ranunculoides), lesser duckweed (Lemna minor), broad-leaved cattail (Typha latifolia), hard-stemmed bulrush (Scirpus acutus), and sago pondweed (Potamogeton pectinatus). Marsh pennywort and lesser duckweed also commonly occurred as understory species in the emergent cover types. Mean stem densities of broad-leaved cattail and hard-stemmed bulrush were greatest in summer and were greater in the wastewater units (p< 0. 05) than in BSLP. Biomass of sago pondweed was greatest in all freshwater units during mid fall. BSLP maintained submergent beds later into the fall than the wastewater units. The wastewater units developed heavy mats of lesser duckweed over most of their surfaces in the fall. Coverage of marsh pennywort mats peaked in early fall in Gearheart Marsh and BSLP and in summer in Allen and Hauser Marshes. Ninety-four species of birds were recorded. There was an annual total of 768, 586 bird use-days on the five units. Almost 1 / 3 of the annual bird use-days occurred during late fall. Shorebirds (58. 1 percent) and waterfowl, coots and rails (35. 2 percent) accounted for 93. 3 percent of annual bird use-days. Lowest bird use occurred in summer. Bird densities were greatest on Klopp Lake for diving ducks, large and small shorebirds, gulls, and terns. Based on relative area use, great blue herons (Ardea herodias) and ospreys (Pandion haliaetus) used Klopp Lake at greater than expected rates. BSLP and Allen, Gearheart, and Hauser units had similar patterns of annual bird use. Densities were greatest on these units for herons, egrets, puddle ducks, coots, rails and raptors. Annually, fish-eating divers, represented mostly by some resident pied-billed grebes (Podilymbus podiceps) used BSLP more than either Klopp Lake or the wastewater units. <b>Black-crowned</b> <b>night-herons</b> (Nycticorax nycticorax) used BSLP at more than twice expected rates but other herons used BSLP at less than expected rates. Cinnamon teal (Anas cyanoptera) and mallards (A. platyrhynchos) were most common on BSLP. The wastewater units were used at or more than 1. 5 times than expected rates by herons, all puddle ducks, dowitchers (Limnodromus spp.), and Bonaparte's gulls (Larus philadelphia). The lesser scaup (Avthya affinis) was the only diving duck present on the wastewater units at expected or greater than expected rates. American coots (Fulica americana) and rails used all four freshwater units at least 1. 5 times more than expected. Continued annual marsh pennywort removal is strongly recommended, and guidelines should be established to stop encroachment of emergent vegetation into open water and submergent beds. If possible, a freshwater source should be routed into Klopp Lake to reduce high salinities and to allow for possible introduction of additional aquatic vegetation into the water column. An alternative to freshwater would be to introduce eelgrass (Zostera marina) into Klopp Lake...|$|R
