25|$|As the {{likelihood}} of sea-based missile attacks from the Gulf of Mexico decreased, and with the low probability of missile attacks from the South, the United States Air Force decided to close the southern-facing PAVE PAWS sites at Robins Air Force Base and Eldorado, Texas. After closure in 1995 one radar face from Eldorado AFS, along with another from the closed Robins Air Force <b>Base</b> <b>site</b> were moved to Clear Air Force Station, Alaska {{as part of the}} BMEWS upgrade in 1998.|$|E
25|$|Northeast Cape Air Force Station, at the island's other end, was a United States Air Force {{facility}} {{consisting of}} an Aircraft Control and Warning (AC) radar site, a United States Air Force Security Service listening post; and a White Alice Communications System (WACS) site that operated from about 1952 to about 1972. The area surrounding the Northeast Cape <b>base</b> <b>site</b> {{had been a}} traditional camp site for several Yupik families for centuries. After the base closed down in the 1970s, {{many of these people}} started to experience health problems. Even today, people who grew up at Northeast Cape have high rates of cancer and other diseases, possibly due to PCB exposure around the site. According to the State of Alaska, those elevated cancer rates {{have been shown to be}} comparable to the rates of other Alaskan and non-Alaskan arctic natives who were not exposed to a similar Air Force facility. In any event, the majority of the facility was removed in a $10.5 million cleanup program in 2003. Monitoring of the site will continue into the future.|$|E
500|$|Halo Wars was {{originally}} not a Halo series title. Ensemble spent 12 to 18 months {{working on the}} control scheme, using the Age of Mythology engine. The development team hacked an Age of Mythology expansion, , and {{used it as a}} prototype for control experiments. Ensemble found that managing Age of Mythologys resources, units, and buildings was too difficult with the console's controller. [...] "The answer [...] is actually hidden in the question," [...] Jason Pace, Microsoft Game Studio's lead producer, told The New Zealand Herald. [...] "It's something we believe has held strategy games back from succeeding on the console: you can't effectively bring a PC-style strategy game to the console because the fundamental game mechanic is tied to the mouse and keyboard input devices. It's not a question of just changing the control scheme to be gamepad friendly—you need to adapt the underlying strategy mechanic to make sense with the new input device." [...] Senior designer Justin Rouse said that the team kept the controls from the research they had conducted, but scrapped the rest in favor of [...] "build from the floor up what we need: the basics, the core of a strategy game." [...] With the goal of making [...] "the first great strategy game on the console", Ensemble streamlined gameplay mechanics; the game's single resource is produced at each <b>base</b> <b>site,</b> which allows players to quickly cycle through their bases instead of micromanaging multiple resources at many locations.|$|E

40|$|Carbon {{adsorbents}} were {{chemically modified}} to have <b>base</b> <b>sites</b> on their surfaces, and the adsorption characteristics {{of carbon dioxide}} on them were investigated. Three kinds of carbon materials were used as support materials: two activated carbons and a carbon black. <b>Base</b> <b>sites</b> were introduced by impregnating the support materials with calcium acetate solution, followed by calcination at 700 degrees C for 2 hours in an inert gas flow. Chemical modification reduced the surface areas of adsorbents due to the blocking of micropores. Irreversible adsorption of carbon dioxide occurs up to 300 degrees C due to chemisorption. However, reversible adsorption was possible by pretreating adsorbents with carbon dioxide. Strong interaction between carbon dioxide and <b>base</b> <b>sites</b> enhanced adsorption of carbon dioxide at higher temperatures up to 250 degrees C. close 181...|$|R

2500|$|The Navy closed NTC {{facilities}} incrementally. As {{the military}} functions {{on the base}} dwindled, so did the Navy's budget. Fearing the lack of activity on the base would lead to security problems, the City and Navy entered into a master lease agreement in 1995 allowing the City interim use of [...] of the <b>base</b> <b>site.</b> The agreement was later amended to include {{more than half of}} the NTC property, with approximately 75 buildings occupied by interim users. These buildings were subleased from the City to various parties including film companies, nonprofit organizations, City departments and small businesses. In addition, interim leasing allowed the City to maintain the buildings and landscape areas at a higher standard of maintenance than an otherwise decreasing Navy caretaker budget could provide. The Navy officially closed NTC on 30 April 1997, and all military operations ceased.|$|E
2500|$|At first, the sod {{airfield}} was circular with planes {{taking off}} and landing into the wind, whichever direction {{that happened to}} be. [...] Beginning in 1944, Giebelstadt received a very long (3000m 9,100ft) paved runway aligned 08/26 slightly {{to the east and}} south of the original 1935 airfield. In addition, other upgrades to facilities were included in the plans for Giebelstadt to be used for jet interceptor aircraft operations such as additional aircraft dispersal sites, an expansion of the fuel dump and other facilities. [...] This in turn made a significant extension of the airfield. [...] With this construction, the expanded air <b>base</b> <b>site</b> was about 250ha in size. [...] Not only was the location of the airbase a closely held secret, the town name itself was banned from all maps of the region and can still be hard to find on some maps today. To hide the airfield from Allied reconnaissance aircraft, workers painted the runway to resemble a grassy field complete with fluffy white sheep.|$|E
