It states: [...] "Paul and Virginia are two young lovers who have grown up together from <b>babyhood.</b> Their widowed mothers lived near each other in rude cottages, on {{an island in the}} Indies, on which there are few inhabitants. Here the children are reared, knowing no play fellows but each other. When Virginia is 16 years of age, her mother receives a letter from a wealthy aunt in Paris, who offers to make Virginia her heir and give her a good education, providing Virginia will, in the future, make her aunt's home her own. Virginia's mother, having lost her own fortune through marrying against the will of her family, feels that she must not let her daughter suffer the poverty that she has been compelled to endure. She accordingly insists upon Virginia's acceptance of her wealthy relatives offer. Virginia thereupon sets sail for France, leaving Paul broken-hearted at her departure. Virginia tries to be a dutiful niece to her aunt, who is very old and sickly, although she longs to return to her humble home and Paul, whom she dearly loves. When, however, the aunt insists that she marry a rich nobleman, Virginia refuses; her aunt disowns the girl and sends her back to the island home. Virginia's ship arrives at the Indies during a hurricane, and although a cable's length from shore, it sinks before help can reach it, and Virginia is drowned. Paul witnesses her death from the shore, and almost loses his own life in a vain attempt to save her." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Some mothers muse sadly, and murmur [...] Your doings as boys - [...] Recall {{the quaint}} ways [...] Of your <b>babyhood's</b> {{innocent}} days. Some pray that, ere dying, your faith had grown firmer, [...] And higher your joys.|$|R
6000|$|Little Pansie {{was the one}} earthly {{creature}} that inherited a drop of the Dolliver blood. The Doctor's only child, poor Bessie's offspring, had died {{the better part of}} a hundred years before, and his grandchildren, a numerous and dimly remembered brood, had vanished along his weary track in their youth, maturity, or incipient age, till, hardly knowing, how it had all happened, he found himself tottering onward with an infant's small fingers in his nerveless grasp. So mistily did his dead progeny come and go in the patriarch's decayed recollection, that this solitary child represented for him the successive <b>babyhoods</b> of the many that had gone before. The emotions of his early paternity came back to him. She seemed the baby of a past age oftener than she seemed Pansie. A whole family of grand-aunts (one of whom had perished in her cradle, never so mature as Pansie now, another in her virgin bloom, another in autumnal maidenhood, yellow and shrivelled, with vinegar in her blood, and still another, a forlorn widow, whose grief outlasted even its vitality, and grew to be merely a torpid habit, and was saddest then),--all their hitherto forgotten features peeped through the face of the great-grandchild, and their long-inaudible voices sobbed, shouted, or laughed, in her familiar tones. But it often happened to Dr. Dolliver, while frolicking amid this throng of ghosts, where the one reality looked no more vivid than its shadowy sisters,--it often happened that his eyes filled with tears at a sudden perception of what a sad and poverty-stricken old man he was, already remote from his own generation, and bound to stray further onward as the sole playmate and protector of a child! ...|$|R

6000|$|She was {{the third}} thing {{feminine}} to kiss Lewisham since the promiscuous days of his <b>babyhood.</b> [...] "I was so afraid--There!" [...] She laughed hysterically.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thus far is good - It is enough--let {{her stay}} thus always!" [...] But alas for me. He shook his head: [...] No stop was there; [...] And she waned child-fair, [...] And to <b>babyhood.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{sure you}} are right," [...] he admitted. [...] "I did not know this coast, and foolishly {{imagined}} the old Pacific, in which I have sported and played since <b>babyhood,</b> was my friend wherever I found it." ...|$|E
60|$|The ape-boy craved affection. From <b>babyhood</b> {{until the}} time of her death, when the {{poisoned}} arrow of Kulonga had pierced her savage heart, Kala had represented to the English boy the sole object of love which he had known.|$|E
60|$|Then {{depositing}} {{her little}} charge with the nurse, {{and trying to}} cheer up a solemn-looking boy of three, who evidently considered his deposition from <b>babyhood</b> as a great injury, she tripped lightly down again, {{to take part in}} the Saturday's reading and catechising.|$|E
60|$|One thing only, {{was clear}} to the girl's mind. Accustomed from her very <b>babyhood</b> {{promptly}} to do the thing that could be done--whether to keep out weather, to ward off cold, to postpone hunger, or what not--she started out of her meditation, and ran home.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's what ye call a {{characteristic}} o' the race, I reckon," [...] returned Luke. [...] "They're taught to act that way from <b>babyhood.</b> It ain't polite nor high-toned to git excited.

60|$|Beneath the {{watching}} and attentive eyes of Time--so far another Major--Paul's slumbers gradually changed. More and more light broke in upon them; distincter and distincter dreams disturbed them; an accumulating crowd {{of objects and}} impressions swarmed about his rest; and so he passed from <b>babyhood</b> to childhood, and became a talking, walking, wondering Dombey.|$|E
6000|$|... "A mother," [...] said Gunakar, {{the third}} candidate, [...] "protects {{her son in}} <b>babyhood,</b> and a father when his {{offspring}} is growing up. But the man of warrior descent defends his brethren at all times. Such is the custom of the world, and such is my state. I dwell on {{the heads of the}} strong!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{prayed for}} thee, my little child, [...] And God has heard my prayer! [...] And when thy <b>babyhood</b> is gone, [...] We two {{together}} undefiled [...] By men's repinings, will kneel down [...] Upon His earth {{which will be}} fair [...] (Not covering thee, sweet!) to us twain, [...] And give Him thankful praise." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now hark to me, and don't holler so loud," [...] {{she said}} turning {{his face to}} her {{questioning}} eyes. [...] "What's gone of you anyway, nigger boy?" [...] It should be premised that Cressy's terms of endearment were mainly negro-dialectical, reminiscences of her brief <b>babyhood,</b> her slave-nurse, and the only playmates she had ever known.|$|E
6000|$|In the {{foregoing}} Mark Twain touches upon {{one of his}} favorite [...] fancies: that life should begin with old age and approach strong [...] manhood, golden youth, to end at last with pampered and beloved [...] <b>babyhood.</b> Possibly he contemplated writing a story with this idea [...] as the theme, but He seems never to have done so.|$|E
60|$|I {{had always}} lived alone with Hester. I did not {{remember}} our parents, {{who had died in}} my <b>babyhood.</b> Hester was fifteen years older than I, and she had always seemed more like a mother than a sister. She had been very good to me and had never denied me anything I wanted, save the one thing that mattered.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I hate it,' said Annaple energetically. 'It is very horrid, {{but it is}} {{awfully good}} of the Canoness; and I suppose we shall have to let it come to pass, and miss all that most charming time of <b>babyhood</b> which is coming. But most likely it will quite set the little woman up, and be a real {{kindness}} to poor Poole.' ...|$|E
60|$|Whether or not Dora {{would have}} enjoyed all this as much {{had she been}} alone is a point not {{necessary}} to settle, {{but she was a}} true country girl, and had loved chickens, barns, and hay from her <b>babyhood</b> up. She stepped quickly to the open door, and she and Ralph leaned upon the bar and looked out upon the beautiful scene.|$|E
60|$|Snowflakes and sunbeams, {{heat and}} cold, winter and summer, alternated with their wonted {{regularity}} {{for fifteen years}} in the wild regions of the Far North. During this space of time the hero of our tale sprouted from <b>babyhood</b> to boyhood, passed through the usual amount of accidents, ailments, and vicissitudes incidental to those periods of life, and finally entered upon that ambiguous condition that precedes early manhood.|$|E
60|$|The {{daughter}} had likewise been promised in her <b>babyhood</b> to the Sire de Terreforte, a knight of Auvergne, {{who had come}} {{on a mission to}} the Scotch Court in the golden days of the reign of James I., and being an old companion-in-arms of Sir Patrick, had desired to unite the families in the person of his infant son Olivier and of Annis Drummond.|$|E
6000|$|Unchildlike shade! No other babe doth wear [...] An aspect very sorrowful, as Thou. [...] No small babe-smiles my {{watching}} {{heart has}} seen [...] To float like speech the speechless lips between, [...] No dovelike cooing {{in the golden}} air, [...] No quick short joys of leaping <b>babyhood.</b> [...] Alas, our earthly good [...] In heaven thought evil, seems too good for Thee; [...] Yet, sleep, my weary One! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{what are}} you doing here?" [...] I asked. [...] "It has been long years since you {{revisited}} Earth, and never before in the trappings of Mars. Lord! but it is good to see you--and not a day older in appearance than when you trotted me on your knee in my <b>babyhood.</b> How do you explain it, John Carter, Warlord of Mars, or do you try to explain it?" ...|$|E
60|$|So {{passed away}} Sorrow the Undesired--that {{intrusive}} creature, that bastard gift of shameless Nature, who respects not the social law; a waif to whom eternal Time {{had been a}} matter of days merely, who knew not that such things as years and centuries ever were; to whom the cottage interior was the universe, the week's weather climate, new-born <b>babyhood</b> human existence, and the instinct to suck human knowledge.|$|E
60|$|I {{have often}} {{wondered}} {{what they thought}} of the peculiar treatment they receive, even at the hands of their nearest friends. While they are rosy, roly-poly little fellows they are petted and praised, adorned and adored, till it is a miracle that they are not utterly ruined. But the moment they outgrow their <b>babyhood</b> their trials begin, and they are regarded as nuisances till they are twenty-one, when they are again received into favor.|$|E
60|$|That {{the birds}} {{know what would}} happen if they were caught, and are even a little {{undecided}} about which is the better life, is obvious to every student of them. Thus, if you leave your empty perambulator under the trees and watch from a distance, you will see the birds boarding it and hopping about from pillow to blanket in a twitter of excitement; they are trying to find out how <b>babyhood</b> would suit them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Even so. As I ever said, Dr. Luther hath been setting {{forth in}} greater {{clearness}} and fulness what our blessed Friedel and I learnt at your knee, and my young ones have learnt from <b>babyhood</b> {{of the true}} Catholic doctrine. Yet I may not call my son's faith such as the Kaisar's Spanish conscience-keepers would have it, and so the boy must e'en tarry at home till there be work for his stout arm to do." ...|$|E
60|$|Presently, {{mingled with}} the beastly cries, there came faintly to the keen ears of the ape-man, the agonized moan of a child. No longer did Tarzan hesitate. Hurling the door aside, he sprang into the dark opening. Narrow and black was the corridor; but long use of his eyes in the Stygian {{blackness}} of the jungle nights had given to the ape-man something of the nocturnal visionary powers of the wild things with which he had consorted since <b>babyhood.</b>|$|E
60|$|Month {{by month}} the {{universe}} in which I lived lightened and widened. In my visits to Onalaska, I discovered the great Mississippi River, and the Minnesota Bluffs. The light of knowledge grew stronger. I began to perceive forms and faces which had been hidden in the dusk of <b>babyhood.</b> I heard {{more and more of}} LaCrosse, and out of the mist filled lower valley the booming roar of steamboats suggested to me distant countries and the sea.|$|E
60|$|The mother, as she listened, {{thought how}} fit and {{delightful}} an incident it would be, if fairies, or still better, if angel-children {{were to come}} from paradise, and play invisibly with her own darlings, and help them to make their snow-image, giving it the features of celestial <b>babyhood!</b> Violet and Peony would {{not be aware of}} their immortal playmates,--only they would see that the image grew very beautiful while they worked at it, and would think that they themselves had done it all.|$|E
60|$|And feeling {{no longer}} solitary when {{his hand was}} in the clasp of hers, he {{returned}} to the hall, where his father was installed in the baronial chair, in which Ebbo had been at home from <b>babyhood.</b> His mother's exclamation showed that her son had been wanting to her; and she looked fuller than ever of bliss when Ebbo gravely stood before his father, and presented him with the good old sword that he had sent to his unborn son.|$|E
60|$|Poor little Alwyn, he {{was less}} and less of an unmixed joy to her as he was growing out of the bounds of <b>babyhood,</b> and her notions of {{discipline}} were thwarted by her father's unbounded indulgence. To her the child was a living soul, to be trained for a responsible position here and for the eternal world beyond; to her father he was a delightful plaything, never to be vexed, whose very tempers were amusing, especially when they teased the serious elder sister.|$|E
60|$|Billy's mother, always foul-mouthed and quarrelsome, {{had been}} a veritable demon when drunk, and drunk she had been {{whenever}} she could, by hook or crook, raise the price of whiskey. Never, to Billy's recollection, had she spoken a word of endearment to him; and so terribly had she abused him that even while he was yet a little boy, scarce out of <b>babyhood,</b> {{he had learned to}} view her with a hatred as deep-rooted as is the affection of most little children for their mothers.|$|E
