50|$|The {{acknowledgement}} {{that access}} to health services differed depending on race, geographic location, and socioeconomic background was an impetus in establishing health policies to benefit these vulnerable groups. In 1965, specific programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, were implemented in the United States {{in an attempt to}} extend health insurance to a greater portion of the population. Medicare is a federally funded program that provides health insurance for people aged 65 or older, people younger than 65 with certain disabilities, and people of any age who have End-Stage Renal Disease (ERSD). Medicaid, on the other hand, provides health coverage to certain low income people and families and is largely state-governed. However, studies have shown that for-profit hospitals tend to make healthcare less accessible to uninsured patients in addition to those under Medicaid in an effort to contain costs. Another program, the State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) provides low cost health insurance to children in families who do not qualify for Medicaid but cannot afford private health insurance on their own.The necessity of achieving equity in quality of and access to healthcare is glaring and urgent. According to Fein (1972), this goal could include equal health outcomes for all <b>by</b> <b>income</b> <b>group,</b> equal expenditures per capita across income groups, or eliminating income as a healthcare rationing device. Some have proposed that a national health insurance plan with comprehensive benefits and no deductibles or other costs from the patients would provide the most equity. Fein also stressed that healthcare reform was needed, specifically in eliminating financial assistance to treat patients that depended on patient income or the quantity of services given. He proposed instead paying physicians on a salaried basis. Another study, by Reynolds (1976), found that community health centers improved access to health care for many vulnerable groups, including youth, blacks, and people with serious diseases. The study indicated that community health centers provided more preventive care and greater continuity of care, though there were problems in obtaining adequate funding as well as adequate staffing. Engaging the community to understand the link between social issues such as employment, education, and poverty can help motivate community members to advocate for policies that improve health status.|$|E

It is also determined that in both surveys, there are economies of scale in the consumption of food and clothing by means of estimated household size elasticities.

40|$|Abstract. Those {{who oppose}} {{congestion}} pricing on roads frequently argue that low-income, urban residents will suffer disproportionately if tolled to use congested freeways, either through higher out-of-pocket costs for travel and/or by diverting, delaying, or discontinuing trips. Too often, however, this assertion {{is made in}} the abstract, without considering 1) how much impoverished residents currently pay for transportation through fuel and sales taxes or 2) how much impoverished residents would pay for highway infrastructure under an alternative revenue-generating schema, such as an increased sales tax. And while increased local sales taxes are among the faster growing forms of transportation revenues in the U. S., they are rarely criticized on social equity grounds. In this paper, we compare the cost burden of an existing congestion-priced high-occupancy/toll facility on State Route 91 (SR 91) in Orange County, California, with the cost burden of Orange County’s local option transportation sales tax. We use Consumer Expenditure Survey data and user information from the SR 91 project to model expenditures <b>by</b> <b>income</b> <b>group.</b> We use these models to estimate the cost burden <b>by</b> <b>income</b> <b>group</b> for both sales taxes and congestion charges. We find that although the sales tax spreads the costs of transportation facilities across a large number of people, it redistributes an estimated $ 3 million (USD) per year from less affluent residents to those with higher incomes. Given these results, we conclude that the increasingly popular U. S. trend of user local option sales taxes to fund transportation improvements conflict with both environmental and equity improvements in transport policy and finance. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{study had}} two major objectives: (1) assess and compare changes in natural gas {{consumption}} between 1987 and 1993 <b>by</b> <b>income</b> <b>group</b> and (2) assess the potential influence of energy policy on observed changes in natural gas consumption {{over time and}} across income groups. This analysis used U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) data files and involved both the generation of simple descriptive statistics {{and the use of}} multivariate regression analysis. The consumption of natural gas by the groups was studied over a six-year period. The results showed that: (1) natural gas use was substantially higher for the highest income group than for the two lower income groups and (2) natural gas consumption declined for the lowest and middle income quintiles and increased for the highest income quintile between 1987 and 1990; between 1990 and 1993, consumption increased for the lowest and middle income quintile, but remained relatively constant for the highest income quintile. The relative importance of the structural and variable factors in explaining consumption changes between survey periods varies <b>by</b> <b>income</b> <b>group.</b> The analysis provides two major energy policy implications: (1) natural gas intensity has been the highest for the lowest income group, indicating that this group is more vulnerable to sudden changes in demand-indicator variables, in particular weather-related variables, than increase natural gas consumption, and (2) the fall in natural gas intensity between 1987 and 1993 may indicate that energy policy has had some impact on reducing natural gas consumption. 11 refs., 4 figs., 16 tabs...|$|E

When progressivity is high, politics is perceived <b>by</b> <b>income</b> <b>groups</b> as a zero sum game and conflicts over who gets what intensify. When progressivity is low, and tax contributors and benefit recipients overlap, redistributive struggles become politically less salient.
