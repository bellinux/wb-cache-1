5|$|The {{simplest}} {{way to gain}} information about brain anatomy is by visual inspection, but many more sophisticated techniques have been developed. Brain tissue in its natural state is too soft to work with, {{but it can be}} hardened by immersion in alcohol or other fixatives, and then sliced apart for examination of the interior. Visually, the interior of the brain consists of areas of so-called grey matter, with a dark color, separated by areas of white matter, with a lighter color. Further information can be gained by staining slices of brain tissue with a variety of chemicals that bring out areas where specific types of molecules are present in high concentrations. It is also possible to examine the microstructure of brain tissue using a microscope, and to trace the pattern of connections from one <b>brain</b> <b>area</b> to another.|$|E
5|$|Neurophysiologists {{study the}} chemical, pharmacological, and {{electrical}} {{properties of the}} brain: their primary tools are drugs and recording devices. Thousands of experimentally developed drugs affect the nervous system, some in highly specific ways. Recordings of brain activity can be made using electrodes, either glued to the scalp as in EEG studies, or implanted inside the brains of animals for extracellular recordings, which can detect action potentials generated by individual neurons. Because the brain does not contain pain receptors, it is possible using these techniques to record brain activity from animals that are awake and behaving without causing distress. The same techniques have occasionally been used to study brain activity in human patients suffering from intractable epilepsy, in cases {{where there was a}} medical necessity to implant electrodes to localize the <b>brain</b> <b>area</b> responsible for epileptic seizures. Functional imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging are also used to study brain activity; these techniques have mainly been used with human subjects, because they require a conscious subject to remain motionless for long periods of time, but they have the great advantage of being noninvasive.|$|E

25|$|Sleep timing depends greatly on {{hormonal}} {{signals from}} the circadian clock, or Process C, a complex neurochemical system which uses signals from an organism's environment to recreate an internal day–night rhythm. Process C counteracts the homeostatic drive for sleep during the day (in diurnal animals) and augments it at night.

25|$|As to {{structural}} plasticity {{induced by}} bilingualism, it {{has recently been}} shown that bilinguals, as compared to monolinguals, have increased grey matter density in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC).

Bilinguals have increased grey matter in this <b>brain</b> <b>area</b> because they continuously monitor their languages in order to avoid unwanted language interferences from the language not in use. The continuous use of the ACC in turn induces plastic neural effects. This may be the same reason why bilinguals are faster than monolinguals on many attentional control tasks.|$|E

40|$|Attentional {{orienting}} studies conventionally use perceptual symbolic cues {{to guide}} attention. These experiments represent a rather artificial world, {{as we know}} that in normal life it is typically information gained by our previous experience and subsequently stored in memory that guides our attention. Therefore we designed an experiment to investigate the ability to orient attention to spatial locations based on long-term memory experience and to reveal <b>brain</b> <b>areas</b> supporting this mechanism. We designed a parallel experiment using perceptual cues to compare the behavioural consequences and <b>brain</b> <b>areas</b> involved in orienting attention from memory and from perceptual cues. In validly cued trials, participants built expectancies about the location of a small target key located within complex scenes according to the previously learned location of the target or a peripheral stimulus. The results showed reliable behavioural benefits to orienting attention based on long-term memory experience. Event-related fMRI results revealed that the <b>brain</b> <b>areas</b> participating in memory-guided spatial orienting included those involved in perceptually-guided orienting. In addition, memory-guided orienting of attention activated <b>brain</b> <b>areas</b> involved in retrieval of spatial long-term memory (e. g. hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, lateral prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate/parietal-occipital junction). Analysis of the effective connectivity between <b>brain</b> <b>areas</b> in memory-guided and perceptually-guided orienting conditions showed significant differences in the interactions among participating <b>brain</b> <b>areas.</b> Overall, the experiment charts the interplay between the domains of long-term memory and attentional orienting, showing how we can optimise behaviour based on prior experience and providing insights into how the <b>brain</b> <b>areas</b> interact to enable this process...|$|R
25|$|In human studies, testosterone-aggression {{research}} has also focused {{on the role of}} the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). This <b>brain</b> <b>area</b> is strongly associated with impulse control and self-regulation systems that integrate emotion, motivation, and cognition to guide context-appropriate behavior. Patients with localized lesions to the OFC engage in heightened reactive aggression. Aggressive behavior may be regulated by testosterone via reduced medial OFC engagement following social provocation. When measuring participants' salivary testosterone, higher levels can predict subsequent aggressive behavioral reactions to unfairness faced during a task. Moreover, brain scanning with fMRI shows reduced activity in the medial OFC during such reactions. Such findings may suggest that a specific brain region, the OFC, is a key factor in understanding reactive aggression.|$|E
25|$|Three {{studies in}} 1992 {{were the first}} to explore using the BOLD {{contrast}} in humans. Kenneth Kwong and colleagues, used a gradient-echo Echo Planar Imaging (EPI) sequence at a magnetic field strength of 1.5 T to study activation in the visual cortex. Ogawa and others conducted the study using a higher field (4.0 T) and showed that the BOLD signal depended on T2* loss of magnetization. T2* decay is caused by magnetized nuclei in a volume of space losing magnetic coherence (transverse magnetization) from both bumping into one another and from intentional differences in applied magnetic field strength across locations (field inhomogeneity from a spatial gradient). Bandettini and colleagues used EPI at 1.5 T to show activation in the primary motor cortex, a <b>brain</b> <b>area</b> at the last stage of the circuitry controlling voluntary movements. The magnetic fields, pulse sequences and procedures and techniques used by these early studies are still used in current-day fMRI studies. But today researchers typically collect data from more slices (using stronger magnetic gradients), and preprocess and analyze data using statistical techniques.|$|E
500|$|Neurolinguistics is {{historically}} {{rooted in the}} development in the 19th century of aphasiology, the study of linguistic deficits (aphasias) occurring {{as the result of}} brain damage. [...] Aphasiology attempts to correlate structure to function by analyzing the effect of brain injuries on language processing. [...] One of the first people to draw a connection between a particular <b>brain</b> <b>area</b> and language processing was Paul Broca, a French surgeon who conducted autopsies on numerous individuals who had speaking deficiencies, and found that most of them had brain damage (or lesions) on the left frontal lobe, in an area now known as Broca's area. Phrenologists had made the claim in the early 19th century that different brain regions carried out different functions and that language was mostly controlled by the frontal regions of the brain, but Broca's research was possibly the first to offer empirical evidence for such a relationship, and has been described as [...] "epoch-making" [...] and [...] "pivotal" [...] to the fields of neurolinguistics and cognitive science. [...] Later, Carl Wernicke, after whom Wernicke's area is named, proposed that different areas of the brain were specialized for different linguistic tasks, with Broca's area handling the motor production of speech, and Wernicke's area handling auditory speech comprehension. [...] The work of Broca and Wernicke established the field of aphasiology and the idea that language can be studied through examining physical characteristics of the brain. [...] Early work in aphasiology also benefited from the early twentieth-century work of Korbinian Brodmann, who [...] "mapped" [...] the surface of the brain, dividing it up into numbered areas based on each area's cytoarchitecture (cell structure) and function; these areas, known as Brodmann areas, are still widely used in neuroscience today.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Inferring the {{interactions}} between different <b>brain</b> <b>areas</b> {{is an important step}} towards understanding brain activity. Most often, signals can only be measured from some specific <b>brain</b> <b>areas</b> (e. g., cortex in the case of scalp electroencephalograms). However, those signals may be affected by <b>brain</b> <b>areas</b> from which no measurements are available (e. g., deeper areas such as hippocampus). In this paper, the latter are described as hidden variables in a graphical model; such model quantifies the statistical structure in the neural recordings, conditioned on hidden variables, which are inferred in an automated fashion from the data. As an illustration, electroencephalograms (EEG) of Alzheimer’s disease patients are considered. It is shown that the number of hidden variables in AD EEG is not significantly different from healthy EEG. However, there are fewer interactions between the <b>brain</b> <b>areas,</b> conditioned on those hidden variables. Explanations for these observations are suggested. ...|$|R
40|$|While it {{is known}} that some {{individuals}} can effectively perform two tasks simultaneously, other individuals cannot. How the brain deals with performing simultaneous tasks remains unclear. In the present study, we aimed to assess which <b>brain</b> <b>areas</b> corresponded to various phenomena in task performance. Nineteen subjects were requested to sequentially perform three blocks of tasks, including two unimodal tasks and one bimodal task. The unimodal tasks measured either visual feature binding or auditory pitch comparison, while the bimodal task required performance of the two tasks simultaneously. The functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) results are compatible with previous studies showing that distinct <b>brain</b> <b>areas,</b> such as the visual cortices, frontal eye field (FEF), lateral parietal lobe (BA 7), and medial and inferior frontal lobe, are involved in processing of visual unimodal tasks. In addition, the temporal lobes and Brodmann area 43 (BA 43) were involved in processing of auditory unimodal tasks. These results lend support to concepts of modality-specific attention. Compared to the unimodal tasks, bimodal tasks required activation of additional <b>brain</b> <b>areas.</b> Furthermore, while deactivated <b>brain</b> <b>areas</b> were related to good performance in the bimodal task, these areas were not deactivated where the subject performed well in only one of the two simultaneous tasks.

We hypothesized that the association between follow-up noncontrast computed tomography ILV and outcome as assessed with mRS 3 months after stroke is strengthened when taking the mRS relevance of the infarct location into account. An anatomic atlas with 66 areas was registered to the follow-up noncontrast computed tomographic images of 254 patients from the MR CLEAN trial (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands). The anatomic <b>brain</b> <b>areas</b> were divided into <b>brain</b> <b>areas</b> of high, moderate, and low mRS relevance {{as reported in the}} literature. Based on this distinction, the ILV in <b>brain</b> <b>areas</b> of high, moderate, and low mRS relevance was assessed for each patient. Binary and ordinal logistic regression analyses with and without adjustment for known confounders were performed to assess the association between the ILVs of different mRS relevance and outcome.

2500|$|Faces are an {{important}} part of one's social life. [...] To be able to recognize, respond and act towards a person requires unconscious memory encoding and retrieval processes. Facial stimuli are processed in the fusiform gyrus (occipito-temporal <b>brain</b> <b>area)</b> and this processing is an implicit function representing a typical form of implicit memory. REM sleep has been seen to be more beneficial to implicit visuospatial memory processes, rather than slow-wave sleep which is crucial for explicit memory consolidation. REM sleep is known for its visual experiences, which may often include detailed depictions of the human countenance. [...] A recognition task was used to gauge familiarity with a previously shown sequence of faces after a subsequent period of REM sleep. It was seen that the fusiform gyrus was active during training, the REM sleep period, and the recognition task as well. It is hypothesized that brain mechanisms during REM sleep, as well as pure repetition priming, can account for the implicit recognition of the previously shown faces.|$|E
2500|$|From {{the late}} 1500s neurologists largely {{supported}} {{the theory of}} localizationism, which holds that the brain comprises functionally specialized areas.

When increasing the complexity of verbal commands comprehension is often tested by varying the grammatical structure of the command to determine whether or not the patient understands different grammatical variations of the same sentence.

2500|$|Randy Nudo's group {{found that}} if a small stroke (an infarction) is induced by {{obstruction}} of blood flow to {{a portion of a}} monkey's motor cortex, the part of the body that responds by movement moves when areas adjacent to the damaged <b>brain</b> <b>area</b> are stimulated. In one study, intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) mapping techniques were used in nine normal monkeys. Some underwent ischemic-infarction procedures and the others, ICMS procedures. The monkeys with ischemic infarctions retained more finger flexion during food retrieval and after several months this deficit returned to preoperative levels. With respect to the distal forelimb representation, [...] "postinfarction mapping procedures revealed that movement representations underwent reorganization throughout the adjacent, undamaged cortex." [...] Understanding of interaction between the damaged and undamaged areas provides a basis for better treatment plans in stroke patients. Current research includes the tracking of changes that occur in the motor areas of the cerebral cortex {{as a result of a}} stroke. Thus, events that occur in the reorganization process of the brain can be ascertained.

2500|$|This {{technique}} allows several (e.g., four) SSEPs to {{be recorded}} simultaneously from any given location on the scalp. Different sites of stimulation or different stimuli can be tagged with slightly different frequencies that are virtually identical to the brain, but easily separated by Fourier series analyzers. For example, when two unpatterned lights are modulated at slightly different frequencies (F1 and F2) and superimposed, multiple nonlinear cross-modulation components of frequency (mF1 ± [...] nF2) are created in the SSEP, where m and n are integers. These components allow nonlinear processing in the brain to be investigated. By frequency-tagging two superimposed gratings, spatial frequency and orientation tuning properties of the brain mechanisms that process spatial form can be isolated and studied. Stimuli of different sensory modalities can also be tagged. For example, a visual stimulus was flickered at Fv Hz and a simultaneously presented auditory tone was amplitude modulated at Fa Hz. The existence of a (2Fv + 2Fa) component in the evoked magnetic brain response demonstrated an audio-visual convergence area in the human brain, {{and the distribution of}} this response over the head allowed this <b>brain</b> <b>area</b> to be localized.
