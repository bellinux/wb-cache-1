Thus, for instance, the neighbors of vertex 0 consist of all odd-numbered vertices, because the numbers whose 0th bit is nonzero are exactly the odd numbers.

[...] She also has expressed her ties to Australia, declaring: [...] "I {{consider myself}} very connected to Australia, in fact when people say where is home, I say Australia, <b>because</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> my most powerful memories." ...|$|E
500|$|Film {{producer}} Joel Silver {{has said}} that after working as scriptwriters on Assassins, the Wachowskis made Bound as an [...] "audition piece" [...] {{to prove that they}} knew what to do on a movie set. Conversely, Lana Wachowski has said Joel [...] "made that up." [...] The Wachowskis themselves claim they [...] "decided simply to focus on making their own directorial debut." [...] They had the idea to write a story about how one might see a woman on the street and make assumptions about her sexuality, but how those assumptions might be wrong. They wanted to play with stereotypes and make an entertaining film that contained sex and violence, <b>because</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> the kinds of films that they like to watch. Seeing film noir as a genre within which they could tell a contained story and twist conventions, they described Billy Wilder as a big influence.|$|E

500|$|Also in 2003, the Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger – {{who later}} became Pope Benedict XVI – {{received}} a manuscript of a book critical of the novels from a German author. He stated in a private letter expressing gratitude for the receipt of the book, [...] "It is good that you enlighten people about Harry Potter, <b>because</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> subtle seductions, which act unnoticed and by this deeply distort Christianity in the soul, before it can grow properly." [...] He also recommended she send a copy of her book to Fleetwood at the Council for Culture. In a second letter, the cardinal gave the author permission to make his first letter public. These letters from Ratzinger prior to his elevation to the papacy {{have been used to}} suggest that the pontiff was officially opposed to the novels.|$|E

Furtado described the show as a [...] "full sensory experience" [...] with [...] "a beginning, middle and end ... takes you on a journey", also stressing the importance of crowd involvement and [...] "spontaneity and rawness, <b>because</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> my roots, you know? I started by doing club shows, and that's the energy I love, the raw club energy of just feeling like you're rocking out." [...] Though Furtado said choreographed dance routines were {{to be included in the}} show, she described it as [...] "music-based ... Everything else is just to keep it sophisticated and sensual and fun." [...] Furtado said she hoped to have Chris Martin, Juanes, Justin Timberlake, Timbaland and Calle 13 to guest on the tour, and have a [...] "revolving door" [...] of opening acts with Latin musicians opening in the US.|$|E
500|$|Paramount CEO Sherry Lansing revived studio {{interest}} in 1998. Schroeder, who shepherded Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands as a studio executive at 20th Century Fox in 1990, suggested that Burton direct the film. Francis Ford Coppola's minimal production duties came from American Zoetrope; Burton only {{became aware of}} Coppola's involvement during the editing process when he was sent a copy of Sleepy Hollows trailer and saw Coppola's name on it. Burton, coming off the troubled production of Superman Lives, was hired to direct in June 1998. [...] "I had never really done something that {{was more of a}} horror film," [...] he explained, [...] "and it's funny, <b>because</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> the kind of movies that I like probably more than any other genre." [...] His {{interest in}} directing a horror film influenced by his love for Hammer Film Productions and Black Sunday—particularly the supernatural feel they evoked as a result of being filmed primarily on sound stages. As a result, Sleepy Hollow is a homage to various Hammer Film Productions, including Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde, and other films such as Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, various Roger Corman horror films, Jason and the Argonauts, and Scream Blacula Scream. The image of the Headless Horseman had fascinated Burton during his apprenticeship as a Disney animator at CalArts in the early 1980s. [...] "One of my teachers had worked on the Disney version as one of the layout artists on the chase, and he brought in some layouts from it, so that was exciting. It {{was one of the things}} that maybe shaped what I like to do." [...] Burton worked with Walker on rewrites, but Rudin suggested that Tom Stoppard rewrite the script to add to the comical aspects of Ichabod's bumbling mannerisms, and emphasize the character's romance with Katrina. His work went uncredited through the WGA screenwriting credit system.|$|E

2500|$|Two {{simultaneous}} {{development programs}} emerged for a production car: {{one for a}} modified Javelin and another for a completely new car bodied in fiberglass. The first approach was selected allowing AMC to use its existing technology and unibody manufacturing expertise to make fairly inexpensive modifications to the Javelin approximating the prototype's styling and proportions. The automaker could turn out steel bodies in large numbers, so it rejected developing plastic (or fiberglass) bodies <b>because</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> intended only for low-production models. The first fully operational unit debuted as part of AMC's AMX project in 1966. The once-"frumpy" [...] automaker jumped on the [...] "pony car bandwagon" [...] with its [...] "attractive Javelin" [...] and soon introduced the [...] "unique" [...] AMX featuring a design where [...] "hoods didn't come any longer, nor decks any shorter".|$|E
2500|$|Therefore, {{the speaker}} must {{contemplate}} [...] {{more than just}} the object itself; it is sublime in its greater context. Now, Coleridge's views on the sublime are unique because Coleridge believed that Nature was only occasionally sublime, that is, only in the sky, the sea and the desert, <b>because</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> the only objects in nature that are boundless. For this reason, Coleridge's [...] "Rime of the Ancient Mariner" [...] is often considered sublime, though {{it is one of the}} few works in which Coleridge expresses the natural world as being sublime. In most of Coleridge's other works, he focuses on the [...] "metaphysical sublime," [...] which is found in the 'in between's of the world (earth and sea, sky and sea, etc.). But Coleridge didn't demand the sensation of terror or awe within the sight, rather, he focused on the element of infinity.|$|E
2500|$|... "Someone like You" [...] {{received}} glowing {{reviews from}} music critics. James Montgomery of MTV News called the video [...] "a somber, black-and-white affair, featuring Adele wandering {{the early morning}} streets and pining for her long-lost love. It's a perfect match for the song's jaw-dropping emotional range—raw and unfiltered and incredibly sad but also, {{in a lot of}} ways, beautiful and resolute." [...] In another review of the video he praised its black-and-white shots saying that [...] "director Jake Nava made the smart decision to shoot it in arty, smudgy black-and-white, which only adds to the clip's desolate, haunted feel." [...] He added that [...] "there are no special effects, no camera tricks or elaborate choreography, <b>because</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> quick fixes" [...] and called Adele the [...] "Queen of Pain." [...] A writer of the website HitFix concluded that the video is [...] "in keeping with the singer's subdued style" [...] and added that its vibe fits with the [...] "melancholy tune." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Tanner Stransky called the video [...] "quiet" [...] and said that [...] "it's just what you'd want to see for this break-up heart-wrencher." [...] Krista Wick of Entertainment Tonight praised the video for being [...] "more than enough to accompany Adele's soulful vocals." ...|$|E
