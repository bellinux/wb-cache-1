50|$|To {{supplement}} the ships {{of the permanent}} force a number of government vessels were modified so as to serve as gunboats or torpedo boats. The hopper barges Batman and Fawkner were modified so as to mount a six-inch breech-loading gun at the bow of each ship. Two machine guns were also fitted. Strengthening of the <b>bow,</b> the <b>fitting</b> of a magazine, shell room, crew quarters and some armour protection for the crew added two more gunboats to the fleet. A compressor fitted to Fawkner meant that the torpedo boats could be serviced at sea. The tug boat Gannet and steamer Lady Loch were likewise modified.|$|R
50|$|He was {{for many}} years {{associated}} with William Lewis and Son in Chicago, where he gained recognition for his outstanding ability as a maker of fine <b>bows</b> and their <b>fittings.</b> While in the employ of Lewis and Sons, he also repaired and restored the finest bows that came through the shop. He was hailed as a superb copyist by many including William Lewis and Joseph Roda.|$|R

The firm soon gained a {{widespread}} reputation for excellence in repairs, making of instruments, <b>bows,</b> cases and <b>fittings,</b> as well as instrument identification and authentication. A Hill's Certificate of Authenticity was considered definitive worldwide throughout the firm's history.|$|R

50|$|Minako's primary Soldier {{identity}} {{is that of}} Sailor Venus. Sailor Venus wears a sailor suit colored in orange (choker, collar, center of front <b>bow,</b> elbow <b>fittings</b> on her gloves, skirt, earrings, and a matching set of orange ankle-strap heels), navy blue (front bow) and yellow (tiara gem and back bow), and retains the red bow she wears as a civilian. In the live-action series, this bow appears only when she is {{in one of her}} Guardian forms, and has a gem in the center. In the manga, live-action series and Sailor Moon Crystal, she wears an item called the Wink Chain around her waist, which she sometimes uses as a weapon. She is given specific titles throughout the various series, including Soldier of Love, Soldier of Love and Hope, and Soldier of Love and Beauty. Her personality is no different from when she is a civilian, although she must be Sailor Venus to access her celestial powers.|$|R
50|$|The {{ships of}} the Admiral Hipper class varied {{slightly}} in size. Admiral Hipper was 195.5 m long at the waterline and 202.8 m overall. After {{the installation of}} a clipper <b>bow</b> during <b>fitting</b> out, her overall length increased to 205 m. The ship had a beam of 21.3 m. Bl端cher was 195 m long at the waterline and 203.2 m overall; with the clipper bow, her overall length was 205.9 m. Her beam was 22 m. Both ships had a designed draft of 6.5 m and a full load draft of 7.2 m. Prinz Eugen was 199.5 m at the waterline and 207.7 m long overall; with the clipper bow, her overall length was 212.5 m. Her beam was 21.7 m and a draft of 6.6 m standard and 7.2 m at full load. Seydlitz and L端tzow were 210 m long overall, with beams of 21.8 m and drafts of 6.9 m standard and 7.9 m at full load.|$|R
50|$|Before {{cutting a}} tree, the builder had {{to assess the}} log, its shape, length, areas of damage {{and the extent of}} heart rot, as well as ways to work the bow and stern. A major {{requirement}} while working with such an enormous log must have been to minimize the number of times the log had to be turned over. The first stage, therefore, would be to externally flatten the bottom and slightly upturn the bow and stern and shape the hull sides, as well as drilling holes for thickness gauges as required. The log would then be rolled over and placed on some sort of timber framework so that access to the bottom was still possible. The next stage would be to work the upper section of the log to produce a sheerline and then work the inside until thickness gauges were reached. In this case, {{because of the presence of}} extensive rot, hollowing was probably done by tools rather than by fire. The thickness of the sides would be achieved by eye or by sound, simply by tapping the log. For the bottom, however, the holes left by the thickness gauges were later plugged by tightly fitted and dried oak tree-nails to ensure they were completely watertight upon expansion of the timber. The log would then be finished internally, with all the rebates for <b>fitting</b> <b>bow</b> timbers, transom, washstrakes, and holes along the sheerline cut. As the final step, bow and stern timbers, which were separate pieces from the hull log, would be caulked with moss and the whole structure made watertight.|$|R
40|$|This thesis divides {{into two}} {{distinct}} parts, {{both of which}} are underpinned by the tight-binding model. The first part covers our implementation of the tight-binding model in conjunction with the Berry phase theory of electronic polarisation to probe the atomistic origins of spontaneous polarisation and piezoelectricity as well as attempting to accurately calculate the values and coefficients associated with these phenomena. We first develop an analytic model for the polarisation of a one-dimensional linear chain of atoms. We compare the zincblende and ideal wurtzite structures in terms of effective charges, spontaneous polarisation and piezoelectric coefficients, within a first nearest neighbour tight-binding model. We further compare these to real wurtzite structures and conclude that accurate quantitative results are {{beyond the scope of this}} model but qualitative trends can still be described. The second part of this thesis deals with implementing the tight-binding model to investigate the effect of local alloy fluctuations in bulk AlGaN alloys and InGaN quantum wells. We calculate the band gap evolution of Al 1 _xGaxN across the full composition range and compare it to experiment as well as <b>fitting</b> <b>bowing</b> parameters to the band gap as well as to the conduction band and valence band edges. We also investigate the wavefunction character of the valence band edge to determine the composition at which the optical polarisation switches in Al 1 _xGaxN alloys. Finally, we examine electron and hole localisation in InGaN quantum wells. We show how the built-in field localises the carriers along the c-axis and how local alloy fluctuations strongly localise the highest hole states in the c-plane, while the electrons remain delocalised in the c-plane. We show how this localisation affects the charge density overlap and also investigate the effect of well width fluctuations on the localisation of the electrons...|$|R
