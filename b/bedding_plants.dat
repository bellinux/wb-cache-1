California, Florida, Texas, Michigan, and Ohio accounted for 42% of the nation's production of <b>bedding</b> <b>plants</b> in 2002. Oberer's Flowers, headquartered in Dayton, is the nation's fifth-largest florist, while Aris Horticulture, headquartered in Barberton, is a world leader in research and breeding.

5|$|Thousands {{of plant}} species are {{cultivated}} for aesthetic purposes {{as well as}} to provide shade, modify temperatures, reduce wind, abate noise, provide privacy, and prevent soil erosion. Plants are the basis of a multibillion-dollar per year tourism industry, which includes travel to historic gardens, national parks, rainforests, forests with colorful autumn leaves, and festivals such as Japan's and America's cherry blossom festivals. While some gardens are planted with food crops, many are planted for aesthetic, ornamental, or conservation purposes. Arboretums and botanical gardens are public collections of living plants. In private outdoor gardens, lawn grasses, shade trees, ornamental trees, shrubs, vines, herbaceous perennials and <b>bedding</b> <b>plants</b> are used. Gardeners may cultivate the plants in a naturalistic state, or may sculpture their growth, as with topiary or espalier. Gardening is the most popular leisure activity in the U.S., and working with plants or horticulture therapy is beneficial for rehabilitating people with disabilities. Plants may also be grown or kept indoors as houseplants, or in specialized buildings such as greenhouses that are designed for the care and cultivation of living plants. Venus Flytrap, sensitive plant and resurrection plant are examples of plants sold as novelties. There are also art forms specializing in the arrangement of cut or living plant, such as bonsai, ikebana, and the arrangement of cut or dried flowers. Ornamental plants have sometimes changed the course of history, as in tulipomania.|$|E

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was conducted at}} the Agricultural Research Station of Isfahan University of Technolgy in 2006 to evaluate the effects of planting pattern {{and the level of}} soil moisture on two safflower cultivars. A factorial split plot arrangement was used in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Two planting patternS (flat and <b>bed</b> <b>planting)</b> and two levels of soil moisture (irrigation after 80 and 100 mm cumulative evaporation from Class A pan) were considered as the main factor and two safflower cultivars (IL 111 and Kosseh) as minor factor. Each plot in flat planting consistedof six rows, spaced 25 cm apart with plants 8 cm apart and in <b>bed</b> <b>planting</b> consisted of four rows, spaced 45 cm apart with plants 5 cm apart. The duration from planting to button formation, 50 % flowering, and 100 % flowering stage were significantly shorter in 45 cm <b>bed</b> <b>planting</b> than in 25 cm flat planting. The duration from planting to all growth stages was less in IL 111, compared to Kosseh cultivar. The level of soil moisture did not affect the duration of any growth stages. Plant height, leaf area index, plant dry matter, number of buttons per plant, number of grains per button, grain weight, and harvest index were higher in flat <b>planting,</b> compared to <b>bed</b> <b>planting.</b> Plant height, plant dry matter, number of buttons per plant, number of grains per button, grain weight, and harvest index were reduced as the level of soil moisture was decreased. Leaf area index and plant dry matter were not significantly affected by the level of soil moisture at 50 % flowering stage. Regardless of the level of soil moisture and cultivar, the grain yield was 36 % more in flat <b>planting</b> than <b>bed</b> <b>planting.</b> The grain yield was more at higher level of soil moisture and also in Kosseh than in IL 111. The oil percentage and oil yield was higher in flat <b>planting,</b> compared to <b>bed</b> <b>planting</b> and also in Kosseh than in IL 111. The oil percentage was not significantly affected by the level of soil moisture. However, the oil yield was decreased as the level of soil moisture was reduced. The highest amount (1168 kg/ ha) of oil yield was obtained from Kosseh in flat planting and the lowest amount (417 kg/ ha) was achieved from IL 111 in <b>bed</b> <b>planting.</b> The results from this experiment show that to obtain the optimum yield from summer planting in areas with similar conditions to that of this study the 25 cm flat planting compared to the 45 cm <b>bed</b> <b>planting,</b> and Kosseh compared to IL 111 cultivar seems to be superior...|$|R

In this study three methods of planting (one and two raised <b>bed</b> and furrow <b>planting)</b> and three varieties sweet corn (Chase, Temptation, KSC 403 su) and one super sweet corn (Challenger) were studied in factorial experiment based on Randomized Complete Block Design with three replications. The result of ANOVA showed that sweet corn hybrids had significant differences in kernel depth, conservable grain yield and ear harvest index. It also showed that number of leaves per plant, number of leaves above ear, stem diameter, ear diameter, kernel depth, conservable grain yield and forage yield, were significantly different among three levels of planting patterns. The maximum main of these characters was belonging to two-raised <b>bed</b> <b>planting</b> pattern. In addition, the highest conservable grain yield was belonged to Challenger in two raised <b>bed</b> <b>planting</b> pattern with 25. 76 ton/ha and highest fresh foliage yield was 48. 6 ton/ha which belonged to Chase on one raised <b>bed</b> <b>planting</b> method.

40|$|Water {{conservation}} {{technologies like}} furrow irrigated raised <b>bed</b> <b>planting</b> are {{the need of}} day to improve water productivity and to get more crop production from the available limited water supplies. The present study was conducted at the experimental area of Water Management Research Centre, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, to perform irrigation scheduling and investigate optimum number of irrigations for wheat under flat sowing and raised <b>bed</b> <b>planting</b> in a semi-arid climate of Faisalabad. Soil type of the area was sandy loam with bulk density of 1. 55 g/cm 3. The experiment was designed in Randomized Complete Block Design with five replicates and three treatments viz. T 1 : Flat sowing with irrigation at 50 % MAD, T 2 : Bed planting with irrigation at 50 % MAD, and T 3 : Bed planting with irrigation {{on the same day}} as in T 1. Regular check of soil moisture status was performed and irrigations were applied in first two treatments at about 50 % depletion of available water. The irrigations in T 3, however, were applied on the same day as in T 1, even if the soil moisture content went far below 50 % of available water, to check the impact of water stress on crop, if any, under raised bed technology. In this way, four irrigations were applied to T 1 and T 3 on same dates, whereas five irrigations were applied in T 2 throughout the season. The impacts of increasing number of irrigations in wheat <b>bed</b> <b>planting</b> were evaluated statistically to check the changes in yield and irrigation water productivity. Grain yields under two <b>bed</b> <b>planting</b> treatments were found significantly higher as compared to T 1, but at par with each other, while the water saving in comparison to flat sowing decreased from 47. 43 % in T 3 to 35. 74 % in T 2 due to an extra irrigation in T 2. Highest irrigation water productivity (1. 32 kg/m 3) was achieved in T 3, followed by 1. 12 kg/m 3 in T 2 and 0. 54 kg/m 3 in T 1. It was concluded that application of an extra irrigation in <b>bed</b> <b>planting</b> resulted in non-significant increase in yield in comparison to <b>bed</b> <b>planting</b> with normal four irrigations, but in a highly significant decrease in irrigation water productivity, indicating that {{there is no need to}} apply extra number of irrigations in <b>bed</b> <b>planted</b> wheat in comparison to conventional metho...|$|R

40|$|A {{key driver}} of Australian sweetpotato {{productivity}} improvements and consumer demand has been industry adoption of disease-free planting material systems. On a farm isolated from main Australian sweetpotato areas, virus-free germplasm is annually multiplied, with subsequent 'pathogen-tested' (PT) sweetpotato roots shipped to commercial Australian sweetpotato growers. They in turn plant their PT roots into specially designated <b>plant</b> <b>beds,</b> commencing in late winter. From these beds, they cut sprouts {{as the basis}} for their commercial fields.
