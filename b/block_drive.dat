50|$|Note: Any {{nonlinear}} electronic <b>block</b> <b>driven</b> by two signals with frequencies f1 and f2 {{would generate}} intermodulation (mixing) products. A multiplier (which is a nonlinear device) will generate ideally only the sum and difference frequencies, whereas an arbitrary nonlinear block would generate also signals at e.g. 2·f1-3·f2, etc. Therefore, normal nonlinear amplifiers or just single diodes {{have been used}} as mixers, instead of a more complex multiplier. A multiplier has usually the advantage of rejecting - at least partly - undesired higher-order intermodulations and larger conversion gain.|$|R

50|$|When {{defending}} {{against a}} smash, players have three basic options: lift, <b>block,</b> or <b>drive.</b> In singles, a block {{to the net}} {{is the most common}} reply.

Many players use a backhand hitting action for returning smashes on both the forehand and backhand sides, because backhands are more effective than forehands at covering smashes directed to the body. Hard shots directed towards the body are difficult to defend.|$|R

A small molecular reaction network exploits recognition-mediated reactive processes {{in order to}} drive the assembly and formation of both a self-replicating linear template (thread) and a [2]rotaxane, in which the linear template is encircled by a diamide macrocycle. Complementary recognition sites, placed at strategic positions on the reactive building <b>blocks,</b> <b>drive</b> these assembly and replication processes. Template-instructed experiments show that the thread is capable of efficient self-replication and that no cross-catalytic relationships exist between thread and the [2]rotaxane. The rate of [2]rotaxane formation is insensitive to the addition of preformed template, however, [2]rotaxane formation does show enhanced diastereoselectivity, most likely originating from its recognition- mediated formation through a binary reactive complex.

40|$|A novel linear-dendritic block {{copolymer}} has been synthesized and evaluated for targeted delivery.

The polypeptide linear hydrophobic <b>block</b> <b>drives</b> formation of micelles that carry core-loaded drugs, and their unique design gives them extremely high stability in vivo. We have found that these systems lead to extended time periods of increased accumulation in the tumor (up to 5 days) compared with nontargeted vehicles.

40|$|Nature has {{mastered}} the art of creating complex structures through self-assembly of simpler building blocks. Adapting such a bottom-up view provides a potential route to the fabrication of novel materials. However, this approach suffers from the lack of a sufficiently detailed understanding of the noncovalent forces that hold the self-assembled structures together. Here we demonstrate that nature can indeed guide us, as we explore routes to helicity with achiral building <b>blocks</b> <b>driven</b> by the interplay between two competing length scales for the interactions, as in DNA. By characterizing global minima for clusters, we illustrate several realizations of helical architecture, the simplest one involving ellipsoids of revolution as building blocks. In particular, we show that axially symmetric soft discoids can self-assemble into helical columnar arrangements. Understanding the molecular origin of such spatial organisation has important implications for the rational design of materials with useful optoelectronic applications...|$|R
40|$|An inter-frame {{coding scheme}} {{employing}} bilinear interpolation on multiresolution layers is proposed for high quality low-rate video. Major {{features of the}} novel outline are: thresholded block-matching algorithm for reliable motion estimation and integrated smoothing-segmentation of the displacement vector field for compact encoding of motion information. Bilinear interpolation of motion-compensated difference blocks is performed by recursive splitting into smaller square <b>blocks,</b> <b>driven</b> by psychovisually chosen thresholds. The resulting split quad-tree is encoded {{as well as the}} quantized coefficients of the interpolation polynomials. Coding tests on multiple fields of the Claire sequence exhibit over 35 dB PSNR and excellent visual fidelity at an average rate of about 20 kbit/s for coding the luminance component only.

40|$|We propose and {{demonstrate}} {{the concept of}} a novel 1 N lossless adaptive optical power splitter (OPS) structure integrating a software-driven Opto-VLSI processor, optical amplifiers, and an array of 4 -f imaging systems. The active area of the Opto-VLSI processor is divided into M pixel <b>blocks</b> <b>driven</b> by multicasting phase holograms and aligned with an M-element lens array and a fiber array, thus forming an array of 4 -f imaging systems. Each 4 -f imaging system is capable of collimating and adaptively splitting an input optical beam emerging from an optical fiber and then coupling the split beams into different output fiber ports, thus realizing dynamic optical power splitting. The Opto-VLSI processor is driven by optimized multicasting phase holograms that adaptively split an incident laser beam along different angles; thus, user-defined splitting ratios can be achieved. Experimental results show that the optical amplifiers compensate for the splitting and the insertion losses, making the adaptive OPS lossless...|$|R
40|$|Analogous to {{the complex}} {{membranes}} found in cellular organelles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, the inverse cubic mesophases of lipids and their colloidal forms (cubosomes) possess internal networks of water channels arranged in crystalline order, which provide a unique nanospace for membrane-protein crystallization and guest encapsulation. Polymeric analogues of cubosomes formed by the direct self-assembly of block copolymers in solution could provide new polymeric mesoporous materials with a three-dimensionally organized internal maze of large water channels. Here we report the self-assembly of amphiphilic dendritic-linear block copolymers into polymer cubosomes in aqueous solution. The presence of precisely defined bulky dendritic <b>blocks</b> <b>drives</b> the <b>block</b> copolymers to form spontaneously highly curved bilayers in aqueous solution. This results {{in the formation of}} colloidal inverse bicontinuous cubic mesophases. The internal networks of water channels provide a high surface area with tunable surface functional groups that can serve as anchoring points for large guests such as proteins and enzymes. close 5...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} massive MIMO, {{especially}} at millimeter waves, requires a trade-off between cost and power consumption, balancing {{the complexity and}} the performance in terms of achievable rate. A recent trend in the design is to split the pre-coding at the transmitter and the combining at the receiver into a digital and analog part, with hybrid analog-digital schemes. In this paper the effect of phase noise is considered {{in the design of}} different hybrid analog-digital alternatives to implement massive MIMO, in particular at very high frequencies. Its effect depending on the number of RF chains, oscillators, and groups of antennas is analyzed providing some insights for the system design. In order to limit the penalty introduced by the phase noise to values below 6 dB, with a number of antennas around 64, the value of phase noise increment variance should be limited below 0. 005. This limit is slightly lower in a simplified architecture with more <b>blocks</b> <b>driven</b> by independent oscillators. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|The {{equations}} for {{the sliding}} {{of a single}} <b>block</b> <b>driven</b> by an elastic force show numerically a fast and a slow step in their dynamics when a dimensionless parameter is very large, a limit pertinent for many applications. An asymptotic analysis of the solutions explains well the two sharply different steps of the stick-slip dynamics. The stick (slow) part takes place along a slow manifold in the phase space. But, in contrast with standard relaxation dynamics (of van der Pol type), the slow manifold is always formally attracting and the transition from slow to fast dynamics occurs because the slow dynamics has a finite time singularity breaking the assumption of slowness. This makes {{a new kind of}} relaxation oscillation. We show that the response of the stick-slip system to an external noise displays a progressive speed-up before the transition, in contrast with the well known critical slowing-down observed in the standard case...|$|R

50|$|The moving-barrel design {{mechanism}} operates {{by use of}} a wedge-shaped falling {{locking block}} underneath the breech. When the pistol is fired both the barrel and slide recoil for a short distance together, where the locking <b>block</b> <b>drives</b> down, disengaging the slide and arresting further rearward movement of the barrel. The slide however continues its rearward movement on the frame, ejecting the spent case and cocking the hammer before reaching the end of travel. Two return springs located {{on either side of}} the frame and below the slide, having been compressed by the slide's rearward movement, drive the slide forward, stripping a new round from the magazine, driving it into the breech and, in the process, re-engaging the barrel; ending its return travel with a fresh round chambered, hammer cocked and ready to repeat the process. The falling locking block design provides good accuracy due to the in-line travel of the barrel and slide.|$|R
