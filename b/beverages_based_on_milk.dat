O objetivo deste trabalho foi caracterizar bebidas lácteas funcionais fermentadas por probióticos e acrescidas de prebiótico, elaboradas {{conforme}} 12 tratamentos. As amostras foram submetidas a análises de pH, acidez, gordura, sólidos totais, proteínas, cinzas e carboidratos. O valor de pH 4, 8 foi um parâmetro adequado para finalizar a fermentação das bebidas, garantindo assim a viabilidade dos probióticos. Houve variação na composição centesimal das bebidas lácteas conforme a formulação. Quanto maior o teor de soro, menor a acidez titulável e menor o teor de proteínas. As bebidas lácteas apresentaram os maiores teores de sólidos totais e de carboidratos, quando formuladas com as maiores porcentagens de açúcar e frutooligossacarídeos. Os menores teores de cinzas foram observados nas bebidas elaboradas com os maiores teores de açúcar. As amostras atenderam à legislação brasileira em vigor, sendo os produtos considerados desnatados por apresentarem menos de 0, 5 % de gordura, independente das formulações. The {{attempt to}} find healthier foods combined {{with the use of}} whey by the dairy industry has favored the production of fermented dairy <b>beverages</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>milk</b> whey. The aim of this research is to characterize functional dairy beverages fermented by probiotics which have a prebiotic supplement added and which have been developed according to 12 treatments. The samples were analysed for the pH, acidity, fat content, total solids, protein, ashes and carbohydrates. The pH value of 4. 8 was a suitable parameter to complete the fermentation of the beverages, thus ensuring the viability of probiotics. There was a variation in the centesimal composition of the dairy beverages according to the formulation. The higher the whey content, the lower the titratable acidity and the lower the protein content. The dairy beverages showed the highest total solids and carbohydrate contents when formulated with higher percentages of sugar and fructooligossacharides. The lower ash contents were observed in the beverages prepared with the highest sugar contents. The samples complied with current Brazilian legislation, and the products were considered nonfat because they presented less than 0. 5 % fat, regardless of the formulations...|$|E

Results: According to the total antioxidant values obtained by both methods, the beverages can be ranked as follows: grape-orange-banana > peach-apple > pineapple-banana. Ascorbic acid was the main contributor (60 %) to the total antioxidant capacity, while the contribution of skimmed milk was less than 1. 2 %. After one month of storage at - 20 ºC, significant losses (p < 0. 05) in total antioxidant capacity were found, though these were lower than 3 % and therefore lacked nutritional significance. The bioaccessible fractions (maximum soluble fraction in simulated gastrointestinal media) of the beverages, obtained by in vitro gastrointestinal digestion, had antioxidant activities significantly lower (p < 0. 05) than the original beverages, though the loss of antioxidant activity was always lower than 19 % -thus indicating {{the stability of the}} total antioxidant capacity under the applied conditions. Conclusions: The total antioxidant capacity values of the bioaccessible fraction show that most antioxidants are available for absorption after digestion, and might contribute to the beneficial effects attributed to antioxidants...|$|R

Methods: Previously, a survey was performed on food intake habits of the adult population of Slovenia, which was carried out on a representative population sample {{in the form of a}} personal interview with a questionnaire. The data on daily water and beverages intake from this survey were used in our study. A total of 2267 adults were included (aged 18 – 65 years). A total of 1184 correctly completed questionnaires were included in the analysis. Results: Total average daily consumption of all beverages was 16. 6 dl. The respondents mainly consumed plain water and <b>beverages</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> it: 10 dl, followed by other non-alcoholic beverages: 5. 5 dl, and alcoholic beverages: 1 dl.

40|$|AbstractFrequently updated {{energy balance}} (EB) {{estimates}} for individual cows are especially useful for dairy herd management, and individual-level estimates {{form the basis}} for group-level EB estimates. The accuracy of EB estimates determines the value of this information for management decision support. This study aimed to assess EB accuracy through ANOVA components and by comparing EB estimates <b>based</b> either <b>on</b> <b>milk</b> composition (EBalMilk) or on body condition score (BCS) and body weight (BW) (EBalBody). Energy balance <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>milk</b> composition was evaluated using data in which milk composition was measured at each milking. Three breeds (Danish Red, Holstein-Friesian, and Jersey) of cows (299 cows, 623 lactations) in parities 1 to 4 were used. Milk data were smoothed using a rolling local regression. Energy balance <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>milk</b> composition was calculated using a partial least squares (PLS) model <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>milk</b> fat, protein, and lactose contents and yields, and the daily change in these variables at each day. Energy balance <b>based</b> <b>on</b> BCS and BW was calculated from changes in body condition and BW scored weekly or fortnightly. Equations for calculation of EBalMilk and EBalBody used no common variables and were, therefore, assumed mathematically independent. Traits were analyzed within 3 stages of lactation expected to have high mobilization of body tissue (1, early), almost balanced (2), and deposition of body energy (3, mid to late lactation). In general, EBalMilk and EBalBody followed similar expected changes through lactation. Estimates of covariance were obtained using single-trait mixed models with random regression terms describing the change with time and used for calculation of repeatability as intraclass correlations. Within stage, EBalMilk was less repeatable than EBalBody (0. 53, 0. 41, 0. 43 vs. 0. 93, 0. 91, 0. 86, respectively, for stages 1, 2, and 3), mainly because of a larger residual variance for EBalMilk. Correlations between individual-level estimates of EBalMilk and EBalBody were close to zero. However, correlations between EB estimates in different lactation stages tended to be stronger for EBalMilk than for EBalBody, although correlations for both EB traits were small. It is concluded that EB estimates <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>milk</b> composition are less accurate than those <b>based</b> <b>on</b> body traits, but EBalMilk can compensate partly for this inaccuracy by being updated more frequently...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Payment {{programs}} <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>milk</b> quality (PPBMQ) {{are used}} in several {{countries around the world}} as an incentive to improve milk quality. One of the principal milk parameters used in such programs is the bulk tank somatic cell count (BTSCC). In this study, using data from an average of 37, 000 farms per month in Brazil where milk was analyzed, BTSCC data were divided into different payment classes <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>milk</b> quality. Then, descriptive and graphical analyses were performed. The probability of a change to a worse payment class was calculated, future BTSCC values were predicted using time series models, and financial losses due to the failure to reach the maximum bonus for the payment <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>milk</b> quality were simulated. Results In Brazil, the mean BTSCC has remained high in recent years, without a tendency to improve. The probability of changing to a worse payment class was strongly affected by both the BTSCC average and BTSCC standard deviation for classes 1 and 2 (1000 – 200, 000 and 201, 000 – 400, 000 cells/mL, respectively) and only by the BTSCC average for classes 3 and 4 (401, 000 – 500, 000 and 501, 000 – 800, 000 cells/mL, respectively). The time series models indicated that {{at some point in the}} year, farms would not remain in their current class and would accrue financial losses due to payments <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>milk</b> quality. Conclusion The BTSCC for Brazilian dairy farms has not recently improved. The probability of a class change to a worse class is a metric that can aid in decision-making and stimulate farmers to improve milk quality. A time series model can be used to predict the future value of the BTSCC, making it possible to estimate financial losses and to show, moreover, that financial losses occur in all classes of the PPBMQ because the farmers do not remain in the best payment class in all months.
