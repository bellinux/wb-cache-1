We propose a “FedGap” variable which measures the deviation of Fed policy from the “Taylor Rule” in explanation and find it to be significant with economic meaning. We conclude that market responses proportionally to the size of the FedGap and it thus serves as a new “macro-state” factor which can explain the dynamic response patterns of financial markets.

We propose several specifications of a probit model for classifying phases of the business cycle.

The recession probabilities of these models provide a clearer classification of the business cycle into expansion and recession periods, and superior performance in the ability to correctly call recessions and to avoid false recession signals. Overall, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of these models are far superior as well as their ability to timely signal recessions.

More precisely, given a network and a security policy, we want to automatically generate the necessary monitors (a single fire-wall or many ones where each of them controls a part of the networks) that force the network to be secure according to the security policy definition. In this approach, the network is formalized as a process P, the security policy is formally specified as a formula Φ and the problem is to find a process M (monitor) such that P M | = Φ. Once this step is completed, some results about equivalence between processes can be used to distribute the monitor over the network.

Material and Methods. 193 patients with axial SpA were randomized into 3 groups with the different ways of the disease activity monitoring: 96 patients were managed in free way, 26 patients visited rheumatologist every 12 weeks, 69 patients managed remotely — we called them every 4 weeks. After {{the first year of}} follow up we made 3 -month break in the telephone monitoring. The data on the treatment and SpA activity (indexes BASDAI, PASS, ESR, CRP) were collected. Results. In patients managed in a free way SpA activity was severe after a year. In groups managed remotely and once in 3 month the significant reduction in the disease activity was achieved with maximal decrease in remote monitoring group. Positive PASS group 3 was found in 15 patients (57. 69 %, n= 26), in group 2 — in 4 patients (20 %, n= 20), in group 1 — no patients (0 %). NSAIDs intake was arbitrarily changed by 5 (19. 23 %, n= 26), 15 (75 %, n= 20), and 93 (96. 87 %, n= 96) patients of groups 3, 2 and 1, respectively.

A leading material system in this class of materials is silicon carbide (SiC) fiber-reinforced SiC matrix composites. Unfortunately, the nonoxide fibers, matrix, and interphase (boron nitride in this system) can react with oxygen or water vapor in the atmosphere, leading to strength degradation of the composite at elevated temperatures. For this study, constant-load stress-rupture tests were performed in air at temperatures ranging from 815 to 960 C until failure.

During these experiments, the sounds of failure events (matrix cracking and fiber <b>breaking)</b> were <b>monitored</b> with a modal acoustic emission (AE) analyzer through transducers that were attached at the ends of the tensile bars.

The 2 D-IR measurements reveal excitation exchange between the two nondegenerate asymmetric-stretch vibrations on a 300 -fs time scale concomitant with fast anisotropy decay of the diagonal-peak signals. The MD simulations show that this is caused by jumps of the transition dipole orientations related to fluctuations of the hydrogen bonds connecting the nitrate ion to the nearest water molecules.

40|$|Ultrafast {{infrared}} transient absorption {{measurements of}} the complete hydroxyl OD stretching mode spectrum of HOD in water, from 100 fs to tens of picoseconds, observe hydrogen bond <b>breaking</b> and <b>monitor</b> the equilibration of the hydrogen bond network in water. In addition, the vibrational lifetime, the time constant for hydrogen bond breaking, {{and the rate of}} orientational relaxation are determined. The reactant and photoproduct spectra of the hydrogen bond breaking process are identified by decomposing the transient spectra into two components, the initial spectrum associated with vibrational excited states (reactants) and the long-time spectrum associated with broken hydrogen bonds (photoproducts). By properly taking into account the perturbation of the reactant spectrum decay by the growth of the photoproduct spectrum, it is found that the vibrational relaxation (1. 45 ps) and orientational relaxation (1. 53 ps) are wavelength independent and, therefore, independent of the degree of hydrogen bonding. Energy deposited into water by vibrational relaxation does not immediately break a hydrogen bond by predissociation nor produce a thermally equilibrated hydrogen bond distribution at an elevated temperature. Following deposition of energy by vibrational relaxation, the hydrogen bond breaking time is 800 fs, and there is a transient period of several picoseconds during which the hydrogen bond distribution is not in thermal equilibrium.

Female Wistar rats were fed a high-fat (46 %) diet for 16 wk to produce mature lean and obese animals. Stage of estrous was identified by daily vaginal lavage, while energy intake (EI), total energy expenditure (TEE), and fuel utilization were monitored in a multichamber indirect calorimeter and activity was monitored by infrared beam <b>breaks.</b> Metabolic <b>monitoring</b> studies were repeated during the 3 -wk period of rapid OVX-induced weight gain. Component analysis of TEE was performed to determine the nonresting and resting portions of energy expenditure. Obesity was associated with a greater fluctuation in EB across the estrous cycle. Cycling obese rats were less active, expended more energy per movement, and oxidized more carbohydrate than lean rats. The changes in EB over the cycle in lean and obese rats were driven by changes in EI. Finally, OVX induced a large positive energy imbalance in obese and lean rats. This resulted primarily from an increase in EI in both groups, with little change in TEE following OVX. These observations reveal a dominant effect of obesity on EB, fuel utilization, and activity levels in cycling rats, which has implications for studies focused on obesity and EB in female rodents...|$|R

First, the improvement in the S/N ratio and distortion of the waveform after the process were compare to those in -filter and wavelet shrinkage methods. The improvement in the S/N ratio of the waveform processed by SS constantly increased and was observed to be independent of the S/N ratio of the wave before processing. The distortion of the waveform processed by SS was less than the distortions of the waves processed using -filter and by wavelet shrinkage. Next, the effect of two parameters in the SS process ® frame number (fn) and over-subtraction factor (¡) ® on the noise reduction performance was studied. The S/N ratio of the signals processed by the SS technique improved with decreasing fn and with increasing ¡. However, the processed waveform was distorted when ¡ was large. It is necessary to set the value of fn to 16 or less and ¡ to 5 or less so that SS showed an advantage to reduce noise with low waveform distortion. Cylindrical wave AE signals produced by the Hsu-Nielsen source (pencil lead <b>breaking)</b> were <b>monitored</b> with the developed system in an environment with artificial noise.
