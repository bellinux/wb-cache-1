5|$|The Moon's orbit intersects {{with the}} {{ecliptic}} {{at the two}} nodes that are 180 degrees apart.

Sometimes the new moon occurs close enough to a node during two consecutive months to eclipse the Sun on both occasions in two partial eclipses.

5|$|Each NBA and WNBA {{franchise}} {{seeks to}} add new players through their respective annual draft. The NBA uses a draft lottery {{to determine the}} first three picks of the NBA draft; the 14teams that {{did not make the}} playoffs the previous year are eligible to participate. After the first three picks are decided, the rest of the teams pick in reverse order of their win–loss record. To be eligible for the NBA Draft, a player in the United States must <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 19years old during the calendar year of the draft and must <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> one year removed from the graduation of his high school class. From 1967 until the ABA–NBA merger in 1976, the American Basketball Association (ABA) held its own draft. The WNBA Draft is similar to the NBA with a couple of exceptions. Only fourWNBA teams are eligible for the draft lottery, compared to the 14 eligible teams in the NBA. Also, all non-playoff teams that participate in the draft lottery select their picks in the order of the lottery outcome; the remainder of the league selects in reverse order of their win–loss record. The WNBA requires that players <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 22years old during the calendar year of the applicable seasons, have either graduated from a four-year university or have completed their intercollegiate basketball eligibility, or have played at least two seasons for another professional basketball league.|$|E
