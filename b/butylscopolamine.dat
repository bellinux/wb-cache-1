Once the muscles of the esophagus no longer force the food down the throat (active peristalsis), it may slip down on its own accord. If spasmolytics do not solve the problem, the veterinarian will usually pass a stomach tube through one of the nostrils and direct it into the esophagus until the material is reached, at which point gentle pressure is applied to manually push the material down.

50|$|Most small {{stones are}} passed spontaneously and only pain {{management}} is required. Above 5 mm {{the rate of}} spontaneous stone passage decreases. NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) such as diclofenac or ibuprofen, and antispasmodics like <b>butylscopolamine</b> are used. Although morphine may be administered to assist with emergency pain management, it is often not recommended as morphine is very addictive and raises ureteral pressure, worsening the condition. Oral narcotic medications are also often used. There is typically no antalgic position for the patient (lying down on the non-aching side and applying a hot bottle or towel to the area affected may help). Larger stones may require surgical intervention for their removal, such as shockwave lithotripsy, ureteroscopy and percutaneous nephrolithotomy.

Aim: To gain information on symptoms and their interpretation in patients self-treating abdominal cramping and pain with a spasmolytic (<b>butylscopolamine).</b> Method: 4, 680 questionnaires were distributed by 306 pharmacists in Germany to patients suffering from abdominal complaints and buying <b>butylscopolamine.</b> Key findings: Questionnaires from 1, 539 respondents were returned, and 1, 417 could be evaluated. Abdominal cramping was the major reason for buying <b>butylscopolamine.</b> Only a minority of respondents had consulted a general practitioner (27. 3 %) and even less a specialist (12. 5 %). Only a minority of subjects met expert criteria for irritable bowel syndrome (13 %). There was a large overlap between self-reported dysmenorrhoea and bowel symptoms (35 %). Conclusions: Real life conditions {{do not seem to}} be well covered by expert criteria. Differentiating bowel origin from uterine origin in pelvic pain syndromes seems especially problematic.

30|$|Half-Fourier single-shot RARE (HASTE) generates {{sequences}} with {{a strong}} T 2 -weighting. The acquisition times are short so breathing artefacts are minimal. Normal bowel wall has low signal intensity on HASTE images. Due to oedema (in inflammation), the signal intensity can increase. Flow artefacts due to peristaltic motion can occur with the HASTE sequence, but an anti-spasmolytic agent can be given to prevent this. To distinguish fat from oedema (both have high T 2 signal intensity), fat-suppression can be used. Balanced steady-state free precession (true-FISP) is a sequence that combines tissue contrast from both T 1 - and T 2 -weighting. The bowel wall has an intermediate to low signal intensity, and fluids have a high signal intensity. For this sequence no anti-peristaltic drugs are needed. T 1 -weighted sequences (VIBE) with intravenous contrast medium administration are performed to assess whether enhancing areas (with more perfusion) {{are present in the}} small bowel. This sequence is very sensitive to peristalsis so spasmolytics are mandatory. The authors use <b>butylscopolamine</b> bromide (Buscopan; Boehringer-Ingelheim, Ingelheim, Germany). <b>Butylscopolamine</b> bromide is not FDA-approved for this application, glucagon can be used as an alternative when Buscopan is contraindicated or not available.|$|E

40|$|TO THE EDITOR: Ceftriaxone is {{a widely}} used third-generation cephalo-sporin. Its {{precipitation}} in the gallbladder is a well-described cause of biliary lithiasis 1; however, ceftriaxone-associated nephrolithiasis {{has so far been}} reported 1 - 6 in only seven pediatric patients. We report the first case of probable ceftriaxone-induced obstructive nephrolithiasis in an adult with no apparent renal stone diathesis. Case Report. A 31 -year-old white man with no personal or family history of chole- or nephrolithiasis was hospitalized at our institution with acute cholecystitis and suspected septicemia from a biliary focus. Abdominal ultrasound demonstrat-ed cholecystitis with a single gallbladder concrement; the common bile duct, liver, pancreas, and kidneys appeared normal.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundEnterocutaneous fistulae, {{pathological}} {{communications between}} the intestinal lumen and the abdominal skin, can arise as serious complication of gastrointestinal surgery. A current non-surgical treatment for this pathology involves topical application of sub-atmospheric pressure, {{also known as}} vacuum assisted closure (VAC). While this technique appears to be promising, surgeons report {{a number of cases}} in which its application fails to achieve fistula closure. Here, we evaluate the fistula’s physical properties during the vacuum assisted closure process in a computational approach exploring the relevance of intraluminal intestinal pressure. MethodsA mathematical model formulated by differential equations based on tissue elasticity properties and principles of fluid mechanics was created and forcing functions were integrated to mimic intestinal pressure dynamics. A software to solve equations and to fit the model to experimentally obtained data was developed. This enabled simulations of vacuum assisted fistula closure under different intestinal pressure. ResultsThe simulation output indicates conditions, in which fistula closure can or cannot be expected suggesting favoured or impeded healing, respectively. When modifications of intestinal pressure, as observed in fistula accompanying pathologies, are integrated, the outcome of fistula closure changes considerably. Rise of intestinal pressure is associated with delay of fistula closure and temporary fistula radius augmentation, while reduction of intestinal pressure during sub-atmospheric pressure treatment contributes to a faster and direct fistula closure. ConclusionFrom the model predictions, we conclude that administration of intestinal pressure decreasing compounds (e. g. <b>butylscopolamine,</b> glucagon) may improve VAC treatment, while intestinal pressure increasing drugs should be avoided...|$|E
40|$|Background: A {{considerable}} number of patients admitted to {{the intensive care unit}} (ICU) die following withdrawal of mechanical ventilation. After discontinuation of ventilation without proper preparation, excessive respiratory secretion is common, resulting in a 'death rattle'. Post-extubation stridor can give rise to the relatives' perception that the patient is choking and suffering. Existing protocols lack adequate anticipatory preparation to respond to all distressing symptoms. Methods: We analyzed existing treatment strategies in distressing symptoms after discontinuation of mechanical ventilation. Conclusion: The actual period of discontinuation of mechanical ventilation can be very short, but thoughtful anticipation of distressing symptoms takes time. There is an ethical responsibility to anticipate and treat (iatrogenic) symptoms such as pain, dyspnea-associated respiratory distress, anxiety, delirium, post-extubation stridor, and excessive broncho-pulmonary secretions. This makes withdrawal of mechanical ventilation in ICU patients a thoughtful process, taking palliative actions instead of fast terminal actions. We developed a flowchart covering all possible distressing symptoms that can occur after withdrawal of mechanical ventilation and extubation. We recommend a two-phase process. Six hours before extubation, enteral feeding should be stopped and parenteral fluids reduced, overhydrated patients should be dehydrated with furosemide, administration of sedatives (for distress) and opioids (for pain and/or dyspnea) should be continued or started and methylprednisolone should be given in anticipation of stridor after extubation. Thirty minutes before extubation, <b>Butylscopolamine</b> should be given and methylprednisolone repeated. After this the patient should be extubated to secure a dying process as natural as possible with the lowest burden due to distress...|$|E
40|$|Most wild donkey breeds are {{currently}} endangered, {{such as the}} Asiatic and the African wild ass. Moreover, many domestic donkey breeds are vulnerable to extinction, such as the Martina Franca donkey in Italy, the Zamorano-Leonés donkey in Spain and the Normand donkey in France. Their preservation includes {{the creation of a}} Genome Resource Bank. Embryos cryopreservation allows the preservation of genetics from both male and female and is the fastest method to restore a breed. However, embryo production in vivo is limited in equids. In vitro production of embryos would allow the production of several embryos per cycle, but no technique has yet been developed in the donkey for in vitro production of embryos. In that context, ovum pick up (OPU) would come as a very helpful tool both for embryo production and research purposes. Our objective was to develop OPU in jennies and to analyze the chronology of in vitro maturation of donkey oocytes. Donkey cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were collected by OPU from 5 to 25 mm follicles in adult cyclic jennies. During OPU, jennies were injected detomidine, butorphanol, and <b>butylscopolamine</b> for sedation, analgesia and antispasmodia. COCs were in vitro matured in TCM 199 supplemented with fetal calf serum and epidermal growth factor for 24, 30, 34 or 38 hours in groups of 10 to 30 in an atmosphere of 5 % CO 2 in air at 38. 5 °C. Five OPU sessions were performed, with 3 to 6 females per session. We collected a total of 92 COCs out of 193 follicles (48 %) with an average of 4. 2 COCs per jenny. The recovery rate per follicle increased along the OPU sessions: 34 %, 43 %, 52 %, 47 % and 56 %, probably due to the increasing skill of the staff. Despite a very large experience with OPU in horses, all staff members required some time to adjust to the specificities of the jenny vs mare, in particular to the differences in holding the ovary. All COCs were expanded after over 24 hours in vitro maturation (IVM). At collection, jennies COCs contained a germinal vesicle. After 24 hours IVM, COCs contained either a germinal vesicle or condensed chromatin. Metaphase 1 oocytes were observed after 30 hours IVM and 45 % were in metaphase 2 after 34 hours IVM. Half of the COCs were degenerating after 38 hours IVM. In conclusion, we established for the first time conditions for ovum pick up in jennies and the chronology of in vitro maturation of donkey oocytes. We showed that in vitro maturation of donkey oocytes can produce 44 % of metaphase 2 oocytes after 34 hours in culture while most equine oocytes reach metaphase 2 after 30 hours in culture.

All patients from day 3 after placement began liquid diet and were discharged home on day 4 on a 1000 kcal diet (carbohydrate 146 g, lipid 68 g, protein 1 g/kg ideal weight). After 6 months, the Heliosphere Bag was removed. The patients were followed monthly, and complications and their treatment, post-placement symptoms, BMI and %EWL were recorded. Data were expressed as mean +/- SD. RESULTS: From Sept-Dec 2004, 10 patients (5 M/ 5 F) underwent Heliosphere Bag placement, with age 35. 2 +/- 15. 7 years (17 - 49), BMI 43. 3 +/- 8. 1 kg/m(2) (35 - 51. 2), and weight 126. 8 +/- 23. 7 kg (98. 4 - 148). Heliosphere Bag positioning was quite difficult in all patients due to low pliancy and large size of the bag, causing patient discomfort. System failure at time of Heliosphere Bag positioning was observed in 5 / 10 patients (50 %). At time of removal, the Heliosphere Bag was not found in the stomach in one patient. In 3 other patients, the balloon was found partially deflated. At the time of balloon removal after 6 months, BMI was 37. 4 +/- 13. 4 (28. 9 - 42. 1) and %EWL was 29. 1 +/- 20. 1 (9. 0 - 57. 4). BMI loss was 5. 2 +/- 13. 1 (1. 9 - 11. 2) and mean weight loss was 17. 5 +/- 16. 2 kg (5 - 33). CONCLUSIONS: Although weight loss was satisfactory, this device cannot be considered an advance for the temporary treatment of morbid obesity. This balloon still has some instrumental and technical problems that need to be solved: high rate of system failure at positioning, high rate of spontaneous deflation, absence of a marker such as methylene blue, and large size with low pliability that cause significant patient discomfort...|$|E
