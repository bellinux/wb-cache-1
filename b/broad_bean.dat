5|$|Bruchus rufimanus, {{commonly}} known as the <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> weevil, <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> beetle, or <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> seed beetle is a weevil which inhabits crops and fields, as well as some homes. It is a pest of faba beans (Vicia faba L.).The adult weevils feed on pollen, while their larvae tunnel in seeds destroying crops and moving on to new ones once they dry out. The adult beetle, being one of the biggest of its genus, ranges from 3 to 5mm in length.|$|E
5|$|The <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> weevil, B. rufimanus is univoltine. It reproduces {{in spring}} in faba bean crops, lays eggs {{on the young}} pods, {{develops}} in the growing seeds and overwinters as adults in shelters, or in diapause as larva or pupa diapause in the stored seeds.|$|E

500|$|From the 8th century on, the Slavs in Poland {{increasingly}} organized {{themselves in}} larger structures known as [...] "great tribes," [...] either through voluntary or forced association. The population was primarily involved in agricultural pursuits. Fields were cultivated {{as well as}} gardens within settlements. Plowing was done using oxen and wooden plows reinforced with iron. Forest burning was used to increase the arable area, but also to provide fertilizer, as the ashes lasted in that capacity for several seasons. Rotation of crops was practiced {{as well as the}} winter/spring crop system. After several seasons of exploitation, the land was being left idle to regain fertility. Wheat, millet and rye were most important crops; other cultivated plant species included oat, barley, pea, <b>broad</b> <b>bean,</b> lentil, flax and hemp, as well as apple, pear, plum, peach and cherry trees in fruit orchards. Beginning in the 8th century, swine gradually became economically more important than cattle; sheep, goats, horses, dogs, cats, chickens, geese and ducks were also kept. The agricultural practices of the Slavs are known from archeological research, which documents progressive increases over time in arable area and resulting deforestation, and from written reports provided by Ibrahim ibn Yaqub, a 10th-century Jewish traveler. Ibrahim described also other features of Slavic life, for example the use of steam baths. The existence of bath structures has been confirmed by archeology. An anonymous Arab writer from the turn of the 10th century mentions that the Slavic people made an alcoholic beverage out of honey and their celebrations were accompanied by music played on the lute, tambourines and wind instruments.|$|E
2500|$|Broad beans {{which are}} called bagilla (باگله/باقله) in the Iraqi dialect of Arabic {{are a common}} {{ingredient}} in many Iraqi foods. One {{of the most popular}} Iraqi dishes that uses the <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> is bagilla bel-dehen (باگله بالدهن) also called tashreeb bagilla (تشريب باگله). This dish is a common breakfast dish in Iraq and consists of broad beans, bread, and fried eggs all cooked together in cooking oil. Fool (فول) is another common breakfast dish in Iraq as well as many other Arab countries and consists of mashed fava beans. Some other dishes introduced to Iraq from neighboring countries also use the <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> such as timmen bagilla (تمن باگاه) which translates to <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> rice. Timmen bagilla is originally an Iranian dish although it is also common in some parts of Iraq.

2500|$|Broad beans (Amharic: baqella) {{are one of}} {{the most}} popular legumes in Ethiopia. They are tightly coupled with every aspect of Ethiopian life. They are mainly used as an {{alternative}} to peas to prepare a flour called shiro, which is used to make shiro wot (a stew almost ubiquitous in Ethiopian dishes). During the fasting period in the Ethiopian Orthodox Church tradition called Tsome Filliseta, Tsome arbeå, Tsome Tahsas, and Tsome Hawaria (which are in August, end of February–April, mid-November–beginning of January and June–July), two uncooked spicy vegetable dishes are made using broad beans. [...] The first is Hilibet, a thin, white paste of <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> flour mixed with pieces of onion, green pepper, garlic, and other spices based on personal taste. The second is siljo, a fermented, sour, spicy thin yellow paste of <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> flour. Both are served with other stews and injera (a pancake-like bread) during lunch and dinner.|$|E

2500|$|In Italy, {{broad beans}} are {{traditionally}} sown on November 2, All Souls Day. Small cakes {{made in the}} shape of broad beans (though not out of them) are known as fave dei morti or [...] "beans of the dead". According to tradition, Sicily once experienced a failure of all crops other than the beans; the beans kept the population from starvation, and thanks were given to Saint Joseph. Broad beans subsequently became traditional on Saint Joseph's Day altars in many Italian communities. Some people carry a <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> for good luck; some believe that if one carries a <b>broad</b> <b>bean,</b> one will never be without the essentials of life. In Rome, on the first of May, Roman families traditionally eat fresh fava beans with Pecorino Romano cheese during a daily excursion in the Campagna. In northern Italy, on the contrary, fava beans are traditionally fed to animals and some people, especially the elderly, might frown on human consumption. But in Liguria, a maritime region near northern Italy, fava beans are loved raw, and consumed fresh in early spring as the first product of the garden, alone or with fresh Pecorino Sardo or with local salami from Sant'Olcese. In some Central Italian regions, a once-popular and recently rediscovered fancy food is the bagiana, a soup of fresh or dried fava beans seasoned with onions and beet leaves stir-fried, before being added to the soup, in olive oil and lard (or bacon or cured ham fat).|$|E
2500|$|<b>Broad</b> <b>beans,</b> or [...] "Baghalee" [...] (Persian: باقالی) are {{primarily}} cultivated {{in the central}} and north parts of Iran.

However, <b>broad</b> <b>beans</b> have a very short season (roughly two weeks). The season is usually in the middle of spring. When people have access to fresh beans in season, they cook them in brine and then add vinegar and Heracleum persicum depending on taste. They also make an extra amount to dry to be used year round. The dried beans can be cooked with rice, which forms {{one of the most famous}} dishes in north of Iran (Gilan) called baghalee polo (Persian: باقالی پلو) which means [...] "rice with broad beans".

2500|$|Bourke writes that:Murray's {{strength}} is the dramatization of general {{ideas and the}} description of animals, machines, or landscape. At times his immense self-confidence produces garrulity and sweeping, dismissive prescriptions.

In these poems Murray invariably explores social questions through a celebration of common objects from the natural world, as in [...] "The <b>Broad</b> <b>Bean</b> Sermon", or machines, as in [...] "Machine Portraits with Pendant Spaceman". Always concerned with a [...] "common reader", Murray's later poetry (for example, Dog Fox Field, 1990, Translations from the Natural World, 1992) recovers [...] "populist" [...] conventions of newspaper verse, singsong rhyme, and doggerel.|$|E
