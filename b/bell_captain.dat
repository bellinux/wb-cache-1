500|$|Despite the Vansant incident, beaches {{along the}} Jersey Shore {{remained}} open. Sightings of large sharks swarming {{off the coast}} of New Jersey were reported by sea captains entering the ports of Newark and New York City but were dismissed. The second major attack occurred 45miles (72km) north of Beach Haven at the resort town of Spring Lake, New Jersey. The victim was Charles Bruder, 27, a Swiss <b>bell</b> <b>captain</b> at the Essex & Sussex Hotel. Bruder was killed on Thursday, July 6, 1916, while swimming 130yards (120m) from shore. A shark bit him in the abdomen and severed his legs; Bruder's blood turned the water red. After hearing screams, a woman notified two lifeguards that a canoe with a red hull had capsized and was floating just at the water's surface. Lifeguards Chris Anderson and George White rowed to Bruder in a lifeboat and realized he had been bitten by a shark. They pulled him from the water, but he bled to death on the way to shore. According to The New York Times, [...] "women [...] panic-stricken [...] as [...] mutilated body... brought ashore." [...] Guests and workers at the Essex & Sussex and neighboring hotels raised money for Bruder's mother in Switzerland.|$|E

500|$|In 1959, Lawrence Wien, {{owner of}} New York City's Plaza Hotel {{purchased}} the hotel, but signed a management deal for Clark {{to remain as}} manager. In the early 1960s, the mafia-financed casino hotels of the Las Vegas Strip and Nevada came under close scrutiny by the FBI, and they placed increased pressure on the Nevada Gaming Control Board to force the mobsters out of Las Vegas. After Sam Giancana was spotted on the premises of Frank Sinatra's Cal Neva Lodge & Casino at Lake Tahoe, his gambling license was removed by the Board and {{he was forced to}} sell up and forfeit his share in the Sands Hotel and Casino. The Desert Inn faced similar scrutiny by the FBI, attracting controversy at the same time for the involvement of Dalitz and his mobster associates, but simultaneously called for the prosecution of the FBI for illegal wiretapping. In 1964, Clark sold his remaining share in the hotel to Dalitz and business associates Morris Kleinman, Thomas McGinty and Sam Tucker. He {{died of a heart attack}} the following year. The <b>bell</b> <b>captain</b> of the Desert Inn, Jack Butler, remembered Clark: [...] "Wilbur was the greatest guy. Without him this town never would've got off the ground.
