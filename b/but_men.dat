5|$|During World War I, {{in which}} Portugal joined the Allies, Caldas {{had one of}} three {{internment}} camps in the country. In 1916, most Germans in Portugal were deported, <b>but</b> <b>men</b> aged 15–45 were imprisoned to prevent their joining the German military. Originally, all of the approximately 700 prisoners were shipped to Angra do Heroísmo, on Terceira Island in the Azores, where they were held at the Fortress of São João Baptista. In 1918, to reduce overcrowding at the fortress, 168 internees were moved to Caldas, where they stayed in military barracks located at the Parque D. Carlos I (Pavilhões do Parque). The prisoners were released the following year, {{after the end of}} the war.|$|E

25|$|The 1918 Armistice with Germany ended World War I. The {{end of the}} war, however, {{produced}} some major changes. From a training field producing mechanics and gunners, Selfridge became a pursuit (fighter) field, <b>but</b> <b>men</b> who had enlisted {{for the duration of}} the war were being discharged, and no new students were being trained.|$|E
25|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that the main purpose for Plato in using myths was didactic. He considered {{that only a few}} people were capable or interested in following a reasoned philosophical discourse, <b>but</b> <b>men</b> in general are attracted by stories and tales. Consequently then, he used the myth to convey the conclusions of the philosophical reasoning. Some of Plato's myths were based in traditional ones, others were modifications of them, and finally he also invented altogether new myths.|$|E

25|$|On December 16, 1922, {{a meeting}} {{was held to}} {{announce}} the Ladies Ontario Hockey Association was formed. The organization was structured similarly to the Ontario Women's Softball Association in which women would run the organization <b>but</b> <b>men</b> served in an advisory capacity. During the December 16 meeting, Frank McEwen, president of the Toronto Hockey League, presided over the meeting. Members from ladies clubs in London, Ontario and St. Thomas, Ontario were present. A letter from the Ottawa Alerts ladies club was presented, indicating their interest to join.|$|E
25|$|The {{fact that}} the presidents were not habitually either magistrates or lawyers, <b>but</b> <b>men</b> clad in sword and cape, caused {{that they did not}} have any vote in court cases, and the court did not submit to their authority, but in {{representation}} that of the king. Thus, the authority of the president, when he was not a magistrate, was void in judicial matter and merely signed the verdicts. The Audiencias chaired by the viceroy were called viceregal Audiencias, and the chaired ones by a governor-captain general were the pretorial Audiencias.|$|E
25|$|A {{small number}} of enclitics (approximately eight) differ in form based on {{the gender of the}} speaker. Yeló (men) ye (women) mark mild assertions. Kštó (women only {{according}} to most sources) marks strong assertion.

He is used by both genders to mark direct questions, <b>but</b> <b>men</b> also use hųwó in more formal situations. So (men) and se (women) mark dubitative questions (where the person being asked is not assumed to know the answer).|$|E

25|$|At the King of the Ring, Mabel, {{one half}} of the Men on a Mission tag team, won the eponymous tournament, {{defeating}} Savio Vega in the finals. After the match Mabel and his partner Mo assaulted Razor Ramon, who was at ringside supporting Vega during the match. The 1–2–3 Kid also returned and tried to help Ramon, <b>but</b> <b>Men</b> on a Mission had the upper hand. The assault on Ramon further injured his ribs after suffering an injury on June 9, 1995. The attack led to a tag team match at the second In Your House pay-per-view, with Ramon and Vega teaming up to take on Men on a Mission.|$|E
25|$|Bronze Age rock carvings {{may contain}} {{some of the}} {{earliest}} depictions of well-known gods from the later Norse mythology. A common figure in these rock carvings is that of a male figure carrying what appears to be an axe or hammer. This may have been an early representation of Thor. Other male figures are shown holding a spear. Whether this is a representation of Odin or Týr is not known. It is possible the figure may have been a representation of Tyr, as one example of a Bronze Age rock carving appears to show a figure missing a hand. A figure holding a bow may be an early representation of Ullr. Or it is possible that these figures were not gods at all, <b>but</b> <b>men</b> brandishing the weapons of their culture.|$|E
25|$|According to {{results from}} the fifth wave of the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study, which interviewed over 14,000 people about their sexual orientation, 94.2% of New Zealanders {{identify}} as heterosexual, 2.6% as gay or lesbian, 1.8% as bisexual, 0.6% as bicurious, 0.5% as pansexual, and 0.3% as asexual. No gender {{differences were found in}} the share of New Zealanders identifying as heterosexual (94.1% of men and 94.4% of women) or pansexual (0.5% of both men and women), <b>but</b> <b>men</b> were more likely to identify as gay (3.5%) than women (1.8%), and women were {{more likely than men to}} identify as bisexual (2.1% versus 1.5%), bicurious (0.7% v. 0.4%) and asexual (0.4% v. 0.1%). Women in all the non-heterosexual categories were significantly younger than women in the heterosexual category. Men in the gay, bisexual, and bicurious categories categories were also significantly younger than heterosexual men.|$|E

25|$|Though not {{all women}} are {{politicians}} or war generals, boys are {{raised in the}} domestic sphere. Not only that, <b>but</b> <b>men</b> come back to it every day in their private homes. Even President Theodore Roosevelt can be quoted to say “o man {{can be a good}} citizen who is not a good husband and a good father.” Similar to how history needs domestic history incorporated into it, men’s history cannot be understood without their private experiences known. Women’s history thus needs their private experiences to be combined with their public. To successfully integrate these histories, the world must not have male and female spheres that are synonyms for the private and public. The connections found in public and private men’s and women’s history need to be systematically synthesized to successfully integrate them. So the idea of just two histories creates the challenge that most feminist historians have.|$|E
25|$|According to {{a saying}} {{attributed}} to Muhammad in the hadith Sahih Bukhari, women {{are allowed to}} go to mosques. However, as Islam spread, Muslim authorities stressed the fears of unchastity from interaction between sexes outside their home, including the mosque. By pre-modern period it was unusual for women to pray at a mosque. By the late 1960s, women in urban areas of the Middle East increasingly began praying in the mosque, <b>but</b> <b>men</b> and women generally worship separately. (Muslims explain this by citing the need to avoid distraction during prayer prostrations that raise the buttocks while the forehead touches the ground.) Separation between sexes ranges from men and women on opposite sides of an aisle, to men in front of women (as {{was the case in the}} time of Muhammad), to women in second-floor balconies or separate rooms accessible by a door for women only. Women in the state of ritual impurity, such as menstruation, are forbidden from entering the prayer hall of the mosque.|$|E
25|$|In direct {{contrast}} to German philosophy, which descends from heaven to earth, here we ascend from earth to heaven. That is to say, {{we do not}} set out from what men say, imagine, conceive, nor from men as narrated, thought of, imagined, conceived, in order to arrive at men in the flesh. We set out from real, active men, and {{on the basis of}} their real life process we demonstrate the development of the ideological reflexes and echoes of this life process. The phantoms formed in the human brain are also, necessarily, sublimates of their material life process, which is empirically verifiable and bound to material premises. Morality, religion, metaphysics, all the rest of ideology and their corresponding forms of consciousness, thus no longer retain the semblance of independence. They have no history, no development; <b>but</b> <b>men,</b> developing their material production and their material intercourse, alter, along with this, their real existence, their thinking, and the products of their thinking. Life is not determined by consciousness, but consciousness by life.|$|E

25|$|Parka cover or Kuspuk (qaspeq in Yup'ik and Cup'ik, qasper in Cup'ig) is a {{traditional}} Yup'ik garment, worn in both casual and formal settings in Alaska. It is worn by both men and women, <b>but</b> <b>men</b> usually wear a kuspuk only for ceremonial such as Eskimo dancing (yuraq) or formal occasions, while for women it is common casual clothing, even among non-Yup'iks. The kuspuk is, in essence, a long-sleeved overshirt with a hood. Trim, often rickrack, edges the hood, sleeves, and the single large pocket in the front. A typical kuspuk for women has a print (usually floral), whereas a man's is a solid color. Female versions also may include a skirt of varying length (making the garment more technically a dress rather than a top), or may have no skirt at all. Traditional Yup'ik style kuspuks vary widely among villages. Colloquially, the skirted version is called Kuskokwim style kuspuk, while the skirtless type is called Yukon style kuspuk. The name of a school district (Kuspuk School District offices are located in Aniak) is derived from kuspuk.|$|E
25|$|Maecenas endeavoured also {{to divert}} the less {{masculine}} genius of Propertius from harping continually on his love to themes of public interest, an effort which to some extent backfired in the ironic elegies of Book III. But if the motive of his patronage had been merely political, it never could have inspired the affection which it did in its recipients. The great charm of Maecenas in his relation to the men of genius who formed his circle was his simplicity, cordiality and sincerity. Although not particular {{in the choice of}} some of the associates of his pleasures, he admitted none <b>but</b> <b>men</b> of worth to his intimacy, and when once admitted they were treated like equals. Much of the wisdom of Maecenas probably lives in the Satires and Epistles of Horace. It has fallen to the lot of no other patron of literature to have his name associated with works of such lasting interest as the Georgics of Virgil, the first three books of Horace's Odes, and the first book of his Epistles.|$|E
25|$|The Marii {{were the}} {{inherited}} clients of the Caecilii Metelli and a Caecilius Metellus had aided Marius' {{campaign for the}} tribunate. Although {{he seems to have}} had a break with the Metelli {{as a result of the}} laws he passed while tribune, the rupture was not permanent, since in 109 BC Quintus Caecilius Metellus took Marius with him as his legate on his campaign against Jugurtha. Legates (legati) were originally simply envoys sent by the Senate, <b>but</b> <b>men</b> appointed as legates by the Senate were used by generals as subordinate commanders, usually becoming the general's most trusted lieutenant. Hence, Metellus had to have asked the Senate to appoint Marius as legate to allow him to serve as Metellus' subordinate. In Sallust's long account of Metellus' campaign no other legates are mentioned, so it is assumed that Marius was Metellus's senior subordinate and right-hand man. Thus Metellus was using Marius' military experience, while Marius was strengthening his position to run for the consulship. The rupture in 119 BC may have been exaggerated after the fact in light of his later and much more serious disagreement with Metellus about Numidia.|$|E
