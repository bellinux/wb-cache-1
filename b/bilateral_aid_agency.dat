However, in the current situation of Cambodia, there seems to be several controversial issues which might be an indirect cause of the structural violence, such as aid-dependency, economic disparity between the urban rich and the rural and urban poor, and corruption of the Cambodian government. It is my contention that educational development assistance by JICA may have also negatively influenced peacebuilding and post-conflict reconstruction. Therefore, this study aims to explore and understand if Japanese foreign aid and JICA's support to Cambodian educational development is truly being positive peace or can it be said to be an indirect cause of structural violence.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effectiveness of}} Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), as an implementing agency {{of the government of}} Japan in advancing technical cooperation between Zimbabwe and Japan (1980 - 2012) to normalize relations. The study employs the qualitative methodology to discover the underlying motives using context specific settings and the perspective of the social actors themselves on Zimbabwe-Japanâ€Ÿs technical cooperation. During the decade of socio-economic and political challenges (1998 - 2008), Zimbabwe was isolated from mainstream international development by the international community. Zimbabwe-Japan relations slumped in 2000 when Japan suspended technical cooperation except for humanitarian aid as the West had imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe following the Fast Track Land Reform Programme (FTLRP). Zimbabwe adopted the Look East Policy as China willingly stepped in to fill the foreign aid gap left by the West. Japanâ€Ÿs policies have always been made within the framework of US hegemony. Indeed, JICAâ€Ÿs technical cooperation has been constrained by the Zimbabwe-Japan diplomatic tiff. Zimbabweâ€Ÿs prospects of developing are shaped by a range of issues from domestic governance and politics to externally driven issues such as foreign aid. Therefore technical assistance is an indispensable tool for Japan to co-exist and prosper {{with the rest of the}} world including Zimbabwe. Unique to Japan among the industrialized powers, Official Development Assistance (ODA) constitutes its chief foreign policy instrument given her constitutional constraints on military engagement. Japanâ€Ÿs technical assistance is founded on the core principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other states. JICA as a <b>bilateral</b> <b>aid</b> <b>agency</b> mediates between Japan and Zimbabweâ€Ÿs for preference alignment since all technical cooperation progammes require some agreement for them to be implemented. Thus JICAâ€Ÿs technical cooperation has significant power to encourage economic growth in Zimbabwe and Japan as well as deepening mutual relations. Japan employs the carrot and stick policy on its technical assistance to Zimbabwe by encouraging the inclusive governmentâ€Ÿs efforts towards democratization. The analysis suggest that Zimbabwe-Japanâ€Ÿs technical cooperation is heavily influenced by the two countries own historical background, development trajectories, international events in the increasingly crowded and ever changing international system, amongst others. Japan seeks to establish a more significant presence in Zimbabwe as reinforced by JICAâ€Ÿs focus on infrastructure, agriculture and basic social services. Zimbabwe-Japanâ€Ÿs technical cooperation is a mixed bag of win-win approach and the metropolis and satellite relations which can be viewed broadly as a function of the interplay between economic power and asymmetric interdependence on the one hand and culture and diplomacy on the other...|$|E

40|$|Foreign aid is {{intended}} to be a major contributor to poverty reduction. However, significant questions arise as to the capacity for development funding to contribute to human development, through service provision, through advocacy, through actions and interventions that change power relations, change the social and institutional arrangements that reinforce inequality, threaten or reproduce well-being, and prevent the fulfillment of human rights. In conjunction with questions about what aid “does,” there is equal focus on how it does it. Questions of efficiency, effectiveness, transparency, accountability, social license to operate, relevance, and many others are all embedded in contemporary aid discourse and practice. The aim of this volume was to contribute to a critical understanding of Impact Assessment (IA) clearly informed by contemporary development theory and practice. There is a significantly increasing push for impact assessment, across the whole aid architecture. This is exacerbated by a much stronger focus on value for money, and accountability – to taxpayers specifically in the context of public funds, and donors in an increasingly competitive NGO environment. As was noted by many authors, since the GFC, a significant number of donor governments have reduced or are considering funding reduction for <b>bilateral</b> <b>aid</b> <b>agencies</b> and their contributions to multilateral <b>aid</b> <b>agencies.</b> At the same time they imposed a more stringent and rigorous requirement focusing on “aid-for-trade” and “value-for-money” strategies.

We then document trends in the global distribution of environmental aid over time and show that environmental aid has increasingly focussed on global environmental issues (especially climate change), rather than local issues in recipient countries. Somewhat surprisingly, we also find that environmental aid is increasingly allocated through <b>bilateral</b> <b>aid</b> <b>agencies</b> rather than through the increasing number of multilateral channels created for this purpose. After providing these descriptive statistics and demonstrating trends, we offer a tentative explanation for this puzzling pattern. We argue that each individual aid project represents a negotiation between donor and recipient. This additional level of bargaining significantly conditions {{the costs and benefits of}} multilateralism for donors, especially as recipients have multiple outside options for obtaining development finance. Reflecting the growing political salience of global environmental threats, donors are providing increasing levels of environmental aid, and especially climate finance. However, at the same time, donors are increasingly failing to co-ordinate their allocation of climate finance (and other environmental aid) within multilateral institutions. At a practical level, this raises the question whether the effect of increasing levels of funding will be undercut by decreasing co-ordination and efficiency...|$|R

It builds upon a selection of relevant and practical papers and presentations given at the 2 nd International Conference on Evaluating Climate Change and Development held in Washington DC in 2014 and includes perspectives from independent evaluations of the major international organisations supporting climate action in developing countries, such as the Global Environment Facility. The first section of the book sets the stage and provides an overview of independent evaluations, carried out by multilateral development banks and development organisations. Important topics include how policies and organisations aim to achieve impact and how this is measured, whether climate change is mainstreamed into other development programs, and whether operations are meeting the urgency of climate change challenges. The following sections focus on evaluation of climate change projects and policies as they link to development, from the perspective of international organisations, NGO’s, multilateral and <b>bilateral</b> <b>aid</b> <b>agencies,</b> and academia.

Aid intermediaries have become increasingly important as connecting link between donors and recipients. Their heterogeneous group comprises <b>bilateral</b> <b>aid</b> <b>agencies,</b> multilateral organizations, private foundations, public-private partnerships and international non-governmental organizations. Institutions, as rules of the aid game, constrain the actions of aid intermediaries and influence transaction costs and incentives for the organizations. The process of aid allocation is portrayed in two repeated sequential games with two players, the donor and the aid intermediary. Donors pursue an array of goals by donating financial resources, while aid intermediaries aim at securing funding in order to guarantee their organizational survival. Donors use indicators to assess the performance of an aid intermediary. Trustworthiness is a crucial factor prior to any experience. The strategic choice of the intermediary depends on the financial importance of the donor. A small-scale donor expects qualitative information about achievements, whereas a large-scale donor asks for quantitative results. The intermediary tries to ensure funding in the long-run without compromising its often charitable motives {{too much in the}} short-run. Although the aid intermediary decides the aid-financed health intervention, the donor has an indirect but powerful voice in the aid allocation process thanks to the importance of funding...|$|R
40|$|RURAL CREDIT MARKETS {{have been}} at the center of policy {{intervention}} in developing countries over the past forty years. Many governments, sup-ported by multilateral and <b>bilateral</b> <b>aid</b> <b>agencies,</b> have devoted considerable resources to supplying cheap credit to farmers in a myriad of institutional settings. The results of many of these interventions have been disappointing. Despite high levels of subsidy to rural credit in the Asian countries surveyed in this part of the book, many farmers-especially small farmers-depend for credit on moneylenders whose interest rates remain extremely high. (See table 2 - 1.) One explanation for the failure of public credit institutions to drive out the traditional moneylender or drive down the interest rates charged must be that public policies were based on an inadequate under-standing of the workings of rural credit markets. There typically exists a dual rural credit market in developing countries. In the formal credit market, institutions provide intermediation between depositors (or the government) and lenders and charge relatively low rates of interest that usually are government-subsidized. In informal credit markets, money is lent by private individuals-professional moneylenders, traders, commission agents, landlords, friends, and relatives-generally out of their own equity. The objective of this chapter is to provide a framework for assessing the relationship between the formal and informal sectors of rural credit markets and the consequences of government interventions in formal credit markets...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} what drives {{success in the}} implementation of international reconstruction and development aid projects in a post-conflict environment. It poses three key questions: 1) How important is the national government's support for project success in post-conflict reconstruction and development? 2) What role does donor coordination on the ground play for project success? and 3) What other factors explain project success? To address these questions, I design and test a novel explanatory model of effective project implementation in post-conflict reconstruction and development, using an original data set of 124 projects undertaken by six major multilateral and <b>bilateral</b> <b>aid</b> <b>agencies</b> in Afghanistan during 2002 - 2008. Study results highlight two factors that appear to consistently influence project success: the national government’s support, and the quality of project leadership (i. e project manager or project coordinator) on the international project implementation side. Most interestingly, the combination of national government’s support and strong project leadership considerably increases the likelihood of project success, as well as the level of success achieved. Donor coordination arrangements made at the stage of project implementation appear to be a generally weak predictor of project success. The qualitative findings of the study illustrate in what way various project success factors in the model impact on project success. Notably, they identify and add to the conventional 'instrumental' qualities of leadership the qualities of 'moral' leadership, such as ability to build trust and respect with national counterparts based on the record of competence, dedication, and delivery.

This case study attempts to trace {{the reasons for the}} boom and the factors that have contributed to the slump in windfarm development in these two states.

40|$|I {{would like}} to take up Anna Gelpern’s {{invitation}} to define the study of Law and Development broadly and to reject the presumption that the inquiry will focus narrowly on the law-related projects of <b>bilateral</b> <b>aid</b> <b>agencies</b> and international organizations. I am interested in the relationship between law on the one hand and, on the other hand, development (however defined), and it is not clear to me that externally directed “Law and Development” projects are always central to understanding that relationship. (Isn’t that a reasonable inference to draw from all of the studies that question the impact of those projects?) Don’t get me wrong, I think it is often crucially important to take foreign actors into account when trying to understand where the “law” part of the equation comes from, as well as what factors besides law might be influencing development. But I am skeptical of the notion that foreign actors are always central to the story, especially in some of the larger developing countries; do we really understand the legal systems of Brazil, India, and China best by focusing on the components influenced by the World Bank and the IMF? As far as the future of Law and Development is concerned, I believe that it will and should involve becoming even more of a social science. I also believe, however, that the contributions to this Symposium have identified many of the pitfalls that lie in that direction. To begin with, there are obviously methodological questions about what empirical methods are best suited to uncovering the kinds of causal relationships between law and social outcomes we are looking for and theoretical questions about what legal and social variables ought to be measured. But I think that there are even more profound questions to be asked about the entire enterprise, especially if the purpose is to give policymakers insights into “what works. ...|$|R

Tariffs have been drastically reduced and vast transnational corporations have systematically replaced national corporations that catered for the domestic economy.

If conventional wisdom held true, then the world should have been transformed into a veritable paradise. Poverty, unemployment, malnutrition, homelessness, disease and environmental disruption should be but vat!ue memories of an underdeveloped past. But, to the contrary, these problems have become more serious and more widespread. The service delivery and social welfare ideals of the traditional nation states seem to be far from being realised. This article explores reasons why the signing of the Uruguay Round of General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATI) by Governments has further stalled the envisaged accelerated global economic growth and development through the gobalisation process, by removing all constraints on trade, regardless of social, ecological and moral implications. Instead of accepting the incontrovertible empirical evidence that economic globalisation will only increase many of the problems that face the world today, governments under pressure from transnational corporations insist on pursuing it further. To solve these problems, society will have to follow almost the very opposite path. Instead of seeking to create a single global economy controlled by vast and ever less controllable transnational corporations, it should seek to create a diversity of loosely linked, community-based economies managed by much smaller companies and catering above all (though not exclusively) for local or regional markets. It is not economic globalisation that society should aim for but the reverse, economic localisation to counter-balance today's substantially unfettered globalisation...|$|R

This kind of emphasis points to reforming current policies, rules and conditionalities in international trade, finance, investment, intellectual property rights and aid. WTO processes should become more transparent and participatory and the Organisation’s mandate on non-trade issues needs to be reconsidered. The global financial architecture also requires reform, {{especially with regard to}} capital flows and investment. Goal 8 of the MDGs, Develop a global partnership for development, is critical to the over-all scheme of the Millennium Declaration, as it is the only goal devoted entirely to international relations.

More importantly, many policies that used to be made solely or primarily at the national level are now very significantly influenced or shaped at international fora and by international institutions. This applies especially to those developing coun-tries that depend on the international financial institutions for loans and debt restructuring and have to abide by loan conditionalities. However, it also applies to most developing countries that are members of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), as they are obliged to align or realign national laws and policies to be in line with the WTO’s legally binding agreements. Thus, the “external economic environ-ment ” (comprising global economic structures and trends and the policies determined or influenced by international agencies such as the IMF, the World Bank, WTO, the UN and developed-country groupings such as the Group of Eight, OECD and <b>bilateral</b> <b>aid</b> <b>agencies)</b> has tremendous impact on a typical developing country. 127 1 Martin Khor is Drector of the Third World Network and has written extensively on trade, liberalisation and globalisation...|$|R
40|$|The role {{of local}} organisations in {{sustainable}} development The roles of local organisations in poverty reduction and environmental management All poverty reduction is local. This {{is easy to}} forget given how discussion and debate on the subject is dominated by <b>bilateral</b> <b>aid</b> <b>agencies,</b> development banks, national governments and international NGOs. But regardless of higher level commitments and decisions, what actually happens {{on the ground in}} particular localities is what makes the difference. Many barriers to poverty reduction are local — local power structures, land owning patterns and anti-poor politicians, bureaucracies and regulations. Much of what the poor require — schools, healthcare, water and sanitation, land, social safety nets, getting onto voter registers — must be obtained from local organisations within this local context. Local organisations have a major role in addressing these realities, helping poor groups access entitlements and engage with government. They may be local NGOs, grassroots organisations of the poor, or even local governments or branches of higher levels of government. But they function on a local level, have intimate knowledge of the local context and should be accountable to local people. Many operate on very small budgets, outside the main funding flows and frameworks. Yet they are not isolated from larger governance issues; indeed, much pro-poor political change has been catalysed by local innovations and by political pressure from grassroots organisations and their associations. This publication is one in a series of case studies and synthesis papers looking at the work of local organisations in development and environmental management. These publications were developed in collaboration with the local organisations they profile. They seek to encourage international funding agencies to rethink the means by which they can support, work with and learn from the local organisations that are such a critical part of pro-poor development.

40|$|There {{is growing}} enthusiasm amongst analysts of global health for the {{possibilities}} opened {{up by the}} rapid spread of mobile phone coverage. This includes substantially increasing access to health-related information and advice and to expert medical consultations. Some argue we are reaching a tipping point in the organisation of health systems in which new technology will drive new organisational arrangements (Christensen, Grossman and Hwang 2009; Bloom and Standing 2008). This is encouraging investment by foundations and <b>bilateral</b> <b>aid</b> <b>agencies</b> {{in the development of}} e-health and m-health as a way to improve access to health services in low- and middle-income countries. As with the introduction and spread of any new technology, {{there are a number of}} possible outcomes – or pathways – with different implications for the types of service provided and the distribution of benefits in the short and longer term. A recent STEPS Centre publication (2010) proposes the following characteristics of the way a technological innovation is spread: the direction of development and the way organisations incorporate the new technology into their operations; the distribution of benefits from the technology and the diversity of ways the technology is applied. It argues that the actual pathway of development is strongly influenced by political processes, involving a number of stakeholders with differing interests and understandings. A number of analysts argue that health systems are particularly path-dependent because of the importance that people give to arrangements they believe protect them from serious health problems (Bloom and Standing 2008). Lee and Lansky (2008), for example, suggest that resistance by stakeholders and complex regulatory barriers are substantially diminishing the impact of new technologies on the organisation of the American health system. Because of the path-dependent nature of the health sector, decisions made early in the emergence of a new technology are likely to have a strong and lasting influence (Bloom and Wolcott 2013).

Yet in the Arab world (and beyond) many different groups and individuals - as scholars, as charity and welfare providers, and as religious or political activists - work to empower women based on Islamic arguments and references. Islamic women's activism is an important complement to traditional liberal/secular women's activism, not least because in many cases it enjoys a wider local legitimacy. Accordingly, Islamic women's activists also constitute potentially important future partners for external actors (<b>bilateral</b> and multilateral <b>aid</b> <b>agencies,</b> women's organisations etc.) working to contribute to Arab women's empowerment, participation, agency and authority...|$|R
40|$|The {{twentieth century}} {{was a period}} of {{unprecedented}} demographic change. The global population increased nearly fourfold, growing from 1. 6 billion in 1900 to 6 billion in 2000 (Cohen 1995, App. 2, 400 – 401; UN 1998). Population growth rates accelerated, particularly in the developing world, during {{the first part of the}} century, reaching a peak in the late 1960 s. The response to rapid population growth was also unprecedented. Motivated by concerns about the environmental and economic effects of population growth, the United Nations, <b>bilateral</b> foreign <b>aid</b> <b>agencies,</b> multilateral institutions, and private foundations invested billions of dollars in population programs. Many developing-country governments, especially in Asia, vigorously pursued policies aimed at slowing population growth. The countries of East Asia were among the first and most active proponents of population policy. 2 Beginning in the 1960 s, many East Asian developing countries abandoned pronatalist policies, identified population stabilization as a national development objective, and adopted comprehensive programs intended to slow population growth. At first glance, the East Asian experience appears to provide strong support for the value of population stabilization policies.

40|$|The {{past decade}} has seen the rapid spread of market-based {{approaches}} to address climate change mitigation, adaptation and poverty alleviation. In {{the first decade of}} the 21 st century, the enthusiasm for pursuing mitigation through green alternatives to fossil fuels contributed to a spike in global investments in biofuel crops. The tropical plant jatropha (Jatropha curcas Linn.) was promoted as the ideal ‘green’ biofuel because of its multiple qualities. It was a non-food crop that was seen to grow easily in poor soils without requiring fertiliser or heavy demand for water and, most importantly, it could not be diverted from food consumption to biofuel production. Foreign direct investment (FDI) in jatropha cultivation was thus considered a potentially winning strategy for sustainable development and poverty alleviation in poor countries. This thesis investigates how FDI in jatropha has contributed to sustainable regional development in northwest Madagascar. Madagascar was one of the major destinations for FDI in jatropha cultivation in the 2000 s and, in particular, the northwest region of Boeny was targeted for large-scale production of the crop and as a node for biofuel-based industrial development. Using the framework of political ecology and global value chain analysis, the thesis examines three critical dimensions of jatropha investments in Boeny: first, the broader political-economic conditions that led Madagascar to become a favoured global destination for jatropha investment; second, the processes by which foreign companies launched into jatropha production in Boeny; and third, the experiences and outcomes of jatropha production and their impact on sustainable regional development in northwest Madagascar. The study uses a combination of field interviews, observations, and secondary data on jatropha investment and government policies to explore these dimensions. The thesis shows that jatropha investment in Madagascar resulted from a convergence of interests of the Madagascar presidency, <b>bilateral</b> <b>aid</b> <b>agencies,</b> global environmental organisations, and investors seeking to profit from an emerging global carbon economy. The expectations were similar to a gold rush, where everyone hoped to reap windfall profits as early-movers in the alternative fuel industry. The reality of jatropha cultivation proved the opposite and companies struggled to meet the targets outlined in their business plans. Poor knowledge of the crop’s agronomy and the regional economy undermined the profit expectations of companies, and a subsequent fall in petroleum prices and financial crisis led many to withdraw from jatropha cultivation altogether. These outcomes provided negligible benefits for sustainable regional development in the Boeny region. This study offers significant insights on the risks associated with market-driven initiatives aimed at climate change mitigation and sustainable development. Its findings indicate that despite vigorous promotion of sustainable development through the emerging global carbon economy, ‘green’ foreign investments in innovative biofuel crops such as jatropha provide negligible economic or ecological benefits to regions in poor countries...|$|R
