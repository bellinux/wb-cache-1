40|$|The first {{commercial}} bottom blown oxygen copper smelting furnace has been installed and operated at Dongying Fangyuan Nonferrous Metals (China) for 4 years. This new copper smelting technology shows {{a number of}} advantages including high productivity, low slag rate, high copper recovery and energy sufficiency. These advantages are with the flow dynamics of the bottom blown furnace. This paper reports an investigation into a 1 : 12 bottom blown furnace model set up at the University of Queensland to examine the novel features of the original furnace. In this paper, the mixing time in the bottom blown furnace model was investigated. As a first approximation Ar gas was injected {{from the bottom of}} the water bath to study the effects of gas flow rate and <b>bath</b> <b>depth</b> on mixing time. KCl solution, introduced from above the plume, was used as a tracer for continuous measurement of electrical conductivity as a mean to determine the mixing time. The preliminary correlations among mixing time, stirring energy, gas flow rate, and <b>bath</b> <b>depth</b> have been obtained for the bottom blown furnace. It was found that mixing time decreases with increasing gas flow rate and <b>bath</b> <b>depth.</b> The information from the cold model will be useful for design of the oxygen lances for the industrial furnace...|$|E
40|$|Nozzles {{are used}} {{in a wide range}} of applications. Nevertheless, the {{geometric}} of non-circular orifices have not been widely studied. This project has examined fluid jets exiting through a non-circular orifice, in the gravitational direction. Furthermore, its transformation to a circular cross-section due to a surface tension forces. How the length to a circular cross-section changes with the nozzles geometry and <b>bath</b> <b>depth</b> of the tundish was the main focus of this studied. A water model and high-speed camera was used to capture the profile of the fluid jet. Four different nozzles were attached one by one to five different tundishes with different bath depths. The result showed that with deeper bath depths the circular cross-section occurred further down from the nozzles orifice. The length to the circular cross-section also depended on the orifice area, a larger area gave a longer distance than a smaller area. It was shown that the length to circular cross-section followed a quadratic function, when the measured values were analyzed based on the Weber number. The profile of the fluid jet was dependent on the material of the nozzle, the geometries of the orifice, the <b>bath</b> <b>depth</b> and the surface tension. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{commercial}} scale bottom-blown copper smelting furnace started operation in 2008 by Fangyuan Nonferrous Metals Co. Ltd. A number of advantages {{of this new}} technology have been reported from industrial practice such as high smelting efficiency, low copper content in slag and lower temperature operation. Fluid dynamics of the melt bath play important roles in achieving these advantages {{and there is no}} information available on bottom-blown copper smelting furnace. Lab scale cold model experiments were carried out in this study to understand the features of the bottom-blown copper smelting furnace. Water was used to simulate matte and silicon oil was used to simulate slag. It was found that: 1) mixing time decreases with increasing matte depth and gas flowrate but increases with increasing slag depth and viscosity; 2) different types of transversal standing waves are able to take place on bath surface under certain combination of <b>bath</b> <b>depths</b> and gas flowrates, and these waves are believed to be relevant to splash, mass transfer and refractory erosion in smelting process; 3) in the absence of transversal standing waves, longitudinal wave is present on bath surface, which might be beneficial for slag tapping and settling of matte droplets in slag. The applications of these results on industrial practice are discussed in this paper to understand and improve this new technology...|$|R
40|$|Electronic {{packaging}} {{industries are}} now in great challenge to find a suitable lead-free solder as an interconnection material to replace the conventional SnPb solders. Many solders such as SnCu, SnAg, SnAgCu, SnZn, SnBi have already been proposed as the replacement {{but none of them}} has reached the physical and metallurgical properties similar to the SnPb solder. However, wetting is one of the basic problems that make the lead-free solder inferior as compared to the SnPb solder. Therefore, alloying with the help of third, fourth or fifth element is the researchers' interest to improve the wetting behavior of lead-free solders. This paper describes the comparative wetting behavior of Sn- 0. 7 Cu and Sn- 0. 7 Cu- 0. 3 Ni solders on Cu and Ni substrates. Wetting balance tests were performed to assess the wetting behaviors. Three different commercial fluxes namely no-clean (NC), non-activated (R) and water soluble organic acid (WS) fluxes were used to assess the wettability for three solder bath temperatures. It was found that Sn 0. 7 Cu- 03 Ni solder exhibits better wettability on Cu substrate for NC and WS fluxes whereas reverse results were found for R-type flux. In the case of Ni substrate, Sn- 0. 7 Cu- 0. 3 Ni solder showed better wetting behavior compared to the well-known Sn- 0. 7 Cu solder. Among the three fluxes, R-type flux showed the worst performance. Very large contact angles were documented for both solders with this flux. Higher solder bath temperature lowered the contact angles, increased the wetting forces and enhanced the wettability. Computer modeling of wetting balance test revealed that both the wetting force and meniscus height are inversely proportional to the contact angles. Modeling results also reveal that increase in solder <b>bath</b> <b>depths</b> and radiuses do not affect significantly on the wetting behavior...|$|R

Oil content and droplet size distribution were measured at tundish outlets under various casting conditions, using high speed videoing technology {{in conjunction with a}} flow-through optical cell. The focus of this study was placed on the behavior of macro size inclusions, which are detrimental to the mechanical properties of steel. It was found that inclusion removal efficiency was affected by a number of factors, such as ladle stream condition, casting rate, tundish depth, ladle change practice, flow control device and shroud type etc. There is a critical tundish depth, beyond which further increase in tundish <b>bath</b> <b>depth</b> would have minimal effect on inclusion removal...|$|E
40|$|An {{electrolytic}} cell for Aluminium production contains molten metal and molten electrolyte, which {{are subject to}} high dc-currents and magnetic fields. Lorentz forces arising from the cross product of current and magnetic field may amplify natural gravity waves at the interface between the two fluids, leading to short circuits in extreme cases. The external magnetic field and current distribution in the production cell is computed through a detailed finite element analysis at Torino Polytechnic. The results are then used to compute the magnetohydrodynamic and thermal effects in the aluminium/electrolyte bath. Each cell has lateral dimensions of 6 m x 2 m, whilst the <b>bath</b> <b>depth</b> is only 30 cm. the electrically resistive electrolyte path, which is critical {{in the operation of}} the cell, has layer depth of only a few centimetres below each carbon anode. Because the shallow dimensions of the liquid layer a finite-volume shallow-layer technique has been used at Greenwich to compute the resulting flow-field and interface perturbations. The information obtained from this method, i. e. depth averaged velocities and aluminium/electrolyte interface position is then embedded in the three-dimensional finite volume code PHYSICA and will be used to compute the heat transfer and phase change in the cell...|$|E
40|$|The inter-related {{effects of}} nozzle clogging, argon injection, tundish <b>bath</b> <b>depth,</b> slide gate opening {{position}} and nozzle bore diameter on the flow rate and pressure in tundish nozzles are quantified using three-dimensional multiphase turbulent numerical fluid flow models. The results are validated with measurements on operating steel continuous slab-casting machines, and presented for practical conditions {{with the aid}} of an inverse model. Initial clogging is predicted to enhance the flow due to a potential streamlining effect before it becomes great enough to restrict the flow channel. The clogging condition can be detected by comparing the measured steel flow rate to the theoretical value predicted under the same conditions by the inverse model presented here. Increasing argon injection may help to reduce air aspiration by increasing the minimum pressure below the slide gate. More argon is needed to do this at intermediate casting speeds and in deeper tundishes. Argon flow should be reduced during shallow tundish and low casting speed conditions (such as encountered during a transition) in order to avoid detrimental effects on flow pattern. It should also be reduced at high casting speed, when the slide gate is open wider and the potential for air aspiration is less. The optimal argon flow rate depends on the casting speed, tundish level, and nozzle bore diameter and is quantified in this work for a typical nozzle and range of conditions...|$|E

This littoral zone was examined {{on the sides of}} the Sea of Okhotsk, the Pacific Ocean, and the Izmena Bay. In the littoral zone of the Izmena Bay benthic foraminifers were not found. The highest biodiversity and maximal density of foraminifers were observed at a bench among rocks and blocks, in depressions of various size and <b>depth</b> (<b>baths),</b> at places where algae and water plants were attached, on silty sands, and on sands with admixture of broken shells, silt, and clastic matter composing the coast. The lowest density and biodiversity were found in mouths of creeks and rivers, on rock plates free from sediments and attached algae and water plants, as well as in places not protected from wind and wave activity.

40|$|Comparative wetting {{behavior}} of Sn- 0. 7 Cu and Sn- 0. 7 Cu- 0. 3 Ni solders on Cu and Ni substrates were assessed through the wetting balance test. No-clean (NC), non-activated (R) and water soluble organic acid (WS) fluxes {{were used to}} assess the wetting behavior for three different solder bath temperatures of 255, 275 and 295 °C. Experimental results unveiled that adding of 0. 3 wt% Ni into Sn- 0. 7 Cu solder can improve the wetting on Cu substrate when NC and WS fluxes are used. However, such addition of Ni did not improve the wetting of Sn- 0. 7 Cu solder for R-type flux. In the case of Ni substrate, addition of Ni helped to improve the wetting for all three types of fluxes as higher wetting forces were documented for Sn- 0. 7 Cu- 0. 3 Ni solder compared to the Sn- 0. 7 Cu solder. Among the fluxes, worst performance was observed for R-type flux. Very large contact angles were recorded for both solders with this kind of flux. Experimental results also revealed that higher solder bath temperature played an important role to lower the contact angle, to increase the wetting force and to enhance the wetting. Computer modeling of wetting balance test also revealed that both the wetting force and meniscus height are inversely proportional to the contact angles. Besides, solder <b>bath</b> <b>depth</b> and radius do not affect significantly on the wetting behavior...|$|E
40|$|The first {{commercial}} bottom blown oxygen copper smelting furnace has been installed and operated at Dongying Fangyuan Nonferrous Metals since 2008. Significant advantages {{have been demonstrated}} in this technology mainly due to its bottom blown oxygen-enriched gas. In this study, a scaled-down 1 : 12 model {{was set up to}} simulate the flow behavior for understanding the mixing phenomena in the furnace. A single lance was {{used in the present study}} for gas blowing to establish a reliable research technique and quantitative characterisation of the mixing behavior. Operating parameters such as horizontal distance from the blowing lance, detector <b>depth,</b> <b>bath</b> height, and gas flow rate were adjusted to investigate the mixing time under different conditions. It was found that when the horizontal distance between the lance and detector is within an effective stirring range, the mixing time decreases slightly with increasing the horizontal distance. Outside this range, the mixing time was found to increase with increasing the horizontal distance and it is more significant on the surface. The mixing time always decreases with increasing gas flow rate and bath height. An empirical relationship of mixing time as functions of gas flow rate and bath height has been established first time for the horizontal bottom blowing furnace...|$|R
40|$|An iodine {{surface layer}} has been {{prepared}} on Ru(poly) and Ru(0001) electrodes {{by exposure to}} iodine vapor in UHV and polarizing in a 0. 1 M HClO 4 / 0. 005 M KI solution, respectively. A saturation coverage of I on a Ru(poly) electrode passivates the Ru surface against significant hydroxide, chemisorbed oxygen or oxide formation during exposure to water vapor over an electrochemical cell in a UHV-electrochemistry transfer system. Immersion of I-Ru(poly) results in greater hydroxide and chemisorbed oxygen formation than water vapor exposure, but an inhibition of surface oxide formation relative that of the unmodified Ru(poly) surface is still observed. Studies with combined electrochemical and XPS techniques show that the iodine surface adlayer remained {{on top of the}} surface after cycles of overpotential electrodeposition/dissolution of copper on both Ru(poly) and Ru(0001) electrodes. These results indicate the potential bifunctionality of iodine layer to both passivate the Ru surface in the microelectronic processing and to act as a surfactant for copper electrodeposition. The electrodeposition of Cu on Ru(0001) or polycrystalline Ru was studied using XPS with combined ultrahigh vacuum/electrochemistry methodology (UHV-EC) in 0. 1 M HClO 4 with Cu(ClO 4) 2 concentrations ranging from 0. 005 M to 0. 0005 M, and on polycrystalline Ru in a 0. 05 M H 2 SO 4 / 0. 005 M CuSO 4 / 0. 001 M NaCl solution. The electrochemical data show well-defined cyclic voltammograms (CV) with a Cu underpotential deposition (UPD) peak and overpotential deposition (OPD) peak. XPS spectra of Ru electrodes emersed from perchloric acid solution at cathodic potentials indicate that ClO 4 - anions dissociate to yield specifically adsorbed Cl and ClOx species. Subsequent Cu deposition results in the formation of a thin, insoluble Cu(II) film with Cu(I) underneath. In contrast, similar deposition on polycrystalline Ru in the sulfuric acid/Cu sulfate solution with NaCl added yields only Cu(0), indicating that the formation of Cu(II) and Cu(I) involves both Cl and perchlorate interactions with the deposited Cu. A pre-adsorbed layer of iodine on the Ru(0001) surface inhibits perchlorate dissociation in iodide-free electrolyte and leads to the deposition of Cu(0) in the perchlorate <b>bath.</b> XPS <b>depth</b> profile analysis demonstrates that the iodine monolayer "floats" on top of the deposited film, in agreement with previous results, effectively protecting the Cu film from air oxidation...|$|R
40|$|The {{vibrational}} {{modes of}} water droplets supported on a surface (sessile drops) were excited by applying an impulse {{in the form}} of a short puff of nitrogen gas. An optical deflection technique was used to examine the modes of these oscillations in which laser light was scattered off the surface of the drops onto a photodiode. The time dependent intensity variations detected by the photodiode were Fourier transformed to give the vibrational spectra of the drops. The position and widths of the resonant peaks in these spectra were used along with a simple theory of droplet vibration to determine the surface tension and viscosity of the liquid. This theory models the resonant modes of the droplets as standing capillary wave states on the surface of a liquid <b>bath</b> of finite <b>depth.</b> Surfaces patterned with parallel, periodic grooves were made using a variety of techniques. When a droplet of water was placed on one of these surfaces, the droplet was shown to wet anisotropically to the surface elongating the shape of the drop. The vibrational response of these aspherical droplets were measured as described above and the resulting vibrational spectra were shown to contain two closely spaced resonant peaks. These two peaks are shown to correspond to standing wave states forming along the profile lengths of the drop in the directions of the major and minor axes. The vibrational response of droplets suspended from the end of a pipette tip (pendant drops) were also analysed using the same methods...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES To {{establish}} an effective alfaxalone concentration {{to be used}} for bath immersion of fire-bellied toads (Bombina orientalis) and to describe its effects. STUDY DESIGN Prospective experimental study. ANIMALS Thirteen oriental fire-bellied toads. METHODS The study was carried out in two phases. The pilot phase involved five animals and aimed to identify an alfaxalone concentration capable of producing induction of anesthesia, defined as immobility with a head down position and loss of responsiveness to stimulation with a stick. The following trial in an additional eight toads used the effective alfaxalone concentration established during the pilot phase. Data from 11 animals (three toads in the pilot study and the eight additional toads) were analyzed. Twenty minutes after immersion in the anesthetic solution, the toads were removed from the bath, and heart rate, respiratory rate, the righting, myotactic and the nociceptive withdrawal reflexes were evaluated every 5  minutes. The loss of both righting and nociceptive withdrawal reflexes was considered indicative of a surgical depth of anesthesia. The time elapsed from anesthetic induction to return of righting reflex, the quality of recovery and the occurrence of undesired effects were observed and recorded. RESULTS Immersion was found to be a suitable anesthetic technique for oriental fire-bellied toads and 200  mg L(- 1) alfaxalone concentration produced anesthetic induction in 10 out of 11 toads. Side effects, such as skin irritation, erythema and changes in cutaneous pigmentation, were not observed in any animal. The duration of anesthesia ranged from 10 to 30  minutes after removal of the toads from the alfaxalone <b>bath,</b> and surgical <b>depth</b> of anesthesia was never achieved. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE It was concluded that alfaxalone anesthesia induced by immersion in a concentration of 200  mg L(- 1) is only suitable for toads undergoing non-invasive short procedures...|$|R

40|$|The {{physical}} metallurgy and related process and product performance concepts for the zinc and zinc alloy {{hot dip coating}} of steel wire are briefly reviewed, and are illustrated with a detailed model of aluminum behavior in Galfan ® process technology. Applications to hot dip bath management practices are set forth. Background The coating of iron and steel with zinc to improve corrosion resistance has been practiced in various forms for 260 years, and a thorough description of the numerous wire-related technologies has been compiled in the handbook Ferrous Wire. 1 In general, the basic unalloyed zinc technologies may be grouped under the headings “hot dip galvanizing ” and “electrogalvanizing”. Hot dip practice involves the passage of wire through a molten zinc bath, whereas electrogalvanizing involves electroplating. The galvanized steel coating may involve no further processing. Alternatively, it may be redrawn, or otherwise reworked, chromated or oiled. It {{is important to note}} that the success of these technologies and the serviceability of the final product depend substantially on prior conditioning of the wire. Critical annealing, cleaning and fluxing (in the case of hot dip) processes precede the coating step. Moreover, hot dip coatings are optimized by the maintenance of small additions of aluminum in the zinc bath and by “wiping ” and quenching practices upon emergence from the <b>bath.</b> Modern, in <b>depth</b> presentations on zinc-based steel coating systems may be found in Zinc-Based Steel Coating Systems: Production and Performance. 2 The physical metallurgical basis of zinc-coated steel has been recently reviewed in detail by Marder. 3 It is practical and economical to apply a zinc alloy coating. Although traditional galvanized coatings with small (0. 1 %) aluminum compositions are the most popular, the most rapidly growing hot dip coating is made with the Galfan ® process, wherein a Zn- 5 % Al coating is applied by hot dipping (all composition data in this paper are in % by weight).

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The method for joining two components of homogeneous and inhomogeneous metallic materials (100, 101) by laser radiation, comprises forming a welding seam (106) along a main path and/or a welding spot at a fixed main position in the area of a joining edge, in which the laser radiation is partially absorbed in an interaction zone and forms a molten bath, covering a part of the joining edge by the molten bath to form a carrying cross-section after hardening a melt, and focusing the laser radiation along the joining edge on a small beam width with a main direction of the laser beam axis relative to normal to a surface of the material. The beam size resulting from the focusing and/or the smallest diameter of the laser beam of the focused laser radiation is held {{in the area of the}} interaction zone forming itself by the laser radiation and material along the joining edge of the materials. The diameter of the laser beam and the welding cavity (105) are slightly adjusted as required carrying cross-section of the welding seam during welding. In addition to the movement along the main path or position during seam/spot welding and the main direction of the laser beam axis in relation to the normal to the surface of the workpiece, the power and direction of the laser beam in relation to the main direction and the position on the surface of the material relative to the positions along the main path or to the main position are set as parameters, so that the welding cavity is guided independently of the main path with varying depth relative to the material thickness, with varying direction relative to the main direction and with varying position along a secondary path, so that a geometric form of the molten bath and the resultant seam cross section are achieved, which determine the local component dimensions along the main path and the resulting internal stresses in the component along the main path in dependence of the joint type. The radius of the laser beam relative to the desired width of the welding is set as a further parameter, so that the ratio (V) of the diameters of the welding seam and cavity or the diameters of the welding spot and the cavity exceeds a minimum value. The smallest cross section of double cone lies nearer to the workpiece surface and opening angle with the power of the laser beam is adjusted. The cross section of the welding seam reaches the carrying cross section along the main path. The length of the welding cavity remains small along the secondary path in comparison to width of the molten <b>bath.</b> The <b>depth</b> of the cavity is changed by controlling the power and/or the path speed and takes different large values by periodically controlling the power. The secondary path is passed through in the form of a curve with double dots. A system from several materials is processed with three layers and the weld connects only the upper two layers. A T-joint having a flange and a bar, the power and the opening angle of the laser beam are adjusted during the welding. The smallest cross-section of the double cone is adjusted on the surface of the flange. The laser beam is guided on the spiral-shaped path with variable radius at the joining edge, which is maximally seized by the full opening angle. A pre-determined value is reached for an angle distortion during welding, in which the opening angle and the depth of the closest cross section are adjusted. The depth is measured from the upper edge of the workpiece. For the angle distortion, the value is reached zero degree, in which the depth of the closest cross section is equally adjusted to the half material thickness and the opening angle is largely adjusted, up to which the actual angle distortion of the material- and laser parameter falls below a predetermined value based on unavoidable fluctuations of the internal stresses in the material. The width of the welding seam and/or the diameters of the welding spot are adjusted to the direction of the laser beam by a tumbling motion around a point in dependence of the distance to the material surface. The temperature in the molten bath is homogeneously kept nearer to the melting temperature with a given distribution and is adjusted to larger values only in a small environment of the welding cavity. The temperature is adjusted in the fixed part of the welding seam behind the molten bath with the given distribution. The laser beam heats the retral part of the molten bath. The effect of the adjustment of the parameters is controlled. The thermal emission of the hot surface of the molten bath and reflections of an additional illuminating source are obtained with a camera. The expansion of the intensive luminescent area of the camera shooting and the intensity of the measuring signal are used to control the actual resulting geometrical form of the molten bath and the additional efficiency of the control. The thermal emission of the hot surface of the molten bath is obtained with a photodiode. The length of the expansion of the intensive luminescent area and the intensity is qualitatively detected by a spatially averaged signal of the photodiode. The secondary path is passed through several times and the movement of the laser beam is superimposed by optical elements, so that the welding seam and/or spot are produced with variable welding seam width over the welding seam depth. A periodically passed secondary path is provided with a semi-major axis towards the main movement and with a semi-minor axis vertical to the main movement. A galvanometer scanner with diffractive optical element is used as optical element. The laser beam axis is bent opposite to the component surface. A rotational movement of the laser beam is carried out around the laser beam axis by optical components. A rotating prism with a torus mirror is used as optical component. USE - Method for joining two components of homogeneous and inhomogeneous metallic materials by laser radiation. ADVANTAGE - The method is capable of economically, accurately and reliably joining the two components with high quality and high strength and stability in less time-consuming manner...|$|R
