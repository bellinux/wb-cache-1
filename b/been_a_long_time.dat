It is a vandal state. There is a Russian writer who once described vandal states as Genghis Khan with a telegraph. Israel is Genghis Khan with a computer. I feel no emotion of affinity with that state. I have some good friends and their families there, and of course I would not want any of them to be hurt. That said, sometimes I feel that Israel has come out of the boils (sic) of the hell, a satanic state.|$|E

500|$|The {{basic concept}} behind [...] "Rush" [...] {{had been coming}} {{together}} since the sixth season. According to series creator Chris Carter, {{the way in which}} to portray the teenagers on screen was [...] "tricky". He noted, [...] "it had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> since we had dealt with teenage angst. [...] it was being done everywhere else and we wanted to take a run at it." [...] David Amman, who wrote the episode, later explained that the original idea for the episode was simply [...] " [...] effect having the power of super speed would have on troubled teens."

[...] Her voice sounded like growling during the main verses, where she sings the lines: [...] "He said, 'Sit back down where you belong, in the corner of my bar with your high heels on, Sit back down on the couch where we made love the first time..." [...] Noting the differences between live performances of the song and the studio version, Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph observed that the piano parts were replaced mostly by [...] "fizzing synths, a stomping beat sampled from [...] "We Will Rock You", thundering electric guitars and backing vocals stacked into shimmering choral walls." [...] Kitty Empire of The Guardian described the song as an [...] "umlaut-toting digital country power ballad" [...] with two Bruce Springsteen references: [...] "born to run" [...] and Nebraska.|$|E

The episode represents one of the first entries in the series to be written by someone from outside the main writing staff of The X-Files.

Gilligan later noted, [...] "they rewrote the episode [...] this saved an enormous amount of money in animation costs." [...] In addition, the [...] character of X was not in the first draft of the script.

500|$|There {{has been}} some {{resistance}} within the astronomical community toward the reclassification.

Stern contended that, {{by the terms of}} the new definition, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Neptune, all of which share their orbits with asteroids, would be excluded. He argued that all big spherical moons, including the Moon, should likewise be considered planets. He also stated that because less than five percent of astronomers voted for it, the decision was not representative of the entire astronomical community. Marc W. Buie, then at the Lowell Observatory petitioned against the definition. Others have supported the IAU. Mike Brown, the astronomer who discovered Eris, said [...] "through this whole crazy circus-like procedure, somehow the right answer was stumbled on.

This reaction is what some people say ultimately stunted his previous skill at creating cutting edge musical trends, with Jon Pareles of The New York Times writing that [...] "It has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> since Michael Jackson was simply a performer. He's the main asset of his own corporation, which is a profitable subsidiary of Sony". Some reviewers commented on the unusual format of a new studio album being accompanied by a [...] "greatest hits" [...] collection, with Q magazine saying [...] "from the new songs' point of view, it's like taking your dad with you into a fight." [...] Fred Shuster of the Daily News of Los Angeles described [...] "This Time Around", [...] "Money" [...] and [...] "D.S."
