50|$|In later accounts, the Danaides were punished in Tartarus {{by being}} forced to carry water in a jug to fill a <b>bath</b> without <b>bottom</b> (or with a leak) and thereby wash off their sins, but the bath was never filled because the water was always leaking out.|$|R
50|$|The {{reactions}} in the flash smelting furnaces produce copper matte, iron oxides and sulfur dioxide. The reacted particles {{fall into a}} <b>bath</b> at the <b>bottom</b> of the furnace, where the iron oxides react with fluxes, such as silica and limestone, to form a slag.|$|R
50|$|In flash smelting, the {{concentrate}} is dispersed {{in an air}} or oxygen {{stream and}} the smelting reactions are largely completed while the mineral particles are still in flight. The reacted particles then settle in a <b>bath</b> at the <b>bottom</b> of the furnace, where they behave as does calcine in a reverberatory furnace. A slag layer forms {{on top of the}} matte layer, and they can separately be tapped from the furnace.|$|R

50|$|The {{purpose of}} a clean room mat is to keep sterile the areas that require {{ultimate}} protection from dirt, bacteria and any contamination brought from outside. Clean room mats are tacky, sticky, non slip mats that possess multiple layers of clean film that effectively capture dirt and dust from foot traffic and wheels. Peel-off mats {{are made up of}} multiple sheets of polyethylene film coated with acrylic adhesive that traps particles. Each layer peels off to reveal a new clean surface. The adhesive backing prevents microbial growth and contamination. Mats used outside clean rooms and laboratories are designed to withhold foreign pollution elements. This goal is achieved by a sticky surface that serves as a barrier for debris, dirt and dust adhered to shoe soles. Clean room sticky mats can contain two defensive barriers: the first part is a carpet itself, while the second part is sticky surface mat. Another mat type to be used to protect rooms from pollution is sanitizing foot bath floor mats. The mat itself is a small bath that contains sanitizing liquid. The foot <b>bath</b> <b>bottom</b> is covered with pliable rubber scrapers for effective cleaning of footwear soles while the liquid disinfects them.|$|E
50|$|In a shot tower (now obsolete), {{molten metal}} (such as lead or steel), was dripped through a sieve into free fall. With {{sufficient}} height (several hundred feet), the metal would be solid enough to resist impact (usually {{in a water}} <b>bath)</b> at the <b>bottom</b> of the tower. While the shot may have been slightly deformed by its passage {{through the air and}} by impact at the bottom, this method produced metal spheres of sufficient roundness to be used directly in shotgun shells or to be refined by further processing for applications requiring higher accuracy.|$|R
5000|$|This is the {{predecessor}} of all metal colouring typically {{employed in the}} firearms industry. Contemporary heat-treatable steels did not exist or were in their infancy. Soft, low-carbon steel was used, but strong materials were needed for the receivers of firearms. Initially case hardening was used but didn't offer any aesthetics. Colour case hardening occurs when soft steels were packed in a reasonably airtight crucible {{in a mixture of}} charred leather, bone charcoal and wood charcoal. This crucible was heated to [...] for up to 6 hours (the longer the heat was applied the thicker the case hardening). At the end of this heating process the crucible is removed from the oven and positioned over a bath of water with air forced through a perforated coil in the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>bath.</b> The <b>bottom</b> of the crucible is opened allowing the contents to drop into the rapidly bubbling water. The differential cooling causes patterns of colours to appear as well as hardening the part.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{a bottom}} blown copper melting {{technology}} has been developed by Fangyuan Nonferrous Metals in China. The main unit of the technology is a bottom blown smelting furnace with a dimension of 4. 4 m in diameter and 16. 5 m in length. At {{the bottom of the}} furnace, there are nine lances aligned in two staggered rows, five in the upper row, 22 º offset from vertical line, and four in the lower row 7 º offset from vertical line. During smelting, oxygen enriched air is blown into molten <b>bath</b> from <b>bottom</b> lances and leads to different types of standing waves on bath surface. The features of the different standing waves are highly associated with bath splash, and can have an effect on refractory abrasion, matte droplet entrainment and settlement, and viscous slag tapping. This study aims to identify the types of standing waves that could occur in bottom blown furnace, summarise conditions of occurrence and analyse their amplitude and frequency to assist industrial operation...|$|R
40|$|The {{drainage}} of a thin {{liquid film}} with an insoluble monolayer down a vertical wall is studied. Lubrication theory {{is used to}} develop a model where the film is pinned at the top with a given thickness and the film drains into a <b>bath</b> at the <b>bottom.</b> A nonlinear equation of state {{is used for the}} surface tension and the surface viscosity is a nonlinear function of the surfactant concentration; these are appropriate for some aqueous sys-tems. The three partial differential equations are solved via discretization in space and then solving the re-sulting differential algebraic system. Results are described {{for a wide range of}} parameters, and the conditions under which the free surface is immobilized are discussed. 1...|$|R
2500|$|From {{early in}} the 19th century the {{existence}} of natural mineral waters was noted here and exploited. A local businessman Thomas Potter built, in 1831, the famous Ilkeston <b>Bath</b> at the <b>bottom</b> of Town Street attached to the Rutland Hotel. For over 60 years the baths helped tourism to the town {{at a time when}} spa towns like Bath and Harrogate enjoyed popularity. [...] 'If you're doubled in pain and thin as a lath, Come at once then and try, the famed Ilkeston Bath,' was a well known advertising slogan. A mixture of a general decline in the popularity of spa bathing and, reportable, contamination of the waters from mining activities led to the eventual closure of the baths just before 1900. The baths and the adjacent Rutland Hotel, which also enjoyed a revenue from tourism, no longer exist though they are remembered in the name of 'Bath Street'.|$|R
40|$|The {{behaviour}} of phosphorus in the {{smelting reduction}} process {{was investigated in}} this paper. Experiments were carried out under the conditions of smelting reduction: the phosphate reduction in molten slag by solid carbon, liquid iron saturated with carbon and CO gas, respectively. Furthermore, experiments on the phosphate reduction in pre-reduced iron ore by liquid iron saturated with carbon were carried out respectively when liquid iron was in permanent contact with molten pre-reduced iron ore, and when powders of the pre-reduced iron ore were injected into the iron <b>bath</b> from the <b>bottom.</b> The results showed that there was considerable un-reduced P 2 O 5 in the slag. Part of the reduction product of phosphorus escaped from the bath, while the other part was absorbed by liquid iron. The pig iron with low content of phosphorus {{can be obtained by}} smelting reduction in comparison with blast furnace. In the process of liquid iron bath with coal-oxygen-ore injection the phosphorus content in liquid iron could be kept constant in 100 kg scale tests...|$|R
5000|$|The {{molten iron}} {{droplets}} then drip down the furnace {{wall to the}} place where the [...] "neck" [...] widens into the [...] "bottle". Here the droplets fall from the wall into the molten slag, which sits on top of the liquid iron <b>bath</b> in the <b>bottom</b> of the furnace. Between the cyclone and the slag layer, oxygen is injected through water cooled lances to generate heat by partly combusting the gasses being released from the final reduction reaction step that takes place in the slag. Powder coal is injected into the slag layer, again through water cooled lances. The reduction reaction now continues [...] "as normal" [...] {{in the bottom of the}} furnace, with the partially reduced iron ore further reducing to regular pig iron and the whole separating into two molten layers (a top layer of slag and a bottom layer of molten pig iron). Both layers can be tapped individually and the pig iron can be used immediately in the remainder of the basic oxygen steelmaking process.|$|R
50|$|The 2009-10 Football Conference {{season was}} the sixth {{season with the}} Football Conference {{consisting}} of three divisions, and the thirty-first season overall. The Conference covers the top two levels of Non-League football in England. The Conference Premier is the fifth highest level of the overall pyramid, whilst the Conference North and Conference South exist at the sixth level. The top team (Stevenage Borough) and {{the winner of the}} play-off (Oxford United) of the National division were promoted to Football League Two. The bottom four were scheduled to be relegated to the North or South divisions, but in the event two teams (Salisbury City and Chester City) were expelled and only the bottom two clubs (Ebbsfleet United and Grays Athletic) were relegated with them. The champions of the North and South divisions (Southport and Newport County respectively) were promoted to the National division, alongside the play-off winners from each division (Fleetwood Town and <b>Bath</b> City). The <b>bottom</b> three in each of the North and South divisions were relegated to the premier divisions of the Northern Premier League, Isthmian League or Southern League. For sponsorship reasons, the Conference Premier was frequently referred to as the Blue Square Premier.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to {{investigate}} diversity and population density of sponges with manifest or potential economical interest {{for the first time in}} the Eastern Mediterranean. For this purpose, the area of Dodecanese, an Aegean area traditionally harvested for sponges was surveyed for bath sponges and species known as sources of bioactive compounds. Twenty stations of diverse orientation, substrate inclination and type of substratum, located on seven islands, were surveyed and totally 36 demosponge species were found. The data, collected with a non-destructive method, were subjected to multivariate analysis which showed that sponge diversity was higher in areas with vertical cliffs. A considerable spatial variation was revealed by the formation of two groups of stations, according to sponge species presence/absence: one including vertical cliffs and a second one, including moderately inclined cliffs, Posidonia meadows and detritic biogenic <b>bottoms.</b> <b>Bath</b> sponges occurred at a restricted number of stations and although in relatively low population densities, they revealed a sign of recovery after the devastating epidemic events. Higher stock availability was found for six biotechnologically promising species which were distributed all over the study area. The above results are encouraging for a future sustainable stock exploitation and open a new perspective for sponge mariculture in the area...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis study proposes an {{experimental}} {{analysis of the}} creep, crack initiation and crack propagation phases in a 16 MnNiMo 5 steel subjected to thermomechanical loading representing a core meltdown accident in a pressurized water reactor involving the transfer of a molten corium <b>bath</b> to the <b>bottom</b> head. The experimental setup enabled a biaxial mechanical loading (internal pressure + tension) {{to be applied to}} a tubular specimen at 900 and 1000 °C. In addition to the usual temperature, load, displacement and pressure measurements, the specimen was observed by two high-speed numerical cameras and an infrared camera. The crack's initiation and propagation conditions and the depressurization law were inferred from these measurements. At such temperatures, creep induces very large strains prior to the occurrence of the cracks which, in the worst-case scenario, can propagate at velocities as high as several meters per second. The design of the experiment enabled us to study the influence of the temperature (magnitude and hoop distribution), of the toughness of the steel (two grades were studied) and of the volume of pressurized gas. The results show that creep and crack propagation are highly dependent on temperature, and also that crack initiation and propagation are highly dependent on the degree of heterogeneity which is responsible for the localized initiation of the crack. ► Biaxial mechanical tests on 16 MnNiMo 5 tubular specimens are realized at 900 and 1000 °C until rupture. ► Crack propagation is recorded by high speed digital and infrared cameras. ► The propagation scenario strongly depends on the temperature...|$|R
