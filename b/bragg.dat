5|$|Based on {{intelligence}} acquired by a spy in Buell's army, Buckner advised <b>Bragg</b> that Buell was still ten miles from Louisville {{in the town}} of Mackville. He urged <b>Bragg</b> to engage Buell there before he reached Louisville, but <b>Bragg</b> declined. Buckner then asked Leonidas Polk to request that <b>Bragg</b> concentrate his forces and attack the Union army at Perryville, but again, <b>Bragg</b> refused. Finally, on October 8, 1862, Bragg's army—not yet concentrated with Kirby Smith's—engaged Maj. Gen. Alexander McCook's corps of Buell's army and began the Battle of Perryville. Buckner's division fought under General Hardee during this battle, achieving a significant breakthrough in the Confederate center, and reports from Hardee, Polk, and <b>Bragg</b> all praised Buckner's efforts. His gallantry was for naught, however, as Perryville ended in a tactical draw that was costly for both sides, causing <b>Bragg</b> to withdraw and abandon his invasion of Kentucky. Buckner joined many of his fellow generals in publicly denouncing Bragg's performance during the campaign.|$|E
5|$|After Chickamauga, Rosecrans and his Army of the Cumberland {{retreated to}} {{fortified}} Chattanooga. <b>Bragg</b> held an ineffective siege against Chattanooga, {{but refused to}} take any further action as the Union forces there were reinforced by Ulysses S. Grant and reopened a tenuous supply line. Many of Bragg's subordinates, including Buckner, advocated that <b>Bragg</b> be relieved of command. Thomas L. Connelly, historian of the Army of Tennessee, believes that Buckner {{was the author of}} the anti-Bragg letter sent by the generals to President Jefferson Davis. <b>Bragg</b> retaliated by reducing Buckner to division command and abolishing the Department of East Tennessee.|$|E
5|$|After Von Laue's {{pioneering}} research, {{the field}} developed rapidly, most notably by physicists William Lawrence <b>Bragg</b> {{and his father}} William Henry <b>Bragg.</b> In 1912–1913, the younger <b>Bragg</b> developed Bragg's law, which connects the observed scattering with reflections from evenly spaced planes within the crystal. The Braggs, father and son, shared the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics for their work in crystallography. The earliest structures were generally simple and marked by one-dimensional symmetry. However, as computational and experimental methods improved over the next decades, it became feasible to deduce reliable atomic positions for more complicated two- and three-dimensional arrangements of atoms in the unit-cell.|$|E

5|$|Crystals {{are often}} {{idealized}} as being perfectly periodic. In that ideal case, the atoms are positioned on a perfect lattice, the electron density is perfectly periodic, and the Fourier transform F(q) is zero except when q {{belongs to the}} reciprocal lattice (the so-called <b>Bragg</b> peaks). In reality, however, crystals are not perfectly periodic; atoms vibrate about their mean position, {{and there may be}} disorder of various types, such as mosaicity, dislocations, various point defects, and heterogeneity in the conformation of crystallized molecules. Therefore, the <b>Bragg</b> peaks have a finite width and there may be significant diffuse scattering, a continuum of scattered X-rays that fall between the <b>Bragg</b> peaks.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1862, word began to spread through the Army of Tennessee that Generals <b>Bragg</b> and Edmund Kirby Smith were {{planning}} an invasion of Kentucky. The legislative council voted to endorse the invasion plan, and on August 27, Governor Hawes was dispatched to Richmond to favorably recommend it to President Davis. Davis was non-committal, but <b>Bragg</b> and Smith proceeded, nonetheless.|$|E
5|$|Governor Johnson {{was killed}} while {{participating}} in the Battle of Shiloh. Following the resolutions of the Russellville Convention, the provisional Confederate government's ten legislative councillors selected Hawes to succeed Johnson as governor. (Under these provisions, the councillors could not select one of their own.) He joined the leaderless and nomadic shadow government, which had been traveling with the Army of Tennessee, in Corinth, Mississippi, and took {{the oath of office}} on May 31. The army's leader, General Braxton <b>Bragg,</b> had been considering an invasion of Kentucky. On August 27, Hawes was dispatched to Richmond, Virginia to favorably recommend this action to President Jefferson Davis, but Davis was non-committal. <b>Bragg</b> and Edmund Kirby Smith proceeded with the invasion nonetheless, while the leaders of Kentucky's Confederate government remained in Chattanooga, Tennessee, awaiting Hawes's return. They departed on September 18, and caught up with <b>Bragg</b> and Smith in Lexington, Kentucky on October 2.|$|E

5|$|In 1913 {{the crystal}} {{structure}} of sodium chloride {{was determined by}} William Henry <b>Bragg</b> and William Lawrence <b>Bragg.</b> This revealed that there were six equidistant nearest-neighbours for each atom, demonstrating that the constituents were not arranged in molecules or finite aggregates, but instead as a network with long-range crystalline order. Many other inorganic compounds were also found to have similar structural features. These compounds were soon described as being constituted of ions rather than neutral atoms, but proof of this hypothesis was not found until the mid-1920s, when X-ray reflection experiments (which detect the density of electrons), were performed.|$|E
5|$|In late November, Breckinridge {{commanded}} one of Bragg's two corps {{during the}} Confederate defeat at the Battles for Chattanooga. <b>Bragg</b> ordered {{a significant number}} of Breckinridge's men to reinforce Hardee's corps, leaving him with insufficient forces to repel the combined attack of Joseph Hooker and George Henry Thomas on Missionary Ridge. His son, Cabell, was captured in the battle. He was later freed in a prisoner exchange. In his official report, <b>Bragg</b> charged Breckinridge with drunkenness at Chattanooga and (retroactively) at Stones River. Historian Lowell H. Harrison noted that, while Breckinridge frequently drank whiskey, he was well known for being able to consume large amounts without getting drunk. Before submitting his own resignation, which was accepted, <b>Bragg</b> removed Breckinridge from command. It would be almost two years – on May 1, 1865 – before the two would reconcile.|$|E

5|$|Later that month, Breckinridge {{served as}} an {{independent}} commander in the lower Mississippi Valley, securing Confederate control of the area by taking Port Hudson, which helped halt the federal advance down the Mississippi River. Meanwhile, General Braxton <b>Bragg,</b> commanding the Army of Mississippi, was preparing an invasion of Kentucky, and Breckinridge was ordered to join him. Confederate leaders believed that Breckinridge's presence in the state could spur enlistments. Van Dorn was reluctant to lose command of Breckinridge and his men, {{and by the time}} he relented on October 15, <b>Bragg</b> was already retreating from the state after being defeated at the Battle of Perryville. Breckinridge and his division of 7,000 men met <b>Bragg</b> at Murfreesboro, Tennessee. With Kentucky solidly under Union control, Breckinridge's wife and children moved south and followed his troops as closely as was safely possible.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the leaders}} of Kentucky's Confederate {{government}} had remained in Chattanooga, Tennessee, awaiting Governor Hawes' return. They finally departed on September 18, and caught up with <b>Bragg</b> and Smith in Lexington, Kentucky on October 2. <b>Bragg</b> had been disappointed {{with the number of}} soldiers volunteering for Confederate service in Kentucky; wagon loads of weapons that had been shipped to the Commonwealth to arm the expected enlistees remained unissued. Desiring to enforce the Confederate Conscription Act to boost recruitment, <b>Bragg</b> decided to install the provisional government in the recently captured state capital of Frankfort. On October 4, 1862, Hawes was inaugurated as governor by the Confederate legislative council. In the celebratory atmosphere of the inauguration ceremony, however, the Confederate forces let their guard down, and were ambushed and forced to retreat by Buell's artillery.|$|E

5|$|New Multitudes is one {{of several}} tribute albums for American folk singer-songwriter Woody Guthrie. Guthrie died in 1967 after an {{extended}} battle with Huntington's disease, but his abbreviated career helped to inspire innumerable musicians during his lifetime {{as well as in the}} 1960s folk revival movement. Initially, this project was announced as a Farrar solo album with Johnson as a contributor. It was intended to follow previous efforts to elaborate on the archives of the Foundation by Billy <b>Bragg</b> and Wilco with the albums Mermaid Avenue (1998) and Mermaid Avenue Vol. II (2000), Blackfire's Woody Guthrie Singles (2003), Jonatha Brooke's The Works (2008), and the various artists compilation Note of Hope: A Celebration of Woody Guthrie (2011). Farrar was initially invited to collaborate with <b>Bragg</b> on the Mermaid Avenue sessions in 1995, but felt uncomfortable working on the material with someone else. Warner Bros. Records wanted all of Son Volt to collaborate with <b>Bragg,</b> but after Farrar declined, he kept the idea in mind. In 2006, he approached Nora Guthrie about returning to her father's lyrics and she agreed.|$|E

5|$|An {{intuitive}} {{understanding of}} X-ray diffraction {{can be obtained}} from the <b>Bragg</b> model of diffraction. In this model, a given reflection is associated with a set of evenly spaced sheets running through the crystal, usually passing through the centers of the atoms of the crystal lattice. The orientation of a particular set of sheets is identified by its three Miller indices (h, k, l), and let their spacing be noted by d. William Lawrence <b>Bragg</b> proposed a model in which the incoming X-rays are scattered specularly (mirror-like) from each plane; from that assumption, X-rays scattered from adjacent planes will combine constructively (constructive interference) when the angle θ between the plane and the X-ray results in a path-length difference that is an integer multiple n of the X-ray wavelength λ.|$|E

5|$|As the war progressed, this dissatisfaction {{increased}} {{and there were}} frequent changes to the cabinet. Toombs, who had wished to be president himself, was frustrated as an advisor and resigned {{within a few months}} of his appointment to join the army. Robert Hunter of Virginia replaced him as Secretary of State on July 25, 1861. On September 17, Walker resigned as Secretary of War due to a conflict with Davis, who had questioned his management of the War Department and had suggested he consider a different position. Walker requested, and was given, command of the troops in Alabama. Benjamin left the Attorney General position to replace him, and Thomas <b>Bragg</b> of North Carolina (brother of General Braxton <b>Bragg)</b> took Benjamin's place as Attorney General.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bragg</b> {{retained}} his position, relieving or reassigning {{the generals}} who had testified against him, and retaliated against Longstreet by reducing his command to only those units {{that he brought}} with him from Virginia. Despite the dysfunctional command climate under <b>Bragg,</b> and the lack of support from the War Department and President Davis concerning Bragg's removal, Longstreet did the best he could to continue to seek options in the Chattanooga Campaign. While <b>Bragg</b> resigned himself and his army to the siege of the Union Army of the Cumberland in Chattanooga, Longstreet devised a strategy to prevent reinforcement and a lifting of the siege by Grant. He knew this Union reaction was underway, and that the nearest railhead was Bridgeport, Alabama, where portions of two Union corps would soon arrive. After sending his artillery commander, Porter Alexander, to reconnoiter the Union-occupied town, he devised a plan to shift most of the Army of Tennessee away from the siege, setting up logistical support in Rome, Georgia, to go after Bridgeport to take the railhead, possibly catching Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker and arriving Union troops from the Eastern Theater in a disadvantageous position. The plan was well received and approved by President Davis, but it was disapproved by <b>Bragg,</b> who objected to the significant logistical challenges it posed. Longstreet accepted Bragg's arguments and agreed to a plan in which he and his men were dispatched to East Tennessee to deal with an advance by the Union Army of the Ohio, commanded by Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside. Longstreet was selected for this assignment partially due to enmity on Bragg's part, but also because the War Department intended for Longstreet's men to return to Lee's army and this movement was in that direction.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge fled behind Confederate lines. He was {{commissioned}} a brigadier general and then {{expelled from the}} Senate. Following the Battle of Shiloh in 1862, {{he was promoted to}} major general, and in October he was assigned to the Army of Mississippi under Braxton <b>Bragg.</b> After <b>Bragg</b> charged that Breckinridge's drunkenness had contributed to defeats at Stone River and Missionary Ridge, and after Breckinridge joined many other high-ranking officers in criticizing <b>Bragg,</b> he was transferred to the Trans-Allegheny Department, where he won his most significant victory in the 1864 Battle of New Market. After participating in Jubal Early's campaigns in the Shenandoah Valley, Breckinridge was charged with defending supplies in Tennessee and Virginia. In February 1865, Confederate President Jefferson Davis appointed him Secretary of War. Concluding that the war was hopeless, he urged Davis to arrange a national surrender. After the fall of Richmond, Breckinridge ensured the preservation of Confederate records. He then escaped the country and lived abroad for more than three years. When President Andrew Johnson extended amnesty to all former Confederates in 1868, Breckinridge returned to Kentucky, but resisted all encouragement to resume his political career. War injuries sapped his health, and he died in 1875. Breckinridge is regarded as an effective military commander. Though well-liked in Kentucky, he was reviled by many in the North as a traitor.|$|E
