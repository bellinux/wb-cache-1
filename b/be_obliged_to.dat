5|$|A {{by-election}} {{need not}} be held to fill a vacancy in any GRC triggered by the death or resignation of an MP, {{even if there are}} no other minority candidates in that GRC, or any other reason. A by-election is required only if all the MPs in a GRC vacate their Parliamentary seats. Assuming that such a situation does arise, the Prime Minister would <b>be</b> <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> call a by-election within a reasonable time, unless he intends to call a general election in the near future.|$|E
5|$|A second auction was held, with {{bids for}} natural gas given equal weight to those wishing to {{transfer}} crude oil, although any natural gas bidder would <b>be</b> <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> maintain the oil pumping stations {{for use in a}} national emergency. Ten bids were received and on February 8, 1947, the Texas East Transmission Corporation (TETCO) was declared successful. Its bid of $143,127,000 would make the disposal the largest sale of war-surplus property to the private sector following World War II.|$|E

5|$|Alastair Hudson, Professor of Equity and Law at Queen Mary, University of London, {{suggests}} {{the potential for}} a third class of secret trust. This is where the dying person is encouraged not to make a will so that his property passes to the next-of-kin, on the agreement that the next-of-kin give effect to his wishes via a secret trust. If this is the case, the next-of-kin would <b>be</b> <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> hold the property on trust and fulfil the dying person's wishes.|$|E
5|$|For many at the indaba, {{the most}} {{pressing}} motivator was Matabeleland's security. While Lobengula considered the Transvaalers more formidable battlefield adversaries than the British, he understood that Britain was more prominent on the world stage, and while the Boers wanted land, Rudd's party claimed to be interested only in mining and trading. Lobengula reasoned that if he accepted Rudd's proposals, he would keep his land, and the British would <b>be</b> <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> protect him from incursions by the Boers.|$|E
5|$|In 1945, Polish Eastern Borderlands were annexed into Soviet Ukraine and the family, {{like many}} other Poles, was resettled to Kraków, where Lem, at his father's insistence, took up medical studies at the Jagiellonian University. He did not take his final {{examinations}} on purpose, {{so as not to}} <b>be</b> <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> become a military doctor. Earlier, he had started working as an assistant in a hospital and writing stories in his spare time.|$|E

5|$|Some of the {{evidence}} submitted by the prosecution {{took the form of}} depositions made by leading Nazis. The defence demanded that the men should be brought to Israel so that the defence's right to cross-examination would not be abrogated. But Hausner, in his role as Attorney General, declared that he would <b>be</b> <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> have any war criminals who entered Israel arrested. The prosecution proved that Eichmann had visited places where exterminations had taken place, including Chełmno extermination camp, Auschwitz, and Minsk (where he witnessed a mass shooting of Jews), and therefore was aware that the deportees were being killed.|$|E
5|$|The novelist Matteo Bandello {{observed}} Leonardo at {{work and}} wrote that some days he would paint from dawn till dusk without stopping to eat and then not paint {{for three or four}} days at a time. This was beyond the comprehension of the prior of the convent, who hounded him until Leonardo asked Ludovico to intervene. Vasari describes how Leonardo, troubled over his ability to adequately depict the faces of Christ and the traitor Judas, told the Duke that he might <b>be</b> <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> use the prior as his model.|$|E
5|$|The {{outcome of}} a {{successful}} military campaign could vary in {{its impact on the}} defeated polity. In some cases, entire cities were sacked, and never resettled, as at Aguateca. In other instances, the victors would seize the defeated rulers, their families, and patron gods. The captured nobles and their families could be imprisoned, or sacrificed. At the least severe end of the scale, the defeated polity would <b>be</b> <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> pay tribute to the victor.|$|E

5|$|On 7 August 1936, France {{unilaterally}} declared non-intervention. Draft declarations {{had been}} put to the German and Italian governments. Such a declaration had already been accepted by the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands, Poland, Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union, which renounced all traffic in war material, direct or indirect. The Portuguese Foreign Minister, Armindo Monteiro, was also asked to accept, but held his hand. An ultimatum was put to Yvon Delbos by the British: halt French exports to Spain, or Britain would not <b>be</b> <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> act under the Treaty of Locarno if Germany invaded; on 9 August, exports were duly suspended. However, collections for food, clothing and medical supplies to the Spanish Republicans continued. On 9 August, the Germans informed the British that 'no war materials had been sent from Germany and none will', which was blatantly false. During the blockade of the Strait of Gibraltar by the Spanish Republican Navy one German Junkers was captured {{when it came down}} in Republican territory, and explained as 'merely a transport aircraft'. Its release would be required before Germany signed the Non-Intervention Pact. Portugal accepted the pact on 13 August, unless her border was threatened by the war.|$|E
