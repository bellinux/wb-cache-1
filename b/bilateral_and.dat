40|$|Purpose To {{investigate}} intracortical inhibition and facilitation {{in response}} to unilateral dominant, nondominant <b>and</b> <b>bilateral</b> biceps activation <b>and</b> short-term upper extremity training in right- and left-handed adults. Methods Paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation {{was used to measure}} intracortical excitability in motor dominant and nondominant cortices of 26 nondisabled adults. Neural facilitation and inhibition were measured in each hemisphere during unilateral dominant, nondominant <b>and</b> <b>bilateral</b> arm activation <b>and</b> after training in each condition. Results No differences were seen between right- and left-handed subjects. Intracortical facilitation and decreased inhibition were seen in each hemisphere with unilateral activation/training of contralateral muscles <b>and</b> <b>bilateral</b> muscle activation/training. Persistent intracortical inhibition was seen in each hemisphere with ipsilateral muscle activation/training. Inhibition was greater in the nondominant hemisphere during dominant hemisphere activation (dominant arm contraction). Conclusion Strongly dominant individuals show no difference in intracortical responses given handedness. Intracortical activity with unilateral <b>and</b> <b>bilateral</b> arm activation <b>and</b> short-term training differs based on hemispheric dominance, with the motor dominant hemisphere exerting a larger inhibitory influence over the nondominant hemisphere. <b>Bilateral</b> activation <b>and</b> training have a disinhibitory effect in both dominant and nondominant hemispheres...|$|R
