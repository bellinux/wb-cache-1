25|$|Polyurethane foam (including foam rubber) is {{sometimes}} made using {{small amounts of}} <b>blowing</b> <b>agents</b> to give less dense foam, better cushioning/energy absorption or thermal insulation. In the early 1990s, because of their impact on ozone depletion, the Montreal Protocol restricted the use of many chlorine-containing <b>blowing</b> <b>agents,</b> such as trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11). By the late 1990s, <b>blowing</b> <b>agents</b> such as carbon dioxide, pentane, 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFC-134a) and 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane (HFC-245fa) were widely used in North America and the EU, although chlorinated <b>blowing</b> <b>agents</b> remained in use in many developing countries.|$|E
25|$|High-density {{microcellular}} foams can {{be formed}} without {{the addition of}} <b>blowing</b> <b>agents</b> by mechanically frothing or nucleating the polyol component prior to use.|$|E
25|$|Polyurethanes are {{produced}} by mixing two or more liquid streams. The polyol stream contains catalysts, surfactants, <b>blowing</b> <b>agents</b> and so on. The two components {{are referred to as}} a polyurethane system, or simply a system. The isocyanate is commonly referred to in North America as the 'A-side' or just the 'iso'. The blend of polyols and other additives is commonly referred to as the 'B-side' or as the 'poly'. This mixture might also be called a 'resin' or 'resin blend'. In Europe the meanings for 'A-side' and 'B-side' are reversed. Resin blend additives may include chain extenders, cross linkers, surfactants, flame retardants, <b>blowing</b> <b>agents,</b> pigments, and fillers. Polyurethane can be made in a variety of densities and hardnesses by varying the isocyanate, polyol or additives.|$|E
40|$|The method {{involves}} {{adding a}} <b>blowing</b> <b>agent</b> {{directly to a}} plasticizing unit (1), where a physical or chemical <b>blowing</b> <b>agent</b> is added downstream of the feed point (12) of the fibers (F).

40|$|Aluminium foams were {{produced}} via the powder route in which blends of metal powders and <b>blowing</b> <b>agent</b> are first compacted and then melted. AlSi 6 Cu 4 casting alloy was foamed using titanium hydride as <b>blowing</b> <b>agent.</b> The <b>blowing</b> <b>agent</b> {{was subjected to}} various oxidising pre treatments in air prior to compaction.

25|$|CFCs and HCFCs {{are used}} {{in a variety of}} {{applications}} because of their low toxicity, reactivity and flammability. Every permutation of fluorine, chlorine and hydrogen based on methane and ethane has been examined and most have been commercialized. Furthermore, many examples are known for higher numbers of carbon as well as related compounds containing bromine.

25|$|Polystyrene foams are {{produced}} using <b>blowing</b> <b>agents</b> that form bubbles {{and expand the}} foam. In expanded polystyrene, these are usually hydrocarbons such as pentane, which may pose a flammability hazard in manufacturing or storage of newly manufactured material, but have relatively mild environmental impact. Extruded polystyrene is usually made with hydrofluorocarbons (HFC-134a), which have global warming potentials of approximately 1000â€“1300 times that of carbon dioxide.|$|E
25|$|The {{product of}} the {{polymerization}} process is unmodified PVC. Before PVC can be made into finished products, it always requires conversion into a compound by the incorporation of additives (but not necessarily all of the following) such as heat stabilizers, UV stabilizers, plasticizers, processing aids, impact modifiers, thermal modifiers, fillers, flame retardants, biocides, <b>blowing</b> <b>agents</b> and smoke suppressors, and, optionally, pigments. The choice of additives used for the PVC finished product {{is controlled by the}} cost performance requirements of the end use specification (underground pipe, window frames, intravenous tubing and flooring all have very different ingredients to suit their performance requirements). Previously, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were added to certain PVC products as flame retardants and stabilizers.|$|E

2500|$|In 1956 DuPont {{introduced}} polyether polyols, specifically poly(tetramethylene ether) glycol, and BASF and Dow Chemical {{started selling}} polyalkylene glycols in 1957. Polyether polyols were cheaper, easier to handle and more water-resistant than polyester polyols, and became more popular. Union Carbide and Mobay, a U.S. Monsanto/Bayer joint venture, also began making polyurethane chemicals. In 1960 more than 45,000 {{metric tons of}} flexible polyurethane foams were produced. The availability of chlorofluoroalkane <b>blowing</b> <b>agents,</b> inexpensive polyether polyols, and methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) allowed [...] polyurethane rigid foams {{to be used as}} high-performance insulation materials. In 1967, urethane-modified polyisocyanurate rigid foams were introduced, offering even better thermal stability and flammability resistance. During the 1960s, automotive interior safety components, such as instrument and door panels, were produced by back-filling thermoplastic skins with semi-rigid foam.|$|E

40|$|The {{production}} of lightweight geopolymers is an emergent area, {{and the influence}} of the pore forming agent on geopolymer kinetics and the rheology of the pastes has been rather neglected up to now. In this work the influence of the <b>blowing</b> <b>agent</b> content, NaOH molarity and water content on the fresh and hardened-state properties of fly ash-containing geopolymers was evaluated. Results demonstrate that the <b>blowing</b> <b>agent</b> decreases the slurries yield stress, which extends the open time before in situ application. It was also found that the geopolymerisation rate is only slightly affected by the <b>blowing</b> <b>agent,</b> while a strong impact is exerted by the activator molarity. The proper association between NaOH molarity and <b>blowing</b> <b>agent</b> content leads to the {{production of}} lightweight geopolymers exhibiting very low thermal conductivity (up to 0. 08 W/m K) and apparent density (440 kg/m(3)). The thermal conductivity shown by these innovative materials suggest their suitability for thermal insulating applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
2500|$|Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are {{anthropogenic}} {{compounds that}} have been released into the atmosphere since the 1930s in various applications such as in air-conditioning, refrigeration, <b>blowing</b> <b>agents</b> in foams, insulations and packing materials, propellants in aerosol cans, and as solvents. [...] The entry of CFCs into the ocean makes them extremely useful as transient tracers to estimate rates and pathways of ocean circulation and mixing processes. However, due to production restrictions of CFCs in the 1980s, atmospheric concentrations of CFC-11 and CFC-12 has stopped increasing, and the CFC-11 to CFC-12 ratio in the atmosphere have been steadily decreasing, making water dating of water masses more problematic. Incidentally, production and release of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) have rapidly increased in the atmosphere since the 1970s. Similar to CFCs, SF6 is also an inert gas and is not affected by oceanic chemical or biological activities., CFC-11, CFC-12 and CFC-113 | journal = Journal of Oceanography | volume = 59 | issue = 5 | pages = 719â€“729 | year = 2003 | doi = 10.1023/B:JOCE.0000009600.12070.1a | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248068919_Comparison_of_Time-Dependent_Tracer_Ages_in_the_Western_North_Pacific_Oceanic_Background_Levels_of_%28SF_6__CFC11_CFC12_and_CFC113 }} Thus, using CFCs in concert with SF6 as a tracer resolves the water dating issues due to decreased CFC concentrations.|$|E
