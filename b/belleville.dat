5|$|Around {{the time}} of the {{recording}} of March 16–20, 1992, Mike Heidorn had secured a steady job at a <b>Belleville</b> newspaper company and was dating a woman who had two children from a previous marriage. Uncle Tupelo had planned a tour of Europe, but Heidorn wanted to stay in <b>Belleville</b> with his girlfriend, whom he married in August 1992.|$|E
5|$|Past this intersection, County Route 507 {{turns away}} from Route 7, {{becoming}} concurrent with Route 17. by heading north on River Road, while Route 7 continues along Bellevill Turnpike for another half mile, Route 7 continues another half mile west, crossing the Passaic River on a lift bridge, known as the <b>Belleville</b> Turnpike Bridge or Rutgers Street Bridge, into <b>Belleville,</b> Essex County, where the local street name changes from <b>Belleville</b> Turnpike to Rutgers Street. The first section of Route 7 ends at an intersection with Main Street underneath Route 21.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} {{section of}} Route 7, which runs from Jersey City to <b>Belleville,</b> passes through industrial areas, the New Jersey Meadowlands, Arlington Memorial Park, and some residential and business areas. West of the interchange with County Route 508 in Kearny, Route 7 is the <b>Belleville</b> Turnpike, a historic road created in 1759. The northern section of Route 7 runs north through residential and business areas of <b>Belleville</b> and Nutley into Clifton, where it turns west and crosses back into Nutley, briefly {{turning to the}} north to come to its northern terminus. A portion of the route in Nutley is municipally maintained while the portion within Clifton is maintained by Passaic County. The two separate sections of Route 7 are linked by County Route 506 (Rutgers Street) in <b>Belleville,</b> which is signed as Route 7 despite the fact it is not officially part of the route.|$|E
5|$|Tired of the {{constant}} violence, Stuart quit hockey after the Stanley Cup championship in 1907 and joined his father in construction. As part of this job, Stuart was sent to <b>Belleville,</b> Ontario, to oversee {{the building of the}} <b>Belleville</b> Drill Shed, one of his father's contracts. While in <b>Belleville,</b> he continued to receive offers to join a new hockey team. He was asked if he wanted to manage the <b>Belleville</b> team; a similar offer came from Peterborough, Ontario, while a town outside Toronto was said to have offered a railroad president's salary if Stuart would join them. On the afternoon of June 23, 1907, Stuart went to the Bay of Quinte, near <b>Belleville,</b> to swim with some friends. Stuart swam to the nearby lighthouse, about half a kilometre away from his group, climbed onto a platform and dived into the shallow water. He dived head first onto jagged rocks, gashing his head and breaking his neck. He was killed instantly. His body was brought back to Ottawa, where a service was held at his family's home before he was buried at Beechwood Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Back in Illinois, Edwards {{settled in}} <b>Belleville,</b> a town whose site {{he had once}} owned before selling off its lots at a profit.|$|E
5|$|Following initial tests, MACS was {{deployed}} {{at every}} inspection station along I-75 from Miami to Detroit and along Highway401 from Windsor to <b>Belleville</b> in 1994.|$|E
5|$|In the 1953 New Jersey {{state highway}} renumbering, Route 7 was legislated onto its current alignment, with the {{northern}} terminus moved to the Nutley/Clifton border. The route was also realigned to head south on Washington Avenue between the Newark border and Rutgers Street in <b>Belleville</b> on what was Route 11N, a remnant of Pre-1927 Route 11, making Route 7 discontinuous. County Route 506 used to follow the southern portion of Route 7 but has been truncated to the intersection with Routes 7 and 21 in <b>Belleville.</b>|$|E
5|$|On August 1, 2015, Dr. Brett Barger began {{serving as}} interim {{president}} of the <b>Belleville</b> campus. The interim title was removed and Barger was appointed {{president of the}} Lindenwood University <b>Belleville</b> campus in October 2015. Barger is a longtime member of the Lindenwood family, having first arrived at the St. Charles campus as a student in 1990. He was hired in 1994 and has three Lindenwood degrees – EdD, MBA, and BA. He previously served as the associate vice president for operations and finance.|$|E
5|$|The {{second section}} of Route 7, {{designated}} a northsouth road, heads north on Washington Avenue from the Second River crossing on the Newark/Belleville border, {{passing through a}} business district. The route intersects County Route 506 (<b>Belleville</b> Avenue), and that county route then forms a concurrency with Route 7 along the next block of Washington Avenue, to the intersection with Rutgers Street. At that point, County Route 506 heads to the east, ending {{at the intersection of}} Main Street, Rutgers Street, and bridge to <b>Belleville</b> (which is also the other section of Route 7).|$|E
5|$|In this example, Canada Post {{will deliver}} to the CFPO at <b>Belleville</b> and the Canadian Forces Postal System will {{continue}} transport to the addressee at CFPO 5053 (in Geilenkirchen, Germany) by whatever means and timing {{the military will}} deem appropriate.|$|E
5|$|With {{the release}} of their 1990 debut LP, No Depression, the <b>Belleville,</b> IL, trio Uncle Tupelo {{launched}} more than simply their own career—by fusing the simplicity and honesty of country music with the bracing fury of punk, they kick-started a revolution which reverberated throughout the American underground.|$|E
5|$|At Trenton, {{the highway}} crosses the Trent Canal {{and returns to}} an {{agricultural}} setting. It then crosses the Moira River as it goes through <b>Belleville</b> before heading eastward to Kingston. The Kingston portion of the highway, originally named the Kingston-Bypass, {{was one of the}} first sections of the highway to be completed; it is now mostly three lanes each way.|$|E
5|$|Dekum {{was born}} in Deiderfeld, Rheinfalz, Germany, on November 5, 1829. He and his brother and four sisters emigrated to the United States to settle on a farm near <b>Belleville,</b> Illinois. The family later moved to St. Louis, Missouri, where both parents died. After serving as an {{apprentice}} confectioner in St. Louis, Dekum and a friend, Frederick Bickel, went gold prospecting in California and Idaho before settling in Portland.|$|E
5|$|Hughes {{was born}} in Hillsboro, Illinois. Hughes has two siblings, a sister and his twin brother Mark. During high school they both played {{football}} and wrestling. Hughes went to Southwestern Illinois College in <b>Belleville,</b> Illinois, before transferring to Lincoln College, in Lincoln, Illinois {{and then on to}} Eastern Illinois University in Charleston, Illinois.|$|E
5|$|Local {{streets in}} Newark conform to a quasi-grid form, with major streets {{radiating}} outward (like spokes on a wheel) from the downtown area. Some major {{roads in the}} city are named after the towns to which they lead, including South Orange Avenue, Springfield Avenue, and Bloomfield Avenue, as well as Broadway, which had been renamed from <b>Belleville</b> Avenue.|$|E
5|$|Route 7 was {{established}} in 1927 to run from Jersey City to Paterson, replacing Pre-1927 Route 11 between <b>Belleville</b> and Paterson. The routing was amended in 1929 to head to Route 3 in Wallington and was extended north to Route 6 (now U.S. Route 46) in East Paterson in 1949. In 1953, the route was modified to follow its current alignment.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Belleville</b> Turnpike, {{which is}} the {{majority}} of the southern portion of Route 7, was created in 1759 as a turnpike made out of cedar logs. This road was chartered in 1808. It served {{as a part of the}} Underground Railroad route for escaped slaves to get to Jersey City.|$|E
5|$|The Church of God and Saints of Christ was {{established}} in Lawrence, Kansas, in 1896 by African-American William Saunders Crowdy. The group established its headquarters in Philadelphia in 1899, and Crowdy later relocated to Washington, D.C., in 1903. After Crowdy's death in 1908, the church continued to grow {{under the leadership of}} William Henry Plummer, who moved the organization's headquarters to its permanent location in <b>Belleville,</b> Virginia, in 1921.|$|E
5|$|The {{intersection}} of Main St and Rutgers Street in <b>Belleville</b> forms {{the end of}} one section of Route 7 (signed north, directionally west). Rutgers Street is named for Colonel Henry Rutgers, an American Revolutionary War hero and benefactor of what is now Rutgers University. For its entire length, Rutgers carries Essex County Route 506, which ends, like Rutgers Street itself, at the Rutgers Street Bridge.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} {{segment of}} Route 7 was originally {{a part of}} Pre-1927 Route 11, which was legislated in 1917 to run from Newark to Paterson. In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 7 was designated to run from Jersey City to Paterson, replacing Pre-1927 Route 11 between <b>Belleville</b> and Paterson.|$|E
5|$|The {{state highway}} map in 1933 showed a {{proposed}} southern extension from Clarkston through southern Oakland County, Wayne County into Monroe County. This proposed highway would have bypassed Metro Detroit {{to the west}} through Farmington, Northville, Plymouth and <b>Belleville.</b> The full highway was never built, and M-15 was never extended south of Clarkston, but part of this proposal was completed. Much of it later became Haggerty Highway, {{and part of the}} I-275 and M-5 corridors.|$|E
5|$|When {{the state}} highway system was first signposted in 1919, M-56 was {{assigned}} to roadways that ran northeasterly from the Ohio state line to the <b>Belleville</b> area. When the United States Numbered Highway System was created on November 11, 1926, the southern section between the state line and Monroe was redesignated as a section of US25. In the 1940s, the northern end was rerouted north from New Boston to follow M-112 along the Willow Run Expressway (now I-94 {{and part of the}} Detroit Industrial Freeway) into <b>Belleville</b> north to US112. In late 1954 or early 1955, the northern end was changed again, this time truncating the highway to end at New Boston. The northern end was shortened again to terminate at US24/US25 in Flat Rock in 1956. The remainder of the highway from Monroe to Flat Rock was removed and decommissioned from the state highway system the next year, becoming county roads under the jurisdiction of Monroe and Wayne counties.|$|E
5|$|Although Uncle Tupelo {{broke up}} before it {{achieved}} commercial success, {{the band is}} renowned for {{its impact on the}} alternative country music scene. The group's first album, No Depression, became a byword for the genre and was widely influential. Uncle Tupelo's sound was unlike popular country music of the time, drawing inspiration from styles as diverse as the hardcore punk of The Minutemen and the country instrumentation and harmony of the Carter Family and Hank Williams. Farrar and Tweedy's lyrics frequently referred to Middle America and the working class of <b>Belleville.</b>|$|E
5|$|Brennus was {{the first}} pre-dreadnought {{battleship}} of the French Navy built in the late 19th century. She was laid down in January 1889, launched in October 1891, and completed in 1896. Her design was unique and departed from earlier ironclad battleship designs by introducing a number of innovations. These included a main battery of heavy guns mounted on the centerline and the first use of <b>Belleville</b> boilers. She {{formed the basis for}} several subsequent designs, beginning with Charles Martel.|$|E
5|$|Lyrically {{the songs}} {{reflected}} the band members' experiences {{growing up in}} <b>Belleville.</b> Farrar and Tweedy romanticized tales about unemployment, alcoholism, and the feeling {{of living in a}} small town in an effort to emulate the profundity of songwriters such as Woody Guthrie. Musically, No Depression was influenced by the start-stop musical pattern of the Minutemen. The cover of the album features a blurry photo of the band, taken by J. Hamilton, reminiscent of the albums released on Folkways Records.|$|E
5|$|M-56 {{was a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the southeastern part of the US state of Michigan. It existed from 1919 until 1957. The highway ran north from Monroe, where it connected with US Highway24 (US24, Telegraph Road), to Flat Rock where it terminated at an intersection with US24/US25. Before a series of truncations in the 1950s, the highway continued along the Huron River to New Boston and <b>Belleville.</b> The trunkline was progressively scaled back to Flat Rock before being decommissioned in 1957.|$|E
5|$|Route 21 {{was first}} {{defined in the}} 1927 New Jersey state highway {{renumbering}} to run from Route 25 (now U.S. Route 1/9) and Route 29 (now U.S. Route 22) in Newark north to <b>Belleville.</b> The surface portion of Route 21 in Newark, which follows the Northeast Corridor rail line, was commissioned in 1934 between Routes 25 and 29 and Market Street and the portion through downtown Newark was commissioned in 1936 between Market Street and Clay Street. In 1948, the Route 21 designation was extended north to Paterson.|$|E
5|$|The Canopus-class {{ships were}} {{powered by a}} pair of 3-cylinder triple-expansion engines, with steam {{provided}} by twenty <b>Belleville</b> boilers. They were the first British battleships with water-tube boilers, which generated more power at less expense in weight compared with the fire-tube boilers used in previous ships. The new boilers led to the adoption of fore-and-aft funnels, rather than the side-by-side funnel arrangement used in many previous British battleships. The Canopus-class ships proved to be good steamers, with a high speed for battleships of their time— from —a full two knots faster than the Majestics.|$|E
5|$|The Newark Watershed {{comprises}} 35,000 {{acres of}} reservoirs and water treatment systems {{for more than}} 500,000 customers in northern New Jersey, including Newark and neighboring <b>Belleville,</b> Elizabeth, Bloomfield, and Nutley. It {{is considered one of}} the city's greatest assets. A New Jersey State Comptroller report issued in February 2014 revealed irregularities and corruption within the Newark Watershed and Development Corporation, which is in the process of being dismantled after being taken over by the city while on Booker's watch.|$|E
5|$|The {{sections}} originally {{designated as}} the Willow Run Expressway were rebuilt from Rawsonville Road in <b>Belleville</b> to Ozga Road in Romulus starting in 1972. As part of this reconstruction, the segment between Haggerty Road and Ozga Road was widened from four to six lanes, and the eastbound lanes were realigned to facilitate construction of an interchange with I-275, a western bypass of Detroit which was under construction at the time. The Willow Run segment was also resurfaced at this point, as the old road bed did not contain steel mesh. Construction of this interchange also obliterated a partial interchange with Huron River Drive.|$|E
5|$|The son of Scottish immigrants, Bain {{was born}} in <b>Belleville,</b> Ontario and moved {{with his family to}} Winnipeg, Manitoba, as a young child. His father, James Henderson Bain, was a horse buyer for the British {{government}} and upon his arrival in Canada lived in Montreal before moving west. His mother, Helen Miller, was a seamstress. Bain was the sixth of seven children, having four sisters and two brothers. Bain would attend school in Winnipeg, and earned a bachelor's degree from Manitoba College. He began working in 1888, aged 14, serving as a bookkeeper's apprentice for a grocery broker.|$|E
5|$|After {{his playing}} career ended, Blake {{went on to}} become a plumber. He spent nearly 50 years in the {{plumbing}} business and was formerly the president of Plumbers Local 360. Blake was married to his wife, Carol Jean, for 47 years before her death. With Carol, he had a son, Ed, and a daughter, Peggy. His son, also named Ed Blake, was a former pitcher who played in the Baltimore Orioles' farm system from 1970 to 1973, playing for the AA affiliate Asheville Orioles at the peak of his career. His grandson, Ed Blake III, has continued in the footsteps of his father and grandfather as a pitcher in high school. Blake died in Swansea, Illinois at the age of 83 after a long illness, and is interred at Mount Carmel Cemetery in <b>Belleville,</b> Illinois.|$|E
5|$|Following Uncle Tupelo's final tour, Tweedy {{encouraged}} his bandmates to {{join him}} in a new group, while Farrar searched for members for a band of his own. Tweedy was able to retain the rest of the Uncle Tupelo lineup, and created Wilco. Wilco began rehearsing {{a few days after the}} final Uncle Tupelo concert, and by August 1994 they were in the recording studio for their first album, A.M.. Farrar asked Jim Boquist to join his new band, Son Volt; Boquist was a multi-instrumentalist who had performed with Joe Henry as the opening act on Uncle Tupelo's last tour. Boquist also recruited his brother Dave, and Farrar convinced Mike Heidorn to leave <b>Belleville</b> to join the group. Farrar's new four-piece began recording their debut album Trace in November 1994.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} 20 years, Berg {{had no real}} job, living off friends and {{relatives}} who put up with {{him because of his}} charisma. When they would ask what he did for a living, he would reply by putting his finger to his lips, giving them the impression that he was still a spy. A lifelong bachelor, he lived with his brother Samuel for 17 years. According to Samuel, he became moody and snappish after the war and did not seem to care for much in life besides his books. His brother finally grew fed up with the arrangement and asked Moe to leave and even had eviction papers drawn up. After being evicted from his brother's home, Berg moved in with his sister Ethel in <b>Belleville,</b> New Jersey, where he remained {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|In the 1999 Memorial Cup, the Hitmen {{opened their}} tournament with a 5–3 {{victory over the}} Ontario Hockey League's <b>Belleville</b> Bulls, {{followed}} by a 4–3 loss to the host Ottawa 67's. They followed with a 3–1 win over the Acadie-Bathurst Titan of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League. Finishing atop the round robin standings, the Hitmen earned a bye into the championship game, and a rematch against the 67's. The championship game was a back-and-forth affair. Ottawa held 4–1 and 6–5 leads, while Calgary led 5–4 at one point and tied the game late {{to send it to}} overtime. The Hitmen fell short of winning the title however, as Ottawa's Matt Zultek scored the winning goal 1:58 into overtime. Brendl and Matt Kinch were named to the Memorial Cup All-Star team.|$|E
5|$|Jay Farrar, {{along with}} his {{brothers}} Wade and Dade, played in an early 1980s garage band named The Plebes. Hailing from <b>Belleville,</b> Illinois, The Plebes sought to enter a battle-of-the-bands competition but needed another high school student as a member to perform. They invited Jeff Tweedy, a high school friend of Jay Farrar, to join the band and play with them for the show. Despite a lack of skill with his instrument, Tweedy {{played an important role}} in the band by booking early gigs. While The Plebes had been playing music in a rockabilly style, Tweedy wanted to play punk rock like the music that he originally heard the group perform. This caused tensions between Tweedy and Dade Farrar, who left the band two months after Tweedy joined.|$|E
