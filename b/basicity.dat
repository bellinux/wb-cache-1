5|$|Proton sponge, 1,8-bis(dimethylamino)naphthalene, has a pKa {{value of}} 12.1. It {{is one of}} the strongest amine bases known. The high <b>basicity</b> is {{attributed}} to the relief of strain upon protonation and strong internal hydrogen bonding.|$|E
5|$|Some non-aqueous {{solvents}} can {{behave as}} acids. An acidic solvent will increase <b>basicity</b> of substances dissolved in it. For example, the compound CH3COOH {{is known as}} acetic acid because of its acidic behaviour in water. However it behaves as a base in liquid hydrogen chloride, a much more acidic solvent.|$|E
40|$|The kinetic {{method was}} used for the {{quantitative}} determination of lithium-cation affinities by Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance. This method was applied to a series of XYSO and XYSO 2 compounds. Proton <b>basicities</b> of the SO and SO 2 compounds were also determined. When comparison is made between Li+ <b>basicities</b> and proton <b>basicities,</b> a linear regression encompassing XYSO and XYSO 2 families suggests that Li+ may be bonded in a similar way to the SO and SO 2 moieties, that is, to only one oxygen on the latter. PM 3 calculations support this hypothesis...|$|R

40|$|AbstractEnergy-variable collisionally {{activated}} dissociation (CAD) {{was used}} to analyze noncovalent interactions of protonated peptide/polyether complexes in a quadrupole ion trap complexes were formed {{with a series of}} four polyether host molecules and thirteen peptide molecules. Comparison of dissociation thresholds revealed correlations between the gas-phase <b>basicities</b> of the peptides and polyether molecules and the onset of dissociation. The dissociation thresholds of complexes containing the tripeptides or pentapeptides were inversely proportional to the gas-phase <b>basicities</b> of the sites of protonation of the peptides. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding of the pentapeptides affected the observed dissociation thresholds as well. The dissociation thresholds also scaled proportionally to the gas-phase <b>basicities</b> of the polyethers in the complexes, and the importance of the conformational flexibility of the polyether ligand was confirmed for one of the histidine-containing tripeptide complexes...|$|R
5|$|Solid ionic {{compounds}} {{have long}} been used as paint pigments, and are resistant to organic solvents, but are sensitive to acidity or <b>basicity.</b> Since 1801 pyrotechnicians have described and widely used metal-containing ionic compounds as sources of colour in fireworks. Under intense heat, the electrons in the metal ions or small molecules can be excited. These electrons later return to lower energy states, and release light with a colour spectrum characteristic of the species present.|$|E
5|$|Boron trifluoride is planar and {{possesses}} {{an incomplete}} octet. It {{functions as a}} Lewis acid and combines with Lewis bases like ammonia to form adducts. Carbon tetrafluoride is tetrahedral and inert; its group analogues, silicon and germanium tetrafluoride, are also tetrahedral but behave as Lewis acids. The pnictogens form trifluorides that increase in reactivity and <b>basicity</b> with higher molecular weight, although nitrogen trifluoride resists hydrolysis and is not basic. The pentafluorides of phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony are more reactive than their respective trifluorides, with antimony pentafluoride the strongest neutral Lewis acid known.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{nucleic base}} of {{guanosine}} and 2'-deoxyguanosine {{does have an}} exocyclic amino group, its <b>basicity</b> is low to an extent {{that it does not}} react with phosphoramidites under the conditions of the coupling reaction. However, a phosphoramidite derived from the N2-unprotected 5'-O-DMT-2'-deoxyguanosine is poorly soluble in acetonitrile, the solvent commonly used in oligonucleotide synthesis. In contrast, the N2-protected versions of the same compound dissolve in acetonitrile well and hence are widely used. Nucleic bases adenine and cytosine bear the exocyclic amino groups reactive with the activated phosphoramidites under the conditions of the coupling reaction. By the use of additional steps in the synthetic cycle or alternative coupling agents and solvent systems, the oligonucleotide chain assembly may be carried out using dA and dC phosphoramidites with unprotected amino groups. However, these approaches currently remain in the research stage. In routine oligonucleotide synthesis, exocyclic amino groups in nucleosides are kept permanently protected over {{the entire length of the}} oligonucleotide chain assembly.|$|E
50|$|The methyl {{groups of}} DMSO are only weakly acidic, with a pKa=35. For this reason, the <b>basicities</b> of many weakly basic organic {{compounds}} {{have been examined}} in this solvent.|$|R
40|$|Cysteamine, cysteine, homocysteine, their homodisulfides and 9 related {{compounds}} were studied by 1 H NMR-pH titrations and case-tailored evaluation methods. The resulting acid-base properties are quantified {{in terms of}} 33 macroscopic and 62 microscopic protonation constants and the concomitant 16 interactivity parameters, providing thus the first complete microspeciation of this vitally important family of biomolecules. The species- and site-specific <b>basicities</b> are interpreted by means of inductive and hydrogen-bonding effects through various intra- and intermolecular comparisons. The pH-dependent distribution of the microspecies is depicted. The thiolate <b>basicities</b> determined this way provide exclusive means for the prediction of thiolate oxidizabilities, a key parameter to understand and influence oxidative stress at the molecular level...|$|R

The efficiency of singlet excited energy transfer from neutral free-base/zinc(n) porphyrin to diprotonated porphyrin unit could be fine tuned by varying acidity in the covalently linked dimers...|$|R
5|$|Lanthanum and {{actinium}} {{are sometimes}} considered the remaining members of group 3. In their most commonly encountered tripositive ion forms, these elements {{do not possess}} any partially filled f-orbitals, thus continuing the scandium—yttrium—lanthanum—actinium trend, {{in which all the}} elements have relationship similar to that of elements of the calcium—strontium—barium—radium series, the elements' left neighbors in s-block. However, different behavior is observed in other d-block groups, especially in group 4, in which zirconium, hafnium and rutherfordium share similar chemical properties lacking a clear trend. It has however been argued that this is irrelevant because the principle of increasing <b>basicity</b> down the table is more fundamental, and because the behavior of the group 3 elements is more similar to their s-block neighbors than their d-block neighbors.|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} elements in organic chemistry. Many organic functional groups involve a carbon–nitrogen bond, such as amides (RCONR2), amines (R3N), imines (RC(=NR)R), imides (RCO)2NR, azides (RN3), azo compounds (RN2R), cyanates and isocyanates (ROCN or RCNO), nitrates (RONO2), nitriles and isonitriles (RCN or RNC), nitrites (RONO), nitro compounds (RNO2), nitroso compounds (RNO), oximes (RCR=NOH), and pyridine derivatives. C–N bonds are strongly polarised towards nitrogen. In these compounds, nitrogen is usually trivalent (though it can be tetravalent in quaternary ammonium salts, R4N+), with a lone pair that can confer <b>basicity</b> on the compound by being coordinated to a proton. This may be offset by other factors: for example, amides are not basic because the lone pair is delocalised into a double bond (though they may act as acids at very low pH, being protonated at the oxygen), and pyrrole is not acidic because the lone pair is delocalised as part of an aromatic ring. The amount of nitrogen in a chemical substance can be determined by the Kjeldahl method. In particular, nitrogen is an essential component of nucleic acids, amino acids and thus proteins, and the energy-carrying molecule adenosine triphosphate and is thus vital to all life on Earth.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the precise}} {{chemical}} and physical factors involved in ion suppression {{are not fully}} understood, it has been proposed that <b>basicity,</b> high concentration, mass and more intuitively, co-elution with the analyte of interest are factors which should not be ignored.|$|E
50|$|In supra{{molecular}} chemistry, molecular tweezers {{based on}} a chenodeoxycholic acid scaffold is a urea receptor that can contain anions in its binding pocket in order of affinity: H2PO4− (dihydrogen phosphate) > Cl− > Br− > I− reflecting their <b>basicities</b> (tetrabutylammonium counter ion).|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{experimental}} and theoretical methods of determination of gas-phase <b>basicities,</b> proton affinities and protonation entropies {{are presented in}} a tutorial form. Particularities and limitations of these methods when applied to polyfunctional molecules are emphasized. Structural effects during the protonation process in the gas-phase and their consequences on the corresponding thermochemistry are reviewed and classified. The role {{of the nature of}} the basic site (protonation on non-bonded electron pairs or on pi-electron systems) and of substituent effects (electrostatic and resonance) are first examined. Then, linear correlations observed between gas-phase <b>basicities</b> and ionization energies or substituent constants are recalled. Hydrogen bonding plays a special part in proton transfer reactions and in the protonation characteristics of polyfunctional molecules. A survey of the main properties of intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonding in both neutral and protonated species is proposed. Consequences on the protonation thermochemistry, particularly of polyfunctional molecules are discussed. Finally, chemical reactions which may potentially occur inside protonated clusters during the measurement of gas-phase <b>basicities</b> or inside a protonated polyfunctional molecule is examined. Examples of bond dissociations with hydride or alkyl migrations, proton transport catalysis, tautomerization, cyclization, ring opening and nucleophilic substitution are presented to illustrate the potentially complex chemistry that may accompany the protonation of polyfunctional molecules...|$|R
25|$|Second {{generation}} proton sponges {{are known}} with even higher <b>basicity.</b> 1,8-bis(hexamethyltriaminophosphazenyl)naphthalene or HMPN is prepared from 1,8-diaminonaphthalene by reaction with tris(dimethylamino)bromophosphonium bromide {{in the presence}} of triethylamine. HMPN has a pKBH+ of 29.9 in acetonitrile which is more than 11 orders of magnitude higher than Proton Sponge.|$|E
25|$|The {{selection}} of a matrix {{is the first step}} when preparing samples for MALDI analysis. The primary goals of the matrix are to absorb the energy from a laser, thus transferring it to the analyte molecules, and to separate the analyte molecules from each other. A consideration that should be taken into account when choosing a matrix is what type of analyte ion is expected or desired. Knowing the acidity or <b>basicity</b> of the analyte molecule compared with the acidity or <b>basicity</b> of the matrix, for example, is valuable knowledge when choosing a matrix. The matrix should not compete with the analyte molecule, so the matrix should not want to form the same type of ion as the analyte. For example, if the desired analyte has a high amount of acidity, it would be logical to choose a matrix with a high amount of <b>basicity</b> to avoid competition and facilitate the formation of an ion. The pH of the matrix {{can also be used to}} select what sample you want to obtain spectra for. For example, in the case of proteins, a very acidic pH can show very little of the peptide components, but can show very good signal for those components that are larger. If the pH is increased towards a more basic pH, then smaller components become easier to see.|$|E
25|$|When {{both the}} Lewis acidity of the organolithium {{compound}} and the Lewis <b>basicity</b> of the substituent are high, as in lithiations of ortho-(dialkylamino)methyl toluenes with n-butyllithium in a non-coordinating solvent, coordination {{of the base}} to the heteroatom substituent takes place. Lithiation then occurs at the most kinetically accessible ortho benzylic position; ortho lithiation is slower in this case.|$|E
40|$|AbstractElectrospray {{ionization}} {{mass spectrometry}} (ESI-MS) is increasingly used {{to probe the}} nature of noncovalent complexes; however, assessing the relevance of gas-phase results to structures of complexes in solution requires knowledge {{of the types of}} interactions that are maintained in a solventless environment and how these might compare to key interactions in solution. This study addresses the factors impacting the strength of hydrogen bonding noncovalent interactions in the gas phase. Hydrogen bonded complexes consisting of ammonium ions bound to polydentate ethers are transported to the gas phase with ESI, and energy-variable collisional activated dissociation (CAD) is used to map the relative dissociation energies. The measured relative dissociation energies are correlated with the gas-phase <b>basicities</b> and steric factors of the amine and polyether constituents. To develop correlations between hydrogen bonding strength and structural features of the donor and acceptor molecules, a variety of amines with different gas-phase <b>basicities</b> and structures were selected, including primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, as well as those that are bidentate to promote intramolecular hydrogen bonding. The acceptor molecules are polydentate ethers, such as 18 -crown- 6. Four primary factors influence the observed dissociation energies of the polyether/ammonium ion complexes: the gas-phase <b>basicities</b> of the polyether and amine, steric effects of the amines, conformational flexibility of the polyethers, and the inhibition of intramolecular hydrogen bonds of the guest ammonium ions in the resulting ammonium/polyether noncovalent complexes...|$|R

Only the neutral form of these nucleophiles can be active during ribosomal peptidyl transfer catalysis...|$|R
50|$|The {{properties}} of acids and bases {{are relevant to}} physical organic chemistry. Organic chemists are primarily concerned with Brønsted-Lowry acids/bases as proton donors/acceptors and Lewis acids/bases as electron acceptors/donors in organic reactions. Chemists use a series of factors developed from physical chemistry -- electronegativity/Induction, bond strengths, resonance, hybridization, aromaticity, and solvation—to predict relative acidities and <b>basicities.</b>|$|R
25|$|Y-aromaticity is {{a concept}} {{developed}} to explain the extraordinary stability and high <b>basicity</b> of the guanidinium cation. Guanidinium is not a ring molecule, and is cross-conjugated rather than a linear π system, but {{is reported to have}} its six π-electrons delocalized over the whole molecule. The concept is controversial and some authors emphasize different effects.|$|E
25|$|The kinetic <b>basicity</b> of n-BuLi is {{affected}} by the solvent or cosolvent. Ligands that complex Li+ such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA), hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA), and 1,4-diazabicyclooctane (DABCO) further polarize the Li-C bond and accelerate the metalation. Such additives can also aid in the isolation of the lithiated product, a famous example of which is dilithioferrocene.|$|E
25|$|ESI has a {{more complex}} {{ionisation}} mechanism, relying heavily on droplet charge excess and as such {{there are many more}} factors to consider when exploring the cause of ion suppression. It has been widely observed that for many analytes, at high concentrations, ESI exhibits a loss of detector response linearity, perhaps due to reduced charge excess caused by analyte saturation at the droplet surface, inhibiting subsequent ejection of gas phase ions from further inside the droplet. Thus competition for space and/or charge may be considered as a source of ion suppression in ESI. Both physical and chemical properties of analytes (e.g. <b>basicity</b> and surface activity) determine their inherent ionisation efficiency. Biological sample matrices naturally tend to contain many endogenous species with high <b>basicity</b> and surface activity, hence the total concentration of these species in the sample will quickly reach levels at which ion suppression should be expected.|$|E
40|$|A {{family of}} ligands derived from bis(amino amides) {{containing}} aliphatic spacers has been prepared, and their protonation and stability constants {{for the formation}} of Cu 2 + complexes have been determined potentiometrically. Important differences are associated to both the length of the aliphatic spacer {{and the nature of the}} side chains derived from the amino acid. In general, ligands containing aliphatic side chains display higher <b>basicities</b> as well as stability constants with Cu 2 +. In the same way, <b>basicities</b> and stability constants tend to increase when decreasing the steric hindrance caused by the corresponding side-chain. FT-IR, UV-vis and ESI-MS were used for analyzing the complex species detected in the speciation diagram. UV-vis studies showed the presence of different coordination environments for the copper(II) complexes. Complexes with different stoichiometries can be formed in some instances. This was clearly highlighted with the help of ESI-MS experiments...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCationic liposomes {{are used}} as the {{carriers}} of polyanionic genes for combating against hereditary diseases in gene therapy. Studies directed to careful biophysical characterizations of the cationic liposomes commonly used in gene delivery have just begun. Herein, we report on a novel liposomal exo-surface bound indazolization reaction of an amphiphilic arenediazonium salt as evidence {{for the existence of}} remarkably alkaline exo-surface of cationic liposomes commonly used in gene transfection. Our results demonstrate that formation of 5 -hexadecyl- 7 -methylindazole in thermla indazolization of 2, 6 -dimethyl- 4 -hexadecylbenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate bound to liposome surface is a strong indication for the existence of significantly high exo-surface pH for cationic liposomes commonly used in gene delivery.

25|$|Polarity can be {{separated}} to different contributions. For example, the Kamlet-Taft parameters are dipolarity/polarizability (π*), hydrogen-bonding acidity (α) and hydrogen-bonding <b>basicity</b> (β). These {{can be calculated}} from the wavelength shifts of 3–6 different solvatochromic dyes in the solvent, usually including Reichardt's dye, nitroaniline and diethylnitroaniline. Another option, Hansen's parameters, separate the cohesive energy density into dispersion, polar and hydrogen bonding contributions.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of cobalt(III) chloride, CoCl3, is disputed, although this compound {{is listed in}} some compendia. According to Greenwood and Earnshaw, the only stable binary compounds of cobalt and the halogens, excluding CoF3, are the dihalides. Stated differently, CoCl2 is unreactive toward Cl2. The stability of Co(III) in solution is considerably increased {{in the presence of}} ligands of greater Lewis <b>basicity</b> than chloride, such as amines.|$|E
500|$|Effects of the solvent and {{solvation}} {{should be}} mentioned also in this section. It turns out, these influences are more subtle {{than that of}} a dielectric medium mentioned above. For example, the expected (by electronic effects of methyl substituents) and observed in gas phase order of <b>basicity</b> of methylamines, Me3N > Me2NH > MeNH2 > NH3, is changed by water to [...] Me2NH > MeNH2 > Me3N > NH3. Neutral methylamine molecules are hydrogen-bonded to water molecules mainly through one acceptor, N–HOH, interaction and only occasionally just one more donor bond, NH–OH2. Hence, methylamines are stabilized to about the same extent by hydration, regardless of the number of methyl groups. In stark contrast, corresponding methylammonium cations always utilize all the available protons for donor NH–OH2 bonding. Relative stabilization of methylammonium ions thus decreases with the number of methyl groups explaining the order of water <b>basicity</b> of methylamines.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{thermochemical}} acid/base {{properties of}} the six dihydroxybenzoic acids (x,y-DHB) as prototypical matrices used in matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) have been investigated. The ground-state gas-phase <b>basicities</b> (GB) of the six DHB isomers and the gas-phase acidities (ΔGacid) of the corresponding radical cations ([x,y-DHB]·+) have been determined by Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry employing the thermokinetic method.

The obtained gas-phase acidities of the corresponding radical cations vary from 815 kJ mol− 1 for the most acidic species, 3, 4 -DHB, to 858 kJ mol− 1 for the least acidic one, 2, 5 -DHB. The results indicate that ground-state proton transfer from the matrix radical cations to the analyte {{may play a role}} in the ionization process of MALDI, whereas proton transfer from protonated matrix molecules can be excluded...|$|R
40|$|Three {{series of}} novel trisubstituted guanidines {{containing}} {{at least one}} hydrogen bond accepting (HBA) group were modelled using B 3 LYP/ 6 – 311 þG(2 df,p) //B 3 LYP/ 6 – 31 G(d) calculations.

Calculated gas-phase <b>basicities</b> (GBs) ranged from 1035 to 1181 kJmol 1 depending {{on the nature of the}} substituent. To rationalise changes in the GB, a correlation of GB against two independent variables (pKHB and s 4 B) was conducted where pKHB served as the descriptor of the hydrogen bond strength and s 4 B was introduced to describe changes in the GBs in the open-chain model systems, i. e. in the absence of intramolecular hydrogen bond (IMHB), caused by the electronic effect of the propyl-HBA substituent. A very good correlation of the calculated gas-phase <b>basicities</b> against these two independent variables was established for all three sets of the bases...|$|R
