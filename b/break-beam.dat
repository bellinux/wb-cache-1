50|$|Triggers are the player's {{primary means}} of {{interacting}} with the marker. The amount of force required to fire the marker, {{as well as the}} distance the trigger travels before actuating, called the throw, has a marked effect upon the player's ability to achieve high rates of fire. Many markers, especially higher priced markers, use electronic trigger frames with a variety of sensing methods, including micro-switches, hall effect sensors or <b>break-beam</b> infra-red switches. These triggers have short throws, allowing a high rate of fire. Non-electronic markers sometimes use carefully set pneumatic to achieve a light and short trigger pull.|$|E
