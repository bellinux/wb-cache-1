500|$|Calgary Sun {{columnist}} Eric Francis called McMahon's {{decision to}} continue the event [...] "sick, disrespectful and wrong. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> would you expect from the WWF?" [...] He added, [...] "if there's any justice in this world, McMahon will pay dearly for what his organization has done to further pain the Harts". Some fans were also upset with the decision to carry on with the show. One man, who left the event with his children upon hearing that Hart had died, claimed, [...] "It was disgusting.... For kids to see that, {{for this to be}} so-called family entertainment, for them to just carry on as if nothing had happened, is just sad." [...] Martha Hart, Owen's wife, refused to criticize McMahon publicly {{in the immediate aftermath of}} her husband's death. She said that McMahon [...] "absolutely should be there" [...] at the funeral. She also stated, [...] "I'm a very forgiving person and I'm not bitter or angry, but there will be a day of reckoning". Commenting on the WWF's decision {{to continue the}} show after her husband's death, Martha stated, [...] "After he lost his fight for life they just scooped him up and ordered the next match out. Where's the humanity? Would he have wanted the show to go on? Absolutely not." ...|$|E
500|$|The Dreamcast {{version was}} heavily criticized. Ryan Davis of GameSpot stated that [...] "the {{best bet for}} all {{involved}} would be to take your chips elsewhere". Similarly, IGN editor Jeremy Dunham noted that [...] "the blandness of the game's presentation would probably disappoint {{the most basic of}} cavemen. Even the graphics are disappointing. True, those card tables can look very realistic, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> is there to marvel at? Nothing! Without any type of exploration feature, or other characters there isn't anything to render". Allgame's Bryan Hightower criticized that [...] "there are not enough games, there are annoying wait times, and the help mode is terrible". He also complained that [...] "the dealer deals painfully slow and has to say what cards you have twice. You can already read your hand right on the screen, so you don't need the dealer to waste your time". Hightower also cited that [...] "when you win at slots, the camera always goes {{to the bottom of the}} machine to show you the payout scale" [...] which [...] "becomes frustrating after a few credits because it is so slow. The act of leaving the table or machine is even slower". He also said that the advice the game gives you is [...] "Perhaps the most irritating 'feature' of this game" [...] because [...] "Each time you do something the computer wouldn't have done, a pop-up screen will appear that adds more time to the lengthy procedure of completing a bet". Hightower commented that [...] "The above-par graphics are quickly negated by the rock-bottom enjoyment factor" [...] and that [...] "this game doesn't have any of the character the real casino has".|$|E
2500|$|Some {{believe that}} Book of Mormon lands must {{be located in}} a volcanically active region, {{but there is no}} {{explicit}} mention of volcanoes or volcanism in the text. Smoke caused by the burning of forests and timber cities can be ascertained, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> may have contributed to episodes of daytime darkness described in the Book of Mormon is not clear. The Book of Mormon seems to make a distinction between the [...] "vapor of smoke" [...] and [...] "mist" [...] (water vapor?). ( [...] , , , [...] ). Author Phyllis Carol Olive is perhaps the first expert on Book of Mormon lands {{to call attention to the}} article titled [...] "THE DARK DAYS AND EARTHQUAKES IN CANADA" [...] published in The Historical Magazine and Notes and Queries Concerning the Antiquities, History and Biography of America, Vol. VIII, 1864. It is a historical fact that the regions of Canada just to the north of New York have been subject not only to violent earthquakes but also enigmatic episodes of daytime darkness so profound and extensive that observes, right or wrong, have attributed the phenomena to volcanism. The Historical Magazine of 1864, cites several documented examples and presents the opinions of notable witnesses of the phenomena.|$|E

2500|$|During the Patriots bye week, Belichick {{stated that}} Moss [...] "is the smartest {{receiver}} he's ever been around." [...] He compared Moss' {{ability to see}} the field and anticipate plays to that of Tom Brady, and to Lawrence Taylor who Belichick coached with the New York Giants. He said Moss not only knows what he's doing on a play, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> everybody <b>else</b> on the field is doing as well. [...] "That's what makes them special.

6000|$|Yes, {{it was a}} joy, and we {{were still}} {{shoulder}} to shoulder: if I might continue sure of that I should care <b>but</b> little <b>what</b> <b>else</b> happened.
