5|$|In early October, UB-42 had {{returned}} to the <b>Black</b> <b>Sea,</b> when she was ordered to deliver five Georgians with gold to finance a Georgian independence movement. While remaining in the <b>Black</b> <b>Sea,</b> UB-42 sank the sailing ships Agios Georgios on 10 October, and Francesco Patrino in November. On 22 November, she torpedoed the 1,086-ton Siracusy while the latter was at anchor off the Georgian coast. UB-46 also shelled Tuapse while in the northern <b>Black</b> <b>Sea.</b>|$|E
5|$|NATO {{increased}} its naval {{presence in the}} <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> significantly following the Russian invasion, with ships docking in Georgian ports, {{and according to the}} US Navy, delivering humanitarian aid. NATO said that its presence in the <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> was not related to the Georgian crisis; its vessels were conducting typical visits and preplanned naval exercises with Romania and Bulgaria. Russian General Anatoliy Nogovitsyn reminded NATO of the limit on the number of vessels allowed in the <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> under the 1936 Montreux convention. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev questioned the claim that ships going to Georgia were bringing only humanitarian assistance, alleging the delivery of military material. According to political analyst Vladimir Socor, the US maintained a continual presence in the <b>Black</b> <b>Sea.</b> The ships were rotated {{from time to time in}} the <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> because of the constraints on ship's weight and length of visits set by the Montreux Convention.|$|E
5|$|Russia saw the <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> {{coast and}} {{the border with}} Turkey as {{invaluable}} strategic attributes of Georgia. Russia had more vested interests in Abkhazia than in South Ossetia, since the Russian military presence on the <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> coast was seen as vital to Russian influence in the <b>Black</b> <b>Sea.</b> Before the early 2000s, South Ossetia was originally intended {{as a tool to}} retain a grip on Georgia.|$|E

5|$|After Romania {{joined the}} war {{on the side of}} the Triple Entente in August and was quickly overrun by the Central Powers, the Russian efforts in the <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> in the second half of 1916 were focused in the west. Because German {{submarines}} never really accomplished all that much in the <b>Black</b> <b>Sea,</b> the February 1917 resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare led the Germans to temporarily abandon the <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> in lieu of the more target-rich Mediterranean. UB-14s whereabouts and activities during the latter half of 1916 and the first few months of 1917 are unreported in sources.|$|E

5|$|The {{vegetation}} of Strandzha evolved {{before the}} formation of the Bosphorus Strait when the whole southern <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> coast was linked and represents the westernmost extension of the Euxine-Colchic ecoregion.

Under those conditions the region has preserved relict species from the Neogene.|$|E

5|$|A naval {{confrontation}} {{took place}} between Russian and Georgian ships on 10 August. According to the Russian Ministry of Defence, the Russian navy sank one Georgian vessel after four Georgian missile boats had attacked the Russian Navy ships {{off the coast of}} Abkhazia. The Russian patrol ship Mirazh was probably responsible for the sinking. The Georgian coast was blockaded by vessels of the Russian <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> Fleet on 10 August. The <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> Fleet, which participated in the military conflict {{for the first time since}} 1945, had probably departed from Sevastopol before full-scale hostilities between Russia and Georgia began.|$|E
5|$|A {{small number}} of Ju 87s were also {{retained}} for anti-shipping operations in the <b>Black</b> <b>Sea,</b> a role it had proved so successful in when operating in the Mediterranean. In October 1943, this became evident again when StG 3 carried out several attacks against the Soviet <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> Fleet. On 6 October 1943 the most powerful flotilla in the fleet comprising the Leningrad class destroyers Kharkov, Besposhchadny and Sposobny were caught and sunk by dive -bombing. After the disaster, Josef Stalin decreed that no more ships were to pass within range of German aircraft without his personal permission.|$|E
5|$|After the Ottoman Empire entered World War I, Berk-i Satvet was {{employed}} in patrols in the <b>Black</b> <b>Sea.</b> These included attacks on Russian ports with the ex-German warships Yavuz Sultan Selim and Midilli. In January 1915, Berk-i Satvet struck a naval mine while escorting a convoy to Zonguldak; the explosion severely damaged {{the ship and}} kept her out of service until April 1918. For {{the remainder of the}} war, she patrolled the <b>Black</b> <b>Sea.</b> The ship was renamed Berk in 1923 and modernized twice, in the mid-1920s and in the late-1930s. She remained in service until 1944, when she was stricken from the naval register. Berk was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1953–55.|$|E

5|$|Cyprus {{appears to}} be the {{principal}} intermediary station between Mycenaean Greece and the Middle East, based on the considerable greater quantities of Mycenaean goods found there.

5|$|Feth-i Bülend saw {{extensive}} {{service in}} the <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, based primarily at Batumi.

On 23 July, she engaged the Russian armed steamer Vesta in an inconclusive action. Poor visibility from smoke and escaping steam forced the ships to disengage, both with slight damage and few casualties. On the 31st, Feth-i Bülend and several other ships departed Batumi for Trabzon to bring ground troops to Varna to defend against an expected Russian attack across the Danube.|$|E
