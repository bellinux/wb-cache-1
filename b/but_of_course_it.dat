25|$|Jean Grey {{appears in}} Wolverine and the X-Men, voiced by Jennifer Hale, as a {{supporting}} character. After a mysterious explosion at the Institute, Jean was lost and the X-Men disbanded until Wolverine reformed the X-Men. Mr. Sinister fooled Cyclops in to thinking that Jean {{was in the}} villain's clutches <b>but</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>it</b> was only a set-up. Unknown to anyone, Jean was in a hospital. When she finally awoke, the doctors asked for her name {{but she could not}} remember anything.|$|E
500|$|CSKA manager Valery Gazzaev praised {{his players}} despite their loss and hinted that {{injuries}} {{may have been}} a factor in the loss: [...] "The game was satisfactory – we had followed the plan we set out, but still we made two mistakes. On the whole I think our team played very well <b>but</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>it</b> is a shame we didn't win. We had a lot of good opportunities but we couldn't do it. Liverpool played as we expected – they played quite aggressively. We didn't feel uncomfortable but we made a couple of mistakes." [...] Gazzaev rued the injuries his team suffered indicating {{there might have been a}} different outcome had certain players been fit.|$|E
500|$|After Ferrari's {{victory at}} the {{previous}} race, their team principal Jean Todt, said that [...] "we {{seemed to be in}} a strong position <b>but,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>it</b> is the order at the finish that counts", while Michael Schumacher said that his car's tyres dropped in performance after taking his first pit stop. McLaren technical director Adrian Newey said that the pit stop strategy was crucial in winning the race: [...] "The tyre wear did not spring any surprises on us {{and we were able to}} trust our estimations and co-ordinate the pit-stops to our best advantage." [...] Villeneuve was happy with his strong finish and was surprised by his good start. Heidfeld, who made contact with his teammate Alesi during the race, apologised for the collision. Ralf Schumacher said that he reduced his pace to secure his fifth position. Trulli described his race as [...] "difficult" [...] because of the hot temperatures though he praised his mechanics for their work.|$|E

6000|$|... "Sure," [...] replied Pat, [...] "if he's {{reasonably}} husky, {{and most}} woodsmen are. A smart axeman can roll one up in four days, <b>but</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>it's</b> easier and quicker {{if there are}} two." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite so, quite so," [...] said Mr. Wells soothingly. [...] "I wish {{we could}} have spared you the pain and {{publicity}} <b>of</b> an inquest, <b>but</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>it's</b> quite unavoidable {{in the absence of}} a doctor's certificate." ...|$|R
500|$|On 29 September 1939, {{soon after}} the start of the war, Godfrey {{circulated}} a memorandum that, [...] "bore all the hallmarks of... Lieutenant Commander Ian Fleming", according to historian Ben Macintyre. It was called the Trout Memo and compared the deception of an enemy in wartime to fly fishing. The memo contained a number of schemes to be considered for use against the Axis powers to lure U-boats and German surface ships towards minefields. Number 28 on the list was an idea to plant misleading papers on a corpse that would be found by the enemy; the suggestion is similar to Operation Mincemeat, the successful 1943 plan to conceal the intended invasion of Italy from North Africa, although that idea was developed by Charles Cholmondoley in October 1942. The recommendation in the Trout Memo was titled: [...] "A Suggestion (not a very nice one)", and continued: [...] "The following suggestion is used in a book by Basil Thomson: a corpse dressed as an airman, with despatches in his pockets, could be dropped on the coast, supposedly from a parachute that has failed. I understand there is no difficulty in obtaining corpses at the Naval Hospital, <b>but,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>it</b> {{would have to be a}} fresh one." ...|$|E
500|$|Spears's {{relationship}} {{of three years}} with pop singer Justin Timberlake ended in 2002 after months of speculation. In November 2002, Timberlake released the song [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] as the second single from his solo debut album. The music video featured a Spears look-alike and fueled the rumors {{that she had been}} unfaithful to him. [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] is often credited as being the song that propelled the album into the charts. In September 2001, Annet Artani accepted to become a backing vocalist for Spears's 2001–2002 Dream Within a Dream Tour. Her interactions with Spears during most of the tour were limited to small conversations at the gym and vocal warm ups. Artani had begun a relationship with the show's musical director during 2002; however, it was not working out well {{by the end of the}} tour. Before the last date in Mexico City, Spears called her and asked about the relationship. Artani told her they were going to break up, to which Spears responded, [...] "Don't worry about it, you're going to hang out with me". Following the end of the tour, Spears and Artani began to forge a friendship. Spears invited Artani to her house in Los Angeles, California. According to Artani, their relationship grew out of their shared romantic experiences at the time. She explained, [...] "Basically, we commiserated because she, at that time, had broken up with Justin [...] Maybe like nine months before, <b>but</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>it</b> was really fresh in the media. I was just breaking up with this guy, so we kind of like—I think we kind of needed each other." [...] Artani stayed at Spears's house for a few weeks, in which they started writing songs at the piano. Shortly after, they traveled to Lake Como in Lombardy, Italy. Artani added, [...] "It was me and her, her stylist and Felicia, and we had this humongous house to ourselves, and they had a piano there as well".|$|E
2500|$|Foster cites his {{interest}} in bass guitar as coming from hearing Duane Eddy's song [...] "Rebel Rouser" [...] for the first time. [...] "A school friend played the 78 on his parents' big radiogram and it just filled the room with this powerful sound. It {{was one of those}} rare moments when your soul is touched and I realised that the deep sound behind Eddy's guitar came from something called a bass guitar, though I didn't see one until I watched Jet Harris on TV. So I bought an acoustic guitar for £2 and figured that I'd get that bass sound if I just tuned the strings down an octave, <b>but</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>it</b> just made a pointless, flapping noise." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{like your}} pluck, my lad, and can, perhaps, {{give you a}} lift. Skip shall have a flea in his ear before the whistle sounds again; <b>but,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>it's</b> none <b>of</b> my {{business}} what happens after working hours." ...|$|R

2500|$|Ozu {{told me to}} come [...] in {{the room}} [...] and circle around. So I did as I was told, <b>but</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>it</b> wasn’t good enough. After the third take, Ozu {{approved}} it… The reason [...] circles around the room once is that she’s nostalgic for all the memories there and she also wants to make sure she’s left nothing behind. He didn’t show each of these things explicitly, but through my smoothly circling the room—through how I moved, through the pacing and the blocking—I think that’s {{what he was trying to}} express. At the time, I didn’t understand. I remember I did it rhythmically: I didn’t walk and I didn’t run; I just moved lightly and rhythmically. As I continued doing it, that’s what it turned into, and Ozu okayed it. Come to think of it, it was that way of walking rhythmically that I think was good. I did it naturally, not deliberately. And of course it was Ozu who helped me do it.|$|E
2500|$|... "Copyright {{protection}} for computer software is a given, but I {{do not feel}} that the courts should be astute to extend that protection into a region where only the functional effects of a program are in issue. There is a respectable case for saying that copyright is not, in general, concerned with functional effects, and there is some advantage in a bright line rule protecting only the claimant's embodiment of the function in software and not some superset of that software. The case is not truly analogous with the plot of a novel, because the plot is part of the work itself. The user interface {{is not part of the}} work itself. One could permute all the letters and other codes in the command names, and it would still work in the same way, and all that would be lost is a modest mnemonic advantage. To approach the problem in this way may at least be consistent with the distinction between idea and expression that finds its way into the Software Directive, <b>but,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>it</b> draws the line between idea and expression in a particular place which some would say lies too far on the side of expression. I think, however, that such is the independence of the particular form of the actual codes used from the overall functioning of the software that it is legitimate to separate them in this way, and not to afford them separate protection when the underlying software is not even arguably copied." ...|$|E

As to height, one might put in a good-sized skylight; {{it would not be}} usual, <b>but</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>it</b> could be done." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am not a}} comic actor, really," [...] he explained. [...] "I {{could play}} Romeo, so far as feeling is concerned, and play it damned well. There is a fine vein of poetry in me. <b>But</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>it's</b> no good to me with this face of mine." ...|$|R

And then I don’t mind you two knowing that I am afraid of going out alone.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Elena Dan died in 1996 in an accident. Angela Gheorghiu commented, [...] "she {{was more}} than a sister to me... She was only a year younger. We were inseparable almost like twins, {{although}} she was blonde and green-eyed. She was another me. <b>But,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>it's</b> worse for my mother.

5000|$|.....while writing it, I never {{considered}} that Blood and Guts in High School is especially anti-male, {{but people have}} been very upset about it on that ground.

2500|$|The name 'Reboux' is {{mentioned}} in Thérèse Desqueyroux, a novel written by François Mauriac {{and published in}} 1927: « Anna de la Trave was wearing an overcoat of light grey cloth and a felt hat without ribbon or trimming of any sort ('though,' said Madame de la Trave, 'it costs more like that than the hats {{we used to have}} with all those feathers and aigrettes. <b>But,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>it's</b> the very finest quality felt from Lailhala's — a Reboux model.') » ...|$|R
