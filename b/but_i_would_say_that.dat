500|$|Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club {{gave it a}} {{slightly}} more critical review, awarded it a [...] "B". He compared the episode the third season episode [...] "A Benihana Christmas", writing that [...] "both deal with Michael’s heart being broken and the somewhat self-destructive ways he deals with it." [...] However, {{he felt that the}} episode [...] "struggles greatly if you have no emotional connection to Holly and Michael" [...] because it [...] "isn't funny, by any real stretch of the term, nor is it really intended to be funny." [...] He went on to say [...] "I like episodes like this one in general and don't necessarily need the show to make me laugh, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I wanted this hour to be slightly more... pleasant." ...|$|E
2500|$|Journalist James Traub {{wrote that}} [...] "Manhattan is a remorseless place to which its {{citizens}} are peculiarly adapted. and of which out-of-towners seem unaccountably fond. It was designed that way. ... I {{would never say}} that what I love about New York is its [...] "utility," [...] <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the utilitarian street plan has made possible the helter-skelter, pell-mell life of the city [...] which is what I do love." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} {{paragraph}} of Plot It Yourself, Archie relates his own method of grading what Wolfe is reading, {{on a scale from}} A to D. If Wolfe picks up a book before he rings for beer, and if he has marked his place with a thin strip of gold given to him by a grateful client, the book is an A. [...] "I haven't kept score, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> of the two hundred or so books he reads in a year not more than five or six get an A," [...] Archie writes. In The Red Box (chapter 12), Wolfe uses a thin strip of ebony to mark his place as he re-reads Seven Pillars of Wisdom. Archie indicates in various stories that Wolfe prefers to finish a paragraph before acknowledging an interruption in his reading. He often dog-ears a page to mark his place.|$|E

5000|$|.....<b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> 'Sodom and Gomorra, get {{the point}} Somoza', so colonel Luna Solórzano would call me before he would sue me to say 'Don't think that we're stupid, because we know {{perfectly}} well who you're talking about and we know you're badmouthing the Guard." ...|$|R
5000|$|Personal Computer Games [...] "The 3D {{graphics}} {{are up to}} New Generations usual {{high standard}} and the sound is also very well used. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> the game lacks the sort of variation which has made games like Arcadia and Manic Miner such big hits" [...] 5/10 ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{two young}} English {{officers}} {{were convinced that}} Ruiz was mad. How do you say that?--tile loose--eh? But the doctor, an observant Scotsman with much shrewdness and philosophy in his character, {{told me that it}} was a very curious case of possession. I met him many years afterwards, but he remembered the experience very well. He told me too that in his opinion that woman did not lead Gaspar Ruiz into the practice of sanguinary treachery by direct persuasion, but by the subtle way of awakening and keeping alive in his simple mind a burning sense of an irreparable wrong. Maybe, maybe. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> she poured half of her vengeful soul into the strong clay of that man, as you may pour intoxication, madness, poison into an empty cup.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not so, my son," [...] said Bridgenorth. Then {{checking}} {{himself as}} he observed the deep crimson in Julian's cheek and brow, he added, [...] "I crave your pardon for such familiarity; but I meant not to limit what I said even now to such trifling consequences, {{although it may be}} something salutary to tear men from their pomps and luxuries, and teach those to be Romans who would otherwise be Sybarites. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> <b>that</b> times of public danger, as they call into circulation the miser's hoard and the proud man's bullion, and so add to the circulating wealth of the country, do also call into action many a brave and noble spirit, which would otherwise lie torpid, give no example to the living, and bequeath no name to future ages. Society knows not, and cannot know, the mental treasures which slumber in her bosom, till necessity and opportunity call forth the statesman and the soldier from the shades of lowly life to the parts they are designed by Providence to perform, and the stations which nature had qualified them to hold. So rose Oliver--so rose Milton--so rose many another name which cannot be forgotten--even as the tempest summons forth and displays the address of the mariner." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "As the {{possibility}} of real political change recedes, people do need symbols of resistance; {{it makes them feel}} better, and Che is that par excellence. Yes, he was handsome. Yes, he died young. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> more important than any of those things, he was a rebel."

"Well, miss, I {{will do as}} {{you tell}} me, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> quite respectful, <b>I</b> {{hope that you will}} bear in mind, if things goes wrong, that I was dead against it, and that it was only because you said that it was our only chance of finding Master Walter that I agreed to lend a hand." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "My {{parents were}} very good parents. It was a {{conservative}} family — very strongly conservative family. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{the main thing that}} shaped my character besides my parents was the fact that I grew up in fascist Spain. It's difficult for people of the younger generation to realize what that means, even for the Spanish younger generation. You had actually to resist the whole environment, and to be yourself, you had to fight and to politicize yourself from the age of fifteen or sixteen".|$|E
5000|$|... "I would, I think, now {{still say}} that we {{maintain}} academic boycott insofar as, if for instance academics from here {{want to go to}} South Africa then {{you want to look at}} who is inviting them. Under whose auspices are they going? Are they going to institutions that have a good track record in their opposition to apartheid? <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> as things begin to ease up, this ought perhaps to be one of the first of the constraints that goes to give some of these people the reward." ...|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} republished at Lspace, the Terry Pratchett wiki, Pratchett explains the concepts behind the novel. [...] "It'd {{be easier for}} people to read Interesting Times, than sum it up, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> one of things I wanted to develop in the story was the strange way in which revolutions can turn into tyrannies. People struggle to over-throw tyrants, then suddenly find that they're ruled by [...] "The Government" [...] once again - and popular uprisings don't stop often to ask common people what it is they need." ...|$|E
5000|$|One obvious {{difference}} {{between art and}} games {{is that you can}} win a game. It has rules, points, objectives, and an outcome. Santiago might cite a sicimmersive game without points or rules, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> then it ceases to be a game and becomes a representation of a story, a novel, a play, dance, a film. Those are things you cannot win; you can only experience them. Roger Ebert ...|$|R
5000|$|Perhaps I {{am not in}} a {{condition}} to express a clear, deliberate opinion, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> to the good citizens of Cochise County there is three {{things you have to}} do. There is a class of cut-throats among you and you can never convict them in court. You must combine and protect yourselves and wipe them out, or you must give up the country to them, or you will be murdered one at a time, as my son has been. B. L. Peel.|$|R
5000|$|My {{feeling at}} the time (2002-2003) was we had a {{recession}} followed by a growth recession till 03. That’s what I showed on those Global Insight recession/growth recession charts. Mike Nemeira (Chief Economist, International Council of Shopping Centers) a better expert than I am, and I debated this. He thought there was an argument for a quick full recovery then a lapse into a growth recession. There is no agreed standard for growth recession. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> while it looked stronger for a couple quarters, it wasn’t real strong.|$|R
5000|$|Chicago's Organic Theater Company {{opened the}} {{original}} play Warp! in 1971. Co-author Stuart Gordon in 2002 recalled its original inspiration: [...] "It was three full-length plays that {{were inspired by}} Marvel Comics. ... Well, we weren't {{able to get the}} rights to any of the characters from Marvel, so we created our own. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Warp was very influenced by comic books like Dr. Strange and Thor". Billed by the company as [...] "the world's first science fiction epic-adventure play in serial form", it was performed for over a year before moving to Broadway.|$|E
5000|$|Fauxnique (dancer & {{performance}} artist Monique Jenkinson) {{became the first}} faux queen {{to win a major}} drag pageant - competing against male or MTF drag queens - when she was crowned Miss Trannyshack 2003. From Bust Magazine: [...] "'(drag) comes down to a sort of self-awareness, a self-consciousness about playing around with femininity,' says Fauxnique. She adds that while drag for her is primarily about performance, it's also a 'rejection of traditional oppressive forms of masculinity_—and that's part of an affinity with gay men as well. I wouldn't say every faux queen is a feminist, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> a part of them is in some way.'" ...|$|E

60|$|All that I could say, then, {{with respect}} to farming on a large scale--I have always {{cultivated}} a garden--was, that I had had my seeds ready. Many think that seeds improve with age. I {{have no doubt that}} time discriminates between the good and the bad; and when at last I shall plant, I shall be less likely to be disappointed. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> to my fellows, once for all, As long as possible live free and uncommitted.

So {{in the context of}} that particular match it had little relevance, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> it was of lasting value to Australian rugby in the years to come. That is because of the way it was scored. Mark Ella cross-kicked a long ball to me on the left wing. I gathered and touched down wide out. It {{was probably one of the}} early demonstrations of the partnership, the understanding between Mark and myself, which was to beat fruit on many, many occasions for Australia, Randwick and finally for Amatori in Milan." ...|$|R

5000|$|Like most directors, I {{want to show}} {{a variety}} of work. I've done Shakespeare, Chekhov, and O'Neill, {{as well as new}} work. Some people have defined my body of work as being {{dominated}} by female characters, and this play is no exception. I have collaborated many times with Elizabeth Ashley, who plays the matriarch in Dividing, I don't necessarily subscribe to the notion that I am [...] "a woman's director." [...] <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I am drawn to plays that deal with family situations. In the plays I work on I want there to be a real moment of catharsis. I am always looking to let the audience have some kind of emotional connection. That's {{one of the reasons why}} I love Horton's Foote plays so much: they allow that connection.|$|E

5000|$|Prior to the Sweden {{recording}} sessions, Duff {{has recorded}} numerous folk-pop tracks, {{some of which}} she has spoken of during interviews. Among them is a track titled [...] "If I Fall" [...] which Duff has described as [...] "about me taking {{a step back and}} kind of shutting down my whole business, and everyone not believing in me and me being really scared to be alone after I'd been surrounded by 100 people for five years of my life." [...] The song never made the final cut. She also said, [...] "And then the other ones are like, some party songs, a song about son Luca, a song about my separation and my love for this person that maybe we're not meant to be together, or maybe we are. I mean, it's very, very personal, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> it has a happy spirit to it, which is me." ...|$|E

5000|$|In April 2014, RZA {{spoke about}} Raekwon's {{hesitation}} to {{record on the}} album, saying: [...] "I haven’t {{had a chance to}} really talk to him about why not. All I see is the press going back and forth. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> maybe creatively we on different paths. I’m creatively different than I was in the ‘90s." [...] In an April 2014, interview with Rolling Stone Raekwon responded saying: [...] "I don’t know why he said he didn’t speak to me, because he did speak to me. We spoke about two weeks ago. It was me, him, his brother and business partner Devine and we talked about why I’m not there right now. They know where I’m at {{and at the end of}} the day, him saying he didn’t speak to me is a bold-faced lie. And yeah, we are at creative differences because at the end of the day, I want to win. I’m used to being a winner. Being that I feel the team is being compromised by his so-called [...] "logic" [...] of making music, I have a problem with that because I love my fans. I would never want to give my fans anything other than the best. So when we’re sitting there discussing the creative process of making a great album for the fans, I’m not going to never settle for less. I’m not the only one the group that feels this way too." [...] He elaborated on the album, saying: [...] "The bottom line: I’m not happy with that. I’m not happy with the direction of the music and I’m not happy with how dudes is treating dudes’ business. What are we giving the fans? What are we giving the people that help us be here? If it don’t feel right, I can’t be fake. And I’m not the only one who feels like that. Fans want the best and I have to sit here and work that hard to give them the best. Period." [...] RZA responded, saying: [...] "When you form Voltron, you need every piece. We need him there. I want him there. I asked him over and over to be there." ...|$|E
