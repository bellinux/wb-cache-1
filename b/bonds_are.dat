5|$|Although {{homosexuality}} among females {{has taken}} place in many cultures in history, a recent phenomenon is the development of family among same-sex partners. Before the 1970s, the idea that same-sex adults formed long-term committed relationships was unknown to many people. The majority of lesbians (between 60% and 80%) report being in a long-term relationship. Sociologists credit the high number of paired women to gender role socialization: the inclination for women to commit to relationships doubles in a lesbian union. Unlike heterosexual relationships that tend to divide work based on sex roles, lesbian relationships divide chores evenly between both members. Studies have also reported that emotional <b>bonds</b> <b>are</b> closer in lesbian and gay relationships than heterosexual ones.|$|E

5|$|Copernicium is {{the tenth}} and last {{member of the}} 6d series and is the {{heaviest}} group 12 element in the periodic table, below zinc, cadmium and mercury. It is predicted to differ significantly from the lighter group12 elements. The valence s-subshells of the group 12 elements and period 7 elements {{are expected to be}} relativistically contracted most strongly at copernicium. This and the closed-shell configuration of copernicium result in it probably being a very noble metal. Its metallic bonds should also be very weak, possibly making it extremely volatile, like the noble gases, and potentially making it gaseous at room temperature. However, it should be able to form metal–metal bonds with copper, palladium, platinum, silver, and gold; these <b>bonds</b> <b>are</b> predicted to be only about 15–20kJ/mol weaker than the analogous bonds with mercury.|$|E
5|$|Early work on {{the study}} of the {{chemistry}} of rutherfordium focused on gas thermochromatography and measurement of relative deposition temperature adsorption curves. The initial work was carried out at Dubna in an attempt to reaffirm their discovery of the element. Recent work is more reliable regarding the identification of the parent rutherfordium radioisotopes. The isotope 261mRf has been used for these studies. The experiments relied on the expectation that rutherfordium would begin the new 6d series of elements and should therefore form a volatile tetrachloride due to the tetrahedral nature of the molecule. Rutherfordium(IV) chloride is more volatile than its lighter homologue hafnium(IV) chloride (HfCl4) because its <b>bonds</b> <b>are</b> more covalent.|$|E

5|$|However, not all peptide <b>bonds</b> <b>are</b> {{formed in}} this way. In a few cases, {{peptides}} are synthesized by specific enzymes. For example, the tripeptide glutathione {{is an essential}} part of the defenses of cells against oxidative stress. This peptide is synthesized in two steps from free amino acids. In the first step, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase condenses cysteine and glutamic acid through a peptide bond formed between the side chain carboxyl of the glutamate (the gamma carbon of this side chain) and the amino group of the cysteine. This dipeptide is then condensed with glycine by glutathione synthetase to form glutathione.|$|E

More recently, Grameen has started bond sales {{as a source of}} finance. The <b>bonds</b> <b>are</b> implicitly subsidised, as they are guaranteed by the Government of Bangladesh, and still they are sold above the bank rate.

5|$|They have {{membranes}} {{composed of}} glycerol-ether lipids, whereas bacteria and eukaryotes have membranes composed mainly of glycerol-ester lipids. The {{difference is the}} type of bond that joins the lipids to the glycerol moiety; the two types are shown in yellow in the figure at the right. In ester lipids this is an ester bond, whereas in ether lipids this is an ether bond. Ether <b>bonds</b> <b>are</b> chemically more resistant than ester bonds. This stability might help archaea to survive extreme temperatures and very acidic or alkaline environments. Bacteria and eukaryotes do contain some ether lipids, but in contrast to archaea these lipids are not a major part of their membranes.|$|E
30|$|The {{nature of}} M-O <b>bonding</b> <b>is</b> {{determined}} by {{the difference in the}} electronegativity of elements (χ) composed this bond.

Taking into account the properties of Ge and Zr ions (Table  4), one can see that the Zr-O <b>bond</b> <b>is</b> ionic one, whereas Ge-O <b>bond</b> <b>is</b> covalent polar. It is worth to note that the ionic strength increases with the increase of the XM-XO difference, for covalent <b>bonding</b> this relation <b>is</b> opposite.|$|R

5|$|After {{a protein}} has been ubiquitinated, it is {{recognized}} by the 19S regulatory particle in an ATP-dependent binding step. The substrate protein must then enter {{the interior of the}} 20S particle to come in contact with the proteolytic active sites. Because the 20S particle's central channel is narrow and gated by the N-terminal tails of the α ring subunits, the substrates must be at least partially unfolded before they enter the core. The passage of the unfolded substrate into the core is called translocation and necessarily occurs after deubiquitination. However, the order in which substrates are deubiquitinated and unfolded is not yet clear. Which of these processes is the rate-limiting step in the overall proteolysis reaction depends on the specific substrate; for some proteins, the unfolding process is rate-limiting, while deubiquitination is the slowest step for other proteins. The extent to which substrates must be unfolded before translocation is not known, but substantial tertiary structure, and in particular nonlocal interactions such as disulfide <b>bonds,</b> <b>are</b> sufficient to inhibit degradation. The presence of intrinsically disordered protein segments of sufficient size, either at the protein terminus or internally, has also been proposed to facilitate efficient initiation of degradation.|$|E
5|$|In a DNA double helix, {{each type}} of nucleobase on one strand bonds with just one type of nucleobase on the other strand. This is called {{complementary}} base pairing. Here, purines form hydrogen bonds to pyrimidines, with adenine bonding only to thymine in two hydrogen bonds, and cytosine bonding only to guanine in three hydrogen bonds. This arrangement of two nucleotides binding together across the double helix is called a Watson-Crick base pair. Another type of base pairing is Hoogsteen base pairing where two hydrogen bonds form between guanine and cytosine. As hydrogen <b>bonds</b> <b>are</b> not covalent, they can be broken and rejoined relatively easily. The two strands of DNA in a double helix can thus be pulled apart like a zipper, either by a mechanical force or high temperature. As {{a result of this}} base pair complementarity, all the information in the double-stranded sequence of a DNA helix is duplicated on each strand, which is vital in DNA replication. This reversible and specific interaction between complementary base pairs is critical for all the functions of DNA in living organisms.|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} elements in organic chemistry. Many organic functional groups involve a carbon–nitrogen bond, such as amides (RCONR2), amines (R3N), imines (RC(=NR)R), imides (RCO)2NR, azides (RN3), azo compounds (RN2R), cyanates and isocyanates (ROCN or RCNO), nitrates (RONO2), nitriles and isonitriles (RCN or RNC), nitrites (RONO), nitro compounds (RNO2), nitroso compounds (RNO), oximes (RCR=NOH), and pyridine derivatives. C–N <b>bonds</b> <b>are</b> strongly polarised towards nitrogen. In these compounds, nitrogen is usually trivalent (though it can be tetravalent in quaternary ammonium salts, R4N+), with a lone pair that can confer basicity on the compound by being coordinated to a proton. This may be offset by other factors: for example, amides are not basic because the lone pair is delocalised into a double bond (though they may act as acids at very low pH, being protonated at the oxygen), and pyrrole is not acidic because the lone pair is delocalised as part of an aromatic ring. The amount of nitrogen in a chemical substance can be determined by the Kjeldahl method. In particular, nitrogen is an essential component of nucleic acids, amino acids and thus proteins, and the energy-carrying molecule adenosine triphosphate and is thus vital to all life on Earth.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bond</b> length <b>is</b> {{related to}} <b>bond</b> order: when more {{electrons}} participate in bond formation the <b>bond</b> <b>is</b> shorter. <b>Bond</b> length <b>is</b> also {{inversely related to}} bond strength and the bond dissociation energy: all other factors being equal, a stronger <b>bond</b> will <b>be</b> shorter.

5|$|The {{chemical}} bond between atoms occurs {{as a result}} of electromagnetic interactions, as described by the laws of quantum mechanics. The strongest <b>bonds</b> <b>are</b> formed by the sharing or transfer of electrons between atoms, allowing the formation of molecules. Within a molecule, electrons move under the influence of several nuclei, and occupy molecular orbitals; much as they can occupy atomic orbitals in isolated atoms. A fundamental factor in these molecular structures is the existence of electron pairs. These are electrons with opposed spins, allowing them to occupy the same molecular orbital without violating the Pauli exclusion principle (much like in atoms). Different molecular orbitals have different spatial distribution of the electron density. For instance, in bonded pairs (i.e. in the pairs that actually bind atoms together) electrons can be found with the maximal probability in a relatively small volume between the nuclei. By contrast, in non-bonded pairs electrons are distributed in a large volume around nuclei.|$|E
5|$|Voter {{approval}} of the referendum created a public–private partnership. The Washington State Public Stadium Authority was created to oversee public ownership of the stadium, exhibition center, and parking garage complex. Allen purchased the Seahawks and formed First & Goal Inc. to build and operate the facility. The budget for the project was $430million. Of this cost, $44million was allotted to build the Event Center, $26million for the parking garage, and $360million for the stadium. First & Goal was to cover cost overruns and pay up to $130million of the project while the contribution from the public was capped at $300million. The public funding package included new sports-related state lottery games, taxes on the facility's admissions and parking, sales tax credits and deferrals, and an eight-year extension of the 2% tax on hotel rooms in King County. The taxes on admissions and parking are set at 2% {{to pay off the}} project's tax-exempt bonds. Those taxes will be kept below the authorized 10% to preserve the tax-exempt status, but the percentage will be increased to the full amount when the <b>bonds</b> <b>are</b> completely paid in 2021.

5|$|The 1s1 {{electron}} configuration of hydrogen, while superficially {{similar to that}} of the alkali metals (ns1), is unique because there is no 1p subshell. Hence it can lose an electron to form the hydron H+, or gain one to form the hydride ion H−. In the former case it resembles superficially the alkali metals; in the latter case, the halogens, but the differences due to the lack of a 1p subshell are important enough that neither group fits the properties of hydrogen well. Group 14 is also a good fit in terms of thermodynamic properties such as ionisation energy and electron affinity, but makes chemical nonsense because hydrogen cannot be tetravalent. Thus none of the three placements are entirely satisfactory, although group 1 is the most common placement (if one is chosen) because the hydron is by far the most important of all monatomic hydrogen species, being the foundation of acid-base chemistry. As an example of hydrogen's unorthodox properties stemming from its unusual {{electron configuration}} and small size, the hydrogen ion is very small (radius around 150fm compared to the 50–220pm size of most other atoms and ions) and so is nonexistent in condensed systems other than in association with other atoms or molecules. Indeed, transferring of protons between chemicals is the basis of acid-base chemistry. Also unique is hydrogen's ability to form hydrogen bonds, which are an effect of charge-transfer, electrostatic, and electron correlative contributing phenomena. While analogous lithium <b>bonds</b> <b>are</b> also known, they are mostly electrostatic. Nevertheless, hydrogen can take on the same structural role as the alkali metals in some molecular crystals, and has a close relationship with the lightest alkali metals (especially lithium).|$|E
