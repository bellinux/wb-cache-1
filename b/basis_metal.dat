40|$|The {{porosities}} of gold electroplates on copper may {{be determined}} by mea-suring the corrosion potentials of the speclmens vs. a suitable reference electrode in an electrolyte {{which serves as a}} mild corrodant for the exposed <b>basis</b> <b>metal.</b> The corrosion potentials of gold-plated copper specimens in 0. 1 M NH 4 CI electrolyte are shown to vary with the exposed area fraction of copper according to an expression derived by Stern. It is possible to calibrate the technique so that values of the exposed <b>basis</b> <b>metal</b> area fraction in electro-plated specimens can be estimated to a reasonable approximation. The method is simple and offers very high sensitivity, particularly at low porosities. Op-erational considerations and sources of error are discussed.

40|$|Smart hydrogels are {{promising}} materials for actuators and sensors, {{as they can}} respond to small changes in their environment with a large property change.

40|$|Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) {{needs to}} be treated {{before it can be}} re-used or {{discharged}} in receiving water bodies due to the low pH, high salinity and high sulphate concentrations of the water. Several treatment methods are currently applied including chemical treatment (e. g. eutralisation of the low pH waters), physical treatment (e. g. reverse osmosis) and biological treatment to reduce the high sulphate concentration. When treating AMD biologically, sulphate reducing bacteria (SRB) reduce sulphate to sulphide, provided that a suitable and cost effective carbon and energy source is present. In the resent study mine water was remediated iologically, using the degradation products of grass-cellulose, as carbon and energy sources for the sulphate reducing bacteria. A laboratory scale one stage anaerobic bioreactor (20 L volume) containing grass cuttings and biomass consisting of rumen fluid microorganisms and immobilized SRB, was initially fed with synthetic sulphate rich water and later with diluted AMD. The results indicated an average of 86 % sulphate removal efficiency when feeding synthetic sulphate rich feed water to the reactor. When feeding diluted AMD, the highest sulphate removal efficiency was 78 %. The sulphate removal was dependant on Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) concentrations in the reactor.

40|$|Zinc-nickel ?-phase {{silicate}} and copper-nickel silicate {{corrosion resistant}} coatings {{have been prepared}} via electrochemical methods to improve currently available corrosion resistant materials in {{the oil and gas}} industry. A layered silicate, montmorillonite, has been incorporated into the coatings for increased corrosion protection. For the zinc nickel silicate coatings, optimal plating conditions were determined to be a working pH range of 9. 3 - 9. 5 with a borate based electrolyte solution, resulting in more uniform deposits and better corrosion protection of the <b>basis</b> <b>metal</b> as compared to acidic conditions. Quality, strongly adhering deposits were obtained quickly with strong, even overall coverage of the metal substrate. The corrosion current of the zinc-nickel-silicate coating is Icorr = 3. 33 E- 6 for a borate based bath as compared to a zinc-nickel bath without silicate incorporation (Icorr = 3. 52 E- 5). Step potential and direct potential methods were examined, showing a morphological advantage to step potential deposition. The effect of borate addition was examined in relation to zinc, nickel and zinc-nickel alloy deposition. Borate was found to affect the onset of hydrogen evolution and was examined for absorption onto the electrode surface. For copper-nickel silicate coatings, optimal conditions were determined to be a citrate based electrolytic bath, with pH = 6. The solutions were stable over time and strong adhering, compact particle deposits were obtained. The corrosion current of the copper-nickel-silicate coatings is Icorr = 3. 86 E- 6 (copper-nickel coatings without silicate, Icorr = 1. 78 E- 4). The large decrease in the corrosion current as the silicate is incorporated into the coating demonstrates the increase in corrosion resistance of the coatings with the incorporation of silicates...|$|E
40|$|Esta pesquisa foi realizada com os objetivos de caracterizar a microbiologia e avaliar a estabilidade aeróbia de silagens de capim-marandu contendo polpa cítrica peletizada (PCP). A forragem colhida foi submetida aos seguintes tratamentos: silagem de capim-marandu; silagem de capim-marandu + 5 % PCP e silagem do capim-marandu + 10 % de PCP com base na matéria natural. As alterações químicas e microbiológicas foram feitas aos 0, 2, 4 e 6 dias após a abertura dos silos (tambores de metal com 80 cm de altura e 50 cm de diâmetro). Na avaliação da estabilidade aeróbia por meio da alteração da temperatura, 3 kg de silagem foram colocados em caixas de isopor, que foram armazenadas em câmara climática. Nos dois ensaios realizados, utilizou-se delineamento inteiramente ao acaso com cinco repetições, em esquema de parcelas subdivididas, de modo que os níveis de PCP na silagem corresponderam às parcelas e o tempo, às subparcelas. As silagens sem polpa apresentaram desenvolvimento de bacilos e enterobactérias e aumento do pH no decorrer do desabastecimento dos silos. A presença de leveduras foi detectada nas silagens contendo o aditivo e aumentou do primeiro ao sexto dia de aeração. A digestibilidade {{in vitro}} da matéria seca (DIVMS) reduziu com o aumento dos tempos de aeração. A temperatura nas silagens com 10 % de PCP aumentou durante a aerobiose.
