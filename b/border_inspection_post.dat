40|$|The {{present report}} aims to {{determine}} the currency of the present system for healthrelated control of frozen fishery products at <b>border</b> <b>inspection</b> <b>posts,</b> {{with regard to the}} pathogenic species of the genus Vibrio and more specifically, V. cholerae, V. parahaemolyticus and V. vulnificus. In view of the current scientific knowledge and risk assessment, the application of microbiological criteria at <b>border</b> <b>inspection</b> <b>posts</b> is justified as an additional and complementary control measure. With regard to V. cholerae specifically, it is recommended to apply a zero-tolerance criterion without distinguishing between serotypes. In case of serotypes other than O: 1 and O: 139, it is recommended to identify the products with the greatest risk for consumers and to adopt effective surveillance measures. With respect to V. parahaemolyticus, the application of a maximum limit of 102 cfu/g is considered adequate and the microbiological criterion and sampling plan established at <b>border</b> <b>inspection</b> <b>posts</b> for this species are adequate and sufficient. In catches from areas at risk, a special surveillance plan should be established as a preliminary step for the adoption of another kind of criterion. Similarly, it is recommended to extend the surveillance over fish and shellfish from areas at risk to V. vulnificus. In addition, it is recommended to keep certain caution with respect to the same areas (at risk) for any other species of Vibrio, particularly those considered here. Furthermore, it should be highlighted that the temperature at which fish and fish products are maintained is of critical importance in the control of potential outbreaks due to these micro-organisms. In Spain, in light of available data, the risk of suffering illness due to the ingestion of contaminated fishery products can be generally classified as very low...|$|R

40|$|Summary: The {{presentation}} {{will discuss}} the requirements for veterinary border checks and procedures as a key pillar for preventing the introduction of any risks to human and animal health into a country originating from imports or transits of live animals and products thereof. To a certain extent also rules on animal welfare during transport of live animals have been taken into account considering the possibility of bottlenecks at the veterinary <b>border</b> <b>inspection</b> <b>posts.</b> Specific criteria and conditions for efficient and effective veterinary border checks are already laid down in specific chapters of the OIE Codes. Veterinary border checks need an all-inclusive legal framework and require a competent and credible Veterinary Service both at central and border post level. In addition, an adequate infrastructure for carrying out the veterinary border checks is required, which {{should be based on}} a long-term strategy and be properly resourced. Furthermore, harmonised procedures for performing the veterinary border checks should be in place, be transparent and based on scientific evidence.

30|$|The {{globalisation}} {{of world}} commerce {{is a process}} that permanently alters the living conditions of all human beings. Here in Europe, we meet with the ramifications of these changes on a daily basis. These include the international exchange of goods. Evaluation of the European Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed shows that health safety problems which in recent years have become rare in Europe are more common when dealing with food products imported from third world countries. These include excessive levels of heavy metals, inadequate hygiene, unapproved veterinary pharmaceuticals in animal-derived foodstuffs or excessive levels of pesticides in fruits and vegetables. The Veterinary <b>Border</b> <b>Inspection</b> <b>Post</b> Hesse (TGSH) was created in 1993 {{with the opening of the}} inner-European market. This was necessary in order to provide protection for living animals arriving at Frankfurt/Main Airport as well as to control infectious diseases of animals and importation of animal-derived foodstuffs. On 1 January 2005, the TGSH became Department V of the Hesse State Laboratory. Measured by the number of shipments of animal and plant products, the TGSH is one of the largest ports of entry in Europe. The Perishable Centre Frankfurt (PCF) is a 9, 000 -m² interim refrigeration facility in which imported goods are stored before transport to their final destination.|$|E
40|$|Many countries, {{in order}} to {{authorise}} the use of food irradiation, claim the availability of methods to detect the occurred treatment {{in addition to the}} respect of safe use of this technology. Among physical methods, the electron spin resonance (ESR) measuring the number of free radicals that are formed during irradiation can be applied only to those foods with cellulose, a crystalline or bone structure, in which free radicals have a shelf life greater than irradiated product. The aim {{of this study was to}} highlight an irradiation treatment in European and extra-European foods marketed in Southern Italy by the means of ESR technique. Furthermore, {{in order to}} optimise the preparation procedures the efficacy of the above mentioned method in fish scales experimentally irradiated has been evaluated. From February to September 2012, a total number of 83 samples of food products of animal and plant origin were taken at the <b>border</b> <b>inspection</b> <b>post</b> and at retail market and finally analysed.

40|$|The {{importation}} of fishery products into the European Union (EU) is constantly rising. The {{aim of this}} study was to conduct a survey on labeling non-compliances on fishery products imported from extraFuropean countries, in collaboration with the veterinary staff of the <b>Border</b> <b>Inspection</b> <b>Post</b> of Livorno Pisa (BIP), of the Italian Ministry of Health. The correspondence between the products' identity and the scientific denominations reported on the accompanying certificates was checked using the DNA Iparcoding method. Overall, 277 products belonging to different categories (fish, cephalopods, crustaceans, bivalves, amphibian) were submitted to analysis for species identification. The comparison of the molecular results with the scientific names declared on the accompanying documents showed that 22. 5 % (95 %CI 17. 8 - 28. 0) of the analyzed products were mislabeled. The highest percentage of mislabeling was observed on cephalopod based products (43. 8 %, 95 % CI 32. 3 - 55. 9), followed by crustaceans (17. 0 %, 95 % CI 9. 2 - 29. 2) and'fish (14. 0 %, 95 % CI 8. 7 - 21. 9). A higher rate was found in products imported from China, Vietnam and Thailand. The present study is the first survey on mislabeling in products sampled at BIPs in Italy. The results highlight the need of implementing analytical checks, based on DNA analysis, on incoming fishery products. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Because {{food fraud}} can harm {{human health and}} erode {{consumer}} trust, {{it is imperative that}} it is detected at an early stage. Therefore the aim {{of this study was to}} predict the expected food fraud type for imported products for which the product category and country of origin are known in order to target enforcement activities. For this purpose we used a Bayesian Network (BN) model that was developed based on adulteration/fraud notifications as reported in the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) in the period 2000 – 2013. In this period 749 food fraud notifications were reported and were categorised in 6 different fraud types (i) improper, fraudulent, missing or absent health certificates, (ii) illegal importation, (iii) tampering, (iv) improper, expired, fraudulent or missing common entry documents or import declarations, (v) expiration date, (vi) mislabelling. The data were then used to develop a BN model. The constructed BN model was validated using 88 food fraud notifications reported in RASFF in 2014. The proposed model predicted 80 % of food fraud types correctly when food fraud type, country and food category had been reported previously in RASFF. The model predicted 52 % of all 88 food fraud types correctly when the country of origin or the product-country combination had not been recorded before in the RASFF database. The presented model can aid the risk manager/controller in <b>border</b> <b>inspection</b> <b>posts</b> in deciding which fraud type to check when importing products...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} funded by the Nottingham University Business School {{with the support of the}} International Meat Trade Association (IMTA) and the Association of Port Health Authorities (APHA), amongst others. It involved: a {{detailed}} review of current import procedures applicable to importing meat into the United Kingdom (UK) from outside of the European Union (EU); an in-depth study of the trade and customs compliance costs as experienced by three meat importers of chilled and frozen beef and lamb (each importing meat worth more than £ 100 million per year) as well as those of two freight forwarders (agents) specialising in the meat trade; and field visits to the port health inspection facilities (so called <b>Border</b> <b>Inspection</b> <b>Posts,</b> BIPs) at two major UK ports. Cost findings have been confirmed by the IMTA secretariat as being representative (with the caveat that they are subject to market dynamics and the commercial relationships between importers, shippers, shipping lines, ports and agents).

40|$|Assessing {{the risk}} of disease {{introduction}} in imports THERE is a continual low risk of the introduction of an exotic disease into the UK and the EU from an affected region, such as Africa, the Middle East and Central/East Asia, but occasionally that risk level can be raised when a particularly high-risk route becomes more prominent. For example, if migratory wild birds with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) were reported in northern Europe, {{the risk of}} an incursion of HPAI into the UK poultry industry may be increased, depending on the species of bird and the migration season. Likewise, an outbreak of disease in domestic livestock in a country from which the UK imports that species will trigger an increase in risk. Defra currently considers {{that there would be}} a negligible risk of an exotic disease being introduced from an affected country through legal imports because of the system of approval and certification laid down in EU law for countries approved for export to the EU. Before a non-EU country is approved to export, it must have an acceptable disease status, the recognised standard for relevant control authorities, and guarantees regarding compliance with EU import rules. All live animals and products of animal origin (POAO) imported from non-EU countries must be accompanied by veterinary certification. Such imports are checked at approved facilities at <b>Border</b> <b>Inspection</b> <b>Posts.</b> However, there would be an increased risk of disease introduction if, for some reason, the certification process had failed, either due to fraud or if an infected consignment was certified in good faith before the disease was detected in the country of origin. The International Disease Monitoring team at Defra was first set up after the 2001 foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in the UK, with an aim to horizon scan for new threats to the UK livestock population. It uses official disease reports from around the world to monitor disease risk and trends in new and emerging diseases. These reports come fro...|$|R
