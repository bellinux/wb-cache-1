25|$|The last {{murder to}} involve Gravano was {{the murder of}} Louie DiBono, the made man Gravano had {{threatened}} to kill earlier. Gravano described {{the reasons for the}} murder in Underboss: He was still robbing the family and I asked for permission to take him out. But John had a meeting with DiBono, and DiBono told John that he had a billion dollars of drywall work that was coming out of the World Trade Center. John <b>bit,</b> <b>hook,</b> line and sinker, and refused my request. John said he would handle DiBono personally and become his partner. But DiBono was up to his old tricks double-dealing. He had obviously been bullshitting John. So when John called Louie in for meetings to discuss their new partnership, DiBono didn't show up. John was humiliated. This meant an automatic death penalty. John gave the contract to DiBono's captain, Pat Conte. Conte botched an ideal opportunity to kill DiBono. Then, as Gotti grew increasingly impatient, Conte explained that the problem now was trying to corner DiBono again. Whenever a meeting with him was arranged, DiBono never appeared. It was a joke, what was going on. I couldn't help laughing to myself. I told John why didn't Pat simplify everything. Just call Louie up and tell him to hang himself. Ten months went by. John looks like an asshole. He was too embarrassed even to ask me for help.|$|E

5000|$|Elisabeth de Vaudey was {{a member}} of the lower nobility, {{described}} by her contemporaries as [...] "a very pretty woman, witty, a musician, with a nice voice, well educated, but also very much an intriguer." [...] By another she is described as [...] "charming, entirely graceful, entirely sweet, with a pretty face, very good teeth, admirable blonde hair, an aquiline nose (if a <b>bit</b> long, <b>hooked</b> and of plain character), a remarkable hand, a very small foot." ...|$|R

50|$|Walsh's {{work has}} been {{described}} as “bright and snappy music rooted in modernism, but also referencing the carefree attitude of American pop culture...having brightly contrasting, sharply spliced sections, funkily angular rhythmic loops, motives that are disjunct and dissonant, but function a <b>bit</b> like pop <b>hooks,</b> and harmonies that aren’t tonal, but also tend to accept the idea that a 'tonal center' isn’t a bad thing” (Fanfare Magazine, March/April 2009). In 2008 Albany Records released Walsh's first solo CD, Bugaboo, with the New York New Music Ensemble.|$|R
5000|$|Ben Foster of Country Universe {{gave the}} song an A grade. He writes that this song, [...] "soars with an airy, {{infectious}} melody, and a delightful fiddle and steel-friendly arrangement recalling {{the country music}} of the nineties." [...] He {{goes on to say}} that, [...] "Corbin's inviting vocal delivery coasts along on the catchy melody with the same breezy abandon that made “Roll with It” so lovable." [...] He finishes by saying that, [...] "The song hits all the right stops to create the perfect feel-good jam, with the cheeky-sounding guitar licks and the “Little bit o’ left, little <b>bit</b> o’ right” <b>hook</b> almost seeming to mimic the movements of the swerving vehicle." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Welcome to England" [...] {{received}} favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. Ed Miller from Drowned in Sound {{stated that the}} song is [...] "both a return to classic Tori and autobiographical songwriting, and an indicator that this record is free from the high concepts that mark most of her 21st century output." [...] Jurek commented [...] "The refrain creates a <b>bit</b> of a <b>hook,</b> at least enough to catch the ear, but that's all." [...] He also highlighted the song as an album standout. Chris Mincher from The A.V. Club had commented that while he enjoyed the song, as an alternative musician, {{he said that it}} would've been [...] "better from actual rock bands". Ivorytowerz.com said [...] "The end result is pleasant, but a bit lightweight, despite its lyrical foundation about seduction." [...] Andie Noonan from The Southern Star declared the song as [...] "classic Amos" [...] and said [...] "song wouldn’t be out of place as an English folk song." ...|$|R
40|$|As {{horses are}} {{introduced}} to carrying a saddle and rider, they are also introduced to carrying a bit. The horse’s teeth should be evaluated prior to <b>bitting.</b> Points and <b>hooks</b> should be filed and wolf teeth should be removed. Wolf teeth are small, shallow-rooted teeth typically found in the upper jaw {{just in front of}} the first molar. These teeth serve no purpose and do not have long roots that set them firmly in the jawbone, thus the presence of a bit pressing against them can cause significant gum discomfort. The wolf teeth also have sharp points that can pinch the tongue. Horses with wolf teeth or other dental problems may show signs of irritation by resisting the bit, evading the bit, tossing the head, or mouthing the bit along with issues associated with proper chewing of food. (See Ag/Equine/ 2007 - 01.) A snaffle is usually the bit of choice for the young horse. Snaffles have no leverage when pressure is applied. The reins attach to the bit at the level of the mouth piece (Figure 1). This attachment means that when the rider applies 5 pounds of pressure, the horse feels 5 pounds of pressure. Unlike the snaffle, leverage bits can multipl...|$|R
50|$|The U.S. bearing {{industry}} {{by this point}} was a $1 billion business, having tripled in size since World War II. As a leading producer of a broad line of anti-friction bearings, including needle, ball, roller, and specialty bearings, Torrington had benefited immeasurably from the prolific growth of the bearing industry, while the company's host of other products buttressed its financial performance. In addition to bearings, Torrington's eight domestic plants were devoted to the manufacture of nuts, screws, bolts, metal specialties, spokes and nipples, drill <b>bits,</b> surgeon needles, <b>hooking</b> and felting needles, swaging machines, and a special purpose sewing machine, lending a diversity to the company's business lines that insulated it from cyclical economic conditions to a large extent. Beyond U.S. borders, the Torrington empire comprised manufacturing facilities in England, Canada, Germany, Brazil, Italy, Portugal, and in Japan, giving the company a sizeable presence in key international markets. The domestic and international operations created a solid manufacturing entity that flourished during the 1960s. Sales, which stood at $33.6 million in 1950, totaled $67.5 million in 1960, then shot upward to $93.4 million in 1965. The following year, Torrington celebrated two century marks by reaching its 100th anniversary in business as well as reaching over $100 million in sales. By all accounts, Torrington was a thriving manufacturer—a company that had earned the respect of competitors—and now, as it mapped its course for its second century of business, it began {{to attract the attention}} of a handful of suitors intent on acquiring the venerable manufacturing concern.|$|R
5000|$|David Jeffries of Allmusic {{gave the}} album {{four out of}} five stars. This was Queen's highest rating from an editor of Allmusic, since her second studio album was give four and a half out of five stars and was named an [...] "Allmusic Album Pick" [...] in 1998. Jeffries began the review by stating that album has the [...] "usual mix of straight-up reggaeton and flirtations with pop and/or R&B" [...] however noted that Latin pop was [...] "more {{striking}} and vital". He praised [...] "the polished" [...] "Peligro De Extinción", the [...] "bitter-sweet" [...] "A Donde Va" [...] and the [...] "hard-hitting cuts" [...] "No Hay!!!" [...] and [...] "La Killer". He, however stated [...] "Real G4 Life" [...] tops them all. He described the song, which [...] "slowly slithers out of the speakers and winding about the room like a serpent about to strike." [...] He also added that all were [...] "worth inclusion" [...] on Ivy Queen's next greatest hits album. He ended the review noting the album's shortness in length however stated [...] "it's easier to praise it for being tight and lean than to complain about its brevity". His last line read [...] "Diva-status maintained". Rachel Devitt of Rhapsody commented that [...] "La reina reps [...] "Real G4 Life," [...] swinging hard and heavy in her trademark low, fierce flow. But while she grounds Musa in a thick classicism, Ivy has never been afraid of experimentation, so pop <b>hooks,</b> <b>bits</b> of cumbia and a lot of bachata abound." [...] She went on to say [...] "See booming single [...] "Peligro de Extincion," [...] which seems pretty unlikely, especially when the Queen starts talking about Juliets taking over for Romeos if the boys can't handle it." [...] Judy Cantor-Navas of Google Play said that with the release of [...] Musa, Ivy Queen [...] "remains the genre's top female star and proves again that she can hang with the big boys." [...] She noted that Queen follows similar production of her male-counterparts Daddy Yankee, Don Omar and Wisin & Yandel [...] "with a radio-friendly album heavy on diverse tropical rhythms and lavish dance-pop production." [...] She noted [...] "Cupido" [...] being a bachata track and [...] "Peligro de Extinción," [...] featuring similar musical arrangements with those found Michel Teló's [...] "Ai Se Eu Te Pego. She ended by stating [...] "songs like [...] "Como Bailo Yo" [...] and [...] "La Killer" [...] will satisfy old school reggaetón fans as Ivy Queen again lives up to her royal name." [...] Musa is nominated for Best Urban Music Album at the Latin Grammy Awards of 2013.|$|R
