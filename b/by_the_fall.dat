5|$|A {{national}} recession greatly {{affected the}} city's economy in 1982, as areas of Texas and Oklahoma {{heavily dependent on}} oil suffered the freefall in gas prices due to a glut, and a mass exodus of oil industries. Tulsa, heavily dependent on the oil industry, {{was one of the}} hardest hit cities <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of oil prices. By 1992, the state's economy had fully recovered, but leaders worked to expand into sectors unrelated to oil and energy.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} number of non-Jewish Poles also did not trust the Germans and decided not to leave the city. Many wounded Home Army soldiers became stranded during the uprising and were simply not able to evacuate in time. For others, the choice to remain resulted from feelings of despair and hopelessness brought <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of the uprising; at least initially, they simply {{did not have the}} motivation to leave.|$|E
5|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of {{his junior}} season, the Illinois class of 2014 was being {{mentioned}} {{as one of}} the all-time great statewide classes of basketball players. Chicago Sun-Times writer Joe Henricksen noted that there was a high chance that this would be the fifth Illinois class and first since 2002 to include three McDonald's All-Americans. He also noted that the class has a chance to rival if not surpass the classes of 1998 and 2011 which each had nine top 100 players.|$|E

5|$|During the 1860s, Parker {{continued}} {{both his}} {{legal and political}} careers. In 1864, he formally split from the Democratic Party over conflicting opinions on slavery. He ran as a Republican for county prosecutor of the Ninth Missouri Judicial District. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of 1864, he was serving {{as a member of}} the Electoral College and voted for Abraham Lincoln. In 1868, Parker won a six-year term as judge of the Twelfth Missouri Circuit.|$|E
5|$|Oueddei {{captured}} about 2,500 {{prisoners in}} 1977 and 1978; as a result, the Chadian Armed Forces lost at least 20% of its manpower. In particular, the National and Nomadic Guard (GNN) was decimated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of Fada and Faya. Oueddei used these victories to strengthen {{his position in}} the FROLINAT: during a Libyan-sponsored congress held in March in Faya-Largeau, the insurgency's main factions reunited themselves and nominated Oueddei as the secretary-general.|$|E
5|$|Portrait of a Lady (or Portrait of a Woman) {{is a small}} oil-on-oak panel {{painting}} executed around 1460 by the Netherlandish painter Rogier van der Weyden. The {{composition is}} built from the geometric shapes that form {{the lines of the}} woman's veil, neckline, face, and arms, and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of the light that illuminates her face and headdress. The vivid contrasts of darkness and light enhance the almost unnatural beauty and Gothic elegance of the model.|$|E

5|$|Probably {{the most}} {{important}} ecological characteristic of abyssal ecosystems is energy limitation. Abyssal seafloor communities {{are considered to be}} food limited because benthic production depends on the input of detrital organic material produced in the euphotic zone, thousands of meters above. Most of the organic flux arrives as an attenuated rain of small particles (typically, only 0.5–2% of net primary production in the euphotic zone), which decreases inversely with water depth. The small particle flux can be augmented <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of larger carcasses and downslope transport of organic material near continental margins.|$|E
5|$|African Americans were {{originally}} {{admitted to the}} university in the mid-1950s, but few attended until the 1970s; fraternities at this time were generally racially and religiously segregated. Although a student fraternity committee emphasized the fraternities' rejection of racial discrimination, in 1969 only 5 of 578 fraternity pledges were black. African-American fraternities and sororities soon established chapters at the university, although they presented themselves as service organizations rather than traditional social organizations. In the mid-1970s, although some black students were {{invited to join the}} heavily white fraternities, many preferred to join their own organizations. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of 1973, four black fraternities and one black sorority had established chapters on grounds.|$|E
5|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> 1998 {{annual meeting}} of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology, held in Utah, United States, rumors were {{circulating}} about a striking fossil of a primitive bird that was in private hands. This fossil was presented by an anonymous dealer at a gem show in Tucson, Arizona. The Dinosaur Museum in Blanding, Utah, purchased it in February 1999. The museum is run by Stephen A. Czerkas and his wife, Sylvia Czerkas. Mr. Czerkas does not hold a university degree, but he is a dinosaur enthusiast and artist. He arranged for patrons of his museum, including trustee Dale Slade, to provide $80,000 for the purchase of the fossil, in order to study it scientifically and prevent it from disappearing into an anonymous private collection.|$|E

5|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of 1844, Thayer {{left the}} {{lithography}} business {{and was replaced}} by John Bufford, a lithographer who worked for Thayer in Boston from 1939 through 1844. Previously, from 1835 through 1839, Bufford owned his own firm in New York under the title Bufford Lithographer. By the end of 1844 through 1851, the Boston company name was changed to J. H. Bufford & Co. The next, third edition, listed Bufford Lithographer so the third edition must have been printed after the beginning of the fall of 1844 but before the end of 1844. J. H. Bufford & Co. printed other Ives' games but this third edition of Ives' The Mansion Of Happiness is the only Ives' game to list Bufford Lithographer. Green was again used on one of the litho stones but the end space was a green circle. The other litho stone printed black.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{started in}} February 1962 and cost NOK3.2 million. The runway was {{completed}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of that year, but {{other parts of}} the construction were delayed. By late April 1963, the airport was lacking fire fighting equipment and ground crew had still not received sufficient training. However, the issues were resolved, allowing the airport to open on schedule on 4 May 1963. Lakselv and Kirkenes Airport also opened the same day, while Tromsø Airport opened the following year. Several important facilities were missing from Alta Airport when it opened; the control tower and the passenger terminal were not completed until 1964, so at first a shed was used as terminal.|$|E
5|$|Early {{work was}} {{promising}} and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of 1976 {{the project was}} building momentum. Fans organized a mail campaign that flooded the White House with 400,000 letters, influencing President Gerald Ford to rechristen the Space Shuttle Constitution to Enterprise. Bryant and Scott's proposal became the first accepted by the studio in October; Roddenberry immediately stopped work on other projects to refocus on Star Trek, and the screenwriters and producers were swamped with grateful fan mail. By the start of 1977 the project's official title was changed to Star Trek—The Motion Picture (a title reapplied to the eventually released 1979 film). The elation was short-lived; {{the first draft of}} the completed script was not finished until March 1, 1977, and pressure was mounting for Paramount to either begin production or cut its losses and cancel the project. Producer Jerry Isenberg began scouting filming locations and hired designers and illustrators to complement the script.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, {{there were}} reports of 640 corpses having been {{recovered}} from the Monkey William Mine in Chibondo.

5|$|Einsatzgruppe B, C, and D did not {{immediately}} follow Einsatzgruppe A's example in systematically killing all Jews in their areas. The Einsatzgruppe commanders, {{with the exception of}} Einsatzgruppe A's Stahlecker, were of the opinion <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of 1941 {{that it was impossible to}} kill the entire Jewish population of the Soviet Union in one sweep, and thought the killings should stop. An Einsatzgruppe report dated 17 September advised that the Germans would be better off using any skilled Jews as labourers rather than shooting them. Also, in some areas poor weather and a lack of transportation led to a slowdown in deportations of Jews from points further west. Thus, an interval passed between the first round of Einsatzgruppen massacres in summer and fall, and what American historian Raul Hilberg called the second sweep, which started in December 1941 and lasted into the summer of 1942. During the interval, the surviving Jews were forced into ghettos.|$|E
5|$|Germany's {{foreign policy}} {{during the war}} {{involved}} the creation of allied governments under direct or indirect control from Berlin. A main goal was obtaining soldiers from the senior allies such as Italy and Hungary and millions of workers and ample food supplies from subservient allies such as Vichy France. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of 1942, there were 24 divisions from Romania on the Eastern Front, 10 from Italy and 10 from Hungary. When a country was no longer dependable, Germany assumed full control as it did with France in 1942, Italy in 1943 and Hungary in 1944. Although Japan was an official powerful ally, the relationship was distant and there was little co-ordination or co-operation. For example, Germany refused to share their formula for synthetic oil from coal {{until late in the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, with Wellington's centre exposed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of La Haye Sainte and the Plancenoit front {{temporarily}} stabilised, Napoleon committed {{his last}} reserve, the hitherto-undefeated Imperial Guard infantry. This attack, mounted at around 19:30, {{was intended to}} break through Wellington's centre and roll up his line away from the Prussians. Although {{it is one of}} the most celebrated passages of arms in military history, it had been unclear which units actually participated. It appears that it was mounted by five battalions of the Middle Guard, and not by the grenadiers or chasseurs of the Old Guard. Three Old Guard battalions did move forward and formed the attack's second line, though they remained in reserve and did not directly assault the allied line.|$|E

5|$|Other {{actions taken}} at the 1st General Council {{addressed}} women in ministry. The Pentecostals who founded the Assemblies of God had no objections to women being engaged in ministry. The Pentecostal belief in personal experience, Spirit baptism as empowerment for service, {{and the need for}} evangelists and missionaries encouraged women to be active in all types of ministry. What concerned some Pentecostal leaders, such as Bell, were women exercising independent authority over men. The council therefore approved of the granting of credentials to female evangelists and missionaries while restricting the office of pastor to men, and it was not until 1920 that female evangelists could vote at denominational meetings. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of 1914, out of 512 credential holders, 142 were female missionaries and evangelists.|$|E
5|$|Resident Evil 5 (2009) {{is set in}} {{the fictional}} African town of Kijuju in 2009, where a {{biological}} agent has turned local residents into zombies. Valentine has been missing since a fight with her commander-turned-double agent Albert Wesker, years before the game's events. The fight is shown in the game's Lost in Nightmares downloadable content (DLC), in which Redfield and Valentine search for Umbrella's founder, Ozwell E. Spencer, inside a mansion {{on the edge of a}} cliff. Instead they find Wesker, who overpowers them. To save Redfield, Valentine tackles Wesker, and they both crash through a window and over the cliff. Their bodies are not recovered, and Valentine is declared dead. In fact she was injured <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> and saved by Wesker, who then used her as a test subject in his experiments on mutagenic viruses.|$|E
5|$|The 1637 {{event was}} popularized in 1841 {{by the book}} Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, written by British {{journalist}} Charles Mackay. At one point 12 acres (5 ha) of land were offered for a Semper Augustus bulb. Mackay claims that many such investors were ruined <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> in prices, and Dutch commerce suffered a severe shock. Although Mackay's book is a classic, his account is contested. Many modern scholars feel that the mania was not as extraordinary as Mackay described and argue that not enough price data are available to prove that a tulip bulb bubble actually occurred.|$|E
