This term generally refers to testing and analysis focused on the quality and strength of the weld, but may refer to technological actions to check for the presence, position and extent of welds. These are divided into destructive and non-destructive methods. A few examples of destructive testing include macro etch testing, fillet-weld break tests, transverse tension tests, and guided bend tests. Other destructive methods include acid etch testing, back <b>bend</b> <b>testing,</b> tensile strength break testing, nick break testing, and free <b>bend</b> <b>testing.</b> Non-destructive methods include fluorescent penetrate tests, magnaflux tests, eddy current (electromagnetic) tests, hydrostatic testing, tests using magnetic particles, X-rays and gamma ray based methods and acoustic emission techniques.

Long columns of todomatsu (Japanese fir,Abies sachalinensis Fr. Schmidt) with various length/thickness ratios were the specimens. A compressive load was axially applied to the specimen supported with pin ends. Young's modulus, the proportional limit stress, and the bending strength were obtained from the load-loading point displacement and load-strains at the outer surfaces until the occurrence of bending failure. Four-point <b>bending</b> <b>tests</b> were also conducted, and the bending properties obtained were compared with the corresponding properties obtained by the compression <b>bending</b> <b>tests.</b> Based on the experimental results, we believe that when the stress-strain relation is measured by the load-loading point displacement relation using specimens whose length/thickness ratio is large enough, the bending properties can be obtained properly using the compression <b>bending</b> <b>test.</b>|$|R

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that selective reinforcement offers the potential to significantly improve the performance of metallic structures for aerospace applications. Applying high-strength, high-stiffness fibers to the high-stress regions of aluminum-based structures can increase the structural load-carrying capability and inhibit fatigue crack initiation and growth. This paper discusses an investigation into potential methods for applying reinforcing fibers onto the surface of aluminum and aluminum-lithium plate. Commercially-available alumina-fiber reinforced aluminum alloy tapes were used as the reinforcing material. Vacuum hot pressing was used to bond the reinforcing tape to aluminum alloy 2219 and aluminum-lithium alloy 2195 base plates. Static and cyclic three-point <b>bend</b> <b>testing</b> and metallurgical analysis were used to evaluate the enhancement of mechanical performance and the integrity of the bond between the tape and the base plate. The tests demonstrated an increase in specific bending stiffness. In addition, no issues with debonding of the reinforcing tape from the base plate during <b>bend</b> <b>testing</b> were observed. The increase in specific stiffness indicates that selectively-reinforced structures could be designed with the same performance capabilities as a conventional unreinforced structure but with lower mass...|$|E
40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the effects of}} varying configurations in board-level 4 -point <b>bend</b> <b>testing</b> of BGA packages. The IPC/JEDEC 9702 test method employs 4 -point monotonic PCB bending at high strain rates to characterize the PCB strains required to cause board level interconnection failures [1].

Furthermore, the IPC- 9702 test allows flexibility in various test variables such {{as the number of}} components on a board, component size/construction, and test board dimensions. In this paper 3 -D finite element modeling has been used to compute the strain distribution in BGA solder joints subjected to 4 -point PCB bending. The FEA model has been validated with experimental strain gage data obtained from different component sizes.

In this paper, a method is proposed that allows {{the determination of the}} fatigue limit curve and the crack growth curve by means of such rotating <b>bending</b> <b>tests.</b> For this purpose, flaws of controlled shape and size are introduced on the surface of conventional round bar specimens. The rotating <b>bending</b> <b>test</b> rig is equipped with additional hardware for optical crack length measurement.

40|$|Laser welding {{can offer}} many {{advantages}} over conventional welding {{when used in}} the right applications. Some of these advantages include smaller heat affected zone (HAZ) and lower thermal stresses, narrow weld seams with smooth surfaces reducing or even eliminating additional steps of refining work, high strength coupled with low weld volume, high welding speeds relative to conventional welding and easy integration potential to name a few. Laser welding even with its obvious benefits faces a lot of skepticism among manufacturers; especially sub suppliers who could benefit the most from committing to laser welding. Conventional welding have established and proven guidelines and standards within the manufacturing industry, techniques quantifying for example the throat measure. Laser welding lacks universal measures or guidelines aside from data and documentation provided by the producer of laser welding systems. The weldability of the stainless steel EN 1. 4301 (AISI 304) sheets of 1. 5 mm thickness has been investigated. The goal has been to achieve a method {{that can be applied}} also in future investigations of other alloys. Iteration of welding parameters has been made in order to find optimized welding parameters. Butt joint welded test specimens with geometrical tolerance deviations were manufactured to investigate the process sensitivity against tolerance deviation. To characterize the influence on the mechanical properties a series of ASTM standardized mechanical tests were performed. Tests include tensile testing, <b>bend</b> <b>testing</b> and hardness testing on metallographically prepared cross-sections. Computer simulations of the heataffected zone were made using the numerical computing environment MATLAB. Results show a local increase in peak hardness of approximately 28 - 43 %. <b>Bend</b> <b>testing</b> results show that even with this local increase of the peak hardness, ductility is not critically affected. <b>Bend</b> <b>testing</b> was performed without fracture or presence of surface irregularities but for one sheet. In this case the specimens had the most extreme tolerance deviation in the specimen series, giving rise to incomplete welding and severe stress concentration. Tensile tests results show no significant effect on tensile strength and elongation at break for specimens with tolerance deviations up to 150 μm. Larger tolerance deviations showed an abrupt drop in both tensile strength and elongation at break...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{composite}} sandwich panels {{is rapidly}} increasing in the aerospace industry. In these applications, thin composite face sheets are typically co-cured to foam or honeycomb cores. One {{of the greatest}} concerns in these types of applications is face-core delamination because it can ultimately lead to catastrophic failure of the structure. Further, the effects of foreign object damage on composite sandwich structures are often catastrophic. Damage to the structure is often undetectable through visual inspection, leading to concerns of unknown interlaminar damage through {{the life of the}} structure, which can cause a catastrophic failure. This research determines the effectiveness of a damage arrestment device (DAD) on the structural integrity of composite sandwich beams. The effects of these DADs on the fatigue life of these beams following a low-velocity impact will be considered. Composite sandwich beams were constructed utilizing two layers of Advanced Composite Group LTM 45 EL/CF 1803 bi-directional woven carbon fiber face sheets with a General Plastics Last-A-Foam FR- 6710 rigid polyurethane core, and were cured utilizing an autoclave. Static 4 -point <b>bend</b> <b>testing</b> following the ASTM standard D 6272 was investigated to determine the flexural behavior of composite sandwich beams. Six different beam cases, with dimensions 1 -inch wide by 11. 75 -inch long, were investigated. The cases considered were beams with and without initial delamination and also, with DAD keys placed transversely and longitudinally with and without delamination. A drop test was employed to simulate a low-velocity impact to the composite sandwich beams with and without delamination. The flexural behavior of these two cases was determined and used in fatigue testing. Experimental results showed that the addition of DAD keys to initially delaminated composite sandwich beams improved the ultimate strength values significantly. Fatigue testing was investigated to determine the fatigue life of composite sandwich beams following a low velocity impact. Similar to static 4 -point <b>bend</b> <b>testing,</b> six different beam cases, with dimensions 1 -inch wide by 11. 75 -inch long, were investigated. The cases considered were exactly those seen in static 4 -point <b>bend</b> <b>testing</b> - beams with and without initial delamination and also with DAD keys placed transversely and longitudinally with and without delamination. The three cases without delamination were investigated in the 4 -point bend fatigue test, with and without impact. Experimental results showed that the addition of DAD keys had a significant effect on increasing the fatigue life of composite sandwich beams with initial damage from impact, and even improved the fatigue life of beams with initial delamination. A numerical investigation was completed using a finite element model (FEM) as a means to validate the experimental results found in this research. Static 4 -point <b>bend</b> <b>testing</b> was modeled using Abaqus, where maximum deflection values at a specific load were used as a comparison between the experimental and numerical results.
