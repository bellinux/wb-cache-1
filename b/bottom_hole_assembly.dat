50|$|A {{drilling}} stabilizer is a {{piece of}} downhole equipment used in the <b>bottom</b> <b>hole</b> <b>assembly</b> (BHA) of a drill string. It mechanically stabilizes the BHA in the borehole in order to avoid unintentional sidetracking, vibrations, and ensure the quality of the hole being drilled.|$|E
50|$|The {{tool string}} {{at the bottom}} of the coil is often called the <b>bottom</b> <b>hole</b> <b>assembly</b> (BHA). It can range from {{something}} as simple as a jetting nozzle, for jobs involving pumping chemicals or cement through the coil, to a larger string of logging tools, depending on the operations.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} a directional well, from a cellar chosen in surface to subsurface primary target and from this design the proper selection of drill drilling, compliance with technical security, minimal costs, utilities and environmental security. For this, was gathering information from wells correlation previously drilled at the location; useful information, such as surveys, drilling bits used in these, casings designs, depths of tops of each one of the formations crossed, rheological and hydraulic properties, <b>bottom</b> <b>hole</b> <b>assemblies</b> and directional profiles of these wells; to have at the end a summary of all the problems that caused a delay or financial loss in the drilling, this way, as a basis to make the directional wells design, being this compilation, a guide or a prevention for future errors.

5000|$|A <b>bottom</b> <b>hole</b> <b>assembly</b> (BHA) is a {{component}} of a drilling rig. It is the lowest part of the drill string, extending from the bit to the drill pipe. The assembly can consist of drill collars, subs such as stabilizers, reamers, shocks, hole-openers, and the bit sub and bit.|$|E
50|$|The Drill Floor is {{the heart}} of any {{drilling}} rig. This is the area where the drill string begins its trip into the earth. It is traditionally where joints of pipe are assembled, as well as the BHA (<b>bottom</b> <b>hole</b> <b>assembly),</b> drilling bit, and various other tools. This is the primary work location for roughnecks and the driller. The drill floor is located directly under the derrick.|$|E
50|$|Typically the {{mud motor}} {{will be one}} {{component}} of a Coiled Tubing Drilling <b>bottom</b> <b>hole</b> <b>assembly.</b> The BHA also provides directional survey, gamma, pressure, temperature, and in some cases, petrophysical logs as drilling progresses. The latest generation of advanced Coiled tubing drilling BHAs offer the ability to steer the bit, enabling the wellâ€™s trajectory to be corrected {{in response to the}} measurements taken by the sensors.|$|E
5000|$|An MWD {{downhole}} tool is also [...] "high-sided" [...] with the <b>bottom</b> <b>hole</b> drilling <b>assembly,</b> enabling the wellbore to be steered in a chosen direction in 3D space known as directional drilling. Directional drillers rely on receiving accurate, quality tested {{data from the}} MWD Operator {{to allow them to}} keep the well safely on the planned trajectory.|$|R
50|$|Coiled Tubing Drilling (CTD) {{has been}} used {{effectively}} for over 20 years {{in the oil industry}} and the technology has been evolving in order to meet changing industry demands. CTD takes the well-established concept of Coiled tubing and combines it with directional drilling using a mud motor to create a system for drilling reservoirs. <b>Bottom</b> <b>hole</b> <b>assemblies</b> (BHAs) are now able to drill directional, S-curve and horizontal wells and can be the key to unlocking reserves in mature oilfields via re-entry drilling. Coiled tubing drilling is known for its speed and ability to drill reservoirs in an underbalanced condition and CTD can reduce drilling times between 30%-60% compared with conventional jointed pipe drilling rigs. Therefore, CTD can provide significant economic benefits.|$|R
40|$|The {{quest for}} energy {{is leading the}} {{industry}} into drilling deeper wells. Typically, a temperature gradient of 1 ?C/ 150 ft can be expected, with <b>bottom</b> <b>hole</b> temperatures reaching beyond 200 ?C {{in many areas of}} the world. Moreover, the increased recovery benefits and cost reductions possible with the use of horizontal and multilateral wells has triggered a need for higher power energy conversion systems in <b>bottom</b> <b>hole</b> <b>assemblies,</b> such as rotary steerable tools and downhole tractors. The concepts developed throughout this work address some of these new needs. This research investigated improvements, novel solutions and considerations that will lead to significant advantages in terms of reliability, extended temperature operation, increased power capability and reduced size and cost of compact harsh environment energy conversion systems. Improvements to both the electromechanical subsystem and the power electronic subsystem are introduced. Air gap viscous losses were shown to a have a significant effect on the optimal design of submersible PM (permanent magnet) machines, and a design procedure to account for this loss component in the design was developed. The application of a dual winding exterior rotor PM machine in a downhole environment enabled a significant increase in the application?s torque capability, provided protection against generator winding over voltage, and reduced parts count. Comprehensive switching device qualification, testing, and simulation lead to a simple failure mitigation technique for the operation of the most suitable devices at elevated temperature. A flying capacitor multilevel inverter was then successfully constructed and temperature tested. A novel motor drive concept suited for elevated temperature oil filled environment applications concluded the research...|$|R

50|$|Another {{potential}} {{area for}} error is the <b>Bottom</b> <b>Hole</b> <b>Assembly</b> (BHA). The BHA {{consists of the}} drill bit, drill collars and stabilizers. Additionally, it can also include a downhole motor, MWD (measurement while drilling) and LWD (logging while drilling) tools. Errors come about if the total BHA is not correctly measured or recorded. Often BHA changes may be made during operations and if these changes are not recorded then the depths will be incorrect.|$|E
5000|$|Logging while {{drilling}} (LWD) is {{a technique}} of conveying well logging tools into the well borehole downhole {{as part of the}} <b>bottom</b> <b>hole</b> <b>assembly</b> (BHA). LWD tools work with its measurement while drilling (MWD) system to transmit partial or complete measurement results to the surface via typically a drilling mud pulser or other improved techniques, while LWD tools are still in the borehole, which is called [...] "real-time data". Complete measurement results can be downloaded from LWD tools after they are pulled out of hole, which is called [...] "memory data".|$|E
40|$|This Final Technical Report {{summarizes}} {{the research and}} development (R&D) work performed by Stolar Research Corporation (Stolar) under U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Contract Number DE-FC 26 - 04 NT 15477. This work involved the development of radar navigation and radio data transmission systems for integration with microhole coiled tubing <b>bottom</b> <b>hole</b> <b>assemblies.</b> Under this contract, Stolar designed, fabricated, and laboratory and field tested two advanced technologies of importance to the future growth of the U. S. oil and gas industry: (1) real-time measurement-while-drilling (MWD) for guidance and navigation of coiled tubing drilling in hydrocarbon reservoirs and (2) two-way inductive radio data transmission on coiled tubing for real-time, subsurface-to-surface data transmission. The operating specifications for these technologies are compatible with 3. 5 -inch boreholes drilled to a true vertical depth (TVD) of 5, 000 feet, which is typical of coiled tubing drilling applications. These two technologies (i. e., the Stolar Data Transmission System and Drill String Radar) were developed into pre-commercial prototypes and tested successfully in simulated coiled tubing drilling conditions. Integration of these two technologies provides a real-time geosteering capability with extremely quick response times. Stolar is conducting additional work required to transition the Drill String Radar into a true commercial product. The results of this advanced development work should be an important step in the expanded commercialization of advanced coiled tubing microhole drilling equipment for use in U. S. hydrocarbon reservoirs...|$|R

40|$|Advanced Composite Products and Technology, Inc. (ACPT) has {{developed}} composite drill pipe (CDP) {{that matches the}} structural and strength properties of steel drill pipe, but weighs less than 50 percent of its steel counterpart. Funding for the multiyear {{research and development of}} CDP was provided by the U. S. Department of Energy Office of Fossil Energy through the Natural Gas and Oil Projects Management Division at the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL). Composite materials made of carbon fibers and epoxy resin offer mechanical properties comparable to steel at less than half the weight. Composite drill pipe consists of a composite material tube with standard drill pipe steel box and pin connections. Unlike metal drill pipe, composite drill pipe can be easily designed, ordered, and produced to meet specific requirements for specific applications. Because it uses standard joint connectors, CDP can be used in lieu of any part of or for the entire steel drill pipe section. For low curvature extended reach, deep directional drilling, or ultra deep onshore or offshore drilling, the increased strength to weight ratio of CDP will increase the limits in all three drilling applications. Deceased weight will reduce hauling costs and increase the amount of drill pipe allowed on offshore platforms. In extreme extended reach areas and high-angle directional drilling, drilling limits are associated with both high angle (fatigue) and frictional effects resulting from the combination of high angle curvature and/or total weight. The radius of curvature for a hole as small as 40 feet (12. 2 meters) or a build rate of 140 degrees per 100 feet is within the fatigue limits of specially designed CDP. Other properties that can be incorporated into the design and manufacture of composite drill pipe and make it attractive for specific applications are corrosion resistance, non-magnetic intervals, and abrasion resistance coatings. Since CDP has little or no electromagnetic force fields up to 74 kilohertz (KHz), a removable section of copper wire can be placed inside the composite pipe to short the tool joints electrically allowing electromagnetic signals inside the collar to induce and measure the same within the rock formation. By embedding a pair of wires in the composite section and using standard drill pipe box and pin ends equipped with a specially developed direct contact joint electrical interface, power can be supplied to measurement-while-drilling (MWD) and logging-while-drilling (LWD) <b>bottom</b> <b>hole</b> <b>assemblies.</b> Instantaneous high-speed data communications between near drill bit and the surface are obtainable utilizing this 'smart' drilling technology. The composite drill pipe developed by ACPT has been field tested successfully in several wells nationally and internationally. These tests were primarily for short radius and ultra short radius directional drilling. The CDP in most cases performed flawlessly with little or no appreciable wear. ACPT is currently marketing a complete line of composite drill collars, subs, isolators, casing, and drill pipe to meet the drilling industry's needs and tailored to replace metal for specific application requirements...|$|R
50|$|Drill pipe is {{a portion}} of the overall drill string. The drill string {{consists}} of both drill pipe and the <b>bottom</b> <b>hole</b> <b>assembly</b> (BHA), which is the tubular portion closest to the bit. The BHA will be made of thicker walled heavy weight drill pipe (HWDP) and drill collars, which have a larger outside diameter and provide weight to the drill bit and stiffness to the drilling assembly. Other BHA components can include a mud motor, measurement while drilling (MWD) apparatus, stabilizers, and various specialty downhole tools. The drill stem includes the entire drill string, plus the kelly that imparts rotation and torque to the drill pipe at the top.|$|E
