50|$|The {{resulting}} legislation, the Social Security Act 1986, {{reflected the}} policy development described above, {{subject to a}} number of changes made during the passage of the 1986 Bill. A phased introduction of the regulated Social Fund in April 1987 and the discretionary Social Fund in April 1988 followed. The latter scheme was particularly controversial at the time. The Council on Tribunals, for example, had issued a highly critical special report in 1986 which challenged the government's intention to dispense with an independent appeal mechanism. Consequently, during the passage of the Bill, the social fund review (originally envisaged as merely a management administrative review) was enhanced by the creation of 'social fund inspectors' (SFIs) who would be given jurisdiction to further review a 'social fund officer's' (SFO's) review of an SFO's original determination. In order to further entrench the independence of the SFIs, a new officer - the Social Fund Commissioner - to be appointed by the Secretary of State, was included in the legislation. There were also criticisms of the plans to provide the details of the discretionary social fund scheme in the form of 'directions' (an unusual form of delegated legislation) and 'guidance'. A draft Social Fund Manual appeared in 1987 and drew further criticism. The Social Security Advisory Committee (SSAC) took the view that the Social Fund Manual put too much emphasis on the consideration that decision-makers would have to make to the <b>budgetary</b> <b>aspects</b> which it argued went beyond the parameters of the legislation.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} PhD is to {{evaluate}} how general clinical pharmacy services can be implemented efficiently and economically to {{enhance the quality of}} therapy and patient safety, with a focus on the hospital setting within the Belgian context. In the first chapter of this doctoral thesis, we focused on the evolution of hospital pharmacy services in Belgium. First, a reflection on the traditional services offered by the hospital pharmacy was made. Traditionally, the hospital pharmacist is responsible for the management of different processes such as purchasing, distribution, compounding, follow-up of medication use and possible adverse drug events and billing. Subsequently, the origin and development of clinical pharmacy services in Belgium was specified. The Royal Decree of 04 / 03 / 1991 first pointed out the role of the hospital pharmacist as a pharmacotherapeutic care provider. In the early 2000 s pilot projects were set up, supported by the government and mainly consisting of the implementation of bedside clinical pharmacy. Besides, doctoral research focused on the implementation of specific guidelines (e. g. documentation of clinical pharmacokinetics in critically ill patients at KU Leuven) and therefore confirmed the role of the clinical pharmacist in e. g. therapeutic drug monitoring. Another essential step was the embedment of clinical pharmacy in the training program of hospital pharmacists through a 3 year interuniversity master after master program. The evolution {{of the role of the}} hospital pharmacist was supported by a digital wave in which their tasks are assisted by computerized physician order entry (CPOE) and (advanced) clinical decision support systems (aCDSS). Specific for clinical pharmacy services, these systems present advantages such as the prevention of medication errors and the check for possible drug interactions at the moment of prescribing and administration. The evolutions mentioned above all contributed to the changing role of the hospital pharmacist from box mover to provider of optimal care and exclaim the need for clinical pharmacy services. In the second chapter, we elaborated on defining the research objective of this PhD, namely to study the <b>budgetary</b> and organizational <b>aspects</b> of the implementation of clinical pharmacy services in a university hospital in the Belgian context. In the third chapter, we researched how the pharmacoeconomic impact of bedside clinical pharmacy can be measured and reported to help hospital pharmacists and decision makers with their planning for further deployment or stopping of these services. First, a literature review was conducted. It was shown that at the moment of research, studies presented many shortcomings (e. g. lack of control groups, lack of cost-effectiveness-analyses, neglecting operational costs, not checking the acceptance rate in case of cost-avoidance, …). In order to appraise the quality of pharmacoeconomic studies and to improve the design of future studies, a practical tool (a validated scorecard) was developed. This tool focused both on methodological quality and on transferability. Based on this tool, a new review of recent pharmacoeconomic studies was carried out. This review showed that the quality of pharmacoeconomic reports has improved over the years, what is very promising for future reporting on valorization and cost-effectiveness of clinical pharmacy services and interventions. This might help pharmacy directors in their struggle with policy makers to support the deployment of clinical pharmacy in times of economic constraints. Thanks to methodological correct reports it is possible to decide where to invest. The aim of the fourth chapter of this PhD is to reflect on the implementation of clinical pharmacy services in Belgium, as well as putting it into practice by means of some case studies. Our first focus in this was on clinical decision support systems, since we are convinced they have an important role in the prevention of medication errors in the early stage of prescribing and therefore have an impact on the need for further development of clinical pharmacy. A literature review concerning this matter showed that (a) CDSSs contribute to the quality of pharmacotherapeutic care (e. g. by preventing prescribing errors and by implementing guidelines for evidence based medicine). Moreover, (a) CDSSs can contribute to transparent pharmacoeconomic reporting. Subsequently, an overview of the implemented or explored bedside clinical pharmacy initiatives in Belgium was provided. It appears that most initiatives focus on patients treated with high risk drugs or high risk populations due to their underlying pathophysiology. This risk based approach is obvious knowing that human resources are rather limited, especially in Belgium. A liaison between CDSSs and bedside clinical pharmacy services appeared to be missing. A back-office check of medication appropriateness (COMA) program could provide a response to this need. COMA covers all patients, regardless of their specific underlying pathology and risk profile. By involving a computer algorithm in this process it became possible to screen all new prescriptions and active therapies in order to identify and prioritize potential hazardous situations. In this way, scarce resources can be used optimally to guarantee the same level of safety and follow-up to each patient appealing to the hospital. COMA was implemented in the University Hospitals Leuven and some preliminary results proved the benefit of this service. Moreover, the results also showed that specific clinical rules and their severity in the aCDSS should be reconsidered in order to avoid alert-fatigue. It also showed the need for bedside services on specific wards (e. g. emergency department, hemato/oncology). Additionally, some specific case studies to measure the potential pharmacotherapeutic and –economic impact of specific check of appropropriateness programs were presented. A first case report concerned acid suppressive therapy (AST), as overconsumption of this medication has been reported since this therapy became very accessible and long-term continuation of therapy started often during hospitalization. Using a validated tool it was shown that 43 % of initiation of long-term AST in the University Hospitals Leuven was inappropriate. When expanding the same screening tool to 6 other Belgian hospitals in a proof of concept study at least 28 % of AST initiation appeared to be inappropriate. Furthermore, the long-term use of AST was reexamined at the moment of discharge and then 60 % of the therapies was inappropriately continued. Clinical rules or computer supported COMA might have the opportunity to reduce this unnecessary continuation of AST. We also linked the use of AST during hospitalization to the dispensing data in the public pharmacies to study the long-term use of AST after discharge. It has been shown that inappropriate long-term continuation of AST is underestimated, partly due to the low economic impact of the therapy and the safety profile of the drug; again creating opportunities for COMA and clinical pharmacists. A second case study deals with the timely switch from intravenous to oral bio-equivalent medication. A computer algorithm aided in detecting of patients eligible for subsequent therapy by generating a worklist for the clinical pharmacist providing COMA. This study showed that informing physicians by phone or by electronic note was equally successful, yet sending electronic notes was more effective due to reduced labor costs and was appreciated over phone calls by the prescribers as it didn’t disturb the normal flow on the ward. Both case studies showed opportunities for clinical pharmacists to enhance patient safety and quality of care and to reduce drug costs, sometimes by cost-saving but also by cost-avoiding. In the discussion chapter, a reflection of the optimal organization of clinical pharmacy services in the University Hospitals Leuven is provided. To guarantee the same quality and safety to each patient, to use resources in the most optimal way and to keep clinical pharmacy affordable a 3 -layered approach is presented. These layers consist of a) CDSS for prescriber guidance at the moment of prescribing and administration, b) a back-office check of medication appropriateness based on validated computer algorithms, risk analysis and the use of clinical rules, c) bedside clinical pharmacy for high risk populations or high risk therapies (e. g. intensive care, geriatrics, pediatrics, emergency department, …). A dynamic interaction between the 3 layers, driven by the hospital pharmacist, guarantees continuously tweaking of the system in order to provide maximal effective care. Since clinical pharmacy services are still evolving, more research will be conducted in the following years in a sequel PhD focusing on advanced COMA in order to support the further deployment of clinical pharmacy services via the presented three layered approach. status: accepte...|$|R

40|$|With the {{invention}} of computers, Architecture and other Engineering disciplines have undergone revolutionary developments offering new opportunities for improving efficiency and opening new frontiers for creativity. For example in architecture and urban planning, the discussions have been extended from conventional writings to cover cyberspace, virtual architecture and digital city. Moreover, computers have helped in the realization of many complex projects that would be inconceivable with traditional drawing techniques. This is clearly demonstrated {{in the works of}} Frank Gehry's, Zaha Hadid, Daniel Libeskind and many others. In deed, digital techniques have changed the design creative process and how the architects think. Traditionally the structured development architectural ideas from 2 D drawings (plans, sections, elevations) towards 3 D resolution has been replaced by more interactive approach of 2 D & 3 D. The changes that digital techniques have brought to the field of Architecture, including practice and education, can obviously be viewed from different angles and incite many discussions and questions. However, the purpose of this presentation is to discuss the role of digital techniques within the overall framework of project management in Gulf Housing Engineering. It starts the discussion with a brief on architecture and digital techniques in the Gulf Region, especially during the “boom period”, a period characterized by rapid production of buildings relying heavily on virtual images.

O caso empírico consistiu num questionário dirigido aos Presidentes das Juntas de Freguesia da nossa população (27 autarquias, 17 das quais do Concelho da Maia e 10 do Concelho de Matosinhos), com uma taxa de resposta de 85, 2 %. Face às hipóteses formuladas, pode-se concluir que a existência do SCI e a dimensão da autarquia estão relacionadas. Em sentido oposto, nenhuma das outras hipóteses se confirmou, ou seja, não existe relação entre a importância atribuída ao SCI e o nível académico do Presidente da Junta de Freguesia, entre o bom funcionamento do SCI e a importância atribuída ao SCI, nem entre a existência do Órgão/Serviço de Auditoria Interna e a dimensão da autarquia. Os resultados obtidos permitem concluir que a maioria das autarquias tem um Regulamento de Controlo Interno implementado, ao qual atribui uma grande importância, e cujo funcionamento acreditam ser adequado. O estudo mostra, também, que no entendimento dos Presidentes das Juntas de Freguesia, {{a principal}} vantagem de um SCI bem implementado resulta da conformidade com leis e regulamentos, e a principal dificuldade para o seu bom funcionamento prende-se com o reduzido número de meios humanos. Contudo, a presença de Auditoria Interna nestas autarquias é, ainda, muito reduzida, apesar destes autarcas apontarem como principal vantagem da existência deste serviço, o apoio às mesmas para a optimização dos seus recursos. Estas conclusões evidenciam a necessidade de uma maior atenção sobre o SCI, e duma aposta concreta na implementação da auditoria interna nestas autarquias, como forma de apoio à sua gestão. The State Financial Administration Reform revealed {{a growing concern}} about control and surveillance, initially on <b>budgetary</b> <b>aspects,</b> and presently in a global dimension. As a result, the ICS (Internal Control System) appeared, present in every Public Administration organisms, {{in order to become}} a privileged instrument to support their management, allowing an increase in the effectiveness and efficiency of operations, a higher financial information reliability, as well as the compliance with the applicable legal acts. It initiated by a literature review on the auditing progress, contextualizing the internal control as an internal auditing analysis point. Thereafter, presented the Public Sector until reaching the Parish Councils, converging the approached concepts from these autarchies perspectives. The empirical case consisted on a questionnaire, drawn up and addressed to the Parish Councils Presidents of our population (27 autarchies, 17 from Maia Municipality and 10 from Matosinhos Municipality), with a 85, 2 % response rate. Regarding the formulated hypotheses we are allowed to conclude that ICS existence and the autarky dimension are related. On the other hand, all the other hypotheses weren’t confirmed, in other words, it wasn’t confirmed a relationship existence between the ICS importance given and the Parish Council President academic level, between the ICS smooth functioning and the ICS implementation, and also, between the Internal Auditing Board/Service existence and the autarky dimension. The results allowed concluding that most of the autarchies have an Internal Control Regulation implemented, which attaches considerable importance, and believe they have it functioning properly. This study also shows that, according to the understanding of Parish Councils Presidents, the main advantage of a well implemented ICS is its compliance with laws and regulations, and the main difficulty for their proper functioning is related to the reduced number of human resources. However, the Internal Auditing presence in these autarchies despite being greatly reduced, still the majors aspects pointed out as main advantages of this service existence, support the decision to optimize its resources. These conclusions show the need to a higher ICS attention, and a concrete investment and strong belief towards an Internal Auditing implementation in these autarchies, as a way to support the autarchic management.

40|$|Esta tese tem como objetivo o estudo da infraestrutura sob uma perspectiva de direito público, abordando diversos mecanismos que podem ser utilizados para o seu desenvolvimento, em especial para o Brasil. O esforço é trazer uma contribuição {{original}} no sentido de analisar o tema sob a ótica da ação do Estado, diferentemente de outras abordagens existentes sob a ótica da indústria que atua nos diversos setores de infraestrutura. Inicialmente, faz-se imperioso analisar o conceito de infraestrutura, sua origem com o contexto militar e sua inter-relação com o desenvolvimento econômico e social. Tendo em vista a multiplicidade de abordagens, busca-se um conceito ad hoc e taxonômico a fim de definir o que vem a ser infraestrutura pública preocupação não externada, por exemplo, na legislação pátria. A infraestrutura é vista, nesse sentido, como determinante ao desenvolvimento econômico e social. Sedimentadas essas bases, verificasse o caráter instrumental da infraestrutura e sua função estratégica, tanto na seara econômica como social. A despeito de sua importância, não é despiciendo recordar que a infraestrutura representa um custo considerável ao Estado; daí a razão para se debruçar sobre as formas de seu financiamento. Traçadas essas premissas, parte-se para a análise do planejamento governamental orçamentário na infraestrutura pública, constatando a importância, hodiernamente, do planejamento de médio e longo prazo nesse processo, especialmente com o Plano Plurianual brasileiro. Nessa dinâmica orçamentária, diversos fatores contribuem para a redução de investimentos no setor e outras propostas visam a ampliar a quantidade de recursos públicos a esses projetos: em razão disso, o estudo é concluído com um capítulo acerca dos instrumentos para o desenvolvimento da infraestrutura pública. Verifica-se a questão do problema da falta de espaço fiscal e o uso de alguns instrumentos orçamentários para mitigá-lo, como o crédito público, a vinculação de receitas e a despesa mínima obrigatória para infraestrutura pública. Por derradeiro, a investigação dá-se com relação aos investimentos públicos internacionais em infraestrutura, em especial os da República Popular da China em outros países. This thesis has as {{purpose to}} study public infrastructure under a public law perspective: it examines many mechanisms {{which can be}} used for its development, mainly in the Brazilian context. The efforts here are the development of an unprecedented contribution in order to discuss the subject based on a vision of the government, unlike existing approaches from the industry perspective. With an origin from the military practice, the concept of infrastructure is intimately interrelated with economic and social development. Considering the multiplicity of approaches about the subject, I intend to organize an ad hoc and taxonomic concept to define what public infrastructure is, what is not provided for Brazilian legislation. Infrastructure is conceived as a decisive factor to economic and social development. Once having defined and contextualized the concept of infrastructure development, its role in both social and economic development is posited. Despite the importance of infrastructure development, it represents significant costs to countries investing in it. This is the reason why it is important to study how the Brazilian government invests in this sector. Using the aforementioned definitions, this work investigates governmental budgetary planning infrastructure with an emphasis on mid- and long-term planning processes, particularly within the Brazilian Multi-Year Plan. It is also indispensable the assessment of the main <b>budgetary</b> <b>aspects</b> related to public spending on infrastructure: in this budgetary dynamics, some issues contribute to the reduction of investments in the sector. Given budgetary limitations, the study concludes with a chapter on alternatives to current infrastructure development policies in Brazil. The lack of fiscal space is crucial to understanding the problem, along with the attempt to reduce this effect by using some budgetary mechanisms, such as public debt, earmarking and minimum mandatory spending on public infrastructure. Finally, the investigation is connected to international public investments in infrastructure, especially by the Peoples Republic of China in other countries...|$|E
