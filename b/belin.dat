25|$|The Partizan youth school, called Youth School <b>Belin</b> – Lazarević – Nadoveza, {{was founded}} in the 1950s and named after former Partizan players Bruno <b>Belin,</b> Čedomir Lazarević and Branko Nadoveza. The club {{is well known for}} its {{dedicated}} work with youngsters. Its training philosophy is not only the development of football players, but also to care of their growth and personality forming, while also teaching the sporting spirit. There are around 400 youngsters classified by age categories. There are six age groups, four compete {{at the level of the}} Football Association of Serbia, the U17, U16, U15 and U14, while the U13 and U12 compete at the level of the Football Association of Belgrade. Below U12 level there are no official competitions, but players do play in tournaments and friendly matches.|$|E

25|$|After {{years of}} feuding between the Ontario Soccer Association and the CNSL both parties decided to {{reconcile}} their differences in 1998 by forming the Canadian Professional Soccer League. The project {{was an attempt}} to form an exclusively Canadian national soccer league across the country beginning with an Ontario Division. Toronto Croatia became a founding member along with Glen Shields, London City, Mississauga Eagles, North York Astros, St. Catharines Wolves, Toronto Olympians, and York Region Shooters. In preparation for their CPSL debut the club brought in former Dinamo Zagreb manager Rudolf <b>Belin.</b> Toronto was forced to restructure their squad by signing new additions due to the retirement of several key players. They made their CPSL debut on June 3, 1998 in a Canada Cup match against Glen Shields, where they were defeated by a score of 3-1 with Stephen Warren providing the lone goal. Sadly their inaugural CPSL season was a setback as they finished {{at the bottom of the}} standings, and failed to show any prominence in the Canada Cup tournament by failing to advance past their group stage.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the battle of Guise, von Kluck’s German First Army broke off its attacks on Maunoury’s Sixth French Army and swung southeast, inside of Paris. However, Lanrezac’s victory had left him in an exposed forward position, and he had a {{telephone}} conversation with General <b>Belin</b> at GQG, warning him that he had been directly ordered to hold his position and attack if possible, and that his army was in danger of being cut off and encircled. Permission to retreat finally reached him at 7am the next morning. Although Terraine sees Guise as a French tactical victory, Herwig is critical of Lanrezac for holding back Franchet d’Esperey’s I Corps for much of the day, and for failing to exploit the gap between German Second and Third Armies. However, he is more critical of von Bülow (commander of German Second Army and effectively Army Group commander over von Kluck’s First Army in the west and Hausen’s Third Army to his east) for failing, for the second time, to encircle and destroy Lanrezac’s Army.|$|E
25|$|In late August, 1946, the new Yugoslav league {{started and}} Partizan played its first {{official}} match, beating Pobeda Skoplje 1–0. Since the club {{had the highest}} ambitions from the very beginning, it attracted {{some of the best}} players from all over the country: Stjepan Bobek, Miroslav Brozović, Zlatko Čajkovski, Kiril Simonovski, Bela Palfi, Franjo Rupnik, Prvoslav Mihajlović, Aleksandar Atanacković, Miodrag Jovanović, Vladimir Firm, Ratko Čolić and Franjo Šoštarić. Prominent football expert Illés Spitz became the manager, and spent next 14 years at various positions in the club. His implementation of top European training methods and playing tactics, combined with technically gifted squad, proved essential in winning the first championship in debut season, along with the first cup title, thus the first Double winner in the country. The second championship title was won in 1948–49 season. Partizan played its home games on the old BSK stadium until 1949, when its own stadium was built on the same site and named JNA Stadium (Stadium of Yugoslav People's Army). In 1950, the club evolved from a football section of the Army into independent club under the umbrella organization JSD Partizan (Yugoslav Sports Association Partizan). The first clubs president became Ratko Vujović. In 1953, the remaining formal connections between the club and the Army ceased. Although during the 1950s Partizan had a very strong squad, led by national team players like Bobek, Čajkovski, Miloš Milutinović, Marko Valok, Bruno <b>Belin,</b> Tomislav Kaloperović and Branko Zebec, the club had a long break without winning a championship, only winning cup titles in 1952, 1954 and 1957. Despite the absence of domestic titles, Partizan's great performances on high quality tournaments throughout Europe gained them significant continental reputation. On 4 September 1955, Partizan participated in the first ever Champions Cup match, in Lisbon against Sporting CP. The final result was 3–3, with Miloš Milutinović becoming the first scorer in a most prestigious club competition in Europe.|$|E

500|$|French set-backs in 1915 forced Joffre to reorganise GQG—on 11 December he {{replaced}} <b>Belin</b> with General Noël de Castelnau—and expand its remit. [...] Three entirely new bureaus were formed, {{that of the}} North Army (...) , the North-East Army (...) and for external theatres of war bringing GQG direct control of French armies in the field. [...] Two major-générals were appointed, General Maurice Janin for the two army bureaus and General Maurice Pellé for the Bureau for External Theatres of War. [...] The Second Bureau was also reformed with its censorship, counter-espionage and intelligence gathering duties being passed to a new Fifth Bureau; though the Second Bureau retained some of its former intelligence responsibilities.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{activation}} the [...] of [...] was General Emile <b>Belin</b> {{and the two}} aides-majors were General Henri Berthelot and General Céleste Deprez. Each aide-major had {{responsibility for}} two of the bureaus; Berthelot oversaw the Second and Third Bureaus, Deprez oversaw the First and Fourth Bureaus. Each bureau was under the day-to-day control of a lower ranking officer, upon activation the Third Bureau was headed by Colonel Ferdinand Auguste Pont, the Fourth Bureau by General Étienne Édouard Laffon de Ladébat and the president's liaison officer was General Pénélon. The other officers were generally selected by Joffre from those who had excelled at the Ecole Supérieure de Guerre (French Army staff college). Representatives from the allied powers were also present within the GQG structure and at various times included officers from the United Kingdom, Russia, USA, Japan, Italy, Belgium, Serbia and Romania.|$|E
500|$|GQG {{played a}} key role {{at the start of the}} war. [...] Due to illness <b>Belin</b> had {{delegated}} much of his role to Berthelot, further increasing the power of his influential Third Bureau. [...] The officers in that department, particularly the recent staff college graduates who were known as the Young Turks, favoured strong offensive action. [...] Having failed to initially perceive the German advance through Belgium, it was these officers who were key in persuading Joffre to attack the exposed German right flank during the Great Retreat from Mons. [...] As a result of the German advances in late 1914 GQG was forced to relocate its headquarters progressively westwards. [...] It moved to Bar-sur-Aube on 31 August, Châtillon-sur-Seine on 6 September, Romilly-sur-Seine on 28 September 1914 and, on 29 November, to Chantilly, within the Paris metropolitan area, where it was to remain for the next few years. [...] This location was suited to GQG operations due to its proximity to the seat of government and the ministries in Paris.|$|E
500|$|Harry Connick Sr., the New Orleans {{district}} attorney who defeated Garrison in 1973, criticized Stone's {{view of the}} assassination: [...] "Stone was either unaware of the details and particulars of the Clay Shaw investigation and trial or, if he was aware, that didn't get in his way of what he {{perceived to be the}} way the case should have been." [...] In his book , a history of the assassination published 16 years after the film's release, Vincent Bugliosi devoted an entire chapter to Garrison's prosecution of Shaw and Stone's subsequent film. Bugliosi lists thirty-two separate [...] "lies and fabrications" [...] in Stone's film and describes the film as [...] "one continuous lie in which Stone couldn't find any level of deception and invention beyond which he was unwilling to go." [...] David Wrone stated that [...] "80 percent of the film is in factual error" [...] and rejected the premise of a conspiracy involving the CIA and the so-called military-industrial complex as [...] "irrational." [...] Warren Commission investigator David <b>Belin</b> called the film [...] "a big lie that would make Adolf Hitler proud".|$|E
