5|$|Also {{beginning}} in 2012, sighted guides became eligible to receive medals in certain events; sighted goalkeepers in 5-a-side football, along with guides and pilots in athletics and cycling and boccia assistants were {{now able to}} receive medals for their contributions. Previously {{in the case of}} tandem cycling, where a visually-impaired rider takes the rear of the <b>bike</b> <b>with</b> a sighted pilot in front, only the visually-impaired rider actually received a medal.|$|E
5|$|These designs, {{such as the}} Python Lowracer, a recumbent, {{usually have}} very lax head angles (40° to 65°) and {{positive}} or even negative trail. The builder of a <b>bike</b> <b>with</b> negative trail states that steering the bike from straight ahead forces the seat (and thus the rider) to rise slightly and this offsets the destabilizing effect of the negative trail.|$|E
5|$|Browne {{learned to}} ride a bicycle {{at the age of}} four, but did not enter his first formal cycling {{competition}} until the age of 16, when he joined the Hawthorne Amateur Cycling Club. Browne made a habit of riding to training with his ordinary <b>bike</b> <b>with</b> heavy wheels to the club, carrying the lighter racing tyres on his back and changing his tyres upon his arrival. He earned extra money to fund a bicycle upgrade by working as a newspaper boy. There was little formal coaching at the club, and the cyclists learned by individual application and by watching and copying others. Browne and his club-mates raced on Saturdays and trained on Sundays.|$|E
500|$|The {{rear brake}} of an upright bicycle can only produce about 0.25g (~2.5m/s2) {{deceleration}} at best, {{because of the}} decrease in normal force at the rear wheel as described above. All such <b>bikes</b> <b>with</b> only rear braking are subject to this limitation: for example, <b>bikes</b> <b>with</b> only a coaster brake, and fixed-gear <b>bikes</b> <b>with</b> no other braking mechanism. There are, however, situations that may warrant rear wheel braking ...|$|R

50|$|In 2001, {{the firm}} moved from its 800-sq.-foot space to a larger, modernized plant. Over {{the next five}} years it built dual-suspension <b>bikes</b> <b>with</b> needle bearings, Cx road <b>bikes</b> <b>with</b> carbon {{monocoque}} frames, and introduced its Cyclocross product line. In 2004, the firm's Ollie model won 26 Magazine’s “Freeride Bike of the Year” award.|$|R
5|$|Some top riders receive special frames to {{give more}} {{stability}} and comfort. Different materials make the ride more comfortable. Tom Boonen, using a Time frame with longer wheelbase for the first time, won the race in 2005 and has since continued to use a <b>bike</b> <b>with</b> a longer wheelbase. George Hincapie had a frame featuring a 2mm elastomer insert {{at the top of}} the seat stays. The manufacturers claimed this took nearly all the shock out of the cobbles. Hincapie's Trek bicycle fared less well in 2006: his aluminum steerer tube snapped with 46km to go, the crash injuring his shoulder.|$|E
5|$|Officials {{proposed}} dockless bike sharing for the Citi Bike network, {{which would}} allow bikes to be rented without being tethered to docks. This was proposed after several bike sharing companies announced their intent to operate in New York City. In early August, the dockless bike-sharing company Spin had started a dockless operation in the Rockaways, but {{had been told to}} cease and desist operations by the NYCDOT, which had licensed Citi Bike as the only official bike-share operator in New York City. By the end of the month, Citi Bike started designing a dockless prototype that could still lock its own wheels based on whether the customer had paid. Meanwhile, Spin—a viable competitor to Citi <b>Bike</b> <b>with</b> lower per-half-hour pricing—was still looking to get a permit to start operations in New York City.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} The Pee-wee Herman Show {{prompted}} Warner Bros. to hire Reubens {{to write a}} script for a full-length Pee-wee Herman film. Reubens' original idea was to do a remake of Pollyanna, which Reubens claims is his favorite film. Halfway through writing the script, Reubens noticed everyone at Warner Bros. had a <b>bike</b> <b>with</b> them, which inspired Reubens to start on a new script with Phil Hartman. When Reubens and the producers of Pee-wee's Big Adventure saw Tim Burton's work on Vincent and Frankenweenie, they chose Burton to be the film's director. The film {{tells the story of}} Pee-wee Herman embarking on nationwide adventure in search of his stolen bicycle. The movie went on to gross $40,940,662 domestically, recouping almost six times its $7 million budget. At the time of release in 1985, the film received mixed reviews, but Pee-wee's Big Adventure developed into a cult film.|$|E

5|$|A bike is also {{an example}} of an {{inverted}} pendulum. Just as a broomstick is more easily balanced in the hand than a pencil, a tall <b>bike</b> (<b>with</b> a high center of mass) can be easier to balance when ridden than a low one because the tall bike's lean rate (rate at which its angle of lean increases as it begins to fall over) will be slower. However, a rider can have the opposite impression of a bike when it is stationary. A top-heavy bike can require more effort to keep upright, when stopped in traffic for example, than a bike which is just as tall but with a lower center of mass. This {{is an example of a}} vertical second-class lever. A small force at the end of the lever, the seat or handlebars at the top of the bike, more easily moves a large mass if the mass is closer to the fulcrum, where the tires touch the ground. This is why touring cyclists are advised to carry loads low on a bike, and panniers hang down on either side of front and rear racks.|$|E
5|$|The series {{then moved}} on to Britain, where Roberts would be {{involved}} in one of the closest races in Grand Prix history. Roberts' battle with Sheene at the 1979 British Grand Prix at Silverstone has been cited {{as one of the greatest}} races of the 1970s. Minutes before the start of the race, Roberts' Yamaha blew a seal and sprayed the <b>bike</b> <b>with</b> oil. His crew managed to replace the seal in time, but Roberts went to the starting line with his gloves coated with oil, causing his hand to slip on the throttle during the race. The race began with Roberts, Sheene and Dutch rider Wil Hartog breaking away from the rest of the field of riders. Hartog eventually fell behind as Roberts and Sheene continued to battle for the lead. The event featured numerous lead changes throughout the 28 lap race, with Roberts winning ahead of Sheene by a narrow margin of just three-tenths of a second. A third-place finish in the season-ending French Grand Prix, along with a crash by his main championship rival Ferrari, secured his second consecutive world championship.|$|E

2500|$|Pit {{bikes are}} powered by 4-stroke, horizontal, single-cylinder engines ranging {{anywhere}} in displacement from 49cc [...] to 195cc. A typical pit bike {{is usually a}} small dirt bike, but it has become common {{to be able to}} buy pit <b>bikes</b> <b>with</b> street-style wheels and tires.

25|$|On any <b>bike</b> <b>with</b> only {{rear wheel}} braking, the maximum {{deceleration}} is {{significantly lower than}} on a bike equipped with a front brake. As a vehicle brakes, weight can be transferred towards the front wheel {{and away from the}} rear, decreasing the amount of grip the rear wheel has. Transferring the rider's weight back increases rear wheel braking efficiency, but a front wheel fitted with an ordinary brake might provide 70% or more of the braking power when braking hard.|$|E

In 1997, he won the Ayrton Senna Memorial Cup, and also became the youngest driver ever to win the European Super A Championship.|$|E
25|$|The 1986 film Quicksilver {{featuring}} a bicycle messenger, {{is an early}} expression of the mythology of the messenger as daredevil stunt rider. Star Kevin Bacon rides a racing bike, a fixed gear bike and a trick <b>bike</b> <b>with</b> 1:1 gear ratio and zero-rake forks, to perform the stunts in the film. The 2000–2002 television series Dark Angel had the main character Max Guevara, played by Jessica Alba, as a bicycle messenger at a courier service named Jam Pony.

25|$|Superb {{performances}} {{in both the}} individual time trials (second on stage 13 to La Caverne du Pont-d'Arc and winner of stage 18 to Megève) allowed Froome to gain even more time on his rivals, and despite a crash on stage 19 to Saint-Gervais-les-Bains where he finished the stage on Thomas' <b>bike</b> <b>with</b> support from Wout Poels, it was {{enough for him to}} win the race overall 4:05 ahead of second-placed Romain Bardet, becoming the first British rider to win the Tour on three occasions, the fourth rider to become a 3-time winner (joining Philippe Thys, Louison Bobet and Greg LeMond), and the first since Miguel Indurain in 1995 to successfully defend his title. It was also the first time the team finished a Grand Tour with all nine riders intact.|$|E
25|$|In the women's race, Helen Jenkins powered {{away from}} the rest of the field on the run to win. With the win, Jenkins won her first World Championship series event since the format began in 2009 and booked her place on Britain's Olympic team. Despite {{suffering}} a cold, Jenkins finished ahead of first-time medalists Gwen Jorgensen and Anja Dittmer. A group of 34 formed on the <b>bike</b> <b>with</b> Diaz and Sweetland eventually bridging the gap leaving a group of 50 triathletes to go into the run section together. Jenkins surged ahead in the run to win as Jorgensen set the fastest run split to qualify for the USA and claim the silver medal. Dittmer came home for bronze after out-sprinting a group containing Snowsill, Groff and Hewitt. Hewitt and Groff qualified for London whilst the Australians failed to meet their nation's criteria.
