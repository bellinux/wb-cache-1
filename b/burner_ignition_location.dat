40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} gasdynamic {{model with}} constant burning velocity is {{applied for the}} prediction of the maximum pressure rise from gaseous combustion in vented enclosures with variable aspect ratios and <b>ignition</b> <b>locations.</b> A series of calculations for vented enclosures with aspect ratio varied between 0. 5 and 8 are presented {{as well as a}} series of calculations for three different <b>ignition</b> <b>locations.</b> In addition to the aspect ratio and <b>ignition</b> <b>location,</b> the flame speed and the vent size were also parameters of the study. A solution for the evaluation of the flame surface area from the model output is developed. This solution is used for the determination of a quantity known as the “vent parameter”, which is widely used in analytical models for prediction of the maximum reduced explosion pressure. Results of calculations are compared with an ideal analytical solution for spherical vessels, with results from a previous study using the same 3 D gasdynamic model and with the NFPA 68 guidelines for vent sizing.

40|$|An {{explosion}} of flammable mixtures in interconnected compartments is commonly defined as pressure piling. Piling pressure is phenomenon when the peak pressure observed {{is higher than}} the predictable thermodynamic values. The two main mechanisms affecting pressure piling are pre-compression and violence of explosion. Therefore, this paper is aim study on the effect of <b>ignition</b> <b>location</b> on pressure piling using Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) simulation. Different points of ignition were studied using this simulation which are central and end point in the interconnected vessel (primary vessel). Besides that the role played by pre-compression and violence of explosion were also studied. In this studied, CFD codes were used as this simulation able to reproduce the explosion phenomenon (propane air) strongly depends on the sub-models used for turbulence and combustion. The proportion of the propane air used was 50 - 50. The model of the interconnected vessel were construct in the Gambit with the height and width of the primary vessel are 0. 75 cm and 0. 305. Meanwhile the height and width of the secondary vessel are 0. 15 cm and 0. 26 cm. Later on, the model was imported to the Fluent to reproduce the explosion. From my research, the peak pressure for <b>ignition</b> <b>location</b> at the end in the primary vessel gives the highest value than the peak pressure of central <b>ignition</b> <b>location.</b> This is due to the end ignition location; the flame has much more time to develop turbulence before it enters the secondary vessel. This method is the best to study about an explosion in interconnected vessel because of low cost involve rather than sacrifice a plant which is something irrational to be done.

40|$|Abstract: The {{spark plug}} {{has been used}} as the {{ignition}} source of the spark ignited internal combustion (IC) engine for many decades. It is limited in that once the plug has been built and installed, the <b>ignition</b> <b>location</b> within the cylinder cannot be subsequently changed. Multiple spark ignition of the engine for improved combustion control is possible with a spark plug, but this technology has significant limitations. The large dwell time of the spark plug makes firing multiple ignitions at different but close crank angles during a cycle impractical. Furthermore, to achieve multiple <b>ignition</b> <b>locations</b> with a spark plug requires multiple spark plugs to be installed on each cylinder, which creates severe constraints on the cylinder and valve geometry. The use of a laser as an ignition source however can in principle allow adaptive focusing to allow the on-line change of <b>ignition</b> <b>location</b> {{under the control of the}} Engine Control Unit (ECU) and so effectively remove many of the restrictions of a spark plug based systems.

40|$|The {{ignition}} {{characteristics of}} a non-premixed multiple-burner linear combustion chamber was investigated experimentally and numerically, focusing on {{the determination of the}} mechanisms driving flame propagation from burner to burner. For different inter-burner spacings, overall equivalence ratios and bulk velocities, measurements of the velocity field and the mixture fraction distribution have been performed, respectively, with laser doppler anemometry and planar laser-induced fluorescence of acetone in the un-ignited flow. It was shown that in every individual burner, gas mixes with air within a central recirculation zone (CRZ) where the mixture is flammable except in the axial central rich gas jet and the annular air jet. Flammable mixture from the CRZ is extracted by the annular jet and this results in the existence of bridges of positive flammability factor in the inter-burner region. These bridges allow flame fragments to travel from the CRZ of the ignited burner to the CRZ of the adjacent unignited one, leading to burner-to-burner flame propagation. The ignition probability that sparking within a <b>burner</b> results in <b>ignition</b> of the adjacent one was obtained by performing many separate ignition trials with a laser spark. Ignition probability contours were also computed using a previously developed stochastic low-order ignition model and a large eddy simulation (LES) time-averaged solution of the cold flow.

The study focusses on {{the mechanism of}} lightround, namely the burner-to-burner flame propagation. Side visualization of the spreading flame by 5 kHz OH* chemiluminescence showed that propagation from burner to burner did not follow a purely azimuthal direction, but a sawtooth pattern with downstream and sideways motion from one burner to the following, bringing flame to the downstream part of the recirculation zone of the adjacent burner before being convected upstream leading to full <b>burner</b> <b>ignition.</b> This pattern was more pronounced when the burners where fitted with swirlers. Top visualization and image processing were used to quantify the speed of lightround {{as a function of}} inter-burner spacing, bulk velocity, equivalence ratio, and swirling feature.

40|$|A quarter-scale {{engineering}} {{model of the}} center wing tank (CWT) of a 747 - 100 was constructed. This {{engineering model}} replicated the compartmentalization, passageways, and venting to the atmosphere. The model was designed to scale the fluid dynamical and combustion aspects of the explosion, not the structural failure of the beams or spars. The effect of structural failure on combustion was examined by using model beams and spars with deliberately engineered weak connections to the main tank structure. The model {{was filled with a}} simulant fuel (a mixture of propane and hydrogen) and ignited with a hot wire. The simulant fuel was chosen on the basis of laboratory testing to model the combustion characteristics (pressure rise and flame speed) of Jet A vapor created by a Jet A liquid layer at 50 C at an altitude of 13. 8 kft. A series of experiments was carried out in this model in order to: (a) investigate combustion in a CWT geometry; and (b) provide guidance to the TWA 800 crash investigation. The results of the experiments were observed with high-speed film, video, and still cameras, fast and slow pressure sensors, thermocouples, photodetectors, and motion sensors. A special pseudo-schlieren system was used to visualize flame propagation within the tank. This report describes the test program, facility, instrumentation, the first 30 experiments, comparisons between experiments, and performance of the instrumentation; then examines the significance of these results to the TWA 800 crash investigation. The key results of this study are: Flame Motion: The motion of flame was dominated by the effects of turbulence created by jetting through the passageways and vent stringers. A very rapid combustion event (lasting 10 to 20 ms) occurred once the flame traveled outside of the ignition bay and interacted with the turbulent flow. Most of the gas within the tank was burned during this rapid event. Compartments: The combustion time decreased with an increasing number of compartments (bays) within the tank. With six bays, combustion took only 100 to 150 ms to be completed from the time of ignition {{until the end of the}} rapid combustion phase. The total combustion event was three to four times shorter with compartments than without. Venting: Venting to the outside of the tank through the model vent stringers had a negligible effect on the combustion progress or on the peak pressure reached at the end of the burn. Ignition Location: Variation of the <b>ignition</b> <b>location</b> produced distinctive pressure loads on the structural components. Liquid Fuel: Lofting of a cold liquid fuel layer was produced by the combustion-induced gas motion. Although this spray of liquid eventually ignited and burned, it did not contribute to the pressure loading. Structural Failure: Structural failure resulted in flame acceleration, decreasing the overall combustion time. TWA 800 Investigation: The pressure loads were sufficiently high, up to 4 bar, and the combustion events were sufficiently short, that the forward portion (spanwise beam 3, front spar) of the CWT structure would fail as a direct consequence of the explosion. A combination of pressure loads was produced in some tests consistent with the TWA 800 wreckage. Replica tests, structural modeling, and sensitivity studies on fuel concentration are needed before any conclusions can be drawn about probable <b>ignition</b> <b>locations.</b> Cargo Bay: Tests with a simplified model of a half-full cargo bay indicated that repeated pressure waves with an amplitude of 1 bar or less are produced when an explosion scenario similar to TWA 800 is tested. Future Testing: Future studies should include replica tests, tests with Jet A vapor and warm liquid Jet A layers, and sensitivity tests to examine <b>ignition</b> <b>location,</b> fuel concentration, and vent area perturbations. Summary: Explosion tests in a 747 - 100 CWT model reveal that a very complex pattern of combustion occurs due the interaction of the flame and the flow-generated turbulence. A wide range of structural load patterns occur, depending on the <b>location</b> of the <b>ignition</b> source. Some of these load patterns are consistent with damage believed to be associated with the initial explosion event in TWA 800. Sensitivity of the loading to the <b>ignition</b> <b>location</b> indicates that narrowing down the <b>ignition</b> <b>location</b> in TWA 800 may be possible. However, the complexity of the combustion and structural failure processes in the actual center wing tank mandates extremely careful consideration of the uncertainties that enter into this process...|$|R

Preheated fuel-air mixtures with equivalence ratios of 0. 31 and 0. 37 and uniform velocities of 1 and 2 m/s were examined, resulting in incoming Reynolds numbers ranging from 190 to 380.

The numerical predictions included a two-dimensional elliptic model with detailed heterogeneous and homogeneous chemical reactions.

Measured ADD values typically increase with higher sprinkler flow rates, although some sprinkler designs and <b>ignition</b> <b>locations</b> show diminishing returns...|$|R
