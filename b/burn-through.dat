Ceramic oxide coatings {{could be used}} to increase Ir-Re rocket lifetimes and allow operation in highly oxidizing environments. Ceramic oxide coatings promise to serve as both thermal and diffusion barriers for the iridium layer. Seven ceramic oxide-coated Ir-Re, 22 -N rocket chambers were tested with gaseous hydrogen/gaseous oxygen (GHz/G 02) propellants. Five chambers had thick (over 10 mils), monolithic coatings of either hafnia (HfO 2) or zirconia (ZrO 2). Two chambers had coatings with thicknesses less than 5 mils. One of these chambers had a thin-walled coating of ZrO 2 infiltrated with sol gel HfO 2. The other chamber had a coating composed of an Ir-oxide composite. The purpose of this test program was to assess the ability of the oxide coatings to withstand the thermal shock of combustion initiation, adhere under repeated thermal cycling, and operate in aggressively oxidizing environments. All of the coatings survived the thermal shock of combustion and demonstrated operation at mixture ratios up to 11. Testing the Ir-oxide composite-coated chamber included over 29 min at mixture ratio 16. The thicker walled coatings provided the larger temperature drops across the oxide layer (up to 570 C), but were susceptible to macrocracking and eventual chipping at a stress concentrator. The cracks apparently resealed during firing, under compression of the oxide layer. The thinner walled coatings did not experience the macrocracking and chipping of the chambers that was seen with the thick, monolithic coatings. However, <b>burn-throughs</b> in the throat region did occur in both of the thin-walled chambers at mixture ratios well above stoichiometric. The <b>burn-throughs</b> were probably the result of oxygen diffusion through the oxide coating that allowed the underlying Ir and Re layers to be oxidized.

Problems with <b>burn-through</b> during testing prompted a switch from gasoline to less energetic alcohol.

5000|$|One report {{describes}} the crew as [...] "infuriated" [...] that Mission Control seemed unconcerned.

Upon landing, the magnitude of the damage to the shuttle astonished NASA; over 700 damaged tiles were noted, and one tile was missing altogether. The tile was located over the steel mounting plate for the L-band antenna, perhaps preventing a <b>burn-through</b> of the sort that would ultimately doom Columbia in 2003. There was almost no damage present on the orbiter's left side. To date, STS-27 Atlantis is the most damaged launch-entry vehicle to return to Earth successfully.|$|E

The two SRBs, which could withstand greater aerodynamic loads, separated from the ET and continued in uncontrolled powered flight for another 37 seconds.

50|$|Information {{designer}} Edward Tufte {{has claimed}} that the Challenger accident {{is an example of}} the problems that can occur from the lack of clarity in the presentation of information. He argues that if Morton Thiokol engineers had more clearly presented the data that they had on the relationship between low temperatures and <b>burn-through</b> in the solid rocket booster joints, they might have succeeded in persuading NASA managers to cancel the launch. To demonstrate this, he took all of the data he claimed the engineers had presented during the briefing, and reformatted it onto a single graph of O-ring damage versus external launch temperature, showing the effects of cold on the degree of O-ring damage. Tufte then placed the proposed launch of Challenger on the graph according to its predicted temperature at launch. According to Tufte, the launch temperature of Challenger was so far below the coldest launch, with the worst damage seen to date, that even a casual observer could have determined that the risk of disaster was severe.|$|E

5000|$|The NK-33 series {{engines are}} high-pressure, regeneratively cooled staged {{combustion}} cycle bipropellant rocket engines, and use oxygen-rich preburners {{to drive the}} turbopumps. The turbopumps require subcooled liquid oxygen (LOX) to cool the bearings. These kinds of burners are highly unusual, since their hot, oxygen-rich exhaust tends to attack metal, causing <b>burn-through</b> failures. The United States had not investigated oxygen-rich combustion technologies until the Integrated Powerhead Demonstrator project in the early 2000s. The Soviets, however, perfected the metallurgy behind this method. The nozzle was constructed from [...] metal, brazed to an outer and inner lining, giving a simple, light, but strong structure. In addition, since the NK-33 uses LOX and RP-1 as propellants, which have similar densities, a single rotating shaft {{could be used for}} both turbopumps. The NK-33 engine is among the highest thrust-to-weight ratio of any Earth-launchable rocket engine, only NPO Energomash RD-253 and SpaceX Merlin 1D engine achieve a higher ratio. The specific impulse of the NK-33 is significantly higher than both these engines. The NK-43 is similar to the NK-33, but is designed for an upper stage, not a first stage. It has a longer nozzle, optimized for operation at altitude, where there is little to no ambient air pressure. This gives it a higher thrust and specific impulse, but makes it longer and heavier.

5000|$|In Shakesperean theater, {{red wine}} {{was used in}} a glass {{container}} as a light filter. In later days, colored water or silk was used to filter light in the theater. Later, a gelatin base became the material of choice. Gelatin gel was available at least until 1979. The name gel has continued {{to be used to}} the present day. Gelatin based color media had no melting point, and the color was cast in the media as opposed to being coated on the surface, both important properties for color media. It would, however, char at high temperature and became brittle once heated, so it was impossible to handle once used in the lighting instrument. By 1945 more heat-tolerant self-extinguishing acetate-based through-dyed materials were being manufactured (marketed as Chromoid then Cinemoid by Strand Electric). In the States Roscolene (acetate) was also developed to deal with these higher output light sources. Though cheaper, the acetate filters fell out of favor with professional organizations since they could not withstand the higher temperatures produced by the 'tungsten halogen lamps' that came into widespread use in the late 1960s. The acetate-based material was replaced by polycarbonates like Roscolar (mylar polycarbonate) and polyester based filters. These materials have superior heat tolerance when compared to acetate-based gels. Many were transparent film with a surface coating. The first dyed polyester [...] "gels" [...] were introduced by Berkey-Colortran in 1969 as Gelatran, the original deep dyed polyester. The Gelatran process is still used today to produce GAMColor (100% of the line) and Roscolux (apx. 30% of the line). Other color manufacturers, such as Lee Filters and Apollo Design Technology use a surface applied dye. (Roscolux is 70% polycarbonate and 30% deep dyed polyester.) Almost every color manufacturer today uses either polycarbonate or polyester to manufacture their [...] "gels". Even today's gels can burn out (to lighten in color starting in the center) easily, rendering them useless. To help combat this, a high temperature (HT) material (polyester having the highest melting point 480 °F (250 °C)), can be used to help prolong the life in high-heat output lighting instruments. As instrument design improves, it has become a selling point on many lights to have as little heat radiating {{from the front of the}} fixture as possible to help prevent <b>burn-through,</b> and help keep the stage and actors cooler during performances.|$|E
50|$|In 1932 the Char D1 was {{the most}} — indeed the only — modern tank matériel {{available}} to the French Army. Therefore, {{it was out of}} the question to delegate this type to the role of mere infantry support. It now should function as the Char de Bataille, with the main task of fighting enemy armour, as was shown by the choice for a 47 mm gun and the presence of radio sets. The ten NC31s were used for driver training; the other vehicles were allocated to three battalions, one each in 507, 508 and 510 RCC, the elite tank units. As the threat of war steadily increased, first through Soviet military build-up and then because of Germany's rearmament, the modern equipment was supposed to show to foreign powers that France was still a force to be reckoned with. For the regiments receiving the new tank, it was a grave disappointment however. The main reason for this, besides the fact that the obsolete Renault FT turrets had to be used for the first four years, lay in its very poor mechanical reliability. In March 1934, when 110 vehicles had been delivered, it was reported that seventeen of these were already worn out and had to return to the factory for a complete rebuild; of the remaining 93, 62 were non-operational because of major defects. The <b>burn-through</b> of brakes and transmissions was common; the armour plates were bent out of shape because the chassis was not stiff enough, their rivets regularly snapping. The fundamental cause of this was that the Renault design team tended to solve the problem of how to combine low weight with low cost by applying weak components of inferior steel quality: other Renault designs as the AMR 33, AMC 35 and Char D2 suffered from comparable problems. In 1935 a large maintenance programme was started to improve the Char D1's mechanical reliability; but when in March 1936 the elite units had to hurry to the German border in reaction to the Rhineland Crisis, it became painfully obvious how poor their readiness still was. The new ST2 turret only worsened the situation: the glass of the diascopes was discovered to shatter by mere driving; there was no AP-shot available, except for about twenty tanks equipped with the naval 47 mm gun, fitted because the regular SA34 was in short supply; the munition racks hadn't yet been changed to hold the larger rounds. The SA34 was too weak a gun anyway; but the turret was too small to be adapted to the much more powerful 47 mm SA35. Analysis of the events led the Army to conclude that it should rid itself as soon as possible of the troublesome matériel. Even though some modifications were implemented, such as a changed antenna base that did not obstruct turret rotation, early 1937, when newer types were available, all Char D1s in mainland France were phased out, with the exception of the NC31s.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper will}} discuss {{simulations}} {{of the full}} ionization process (i. e. plasma <b>burn-through),</b> fundamental to creating high temperature plasma. By means of an applied electric field, the gas is partially ionized by the electron avalanche process. In order for the electron temperature to increase, the remaining neutrals need to be fully ionized in the plasma <b>burn-through</b> phase, as radiation is the main contribution to the electron power loss. The radiated power loss can be significantly affected by impurities resulting from interaction with the plasma facing components. The DYON code is a plasma <b>burn-through</b> simulator developed at Joint European Torus (JET) (Kim et al and EFDA-JET Contributors 2012 Nucl. Fusion 52 [[URL] 103016, Kim, Sips and EFDA-JET Contributors 2013 Nucl. Fusion 53 [[URL] 083024). The dynamic evolution of the plasma temperature and plasma densities including the impurity content is calculated in a self-consistent way using plasma wall interaction models. The recent installation of a beryllium wall at JET enabled validation of the plasma <b>burn-through</b> model {{in the presence of}} new, metallic plasma facing components. The simulation results of the plasma <b>burn-through</b> phase show a consistent good agreement against experiments at JET, and explain differences observed during plasma initiation with the old carbon plasma facing components. In the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), the allowable toroidal electric field is restricted to 0. 35 (V m − 1), which is significantly lower compared to the typical value (∼ 1  (V m − 1)) used in the present devices. The limitation on toroidal electric field also reduces the range of other operation parameters during plasma formation in ITER.

With the geometric configuration of the channels changed, energy is more efficiently transferred from the initiators to the boosters. With the alloy change to steel, the initiator flame channels do not erode upon firing, eliminating the possibility of <b>burn-through.</b> Flight qualification tests have been successfully passed...|$|E
