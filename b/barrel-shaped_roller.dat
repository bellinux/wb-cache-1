50|$|These joints {{are used}} at the inboard end of car driveshafts. The joints were {{developed}} by Michel Orain, of Glaenzer Spicer of Poissy, France. This joint has a three-pointed yoke attached to the shaft, which has <b>barrel-shaped</b> <b>roller</b> bearings on the ends. These fit into a cup with three matching grooves, attached to the differential. Since there is only significant movement in one axis, this simple arrangement works well. These also allow an axial 'plunge' movement of the shaft, so that engine rocking and other effects do not preload the bearings. A typical Tripod joint has up to 50 mm of plunge travel, and 26 degrees of angular articulation. The tripod joint does not have as much angular range {{as many of the}} other joint types, but tends to be lower in cost and more efficient. Due to this it is typically used in rear wheel drive vehicle configurations or on the inboard side of front wheel drive vehicles where the required range of motion is lower.|$|E
5000|$|In 1972, BSA {{was also}} in {{financial}} trouble. It was given UK Government help {{on the condition that}} it merged with Norton-Villiers, and in 1973, the new Norton Villiers Triumph (NVT) was formed. The Triumph Motorcycles name came from BSA's Triumph subsidiary. In April 1973 an 8.5:1 compression 828 cc [...] "850" [...] engine was released with German FAG SuperBlend bearings. These, featuring slightly <b>barrel-shaped</b> <b>rollers,</b> had been introduced on late model 750 cc engines to cure the Combat engine's problems of crank-flex and the consequent digging-in to the bearing-surface of the initial cylindrical bearing rollers. This model produced [...] at 6,250 rpm but the stated power does not give a true picture of the engine performance because increased torque seemed {{to make up for the}} reduced horsepower.|$|R
40|$|DE 19827608 C UPAB: 20000330 NOVELTY - The {{system has}} {{transport}} (1) and guide (2) rollers, which are located rotationally and are driven with a constant rpm. The transport roller and the guide roller are driven {{in the same}} direction. The transport roller consists of a transport section (T) and a test section (P), and the transport section (T) {{is formed as a}} worm conveyor. The surfaces of the roller bearings (6) are tested. USE - Conveying and testing cylindrical, conical or <b>barrel-shaped</b> bodies, especially <b>rollers</b> for roller bearings. ADVANTAGE - Facilitates an automatic testing of bodies in addition to conveying bodies. Very short working cycle times are realizable, e. g. less than 0. 4 s...|$|R
