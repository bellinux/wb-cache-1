5|$|Plaque is a <b>biofilm</b> {{consisting}} of {{large quantities of}} various bacteria that form on teeth. If not removed regularly, plaque buildup can lead to periodontal problems such as gingivitis. Given time, plaque can mineralize along the gingiva, forming tartar. The microorganisms that form the <b>biofilm</b> are almost entirely bacteria (mainly streptococcus and anaerobes), with the composition varying by location in the mouth. Streptococcus mutans {{is the most important}} bacterium associated with dental caries.|$|E
5|$|The {{bacteria}} that cause urinary tract infections typically enter the bladder via the urethra. However, infection may also occur via the blood or lymph. It {{is believed that}} the bacteria are usually transmitted to the urethra from the bowel, with females at greater risk due to their anatomy. After gaining entry to the bladder, E.

25|$|Dispersal {{of cells}} from the <b>biofilm</b> colony is an {{essential}} stage of the <b>biofilm</b> life cycle. Dispersal enables biofilms to spread and colonize new surfaces. Enzymes that degrade the <b>biofilm</b> extracellular matrix, such as dispersin B and deoxyribonuclease, {{may play a role}} in <b>biofilm</b> dispersal. <b>Biofilm</b> matrix degrading enzymes may be useful as anti-biofilm agents. Recent evidence has shown that a fatty acid messenger, cis-2-decenoic acid, is capable of inducing dispersion and inhibiting growth of <b>biofilm</b> colonies. Secreted by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, this compound induces cyclo heteromorphic cells in several species of bacteria and the yeast Candida albicans.|$|E

25|$|The {{dental plaque}} <b>biofilm</b> {{can result in}} the disease dental caries if it is allowed to develop over time. An ecologic shift away from {{balanced}} populations within the dental <b>biofilm</b> is driven by certain (cariogenic) microbiological populations beginning to dominate when the environment favours them. The shift to an acidogenic, aciduric, and cariogenic microbiological population develops and is maintained by frequent consumption of fermentable dietary carbohydrate. The resulting activity shift in the <b>biofilm</b> (and resulting acid production within the <b>biofilm,</b> at the tooth surface) is associated with an imbalance between demineralization and remineralisation leading to net mineral loss within dental hard tissues (enamel and then dentin), the sign and symptom being a carious lesion. By preventing the dental plaque <b>biofilm</b> from maturing or by returning it back to a non-cariogenic state, dental caries can be prevented and arrested. This can be achieved though the behavioural step of reducing the supply of fermentable carbohydrates (i.e. sugar intake) and frequent removal of the <b>biofilm</b> (i.e. toothbrushing).|$|E

40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that surface wettability does not alter {{the positive effect of}} natural <b>biofilms</b> on larval attachment in the barnacle Balanus amphitrite. We also answered the question: Does substratum-biofilm interaction affect the larval choice in barnacle? We developed natural multi-species <b>biofilms</b> of different ages on both high (glass) and low (polystyrene) wettability surfaces at mid-intertidal height (native habitat of B. amphitrite). Attachment choice of both young (0 -d-old) and old (6 -d-old) larvae to <b>biofilms</b> was determined using still water choice bioassay. Irrespective of larval age, cyprid preferred to attach to un-filmed glass than to un-filmed polystyrene. In contrast to aged larvae, young larvae preferred old (6 -d-old) <b>biofilms</b> on polystyrene to young (3 -d-old) <b>biofilms</b> on glass. In this study, we were also able to examine the interaction between surface wettability, <b>biofilms</b> and larval attachment, by characterizing bacterial community composition in <b>biofilms.</b> Bacterial community composition showed significant differences between <b>biofilms</b> of different ages. Old <b>biofilms</b> positively influenced larval attachment, irrespective of the type of substrata, thereby supporting {{the hypothesis that}} surface wettability does not alter the positive effect of natural <b>biofilms</b> on larval attachment. © 2008 Elsevier B.

25|$|However, biofilms are {{not always}} less {{susceptible}} to antibiotics. For instance, the <b>biofilm</b> form of Pseudomonas aeruginosa has no greater resistance to antimicrobials than do stationary-phase planktonic cells, although when the <b>biofilm</b> is compared to logarithmic-phase planktonic cells, the <b>biofilm</b> does have greater resistance to antimicrobials. This resistance to antibiotics in both stationary-phase cells and biofilms {{may be due to}} the presence of persister cells.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} main phases of <b>biofilm</b> {{development}} and rhamnolipids are implicated in each phase. Rhamnolipids {{are reported to}} promote motility, thereby inhibiting attachment by preventing cells from adhering tightly to the substratum. During <b>biofilm</b> development, rhamnolipids are reported to create and maintain fluid channels for water and oxygen flow {{around the base of}} the <b>biofilm.</b> Furthermore, they are important for forming structure in biofilms; a rhlA mutant forms a flat <b>biofilm.</b> <b>Biofilm</b> dispersal is dependent on Rhammnolipids, however other factors such as degradation of the matrix and activation of motility are also likely to be necessary. It has been shown using fluorescence microscopy that the rhlAB operon is induced in the centre of the mushroom cap, followed by dispersal of cells from the polysaccharide matrix from the centre of these caps causing a cavity to form. A mutation in rhlA causes a failure in formation of mushroom caps at all.|$|E

25|$|<b>Biofilm</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} common reasons for delayed healing in {{pressure}} ulcers. <b>Biofilm</b> occurs rapidly in wounds and stalls healing by keeping the wound inflamed. Frequent debridement and antimicrobial dressings are needed to control the <b>biofilm.</b> Infection prevents healing of pressure ulcers. Signs of pressure ulcer infection include slow or delayed healing and pale granulation tissue. Signs and symptoms of systemic infection include fever, pain, redness, swelling, warmth of the area, and purulent discharge. Additionally, infected wounds may have a gangrenous smell, be discolored, and may eventually produce more pus.|$|E
25|$|During surface {{colonization}} bacteria {{cells are}} able to communicate using quorum sensing (QS) products such as N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL).

In addition to the polysaccharides, these matrices may also contain material from the surrounding environment, including but not limited to minerals, soil particles, and blood components, such as erythrocytes and fibrin.

25|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that competence development and <b>biofilm</b> formation is an adaptation of S. pneumoniae to survive the defenses of the host. In particular, the host’s polymorphonuclear leukocytes produce an oxidative burst to defend against the invading bacteria, and this response can kill bacteria by damaging their DNA. Competent S. pneumoniae in a <b>biofilm</b> have the survival advantage that they can more easily take up transforming DNA from nearby cells in the <b>biofilm</b> to use for recombinational repair of oxidative damages in their DNA. Competent S. pneumoniae can also secrete an enzyme (murein hydrolase) that destroys non-competent cells (fratricide) causing DNA to be released into the surrounding medium for potential use by the competent cells.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{metabolic}} activity in single and dual species <b>biofilms</b> of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus isolates was investigated. Our results demonstrated {{that there was}} less metabolic activity in dual species <b>biofilms</b> compared to S. aureus <b>biofilms.</b> However, this was not observed if S. aureus and S. epidermidis {{were obtained from the}} same sample. The largest effect on metabolic activity was observed in <b>biofilms</b> of S. aureus Mu 50 and S. epidermidis ET- 024. A transcriptomic analysis of these dual species <b>biofilms</b> showed that urease genes and genes encoding proteins involved in metabolism were downregulated in comparison to monospecies <b>biofilms.</b> These results were subsequently confirmed by phenotypic assays. As metabolic activity is related to acid production, the pH in dual species <b>biofilms</b> was slightly higher compared to S. aureus Mu 50 <b>biofilms.</b> Our results showed that S. epidermidis ET- 024 in dual species <b>biofilms</b> inhibits metabolic activity of S. aureus Mu 50, leading to less acid production. As a consequence, less urease activity is required to compensate for low pH. Importantly, this effect was biofilm-specific. Also S. aureus Mu 50 genes encoding virulence-associated proteins (Spa, SpIF and Dps) were upregulated in dual species <b>biofilms</b> compared to monospecies <b>biofilms</b> and using Caenorhabditis elegans infection assays, we demonstrated that more nematodes survived when co-infected with S. epidermidis ET- 024 and S. aureus mutants lacking functional spa, spIF or dps genes, compared to nematodes infected with S. epidermidis ET- 024 and wild type S. aureus. Finally, S. epidermidis ET- 024 genes encoding resistance to oxacillin, erythromycin and tobramycin were upregulated in dual species <b>biofilms</b> and increased resistance was subsequently confirmed.
