Tom forces Jerry to jump through a <b>ball</b> <b>rack,</b> even setting it on fire, before {{discarding}} the flaming rack and shooting the 8-ball across the table, which rebounds and hits Jerry, giving the mouse the 8-mark printed on his rear like a tattoo. Enraged, Jerry flings Tom's cue stick into his face.|$|E
50|$|Coloured <b>ball</b> <b>racking</b> {{positions}} must {{be remembered}} with care, as each time a coloured ball is potted, it is immediately replaced to its starting position, which occurs multiple times per frame, whereas reds are not returned to the table's surface after being potted.|$|R
50|$|After he {{took over}} in 1950, {{basketball}} coach Bud Millikan said the boxing doubleheader events were indicative of the sad state of Maryland athletics, {{and put an end}} to them early in his tenure. He also complained the facility had no <b>ball</b> <b>racks,</b> with basketballs stored in duct-taped cardboard boxes instead, and that the team had played in high school arenas that were more adequate than Ritchie Coliseum.|$|R
5000|$|While {{the modern}} folk game of three-ball bears no {{resemblance}} to nine-ball, the earliest-known version of three-ball was essentially nine-ball played with only three <b>balls,</b> <b>racked</b> in a triangle, in which the 3 ball was the [...] It is a quick game, and (due to the comparatively very high possibility of pocketing the 3 ball on the break) one with a more significant luck component than nine-ball and most other pool games.|$|R

50|$|Jerry flees, but Tom {{pushes a}} line of bowling balls towards Jerry. Jerry outruns the balls and hides under the ball-eject lane, but the balls return in reverse. Tom opens his mouth, but a ball runs into his mouth instead. Jerry then pops out {{of it as the}} balls hit Tom. Tom slides down the <b>ball</b> <b>rack,</b> is {{squeezed}} through the arch, and is knocked out by two balls. Tom sticks his finger into the ball Jerry is hiding in, but Jerry bites him. Tom then blows into the ball to make Jerry pop out, but the ball drops on Tom's left foot. Jerry then stomps on Tom's foot to slow him down.|$|E

50|$|The term money shot is {{used during}} the 3-point {{shooting}} competition in basketball, {{in reference to the}} 5 or last <b>ball</b> in the <b>rack,</b> which is worth twice as many points as the other <b>balls</b> in the <b>rack</b> if the shot is made.|$|R
5000|$|As {{with other}} pool and billiards games, trick shots usually utilize a , {{one or more}} , and a cue stick. However, many props {{can be used in}} trick shots {{including}} bottles, drinking glasses, baskets, coins, <b>ball</b> <b>racks,</b> cue tip chalk, and other billiards- and non-billiards-related equipment. Props are used to change the difficulty of the shot or add aesthetic value. As with artistic billiards pros, trick shot artists often have specialized cue sticks for performing particular types of shots, particularly [...] and massés.|$|R
500|$|At {{the start}} of the game a {{standard}} set of fifteen pool object <b>balls</b> are <b>racked</b> at the [...] end of a pool table, with the [...] of the rack centered over the [...] Viewed from the racker's vantage point, the 1 ball is placed at the rack's apex, the 2 <b>ball</b> at the <b>rack's</b> right corner and the 3 <b>ball</b> at the <b>rack's</b> left corner (as in the game of rotation); all other object balls are placed randomly. An [...] is required, meaning that at least four balls must be driven to rails (as opposed to a , such as is used for the opening break in straight pool and one-pocket).|$|R
5000|$|As of the 2000s, {{the rules}} have been {{somewhat}} in flux in certain contexts, especially in Europe. The European Pocket Billiard Federation (EPBF), BCA's WPA-affiliate counterpart in Europe, has done away with standardized racking techniques, and instead relies upon s in the cloth to position the balls, with no physical <b>ball</b> <b>rack</b> required; these indentations are carefully created using a [...] "", such that the divots are slightly closer together {{than they would be}} expected to be, thus creating ball-on-ball pressure as the balls settle partially into the divot pattern, into which they cannot quite fit. This results in an especially tight rack, without any known possibility of cheating by carefully manipulating the ball positions while racking. This innovative racking technique was invented and patented as the Rack-M-Rite Racking Template by US professional player David Smith and his partner Dale Craig and first used in professional events on the Billiard Channel Tour in 2000 by tournament director David Vandenburgh. It is now the official rack of the EPBF Euro-Tour.|$|E
50|$|In both one-pocket {{and bank}} pool all fifteen object <b>balls</b> are <b>racked</b> entirely at random, {{with the center}} of the apex ball placed {{directly}} over the foot spot.|$|R
5000|$|Competitors try {{to score}} as many points as {{possible}} in one minute. There are five <b>ball</b> <b>racks</b> laid out over the three point arc: one on each baseline, one halfway between the baseline {{and the top of}} the arc on each side, and one {{at the top of the}} arc. Each <b>rack</b> has five <b>balls,</b> four of which are worth one point (the standard orange balls) and the fifth one (a red, white, and blue ball; nicknamed the [...] "money ball") is worth two points. Thus a perfect score is 30 points.|$|R
5000|$|Seven-ball is {{a similar}} game, the primary {{differences}} being there are only seven object <b>balls,</b> <b>racked</b> in a hexagon, and the game is won by pocketing the 7 ball. Seven-ball is ed with the 1 ball at the apex on the [...] and the 7 ball (the [...] ) {{in the center of}} the hexagon. This game is not particularly common, and is primarily known because of ESPN's Sudden Death Seven-ball which aired in the early 2000s. Though hardly necessary, specialized equipment for the game can be purchased, including a unique black-striped seven ball and a hexagonal rack.|$|R

5000|$|After {{the initial}} <b>rack,</b> the <b>balls</b> are played until only the cue ball and one object ball {{remain on the}} table's surface. At that time, the {{fourteen}} pocketed <b>balls</b> are <b>racked</b> with no apex <b>ball,</b> and the <b>rack</b> is so placed so that if the apex ball were in the rack, its center would rest directly over the table's foot spot. Play then continues with the cue ball shot from where it rested and the fifteenth ball from where it rested prior to racking.|$|R
50|$|During {{the run of}} the idents, {{there were}} also quick, usually humorous short {{animations}} shown before the trailers known as 'Stings'. Examples included a 2-shaped pancake landing in a frying pan, a '2' performing stunts on a bicycle, or a set of spinning plates {{in the form of the}} '2'. These were sometimes themed to suit a particular event, such as sport coverage; for instance, a set of snooker <b>balls</b> <b>racked</b> in the '2' shape. Animations were also created to match the theme of a year's Christmas symbol. During the 1995 Christmas period, for example, a set of short animations featuring Wallace and Gromit were used, along with a similarly themed ident.|$|R
5000|$|Ten-ball {{is a more}} {{stringent}} variant of the game, using ten <b>balls</b> (<b>racked</b> in a triangle with the 10 ball, the [...] in this case, in the center), in which all pocketed balls must be [...] and in which the money ball cannot be pocketed on the break for an instant win. Due to its more challenging nature, {{and the fact that}} there is no publicly known technique for reliably pocketing specific object balls on the break shot, there have been suggestions among the professional circuit that ten-ball should replace nine-ball as the pro game of choice, especially since the rise of the nine-ball soft break, which is still legal in most international and non-European competition. [...] Regardless of the future of the nine-ball versus ten-ball debate, there are already hotly contested professional ten-ball tournaments.|$|R
5000|$|To {{reach the}} point where an intragame rack becomes necessary, the balls are played until only the [...] and one object ball remain on the table's surface. At that time, if neither the cue ball nor the fifteenth object ball remain in the rack area (or is interfering with racking in the rack area), the {{fourteen}} pocketed object <b>balls</b> are <b>racked</b> with no apex <b>ball,</b> and the <b>rack</b> is placed so that if the apex ball were in the rack, its center would rest directly over the table's foot spot. Play then continues with the cue ball shot from where it rested and the fifteenth, non-racked, object ball from where it rested prior to racking.|$|R
50|$|The 10 <b>balls</b> are <b>racked</b> as a {{triangle}} {{as in the}} game of eight-ball (but with 10 instead of 15 object balls), with the 1 ball positioned at the apex of the <b>rack,</b> the 10 <b>ball</b> positioned {{in the middle of the}} rack, and the other balls placed randomly, with the apex ball on the foot spot.|$|R

5000|$|All of {{the object}} <b>balls</b> are <b>racked</b> in a {{triangle}} with the apex ball on the , and the game opened with a hard break (as in eight-ball); the 1 ball is played from where it lies after the break (unless pocketed on the break, in which case it is spotted back on the foot spot just {{as if it had}} been legally pocketed.) ...|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the value}} of {{pocketing}} multiple (especially all) object balls on the break, a strong break (and a skilled one, if the <b>balls</b> are triangularly <b>racked)</b> is an important technique.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>balls</b> are <b>racked</b> in a {{specific}} order: The 15 ball is at the apex; the 2 and 3 balls are directly behind the 15 ball (in either order); the 1 ball is in the center; the 13 and 14 balls are behind the 1 ball (in either order); and all other balls are placed in any remaining position. Pattern <b>racking</b> these remaining <b>balls</b> is also allowed. (See illustration) ...|$|R
5000|$|In eight-ball and nine-ball, {{the object}} is to sink object balls until one can legally pocket the winning eponymous [...] "". Well-known but waning in {{popularity}} is straight pool, in which players seek to continue sinking <b>balls,</b> <b>rack</b> after rack if they can, to reach a pre-determined winning score (typically 150). Related to nine-ball, another well-known game is rotation, where the lowest-numbered object ball on the table must be struck first, although any object ball may be pocketed (i.e., combination shot). Each pocketed ball is worth its number, and the player with the highest score {{at the end of the}} rack is the winner. Since there are only 120 points available (1 + 2 + 3 ⋯ + 15 = 120), scoring 61 points leaves no opportunity for the opponent to catch up. In both one-pocket and bank pool, the players must sink a set number of balls; respectively, all in a particular , or all by [...] In snooker, players score points by alternately potting [...] and various special [...] "".|$|R

5000|$|In nine-ball games where a [...] {{is given}} by one player being , some tournament venues enforce a rule that the spotted <b>ball</b> must be <b>racked</b> {{as one of the}} two balls in the row {{directly}} behind the 1 ball.|$|R
50|$|Another {{optional}} {{rule is that}} if {{the initial}} break attempt completely misses the <b>racked</b> <b>balls,</b> the subsequent break attempt(s) must be taken from where the cue ball comes to rest; the cue ball cannot be re-placed behind the head string.|$|R
