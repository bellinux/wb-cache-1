In particular, it is of great interest to develop an efficient mixer for uniform mixing in polymeric matrix of a small volume. For such a purpose a new miniaturized <b>batch</b> <b>type</b> <b>mixer</b> is developed in this study. Improved mixing performance is observed with the help of new data analysis procedure in terms of size distribution of agglomerates, mixing entropy and a standard deviation of the particles distribution, which are evaluated from the transmitted light microscopic images of the mixture obtained from the new mixer. The mixer is composed of a single screw and a chamber of 5. 7 mL cavity volume. The flight clearance between the single screw and the chamber wall is quite small in the order of 10 μm, inducing significant shear force for an effective dispersive mixing. In addition, a deep channel is employed in the single screw for an effective distributive mixing. For an experimental characterization of the mixer, a multiwall carbon nanotube (MWNT) and a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) pre-polymer are used as the nano particles and the matrix, respectively. The mixture sample of 100 μm thickness is observed by the transmitted light microscopy. For analyzing the mixing performance, we have proposed a new digital data processing procedure. The dispersive mixing efficiency is quantified by measuring the size distribution of agglomerates while the distributive mixing efficiency is evaluated by the mixing entropy and the standard deviation of MWNT distribution. The experimental results show that the mixing performance of the present mixer is better than the other mixing method like a sonification using a high power ultrasonic tip...|$|E

The scope of the investigations encompassed the determination of characteristics of delivery head and delivery rate for three <b>types</b> of air-water <b>mixers</b> applied in the constructed air lift pump. Using the obtained results, {{the efficiency of the}} three <b>types</b> of air-water <b>mixers</b> applied in this air lift pump was determined. The analysis was carried out and there was checked whether the improved analytical Stenning-Martin model can be used to design air lift pumps with the air-water <b>mixers</b> of these <b>types.</b> The highest capacity in the water transport was reached by the air lift pump with the 1 st <b>type</b> air-water <b>mixer,</b> the lowest one – with the 3 rd <b>type</b> air-water <b>mixer.</b> The water flow in the air lift pump increases along with the rise in the air flow. The lower are the hydraulic losses generated during flow of the air flux by the air-water mixer, the higher is the air lift pump capacity. Along with the rise in the water delivery head, the capacity of the air lift pump decreases. The highest efficiency is reached by the air lift pump with the 1 st <b>type</b> air-water <b>mixer,</b> the lowest – with the 3 st <b>type</b> air-water <b>mixer.</b> The efficiency of the air lift pump for the three investigated <b>types</b> of air-water <b>mixers</b> decreases along with the rise in air flow rate and water delivery head. The values of submergence ratio (h/L) of the delivery pipe, calculated {{with the use of the}} improved analytical Stenning-Martin model, coincide quite well with the values of h/L determined from the measurements...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: On {{concrete}} dam construction work, {{it is necessary}} to manufacture a large amount of concrete and CSG (Cemented Sand and Gravel). The manufacture plant of concrete and CSG is operated in very long term, therefore the effect of its environmental impact could be serious. In general, {{there are two types of}} manufacture plant on the process of manufacturing concrete or CSG. The one is <b>batch</b> <b>type</b> plant; its mixing process is not continuous and {{it is necessary to}} repeat the processes of measuring and mixing every batch. The other is continuous mixing plant; mixing process is completely continuous, at the same time, the measurement and supplement of materials are also carried out continuously. Since continuous mixing plant can manufacture a large amount of products at short time, continuous mixing plant is suitable for manufacture plant of {{concrete dam}} construction. But it is hard to control the quality of products, so <b>batch</b> <b>type</b> plant used to be adopted as the mixer of the manufacture plant. In recent years, the new continuous mixing plant which can control the quality of products accurately has developed and been put to practical use on several projects of concrete and CSG dam construction. The best feature of this plant is its energy saving effect. This plant is equipped with a static continuous mixer for mixing concrete or CSG. This mixer is set up in vertical direction, and then it is possible to mix materials with no electric power but only by gravity force. In this study, environmental impact due to manufacture concrete and CSG by conventional <b>batch</b> <b>type</b> plant and new continuous mixing plant are estimated and compared, and then the advantage of new continues mixing plant for environment is discussed...|$|R
