5|$|Alcibiades first rose to {{prominence}} {{when he began}} advocating aggressive Athenian action after {{the signing of the}} Peace of Nicias. That treaty, an uneasy truce between Sparta and Athens signed midway through the Peloponnesian War, came at the end of seven years of fighting during which neither side had gained a decisive advantage. Historians Arnold W. Gomme and Raphael Sealey <b>believe,</b> <b>and</b> Thucydides reports, that Alcibiades was offended that the Spartans had negotiated that treaty through Nicias and Laches, overlooking him on account of his youth.|$|E
5|$|Itachi's Japanese voice actor, Hideo Ishikawa, often {{talked with}} Sasuke's Japanese actor, Noriaki Sugiyama, about their {{characters}}. When the two characters first confronted, both Ishikawa and Sugiyama found Itachi's massacre of the Uchiha clan hard to <b>believe</b> <b>and</b> started {{to read the}} Naruto manga {{in order to see}} if Itachi was hiding something. After Itachi's death, the two actors noted that in the end Itachi served as a good old brother to Sasuke. English actor Crispin Freeman was pleased with voicing Itachi regardless of how many times he revisited the series.|$|E
40|$|Using the European and World Value Surveys from 1981, 1990, and 2000, {{this paper}} {{examines}} trends in Christian beliefs, church attendance, {{and the relationship}} between <b>believing</b> <b>and</b> belonging. It further looks at the influence of religious pluralism on this relationship in Western Europe and North America. The main finding {{of this study is that}} in most countries there is no growing gap between Christian <b>believing</b> <b>and</b> Christian belonging. Indeed, the relationship between <b>believing</b> <b>and</b> belonging at the individual level has remained practically unchanged in the Western world over the past two decades. The slight weakening in the relation between <b>believing</b> <b>and</b> belonging measured for some countries stems from the fact that in those countries both <b>believing</b> <b>and</b> belonging declined, but the decline in belonging was stronger. Moreover, a higher degree of religious pluralism does not result in a stronger association between <b>believing</b> <b>and</b> belonging, as would be expected from supply-side theory. ...|$|R

5|$|The German attack caught {{large numbers}} of Soviet Air Force {{aircraft}} on the ground. Faulty tactics – sending unescorted bombers against the Germans at regular intervals in tactically unsound formations – accounted for many more. Kesselring reported {{that in the first}} week of operations Luftflotte 2 had accounted for 2,500 Soviet aircraft in the air and on the ground. Even Göring found these figures hard to <b>believe</b> <b>and</b> ordered them to be re-checked. As the ground troops advanced, the figures could be directly confirmed and were found to be too low. Within days, Kesselring was able to fly solo over the front in his Focke-Wulf Fw 189.|$|E
5|$|The {{way that}} leads to the abyss for the German people has now come. The party patriots {{continue}} ever to <b>believe</b> <b>and</b> hope. Also, there are still those who do not want to see, and they expect a miracle from the Führer. Those are {{the kind of people who}} do not give up hope even at the edge of the grave. In all other respects, the number of peace seekers grows from hour to hour. The coming generations, and the foreign countries, will want to understand why the German people themselves did not turn against the party tyranny and stop the Nazi Party leaders by force in order to terminate this horrible war. For this, something should be said to clear up the question.|$|E
5|$|Some Muslims, {{especially}} those living near the southern coast, took {{the option of}} exile, but for most, publicly converting to Christianity while secretly continuing to <b>believe</b> <b>and</b> practise Islam was the only available option for surviving as Muslims. The population converted en masse, and by 1501 the entire Muslim population of Granada was nominally converted to Christianity. The apparent success of Granada's forced conversions triggered a series of edicts and proclamations in 1501 and 1502 which effectively put the Muslims elsewhere in Castile to the same fate. These new converts, along with their descendants, were known by Spanish sources as the Moriscos. As well as having to accept Christianity and abandon the Islamic faith and rituals, they were also pressured to conform to Christian ways, including by attending church, sending their children to be instructed in the Christian doctrine, and partaking of food and beverages forbidden by Islamic law.|$|E

25|$|To these succeeds {{the fourth}} decree, by which God decreed {{to save and}} damn certain {{particular}} persons.

25|$|One of {{the most}} heavily debated topics of the period was that of faith versus reason. Avicenna and Averroes both leaned more {{on the side of}} reason. Augustine stated that he would never allow his {{philosophical}} investigations to go beyond the authority of God. Anselm attempted to defend against what he saw as partly an assault on faith, with an approach allowing for both faith and reason. The Augustinian solution to the faith/reason problem is to (1) <b>believe,</b> <b>and</b> then (2) seek to understand.|$|E

25|$|For Unger, society emerges {{not through}} {{compromise}} or the winnowing down of best options, but rather though conflict and struggle {{for control of}} political and material resources. The victors of this struggle come to set the terms of social interaction and transaction, which is then institutionalized through law. This emergent order Unger calls formative context. Under a particular formative context, routines are established and people come to <b>believe</b> <b>and</b> act as if their social words were coherent wholes that are perfectly intelligible and defensible. They {{come to see the}} existing arrangements as necessary. Unger calls this false necessity. In reality, these arrangements are arbitrary and hold together rather tenuously, which leaves them open to resistance and change. This opposition Unger calls negative capability.|$|E

She is silently growing into power. Her doctrines are exerting their influence in legislative halls, in the churches, and in the hearts of men. She is piling up her lofty and massive structures in the secret recesses of which her former persecutions will be repeated. Stealthily and unsuspectedly she is strengthening her forces to further her own ends when the time shall come for her to strike. All that she desires is vantage ground, and this is already being given her. We shall soon see and shall feel what the purpose of the Roman element is. Whoever shall <b>believe</b> <b>and</b> obey the word of God will thereby incur reproach and persecution.|$|E
25|$|The {{fieldwork}} {{leading up}} to French DNA: Trouble in Purgatory focused on a multidimensional crisis revolving around a proposal for commercial collaboration between an American biotechnology start-up company and the French laboratory that led the genome sequencing effort in France, the CEPH. As opposed to his earlier book, French Modern, French DNA is not {{a history of the}} present but an initial case study in the anthropology of the contemporary. Rabinow accepted the challenge from the Center’s scientific director to be a 'philosophic observer.’ His task was to identify the formation of constellations of value judgments around new forms of scientific knowledge, and to make that process available for further debate and modification, not to adjudicate disputes. The text is in part a meditation on committed ‘disinterestedness:’ “a certain vocational integrity, an asceticism in Weber and Foucault's senses, a certain rigor and patience that could, lead us somewhere beyond what we already <b>believe</b> <b>and</b> know.” This work still emphasizes the observation in “participant-observation” and can be contrasted to latter work at SynBERC in which both poles are put into play.|$|E
