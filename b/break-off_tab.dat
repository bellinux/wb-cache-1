50|$|While VHS and Beta tapes have a <b>break-off</b> <b>tab</b> {{to protect}} {{recordings}} from erasure (as in audio Compact Cassettes and, once broken, the cavity {{left by the}} missing tab must be covered or filled before the tape can be reused), VCCs employ a reversible solution: a switch on the tape edge can be turned to red/orange to protect the recordings, and back to black/brown (depending on the colour of the cassette housing) to re-record. The switch covers/uncovers a hole along the tape edge which is detected by a sensor in the machine.|$|E
50|$|Another 3-inch (75 mm) format was Mitsumi's Quick Disk format. The Quick Disk {{format is}} {{referred}} to in various size references: 2.8-inch, 3-inch×3-inch and 3-inch×4-inch. Mitsumi offered this as OEM equipment, expecting their VAR customers to customize the packaging for their own particular use; disks thus vary in storage capacity and casing size. The Quick Disk uses a 2.8-inch magnetic media, <b>break-off</b> write-protection <b>tabs</b> (one for each side), and contains a see-through hole near center spindle (used to ensure spindle clamping). Nintendo packaged the 2.8-inch magnetic media in a 3-inch×4-inch housing, while others packaged the same media in a 3 inch×3 inch square housing.|$|R
