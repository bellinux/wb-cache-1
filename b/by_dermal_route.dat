40|$|Acute {{systemic}} toxicity data (LD 50 values) and hazard classifications derived in the rat following oral administration and dermal application have been analysed {{to examine whether}} or not orally-derived hazard classification or LD 50 values {{can be used to}} determine dermal hazard classification. Comparing the oral and dermal classifications for 335 substances derived from oral and dermal LD 50 values respectively revealed 17 % concordance, and indicated that 7 % of substances would be classified less severely while 76 % would be classified more severely if oral classifications were applied directly to the <b>dermal</b> <b>route.</b> In contrast, applying the oral LD 50 values within the dermal classification criteria to determine the dermal classification reduced the concordance to 15 % and the relative ‘under-classification’ to 1 %, but increased the relative ‘over-classification’ to 84 %. Both under- and over-classification are undesirable, and mitigation strategies are discussed.

40|$|Rigorous {{evaluation}} of high production volume chemicals are required (ECB, 20031, {{but there are}} few occupational dermal exposure data to aid the risk assessments. Dermal exposure assessment methodology {{is also in the}} early stages of development (Fenske, 2000). The physical properties of metals need to be take into account when measuring exposure and assessing risks (Flint, 1998). A method was therefore developed to measure dermal exposure to metal particles, and workplace surveys were carried out for antimony, lead, zinc and nickel. Inhalation exposure data were also collected for comparison with the dermal exposure measurements. The dermal exposures for nickel workers were used to assess the risk of induction or elicitation of nickel sensitivity. A mathematical model was constructed to describe the total systemic absorption from inhalation, <b>dermal</b> and ingestion <b>routes</b> of exposure for all four of the substances. The summary data for each of the exposure categories were used as inputs to the model and estimates of absorbed dose were derived. The soluble nickel exposures for nickel production workers were in some cases well in excess of the NOEL value of 0. 3 ug/crn" (DEPA, 2008) for elicitation of nickel dermatitis in nickel sensitive individuals, indicating that individuals with pre-existing nickel sensitivity should not be employed in this industry. Only the stainless steel production worker exposures were below the NOEL value. The absorption model showed that absorption <b>by</b> the <b>dermal</b> <b>route</b> could equal that of the inhaled dose for antimony workers. The dermal absorption of lead for lead workers was found to be insignificant compared to inhalation exposures. In the zinc industry, the estimated dermal absorption was significant in the zinc chemical production processes, but not in zinc refining or in galvanising. In the case of nickel industry, the dermal absorption was significant for electro winning, nickel compounds and nickel powder production.

40|$|There is some {{indication}} from toxicokinetic studies that arsenic and its inorganic compounds have measurable, but limited {{potential to be}} absorbed through the skin of humans and animals [Dutkiewicz 1977; Wester et al. 1993; Turkall 2003]. The limited availability <b>by</b> the <b>dermal</b> <b>route</b> {{is consistent with the}} results of the acute dermal toxicity study identified in animals [Gaines 1960] that indicates that arsenic is not acutely toxic despite its known acute toxicity via other routes. These data are insufficient to adequately evaluate the potential of arsenic and its inorganic compounds to cause systemic effects, including skin cancers, following dermal exposure. Case reports and human studies [Pinto and McGill 1953; Bourrain 1998; Mohamed 1998] and data from animals [Boutwell 1963] indicate that chronic or high-dose dermal exposure to arsenic can result in irritant contact dermatitis. An in vivo animal study using the GPMT did not support the weak skin sensitization data in humans [Wahlberg and Boman 1986].

40|$|Biomathematical {{modeling}} {{has become}} an important tool to assess xenobiotic exposure in humans. In the present study, {{we have used a}} human physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model and an simple compartmental toxicokinetic model of benzo(a) pyrene (BaP) kinetics and its 3 -hydroxybenzo(a) pyrene (3 -OHBaP) metabolite to reproduce the time-course of this biomarker of exposure in the urine of industrially exposed workers and in turn predict the most plausible exposure scenarios. The models were constructed from in vivo experimental data in rats and then extrapolated from animals to humans after assessing and adjusting the most sensitive model parameters as well as species specific physiological parameters. Repeated urinary voids from workers exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been collected {{over the course of a}} typical workweek and during subsequent days off work; urinary concentrations of 3 -OHBaP were then determined. Based on the information obtained for each worker (BaP air concentration, daily shift hours, tasks, protective equipment), the time courses of 3 -OHBaP in the urine of the different workers have been simulated using the PBPK and toxicokinetic models, considering the various possible exposure <b>routes,</b> oral, <b>dermal</b> and inhalation. Both models were equally able to closely reproduce the observed time course of 3 -OHBaP in the urine of workers and predicted similar exposure scenarios. Simulations of various scenarios suggest that the workers under study were exposed mainly <b>by</b> the <b>dermal</b> <b>route.</b> Comparison of measured air concentration levels of BaP with simulated values needed to obtain a good approximation of observed time course further pointed out that inhalation was not the main route of exposure for most of the studied workers.

40|$|Earthworms {{may take}} up {{chemicals}} from soil and pore water, both through their skin (<b>dermal)</b> and <b>by</b> ingestion (oral). It remains unclear, however, what {{the relative importance}} of these pathways is. To assess bioavailability of pollutants in soil to earthworms, it is necessary that the contribution of each pathway is known. Lumbricus rubellus were sealed by means of medical histoacryl glue, to block ingestion of soil particles and pore water. For 6 d, these earthworms showed good survival and vitality and no soil ingestion was found. Equal metal uptake was found by sealed and unsealed earthworms exposed to an inert sand matrix continuously flushed with contaminated water. Therefore, pore water uptake via ingestion contributes little to metal accumulation. Uptake rates of Cd, Cu and Pb in sealed and unsealed earthworms exposed to two contaminated field soils were similar. Uptake and elimination kinetics of Zn were significantly lower in sealed earthworms exposed to one of the two field soils. Body concentrations of Cu and Pb could be completely attributed to the <b>dermal</b> <b>route.</b> For internal Cd and Zn concentrations, however, 0 - 17 and 21 - 30 %, respectively, were derived from ingestion. It is concluded that for metals the <b>dermal</b> <b>route</b> is the uptake route of importance.
