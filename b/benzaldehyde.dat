25|$|A {{significant}} quantity of natural <b>benzaldehyde</b> is produced from cinnamaldehyde obtained from cassia oil by the retro-aldol reaction: the cinnamaldehyde is refluxed in an aqueous/alcoholic solution between 90°C and 150°C with a base (most commonly sodium carbonate or bicarbonate) for 5 to 80 hours, followed by distillation of the formed <b>benzaldehyde.</b> This reaction also yields acetaldehyde.

40|$|Both aidehyde oxidase and {{xanthine}} oxidase catalyze the oxidation {{of a wide}} range of N-heterocycles and aldehydes. These enzymes are important in the oxidation of N-heterocyclic xenobiotics, whereas their role in the oxidation of xenobiotic aldehydes is usually ignored. The present investigation describes the interaction of methyl- and nitrosubstituted <b>benzaldehydes,</b> in the ortho-, meta- and parapositions, with guinea pig liver aldehyde oxidase and bovine milk {{xanthine oxidase}}. The kinetic constants showed that most substituted <b>benzaldehydes</b> are excellent substrates of aldehyde oxidase with lower affinities for xanthine oxidase. Low K-m values for aldehyde oxidase were observed with most <b>benzaldehydes</b> tested, with 3 -nitrobenzaldehyde having the lowest K-m value and 3 -methylbenzaldehyde being the best substrate in terms of substrate efficiency (K-s). Additionally, low K-m values for xanthine oxidase were found with most <b>benzaldehydes</b> tested. However, all <b>benzaldehydes</b> also had low V-max values, which made them poor substrates of xanthine oxidase. It is therefore possible that aldehyde oxidase may be critical in the oxidation of xenobiotic and endobiotic derived aldehydes and its role in such reactions should not be ignored...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Disruption of {{cellular}} antioxidation systems {{should be an}} effective method for control of fungal pathogens. Such disruption can be achieved with redox-active compounds. Natural phenolic compounds can serve as potent redox cyclers that inhibit microbial growth through destabilization {{of cellular}} redox homeostasis and/or antioxidation systems. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify <b>benzaldehydes</b> that disrupt the fungal antioxidation system. These compounds could then function as chemosensitizing agents in concert with conventional drugs or fungicides to improve antifungal efficacy. Methods <b>Benzaldehydes</b> were tested as natural antifungal agents against strains of Aspergillus fumigatus, A. flavus, A. terreus and Penicillium expansum, fungi that are causative agents of human invasive aspergillosis and/or are mycotoxigenic. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was also used as a model system for identifying gene targets of <b>benzaldehydes.</b> The efficacy of screened compounds as effective chemosensitizers or as antifungal agents in formulations was tested with methods outlined by the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). Results Several <b>benzaldehydes</b> are identified having potent antifungal activity. Structure-activity analysis reveals that antifungal activity increases by the presence of an ortho -hydroxyl group in the aromatic ring. Use of deletion mutants in the oxidative stress-response pathway of S. cerevisiae (sod 1 Δ, sod 2 Δ, glr 1 Δ) and two mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) mutants of A. fumigatus (sakA Δ, mpkC Δ), indicates antifungal activity of the <b>benzaldehydes</b> is through disruption of cellular antioxidation. Certain <b>benzaldehydes,</b> in combination with phenylpyrroles, overcome tolerance of A. fumigatus MAPK mutants to this agent and/or increase sensitivity of fungal pathogens to mitochondrial respiration inhibitory agents. Synergistic chemosensitization greatly lowers minimum inhibitory (MIC) or fungicidal (MFC) concentrations. Effective inhibition of fungal growth can also be achieved using combinations of these <b>benzaldehydes.</b> Conclusions Natural <b>benzaldehydes</b> targeting cellular antioxidation components of fungi, such as superoxide dismutases, glutathione reductase, etc., effectively inhibit fungal growth. They possess antifungal or chemosensitizing capacity to enhance efficacy of conventional antifungal agents. Chemosensitization can reduce costs, abate resistance, and alleviate negative side effects associated with current antifungal treatments. </p...|$|R

25|$|Although {{pseudoephedrine}} occurs naturally as an alkaloid {{in certain}} plant species (for example, as a constituent of extracts from the Ephedra species, {{also known as}} ma huang, in which it occurs together with other isomers of ephedrine), the majority of pseudoephedrine produced for commercial use is derived from yeast fermentation of dextrose {{in the presence of}} <b>benzaldehyde.</b> In this process, specialized strains of yeast (typically a variety of Candida utilis or Saccharomyces cerevisiae) are added to large vats containing water, dextrose and the enzyme pyruvate decarboxylase (such as found in beets and other plants). After the yeast has begun fermenting the dextrose, the <b>benzaldehyde</b> is added to the vats, and in this environment the yeast converts the ingredients to the precursor l-phenylacetylcarbinol (L-PAC).
