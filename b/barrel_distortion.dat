5|$|The lens {{exhibits}} significant distortion {{in keeping}} with the problems of wide-angle lenses. The complex <b>barrel</b> <b>distortion</b> is approximately 2.9% at 8mm focal length but is fairly insignificant as the focal length is raised above 12mm, according to Photozone.de. PC Magazine reports 3.1% distortion at 8mm and 0.7% at 12mm. It also reports that distortion switches to pincushion distortion of 1.4% at 16mm. SLAR Gear reports that the point of convergence between barrel and pincushion is about 13mm. Foreground subjects seem abnormally large compared to similar background subjects with this lens.|$|E
5|$|Stanton {{also wanted}} the {{lighting}} to look realistic and evoke the science fiction films of his youth. He thought that Pixar captured {{the physics of}} being underwater with Finding Nemo and so for WALL-E, he wanted to push that for air. While rewatching some of his favorite science fiction films, he realized that Pixar's other movies had lacked the look of 70 mm film and its <b>barrel</b> <b>distortion,</b> lens flare, and racking focus. Producer Jim Morris invited Roger Deakins and Dennis Muren to advise on lighting and atmosphere. Muren spent several months with Pixar, while Deakins hosted one talk and was requested to stay on for another two weeks. Stanton said Muren's experience came from integrating computer animation into live-action settings, while Deakins helped them understand not to overly complicate their camerawork and lighting. 1970s Panavision cameras were used to help the animators understand and replicate handheld imperfections like unfocused backgrounds in digital environments. The first lighting test included building a three-dimensional replica of WALL-E, filming it with a 70mm camera, {{and then trying to}} replicate that in the computer. Stanton cited the shallow lens work of Gus Van Sant's films as an influence, as it created intimacy in each close-up. Stanton chose angles for the virtual cameras that a live-action filmmaker would choose if filming on a set.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we show that}} radial {{distortion}} of images invalidates the geometric constraint on which self-calibration of a rotating camera is based - that 3 D lines drawn between matched features all intersect at the rotation centre. We develop a geometric picture showing how radial distortion violates this constraint and discuss the implications for self-calibration of a rotating camera. In particular we show that the behaviour of self-calibration is markedly different for pin-cushion and <b>barrelling</b> <b>distortion,</b> the latter causing self-calibration to be unreliable or to fail completely. A method is presented for automatically estimating the radial distortion over a sequence of images, when both distortion and camera internal parameters vary. We discuss when such an approach will work and whether accurate automatic calibration of a rotating camera is really possible. Keywords: self-calibration, radial distortion © 2000 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{the field}} of {{computer}} aided celiac disease diagnosis, wide-angle endoscopy lenses are employed which introduce significant <b>barrel</b> type <b>distortions.</b> Although the images can be rectified using distortion correction methods, computer based diagnosis suffers from missing information in highly distorted image regions. First, we investigate the impact of simple and advanced interpolation techniques on the classification rates. Furthermore we explore the effect of considering different image resolutions. Whereas in previous studies distortion correction in most cases {{turned out to be}} disadvantageous, we show that for certain setups distortion correction definitely is advantageous...|$|R
50|$|Among {{standard}} zoom lenses, it {{is known}} for very good contrast and sharpness and for its extremely low chromatic aberration and <b>barrel</b> <b>distortion.</b> It has a metal body and neutral color rendition.

Like many other zoom lenses, it exhibits some <b>barrel</b> <b>distortion</b> at the wide end of its range.|$|E
50|$|Note that if {{the center}} of the image is closer than the edges (for example, a straight-on shot of a face), then <b>barrel</b> <b>distortion</b> and {{wide-angle}} distortion (taking the shot from close) both increase the size of the center, while pincushion distortion and telephoto distortion (taking the shot from far) both decrease the size of the center. However, radial distortion bends straight lines (out or in), while perspective distortion does not bend lines, and these are distinct phenomena. Fisheye lenses are wide-angle lenses with heavy <b>barrel</b> <b>distortion</b> and thus exhibit both these phenomena, so objects in {{the center of the}} image (if shot from a short distance) are particularly enlarged: even if the <b>barrel</b> <b>distortion</b> is corrected, the resulting image is still from a wide-angle lens, and will still have a wide-angle perspective.|$|E

40|$|Introduction Many {{inexpensive}} camera lenses, especially zoom lenses, {{suffer from}} very clear distortion.

See Figures 9 [...] 12 for reallife examples. The most typical cases of <b>distortion,</b> <b>barrel</b> and pincushion <b>distortion,</b> are illustrated in Figures 1 and 2. In practice the distortion is often more complicated, a combination of both of these cases, Figure 3. Background In both the object and film planes we use radial coordinates so that the origin is {{at the point where the}} optical axis meets the plane. The distance r in the planes is normalized so that in both planes r = 1 corresponds to the corners of the object or the image. The lens mapping L(r) is used to describe how a lens distorts an image.

50|$|In the <b>Distortions</b> filter, <b>barrel</b> or pincushion <b>distortion</b> can be controlled, {{horizontal}} and vertical perspective may be changed, the image may be stretched and squeezed, the image may be skewed, h-bend can be controlled, and vignetting can be corrected. This feature is especially useful for photographs taken with a wide-angle lens, as this often produces distorted images. Complete image flips and rotations of varying degrees may also be done.|$|R

50|$|In photography, a {{rectilinear}} lens is {{a photographic}} lens that yields images where straight features, {{such as the}} walls of buildings, appear with straight lines, {{as opposed to being}} curved. In other words, it is a lens with little or no <b>barrel</b> or pincushion <b>distortion.</b> At particularly wide angles, however, the rectilinear perspective will cause objects to appear increasingly stretched and enlarged as they {{near the edge of the}} frame. These types of lenses are often used to create forced perspective effects.|$|R
50|$|Modern fire-control computers, {{like all}} {{high-performance}} computers, are digital. The added performance allows basically any input to be added, from air density and wind, {{to wear on}} the <b>barrels</b> and <b>distortion</b> due to heating. These sorts of effects are noticeable for any sort of gun, and fire-control computers have started appearing on smaller and smaller platforms. Tanks were one early use that automated gun laying using a laser rangefinder and a barrel-distortion meter. Fire-control computers are not just useful for large cannons. They {{can be used to}} aim machine guns, small cannons, guided missiles, rifles, grenades, rockets—any kind of weapon that can have its launch or firing parameters varied. They are typically installed on ships, submarines, aircraft, tanks and even on some small arms—for example, the grenade launcher developed for use on the Fabrique Nationale F2000 bullpup assault rifle. Fire-control computers have gone through all the stages of technology that computers have, with some designs based upon analogue technology and later vacuum tubes which were later replaced with transistors.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{methods of}} {{automatically}} calibrating the intrinsic parameters of cameras undergoing pure rotation {{are based on}} the infinite homography constraint, and {{have been found to be}} sensitive to radial distortion in the imagery. This paper develops a straightforward argument based on geometrical optics to show that increasing pin-cushion radial distortion will produce a gently worsening underestimate of the lens' focal length, whereas increasing <b>barrel</b> radial <b>distortion</b> will produce a more sharply increasing overestimate followed by failure of the calibration. A second geometrical argument uses the approximation of a barrel-distorted image to a spherical projection to estimate the degree of distortion at which breakdown is likely to occur. The predictions are verified experimentally using data from real scenes with varying degrees of distortion and noise added. The paper also considers four methods of correcting the radial distortion within self-calibration. The first method pre-calibrates the distortion as a function of focal length, but the remainder assume no such prior knowledge. Although these prior-less methods are successful to an extent, everyday scenes are unlikely to provide image feature data of sufficient density and quality to make them fully viable. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Minimizing camera {{distortion}} {{has been}} a focus of recent photorealism researches. Of the several types of camera distortions, researchers concentrated on the radial distortion being the most severe part of the total lens aberrations. Often, polynomial approximations by introducing distortion-specific parameters into the camera model have been methods of evaluating distortions. Of {{the two types of}} radial <b>distortions,</b> <b>barrel,</b> is the most discussed probably because of its dominance in cheap wide-angle lenses. In this paper, an approach to estimating and minimizing pincushion distortion by using fundamental surface area properties of the distorted image is proposed. This paper is significant as it reveals the importance of the topic and its implications on the camera. Demonstrations using four camera lenses show the robustness of this technique under different focal lengths conditions. The reliability of the approach is justified by comparing the results with the physical observations using (two tailed) t-test statistic...|$|R
40|$|We {{address the}} issue of {{creating}} stereo imagery on a screen that, when viewed by naked human eyes, will be indistinguishable from the original scene as viewed through a visual accessory. In doing so we investigate effects that appear because real optical systems are not ideal. Namely, we consider optical systems that are not free from geometric aberrations. We present an analysis and confirming computational experiments of the simulations of stereoscopic optical accessories in the presence of aberrations. We describe an accessory in the framework of the Seidel-Schwarzschild theory. That means that we represent its deviation from an ideal (Gaussian) device by means of five constants. Correspondingly, we are able to simulate five fundamental types of monochromatic geometric aberrations: spherical aberration, coma, astigmatism, curvature-of-field, and <b>distortion</b> (<b>barrel</b> and pincushion).
