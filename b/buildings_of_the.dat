5|$|In {{contrast}} to the <b>buildings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early Badami Chalukyas, whose monuments were clustered around the metropoleis of Pattadakal, Aihole, and Badami, these Western Chalukya temples are widely dispersed, reflecting a system of local government and decentralisation.

5|$|The term Regency {{architecture}} refers {{primarily to}} <b>buildings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early 19th century, when GeorgeIV was still Prince Regent, {{and also to}} later <b>buildings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Victorian period which were designed in the same style. It follows closely on from the neo-classical Georgian style of architecture, adding an elegance and lightness of touch. Many buildings in the Regency style have a white painted stucco facade and an entryway to the main front door—usually coloured black—framed by two columns. Regency houses were typically built as terraces or crescents, often in a setting of trees and shrubs. Elegant wrought iron balconies and bow windows were also fashionable. An instigator of this style was John Nash, whose most notable work in Bristol is Blaise Hamlet, a complex of small cottages surrounding a green. It was built around 1811, for the retired employees of Quaker banker and philanthropist John Scandrett Harford, who owned Blaise Castle House. The cottages are now owned by the National Trust.|$|E

5|$|After the Russian Revolution, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic's capital {{moved from}} Kharkiv to Kiev in 1934, {{and the city}} {{was in need of}} a {{suburban}} residence for government officials. Mezhyhirya was chosen as the site of the new government residence. The decision of the Politburo in April 1935 ordered the demolition of the whole complex. Before the scheduled demolition in 1936, the architecture and <b>buildings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monastic complex were photographed. During the demolition, an underground library was discovered, full of handwritten manuscripts. There are speculations that the discovered books belonged to the lost library of Yaroslav the Wise, or perhaps of a later period, during the times of the Zaporozhian Host. The only thing that remains now of the monastic complex is a water well.|$|E
50|$|Most {{buildings}} Eberhardt designed were {{public buildings}} or luxurious mansions. In Offenbach survived three buildings: <b>the</b> office <b>building</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Heyne factory, the AOK insurance and <b>the</b> main <b>building</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HfG Offenbach.|$|R

5|$|After the war, {{the city}} {{underwent}} {{a process of}} urban renewal and expansion from the 1890s up to the 1920s. As downtown Lima had become overcrowded, the La Victoria residential area was established in 1896 as a working-class neighborhood. During this period the urban layout was modified by the construction of big avenues which crisscrossed the city and connected it with neighboring towns such as Miraflores. In the 1920s and 1930s, several <b>buildings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> historic centre were rebuilt including the Government Palace and the Municipal Palace.|$|E
5|$|All the <b>buildings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> University in Sampaloc {{with the}} {{exception}} of the Seminary, the Printing Press and two first floors of Main Building were occupied. The war internees occupied three floors of the Main Building, the entire Education Building (presently UST Hospital), the Domestic Science building, and the School of Mines building. Communication between them and the outside world was prevented by the Japanese as much as possible.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} 110-floor Twin Towers, {{numerous}} other buildings at the World Trade Center site were destroyed or badly damaged, including WTC buildings 3 through 7 and St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church. The North Tower, South Tower, the Marriott Hotel (3WTC), and 7WTC were completely destroyed. The U.S. Customs House (6 World Trade Center), 4 World Trade Center, 5 World Trade Center, and both pedestrian bridges connecting buildings were severely damaged. The Deutsche Bank Building on 130 Liberty Street was partially damaged and demolished some years later, starting in 2007. The two <b>buildings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> World Financial Center also suffered damage.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the participatory processes {{which led to}} <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Berg River Dam in South Africa’s Western Cape province. The government-led formal participatory processes stand in contrast to <b>the</b> mobilisation <b>of</b> environmental activists against <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dam. In this case, <b>the</b> creation <b>of</b> formal participatory forums both subverted and neutralised resistance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> environmental movement and civil society against <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dam, largely through <b>the</b> mobilisation <b>of</b> policy discourses on water ‘scarcity’...|$|R

5|$|Although the LNC {{proposed}} {{to convert the}} cemetery branch line into a grand avenue running from Brookwood station through the cemetery, this never took place. The rails and sleepers of the branch were removed in around 1947, and the trackbed became a dirt road and footpath. The run-around loop and stub of the branch line west of Brookwood station remained operational as sidings, before being dismantled on 30 November 1964. After {{the closure of the}} branch line the <b>buildings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two cemetery stations remained open as refreshment kiosks, and were renamed North Bar and South Bar.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} early days of Sicilian Baroque, the first <b>buildings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new neoclassical era were often copies or hybrids of the two styles. The Palazzo Ducezio (Illustration 19) was begun in 1746, and the ground floor with arcades {{creating}} play of light and shadow is pure Baroque. However, when a few years later the upper floor was added, despite the use of Baroque broken pediments above the windows, the neoclassical French influence is very pronounced, highlighted by the central curved bay. The Sicilian Baroque was gradually and slowly being superseded by French neoclassicism.|$|E
5|$|At its {{session of}} 23 November 2006, the {{planning}} {{committee of the}} city council charged its staff with examining how the Altes Stadthaus could be used for large-scale retail without damaging it as an architectural landmark. The report, which was presented at the end of December, recommended reuse of the already modified internal space housing the library, and creation of additional usable space up to a total of approximately 1600m². This could be done by lowering the floor to street level and modifying stairway areas without changing the external appearance of the building, which is characteristic of government <b>buildings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1920s, particularly in its blocky ground floor. Changes to the upper floors, which remained largely in their original condition, were not recommended.|$|E
