40|$|The present paper {{examines}} and {{evaluates the}} results of a survey carried out to define the criteria for restoring the surface water of the karstic stream "Gravina" (Southern-Italy). The stream runs through a watershed including several agricultural areas. The stream shows an environmental heterogeneity which is of great value to the conservation of biodiversity. The analysis supports a more general water pollution control strategy aimed at safeguarding natural water quality in the urbanized watershed with the aim, also, to reuse partially the water in agriculture. The methodology was based on the surface water sampling, quality parameter analysis and simulation by modelling. The variation and compatibility of wastewater discharge and water stream quality were verified by using a model available in literature in function of <b>biodegradable</b> <b>pollutant</b> load and dissolved oxygen. Several scenarios based on the fixed yield of treatment plants were examined...|$|E
40|$|In-situ {{bioremediation}} is a technology, {{which has}} recently gained {{the attention of}} specialists for the clean-up of hydrocarbons. Organic chemicals are persistent and hard to deal with, because they are usually present in three forms: dissolved into groundwater, as free product over the groundwater surface, and adsorbed onto soil particles. The requirements for the bioremediation process to occur are the availability of microorganisms, a <b>biodegradable</b> <b>pollutant,</b> an electron acceptor, and nutrients. The shortage of nutrients in an available form for the microorganisms is very often a limiting factor for successful bioremediation in-situ. The main difficulties for the supply of nutrients usually come from the low permeability of soils. The feasibility of the application of electrokinetic processes, and, more specifically, the induced electroosmotic flow, for achievement of uniform distribution of nutrients for in-situ bioremediation in a natural clayey silt was investigated. Three different concentrations of ammonium nitrate solution were used. The experiment showed {{the efficiency of the}} electrokinetic method for supplying nutrients in a low permeability soil, especially for distribution of solutions with intermediate (1000 mg/L) concentrations. An advantage of the method is the prevention of the leaching of nitrates through the controlled electroosmotic flow...|$|E
40|$|Natural {{organic matter}} (NOM) present in {{terrestrial}} waters and soil {{is known to}} contain light-absorbing species capable of promoting photochemical reactions that are considered as the major abiotic pathway {{for the removal of}} xenobiotics from natural waters. Recently {{it has been shown that}} soluble bio-based substances (SBO) isolated from urban biowastes (UBW) have similar chemical composition and photosensitizing properties as NOM. Since SBO may be obtained from easily available cost-effective sources, their performances as organic photocatalysts have been recently considered and encouraging results have been obtained. Moreover the use of urban wastes as source of bio-based photocatalysts is rather appealing in the context of the current issues of waste management. The present work aims to optimize the photodegradation promoted by SBO of 4 -chlorophenol, a priority toxic and hardly <b>biodegradable</b> <b>pollutant.</b> Many aspects of the process have been investigated at the laboratory scale using simulated solar light: the effect of SBO concentration, the operative pH, the degradation mechanism, the main reactive species involved and the toxicity evolution. Moreover the effect of added hydrogen peroxide on 4 -chlorophenol degradation rate has been considered, since the presence of iron inside SBO structure let envisage synergistic Fenton-like processes; at this purpose design of experiments (DOE) was choosen as methodologic approach to evaluate the influence of irradiation wavelength, hydrogen peroxide, substrate and SBO concentration on the degradation of 4 -chlorophenol. Finally the potential of the SBO-based photochemical process to be feasibly scaled up has been evaluated using a pilot plant working under real sunlight irradiatio...|$|E

30|$|Sewage {{treatment}} processes can {{be classified}} as primary and secondary processes. In primary treatment, solids are mainly removed mechanically from untreated sewage. Secondary treatment is a biological process in which decomposers are utilized to remove <b>biodegradable</b> <b>pollutants.</b> Decomposers are organisms such bacteria and fungi that get energy and nutrients by digesting waste matter in the sewage. In the activated sludge process, sewage is pumped into a large tank where aerobic microorganisms decompose the organic matter (WHO 2002). Chemical treatment is sometimes used and it encourages small particles and dissolved substances to form large particles which facilitate separation. This is called chemical precipitation. Sludge is formed when these larger particles clump together during suitable separation methods (Casey 1997).|$|R
40|$|Advanced Oxidation Techniques {{represent}} {{an alternative to}} more traditional water treatments since {{they are able to}} promote the degradation of organic substrates, leading to their complete mineralization. These processes are based on the production of highly reactive species (mainly radicals) and are often light assisted. Among the compounds able to photogenerate reactive species, humic and fulvic acids (HS) have been widely studied {{in order to understand the}} water autopurification mechanisms. It is thus in principle possible to propose the use of HS in wastewater photodegradation treatments; however neither waters nor soils can be considered as exploitable source of HS. The organic fraction of urban wastes has been demonstrated to be an interesting source of soluble organic substances (SOS), structurally similar to HS and exhibiting good photosensitizing properties. In the present research the photodegradation of 4 -chlorophenol (4 -CP), a toxic and hardly <b>biodegradable</b> <b>pollutant,</b> has been studied in the presence of one type of SOS. In order to optimize experimental conditions and to evaluate possible synergistic effects with other photoactive compounds (TiO 2 and H 2 O 2) a chemometric approach has been chosen. Two designs of experiments (D-Optimal, DoE) have been planned and the following parameters have been considered: 4 -CP concentration (from 10 to 100 mg L- 1), SOS concentration (from 0 to 1000 mg L- 1), TiO 2 concentration (from 0 to 500 mg L- 1) or H 2 O 2 concentration (from 0 to 10 - 2 M), cut-off filter for the light source (340 nm, 400 nm and without filter). By mean of the Modde software, 39 experiments were selected for the TiO 2 -DoE and 25 experiments for the H 2 O 2 -DoE. The resulting response surfaces evidenced that, in the presence of TiO 2, a competition for the active photogenerated species seems to take place between 4 -CP and SOS, since also SOS can be in turn photodegraded. On the contrary, a synergistic effect between SOS and H 2 O 2 occurs, when the 400 nm cut-off filter is used. After three hours of irradiation 25 % of 4 -CP abatement was achieved in the presence of 500 mg L- 1 of SOS, 35 % was achieved in the presence of 5 mM of H 2 O 2, whereas 45 % of 4 -CP abatement was obtained in the presence of both SOS and H 2 O 2 at the above mentioned concentrations. These results encourage the use of chemometric tools and give useful information for a possible scale-up of the process in pilot plants exploiting the solar light as radiation sourc...|$|E

30|$|Considering {{the poor}} biodegradability, high salt {{concentration}} {{and complexity of}} oxidized modified starch wastewater, a combination process of micro electrolysis, two-phase anaerobic, aerobic and electrolysis was designed and a micro-electrolysis anaerobic two-phase reactor was developed. Effective control of the reaction conditions was necessary to avoid the inhibition of high salt to the processes. Hazardous materials and pollutants with poor biodegradability can be eliminated by the preset micro electrolysis (Huang et al. 2013) and the ratio of BOD/COD can be greatly improved so that microorganism activity is not restrained by hazardous materials in the wastewater (Li et al. 2010; Tao and Kang 2014). Other organic pollutants, ammonia nitrogen, and <b>biodegradable</b> <b>pollutants</b> can be removed by anaerobic and aerobic biological treatment (Abou-Elela et al. 2010; Shi et al. 2014).

This sensor needs 5 min for every measurement instead of 5 days for BOD 5. The sensor has a linear response of up to 550 mg L- 1 BOD with a correlation of coefficient R- 2 = 0. 9785. The detection limit was calculated to be 2. 1 mg L- 1 BOD equivalents, and the determination limit was 6. 0 mg L- 1 BOD equivalents. The high tolerance to salt of the Arxula adeninivorans LS 3 strain prevents the inactivation of cells caused by the seawater from affecting the measurements. In a 24 -hour comparative study using real wastewater samples from an international college situated in Hong Kong, the microbial sensor showed a very good correlation (R- 2 = 0. 9134) with the standard BOD 5 method and truly reflected the `life cycle' of the college people.

The investigation was performed during periods of high (May, 2002) and low (October, 2002) water conditions. Meio- and macrozoobenthos were observed. Qualitative, quantitative, and saprobiological analyses were performed. The sampling area covered five stations along 66 km of the river. The community was represented by 26 species. Aquatic worms were the principal component of the benthos with respect to both species richness (six species) and abundance (58. 39 - 99. 47 % of the total community). Gastropods were also diverse (six species). Snails were found to be subdominant as far as participation in the total community density is concerned. Structure of the benthic community and the saprobity index (S = 2. 78 - 3. 43) indicated the presence of organic pollution. No notable differences of estimated environmental quality were observed between a station upstream from Belgrade and one situated below the exit from the broader territory of Belgrade.

40|$|Many {{industrial}} processes, {{particularly in}} the food industry, produce slurries or wastewaters containing high concentrations of biodegradable organic materials. Before these contaminated wastewaters can be discharged the concentration of the <b>biodegradable</b> organic <b>pollutant</b> must be reduced. One {{way to do this}} is to pass the wastewater through a bioreactor containing biomass which grows through consumption of the pollutant. Anaerobic conditions are often favoured for the processing of waste materials with high levels of <b>biodegradable</b> organic <b>pollutants</b> as these can be removed with low investment and operational costs.

For instance, the unit can be placed after the first reactor and recycle back to the feed stream of the reactor. Alternatively, the unit can be placed after the second reactor and recycle back to the feed stream of this reactor. Finally, the settling unit can be placed after the second reactor and recycle back to the feed stream of the first reactor.

40|$|Biological {{techniques}} are highly cost-effective {{for the treatment}} of off-gases containing low concentrations of pollutants (< 5 g/m 3). They may also be attractive for the elimination of higher concentrations of explosive hydrocarbons (when compared to incineration). Conventional techniques such as biofilters have low elimination capacities for hydrophobic compounds caused by a poor mass transfer from the gas to the aqueous phase. To overcome solubility problems, a novel biotrickling filter was developed and is characterized by the use of an organic solvent. In such a biotrickling filter, a mixture of an organic solvent and water is continuously trickled over a packed bed, while the polluted gas passes counter-current to the liquid. The microorganisms exist on the packing material in the calculating liquid. The alkanes are absorbed in the oil phase of the liquid, transferred to the microorganisms and biodegraded. Laboratory-scale experiments at 20 l scale with hexane as a model pollutant and silicon oil as a solvent revealed that a 90 % elimination efficiency can be reached at a volumetric loading rate of 100 g hexane per m 3 filterbed per hour. The influent gas contained 10 g hexane per m 3 and had a temperature of 29 °C.

40|$|Abstract: Aquifer {{management}} {{is a complex}} problem in which various aspects {{should be taken into}} account. Specifically, there are conflicting objectives that should be achieved. On one side, there is the necessity to satisfy the water demand, on the other the resource water should be protected by infiltration of pollutants or substances that could reduce its availability in terms of short term and long term management. The aim {{of this paper is to}} develop a management model that is able to define the optimal pumping pattern for p (p= 1,…,P) wells that withdraw water from an aquifer (characterized by pollutant contamination) and hydraulically interact, with the objectives of satisfying an expressed water demand and control pollution. In order to formalize and solve the management problem, it is necessary to consider the equations governing flow and mass transport of the <b>biodegradable</b> <b>pollutants</b> characterizing the aquifer. Such equations may be solved by using a finite-difference numerical scheme. In this work, the numerical scheme is embedded in the management model. The decision (control) variables that are considered in the optimisation problems are the water flows pumped at each well p, at time interval t. Such flows influence the state variables of the system, that is, the hydraulic head and the pollutant concentrations in the aquifer. The objective function to be minimized in the optimisation problem includes three terms: water demand dissatisfaction, pollutant concentrations in the extracted water, and pollutant concentrations in all cells of the discretized aquifer. Finally, the optimisation problem has been solved for a specific case study (Savona District, Italy), relevant to a confined aquifer affected by nitrate pollution deriving from agriculture activities...|$|R
40|$|With {{gradually}} increasing strict {{environmental regulations}} that control emissions of {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs), reduced sulphur compounds and nuisance odors from industries, {{there is a growing}} need for air pollution control systems. Biofiltration systems have been widely used in the treatment of odorous and toxic volatile organic compounds. As compared to traditional physical and chemical systems, biofilteration is cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and highly efficient for many <b>biodegradable</b> <b>pollutants.</b> The biofilter concept is about using microorganisms to metabolize the variety of contaminants such as volatile organic compounds, reduced sulphur compounds and hydrocarbons. Although the biofilters are designed to eliminate pollutants with greater than 90 % efficiency, accidental releases do occur due to biofilter failures; hence, this poses serious threats to health, especially to those who live in the vicinity of biofilter locations. This research investigates the dispersion of air pollutants that are accidentally released from industrial biofilters. Two commercial biofilters that were installed in different industrial sites, located in (Hickson) and (Toronto), Ontario, Canada, were used as test cases. A mathematical (Gaussian) dispersion model, a screening model (SCREEN 3), and a non-steady state Lagrangian California Puff Model (CALPUFF), were used at different biofilter removal efficiencies to predict pollutant concentrations, dispersion and health effects, and to examine the impacts of topographical and meteorological conditions on concentration of pollutant emissions at receptor locations. The study shows that geographical variations (i. e., flat versus elevated surfaces) of the location of a biofilter {{have an effect on the}} wind, and hence on pollutant dispersion. The results confirmed that the iii wind direction has a direct impact on the pollutant plume path, whereas the wind speed and atmospheric stability class influence the pollutant concentration. The results elucidated that the high concentration of pollutants due to low removal efficiency of a biofilter can cause serious health problems. The results of this work can be used as a basis to evaluate biofilter performance under various atmospheric and geographical conditions and to improve biofilter design...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAssessing {{the fate}} of {{endocrine}} disrupting compounds (EDCs) in the environment is currently a key issue for determining their impacts on aquatic ecosystems. The 4 -nonylphenol (4 -NP) is a well known EDC and results from the biodegradation of surfactant nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPnEOs). Fate mechanisms of NPnEO are well documented but their rate constants have been mainly determined through laboratory experiments. This study aims at evaluating the in-situ fate of 4 -NP, nonylphenol monoethoxylate (NP 1 EO) and nonylphenolic acetic acid (NP 1 EC). Two sampling campaigns were carried out on the Seine River in July and September 2011, along a 28 km-transect downstream Paris City. The field measurements are used for the calibration of a sub-model of NPnEO fate, included into a hydro-ecological model of the Seine River (ProSe). The timing of the sampling {{is based on the}} Seine River velocity in order to follow a volume of water. Based on our results, in-situ attenuation rate constants of 4 -NP, NP 1 EO and NP 1 EC for both campaigns are evaluated. These rate constants vary greatly. Although the attenuation rate constants in July are especially high (higher than 1 d− 1), those obtained in September are lower and consistent with the literature. This is probably due to the biogeochemical conditions in the Seine River. Indeed, the July sampling campaign took place {{at the end of an}} algal bloom leading to an unusual bacterial biomass while the September campaign was carried out during common biogeochemical status. Finally, the uncertainties on measurements and on the calibration parameters are estimated through a sensitivity analysis. This study provides relevant information regarding {{the fate of}} <b>biodegradable</b> <b>pollutants</b> in an aquatic environment by coupling field measurements and a biogeochemical model.

For the application of these biofilms in new wastewater treatment systems, the engineering aspects need to be investigated to obtain a balanced system where no additional oxygen is required. In this study symbiotic microalgal–bacterial biofilms were grown in flow cells with ammonium and phosphate, and with acetate as <b>biodegradable</b> organic <b>pollutant</b> at a hydraulic retention time of 4. 5 h. The symbiotic biofilms removed acetate from 323 mg/L to 39 mg/L without an external oxygen or carbon dioxide supply at a removal rate of 43 g COD/m 2 /d. Ammonium and phosphate could not be completely removed, but removal rates of 3. 2 g/m 2 /d and 0. 41 g/m 2 /d were obtained, respectively. Further nitrogen removal may be obtained by nitrification and denitrification as the biofilm obtained a considerable heterotrophic denitrification capacity. The symbiotic relationship between microalgae and aerobic heterotrophs was proven by subsequently removing light and acetate. In both cases this resulted in the cessation of the symbiosis and in increasing effluent concentrations of both acetate and the nutrients ammonium and phosphate.

40|$|The {{evolution}} {{of society and}} the growth of cities and economies have led to an increase in the pollution of our water environments. Even though most national and international organizations have set legal limits and ordinances to control water quality and the wastewater discharges, water pollution is still a serious problem and potential hazard to both the environment and humans. Although different methods have been reported for analyzing water quality, time consuming and complicated procedures always delay the immediate control of pollution. Owing to the advantageous features such as rapidness, simplicity and accuracy, biosensor technology has been introduced to fulfill the requirements of rapid analysis. This thesis will demonstrate applications of biosensor technology in the field of environmental monitoring. Construction and the applications of biosensors for the rapid monitoring of four environmental parameters: inorganic phosphate PO 43 -), nitrate (NO 3 -), ammonium (NH 4 +) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) have been successfully achieved. For the measurement of inorganic phosphate (chapter 2), a monoenzyme biosensor employing pyruvate oxidase (PyOD) as a sensing element has been constructed. The measurement is based on the enzymatic generation of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) in the presence of phosphate. The working range of the biosensor was from 7. 5 μM to 625 μM phosphate with a detection limit of 3. 6 μM. For the measurement of nitrate (chapter 3), a bienzyme biosensor employing lactate oxidase (LOD) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as a sensing system for NADH has been constructed. A specific nitrate sensing system has been developed by using NaR, which consumes NADH in correspondence with the concentration of nitrate. The nitrate concentration is inversely proportional to the signal response, which was measured as oxygen consumption at - 600 mV vs. Ag/AgCl. For the system using an immobilized LOD electrode coupled with soluble LDH and NaR, the linear range was from 12. 5 μM to 600 μM nitrate with a detection limit of 12. 4 μM. For the system using immobilized LOD/LDH electrode coupled with soluble NaR, the linear range was from 25 μM to 350 μM nitrate with a detection limit of 13. 6 μM. For the measurement of ammonium (chapter 4), a bienzyme biosensor employing glutamate oxidase (GXD) and glutamate dehydrogenase (GIDH) as sensing elements has been developed. The measurement was based on the enzymatic consumption of dissolved oxygen (DO) in the presence of ammonium. The working range of the biosensor was from 10 μM to 300 μM ammonium with a detection limit of 2. 1 μM. For the measurement of BOD content (chapter 5), a microbial sensor employing the yeast strain Arxula adeninivorans LS 3 has been designed for fast BOD estimation. The yeast, a multi-receptor for various biodegradable substances with high salt tolerance, has been immobilized on a miniaturized Clark-type oxygen electrode for the measurement of instant oxygen consumption caused by the microbial respiration and oxidation of <b>biodegradable</b> <b>pollutants.</b> It has shown a linear response ranging from 17. 2 mg L - 1 to 412. 5 mg L - 1 BOD. The detection limit was calculated to be 10. 5 mg L - 1 BOD. The practical usefulness of these biosensors has been studied by monitoring the nutrient content in samples collected from a sequencing batch reactor (SBR), a wastewater treatment facility, and from an aquarium. They showed good correlations with the commercial testing kits or standard method in their respective sample measurements. For the first time in literature, this work has shown the great potential of biosensors for measuring the most important water pollution parameters. Multi-biosensors in an integrated system may in future monitor biological nutrients for the benefit of environment and people...|$|R
40|$|Membrane Bioreactor (MBR) process {{consists}} of a biological reactor integrated with membranes that combine clarification and filtration of an activated sludge process into a simplified, single step process. The membrane is an absolute barrier to suspended matter and microorganisms and it offers the possibility of operating the system at high {{mixed liquor suspended solids}} (MLSS) concentration. The implication of maintenance of high MLSS are— requirement of a smaller footprint and operation at high solids retention time (SRT) under low F/M ratio, hence, yielding reduced excess sludge. Operating as an MBR allows conventional activated sludge plants to become single step processes, which produce high quality effluent potentially suitable for reuse. Accordingly, over the past decade, submerged MBR processes have experienced unprecedented growth in domestic and municipal wastewater treatment/reuse. Application of MBR technology for industrial wastewater treatment has also gained attention because of the robustness of the process. Theoretically, maintenance of long SRT in MBR is in favor of the retention and development of special microorganisms, which may lead to better removal of refractory organic matter and make the system more robust to load variations and toxic shocks. Although in general MBR exhibits much improved overall treatment of concentrated industrial wastewater as compared to conventional activated sludge process, literature suggests that the conceptual expectation of enhanced biodegradation of hardly biodegradable compounds in MBR does not often come true. Very often the improved removal has been attributed to the adsorption of target compounds on sludge, which implies that further treatment of the periodically withdrawn, toxic compound-laden sludge would be required. Improved biodegradation to certain extent has been reported in a few studies; however the underlying factors leading to such improvement still remains to be elucidated. This chapter provides a comprehensive review of the studies dealing with recalcitrant industrial wastewater treatment by MBR, and casts light on the strategies to achieve enhanced biodegradation of hardly <b>biodegradable</b> industrial <b>pollutants</b> in MBR...|$|R
40|$|An Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket Process used in {{converting}} <b>biodegradable,</b> soluble, organic <b>pollutants</b> {{in industrial}} wastewaters to a directly-burnable biogas composed mainly of methane has been developed, tested, and commercially applied in Holland. Operations on wastewater from {{the processing of}} sugar beets have shown hydraulic retention times of less than 10 hours with reactor loadings of at least 10 Kg COD per m 3 digester volume per day and purification efficiencies exceeding 90 %. Biogas production is {{at a rate of}} about 1 therm (100000 BTU) per 10 Kg COD treated. A moderately sized (1000 m 3) wastewater treatment plant processing the order of 10000 Kg COD per day will, therefore, produce the order of 1000 therms of energy per day while, at the same time, reducing the COD level in the effluent by an order of magnitude. The set of conditions required for efficient operation of this anaerobic process will be discussed. The process is unique in its mixed sludge bed approach allowing for tolerance of swings in Ph (6 - 8) at relatively low temperatures (32 C - 38 C) which can be readily achieved from most wastewater streams with little expenditure of additional energy. Sludge production is remarkably low, only about 5 % of the COD loading, greatly alleviating disposal problems. These characteristics are conducive for the use of the anaerobic process to recover energy from a variety of wastewaters rich in carbohydrate-type substances as produced routinely as a by product of many types of food processing activities...|$|R
