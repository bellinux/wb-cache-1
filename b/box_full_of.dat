5|$|For {{the three}} {{dangerous}} {{days of the}} passage to Alexandria the passengers subsisted on oranges and wine. On board with the Smiths were the novelist Robert Liddell, the Welsh poet Harold Edwards, and their wives– the Smiths shared a cramped cabin with the Edwardses. Mrs. Edwards had brought with her a hat <b>box</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> expensive Parisian hats, which Manning kept placing in the passageway outside the cabin, and from whence Mrs. Edwards kept returning it. The two were not on speaking terms {{by the end of}} the voyage, but Manning had the last word: when Mrs. Edwards later opened her hatbox she found that Manning had crushed the hats with a chamberpot.|$|E

(which he throws over his shoulder in disgust). Towards the end of the video less privileged children are shown crying at their lack of presents before we cut back to the initial child who is surrounded by gifts while Santa Claus is seen in front of a log fire, crucified on a cross. An alternative ending instead features Santa lying on the floor with an arrow through his head.|$|E

In part one we compare the <b>full</b> <b>box</b> spaces <b>of</b> free groups on different numbers of generators. In particular the <b>full</b> <b>box</b> space <b>of</b> a free group F_k is not coarsely equivalent to the <b>full</b> <b>box</b> space <b>of</b> a free group F_d, if d> 8 k+ 10. In part two we compare _fZ^n to the <b>full</b> <b>box</b> spaces <b>of</b> 2 -generated groups. In particular we prove that the <b>full</b> <b>box</b> space <b>of</b> Z^n is not coarsely equivalent to the <b>full</b> <b>box</b> space <b>of</b> any 2 -generated group, if n> 3...|$|R

500|$|In July 2013, Gillard {{signed a}} book deal for her memoirs with Penguin Australia. The autobiography, My Story, was {{published}} in 2014 by Random House. In the book, Gillard reflects on various personal aspects {{of her life and}} career, including her own analysis of the people and key players during the Rudd–Gillard Governments. Senator Nick Xenophon was said to have been [...] "infamously excluded from university for a period as punishment for stuffing a ballot <b>box</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> voting papers he had somehow procured", which was denied by Xenophon. In February 2015, Random House issued a public apology to Xenophon and paid a confidential cash settlement.

Gracie confronts Willard and asks for the samples that her father left in his possession.

50|$|Herman Hollerith {{conceived}} {{the idea that}} data could be represented by either holes punched, or not holes, in paper cards then tabulated by machine.

2500|$|An {{inclined}} plane {{consists of a}} cradle (to hold a barge) or caisson (a <b>box</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> water in which a barge can float) which moves on rails sideways up a slope from one waterway to the other. Since the box is [...] "wet" [...] (filled with water), Archimedes' principle ensures that the caisson always weighs the same, regardless {{of the size of}} boat being carried (or even if it contains only water). This makes for easy counterbalancing by a fixed weight or by a second caisson. The motive power may be steam or hydraulic, or may come from overbalancing the top caisson with extra water from the upper waterway.|$|E
2500|$|Today, jobs {{specialize}} in {{the selling of}} ice cream. The title {{of a person who}} works in this speciality is often called an 'ice cream man', however women also {{specialize in}} the selling of ice cream. People in this line of work often sell ice cream on beaches. On beaches, ice cream is either sold by a person who carries a <b>box</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> ice cream and is called over by people who want the purchase ice cream, or by a person who drives {{up to the top of}} the beach and rings a bell. In the second method, people go up to the top of the beach and purchase ice cream straight from the ice cream seller, who is often in an ice cream van. [...] In Turkey and Australia, ice cream is sometimes sold to beach-goers from small powerboats equipped with chest freezers.|$|E
