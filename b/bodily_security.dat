The Bill of Rights in the Constitution of South Africa sets to ensure rights {{of all of the}} people in South Africa with the democratic values of human dignity, equality and freedom. Furthermore, it calls for the right to freedom and security, including freedom from all forms of violence by either public or private sources and the right to bodily and psychological integrity, including reproduction and <b>bodily</b> <b>security.</b> South Africa {{is also a member of}} the UN Convention for the Elimination of all Discrimination Against Women, where it reported on some issues of sexual violence. It reported about how the Truth and Reconciliation Commission offered a platform for the voices of victims of violence and sexual violence during the Apartheid. It also reported details on the Judicial Authority of South Africa, where the lower courts are responsible for important issues such as sexual assault and family violence.|$|E

The notion of a 2 ̆ 2 legal entitlement 2 ̆ 2 is an expansive one, encompassing such diverse rights {{as the right to}} <b>bodily</b> <b>security,</b> the right to a pollution-free atmosphere, the right to build a house that blocks another 2 ̆ 7 s view, or the right to damage another 2 ̆ 7 s reputation by false accusation. Twenty-five years ago Guido Calabresi and Douglas Melamed distinguished between property rules and liability rules as techniques for protecting entitlements.

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the land reform {{programme}} in South Africa {{as well as on}} broader questions of rural women’s needs. It draws on interviews with 47 key informants, drawn particularly from the NGO sector, carried out in 2002 and 2003. It examines the importance of ‘land’ compared with wider issues such as personal and <b>bodily</b> <b>security.</b> Despite some encouraging state initiatives, most informants felt that poorer rural women remained marginalized within the land reform programme and more generally. Needs for independent income, health, and personal security were emphasised, with secure access to land seen as potentially beneficial although not as strong a priority. However, this should not be ‘read’ as an argument for ignoring the benefits of land rights for women: a rural women’s movement is needed to carry this forward demands both for economic rights and those linked to bodily integrity...|$|E

40|$|With {{population}} ageing, {{there is}} an increased interest in how to promote a good old age. A predominant concept in these discussions is successful ageing, which is mainly based on researchers&#x 2019; definitions. This article aims to explore successful ageing {{from the perspective of}} community-dwelling older people (24 persons aged 77 &#x 2013; 90 years). Individual open interviews were conducted and analysed according to qualitative content analysis. An overarching theme was formulated as &#x 201 C;self-respect through ability to keep fear of frailty at a distance&#x 201 D;. This embraced the content of four categories: &#x 201 C;having sufficient <b>bodily</b> resources for <b>security</b> and opportunities&#x 201 D;, &#x 201 C;structures that promote security and opportunities&#x 201 D;, &#x 201 C;feeling valuable in relation to the outside world&#x 201 D;, and &#x 201 C;choosing gratitude instead of worries&#x 201 D;. Ageing seems to be a dynamic process rather than a static structure and might therefore be susceptible to actions. Paying attention to attitudes and treating the older person with respect, particularly with regard to worries about increasing vulnerability, can lead to better ways of promoting successful ageing...|$|R
40|$|This article {{uses the}} arrest and {{conviction}} of Australian Schapelle Corby (for smuggling drugs into Indonesia) to articulate {{and explore the}} mediation of criminal `events' across borders, bodies and technologies. As such, connections {{are drawn to the}} resurgence of nationalistic and neocolonial discourses within the contexts of globalization and the `war on terror'. Working at the intersections of gender, race, border control and national identity, the Corby phenomenon is taken as a political drama of visuality and nationality that equates <b>bodily</b> <b>security</b> with regional integrity. Thus this article necessarily tracks the persistence of the body of the white female as a unit of currency in the aggressive adherence to historical tropes of nationalism. The mediation of Schapelle's `criminal' body is shown to deploy a corporeal lexicon of terror through which the celebrity prisoner articulates tensions and changes in bilateral relations with Indonesia. 19 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Children have a {{constitutional}} right to bodily integrity. Courts do not hesitate to vindicate that right when children are abused by state actors. Moreover, in at least some cases, a child’s right to bodily integrity applies within the family, giving the child the right to avoid unwanted physical intrusions regardless of the parents’ wishes. Nonetheless, the scope of this right vis-à-vis the parents is unclear; {{the extent to which it}} applies beyond the narrow context of abortion and contraception has been almost entirely unexplored and untheorized. This Article is the first in the legal literature to analyze the constitutional right of minors to bodily integrity within the family by spanning traditionally disparate doctrinal categories such as abortion rights; corporal punishment; medical decisionmaking; and nontherapeutic physical interventions such as tattooing, piercing, and circumcision. However, the constitutional right of minors to bodily integrity raises complex philosophical questions concerning the proper relationship between family and state, as well as difficult doctrinal and theoretical issues concerning the ever-murky idea of state action. This Article canvasses those issues with the ultimate goal of delineating {{a constitutional}} right of <b>bodily</b> <b>security</b> and autonomy for children...|$|E
40|$|From Introduction: Many {{philosophers}} have convincingly {{argued that}} non-human animals {{are worthy of}} direct moral concern for their own sakes and, further, that they are also rights-bearers. 1 Rights protect certain interests and place constraints upon what may be done to an individual {{in the name of}} producing social or personal goods. 2 In the case of humans, these protections and constraints are described by an extensive set of particular rights: rights to bodily integrity, personal and political freedoms, assistance and protection, rights to certain social and economic conditions, and so forth. For animals however, theorists have only recently begun to look beyond the most basic of animal rights, such as life, liberty, and <b>bodily</b> <b>security.</b> In order to move forward, animal rights theorists need to consider what these rights entail; whether non-human animals possess a richer more extensive set of rights; and what these rights demand of moral agents, particularly in cases of non-compliance. One such right that may be possessed by animals is a right to their habitat. Besides being killed for human consumption, one of the greatest threats to non-human animals comes from the loss of their habitats. When humans threaten the habitats of wild animals, they threaten the necessary conditions 3 for life and wellbeing. Determining whether and when non-human animals have rights to their habitats, and how those habitat rights are configured, are therefore important questions to consider. Peer-reviewedPost-prin...|$|E
60|$|The fact is, {{profound}} as {{had been}} the impulses in the evolutionary direction among men of science before Darwin's work appeared at all, immense as were the throes and pangs of labour throughout all Europe which preceded and accompanied its actual birth, when it came at last {{it came to the}} general world of unscientific readers with all the sudden vividness and novelty of a tremendous earthquake. Long predestined, it was yet wholly unexpected. Men at large had known nothing or next to nothing of this colossal but hidden revolutionary force which had been gathering head and energy for so many years unseen within the bowels of the earth; and now that its outer manifestation had actually burst upon them, they felt the solid ground of dogmatic <b>security</b> <b>bodily</b> giving way beneath their feet, and knew not where to turn in their extremity for support. Naturally, it was the theological interest that felt itself at first most forcibly assailed. The first few chapters of Genesis, or rather the belief in their scientific and historical character, already sapped by the revelations of geology, seemed to orthodox defenders to be fatally undermined if the Darwinian hypothesis were once to meet with general recognition. The first resource of menaced orthodoxy is always to deny the alleged facts; the second is to patch up tardily the feeble and hollow modus vivendi of an artificial pact. On this occasion the orthodox acted strictly after their kind: but to their credit it should be added that they yielded gracefully in the long run to the unanimous voice of scientific opinion. Twenty-three years later, when all that was mortal of Charles Darwin was being borne with pomp and pageantry to its last resting-place in Westminster Abbey, enlightened orthodoxy, with generous oblivion, ratified a truce over the dead body of the great leader, and, outgrowing its original dread of naturalistic interpretations, accepted his theory without reserve as 'not necessarily hostile to the main fundamental truths of religion.' Let us render justice to the vanquished in a memorable struggle. Churchmen followed respectfully to the grave with frank and noble inconsistency the honoured remains of the very teacher whom {{less than a quarter of}} a century earlier they had naturally dreaded as loosening the traditional foundations of all accepted religion and morality.|$|R
40|$|Natural gas {{extraction}} in the United States {{in the early}} 21 st century has transformed social, physical, legal and biological landscapes. The technique of hydraulic fracturing, which entails the high-pressure injection into subsurface shale formations of synthetic chemical mixtures, has been viewed by the natural gas industry as a practice of great promise. But there is another side to the story. The {{first half of this}} dissertation explores an innovative scientific approach to studying the possible deleterious impacts on {{human health and the environment}} of the release of chemicals used in {{gas extraction}}. Via participant-observation within a small scientific advocacy organization, The Endocrine Disruption Exchange (TEDX), I follow the development of a database of chemicals used in natural gas extraction, a database that seeks to document not only what these chemicals are (many are proprietary), but also what sorts of bodily and ecological effects these substances may have. I analyze ethnographically how TEDX transformed an information vacuum around fracturing and generated fierce regional and national debates about the public health effects of this activity. The second portion of the dissertation expands TEDX's databasing methodology by reporting on a set of online user-generated databasing and mapping tools developed to interconnect communities encountering the corporate forces and chemical processes animating gas development. Shale gas extraction is an intensive technological practice and requires the delicate calibration of corporate, governmental, and legal apparatuses in order to proceed. The industry operates at county, state, and federal levels, and has in many instances been able to organize regulatory environments suited to rapid and lucrative gas extraction. In the midst of such multi-scalar deterritorializing forces, communities may have little legal or technical recourse if they think that they have been subject to chemical and corporate forces that undermine their financial, <b>bodily,</b> and social <b>security.</b> ExtrAct, a research group I co-founded and directed with artist and technologist Chris Csikszentmihalyi, sought to intervene in these processes by developing a suite of online mapping and databasing tools through which "gas patch" communities could share information, network, study and respond to industry activity across states. Using ExtrAct as an example this dissertation explores how social sciences and the academy at large can invest in developing research tools, methods, and programs designed for non-corporate ends, perhaps redressing in the process the informational and technical imbalances faced by communities dealing with large-scale multinational industries whose infrastructure and impacts are largely invisible to public scrutiny. The dissertation describes one potential method for such engaged scientific and social scientific research: an iterative, ethnographically informed process that I term "STS in Practice.

40|$|Domestic {{violence}} lawmaking intersects global {{human rights}} norms and domestic women 2 ̆ 7 s movements. Domestic violence {{is both a}} global and local phenomenon. The World Bank argues that domestic violence accounts for one in five lost years in women aged 15 - 44. The costs range from direct expenses such as medical care and social services to productivity and labor market costs to the psychological toll imposed by the intergenerational transmission of violence. The international women 2 ̆ 7 s movement and the international human rights conventions have confirmed that violence in the home is neither a private issue nor a cultural practice. Domestic violence {{was placed on the}} global agenda as a global epidemic largely due to an explosion of activism by women 2 ̆ 7 s rights activists. Bolstered by increasing pressure from international women 2 ̆ 7 s human rights advocates, domestic movements demanded the governments make domestic violence lawmaking central to good governance. The explosion of lawmaking around the world on domestic violence makes this clear by establishing state accountability for violence in the home. The positive responsibility of the state inherent in human rights treaties therefore required states to take positive measures to end domestic violence. The concept of state responsibility to include accountability for acts of private individuals {{is an integral part of}} the definition of domestic violence as a human rights violation. The concept of state responsibility has expanded to not only direct state action but also a state 2 ̆ 7 s systematic failure to act. Despite the weak enforcement of these laws, the law making processes provide women 2 ̆ 7 s movements an opportunity to network globally. The transformation of international human rights and transnational idea sharing into domestic violence lawmaking has been defined as one of the most important social movements of our times. Although much more must be done to realize the promise of these laws, countries that are in the process of lawmaking have much to learn from these experiences. In the last decade, many countries in the Asian region have either passed or are in the process of passing national domestic violence laws. Despite the fact that the laws in force are yet to be transformed fully into practice these laws are important benchmarks and integrate some novel elements in domestic violence lawmaking. Although there is little homogeneity in the Asian region in the field of political, economic, social, or cultural development, these laws have the transformative potential to create new standards in an area where women victims of violence are often silenced because of a culture of impunity. The existence of a law provides space for women to claim their right to <b>bodily</b> integrity and <b>security.</b> Many elements of these laws in different parts of Asia are also instructive to other jurisdictions and can resonate between and across the Asian region...|$|R
40|$|Dear Ronny, In {{the course}} of {{preparing}} the Cooley lectures for the University of Michigan I had occasion to read your exchange with Dick Posner which clustered around the Cornell-Chicago conference of this April and May and which, I take it, will {{be the basis of}} both your and his contributions to the Hofstra Law Review symposium. Despite the perhaps unnecessarily provocative language in your first article, language which I fear will lead some to misunderstand the piece to mean that efficiency in the production of wealth is irrelevant to a 2 ̆ 2 just 2 ̆ 2 society, I found myself substantially in agreement with it. If I may oversimplify your fuller and more complex discussion, {{it seems to me that}} you make two points that are hard to challenge. (Indeed, I think I may have made them myself from time to time, though certainly not as systematically.) : (1) That without starting points—whether termed rights, entitlements, <b>bodily</b> <b>security,</b> or what have you—it is hard to give any meaning to the term 2 ̆ 2 an increase in wealth. 2 ̆ 2 What is viewed as wealth, at the very least, must depend on the desires of individuals. Since these desires in turn depend on the characteristics of individuals, one must, at a minimum, justify in terms other than wealth maximization why a person 2 ̆ 2 owns, 2 ̆ 2 rather than just possesses, the characteristics that give rise to his or her desires. In a way, this is merely a more general way of stating that my superior intelligence, my ability to hit a baseball as well as Rod Carew, or my possession of two good kidneys will affect my wants differently depending upon whether kidneys, intelligence, or batting skill belong to society, to those who wish or need to use them, or to me...|$|E
40|$|The remark has {{occasionally}} {{been made}} {{that there is nothing}} that can accurately be called a 2 ̆ 2 law of tort 2 ̆ 2 {{in the sense of a}} systematic and logically coherent body of legal principles which disclose a consistent policy in the protection of those interests which it is the function of tort law to protect. This is partly or at least superficially true. Certainly legal literature does not reveal that quantity of analysis and systematic development of legal conceptions in the field of tort that has characterized the development of the law of contract. This may, in part, be explained by the somewhat checkered history of tort law, as compared with that of contract law. The diverse origins of the various 2 ̆ 2 torts, 2 ̆ 2 and the tardy ripening of the idea of negligence as a source of liability, together with the difficulties of rationalizing the several liabilities without fault are obvious impediments to the growth of a uniform and logical structure. What is perhaps more important, the wide range of interests that are protected by tort law and the varying shades of protection required therefor indicate a slow growth of the rational side of this branch of law as compared with the almost unitary interest protected by the law of contracts. Whereas the latter is concerned with the shaping of a consistent policy to protect the interest in the security of promised advantages, the former must work out adequate protection for the interests in <b>bodily</b> <b>security</b> and freedom, security of property, reputation, privacy, marital and other domestic relations, mental and emotional interests, pecuniary interests connected with transactions and trade and business generally...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the authors’ view {{on one of}} the most important issues of civil aviation under current conditions – ensuring aviation security of civil aviation objects. The authors understand "aviation security" in terms of the definition given in the Air Laws and Regulations. The authors consider it possible to speak and use nothing but the term "aviation security" since the term "transport security", introduced relatively recently, does not fundamentally contradict the term "aviation security" insofar as it concerns civil aviation. An original approach of the authors to the functional-essential understanding of air transport security is proposed. The approach is based on the analysis of sufficiently new security-related terms that have not been used so far in air transport security studies. It is <b>bodily</b> <b>security,</b> common security and indivisible security. As a result of the implemented study, the authors propose a new term: integral air transport security. Besides, the authors give the definition of integral security term, structure the term and provide an analysis of the functional relationships of the structure elements. The statement of the issue of modeling the security (danger) of the object in the format of a hypothetical field that represents some state of the environment as a security space is presented. It is shown that the methodology of the study of integrated security is reduced to assessing security level and deciding the issue of its acceptability. For this reason, it is necessary to solve the issues of formalization and modeling. The authors believe that the mathematical apparatus of the theory of boundary value problems,  that are described by a system of partial differential equations, is the most adequate for formalization out of the many methods that field theory offers...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{provides a}} historically informed {{examination of the}} conditions under which pavement dwellers in contemporary Mumbai are compelled to live in order to survive. Among the most impoverished and politically marginalised populations of Mumbai, pavement dwellers have long been an element of the city's, and the nation's, politics of belonging. Their precipitously located dwellings on the city's pavements, and the frequent evictions that they are subjected to, are indicative of the material and political alienation of pavement dwellers from the body politic. Investigating how these violent conditions of life are produced and legitimised is the task to which this dissertation attends. The investigation is advanced through a relational formulation of the term 'living conditions', a conceptualisation that brings into focus social relations that extend far beyond the sidewalk, in order to apprehend the material and political circumstances under which pavement dwellers are compelled to encroach on the sidewalks of Mumbai in order to live. Through a historicization of the living conditions of pavement dwellers, the ragged encampments that line the streets of Byculla (a locality in Mumbai) are tied to the broader politics of sovereignty in postcolonial India, i. e. the political configuration of land and life, which have rendered pavement dwellers as a population that has run out of place to live. This methodological exegesis of the figure of the pavement dweller utilises the analytical tools of historical sociology and political economy in order to pry open the nation-building project of development and reveal the exclusions through which the space and subject of sovereignty is defined, and the poor become Other. I argue that the suppression of the historical relationships that have produced populations as pavement dwellers has been a crucial element {{in the construction of the}} squatting figure of the pavement dweller as the predatory Other against whose encroachments 'the citizen' must be secured. Further, in order to understand how the urban poor came to squat on the sidewalks of the city in order to live, I find that it was essential to locate this national theatre of violence and sovereign power within a broader, geopolitical framework. For, it is in the crisis of sovereignty that the newly independent Indian state faced as it struggled with chronic food deficits, and the consequent embrace of agricultural modernization, that the narrative of transforming rural populations into pavement dwellers - alienated from the land - must be located. The argument thus is that the historicised figure of the pavement dweller - and the challenges that the poor face in having their claim for <b>bodily</b> <b>security</b> recognised within the extant social order - provides a critical vantage point from which to trace the particular modernist organization of life and land that is invested in categories of citizenship and sovereignty...|$|E
