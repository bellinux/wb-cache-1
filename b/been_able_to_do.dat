5|$|The Court's {{right to}} give damages was reiterated in Phelps v Prothero in 1855, where the Court of Appeal in Chancery held {{that if a}} {{plaintiff}} starts an action {{in a court of}} equity for specific performance and damages are also appropriate, the court of equity may choose to award damages. This authorisation was limited to certain circumstances, and was again not regularly used. Eventually, the Chancery Amendment Act 1858 gave the Court full jurisdiction to award damages; the situation before that was so limited that lawyers at the time commented as if the Court had not previously <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so.|$|E
5|$|Model's {{first order}} was that Falaise be defended, {{which did not}} impress his staff. However, he quickly changed his mind, convincing Hitler to authorize the {{immediate}} escape of the German Seventh Army and Panzer Group Eberbach—something that Kluge, with his limited political clout, had not <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> He was thus able to rescue {{a high proportion of}} the units involved, albeit at the cost of nearly all their armour and heavy materiel. When Hitler demanded that Paris be held, Model replied that he could do so, but only if given an extra 200,000 men and several panzer divisions—an act that has been described as naïveté by some, and canny bargaining by others. The reinforcements were not forthcoming, and the city's liberation took place on 25 August. Meanwhile, Model fell back to the German border.|$|E
5|$|An online version, Black & White: The Gathering, was in development, {{and would}} have enabled creatures to {{interact}} those of other players in a cut-down game environment over the internet. Lionhead planned to release Black & White: The Gathering {{two months before the}} main game's release as a free download, and it was to offer a choice of creatures. It would have linked with chat programs such as AOL instant messenger and ICQ and convert text to a speech bubble from the creature. It was intended for players to be able to upload the main game's creature into Black & White: The Gathering and its experiences to be saved into the main game. Another online program, Black & White Worlds, was in development. This would have taken place in the worlds of the main game. Molyneux explained that there was to be a server, whose worlds would have been set up with a match-making system and players would have <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> battle, like last man standing. There was also a plan to produce Black & White Universe, in which players would have had a persistent online world.|$|E

5|$|Finding her mother's body, Buffy {{at first}} denies what she sees, {{to the point}} of imagining {{alternate}} realities. Whedon stated that these mini dream sequences were like documentaries; people who find their loved ones dead are desperate to imagine a different, better outcome, and they create fantasies that cause much more pain when they are forced to return to the harshness of reality. Later in the hospital, Buffy imagines what she might have <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to save Joyce, although the doctor tells her {{there was nothing to be}} done. Willow and Xander express anger and helplessness. Anya, new to mortality and human connections, is childlike in her innocence and questions. Xander's anger and Anya's confusion allow them to be mothered somewhat by Willow, who needs to take care of someone. Dawn is deeply in denial, unable to understand that the woman she thought she had known all her life was gone. Tara, who has gone through the ordeal before, represents the acceptance phase, soothing and helping the others to work through what they are experiencing. Buffy toward the end also begins to see acceptance when she tells Dawn that the body in the morgue is not their mother; Joyce is gone.|$|E
5|$|If early {{tetrapods}} {{lived in}} freshwater, {{and if they}} {{lost the ability to}} produce urea and used ammonia only, they would have to evolve it from scratch again later. Not a single species of all the ray-finned fishes living today has <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that, so it is not likely the tetrapods would have done so either. Terrestrial animals that can only produce ammonia would have to drink constantly, making a life on land impossible (a few exceptions exist, as some terrestrial woodlice can excrete their nitrogenous waste as ammonia gas). This probably also was a problem at the start when the tetrapods started to spend time out of water, but eventually the urea system would dominate completely. Because of this it is not likely they emerged in freshwater (unless they first migrated into freshwater habitats and then migrated onto land so shortly after that they still retained the ability to make urea), although some species never left, or returned to, the water could of course have adapted to freshwater lakes and rivers.|$|E
5|$|In June 2016, Ariel Sabar {{published}} an article in The Atlantic which identified the previous owner of the papyrus as Walter Fritz, rather than Laukamp, and provided further evidence for supposing that the papyrus was a forgery. Fritz initially denied being the papyrus' owner, but later admitted to it. Fritz was a former Egyptology student who left his job at a German museum after items from the museum went missing. For several years, he ran pornography websites featuring his wife, who believes that she can channel God and Michael the Archangel; she had even published a book of sayings that she believes God transmitted through her. The Atlantic speculated that Fritz may have been motivated to forge the text by financial issues - Fritz had recently been unable to sell his house - or a desire to make The Da Vinci Code a reality; he denies having any financial problems, but had seen The Da Vinci Codes film adaptation. Sabar had found that Fritz once ran an art website where he sold artworks which resembled ancient manuscripts. Fritz denied that he or anyone else forged the Gospel of Jesus' Wife, but admitted {{that he may have}} <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so had he tried. Fritz also stressed to Sabar that he never once claimed that the Gospel of Jesus' Wife was a genuinely ancient text.|$|E

5|$|To works, however, {{of which}} the {{excellence}} is not absolute and definite, but gradual and comparative; to works not raised upon principles demonstrative and scientifick, but appealing wholly to observation and experience, no other test can be applied than length of duration and continuance of esteem. What mankind have long possessed they have often examined and compared, and if they persist to value the possession, it is because frequent comparisons have confirmed opinion in its favour. As among the works of nature no man can properly call a river deep or a mountain high, without the knowledge of many mountains and many rivers; so in the productions of genius, nothing can be stiled excellent till it has been compared with other works of the same kind. Demonstration immediately displays its power, and has nothing to hope or fear from the flux of years; but works tentative and experimental must be estimated by their proportion to the general and collective ability of man, as it is discovered in a long succession of endeavours. Of the first building that was raised, it might be with certainty determined that it was round or square, but whether it was spacious or lofty must have been referred to time.

25|$|Over {{the course}} of the next six months the 36th Battalion was mainly {{involved}} in only minor defensive actions and it was not until 7 June 1917 the battalion fought in its first major battle, at Messines. After this the battalion participated in the attack on Passchendaele on 12 October 1917. During this battle, the battalion managed to secure its objective, however, as other units had not <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, the battalion had had to withdraw as its flanks were exposed to German counter-attacks and there was a lack of effective artillery support. For the next five months the 36th Battalion alternated between periods of duty manning the line and training or labouring in the rear areas in Belgium, before it was moved south to the Somme to help blunt the German advance during their last-ditch effort to win the war as part of the Spring Offensive of 1918. During this time they were deployed around Villers-Bretonneux in order to defend the approaches to the strategically important town of Amiens, taking part in a counter-attack at Hangard Wood in late March before beating off a concerted German attack on Villers-Bretonneux on 4 April, where the battalion suffered greatly when the Germans attacked with gas.|$|E
25|$|During the 1930s, de Valera had {{systematically}} {{stripped down}} the Irish Free State constitution {{that had been}} drafted by a committee under the nominal chairmanship of his rival, Michael Collins. In reality, de Valera had <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that only due to three reasons. First, though the 1922 constitution originally required a public plebiscite for any amendment beyond eight years after its passage, the Free State government under W. T. Cosgrave had amended that period to sixteen years. This meant that, until 1938, the Free State constitution could be amended by the simple passage of a Constitutional Amendment Act through the Oireachtas. Secondly, while the Governor-General of the Irish Free State could reserve or deny Royal Assent to any legislation, from 1927, the power to advise the governor-general to do so no longer rested with the British government in London but with His Majesty's Government in the Irish Free State, which meant that, in practice, the Royal Assent was automatically granted to legislation; the government was hardly likely to advise the governor-general to block the enactment {{of one of its}} own bills. Thirdly, in theory the constitution had to be in keeping with the provisions of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, the fundamental law of the state. However, that requirement had been removed only a short time before de Valera gained power.|$|E
