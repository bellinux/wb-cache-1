At terminal C, commodity A[*]→[*]C has reached its destination and leaves the system, and commodity A[*]→[*]D is blocked to move to terminal D. Using this <b>blocking</b> <b>plan,</b> the 100 cars for commodity A[*]→[*]B use one block, (A, B), the 80 cars for commodity A[*]→[*]C use two blocks, (A, B) and (B, C), and the 90 cars for commodity A[*]→[*]D use three blocks, (A, B), (B, C), (C, D). Therefore, for <b>blocking</b> <b>plan</b> 1, there are 530 classifications; however, this plan is not feasible because it requires blocking 170 cars at terminal B that has a maximum volume of 90 cars.|$|E

It is shown that the combination of these three technologies makes it possible to efficiently generate near-optimal block-structured grids for previously-studied classes of multi-body configu-rations.

30|$|We {{can define}} the RBP as follows. To reduce the {{intermediate}} handlings of shipments as they travel over the railroad network, {{a set of}} shipments is classified (or grouped together) at a railroad yard to create a group of cars called block. The aim of the RBP is to choose which blocks to put together at each yard and to determine the sequences of blocks that deliver each shipment to minimize the total miles that the shipments travel and their intermediate handlings (or reclassifications). In fact, the RBP aims to identify the classification plan for all shipments at all yards in the network to minimize the total shipment cost, i.e., to create a <b>blocking</b> <b>plan</b> which dictates which blocks should be built at each individual yard and which traffic should be assigned to each block as they travel from origins to destinations.|$|E
40|$|Railroads ship {{individual}} cars {{according to}} blocking plans that route the cars in groups (blocks) that share common intermediate stops. An individual shipment is regrouped (reclassified) {{two to three}} times along the way from its origin to destination. Yards are crucial facilities of the rail network where cars are reclassified according to such blocking plans. Therefore, yard locations and the <b>blocking</b> <b>plan</b> impose the detour and classification of cars over the physical network. Yards are capacitated with respect to number of blocks made and number of cars classified; rail lines between major stations are capacitated with respect to number of cars that pass through. These restrictions are accounted for in designing the blocking plans. Changing the yard locations and expanding associated capacities may result in dramatic changes in blocking plans saving {{tens of millions of dollars}} in railroad transportation costs. We develop a mathematical programming formulation and propose solution methods for the yard location problem and the capacity expansion problems. We demonstrate that the railroads can save significantly by reconfiguring their networks...|$|E

This paper studies two notions of strong and coalition-proof correlated equilibria for finite noncooperative games. A correlated equilibrium {{is a joint}} distribution µ on strategy profiles so that no individual player has an incentive to deviate from the private recommendation of his strategy for any profile drawn from this distribution. This notion is extended to a coalition S of players who share, at the interim (rather than ex-ante) stage, their recommendations in a credible way. A strong correlated equilibrium is immune to deviations by coalitions of players who do not anticipate any further deviations after the coalition has implemented its <b>blocking</b> <b>plan.</b> The second concept of coalition-proof correlated equilibrium requires stronger stability that recursively takes into account further possible deviations inside the coalition when it tries to block a correlated strategy, in analogy to the corresponding concept for Nash equilibria due to B.

40|$|Railroad {{planning}} involves solving two optimization problems: (i) the blocking problem, which determines what {{blocks to}} make and how to route traffic over these blocks; and (ii) the train schedule design problem, which determines train origins, destinations, and routes. Once the <b>blocking</b> <b>plan</b> and train schedule have been obtained, {{the next step is}} to determine which trains should carry which blocks. This problem, known as the block-to-train assignment problem, is considered in this paper. We provide two formulations for this problem: an arc-based formulation and a path-based formulation. The latter is generally smaller than the former, and it can better handle practical constraints. We also propose exact and heuristic algorithms based on the path-based formulation. Our exact algorithm solves an integer programming formulation with CPLEX using both a priori generation and dynamic generation of paths. Our heuristic algorithms include a Lagrangian relaxation-based method as well as a greedy construction method. We present computational results of our algorithms using the data provided by a major US railroad. We show that we can obtain an optimal solution of the block-to-train assignment problem within a few minutes of computational time, and can obtain heuristic solutions with 1 – 2 % deviations from the optimal solutions within a few seconds...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn the {{industrial}} application environment considered, different variants of a basic product type are produced {{using the same}} resources and following the same basic process plan. To support production planning and scheduling {{for this type of}} production system, the concept of <b>block</b> <b>planning</b> is introduced, which has gained considerable attention particularly in the consumer goods industry. A block represents a pre-defined sequence of production orders of variable size. In order to demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed <b>block</b> <b>planning</b> concept, we consider the production system of a major producer of hair dyes as a case study. We present two different implementations of the <b>block</b> <b>planning</b> concept. One utilizes the Production Planning / Detailed Scheduling module of the SAP APO© software. The other approach is based on a mixed-integer linear programming formulation. In contrast to the academic literature, a continuous representation of time is chosen. Thus the number of variables and constraints could be considerably reduced. The approach suggested is computationally very efficient and provides the flexibility to model a variety of application specific features...|$|R
30|$|Further {{characteristics}} of the <b>block</b> <b>planning</b> approach refer to the modelling of demand in a mixed make-to-stock and make-to-order environment. For instance, in the consumer goods industry, short-term demand is known with certainty based on distinct customer orders. In addition, expected order quantities for future periods must be forecasted. The integration of both views leads {{to the definition of}} so-called demand elements, which either represent specific customer orders or forecasts. In <b>block</b> <b>planning,</b> for each demand element a due date is defined on a continuous time scale. A demand element may be filled from initial stock or by a set of assigned production orders.|$|R

In this paper, a flexible <b>block</b> <b>planning</b> approach based on a mixed-integer linear (MILP) model formulation is proposed which introduces a considerable degree of flexibility for determining the length of an entire block, varying the production quantities for individual products within a block, and for scheduling the start-off and completion times of all blocks and production lots.|$|R
