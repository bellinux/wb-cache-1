50|$|When {{the wind}} turbine nacelle is {{positioned}} on {{the tower and}} the yaw bearing assembly is completed {{it is necessary to}} adjust the pressure on the individual gliding pads of the bearing. This is necessary in order to avoid un-even wear of the gliding pads and excessive loading on some sectors of the yaw bearing. In order to achieve that, an adjustment mechanism is necessary, which enables the technicians to adjust the contact pressure of each individual gliding element in a controllable and secure way. The most common solution is the utilization of bottom bearing plates equipped with large opening, which accommodate the adjustable gliding bearing systems. These adjustable gliding bearings comprise a gliding unit (i.e. gliding pad) and an adjustable pressure distribution plate. In between the gliding pad and the pressure plate several spring (pre-tension) elements are located. The vertical position of the pressure plates is usually controlled by an adjustment screw. This adjustment screw presses against the pressure plate while being retained by a counter-pressure support plate, fixed on the bearing assembly with strong bolts. In this way it is possible to apply various levels of contact pressure among the different gliding pads and therefore to ensure that each gliding component of the yaw <b>bearing</b> <b>arrangement</b> is performing as anticipated.|$|E

50|$|Magnetic liquid rotary seals {{operate with}} no {{maintenance}} and extremely low leakage {{in a very}} wide range of applications. Ferrofluid-based seals used in industrial and scientific applications are most often packaged in mechanical seal assemblies called rotary feedthroughs, which also contain a central shaft, ball bearings and an outer housing. The ball bearings provide two important functions: maintaining the shaft's centering within the seal gap, and supporting external loads. The bearings are the only mechanical wear-items, as the dynamic seal is actually a series of rings made of ultra-low vapor pressure, oil-based liquid held magnetically between the rotor and stator. Therefore, the operating life and equipment maintenance cycles are generally very long, and the drag torque very low. The magnet material is permanently charged and requires no electrical power or other re-energizing or maintenance. Ferrofluid-sealed feedthroughs reach performance levels that other technologies can't achieve, by optimizing features such as ferrofluid viscosity and magnetic strength, magnet and steel materials, <b>bearing</b> <b>arrangements,</b> and water cooling for applications with extremely high speeds or temperatures. Ferrofluid-sealed feedthroughs routinely operate in environments including ultra-high vacuum (below 10−8 mbar), temperatures over 1,000 °C, {{tens of thousands of}} RPM, and multiple-atmosphere pressures.|$|R

Four bearings seem to be insufficient while six are probably more than are required. A well designed five-bearing system would seem to be an optimum configuration. Bearings with over-hung components such as fans, should be designed to minimize such over-hang to limit associated wobble, which in turn leads to shroud rub, or to allow closer running clearances.

40|$|One major {{limitation}} {{in the use}} of externally {{pressurized air}} bearings (EPB) is their susceptibility to vibrations problems. The most destructive vibration that develops in a gas bearing is self-excited whirl, which commences when the damping force in the bearing becomes zero. The main aim of this research was to undertake a theoretical investigation of cylindrical whirl in a balanced vertical axis EPB, and ways of delaying its onset. In order to do this, it was necessary firstly to find the bearing static stiffness and damping coefficients by means of a compressible flow analysis of the gas. To do this, by employing Mathematica, a novel approach used the 'shooting method' in order to solve the governing differential equation (which included functions of a complex variable). The results obtained compared very favourably with previous theoretical published work that had employed finite difference methods. Having found the bearing coefficients, it was possible to solve the bearing dynamic differential equations and thus create stability maps. This procedure was carried out on various <b>bearing</b> <b>arrangements</b> aimed at raising the stability threshold. These included: A series arrangement involving a non-rotating externally pressurized sleeve round the rotor as well as a series arrangement in parallel with the main bearing. The series-parallel configuration resulted in a bearing with a threshold speed and stiffness between the extremes of a simple EPS and a series EPB, all three designs being of the same length. An optimum adjustment of the series-parallel geometry, created threshold speeds three to four times that of a simple version. This in itself was an excellent achievement. Finally, a further increase in threshold frequency, up to seven times that of an equivalent simple EPB, was attained by an additional novel design round the sleeve of a passive eddy current magnetic damper...|$|R

40|$|The {{limits of}} rotordynamic {{stability}} {{continue to be}} pushed by the high power densities and rotational speeds of modern rocket engine turbomachinery. Destabilizing forces increase dramatically with rotor speed. Rotordynamic stability is lost when these destabilizing forces overwhelm the stabilizing forces. The vibration from the unstable rotor grows until it is limited by some nonlinearity. For example, a rolling element bearing with a stiffness characteristic that increases with deflection may limit the vibration amplitude. The loads and deflections resulting from this limit cycle vibration (LCV) can lead to bearing and seal damage which promotes ever increasing levels of subsynchronous vibration. Engineers combat LCV by introducing rotordynamic elements that generate increased stabilizing forces and reduced destabilizing forces. For example, replacing a labyrinth seal with a damping seal results in substantial increases in the damping and stiffness rotordynamic coefficients. Adding a swirl brake to the damping seal greatly reduces the destabilizing cross-coupled forces generated by the damping seal for even further increases in the stabilizing capacity. Marshall?s Annular Seal Test (MAST) rig is designed to experimentally measure the stabilizing capacity of new annular seal designs.

CuO nanoparticles were synthesized by chemical method and characterized using XRD and TEM to study the crystallanity and ultrastructure. The synthesized CuO nanoparticles were of the size range 5 - 8 nm. 0. 2 %, 0. 5 %, and 1 % (W/V) of CuO nanoparticles was added to the lubricant (ISO VG 68) and was used for further analysis. The test rig setup consists of a ball <b>bearing</b> and loading <b>arrangement</b> operated by a DC motor. The bearing (New, Ball defect and Outer defect) vibrations were measured using base lubricant and CuO lubricant mixture. Our results show a reduction of 41 % vibration amplitude while using 0. 2 % (W/V) CuO nanoparticles inouter case defected compared to base lubricant...|$|R
