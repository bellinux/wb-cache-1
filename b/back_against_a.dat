25|$|As Aragorn {{searches}} for Frodo, he suddenly hears Boromir's horn. Aragorn finds Boromir mortally wounded by arrows, {{sitting with his}} <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>a</b> great tree, surrounded by many slain orcs. Before Boromir dies, Aragorn learns that Saruman's Uruk-hai soldiers have kidnapped some of the hobbits, {{in spite of his}} efforts to defend them, that Frodo had vanished after Boromir had attempted to take the Ring from him and that he truly regretted his actions. In his last moments, Boromir charges Aragorn with defending Minas Tirith from Sauron. With Legolas and Gimli, who had been fighting Orcs by themselves, Aragorn pays his last tributes to Boromir and sends him down the Great River Anduin on a funeral boat, the usual methods of burial being impractical. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli later resolve to follow the Uruk-hai captors and save Merry and Pippin.|$|E
25|$|The Australians were {{subsequently}} sent to western Transvaal, joining Colonel Thornycroft’s Field Force at Klerksdorp. The column—which was predominantly Australian and included the Third New South Wales Bushmen, Haslee’s Scouts (an irregular unit composed of Australians), the AAMC, the Eighth New Zealand Brigade and Thornycroft’s own regular mounted infantry—advanced {{as part of}} General Ian Hamilton’s force numbering 20,000 men in the great Western Drive. The advance aimed to drive de la Rey <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>a</b> chain of blockhouses between Klerksdorp–Ventersdorp and {{proved to be the}} last of the war. The drive began on 19 April, but halted soon after, following news that peace negotiations were progressing. On 21 April the ACH moved out of camp and turned away from the blockhouse line towards the western railway, with orders to destroy crops and mealie fields and to push the Boers back towards the railway barrier.|$|E

25|$|Having {{spent time}} amongst the artists of Paris in the 1920s, McKay was intimately {{acquainted with the}} {{dynamics}} between painters and models {{and the manner in}} which modernist painters presented African subjects and African culture. In her article, “Caribbean Models for Modernism in the Work of Claude McKay and Jean Rhys,” Leah Rosenberg writes, “The fascination with African art and its identification with female sexuality was characteristic of modernist and avant-garde primitivism”. The inclination to stereotype and caricatures the African physical form created, however inadvertently, a form of hegemony reminiscent to McKay of the colonialism he grew up with in Jamaica. “Sexuality and black culture,” Rosenberg explains, “held a privileged place in modernist and avant-garde art from Picasso to Gertrude Stein”. In need of money, McKay posed nude for the Cubist painter Andre Lhote. Through his experience, McKay saw first-hand how the larger social hegemony between European white supremacy and people of Afro-Caribbean descent could play itself out between the artist and its subject. McKay critically recalled the experience in various ways in many of his most notable works. In doing so, he shined a critical light on a cornerstone of modernism and once again pushed <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>a</b> system in which he found himself.|$|E

The lyrics revolve around protesting bigotry and hatred. Filmed in Los Angeles, the music video {{was inspired by a}} negative encounter Chachki had in an Australian McDonald's. In the video, Chachki forms a gang to fight <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>a</b> group of homophobic men. It also features scenes of Chachki performing aerial silk acrobatics.|$|E

ICP went on [...] "The ShockFest Tour" [...] with Da Mafia 6ix, Mushroomhead, Madchild and Jelly Roll, additionally Big Hoodoo joined the tour to perform before the ticketed acts. To close out the shows on the tour Insane Clown Posse and Da Mafia 6ix performed on stage together as The Killjoy Club, doing only two songs.|$|E

500|$|At {{the start}} of the show, Lana Lang is {{characterized}} as the girl next door. As Kreuk describes her, she is the [...] "beautiful, popular girl who is really lonely". She has a [...] "hole in her heart", because of the loss of her parents, and feels empathy for everyone. Kristin feels that deep down the character is a [...] "tough girl", and that Lex manages to bring that side of her out more. For instance, he convinces her to fight <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>a</b> rival coffee shop that is spreading rumors about The Talon – the coffee shop that she joint owns with Lex. Unfortunately, that tough side is not seen in the first season. According to Kreuk, the character was never placed in situations where she could show her outgoing side, because she was left to communicate primarily with Whitney and Clark. Kreuk thinks that Lana [...] "lived in her head a little bit"; she was intelligent enough to read classical books, but would also read romantic novels [...] "on the sly".|$|E
500|$|All of {{the valleys}} of northwestern Serbia were swamped by {{constant}} rainfall. The mountains {{had been covered}} in snow since early October. Acknowledging the opportunity that such conditions presented, Putnik told his closest advisors: [...] "All my strategy consists in placing the 'Serbian national mud' between the enemy's fighting line and his supplies." [...] On 31 October, von Frank's 5th Army pushed down into the region between the Sava and Drina rivers while Potiorek's 6th Army drove west across the Drina and into the Jagodnja plateau. Austria-Hungary's third invasion of Serbia commenced on 6 November 1914, with intense artillery fire strafing a series of Serbian border towns. On 7 November, the Austro-Hungarian 5th and 6th armies attacked across the Drina. Despite being outnumbered and {{in desperate need of}} ammunition, the Serbian Army offered fierce resistance but was forced into strategic withdrawal. The 3rd Army fell <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>a</b> road by the Jadar River in an effort to block the Austro-Hungarian advance towards Valjevo, while the 1st Army retreated southward into the Serbian interior and the Užice Army managed to prevent the Austro-Hungarians from crossing the Drina.|$|E
500|$|As {{the leading}} {{figure in the}} League Morris {{embarked}} {{on a series of}} speeches and talks on street corners, in working men's clubs, and in lecture theatres across England and Scotland. He also visited Dublin, there offering his support for Irish nationalism, and formed a branch of the League at his Hammersmith house. By the time of their first conference in July 1885, the League had eight branches across England and had affiliations with several socialist groups in Scotland. However, as the British socialist movement grew it faced increased opposition from the establishment, with police frequently arresting and intimidating activists. To combat this, the League joined a Defence Club with other socialist groups, including the SDF, for which Morris was appointed treasurer. Morris was passionate in denouncing the [...] "bullying and hectoring" [...] that he felt socialists faced from the police, and on one occasion was arrested after fighting <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>a</b> police officer; a magistrate dismissed the charges. The Black Monday riots of February 1886 led to increased political repression against left-wing agitators, and in July Morris was arrested and fined for public obstruction while preaching socialism on the streets.|$|E

500|$|Because {{they get}} so little energy from their diet, koalas must limit their energy use and sleep 20 {{hours a day}}; only 4 hours a day are spent in active movement. They are {{predominantly}} active at night and {{spend most of their}} waking hours feeding. They typically eat and sleep in the same tree, possibly for as long as a day. On very hot days, a koala may climb down to the coolest part of the tree which is cooler than the surrounding air. [...] The koala hugs the tree to lose heat without panting. On warm days, a koala may rest with its <b>back</b> <b>against</b> <b>a</b> branch or lie on its stomach or back with its limbs dangling. During cold, wet periods, it curls itself into a tight ball to conserve energy. On windy days, a koala finds a lower, thicker branch on which to rest. While it spends most of the time in the tree, the animal descends to the ground to move to another tree, walking on all fours. The koala usually grooms itself with its hindpaws, but sometimes uses its forepaws or mouth.|$|E

Youtube is used because it enables a direct engagement, in a direct way with the public, the latter being able to leave comments and to give their opinion (Berglund 2016).|$|R
