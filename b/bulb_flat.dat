40|$|As {{the amount}} of {{activity}} in the Arctic increases, the response of ship structures to ice loading is becoming ever more important. Plastic limit states design is utilized {{for the design of}} ship structures for ice conditions. This thesis includes the discussion of full-scale laboratory experiments involving ice-structure interaction. Stiffened panels representative of full-scale polar ship structure are loaded with laboratory-grown ice blocks quasi-statically to extreme load levels. These experiments are unique in scale for a laboratory environment. Finite element analysis of the laboratory experiments is performed, and high fidelity is achieved. The close match between real-life results and finite element simulation validates the methods used in this thesis. Using the laboratory experiments as validation, the plastic response of polar class ship structure along the midbody ice belt of a longitudinally framed, PC 7, 12, 000 tonne ship is evaluated using finite element analysis. Different stiffener cross-section types are evaluated, including T-section, L-section, <b>bulb</b> <b>flat,</b> and flat bar-section. Full discussion of the results is included...|$|E
50|$|The onions of this variety have <b>bulbs</b> with <b>flat</b> {{base and}} are spherical. The other {{characteristics}} which make them unique are their deep scarlet red colour, anthocyanin, phenols and high pungency. They are also known to contain {{higher levels of}} protein, phosphorus, iron and carotene.|$|R
50|$|Allium consanguineum is {{a species}} of onion found high in the Himalayas of {{northern}} Pakistan and northern India. It is a perennial herb up to 35 cm tall, with an egg-shaped <b>bulb.</b> Leaves are <b>flat,</b> narrow. Umbels are hemispherical, densely crowded with many yellow or pink flowers.|$|R
5000|$|Agaricus abruptibulbus is {{a species}} of {{mushroom}} in the genus Agaricus. It {{is commonly known as}} the abruptly-bulbous agaricus or the flat-bulb mushroom. First described by the mycologist Charles Horton Peck, this bulbous-stemmed edible species smells slightly of anise, and turns yellow when bruised or cut. The mushroom is medium-sized, with a white, yellow-staining cap on a slender stipe that has a wide, <b>flat</b> <b>bulb</b> on the base ...|$|R
5000|$|This {{is a small}} {{herbaceous}} perennial {{growing from}} a <b>bulb</b> and producing <b>flat,</b> shiny, green, hairless, grasslike leaves up to 30 cm long. The foliage has an onionlike scent when crushed. The stem grows up to 20 cm tall and bears a solitary showy flower in spring (hence the Latin name uniflorum - [...] "single flower"). Each honey-scented, star-shaped flower has six pointed lobes up to 3 centimeters long in shades of very pale to deep purple-blue.|$|R
50|$|The {{kinds of}} {{chemicals}} found in e-waste that are particularly dangerous {{to human health}} and the environment are lead, mercury, brominated flame-retardants, and cadmium. Lead is found in the screens of phones, TVs and computer monitors and can damage kidneys, nerves, blood, bones, reproductive organs, and muscles. Mercury is found in the <b>bulbs</b> in <b>flat</b> screen TVs, laptop screens, and fluorescent bulbs, and can cause damage to the kidneys and the nervous system. Brominated flame-retardants found in cables and plastic cases can cause cancer, disruption of liver function, and nerve damage. Cadmium is found in rechargeable batteries and can cause kidney damage and cancer. Poorer countries are dumping grounds for the United States' e-waste as many governments accept money for disposing this waste on their lands. This causes increased health risks for people in these countries, especially ones who work or live close to these dumps.|$|R
5000|$|On 3 February 2000, Matthew finally confronts Steve. He {{comes for}} a final {{showdown}} with Steve in the club {{where it all began}} with Saskia's murder a year earlier. Matthew reveals that he has been in the Square for weeks and that the detective Steve had hired was useless. He demanded £10,000 but Steve tries to bully him and throw him out but Matthew shows him a video of him planting light <b>bulbs</b> in Steve's <b>flat.</b> He makes Steve realise that if his sister, Jackie (Race Davies), arrives home and turns on the lights they will explode. Steve isn't buying it and taunts Matthew about how stupid he is and that is what got him into prison. He pulls a gun on Matthew to try and scare him off. Matthew is one step ahead and had the gun emptied beforehand. Steve is shocked and after a struggle, Matthew hits him with a glass bottle, knocking him unconscious. He ties Steve to a chair and threatened to set the club on fire. Steve is reduced to a helpless and emotional wreck which is what Matthew wants. He reveals that the video was fake and the petrol he used to threaten Steve is actually water. He gets his revenge, which is to see Steve beg for mercy. He leaves the Square for good and is not seen again. When Steve dies in a car crash two years later, flowers from Matthew saying [...] "Dear Steve, rot in hell" [...] are left on his grave.|$|R

[...] How we fried and sighed! At last, we reached land under Fort Genova, and I was carried ashore pick-a-back, and plucked the first flower I saw for Annie. It was a strange scene, far more novel than I had imagined: the high, steep banks covered with rich, spicy vegetation of which I hardly knew one plant. The dwarf palm with fan-like leaves, growing about two feet high, formed the staple of the verdure. As we brushed through them, the gummy leaves of a cistus stuck to the clothes; and with its small white flower and yellow heart, stood for our English dog-rose. In place of heather, we had myrtle and lentisque with leaves somewhat similar. That large <b>bulb</b> with long <b>flat</b> leaves? Do not touch it if your hands are cut; the Arabs use it as blisters for their horses. Is that the same sort? No, take that one up; it is the bulb of a dwarf palm, each layer of the onion peels off, brown and netted, like the outside of a cocoa-nut.

50|$|In lithic analysis, a {{subdivision}} of archaeology, a bulb of applied force (also {{known as a}} bulb of percussion or simply bulb of force) is a defining characteristic of a lithic flake. Bulb of applied force was first correctly described by Sir John Evans, the cofounder of prehistoric archeology. However, bulb of percussion was coined scientifically by W.J. Sollas. When a flake is detached from its parent core, {{a portion of the}} Hertzian cone of force caused by the detachment blow is detached with it, leaving a distinctive bulb on the flake and a corresponding flake scar on the core. In the case of a unidirectional core, the bulb of applied force is produced by an initiated crack formed at the point of contact, which begins producing the Hertzian cone. The outward pressure increases causing the crack to curve away from the core and the bulb formation. The bulb of applied force forms below the striking platform as a slight bulge. If the flake is completely crushed the bulb will not be visible. Bulbs of applied force may be distinctive, moderate, or diffuse, depending upon the force of the blow used to detach the flake, and upon the type of material used as a fabricator. The bulb of applied force can indicate the mass or density of the tool used in the application of the force. The bulb may also be an indication of the angle of the force. This information is helpful to archaeologists in understanding and recreating the process of flintknapping. Generally, the harder the material used as a fabricator, the more distinctive the bulb of applied force. Soft hammer percussion has a low diffuse bulb while hard hammer percussion usually leaves a more distinct and noticeable bulb of applied force. Pressure flake also allowed for diffuse bulbs. The bulb of percussion of a flake or blade is convex and the core has a corresponding concave bulb. The concave bulb on the core is known as the negative bulb of percussion. Bulbs of applied force are not usually present if the flake has been struck off naturally. This allows archaeologists to identify and distinguish natural breakage from human artistry. The three main <b>bulb</b> types are <b>flat</b> or nondescript, normal, and pronounced. A <b>flat</b> or nondescript <b>bulb</b> is poorly defined and does not rise up on the ventral surface. A normal bulb on the ventral side has average height and well-defined. A pronounced bulb rises up on ventral side and is very large.|$|R
