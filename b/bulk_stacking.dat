40|$|The layered {{compound}} La 2 - 2 xSr 1 + 2 xMn 2 O 7 (x= 0. 3) {{consists of}} bilayers of metallic MnO 2 sheets separated by insulating material. The compound exhibits markedly anisotropic magnetoresistance at temperatures {{well below the}} three-dimensional magnetic ordering temperature TC= 90 K in addition to colossal magnetoresistance around TC. We present neutron diffraction data which show that the magnetic structure of this material switches from antiferromagnetic stacking of the (ferromagnetically ordered) sheets in zero field to ferromagnetic stacking {{in a field of}} 1. 5 Tesla. The data are the first to be collected on any manganite as a function of applied field, exactly as the magnetoresistance data themselves are collected. They provide a natural explanation of the low-field magnetoresistance in the ordered phase in terms of spin-polarised tunnelling between the magnetic layers and suggest that the material is a <b>bulk</b> <b>stack</b> of spin-valve devices.

40|$|Liquid-phase {{exfoliation}} of layered materials {{offers a}} large-scale approach toward {{the synthesis of}} 2 D nanostructures. Structural properties of materials can however change during transition from bulk to the 2 D state. Any such changes must be examined and understood for successful implementation of 2 D nanostructures. In this work, we demonstrate nonbulk stacking sequences in the few-layer MoS 2 and WS 2 nanoflakes produced by liquid-phase exfoliation. Our analysis shows that nonbulk stacking sequences {{can be derived from}} its bulk counterparts by translational shifts of the layers. No structural changes within the layers were observed. Twenty-seven MoS 2 and five WS 2 nanoflakes were imaged and analyzed. Nine MoS 2 and four WS 2 nanoflakes displayed nonbulk stacking. Such dominance of the nonbulk stacking suggests high possibility of unusual stacking sequences in other 2 D nanostructures. Notably, the electronic structure of some non <b>bulk</b> <b>stacked</b> bilayers presents characteristics which are uncommon to either the bulk phase or the single monolayer, for instance, a spin-split conduction band bottom. Our main characterization technique was annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy, which offers direct and reliable imaging of atomic columns.

40|$|Abstract: The {{stacking}} {{orientation of}} bilayers determines the polytype of SiC material. For {{the development of}} polytype heterojunctions a controlled switch from one stacking sequence to another is required. In the present paper it is demonstrated for 4 H-SiC and 6 H-SiC, that the chemical environment during preparation of the (√ 3 ×√ 3) R 30 ◦ reconstruction on SiC(0001) influences the bilayer stacking in the topmost surface region. A silicon rich growth environment results in three bilayers in identical orientation at the very surface, which {{in the case of}} 4 H-SiC corresponds to breaking the <b>bulk</b> <b>stacking</b> sequence. Oxygen rich preparation conditions lead to a reduction to two identically oriented bilayers for both polytypes. The reconstruction geometry of the (√ 3 ×√ 3) R 30 ◦ phase is independent of the polytype and the terminating stacking sequence of the underlying material. In consequence, the surface stacking and as such the starting point of a polytype heterojunction can be taylored by the chemical potential...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1988 The {{major goal}} of this {{research}} work was to develop better electrical measurements {{for the evaluation of}} silicon material quality. The first approach investigated was the Zerbst generation lifetime measurement technique. It was demonstrated that the error in the estimation of the generation lifetime obtained with this technique could be as high as two orders of magnitude due to the neglect of lateral surface generation effects. A procedure was developed to evaluate the generation lifetimes accurately. It includes the use of oxide annealing to reduce surface generation, the employment of an acid-free backside contact process to minimize oxide surface irregularities, and the use of devices of various sizes to extract the actual generation lifetimes. Very high lifetimes of about 50 msec were obtained using this procedure. The second approach investigated was evaluation of the dielectric strength of Si 0 ₂ films thermally grown on silicon material. It was found that oxide annealing did not affect the measured dielectric strength results when the breakdown criterion was set at the catastrophic breakdown current level in the voltage ramp-up technique and when the electrons were injected from the silicon/Si 0 ₂ interface in the constant current technique. A supplemental {{goal of this}} research work was to use the developed generation lifetime measurement procedure to investigate the effect of pre-epitaxial deposition nucleation cycles on the generation lifetimes of silicon wafers from different parts of a silicon ingot. It was found that when a 650 °C nucleation heat treatment cycle was inserted before the depositon of the epitaxial layer, followed by a typical intrinsic gettering process, the generation lifetimes of wafers became independent of their origin in the ingot and were very high, about 35 msec. A relationship between the dielectric strength of Si 0 ₂ films and the density of bulk microdefects was also investigated. The dielectric strength of Si 0 ₂ films was found to increase with the <b>bulk</b> <b>stacking</b> fault density, not with the bulk precipitate density. This indicates that the formation of <b>bulk</b> <b>stacking</b> faults may be the key element responsible, for gettering heavy metal contaminants away from the front surface of the wafer...|$|E

The magnetic fields of such TFMs can break {{the limitation of}} conventional magnets (< 2 T), so they show potential for improving the performance of many electrical applications that use permanent magnets like rotating machines. Towards practical or commercial use of TFMs, effective in situ magnetization {{is one of the}} key issues. The pulsed field magnetization (PFM) is among the most promising magnetization methods in virtue of its compactness, mobility and low cost. However, due to the heat generation during the magnetization, the trapped field and flux acquired by PFM usually cannot achieve the full potential of a sample (acquired by the field cooling or zero field cooling method). The multi-pulse technique was found to effectively improve the trapped field by PFM in practice. In this work, a systematic study on the PFM with successive pulses is presented. A 2 D electromagnetic-thermal coupled model with comprehensive temperature dependent parameters is used to simulate a stack of CCs magnetized by successive magnetic pulses. An overall picture is built to show how the trapped field and flux evolve with different pulse sequences and the evolution patterns are analyzed. Based on the discussion, an operable magnetization strategy of PFM with successive pulses is suggested to provide more trapped field and flux.

Due to the immiscibility of the chemically different segments in diblock copolymers, micro- and nanophase separation processes give rise to different bulk morphologies. More recently, developments were directed to the formation of nanophase separated surfaces using block copolymers. A number of parameters, such as the Flory-Huggins interaction parameter as well as the block length ratio, control the generation of ordered phases and their thermal behavior. In thin film geometry, the total molecular weight has been recognized as an important parameter determining the orientation of the nanostructure relative to the film surface. The interest of the present work is directed to the use of diblock copolymers of poly(n-pentyl methacrylate) (PPMA) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) in thin films.

However the magnetization currents are still mostly unknown {{for this kind of}} three dimensional (3 D) shape, specially below the saturation magnetic field. Knowledge of the magnetization currents in this kind of samples is needed to interpret the measurements and the development of bulk materials for applications. This article presents a systematic analysis of the magnetization currents in prisms of square base and several thicknesses. We make this study by numerical modeling using a variational principle that enables high number of degrees of freedom. We also compute the magnetization loops and the saturation magnetic field, using a definition that is more relevant for thin prisms than previous ones. The article presents a practical analytical fit for any aspect ratio. For applied fields below the saturation field, the current paths are not rectangular, presenting 3 D bending. The thickness-average results are consistent with previous modeling and measurements for thin films. The 3 D bending of the current lines indicates that there could be flux cutting effects in rectangular prisms. The component of the critical current density in the applied field direction may play a role, being the magnetization currents in a <b>bulk</b> and a <b>stack</b> of tapes not identical.

40|$|Composting is one {{of several}} methods for {{treating}} biosolids to create a marketable end product that is easy to handle, store, and use. The end product is usually a Class A, humus-like material without detectable levels of pathogens that can be applied as a soil conditioner and fertilizer to gardens, food and feed crops, and rangelands. This compost provides large quantities of organic matter and nutrients (such as nitrogen and potassium) to the soil, improves soil texture, and elevates soil cation exchange capacity (an indication of the soil’s ability to hold nutrients), all characteristics of a good organic fertilizer. Biosolids compost is safe to use and generally has a high degree of acceptability by the public. Thus, it competes well with other bulk and bagged products available to homeowners, landscapers, farmers, and ranchers. Three methods of composting wastewater residuals into biosolids are common. Each method involves mixing dewatered wastewater solids with a bulking agent to provide carbon and increase porosity. The resulting mixture is piled or placed in a vessel where microbial activity causes the temperature of the mixture to rise during the “active composting” period. The specific temperatures that must be achieved and maintained for successful composting vary based on the method and use of the end product. After active composting, the material is cured and distributed. The three commonly employed composting methods are described in the following paragraphs. A fourth method (static pile) is not recommended for composting wastewater solids based on a lack of operational control. Aerated Static Pile- Dewatered cake is mechanically mixed with a <b>bulking</b> agent and <b>stacked</b> into long piles over a bed of pipes through which air is transferred to the composting material. After active composting, as the pile is starting to cool down, the material is moved into a curing pile...|$|R
40|$|Miniature, {{wireless}} {{radiation detector}} systems are potentially valuable for environmental and security monitoring. These systems can enable rapid deployment and dynamic reconfiguration of sensor networks. This thesis explores {{the design and}} manufacturing of wireless micromachined, gas-based radiation detectors, specifically targeting small form-factors. Two core concepts are investigated in this work: (1) leveraging existing micromachining technologies to design and manufacture miniaturized gas-based radiation detectors and (2) leveraging the radiation-induced microdischarges for wireless signaling purposes. Four micromachined detector structures are presented. Two test-structures target beta detection and two devices target beta/gamma detection. The test-structures for beta detection include <b>bulk</b> micromachined silicon/glass <b>stacks</b> with etched cavities, and planar, metal-on-glass structures. During operation, incident beta-particles ionize the fill-gas between the biased electrodes, resulting in avalanche current pulses or microdischarges measured as “counts”. These microdischarges can inherently transmit wideband RF content extending > 1 GHz. The impact of discharge gap-spacing, operating pressure, fill-gases, and electrode materials on operating voltage and wireless signaling performance is evaluated. The two detector designs targeting beta/gamma radiation use in-package assembly of stainless-steel electrodes and glass spacers, which leverage commercial processes and industry-standard packages, e. g., a TO- 5 header. The first beta/gamma design uses a single anode/cathode pair and is hermetically-sealed with an Ar fill-gas near 760 Torr. The second design uses an arrayed electrode structure to demonstrate a scalable path for increasing detection efficiency. At 30 cm from a 99 micro-Ci Cs- 137 source, count rates exceed 1. 3 cps. The calculated gamma sensitivity is 3. 79 cps/mR/hr, which is comparable to a commercial unit with 30 X greater detection volume. When normalized to sensitive volume, the single-stack and arrayed device demonstrate comparable gamma sensitivities. However, for a given form-factor, the arrayed detector outperforms the single-stack by ~ 6 X. Both designs demonstrate low background rates (5 - 8 cpm). Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) of these detector designs are described. The measured wireless signal spans 1. 25 GHz at receiving antenna-to-detector distances > 89 cm. Evaluation of deployment scenarios, e. g., integrating with mobile platforms or networked configurations, are presented, along with descriptions of portable powering modules...|$|R
