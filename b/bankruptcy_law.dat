40|$|How do <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>laws</b> as formal {{institutions}} affect entrepreneurship development {{around the}} world? Do entrepreneur-friendly <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>laws</b> encourage more entrepreneurship development at a societal level? We posit that if bankrupt entrepreneurs are excessively punished for failure, they may give up potentially high-return but inherently high-risk opportunities to start new businesses. Amassing a cross-country database from 29 countries spanning 19 Â years (1990 - 2008), {{we find that}} lenient, entrepreneur-friendly <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>laws</b> are significantly correlated {{with the level of}} entrepreneurship development as measured by the rate of new firm entry. <b>Bankruptcy</b> <b>laws</b> Entrepreneurship Institutions Institution-based view...|$|R

40|$|Using <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>laws</b> {{as a case}} {{of formal}} {{institutions}}, we show how formal institutions impact entrepreneurship development. Historically, <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>laws</b> usually have been harsh. Recently, many governments have realized that entrepreneur-friendly <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>laws</b> can not only lower exit barriers, but also lower entry barriers for entrepreneurs. Since <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>laws</b> are not uniform around the world, {{it is important to}} understand how they differ in their friendliness to entrepreneurs. This article focuses on six dimensions of entrepreneur-friendliness: (1) the availability of a reorganization bankruptcy option, (2) the time spent on bankruptcy procedures, (3) the cost of bankruptcy procedures, (4) the opportunity to have a fresh start in liquidation bankruptcy, (5) the opportunity to have an automatic stay of assets during reorganization bankruptcy, and (6) the opportunity for entrepreneurs and managers to remain on the job after filing for bankruptcy.

She taught at the University of Texas School of Law as visiting associate professor in 1981, and returned as a full professor two years later (staying 1983–87).

The Supreme Court ruled that a retroactively applied state <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>law</b> impaired the obligation to pay the debt, and therefore violated the Constitution. In Ogden v.
