5|$|A path, which {{contains}} data, usually organized in hierarchical form, that {{appears as a}} sequence of segments separated by slashes. Such a sequence may resemble or map exactly to a file system path, but does not always imply a relation to one. The path must begin with a single slash (/) if an authority part was present, and may also if one was not, but must not begin with a double slash. The path is always defined, though the defined path may <b>be</b> <b>empty</b> (zero length), therefore no trailing slash.|$|E
5|$|In 350 BCE, Greek philosopher Aristotle {{suggested}} that nature abhors a vacuum, a principle that {{became known as}} the horror vacui. This concept built upon a 5th-century BCE ontological argument by the Greek philosopher Parmenides, who denied the possible existence of a void in space. Based on this idea that a vacuum could not exist, in the West it was widely held for many centuries that space could not <b>be</b> <b>empty.</b> As late as the 17th century, the French philosopher Ren√© Descartes argued that the entirety of space must be filled.|$|E
5|$|Alveolar osteitis is a {{complication}} of tooth extraction (especially lower wisdom teeth) {{in which the}} blood clot is not formed or is lost, leaving the socket where the tooth used to <b>be</b> <b>empty,</b> and bare bone is exposed to the mouth. The pain is moderate to severe, and dull, aching, and throbbing in character. The pain is localized to the socket, and may radiate. It normally starts two to {{four days after the}} extraction, and may last 10‚Äì40 days. Healing is delayed, and it is treated with local anesthetic dressings, which are typically required for five to seven days. There is some evidence that chlorhexidine mouthwash used prior to extractions prevents alveolar osteitis.|$|E

5|$|Lisa {{attempts}} to find her brother by exploring the Squidport for clues. She learns from Grampa that black sedans that have been appearing around town are connected to Bart's disappearance, she also learns from Chief Wiggum that government-style agents have been appearing across the Squidport area. Lisa destroys the sedans, but finds them to <b>be</b> <b>empty.</b> After completing a task for the Sea Captain, she destroys a black limo but discovers Bart {{got out of it}} and boarded a ship. She finds Bart on the ship; he appears to have memory loss and is mumbling unintelligibly, as well as soiling his pants, while occasionally mentioning the sedans and Buzz Cola.|$|E
5|$|On November 18, 1992, Russian President Boris Yeltsin, in a {{goodwill}} {{gesture to}} South Korea {{during a visit}} to Seoul to ratify a new treaty, released both the flight data recorder (FDR) and cockpit voice recorder (CVR) of KAL007. Initial South Korean research showed the FDR to <b>be</b> <b>empty</b> and the CVR to have an unintelligible copy. The Russians then released the recordings to the ICAO Secretary General. The ICAO report continued to support the initial assertion that KAL007 accidentally flew in Soviet airspace, after listening to the flight crew's conversations recorded by the CVR, and confirming that either the aircraft had flown on a constant magnetic heading instead of activating the INS and following its assigned waypoints, or, if it had activated the INS, it had been activated when the aircraft had already deviated beyond the 7¬Ω-nautical mile Desired Track Envelope within which the waypoints would have been captured.|$|E
5|$|Plavalaguna {{is killed}} when the Mangalores attack the cruise ship, but Dallas succeeds in {{retrieving}} the stones from the Diva. During his {{struggle with the}} Mangalores he kills their leader. Meanwhile, Zorg arrives, shooting and seriously wounding Leeloo before taking a carrying case that he presumes contains the stones back to his spacecraft, leaving behind a time bomb that forces the liner's occupants to evacuate. Discovering the case to <b>be</b> <b>empty,</b> Zorg returns to the ship and deactivates his bomb, but a dying Mangalore sets off his own device, destroying the ship and killing Zorg. Dallas, Cornelius, Leeloo, and talk-show host Ruby Rhod escape with the stones aboard Zorg's spacecraft.|$|E

They realize that Shaw used his money to buy gold, turn it into car parts, and assembled the car to hide the money in plain sight. Josh then finds a ledger of Shaw's illegal finances in the car's glove box.|$|E

25|$|An empty list is a {{list that}} {{contains}} no data records. This is usually the same as saying that it has zero nodes. If sentinel nodes are being used, the list is usually said to <b>be</b> <b>empty</b> when it has only sentinel nodes.|$|E
25|$|The set of axioms may <b>be</b> <b>empty,</b> a nonempty finite set, a countably {{infinite}} set, or {{be given}} by axiom schemata.

25|$|Note {{that the}} set D may <b>be</b> <b>empty.</b> This {{would mean that}} every natural number x maps {{to a set of}} natural numbers that {{contains}} x.

25|$|In {{contemporary}} mathematical logic, {{the signature}} varies by application. Typical signatures in mathematics are {1, √ó} or just {√ó} for groups, or {0, 1, +, √ó, <} for ordered fields.
