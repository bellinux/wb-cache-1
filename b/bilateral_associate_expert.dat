40|$|Expert {{systems can}} be used to govern the {{intelligent}} control of vehicles, for example the Robotic Air Vehicle (RAV). Due {{to the nature of the}} RAV system the <b>associated</b> <b>expert</b> system needs to perform in a demanding real-time environment. The use of a parallel processing capability to support the <b>associated</b> <b>expert</b> system's computational requirement is critical in this application. Thus, algorithms for parallel real-time expert systems must be designed, analyzed, and synthesized. The design process incorporates a consideration of the rule-set/face-set size along with representation issues. These issues are looked at in reference to information movement and various inference mechanisms. Also examined is the process involved with transporting the RAV expert system functions from the TI Explorer, where they are implemented in the Automated Reasoning Tool (ART), to the iPSC Hypercube, where the system is synthesized using Concurrent Common LISP (CCLISP). The transformation process for the ART to CCLISP conversion is described. The performance characteristics of the parallel implementation of these expert systems on the iPSC Hypercube are compared to the TI Explorer implementation...|$|R

The syndrome is characterized by severe intermittent or persistent flank pain, either unilateral or <b>bilateral,</b> <b>associated</b> with gross or microscopic hematuria. LPHS is a diagnosis of exclusion as there still is not a consensus of validated diagnostic criteria, though several criteria have been proposed. Thewide differential diagnosiswould suggest ameticulous yet specific diagnostic work-up depending on the individual clinical features and natural history. Several mechanisms regarding the pathophysiology of LPHS have been proposed but without pinpointing the actual causative etiology, the treatment remains symptomatic.

Since 1950 when the Korean War ended, it was undoubtedly clear that the socioeconomic status of South Korea was in its deepest downturn.
