40|$|In {{this study}} we {{developed}} an effective novel method for reducing the variability in the output of different artificial neural network (ANN) configurations that have the same overall performance {{as measured by the}} area under their receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. This variability can lead to inaccuracies in the interpretation of results when the outputs are employed as classification predictors. We extended a method previously proposed to reduce the variability in the performance of a classifier with data sets from different institutions to the outputs of ANN configurations. Our approach is based on histogram shaping of the outputs of all ANN configurations to resemble the output histogram of a baseline ANN configuration. We tested the effectiveness of the technique using synthetic data generated from two two-dimensional isotropic Gaussian distributions and 100 ANN configurations. The proposed output calibration technique significantly reduced the median standard deviation of the ANN outputs from 0. 010 <b>before</b> <b>calibration</b> to 0. 006 after calibration. The standard deviation of the sensitivity of the 100 ANN configurations at the same decision threshold reduced significantly from 0. 005 <b>before</b> <b>calibration</b> to 0. 003 after calibration.

40|$|Background and objectiveBlood {{oxygenation}} level-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI) {{has been}} extensively used as a marker of brain dysfunction and subsequent recovery following stroke. However, growing evidence suggests that straightforward interpretation of BOLD fMRI changes with aging and disease is challenging. In this study, we investigated the effect of calibrating task fMRI data by applying a hemodynamic calibration method using the resting-state fluctuation amplitude (RSFA). Task fMRI responses were obtained during a covert verbal fluency task {{in a group of}} early stage stroke patients and matched healthy normal controls. MethodsFifteen acute left hemisphere stroke patients (less than 7 [*]days from stroke; aged 44 – 84 [*]years, average ~ 64 [*]years) and 21 healthy controls (aged 55 – 77 [*]years, average ~ 61 [*]years) were prospectively studied. All subjects completed a 3 -min covert verbal fluency task, and a 10 -min eyes-closed resting-state fMRI scan, from which the calibration factor (RSFA) was computed. A behavioral measure on the verbal fluency task was also collected outside the scanner. Whole brain activation volumes and region-of-interest (ROI) -wise percent signal change and activation volumes before and after calibration were computed. ResultsBetween-group differences in whole brain activation volumes, although statistically significant <b>before</b> <b>calibration</b> failed to be significant after calibration. There were significant within-group differences before and after calibration with RSFA. Statistically significant between-group differences on ROI-wise measures <b>before</b> <b>calibration</b> also significantly reduced after calibration. Exploratory brain-behavior correlations revealed a similar pattern: significant correlations <b>before</b> <b>calibration</b> failed to survive after calibration. Discussion and conclusionBOLD fMRI changes with aging and disease is confounded by changes in neurofunctional coupling leading to challenges in the straightforward interpretation of task fMRI results. Application of the hemodynamic calibration using the RSFA technique in the current study appeared to mitigate any differences between stroke and age-matched healthy controls. Our study indicates that estimating neural activity after applying hemodynamic scaling is important for studies of aging and for studies tracking post-stroke changes. We recommend that further investigation of hemodynamic calibration with RSFA in healthy subjects and in stroke in larger samples is necessary...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Simultaneous {{real-time}} fluoroscopic {{and nuclear}} imaging could benefit image-guided (oncological) procedures. To this end, a hybrid modality {{is currently being}} developed by our group, by combining a c-arm with a gamma camera and a four-pinhole collimator. Accurate determination of the system parameters that describe {{the position of the}} x-ray tube, x-ray detector, gamma camera, and collimators is crucial to optimize image quality. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop a calibration method that estimates the system parameters used for reconstruction. A multimodality phantom consisting of five point sources was created. First, nuclear and fluoroscopic images of the phantom were acquired at several distances from the image intensifier. The system parameters were acquired using physical measurement, and multimodality images of the phantom were reconstructed. The resolution and co-registration error of the point sources were determined as a measure of image quality. Next, the system parameters were estimated using a calibration method, which adjusted the parameters in the reconstruction algorithm, until the resolution and co-registration were optimized. For evaluation, multimodality images of a second set of phantom acquisitions were reconstructed using calibrated parameter sets. Subsequently, the resolution and co-registration error of the point sources were determined as a measure of image quality. This procedure was performed five times for different noise simulations. In addition, simultaneously acquired fluoroscopic and nuclear images of two moving syringes were obtained with parameter sets from before and after calibration. RESULTS: The mean FWHM was significantly lower after calibration than <b>before</b> <b>calibration</b> for 21 out of 25 point sources.

40|$|The Nintendo Wii balance board (WBB) has {{generated}} significant interest in its application as a postural control measurement device {{in both the}} clinical and (basic, clinical, and rehabilitation) research domains. Although the WBB has been proposed {{as an alternative to}} the “gold standard” laboratory-grade force plate, additional research is necessary before the WBB can be considered a valid and reliable center of pressure (CoP) measurement device. In this study, we used the WBB and a laboratory-grade AMTI force plate (AFP) to simultaneously measure the CoP displacement of a controlled dynamic load, which has not been done before. A one-dimensional inverted pendulum was displaced at several different displacement angles and load heights to simulate a variety of postural sway amplitudes and frequencies (< 1 Hz). Twelve WBBs were tested to address the issue of inter-device variability. There was a significant effect of sway amplitude, frequency, and direction on the WBB’s CoP measurement error, with an increase in error as both sway amplitude and frequency increased and a significantly greater error in the mediolateral (ML) (compared to the anteroposterior (AP)) sway direction. There was no difference in error across the 12 WBB’s, supporting low inter-device variability. A linear calibration procedure was then implemented to correct the WBB’s CoP signals and reduce measurement error. There was a significant effect of calibration on the WBB’s CoP signal accuracy, with a significant reduction in CoP measurement error (quantified by root-mean-squared error) from 2 – 6 mm (<b>before</b> <b>calibration)</b> to 0. 5 – 2 mm (after calibration). WBB-based CoP signal calibration also significantly reduced the percent error in derived (time-domain) CoP sway measures, from − 10. 5 % (<b>before</b> <b>calibration)</b> to − 0. 05 % (after calibration) (percent errors averaged across all sway measures and in both sway directions). In this study, we characterized the WBB’s CoP measurement error under controlled, dynamic conditions and implemented a linear calibration procedure for WBB CoP signals that is recommended to reduce CoP measurement error and provide more reliable estimates of time-domain CoP measures. Despite our promising results, additional work is necessary to understand how our findings translate to the clinical and rehabilitation research domains. Once the WBB’s CoP measurement error is fully characterized in human postural sway (which differs from our simulated postural sway in both amplitude and frequency content), it may be used to measure CoP displacement in situations where lower accuracy and precision is acceptable...|$|E
40|$|Synthetic {{aperture}} {{radar polarimetry}} {{is one of}} the current developments in the field of remote sensing, due to the ability of delivering more information on the physical properties of the surface. It is known as the science of acquiring, processing and analysing the polarisation state in an electromagnetic field. The increase of information with respect to scalar radar comes at a price, not only for the high cost of building the radar system and processing the data or increasing the complexity of the design, but also for the amount of effort needed to calibrate the data. Synthetic aperture radar polarimetric calibration is an essential pre- processing stage for the correction of distortion interference which is caused by the system inaccuracies as well as atmospheric effects. Our goal, with this thesis, is to use multiple passive point targets to establish the difference between fully, and compact polarimetric synthetic aperture radar systems on both calibration, and the effects of penetration. First, we detail the selection, design, manufacture, and deployment of different passive point targets in the field for acquiring X- and P-band synthetic aperture radar data in the Netherlands. We started by presenting the selection and design of multiple passive point targets. These were a combination of classic trihedral and dihedral corner reflectors, as well as gridded trihedral and dihedral corner reflectors. Additionally, we detailed the construction of these corner reflectors. The number of constructed corner reflector totalled sixteen, where six are for X-band and six for P-band, as well as four gridded corner reflectors for X-band. Finally, we present the deployment of the corner reflectors at three different sites with carefully surveyed and oriented positions. a Then, we present the calibration of three different fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar sensors. The first sensor is the L-band synthetic aperture radar sensor and we acquired data using two square trihedral corner reflectors. The calibration includes an evaluation of two crosstalk methods, which are the Quegan and the Ainsworth methods. The results showed that the crosstalk parameters for the Quegan method are all between - 17 dB to - 21 dB <b>before</b> <b>calibration,</b> while there is a small improvement in the range of 3 dB after calibration. While the Ainsworth method shows around - 20 dB <b>before</b> <b>calibration,</b> and around - 40 dB after calibration. Moreover, the phase, channel imbalance, and radiometric calibration were corrected using the two corner reflectors. Furthermore, the other two synthetic aperture radar sensors are X- and P-band synthetic aperture radar sensors, and we acquired polarimetric data using our sixteen corner reflectors. The calibration includes the crosstalk estimation, and correction using the Ainsworth method and the results showed the crosstalk parameters <b>before</b> <b>calibration</b> for X-band are around - 23 dB, and they are around - 43 dB after calibration, while crosstalk parameters <b>before</b> <b>calibration</b> for P-band are around - 10 dB, and they are around - 30 dB after calibration. The calibration also includes the phase, channel imbalance, and radiometric calibration, as well as geometric correction and signal noise ration measurement, for both X- and P-band. Next, we present the performance of gridded trihedral and dihedral corner reflectors using an X-band synthetic aperture radar system. The results showed both gridded trihedral and dihedral reflectors are perfect targets for correcting the amplitude compared to classical corner reflectors; however, {{it is not possible to}} use the gridded reflectors to correct the phase as we need a return from two channels to have a zero-phase difference between the polarisation channels H - V. Furthermore, we detail the compact polarimetric calibration over three com- pact polarimetric modes using a square trihedral corner reflector for the X-band dataset. The results showed no change in the π/mode while a 90 ᵒ phase bias showed in the CTLR mode. Finally, the DCP mode showed a 64. 43 ° phase difference, and it was corrected to have a zero phase, and the channel imbalance was very high at 45. 92, the channels were adjusted to have a channel imbalance of 1. b Finally, an experiment to measure the penetration and reduction of P-band signal from a synthetic aperture radar system was performed using two triangular trihedral corner reflectors. Both of them have 1. 5 m inner leg dimensions. The first triangular trihedral corner reflector was deployed in a deciduous grove of trees, while the other one was deployed a 10 m distance away on a grass covered field. After system calibration based on the reflector in the clear, the results showed a reduction of 0. 6 dB in the HH channel, with 2. 28 dB in the W channel. The larger attenuation at W is attributable to the vertical structure of the trees. Additionally, we measured the polarimetric degradation of the triangular trihedral corner reflector immersed in vegetation (trees). Further, after calibration, the co-polarisation phase difference is zero degrees for the triangular corner reflector which was outside the trees, and 62. 85 ᵒ for the corner reflector inside the trees.

Evaluation tests included X-ray shadowgraphs, <b>calibrations</b> <b>before</b> and after aging, and time constant measurements. Two wire-wound low thermal mass probes {{of a conventional}} design were chosen as most suitable for this cryogenic wind tunnel application...|$|R
40|$|This work {{discusses}} the calibration of instantaneous Libor correlations in the Libor market model. We extend the existing calibration strategies by {{the incorporation of}} spread option implied correlation information. The correlation structure implied by constant maturity swap (CMS) spread options observed in the present-day market motivates us to extend the existing parameterizations of ratio correlations by a new three-parameter approach. For the first time, this paper presents an extensive empirical study of different parameterizations and their capability to match market correlations. We can show that our approach leads to stable calibrations and gives a satisfactory fit to the market. We conclude our investigation with the pricing of a callable swap on CMS spread using the parameterizations compared <b>before.</b> LMM, <b>calibration,</b> correlation, market analysis, CMS spread option,...|$|R
