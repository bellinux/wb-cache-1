The type section of the Kapitean Stage and four other sections in north Westland were examined in detail. The stratigraphy of each section is described and the distribution of 300 species of Foraminifera and 38 species of Mollusca from the Upper Tongaporutuan and Kapitean is discussed. Neogene sediments, previously classed as "Blue Bottom" are separated into four formations. Six zones based on Foraminifera form an essentially continuous sequence ranging from Upper Miocene to Pliocene in age. Four zones based on Mollusca correspond to four of the foraminiferal zones. Depth of deposition for each formation is inferred from paleoecology and a geological history is inferred for the Upper Miocene and Pliocene in north Westland. The type Kapitean and the Kapitean throughout north Westland consists of relatively shallow-water facies. From this study it could not be correlated satisfactorily with deep-water facies elsewhere in New Zealand and its relationship to the Bolivinita compressa Zone could not be determined. The taxonomy of one hundred and five species of Foraminifera is discussed and seven species are described as new: Textularia barnwelli, Quinqueloculina waimea, Virgulina vellai, Florilus olsoni, Notorotalia macinnesi, Globorotalia conomiozea and Cibicides gibsoni. A gradational <b>bioseries</b> of Hofkeruva is described and the evolution and first occurrence of Globorotalia crassaformis (Galloway & Wissler) is discussed. II. About 350 ft. of Kapitean beds exposed in sea cliffs at Cape Foulwind, West Coast, are conformably overlain by Opoitian and Conformably underlain by Tongaporutuan. Seven foraminiferal samples were collected from a uniform and continuous section of marine siltstone. A lithological column and a foraminiferal range chart are presented. Paleoecology and stratigraphic paleontology are discussed. III. At Cape Foulwind specimens of Textularia kapitea Finlay from Six samples show a well defined evolutionary change with time. Two subspecies, one of early to middle Kapitean and one of late Kapitean to early Opoitian age, are established Textularia miozea appears to be the ancestor of T. kapitea. IV. Upper Miocene to Pliocene strata in north Westland and Marlborough contain abundant fossils representing a <b>bioseries</b> of planktonic Foraminifera showing gradual progressive morphological changes. The <b>bioseries</b> commenced with Globorotalia miozea Finlay and ended with Globorotalia crassformis (Galloway and Wissler). The form representing the intermediate stage of the <b>bioseries</b> at Marlborough, differs slightly from the corresponding form at north Westland, 150 miles to the south-west, but the end form is the same in both areas. V. In Marlborough, two stratigraphic sections ranging from Middle Tongaporutuan to Opoitian (Upper Miocene to Lower Pliocene) in age were examined. They lie only 5 miles apart, but one is predominantly deep-water facies and the other is predominantly shallow water facies. Ranges of Foraminifera and Mollusca are shown on charts and local foraminiferal and molluscan zones are established. By correlating key horizons in these sections it has been possible to determine relative stratigraphic ranges of important deep-water and shallow-water fossils, including key Foraminifera and the Kapitean key Mollusca. The base of the Kapitean Stage in the shallow-water section is marked by the first appearance of the key Kapitean Mollusca. The corresponding horizon in the deep-water section can be defined by an evolutionary stage of the Globorotalia crassaformis <b>bioseries.</b> The Kapitean Stage is shown to be relatively thin and to be equivalent to about the upper half of the Bolivinita compressa Zone that is found only in deep-water facies. Paleoecological changes indicate significant changes in depth of deposition in both sections and these depth changes were almost certainly synchronous. The sea was relatively shallow during the Kapitean Age. The biostratigraphic divisions are closely related to the changes in depth of deposition. VI. Six sections through the Upper Miocene and Lower Pliocene in Wairarapa and southern Hawkes Bay were examined in detail. Ranges of Foraminifera and Mollusca are given for each section and lithologies are shown on columnar sections. For the stratigraphic interval from Upper Tongaporutuan to Opoitian, two parallel sets of zones are recognized. One set of zones is based of Foraminifera and is applicable mainly to deep-water facies and the other is based on Mollusca and is applicable only to shallow-water facies. Diagnostic species for each zone are listed. In shallow-water facies the Kapitean Stage is determined mainly by the presence of Sectipecten wollastoni. In deep-water facies which lack the key Mollusca, it is determined by means of the Globorotalia crassaformis <b>bioseries.</b> The absence of the Kapitean in two of the sections is shown mainly by the absence of the characteristic Kapitean parts of the G. crassaformis <b>bioseries</b> and the Siphotextularia wairoana <b>bioseries.</b> The paleoecology throughout each section is described, and indicates that at most places the sea was relatively shallow during the Kapitean Age. VII. Four eastern North Island sections through the Upper Miocene and Lower Pliocene were examined: at Maraetotara River, central Hawkes Bay; at Ruakituri River, northern Hawkes Bay; at Waimata river, Gisborne; and near Te Araroa, East Cape. Distribution of Foraminifera is shown on charts, and lithologies are shown on columnar sections. Four well defined biostratigraphic units can be recognised for the Foraminifera, from oldest to youngest; Pohana Zone, Compressa Zone, Conomiozea Zone, and Crassaformis Zone. Diagnostic Species are listed for each of these zones. In one section the Kapitean Stage is represented by shallow-water facies and is marked by the key Kapitean Mollusca. In two sections it is represented by deep-water facies and is determined by means of the Globorotalia crassaformis <b>bioseries.</b> In the fourth section, the absence of uppermost Upper Tongaporutuan, Kapitean and basal Opoitian is shown by the absence of part of the G. crassaformis <b>bioseries.</b> The paleoecology throughout each section is described, and indicates that the sea shallowed {{near the end of the}} Tongaporutuan Age, remained shallow during the Kapitean Age and deepened again at the beginning of the Opoitian Age. VIII. The stratigraphic ranges in inland Taranaki are given for some important Foraminifera relative to those of the Mollusca Sectipecten grangei and S. wollastoni. IX. The following fourteen new species of fossil Foraminifera are described and illustrated from the Upper Miocene and Lower Pliocene of New Zealand: Textularia crater, Siphotextularia dawesi, Ruakituria pseudorobusta, Karreriella fasigatus, Arenodosaria turris, Vaginulinopsis carinata, Bolivinita finlayi, Brizalina srinivasani, Kolesnikovella zealandica, Discorbinella hamasuturalis, Notorotalia mammiligera, Cibicides porrodeliquatus, Cibicides teararus and Pleurostomella parviapertura. Known stratigrahic ranges and inferred depth ranges are given for each species. The new genus Ruakituria (Ataxophragmiidae) is erected for the species formerly know as Dorothia robusta Keyzer. X. The salient features of New Zealand Upper Miocene and Lower Pliocene microfaunas are outlined, and criteria for recognising the Kapitean Stage are summarized. Paleoecology suggests that he Kapitean Stage represents an interval of time when seas were relatively shallow, that the shallowing took place in the latest part of the Tongaporutuan Age and that deepening took place in the earliest part of the Opoitian Age. The changes in depth of sea caused many temporary "facies" changes in fossil faunas at any particular places, but the Kapitean Stage is soundly based on a few permanent changes of both macrofauna and microfauna. The Kapitean Stage is represented by fairly shallow-water facies at many places but by fairly deep-water facies at other places. Shallow-water and deep-water facies contain very few age diagnostic fossils in common, but can be correlated by means of the Globorotalia crassaformis <b>bioseries,</b> a sequence of planktonic Foraminifera showing gradual progressive morphological change. In nearly all sections the Kapitean Stage is thin compared with the overlying Opoitian and underlying Upper Tongaporutuan, and this is attributed to a decreased rate of deposition due to shallowing and increased by-passing of sediment. Kapitean microfaunas show a slight but distinct change from north to south, this being attributed to latitudinal temperature difference. The previously suggested correlation of the Kapitean Stage with the Pontian Stage of Europe is probably correct. The shallow seas during the Kapitean Age in New Zealand appear to have coincided with a phase of regression in Europe and in other parts of the world and may have a eustatic rather than a tectonic cause...|$|E
40|$|The {{integral}} membrane proteins of Sendai virus, haemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and {{fusion protein}} (F) were extracted from purified virions with a non-ionic and two zwitterionic detergents, i. e [...] pentaethylene glycol monolauryl ether (C- 12 E 5), lauryldimethylamine oxide (LDAO) and dodecyldimethylammoniopropane- 1 -sulphonate (SB 12), respectively. The extracts {{were subjected to}} ion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography (HPIEC) using 0. 1 % of the detergent in the eluent on four different columns (MA 7 Q, Zorbax <b>BioSeries</b> SAX, Mono Q and PL-SAX) with a quaternary amine as interacting ligand and with different pore sizes: non-porous and 30. 80 nm and 400 nm, respectively. The relative recoveries of protein were similar for all the columns. The highest recovery of HN and F protein and the best separation were obtained with C- 12 E 5. Analysis of HPIEC fractions with monoclonal antibodies directed against conformational epitopes showed that C- 13 E 5 had less effect on the conformation {{than the other two}} detergents...|$|E
40|$|Globorotalia assemblages are studied from Pliocene {{deposits}} in Crete (Greece), Italy, the Gulf of Mexico region, and New Zealand. In each assemblage counts and measurements {{were performed on}} 10 test characters. The taxonomy is based on (1) biconvex or planoconvex shape, (2) "growth" patterns of size ratios, (3) frequency distributions of discrete characters on the test. Attention {{is given to the}} treatment of such quantitative data. The assemblages have been collected in five groups named after typologically defined species: (1) margaritae group, (2) crassaformis group, (3) puncticulata group, (4) bononiensis group, and (5) inflata group. Each group is illustrated by means of a number of scanning electron microscope photographs; some attention is drawn to wall structures. The puncticulata, bononiensis, and inflata groups occur in stratigraphic order; the ranges do not overlap. In Crete an incidental morphological transition was observed between the bononiensis group and the inflata group. In the Mediterranean the association of the margaritae group and the puncticulata group is restricted to the Lower Pliocene (Tabianian). The puncticulata group ranges slightly higher in the stratigraphic column than does the margaritae group. The upper part of the range of the puncticulata group, the total range of the bononiensis group, and {{the lower part of the}} range of the inflata group are indicative of the Middle-Upper Pliocene (Piacenzian). The crassaformis group occurs throughout the Pliocene. In the Gulf of Mexico region the puncticulata and bononiensis groups were not observed. The occurrence of the margaritae group and the beginning of the inflata group may be used for stratigraphic correlations. The crassaformis group displays trends, but it may be doubted if the zigzag path of this group is stratigraphically useful, except perhaps on a local scale. Assemblages of a New Zealand G. crassaformis <b>bioseries</b> show no resemblance to our crassaformis group...|$|E
40|$|Late Neogene planktonic foraminifera {{have been}} {{examined}} at Site 310 in the Central North Pacific and their stratigraphic ranges and frequencies are presented here. Blow's (1969) zonation developed for tropical regions has been applied where applicable. Where tropical index taxa are rare or absent in this temperate region, Globorotalia crassaformis, and the evolutionary <b>bioseries</b> G. conoidea - G. conomiozea and G. puncticulata - G. inflata have been found useful for zonal subdivisions. A correlation between stratigraphic ranges and frequency distributions of these species at Site 310 in the Central North Pacific, and Site 284 in the Southwest Pacific indicates that these species are relatively consistent biostratigraphic markers in temperate regions of both the North and South Pacific Oceans. An informal zonation for temperate latitudes of the Southwest Pacific has been established by Kennett (1973) and a similar zonal subdivision can be made at Site 310. Paleoclimatic/paleoceanographic interpretations based on coiling ratios, percent abundance, and phenotypic variations of Neogloboquadrina pachyderma indicate four major cold events during early, middle, and late Pliocene, and early Pleistocene. Faunal correlations of these events with similar events elsewhere in the Northeast and Southwest Pacific which have been paleomagnetically dated indicate the following approximate ages for these cold events: 4. 7 Ma, 3. 0 Ma, 2. 6 - 1. 8 Ma, and 1. 2 Ma. Faunal assemblages have been divided into three groups representing cool, intermediate, and warmer water assemblages. Cool water assemblages are dominated by ~ 60 % N. pachyderma; intermediate temperature faunas are dominated by species of Globigerina and Globigerinita and contain between 20 % and 30 % N. pachyderma. Warmer water assemblages are dominated by species of Globorotalia and contain < 10 % N. pachyderma. Frequency oscillations within these groups, in addition to paleotemperature parameters evident in N. pachyderma, afford refined paleoclimatic/paleoceanographic interpretations...|$|E
40|$|Oxygen isotope {{data are}} {{compared}} with relative abundances of selected planktic foraminifera through a ca. 15 m interval at DSDP Site 593 (Tasman Sea, southwest Pacific, 40 °S) {{in which there}} are prominent changes in population sizes, as well as several evolutionary events. We focus on the relation between faunal and climatic histories. The base of early Miocene oxygen isotope Zone Mi 1 b (uppermost planktic foraminiferal Zone N. 6) is identified from closesampled (c. 14 kyr) isotope records of Globigerina woodi and Cibicides kullenbergi. Chronostratigraphic interpolations, using the first occurrences of Globorotalia praescitula, G. mimea and Praeorbulina curva give an age estimate of ca. 18. 4 Ma (cf. 18. 1 - 18. 3 Ma for the base of the zone at DSDP Site 608 (type level, north Atlantic, 43 °N)). Another significant benthic delta 18 O enrichment event, informally designated as the base of zone "Mi 1 c", is identified 10 m higher in the sequence at ca. 17. 8 Ma. Populations of Globoquadriau dehiscens and Globigerinoides trilobus (inferred to be near the southern margin of their distributions) either reduced considerably or withdrew, particularly in the vicinity of zone "Mi 1 c". A <b>bioseries</b> linking Globorotalia incognita with G. zealandica developed following the benthic delta 18 O enrichment spike at the base of Zone Mi 1 b; the latter species became extinct (at least regionally) just above the base of zone "Mi 1 c". In contrast, the apparently opportunistic Globorotlia praescitula increased dramatically in abundance at this time; there were also transformations in its architecture, leading to the evolutionary appearance of G. miozea. While planktic foraminifera abundances often do not closely covary with the detailed isotope records and tend to be more stable through time, the near coincidence of evolutionary and biogeographic events with isotopic events suggests at least indirect adaptive responses to climatic changes. Early Miocene middle-latitude planktic foraminiferal evolution, biogeography, and biostratigraphy, may be intimately connected with climatic history...|$|E
40|$|In the 1940 s the Cenozoic {{molluscan}} {{record was}} ceding to the foraminiferal as main biostratigraphic driver. The central scientific {{problems for the}} stratigraphy of the Cenozoic Erathem in southern Australia were a patchy biostratigraphic succession, very few links with the tropical IndoPacific region and the classical sections of Europe, and a fragile sense of stratigraphic relationships within and between the various sedimentary basins in southern Australia. In more specific terms the stratigraphic problems were (or were about to emerge as) the Miocene/Pliocene hiatus, {{the evolution of the}} Orbulina <b>bioseries</b> and the age of the Orbulina surface, the recognition and correlation of Oligocene strata, and discovering and dating fossil assemblages below the Upper Eocene. M. F. Glaessner at the University of Adelaide's Geology Department and N. H. Ludbrook at the Geological Survey of South Australia made and led substantial progress in these matters, and Glaessner also stimulated research in foraminiferal morphology and evolutionary taxonomy. The progress occurred in feedback with shifts in scientific style and emphasis. Glaessner brought a new rigour to the recognition of microfossil assemblages and events and the relationship of bio-zones to chrono-stages. Exploiting the superb collection by W. J. Parr, A. N. Carter laid the groundwork with a biozoning of the Upper Eocene to Middle Miocene composite succession, employing a mix of benthic and planktonic events. M. Wade developed strong insights into the internal morphology of foraminiferal shells and its taxonomic significance, the relationships between morphospecies as biological species and morphospecies as pragmatic biostratigraphic tools, and correlating across the tropical-temperate transitions through the Cenozoic. J. M. Lindsay developed subsurface stratigraphic micropalaeontology in hydrogeology and engineering geology into a fine art, sharpened the delineation of the Miocene-Pliocene unconformity, did most to solve the Oligocene problem and (with Ludbrook) strengthened the Eocene-Miocene biozonation. By ~ 1970 there was a perceptual shift from species' ranges, in which implicitly imperfect records are linked, to species' occurrences including datums. The shift clarified insights into such geohistorical phenomena as climatic shifts and transgressions and regressions. It was encouraged by the first persuasive, numerically calibrated geological time scale. Micropalaeontology continued and stratigraphic horizons expanded in both institutions but the first two decades comprise a natural phase in Adelaide. Brian Mcgowra...|$|E
