5|$|During a {{surprise}} {{inspection of the}} Springfield Nuclear Power Plant from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Homer is placed in a test module van that simulates an emergency. He {{has no idea what}} to do and starts pressing buttons at random, somehow causing a nuclear meltdown even though there was no nuclear material inside the van. The NRC officials tell Mr. Burns that Homer's job requires college training in nuclear physics, and that he must go back to college to keep his job. Homer is rejected by every college he applies to, <b>but</b> <b>Mr.</b> Burns helps him get into Springfield University.|$|E
5|$|Facts were {{overwhelmed}} with sound, passion substituted for arithmetic, moral indignation pumped {{up to the}} bursting point. <b>But</b> <b>Mr.</b> Diefenbaker provided the liveliest show of the election... and many listeners undoubtedly failed to notice that he was saying even less than the Prime Minister, though saying it more shrilly and with evangelistic fervour... Mr. Diefenbaker has chosen instead to cast himself as the humble man in a mood of protest, the common Canadian outraged by Liberal prosperity, the little guy fighting for his rights.|$|E
5|$|Shawn Michaels was {{suspended}} in late 1993 {{and forced to}} vacate the Intercontinental Championship, while Mr. Perfect began a feud with Diesel. The WWF planned to have Perfect and Diesel face each other {{as part of an}} elimination match at Survivor Series 1993, <b>but</b> <b>Mr.</b> Perfect was replaced by Randy Savage at the last minute. Mr. Perfect would not wrestle another pay per view match for the company until Royal Rumble 2002.|$|E
60|$|At this {{suggestion}} I laughed outright. <b>But</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Lecks reproved me.|$|R

5|$|The next {{match was}} the World Tag Team Championship match. The Headshrinkers gained the early advantage, <b>but</b> <b>Mr.</b> Fuji helped his team by hitting Fatu with the Japanese flag. Yokozuna {{performed}} a leg drop on Fatu, but Samu {{was able to}} tag in. All four wrestlers fought in the ring before the brawl moved to the arena floor. Crush performed a superplex on Samu, but Lex Luger came to ringside and distracted Crush. This allowed Samu to attempt a roll-up. Crush recovered, but Fatu tagged in and pinned Crush to retain the belts.|$|E
5|$|The first WWF World Heavyweight Championship match came next, as Lex Luger {{challenged}} Yokozuna. Mr. Perfect {{was revealed}} to be the guest referee for the match, while Donnie Wahlberg was the guest ring announcer and Rhonda Shear was the guest timekeeper. After a verbal confrontation between Luger and Yokozuna, Luger gained the early advantage by knocking Yokozuna out of the ring. After getting back into the ring, Yokozuna removed the turnbuckle padding from {{a corner of the}} ring. Yokozuna used a nerve hold and a belly to belly suplex to wear down Luger. As he tried to throw Luger's head into the exposed turnbuckle, however, Luger blocked him and hit Yokozuna's head into the turnbuckle. Luger then performed clotheslines and a powerslam on Yokozuna before knocking Yokozuna kayfabe unconscious with a running forearm smash. Yokozuna's managers, Mr. Fuji and Jim Cornette jumped onto the ring apron to distract Luger, and Luger pulled them into the ring and attacked them. Luger covered Yokozuna, <b>but</b> <b>Mr.</b> Perfect was tending to the fallen managers and did not make the count. When Luger pushed him, Mr. Perfect disqualified Luger and left the ring, thereby turning heel.|$|E
25|$|On 4 February 1867, he {{published}} {{the principle of}} reaction in the dynamo-electric machine by a paper to the Royal Society; <b>but</b> <b>Mr.</b> C. W. Siemens had communicated the identical discovery ten days earlier, and both papers were read on the same day.|$|E

25|$|Mrs. Barnett survives the burglary, <b>but</b> <b>Mr.</b> Barnett dies. The sheriff arrests T.J. and Cassie {{realizes that}} Papa set {{the fire to}} save T.J. Stacey asks what T.J.'s fate will be. Papa replies {{that he will be}} convicted of Mr. Barnett's murder and may be executed. Cassie, {{overwhelmed}} by the news, silently goes to bed. Although Cassie never liked T.J., she cries for him and the land.|$|E
25|$|About {{halfway through}} the war the CIA {{approached}} Mr. Arnett. They believed that the Iraqi military was operating a high-level communication network from {{the basement of the}} Al Rashid Hotel, which is where Mr. Arnett and a few others from CNN were staying. The CIA wanted him out so the Air Force could bomb the hotel, <b>but</b> <b>Mr.</b> Arnett refused. He said he had been given a tour of the hotel and denied there was such a facility.|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Rowan {{explained}} that she herself {{did not wish to}} come to any absolute or immediate rupture with Mrs. Tappitt. Of course their visit would be shortened, <b>but</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Tappitt was disposed to be very civil, as were the girls. Then Mrs. Rowan suggested whether there might not be a reconciliation between Luke and the brewery family.|$|R

25|$|At Cheltenham College, {{where he}} was educated, they tell of a smart bit of fielding which he did when the M.C.C. played the College Eleven one year. He was bowling to George Hearne, who stepped back and pulled him twice between the wicket and mid-on. The third ball was bowled in the same place, and Hearne pulled it again; <b>but</b> <b>Mr.</b> Strachan moved a yard or two when he saw him {{make up his mind}} to hit in the same way, and brought off a {{remarkable}} catch yards from the wicket.|$|E
25|$|In {{this society}} he soon became known to and patronized {{by people of}} the first rank, and was in names or {{intimacy}} with many of them; particularly the Earl of Burlington, so well known for his taste in the fine arts, especially architecture. For him he painted, among others, a large picture {{of the royal family}} of England: in the middle compartment are all the younger branches of the family on a very large canvas, and on one hand above the door a half length of her majesty Queen Caroline; the picture of the king was intended to fill the niche opposite to it, <b>but</b> <b>Mr.</b> Aikman's death happening before it was begun, the place for it is left blank. This picture came into the possession of the Duke of Devonshire, whose father married Lady Mary Boyle, daughter and only child to the Earl of Burlington.|$|E
25|$|The Main Event was a {{continuation}} of a storyline that had gotten very heated, very quickly as Volador Jr. and Mr. Niebla faced off in a singles match between the two. In previous weeks the two had fought, tearing at each other's masks and brutalizing each other whenever they got the chance; this match was no different. The action even included Mije and Zacarias, the Mascotas (little people in brightly colored costumes) as both Mije and Zacarias interfered in the match and tried to gain an advantage for their side. In the third and deciding fall Volador Jr. pulled Mr. Niebla's mask off, hoping to gain an advantage by the distraction, <b>but</b> <b>Mr.</b> Niebla had prepared for such a ploy and had his face wrapped in bandages under the mask so his bare face was not exposed. When the referee caught Volador Jr. with Mr. Niebla's mask in his hands he immediately called for the disqualification as {{it is illegal to}} take an opponent's mask off under Lucha Libre rules. For the third week in a row Volador Jr. challenged Mr. Niebla to a mask vs. mask match and for the third week in a row Mr. Niebla decline the challenge, stating Volador Jr. was not worthy of it.|$|E

25|$|It will {{be borne}} {{in mind that}} the Liberal doctrines of that time, with their violent anti-socialist spirit and their strong insistence on the gospel of thrift, self-help, {{settlement}} of wages by the higgling of the market, and non-interference by the State.... I think that Mr. Gladstone was the strongest anti-socialist that I have ever known among persons who gave any serious thought to social and political questions. It is quite true, as has been often said, that “we are all socialists up to a certain point”; <b>but</b> <b>Mr.</b> Gladstone fixed that point lower, and was more vehement against those who went above it, than any other politician or official of my acquaintance. I remember his speaking indignantly to me of the budget of 1874 as “That socialistic budget of Northcote's,” merely because of the special relief which it gave to the poorer class of income-tax payers. His strong belief in Free Trade was only one of the results of his deep-rooted conviction that the Government's interference with the free action of the individual, whether by taxation or otherwise, should be kept at an irreducible minimum. It is, indeed, not too much to say that his conception of Liberalism was the negation of Socialism.|$|E
500|$|Barber wrote {{years later}} about the competition, [...] "many [...] were sent in, <b>but</b> <b>Mr.</b> St. Gaudens, [...] who was {{appointed}} one of the committee to pass upon designs, objected to everything submitted".

500|$|On Monday, 10 August 1724, {{there was}} a match at Penshurst Park (result unknown) which {{featured}} the combined parishes of Penshurst, Tonbridge & Wadhurst versus Dartford. This was recorded in a diary entry by one John Dawson, who may have watched it. No details are known <b>but</b> <b>Mr</b> Dawson says it was [...] "a great cricket match". Note that some sources have mistakenly given the venue as [...] "Islington" [...] but contemporary newspapers confirm that it took place at Penshurst Park.|$|E
500|$|Referring to Downey, Joe Morgenstein of The Wall Street Journal—despite complimenting Downey's performance—favored {{his work}} in Iron Man over his acting in The Avengers: [...] "His Iron Man is {{certainly}} a team player, <b>but</b> <b>Mr.</b> Downey comes to the party with two insuperable superpowers: a character of established sophistication—the industrialist/inventor Tony Stark, a sharp-tongued man of the world—and his own quicksilver presence that finds its finest expression in self-irony." [...] Neumaier praised Evans, stating that he accurately conveyed his character's internal conflicts.|$|E
