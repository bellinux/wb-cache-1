5000|$|When the Butler Education Act 1944 {{came into}} force in 1945, the school became a county {{maintained}} secondary grammar school, and only admitted pupils who {{had passed the}} Eleven plus exam. There was considerable <b>building</b> <b>extension</b> <b>work</b> undertaken in the early 1960s which was accompanied by significant increase in pupil numbers and, from 1974, facilitated the school's evolution into a comprehensive school. The Jubilee Review in 1985 alluded {{to the fact that}} [...] "the future may well be uncertain". [...] This prophecy became true in May 1991 when the school closed, following which it was demolished and the land was developed as housing. There is some link with the old school, however, as the boundary wall incorporates the carved Rawdon, Yeadon, Guiseley and Menston stones from the facade of the school, and the street names of Coverley Rise and Fairfax Grove in the development pay a passing homage to two of the school houses.|$|E

Until 2007 it had a sister museum in Finchley, operated by the same charitable trust and sited within the Sternberg Centre. The Camden branch reopened in 2010 {{after two years of}} major <b>building</b> and <b>extension</b> <b>work.</b> The £10 million renovation was funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund and private donations.

40|$|International audienceAtoll {{countries}} {{are particularly vulnerable}} to coastal hazards {{in the context of}} global change, which justifies the interest in population exposure assessments. This paper contributes to addressing this need by assessing the current exposure of the population of two areas of the South Tarawa Urban District (Tarawa Atoll, Republic of Kiribati) to coastal erosion and flooding. The assessment is based on data relating to island morphology (digital terrain models and shoreline change), land use (<b>building</b> <b>extension</b> and coastal <b>works)</b> and environmental changes reconstructed for the 1969 - 2008 period. The results highlight rapid changes in land use and significant differences in current population exposure to coastal erosion and flooding between and within study sites. Between 1969 and 2007 - 2008, the built area located less than 20 m from the reference shoreline has increased by a factor of 4. 2 at Bairiki and by a factor of 32. 2 at Eita-Bangantebure, enhancing population exposure given that land elevation is low (12. 6 and 77. 4 % 20 m from the coastline) and flooding (> 1. 5 m). Building exposure is higher at Eita-Bangantebure, where 71. 3 % of the built area is currently not exposed (using the same criteria), but 17. 1 % shows medium to very high levels of exposure, due to very low land elevation (22. 3 % of the land area < 1. 5 m) and shoreline recession. The Eita-Bangantebure case study exemplifies the maladaptive trajectories of change that have been reported in other atoll countries...|$|R
