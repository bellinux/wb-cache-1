2500|$|IR-visible sum {{frequency}} generation spectroscopy uses two laser beams that spatially and temporally overlap at a {{surface of a}} material or the interface between two media. [...] An output beam is generated at a frequency of {{the sum of the}} two input beams. The two input beams {{have to be able to}} access the surface, and the output beam needs to be able to leave the surface to be picked up by a detector. [...] There are two main types of {{sum frequency}} spectrometer, scanning systems and broadband systems. For the former type of spectrometer, one of the beams is a visible wavelength laser held at a constant frequency and the other is a tunable infrared laser - by tuning the IR laser, the system can scan over resonances and obtain the vibrational spectrum of the interfacial region in a piecewise fashion.. In the case of broadband spectrometers, one laser (typically the visible laser) is kept at a fixed narrow wavelength, and the other laser produces a spectrally <b>broad</b> <b>beam.</b> These laser beams again overlap at the interface being studied, but can cover a wider range of resonances at once than a spectrometer operating in scanning mode and hence spectra can be acquired much faster, allowing the ability to perform time-resolved measurements with interfacial sensitivity [...]|$|E
