5|$|Most of {{the bridges}} which cross the river are movable, to allow {{shipping}} to pass. There are six swing bridges; four <b>bascule</b> bridges, {{two of which}} have twin leaves, one for each carriageway of the roads which they carry; and three Scherzer lift bridges, which are a type of rolling <b>bascule</b> bridge. Scott Street Bridge, which is now permanently raised, was originally powered from a high pressure water main maintained by the first public power distribution company in the world.|$|E
5|$|The Chicago and North Western Railway's Kinzie Street {{railroad}} bridge (also {{known as}} the Carroll Avenue bridge) is a single leaf <b>bascule</b> bridge across the north branch of the Chicago River in downtown Chicago, Illinois. At {{the time of its}} opening in 1908 it was the world's longest and heaviest <b>bascule</b> bridge. Previous bridges on the same site included the first bridge to cross the Chicago River, Chicago's first railroad bridge, {{and one of the first}} all-steel bridges in the United States.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, the City of Bridgeport {{created a}} special {{commission}} {{to oversee the}} construction of a bridge at Congress Street. A local engineer, Raymond F. Stoddard was hired as design consultant and obtained the license to use the Scherzer design. A Scherzer rolling-lift bridge with a double-leaf <b>bascule</b> was chosen for construction. The design is a Deck-type plate girder bridge; using two plate girders to support the deck. The Scherzer <b>bascule</b> was a popular design because it avoided the expense of high-stress pivot bearings; though it requires stronger foundations to support the weight of the bridge's operation. The engineering firm, J. R. Worcester and Company designed and constructed the concrete-arch approach and Fort Pitt Bridge Works fabricated the movable bridge. The cost of construction was $300,000, which was offset through funding from the Connecticut Company. A contemporary account from the Hartford Courant gave stated the contract was for $305,000 to Snare, Tristo and Company. The bridge was opened to the public July 16, 1910.|$|E

50|$|The {{bridge is}} 800 ft in length with two towers each 213 ft high, built on piers. The central span of 200 ft between the towers is {{split into two}} equal <b>bascules</b> or leaves, which can be raised to an angle of 86 degrees to allow river traffic to pass. The <b>bascules,</b> {{weighing}} over 1,000 tons each, are counterbalanced to minimise the force required and allow raising in five minutes.|$|R
5|$|State Route 160 {{begins in}} eastern Antioch at SR 4. After two interchanges, the highway rises onto the two lane Antioch Bridge over the San Joaquin River. It cuts north across {{the center of}} Sherman Island, {{reaching}} the Sacramento River on the opposite shore. From here to Sacramento, SR 160 never strays far from the river, first following the east levee over the 1949 Three Mile Slough Bridge (a lift bridge), past Brannan Island State Recreation Area, and across SR 12 opposite the river from Rio Vista. After passing Isleton, the highway crosses the river on the Isleton Bridge, a <b>bascule</b> bridge built in 1923, and runs along the west shore on Grand Island, where it meets {{the east end of}} SR 220. The Walnut Grove Bridge carries County Route J11 east across the river to Walnut Grove, and, {{at the north end of}} the island, SR 160 crosses the 1924 Steamboat Slough Bridge onto Sutter Island and then the 1923 Paintersville Bridge across the Sacramento River to the mainland, both <b>bascule</b> bridges.|$|E
5|$|A {{boulevard}} to {{link the}} parks on Chicago's north and south sides was proposed as early as 1891. An early plan called for a tunnel to link Michigan Avenue south of the river with Pine Street (now Michigan Avenue) north of the river. In 1903 {{an editorial in the}} Chicago Tribune proposed a new <b>bascule</b> bridge across the river at Michigan Avenue. Other plans suggested that the bridge should be a replica of the Pont Alexandre III that spans the Seine in Paris, or that, rather than constructing an entirely new bridge, the existing Rush Street bridge should be double-decked.|$|E
5|$|Michigan Avenue Bridge is a double-leaf, double-deck, fixed counterweight, {{trunnion}} <b>bascule</b> bridge. It was {{engineered by}} the Chicago Department of Public Works, Bureau of Engineering; Edward H. Bennett was the consulting architect and William A. Mulcahy {{the chief engineer}} of construction. At the time of construction it {{was believed to be}} the first double-deck bridge ever built to have roadway on both levels; faster non-commercial traffic using the upper deck and slower commercial traffic that served the various industries and docks in the vicinity of the river using the lower deck.|$|E
50|$|His {{youngest}} surviving brother, Hamilton Owen Rendel, {{designed and}} supervised {{the installation of}} the steam driven compound condensing pump engines, hydraulic accumulators and hydraulic machinery that first operated the <b>bascules</b> of the iconic Tower Bridge in London.|$|R
50|$|A {{computer}} system {{was installed in}} 2000 to control the raising and lowering of the <b>bascules</b> remotely. It proved unreliable, resulting in the bridge being stuck in the open or closed positions on several occasions during 2005 until its sensors were replaced.|$|R
50|$|In 1974, the {{original}} operating mechanism was largely {{replaced by a}} new electro-hydraulic drive system, designed by BHA Cromwell House. The only components of {{the original}} system still in use are the final pinions, which engage with the racks fitted to the <b>bascules.</b> These are driven by modern hydraulic motors and gearing, using oil rather than water as the hydraulic fluid. Some of the original hydraulic machinery has been retained, although {{it is no longer}} in use. It {{is open to the public}} and forms the basis for the bridge's museum, which resides in the old engine rooms on the south side of the bridge. The museum includes the steam engines, two of the accumulators and one of the hydraulic engines that moved the <b>bascules,</b> along with other related artefacts.|$|R
5|$|Route 3 {{crosses the}} Passaic River {{on a fixed}} bridge, which {{replaced}} a double-leaf trunnion <b>bascule</b> bridge in 2013, into Rutherford, Bergen County. Just after crossing the river, the route interchanges with County Route 507 (Riverside Avenue). The freeway continues through a residential area and comes to an exit that provides access to southbound Route 17. Past this interchange, Route 3 is closely paralleled by Route 17 to the south until Route 3 interchanges again with Route 17, which continues {{to the north of}} Route 3.|$|E
5|$|Edward DeVoe Tompkins, Inc. {{suffered}} numerous {{delays in}} the construction of the bridge and sued the City of Bridgeport. The case went to the Connecticut Supreme Court in Edward DeV. Tompkins v. City of Bridgeport, Connecticut. Tompkins sued the City of Bridgeport for breach of contract on the grounds that City of Bridgeport was unresponsive, and did not clear the site as scheduled. Tompkins also cited other concerns relating to the design and construction of the bridge including the design engineers from the Strauss <b>Bascule</b> Bridge Company being located in Chicago. The City of Bridgeport alleged that Tompkins was incompetent and uncooperative, but the Connecticut Supreme Court disagreed and ruled in favor of Tompkins. The Court awarded Tompkins the full contract as damages.|$|E
5|$|In {{the centre}} of the town lies Weymouth Harbour; {{although}} it was the reason for the town's foundation, the harbour separates the two areas of Melcombe Regis (the main town centre) and Weymouth (the southern harbourside) from each other. Since the 18th century they have been linked by successive bridges over the narrowest part of the harbour. The present Town Bridge, built in 1930, is a lifting <b>bascule</b> bridge allowing boats to access the inner harbour. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution stationed a lifeboat at Weymouth {{for the first time on}} 26 January 1869. A boathouse was built with a slipway by the harbour and is still in use, although the lifeboat is now moored at a pontoon.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bascules</b> {{are raised}} around 1000 times a year.River traffic is now much reduced, {{but it still}} takes {{priority}} over road traffic. Today, 24 hours' notice is required before opening the bridge, and opening times are published in advance on the bridge's website. There is no charge for vessels to open the bridge.|$|R
50|$|Teito is very skilled {{with the}} <b>Bascules,</b> even {{exceeding}} the Zaiphon limit twice for it during training. He is very agile {{and an excellent}} runner after having trained with Castor's puppets, and manages {{to get through the}} examinations on his first try with Hakuren and he became Frau's apprentice. His slave number was 2741.|$|R
50|$|When {{needing to}} be raised for {{the passage of a}} vessel the <b>bascules</b> are only raised to an angle {{sufficient}} for the vessel to safely pass under the bridge, except {{in the case of a}} vessel with the Monarch on board in which case they are raised fully no matter the size of the vessel.|$|R
5|$|River {{traffic and}} {{railroad}} traffic were increasingly {{in competition with}} each other. In October 1879 a disaster was narrowly avoided when a seven-coach passenger train with 800 people on board approached the open swing bridge too fast and was barely able to stop in time, ending up with its front wheels hanging off the approach road over the river. Meanwhile, boats on the river were getting larger and finding {{it increasingly difficult to}} navigate the bridges {{at the mouth of the}} north branch, so the Army Corps of Engineers ordered the clearing of three swing bridges near Kinzie Street that were obstructing river traffic. Therefore, in 1907 construction started on a new <b>bascule</b> bridge that would allow more space for boats to pass by on the river.|$|E
5|$|The first {{bridge across}} the Ontonagon River was built in 1891. It was heavily damaged after {{a fire in the}} village a few years later. This bridge was deemed {{inadequate}} for the needs of traffic in Ontonagon in the 1930s. The Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) contracted for a replacement span in 1939. A temporary crossing was used while the original span was demolished and replaced with a swing bridge. This style of bridge was popular with the department {{in the first half of}} the 20th century, but fell out of favor as the MSHD transitioned to <b>bascule</b> bridges. Because of this change, the Ontonagon River Bridge was the last of its type built in the state when it was completed in 1940.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Bristol Harbour Railway was a {{joint venture}} by the GWR and the Bristol and Exeter Railway, opened in 1872 between Temple Meads and the Floating Harbour. Its route included a tunnel under St Mary Redcliffe church and a steam-powered <b>bascule</b> bridge over the entrance locks at Bathurst Basin. In 1876 the railway was extended by half a mile to Wapping Wharf. In 1906, new branches from the south via the Ashton Avenue swing bridge were built to Canons Marsh {{on the north side}} of the Floating Harbour and to Wapping via a line alongside the New Cut. A Coal Concentration Depot owned by Western Fuels was established at Wapping Wharf just behind the Industrial Museum but this closed in 1987.|$|E

Upon his return, {{in accordance with the}} twenty-seventh canon of III Lateran, he pronounced excommunication on Raymond V of Toulouse, Roger II of Carcassonne, and Bernard Ato VI of Nîmes. The twenty seventh canon prohibited the use of mercenaries, such as routiers, coterills, <b>bascules,</b> and Aragonese.|$|R
50|$|The Tower Bridge Exhibition is {{a display}} {{housed in the}} bridge's twin towers, the {{high-level}} walkways and the Victorian engine rooms. It uses films, photos and interactive displays to explain why and how Tower Bridge was built. Visitors can access the original steam engines that once powered the bridge <b>bascules,</b> housed in a building close to {{the south end of}} the bridge.|$|R
50|$|The Guldborgsund bridge (Guldborgbroen) {{spans the}} {{northern}} end of the Guldborgsund, between the islands of Lolland and Falster in Denmark. The bridge consists of two steel arched spans with a 30m central opening section having two rising <b>bascules.</b> It was built between 1933 and 1934, is 180m long and 7m wide, carrying two road carriageways and was officially opened by Prince Axel 6 October 1934.|$|R
5|$|Two <b>bascule</b> bridges—the Paintersville Bridge and Isleton Bridge—replaced {{the free}} ferries in 1923, and {{are of a}} type {{patented}} by Joseph B. Strauss, {{who went on to}} design the Golden Gate Bridge. Local businessmen Aven Hanford and Oscar Klatt replaced the toll ferry with the tolled Antioch Bridge in mid-1926, almost a year before they opened the larger Carquinez Bridge to the west. The counties of Contra Costa and Sacramento organized a joint highway district in November 1925 to fund an improvement of the northern approach from Rio Vista; the concrete highway was completed in July 1927, creating a fully paved continuous route between Sacramento and the bay.|$|E
5|$|Northwest of Holland, {{the highway}} runs as a four-lane {{expressway}} and divided highway parallel, but inland from, the Lake Michigan shoreline. This section of US31 runs through {{a mix of}} farm fields and forests as it runs to the community of Agnew. There, US31 intersects {{the western end of}} M-45 (Lake Michigan Drive) before continuing into the southern end of Grand Haven. In that city, the highway follows a four-lane boulevard with a grass median. On the northern edge of the city of Grand Haven, US31 crosses the Grand River on a <b>bascule</b> bridge that opens about 450–500times per year. North of the structure, US31 transitions into a freeway at the interchange with the western end of M-104 in Ferrysburg. This freeway continues northward through the suburban edges of the Muskegon area and meets the western end of I-96 near the Muskegon County Airport in Norton Shores.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the river}} reaches the {{outskirts}} of Hull, its course {{is marked by a}} series of bridges, most of which open to allow boats to pass. There are swing bridges, lift bridges and <b>bascule</b> bridges, and the river becomes part of the Port of Hull. The river, which is the dividing line between West and East Hull, bisects the city's industrial area. The bridges can cause traffic delays during high tides, though river traffic is less than it once was. The Beverley and Barmston Drain rejoins the river above Scott Street Bridge. Below North Bridge, an unused dry dock on the west bank marks the former entrance to Queens Dock. Below Drypool Bridge, a muddy basin on the east bank was once the entrance to Drypool Basin and Victoria Dock. The river reaches its confluence with the Humber estuary in the centre of Kingston upon Hull. At its mouth, a tidal barrier has been constructed to prevent tidal surges from entering the river. In the past, these had regularly flooded the town and the flat countryside to the north.|$|E
50|$|Although most vertical-lift bridges use towers, each {{equipped}} with counterweights, some use hydraulic jacks located below the deck. An {{example is the}} 52 ft span bridge at St Paul Avenue in Milwaukee (see also table bridges). Another design used balance beams to lift the deck, with pivoting <b>bascules</b> located {{on the top of}} the lift towers. An example of this kind was built at La Salle in Illinois, USA.|$|R
50|$|The bridge has {{a central}} 20m span with two <b>bascules,</b> {{both on the}} eastern side of the bridge. One carries four lanes of vehicle traffic while the other carries a rail link. The two parts {{normally}} operate together. The bridge is manned during the day and opened on request for passing ships, but may only be opened once every half-hour. It is planned for the bridge to be re-equipped for automatic operation.|$|R
25|$|On 15 June 2007, Wogan's home city of Limerick honoured {{him with}} the Freedom of the City at a {{ceremony}} in Limerick's Civic Hall. Because of his long absence {{from the city and}} unflattering remarks about the city in a 1980 interview, the local press carried out a vox pop, which resulted in support for the award. He was made an honorary freeman of the City of London in 2009, and invited to raise the <b>bascules</b> of Tower Bridge.|$|R
5|$|The A350 road is Poole town centre's main artery, running north along Holes Bay {{and on to}} the A35, and as {{a single}} {{carriageway}} to Bath and Bristol. To the east, the A337 road leads to Lymington and the New Forest. The A35 trunk road runs from Devon to Southampton and connects to the A31 {{on the outskirts of the}} town. The A31, the major trunk road in central southern England, connects to the M27 motorway at Southampton. From here the M3 motorway leads to London, and fast access may also be gained via the A34 to the M4 north of Newbury. Poole Bridge, a narrow <b>bascule</b> bridge constructed in 1927, connects the town centre and Hamworthy. Approval for a second bridge was given by the Department for Transport in 2006 and the £37million Twin Sails bridge was completed in 2012. A road link to Studland and the Isle of Purbeck across the narrow entrance of Poole Harbour is provided by the Sandbanks Ferry.|$|E
5|$|The City of Bridgeport {{appointed}} a bridge commission {{to replace the}} aging East Washington Avenue Bridge on December 7, 1915. The commission chose a Joseph B. Strausss patented design from the Strauss <b>Bascule</b> Bridge Company of Chicago, Illinois. The city engineer James A. McElroy drew up {{the plans for the}} bridge's specifications and the plans were completed on February 17, 1916. The steel for the construction was ordered from the Penn Bridge Company. The project was suspended because of a dispute with the contractor and a lack of funds to erect the bridge, but in 1923 the State of Connecticut appropriated $350,000 to complete the project. Only two bids for the bridge's erection were placed, the first by Bridgeport Dry Dock and Dredging for $326,575 and the second by C. W. Blakeslee and Sons for $389,492 with estimations varying based on extra work needed. Bridgeport Dry Dock and Dredging won the contract and the materials were shipped to Bridgeport, with work beginning mid-1924. The completed bridge included an operator's house and a public toilet building. The bridge, costing over $550,000 in total, was turned over to the city on October 14, 1925.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Street Bridge {{opened for}} traffic in 1919, {{but had to}} be closed in 1932 after the {{southeast}} pier was excessively settled. The Connecticut Highway Department and federal government provided the funds required to remove the <b>bascule</b> leaves and replace the pier in 1936. As {{a part of the}} renovations, a new floor and electrical system were installed. In 1965, the bridge floor was replaced with steel grating atop 14-inch (36-cm) I-beam stringers. In 1984, the eastern approach span and northwest trunnion post, the point where the bridge pivots, were reconstructed as part of what would be the bridge's last major renovations. Other minor repairs to the bridge's steel and masonry were done during the project. The bridge was closed in the 1990s and it was dismantled in 1999. In 2010, the United States Coast Guard struck the rule pertaining to the operation of the bridge due to its removal. Previously, the rule stated that the bridge need not open for the passage of vessels.|$|E
50|$|In January 2012, Faure {{signed a}} {{contract}} with the label Jipe Epic, part of the Sony Music Entertainment group. Teté, Ben Ricour, Chet, Jean-Louis Piérot, Barcella and Fabien Boeuf worked with Gaël Faure to complete his second album. Two singles were released in advance of the album, On dirait l'Islande (You’d Think it Was Iceland) and Tu me suivras (You Will Follow Me). The album, De silences en <b>bascules</b> was released in February 2014. Tu me suivras reached number 37 in the Belgian charts.|$|R
50|$|Before {{the onset}} of mechanization, these horses were used in agriculture, as coach horses, and {{occasionally}} for riding. The closed stud book and careful preservation of female family lines has ensured, {{in an era of}} globalization, the horses of Holstein have a unique character. While the active gaits, arched neck, and attractive manner in harness of the early foundation bloodstock have been retained, the breed survived because of the willingness of its breeders to conform to changing market demands. The high-headed jump and leg faults were corrected with supple, <b>basculing</b> jumping technique and structurally correct improvement sires. In the past 15 or 20 years, even more pronounced refinement and aesthetic appeal have occurred.|$|R
50|$|The Johnson Street Bridge was {{designed}} {{under the direction}} of Mr. F. M. Preston, City Engineer in 1920. This is a Bascule-type bridge in which one end rises while a counter weight lowers on the opposite end. When it was built, the Johnson Street Bridge had two separate <b>Bascules,</b> the Railway section and the Highway section. The Railway span was removed in 2012 after it was deemed to be in such a poor state of repair that it posed a danger to the pedestrians and cyclists who were using it and any marine traffic passing below it. The railway had not been used by a train since the Via Rail passenger service was suspended in 2010.|$|R
