60|$|When {{the copper}} helmet came into sight, they dragged Bethune on deck {{and then set}} to work to shorten cable. The yacht was now plainly visible about a mile off, {{and seemed to be}} moving slowly, which {{suggested}} that soundings were being taken preparatory to anchoring; but the sloop would not readily be seen against the land. There was, however, a quantity of heavy chain to get in before they hoisted sail, and Jimmy in haste slipped the <b>breast</b> <b>rope</b> that held them to the wreck. For convenience in picking it up, they had attached its outer end to a big keg buoy.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{of these}} treasures {{came from the}} {{influence}} of Mother Teresa da Anunciada, who originally sought to ennoble the simple [...] "Ecco Homem" [...] image, her [...] "master and noble". Many of the pieces were contributed long after her death (16 May 1738); José da Câmara and his wife Margarida Tomásia contributed the sceptre, the Crown of Thorns, the reliquary on the image's <b>breast,</b> <b>rope</b> and glitter that adorns the image as decoration, that included pearls, topaz, emeralds and other precious stones. The first sceptre, which was made of silk flowers, was originally ordered by Anunciada from the Mother Jerónima do Sacramento in the Convent of Santo André.|$|E
50|$|Another {{technique}} {{is to put}} a rope around the torso just above the breasts, and another one just below them, then push the ropes together to squeeze the breasts from the top and bottom. This can be done instead of, or as well as, the other method. A rope can also be passed over the shoulders and between the <b>breasts,</b> drawing the <b>rope</b> {{above and below the}} breasts together, then pass back over the shoulders to the knots at the back. The primary rope can be used to place cinches between the arms and the body.|$|R
60|$|As his {{presence}} had not interfered with or interrupted the preparations, {{they were now}} far advanced, and were completed shortly after his departure. When the festoons were all put up as tastily as they might be, the stupendous collection was uncovered, and there were displayed, on a raised platform some two feet from the floor, running round the room and parted from the rude public by a crimson <b>rope</b> <b>breast</b> high, divers sprightly effigies of celebrated characters, singly and in groups, clad in glittering dresses of various climes and times, and standing more or less unsteadily upon their legs, with their eyes very wide open, and their nostrils very much inflated, and the muscles of their legs and arms very strongly developed, and all their countenances expressing great surprise. All the gentlemen were very pigeon-breasted and very blue about the beards; and all the ladies were miraculous figures; and all the ladies and all the gentlemen were looking intensely nowhere, and staring with extraordinary earnestness at nothing.|$|R
6000|$|It was gray, harsh, easterly weather, {{the swell}} ran pretty high, {{and out in}} the open there were [...] "skipper's daughters," [...] when I found myself at last on the diver's platform, twenty pounds of lead upon each foot and my whole person swollen with ply and ply of woollen underclothing. One moment, the salt wind was {{whistling}} round my night-capped head; the next, I was crushed almost double {{under the weight of the}} helmet. As that intolerable burthern was laid upon me, I could have found it in my heart (only for shame's sake) to cry off from the whole enterprise. But it was too late. The attendants began to turn the hurdy-gurdy, and the air to whistle through the tube; some one screwed in the barred window of the vizor; and I was cut off in a moment from my fellow-men; standing there in their midst, but quite divorced from intercourse: a creature deaf and dumb, pathetically looking forth upon them from a climate of his own. Except that I could move and feel, I was like a man fallen in a catalepsy. But time was scarce given me to realise my isolation; the weights were hung upon my back and <b>breast,</b> the signal <b>rope</b> was thrust into my unresisting hand; and setting a twenty-pound foot upon the ladder, I began ponderously to descend.|$|R
