Flash durations in the microsecond range and luminous intensities were adjusted to vary {{the degree of}} successful shape recognition. Four experiments were conducted to test whether <b>Bloch’s</b> <b>law</b> would apply in this task. <b>Bloch’s</b> <b>law</b> holds that for very brief flashes the perceptual threshold {{is determined by the}} total number of photons being delivered, i. e., there is reciprocity of intensity and duration. The present results did not find that effectiveness of flashes was based on the total quantity of photons, as predicted by <b>Bloch’s</b> <b>law.</b> Additionally, the evidence points to a visual mechanism that has ultra-high temporal precision that either registers the rate of photon flux or the duration of flashes...|$|R
40|$|How {{the visual}} brain {{integrates}} temporally dispersed information {{is an open}} question. Often, {{it is assumed that}} the visual system simply sums light over {{a certain period of time}} (e. g. <b>Bloch's</b> <b>law).</b> However, in feature fusion, information presented later dominates, suggesting complex temporal dynamics that cannot be described by simple energy summation. For example, if two verniers are presented in rapid succession at the same location, they are not perceived individually but they fuse to one single vernier. The perceived offset of the fused vernier is a combination of the offsets of the two presented verniers, with the later one dominating. Here, we show that indeed, <b>Bloch's</b> <b>law</b> does not hold across verniers in a sequence. However, changes in the luminance of a single vernier can be compensated for by changes in its duration in accordance with <b>Bloch's</b> <b>law.</b> We present a simple model to demonstrate that these findings can be explained by decaying neural activation.

40|$|The {{temperature}} dependence of magnetization in ferromagnetic nanostructures (e. g., nanoparticles or nanoclusters) is usually analyzed {{by means of}} an empirical extension of the <b>Bloch</b> <b>law</b> sufficiently flexible for a good fitting to the observed data and indicates a strong softening of magnetic coupling compared to the bulk material. We analytically derive a microscopic generalization of the <b>Bloch</b> <b>law</b> for the Heisenberg spin model which takes into account the effects of size, shape and various surface boundary conditions. The result establishes explicit connection to the microscopic parameters and differs significantly from the existing description. In particular, we show with a specific example that the latter may be misleading and grossly overestimates magnetic softening in nanoparticles. It becomes clear why the usual $T^{ 3 / 2 }$ dependence appears to be valid in some nanostructures, while large deviations are a general rule. We demonstrate that combination of geometrical characteristics and coupling to environment can be used to efficiently control magnetization and, in particular, to reach a magnetization higher than in the bulk material.

40|$|We {{present the}} study on Bloch T 3 / 2 law and its {{applicability}} in ferromagnetic cobalt nanoparticles with sizes 25 and 38 nm. Bloch has derived the T 3 / 2 law by assuming long wave-length spin-waves {{to be excited}} at low temperatures.

The nanoparticles of magnetite were obtained using microwave activated process, and the magnetic properties as well as the electron magnetic resonance behavior were studied for the Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles capped with alginic acid. The capped nanoparticles exhibit improved crystalline structure of the surface which leads to an enhanced magnetization. The saturation magnetization Ms increases to ~ 75 % of the bulk magnetization. The improved structure also facilitates quantization of spin-wave spectrum in the finite size nanoparticles and this in turn is responsible for unconventional behavior at low temperatures. In magnetic resonance these anomalies are manifested as an unusual increase in the resonant field Hr(T) and also as a maximum of the spectroscopic splitting geff parameter at low temperatures. The unconventional behavior of the nanoparticles also leads to pronounced upturn of magnetization at low temperatures and a deviation from the <b>Bloch</b> <b>law</b> M(T) T^ 3 / 2.

The unit cell volume increases and the microstrain in the compound shows peak formation as the particle size decreases. Nano particles of La 0. 8 Sr 0. 2 MnO 3 −δ exhibit superparamagnetism whose blocking temperature has a nonlinear and logarithmic decreasing tendency as function of particle size and applied magnetic field, respectively.

The coercivity of the nanoparicles increases manifold as particle size varies from 53 nm to 21 nm. In the single domain region the coercivity exhibits a d− 1. 125 behavior.

The temperature enters the model as a parameter by way of the magnetic susceptibility. Such a dependence is discussed in order to comply with both <b>Bloch’s</b> <b>law</b> (below the critical value) and Curie-Weiss law (far above the critical value).

The material is a ferri or ferromagnet, but showed magnetic blocking and random spin freezing process on lowering the measurement temperature down to 5 K. The sample prepared at pH = 12 and annealed at 800 ^C showed a sharp magnetization peak at 105 K, the superparamagnetic blocking temperature of the particles. The magnetization peak remained incomplete within measurement temperature up to 350 K for rest of the samples, although peak temperature was brought down by increasing applied dc field. The fitting of temperature dependence of coercivity data according to Kneller law suggested random orientation of ferromagnetic particles. The fitting of saturation magnetization according to <b>Bloch</b> <b>law</b> provided the exponent that largely deviated from 1. 5, a typical value for long ranged ferromagnet.

The resonant absorption peak is monitored for out-of-plane (H-perpendicular to) and in-plane (H-parallel to) dc magnetic field (H) as the system goes through magnetic ordering. These data suggest a resilient transformation to the ferromagnetic (FM) phase {{in the vicinity of}} the Curie temperature (T-C), indicative of a phase separation, which is dominant in the thinner film. The saturation magnetization is calculated from SQUID magnetometry on the same film. A pronounced zero-field absorption is seen in H-parallel to geometry displaying anomalous growth in 100 nm film at T < T-C. This feature is correlated with the magneto-conductivity of the manganite which is colossal in the vicinity of TC in the well-ordered film of thickness 200 nm.

40|$|The {{apparent}} {{universality of}} Bloch's T^{ 3 / 2 }-law for the temperature {{dependence of the}} spontaneous magnetization, and of generalizations thereof, is considered. It is argued that in the derivation one should not only consider the exchange interaction between the spins, but also the other interactions between them, leading to elliptical spin precession and deviations from the parabolic dispersion of magnons. Also interaction effects are important to explain the apparent universality of generalized <b>Bloch</b> <b>law</b> exponents e_B, defined by M_s(T) = M_s(0) -const. x T^{e_B}, valid in a wide temperature range T_ 1 < T < T_ 2, and for dimensionalities d = 1, 2, and 3. The above-mentioned temperature range, the 'Bloch range', lies above the quantum range, where magnetic long-range order (e. g. in d= 2 dimensions) is nontrivially enforced by the additional interactions, but below the thermal critical region, where universal 'anomalous scaling dimensions' apply. In contrast, for the Bloch temperature region, the universality is only apparent, i. e. a crossover-phenomenon, and simple scaling considerations with 'normal dimensions' apply. However, due to interactions, the Bloch exponent e_B depends {{not only on the}} dimensionality d of the system, but also on the spin quantum number s (mod (1 / 2)) of the system, i. e. for given d the Bloch exponent e_B is different for half-integer s and for integer s.

40|$|Abstract. For {{more than}} a century {{researchers}} have been reporting that the visual impact of a very brief flash is determined by the quantity of photons that the flash delivers.

Prior research found no evidence for such reciprocity when microsecond-duration flashes from a light-emitting diode array were used to display the major contours of nameable shapes. The present work tested with flash durations ranging up to 100 ms and also found no reciprocity. This departure from classic principles might be due to the specific range of wavelengths of the light-emitting diodes and to a mesopic level of ambient light, which together would preclude activation of rods. The reciprocity of intensity and duration may only be valid with full dark adaptation and very dim flashes that activate rods...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the studies of {{magnetization}} and electrical transport properties of iron nanoparticles embedded in the carbon matrix. The synthesis and characteristics of the nanoparticle systems studied, are also presented. Carbon-iron (C-Fe) based systems are of growing interest due to their improved magnetic properties {{as well as in}} their potential application as sensors, catalysts, and in various other applications. In particular, nanocomposites of iron carbide, such as the cementite phase Fe 3 C, are further suited to diverse technological exploitations due to their enhanced mechanical properties and importance in ferrous metallurgy. The recent interest in magnetic nanostructures lies in the emergence of novel magnetic and transport properties with the reduction of size. As the dimension approaches the nanometer length scale, interesting size-dependent properties like enhanced coercivity, enhanced magnetic moment, super paramagnetism etc. are seen. Thermal assisted chemical vapour deposition (CVD) is used to decompose and chemically react the introduced precursors, maleic anhydride and ferrocene. This method provides relative size control over the individual particles by varying C/Fe concentration in precursors and the pyrolysis temperature during the co-deposition process. Ferrocene has been used actively for the production of nanoparticle composites and in the production of nanostructured carbon. The temperature of preparation, reaction rate, and the time duration of annealing directly eﬀects the nanoparticle compositions. The catalytic eﬀect of transitional elements are well documented in literature. This thesis is an eﬀort to understand the growth of ferromagnetic nanocrystallites in carbon matrix, which undergo partial graphitization due to the catalytic eﬀect of transitional elements. The eﬀect of transitional metal on the degree of graphitization of the carbon matrix, morphology of the nanoparticle and the carbon matrix are studied. The phase of the ferromagnetic iron nanoparticles and the structural investigation forms part of the study. Here X-Ray diﬀraction (XRD) is employed to study the presence of diﬀerent phases of iron in the partially graphitized carbon matrix. The matrix morphology and the particle size distribution were studied using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and High-Resolution TEM (HRTEM). The ferromagnetic states of the iron nanoparticles are investigated using Mossbauer spectroscopy. The results from these studies, are used to correlated the macroscopic properties to the microscopic studies. The enhanced magnetization, coercivity and the temperature dependence of the magnetization value is understood within the frame work of ferromagnetic <b>Bloch</b> <b>law</b> and surrounding carbon spins. The logarithmic temperature dependence of conductivity of the nanoparticle composites is analyzed in the framework of interference models as well as the many-body Kondo interaction eﬀect. This thesis contains seven chapters: In chapter 1, a brief introduction to mesoscopic physics and the size-dependent phenomenon are given. Special attention is paid to magnetic nanoparticle and its composites, and the various ﬁnite-size eﬀects exhibited by them are discussed in detail. The relevance of carbon matrix and its importance on the growth of iron nanoparticles with high thermal stability is also discussed. The ballistic and diﬀusive transport phenomena observed in low-dimensional systems are brieﬂy discussed. The interplay of localization and various interaction eﬀects at nanoscale are examined. In disordered metals the low temperature conductivity is dominated by the interference eﬀects. A brief discussion is made on the conductivity in disorder systems, with the presence of magnetic impurities and how the classic many-body Kondo problem, is eﬀected by various interactions. Chapter 2, mainly {{deals with the}} experimental techniques employed in the thesis. The thermal-assisted chemical vapour deposition setup used to decompose and chemically react the introduced organometallic precursors, for the preparation of C:Fe composites are discussed and its advantage over other preparation methods are emphasized. The method is optimized to provide relative size control over the nanoparticles composites and the phase compositions by varying C/Fe concentration in precursors and the pyrolysis temperature, during the co-deposition process. The various structural characterization tools {{used in the present study}} are summed up concisely in this chapter. The SQUID magnetometer system; its working principle and the various protocol used for the low temperature magnetization measurements are elaborated. Further, details regarding superconducting magnetic cryostat, utilized for the low temperature conductivity and magneto resistance measurements, are discussed. Films of C:Fe composites are grown on substrates to study the eﬀect of disorder and sample size on the conductivity behaviour of the composites at low temperature. Chapter 3, presents the outcome of the structural studies undertaken on the C:Fe composites using XRD, TEM, and HRTEM. X-ray diﬀraction measurements performed on the powder composites reveal that, in addition to the presence of sharp diﬀraction peak from nanographite, peaks corresponding to the diﬀerent phases of Fe are also seen. The eﬀect of preparation temperature on the matrix morphology is revealed from the estimation of degree of graphitization. Iron carbide is the predominant phase in all the prepared composites. For low concentration of iron, iron carbide alone is present but as the percentage of iron in the samples increased other phases of iron are also seen. The microscopic studies on the prepared compositions revealed the presence of nanosized iron particles well embedded in the partially graphitized matrix. Here again, with the increase in iron percentage, agglomeration of ferromagnetic nanoparticles are seen. The kinetics of the particle growth and the ﬁlamentous nature of the carbon matrix are also discussed. Mossbauer investigation on C:Fe composites are presented in chapter 4. The measurements revealed the iron atom occupation in the crystal lattice. In the lower Fe concentration samples, the room temperature Mossbauer spectrum revealed the presence of sextet from Fe 3 C (cementite) phase. As the percentage of iron increased, sextet from α-Fe, Fe 3 O 4 are also seen in some of the prepared compositions. Eﬀect of carbon atoms on the structure and magnetic properties of the nanoparticle species are obvious from the isomer shift measurements. Chapter 5 comprises of the various magnetic properties and interactions present in small particle system such as magnetic anisotropy, coercivity, enhanced magnetization, inter-and intra-particle interactions etc. Magnetization measurements carried out in SQUID magnetometer on the C:Fe composites and carbon ﬂakes (prepared from organic precursor, maleic anhydride alone) are presented. The enhanced magnetic properties of the nanoparticle assembly is discussed in detail. The hysteresis loops trace, with a ﬁnite coercivity at room temperature, indicates the ferromagnetic nature of the samples. At room temperature the magnetization value saturates at high magnetic ﬁeld, indicating negligible eﬀect from super paramagnetic particles on the hysteresis loop. The squareness ratio, saturation magnetization, coercivity and remanence magnetization values are analyzed in detail. The temperature dependence of magnetization shows a combination of <b>Bloch</b> <b>law</b> and Curie-Weiss behaviour, consistent with the picture of ferromagnetic clusters embedded in a carbon matrix. The Bloch’s constant is found to be larger by an order of magnitude compared to the bulk value, implying stronger dependence of magnetization with temperature. Eﬀort to understand the enhanced magnetic moment in the light of magnetism in carbon was taken up. The proximity eﬀect of ferromagnetic metal on the carbon and the hydrogen bonding with the dangling bonds, both studied in detail in literature, in connection with the induced magnetic moments in carbon, are invoked. In chapter 6, the diﬀerent conductivity regimes are identiﬁed, to study the conduction mechanisms in composites and ﬁlms. For the transport measurements pelletized samples are used for the resistivity and magneto resistance measurements. The conductivity data are analyzed based on the interplay of localization and Kondo eﬀect in the ferromagnetic disordered system. In order to understand the eﬀect of disorder and thickness on the Kondo problem, transport measurements are carried on thin ﬁlms of C:Fe composites grown on quartz and alumina substrate. Disorder induced metal-insulator transition is observed in the prepared samples. The zero-ﬁeld conductivity and magneto resistance data is ﬁtted to variable range hopping (VRH) in strong localization regime.

40|$|ABSTRACT Electroretinograms were {{obtained}} from the all-rod eye of the rat with uniform illumination of the entire retina and stimulus flashes of less than 3 msec. duration. <b>Bloch's</b> <b>law</b> of temporal summation was verified for the b-wave latency by varying the time between two equal intensity flashes and observing that no change occurred in the latency when measured from the midpoint of the two flashes. The results of this and other experiments are described in terms of a simple but general model of the latency-determining mechanism. It is shown that this latency mechanism acts as if it depends on a linear additive process; and also that a hypothetical excitatory substance which triggers activity in the sources of the b-wave must accumulate rapidly in time after the flash, approximately as t 8. The rate at which this substance accumulates is accurately represented by the diffusion equation for more than 4 to 6 log units in the flash intensity. This suggests that the rate-determining step in the latency mechanism may be diffusion-limited...|$|R
40|$|We have {{performed}} a systematic {{study of the}} magnetic properties {{of a series of}} ferrimagnetic nanoparticles of Mg(x) Fe(3 -x) O(4) (0. 8 <= x <= 1. 5) prepared by the combustion reaction method. The magnetization data can be well fitted by <b>Bloch's</b> <b>law</b> with T(3 / 2). Bloch's constant B determined from the fitting procedure was found to increase with Mg content x from similar to 3. 09 X 10 (- 5) K(- 3 / 2) for x = 0. 8 to 6. 27 X 10 (- 5) K(- 3 / 2) for x= 1. 5. The exchange integral J(AB) and the spin-wave stiffness constant D of Mg(x) Fe(3 -x) O(4) nanoparticles were also determined as similar to 0. 842 and 0. 574 meV and 296 and 202 meV angstrom(2) for specimens with x= 0. 8 and 1. 5, respectively. These results are discussed in terms of cation redistribution among A and B sites on these nanostructured spinel ferrites. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics. [doi: 10. 1063 / 1. 3359709...|$|R
