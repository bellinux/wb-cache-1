25|$|It {{is unclear}} why several nations with few female workers {{have such a}} high {{percentage}} of salaried women. One possible explanation is that so few women are active in the labor market because the demand for female employment is restricted to a few higher-paying, low-labor-intensive industries. If only a few women are needed <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> have above-average skills, then these laborers' marginal value may necessitate salary as opposed to simple wages.

Students who met the EAS requirements do not need to apply for this scheme to enter the aforementioned universities (though most of them will), <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> take part in the HKALE and participate in the mainstream scheme if they did not participate and want to pursue their studies in Hong Kong.|$|E
25|$|For {{international}} para-Alpine skiing competitions, classification is {{done through}} IPC Alpine Skiing. A national federation such as Alpine Canada handles classification for domestic competitions. For para-Nordic skiing events, classification is handled by IPC Nordic Skiing Technical Committee {{on the international}} level and by the national sports federation such as Cross-Country Canada on a country by country level. When being assessed into this classification, {{a number of things}} are considered, including reviewing the skiers medical history and medical information on the skier's disability, having a physical examination and an in person assessment of the skier training or competing. If a skier in this classification has the ability to use a ski pole of some sort, they may do so <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> changes classes and compete in LW6/8.|$|E

Rumple gives Emma a wand and tells her to open the portal if she has magic, but she doesn't think she can. Rumple decides he’d rather forget {{everything}} he’s learned so as not to alter his future, then he sends Emma and Hook to a dark vault where he keeps dangerous and unpredictable magic, where their Storybrooke outfits are restored. Hook says that Emma still has some magic in her and after seeing what happened to her parents and realizing everything Henry did to bring her to Storybrooke, she's ready to return home. Hook and Emma then notice the wand lights up with magic and open up the portal, allowing Hook and the woman to escape first. Before she can leave, Rumple holds on to Emma and demands to know what happened to Baelfire/Neal. Emma tells him what happened, then she begs him not to take away the fact he died a hero. Rumplestiltskin drinks the forgetting potion and lets go of Emma where she is pulled into the portal, which sends her, Hook, and the woman back to Storybrooke.|$|E

She further noted, [...] "but Maroon 5 are too meticulous, a little too uptight, to make good on the song's party-hearty promise. Levine and crew could be blue-eyed-soul godheads, the 21st-century Hall and Oates. <b>But</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> loosen up first." [...] Leah Greenblat of Entertainment Weekly also spotted the Def Leppard influence on [...] "Hands All Over". Writing for the Bay of Plenty Times, Tamlyn Stewart said that the song is sexy and funky and is similar to the band's works on their second studio album It Won't Be Soon Before Long (2007).

50|$|SR, {{going back}} to Vietnam, was far more potent when it {{directed}} external firepower onto the target rather than engaging it with its own weapons. Early coordination between SR and air support in Vietnam depended on visual and voice communications, without any electronics to make the delivery precise. SR teams could throw colored smoke grenades as a visual reference, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> be in dangerously close range to the enemy to do so. A slightly improved method involved their directing a Forward Air Controller aircraft to fire marking rockets onto the target, but the method was fraught with error.|$|R
