40|$|The {{effects of}} four {{alternative}} price stabilization programs for soybeans are compared using a rational expectations model and simulation. For a given government expenditure, subsidized private storage {{is the most}} efficient way to stabilize market price. For a given deadweight loss, a program of direct payments is the most efficient stabilizer of the effective farm price; this program does not stabilize market price. All four programs, including a buffer stock program and one involving both direct payments and buffer stocks, tend to destabilize quasi-rent. Programs that involve an initial <b>build-up</b> <b>of</b> <b>stocks</b> increase producer benefits and hurt consumers. Key words: buffer, price, programs, soybeans, stabilization, storage. Even though the support for price stabilization programs has been widespread, the research on their effects leaves many questions unan-swered. Do programs that stabilize prices of field crops also stabilize farm income and other dimensions of market performance? For given levels of government expenditure, what is the most effective means of stabilizing price? How do alternative price stabilization schemes affect the welfare of consumers and producers?

40|$|Emerging {{technologies}} will have important impacts on sustainability objectives. Yet {{little is known}} about the explicit feedbacks between consumer behaviour and technological change, and the potential impact on mass market penetration. We use the UK as a case-study to explore the dynamic interactions between technology supply, performance, cost, and heterogeneous consumer behaviour and the resulting influence on long term market diffusion. Simulations of competing vehicle technologies indicate that petrol hybrids (HEVs) dominate the market over the long-term because they benefit from improved performance and are able to reach the steep part of the diffusion curve by 2025 while competing technologies remain in the early stages of growth and are easier to displace in the market. This is due to the cumulative <b>build-up</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> and slow fleet turnover creating inertia in the technological system. Consequently, it will be difficult to displace incumbent technologies because of system inertia, cumulative growth in stock, long operational life, and consumer risk aversion to new unproven technologies. However, when accounting for both technological and behavioural change, simulations indicate that if investment can reach 30 - 40 % per annum growth in supply, combined with steady technology improvements, and more sophisticated agent decision making such as accounting for full technology lifecycle cost and performance, full battery electric vehicles could displace the incumbent system by 2050...|$|R

40|$|Internal {{phosphorus}} loading {{has become}} a major problem in many shallow freshwater lakes over the past decades due to the <b>build-up</b> <b>of</b> phosphorus <b>stocks</b> in the sediment. Iron is a natural capping agent which can enhance sediment P binding capacity, thus reducing P availability and shifting a lake from an algal to a macrophyte dominated state. Iron could, however, also impose toxic effects on the biota. We therefore provide a synopsis of iron toxicity studies and lake restoration measures using iron addition. Iron toxicity studies revealed that, even though iron is an essential nutrient for growth, when added in excess, it can negatively affect aquatic organisms. We found 13 studies testing the effect of iron addition as a restoration measure in the field (10) or using sediment from lakes and reservoirs in the laboratory (3). Twelve of the studies reported increased P retention after iron addition, which depended on the iron salts used and the concentrations added in two studies, whereas one study found no effect on P retention. Eight out of the nine field studies that reported biotic responses found reduced chlorophyll concentrations in the water column, whereas toxic effects of iron on organisms remained absent. Iron addition was most successful when external P loading, and concentrations of organic matter and sulphate were low as well as densities of sediment disturbing fish and crayfish. We conclude that iron addition can be a successful restoration method when these conditions are met...|$|R
40|$|The soils of {{the world}} contain more carbon than the {{combined}} total amounts occurring in vegetation and the atmosphere. Hence soils are a major reservoir of carbon in terrestrial ecosystems and an important sink. Recently, emphasis {{has been placed on}} the need to sequester carbon from atmospheric carbon dioxide into soil organic matter because of international concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and global climate change. The best strategies to built-up carbon stocks in the soil are basically those that increase the input of organic matter to the soil, and/or decrease the rate of soil organic matter decomposition. Grain crop systems based on soil ploughing and harrowing lead to CO 2 emissions combined with tremendous soil losses. In Brazil, no-tillage system was introduced to combat soil erosion by water and this soil management led to the <b>build-up</b> <b>of</b> soil carbon <b>stocks</b> with simultaneous high crop yields. However, the present procedure used to quantify carbon stocks in soils is laborious and of high cost.

40|$|Internal {{phosphorus}} loading {{has become}} a major problem in many freshwater lakes due to the <b>build-up</b> <b>of</b> nutrient <b>stocks</b> in the sediment over the past decades. Iron is a natural capping agent which naturally binds to P and can enhance sediment P binding capacity. Various restoration experiments using iron addition have been a success by reducing P availability and shifting a lake from an algal dominated state to a macrophyte dominated state. Adding iron to a lake could, however, also negatively affect lake ecosystems, as iron could impose toxic effects on the biota. Differences in the response of species to iron addition might lead to a change in community composition, favouring the more iron-tolerant species. Long term effects of addition on the biotic community are, however, relatively unknown. Nonetheless, iron addition can indirectly induce a shift from a eutrophic to a mesotrophic system that might eventually have the most important effect on the diversity of the aquatic community. To guarantee long term success of iron addition, the constraining chemical and biological factors that might reduce long term sediment P retention or inhibit macrophyte return should be addressed before or during iron application. Whereas iron addition can shift a lake from a cyanobacterial dominated state to a macrophyte dominated state, in some cases these effects are only visible on a longer term. Therefore, in order to bridge the years before water quality is fully restored, prediction of cyanobacterial scum occurrence could be a solution to protect the public from contact with these toxic scums...|$|R
40|$|Risks can {{generally}} {{be described as}} the combination of hazard, exposure and vulnerability. Using this framework, we evaluated the historical and future development of risk of fire and wind damage in European forestry at the national level. Fire risk is expected to increase, mainly as a consequence of an increase in fire hazard, defined as the Fire Weather Index in summer. Exposure, defined as forest area, is expected to increase slightly as a consequence of active afforestation and abandonment of marginal agricultural areas. Adaptation options to fire risk should therefore aim to decrease the vulnerability, where a change in tree species from conifers to broadleaves had most effect. Risk for wind damage in forests is expected to increase mainly as a consequence of increase in exposure (total growing stock) and vulnerability (defined by age class and tree species distribution). Projections of future wind climate indicate an increase in hazard (storminess) mainly over Western Europe. Adaptation options should aim to limit the increase in exposure and vulnerability. Only an increase in harvest level can stop the current <b>build-up</b> <b>of</b> growing <b>stock,</b> {{while at the same time}} it will lower vulnerability through the reduction of the share of old and vulnerable stands. Changing species from conifers to broadleaves helps to reduce vulnerability as well.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the existence of}} Markov-Perfect-Equilibria {{that give rise to}} coexisting locally stable steady states in asymmetric differential games. The strategic interactions between an incumbent in a market and a potential competitor, which tries to enter the market through product innovation, are considered. Whereas the potential entrant invests in the <b>build-up</b> <b>of</b> a knowledge <b>stock,</b> which is essential for product innovation, the incumbent tries to reduce this stock through interference activities. It is shown that in the presence of upper bounds on investment activities of both firms a Markov-Perfect-Equilibrium exists under which, depending on the initial conditions, the knowledge stock converges either to a positive steady state, thereby inducing an entry probability of one, or to a steady state with zero knowledge of the potential entrant. In the later case the entry probability is close to zero. It is shown that this Markov-Perfect-Equilibrium is characterized by a discontinuous value function for the incumbent and it is discussed that this feature is closely related to the existence of upper bounds on the investments of the players. Removing these constraints in general jeopardizes the existence of a Markov-Perfect-Equilibrium with multiple locally stable steady states...|$|R

We apply a model with twointeracting age groups within a single fish stock, where the interactionhas both biological {{and economic}} implications.

40|$|The {{state of}} the {{terrestrial}} biosphere during the Holocene and the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) was estimated from data bases and steady state simulations in former studies. Here, we use these previous estimates and run a simple globally averaged box model of the terrestrial carbon stocks driven by various paleorecords (temperature, pCO 2, sea level) from the LGM across termination I to the Holocene to determine which forcing might be appropriate to explain observed changes in the biosphere. Former forcing strength {{of this type of}} model on recent climate changes is not transferable to our problem of glacial/interglacial variations. The modelled terrestrial carbon stock at the LGM is about 1600 PgC, 600 PgC less than in preindustrial times.

40|$|Recycling {{steel scrap}} from {{different}} {{stages in the}} life cycle is an important input to secondary steel production and manufacturing. While flows and losses from pre-consumer processes are well known, there are considerable gaps in the knowledge surrounding end-of-life stocks, flows, and losses in various sectors. This thesis aims to investigate end-of-life processes for steel in mining infrastructure, focusing on offshore installations. Material Flow Analysis {{was applied to the}} current <b>stock</b> <b>of</b> offshore installations in the North Sea, and a case study concerning the decommissioning of the Frigg field. The system contains the following processes: removal, transport to onshore demolition yard, primary dismantling, recycling and market for old scrap. The chosen region for the large-scale model is the North East Atlantic. Various recycling metrics and rates obtained from literature were compared to the results obtained from the Material Flow Analysis. While decommissioning companies present material recycling rates in the range of 95 - 99 %, the actual rate was shown to be lower when obsolete stocks were included. The obsolete <b>stock</b> <b>of</b> offshore installations consists of structures that are exempt from legislations regarding decommissioning. Concrete structures that contain reinforced steel, steel installations weighing over 10, 000 tonnes, and disused pipelines can be left behind when an oil field is closed down, contributing to a <b>build-up</b> <b>of</b> steel <b>stocks</b> that are not recovered. The analysis gave an estimate of 360 000 tonnes of steel in obsolete structures in the North Sea, not including disused pipelines. Recycling metrics are often only concerned with the amount of material that is recovered from the field, and not what is left behind. When obsolete structures are included, the rates for recycling are significantly lower than what the industry reports, which {{is a direct result of}} choosing system boundaries that skew the results. Steel embedded in reinforced concrete and steel piles from jacket type platforms are examples of losses that are not included in current recycling statisticsThe removal of offshore installations is regulated strictly by both national and international legislations, and is not driven by the demand for steel scrap. This is both due to the high cost of removal, safety considerations and due to the desires of other stakeholders such as the fishing industry. </p...|$|R
