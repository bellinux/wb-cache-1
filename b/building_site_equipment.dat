40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{research}} regarding a singular technique adopted by Renaissance carpentry. The technique consists {{in the assembly}} of timbers whose size is shorter than the span to cover (and {{in some cases the}} span can be quite considerable). The wooden composite beam technique appeared in Ferrara probably {{in the course of the}} 15 th century as a reasonable way to cover huge and important rooms which otherwise would have required too long and too high one-piece beams, difficult to be provided locally. Usually a wooden composite beam consists of some pieces properly shaped and connected to one another with clinched nails in order to reproduce the unity of the entire beam. The work moves from a historical approach based on the analysis of ancient documents and from “in situ” instrumental surveys. The composite beams are characterised by a mechanical behaviour which is totally different from the one of the traditional one-piece beam: the shape and the mutual position of the pieces forming the composite beam give rise to an internal force diffusion which reminds an arch-like behaviour as described for the first time by Leon Battista Alberti in his De Re Aedificatoria. Moreover detailed surveys have pointed out an upward slope of the intrados one-piece element of such beams, intentionally produced to limit the inflection due to the applied loads, as confirmed by some notes of Leonardo Da Vinci in the “Codice Atlantico” and by the systematic encoding of the 19 th century manuals. Therefore the techniques and the <b>building</b> <b>site</b> <b>equipments</b> used to bend, to assemble and to raise the composite beams are also investigated. The numerous measurements carried out to survey the exact geometry of the components and the proportional ratios between them has allowed also to set up a specific survey methodology for such composite beams...|$|R

50|$|In the Second World War {{the bulk}} of the factory <b>buildings,</b> <b>sites</b> and <b>equipment</b> was {{destroyed}} and, after most of the remaining sites had been given to the Soviet Union as war reparations, there was only about a tenth of the facility left for starting it up again as the VEB Spinnereimaschinenbau in 1946. Until the reunification of Germany the firm was the leading manufacturer of textile machines for the production of spun cotton in the Eastern Bloc.In 1990 this firm became a Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung (the German form of a limited liability company), the Chemnitzer Spinnereimaschinenbau GmbH, and was taken over by the trustee company. At the end of 1994 it was sold to the holding company, Neue Länder. Its main market in Eastern Europe was breaking up and overwhelming competition led to its amalgamation with two other Saxon textile machinery companies to form the CSM-Sächsische Spinnereimaschinen GmbH Chemnitz, but despite producing technically, high-quality products the firm ceased production in 1998 and subsequent folded, whereupon the last manufacturing elements of the firm's long tradition finally disappeared.|$|R
