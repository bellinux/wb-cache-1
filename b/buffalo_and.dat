40|$|A {{comparative}} {{study on the}} prevalence of Anaplasma parasite was conducted on ticks carrying <b>buffaloes</b> <b>and</b> cattle. Five hundred blood samples of both animals (250 of each) were collected during February, March and April. Thin blood smears on glass slides were made, fixed in 100 % methyl alcohol and examined. Microscopic examination revealed that 205 (41 %) animals had Anaplasma parasites, out of which 89, 44 and 72 animals had Anaplasma marginale, Anaplasma centrale and mixed infection respectively. Infected <b>buffaloes</b> <b>and</b> cattle were 75 and 130 respectively. The infection in female was 53 <b>and</b> 92 in <b>buffaloes</b> <b>and</b> cattle respectively. Twenty-two and 92 blood samples of male were found positive in <b>buffaloes</b> <b>and</b> cattle respectively. Comparative study revealed that the cattle were 26. 82 % more susceptible than buffaloes. The parasite prevailing percentage in female of both animals was slightly {{higher than that of}} the male. This investigation was aimed at studying the comparative prevalence of Anaplasma parasite in tick carrying <b>buffaloes</b> <b>and</b> cattle...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} 215 <b>buffaloes</b> <b>and</b> 180 cows {{with the history}} of repeat {{breeding}} and prolonged oestrus period (> 24 hours) were used. All of the animals had repeated at least twice.

In group I, 70 <b>buffaloes</b> <b>and</b> 55 cows were inseminated twice, first at 12 - 18 hours after the start of oestrus and then 12 - 24 hours later. In group II, 95 <b>buffaloes</b> <b>and</b> 80 cows were inseminated once at 12 - 18 hours after the start of oestrus. These animals were then subjected to forced racing for at least 30 minutes.

5|$|Albany {{has been}} a center of {{transportation}} for much of its history. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Albany saw development of the turnpike and by 1815, Albany was the turnpike center of the state. Simeon De Witt developed a grid block system in 1794, and renamed streets for birds and mammals that had honored British royalty. This grid was intersected by the major arterials coming out of Albany, which cut through the city at unexpected angles. The construction of the turnpike across the state, in conjunction with canal and railroad systems, made Albany the hub of transportation for pioneers going to <b>Buffalo</b> <b>and</b> the Michigan Territory in the early- and mid-19th century.|$|E
