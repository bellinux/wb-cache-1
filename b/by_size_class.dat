This thesis details research focused on the use of small, inexpensive, artificial reef modules as replacement juvenile fish habitat within marinas. My research hypothesis was that the placement of small, structurally complex artificial reef modules would increase fish abundance and species richness relative to unmodified marina seawalls. Non-destructive visual surveys of fishes were completed monthly for 14 months for 12 artificial reef sites and 12 control (unmodified) sites within the Nova Southeastern University Guy Harvey Oceanographic Center (NSU-GHOC) marina. Divers recorded species, abundance, and size class (0 - 2 cm, 3 ̆e 2 - 5 cm, 3 ̆e 5 - 10 cm, 3 ̆e 10 - 20 cm, 3 ̆e 20 - 30 cm, 3 ̆e 30 - 50 cm, 3 ̆e 50 cm) for all sites. Data was statistically analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post-hoc Student Newman-Keuls (SNK) tests to explore differences in mean abundance, mean species richness, and mean abundance and species richness <b>by</b> <b>size</b> <b>class</b> and month. Total mean fish abundance and mean species richness (all months and sizes combined) were both significantly higher at artificial reef sites than at control sites. Artificial reef sites were consistently higher in total abundance and species richness when analyzed by month. Analysis of mean abundance <b>by</b> <b>size</b> <b>class</b> found the 3 ̆e 2 - 5 cm, 3 ̆e 5 - 10 cm, 3 ̆e 10 - 20 cm and 3 ̆e 20 - 30 cm classes were significantly higher for artificial reef sites.

Fishes from the grunt (Haemulidae) and snapper (Lutjanidae) families contributed the most to the total abundance for both types of sites.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The royal crab Chaceon ramosae {{is one of}} {{the three}} species of deep-sea crabs {{currently}} ex-ploited in Brazil. The royal crab fishery started in 2001 with foreign vessels that were extensively monitored by observers and tracked by satellite. A management plan implemented in 2005 was based only on biomass dynamics, as biological knowledge of the resource was limited at that date. Samples taken aboard were used to determine size at first sexual maturity for males and females by studying the use of allometric growth of che-lae and abdomen in relation to carapace width (CW), the proportion of females with opened vulvae and eggs in the pleopods, and males showing copula marks on the first ambulatory legs. Morphometric maturity was at-tained, on average, at 12. 1 cm (males) and 10. 7 cm (females). The CW 50 % was estimated to be 10. 9 cm and 12. 2 cm for females, respectively considering the vulva condition and eggs in the pleopods, and 13. 6 cm for males. <b>By</b> <b>size</b> <b>class,</b> the maximum estimated proportions of ovigerous females <b>by</b> <b>size</b> <b>class</b> was 0. 4 and of males with copula marks was 0. 6, suggesting a bi-annual reproductive cycle for individuals of the species.

Great caution is needed in interpreting these figures as exploitable biomass. Increased exploitation of large components of this production such as mesopelagic fishes or benthic organisms {{is likely to have}} serious ecosystem wide negative consequences and other problems. The fishery production potential estimates can be used in concert with observed catch data to estimate ecosystem exploitation rates for major ecosystem components including benthos, benthivores, planktivores, and piscivores. Ecosystem exploitation rates for the benthos are uniformly low, reflecting the generally low level of landings reported relative to other ecosystem components. Benthivores and planktivores exhibit generally low to moderate ecosystem exploitation rates, typically < 20 %.

This growth is the sum of 8. 1 million gross job gains from opening and expanding establishments, and 7. 2 million gross job losses from contracting and closing establishments. The new BED data have captured the attention of economists and policymakers across the country, and these data are becoming a major contributor to our understanding of employment growth and business cycles in the U.

Although it is trivial to classify a business into a size class in any given quarter, it is difficult to classify a business into a size class for a longitudinal analysis of employment growth.

Furthermore, these alternative classification methodologies result in sharply different portraits of employment growth <b>by</b> <b>size</b> <b>class.</b> In this article, we discuss the alternative statistical methodologies that the BLS considered for creating size class tabulations from the Business Employment Dynamics data.

Yet, an overall assessment should not lead us to overlook national features when comparing small and large companies. In particular, three main groups emerge: in Germanic countries (Austria and Germany), the gap is the largest, mainly because of regulatory specificities. In a second cluster, companies from Denmark, France and Portugal exhibit significant differences in averages across sizes but at a lower extent than in the first group. As regards the other countries, even though the size gap is still the dominant pattern, the situation is less definite and deserves case by case analysis.
