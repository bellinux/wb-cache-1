40|$|Using camera trapping, I {{investigated}} carnivore {{occurrence in}} a high severity burn for four years in mixed conifer forests in the San Bernardino Mountains of southern California, USA. The objectives {{of this study were}} to catalog carnivores present in <b>burned</b> <b>and</b> unburned forests and, employing negative binomial regression analysis, to compare visitation of the <b>burned</b> <b>and</b> unburned forests by three carnivores: Lynx rufus, Canis latrans and Urocyon cinereoargenteus. In the summer of 2008, I placed 12 cameras along roads in a 9 km 2 area that burned in a stand-replacing wildfire and another 12 cameras in an adjacent unburned area of similar size. Ten mammalian carnivores were photo-captured in 2976 camera days; all the species were captured in the <b>burn</b> area <b>and</b> seven in unburned area. Lynx rufus was equally frequent in the <b>burned</b> <b>and</b> unburned forests. Canis latrans was more prevalent in unburned than <b>burned</b> forests <b>and</b> Urocyon cinereoargenteus preferred the <b>burn</b> area <b>and</b> was highly nocturnal in <b>burned</b> <b>and</b> unburned forests...|$|R

5|$|In {{the third}} segment, <b>Burns</b> <b>and</b> Smithers {{go down to}} the lab during Homer's nightmare. The animators decided to make the {{animation}} a bit more impressive, and decided to do the concave and convex images of <b>Burns</b> <b>and</b> Smithers. Even though it was tough and took up more time, the producers felt that it was a necessary tour-de-force. Originally, Homer's robotic voice was done post-animation in order to avoid stress on the voice actor. One of the writers who created the Davy Crockett joke thought it was so funny that he actually mimicked the actions of Mr. Burns putting on Homer's brain in the writing room; the producers thought that it was hilarious, so they decided to add it into the episode.|$|E

40|$|Through {{modification}} of structural characteristics, ecological {{processes such as}} fire can affect microhabitat parameters, which in turn can influence community composition dynamics. The prevalence of high-severity forest fires is increasing in the southern and western United States, creating the necessity to better understand effects of high-severity fire, and subsequent postfire management actions, on forest ecosystems. In this study we used a recent high-severity wildfire in the Lost Pines ecoregion of Texas to assess effects of the wildfire and postfire clearcutting on six microclimate parameters: air temperature, absolute humidity, mean wind speed, maximum wind speed, soil temperature, and soil moisture. We also assessed differences between <b>burned</b> areas <b>and</b> <b>burned</b> <b>and</b> subsequently clearcut areas for short-term survivorship of loblolly pine Pinus taeda seedling trees. We found that {{during the summer months}} approximately 2 y after the wildfire, mean and maximum wind speed differed between unburned <b>and</b> <b>burned</b> areas, as well as <b>burned</b> <b>and</b> <b>burned</b> <b>and</b> subsequently clearcut areas. Our results indicated air temperature, absolute humidity, soil temperature, and soil moisture did not differ between unburned <b>and</b> <b>burned</b> areas, or <b>burned</b> <b>and</b> <b>burned</b> <b>and</b> subsequently clearcut areas, during the study period. We found that short-term survivorship of loblolly pine seedling trees was influenced primarily by soil type, but was also lower in clearcut habitat compared with habitat containing dead standing trees. Ultimately, however, the outcome of the reforestation initiative will likely depend primarily o...|$|R
