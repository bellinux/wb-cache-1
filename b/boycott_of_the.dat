5|$|Seven {{countries}} {{participated in}} the first contest. Since then, the number of entries has increased steadily. In 1970, a Nordic-led <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contest {{reduced the number of}} countries entering to twelve. By the late 1980s, over twenty countries had become standard.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Meany {{was one of}} the {{permanent}} representatives of the AFL to the National War Labor Board. During the war, he established close relationships with prominent anticommunists in the American labor movement, including David Dubinsky, Jay Lovestone and Matthew Woll. In October 1945, he led the AFL <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> founding conference of the World Federation of Trade Unions, which welcomed participation by labor unions from the Soviet Union and was later called a communist front.|$|E
50|$|Awaleh and the PND {{split from}} the ruling {{coalition}} in 2010 after Guelleh pushed through constitutional changes {{allowing him to}} run for a third term. The party re-joined <b>the</b> opposition and <b>boycotted</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2011 election.|$|R
5|$|Chad {{participated in}} 12 Summer Olympics between its debut at the 1964 Summer Games in Tokyo, Japan, and the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The only {{occasions}} {{in that period}} which they did not attend was at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, Soviet Union. On both occasions, it was because they had joined with international <b>boycotts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> events. The first <b>boycott</b> was because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inclusion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New Zealand team at the Games despite <b>the</b> breach <b>of</b> <b>the</b> international sports <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> South Africa by the nation's rugby union team shortly prior. In 1980, Chad joined with the United States led boycott over <b>the</b> 1979 invasion <b>of</b> Afghanistan during <b>the</b> Soviet–Afghan War.|$|R
50|$|IAWM Congresses feature compositions, performances, and {{research}} papers {{about women in}} music. IAWM members offer women-in-music courses in colleges and universities. Advocacy by the International Alliance for Women in Music has contributed to <b>the</b> inclusion <b>of</b> women composers in college music history textbooks. In another effort toward ending gender discrimination, the IAWM led successful <b>boycotts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American concerts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra in the 1990s.|$|R
5|$|He {{qualified}} for the U.S. Olympic Team in 1980, {{as a member of}} the U.S. team in the men's 4×200-meter freestyle relay, but was unable to compete because of the United States-led <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1980 Summer Olympics held in Moscow. After completing his college career in 1981, Larson was tired of swimming and quit, only to return to competition a year later because he missed the focus. Larson continued his training with the program that coach Randy Reese had created for post-college swimmers in Gainesville, Florida.|$|E
5|$|On May 10, six {{downtown}} stores {{opened their}} lunch counters to black customers {{for the first}} time. The customers arrived in groups {{of two or three}} during the afternoon and were served without incident. At the same time, African Americans ended their six-week-old <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> downtown stores. The plan continued successfully and the lunch counters were integrated without any further incidents of violence. Nashville thus became the first major city in the South to begin desegregating its public facilities.|$|E
5|$|The 1976 All Blacks tour of {{apartheid}} South Africa generated much controversy {{and led to}} the <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal by 33 African nations after the IOC refused to ban the team. New Zealand again failed to win the test series in South Africa: they did not do so until 1996, after the fall {{of apartheid}}. The 1976 tour contributed to the Gleneagles Agreement being adopted by the Commonwealth Heads of State in 1977.|$|E
5|$|Swaziland {{participated in}} ten Summer Olympics between {{its debut in}} the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, West Germany, and the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

50|$|Conservative and {{religious}} groups called for <b>boycotts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original American publication of A&F Quarterly (published from 1997 to 2003) for its sexually explicit nature. The magazine contained nude photography by Bruce Weber, articles about sex, and recipes for alcoholic beverages.

Advertisements for the A&F Quarterly appeared in Interview, Out, Rolling Stone and Vanity Fair.|$|R
40|$|In {{the late}} 1990 s and through 2001, {{consumer}} activists protested Nike’s alleged “sweatshops ” around the globe. This {{was a new}} sort of protest that went beyond the picket lines and <b>boycotts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past – this protest extensively used email and listservs to spread messages and mobilize action at an unprecedented pace and for a very low cost (Peretti and Micheletti 2011). Nike responded to the consumer movement...|$|R
5|$|The Philippines {{has participated}} in the Summer Olympic Games since 1924 {{and was the first}} country in Southeast Asia to compete and win a medal. The country had competed in every Summer Olympic Games since then, except when they participated in the American-led <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1980 Summer Olympics. The Philippines is also the first {{tropical}} nation to compete at the Winter Olympic Games debuting in the 1972 edition.|$|E
5|$|The year 1968 {{had seen}} {{turmoil in the}} United States, {{including}} riots and the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King. Prior to the Olympics in Mexico City in October 1968, some African Americans, led by activist Harry Edwards, had urged a <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Games, but found little enthusiasm among athletes, reluctant to waste years of effort. The atmosphere was made more tense by unrest in Mexico City before the Games which left dozens dead.|$|E
5|$|There {{had been}} growing calls for boycotts of Chinese goods and the 2008 Olympics in Beijing in protest of China's human rights record, and in {{response}} to Tibetan disturbances. Ultimately, no nation supported a boycott. In August 2008, the government of Georgia called for a <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2014 Winter Olympics, set to be held in Sochi, Russia, in response to Russia's participation in the 2008 South Ossetia war.|$|E
50|$|Davis donated almost $400,000 to the Trump Victory Committee in September 2016. In an {{interview}} given to Wall Street Journal reporter Sara Germano {{on the day}} following the 2016 presidential election of Donald Trump, a New Balance senior executive suggested support for Trump due to {{his opposition to the}} Trans-Pacific Partnership. Widely reported social-media reaction documented numerous New Balance owners destroying or disposing of their shoes—with many pledging lifetime <b>boycotts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company.|$|R
500|$|There {{were three}} <b>boycotts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1956 Melbourne Olympics: the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland refused to attend because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{repression}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hungarian uprising by the Soviet Union, but did send an equestrian delegation to Stockholm; Cambodia, Egypt, Iraq, and Lebanon <b>boycotted</b> <b>the</b> Games because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Suez Crisis; and China (the [...] "People's Republic <b>of</b> China") <b>boycotted</b> <b>the</b> Games because Taiwan {{was allowed to}} compete in the Games as <b>the</b> [...] "Republic <b>of</b> China".|$|R
50|$|During {{its history}} 142 people {{sat in the}} upper house. With <b>the</b> {{addition}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Unionist Lord Mayor of Belfast Corporation and Mayor of Londonderry Corporation, together with <b>boycotts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Commons at various times by nationalist parties and fragmentation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opposition into some parties too small to elect a Senator alone, the upper house proved {{to be even more}} heavily Unionist than the lower house. However a Nationalist, Thomas Stanislaus McAllister, served two periods as deputy speaker.|$|R
5|$|As a young social worker, in 1963 Stephenson led a <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bristol Omnibus Company, protesting {{against its}} refusal to employ Black or Asian drivers or conductors. After a 60-day boycott {{supported}} by thousands of Bristolians, the company revoked its colour bar in August. In 1964 Stephenson achieved national fame when he refused to leave a public house until he was served, resulting in a trial {{on a charge of}} failing to leave a licensed premises. His campaigns were instrumental in paving the way for the first Race Relations Act, in 1965. Stephenson is a Freeman of the City of Bristol and was awarded an OBE in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{retirement}} from athletics, Brundage became a sports administrator, rising rapidly {{through the ranks}} in United States sports groups. As leader of America's Olympic organizations, he fought zealously against a <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1936 Summer Olympics, which had been awarded to Germany before the rise of its Nazi government and its subsequent, escalating persecution of Jews. Although Brundage was successful in getting a team to the Games in Berlin, its participation was controversial and has remained so. Brundage {{was elected to the}} IOC that year, and quickly became a major figure in the Olympic movement. He was elected IOC president in 1952.|$|E
5|$|However, another {{obstacle}} arose {{with the}} Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, {{which resulted in}} a <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Games by {{a large part of the}} Western World, led by the United States. The Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser was also the patron of the Australian Olympic Committee, and significant political pressure came to bear on the athletes to boycott the Games. Tonelli, however, realised that only the sportspeople would suffer from a boycott and that trade relations would continue unabated. He took a leadership role among the athletes to fight for their right to compete.|$|E

"The {{divestment}} {{campaign that}} has been far more successful in Western Europe needs to be reinvigorated in North America – as must <b>the</b> <b>boycotting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Israeli cultural and academic institutions ...

50|$|As {{developed}} by Rogers, the corporate campaign incorporates specialized research and a power {{analysis of a}} targeted company's corporate, financial and political ties, to design specific strategies and tactics that increase economic and political pressure on the company, its top executives, directors and those institutions that can influence them. Often, the corporate campaign will focus on individual parts of a company (i.e. its directors, executives, creditors, shareholders and other funding sources) as well as urge widespread <b>boycotts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company's products.|$|R
5|$|As {{early as}} {{three years after}} independence, the Naga National Council called for a <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> Independence Day in {{northeast}} India. Separatist protests in this region intensified in the 1980s; calls for boycotts and terrorist attacks by insurgent organisations such as the United Liberation Front <b>of</b> Assam and <b>the</b> National Democratic Front of Bodoland, marred celebrations. With increasing insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir from the late 1980s, separatist protesters boycotted Independence Day there with bandh (strikes), use of black flags and by flag burning. Terrorist outfits such as Lashkar-e-Taiba, the Hizbul Mujahideen and the Jaish-e-Mohammed have issued threats, and have carried out attacks around Independence Day. <b>Boycotting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> celebration has also been advocated by insurgent Maoist rebel organisations.|$|R
5|$|In 1926 he left Cambridge for the University of Göttingen {{to study}} under Max Born. Göttingen {{was one of}} the world's leading centers for {{theoretical}} physics. Oppenheimer made friends who went on to great success, including Werner Heisenberg, Pascual Jordan, Wolfgang Pauli, Paul Dirac, Enrico Fermi and Edward Teller. He was known for being too enthusiastic in discussion, sometimes to the point of taking over seminar sessions. This irritated some of Born's other students so much that Maria Goeppert presented Born with a petition signed by herself and others threatening a <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> class unless he made Oppenheimer quiet down. Born left it out on his desk where Oppenheimer could read it, and it was effective without a word being said.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1999, a geopolitical dispute with the global Islamic {{community}} and Jewish groups in the United States and Israel arose over an Israeli franchisee opening stores in the Israeli-occupied territories. When Burger King franchisee in Israel, Rikamor, Ltd., opened a store in the West Bank settlement of Ma'aleh Adumim in August of that year, Islamic groups, including the Arab League and American Muslims for Jerusalem, argued that international Burger King parent Burger King Corporation's licensing of the store helped legitimize the illegal settlement. Beyond the called-for Islamic <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company, the Arab League also threatened the revocation of the business licenses of Burger King's primary Middle Eastern franchise in the 22 countries {{that are part of}} the League's membership.|$|E
5|$|Initially, this protest did not {{attract a}} great deal of attention, and even the IRA {{regarded}} it as a side-issue compared to their armed campaign. It began to attract attention when Tomás Ó Fiaich, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Armagh, visited the prison and condemned the conditions there. In 1979, former MP Bernadette McAliskey stood in the election for the European Parliament on a platform of support for the protesting prisoners, and won 5.9% of the vote across Northern Ireland, even though Sinn Féin had called for a <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> election.|$|E
2500|$|Within months, the Wisconsin Defense League {{changed its}} name and grew teeth, calling itself the Wisconsin Loyalty Legion, with Simons as head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> group's {{literature}} department. This organization engaged in repressing [...] "unpatriotic" [...] activity during <b>the</b> war, urging <b>boycotts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German-language press, opposing <b>the</b> teaching <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German language in the schools, coercing citizens into <b>the</b> purchase <b>of</b> government Liberty Bonds, and gathering mobs to shout down socialist and other [...] "disloyal" [...] speakers.

5|$|Jenner's 1976 {{world record}} {{was broken by}} four points by Daley Thompson in 1980; Thompson's record was tainted by the U.S. led <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moscow Olympics. In 1985, Jenner's Olympic decathlon score was reevaluated against the IAAF's updated decathlon scoring table and was {{reported}} as 8,634 for comparative purposes. This converted mark stood as the American record until 1991, when it was surpassed by eventual gold medalist, and world record holder, Dan O'Brien of Dan & Dave fame. , Jenner was ranked twenty-fifth on the world all-time list and ninth on the American all-time list.

5|$|The Melodifestival {{has failed}} to be staged on three occasions. In 1964, the {{competition}} was cancelled due to an artist's strike; Sweden did not send a song to Eurovision that year. Sweden was absent at Eurovision {{for a second time}} in 1970 because of a Nordic <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> voting system, which had led to a four-way tie for first place at the 1969 contest. After SR staged the 1975 contest in Stockholm, left-wing groups argued that Sweden should not spend money to win and host Eurovision again. This led to mass demonstrations against commercial music and the organisation of an anti-commercial Alternativfestivalen. Therefore, Sweden decided not to send a song to Eurovision 1976, but returned in 1977.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet {{invasion}} of Afghanistan in December 1979 and threatened <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow led organizers to consider again postponing the Canada Cup. While Eagleson initially favoured allowing the tournament {{to go ahead}} regardless of the political situation, he ultimately agreed that Hockey Canada should again postpone the Canada Cup after the Canadian Government joined the Olympic boycott. A brief effort to move the tournament to Sweden was quickly put down when Eagleson informed them that neither Hockey Canada nor the National Hockey League Players Association (NHLPA) would participate in such an event.|$|E
