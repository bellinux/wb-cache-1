Fig.3‑8b illustrates the situation as it appears in the moving frame. It is apparent that the space and time components of the four-momentum go to infinity as the velocity of the moving frame approaches c.|$|E
500|$|Title {{contender}} Alonso and Ferrari {{were hoping}} for damp conditions during the race, stating: [...] "Wet races are a bit more unpredictable so we {{need some kind of}} damp race with many things happening, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> in normal conditions, fighting for the championship will be very difficult".|$|E
500|$|ILM's {{visual effects}} {{supervisor}} Scott Farrar said that [...] "not {{only were the}} film's effects ambitious, they also had to be designed for 3-D", and explained the company's solutions for the new perspective: [...] "We did make sure things are as bright as possible; Michael called up theatre owners {{to make sure they}} keep the lamps bright in the theatres... make everything a little sharper, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> through the steps, no matter what, {{when you get to the}} final screening things tend to go less sharp." [...] On the last weekend of ILM's work on Dark of the Moon, the company's entire render farm was being used for the film, giving ILM more than 200,000 hours of rendering power a day—or equivalent to 22.8 years of rendering time in a 24-hour period. Farrar embraced the detail in creating giant robots for 3-D, making sure that in close-ups of the Transformers' faces [...] "you see all the details in the nooks and crannies of these pieces. It's totally unlike a plain surface subject like a human head or an animated head." [...] The supervisor said that Bay's style of cinematography helped integrate the robots into the scenes, as [...] "Michael is keen on having foreground/midground/background depth in his shots, even in normal live-action shots. He'll say, ’Put some stuff hanging here!' It could be women's stockings or forks and knives dangling from a string out of focus – it doesn't matter, but it gives you depth, and focus depth, and makes it more interesting." ...|$|E

Inter won the game 4–0, with Eto'o saying, [...] "We will remain humble <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> there are sides {{out there that are}} better than us, so we will just take it one match at a time and we will go as far as it takes us." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dukat {{played a}} {{versatile}} role throughout the series and {{was often a}} nuanced character. In the words of Deep Space Nine co-executive producer Ronald D. Moore, [...] "I don't {{think of him as}} being completely evil through and through ... He can be charming. He can be generous. He can do the right thing. All of that somehow makes his 'evil' actions all the more despicable, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> there was the potential in there for him to be a better person." [...] Ultimately, despite the character's versatility, [...] "Dukat is a bad guy. A very bad guy." [...] Indeed, StarTrek.com describes him as [...] "the most complex and fully developed villain in Star Trek history".|$|E
2500|$|During the 2000 Presidential election, Lee Alcorn, {{president}} of the Dallas NAACP branch, criticized Al Gore's selection of Senator Joe Lieberman for his Vice-Presidential candidate because Lieberman was Jewish. On a gospel talk radio show on station KHVN, Alcorn stated, [...] "If we get a Jew person, then what I'm wondering is, I mean, what is this movement for, you know? Does it {{have anything to do}} with the failed peace talks?" [...] … [...] "So I think we need to be very suspicious of any kind of partnerships between the Jews at that kind of level <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> their interest primarily has to do with money and these kind of things." ...|$|E

5000|$|The program {{met with}} {{resistance}} from some English-speaking parishioners, who felt [...] "as {{though they were}} being outnumbered," [...] according to St. Finbar's pastor. Father Howard described the backlash to the Spanish Mass: [...] "It {{was a long time}} in coming, and it was painful <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> would hurt some of the good, solid families that have been here.

5000|$|Danet {{predicted}} {{that a new}} form of social control would replace the legal one, had their proposal to reform the law been approved. [...] "If it has been possible to believe for a time that there was to be a withdrawal of legislation, it was not <b>because</b> <b>we</b> thought that we were living in a liberal period but <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> more subtle forms of sexual supervision would be set up - and perhaps the apparent freedom that camouflaged these more subtle, more diffuse social controls was going to extend beyond the field of the juridical and the penal".|$|R

5000|$|On Election Day, November 4, 1952, Barry Goldwater {{defeated}} incumbent Ernest McFarland by a slim margin, winning by 6,725 out {{of approximately}} 260,000 votes cast, {{becoming the first}} Republican to represent Arizona in the U.S. Senate since 1920. Goldwater, writing to Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy, said of the results, [...] "The election victory was not entirely a surprise, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> McFarland, carrying the weight of Truman's mistakes around his neck, would {{have a difficult time}} winning, particularly {{in view of the fact}} that I had spent nearly all of my life campaigning for this job, whether I realized it or not." ...|$|R

We organized education and awareness campaigns on sex trafficking and labor trafficking in the U.S. and abroad. And, perhaps most important, we dared to challenge a subtext in the mainstream human rights movement, a subtext that said, [...] "If we can only get AIDS, STDs, violence, exploitation and rape, drug addiction and drug trafficking, international organized crime and other horrible elements out of prostitution, then {{it could be a}} legitimate career option for young women." ...|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{being the}} fifth {{game in the}} {{successful}} Shining series, Sega allotted the same budget for Shining Force II as it had for the first game in the series, Shining in the Darkness. Additionally, producer/co-programmer Hiroyuki Takahasi remarked in a 2009 interview that [...] "We were in a really precarious position at <b>that</b> point, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> if <b>we</b> couldn't produce another hit we would have no future." [...] As a result, most of the Shining series development team dropped out {{and had to be}} replaced with new staff for the production of Shining Force II. Hiroyuki Takahashi summarized the development of the game with [...] "Shining Force II was an experimental title where we improved the story and enhanced the game's 'RPG-ness'." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] {{announced}} Bradley, [...] "we'll {{plan for}} the future. The boat has fuel, provisions and water for a month, I believe you said, Plesser; there are ten of us to man it. We have a last sad duty here--we must search for Miss La Rue and Mr. Tyler. I say a sad duty <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> we shall not find them; but it is none the less our duty to comb the shoreline, firing signal shells at intervals, that we at least may leave at last with full knowledge {{that we have done}} all that men might do to locate them." ...|$|E
60|$|It must be conceded, {{to begin}} with, {{that the fact}} that two things have been found often {{together}} and never apart does not, by itself, suffice to prove demonstratively that they will be found together in the next case we examine. The most we can hope is that the oftener things are found together, the more probable it becomes that they will be found together another time, and that, if they have been found together often enough, the probability will amount almost to certainty. It can never quite reach certainty, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> in spite of frequent repetitions there sometimes is a failure at the last, {{as in the case of}} the chicken whose neck is wrung. Thus probability is all we ought to seek.|$|E
6000|$|... "When {{we see a}} monk {{going about}} with a lion and looking up into heaven, we know that that is St. Mark. When we see a monk with a book and a pen, looking tranquilly up to heaven, {{trying to think of}} a word, we know that that is St. Matthew. When we see a monk sitting on a rock, looking tranquilly up to heaven, with a human skull beside him, and without other baggage, we know that that is St. Jerome. <b>Because</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> he always went flying light in the matter of baggage. When we see other monks looking tranquilly up to heaven, but having no trade-mark, we always ask who those parties are. We do this because we humbly wish to learn." ...|$|E
6000|$|If we {{had such}} a Comforter as that, could we not take evil from his hands, as well as good? We have had fathers of our flesh who {{corrected}} us, and we gave them reverence. They chastised us, but we loved and trusted them, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> they loved and trusted us--chastised us to make us better--chastised us because they trusted us to become better. But {{if we can find}} a Father of our spirits, of our souls, shall we not rather be in subjection to Him and live? If He sent us a Comforter, to comfort and guide, and inspire, and strengthen us, shall we not say of that Comforter--"Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him." ...|$|R
5000|$|It somehow {{implies that}} there is ‘verbal’ {{sociology}} and ‘visual’ sociology.

60|$|How far such {{conditions}} may have acted upon the very earliest human inhabitants of Sussex--the palæolithic savages of the drift--before the last Glacial epoch, {{it is impossible}} to say, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> many of them did not then exist, and that the present configuration of the county is largely due to subsequent agencies. Britain was then united to the continent by a broad belt of land, filling up the bed of the English Channel, and it possessed a climate wholly {{different from that of the}} present day; while the position of the drift and the river gravels shows that the sculpture of the surface was then in many respects unlike the existing distribution of hill and valley. We must confine ourselves, therefore, to the later or recent period (subsequent to the last glaciation of Britain), during which man has employed implements of polished stone, of bronze, and of iron.|$|E
60|$|St. Clare smiled. You must excuse him, he couldn't help it,--for St. Clare could smile yet. For {{so bright}} and placid was the {{farewell}} voyage {{of the little}} spirit,--by such sweet and fragrant breezes was the small bark borne towards the heavenly shores,--that {{it was impossible to}} realize that it was death that was approaching. The child felt no pain,--only a tranquil, soft weakness, daily and almost insensibly increasing; and she was so beautiful, so loving, so trustful, so happy, that one could not resist the soothing influence of that air of innocence and peace which seemed to breathe around her. St. Clare found a strange calm coming over him. It was not hope,--that was impossible; it was not resignation; it was only a calm resting in the present, which seemed so beautiful that he wished to think of no future. It was like that hush of spirit which we feel amid the bright, mild woods of autumn, when the bright hectic flush is on the trees, and the last lingering flowers by the brook; and we joy in it all the more, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> soon it will all pass away.|$|E
60|$|The same reality pervades all teaching. The man may teach by doing, and not otherwise. If he can {{communicate}} himself he can teach, {{but not by}} words. He teaches who gives, and he learns who receives. There is no teaching until the pupil is brought into the same state or principle in which you are; a transfusion takes place; he is you and you are he; then is a teaching, and by no unfriendly chance or bad company can he ever quite lose the benefit. But your propositions run out of one ear as they ran in at the other. We see it advertised that Mr. Grand will deliver an oration on the Fourth of July, and Mr. Hand before the Mechanics' Association, {{and we do not}} go thither, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> these gentlemen will not communicate their own character and experience to the company. If we had reason to expect such a confidence we should go through all inconvenience and opposition. The sick would be carried in litters. But a public oration is an escapade, a non-committal, an apology, a gag, and not a communication, not a speech, not a man.|$|E
50|$|Capt. Andy Haldane wasn't an idol. He was human.

He was the finest Marine officer I ever knew. The loss of many close friends grieved me deeply on Peleliu and Okinawa. But {{to all of us}} the loss of our company commander at Peleliu was like losing a parent we depended upon for security - not our physical security, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> was a commodity beyond our reach in combat, but our mental security.... So ended the outstanding combat career of a fine officer who had distinguished himself at Guadalcanal, Cape Gloucester, and Peleliu. We had lost our leader and our friend.

40|$|In {{our project}} our focus was the problem: ”How can we {{reduce the amount}} of thrown {{cigarette}} litter, most likely?”. From this point we started by finding the economic and environmental consequences, that cigarette buds have. Thereafter we specified which theoretical approach we would take to analyze the behavioral patterns of smokers, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> the smoker’s problem with throwing away buds was a psychological one. Then we went through the most viable solutions, and how they could potentially reduce or in turn totally eliminate the problem. Thereafter we take an in depth look on the design process of our product, which we in turn evaluate according to our criteria. We summed it all up, by discussing how and why certain solutions work, and finish with a conclusion of what we believe is the most theoretically smart solution...|$|R
