25|$|Twelve jurors decide <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>qualified</b> <b>majority</b> of two-thirds {{whether the}} {{defendant}} is guilty or not. A tied vote results in 'not guilty'; a '7 guilty - 5 not guilty' vote is transferred to the 3 professional judges who can, by unanimity, reverse the majority to 'not guilty'. The sentence is delivered {{by a majority of}} the 12 jurors and the 3 professional judges. As a result of the Taxquet ruling the juries give nowadays the most important motives that lead them to their verdict. The procedural codification has been altered to meet the demands formulated by the European Court of Human Rights.|$|E
25|$|In {{accordance}} with Article 138 of the Constitution, a referendum was called after the formal request {{of more than}} one fifth of the members of both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, since the constitutional law had not been approved <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>qualified</b> <b>majority</b> of two-thirds in each house of parliament in the second vote. 59.11% of voters voted against the constitutional reform, meaning it did not come into effect.

40|$|There has {{recently}} been renewed focus on the role that collective action clauses (CACs) could play in facilitating the resolution of sovereign debt problems. The most important such clause is the majority restructuring clause, <b>by</b> which <b>a</b> <b>qualified</b> <b>majority</b> of bondholders can vote to alter the payment terms of the bond and make these changes binding even for dissenting bondholders. In this note, we investigate the actual contractual terms of a large sample of bonds issued into the Euromarket by emerging market sovereigns. We identify around $ 12 billion of issuance over 1997 - 2002 with New York governing law but which departed from US market convention and included CACs (which are common in bonds with English governing law). In each case the legal adviser was the London office of a US law firm, helping produce this unusual combination of English and American legal practice. It appears that this departure from convention was in some sense inadvertent. The existence of this group of bonds appears to have escaped the notice of all those— in academia, the official sector and the private sector—in the debate over sovereig...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the impact of}} the Constitutional Court on legislative output in Italy. Following Tsebelis’ ((2002) Veto Players: Foundations of Institutional Analysis. Princeton: Princeton University Press) veto players model and the stylised facts as regards the Italian Constitutional Court’s activity, this paper presents a multi-stage game in the spirit of Gely and Spiller ((1990). A rational choice theory of supreme court statutory decisions with applications to the state farm and grove city cases. Journal of Law, Economics, and Organization 6, 263 – 300). In the first stage, the legislative veto players, namely the parties in government, choose whether to change or not the policy status quo by enacting new legislation. In the second stage, the Court makes a constitutional interpretation: it decides whether to alter or not the outcome of the first stage through a sentence of constitutional illegitimacy. The Court has both the power of annulling laws and a limited power of creating new legally binding norms. Moreover, in the third stage, a constitutional law voted <b>by</b> <b>a</b> parliamentary <b>qualified</b> <b>majority</b> can overturn the Court’s decisions. The model predicts that the presence of the Court lowers legislative policy change and tests this prediction with 1956 – 2001 annual time series data for Italy.

40|$|The Law on Fiscal Responsibility adopted late 2008 {{is a new}} {{element in}} Hungarian fiscal policy, {{although}} not without precedent. Under the law, the Parliament and the Government limit themselves to prevent high fiscal deficits and a further increase in public indebtedness, experienced in recent years. Budget planning turns into a three-year process, hardening over time. As a first step, the targeted primary (non-interest) budget balance {{is subject to the}} requirement that the stock of government debt cannot rise in real terms. However, ex post, the law allows for deviations in fiscal performance-including those reflecting the effect of so-called automatic stabilizers-attributable to factors beyond the control of the authorities. This means that the actual deficit is not necessarily equal to the deficit path consistent with the real debt limit, but it may fluctuate around this trend over the medium term. In addition, the law prescribes observance of the pay-go principle. Finally, it provides for the establishment of an independent Fiscal Council entrusted with monitoring compliance with the rules and with transparency standards. We evaluated the law according to the Kopits–Symansky criteria applied in the international literature. In most aspects, the law exhibits favourable properties, consistent with the criteria, although inevitably at the expense of simplicity. The assessment suggests that the law would benefit from extending coverage of the rules to local governments. Moreover, enforceability of the rules would be strengthened if the law were adopted <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>qualified</b> legislative <b>majority.</b> fiscal rules, budget planning, Fiscal Council. ...|$|R
25|$|Under this {{procedure}} the Council, acting either unanimously or <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>qualified</b> <b>majority</b> {{depending on the}} policy area concerned, can adopt legislation based on a proposal by the European Commission after consulting the European Parliament. While being required to consult Parliament on legislative proposals, the Council is not bound by Parliament's position. In practice the Council would frequently ignore whatever Parliament might suggest and even sometimes reach an agreement before receiving Parliament's opinion. However the European Court of Justice has ruled that the Council must wait for Parliament's opinion and the Court has struck down legislation that the Council adopted before Parliament gave its opinion. ECR 3333. Acting upon this Parliament occasionally filibusters legislation that it dislikes by delaying giving a formal opinion to obtain some leverage against proposals it dislikes, thus stalling the legislative process.|$|E
500|$|As such, the European Council {{had already}} existed before it gained the {{status as an}} {{institution}} of the European Union with the entering into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, but even after it had been mentioned in the treaties (since the Single European Act) it could only take political decisions, not formal legal acts. However, when necessary, the Heads of State or Government could also meet as the Council of Ministers and take formal decisions in that role. Sometimes, this would was even compulsory, e.g. Article 214(2) of the Treaty establishing the European Community provided (before it was amended by the Treaty of Lisbon) that ‘the Council, meeting {{in the composition of}} Heads of State or Government and acting <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>qualified</b> <b>majority,</b> shall nominate the person it intends to appoint as President of the Commission’ (emphasis added); the same rule applied in some monetary policy provisions introduced by the Maastricht Treaty (e.g. Article 109j TEC).

When the European Council, already introduced into the treaties by the Single European Act, became an institution by virtue of the Treaty of Lisbon, this was no longer necessary, and the [...] "Council [...] meeting in the composition of the Heads of State or Government", was replaced in these instances by the European Council now taking formal legally binding decisions in these cases (...)

Plantard only claimed that the Merovingians were descended from the Tribe of Benjamin, which contradicts the hypothesis of a Jesus bloodline as the missing link between the Merovingian line and the Davidic line from the Tribe of Judah. The notion of a direct bloodline from Jesus and Mary Magdalene, and its supposed relationship to the Merovingians (as well as their alleged modern descendants: House of Habsburg, Grand Ducal Family of Luxembourg, Clan Sinclair, House of Stuart, House of Cavendish, House of Bourbon, House of Orléans and other noble families), is strongly dismissed as pseudohistorical <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>qualified</b> <b>majority</b> of Christian and secular historians such as Darrell Bock and Bart D.
