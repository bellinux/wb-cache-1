40|$|We {{studied the}} {{physiological}} response to limitation by diverse nutrients in batch and steady-state (chemostat) cultures of S. cerevisiae. We {{found that the}} global pattern of transcription in steady-state cultures in limiting phosphate or sulfate is essentially identical to that of <b>batch</b> <b>cultures</b> growing in the same medium just before the limiting nutrient is completely exhausted. The massive stress response and complete arrest of the cell cycle that occurs when nutrients are fully exhausted in <b>batch</b> <b>cultures</b> is not observed in the chemostat, indicating that the cells in the chemostat are "poor, not starving. " Similar comparisons using leucine or uracil auxotrophs limited on leucine or uracil again showed patterns of gene expression in steady-state closely resembling those of corresponding <b>batch</b> <b>cultures</b> just before they exhaust the nutrient. Although {{there is also a}} strong stress response in the auxotrophic <b>batch</b> <b>cultures,</b> cell cycle arrest, if it occurs at all, is much less uniform. Many of the differences among the patterns of gene expression between the four nutrient limitations are interpretable in light of known involvement of the genes in stress responses or in the regulation or execution of particular metabolic pathways appropriate to the limiting nutrient. We conclude that cells adjust their growth rate to nutrient availability and maintain homeostasis in the same way in batch and steady state conditions; cells in steady-state cultures are in a physiological condition normally encountered in <b>batch</b> <b>cultures...</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Batch</b> <b>culture</b> is {{the most}} common {{laboratory}} growth method in which bacterial growth is studied, but it is only one of many. It is ideally spatially unstructured and temporally structured. The bacterial culture is incubated in a closed vessel with a single batch of medium. In some experimental regimes, some of the bacterial culture is periodically removed and added to fresh sterile medium. In the extreme case, this leads to the continual renewal of the nutrients. This is a chemostat, also known as continuous culture. It is ideally spatially unstructured and temporally unstructured, in a steady state defined by the rates of nutrient supply and bacterial growth. In comparison to <b>batch</b> <b>culture,</b> bacteria are maintained in exponential growth phase, and the growth rate of the bacteria is known. Related devices include turbidostats and auxostats.|$|E
50|$|In a <b>batch</b> <b>culture,</b> {{to achieve}} very high cell {{concentrations}}, e.g. 50-100 g of dry cells/L, high initial concentrations of the nutrients {{in the medium}} are needed.

5000|$|This basic <b>batch</b> <b>culture</b> growth model draws out and {{emphasizes}} {{aspects of}} bacterial growth which {{may differ from}} the growth of macrofauna. It emphasizes clonality, asexual binary division, the short development time relative to replication itself, the seemingly low death rate, the need to move from a dormant state to a reproductive state or to condition the media, and finally, the tendency of lab adapted strains to exhaust their nutrients. In reality, even in <b>batch</b> <b>culture,</b> the four phases are not well defined. The cells do not reproduce in synchrony without explicit and continual prompting (as in experiments with stalked bacteria [...] ) and their exponential phase growth is often not ever a constant rate, but instead a slowly decaying rate, a constant stochastic response to pressures both to reproduce and to go dormant {{in the face of}} declining nutrient concentrations and increasing waste concentrations.|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of lipids by oleaginous yeast and fungi {{becomes more important}} because these lipids {{can be used for}} biodiesel production. To understand the process of lipid production better, we developed a model for growth, lipid production and lipid turnover in submerged batch fermentation. This model describes three subsequent phases: exponential growth when both a C-source and an N-source are available, carbohydrate and lipid production when the N-source is exhausted and turnover of accumulated lipids when the C-source is exhausted. The model was validated with submerged <b>batch</b> <b>cultures</b> of the fungus Umbelopsis isabellina (formerly known as Mortierella isabellina) with two different initial C/N-ratios. Comparison with chemostat cultures with the same strain showed a significant difference in lipid production: in <b>batch</b> <b>cultures,</b> the initial specific lipid production rate was almost four times higher than in chemostat cultures but it decreased exponentially in time, while the maximum specific lipid production rate in chemostat cultures was independent of residence time. This indicates that different mechanisms for lipid production are active in <b>batch</b> and chemostat <b>cultures.</b> The model could also describe data for submerged <b>batch</b> <b>cultures</b> from literature well...|$|R

5000|$|In the {{bacteria}} Escherichia coli, a Prisoner Dilemma situation {{can be observed}} when mutants exhibiting a Grow Advantage in Stationary Phase (GASP) phenotype [...] compete with a wild type (WT) strain in <b>batch</b> <b>culture.</b> In such <b>batch</b> <b>culture</b> settings, where the growth environment is homogenized by shaking the cultures, WT cells cooperate by arresting bacterial growth {{in order to prevent}} ecological collapse while the GASP mutants continue to grow by defecting to the wild type regulatory mechanism. As a consequence of such defection to the self-regulation of growth by the GASP cells, although higher cell densities are achieved in the short term, a population collapse is attained in the long run due to the tragedy of the commons (Figure 1). On the contrary, although WT cells do not achieve such high population densities, their populations are sustainable at the same density in the long term.As predicted by theory, in a spatial setting such as those implemented experimentally by microfluidics chips, coexistence between the two strains is possible due to the localization of interactions and the spatial segregation of cheaters. When provided with such a spatial environment, bacteria can self-organize into dynamic patterns of cell aggregation, desegregation which ensure that cooperator WT cells can reap the benefits of cooperation (Figure 2).|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{physiological}} response to glucose limitation in batch and steady-state (chemostat) cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae by following global patterns of gene expression. Glucose-limited <b>batch</b> <b>cultures</b> of yeast go through two sequential exponential growth phases, {{beginning with a}} largely fermentative phase, followed by an essentially completely aerobic use of residual glucose and evolved ethanol. Judging from the patterns of gene expression, {{the state of the}} cells growing at steady state in glucose-limited chemostats corresponds most closely with the state of cells in <b>batch</b> <b>cultures</b> just before they undergo this "diauxic shift. " Essentially the same pattern was found between chemostats having a fivefold difference in steady-state growth rate (the lower rate approximating that of the second phase respiratory growth rate in <b>batch</b> <b>cultures).</b> Although in both cases the cells in the chemostat consumed most of the glucose, in neither case did they seem to be metabolizing it primarily through respiration. Although there was some indication of a modest oxidative stress response, the chemostat cultures did not exhibit the massive environmental stress response associated with starvation that also is observed, at least in part, during the diauxic shift in <b>batch</b> <b>cultures.</b> We conclude that despite the theoretical possibility of a switch to fully aerobic metabolism of glucose in the chemostat under conditions of glucose scarcity, homeostatic mechanisms are able to carry out metabolic adjustment as if fermentation of the glucose is the preferred option until the glucose is entirely depleted. These results suggest that some aspect of actual starvation, possibly a component of the stress response, may be required for triggering the metabolic remodeling associated with the diauxic shift...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the impact of physiological growth states (batch exponential and batch stationary growth) and growth modes (substrate-limited chemostat, substrate-sufficient exponential batch, and substrate-depleted stationary batch growth) on several measures of growth and responses to Cd(II) -mediated inhibition of Nitrosomonas europaea strain 19718. The specific oxygen uptake rate (sOUR) was the most sensitive indicator of inhibition among the different responses analyzed, including total cell abundance, membrane integrity, intracellular 16 S rRNA/DNA ratio, and amoA expression. This observation remained true irrespective of the physiological state, the growth mode, or the mode of Cd(II) exposure. Based on the sOUR, a strong time-dependent exacerbation of inhibition (in terms of an inhibition coefficient [Ki]) in exponential <b>batch</b> <b>cultures</b> was observed. Long-term inhibition levels (based on Ki estimates) in metabolically active chemostat and exponential <b>batch</b> <b>cultures</b> were also especially severe and comparable. In contrast, the inhibition level in stationary-phase cultures was 10 -fold lower and invariable with exposure time. Different strategies for surviving substrate limitation (a 10 -fold increase in amoA expression) and starvation (the retention of 16 S rRNA levels) in N. europaea cultures were observed. amoA expression was most negatively impacted by Cd(II) exposure in the chemostat cultures, was less impacted in exponential <b>batch</b> <b>cultures,</b> and was least impacted in stationary <b>batch</b> <b>cultures.</b> Although the amoA response was consistent with that of the sOUR, the amoA response was not as strong. The intracellular 16 S rRNA/DNA ratio, as determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization, also did not uniformly correlate with the sOUR under conditions of inhibition or no inhibition. Finally, Cd(II) -mediated inhibition of N. europaea was attributed partially to oxidative stress...|$|R

50|$|Most commonly, the {{presence}} of a phycotoxin is verified by bioassay-guided fractionation. The sample must be fractionated, or separated from the other metabolites and chemicals in the media using chromatography. These different fractions may be then tested on the target species to determine which sample causes the expected allelopathic symptom(s). This approach is useful for rapidly isolating an allelochemical whose structure is not known. However, bioassays have the potential to generate false positives. This may occur if the bioassay is not controlled properly. For example, in a mixed <b>batch</b> <b>culture</b> the target species may die or have reduced growth rates due to competition for nutrients, dissolved inorganic carbon, or pH levels which are too low for the target species.|$|E
5000|$|Diauxie is a Greek word {{coined by}} Jacques Monod to mean two growth phases. The word {{is used in}} English in cell biology to {{describe}} the growth phases of a microorganism in <b>batch</b> <b>culture</b> as it metabolizes a mixture of two sugars. Rather than metabolizing the two available sugars simultaneously, microbial cells commonly consume them in a sequential pattern, resulting in two separate growth phases. [...] During the first phase, cells preferentially metabolize the sugar on which it can grow faster (often glucose but not always). Only after the first sugar has been exhausted do the cells switch to the second. At {{the time of the}} [...] "diauxic shift", there is often a lag period during which cells produce the enzymes needed to metabolize the second sugar.|$|E

5000|$|Bacterial {{growth is}} the asexual reproduction, or cell division, of a {{bacterium}} into two daughter cells, {{in a process}} called binary fission.

Both daughter cells from the division do not necessarily survive. However, if the number surviving exceeds unity on average, the bacterial population undergoes exponential growth. The measurement of an exponential bacterial growth curve in <b>batch</b> <b>culture</b> was traditionally a part of the training of all microbiologists; the basic means requires bacterial enumeration (cell counting) by direct and individual (microscopic, flow cytometry), direct and bulk (biomass), indirect and individual (colony counting), or indirect and bulk (most probable number, turbidity, nutrient uptake) methods.

50|$|In {{the case}} of the baker's or brewer's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae growing on glucose with plenty of aeration, the diauxic growth pattern is {{commonly}} observed in <b>batch</b> <b>culture.</b> During the first growth phase, when there is plenty of glucose and oxygen available, the yeast cells prefer glucose fermentation to aerobic respiration even though aerobic respiration is the more efficient pathway to grow on glucose. Contrary to the more commonly invoked Pasteur effect, this phenomenon of preferring the faster growth supporting fermentation is closer to the Warburg effect observed in faster growing tumors. The intracellular genetic regulatory mechanisms have evolved to enforce this choice, as fermentation provides a faster growth rate for the yeast cells than the aerobic respiration of glucose. After glucose is depleted, the fermentative product ethanol is oxidised in a noticeably slower second growth phase, if oxygen is available.|$|E
50|$|In a {{microbial}} process employing an {{auxotrophic mutant}} (nutritionally requiring mutant), excess {{supply of the}} required nutrient results in abundant cell growth with little accumulation of the desired metabolite due to feedback inhibition and /or end-product repression. Starvation of the required nutrient, however, lowers cell growth {{as well as the}} overall production of the desired metabolite, as the production rate is usually proportional to the cell concentration. In such a bioprocess, the accumulation of the desired metabolite can be maximized by growing the mutant on a limited amount of the required nutrient. To cultivate the mutant on a low concentration of the required nutrient, it is fed to the <b>batch</b> <b>culture</b> at a controlled rate. This technique is often used in industrial amino acid productions with the auxotrophic mutants.
