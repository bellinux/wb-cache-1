25|$|A brain or {{cerebral}} abscess, {{like other}} abscesses, {{is caused by}} inflammation and collection of lymphatic cells and infected material originating from a local or remote infection. A <b>brain</b> <b>abscess</b> is a rare, life-threatening condition. Local sources may include infections of the ear, the oral cavity and teeth, the paranasal sinuses, or an epidural abscess. Remote sources may include infections in the lung, heart or kidney. A <b>brain</b> <b>abscess</b> may also be caused by head trauma or as a complication of surgery. In children cerebral abscesses are usually linked to congenital heart disease. In most cases, 8–12 weeks of antibacterial therapy is required.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction <b>Brain</b> <b>abscesses</b> {{arising from}} right-to-left cardiac {{shunting}} are very rare in adults. Case presentation We describe {{the case of}} a 47 -year-old non-hispanic white male with periodontal disease who developed several <b>brain</b> <b>abscesses</b> caused by Streptococcus intermedius. A comprehensive workup revealed a patent foramen ovale with oral flora as the only plausible explanation for the <b>brain</b> <b>abscesses.</b> Conclusion Based on this case and the relevant literature, we suggest an association between a silent patent foramen ovale, paradoxical microbial dissemination to the brain, and the development of <b>brain</b> <b>abscesses.</b> </p...|$|R

50|$|CNS infections can be {{isolated}} from subdural empyema and <b>brain</b> <b>abscesses</b> {{which are a}} result of chronic infections. Also isolated from sinuses, teeth and mastoid. 46% of 39 <b>brain</b> <b>abscesses</b> in one study showed anaerobic gram-positive cocci and microaerophilic streptococci.|$|R
25|$|Complications {{of acute}} otitis media {{consists}} of perforation of the ear drum, infection of the mastoid space behind the ear (mastoiditis), and more rarely intracranial complications can occur, such as bacterial meningitis, <b>brain</b> <b>abscess,</b> or dural sinus thrombosis. It is estimated that each year 21,000 people die due to complications of otitis media.|$|E
500|$|Vascular malformations in {{the lungs}} may cause a number of problems. The lungs {{normally}} [...] "filter out" [...] bacteria and blood clots from the bloodstream; AVMs bypass the capillary network of the lungs and allow these to migrate to the brain, where bacteria may cause a <b>brain</b> <b>abscess</b> and blood clots may lead to stroke. HHT {{is the most common}} cause of lung AVMs: out of all people found to have lung AVMs, 70–80% are due to HHT. Bleeding from lung AVMs is relatively unusual, but may cause hemoptysis (coughing up blood) or hemothorax (blood accumulating in the chest cavity). Large vascular malformations in the lung allow oxygen-depleted blood from the right ventricle to bypass the alveoli, meaning that this blood does not have an opportunity to absorb fresh oxygen. This may lead to breathlessness. Large AVMs may lead to platypnea, difficulty in breathing that is more marked when sitting up compared to lying down; this probably reflects changes in blood flow associated with positioning. Very large AVMs cause a marked inability to absorb oxygen, which may be noted by cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the lips and skin), clubbing of the fingernails (often encountered in chronically low oxygen levels), and a humming noise over the affected part of the lung detectable by stethoscope.|$|E

40|$|<b>Brain</b> <b>abscesses</b> {{caused by}} Nocardia are rare, {{but it is}} very {{important}} to detect and treat them early because the associated mortality is 3 times higher than that associated with other bacterial <b>brain</b> <b>abscesses.</b> This infection is prevalent among adults on long-term immunosuppressive therapy; we report the case of a male kidney transplant recipient aged 12. 7 years who developed early multiple Nocardia -induced <b>brain</b> <b>abscesses</b> that were successfully treated with linezolid, a novel antibiotic therapy...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: MR imaging {{features}} are nonspecific {{with respect to}} the causative organism for patients with <b>brain</b> <b>abscesses.</b> On the basis of the hypothesis that the biochemical environment depends on the infecting organism and might be different in tuber-culous compared with pyogenic <b>brain</b> <b>abscesses,</b> this study attempted to determine whether pyogenic <b>brain</b> <b>abscesses</b> can be differentiated from tuberculous <b>brain</b> <b>abscesses</b> by use of magnetization transfer (MT) MR imaging and in vivo proton MR spectroscopy. METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with a total of 33 pyogenic <b>brain</b> <b>abscesses</b> and three patients with a total of 12 tuberculous abscesses were evaluated with in vivo MR spectroscopy and MT MR imaging. The diagnosis in all cases was based on the culture of the causative organisms and histopathology whenever done as a part of clinical management. RESULTS: All 27 patients with pyogenic <b>brain</b> <b>abscesses</b> had lipid and lactate levels of 1. 3 ppm and amino acid levels of 0. 9 ppm with or without the presence of succinate, acetate, alanine, and glycine, while the three patients with tuberculous abscesses showed only such lipid and lactate levels.

2500|$|Kerzin {{was born}} in Hollywood, California on November 1, 1947. [...] When he was young he read a book by D.T. Suzuki's World of Zen, which sparked an {{interest}} in Buddhism. [...] Starting at around six, he was plagued by questions of {{who he was and}} why he was here; they led him to join a philosophy club in high school and to switch to studying philosophy in college; he had started as a pre-med student. [...] He had wanted to become a doctor and did choose to continue on to medical school, because at the age of eleven he had a <b>brain</b> <b>abscess</b> that caused him to have seizures and fall into comas; it was eventually treated by a neurosurgeon with four brain surgeries over several years; the experience inspired him to become a doctor so that he could help other people.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{demonstrate}} {{the presence of}} a multilayer appearance of the capsule on contrast-enhanced (CE) susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) in patients with pyogenic <b>brain</b> <b>abscesses.</b> Possible origins for the appearance and effects of postprocessing settings are discussed. Materials and Methods: Fourteen patients with pyogenic <b>brain</b> <b>abscesses</b> underwent post gadolinium-enhanced SWI at 1. 5 T. All SWI images were postprocessed with various filter and mask settings to compare the image appearance. Computer simulations using a paramagnetic spherical shell model were performed to verify the clinical findings. Results: Pyogenic <b>brain</b> <b>abscesses</b> demonstrated a multilayer appearance with a darkened ring within the enhanced capsule on CE-SWI in all patients. The multilayer appearance was slice-orientation-dependent, decreased with larger widths of the high-pass filter, and increased with larger numbers of phase mask multiplication operations, consistently on both simulation results and the clinical images. Conclusion: CE-SWI shows the multilayer appearance of the capsule in pyogenic <b>brain</b> <b>abscesses,</b> which may arise from postprocessing procedures originally designed to enhance susceptibility contrast. Although SWI may provide additional information valuable in the diagnosis of pyogenic <b>brain</b> <b>abscesses,</b> image interpretation should be exercised with caution, particularly for CE-SWI. © 2012 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) and proton {{magnetic resonance spectroscopy}} (MRS) were evaluated for differentiating metastatic brain tumors, radiation necroses, and <b>brain</b> <b>abscesses.</b> Twelve histologically verified lesions in 12 patients were studied using preoperative MRI and proton MRS. The signal intensities of four major metabolites, N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), choline-containing compounds (Cho), creatine and phosphocreatine (Cr), and lactate (Lac), were observed over the region of interest. Metastatic brain tumors showed a decrease in NAA/Cr {{and an increase in}} Cho/Cr ratios. Radiation necroses showed a decrease in NAA/Cr and no change in Cho/Cr ratios. <b>Brain</b> <b>abscesses</b> showed an increase in Lac/Cr ratio. Correlation with histopathologic findings showed that a high Cho signal was suggestive of a metastatic brain tumor. Lac signals were observed in <b>brain</b> <b>abscesses,</b> presumably reflecting the anerobic glycolysis of living cells.
