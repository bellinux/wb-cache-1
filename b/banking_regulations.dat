Andreas Dombret of the Executive Board of Deutsche Bundesbank has noted a difficulty in identifying institutions that constitute systemic importance via their size, complexity, {{and degree of}} interconnectivity within the global financial system, and that efforts {{should be made to}} identify a group of 25 to 30 indisputable globally systemic institutions. He has suggested they be held to standards higher than those mandated by Basel III, and that despite the inevitability of institutional failures, such failures should not drag with them the financial systems in which they participate. Dombret has advocated for regulatory reform that extends beyond <b>banking</b> <b>regulations</b> and has argued in favor of greater transparency through increased public disclosure and increased regulation of the shadow banking system.|$|E
5|$|The Council on Foreign Relations' {{assessment}} of global finance notes that excessive institutions with overlapping directives and limited scopes of authority, coupled with difficulty aligning national interests with international reforms, {{are the two}} key weaknesses inhibiting global financial reform. Nations do not presently enjoy a comprehensive structure for macroeconomic policy coordination, and global savings imbalances have abounded {{before and after the}} global financial crisis {{to the extent that the}} United States' status as the steward of the world's reserve currency was called into question. Post-crisis efforts to pursue macroeconomic policies aimed at stabilizing foreign exchange markets have yet to be institutionalized. The lack of international consensus on how best to monitor and govern banking and investment activity threatens the world's ability to prevent future global financial crises. The slow and often delayed implementation of <b>banking</b> <b>regulations</b> that meet Basel III criteria means most of the standards will not take effect until 2019, rendering continued exposure of global finance to unregulated systemic risks. Despite Basel III and other efforts by the G20 to bolster the Financial Stability Board's capacity to facilitate cooperation and stabilizing regulatory changes, regulation exists predominantly at the national and regional levels.|$|E
40|$|The End-product {{represents}} the article {{which is to}} be published in one of the academic journals on legal problems. The title of the article is «The Role of <b>Banking</b> <b>Regulation</b> in the Development of Market Economy in Russia (Legal Aspects) ». The article consists of introduction, three chapters, conclusion and bibliography. Three chapters focus consistently on theoretical, European and Russian aspects of prudential <b>banking</b> <b>regulation.</b> The first chapter «Theoretical Aspects of <b>Banking</b> <b>Regulation</b> » examines the role, main objectives and functions of prudential <b>banking</b> <b>regulation</b> in market economy based on free competition. <b>Banking</b> <b>regulation</b> is designed to play a risk-minimizing role in the banking sector of market economy. The objectives of prudential <b>banking</b> <b>regulation</b> are to guarantee the safety and soundness of the banking system as a whole and to protect depositors as consumers of banking services. The objectives of <b>banking</b> <b>regulation</b> determine its functions which can be identified as preventive, protective and supportive. The second chapter «European Aspects of <b>Banking</b> <b>Regulation</b> » analyzes the mechanism of European convergence in <b>banking</b> <b>regulation.</b> Unlike the international convergence on universal level, European convergence in prudential <b>banking</b> <b>regulation</b> was achieved through legal structures (the European Union bodies: the EC Council and the EC Commission) by means of legal instruments binding upon the EC Member States (directives). The whole process of European convergence was not a collapse, but policy-driven, taking into consideration the aim of completion of the single internal market in the EC including the single market of banking services. The third chapter «Russian Aspects of <b>Banking</b> <b>Regulation</b> » scrutinizes the legal status of the bank of England and the Bank of Russia with special emphasis on their independence from other bodies of government, their objectives and functions as the central banks in national banking systems. In this chapter the main trend of convergence existing in European and Russian <b>banking</b> <b>regulation</b> is especially underlined. As follows from a comparative analysis, the convergence of European and Russian approaches is being achieved in relation either to capital adequacy standards, or to consolidated supervision as the key elements of prudential <b>banking</b> <b>regulation.</b> The main conclusion which must be drawn from the research carried out is that the convergence process i...|$|R

5|$|Countries {{sought to}} improve the {{sustainability}} and transparency of the global financial system in response to crises in the 1980s and 1990s. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision was formed in 1974 by the G-10 members' central bank governors to facilitate cooperation on the supervision and regulation of banking practices. It is headquartered at the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland. The committee has held several rounds of deliberation known collectively as the Basel Accords. The first of these accords, known as Basel I, took place in 1988 and emphasized credit risk and the assessment of different asset classes. Basel I was motivated by concerns over whether large multinational banks were appropriately regulated, stemming from observations during the 1980s Latin American debt crisis. Following Basel I, the committee published recommendations on new capital requirements for banks, which the G-10 nations implemented four years later. In 1999, the G-10 established the Financial Stability Forum (reconstituted by the G-20 in 2009 as the Financial Stability Board) to facilitate cooperation among regulatory agencies and promote stability in the global financial system. The Forum was charged with developing and codifying twelve international standards and implementation thereof. The Basel II accord was set in 2004 and again emphasized capital requirements as a safeguard against systemic risk {{as well as the}} need for global consistency in <b>banking</b> <b>regulations</b> so as not to competitively disadvantage banks operating internationally. It was motivated by what were seen as inadequacies of the first accord such as insufficient public disclosure of banks' risk profiles and oversight by regulatory bodies. Members were slow to implement it, with major efforts by the European Union and United States taking place as late as 2007 and 2008. In 2010, the Basel Committee revised the capital requirements in a set of enhancements to Basel II known as Basel III, which centered on a leverage ratio requirement aimed at restricting excessive leveraging by banks. In addition to strengthening the ratio, Basel III modified the formulas used to weight risk and compute the capital thresholds necessary to mitigate the risks of bank holdings, concluding the capital threshold should be set at 7% of the value of a bank's risk-weighted assets.|$|E

40|$|Since the {{outbreak}} of the financial crisis, the macro-prudential policy paradigm has gained increasing prominence (Bank of England, 2009; Bernanke, 2011). The dynamics of this shift in the economic discourse, and the reasons this shift has not taken place prior to the crisis have not been addressed systemically. This paper investigates the evolution of the economic discourse on systemic risk and <b>banking</b> <b>regulation</b> to better understand these changes and their timing. Further, we use our sample to inquire whether, and if so, why the economic regulatory studies failed to recommend a reliable <b>banking</b> <b>regulation</b> prior to the crisis. By following a discourse analysis, we establish that the economic discourse on <b>banking</b> <b>regulation</b> has not been suitable for providing the knowledge basis required for a dynamically reliable <b>banking</b> <b>regulation,</b> and we identify the underlying reasons for such failure. These reasons include the obsession of economic discourse with optimization and particular forms of formalism, particularly, partial equilibrium analysis. Further, the economic discourse on <b>banking</b> <b>regulation</b> excludes historical and practitioners' discourses and ignores weak signals. We point out that post-crisis, these epistemological failures of the economic discourse on <b>banking</b> <b>regulation</b> were not sufficiently recognized and that recent attempts to conceptualize systemic risk as a negative externality and to thus price it point to the persistence of formalism, equilibrium thinking and optimization, with their attending dangers...|$|R

2500|$|Throughout {{the early}} 1900s <b>banking</b> <b>regulations</b> were {{extremely}} lax if not non-existent.

2500|$|According to <b>banking</b> <b>regulations,</b> {{the bank}} could lend {{not more than}} 10 times its capital. Therefore, as lending {{increased}} every year, new shares had to be issued almost annually. Up to 1902, the bank issued 33,700 additional shares (nominal value 250 rubles). The shares were first offered to existing shareholders who often bought majority of the new shares using their annual dividends. In 1896, Vilnius Land Bank had third largest capital among land banks after Moscow and Kharkiv banks. In 1898, Vilnius Land Bank had a profit of 1.6 million rubles, second largest after Moscow Land Bank (1.9 million). In 1912–1914, Vilnius Land Bank was the second largest, after the Bank Handlowy w Warszawie, among Polish banks in terms of capital. The annual dividend grew from 4.35% in 1873, 8% in 1874, and 14.0–14.9% in 1878–1885, to 16% in 1896–1900. The dividends dipped to 13.12% in 1904. The bank took great care to keep the dividend high and consistent, cutting bonuses for board members and even reducing bank's capital in a bad year. The capital grew to 10.6 million rubles in 1913–1914. This capital was used to provide short-term loans and any excess was required to be invested in Russian government bonds.|$|E
2500|$|Diana Oughton left Dwight {{at the age}} of 14 {{to finish}} her high school {{education}} at the Madeira School in McLean, Virginia. Madeira provided a conservative education. In her senior year at Madeira, she was accepted by all of the Seven Sisters colleges. Oughton graduated high school in 1959, entering Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania as a German-language major. Oughton supported her Republican family's political values by opposing federal <b>banking</b> <b>regulations,</b> social security, and anything associated with big government. When she was 19, Oughton went to West Germany, under a program sponsored by Wayne State University of Detroit, to spend her junior year of college at the University of Munich. She rented a room from the former rector of the university, Gerhard Weber. Oughton became close friends with some of the German students. One such student was Peter, with whom she had conversations late into the night. In the family-authorized biography, Diana: The Making of a Terrorist, author Thomas Powers noted Diana's recollection of a conversation with Peter that resonated with her: [...] "He said...Hurrah for Socialism!" [...] After her study abroad, Oughton returned to Bryn Mawr for her senior year. It was during this year that it became apparent to her that America's young people had grown up in the silent fifties as observers and listeners. In the early sixties, young people saw that what they had been taught to believe had fallen short. During this time, Oughton and many other students read and were influenced by the book Black Like Me. The author, John Howard Griffin, gave an account of what he encountered going to the Southern United States, disguised as an African American. The book {{had a profound effect on}} Oughton, prompting her to volunteer in 1962 to tutor African American children in an impoverished section of Philadelphia. Once, Oughton told her sister Carol how amazed she was that there were seventh graders she was tutoring who couldn't read.|$|E
