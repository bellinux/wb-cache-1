500|$|The {{gameplay}} did {{not escape}} criticism, however, with Tom Chick of IGN criticising {{the layout of}} the levels: [...] "The levels can <b>be</b> <b>awfully</b> linear, throwing you up against some frustrating brick walls where you don't know where to go or what you're supposed to do next. There are some bald key hunts." [...] The artificial intelligence of hostile NPCs received mixed reactions. GameSpot's Ron Dulin praised the AI, saying that they help the suspension of disbelief. Chi Kong Lui of Gamecritics.com, however, gave the opposite view: [...] "Enemy artificial intelligence is still pretty mindless and blasting them doesn't require much skill." ...|$|E
500|$|Attracted by its dress, secrecy, and ritual, Wilde {{petitioned the}} Apollo Masonic Lodge at Oxford, {{and was soon}} raised to the [...] "Sublime Degree of Master Mason". During a resurgent {{interest}} in Freemasonry in his third year, he commented he [...] "would <b>be</b> <b>awfully</b> sorry {{to give it up}} if I secede from the Protestant Heresy". Wilde's active involvement in Freemasonry lasted only for the time he spent at Oxford and his membership of the Apollo University Lodge lapsed after non-payment of subscriptions. He was deeply considering converting to Catholicism, discussing the possibility with clergy several times. In 1877, Wilde was left speechless after an audience with Pope PiusIX in Rome. He eagerly read Cardinal Newman's books, and became more serious in 1878, when he met the Reverend Sebastian Bowden, a priest in the Brompton Oratory who had received some high-profile converts. Neither his father, who threatened to cut off his funds, nor Mahaffy thought much of the plan; but mostly Wilde, the supreme individualist, balked at the last minute from pledging himself to any formal creed. On the appointed day of his baptism, Father Bowden received a bunch of altar lilies instead. Wilde retained a lifelong interest in Catholic theology and liturgy.|$|E
500|$|As well {{as being}} tragic, Dot is scripted as a comic character. Brown has {{discussed}} the humour she incorporates into her performances: [...] "I think Dot would <b>be</b> <b>awfully</b> boring if she weren't a bit comic [...] I always thought I had to put an edge on it, an edge of comedy, which just means doing it more seriously than you would do. If {{you want to play}} comedy then {{you have to be very}} intense about it [...] very, very serious." [...] Some of Dot's catchphrases are used for humour, such as [...] "Ooh I say!", uttered when she is [...] "stuck for words". In 2004, Brown discussed the origin of the saying: [...] "It was written once in the script and I quite enjoyed it, so I used to say it occasionally when it wasn't in the scripts. It was useful because it could be said in all different ways. Dot's very straight-laced, so it helped to express her horror at what went on." [...] Brown revealed in 2008 that she has tried to cut down the use of this, along with the mispronunciation of her employer, Mr Papadopolous, as she has become a little embarrassed by them now they are so known. Mr. Papadopolous is the owner of the launderette where Dot works. In a long-running joke, Dot has difficulty pronouncing his surname, and for much of the show's history he has been referred to as Mr. Oppodopolus, Oppydoppy, or varying other mispronunciations. Brown has said she enjoys playing the comical aspects of Dot, stating, [...] "She's not dreadfully funny but she's amusing and I like that because it lightens it up a bit." ...|$|E

2500|$|Just as Harris {{appeared}} {{poised to}} join the first ranks of Broadway stars, she stopped appearing on stage after The Apple Tree, except for the off-Broadway first American production of Brecht and Weill's Mahagonny in 1970, in which she {{played the role of}} Jenny, originally created by Lotte Lenya. In the 2002 interview, Harris said, [...] "Who wants to be up on the stage all the time? It isn't easy. You have to <b>be</b> <b>awfully</b> invested in the fame aspect, and I really never was. What I cared about was the discipline of acting, whether I did well or not." ...|$|E
2500|$|How much of Stein's wartime {{activities}} {{were motivated by}} the real exigencies of self-preservation in a dangerous environment can only be speculated upon. However, her loyalty to Pétain may have gone beyond expedience. She had been urged to leave France by American embassy officials, friends and family when that possibility still existed, but declined to do so. Accustomed {{to a life of}} entitlement since birth, Stein may have been convinced her wealth and notoriety would exempt her from what had befallen other European Jews. In an essay written for the Atlantic Monthly in November, 1940, Stein had written about her decision not to leave France: [...] "it would <b>be</b> <b>awfully</b> uncomfortable and I am fussy about my food." [...] Stein continued to praise Pétain after the war ended, this at a time when Pétain had been sentenced to death by a French court for treason.|$|E
