This 'dolphining' technique can result in high average speeds because the height lost can be minimised until particularly strong lift is encountered when circling would <b>be</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective.</b>|$|E
5|$|The WHO Model List of Essential Medicines (EML), {{published}} by the World Health Organization (WHO), contains the medications considered to <b>be</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> and safe to meet the most important needs in a health system. The list is frequently used by countries to help develop their own local lists of essential medicine. As of 2016, more than 155 countries have created national lists of essential medicines based on the World Health Organization's model list. This includes countries in both the developed and developing world.|$|E

5|$|To <b>be</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> at {{controlling}} a pest, {{a biological}} control agent requires a colonizing ability which allows it {{to keep pace with}} changes to the habitat in space and time. Control is greatest if the agent has temporal persistence, so that it can maintain its population even in the temporary absence of the target species, and if it is an opportunistic forager, enabling it to rapidly exploit a pest population.|$|E
5|$|By 1912, Sadler and his wife, both doctors by then, {{operated}} a joint practice in Chicago that catered to children's and women's health issues. Sadler initially focused on surgery, performing surgeries with his wife, but widened his practice to include psychiatric counseling in 1930 {{and became a}} consulting psychiatrist at Columbus Hospital. As a psychiatrist, Sadler advocated {{an eclectic mix of}} techniques, applying the theories of Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, Alfred Adler, and Adolf Meyer. Sadler believed that religious faith was beneficial to mental health, and specifically promoted prayer, which he believed to <b>be</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> in the context of Christian faith. However, he thought that religious beliefs were deleterious to mental health if based on fear.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the first attack took place, {{the walls of the}} fort still had not been finished, {{although}} they had been raised slightly. As a result of the hasty construction work, even at the wall's lowest part, it was high enough that the attacking force would need ladders to reach the top of the rampart. Every point where the fort was approachable, or thought weak by its defenders, was bolstered by stockades made out of stones and stakes that had been stuck into the ground. These were covered by cannons that were placed where they could <b>be</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective,</b> and a wicket gate that flanked {{a large part of the}} wall, was left open but cross-barred, to make it difficult for attacking soldiers to enter but also to channel their advance towards a cannon that had been placed at the gate to enfilade its approach with showers of grapeshot.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the tree}} of heaven's weedy habit, landowners and other organisations often resort to various methods of control {{in order to keep}} its populations in check. For example, the city of Basel in Switzerland has an {{eradication}} program for the tree. It can be very difficult to eradicate, however. Means of eradication can be physical, thermal, managerial, biological or chemical. A combination of several of these can <b>be</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective,</b> though they must of course be compatible. All have some positive and negative aspects, but the most effective regimen is generally a mixture of chemical and physical control. It involves the application of foliar or basal herbicides in order to kill existing trees, while either hand pulling or mowing seedlings in order to prevent new growth.|$|E
5|$|When {{the council}} {{objects to the}} Duke's {{increasing}} usurpation of power and abrogation of the constitution, Süß suggests to him that this challenge to his authority can be suppressed by dismissing the council and restructuring the government so that the Duke can reign as an absolute monarch. Süß tells the Duke that he can accomplish this by hiring mercenaries and that, {{as a sign of}} their gratitude, the Jews of Württemberg will provide all the requisite funds. Süß argues that he would <b>be</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> if the Duke were to give him a letter granting him immunity from the laws of Württemberg. The Duke demurs at first but ultimately grants Süß's request.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of August the Japanese had been bombing the troops of the 7th Brigade which had initially been sent to garrison the Milne Bay area, and as a Japanese invasion force was expected, the three battalions of the 18th Brigade were quickly placed into positions where they could <b>be</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective.</b> The 2/9th was assigned the task of defending Milne Force Headquarters at Hagita House and the Number 1 Strip (also known as Gurney Field). Upon arrival, the 2/9th Battalion was used to construct roads and lay steel matting on the airstrip as well as unloading stores from ships as they arrived, and carrying out patrolling operations. Following the Japanese landing on 25 August, the battalion was placed on alert and increased its patrolling operations around the airfield; however, for five days no contact was made. On 3 September, the battalion moved from Gili Gili to KB Mission and alongside the 2/12th Battalion, which had launched a counteroffensive along the north coast of the bay, went into battle with the Japanese for the first time. Over {{the course of the}} next two days the Japanese were beaten back and eventually a withdrawal was ordered by the Japanese commanders. This represented the first full-scale defeat of the Japanese on land during the war; it came at a cost for the 2/9th, though, with the battalion losing 29 men killed and a further 86 wounded in action, seven of whom later died of wounds. Disease took a far greater toll, with a further 308 men being hospitalised due to illness.|$|E

25|$|Some scholars, such as Haveman and Beresford, {{therefore}} {{argue that}} any policies {{aimed at reducing}} occupational inequality must focus on culture changes. According to Haveman and Beresford, people in the United States have historically tended to reject policies that only support one group (unless that group is them). Therefore, effective policies for limiting occupational segregation must aim to provide benefits across groups. Therefore, policies that aim at capping work hours for salaried workers or mandate on-site employer sponsored childcare might <b>be</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective.</b>|$|E
25|$|HPV {{vaccines}} {{can prevent}} {{the most common}} types of infection.

Cervical cancer screening, such as with the Papanicolaou test (pap) or looking at the cervix after using acetic acid, can detect early cancer or abnormal cells that may develop into cancer. This allows for early treatment which results in better outcomes. Screening has reduced both the number and deaths from cervical cancer in the developed world.|$|E

25|$|A different, and {{sometimes}} less time consuming {{option for the}} control of kudzu is chemical treatment with herbicides. Some common herbicides used are Tordon and Triclopyr and the most effective are Picloram and Tebuthiuron. However, chemical treatments are expensive, and killing off the plant completely requires large amounts of herbicides (40-80 gallons per acre). Herbicides are found to <b>be</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> when they are used during the typical growing season, June–October, and when used for successive years. One case study saw {{a significant decrease in}} the growth of kudzu after just two years, whereas another study required the use of the herbicide for up to ten years.|$|E
25|$|Combining a small culvert Fence with a Pond Leveler Pipe {{is another}} {{effective}} method to protect culverts from beaver damming. The culvert fence is made {{small enough to}} encourage the beavers to dam on it, but the resulting pond is prevented from rising to a dangerous level by a Pond Leveler Pipe installed through the culvert fence. The Fence and Pipe flow device needs very little maintenance and limits where and how high the beavers can dam; however, to <b>be</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective,</b> the intake end of the pipe should usually sit in at least 3 feet of water. When this water depth is not possible, a simple Culvert Protective Fence {{may be the best}} option.|$|E
25|$|Some {{treatment}} {{has been given}} to dogs with CCD to observe their reactions and how they are similar or different from how humans would react to the same pharmaceutical or behavioral treatment. A combination of the two approaches has been found to <b>be</b> <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> in lowering the intensity and regularity of OCD in both canines and humans. Pharmaceutically, clomipramine was found to be more effective than an alternative chemical, amitriptyline, in treatments for dogs. One study by Karen Overall discovered that by combining behavioral therapy with the more effective clomipramine, the symptoms of Canine Compulsive Disorder decreased by over 50% for all of the dogs involved in the study. Overall acknowledges that OCD is not something that can be completely cured, but studies like this are still important because Obsessive Compulsive Disorder can be controlled effectively enough so it does not interfere with one's life, a valuable and commonly sought after thing for those who suffer from the disorder.|$|E
