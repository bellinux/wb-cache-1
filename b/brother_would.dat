5|$|Sigismund Báthory abdicated at the Diet in Medgyes (Mediaș, Romania) on 21 March and {{proposed}} Andrew his successor. After Andrew pledged that {{neither he nor}} his <b>brother</b> <b>would</b> take vengeance on those who had voted against them in 1594, the Diet elected him prince on 28 March. However, as Alfonso Carillo noted, the most influential noblemen remained opposed to Andrew, even if they did not dare to raise an objection openly.|$|E
5|$|During her grandfather's reign, Elizabeth {{was third}} {{in the line of}} {{succession}} to the throne, behind her uncle Edward, Prince of Wales, and her father, the Duke of York. Although her birth generated public interest, she was not expected to become queen, as the Prince of Wales was still young. Many people believed that he would marry and have children of his own. When her grandfather died in 1936 and her uncle succeeded as Edward VIII, she became second-in-line to the throne, after her father. Later that year, Edward abdicated, after his proposed marriage to divorced socialite Wallis Simpson provoked a constitutional crisis. Consequently, Elizabeth's father became king, and she became heir presumptive. If her parents had had a later son, she would have lost her position as first-in-line, as her <b>brother</b> <b>would</b> have been heir apparent and above her in the line of succession.|$|E
5|$|When {{the emperor}} died without officially {{appointing}} a successor, his widow, the empress dowager, had the sole right to appoint {{one of the}} late emperor's surviving sons or relatives to the position. Most often the successor chosen in this fashion was a minor, thus the empress dowager served as regent over the government. A high-status male relative, usually a father or <b>brother,</b> <b>would</b> assume control of the Imperial Secretariat. Even when an emperor reached his majority and became an active ruler, he often sought the advice and acceptance of the empress dowager on policy decisions; she also {{had the right to}} override his decisions. The empress dowager was protected by the Minister of the Guards, yet if her faction—the consort clan— was removed from power, he was then responsible for keeping her under house arrest.|$|E
50|$|Sahiba, {{while keeping}} watch over her slumbering beloved, feared that her <b>{{brothers}}</b> <b>would</b> soon catch up. She {{did not know}} what to do. If her brothers came and Mirza woke up then her <b>brothers</b> <b>would</b> surely die at the hands of Mirza’s quick arrows.|$|R

5|$|With these resources, Henry {{erected a}} number of siege engines around the castle; one {{probable}} trebuchet and two mangonels were set up {{to the east of}} the castle; two mangonels were placed on the west side, to attack the keep, and one mangonel on both the north and south sides. Two siege-castles were established to observe the occupants of the castle. William was confident, however, that either his <b>brother</b> <b>would</b> return and relieve the siege, or that the pope would intervene, and held on despite the artillery attacks. The losses in the royal army began to mount; chronicler Ralph of Coggeshall suggests that seven knights, and over 200 soldiers and labourers were killed as the siege dragged on.|$|E
5|$|David Kaczynski {{had once}} admired and {{emulated}} his older brother, but had later {{decided to leave}} the survivalist lifestyle behind. He had received assurances from the FBI that he would remain anonymous and that his <b>brother</b> <b>would</b> not learn who had turned him in, but his identity was leaked to CBS News in early April 1996. CBS anchorman Dan Rather called FBI director Louis Freeh, who requested 24 hours before CBS broke the story on the evening news. The FBI scrambled to finish the search warrant and have it issued by a federal judge in Montana; afterwards, an internal leak investigation was conducted by the FBI, but the source of the leak was never identified. In 1996 the Evergreen Park Community High School was also placed on lockdown while FBI agents searched Kaczynski's school records. At the end of that school day, students were greeted by reporters asking how they felt about going to the same high school the Unabomber had attended. That night the news story was released to public.|$|E

25|$|Humayun's other brother, Kamran Mirza, marched {{from his}} territories in the Punjab, ostensibly to aid Humayun. However, his return home had treacherous motives as he {{intended}} to stake a claim for Humayun's apparently collapsing empire.

50|$|Stephen's grandfather, Henry Hassenfeld, was a Jewish {{immigrant}} from Poland who, {{with his brother}} Helal, founded a textile company that sold remnants called Hassenfeld <b>Brothers.</b> The <b>brothers</b> <b>would</b> move on to sell pencil boxes, school supplies, and later, toys.

25|$|As {{part of a}} {{peace treaty}} with Qin, King Qingxiang of Chu agreed to send his son, Crown Prince Wan, to Qin as a hostage, and Huang Xie stayed with the prince in Qin. After several years, Huang Xie {{received}} the news that King Qingxiang was ill. Afraid that the son of Lord Yangwen, King Qingxiang's <b>brother,</b> <b>would</b> seize the throne if Crown Prince Wan remained a hostage in Qin, Huang Xie secretly arranged the prince's escape back to Chu.|$|E
25|$|Cho {{was born}} into a very rich family of six children. His {{grandfather}} was a bank director. During the Korean War, the money the family had owned was burnt and they became impoverished. His father then sought the advice of a fortune teller. Originally called Pung-yeon, Cho's name was changed to Chihun, as the fortune teller told him to change his son's name to Chihun or else his mother would die, also saying that following the change, Chihun's younger <b>brother</b> <b>would</b> die but Chihun would become famous. Both predictions proved accurate.|$|E
25|$|Religion {{professor}} Tikva Frymer-Kensky {{has pointed}} out the economic implications of a Hebrew levirate marriage: the first child born to the brother's widow would be deemed the heir of the deceased brother, and able to claim the deceased brother's share of inheritance. If the deceased brother was the firstborn son, his inheritance was a double share. However, if the deceased brother were childless, the living <b>brother</b> <b>would</b> be entitled to inherit an increased share; or if he is the oldest surviving son he would be entitled to a double share of the increased share.|$|E

50|$|Many of {{the small}} towns in Malaya did not have cinemas. One of the ways the Shaw <b>brothers</b> <b>would</b> test the market was to set their own {{temporary}} cinemas in open fields. Another means was to retrofit local Malay opera houses into cinemas, by entering into joint ventures with the local owners. Wherever their films proved very popular, the Shaw <b>brothers</b> <b>would</b> build a permanent theatre. In more rural areas, mobile cinemas were operated.|$|R
25|$|The first {{reports of}} this series were {{announced}} in March 2005 when Channel 4 confirmed that Big <b>Brother</b> <b>would</b> return for its sixth series {{in the summer of}} that year. Within that announcement the company revealed that host Davina McCall, Big Brother's Little Brother presenter Dermot O'Leary, and Big Brother's Big Mouth (called Big Brother's EForum the previous year) host Russell Brand would return along with the show. Soon after, Channel 4 programming director Kevin Lygo told the press that Big Brother 5's evil theme would not return despite its success the previous year and that the programme would be renewed for 2006 and beyond.|$|E
25|$|There {{are various}} {{accounts}} {{of what happened}} subsequently, including the story that Clarence hid her in a London cookshop, disguised as a servant, so that his <b>brother</b> <b>would</b> not know where she was. Gloucester {{is said to have}} tracked her down and escorted her to sanctuary at the Church of St Martin le Grand. In order to win the final consent of his brother George to the marriage, Richard of Gloucester renounced most of Warwick’s land and property, including the earldoms of Warwick (which the earl had held in his wife’s right) and Salisbury and surrendered to Clarence the office of Great Chamberlain of England.|$|E
25|$|Following the 2007-2008 Writers Guild of America strike, {{the trade}} {{magazine}} Variety reported that CBS, in response, was considering airing a winter edition of Big Brother, {{and that the}} network started cast auditions. Several sites speculated that the winter edition {{could have been an}} American version of Celebrity Big Brother but this was untrue as CBS released a statement that the next edition of Big <b>Brother</b> <b>would</b> be a regular season following the format of past editions. The season was announced on November 15, 2007 with open casting calls being held from November 17, 2007 to December 8, 2007. The finalists for the season were chosen on December 27, 2007.|$|E

25|$|The rules {{may create}} social {{problems}} in some situations, {{especially for the}} widow. For example, among observant Jews, if the brother on whom the yibbum obligation falls is too young to marry, the widow would need {{to wait until the}} brother reaches marriage age or the age at which he may opt out of the marriage. The widow would not know if the <b>brother</b> <b>would</b> even opt out of the marriage. Furthermore, in either event, by that stage the widow may be past her child-bearing age, and still be subject to the possible obligation to marry the brother. Also, there is no time limit on the indication of the brother's intention as to whether he will proceed with the marriage or opt out, and the brother may already be married.|$|E
25|$|If a {{man held}} a peerage, his son would succeed to it; {{if he had}} no children, his <b>brother</b> <b>would</b> succeed. If he had a single daughter, his {{son-in-law}} would inherit the family lands, and usually the same Peerage; more complex cases were decided depending on circumstances. Customs changed with time; Earls {{were the first to}} be hereditary, and three different rules can be traced for the case of an Earl who left no sons and several married daughters. In the thirteenth century, the husband of the eldest daughter inherited the Earldom automatically; in the fifteenth century, the Earldom reverted to the Crown, who might regrant it (often to the eldest son-in-law); in the seventeenth century, it wouldn't be inherited by anybody unless {{all but one of the}} daughters died and left no descendants, in which case the remaining daughter (or her heir) would inherit.|$|E
25|$|On 7 April 2015, {{the band}} {{announced}} that they have begun working on the follow-up of Halo of Blood. On 29 May 2015, the band announced on their Facebook page that Roope Latvala is no longer part of Children of Bodom with the new album to be recorded as a four-piece for the first time. However, the band later updated that Latvala's part in the band will be filled in by Antti Wirman, keyboardist Janne Wirman's younger brother for live commitments {{until the end of}} the year; he debuted with the band in a private live show in Helsinki. In a later interview with Wirman, he stated that his <b>brother</b> <b>would</b> not join the band permanently. On 8 June 2015, the album title was announced as I Worship Chaos and was released through Nuclear Blast on 2 October 2015. On 19 January 2016, the band announced the addition of Daniel Freyberg on guitar. He would make his live debut with them in Tampa, Florida on 9 February.|$|E
