5|$|California condors {{have the}} largest {{wingspan}} of any North American bird. They are surpassed in both body length and weight only by the trumpeter swan and the introduced mute swan. The American white pelican and whooping crane also have longer bodies than the condor. Condors are so large that they can <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> small, distant airplane, which possibly occurs more often than they are mistaken for other species of bird.|$|E
5|$|Other {{lavender}} to violet-colored corals include Clavulina amethystinoides, {{which is}} so multiply branched so as to appear toothed, and Clavulina amethystina, {{which can only be}} reliably distinguished by its two-spored basidia in comparison to the four-spored basidia of Clavaria species. In Alloclavaria purpurea, the branching is reduced and the color usually a duller purple. The Australian coral Clavaria versatilis is also similar in appearance to Clavaria zollinger, but has branch tips that end in two short and blunt processes that are the same color {{as the rest of the}} fruit body. Ramariopsis pulchella—a small, violet-colored coral fungus rarely taller than —could <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> small C.zollingeri. It has roughly spherical spores measuring 3.0–4.5 by 2.5–3.5μm.|$|E

5|$|West of the Oder–Neisse line, the German {{states were}} reorganised {{along the lines}} of the zones of occupation, and new state governments were established. Within the American zone, the {{northern}} halves of the former states of Württemberg and Baden were merged to form Württemberg-Baden in 1946. As its flag, Württemberg-Baden adopted the black-red-gold tricolour. The choice of these colours was not based on the historical use of the tricolour, but the simple addition of gold to Württemberg's colours of red and black. Coincidentally, Baden's colours were red and yellow, so the colour choice could <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> combination of the two flags. In 1952, Württemberg-Baden became part of the modern German state of Baden-Württemberg, whose flag is black and gold.|$|E
5|$|The {{second part}} begins on November 3, 1966 with Guevara {{arriving}} in Bolivia {{disguised as a}} middle-aged representative of the Organization of American States hailing from Uruguay, who subsequently drives into the mountains to meet his men. The film is organized {{by the number of}} days {{that he was in the}} country. On Day 26, there is solidarity among Guevara's men despite his status as a foreigner. By Day 67, Guevara, however, has been set up for betrayal. He tries to recruit some peasants only to <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> cocaine smuggler, and the Bolivian Communist Party, led by Mario Monje, refuse to support the armed struggle. On Day 100, there is a shortage of food and Guevara exercises discipline to resolve conflicts between his Cuban and Bolivian followers.|$|E

25|$|Marine animals include harbor seals, Steller and California sea lions, {{and river}} otter - which may <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> sea otter, {{because they like}} {{to play on the}} sea shore, but there are no sea otters in this area.|$|E
25|$|Callaghan's {{support for}} {{and from the}} union {{movement}} should not <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> left wing position.

25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s Ace reintroduced Edgar Rice Burroughs' work, which {{had long been}} out of print, and in 1965, Ace bought the {{paperback}} rights to Dune. (Herbert's title worried Wollheim, who feared it would <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> western.) Eventually, Ace introduced single paperback books {{and became one of}} the preeminent genre publishers. Ace and Ballantine dominated sf in the 1960s and built the genre by publishing original material as well as reprints.|$|E
25|$|A coypu {{is often}} {{mistaken for a}} muskrat, another widely dispersed, semiaquatic rodent that {{occupies}} the same wetland habitats. The muskrat, however, is smaller and more tolerant of cold climates, and has a laterally flattened tail it uses to assist in swimming, whereas {{the tail of a}} coypu is round. It can also <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> small beaver, as beavers and coypus have very similar anatomies. However, beavers' tails are flat and paddle-like, as opposed to the round tails of coypus.|$|E
25|$|Although its {{distinctive}} crown patches allow for easy {{identification of the}} adult golden-crowned sparrow in breeding plumage, an immature or non-breeding bird might <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> white-crowned or white-throated sparrow. It is distinguished from the former by its crown pattern and dusky (rather than pale pink or yellowish) bill, and from the latter by its larger size, plain throat, and lack of a buff-colored central crown stripe. A young or non-breeding bird may also resemble a female house sparrow, but can be distinguished by its larger size, darker plumage, longer tail and (usually) some amount of dull yellow feathering on its forehead.|$|E

25|$|Other {{possible}} {{fractures in}} this area, {{occurring in the}} cuboid, calcaneus, and fibula, can be associated or can <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> toddler's fracture. In some cases, an internal oblique radiography and radionuclide imaging can add information to anterior-posterior and lateral views. However, since treatment can also be initiated {{in the absence of}} abnormalities, this appears to have little value in most cases. It could be useful in special cases such as children with fever, those without a clear trauma or those in which the diagnosis remains unclear. Recently, ultrasound has been suggested as a helpful diagnostic tool.|$|E
25|$|Call features: The {{ability of}} the issuer (on some bonds) to call a bond early for redemption. This should not <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> call option. A Softcall would refer to a call feature where the issuer can only call under certain circumstances, {{typically}} based on the underlying stock price performance (e.g. current stock price is above 130% of the conversion price for 20 days out of 30 days). A Hardcall feature would not need any specific conditions beyond a date: that case the issuer {{would be able to}} recall a portion or the totally of the issuance at the Call price (typically par) after a specific date.|$|E
25|$|On one occasion, Powell's yellow skin (he was {{recovering}} from jaundice), overly formal dress and strange manner caused him to <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Japanese spy. During this period he declined to meet a Cambridge academic colleague, Glyn Daniel, for a drink or dinner as he was devoting his limited leisure time to studying the poet John Donne. Powell had continued to learn Urdu, consistent with his ambition of becoming Viceroy of India, and when Mountbatten transferred his staff to Kandy, Ceylon, Powell chose to remain in Delhi. He was promoted to full colonel {{at the end of}} March 1944, as assistant director of military intelligence in India, giving intelligence support to the Burma campaign of William Slim.|$|E

25|$|M78 (NGC 2068) is a nebula in Orion. With {{an overall}} {{magnitude}} of 8.0, it is significantly dimmer than the Great Orion Nebula that lies to its south; however, {{it is at}} approximately the same distance, at 1600 light-years from Earth. It can easily <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> comet in the eyepiece of a telescope. M78 {{is associated with the}} variable star V351 Orionis, whose magnitude changes are visible in very short periods of time. Another fairly bright nebula in Orion is NGC 1999, also close to the Great Orion Nebula. It has an integrated magnitude of 10.5 and is 1500 light-years from Earth. The variable star V380 Orionis is embedded in NGC 1999.|$|E
25|$|Socrates {{also says}} that the accusations {{for which he is}} {{answering}} in court already had been spoken and published by the comic poet Aristophanes, and are therefore beyond the legal scope of a trial for corruption and impiety. Years earlier, in the play The Clouds (423 BC), Aristophanes lampooned Socrates as a charlatan, the paradigm philosopher of atheist and scientific sophistry — carefully arranged arguments constructed of ornate words and phrases — misrepresented as wisdom. In light of that definition, Socrates defensively argues that he cannot <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Sophist philosopher because Sophists are wise men, are thought to be wise by the people of Athens, and, thus, are highly paid for their teaching; whereas he (Socrates) lives in ten-thousand-fold poverty, and knows nothing noble and good (23c).|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of a uterine fibroid versus an adnexal tumor is made. Fibroids can be mistaken for ovarian neoplasms. An uncommon tumor which may <b>be</b> <b>mistaken</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fibroid is Sarcoma botryoides. It {{is more common in}} children and adolescents. Like a fibroid, it can also protrude from the vagina and is distinguished from fibroids. While palpation used in a pelvic examination can typically identify the {{presence of}} larger fibroids, gynecologic ultrasonography (ultrasound) has evolved as the standard tool to evaluate the uterus for fibroids. Sonography will depict the fibroids as focal masses with a heterogeneous texture, which usually cause shadowing of the ultrasound beam. The location can be determined and dimensions of the lesion measured. Also, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to define the depiction of the size and location of the fibroids within the uterus.|$|E
