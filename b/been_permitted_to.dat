50|$|To thus {{pressure}} Jews {{to emigrate}} {{and to protect}} state security against Jewish political activists, he proposed racial quotas, segregation, discrimination, disenfranchisement, presaging Nazi policies and apartheid and anti-immigration legislation: * All privileges granted to Jews because of their education or because of their occupations should be withdrawn.* No Jews should <b>be</b> <b>permitted</b> <b>to</b> live in seaports.* Jewish children should not <b>be</b> <b>permitted</b> <b>to</b> attend schools attended by Christian children.* Jews should also be prohibited from establishing schools of their own.* Jews should be forbidden to teach in Government or private schools.* Jews should not <b>be</b> <b>permitted</b> <b>to</b> hold any Government or civil office.* Jews should not <b>be</b> <b>permitted</b> <b>to</b> get any concessions {{and should not be}} connected with any Government contracts.* Jews should not be employed on any steamship or railway in Russia.* Jews should not <b>be</b> <b>permitted</b> <b>to</b> vote, and under no circumstances should they <b>be</b> <b>permitted</b> <b>to</b> serve in the Duma or the Council of the Empire.* Nor should they be allowed to participate in the elections.* Jews should not <b>be</b> <b>permitted</b> <b>to</b> have drugstores of their own, to be druggists, or to work as clerks in such stores.* Jews in any way connected with revolutionists should be dealt with harshly, and their property should be confiscated.* Jews should not <b>be</b> <b>permitted</b> <b>to</b> act as editors or publishers of periodical publications.* Jews should not <b>be</b> <b>permitted</b> <b>to</b> have bookstores and printing shops.* All foreign Jews, citizens of other countries, should be forbidden to enter Russia.|$|R
5|$|Captive {{breeding}} {{is another}} method of stabilizing the bog turtles' numbers. The technique involves mating bog turtles indoors in controlled environments, where nutrition and mates are provided. Fred Wustholz and Richard J. Holub {{were the first}} to do this independently, during the 1960s and 1970s. They were interested in educating others about the bog turtle and in increasing its population, and over several years they released many healthy bog turtles into the wild. Various organizations, such as the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, have <b>been</b> <b>permitted</b> <b>to</b> breed bog turtles in captivity.|$|E
5|$|Sometime between 343 and 340BC, Neaira {{was brought}} to trial by Theomnestus {{on behalf of his}} {{father-in-law}} Apollodorus, accused of xenias (representing herself as a citizen when in fact she was not). If she was convicted, the maximum penalty Neaira faced was being sold into slavery and having her property sold. Neaira herself would not have <b>been</b> <b>permitted</b> <b>to</b> speak at her trial, though she was probably present.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} of the Liberal candidate in Yukon was contested by the losing Tory candidate. After a trial before the Yukon Territorial Court, that court voided the election, holding that enough ineligible people had <b>been</b> <b>permitted</b> <b>to</b> vote to affect the outcome, though the court noted {{that it was not}} the fault of the Liberal candidate that these irregularities had occurred. The Tory, Erik Nielsen, won the new election in December 1957.|$|E

5|$|Following a final {{appearance}} at the 1948 Summer Olympics, art competitions {{were removed from the}} Olympic program. Planners of the 1952 Summer Olympics opposed their inclusion on logistical grounds, claiming that the lack of an international association for the event meant that the entire onus of facilitation was placed on the local organizing committee. Concerns were also raised about the professionalism of the event, since only amateurs were allowed to participate in the sporting tournaments, and the growing commercialization of the competitions, as artists had <b>been</b> <b>permitted</b> <b>to</b> sell their submissions {{during the course of the}} Games since 1928. In 1952 an art festival and exhibition was held concurrent with the Games, a tradition that has been maintained in all subsequent Summer Olympics.|$|E
5|$|The Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources is {{responsible}} for general strategy in {{the oil and gas}} sectors and for monitoring the state-owned oil company, Saudi Aramco. The oil, gas and refining industries in Saudi Arabia are controlled by law by Saudi Aramco, which has a near monopoly in these areas. It is the world's biggest oil producer, the Middle East's biggest company and is generally considered {{to be the most important}} energy company in the world. However, in 2003, the law was changed to allow foreign companies to look for Saudi Arabia's vast reserves of natural gas, believed to represent 4% of the world's reserves. This was the first time since the 1970s that foreign companies have <b>been</b> <b>permitted</b> <b>to</b> search for oil or gas.|$|E
5|$|At the queen's villa in Algiers, Ranavalona was {{provided}} with servants and a French female attendant who kept her under observation and remained present whenever the queen entertained guests in her home. In addition, {{the government of}} France initially provided Ranavalona with an annual allowance of 25,000 francs paid from the budget for the colony of Madagascar and authorized by the colony's Governor General. Nearly all the queen's property had been seized by the colonial authority, although she had <b>been</b> <b>permitted</b> <b>to</b> keep certain personal belongings, including some of her jewelry. Her initial pension allowed such a humble lifestyle that the colonial government of Algeria lobbied unsuccessfully several times on her behalf to obtain an increase for her. Ranavalona also tasked a servant with selling some of her jewelry for cash, but the plan was discovered by the French colonial authorities and the servant was discharged and sent back to Madagascar.|$|E
50|$|School colours - School colours {{are awarded}} for {{services}} to School sport, culture {{and other areas}} deemed worthy. They all have a similar design and are covered in Sutton's Crests (The crest of Thomas Sutton).

A party contesting all 71 electorates <b>is</b> therefore <b>permitted</b> <b>to</b> spend $2,915,700 on election campaigning. All electorate candidates <b>are</b> <b>permitted</b> <b>to</b> spend $25,700 each on campaigning over and above their party's allocation.|$|R
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Hiroshima, {{almost all of}} the buildings were of old-fashioned Japanese construction, consisting of timber or timber-framed buildings with timber walls (with or without plaster) and tile roofs. Many of the smaller industries and business establishments were also situated in buildings of timber or other materials not designed to withstand explosions. Nagasaki had <b>been</b> <b>permitted</b> <b>to</b> grow for many years without conforming to any definite city zoning plan; residences were erected adjacent to factory buildings and to each other almost as closely as possible throughout the entire industrial valley. On the day of the bombing, an estimated 263,000 people were in Nagasaki, including 240,000 Japanese residents, 10,000 Korean residents, 2,500 conscripted Korean workers, 9,000 Japanese soldiers, 600 conscripted Chinese workers, and 400 Allied prisoners of war in a camp to the north of Nagasaki.|$|E
5|$|Under {{a renewed}} {{agreement}} in 1999, {{all but one}} of the St. Louis County districts agreed to continue their participation, albeit with an opt-out clause that allowed districts to reduce the number of incoming transfer students starting in 2002. In addition, districts have <b>been</b> <b>permitted</b> <b>to</b> reduce available seats in the program. Since 1999, districts have reduced availability by five percent annually. A five-year extension of the voluntary transfer program was approved in 2007, and another five-year extension was approved in 2012, allowing new enrollments to take place through the 20182019 school year in participating districts. Critics of the transfer program note that most of the desegregation under the plan is via transfer of black students to the county rather than transfer of white students to the city. Another criticism has been that the program weakens city schools by removing talented students to county schools. Despite these issues, the program will continue until all transfer students reach graduation; with the last group of transfer students allowed to enroll in 20182019, the program will end after the 20302031 school year.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1998 Act, whistleblowers in the United Kingdom had no {{protection}} against being dismissed by their employer. Although they could avoid being sued for {{breach of confidence}} thanks to a public interest defence, this did not prevent subtle or open victimisation in the workplace, including disciplinary action, dismissal, failure to gain promotion or a pay rise. During the early to mid-1990s, interest in whistleblower protection grew, partially because {{of a series of}} financial scandals and health and safety accidents, which investigations into showed could have been prevented if employees had <b>been</b> <b>permitted</b> <b>to</b> voice their concerns, and partially because of the work of the Committee on Standards in Public Life. In 1995 and 1996, two private member's bills dealing with whistleblowers were introduced to Parliament, by Tony Wright and Don Touhig respectively, but both efforts fell through. When Richard Shepherd proposed a similar bill, however, he got government support for it on the condition that it be an amendment to the Employment Rights Act 1996 rather than a new area of law in its own right. Public Concern at Work, a UK-based whistleblowers charity, was involved in the drafting and consultation stages of the bill. The case of Graham Pink added to the pressure to introduce whistleblower protection legislation.|$|E
