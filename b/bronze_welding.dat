As he honed his skills, he began to create more sophisticated designs. He focused initially on wall sculptures for banks or ceremonial objects for churches and synagogues. In the late 1960s, Miller taught art at Virginia Polytechnic Institute.|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} investigated {{properties of}} aluminum <b>bronze</b> <b>welded</b> to structural steel St 52 - 3 N. Surface material CuAl-A 3 was welded in {{one and two}} layers. There were dimension, metallographic examination of structures and hardness measured before and after heat treatment and after pressurization of tested specimens. It was determined that the specimens achieved the best performance by welding two layers of surface material, by postweld heat treatment and by “hammering“...|$|R

Playground (1/3) is located at the Memorial Art Gallery in Rochester, NY. Playground (2/3) and the artist’s proof belong to private collections. In addition to large, welded steel sculptures and an artist’s proof, Smith also made smaller versions of his sculptures out of cast <b>bronze,</b> <b>welded</b> <b>bronze,</b> or steel.

5000|$|The bonang is {{a musical}} {{instrument}} used in the Javanese gamelan. It {{is a collection of}} small gongs (sometimes called [...] "kettles" [...] or [...] "pots") placed horizontally onto strings in a wooden frame (rancak), either one or two rows wide. All of the kettles have a central boss, but around it the lower-pitched ones have a flattened head, while the higher ones have an arched one. Each is tuned to a specific pitch in the appropriate scale; thus there are different bonang for pelog and slendro. They are typically hit with padded sticks (tabuh). This is similar to the other cradled gongs in the gamelan, the kethuk, kempyang, and kenong. Bonang may be made of forged <b>bronze,</b> <b>welded</b> and cold-hammered iron, or a combination of metals. In addition to the gong-shaped form of kettles, economical bonang made of hammered iron or brass plates with raised bosses are often found in village gamelan, in Suriname-style gamelan, and in some American gamelan.|$|R

Decker is a Utah-based artist, historian and Harley enthusiast. This sculpture is an enlarged life and 1/2 size of his original called, By the Horns; a sculpture referencing the similarities of bull riding and the sport hill climbing. This was a somewhat collaborative piece done with painter David Uhl, another artist licensed by Harley-Davidson. The rider is shown participating in a sport called hill climbing, popular in the 1920s and 30’s. The figure is free of fear in his eyes as one foot is being swept off the bike and his right arm extends backwards."He is crashing," [...] Decker said of the helmet less young rider. [...] "But every hill climber crashes. It's part of the race." [...] Hill climbers were known to race up hills nicknamed the “widow maker” because of the danger and high rate of injury involved in this sport. The sculpture portrays a vintage Harley rider frozen in a skyward wheelie on a DAH bike, one of only six in the world. A documentation to the artist's friendship with Willie and Nancy Davidson {{can be seen on}} the gear drive that is inscribed with [...] "Willie G." ...|$|R
50|$|During {{the early}} 1970s, Houser {{continued}} {{to teach at}} the Institute and began the rigorous production and exhibition cycle for which he became well known. As head of the sculpture department, he felt compelled to work in as many sculptural media as possible, evidenced by his solo exhibition of stone, <b>bronze</b> and <b>welded</b> steel sculptures at the Heard Museum in Phoenix, Arizona in 1970.

50|$|The {{inside of}} each sand cast mold was layered with {{plasticine}} (¼ inch thick). The application of graphite {{to the sand}} cast and the plasticine prevented the materials from bonding. A second sand cast was made over the plasticine. This process created a void, which would be filled with melted bronze. To avoid the formation of air pockets air vents were installed before pouring the bronze. The <b>bronze</b> sections were <b>welded</b> together and sandblasted (using a wire brush) to clean the sculpture and produce a uniform texture. Lastly, the bronze was coated with a patina {{to protect it from}} the elements of the outdoors.|$|R

Diverse {{creative}} achievements characterized this period of her life, including her solo exhibition at the SculptureCenter--Luise Kaish, Bronzes, which garnered enthusiastic reviews—and an invitation {{to participate in the}} Museum of Modern Art's Recent Sculpture USA in 1959. In a review of her solo show at the SculptureCenter, Robert Dash asserted, [...] "A sudden sense of epiphany and the blistering pain of revelation infuse with grandeur forty-six exquisitely cast or <b>welded</b> <b>bronzes</b> and coppers. Miss Kaish (who studied with Maestrovich sic at Syracuse and who now returns from Italy after the completion of a Tiffany grant) believes that 'the poetry of creation expresses the striving of man after God and his desire to form a continuous pattern of identification with the source of all being.' It is an unusual pronunciamento. It exactly qualifies the work." ...|$|R
