40|$|International audienceRecent {{concerns}} regarding {{the decline of}} plant and pollinator species, and the impact on ecosystem functioning, has focused attention on the local and global threats to bee diversity. As evidence for bee declines is now accumulating from over broad taxonomic and geographic scales, we review the role of ecology in <b>bee</b> <b>conservation</b> at the levels of species, populations and communities. Bee populations and communities are typified by considerable spatiotemporal variation; whereby autecological traits, population size and growth rate, and plant-pollinator network architecture all {{play a role in}} their vulnerability to extinction. As contemporary insect conservation management is broadly based on species- and habitat-targeted approaches, ecological data will be central to integrating management strategies into a broader, landscape scale of dynamic, interconnected habitats capable of delivering <b>bee</b> <b>conservation</b> in the context of global environmental change...|$|E
40|$|Urban bee ecology is an {{emerging}} field that holds promise for advancing knowledge of bee community dynamics and promoting <b>bee</b> <b>conservation.</b> Published studies of bee communities in {{urban and suburban}} habitats are fewer than those documenting bees in agricultural and wildland settings. As land lost to urbanization is predicted to increase in coming years the necessity of studying urban bee populations is growing. We reviewed 59 publications on urban bee ecology with the following goals, to assess current knowledge, to highlight areas in need of further research, and to suggest applications of study findings to <b>bee</b> <b>conservation.</b> Identified trends in urban areas included the following, negative correlation between bee species richness and urban development, increase in abundance of cavity-nesters in urban habitats, and scarcity of floral specialists.

40|$|Conservation biologists, {{evolutionary}} ecologists {{and agricultural}} biologists require an improved {{understanding of how}} pollinators utilize space and share resources. Using microsatellite markers, we conducted a genetic analysis of space use and resource sharing at several spatial scales among workers of two ecologically dissimilar bumble bee species (Bombus terrestris and B. pascuorum) foraging in an urban landscape (London, UK). At fine scales, the relatedness of workers visiting small patches of flowers {{did not differ significantly}} from zero. Therefore, colonies shared flower patches randomly with other colonies, suggesting that worker scent-marks deterring visits to unrewarding flowers have not evolved as signals benefiting nestmates. To investigate space use at intermediate scales, we developed a program based on Thomas & Hill's maximum likelihood sibship reconstruction method to estimate the number of colonies utilizing single sites. The average number of colonies (95 % confidence limits) sending workers to forage at sites of ˜ 1 ha in area was 96 colonies (84 – 118) in B. terrestris and 66 colonies (61 – 76) in B. pascuorum. These values are surprisingly high and suggested that workers travelled far from their colonies to visit the sites. At the landscape scale, there was little or no genetic differentiation between sites. We conclude that urban habitats support large bumble bee populations and are potentially valuable in terms of bumble <b>bee</b> <b>conservation.</b> In addition, bumble bee-mediated gene flow in plants is likely to occur over large distances and plant–bumble <b>bee</b> <b>conservation</b> requires landscape-scale action...|$|E

40|$|Agricultural field {{margins are}} often {{recommended}} as a cost-effective and efficient method for wild <b>bee</b> <b>conservation,</b> {{in response to}} the threat imposed by global pollinator declines as a result of intensive agricultural practices. In this study we compared margin characteristics and wild bee community structure from sites with landscapes of varying agricultural intensity in order to (i) investigate if field margins are valuable for wild <b>bee</b> <b>conservation</b> in all types of landscapes, and (ii) determine which biotic and abiotic margin characteristics best support wild bee abundance and community richness. Margin surveys and wild bee community sampling, comprising pan traps and observations of foraging activity, were carried out over three years at 27 cereal field margins in Catalonia, Spain. Generalized linear models indicated a strong inverse relationship between surrounding landscape diversity and wild bee abundance. The proportion of Halictidae bees (common generalists) increased with decreasing landscape complexity. Floral richness exhibited a positive association with number of foraging bees and morphospecies richness, and was positively correlated with the proportion of shrubs and trees represented in the margins. It was observed that wider margins held a higher proportion of perennial plants and a lower proportion of Halictidae bees. Our study suggests that field margins are more crucial in intensively farmed areas than in heterogeneous landscapes where foraging resources are more abundant. Maintaining wide margins with high flowering plant richness, comprising perennial and shrub species, best supports a dense and diverse bee community. In more diverse landscapes, conservation efforts focused on maintaining the quality of existing natural patches may be most effective.

The ap-plication of genetics to the conservation of diploid animals {{has proven to be}} important for both overcoming genetic threats to population viability and for providing tools to guide conservation programs. However, the haplodiploid bees have several unusual genetic properties of relevance to their conservation, which warrant special attention. Here I review how haplodiploidy and complementary sex determination affect genetic parameters pertinent to the viability and future evolutionary potential of bee populations. I also review how genetic tools can improve the conservation management of bees. I find that bees are especially prone to extinction for genetic reasons, and that genetics can provide invaluable tools for managing bee populations to circumvent pollinator decline...|$|E
50|$|Osmia xanthomelana was kmnown {{from around}} 28 {{scattered}} sites in Great Britain {{as far north}} as Tyneside but it was thought to have been reduced to a single site on the Isle of Wight by the 1990s, from which no bees have been recorded since the 1990s. However, two sites were discovered on the Llŷn Peninsula in Wales in 1998 and 1999. It is thought that individual sites can be lost due to erosion and sudden landslips and this is what destroyed the Isle of Wight site. The forage plant of O. xanthomelana, bird’s-foot trefoil, is sensitive to over or under grazing and these can result in the loss of the plants during the colony cycle of the bee. It is also thought that climate change and agricultural run-off from nearby intensive farmland are also threats to the <b>bee</b> populations. <b>Conservation</b> measures have included clearing invasive vegetation from banks and the creation of new banks.|$|R

40|$|Certain {{pollinator}} {{populations are}} threatened globally due to habitat fragmentation and alteration, pesticides, disease and infestations by parasites. Localized population declines have prompted {{interest on the}} part of various stakeholders in restoring and maintaining pollinator-friendly habitats on working landscapes, particularly private agricultural lands. Recommendations from the National Research Council's report, Status of Pollinators in North America, include informing the agricultural community about ways to manage pollinators and conducting studies to improve restoration protocols and to understand land managers' willingness to adopt pollinator-friendly practices (NRC 2007). Interdisciplinary in nature, this research follows NRC's recommendations and incorporates methods from environmental science, ecology and anthropology to investigate and evaluate the opportunities and challenges to native <b>bee</b> <b>conservation</b> in Mid-Atlantic sustainable agriculture. I censused sustainable agriculture farms to assess the diversity of bees in different habitats and collected and identified over 3100 individuals representing five families, 26 genera and 81 species. Native bee abundance measures indicated a temporal shift in foraging among habitats with more bees moving into crops in mid-summer. I investigated floral constancy and visitation rates among native bees at Blandy Experimental Farm in Boyce, VA and found that bees move primarily among conspecific flowers and that particular flowers are more attractive to certain bee genera. I also investigated pollination of okra (Abelmoschus esculentus) and bell pepper (Capsicum annuum) and examined importance of native bees to Mid-Atlantic vegetable crops. Additionally, I conducted a survey to examine similarities and differences in beliefs and values of Mid-Atlantic sustainable agriculture producers and pollinator scientists/managers in relation to native <b>bee</b> <b>conservation.</b> Sustainable agriculture farmers already hold beliefs, values and knowledge about ecosystem services conservation; therefore to formulate effective outreach, {{there is a need to}} understand how these beliefs differ or align with those of pollinator advocates.

40|$|The {{conversion}} of natural habitat for agricultural use {{continues to be}} a prevalent threat to wild pollinator populations, although the establishment of semi-natural habitats in agroecosystems can successfully bolster <b>bee</b> populations. <b>Conservation</b> Reserve Program (CRP) plantings provide a unique opportunity to understand the effects of conservation efforts on wild bee populations. To assess the conservation value of CRP plantings for native pollinators, I analyzed the contents of trap nests deployed in 29 field sites over the 2014 flowering season, including 18 CRP grassland plantings and 11 rangelands in northeastern Colorado. I compared the abundance and diversity of cavity-nesting bees between site types, and explored mechanisms driving reproduction and performance of the most common native cavity-nesting bees. Despite significantly higher plant species richness on rangeland sites, CRP plantings supported greater wild bee abundance and Megachile spp. fecundity, although {{there was no difference in}} genus richness between the two land types. Additionally, there was no significant difference in the body size of native female Megachile brevis. Only one introduced species was present in our samples (Megachile rotundata), and was not found in rangeland sites, suggesting that rangeland plant communities may play an important role in supporting native bee species. These results indicate that compared with rangelands, the Conservation Reserve Program provides significant benefits to wild bee populations. Further studies should investigate the persistence of these patterns over multiple flowering seasons and potential mechanisms driving cavity-nesting bee population dynamics within these agroecosystems...|$|R
40|$|We {{reviewed}} {{the theory of}} conservation genetics, with special emphasis {{on the influence of}} haplodiploidy and other aspects of <b>bee</b> biology upon <b>conservation</b> genetic parameters. We then investigated the possibility that pollinator decline can be addressed in this way, using two meta-analytical approaches on genetic data from the Hymenoptera and the Lepidoptera. First, we compared levels of heterozygosity between the orders. As has been found previously, the haplodiploid Hymenoptera had markedly lower levels of genetic variation than the Lepidoptera. Bees had even lower levels, and bumble bees, in particular, often seemed almost monomorphic genetically. However, the statistically confounding effects of phylogeny render detailed interpretation of such data difficult. Second, we investigated patterns of gene flow among populations of these insects. Hymenoptera were far more likely to show genetic effects of population fragmentation than are Lepidoptera, even at similar geographic distances between populations. The reduced effective population sizes resulting from haplodiploidy probably contributed to this result. The proportion of species with low levels of gene flow did not vary among the different taxonomic groups within the Hymenoptera...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Nowadays, the {{northern}} part of the Atlantic Rainforest of Brazil is largely destroyed and forest remnants rarely exceed 100 ha. In a 118 ha forest fragment within a state nature reserve of Pernambuco (Reserva Ecológica Gurjaú), we surveyed the orchid bee fauna (Apidae, Euglossini) using eight different scent baits to attract males. Once a month during one year, the bees were actively collected with entomological nets, from November 2002 to October 2003 by two collectors. We collected 2, 908 orchid bee males belonging to 23 species, one of the highest richness values of the Northern Atlantic Rainforest. Bees of only two species, Euglossa carolina (50 %) and Eulaema nigrita (25 %), which occurred throughout the year, accounted for three quarter of the collected individuals. Both species are typical for open or disturbed areas.

40|$|Crofting {{is a low}} {{intensity}} {{agricultural system}} restricted to the Highlands and Islands of northern Scotland typified by small scale mixed livestock production and rotational cropping activities. As with other low intensity farming systems across Europe, crofting is changing {{in response to a}} range of socio-economic factors. This is having a negative impact on the populations of rare bumblebees that are associated with this agricultural system. In this paper we use an ecological–economic modelling approach to examine the likely impacts of introducing two different management options for conserving bumblebees on croft land-use and income. Two linear programming models were constructed to represent the predominant crofting systems found in the Outer Hebrides, and varying constraints on bumblebee abundance were imposed to examine the trade-off between conservation and agricultural incomes. The model outputs illustrate that in some instances it is likely that both agricultural profits and bumblebee densities can be enhanced. We conclude that policy-makers should take into consideration the type of farming system when designing cost-effective agri-environment policies for low intensity farming systems, and that improvements in <b>bee</b> <b>conservation</b> are not necessarily in conflict with maintaining farm inco...|$|E
40|$|Most {{biologists}} {{agree that}} the availability of suitable nesting sites is a limiting factor for bumble bee populations (Free, 1959). Bumble bees always select areas with preexisting insulation for nesting. Fur-lined abandoned rodent dens are especially attractive, but occasionally, abandoned man-made materials are inhabited. It is not rare to find multiple dead queens in a nest indicating that they have fought for ownership. Despite our knowledge of bumble bee nest site selection, most efforts to attract bumble bees to artificial domiciles have been met with limited success (Fye 2 ̆ 6 Medler, 1954; Hobbs et al., 1960). Creating and evaluating artificial domiciles provides students an opportunity to investigate a real problem.

They will also {{have an opportunity to}} contribute to solving a problem that could greatly enhance bumble <b>bee</b> <b>conservation</b> efforts. Developing a highly-attractive artificial domicile would help to increase local bumble bee populations and benefit the plants they pollinate, including many fruit and vegetable crops.

40|$|It is {{now widely}} {{accepted}} that over {{one-third of the}} global food supply depends upon pollinators. Risking severe ecological and economic implications, {{the status of the}} 4000 species of bees native to North America has been poorly understood {{due to a lack of}} long-term survey data. In this study, I conducted bee surveys on Massachusetts cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.) bogs from 2007 - 2009 and compared diversity and abundance data to those from historical surveys performed in 1990 - 1992 on the same bogs. I found that overall bee diversity declined severely in the 19 -year survey period, while total bee abundance remained consistent. My data provide supporting evidence for the loss of North American bumble bees (Bombus spp.), but also provide the first evidence for declines in the U. S. in overall wild bee diversity. Maximizing the potential for agricultural landscapes to serve as quality pollinator habitat and identifying appropriate integrated pest management strategies should involve a comprehensive understanding of each species’ life history traits and conservation status. The loss of biodiversity associated with the intensification of agriculture has been well documented for several wildlife species but remains poorly understood for bees, which provide pollination to many agricultural crops. Most pollinator-dependent crops rely heavily on managed honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) for pollination. Four thousand other species of bees native to North America may provide pollination insurance in the event of honey bee losses, but without a clear understanding of how agricultural intensification affects wild <b>bees,</b> habitat <b>conservation</b> measures aimed at protecting them may be futile. In the second part of this study, I evaluated six metrics of agricultural intensification with respect to native bee diversity and abundance in Massachusetts cranberry bogs, including honey bee competition, bog management type (i. e. organic versus conventional), distance from epicenter of cranberry-growing region, toxicity of insecticide program, susceptibility of reproductive bees to insecticide, and surrounding land use. I found a clear association between reduced native bee diversity and abundance and the effects of increased agricultural intensification of the landscape. Recognition that native bee communities in North America are diminishing as a consequence of agricultural intensification may help to unify a movement toward improved conservation management...|$|R

40|$|Stingless bees play an {{important}} ecological role as pollinators of many wild plant species in the tropics and have significant potential for the pollination of agricultural crops. Nevertheless, conservation efforts as well as commercial breeding programmes require better guidelines {{on the amount of}} genetic variation that is needed to maintain viable populations. In this context, we carried out a long-term genetic study on the stingless bee Melipona scutellaris to evaluate the population viability consequences of prolonged breeding from a small number of founder colonies. In particular, it was artificially imposed a genetic bottleneck by setting up a population starting from only two founder colonies, and continued breeding from it for a period of over 10 years in a location outside its natural area of occurrence. We show that despite a great {{reduction in the number of}} alleles present at both neutral microsatellite loci and the sex-determining locus relative to its natural source population, and an increased frequency in the production of sterile diploid males, the genetically impoverished population could be successfully bred and maintained for at least 10 years. This shows that in stingless bees, breeding from a small stock of colonies may have less severe consequences than previously suspected. In addition, we provide a simulation model to determine the number of colonies that are needed to maintain a certain number of sex alleles in a population, thereby providing useful guidelines for stingless <b>bee</b> breeding and <b>conservation</b> efforts.

40|$|Bumblebees are {{valuable}} pollinators of numerous wild and cultivated plants. They can forage on variable pollen resources. As some pollen species lack particular nutrients or have global low nutritional quality, {{it has been}} suggested that bumblebees mix their pollen incomes to ensure a global balanced diet. The hypothesis that a mixed pollen diet better supports bumblebee colony development than a single pollen diet has been poorly explored. We compared the impact of mono-, di- and trifloral diets on microcolony development of Bombus terrestris using three pollen resources with different nutrient contents (Cytisus scoparius, Erica sp. and Sorbus aucuparia) as well as their mixes. Nine parameters (e. g. pollen efficacy: total weight of larvae/total weight of pollen collection) were used to compare the microcolony performances. Moreover, we measured the influence of the pollen diversity and nutritional composition on relevant parameters. We showed that microcolonies can potentially better develop on mixed pollen diets, but single pollen diet can also be as good as mixed pollen diet. Moreover, the sterol concentration appeared as a key factor to establish the impact of a pollen diet on the bumblebee colony development. This study reveals that diverse pollen diet does not necessary equate with good colony development and supports the importance of selecting floral resources by considering their nutrient contents for <b>bee</b> <b>conservation</b> management.

40|$|Although solitary {{bees are}} {{considered}} to play key roles in ecosystem functions, surprisingly few studies have explored their population dynamics. We investigated the population dynamics of a rare, declining, solitary bee (Andrena humilis) in a landscape of 80 km 2 in southern Sweden from 2003 to 2011. Only one population was persistent throughout all years studied; most likely this population supplied the surrounding landscape with 11 smaller, temporary local populations. Despite stable pollen availability, {{the size of the}} persistent population fluctuated dramatically in a two-year cycle over the nine years, with 490 - 1230 nests in odd-numbered years and 21 - 48 nests in even-numbered years. These fluctuations were not significantly related to climatic variables or pollen availability. Nineteen colonization and 14 extinction events were recorded. Occupancy decreased with distance from the persistent population and increased with increasing resource (pollen) availability. There were significant positive correlations between the size of the persistent population and patch occupancy and colonization. Colonizations were generally more common in patches closer to the persistent population, whereas extinctions were independent of distance from the persistent population. Our results highlight the complex population dynamics that exist for this solitary bee species, which could be due to source-sink dynamics, a prolonged diapause, or can represent a bet-hedging strategy to avoid natural enemies and survive in small habitat patches. If large fluctuations in solitary bee populations prove to be widespread, it will have important implications for interpreting ecological relationships, <b>bee</b> <b>conservation,</b> and pollination...|$|E
40|$|Restrictions {{on the use}} of {{neonicotinoid}} insecticides in the European Union {{are widely}} debated in relation to bee decline, but their potential consequences at the interface between sustainable crop production and conservation are less frequently discussed. This paper raises issues to be considered if we are to achieve a balanced consensus in this contentious area. The common legal framework governing testing and environmental impact for all chemical crop protection products is highlighted, leading to concerns that the current focus on impact of neonicotinoids is diverting attention from other drivers of bee decline to the detriment of a balanced conservation strategy. The evidence for the causal relationship between neonicotinoid use and bee decline is considered and information gaps requiring further work identified. How research into the parallel use of pesticides and beneficial invertebrates in integrated pest management (IPM) can inform the pollinator debate is highlighted. The importance of the neonicotinoids in major IPM systems is illustrated, leading to discussion of potential consequences for conservation of biodiversity and sustainable crop protection if they were lost and we revert to reliance on other pest management options. Increasing agricultural production and conservation are sometimes viewed as being contradictory and the paper concludes by calling for a broadening of the discussion to consider the complimentary objectives of <b>bee</b> <b>conservation</b> and sustainable crop production, so that advances in both fields can hasten consensus on the way forward, rather than perpetuating the current rather polarised debate...|$|E
40|$|Species {{distribution}} models (SDM) {{are increasingly}} used {{to understand the}} factors that regulate variation in biodiversity patterns and to help plan conservation strategies. However, these models are rarely validated with independently collected data and {{it is unclear whether}} SDM performance is maintained across distinct habitats and for species with different functional traits. Highly mobile species, such as bees, can be particularly challenging to model. Here, we use independent sets of occurrence data collected systematically in several agricultural habitats to test how the predictive performance of SDMs for wild bee species depends on species traits, habitat type, and sampling technique. We used a species distribution modeling approach parametrized for the Netherlands, with presence records from 1990 to 2010 for 193 Dutch wild bees. For each species, we built a Maxent model based on 13 climate and landscape variables. We tested the predictive performance of the SDMs with independent datasets collected from orchards and arable fields across the Netherlands from 2010 to 2013, using transect surveys or pan traps. Model predictive performance depended on species traits and habitat type. Occurrence of bee species specialized in habitat and diet was better predicted than generalist bees. Predictions of habitat suitability were also more precise for habitats that are temporally more stable (orchards) than for habitats that suffer regular alterations (arable), particularly for small, solitary <b>bees.</b> As a <b>conservation</b> tool, SDMs are best suited to modeling rarer, specialist species than more generalist and will work best in long-term stable habitats. The variability of complex, short-term habitats is difficult to capture in such models and historical land use generally has low thematic resolution. To improve SDMs’ usefulness, models require explanatory variables and collection data that include detailed landscape characteristics, for example, variability of crops and flower availability. Additionally, testing SDMs with field surveys should involve multiple collection techniques...|$|R
40|$|Bumble bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae, Bombus) are pollinators of {{wild and}} {{economically}} important flowering plants. However, {{at least four}} bumble bee species have declined significantly in population abundance and geographic range relative to historic estimates, and one species is possibly extinct. While a wealth of historic data is now available {{for many of the}} North American species found to be in decline in online databases, systematic survey data of stable species is still not publically available. The availability of contemporary survey data is critically important for the future monitoring of wild bumble bee populations. Without such data, the ability to ascertain the conservation status of bumble bees in the United States will remain challenging. This paper describes USBombus, a large database that represents the outcomes of one of the largest standardized surveys of bumble bee pollinators (Hymenoptera, Apidae, Bombus) globally. The motivation to collect live bumble bees across the United States was to examine the decline and conservation status of Bombus affinis, B. occidentalis, B. pensylvanicus, and B. terricola. Prior to our national survey of bumble bees in the United States from 2007 to 2010, there have only been regional accounts of bumble bee abundance and richness. In addition to surveying declining bumble bees, we also collected and documented a diversity of co-occuring bumble bees. However we have not yet completely reported their distribution and diversity onto a public online platform. Now, for the first time, we report the geographic distribution of bumble bees reported to be in decline (Cameron et al. 2011), as well as bumble bees that appeared to be stable on a large geographic scale in the United States (not in decline). In this database we report a total of 17, 930 adult occurrence records across 397 locations and 39 species of Bombus detected in our national survey. We summarize their abundance and distribution across the United States and association to different ecoregions. The geospatial coverage of the dataset extends across 41 of the 50 US states, and from 0 to 3500 m a. s. l. Authors and respective field crews spent a total of 512 hours surveying bumble bees from 2007 to 2010. The dataset was developed using SQL server 2008 r 2. For each specimen, the following information is generally provided: species, name, sex, caste, temporal and geospatial details, Cartesian coordinates, data collector(s), and when available, host plants. This database has already proven useful for a variety of studies on bumble <b>bee</b> ecology and <b>conservation.</b> However it is not publicly available. Considering the value of pollinators in agriculture and wild ecosystems, this large database of bumble bees will likely prove useful for investigations of the effects of anthropogenic activities on pollinator community composition and conservation status...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAbstract Across Europe {{conservation}} {{actions have}} been implemented to mitigate the decline of pollinators in agricultural landscapes. However, recent concerns have appeared about their efficiency to promote pollinator diversity. To increase the efficiency of these interventions, one must acquire a better knowledge of the target species diversity patterns and its sources of variations at different spatial and temporal scales. This study sets out to identify the main sources of variation in wild bee assemblages at a regional scale (450 km 2) in mass-flowering crops and semi-natural habitats. During three consecutive sampling years, we monitored bee diversity and its temporal and spatial turnovers. We show that an intensive agricultural landscape in western France can hold nearly 200 wild bee species at a regional scale, i. e. 20 % of the whole bee fauna known in mainland France. Wild bee diversity was 3 – 4 times lower in oleaginous crops than in semi-natural habitats, with {{a substantial number of}} these being social and gregarious species. Spatial and seasonal species turnover in semi-natural habitats explained 28. 6 and 34. 3 %, respectively, of regional species richness. Given the importance of the spatial component of the bee diversity turnover, we suggest wild <b>bee</b> <b>conservation</b> efforts should be carried out at relevant spatial scales. The spatial turnover was estimated to be steeper within 50 km 2 scales. This provides an order of magnitude for the spatial extent of relevant conservation units within which one may concentrate conservation efforts in order to optimise the number of species promoted per surface area...|$|E
40|$|Bee fauna and {{associated}} flora from a grassland site in Brazil, surveyed 40 and 20 years ago, were newly surveyed with comparable methodology to evaluate {{changes in the}} bee fauna of this site, considering that human population and urbanization has exponentially increased in the last 40 years. In general, bee species richness has declined in 22 %, {{as well as their}} abundance. Some of the previously abundant species are now absent, including Bombus bellicosus Smith, 1879, Gaesischia fulgurans (Holmberg, 1903) and Thectochlora basiatra (Strand, 1910). No particular trend of differential decrease among either taxonomic or functional groups was observed, except for a minor increase in the proportion of oligolectic species and a 50 % {{reduction in the number of}} large species. The first two surveys were more similar to each other in species richness per bee genus, while the two most recent grouped together based on measures of anthropogenic impact. Furthermore, the number of plant species visited by bees increased, with a pronounced increase in ruderal and exotic species. Crop cultivation, competition with honeybees and climate changes may all be related to bee decline. Nevertheless, the effects of urbanization, in particular intense land occupation and few preserved natural areas can be pointed as the main causes of species decline. Due to continuing increase in human population, increased erosion in diversity is expected. Habitat protection is an additional challenge to <b>bee</b> <b>conservation</b> in the region, with no local conservation units set aside for grasslands. State and municipal agencies should urgently consider the establishment of reserves for the few remaining patches of natural grasslands...|$|E
40|$|Science and {{politics}} are inextricably entwined. Scientists must understand how their political opinions sway {{the course of}} their research. Without this insight, scientists may unintentionally support political ideologies that they actually find morally reprehensible. Scientific thought aims to understand and harness services of the natural world. Feminist theory of science is a critical framework that rejects the inherent arrogance in this goal. Controlling nature is particularly pertinent in agricultural pollination, as farmers often rely on agrotechnology to sustain a single species of bee, honeybees, to pollinate all crops. Honeybees can be prohibitively expensive or complicated to maintain, so that some farmers can’t access this resource. The cultivation of wild bee communities for agricultural pollination is a feminist method of decreasing farmer’s reliance on honeybees. By cultivating wild bee habitat and forage, farmers can encourage sustainable and resilient pollination systems. Sustainability and resilience of ecosystem services are key feminist ideals. Feminists aim to construct methods of science that prioritize the conservation of natural ecosystems while addressing human needs. Human needs are especially important when they are voiced by groups of people who are systematically denied control over their own lives, based on their race, gender, class, sexuality, or other features of their identity. Ecologists often share these goals, so ecology is a prime field for exploring the overlap between scientific and feminist thought. Urban farms are an important space for combining <b>bee</b> <b>conservation,</b> ecological research, food access, and community involvement. By doing research and conservation on urban farms, scientists can accomplish the feminist goal of involving community members in scientific work to mutual benefit...|$|E
40|$|Habitat {{fragmentation}} {{can have}} severe effects on plant pollinator interactions, for example changing the foraging behaviour of pollinators. To date, {{the impact of}} plant population size on pollen collection by pollinators {{has not yet been}} investigated. From 2008 to 2010, we monitored nine bumble bee species (Bombus campestris, Bombus hortorum s. l., Bombus hypnorum, Bombus lapidarius, Bombus pascuorum, Bombus pratorum, Bombus soroensis, Bombus terrestris s. l., Bombus vestalis s. l.) on Vaccinium uliginosum (Ericaceae) in up to nine populations in Belgium ranging in size from 80 m 2 to over 3. 1 ha. Bumble bee abundance declined with decreasing plant population size, and especially the proportion of individuals of large bumble bee species diminished in smaller populations. The most remarkable and novel observation was that bumble bees seemed to switch foraging behaviour according to population size: while they collected both pollen and nectar in large populations, they largely neglected pollen collection in small populations. This pattern was due to large bumble bee species, which seem thus to be more likely to suffer from pollen shortages in smaller habitat fragments. Comparing pollen loads of bumble bees we found that fidelity to V. uliginosum pollen did not depend on plant population size but rather on the extent shrub cover and/or openness of the site. Bumble bees collected pollen only from three plant species (V. uliginosum, Sorbus aucuparia and Cytisus scoparius). We also did not discover any pollination limitation of V. uliginosum in small populations. We conclude that habitat fragmentation might not immediately threaten the pollination of V. uliginosum, nevertheless, it provides important nectar and pollen resources for bumble bees and declining populations of this plant could have negative effects for its pollinators. The finding that large bumble bee species abandon pollen collection when plant populations become small is of interest when considering plant and bumble <b>bee</b> <b>conservation.</b> © 2012 Mayer et al...|$|E

Foraging behaviors of bumble bee workers have been examined in natural habitats, whereas agricultural landscapes, which can provide insights on flight distances to fragmented patches of bloom, have received limited attention. In particular, information on worker flight distances to crops blooming several months after nests have been established is invaluable. Here, we examined foraging patterns of Bombus vosnesenskii Radoszkowski in late-season blooming clover in the agricultural-dominated Willamette Valley in Oregon. Workers from 10 fields collected over 2 yr were assigned to full sibling families (colonies) by using eight microsatellite loci. With estimation of numbers of unseen species, we inferred the presence of 189 colonies from 433 bees genotyped in year 1, and 144 from 296 genotyped the next year. Worker foraging distance was estimated to be at least 11. 6 km, half the distance between the most remote fields visited by the same colonies. Numbers of nests contributing workers to each field ranged from 15 to 163. Overall, 165 (50 %) colonies foraged in two or more fields, and thus used common resources within the landscape. Estimates of average nest densities in the landscape each year ranged from 0. 76 /km² to 22. 16 /km², and highlighted the influences of various study parameters incorporated into the calculation including sample size, distances between sites, and analytical tools used to estimate unsampled individuals. Based on the results, bumble bees can fly long distances, and this could facilitate their survival in fragmented agricultural landscapes. This has important implications for the scale of habitat management in bumble <b>bee</b> <b>conservation</b> programs...|$|E
40|$|Honey bee {{males and}} queens mate in mid air and can fly many {{kilometres}} on their nuptial flights. The conservation of native honey bees, {{such as the}} European black bee (Apis mellifera mellifera), therefore, requires large isolated areas to prevent hybridisation with other subspecies, such as A. m. ligustica or A. m. carnica, {{which may have been}} introduced by beekeepers. This study used DNA microsatellite markers to determine the mating range of A. m. mellifera in two adjacent semi-isolated valleys (Edale and Hope Valley) in the Peak District National Park, England, in order to assess their suitability for native honey <b>bee</b> <b>conservation</b> and as isolated mating locations. Three apiaries were set up in each valley, each containing 12 colonies headed by a virgin queen and 2 queenright drone producing hives. The virgin queens were allowed to mate naturally with drones from the hives we had set up and with drones from hives owned by local beekeepers. After mating, samples of worker larvae were taken from the 41 queens that mated successfully and genotyped at 11 DNA microsatellite loci. Paternity analyses were then carried out to determine mating distances and isolation. An average of 10. 2 fathers were detected among the 16 worker progeny. After correction for non-detection and non-sampling errors, the mean effective mating frequency of the test queens was estimated to be 17. 2, which is a normal figure for honey bees. Ninety percent of the matings occurred within a distance of 7. 5 km, and fifty percent within 2. 5 km. The maximal mating distance recorded was 15 km. Queens and drones did occasionally mate across the borders between the two valleys, showing that the dividing mountain ridge Losehill does not provide complete isolation. Nevertheless, in the most isolated part of Edale sixty percent of all matings were to drones from Edale hives. The large majority of observed mating distances fell within the range of Hope Valley, making this site a suitable location for the long term conservation of a breeding population of black bees...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} genetic {{population}} structure {{is a central}} issue in evolutionary biology because it determines the distributional pattern and amount of genetic variation that is available for evolution within a species. Therefore, species adaptability to environmental change operates within the constraints imposed by population structure. Bees have recently {{become the focus of}} conservation concern due to the increasing evidence of population declines worldwide drawing attention to the ecological and economic consequences of pollinator loss. Results from multiple studies have identified three major drivers of bee decline: (1) Environmental stressors, including habitat loss and pesticide exposure; (2) Pests and pathogens; and (3) Loss of genetic diversity. Despite its importance, the levels and distribution of genetic diversity remain poorly understood in bees. Here, I investigate the patterns of genetic diversity in five solitary bee species to understand how climate, crop domestication and landscape features drive changes in bee population demography and genetic structure. I developed de novo genetic markers and spatial models for all species, to determine how populations are structured and connected through gene flow at different geographic scales. I find evidence that changes in climatic conditions, range shifts in host-plants due to crop domestication, and the distribution of suitable nesting sites are important predictors of levels of genetic diversity and population structure in solitary bees. My results reveal that male-biased dispersal may be common in bees and the production of high frequencies of sterile diploid males are not a necessary outcome of populations with low genetic variability. I also provide evidence that drier climates, tillage and low-density of suitable nesting areas may diminish bee population abundance. In summary, I find that investigating patterns of genetic variability in bees using molecular tools provides significant insights into how environmental stressors affected past and current population demography.
