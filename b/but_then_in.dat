5|$|On 23 February 1915, a Court of Inquiry was held, {{at first}} meeting in {{confidence}} <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>in</b> public sessions. It prepared a 450-page report dated 15 May 1915. Although extensive discord amongst both officers and {{men of the}} 5th Light Infantry was identified, {{the cause of the}} mutiny was not conclusively established. The focus of the report was on possible external German influences, plus internal regimental causes of the mutiny.|$|E
5|$|After 1143 the war ground on, but {{progressing}} {{slightly better}} for Stephen. Miles of Gloucester, {{one of the}} most talented Angevin commanders, had died whilst hunting over the previous Christmas, relieving some of the pressure in the west. Geoffrey de Mandeville's rebellion continued until September 1144, when he died during an attack on Burwell. The war in the west progressed better in 1145, with the King recapturing Faringdon Castle in Oxfordshire. In the north, Stephen came to a fresh agreement with Ranulf of Chester, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>in</b> 1146 repeated the ruse he had played on Geoffrey de Mandeville in 1143, first inviting Ranulf to court, before arresting him and threatening to execute him unless he handed over a number of castles, including Lincoln and Coventry. As with Geoffrey, the moment Ranulf was released he immediately rebelled, but the situation was a stalemate: Stephen had few forces in the north with which to prosecute a fresh campaign, whilst Ranulf lacked the castles to support an attack on Stephen. By this point, however, Stephen's practice of inviting barons to court and arresting them had brought him into some disrepute and increasing distrust.|$|E

5|$|Anglo-Saxons kings {{produced}} coins {{from the}} 620s onwards, initially in gold, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>in</b> electrum (an alloy {{of gold and}} silver) and eventually pure silver. Little is known of the organisation of coinage {{during the reign of}} Beonna, but it can be presumed that the moneyers who struck coins during this period acted {{under the auspices of the}} king, who would to some extent have supervised the design of his coins. A growing shortage of available bullion in north-western Europe during the first half of the 8th century was probably the main cause for a deterioration in the proportion of precious metal found in locally produced sceattas. In around 740, Eadberht of Northumbria became the first king to respond to this crisis by issuing a remodelled coinage, of a consistent weight and a high proportion of silver, which eventually replaced the debased currency. Other kings followed his example, including Beonna and the Frankish king Pepin the Short, who appears to have been strongly influenced by the newly introduced coins of both Beonna and Eadberht.|$|E
5|$|One {{innovation}} of the Rokeby Venus, {{when compared}} to other large single nude paintings, {{lies in the fact that}} Velázquez depicts a back view of its subject who is turned away from the viewer. There were precedents for this in prints by Giulio Campagnola, Agostino Veneziano, Hans Sebald Beham and Theodor de Bry, as well as classical sculptures known to Velázquez, of which casts were made for Madrid. These were the Sleeping Ariadne now in the Pitti Palace, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>in</b> Rome, of which Velázquez ordered a cast for the Royal collection in 1650–51, and the Borghese Hermaphroditus, a sleeping hermaphrodite (picture to the right above), now in the Louvre, of which a cast was sent to Madrid, and which also emphasises the curve from hip to waist. However, the combination of elements in Velázquez's composition was original.|$|E

25|$|For {{the next}} couple of years, trade was all the French did, <b>but</b> <b>then,</b> <b>in</b> 1785, the {{business}} changed hands.

25|$|In 1951, French Meccano {{has been}} the first post-war European {{manufacturer}} to introduce 1:43 scale. Initially, the scales of French Dinky Toys {{were similar to those}} of English Dinkys. The Citroën Traction Avant (24N), released in 1949, was 1:48, while the Ford Vedette 1949 (24Q), released in 1950, was 1:45, the same scales as used in the British 40 series. <b>But</b> <b>then,</b> <b>in</b> 1946 Meccano France released their first car in 1:43 scale: the Jeep (24M) (Dinky Toys Encyclopaedia).|$|E
25|$|The day {{following}} the opening event, a regular five return journeys per day, Monday to Saturday, was instituted.

It took the trains 15 minutes to run the 5½ miles including the conditional stops at Linksfield Level Crossing and Greens of Drainie. These stops were abandoned in 1859.|$|E

25|$|The next year, with Jenkins {{moving to}} Boston, the 37-year-old Perry became the staff ace, winning 15 games against 14 defeats.

25|$|After the war, Meyer {{resumed his}} prewar pattern of late summer home games in 1946, <b>but</b> <b>then,</b> <b>in</b> 1947, {{at the age}} of 42, allowed himself his solitary season of {{full-time}} cricket as Somerset's captain. By this stage, he was badly affected by lumbago, and though he scored 850 runs and took 43 wickets, the season was not a success for Somerset, and he stood {{down at the end of}} the year. He played a couple of first-class matches in each of the next three seasons, and then retired from cricket to concentrate full-time on schoolmastering and developing his school at Millfield.|$|E
25|$|In 1940, {{cartoonist}} Dick Briefer {{wrote and}} drew a Frankenstein's-monster comic book title for Crestwood Publications's Prize Comics, beginning with a standard horrific version, updated to contemporary America, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>in</b> 1945 crafting an acclaimed and well-remembered comedic version that spun off into his own title, Frankenstein Comics. The series ended with issue #17 (Jan.-Feb. 1949, but was revived as a horror title from #18-33 (March 1952 - Oct.-Nov. 1954). The original Prize version served as catalyst for an intra-company crossover, where all characters starring in Prize Comics at the time teamed up to fight Frankenstein.|$|E
