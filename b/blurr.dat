While shutting down an Energon-mining operation, they incite a riot by beating an outspoken miner to death. The riot is extinguished, {{resulting in the}} miners either dead or imprisoned. A surviving miner, Megatron, manages {{to take over a}} prison shuttle and hide it in Kaon, the seediest city on Cybertron. Megatron makes a name for himself in the underground gladiatorial matches, learning to enjoy the kill. He recruits the Seekers, Soundwave, and the future Cassetticons to perform acts of terrorism throughout Cybertron. Megatron rallies a large group of gladiators and proposes for them to unite under the same badge, but they are caught and arrested by Sentinel Prime's police force. However, this is part of Megatron's plan, as Starscream kills the Autobot Senate. Megatron kills Sentinel Prime, and the newly forged Decepticons take over the city-state of Kaon, heralding the beginning of the war. The populace at large is distracted by mass sports race games, with racers like the arrogant but talented <b>Blurr</b> becoming celebrities. Early on during the war, both Autobot and Decepticon try to recruit <b>Blurr</b> to their cause, with a young Optimus talking <b>Blurr</b> into saving the life of Zeta Prime from Starscream's assassination squad. A rookie Tracks is saved from the elite Predacons by special ops soldier Jazz. In later years, Tracks passes on the story of the lone Autobot to boost morale in times of crisis.|$|E

After a rescue raid led by Hot Rod results in Ironhide's death, Optimus Prime gives up {{his position as}} leader and surrenders to Skywatch, causing a schism between the Autobots, who split into two groups: one led by Hot Rod, who, taking the name [...] "Rodimus", joins forces {{with a group of}} Decepticons fronted by Swindle in an effort to build a ship and leave the planet, and a second who elect Bumblebee as their new leader, and are soon joined by Ultra Magnus, who determines to arrest Rodimus for treason. More Autobots, fearing they will be arrested by Magnus, also go AWOL, but most of them are captured by Skywatch and used as a bargaining tool by Spike Witwicky to force information out of Optimus Prime. Thundercracker, having been shot down by Skywarp three years previously, starts to develop admiration for Earth and its inhabitants. Although Bumblebee was elected as Autobot leader, he gets little respect, as Autobots strike out on their own or disrespect his authority. A rogue faction within Skywatch contacts the Autobots and sets up a meeting with Bumblebee to enlist the Autobots' help in capturing Decepticons. Bumblebee agrees and the bots are fitted with special badges to cloak them from the main Skywatch force, but when the Colonel orders the capture of <b>Blurr</b> and resentment ensues, the Autobots learn that the badges also have the ability to immobilize them. Meanwhile, Magnus arrives at Hot Rod's camp and attempts to capture Swindle, but is stopped by Hot Rod. He also fails in trying to get Hot Rod to disassemble the ship his party is building to get off Earth. In the battle that follows, Swindle betrays Rodimus and reveals his new creation, Menasor, but the day is saved thanks to Skywatch, with whom Optimus Prime has brokered an alliance, and some timely side-switching from the disillusioned Thundercracker. The disgraced Rodimus flees Earth alone, and the Autobots rally under Bumblebee.|$|E

This paper focuses on the communicational dimension of democratic accountability in metropolitan governance, by exploring the role of the media.

We find that institutional differences in metropolitan governance are quite adequately reflected in media reports. The results also show that media content indeed is correlated with citizen perceptions of legitimacy, i. e. trust in government as well as satisfaction with democracy. We therefore interpret the media as an additional - communicational – channel of democratic accountability in metropolitan governance...|$|R

I say again, that no men upon this earth could have fought more manfully than the French did upon that day.|$|E

40|$|This article aims mainly at {{revealing}} the spiritual sense o f the pericope according to {{wording of the}} Papal Biblical Commission: the spiritual sense conceived according to Christian faith, as sense expressed through biblical texts, when they are read under the influence o f Holy Spirit in the context o f paschal mystery o f Christ and the new life springing from it. JHWH is expressed in the words: It is not good fo r the man to be fo r himself (Gen. 2, 18 a). In BHS there is a particle of purpose 19, for, in purpose of, overlooked by exegetes in a Hebrew word hbaddó, consisting of a particle of purpose 19, a noun bad = separation, a part of, and a pronoun suffix 6. That is why the standard translation of this verse should be changed (istead to be alone, for to be fo r himself). ‘The man-Adam, being alone, not having any relation to anybody else, was not yet image o f God’ (Kiemikowski), because ‘God is love’ in {{the relation of the}} three divine persons, and because it is said in Gn 1, 27 that woman and man were created together in God«s image and the word 3 àdam means both man and woman (1, 26). The deepest carrier of the message of the pericope is the verb banah - built, occuring here in the form of wajjiqtol wayylben. It is full of meaning that the theme of God as a builder or an architect in himself appears in the exile or post-exile texts Is 45, 13; 62, 5; lKgs 11, 39; Jer 5, 5 n; 31, 2 - 6; Ez 36, 33 - 38; Ps 102, 17; 127, 1; 147, 2. Biblical authors use a verb ״bnh”- to build because a conception and birth o f the man was always related to activity of God who ‘was building’ man in his mother's womb (Gn 16, 2; 30, 5; Ps 139, 13), who was building a dynasty (2 Sm 7, 27; 1 Kgs 17, 25), and consequently he was building the nation and the state, (cf. Ex 1, 21 Dt 25, 9). The following conlusions result from this article: 1. The key to understanding the pericope is the allusion of the verse Gn 2, 23 a to the formula of the covenant (W. Briiggemann), which does not say about origin o f the woman in a biological sense. Exegetical tradition interpreting the text as supposedly saying about the biological origin of the woman is based on familiarization of the word ‘rib’ and with inappropriate play of words in 23 b, which <b>blurrs</b> and misinterpretes the meaning of the text. While the main intention of the text is to emphasize solidarity o f man and woman and their mutual responsibilty for each other and for the world. 2. This solidarity is mutual but it refers both to cultivating soil - 3 àdàmàh (3 iSSah - 5 adama 11) and to observing the Law of the covenant. 3. Image of God and his bride Israel is close to the prophets. That is why Gn 2, 18 - 24 refers to the teachings of the prophets about the covenant (H. Renckens), especially to Hos 1 - 3; Ez 16 i 23; Deutero- i Trito-Isaiah. This image was presented both in terms of infidelity and restored relations of the covenant. The metaphor o f marriage says about the covenant of God with Israel. However, on basis of Gn 2, 23 a it is clear that this marriage is not a more personal or auxiliary image of the covenant but speaks directly about permanent relations which last between God and Israel in weal and woe, in weakness and power, in faithfulness and infidelity. 4. The same imagery is used by St. Paul in Eph 5, 21 - 33. The relation between Christ and Church was built on the community o f fate, loyalty and responsibility which has a guarantee to survive in any lot. Christ and Church are one body. This is a formula of the covenant repeated by Paul from Gn 2, 24. The words of St. Paul His purpose fo r dying fo r all was that men, while still in life, should cease to live fo r themselves, and and should live fo r him, who fo r their sake died and was raised to life (2 C 0 r 5, 15) are found as a prolongation of Gn 2, 18 It is not good fo r the man to be fo r himself. 5. The text does not suggest any superiority o f male element over female or justifies sexual intercourses since such a problem did not exist in Israel. Marriage was based on community of fate, loyalty and commitment which ought to be treated seriously. It is neither light nor accidental, grounded on mood or feeling. It is based on an oath of solidarity. Its general aim is not to find mutual joy, though not excluded, but it is the job of cultivating soil and obeying the Law of the covenant.
