In {{order to}} {{reasonably}} match suspension stiffness and realize the optimization of vehicle ride comfort, a time-domain virtual prototyping {{model of the}} 8 × 4 heavy vehicle is established based on dynamic software ADAMS, and its vertical vibration responses are simulated and analyzed on road level B. After that, an optimal design method for heavy vehicle’s suspension system is put forward. In this proposed method, the first, the second axle suspension stiffness and the <b>balance</b> <b>suspension</b> stiffness are taken as the optimal variables and the maximum values of Z-direction power spectral density (PSD) of the cab and cargo boxes mass center are chosen as the optimal target. By using SQP (Sequential Quadratic Programming) algorithms to conduct optimizing calculation, thus the optimal suspension stiffness parameters are obtained, which promotes and improves the heavy vehicle’s ride comfort...|$|E
40|$|The {{heavy vehicle}} brings large dynamic loads {{to the road}} surface, which would reduce vehicle ride comfort and shorten road service life. The {{structure}} characteristic of heavy vehicle suspension has {{a significant impact on}} vehicle performance. Based on the D'Alembert principle, the dynamics models of independent and integral <b>balanced</b> <b>suspension</b> are proposed considering mass and inertia of balancing rod. The sprung mass acceleration and the tire dynamic force for two kinds of <b>balanced</b> <b>suspension</b> and the traditional quarter vehicle model are compared in frequency-domain and time-domain respectively. It is concluded that a quarter vehicle model simplified for <b>balanced</b> <b>suspension</b> could be used to evaluate the ride comfort of vehicle well, but it has some limitations in assessing the vehicle road-friendliness. Then, the sprung mass acceleration and the road damage coefficients are also analyzed under different vehicle design and running parameters at detail. Some conclusions are obtained: low suspension stiffness, high suspension damping and low tire stiffness are all favorable to improve vehicle performance; there is a saturation range of suspension damping enhancing vehicle performance; improving the road surface roughness and avoiding the no-load running are two effective methods to accomplish the better ride comfort and road-friendliness. The suspension stiffness and damping parameters are chosen for optimal parameters matching of road friendliness based on the approximation optimization method...|$|R

40|$|A {{hierarchy}} of models and {{results are presented}} for the simulation of the dynamics and deposition of concentrated turbidity currents. The turbidity flows {{are assumed to be}} two-dimensional due to a constant flux release of dense suspensions spreading over a nonerodible flat surface. The three models presented are the <b>Suspension</b> <b>Balance</b> Model (SBM), the Simplified <b>Suspension</b> <b>Balance</b> Model (SSBM) and the Vertically Averaged Simplified <b>Suspension</b> <b>Balance</b> Model (VASSBM). The SBM is computationally intensive. However, simulations of the SBM indicate that the only a subset of the terms in the equations for the SBM are significant. The VASSBM is significantly faster computationally, and it is shown here to be an accurate approximation of the SBM model. For all the models, the two parameters that determine the dynamics and deposition of a concentrated turbidity current due to a constant flux release are the inlet volume fraction and the buoyancy number, a ratio of the buoyancy forces to viscous forces acting on the current. A parameter study is conducted for a volume fraction ranging from 10 to 40 % and buoyancy numbers ranging from 0. 01 to 0. 2, typical of many real concentrated turbidity flows. It is found that the length or extent of deposit is mostly determined by inlet volume fraction and is relatively insensitive to the buoyancy number. The converse, though, is found for the thickness of the deposit...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} a fundamental {{discrepancy between the}} <b>suspension</b> <b>balance</b> model and other two-phase flow formulations. The former was proposed to capture the shear-induced migration of particles in Stokesian suspensions, and hinges {{on the presence of}} a particle phase stress to drive particle migration. This stress is taken to be the " particle stress, " defined as the particle contribution to the suspension stress. On the other hand, the two-phase flow equations derived in several studies show only a force acting on the particle phase, but no stress. We show that the identification of the particle phase stress with the particle contribution to the suspension stress in the <b>suspension</b> <b>balance</b> model is incorrect, but there exists a well-defined particle phase stress. Following the rigorous method of volume averaging, we show that the force on the particle phase may be written as the sum of an interphase drag and the divergence of the particle phase stress. We derive exact micromechanical relations for these quantities. We also comment on the interpretations and results of previous studies that are based on the identification of the particle phase stress with the particle contribution to the suspension stress...|$|R

A previous colloidal characterisation allowed concentrated suspensions (~ 40 wt%) to be prepared. These suspensions were then successfully deposited by suspension plasma spraying (SPS) onto stainless steel substrates at different spraying distances. Coatings were characterised in terms of microstructure and mechanical properties (hardness and elastic modulus) by nanoindentation. All coatings displayed a two-zone microstructure formed by partially melted areas containing nanometre or submicrometre-sized particles surrounded by fully melted areas. These partially melted areas strongly increased as standoff distance lengthened. Mechanical properties worsened with spraying distance increase. The finer the feedstock particle size the more the spraying distance effect was. A clear correlation between mechanical properties and amount of partially melted areas has been proved.

40|$|When {{dispersed}} colloids are flowing, {{they experience}} {{interactions with the}} fluid (friction) and with other colloids (surface interactions). These phenomena are usually taken into account through a <b>Suspension</b> <b>Balance</b> Model (SBM) that couples mass and momentum balances. However, in many applications, the dispersed particles flow close to an interface or inside a porous media. The flow in such a confined environment leads to significant particle-wall interactions. This paper puts forward an energy map model that accounts for these particle-wall interactions. A way to implement the energy map in the SBM is to introduce an interfacial pressure concept. The new possibilities opened up by the energy map that account for interfacial interaction in the SBM are analysed. A transient 1 D case study for the transfer of colloids through a pore illustrates the potentialities of the <b>Suspension</b> <b>Balance</b> Model integrating an Energy Map (SBM-EM). The model enables {{the description of the}} transmission of the colloids through the energy map representing the membrane (mass balance) and the consequences in terms of an out-of-equilibrium counter pressure (momentum balance). The counter osmotic pressure is then explained by the interfacial interaction between the colloids and the interface; these interfacial interactions that prevents the colloids from leaving the bulk volume generate forces that are transmitted to the fluid (via the drag force), thus inducing osmosis. The energy map model can enable the incorporation of the physical and chemical heterogeneities of the interacting surfaces.
