5|$|Important {{information}} could be gained regarding {{the properties of}} superheavy nuclei by the synthesis of more livermorium isotopes, specifically those with a few neutrons {{more or less than}} the known ones – 286Lv, 287Lv, 288Lv, 289Lv, 294Lv, and 295Lv. This is possible <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> reasonably long-lived isotopes of curium {{that can be used to}} make a target. The light isotopes can be made by fusing curium-243 with calcium-48. They would undergo a chain of alpha decays, ending at transactinide isotopes that are too light to achieve by hot fusion and too heavy to be produced by cold fusion.|$|E
5|$|Philosophy of {{chemistry}} is the philosophical {{study of the}} methodology {{and content of the}} science {{of chemistry}}. It is explored by philosophers, chemists, and philosopher-chemist teams. It includes research on general philosophy of science issues as applied to chemistry. For example, can all chemical phenomena be explained by quantum mechanics or is it not possible to reduce chemistry to physics? For another example, chemists have discussed the philosophy of how theories are confirmed in the context of confirming reaction mechanisms. Determining reaction mechanisms is difficult because they cannot be observed directly. Chemists can use a number of indirect measures as evidence to rule out certain mechanisms, but they are often unsure if the remaining mechanism is correct <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> other possible mechanisms that they have not tested or even thought of. Philosophers have also sought to clarify the meaning of chemical concepts which do not refer to specific physical entities, such as chemical bonds.|$|E
25|$|According to Henri Omont, palaeographer, it is {{impossible}} to give precise date to this manuscript on the palaeographical ground, <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> manuscripts written in that way, but they are not dated. The 9th century is possible as well as the 11th century.|$|E

25|$|Players {{traditionally}} learn old-time {{music by}} ear; even musicians who can read music. A broad selection of written music does exist, although {{many believe that}} the style of old-time music cannot be practically notated by written music. This is in part <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> regional and local variations to old-time tunes, and {{because some of the}} most noted players often improvised and wouldn't play a tune exactly the same way every time.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis of {{a balance}} {{disorder}} is complicated <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> kinds of balance disorders and because other medical conditions—including ear infections, blood pressure changes, and some vision problems—and some medications {{may contribute to}} a balance disorder. A person experiencing dizziness should see a physiotherapist or physician for an evaluation. A physician can assess for a medical disorder, such as a stroke or infection, if indicated. A physiotherapist can assess balance or a dizziness disorder and provide specific treatment.|$|E
25|$|These Bloch {{wave energy}} eigenstates are written with {{subscripts}} as ψn k, where n is a discrete index, called the band index, which is present <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> different Bloch waves {{with the same}} k (each has a different periodic component u). Within a band (i.e., for fixed n), ψn k varies continuously with k, as does its energy. Also, for any reciprocal lattice vector K, ψn k = ψn,(k+K). Therefore, all distinct Bloch waves occur for k-values within the first Brillouin zone of the reciprocal lattice.|$|E

25|$|Because ethanol {{contains}} {{close to}} 34% less energy per unit volume than gasoline, E85 FFVs {{have a lower}} mileage per gallon than gasoline. However, this lower energy content does not translate directly into a 34% reduction in miles per U.S. gallon, <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> other variables that affect {{the performance of a}} particular fuel in a particular engine, though for E85 the effect becomes significant. E85 will produce lower mileage than gasoline, and actual performance may vary depending on the vehicle. Based on EPA EPA-rated mileage for all 2006 E85 models, the average fuel economy for E85 vehicles was 25.56% lower than unleaded gasoline. When making price comparisons it has to be considered that E85 has octane rating of about 104 and {{could be used as a}} substitute for premium gasoline.|$|E
500|$|Biofuel {{development}} and use is a complex issue <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> biofuel options which are available. [...] Biofuels, such as ethanol and biodiesel, are currently produced from the products of conventional food crops such as the starch, sugar and oil feedstocks from crops that include wheat, maize, sugar cane, palm oil and oilseed rape. Some researchers fear that a major switch to biofuels from such crops would create a direct competition with their use for food and animal feed, and claim that {{in some parts of}} the world the economic consequences are already visible, other researchers look at the land available and the enormous areas of idle and abandoned land and claim that there is room for a large proportion of biofuel also from conventional crops.|$|E

2500|$|Japanese {{names are}} usually written in kanji. <b>Because</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> {{possible}} readings for kanji names, including special name-only readings called nanori, furigana {{are often used}} to give the readings of names. On Japanese official forms, where the name is to be written, there is [...] always an adjacent column for the name to be written in furigana. Usually katakana is preferred.|$|E
2500|$|Software {{that aids}} in {{creating}} crossword puzzles {{has been written}} since at least 1976; one popular example was Crossword Magic for the Apple II in the 1980s. The earliest software relied on people to input a list of fill words and clues, and automatically maps the answers onto a suitable grid. [...] This is a search problem in computer science <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> possible arrangements to be checked against the rules of construction. Any given set of answers might have zero, one, or multiple legal arrangements.|$|E

2500|$|It can {{be shown}} that the B-valued [...] {{relations}} ||∈|| and ||=|| on VB make VB into a Boolean-valued model of set theory. Each sentence of first order set theory with no free variables has a truth value in B; it must be shown that the axioms for equality and all the axioms of ZF set theory (written without free variables) have truth value 1 (the largest element of B). This proof is straightforward, but it is long <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> different axioms {{that need to be}} checked.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, most Jewish-Orthodox {{scholars}} reject any {{attempts to}} build the Temple before the coming of Messiah. This is <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> doubts as to the exact location {{in which it is}} required to be built. For example, while measurements are given in cubits, there exists a controversy whether this unit of measurement equals approximately [...] or [...] Without exact knowledge of the size of a cubit, the altar could not be built. Indeed, the Talmud recounts that the building of the second Temple was only possible under the direct prophetic guidance of Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi. Without valid prophetic revelation, {{it would be impossible to}} rebuild the Temple, even if the mosques no longer occupied its location.|$|E
2500|$|Linguists have {{attempted}} to isolate exactly what makes gay men's language {{different from that of}} their heterosexual counterparts. [...] This is a difficult process, <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> variations within gay and straight male groups. [...] Within each group, there is a wide range of speech that might be categorized as more masculine or feminine, and furthermore, these gender descriptors do not comprehensively describe the range of vocal characteristics. [...] It is also difficult to isolate markers of gay speech, since the gay community consists of many smaller groups that make up a diverse subculture. [...] Categorizing leather daddies, drag queens, circuit boys, gay prostitutes, activists, and “straight-acting” males as one linguistically homogenous group would obviously be an inaccurate portrayal of the gay male community.|$|E
50|$|In 1943, {{the good}} Neighbourhood Police Force was seen {{policing}} Edmonton's streets. An Edmonton police officer was paired {{up with an}} American Military police officer to patrol <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>many</b> Americans in Edmonton at the time.

2500|$|Acoustics. This system {{consists}} {{of one or}} more transponders placed on the seabed and a transducer placed in the ship's hull. The transducer sends an acoustic signal (by means of piezoelectric elements) to the transponder, which is triggered to reply. As the velocity of sound through water is known (preferably a soundprofile is taken regularly), the distance is known. <b>Because</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> elements on the transducer, the direction of the signal from the transponder can be determined. Now the position of the ship relative to the transponder can be calculated. Disadvantages are the vulnerability to noise by thrusters or other acoustic systems. The use is limited in shallow waters because of ray bending that occurs when sound travels through water horizontally. Three types of HPR systems are commonly used: ...|$|E
2500|$|The hardest {{passwords}} to crack, {{for a given}} {{length and}} character set, are random character strings; if long enough they resist brute force attacks (<b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> characters) and guessing attacks (due to high entropy). However, such passwords are typically the hardest to remember. The imposition of a requirement for such passwords in a password policy may encourage users to write them down, store them in PDAs or cellphones, or share them with others as a safeguard against memory failure. While some people consider each of these user resorts to increase security risks, others suggest the absurdity of expecting users to remember distinct complex passwords {{for each of the}} dozens of accounts they access. For example, in 2005, security expert Bruce Schneier recommended writing down one's password: ...|$|E
2500|$|Removal of both breasts {{before any}} cancer has been {{diagnosed}} or any suspicious lump or other lesion has appeared (a procedure known as prophylactic bilateral mastectomy) {{may be considered}} in people with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, which {{are associated with a}} substantially heightened risk for an eventual diagnosis of breast cancer. Evidence is not strong enough to support this procedure in anyone but those at the highest risk. BRCA testing is recommended in those with a high family risk after genetic counseling. It is not recommended routinely. [...] This is <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> forms of changes in BRCA genes, ranging from harmless polymorphisms to obviously dangerous frameshift mutations. [...] The effect of most of the identifiable changes in the genes is uncertain. [...] Testing in an average-risk person is particularly likely to return one of these indeterminate, useless results. It is unclear if removing the second breast in those who have breast cancer in one is beneficial.|$|E
5000|$|In 1922, the {{government}} issued {{a series of}} 19 stamps inscribed [...] "TANGANYIKA", featuring {{the head of a}} giraffe, denominated in cents, shillings and pounds (100 cents to a shilling, 20 shillings to a pound), with several colour changes in 1925.
