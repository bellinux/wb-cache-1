500|$|Prior to its {{theatrical}} release, the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) certified {{the film}} with a UA certificate after demanding a few cuts, {{due to a}} high proportion of violence present in the film. Explaining the certificate, Pankaja Thakur, CEO of CBFC stated, [...] " [...] Agneepath has a lot of bloodshed <b>but</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> felt disturbed by it. The violence is not the type that can psychologically damage a child and the softer scenes of the film managed to offset the darker part of it". The film's posters subsequently featured disclaimers reading, [...] "This film is certified U/A. We advise parental guidance due to violence in the film." [...] The board, consequently praised Johar for the step.|$|E

2500|$|In some cases, the Confederates forced their African American {{slaves to}} fire upon U.S. {{soldiers}} at gunpoint, {{such as at}} the first Battle of Bull Run. According to John Parker, one such slave who was forced by the Confederates to fight U.S. soldiers, [...] "Our masters tried all they could to make us fight... They promised to give us our freedom and money besides, <b>but</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> believed them; we only fought because we had to." [...] Parker stated that had he been given an opportunity, he would have turned against his Confederate captors, and [...] "could do it with pleasure". According to abolitionist Henry Highland Garnet in 1862, he had met a slave who [...] "had unwillingly fought {{on the side of}} Rebellion", but said slave had since defected to [...] "the side of Union and universal liberty." ...|$|E

6000|$|Now let us {{see what}} the {{philosophers}} say. Note that venerable proverb: Children and fools always speak the truth. The deduction is plain --adults and wise persons never speak it. Parkman, the historian, says, [...] "The principle of truth may itself be carried into an absurdity." [...] In another place in the same chapters he says, [...] "The saying is old that truth should not be spoken at all times; and those whom a sick conscience worries into habitual violation of the maxim are imbeciles and nuisances." [...] It is strong language, <b>but</b> true. <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> could live with an habitual truth-teller; <b>but</b> thank goodness <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> has to. An habitual truth-teller is simply an impossible creature; he does not exist; he never has existed. Of course {{there are people who}} think they never lie, but it is not so--and this ignorance is one of the very things that shame our so-called civilization. Everybody lies--every day; every hour; awake; asleep; in his dreams; in his joy; in his mourning; if he keeps his tongue still, his hands, his feet, his eyes, his attitude, will convey deception--and purposely. Even in sermons--but that is a platitude.|$|R

"I {{have never}} seen the horrid animals," [...] {{returned}} the white cat; [...] "but there is a tradition in the Valley {{that some of our}} forefathers found mice here at one time and quickly destroyed them.

"This {{is one of}} the few {{laws which}} cannot be broken for favour or for gold, since the people, who are already half-mad with fear of Ithobal, believe that to break it would bring the curses of heaven upon their city.

Eric eventually ran out of patience and said, ‘Well, I’ll do it myself then.’ He sent us bits and songs and all that and we said, ‘Yeah, that's all right, have a go.’ But its success is so enormous that it took us all by surprise, including Eric, and now we’re just proud {{to be associated with}} it, rather pathetically." ...|$|R

Miss Hacket is a regular old dear, <b>but</b> we <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> can bear Miss Constance, except that mamma says we ought to be sorry for her because she leads such a confined life.

60|$|The {{walls of}} the chancel are of porcelain, all pictured over with figures of almost life size, very elegantly wrought and dressed in the fanciful costumes of two centuries ago.

2500|$|In a 2011 {{reference}} to the cancelled Studio 60, Aaron Sorkin appeared in [...] "Plan B", a fifth-season episode of 30 Rock; he played himself, depicted as looking for work alongside an also-struggling Liz Lemon. He refers to his achievements, such as The West Wing and The Social Network, but when Liz Lemon mentions Studio 60, he quickly replies, [...] "Shut up!" [...] During the March 2012 promotion of Bent, an NBC romantic comedy series starring Amanda Peet, Peet commented on what the issue was with Studio 60, saying it was [...] "too expensive and {{there was too much}} anticipation.

60|$|Our indignation was not loud, but deep.
