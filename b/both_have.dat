5|$|Although {{protactinium}} {{is located}} in the periodic table between uranium and thorium, which <b>both</b> <b>have</b> numerous applications, owing to its scarcity, high radioactivity and high toxicity, there are currently no uses for protactinium outside of scientific research.|$|E
5|$|Chloroacetone turns brown-orange {{when exposed}} to light, while ethyl bromoacetate is a yellow liquid at {{tropical}} outdoor temperatures. <b>Both</b> <b>have</b> similar colors to the liquid used on the demonstrators. Some varieties of French tear gas contained phosgene oxime or hydrogen cyanide. These two chemicals can be fatal, {{but none of the}} protestors in this incident died.|$|E

5|$|Eyre {{is thought}} to have been passing through the Toolinna Cove sand patch at the time of writing. B.epica and B.media are the only Banksia species that occur at that location, and <b>both</b> <b>have</b> a form and habit that accords with Eyre's description. As he did not collect specimens, it is {{impossible}} to determine what species he saw.|$|E
5|$|Federico Altieri began {{seeking to}} secure {{election}} to the papacy for himself. He had sought to <b>both</b> <b>have</b> a public persona favourable to Leopold I, while also working to curry the favour of Louis XIV.

[...] <b>Both</b> <b>had</b> triangular tailplanes, carrying elevators that were rectangular apart for a cut-out for rudder movement, though the Prüfling's tailplane was more strongly swept and was broader in chord.|$|R
60|$|Nelly sat thinking. This {{then was}} the reason why she had never {{attracted}} Jack.

No wonder Jack had thought {{of her as a}} comrade rather than as a possible wife; while Harry, gentler and easily led, patient rather than firm, leaned upon her strong nature.|$|R

5|$|In Vietnam, confiscated pygmy lorises {{are usually}} {{taken to the}} Endangered Primate Rescue Centre in Cúc Phương National Park, to be reintroduced into the wild. Non-experts may find it {{difficult}} to distinguish between the pygmy slow loris and the Sunda slow loris, as <b>both</b> <b>have</b> similarly reddish fur, which is variable in colors. In international shipments, pygmy lorises may be even mixed up with pottos or lemurs.|$|E

5|$|In the Margaret River region, Banksia ilicifolia {{has been}} {{confused}} with Banksia sessilis var. cordata as <b>both</b> <b>have</b> prickly foliage and domed flowerheads. However, the former grows on deep sand {{while the latter}} grows on grey sand over limestone ridges. The embedded follicles of B. ilicifolia compared with the loose ones of B. sessilis are another distinguishing feature.|$|E
5|$|On {{the eastern}} side of the pyramid, the ruins of a small {{satellite}} pyramid as well as of a mortuary temple have been discovered. <b>Both</b> <b>have</b> been heavily affected by stone robbing, which started as early as the New Kingdom and reached a climax during the Saite (664–525 BCE) and Persian (525–402 BCE) periods, making a modern reconstruction of the temple layout impossible.|$|E

5|$|Spaying or neutering {{increases}} life expectancy: {{one study}} found neutered male cats live {{twice as long as}} intact males, while spayed female cats live 62% longer than intact females.
