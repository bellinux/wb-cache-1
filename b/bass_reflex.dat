5|$|As the {{efficiency}} {{is proportional to}} Fs3, small improvements in low frequency extension with the same driver and box volume will result in very significant reductions in efficiency. For these reasons, subwoofers are typically very inefficient at converting electrical energy into sound energy. This combination of factors accounts for the higher amplifier power required to drive subwoofers, and the requirement for greater power handling for subwoofer drivers. Enclosure variations (e.g., <b>bass</b> <b>reflex</b> designs with a port in the cabinet) are often used for subwoofers to increase {{the efficiency}} of the driver/enclosure system, helping to reduce the amplifier power requirements.|$|E
5|$|Subwoofers {{are made}} up of one or more woofers mounted in a {{loudspeaker}} enclosure—often made of wood—capable of withstanding air pressure while resisting deformation. Subwoofer enclosures {{come in a variety of}} designs, including <b>bass</b> <b>reflex</b> (with a port or vent), using a subwoofer and one or more passive radiator speakers in the enclosure, acoustic suspension (sealed enclosure), infinite baffle, horn-loaded, and bandpass designs, representing unique trade-offs with respect to efficiency, low frequency range, cabinet size and cost. Passive subwoofers have a subwoofer driver and enclosure and they are powered by an external amplifier. Active subwoofers include a built-in amplifier.|$|E

50|$|The {{most famous}} and {{successful}} loudspeaker Joe Akroyd made was the Royd Minstrel. Launched in 1993, the Minstrel was a short, compact floor standing speaker, with a stand that angled it back slightly. It featured a side exiting <b>reflex</b> <b>bass</b> port and sold for £230-£300 depending on finish.Royd speakers remain in high demand, with their vintage continually elevating second hand prices.|$|R

The Albert Lee {{signature}} model comes with two custom-wound DiMarzio hum-bucking pickups and an African mahogany body. [...] On August 10, 2015, Ernie Ball announced that both the Big Al and <b>Reflex</b> <b>basses</b> {{are scheduled to be}} discontinued on October 31, 2015 in order to streamline the company's product offerings.|$|R
25|$|Other {{enclosure}} types {{alter the}} rear sound radiation {{so it can}} add constructively to the output {{from the front of}} the cone. Designs that do this (including <b>bass</b> <b>reflex,</b> passive radiator, transmission line, etc.) are often used to extend the effective low-frequency response and increase low-frequency output of the driver.|$|E
25|$|Human created sources: {{infrasound}} can {{be generated}} by human processes such as sonic booms and explosions (both chemical and nuclear), or by machinery such as diesel engines, wind turbines and specially designed mechanical transducers (industrial vibration tables). Certain specialized loudspeaker designs are also able to reproduce extremely low frequencies; these include large-scale rotary woofer models of subwoofer loudspeaker, as well as large horn loaded, <b>bass</b> <b>reflex,</b> sealed and transmission line loudspeakers.|$|E
25|$|Drums with {{cylindrical}} shells can be open {{at one end}} (as is {{the case}} with timbales), or can have two drum heads, one head on each end. Single-headed drums typically consist of a skin stretched over an enclosed space, or over one of the ends of a hollow vessel. Drums with two heads covering both ends of a cylindrical shell often have a small hole somewhat halfway between the two heads; the shell forms a resonating chamber for the resulting sound. Exceptions include the African slit drum, also known as a log drum as it is made from a hollowed-out tree trunk, and the Caribbean steel drum, made from a metal barrel. Drums with two heads can also have a set of wires, called snares, held across the bottom head, top head, or both heads, hence the name snare drum. On some drums with two heads, a hole or <b>bass</b> <b>reflex</b> port may be cut or installed onto one head, as with some 2010s era bass drums in rock music.|$|E
500|$|Subwoofers {{have been}} {{designed}} using a number of enclosure approaches: <b>bass</b> <b>reflex,</b> acoustic suspension, infinite baffle, horn loaded, tapped horn, transmission line and bandpass. Each enclosure type {{has advantages and disadvantages}} in efficiency increase, bass extension, cabinet size, distortion, and cost. Subwoofers are typically constructed by mounting one or more woofers in a cabinet of medium-density fibreboard (MDF), oriented strand board (OSB), plywood, fiberglass, aluminum or other stiff materials. [...] Because of the high air pressure they produce in the cabinet, subwoofer enclosures often require internal bracing to distribute the resulting forces.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} {{accessories}} {{are designed for}} the bass drum (also called [...] "kick drum"). Ported tubes for the bass drum are available {{to take advantage of}} the <b>bass</b> <b>reflex</b> speaker design, in which a tuned port (a hole and a carefully measured tube) are put in a speaker enclosure to improve the bass response at the lowest frequencies. Bass drumhead patches are available, which protect the drumhead from the impact of the felt beater. Bass drum pillows are fabric bags with filling or stuffing that can be used to alter the tone or resonance of the bass drum. A less expensive alternative to using a specialized bass drum pillow is to use an old sleeping bag.|$|E
2500|$|Combo guitar {{amplifier}} {{cabinets and}} guitar speaker cabinets use several different designs, including the [...] "open back" [...] cabinet, the closed back cabinet (a sealed box), and, less commonly, <b>bass</b> <b>reflex</b> designs, which use a closed {{back with a}} vent or port cut into the cabinet. With guitar amps, most [...] "open back" [...] amp cabinets are not fully open; part of the back is enclosed with panels. Combo guitar amp cabinets and standalone speaker cabinets are often made of plywood. Some are made of MDF or particle board—especially in low-budget models. Cabinet size and depth, material types, assembly methods, type and thickness of the baffle material (the wood panel that holds the speaker), {{and the way the}} baffle attaches to the cabinet all affect tone.|$|E
2500|$|In typical installations, subwoofers are {{physically}} {{separated from the}} rest of the speaker cabinets. [...] Because of propagation delay, their output may be somewhat out of phase from another subwoofer (on another channel) or slightly out of phase with the rest of the sound. [...] Consequently, a subwoofer's power amp often has a phase-delay adjustment (approximately 1 ms of delay is required for each additional foot of separation from the listener) which may improve performance of the system as a whole at subwoofer frequencies (and perhaps an octave or so above the crossover point). [...] However, the influence of room resonances (sometimes called standing waves) is typically so large that such issues are secondary in practice. Subwoofers are widely used in large concert and mid-sized venue sound reinforcement systems. Subwoofer cabinets are often built with a <b>bass</b> <b>reflex</b> port (i.e., a hole cut into the cabinet with a tube attached to it), a design feature which if properly engineered improves bass performance and increases efficiency.|$|E
50|$|Acoustic {{suspension}} woofers {{were once}} {{very popular in}} hi-fi systems due to their low distortion. Compared to <b>bass</b> <b>reflex</b> cabinets, acoustic suspension has a flatter frequency response and slower rolloff below their resonant frequency. <b>Bass</b> <b>reflex</b> cabinets are generally more efficient, however, {{and the use of}} a vent or port in the cabinet provides improved low-frequency response. Many subwoofers, bass amplifier cabinets and sound reinforcement system speaker cabinets use <b>bass</b> <b>reflex</b> ports, rather than a sealed box design, in order to obtain better efficiency and low-frequency response.|$|E

50|$|Passive {{radiators}} {{are considered}} to be similar in design to <b>bass</b> <b>reflex</b> systems, which use a port or vent cut into the speaker cabinet. Both <b>bass</b> <b>reflex</b> and passive radiator approaches are used with the same goal: to obtain better deep pitch sound from the system. <b>Bass</b> <b>reflex</b> is the most widely used technique for obtaining deeper bass notes from a speaker enclosure. Passive radiator designs are the next most-used approach to obtain deeper bass notes from a cabinetOne metaphor used to explain how PR systems work is to think of the air in the speaker enclosure like a spring.Sound on Sound Technical Editor Hugh Robjohns states that PR systems seem to be sealed up, like a sealed speaker enclosure, but in fact, he argues that because the drone cone(s) move in and out, a PR system is not really sealed. Robjohns states that the effect created by installing a PR in a speaker cabinet is basically creating a bigger tube, as with a <b>bass</b> <b>reflex</b> system. AE Speakers states that a PR is not a sealed box enclosure.|$|E

50|$|The speaker cabinets, which {{hold these}} drivers can be closed-back or open-back, along with {{variations}} {{such as a}} semi-open back 4x12&thinsp;in cabinet, which may have a baffle deflecting {{two of the four}} speakers. Closed back cabinets may be acoustic suspension or <b>bass</b> <b>reflex.</b> Bass cabinets are usually closed-back or use a <b>bass</b> <b>reflex</b> port or vent to boost low frequency response. The purpose of the cabinet is match the acoustic impedance seen by the driver to the driver's own electrical/mechanical impedance. Cabinets are best used when they are matched to the driver(s) being used; casual substitution of another driver which can be mounted in a cabinet will only accidentally make changes in a beneficial direction.|$|E
5000|$|A passive {{radiator}} speaker uses a second [...] "passive" [...] driver, or drone, to produce similar low-frequency extension, or efficiency increase, or enclosure size reduction, similar to ported enclosures. The passive driver is not wired to an amplifier; instead, it moves {{in response to}} changing enclosure pressures. In theory, such designs are variations of the <b>bass</b> <b>reflex</b> type, but with the advantage of avoiding a relatively small port or tube through which air moves, sometimes noisily. Tuning adjustments for a {{passive radiator}} are usually accomplished more quickly than with a <b>bass</b> <b>reflex</b> design since such corrections {{can be as simple}} as mass adjustments to the drone. The disadvantages are that a passive radiator requires precision construction quite like a driver, thus increasing costs, and has excursion limitations.|$|E

5000|$|Though helpful with {{improving}} efficiency, <b>bass</b> <b>reflex</b> cabinets {{can have}} poor transient response compared to sealed enclosures at frequencies near the lower limit of performance, causing [...] "smearing" [...] or a longer resonance of the bass notes. Proper adjustment ("tuning") {{of the cabinet}} and port size, and matching with driver characteristics can reduce much of this problem.|$|E
50|$|In some arrangements, {{loudspeakers}} {{are also}} {{mounted on a}} sound box to enhance their output, particularly bass speakers. One notable example of this arrangement is called the <b>bass</b> <b>reflex</b> enclosure. However, in these cases the box resonance is carefully tuned {{so as to make}} the sound more equal across frequencies, rather than to impart a particular character to the reinforced sound.|$|E
50|$|The {{speakers}} {{used for}} bass instrument amplification {{tend to be}} more heavy-duty than speakers used for regular electric guitar, and the speaker cabinets are typically more rigidly constructed and heavily braced, to prevent unwanted buzzes and rattles. Bass cabinets often include <b>bass</b> <b>reflex</b> ports, vents or openings in the cabinet, which improve the bass response and low-end, especially at high volumes.|$|E
5000|$|Human created sources: {{infrasound}} can {{be generated}} by human processes such as sonic booms and explosions (both chemical and nuclear), or by machinery such as diesel engines, wind turbines and specially designed mechanical transducers (industrial vibration tables). Certain specialized loudspeaker designs are also able to reproduce extremely low frequencies; these include large-scale rotary woofer models of subwoofer loudspeaker, as well as large horn loaded, <b>bass</b> <b>reflex,</b> sealed and transmission line loudspeakers.|$|E
50|$|A {{transmission}} line loudspeaker is a loudspeaker enclosure design (topology) that uses an acoustic {{transmission line}} within the cabinet, {{compared to the}} simpler enclosures used by sealed (closed) or ported (<b>bass</b> <b>reflex)</b> designs. Instead of reverberating in a fairly simple damped enclosure, sound {{from the back of}} the bass speaker is directed into a long (generally folded) damped pathway within the speaker enclosure, which allows far greater control and use of speaker energy, and the resulting sound.|$|E
50|$|A <b>bass</b> <b>reflex</b> system (also {{known as}} a ported, vented box or reflex port) {{is a type of}} {{loudspeaker}} enclosure that uses a port (hole) or vent cut into the cabinet and a section of tubing or pipe affixed to the port. This port enables the sound from the rear side of the diaphragm to increase the efficiency of the system at low frequencies as compared to a typical closed box (sealed-box) loudspeaker or an infinite baffle mounting.|$|E
50|$|Passive {{radiators}} {{are used}} in home stereo speakers, subwoofer cabinets and car audio speaker systems, particularly in cases where {{there is not enough}} space for a port or vent system. While most studio monitor speakers are either ported <b>bass</b> <b>reflex</b> designs, or closed-back without a vent or passive radiator, Mackie sells one small monitor speaker that has a passive radiator installed on the rear of the cabinet. Focal also sells a studio monitor with a passive radiator called the SM9.|$|E
50|$|Passive {{radiators}} do not behave {{exactly as}} their equivalent bass-reflex designs {{in that they}} cause a notch in system frequency response at the PR's free air resonant frequency; this causes a steeper roll-off below the system's tuned frequency Fb, and poorer transient response. Due {{to the lack of}} vent turbulence and vent pipe resonances, many prefer the sound of PRs to reflex ports. PR speakers, however, are more complex to design and likely to be more expensive as compared to standard <b>bass</b> <b>reflex</b> enclosures.|$|E
