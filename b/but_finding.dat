5|$|James Clark {{was born}} to Robert and Susannah (Henderson) Clark on January 16, 1779, near the Peaks of Otter in Bedford County, Virginia. In 1794, {{the family moved to}} Clark County, Kentucky, where Clark was educated by Dr. James Blythe (who later became a {{professor}} at Transylvania University) and attended Pisgah Academy in Woodford County. Clark then went to Virginia, where he studied law with his brother, Christopher. He was admitted to the bar in 1797. He briefly traveled to Vincennes, Indiana and St. Louis, Missouri {{looking for a place to}} open his practice, <b>but</b> <b>finding</b> none that suited him, he returned to Kentucky and commenced practice in Winchester.|$|E
5|$|Modeled on The Lord of the Rings, the Ice and Fire {{story begins}} with a tight focus on a small group (with {{everyone}} in Winterfell, except Daenerys) and then splits into separate stories. The storylines are to converge again, <b>but</b> <b>finding</b> the turning point in this complex series has been difficult for Martin and has slowed down his writing. Depending on the interview, Martin {{is said to have}} reached the turning point in A Dance with Dragons, or to not quite have reached it yet in the books. The series' structure of multiple POVs and interwoven storylines was inspired by Wild Cards, a multi-authored shared universe book series edited by Martin since 1985. As the sole author, Martin begins each new book with an outline of the chapter order and may write a few successive chapters from a single character's viewpoint instead of working chronologically. The chapters are later rearranged to optimize character intercutting, chronology, and suspense.|$|E
5|$|Oshii based {{the setting}} for Ghost in the Shell on Hong Kong. Oshii commented that his first thought to find {{an image of the}} future setting was an Asian city, <b>but</b> <b>finding</b> a {{suitable}} cityscape of the future would be impossible. Oshii chose to use the real streets of Hong Kong as his model. He also said that Hong Kong was the perfect subject and theme for the film with its countless signs and the cacophony of sounds. The film's mecha designer Takeuchi Atsushi noted that while the film does not have a chosen setting, it is obviously based on Hong Kong because the city represented the theme of the film, {{the old and the new}} which exist in a strange relationship in an age of an information deluge. Before shooting the film, the artists drew sketches that emphasized Hong Kong's chaotic, confusing and overwhelming aspects.|$|E

5|$|Aristocrates, who was {{commanding}} a regiment of hoplites in Piraeus, {{arrested the}} extremist general Alexicles; enraged, the extremist {{leaders of the}} 400 demanded action, and {{made a number of}} threats against Theramenes and his party. To their surprise, Theramenes volunteered to lead a force to rescue Alexicles; the leaders of the extremists acquiesced, and Theramenes set out to Piraeus, sharing his command with one other moderate and one extremist, Aristarchus. When Theramenes and his force arrived at Piraeus, Aristarchus, in a rage, exhorted the men to attack the hoplites who had seized Alexicles. Theramenes feigned rage as well, but when asked by the hoplites whether he thought that the fortification on Eetioneia was a good idea, he responded that if they wanted to pull it down, he thought that would be good. Calling out that everyone who wanted the 5,000 to govern instead of the 400, the hoplites set to work. Donald Kagan has suggested that this call was probably instigated by Theramenes' party, who wanted the 5,000 to govern; the hoplites tearing down the fortification might well have preferred a return to the democracy. Several days later, the Peloponnesian fleet approached Piraeus, <b>but,</b> <b>finding</b> the fortifications destroyed and the port well defended, they sailed on to Euboea. Several days later, the 400 were formally deposed and replaced by a government of the 5,000; the most extreme of the oligarchs fled the city.|$|E
5|$|George Stratton {{was born}} on September 26, 1865 to James Thompson Stratton, {{originally}} from Ossining, New York, and Cornelia A. Smith. His parents had met and married in New York in 1854, and settled back in Clinton, now East Oakland, California. James Stratton had been to California once before during the gold rush of 1850, sailing around North America and crossing by land the Panama stretch, <b>but</b> <b>finding</b> little gold. The senior Stratton traced his ancestry to the early settlers of the British settlements of America, and Cornelia Smith had Dutch and English forebears. James Stratton would live {{the rest of his}} life in California, pursuing a civil engineering career as County Surveyor for Alameda County in 1858–59 and later as the U.S. Surveyor-General of the state, and finally as Chief Deputy State Surveyor. An expert on the big Mexican land grants, he split up several of the Spanish deeds. One of his sons, Frederick, went to the University of California, today's Berkeley, and became a lawyer, state senator, and Collector of the Port of San Francisco, before killing himself on November 30, 1915. Another, Robert Thomas, became a doctor in Oakland and died after a long illness on May 6, 1924. The couple also had a daughter, Jeanne, the later Mrs. Walter Good. George was their youngest child who lived past toddlerhood.|$|E
5|$|While his son {{had been}} {{attempting}} to consolidate the Spanish control of Cupul, Francisco de Montejo the Elder had met the Xiu ruler at Maní. The Xiu Maya maintained their friendship with the Spanish throughout the conquest and Spanish authority was eventually established over Yucatán in large part due to Xiu support. The Montejos, after reuniting at Dzikabal, founded a new Spanish town at Dzilam, although the Spanish suffered hardships there. Montejo the Elder returned to Campeche, where he was received with friendship by the local Maya. He was accompanied by the friendly Chel lord Namux Chel, who travelled on horseback, {{and two of the}} lord's cousins, who were taken in chains. Montejo the Younger remained behind in Dzilam to continue his attempts at conquest of the region <b>but,</b> <b>finding</b> the situation too difficult, he soon retreated to Campeche to rejoin his father and Alonso d'Avila, who had returned to Campeche shortly before Montejo the Younger. Around this time, the news began to arrive of Francisco Pizarro's conquests in Peru and the rich plunder that his soldiers were taking there, undermining the morale of Montejo's already disenchanted band of followers. Montejo's soldiers began to abandon him to seek their fortune elsewhere; in seven years of attempted conquest in the northern provinces of the Yucatán Peninsula, very little gold had been found. Towards the end of 1534 or the beginning of the next year, Montejo the Elder and his son retreated from Campeche to Veracruz, taking their remaining soldiers with them.|$|E

50|$|The {{foundations}} of the Skara Cathedral are believed to stem from around 1050. The current cathedral was inaugurated in 1150, <b>but</b> <b>findings</b> during the last 50 years show it {{must be at least}} a century older. Its current appearance, however, stems from renovations in the 1880s by Helgo Zettervall, who also renovated the Cathedral of Uppsala.|$|R

50|$|Varies with age, but {{the normal}} {{reference}} range {{for an adult}} is 16-20 breaths/minute (RCP 2012). The value of respiratory rate {{as an indicator of}} potential respiratory dysfunction has been investigated <b>but</b> <b>findings</b> suggest it is of limited value. Respiratory rate is a clear indicator of acidotic states, as the main function of respiration is removal of CO2 leaving bicarbonate base in circulation.|$|R

Black bears are also resident on the mountain {{and are more likely to}} be seen during the early morning and evening hours. Red-tailed hawks, warblers, vireos and songbirds are found here throughout the seasons.|$|E
25|$|Southard {{was born}} in Boothbay, Maine on May 18, 1808. In 1819, {{at the age of}} eleven, intent on {{becoming}} a sailor, Southard hiked across to Richmond, Maine (then known as White's Landing), where he was hired by Captain Solomon Blanchard. For the next year, Southard worked aboard coastal vessels as a ship's boy and cook, <b>but</b> <b>finding</b> this line of work disagreeable, he secured instead a position as a blacksmith's apprentice at Richmond.|$|E
25|$|Because his {{stepmother}} opposed {{his wish}} to attend college, Whitney {{worked as a}} farm laborer and school teacher to save money. He prepared for Yale at Leicester Academy (now Becker College) and {{under the tutelage of}} Rev. Elizur Goodrich of Durham, Connecticut, he entered the class of 1789 and graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1792. Whitney expected to study law <b>but,</b> <b>finding</b> himself short of funds, accepted an offer to go to South Carolina as a private tutor.|$|E
40|$|In 29 {{patients}} with urinary obstruction due to prostatic enlargement, medium-fill water cystometry was performed before prostatectomy and again 3 months after. A {{high incidence of}} detrusor hyperreflexia was observed pre-operatively, <b>but</b> <b>findings</b> were essentially normal 3 months after resection of the prostate. Possible mechanisms to explain these findings are developed. However, {{it was clear that}} the cystometric findings were not related to prostatic size...|$|R
40|$|The neurobiological {{underpinnings}} of avolition in schizophrenia remain unclear. Most brain imaging {{research has focused}} on reward prediction deficit and on ventral striatum dysfunction, <b>but</b> <b>findings</b> are not consistent.

25|$|For {{local class}} field theory, {{it is also}} {{possible}} to construct abelian extensions more explicitly using Lubin–Tate formal group laws. For global fields, the abelian extensions can be constructed explicitly in some cases: for example, the abelian extensions of the rationals can be constructed using roots of unity, and the abelian extensions of quadratic imaginary fields can be constructed using elliptic functions, <b>but</b> <b>finding</b> an analog of this for arbitrary global fields is an unsolved problem.|$|E
25|$|By {{the summer}} of 1942 it {{appeared}} {{most of the major}} problems had been solved, and a new lab under the direction of E.A. Luebke was set up to develop a working system. The Army Air Force, long a proponent of precision bombing <b>but</b> <b>finding</b> themselves unable to deliver on their promises in combat, placed high hopes on the system's ability to attack pinpoint targets, pressing for its development in spite of other systems like H2X already beginning to enter production.|$|E
25|$|After the war, McCord left South Carolina for a time, went to Charlottesville, Virginia, and thence {{further to}} Canada —to Coburg and other points. <b>But,</b> <b>finding</b> {{that she could}} not remain away from South Carolina, she returned, and, though embittered by it, took the oath of {{allegiance}} that she might have the disposal of her own property. The latter years of McCord's life were spent in Charleston, in the home of her son-in-law, Major Augustine T. Smythe, and his wife, her daughter Louisa.|$|E
40|$|APOE {{polymorphism}} {{has received}} extensive attention as {{a risk factor}} for Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease (PD), <b>but</b> <b>findings</b> have been equivocal. Analysis of APOE variants in an Australian PD case-control sample revealed a robust association between genotype and age-at-onset (AAO) of PD in women (P = 0. 0008).
