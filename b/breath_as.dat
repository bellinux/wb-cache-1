5|$|As the two champions {{appeared}} {{they were}} greeted by a frenzy of excitement and everyone was on their feet to acclaim the two heroes. It was difficult to recognise them. Garin was first, followed by the mud-soaked figure of Cordang. Suddenly, to the stupefaction of everyone, Cordang slipped and fell on the velodrome's cement surface. Garin could not believe his luck. By the time Cordang was back on his bike, he had lost 100 metres. There remained six laps to cover. Two miserable kilometres in which to catch Garin. The crowd held its <b>breath</b> <b>as</b> they watched the incredible pursuit match. The bell rang out. One lap, there remained one lap. 333 metres for Garin, who had a lead of 30 metres on the Batave.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opening}} scene in which Michael puts his face in cement, the wet cement that was used was {{actually}} putty. The crew was planning to do only one take of Steve Carell putting {{his face in the}} putty, so he was instructed to hold his <b>breath</b> <b>as</b> long as he possibly could. But the crew forgot to tell the other actors about that, so during the filming of the scene, the actors thought he was actually stuck and there was a rush to pull him out. Kim M. Ferry, owner of the Nissan Xterra featured in the episode, is the show's Department Head Hairstylist. After it was used on the show, she decided to sell it on eBay. The listing was first put up on eBay on May 1, 2008, the night the episode aired.|$|E

Phil's widow Patti openly blamed her husband's death on his smoking habit, which caused him to develop chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease, and recounted Phil spending his final years having to carry oxygen tanks with him wherever he went and taking 20 different types of medications per day. She stated that although Phil had stopped smoking in 2001, his lungs had already sustained permanent damage. Phil's last public appearance was in 2011, at Buddy Holly's induction to Hollywood Boulevard's Star Walk of Fame, and he was then struggling to catch his <b>breath</b> <b>as</b> he addressed the crowd.

[...] " [...] one {{of those}} rare {{instances}} where none can review it, or talk about it, without mentioning the cameraman, art director, and score composer in the same <b>breath</b> <b>as</b> the actors and director." [...] Variety also praised the cast, writing that [...] "Karloff manages to invest the character with some subtleties of emotion that are surprisingly real and touching... Thesiger as Dr Pretorious [...] a diabolic characterization if ever there was one... Lanchester handles two assignments, being first in a preamble as author Mary Shelley and then the created woman. In latter assignment she impresses quite highly." ...|$|E
500|$|Music writer Keith Shadwick {{describes}} Hendrix's {{performance as}} [...] "a staggering display of blues guitar playing that {{is worthy of}} mention in the same <b>breath</b> <b>as</b> his later efforts with the Experience". Although Shadwick compares his guitar tone and phraseology to that of Buddy Guy, he adds that his techniques [...] "simply transcend any previous models, and breaks new ground" [...] and shows that [...] "his ability to spin out long and consistently surprising lines across the standard blues changes is already full grown". In 1966, during his residency as Jimmy James and the Blue Flames at the Cafe Wha? in New York City's Greenwich Village, Hendrix continued to develop his slow blues number that became [...] "Red House".|$|E

Then something happened that to this day I still cannot get over. He asked me to bend down and touch my toes.

Bill Binkelman writes that while he doubts fans of Liquid Mind or other mainly electronic new age music artists would wholly embrace the overt romanticism of piano-led tracks like 'Dancers Waltz' or 'Dreamer's Lullaby', there is definite appeal on the album for fans of adult contemporary piano pieces, {{as well as for}} lovers of the more minimal approach to new age music." [...] Reviewing for Allmusic, Jim Brenholts describes One Deep <b>Breath</b> <b>as</b> a set of smooth adult contemporary pieces in which Joseph adds [...] "world music flair and inspirational touches".

500|$|The {{battle at}} Ostrach had been difficult, as Jourdan pointed out, {{due largely to}} the dense fog and terrible weather that {{hampered}} his observation of his enemy's movements, yet the same fog that blinded him to the Austrian movements {{did not seem to}} hamper Charles. [...] The fog and rainy weather did play a role, however. On a local level, in the damp night of the 20th, which was Gründonnerstag, (German: Green Thursday, or Maundy Thursday), the Danube overflowed, backing up into the Ostrach, and causing it to burst its own banks. The flood trapped 300civilians between the two armies intent on destruction; suspecting what was to come, Ostrachers huddled in their cellars, and hoped for the best and gasping for <b>breath</b> <b>as</b> the battle thundered overhead. Amazingly, none were killed, although they spent Easter Sunday caring for the wounded, and helping to bury the 4,000or so soldiers who died in the battle.|$|E
500|$|Lawrence van Gelder of New York Times {{gave the}} film a mixed review, {{saying that he}} enjoying the experience, but finding it a little {{frivolous}} when compared to both its subject matter and events at the time. His ultimate impression from the English-dubbed version was that the film {{could easily have been}} set in present-day New York. Chris Beveridge of Mania.com said that the film [...] " [...] out like a much expanded episode but without feeling like its being padded to do so", generally praising the plot along with Vincent's characterization and Spike's expanded portrayal. Jamie Russell, writing for the BBC, gave it 4 out of 5 stars, saying it was [...] "good enough to deserve mention in the same <b>breath</b> <b>as</b> Akira, Ghost in the Shell, and Spirited Away". The most praise went to the use of live-action camera angles. Though he found the film's story sometimes slowed noticeably, the soundtrack and visual references to other notable action films made it [...] "an example of anime at its very best." [...] Other newspapers of the time, including the Los Angeles Times, Toronto Star, Chicago Tribune and web magazine Salon generally shared opinions with other reviewers: several praised the plot and animation, while others were mixed. Others, including the Toronto Star and Newark Star-Ledger, noted its connection to science fiction films.|$|E

500|$|Filming {{began on}} March 12, 2007, {{with the first}} few weeks spent on Stark's captivity in Afghanistan. The cave where Stark is imprisoned was a [...] long set, which had movable forks in the caverns to allow greater freedom for the film's crew. Production {{designer}} J. Michael Riva saw footage of a Taliban fighter in Afghanistan, and saw the cold <b>breath</b> <b>as</b> he spoke: realizing remote caves are actually very cold, Riva placed an air conditioning system in the set. He also sought Downey's advice about makeshift objects in prison, such as a sock being used to make tea. Afterwards, Stark's capture was filmed at Lone Pine, and other exterior scenes in Afghanistan were filmed at Olancha Sand Dunes, where the crew endured two days of [...] winds. Filming at Edwards Air Force Base began in mid-April, and ended on May 2. Exterior shots of Stark's home were digitally added to footage of Point Dume in Malibu, while the interior was built at Playa Vista, where Favreau and Riva aimed to make Stark's home look less futuristic and more [...] "". Filming concluded on June 25, 2007, at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada. Favreau, a newcomer to action films, remarked, [...] "I'm shocked that I [...] on schedule. I thought that there were going to be many curveballs". He hired [...] "people who are good at creating action", so [...] "the human story [...] like it belongs to the comic book genre".|$|E
500|$|Despite criticisms, most reviews were {{ultimately}} favourable to Empire: Total War. While IGN {{felt that the}} game [...] "drags a bit {{and there are some}} small, rough edges in the tactical battles", the game still [...] "deserves to be mentioned in the same <b>breath</b> <b>as</b> the greatest names in gaming history". 1UP.com finished by saying [...] "For all its problems, it's undoubtedly progress", while Eurogamer felt that issues [...] "limit [...] to being merely one of the games of the year," [...] but implied that a post-release patch could deal with these flaws. GameSpot summarised that the game was [...] "complex and rewarding" [...] and GameSpy praised the game for [...] "the simplified interface elements, great campaign, and much-improved map and information screens [...] make this the most accessible Total War yet, and a great place for those unfamiliar with the series to get started". Crispy Gamer, while acclaiming the game [...] "spectacular" [...] and [...] "lovingly historical", criticised the documentation and concluded that the game falls apart due to its bad AI. The Game Informer reviewers criticised the AI, but still described the overall game experience as [...] "fantastic" [...] and [...] "outstanding". GamePro provided a dissenting opinion; although describing Empire: Total War as a game with a potential that [...] "with some extra tweaking, could have proven itself an excellent title", noted that it [...] "has a heap of problems that need resolving" [...] with bugs and crashes. PC Gamer UK enthusiastically proclaimed the game as [...] "one of the most playable, important and accomplished games ever created".|$|E
500|$|Brown was {{regarded}} as a cautious starter who was reluctant to use his full array of strokes. He had an upright stance and was known for his trademark leg glancing and placement of the ball. He hooked occasionally and scored the majority of his off-side runs with the cut shot. Johnnie Moyes said that [...] "even when slow, he never wearied, as some do, because his style was cultured and free from jarring faults". Moyes felt that Brown's superior record on English soil was a result of the crowd attitude, which was more respectful. At Australian grounds, impatient spectators who disliked Brown's cautious batting frequently heckled him, blaming Brown for delaying Bradman's arrival to the crease. [...] Moyes felt that the more serene English gallery allowed Brown to play to his game plan without hastening to placate impatient spectators. [...] "A placid chap was Brown, and he liked to play in peaceful surroundings. When on the job he was as emotionless as a stoic." [...] Moyes said that Brown was [...] "always cool and thoughtful, he preferred finesse to force". The English journalist Neville Cardus commented [...] "His cricket is perpetually keeping an appointment leisurely with moments to spare. Does the bat have an engagement this over with a half-volley? Very well, then, put it down in the book. We'll be there for it. Plenty of time." [...] Bradman also noted Brown's ability to quickly get into position to play the ball, writing [...] "One hallmark of good batting is that the player appears to have plenty of time in which to play his strokes. Bill Brown was an outstanding case of one who never seemed to be in a hurry for any stroke." [...] Ray Robinson said that Brown was [...] "the most serene batsman I ever saw play for Australia". Robinson said that [...] "for artistry, Brown's leg-glancing could be mentioned in the same <b>breath</b> <b>as</b> Archie Jackson's". Brown's placid nature extended to his observations of modern cricket—he disliked the emotional displays made by contemporary players.|$|E

In fact she rarely leaves the stage—preferring to change costumes in a phone booth instead. Boy can she change. One minute she's a 50's teenager in a party dress, next she's playing a speak-easy chanteuse. It's almost difficult to believe that a career as young as Madonna's could contain so much popular material that on stage the star can barely get to half of it." [...] Don McLeese from Chicago Sun-Times reviewed the performance at Soldier Field stadium said that [...] "'Shine' seems like a dim possibility for her Soldier Field performance this month, because Madonna invariably takes the stage after dusk has turned to dark and brings back the sun again for the two hours that she played." [...] In another review, McCleese commented: [...] " [...] proceeded to show Soldier Field a few moves that would gain Walter Payton some yardage, while putting a whole new twist on the term 'backfield in motion'. The girl really knows how to cause a commotion." [...] Richard Harrington from The Washington Post felt that the tour [...] "would have played better to a full house at the Capital Centre or Merriweather Post Pavilion. But to her credit, Madonna performed last night as if the house was full, and the show is splendid pop theater. Madonna has described it as 'Broadway in a stadium', and with her nonstop dancing, costume changes, mini-dramas and dynamic pacing, it is sort of a 'Liza With an M.'" [...] Jon Pareles from The New York Times reviewed the concert at Madison Square Garden in New York and felt that [...] "For all its effort and professionalism, the concert wasn't exactly moving; Madonna had to ask the audience to get up and dance twice. But as shallow, kitschy, pop entertainment—no big messages, no revelations, familiar sounds and images, plenty of catchy tunes—the show was easy to enjoy. [...] The tunes stick to her limited vocal range and usually use short phrases—the better to keep her from running out of <b>breath</b> <b>as</b> she dances across the stage. And her band knocked the songs out with solid precision, recreating the gleaming sound of her records.|$|E
