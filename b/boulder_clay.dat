5|$|The geology of {{the area}} {{is made up of}} a {{carboniferous}} bedrock of sandstone, mudstone and coal, which is covered mainly by <b>boulder</b> <b>clay</b> and till.|$|E
5|$|Glacial {{striation}} and {{the presence}} of chalk and flint erratics that originated from the bed of the North Sea demonstrate the influence of ice action on the geomorphology of the islands. <b>Boulder</b> <b>clay</b> is also abundant and moraines cover substantial areas.|$|E
5|$|Southern Bedfordshire {{is part of}} the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. North and mid Bedfordshire are undulating claylands {{with broad}} river valleys of the River Great Ouse and its tributaries, and the Bedfordshire Greensand Ridge. Jurassic and Cretaceous clays are {{overlaid}} by Quaternary glacial deposits of chalky <b>boulder</b> <b>clay.</b>|$|E
40|$|The physical-mechanical andl {{structural}} {{properties of}} <b>boulder</b> <b>clays</b> of the Vistnla Glaciation {{in the area}} of Poland In the light of the investigations, it has been found that the <b>boulder</b> <b>clays</b> of Pomeranian and Leszno phases have not generally reached the full consolidation. In most cases, illite is the main clay mineral, and in few cases it is montmorillonite. The physical properties (specific density,volume density, natural water content, liquid limit, plastic limit, soaking and swelling) and the mechanical properties (angle of the internal friction, cohesion) of both types of <b>boulder</b> <b>clays</b> are very much alike, {{and at the same time}} these parameters are lower than in the <b>boulder</b> <b>clays</b> of the older glaciations...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of dilatometer and laboratory tests performed on heavily preconsolidated <b>boulder</b> <b>clays</b> and Pliocene clays prevailing in the Warsaw region. Several different correlations available for evaluating undrained shear strength and constrained modulus from dilatometer tests are discussed. Empirical coefficients for multi-factor correlation to obtain undrained shear strength from dilatometer tests for <b>boulder</b> <b>clays</b> and Pliocene clays were determined. The relationship between factor RM and horizontal stress index (KD) for <b>boulder</b> <b>clays</b> was proposed for the evaluation of constrained modulus from dilatometer tests...|$|R
5|$|Several ice ages {{shaped the}} land through glacial erosion, {{creating}} u-shaped valleys and depositing <b>boulder</b> <b>clays,</b> {{especially on the}} western seaboard. The last major incursion of ice peaked about 18,000 years ago, leaving other remnant features such at the granite tors on the Cairngorm mountain plateaux.|$|R
5|$|The harbour and {{the mouth}} of the River Esk are on a {{geological}} fault. On the east side the cliff is tall, , and consists of alternating layers of shale, sandstone and clay. On the west side the cliff is much lower and has a deep capping of <b>boulder</b> <b>clay</b> over a sandstone base making it less stable and liable to slippage. Both cliffs are being eroded quite rapidly.|$|E
5|$|Middle Devonian basaltic {{volcanic}} {{rocks are}} found on western Hoy, on Deerness in eastern Mainland and on Shapinsay. Correlation between the Hoy volcanics {{and the other}} two exposures has been proposed, but differences in chemistry means this remains uncertain. Lamprophyre dykes of Late Permian age are found throughout Orkney. Glacial striation and the presence of chalk and flint erratics that originated from the bed of the North Sea demonstrate the influence of ice action on the geomorphology of the islands. <b>Boulder</b> <b>clay</b> is also abundant and moraines cover substantial areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of {{buildings in the}} area are houses from the 20th century, {{but there are a few}} buildings, landmarks, and objects that date from the 16th century, in addition to Bramall Hall which dates from the 14th century. In particular, there are many Victorian buildings in several places across the area. The local drift geology is mostly glacial <b>boulder</b> <b>clay,</b> as well as glacial sands and gravel. For many years the clay has been used for making bricks and tiles.|$|E
50|$|The sea bed of {{the wind}} farm zone {{consisted}} of sand/gravel,or glacial material including sand/gravel and boulders in Diamicton (mud/sand); below the sea bed surface strata include <b>boulder</b> <b>clays</b> and tills. Bedrock was located at between sea bed level and 100m below sea bed, with deeper levels at {{the west of the}} zone.|$|R
50|$|It {{was first}} {{described}} in 1958 for an occurrence in the Outokumpu ore deposit of eastern Finland. It occurs in chromium bearing tremolite skarns, metamorphosed quartzites and chlorite bearing veins in Finland; in glacial <b>boulder</b> <b>clays</b> in Ireland and in stream pebbles in the Merume River of Guyana. It {{has also been}} recognized as a rare component in chondrite meteorites.|$|R
50|$|About 478,000 to 424,000 {{years ago}} during {{the ice age}} period known as the Anglian Stage, glaciers {{approached}} from the North Sea and reached as far south-west as Bricket Wood. Glacial gravels and <b>boulder</b> <b>clays</b> cover {{a great deal of}} the whole area to the north east of the county and the Upper Chalk itself has been disturbed at Reed and Barley by glaciation.|$|R
5|$|The soils of {{the islands}} reflect the diverse geology. Bute has the most {{productive}} land, and a pattern of deposits that {{is typical of the}} southwest of Scotland. There is a mixture of <b>boulder</b> <b>clay</b> and other glacial deposits in the eroded valleys, and raised beach and marine deposits elsewhere, especially to the south and west which result in a machair landscape in places, inland from the sandy bays, such as Stravanan.|$|E
5|$|Greater Manchester {{is mainly}} urban, {{and is one}} of the most densely {{populated}} regions in Europe. In the second half of the 18thcentury, the Industrial Revolution played an important role in the growth and development of Manchester and its surrounding area, and industry continues to be a major part of the region's economy. There are few buildings surviving from before the Industrial Revolution, but many from the 19th and 20thcenturies. The bedrock consists mainly of Carboniferous sandstones, including millstone grit, which is a major source of building material for the region's churches. The superficial deposits are of <b>boulder</b> <b>clay,</b> which provides material for making bricks.|$|E
5|$|The {{geography}} in {{the area}} affects the local climate of the city with the Aarhus Bay imposing a temperate effect on the low-lying valley floor where central Aarhus is located. Brabrand Lake to the west further contributes to this effect {{and as a result}} the valley has a very mild, temperate climate. The sandy ground on the valley floor dries up quickly after winter and warms faster in the summer than the surrounding hills of moist-retaining <b>boulder</b> <b>clay.</b> These conditions affect crops and plants that often bloom 1â€“2 weeks earlier in the valley than on the northern and southern hillsides.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the valley}} is Selwyn Rock (...) a glaciated {{pavement}} {{in the bed of}} the Inman River. It was first described in 1859 by, and later named for, A.R.C. Selwyn, who was Victorian Government Geologist at the time. Glacial grooves and striations on the polished surface indicate glacial movement to the north-west. <b>Boulder</b> <b>clays,</b> tillites, and erratics are also common in the area, which underwent glaciation during the Permian (approximately 270 Ma).|$|R
25|$|Geologically, Holderness is {{underlain}} by Cretaceous chalk but in {{most places}} it is so deeply buried beneath glacial deposits {{that it has no}} influence on the landscape. The landscape is dominated by deposits of till, <b>boulder</b> <b>clays</b> and glacial lake clays. These were deposited during the Devensian glaciation. The glacial deposits form a more or less continuous lowland plain which has some peat filled depressions (known locally as meres) which mark the presence of former lake beds. There are other glacial landscape features such as drumlin mounds, ridges and kettle holes scattered throughout the area.|$|R
25|$|Most, but not all, of {{the county}} was covered with the ice sheet during the last Ice age. As the ice retreated, County Wexford {{would have been one}} of the first areas to be covered with glacial drift (a mixture of <b>boulders,</b> <b>clay,</b> sand and gravel) that {{blanketed}} the existing bedrock. This has led to high quality soils, suitable for a wide range of agriculture. A very detailed soil survey {{of the county}} was published in 1964, as part of the 'National Soil Survey of Ireland'. It classifies each area of the county according to its specific soil type.|$|R
5|$|The town is sited on {{the hills}} {{adjoining}} the flood plain of the River Nene. In the predominantly agrarian medieval period, this combination of access to fertile, if flood-prone, valley bottom soils and drier (but heavier and more clay-rich) hillside/ hilltop soils {{seems to have been}} good for a mixed agricultural base. The clay-rich hilltop soils are primarily a consequence of blanketing of the area with <b>boulder</b> <b>clay</b> or glacial till during the recent glaciations. On the valley sides and valley floor however, these deposits have been largely washed away in the late glacial period, and in the valley bottom extensive deposits of gravels were laid down, which have largely been exploited for building aggregate in the last century.|$|E
5|$|In the Pleistocene era Mingulay {{was covered}} by the ice sheets which spread from Scotland out into the Atlantic Ocean beyond the Outer Hebrides. After the last retreat of the ice around 20,000 years ago, sea levels were lower than at present and circa 14,000 BP it was joined to a single large island {{comprising}} most {{of what is now}} the Outer Hebrides. Steadily rising sea levels since that time then isolated the island, which is made up of Hebridean gneiss interspersed with some granite. The ice deposited both erratic blocks of rock and <b>boulder</b> <b>clay</b> on {{the eastern side of the}} island around Mingulay Bay. The rest of the island is covered in peat, thin acidic soils, or bare rock.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the last}} ice age the eastern {{coastline}} of the area was located along the eastern foot of the Yorkshire Wolds where remnants of beaches have been discovered. The North Sea ice sheet deposited huge amounts of <b>boulder</b> <b>clay</b> as it retreated and this subsequently formed a wet and swampy area which became the plain of Holderness. Another ice sheet in the Vale of York retreated at the same time leaving thick glacial deposits and two prominent moraines {{to the west of the}} Wolds. These Vale of York deposits also formed wetlands. The Wolds themselves were largely ice-free, well drained, chalk uplands. Gradually the tundra conditions that had existed as the ice retreated gave way to vegetation that could support grazing fauna. Because a lot of water was still locked in the northern ice sheets, sea level was much lower than in the present day and an area of land stretched eastwards to the low countries.|$|E
50|$|The {{rocks of}} Hertfordshire {{belong to the}} great shallow {{syncline}} known as the London Basin. The beds dip in a south-easterly direction towards the syncline's lowest point roughly under the River Thames. The most important formations are the Cretaceous Chalk, exposed as the high ground {{in the north and}} west of the county, forming the Chiltern Hills and the younger Palaeocene, Reading Beds and Eocene, London Clay which occupy the remaining southern part. The eastern half of the county was covered by glaciers during the Ice Age and has a superficial layer of glacial <b>boulder</b> <b>clays.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The feature {{was first}} {{detected}} and described by Professor Sidney Wooldridge (1938 and 1960), who dated {{it to the}} Anglian Stage glaciation around 450,000 BP, when ice and <b>boulder</b> <b>clays</b> advanced up the Thames valley as far as Bricket Wood and Finchley {{in the west and}} Hornchurch to the south. Later work (by Moffat and Catt, 1982; Avery and Catt, 1983; Green and McGregor, 1983), which matched gravel deposits in the Vale of St Albans with those in the modern lower Thames valley suggests that the Finchley overflow route is unlikely.and that once ponded back by the ice the primordial Thames overflowed directly into its current route around Staines.|$|R
5|$|The Holderness {{landscape}} {{is dominated by}} deposits of till, <b>boulder</b> <b>clays</b> and glacial lake clays. These were deposited during the Devensian glaciation. The glacial deposits form {{a more or less}} continuous lowland plain which has some peat filled depressions (known locally as meres) which mark the presence of former lake beds. There are other glacial landscape features such as drumlin mounds, ridges and kettle holes scattered throughout the area. The well drained glacial deposits provide fertile soils that can support intensive arable cultivation. Fields are generally large and bounded by drainage ditches. There is very little woodland in the area and this leads to a landscape that is essentially rural but very flat and exposed.|$|R
5|$|In {{common with}} most of the Orkney isles, Shapinsay has a bedrock formed from Old Red Sandstone, which is {{approximately}} 400 million years old and was laid down in the Devonian period. These thick deposits accumulated as earlier Silurian rocks, uplifted by the formation of Pangaea, eroded and then deposited into river deltas. The freshwater Lake Orcadie existed on the edges of these eroding mountains, stretching from Shetland to the southern Moray Firth. The composition of Shapinsay is mostly of the Rousay flagstone group from the Lower Middle Devonian, with some Eday flagstone in the southeast formed in wetter conditions during the later Upper Devonian. The latter is regarded as a better quality building material than the former. At Haco's Ness in the south east corner of the island is a small outcrop of amygdaloidal diabase. The island is overlain with a fertile layer of <b>boulder</b> <b>clay</b> formed during the Pleistocene glaciations.|$|E
25|$|The town {{is built}} on Lower Keuper {{saliferous}} beds from which salt has been mined. Deposits of alluvium run along the river valleys and cover most of {{the area of the}} town. Surrounding the town is deposits of <b>boulder</b> <b>clay</b> and glacial sand and gravel can be found to the north-west.|$|E
25|$|The Holderness {{coastline}} is {{susceptible to}} erosion due to the long north-easterly fetch, allowing for powerful waves, and the softness of the geology {{that make up the}} cliffs. Holderness is also a former bay that was filled in during the last ice age and is now made up of chalk/glacial compounds that are easily eroded such as <b>boulder</b> <b>clay.</b>|$|E
50|$|Though {{populations have}} been declining within the Great Lakes, {{they have been}} {{continually}} documented throughout small and medium rivers and streams. Thriving in small stream environments, the creek chub gravitates toward areas of weeds to appear secure and avoid predation. Varying in environments containing a multitude of substrates, they have been documented over gravel, sand, silt, rubble, mud, <b>boulders,</b> <b>clay,</b> bedrock and detritus bottoms. This fish actually prefers the stream or river environment {{compared to that of}} a lake, as they have been recorded in streams far more than lakes. Of over 440 individuals caught, only 9 were from lakes, and when limiting the locations to solely lakes, only six individuals were caught.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are also}} {{interesting}} conglomerate geological formations {{made up of}} quartzite <b>boulders</b> and unstratified <b>clays</b> known locally as [...] "raÃ±as".|$|R
40|$|Geomorphic {{features}} and Pleistocene deposits on Huangshan {{have been attributed}} to glaciation. Recent reassessment questions this interpretation. As part of the reassessment, quartz sand grains from deposits identified as glacial <b>boulder</b> <b>clays</b> (till composed of <b>boulders</b> in a <b>clay</b> or silt matrix) were analyzed by scanning electron microscope for evidence of their sedimentary history. Surface textures found on the boulder-clay grains were compared with those on grains with known sedimentary histories including glacial, grus, colluvial, and alluvial grains. The analysis shows that the grains lack typical glacial textures. The surface textures present indicate a complex history. Non-uniformly weathered grain surfaces point to chemical weathering of the source rock. This is supported by the deep weathering of the nonquartz clasts in the sand-sized fraction as well as in boulders at the outcrops. The close correspondence in surface-texture frequencies with those of the alluvial grains indicates an alluvial component to the grains 2 Ì† 7 history. The similarity with the colluvial grains and the outcrops 2 Ì† 7 structures suggest an alluvia/colluvial origin for the deposits. The history indicated by the surface textures agrees with the recent reassessment of the geomorphic {{features and}} points to warm climatic conditions in east-central China for {{at least part of the}} Pleistocene...|$|R
25|$|As {{the climate}} became warmer {{at the end}} of the ice age the snowfields on the moors began to melt. The meltwater was unable to escape northwards, westwards or eastwards because it was blocked by ice. Huge torrents of water were forced southwards. Water from the Esk valley area flowed southwards gouging out the deep Newtondale valley as it went. Water from the moors formed a vast lake in the area of the Vale of Pickering. Eventually this lake filled its basin and then overflowed at the lowest point which was at Kirkham. Here it cut the steep sided Kirkham gorge. When the ice finally retreated it left deep {{deposits}} of <b>boulder</b> <b>clay</b> (or till) behind. The <b>boulder</b> <b>clay</b> blocked the eastern end of the Vale of Pickering causing a permanent deviation in the course of the River Derwent. Alluvium from the glacial meltwater covers many areas to the north of the moors and in the Esk valley.|$|E
25|$|In places, {{stratified}} till and <b>boulder</b> <b>clay</b> {{give rise}} to features of glacial deposition such as eskers, and drumlins that are predominant {{over much of the}} area north and east of Larbert and provide natural transportation routes. As Larbert is not far from the coast, post-glacial features akin to raised beaches are particularly prevalent south and west of the settlement, and this gives rise to differing elevations surrounding the town.|$|E
25|$|The tunnels were {{constructed}} in the late 1970s, using mining techniques, and {{were constructed}} as single-track tubes with a diameter of 4.75 metres. The tunnels under Newcastle were mechanically bored through <b>boulder</b> <b>clay</b> and lined with cast iron or concrete segments. The tunnel under Gateshead, was bored through sandstone and excavated coal seams. Old coal mine workings, some of which dated from the Middle Ages had to be filled in before the tunnelling began.|$|E
50|$|Later in 1920, he was {{appointed}} to the field staff of the Geological Survey in Scotland. He was promoted to Senior Geologist in 1932, and to District Geologist in 1945. He retired in 1954. His work with the Survey fell into two broad categories. He carried out a lot of the early earliest mapping of the Western Highlands and Islands of Scotland, including the Lewisian of Coll and Tiree, the Mesozoic sediments and Tertiary lavas of Morvern and Ardnamurchan, and the Moine Schists of Ardnamurchan, Sunart and South Morar. Some of his most important work concerned the Scottish Coalfields and their associated rocks, in Ayrshire, Dumfriesshire, Dumbartonshire, Lanarkshire and Midlothian, leading to significant upward revisions to reserves estimates. He mapped superficial deposits, in particular the <b>boulder</b> <b>clays</b> of Ayrshire, which led to new time-correlations of glacial events in Scotland and Scandinavia. Some of this work was submitted to the University of Aberdeen for the degree of DSc, which was conferred on him in 1933.|$|R
50|$|At {{the north}} end of the village sit a display of glaciated rocks called the roche moutonnÃ©es. Around 18,000 years ago Dulnain Bridge was covered by a sheet of glacier ice. As the ice moved along it ground down and shaped the rock. As the ice melted, it left smooth, exposed rock in some places and a mixture of <b>boulder</b> and <b>clay</b> in other areas.|$|R
50|$|From a {{geological}} perspective, Derbyshire's solid geology can {{be split}} into two very different halves. The oldest rocks occur in the northern, more upland half of the county, and are mostly of Carboniferous age, comprising limestones, gritstones, sandstones and shales. In its north-east corner {{to the east of}} Bolsover there are also Magnesian Limestone rocks of Permian age. In contrast, the southern and more lowland half of Derbyshire contains much softer rocks, mainly mudstones and sandstones of Permo-Triassic age, which create gentler, more rolling landscapes with few rock outcrops. Across both regions can be found drift deposits of Quaternary age - mainly terrace and river gravel deposits and <b>boulder</b> <b>clays.</b> Landslip features are found on unstable layers of sandstones and shales, with Mam Tor and Alport Castles being the most well-known. Cemented screes and tufa deposits occur very rarely in the limestone dales and rivers, whilst underground cave systems have been created naturally in the limestone since Pleistocene times. The recent discovery of a system near Castleton, named Titan, is now known to have the deepest shaft and biggest chamber of any cave in Britain.|$|R
