500|$|MY10: {{versions}} of the VE were released in September 2009. New 3.0-litre and 3.6-litre V6s have been introduced, featuring Spark Ignition Direct Injection (SIDI) and coupled to a new six-speed automatic transmission (see above). These revised powertrains are marketed as part of Holden's EcoLine range. Visually, all SIDI versions are distinguished by relocated and additional EcoLine badging. 3.0-litre versions now utilise twin exhaust outlets. Updated cars also gain a recalibrated suspension setup and an extra <b>ball-joint</b> in the rear suspension (previously introduced on the Sportwagon); the result is increased tautness and improved handling in models fitted with 18 and 19-inch diameter wheels. These cars are also equipped with a larger [...] rear stabiliser bar. Additional engine bay sound deadening and a new muffler have resulted in reduced noise, vibration, and harshness. Elsewhere, the fitment of lighter low rolling-resistance tyres aids fuel consumption by minimising friction.|$|E

2500|$|An aerial {{telescope}} {{is a type}} of very long focal length refracting telescope, built {{in the second half of}} the 17th century, that did not use a tube.

50|$|Articulated dolls {{go back to}} {{at least}} 200 BCE, with {{articulated}} clay and wooden dolls of ancient Greece and Rome. The modern era ball-jointed doll history began in Western Europe in the late 19th century. From the late 19th century through the early 20th century French and German manufacturers made bisque dolls with strung bodies articulated with <b>ball-joints</b> made of composition: a mix of pulp, sawdust, glue and similar materials. These dolls could measure between 15 and 100 cm and are now collectible antiques.|$|R
50|$|This mutual {{stiffening}} also permits simple construction: Stewart platform hexapods chains use {{prismatic joint}} linear actuators between any-axis universal ball joints. The ball joints are passive: simply free to move, without actuators or brakes; their position is constrained solely {{by the other}} chains. Delta robots have base-mounted rotary actuators that move a light, stiff, parallelogram arm. The effector is mounted between the tips of three of these arms and again, it may be mounted with simple <b>ball-joints.</b> Static representation of a parallel robot is often akin {{to that of a}} pin-jointed truss: the links and their actuators feel only tension or compression, without any bending or torque, which again reduces the effects of any flexibility to off-axis forces.|$|R

50|$|All the {{characters}} were {{built around a}} common Frisbee-throwing gimmick, and for each character there were six different disks available, each with unique designs printed on them. Two standard disks were included with each set - one for the character included, and one for another - {{while the rest of}} the disks were sold separately in randomized supplementary packs. This was the first time Lego attempted to make a product line on the hero-specific collector and trading mechanic, a mechanic that was later refined and reused in Lego RoboRiders in late 1999, and the much more popular and long-lived Bionicle line from 2001. The Bionicle sets are also notable for reusing and evolving the Lego-Technic <b>ball-joints</b> introduced with the Slizers.|$|R
30|$|With any {{external}} fixator system application is simplified by provisional {{reduction of the}} fracture. Many fixator systems purport ease of application through ‘click and fix’ components or <b>ball-joints,</b> but often this freedom of use can result in the assembly of devices that are overly fussy, poorly aligned to the limb and unstable. The application technique here requires the surgeon to achieve a provisional reduction of the MDD: it is often easiest if the limb is under traction (that will achieve {{a significant proportion of}} the fracture reduction anyway) through a traction table or similar device. Fine adjustment of the reduction can be accomplished through the use of tenaculum forceps or provisional use of 2 -mm or 3.2 -mm K-wires that will hold the MDD reduced until ring fixator application is complete.|$|R
5000|$|... ==How It Works == The {{steering}} wheel {{is connected to}} the hydraulic control unit, which contains a slide valve, the control gears and linkage, and the centring piston and cam. The steering rack pinion {{is connected to the}} hydraulic control unit through an adjuster, to allow setting of the centre point of the steering. This then drives one of the control gears, the other being driven by the {{steering wheel}}. The control linkage consists of two gears coupled with rods through <b>ball-joints.</b> When the gears are turned relative to each other, the rods move the slide valve, allowing fluid in or out of the rack. This moves the rack, which in turn moves its pinion, turning the control gears back to their centre position. Compare this with a conventional power steering system, which relies on the flexing of a strong spring to control the valve.|$|R

The most significant feature was much improved handling, that was achieved via new <b>ball-joint</b> front suspension replacing the archaic kingpins. The rear suspension gained new silent blocks and horizontal stabilisation bar. Also new was the reworked double-synchronised 5-speed gearbox. In accordance to Euro II regulations, all vehicles now featured neutralisers.|$|E
5000|$|Robby's bulky {{barrel-shaped}} torso (a sly {{reference to}} Bob Kinoshita's earlier {{job as a}} washing machine designer) featured a front panel fitted with a rectangular flap at the top (into which samples of any substance could be inserted for Robby to analyse and replicate); underneath the slot were two rotating discs fitted with small flashing lights and below that a row of five buttons that moved in and out. Robby's thick, stubby arms were connected to his body with plastic <b>ball-joints</b> that fitted into matching sockets in the torso, allowing the joints {{a small amount of}} rotational movement. The arms could also be slightly extended and this section was covered with a concertina-type tubular rubber sheath. Robby's three-fingered hands were also made of rubber, finished with metallic paint. The chest section attached to the leg section with special locking clips. The bottom section of the suit hinged {{at the top of the}} legs, allowing Robby to both bend forward and swing each leg backward and forward slightly enabling him to walk with relative ease (albeit with rather small and stiff steps). Robby's legs were made from interlocking globes of vacuum-formed plastic which were connected by internal jointing that permitted the entire leg to bend slightly but cleverly concealed the movement of the hips and knees of the human operator inside.|$|R
50|$|The W114/W115 {{models were}} the first post-war Mercedes-Benz {{production}} car to use a newly engineered chassis, not derived from preceding models. The new chassis format of semi-trailing rear arms and <b>ball-joint</b> front end first displayed in the W114/W115 chassis would be used in all new Mercedes passenger car models until {{the development of the}} multi-link rear suspensions of the 1980s. The W108/109 S-Class chassis of the 280S/8, 280SE/8 and 300SEL/8 (and W113 280SL Pagoda) would be the last of the low-pivot swing axle and king pin/double wishbone front ends.

50|$|This {{ability to}} {{fine-tune}} ball-jointed suspension allows manufacturers {{to make the}} automobile more stable and easier to steer, compared to the older kingpin style suspension. It may also be quieter and more comfortable, because lateral and fore and aft compliance in the suspension can be introduced in controlled amounts at the control arm inner pivots without compromising {{the integrity of the}} steering axis pivots, which are now ball joints instead of a king pin and trunnions. The smoother ride may also increase tire tread life, since the <b>ball-joint</b> suspension allows better control of suspension geometry and so can provide better tire-to-road contact.|$|E

This series is usually regarded by most as filler while Hasbro contemplated the next direction for Transformers. However most fans of Transformers recognise that most if not all of the toys released from this line were of excellent quality (with the Optimus Prime and Ultra Magnus figures gaining considerable praise), combining the <b>ball-joint</b> articulation with detailed, well painted alternate modes.|$|E

50|$|At the knuckle end, single {{ball joints}} are {{typically}} used, {{in which case}} the steering loads have to be taken via a steering arm, and the wishbones look A- or L-shaped. An L-shaped arm is generally preferred on passenger vehicles because it allows a better compromise of handling and comfort to be tuned in. The bushing in line with the wheel can be kept relatively stiff to effectively handle cornering loads while the off-line joint can be softer to allow the wheel to recess under fore-aft impact loads. For a rear suspension, a pair of joints can be used {{at both ends of the}} arm, making them more H-shaped in plan view. Alternatively, a fixed-length driveshaft can perform the function of a wishbone as long as the shape of the other wishbone provides control of the upright. This arrangement has been successfully used in the Jaguar IRS. In elevation view, the suspension is a 4-bar link, and it is easy to work out the camber gain (see camber angle) and other parameters for a given set of bushing or <b>ball-joint</b> locations. The various bushings or ball joints do not have to be on horizontal axes, parallel to the vehicle centre line. If they are set at an angle, then anti-dive and anti-squat geometry can be dialled in.|$|E
