40|$|It is now {{considered}} that the information available in <b>bibliographical</b> <b>databases</b> is dated, validated through a long process which {{does not make it}} very innovative. Furthermore, database processing is normally performed using boolean operators : the results obtained from a query provides a sum of expected information which, in itself, does not deliver any novelty. Don Swanson's work demonstrates the unsuspected potential of <b>bibliographical</b> <b>databases</b> in revealing and discovering knowledge. The interest of his approach lies less on the available information itself than on the methodology used to disclose new knowledge. This general methodology fits perfectly well within an environment of validated and structured information, as is the case for bibliographical data. The expression Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) indicates a methodology which creates new knowledge based upon bibliographical data. In this article, we will cover the principals of KDD based on Don Swanson's work as well as the method used to disclose knowledge within biomedical <b>bibliographical</b> <b>databases...</b>|$|R

50|$|A {{variable}} length field {{is not always the}} same physical size. Such fields are nearly always used for text fields that can be large, or fields that vary greatlyin length. For example, a <b>bibliographical</b> <b>database</b> like PubMed has many small fields suchas publication date and author name, but also has abstracts, which vary greatly in length. Reserving a fixed-length field of some length would be inefficient because it would enforce amaximum length on abstracts, and because space would be wasted in most records (particularly if many articles lacked abstracts entirely).|$|E

Each user is assisted by a personal agent that provides help such as: filling in bibliographical records, verifying the correctness of information entered and more importantly, recommendation of relevant bibliographical references. To do this, the personal agent needs to collaborate with its peers in order to get relevant recommendations. Each agent applies a case-based reasoning approach in order to provide peers with requested recommendations. The paper focuses mainly on describing the recommendation computation approach...|$|R

40|$|Can a <b>bibliographical</b> <b>database</b> be {{replaced}} by a repository? Experience gained by an institutional medical library. An academic scholar usually begins the research for literature on a given topic by using the most complete <b>bibliographical</b> <b>database</b> in his/her field of interest. The next step comprises fast and simple access to the source material. Access to a large number of foreign sources, whether or not for a fee (free full text/Open Access), is not a problem. It is more difficult when the search focuses on Polish references, publications produced by a fellow scholar or sometimes the author’s own papers. Aside from computer searches he/she will need to do much else, including library visits and searches in archives, files and other places where published papers are stored. One way to solve such problems is to use a repository of digital documents. This may be a repository of a given university’s works, a subject repository or the collection of a given author. Can a <b>bibliographical</b> <b>database</b> {{be replaced}} by a repository? The author of this paper has made an attempt to answer this question with reference to experience gained by the Scientific Library of the Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine, Łódź, where three databases and one subject repository have been developed...|$|E
