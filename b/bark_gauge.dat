40|$|Thickness of {{the bark}} has serious {{influence}} on the round wood volume inside bark, if the diameter is measured over bark. The measured value of the bark thickness depends on measuring method. To analyse the possible bark thickness differences of spruce, given by different measuring methods and Peintinger´s bark thickness tables and to calculate the corresponding round wood volume differences, given by different bark thickness deduction compared with the Czech Standard is the principle goal of presented research. Three ways of bark thickness measuring were realized: by using <b>bark</b> <b>gauge,</b> increment hammer and slide caliper. <b>Bark</b> <b>gauge</b> gives the highest bark thickness values – 2, 2 mm higher compared with our standard, corresponding volume decrease is 3, 4 %. Measuring by this method is very carefully to the bark and it gives the real values of {{the thickness of the}} undamaged bark layer. It is close to the results of electronic diameter measuring. Slide caliper give the values 0, 9 mm higher compared with our standard, corresponding volume decrease is 1, 5 %. Slide caliper partly damages the surface layer of the bark. Increment hammer gives 0, 1 mm higher values of the bark thickness compared with our standard thanks to the destruction of the surface bark layer. Corresponding volume decrease can be approx. 0, 1 %. Peintinger’s bark thickness tables give 1, 3 mm higher spruce bark thickness, it means to 1, 9 % lower round wood volume. It means, Peintingers tables correspond better with the measured values than with the Czech Standard. We can recommend the using of Peintinger’s table for deduction of spruce bark thickness in electronic measuring of the round wood over bark and to use the <b>bark</b> <b>gauge</b> for test measuring. Both two methods gave the closest results to real values while our tests and it is very simple to use this instrument...|$|E
40|$|Sapwood {{density and}} bark {{thickness}} of Calophyllum inophyllum L. (a multipurpose durable timber species) were studied in various locations in Northern Australia and in Sri Lanka. Measurements were taken non-destructively by using core sampling and <b>bark</b> <b>gauge.</b> From each provenance, 4 – 15 mature trees having girth at breast height over bark (GBHOB) at 100 – 150 cm were selected {{on the basis}} of the population size. Significant (p< 0. 05) hemispheric and provenance variations in bark thickness were found. Variations in the bark thickness are influenced by environmental variables. Variations in sapwood density were less pronounced compared to that of bark thickness. Variations in sapwood density are likely to be governed by genotypic variations...|$|E
30|$|Tree {{height and}} {{diameter}} at breast height (DBH) were recorded at intervals {{in order to}} calculate estimated standing volume at ages 4, 6 and 10  years, using local volume-basal area relationships. Bark thickness of 4 - and 6 -year-old trees was determined using a <b>bark</b> <b>gauge.</b> Volume values for 10 -year trees were extrapolated from destructive sampling of 120 trees from guard rows around each plot in 1982. A single tree per diameter range was selected from each plot for height measurement and data were fitted into the Schumacher Logarithmic Tree Volume Equation (Germishuizen (1979). Results were analysed statistically using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to assess the effect of treatments on volume production and needle nutrient content. Correlations between 10 -year growth and needle nutrient content were determined and analysed using multiple regression (Morris: Trial series B 43 : Site preparation and fertilizer application at time of planting, part 1 : Influence on volume increment, Unpublished).|$|E
40|$|In 2008, {{various aspects}} of the tree stem profile were {{measured}} and 200 bark samples removed from 55 individual stems of beech species at Tosakoti sites in Mazandaran provinces in the north of Iran in the Hyrcanian forest. Hyrcanian forests are located at green strip extending over the northern slopes of Alborz range of mountains and the southern coasts of the Caspian Sea. Bark thickness was measured from each stem with <b>bark</b> <b>gauges</b> at 6 different relative heights. The measured stem variables used in this study are diameter over bark at relative heights 1, 10, 30, 50, 70 and 90 %; bark thickness at the same relative heights; diameter over bark at breast height; bark thickness at breast height; tree height; tree age. In this study, bark amount is expressed either as double bark thickness or as the proportion of over bark diameter or volume. Percent of bark volume of beech trees is about 6. 04 % of tree volume. Average double bark thickness was greatest at the base (1 % relative height) 18 mm and decreased uniformly towards the top (90 % relative height) 8 mm. Bark proportion (from the diameter) decreased from the base to the 20 % relative height being 4 % at its minimum. After that the bark proportion increased first slowly then rapidly being finally 10 % at a relative height of 90 %. The general form of bark curves at different breast height diameter classes is highly similar and therefore we can assume that the general form of a bark curve does not depend on tree size.

50|$|Prior to {{vegetation}} clearing for agriculture, salinity {{was recorded}} as approximately 120-350 mg/L, where <500 mg/L is considered fresh. The Wilgarup, Dombakup and Lefroy sub-catchments were initially cleared around 1925 {{as part of}} the Group Settlement Scheme. Extensive clearing in the 1950s and 1960s resulted in a significant increase in stream salinity, with water quality no longer considered fresh. The Warren catchment was declared a clearing control catchment in 1978 following concerns with rising salinity levels. Following this declaration, intensive revegetation was undertaken within the Perup and Tone River sub-catchments, which account for 60% of the salt load entering the Warren River. Salinity levels are leveling off and clearing within the total catchment is now estimated as 35%. The lower Warren River to the river mouth is considered slightly brackish, with a mean annual salinity of 990 mg/l for the period 1993-2002, measured at <b>Barker</b> Road <b>gauging</b> station. Dombakup Brook is recorded as being fresh (< 440 mg/l).|$|R
40|$|In Africa and {{particularly}} in Côte d'Ivoire, the exploitation of Hevea brasiliensis clones having strong vegetative growth based on the criterion of vigour adopted so far has raised physiological and physical problems characterized by {{a high rate of}} tapping panel dryness and wind damage. A study was conducted on three clones of Hevea brasiliensis (PB 235, GT 1 and PR 107) belonging respectively to classes of fast, moderate and slow vegetative growth, {{in order to determine the}} right moment for an exploitation which would minimize those drawbacks. Trunk measurements, bark collecting and histological sections followed by laticifers counting made on rubber trees aged from one to fifteen years, have enabled to describe the process of establishment of bark and laticifers. The intensity of development and thickening of the bark and the rate of laticifer emission are described respectively by distinct hyperbolic and logistic sigmoid functions. However, their temporal evolution is strongly marked by an irreversible decrease of the whole process of formation, whatever the clone, from six years after planting. Furthermore, the density of laticifers per mm 2 switches, whatever the clone studied, from a number greater than 5, the first six years (5 - 8 < ?lv < 2) to 0. 35 the next 25 years (2 < ?lv < 0. 4). This evolution which is very significant the first six years varies relatively little the rest of time. These results show six years after planting a major phenologic phenomenon, like a physiological maturity, which occurs within the tree. This study has allowed identifying good indicators for determining the age and/or the time when plantations should be tapped in Hevea brasiliensis. These relationships have certain and practical interests insofar as they will allow to determine the maturity of exploitation for plantations which age is unknown by using only a <b>bark</b> <b>gauge</b> to measure bark thickness and a measuring tape to measure the girth.
