40|$|The Portable <b>Beverage</b> <b>Cooler</b> (PBC) {{has been}} {{designed}} to satisfy the need of cooler apparatus that could be carried easily. The utilization of this apparatus was intended to minimize the environmental damage affected by vapour compression refrigeration system using CFCs Refrigerant. The peltier effect from thermoelectric module was utilized in this PBC and called as Thermoelectric Cooler (TEC). Furthermore, heat-sink and fan were needed to ensure the cooling effect continously worked. To achieved the objectives of this machine (portable, environment-friendly, low watt, affordable), the design consideration are heat load, insulating material, weight of components, electric consumption, and dimension of the cooling box. The results of the design shows the PBC cooling box dimension is 6 cm x 6. 5 x 15 cm. The insulation of the PBC cooling box are polyurethane foam and polystyrene expanded with thickness 6 mm and 5. 3 mm, respectively.

40|$|The {{majority}} of beverage manufacturers prefer natural refrigerants over synthetic refrigerant options as the working fluid for their beverage display cooling equipment. The two major refrigerants considered for these light commercial applications are CO 2 (carbon dioxide) and R 290 (propane). CO 2, {{used in a}} transcritical cycle, offers advantages in terms of flammability, however, reduced performance at high ambient temperatures and safety {{issues related to the}} high working pressures need to be addressed in order to design efficient and cost-competitive systems. The challenges encountered with CO 2 are typically no concern for R 290; however, the major risk associated with propane is the flammability of the refrigerant. One way to mitigate the risk is rigorous reduction of refrigerant charge to levels that are substantially below legal limits. This task has been accomplished by employing experimentally validated simulation models {{that can be used to}} reliably predict the refrigerant charge in each component at different ambient conditions. Design and optimization efforts have to be focused on the compressor oil type and charge amount which dissolves large quantities of propane that does not contribute to generating the desired cooling effect. The other component that bears significant potential to reduce refrigerant charge is the condenser; low internal volumes are desired that can provide an optimal balance between required refrigerant charge, heat transfer, and pressure drop. A serpentine style microchannel heat exchanger design featuring low fin density on the air side was developed and implemented. The reduced number of fins on the air side reduces maintenance requirements and allows the system to be used in dusty environments. The improvements along with further optimizations were implemented into a <b>beverage</b> <b>cooler</b> holding 700 cans with a volume of 355 mL per can. The achieved cooling capacity was on the order of 1 kW featuring a propane refrigerant charge of less than 50 g. The performance of the redesigned beverage display cooler was experimentally validated at an ambient temperature of 40 oC and it was found that all of the manufacturers’ pull-down and energy consumption test requirements were successfully achieved...|$|E
25|$|A cool box, cooler, {{portable}} ice chest, chilly bin, or esky {{most commonly}} is an insulated box {{used to keep}} perishable food or <b>beverages</b> <b>cool.</b> Ice cubes, which are very cold, are most commonly placed in it to make the things inside stay cool. Ice packs are sometimes used, as they either contain the melting water inside, or have a gel sealed inside that also stays cold longer than plain water. The cooler was invented in 1951 by Richard C. Laramy of Joliet, Illinois. Laramy filed a patent for the cooler on February 24, 1951 and was issued U.S. patent #2,663,157 on December 22, 1953.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{present study}} proposes an {{evaporative}} refrigerating system {{used to keep}} water or other <b>beverages</b> <b>cool</b> in hot arid regions. The system uses a flow of air that flows around a water container, which is wrapped in a wet fabric. The air before being introduced could be dehumidified and cooled to capture more quantity of water vapour. A mathematical model has been developed to describe the system behaviour and the model has been solved numerically. The effects of many parameters on the system performance have been investigated. Results showed that the suurounding pressure around the tank has a significant effect. A cross-over value of mass flowrate at which the effect of ambient temperature changes is found.

50|$|Pastis is {{normally}} diluted with water before drinking, generally five volumes {{of water for}} one volume of pastis, but often neat pastis is served together with a jug of water for the drinker to blend together according to preference. The resulting decrease in alcohol percentage causes some of the constituents to become insoluble, which changes the liqueur's appearance from dark transparent yellow to milky soft yellow, a phenomenon also present with absinthe and known as the ouzo effect. The drink is consumed cold and considered a refreshment for hot days. Ice cubes can be added (after the water, {{in order to avoid}} crystallization of the anethole in the pastis).

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to measure the effect of {{environmental}} conditions and aid-station beverage- cooling practices on the temperature of competitor beverages. Methods: Environmental and beverage temperatures were measured at three cycling and two run course aid stations at the 2010 Langkawi, Malaysia (MA), and Port Macquarie, Australia (AU), Ironman triathlon events. To measure the specific effect of radiant temperature, additional fluid-filled (600 ml) drink bottles (n = 12) were cooled overnight (C) and then placed in direct sun (n = 6) or shade (n = 6) near to a cycle aid station at AU. Results: During both events, beverage temperature increased over time (p 3 ̆c. 05) as environmental conditions, particularly radiant temperature increased (p 3 ̆c. 05). Mean beverage temperature ranged between 14 - 26 °C and during both events was above the palatable range (15 - 22 °C) for extended periods. At AU, bottles placed in direct sunlight heated faster (6. 9 ± 2. 3 °C·h- 1) than those in the shade (4. 8 ± 1. 1 °C·h - 1, p =. 05). Conclusion: Simple changes to Ironman aidstation practices, including shade and chilling beverages with ice, result in the provision of <b>cooler</b> <b>beverages.</b> Future studies should investigate whether provision of <b>cool</b> <b>beverages</b> at prolonged endurance events influences heat-illness incidence, beverage-consumption patterns, and competitor performance. 2013 Human Kinetics, Inc...|$|R
2500|$|The {{seasonal}} harvesting of {{snow and}} ice is an ancient practice estimated to have begun earlier than 1000 B.C. A Chinese collection of lyrics from this time period known as the Shijing, describes religious ceremonies for filling and emptying ice cellars. However, {{little is known about}} the construction of these ice cellars or what the ice was used for. The next ancient society to harvest ice may have been the Jews according to the book of Proverbs, which reads, “As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to them who sent him.” [...] Historians have interpreted this to mean that the Jews used ice to <b>cool</b> <b>beverages</b> rather than to preserve food. Other ancient cultures such as the Greeks and the Romans dug large snow pits insulated with grass, chaff, or branches of trees as cold storage. [...] Like the Jews, the Greeks and Romans did not use ice and snow to preserve food, but primarily as a means to <b>cool</b> <b>beverages.</b> The Egyptians also developed methods to <b>cool</b> <b>beverages,</b> but in lieu of using ice to cool water, the Egyptians cooled water by putting boiling water in shallow earthen jars and placing them on the roofs of their houses at night. Slaves would moisten the outside of the jars and the resulting evaporation would cool the water. [...] The ancient people of India used this same concept to produce ice. [...] The Persians stored ice in a pit called a Yakhchal and may have been the first group of people to use cold storage to preserve food. In the Australian outback before a reliable electricity supply was available where the weather could be hot and dry, many farmers used a [...] "Coolgardie safe". This consisted of a room with hessian [...] "curtains" [...] hanging from the ceiling soaked in water. The water would evaporate and thereby cool the hessian curtains and thereby the air circulating in the room. This would allow many perishables such as fruit, butter, and cured meats to be kept that would normally spoil in the heat.|$|R
