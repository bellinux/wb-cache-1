5|$|The Bill {{had a large}} regular cast {{to support}} the number of episodes that were {{produced}} each year. Working on The Bill had <b>become</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a comical joke in British acting, with 174 actors having formed part of the series' main cast since the series began. A number of cast members have played multiple roles in the series, and in other British soap operas and dramas.|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} {{has also}} <b>become</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a cultural symbol {{representative of the}} North American video game crash of 1983, often cited as a cautionary tale about the hubris of poor business practices, despite suggestions that the burial allowed the company to write off the disposed-of material for tax relief purposes.|$|E

5|$|During World War I, Constantine I {{followed}} a formal policy of neutrality, {{yet he was}} openly benevolent towards Germany, which was fighting alongside Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire against the Triple Entente of Russia, France and Britain. Constantine was the brother-in-law of Kaiser Wilhelm II, and had also <b>become</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a Germanophile following his military training in Prussia. His pro-German attitude provoked a split between the monarch and the prime minister, Eleftherios Venizelos, who wanted to support the Entente {{in the hope of}} expanding Greek territory to incorporate the Greek minorities in the Ottoman Empire and the Balkans. Protected by the countries of the Entente, particularly France, in 1916 Venizelos formed a parallel government to that of the king.|$|E
5|$|The {{design that}} Pei {{developed}} for the Bank of China Tower was not only unique in appearance, but also sound enough to pass the city's rigorous standards for wind-resistance. The tower was planned around a visible truss structure, which distributed stress to {{the four corners of}} the base. Using the reflective glass that had <b>become</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a trademark for him, Pei organized the facade around a series of boxed X shapes. At the top, he designed the roofs at sloping angles to match the rising aesthetic of the building. Some influential advocates of feng shui in Hong Kong and China criticized the design, and Pei and government officials responded with token adjustments.|$|E
5|$|Announcing his Cabinet on 17 December 1962, Field named Smith his Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Treasury. Two days later, RA Butler, the British Deputy Prime Minister and First Secretary of State, {{announced}} that the UK government would allow Nyasaland to leave the Federation. With Northern Rhodesia now also under a secessionist black nationalist government—Kenneth Kaunda and Harry Nkumbula had formed a coalition to keep the UFP out—and Southern Rhodesia under the RF, the Federation was effectively over. The Field Cabinet made Southern Rhodesian independence on Federal dissolution its first priority, but the Conservative government in the UK was reluctant to grant this under the 1961 constitution as it knew doing so would lead to censure and loss of prestige in the United Nations (UN) and the Commonwealth. Indeed, Southern Rhodesia's minority government had already <b>become</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> an embarrassment to the UK and it hurt Britain's reputation to even {{maintain the status quo}} there. Granting independence without major constitutional reform would furthermore provoke outcry from the Conservatives' main parliamentary opposition, the Labour Party, which was strongly anti-colonial and supportive of black nationalist ambitions.|$|E

25|$|The {{phenomenon}} of Messianic Judaism has <b>become</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> an irritant to Jewish / Christian relations. Messianic Jews—who generally seek to combine a Jewish identity with {{the recognition of}} Jesus—are rejected by mainstream Jewish groups, who dismiss Messianic Judaism {{as little more than}} Christianity with Jewish undertones.|$|E

25|$|In some areas, {{particularly}} the American South, turkeys {{may also be}} deep fried in hot oil (often peanut oil) for 30 to 45 minutes by using a turkey fryer.

25|$|The film also {{spawned the}} Star Wars Holiday Special, which debuted on CBS on November 17, 1978 {{and is often}} {{considered}} a failure; Lucas himself disowned it. The special has never been aired after its original broadcast, and {{it has never been}} officially released on home video. However, many bootleg copies exist, and the special has consequently <b>become</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> an underground legend.|$|E

25|$|One {{fragment}} of the meteorite {{was said to}} have landed on a dog, as observed by a farmer named Mohammed Ali Effendi Hakim in the village of Denshal supposedly vaporizing the animal instantly.

However, the story of the Nakhla dog has <b>become</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a legend among astronomers.|$|E
25|$|Polish {{science fiction}} writing {{has not had}} much impact on {{non-print}} media like cinema, television and computer games, although several science fiction, fantasy and horror films and games {{have been made in}} Poland.

In 2011, Stagecoach Manchester who operated the Metrolink under contract to Transport for Greater Manchester, sold the contract to the RATP Group.|$|E
25|$|Harmonia axyridis (the {{harlequin}} ladybird) is {{an example}} of how an animal might be partly welcome and partly harmful. It was introduced into North America from Asia in 1916 to control aphids, but is now the most common species, outcompeting many of the native species. It has since spread to much of western Europe, reaching the UK in 2004. It has <b>become</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a domestic and agricultural pest in some regions, and gives cause for ecological concern. It has similarly arrived in parts of Africa, where it has proved variously unwelcome, perhaps most prominently in vine-related crops.|$|E
25|$|Hans Christian Ørsted was an {{old family}} friend and {{arranged}} for Colding to serve an apprenticeship under a craftsman in Copenhagen, Colding achieving the status of journeyman in 1836.

The Institute had been founded at Ørsted's initiative and he offered continual advice and support to the young Colding. At the polytechnic Colding showed the most undaunted diligence and the most conscientious precision and in 1839 Ørsted engaged Colding to assist on some exacting measurements of the release of heat by compressed water.|$|E
