6000|$|... "Yes," [...] replied Mary; [...] "the {{experiments}} {{are to be}} on oscillations; <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> principally to teach you, is, {{the proper way to}} make experiments." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't say you did, Bob. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> {{you to do}} is to tell me {{everything}} that you know. Was there anybody in this office during my absence?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Joe; <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to say, was, {{that as we}} {{are rather}} slack just now, if you {{would give me a}} half-holiday to-morrow, I think I would go up-town and make a call on Miss Est--Havisham." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well; if {{it must be}} so, it must; <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to say to you}} is this: {{while you}} were away, I was {{thinking}} about what you said of the farm--of being a tenant of mine, you know." ...|$|R
50|$|Lopez Museum “is a very {{traditional}} institution, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to do was}} to explore ways to use new media and more visual learning. <b>I</b> also <b>wanted</b> to make the Museum more visible in all our network’s platforms—TV, radio and glossies (magazines)”, Director Vargas relates.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes, that's good logic, {{provided}} you're after that. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> here is spring-time--just a fresh, alert, lovely fragment. This {{pure line}} {{must be kept}} free from any earthiness." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Truly {{it is both}} {{food and}} rest that I want, at the proper times, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> with you now, is {{to take me to}} your own room, and let me talk to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dont be indignant: I {{knew you}} would stick up for me in your own way. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to shew is, that only three people {{believed}} that I was in earnest; and those three were prejudiced." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I did," [...] said Ludlow, [...] "and {{nobody seemed}} to know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was after. I wonder if they would in Pymantoning! <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to ask was that you would {{try to look at}} it from the Pymantoning point of view. I hope you haven't lost that yet?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, sir, I {{was always}} hoping that I could turn them right again, {{so as you}} wouldn't need to be troubled at all. And so it went {{from bad to worse}} until we find {{ourselves}} here. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to ask you, Mr. Crosse, was what you meant to do about it?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My story," [...] {{concluded}} {{the young man}} with an Agency, [...] "may lack the literary quality; <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> it to show is that the young lady remained true. She cared nothing for wealth in comparison with true affection. I admire and believe in the fair sex too much to think otherwise." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No doubt, my dear fellow," [...] said Mackinnon; [...] "that {{would be}} a dignified and {{pleasant}} ending to the affair. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to know is this;--what {{would you have done}} if she had agreed to go?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, of course--we {{all know}} that it was you broke off the other match; all the world knows that. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to speak about is this. The old gentleman's money, George! Now Sir Henry of course is looking to that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know it was}} put off; {{of course}} it was put off. I didn't suppose any respectable lawyer in London would have dreamed of doing such a thing. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to know is, how it was put off. What did Mr Slow say?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Not altogether, sir. I think I {{could work}} out the {{latitude}} and longitude if I knew something about a quadrant, but I have never seen one, and {{have no idea of}} its use. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to ask you first of all was the meaning of some of these words which I cannot find in the dictionary.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Clara is more caressing," [...] said Marian. [...] "I think I am most fond of her, though Caroline is--O! {{quite another}} thing. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> {{was to ask}} you, Mrs. Wortley, if you thought I might write to poor Miss Morley, and ask if there is {{anything}} I can do for her. I can't bear to think of her going away without wishing her good-bye, or showing any feeling for her in her distress." ...|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} in 2007 on the Food Is Not Love podcast, {{she said that the}} song [...] "February" [...] from Mortal City is one of her songs that she likes best. She referred to the way the song [...] "kept on evolving into, not only <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to say, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to say and didn't even know was in there." [...] She liked the way the song [...] "kept on breaking its own rules in a way that art is all about." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Raff, {{from what}} I hear, doesn't take kindly to them," [...] he temporized, [...] "and you've {{certainly}} set the dry bones rattling for many a day. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> {{to know is}} if other American women are as successful in business ventures?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So I understand," [...] Tyrrel went on. [...] "Your name, I'm told, carries {{everything}} before it. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> {{to suggest}} now is simply this-- How much will you take, money {{down on the}} nail, this minute, to withdraw your own design from the informal competition?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mart grinned. [...] "I reckon that's so. I said I'd cut you in two when I grew up; all boys {{say such}} things, but I reckon your whalin' did me good. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> {{to know is}} this, {{can you tell me}} where to find the old man?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah! I can't arguy wi' you, Mr. Tryan; <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to say's this--There's {{my little}} chacenut hoss; I {{should take it}} quite a {{kindness}} if you'd hev him through the winter an' ride him. I've thought o' sellin' him a many times, for Mrs. Jerome can't abide him; and <b>what</b> do <b>I</b> <b>want</b> wi' two nags? But I'm fond o' the little chacenut, an' I shouldn't like to sell him. So if you'll only ride him for me, you'll do me a kindness--you will, indeed, Mr. Tryan.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{mean that}} there is a shadow of {{something}} colossal and menacing that even now is beginning to fall across the land. Call it the shadow of an oligarchy, if you will; it is the nearest I dare approximate it. What its nature may be I refuse to imagine.* <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to say was this: You are in a perilous position--a peril that my own fear enhances because I am not able even to measure it. Take my advice and accept the vacation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{stuck up}} for ye ez far ez they could. But ye see the parson hez got a holt upon Seth, havin' caught him kissin' a convert at camp meeting; and Deacon Turner knows suthin about Mrs. Rivers's sister, who kicked over the pail and jumped the fence years ago, and she's afeard a' him. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to tell ye was that they're all comin' {{up here to}} take a look at ye--some on 'em to-night. You ain't afeard, are ye?" [...] she added, with a loud laugh.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, well! I shall {{do it in}} time. But, Miss--Mary, ha! ha! ha! never mind, let me alone. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to say is this: do {{you think}} I could drop it? Hannah says, that if I go the right way about it she is sure I can." ...|$|E
60|$|ERNEST (hurriedly). I didn't mean {{it in that}} way. (He goes chivalrously on his knees.) Ah, Tweeny, I don't undervalue the bucket, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to say now is {{that the}} sweet {{refinement}} of a dear girl has done more for me than any bucket could do.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{official}} police don't need you, Mr. Holmes, to {{tell them}} that the carpet must have been turned round. That's clear enough, for the stains lie above each other--if you lay it over this way. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to know is, who shifted the carpet, and why?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dat is imposserbul," [...] {{answered}} Josh; [...] "derefore I {{says it is}} n't true. I surposes {{you know}} dat what is imposserbul is n't true, Simon. Nobody can't be out yonder and down here at de same time. Dat is imposserble, Simon. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wants</b> to intermate to you, will explain all dis difficulty; and it do show de raal super'ority of a coloured man over de white poperlation. Now, you mark my words, cook, and be full of admiration! Jack Tier came back along wid de Mexican gentle'em, in my anchor-watch, dis very night! You see, in de first place, ebbery t'ing come to pass in nigger's watch." ...|$|R
500|$|... "I don't <b>want</b> any compensation. <b>I</b> don't <b>want</b> money, <b>I</b> don't <b>want</b> {{a trip to}} Mecca, <b>I</b> don't <b>want</b> a house. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> nothing. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> {{absolutely}} <b>want</b> is {{the punishment}} of the Americans. This is my demand, my demand, my demand and my demand," [...] said one villager, whose brother was killed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Alton quietly. [...] "It wasn't always easy, {{and they}} didn't come to me, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> knew <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted,</b> and <b>I</b> usually got it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{has offered}} to take her--she's dying to have Isabel go. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> her to do when she gets her there is {{to give her a}}ll the advantages. I'm sure all we've got to do," [...] said Mrs. Ludlow, [...] "is to give her a chance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{not at all}} {{surprised}} to hear this, Bolt; <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> at present is {{to know what you}} think may be the precise position of the lugger, without the aid of the thermometer and of logarithms; I've a notion you would make out better by letting such things alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's nothing I {{understand}} so well, always, as {{the things}} I needn't! <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to do, you see," [...] he went on, [...] "is {{to put it}} to your conscience that you've an admirable opportunity; and that it's moreover one for which, after all, damn you, you've really to thank me." ...|$|E
50|$|The film {{changed my}} identity. <b>I</b> {{realized}} that <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to do was}} make films. Not only that, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> realized <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to make films about: my own life, to some extent.|$|R
5000|$|Rhodes {{described}} his {{hopes for the}} restaurant on launch: [...] "If we never get a Michelin star here, I will be very disappointed, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> really <b>want</b> is customers."

6000|$|... "Oh! but I hope," [...] Harry said, [...] "that {{grandfather}} won't {{make any}} difference to any one because of me. What would be the use of much money to me.
