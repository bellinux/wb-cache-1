PBB does not specify how <b>B-MAC</b> addresses are learned and PBB may use a spanning tree to control the B-VLAN. In SPBM the main difference is that <b>B-MAC</b> address are distributed or computed in the control plane, eliminating the <b>B-MAC</b> learning in PBB.

The only difference compared with classical Ethernet is that reverse learning is disabled for participating bridge backbone media access control (<b>B-MAC)</b> addresses and is replaced with an ingress check and discard (when the frame arrives on an incoming interface from an unexpected source). Learning is however implemented {{at the edges of}} the SPBM multicast tree to learn the <b>B-MAC</b> to MAC address relationship for correct individual frame encapsulation in the reverse direction (as packets arrive over the Interface).|$|E

50|$|In SPBM, the Backbone MAC (<b>B-MAC)</b> {{addresses}} {{of the participating}} nodes and also the service membership information for interfaces to non-participating devices (user network interface (UNI) ports) is distributed. Topology data is then input to a calculation engine which computes symmetric shortest path trees based on minimum cost from each participating node to all other participating nodes. In SPBV these trees provide a shortest path tree where individual MAC address can be learned and Group Address membership can be distributed. In SPBM the shortest path trees are then used to populate forwarding tables for each participating node's individual <b>B-MAC</b> addresses and for Group addresses; Group multicast trees are sub trees of the default shortest path tree formed by (Source, Group) pairing. Depending on the topology several different equal cost multi path trees are possible and SPB supports multiple algorithms per IS-IS instance.|$|E

It is interesting to highlight that the performance gain that SB-MAC offers over <b>B-MAC</b> increases with increase in contending population size.

30|$|We also track {{total energy}} of the network in the {{simulation}} in Fig. 4. By using duty-cycle protocol, the system achieves better energy efficiency compared to no duty-cycle solution (CSP with ARPEES). In the first 10 s of our simulations (initial phase of default configuration and configuration with <b>B-MAC),</b> the duty cycle is disabled for network initialization. During this interval, the power consumption {{is much higher than}} duty-cycle period. Result from this simulation shows that <b>B-MAC</b> has slightly better power consumption compared to two other cases. It {{is important to note that}} at any time, most of the nodes in network are in ACTIVE state and the total energy consumption of network is caused mainly by consumption of ACTIVE nodes. This consumption depends on the ratio of duration of transceiver in RX mode/duration of transceiver in IDLE mode. This ratio of CSP using <b>B-MAC</b> is very low because each node only needs to stay in RX mode to complete a CCA. In CSP, transceiver has to stay in RX mode to wait for a complete MAC packet. Therefore, the ratio of CSP using <b>B-MAC</b> is shorter than that of CSP.|$|E
30|$|The {{number of}} {{applications}} of IEEE 802.11 -based broadcast networks has continuously been increasing. The accurate characterization of underlying MAC protocols in such networks is essential not only to analyze their performance, but also to identify ways to upgrade and optimize them. In response to this need, Ma and Chen [8] have provided a simple analytical model for <b>B-MAC,</b> which has been further enhanced by Wang and Hassan [9]. Even though these models accurately estimate the performance of <b>B-MAC,</b> they cannot directly be used to characterize the performance of SB-MAC because SB-MAC not only incorporates the nonuniform CSSD, but also adds the concept of resetting the backoff counter when it finds a channel busy instead of freezing it as in the conventional <b>B-MAC.</b> Therefore, in this article, a new analytical model is proposed which accommodates both these modifications and has a simple closed-form solution.|$|E

The results from Fig. 6 also prove that CSP achieves the best performance of tracking accuracy, compared to CSP using <b>B-MAC</b> and CSP using ARPEES.

30|$|Without a low-duty-cycle MAC and routing in a {{communication}} protocol, {{it is difficult}} for all previous work to assure low latency associated with energy efficiency and tracking accuracy. VigilNet [1] is {{one of the very few}} real-world tracking systems that simultaneously addresses energy efficiency, end-to-end real-time tracking, and accuracy by implementing a complete communication protocol of <b>B-MAC</b> [13] (as a low-duty-cycle MAC) associated with a Voronoi diagram [22] (as a routing algorithm). This system divides end-to-end delay into multiple sub-deadlines, each guaranteed by one system component. Wake-up, aggregation, and multi-hop delays are controlled by the <b>B-MAC</b> protocol and Voronoi diagram (that requires the employment of multiple BSs). Thus, the hard real-time property of the system is guaranteed at the expense of numerous BSs and increased price. However, VigilNet has not been evaluated regarding the performance of end-to-end delay by considering critical parameters of the communication protocol. In addition, the long-preamble approach of <b>B-MAC</b> still causes energy inefficiency and unnecessary delay compared to short-preamble approaches, especially when the hop count is high.|$|E
40|$|A typical {{wireless}} {{sensor node}} has little protection against radio jamming.

Encrypting the packets may help prevent the jammer from taking actions based on the content of the packets, but the temporal arrangement of the packets induced {{by the nature of the}} protocol might unravel patterns that the jammer can take advantage of even when the packets are encrypted. By looking at the packet interarrival times in three representative MAC protocols, S-MAC, LMAC and <b>B-MAC,</b> we derive several jamming attacks that allow the jammer to jam S-MAC, LMAC and <b>B-MAC</b> energy-efficiently. The jamming attacks are based on realistic assumptions. The algorithms, using expectation maximization in case of S-MAC, or K-means in case of LMAC, or low-power listening in case of <b>B-MAC,</b> are described in detail and simulated. The effectiveness and efficiency of the attacks are examined. The result of this investigation provides new insights into the security considerations of MAC protocols...|$|E
40|$|We {{take two}} new {{approaches}} to design efficient algorithms for transmitter optimization under rate constraints in order to guarantee the Quality of Service for MIMO <b>B-MAC</b> interference networks. A <b>B-MAC</b> network is a generalized interference network that {{is a combination of}} multiple interfering broadcast channels (BC) and multiaccess channels (MAC). Two related optimization problems, maximizing the minimum of weighted rates under a sum-power constraint and minimizing the sum-power under rate constraints, are considered. The first approach takes advantage of existing algorithms for SINR problems by building a bridge between rate and SINR through the design of optimal mappings between them. The second approach exploits the polite water-filling structure, which is the network version of water-filling satisfied by all the Pareto optimal input of a large class of achievable regions of <b>B-MAC</b> networks. It replaces most generic optimization algorithms currently used for such networks and reduces the complexity while demonstrating superior performance even in non-convex cases.
