6000|$|... "It was dark, sir, and I couldn't see {{not to say}} properly; <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> me my {{frank and}} private opinion I should say couple of 'undred." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have done}} no worse, I have not disgraced you. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> me whether I have loved him, or do love him, I tell you plainly, father, {{that it may}} be so. I don't know.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{no right}} to express an opinion as to where my father should or should not go; <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> me, I think that, under all the circumstances, you would do best to keep away." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> the nymph why {{she worked}} on for ever, she could not tell you. For like the Nymphs of old, and the Hamadryads who lived, in trees, and Undine, and the little Sea-maiden, she would have no soul; no reason; no power to say why.|$|R
5000|$|... "Gauci was {{not quite}} the full shilling. I think even his family would say (that he) was an apple short of a picnic. He was quite a tricky guy. I don't think he was {{deliberately}} lying <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> him the same question three times he would just get irritated and refuse to answer." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>But,</b> then, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> it, [...] We lived {{greatly in}} our turn; [...] We were grand and glorious, Gino, [...] Ere our friends up there were born! ...|$|R
6000|$|DAWKER. [Grinning] Safe for the moment. The old lady'll {{put it up}} to auction. Couldn't get her {{to budge}} from that. Says she don't want to be unneighbourly to either. <b>But,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> me, it's money she smells! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good," [...] said young Jolyon; [...] "it's {{exactly what}} I've always said. By-the-bye, {{have you noticed}} that {{whenever}} one says 'Good,' one always adds 'it's exactly what I've always said'! <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> me how I do it, I answer, because I'm a Forsyte." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you know, Mr. Finn, I {{think you}} have begun at the wrong end. I thought so before, and I think so still. I suppose I ought not to say so to a Lord of the Treasury, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> me, what can I do?" ...|$|E
60|$|Give a man a tolerably fair {{memory to}} start with, and {{piloting}} will develop {{it into a}} very colossus of capability. But ONLY IN THE MATTERS IT IS DAILY DRILLED IN. A time would come when the man's faculties could not help noticing landmarks and soundings, and his memory could not help holding on to them with {{the grip of a}} vise; <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> that same man at noon what he had had for breakfast, it would be ten chances to one that he could not tell you. Astonishing things can be done with the human memory <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will devote it faithfully to one particular line of business.|$|R
5000|$|A woman, recounting a {{story about}} {{an old man who}} used to answer all her [...] "stupid questions", {{explained}} [...] "Chica, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> a question it makes you look stupid for 5 minutes - <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>ask</b> - <b>you</b> stay stupid for fifty years, so always ask questions in your life".|$|R
6000|$|... "Upon my word, it {{is a very}} {{unpleasant}} {{thing to}} have to say; <b>but</b> really, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> me, I should remark that Mr. Cranley's enemies are of his own making. I would not go to him for a girl's character, I'm sure. But I thought he had disappeared from society." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I? I didn't {{know that}} I was," [...] he answered. [...] "I {{supposed}} I was pretty well. I dare say I {{ought to be}} ashamed of showing it in that way. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> me, well, I will tell you; I don't find it any easier than I did at first." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It may be," [...] {{answered}} Leonard; [...] "but as I am not {{an equation}} in algebra yearning to be worked out, I don't quite see the fun of it. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> me what I think she will do, I should say that she will {{follow the example of}} everybody else and desert me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, Mrs. Roberts, that is {{just what}} I used to say of Samuel, {{but he was the}} biggest brute in the three kingdoms, for all that; <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> me, meaning no offence, I call a man a brute as only comes to see his lawful wife about twice a month, let alone making an angel cry." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lawford turned. 'Look here, Sheila,' {{he began}} heavily, 'what about Alice? <b>If</b> <b>you</b> wired: well, it's useless to say {{anything}} more. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> didn't, I <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> just this one thing. Don't tell her!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are Detective Harvey, {{sent by the}} {{inspector}} at New York in answer to a telegram I wired this morning. To give him perfect confidence in you I will say further that at present he is confined for passing counterfeit money, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> should <b>ask</b> to have him released I guarantee that the charge will be withdrawn. Are you satisfied now, my boy?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Then Lynette {{regarded}} Sir Launcelot {{for a while}} {{very seriously}} and anon she said, [...] "Messire, I pray you tell me who you are who take me thus to task." [...] And at that Sir Launcelot laughed again and said: [...] "Damsel, I will not tell you my name, <b>but</b> mayhap <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> my name of this worthy gentleman who is with you, he {{will tell you what}} it is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have heard}} no tidings; <b>but,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> for my opinion, I think {{something}} has happened. A certain lady {{seems to have}} been ruffled, and a certain gentleman has disappeared. I am inclined to think that a few unsuccessful words have been spoken." [...] Gerard Maule saw that there was a smile in her eye, and he was satisfied.|$|E
6000|$|All denied it. When {{it came to}} Tom Scudamore's turn, he said. [...] "You {{never do}} believe me, Mr. Jones, so it is of no use my saying that I didn't do it; <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> Miss Scudamore, she will bear witness {{that we were in}} bed hours before, and that there are bars on our windows through which a cat could hardly get." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why {{should we}} lead you into strange dangers, O Man of the Mountains," [...] he grunted--"maybe to death? <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> {{to come with}} us, if we have only to choose, how can I and my {{brothers}} say no? We will at least be friends who do not part while danger is near, and though we never reach the Valley, Tishnar befriends the Meermuts of the brave. Let us, then, go on together." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Quite so. In dress now, for example. We are faddy people, <b>you</b> know--faddy <b>but</b> kind-hearted. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> were <b>asked</b> to wear any dress {{which we}} might give you, {{you would not}} object to our little whim. Heh?' ...|$|R
40|$|Think of {{the color}} spectrum, spread out before you. You can {{identify}} the different colors with ease. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> are <b>asked</b> to indicate {{the point at which}} one color ends and the next begins, you are at a loss. "There is no such point", is a natural thought: one color just shades gradually into the next. Citation: Edgington, D. (2001). 'The philosophical problem of vagueness', Law Theory, 7 (4), 371 - 378.

6000|$|... "It simply isn't to {{be thought}} of, Aunty Nan," [...] said Mrs. William Morrison decisively. Mrs. William Morrison {{was one of those}} people who always speak decisively. If they merely {{announce}} that they are going to peel the potatoes for dinner their hearers realize that there is no possible escape for the potatoes. Moreover, these people are always given their full title by everybody. William Morrison was called Billy oftener than not; <b>but,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> had <b>asked</b> for Mrs. Billy Morrison, nobody in Avonlea would have known what you meant at first guess.|$|R
60|$|<b>But,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> {{how such}} an absurd story {{could ever have}} been made up, whether there is the least {{foundation}} to make it on, I answer, {{that it is the}} exaggerated report of a movement made by the present Duke of Sutherland's father, in the year 1811, and which was part of a great movement that passed through, the Highlands of Scotland, when the advancing progress of civilization began to make it necessary to change the estates from military to agricultural establishments.|$|E
60|$|There can be {{no doubt}} that the {{behaviour}} of the French priests in this war has enormously diminished anti-clerical bitterness in France. There {{can be no}} doubt that France is far more a religious country than it was before the war. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> whether that means any return to the church, any reinstatement of the church, the answer is a doubtful one. Religion and the simple priest are stronger in France to-day; the church, I think, is weaker.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is their}} own affair, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> my opinion I do {{not approve of}} it," [...] Sir Timothy replied. [...] "I am {{indifferent}} upon the subject, because I am indifferent upon {{the subject of the}} generality of your sex," [...] he added, with a little smile, [...] "but I simply hold {{that it is not a}} taste which should be developed in women, and if they do develop it, it is at the expense of those very qualities which make them most attractive." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Chug-a-rum!" [...] said Grandfather Frog, folding {{his hands}} across his white and yellow waistcoat, [...] "if you will sit still until I finish, I'll tell you; <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> move or <b>ask</b> any foolish questions, I'll stop right where I am, and you'll never hear {{the end of}} the story, for no one else knows it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Counter try - If {{responder}} cannot bid game {{based on}} opener's game try suit, {{but has a}} good holding in a different suit, this can be bid as a counter try provided it can be bid at a level below 3 of the agreed suit, thus 1 - 2; 2 - 3 is allowable but 1 - 2; 3 - 4 is not. This in effect says, [...] "I cannot accept the invitation based on your suit, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> had <b>asked</b> in this suit, I would have." [...] Opener can then re-evaluate based on this new information and either sign off or bid game.|$|R
60|$|Trent smiled very faintly, {{but he said}} nothing. He {{was sitting}} cross-legged with his back {{against one of the}} poles which {{supported}} the open hut, with his eyes fixed upon the cloud of mist hanging over a distant swamp. A great yellow moon had stolen over the low range of stony hills--the mist was curling away in little wreaths of gold. Trent was watching it, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> had <b>asked</b> him he would have told you that he was wondering when the alligators came out to feed, and how near the village they ventured. Looking at his hard, square face and keen, black eyes no one would surely have credited him with any less material thoughts.|$|R
60|$|I {{can only}} give you {{qualified}} and cautious answer. There are, by {{differences in their}} own character, Dominican clouds, and there are Franciscan;--there are the Black Hussars of the Bandiera della Morte, {{and there are the}} Scots Grays whose horses can run upon the rock. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> me, as I would have you ask me, why argent and why sable, how baptized in white like a bride or a novice, and how hooded with blackness like a Judge of the Vehmgericht Tribunal,--I leave these questions with you, and pass on.|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here, my darling. I'm awfully fond of you, {{and think}} you the prettiest {{little girl in}} the world. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> impertinent {{questions}} I'll never speak to you again. Do you understand?" [...] She looked up into his face, and did understand {{that he was in}} earnest, and, leaving him, walked slowly across the meadow back to the house alone. [...] "Tell them not to wait lunch for me," [...] he hollowed after her;--and she told her aunt Julia that cousin Frederic was very sulky down by the river, and that they were not to wait for him.|$|E
60|$|My {{father is}} kind, {{in his own}} odd way--and learned, and rich--a more high-minded and honorable man (as I {{have every reason to}} believe) doesn't live. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> me which he prefers, his books or his son, I hope I do him no {{injustice}} when I answer, his books. His reading and his writing are obstacles between us which I {{have never been able to}} overcome. This is the more to be regretted because he is charming, on the few occasions when I find him disengaged. If you wish I knew more about my father, we are in complete agreement as usual--I wish, too.|$|E
6000|$|... "Lady Arabella, sir, is {{a charming}} woman, and I should have deemed it a {{privilege}} to meet her--to talk to her--even--since I am in the confessional--to flirt a little with her. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> mean to <b>ask</b> <b>if</b> my affections are in any way engaged, I can emphatically answer 'No!'--as indeed you will understand when presently I give you the reason. Apart from that, there are the unpleasant details we discussed the other day." ...|$|R
6000|$|I can't {{state in}} figures (not very well remembering {{how to get}} beyond a million) the number of {{candidates}} for the Sanatorium matronship, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will <b>ask</b> your little boy to trace figures in the beds of your garden, beginning at the front wall, {{going down to the}} cricket-ground, coming back to the wall again, and [...] "carrying over" [...] to the next door, and will then set a skilful accountant to add up the whole, the product, as the Tutor's Assistants say, will give you the amount required. I have pledged myself (being assured of her capability) to support a near relation of Miss E----'s; otherwise, I need not say how glad I should have been to forward any wish of yours.|$|R
6000|$|... "Upon my soul, sir," [...] {{replied the}} spectre {{with an air}} of bewilderment, [...] "I have never even heard the names of these various objects to which you refer, and so I am quite unable to answer your question. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> mean to <b>ask</b> whether I have {{something}} beating just under my fob (excuse the antiquated word, but as I wear the thing in question I must necessarily use the name), why then, most undoubtedly I have." ...|$|R
