5|$|In Wonder Boy in Monster Land, players control Wonder Boy as he {{destroys the}} monsters in Monster Land and defeats the MEKA dragon. When the player begins the game, Wonder Boy starts {{out in the}} City of Wonder Land without any items or gold, but {{to give him a}} chance, at the {{beginning}} of the game, the city's mayor gives him a sword and a revival potion and sets him off on his own. The game is divided into twelve levels, and each of them has its own unique features, items, monsters, and secrets. These levels include towns, valleys, deserts, islands, and castles. Players use the D-pad to move Wonder Boy on the main screen, to enter doors <b>by</b> <b>pressing</b> upward, and to use Magic Weapons <b>by</b> <b>pressing</b> downward. The D-pad is also used to select between various items when in a shop. Players also have two buttons: one which makes Wonder Boy attack with his sword and buy items in the shop; and one which makes Wonder Boy jump and skip through storylines.|$|E

30|$|Boards were {{produced}} by using SP adhesive, which contains styrene-butadiene rubber and polyethylene glycol as major constituents. The use of polyethylene {{in place of}} clay, {{which is also a}} generally used constituent of SP adhesive, was confirmed to improve board properties. In general, the properties of boards are poorer when produced <b>by</b> two-stage <b>pressing,</b> in which mats are first processed by temporary adhesion and then processed into boards by permanent adhesion; however, the properties of boards produced <b>by</b> two-stage <b>pressing</b> were improved when polyethylene was added to the SP adhesive. In addition, internal bond strength and thickness swelling was greatly improved when boards {{were produced}} from ozonized wood and <b>by</b> sealed <b>pressing.</b> Thus, the properties impaired <b>by</b> two-stage <b>pressing</b> were improved <b>by</b> ozonization and sealed pressing.|$|R

5|$|Combat in Mother 3 {{includes}} a unique musical combo system {{not seen in}} previous Mother games. When one of the player's characters directly attacks an enemy with a weapon, they can repeatedly attack the enemy <b>by</b> <b>pressing</b> the button {{in time with the}} beat of the background music, with each enemy possessing a musical theme with different rhythms. Using this system, the player can attack the enemy up to sixteen times in a row. When the correct beat is not apparent, the player can put the enemy to sleep to isolate the beat from the music.|$|E
5|$|Details on the Mauretanian {{events of}} 39–44 are unclear. Cassius Dio wrote an entire chapter on the {{annexation}} of Mauretania by Caligula, {{but it is}} now lost. Caligula's move seemingly had a strictly personal political motive – fear and jealousy of his cousin Ptolemy – and thus the expansion {{may not have been}} prompted <b>by</b> <b>pressing</b> military or economic needs. However, the rebellion of Tacfarinas had shown how exposed Africa Proconsularis was to its west and how the Mauretanian client kings were unable to provide protection to the province, and it is thus possible that Caligula's expansion was a prudent response to potential future threats.|$|E
5|$|GioGio's Bizarre Adventure is an action-adventure game {{in which}} the player duels against enemies in 3D environments, {{controlling}} several characters who each have their own sets of moves: Giorno Giovanna, Bruno Bucciarati, Guido Mista, Narancia Ghirga, Pannacotta Fugo, Leone Abbacchio, and Trish Una. The battle system includes physical attacks such as kicking and punching, {{and the ability to}} dodge attacks by rolling; physical attacks are performed through a single-button input, and can be chained into a combination attack <b>by</b> <b>pressing</b> repeatedly.|$|E

40|$|Interpenetrating phase Al₂O₃–Ti₃Al {{composites}} {{have been}} fabricated by reaction sintering of 2 and 4 -h discus milled composite powders containing Al and TiO₂ using controlled heat-treatment in non-oxidizing atmospheres. Pressureless sintering and hot pressing of the powders {{has been carried}} out under vacuum and argon at temperatures between 1278 °C and 1500 °C and a heating rate of 5 °C/min. Densification of the composites was investigated as a function of temperature. It was shown that lower porosity was obtained <b>by</b> hot <b>pressing</b> compared to pressureless sintering. The microstructure development and mechanical properties of dense Al₂O₃–Ti₃Al composites fabricated <b>by</b> hot <b>pressing</b> of Al–TiO₂ powder blends were examined. Fully dense microstructures could be achieved <b>by</b> hot <b>pressing</b> at 1387 °C under vacuum. An increase of Vickers hardness was observed with increasing temperature, which {{can be attributed to the}} increase of density and the decrease in the level of porosity of the composites. The mechanical behaviour exhibited by the composites can be related to properties such as Al₂O₃ particle size and porosity level. Fracture toughness of 6. 3 ± 0. 8 MPa m 1 / 2 and Vickers hardness of 13. 6 ± 0. 4 GPa were achieved for the fully dense composite produced <b>by</b> hot <b>pressing</b> discus milled powder...|$|R

It allows the player to break combinations and super moves {{in the middle of}} the opponent's offensive. Also, if the blast hit the adversary, the tension gauge is filled to its maximum capacity immediately.|$|E
5|$|In winemaking, fruit sugars are {{converted}} into alcohol by a fermentation process. If the must formed <b>by</b> <b>pressing</b> the fruit {{has a low}} sugar content, additional sugar may be added to raise the alcohol content of the wine in a process called chaptalization. In the production of sweet wines, fermentation may be halted before it has run its full course, leaving behind some residual sugar that gives the wine its sweet taste.|$|E
5|$|Its usual {{commercial}} form is a powder, but this element can be consolidated <b>by</b> <b>pressing</b> and sintering {{in a vacuum}} or hydrogen atmosphere. This procedure yields a compact solid having a density above 90% of {{the density of the}} metal. When annealed this metal is very ductile and can be bent, coiled, or rolled. Rhenium-molybdenum alloys are superconductive at 10 K; tungsten-rhenium alloys are also superconductive around 4–8 K, depending on the alloy. Rhenium metal superconducts at 1.697 ± 0.006 K.|$|E

5|$|Like in {{the first}} game, Sora can summon a Disney {{character}} to aid him in battle. Summons will replace the two computer-controlled characters and fight alongside Sora {{for as long as}} the Drive Gauge allows, or until Sora's HP runs out. Instead of being limited to only one action, Summons now have a menu of their own and are capable of performing solo or cooperative actions with Sora. These actions are performed <b>by</b> <b>pressing</b> the triangle button. The Summon ability and each Drive Form are leveled up separately and by different criteria; obtaining higher levels allows for extended use and in the case of Drive Forms, access to new abilities.|$|E
5|$|The arcade {{release of}} Cross Generation of Heroes has a control scheme {{consisting}} of a joystick and four buttons. Wii versions of Tatsunoko vs. Capcom have five control options: the Classic Controller, Nintendo GameCube controller, third-party arcade sticks, and two simplified control schemes—intended for inexperienced players—for the Wii Remote. Players use controller inputs to perform attacks; the most basic attacks are executed <b>by</b> <b>pressing</b> one of three attack buttons: light, medium, or strong. Players may augment basic attacks with joystick or control pad directional inputs; for example, a standard strong attack can become a sweep when the down input is added. Basic attacks can be strung together to perform combos.|$|E

5|$|Another aspect {{introduced}} in the game is the Dimension Link (D-Link), measured in a blue gauge on the interface. It is used to draw power from certain companions who the player characters meet during the game, such as Experiment 626, temporarily replacing the commands in the player's customized command deck with a pre-determined set of commands that differ with each D-Link. Once the command gauge is filled while performing a D-Link, a powerful finishing move is activated to take out enemies. Each finishing move has two levels which can render a finishing move more powerful than before, {{similar to that of}} the Command System. The D-Link can only be used when its corresponding gauge is filled completely, and can be activated <b>by</b> <b>pressing</b> right on the directional pad to access the D-Link menu, followed by selecting the chosen ally.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the player}} and the {{opponent}} have stamina meters, both {{displayed on the}} top of the screen. The meters decrease when either boxer gets hit by a punch. Boxers will get knocked down if their stamina meter runs out. Faster knockdowns will cause that boxer to recover less stamina upon getting up; the same happens if a boxer is knocked down by a knockout punch. Either boxer will lose if they cannot stand up before the count of ten after being knocked down (resulting in a knockout or KO) or if they are knocked down three times in the match (resulting in a technical knockout or TKO). The player can also recover some stamina while the opponent is down <b>by</b> <b>pressing</b> the buttons on the controller.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage uses any {{combination}} of materials, coloration, or illumination for concealment to make the organism hard to detect by sight. It is common in both terrestrial and marine animals. Camouflage can be achieved in many different ways, such as through resemblance to surroundings, disruptive coloration, shadow elimination, self-decoration, cryptic behavior, or changeable skin patterns and color. Animals such as the flat-tail horned lizard of North America have evolved to eliminate their shadow and {{blend in with the}} ground. The bodies of these lizards are flattened, and their sides thin towards the edge. This body form, along with the white scales fringed along their sides, allows the lizards to effectively hide their shadows. Additionally, these lizards hide any remaining shadows <b>by</b> <b>pressing</b> their bodies to the ground.|$|E
