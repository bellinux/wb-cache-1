5000|$|After a time, {{the ford}} was {{augmented}} with a wicker bridge, {{for which the}} Gaelic word is ceis, and hence the village got its name. The name had been spelt in varying ways but generally as Kish or Cash until relatively modern times. An ancient saying in the locality, which may refer to <b>basket</b> making and <b>osier</b> working in the area, states that anyone gifted with a big behind [...] "had an arse on them like a Kesh creel." ...|$|R
6000|$|Sylvia {{tore off}} the wrapper, lifted a cover, and exclaimed with pleasure, {{though it was}} the {{simplest}} present she had received that day. Only an <b>osier</b> <b>basket,</b> graceful in design and shape, lined with moss, and filled with holly sprays, the scarlet berries glowing beautifully among the polished green. No note, no card, no hint of its donor anywhere appeared, for none of them recognized the boldly written address. Presently a thought came to Sylvia; in a moment the mystery seemed to grow delightfully clear, and {{she said to herself}} with a glow of joy, [...] "This is so like Adam I know he sent it." ...|$|R
5000|$|His {{place and}} date of birth are unknown. Upon {{succeeding}} Saint Sylvius as bishop of Toulouse, he ordered {{the completion of the}} basilica of St. Saturnin, a part of which was incorporated into the Basilica of St. Sernin. Saint Jerome praised Exuperius [...] "for his munificence to the monks of Palestine, Egypt, and Libya, and for his charity to the people of his own diocese, who were then suffering from the attacks of the Vandals, Alans, and Suevi." [...] On behalf of the poor in his diocese he sold the basilica's altar vessels and was therefore compelled to carry the Sacred Offering in an <b>osier</b> <b>basket</b> and the Precious Blood in a vessel of glass. In respect of his virtues and in gratitude for his gifts, Saint Jerome dedicated his Commentary on Zacharias to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do for them? Do for them?" [...] gasped Thomas, {{worked up}} to fury by this recital of his wrongs. [...] "Why, if I dared I'd cut their throats, every one, and grallock them like deer," [...] and he ground his strong white teeth. [...] "But I am afraid. They have my soul, and month by month I must confess. You remember, Emlyn, I warned {{you when you}} and the lady would have ridden to London before the siege. Well, afterward--I must confess it--the Abbot heard it himself, and oh! sore, sore was my penance. Before I had done with it my ribs showed through my skin and my back was like a red <b>osier</b> <b>basket.</b> There's only one thing I didn't tell them, because, after all, it is no sin to grub the earth {{off the face of}} a corpse." ...|$|R
60|$|This thought {{seemed to}} sting her into sudden passion. As if longing to destroy every trace of her delusion, she tore away the holly wreaths and flung {{them in the}} fire; took down the bow and arrow Warwick had made her from above the étagère, where she had {{arranged}} the spoils of her happy voyage, snapped them across her knee and sent them after the holly; followed by the birch canoe, and every pebble, moss, shell, or bunch of headed grass {{he had given her}} then. The <b>osier</b> <b>basket</b> was not spared, the box went next, and even the wrapper {{was on its way to}} immolation, when, as she rent it apart, with a stern pleasure in the sacrifice it was going to complete, from some close fold of the paper hitherto undisturbed a card dropped at her feet.|$|R
60|$|Yet {{would she}} never come near {{him that he}} might touch her. Oftentimes he called to her and prayed of her, but she would not; and when he sought to seize her she dived into the water as a seal might dive, nor did he see her again that day. And each day {{the sound of her}} voice became sweeter to his ears. So sweet was her voice that he forgot his nets and his cunning, and had no care of his craft. Vermilion-finned and with eyes of bossy gold, the tunnies went by in shoals, but he heeded them not. His spear lay by his side unused, and his <b>baskets</b> of plaited <b>osier</b> were empty. With lips parted, and eyes dim with wonder, he sat idle in his boat and listened, {{listening}} till the sea-mists crept round him, and the wandering moon stained his brown limbs with silver.|$|R
