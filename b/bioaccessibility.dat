40|$|Although natural {{structural}} {{barriers are}} factors limiting nutrient <b>bioaccessibility,</b> their specific role in anthocyanin <b>bioaccessibility</b> is still unknown. To {{better understand how}} natural barriers govern bioactive compound <b>bioaccessibility,</b> an experimental approach comparing anthocyanins and carotenoids was designed, using a single plant matrix. Initial results revealed increased anthocyanin <b>bioaccessibility</b> in masticated black carrot. To explain this observation, samples with increasing levels of bioencapsulation (free-compound, homogenized-puree, puree) were examined. While carotenoid <b>bioaccessibility</b> was inversely proportional {{to the level of}} bioencapsulation, barrier disruption did not increase anthocyanin <b>bioaccessibility.</b> This means that mechanical processing is of particular importance in the case of carotenoid <b>bioaccessibility.</b> While micelle incorporation is the limiting factor for carotenoid <b>bioaccessibility,</b> anthocyanin degradation under alkaline conditions in the gastrointestinal tract dominates.

The effects of soil properties on the <b>bioaccessibility</b> were examined. Moreover, the interaction between As and Cd in simulated human digestive system was studied by mixing As-spiked soil with Cd-spiked soil of the same type during <b>bioaccessibility</b> test. Results shows the <b>bioaccessibility</b> of As ranged from 40 ± 2. 8 to 95 ± 1. 3 % in the gastric phase and 16 ± 2. 0 to 96 ± 0. 8 % in the intestinal phase whilst a significant difference was observed between Cd gastric <b>bioaccessibility</b> (72 ± 4. 3 to 99 ± 0. 8 %) and intestinal <b>bioaccessibility</b> (6. 2 ± 0. 3 to 45 ± 2. 7 %). Organic carbon, iron oxide and aluminium oxide were key parameters influencing the <b>bioaccessibility</b> of As (gastric and intestinal phases) and Cd (intestinal phase).

40|$|Ingestion {{exposure}} estimates typically use a default bioavailability of 100 %, thereby {{assuming that}} the entirety of an ingested dose is absorbed into systemic circulation. However, the actual bioavailability of ingested contaminants is oftentimes lower than 100 %. The research described herein investigates {{the use of the}} Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (SHIME) for the calculation of in vitro <b>bioaccessibility</b> (IVBA), a conservative predictor of bioavailability, of mercury (Hg) from traditional northern foods and arsenic (As) from soils. The primary objective of the research described herein is to address data-gaps which have hindered attempts to incorporate IVBA into risk assessment on more than a case-by-case basis. The hypotheses of this thesis are that (1) the <b>bioaccessibility</b> of contaminants is dependent upon concentration due to kinetic limitations on dissolution, (2) gastrointestinal (GI) microbes in the ileum and colon alter contaminant <b>bioaccessibility</b> and/or speciation, (3) the GI microbial effect on <b>bioaccessibility</b> is toxicologically relevant, and (4) metal <b>bioaccessibility</b> is predictable according to dissolution kinetics. Mercury <b>bioaccessibility</b> from country food samples was independent of total Hg concentration (F= 0. 5726, P= 0. 578) whereas As <b>bioaccessibility</b> was inversely related to total As concentration for Nova Scotia mine tailings, synthesized ferrihydrite with adsorbed AsV, and synthesized amorphous scorodite (P= 2 x 10 - 10). Isotherm analysis indicated that, at high soil As concentrations, saturation of simulated GI fluids limited As <b>bioaccessibility</b> under gastric conditions whereas kinetic limitations constrained As <b>bioaccessibility</b> under intestinal conditions. Additionally, we demonstrated that GI microbes may affect Hg <b>bioaccessibility,</b> either increasing or decreasing <b>bioaccessibility</b> depending upon the type of food. For example, the <b>bioaccessibility</b> of HgT decreased in the presence of GI microbial activity for caribou kidney, caribou tongue, seal blood, seal brain, seal liver, and walrus flesh. In contrast, HgT <b>bioaccessibility</b> from Arctic char and seal intestine increased in the presence of GI microbial activity.

Homogenisation also resulted in a decrease of in vitro <b>bioaccessibility</b> of lycopene, zeta-carotene, and lutein. Such decrease was attributed to the structuring effect of HPH. An inverse relation between tomato consistency and carotenoid in vitro <b>bioaccessibility</b> was found. This dependency was affected by carotenoid species and its localisation within the matrix. It could be observed that one matrix (e. g.

Furthermore, it is far from clear that if soil property could make a difference to these effects. In this study, seven types of soils were collected in Australia and spiked with As, Cd or Pb. Gastric <b>bioaccessibility</b> of Pb ranged from 44 ± 0. 9 % to 100 ± 6. 7 % whilst intestinal <b>bioaccessibility</b> dropped to 1 ± 0. 2 % to 36 ± 1. 7 %.

Effects of As and Cd on the <b>bioaccessibility</b> of Pb in simulated human digestive system were studied by mixing As-spiked soil (or Cd-spiked soil) with Pb-spiked soil of the same type during <b>bioaccessibility</b> test. Results reveal that neither As nor Cd had impact on Pb <b>bioaccessibility,</b> which indicates when As, Cd and Pb aged in soils separately, they may behave independently in the <b>bioaccessibility</b> measuring system.

40|$|The {{release of}} arsenic (As) from a {{contaminated}} food matrix during gastrointestinal digestion, i. e., its <b>bioaccessibility,</b> {{is an important}} estimator of its bioavailability, and therefore also its health risk. In addition, As toxicity is primarily determined by its speciation {{and it is not}} clear how different As species behave during digestion in the upper digestive tract. Here, we evaluated to what extent digestive parameters like gastric pH and bile concentration, but also food matrix constituents affect the <b>bioaccessibility</b> of 8 As species (AsIII, AsV, MMAV, DMAV, MMAIII, DMAIII, MMMTAV, DMMTAV). <b>Bioaccessibility</b> of all As standards ranged between 85 % and 90 % under pH 1. 8. <b>Bioaccessibility</b> of methylated and thiolated arsenicals was decreased from 85 % to 50 % with increasing gastric pH to 4, yet an increasing bile salts concentration up to 30 g/L lowered the <b>bioaccessibility</b> of inorganic species from 83 % to 70 % due to interaction with Fe present in bile salts.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to investigate the in vitro <b>bioaccessibility</b> of phenolic compounds and cinnamaldehyde in cinnamon beverage and formulations during simulated gastro-pancreatic digestion. Cinnamon polyphenol <b>bioaccessibility</b> was 79. 8 % {{at the end of}} the digestion. This decline in total polyphenols was found during the gastric step of the digestion and was caused by the precipitation of cinnamon proanthocyanidins by pepsin. The addition of sweeteners increased the polyphenol <b>bioaccessibility</b> to value near 90 % decreasing the interaction between pepsin and tannins. The addition of bovine milk gave rise to an immediate decrease in cinnamon polyphenol concentration and negatively affect their post-pancreatic <b>bioaccessibility.</b> Quercetin- 3 -rhamnoside, syringic and coumaric acids were find to be poor bioaccessible whereas kaempferol and cinnamaldehyde were stable during digestion. The addition of sweeteners did not affect the <b>bioaccessibility</b> of these compounds. Milk addition caused an immediate decrease in the concentration of monomeric phenolic compounds partially due to the interaction with milk protein as probed by fluorescence spectroscopy. The final <b>bioaccessibility</b> was affected by milk only for cinnamaldehyde. The present study demonstrates that cinnamon beverage provide a significant source of dietary bioaccessible polyphenols and that the modality of consuming cinnamon could represent a crucial factor since the addition of sweeteners improve their <b>bioaccessibility</b> whereas milk negatively affect it...|$|E

40|$|Arsenic (As) <b>bioaccessibility</b> in {{contaminated}} soils (n = 50) {{was assessed using}} the simplified <b>bioaccessibility</b> extraction test (SBET). Soils {{used in the study}} were collected from sites where As was used as an herbicide (railway corridor) or pesticide (cattle dip sites), from former gold mines and from highly mineralised locations containing geogenic As sources (gossans). In all but three soils, As <b>bioaccessibility</b> was less than 50 % indicating that a significant proportion of the total As concentration may not be available for absorption in the gastrointestinal tract following incidental soil ingestion. When regression models were developed based on soil properties, the descriptive variables best able to describe As <b>bioaccessibility</b> in railway corridor, dip site and mine site soils were total As and total or dithionite-citrate extractable (free) iron (Fe). While As <b>bioaccessibility</b> could be predicted (r 2 = 0. 955, n = 50) in these {{contaminated soils}}, As <b>bioaccessibility</b> for gossan soils was a poor fit using linear or multivariate regression analysis.

40|$|The <b>bioaccessibility</b> {{of total}} lipids, EPA, DHA, Se, Hg, and MeHg in raw and cooked meagre (Argyrosomus regius) was studied {{by using an}} in vitro {{digestion}} method. A risk–benefit assessment of raw and cooked meagre {{on the basis of}} the <b>bioaccessibility</b> data was carried out. The <b>bioaccessibility</b> of total lipids was generally high in raw and cooked meagre with exception of grilled fish. For EPA and DHA, <b>bioaccessibility</b> percentages were low never surpassing the 50 % in raw, boiled, and grilled meagre. The <b>bioaccessibility</b> percentage of Se was equal or higher than 82 % (grilling treatment). Likewise, for Hg and MeHg, high <b>bioaccessibility</b> values were determined with exception of grilled meagre, displaying lower values of 54 % and 64 %, respectively. The risk–benefit probabilistic assessment brought about a recommendation of a maximum consumption of two weekly meals for boiled or roasted meagre and three weekly meals for grilled meagre.

40|$|Tomato {{fractions}} {{were subjected}} to pulsed electric fields treatment combined or not with heating. Results showed that pulsed electric fields and heating applied in combination or individually induced permeabilization of cell membranes in the tomato fractions. However, no changes in β-carotene and lycopene <b>bioaccessibility</b> were found upon combined and individual pulsed electric fields and heating, except in the following cases: (i) in tissue, {{a significant decrease in}} lycopene <b>bioaccessibility</b> upon combined pulsed electric fields and heating and heating only was observed; (ii) in chromoplasts, both β-carotene and lycopene <b>bioaccessibility</b> significantly decreased upon combined pulsed electric fields and heating and pulsed electric fields only. The reduction in carotenoids <b>bioaccessibility</b> was attributed to modification in chromoplasts membrane and carotenoids-protein complexes. Differences in the effects of pulsed electric fields on <b>bioaccessibility</b> among different tomato fractions were related to tomato structure complexity. </p...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{ingestion}} {{can be a}} major exposure {{route for}} humans to many immobile soil contaminants. Exposure to soil contaminants can be overestimated if oral bioavailability is not taken into account. Several in vitro digestion models simulating the human gastrointestinal tract {{have been developed to}} assess mobilization of contaminants from soil during digestion, i. e., <b>bioaccessibility.</b> <b>Bioaccessibility</b> is a crucial step in controlling the oral bioavailability for soil contaminants. To what extent in vitro determination of <b>bioaccessibility</b> is method dependent has, until now, not been studied. This paper describes a multi-laboratory comparison and evaluation of five in vitro digestion models. Their experimental design and the results of a round robin evaluation of three soils, each contaminated with arsenic, cadmium, and lead, are presented and discussed. A wide range of <b>bioaccessibility</b> values were found for the three soils: for As 6 − 95 %, 1 − 19 %, and 10 − 59 %; for Cd 7 − 92 %, 5 − 92 %, and 6 − 99 %; and for Pb 4 − 91 %, 1 − 56 %, and 3 − 90 %. <b>Bioaccessibility</b> in many cases is less than 50 %, indicating that a reduction of bioavailability can have implications for health risk assessment. Although the experimental designs of the different digestion systems are distinct, the main differences in test results of <b>bioaccessibility</b> can be explained {{on the basis of the}} applied gastric pH. High values are typically observed for a simple gastric method, which measures <b>bioaccessibility</b> in the gastric compartment at low pHs of 1. 5. Other methods that also apply a low gastric pH, and include intestinal conditions, produce lower <b>bioaccessibility</b> values. The lowest <b>bioaccessibility</b> values are observed for a gastrointestinal method which employs a high gastric pH of 4. 0...|$|E
40|$|Milk {{products}} are only moderate sources of folate. Nevertheless, {{they are of}} interest due to their content of folate-binding proteins (FBP), which in some studies {{have been reported to}} increase folate bioavailability. The effect of FBP on folate bioavailability has been widely discussed. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the <b>bioaccessibility</b> of folic acid and (6 S) - 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate (5 -CH 3 -H(4) folate) from fortified yogurt using a dynamic in vitro gastrointestinal model (TIM). In addition, the effect of FBP on folate <b>bioaccessibility</b> and the stability of FBP added to yogurt during gastrointestinal passage were investigated. Folate <b>bioaccessibility</b> was 82 % from yogurt fortified with folic acid and 5 -CH 3 -H(4) folate. The addition of FBP to yogurt decreased (P < 0. 05) folate <b>bioaccessibility.</b> The lowering effect of FBP was more pronounced in yogurt fortified with folic acid (34 % folate <b>bioaccessibility)</b> than from yogurt fortified with 5 -CH 3 -H(4) folate (57 % folate <b>bioaccessibility).</b> After gastrointestinal passage, 17 % of the FBP in yogurt fortified with 5 -CH 3 -H(4) folate and 34 % of the FBP in yogurt fortified with folic acid were recovered. No difference in folate <b>bioaccessibility</b> was found between folate-fortified yogurt and folate-fortified pasteurized milk (P = 0. 10), whereas the lowering effect of FBP was (P < 0. 05) greater in yogurt compared with pasteurized milk. In conclusion, based on the high <b>bioaccessibility</b> of folic acid and 5 -CH 3 -H(4) folate, yogurt without active FBP can be considered to be an appropriate food matrix for folate fortification...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis {{investigation}} was undertaken {{to identify the}} most significant parameters {{that can be used}} to model the <b>bioaccessibility</b> of lead in contaminated soils. Twenty-five soil samples contaminated by two distinct sources of contamination (mining and smelting areas) were investigated in this work. Edaphic soil properties were determined using the classic techniques. Speciation and solid phase distribution of Pb were determined by sequential fractionation and physical analysis (XRD and SEM-EDX). <b>Bioaccessibility</b> of Pb was measured using the unified BARGE protocol on each soil samples and each residue following the different steps of the sequential extraction procedure. Results showed that Pb speciation varied according to the source of contamination. Pb gastric <b>bioaccessibility</b> ranged from 12 % to 86 % in mining soils and from 40 % to 95 % in smelting soils. Soil edaphic properties (pH, CEC, clays content or organic matter content) cannot be used to model Pb <b>bioaccessibility</b> as these parameters could not be extrapolated from on site to another. The differences in Pb <b>bioaccessibility</b> between the 25 soils were better reflected by the nature of the Pb-bearing minerals as characterized by sequential extractions. Soluble, exchangeable and acid-soluble phases could explain from 70 to 98 % of Pb <b>bioaccessibility.</b> Consequently, Pb <b>bioaccessibility</b> is extremely sensitive to the Pb-bearing phase distribution. This distribution should be thoroughly evaluated before applying any remedial techniques that would potentially affect Pb speciation in soils...|$|E
40|$|Central {{composite}} design using response surface methodology {{was employed to}} optimize soil/liquid ratio (S/L), pH, and incubation time for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) <b>bioaccessibility</b> from soil in a simulated gastrointestinal tract. The magnitude of PAHs <b>bioaccessibility</b> in intestinal tract was found higher than that in gastric tract. Results showed that S/L had significant negative effects on the <b>bioaccessibility</b> of PAHs in both the gastric and intestinal tracts. The effect of pH on the intestinal tract was significantly negative, while on the gastric tract, it was positive. The incubation time presented an insignificant effect in gastric tract despite its significant positive effect in intestinal tract. The worst-case <b>bioaccessibility</b> conditions for PAHs in the gastric tract {{were found to be}} S/L 0. 004, pH 2, and incubation time 3 h, with the maximum <b>bioaccessibility</b> of PAHs at 6. 0 % compared with 41. 8 % in intestinal tract with S/L 0. 004, pH 6. 5, and incubation time 6 h.
