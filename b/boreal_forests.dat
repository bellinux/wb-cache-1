5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Lactarius vinaceorufescens grow {{scattered}} or in {{groups on the}} ground under pine between August and October. The species is known to develop mycorrhizal associations with Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii). It is a fairly common and widely distributed species in North America. The mushroom {{has been found in}} <b>boreal</b> <b>forests</b> and high-elevation forests of the Southern Appalachians, associated with the tree genera Picea, Abies, and Pinus. In California, it has been noted to commonly co-occur with L.fragilis, L.rubrilacteus, Russula emetica, and R.cremoricolor.|$|E
5|$|The grey jay (Perisoreus canadensis), also gray jay, Canada jay, or whisky jack, is a {{passerine}} bird of {{the family}} Corvidae. It is found in <b>boreal</b> <b>forests</b> of North America north to the tree line, and in the Rocky Mountains subalpine zone south to New Mexico and Arizona. A fairly large songbird, the grey jay has pale grey underparts, darker grey upperparts, and a grey-white head with a darker grey nape. It {{is one of three}} members of the genus Perisoreus, a small genus more closely related to the Cyanopica genus of magpies than to other birds known as jays. The grey jay itself has nine recognized subspecies.|$|E
5|$|The United States Fish and Wildlife Service has {{continued}} to purchase and manage habitat in many areas to support the migratory stopover, wintering and breeding populations of the American black duck. In addition, the Montezuma National Wildlife Refuge has purchased and restored over 1,000 acres of wetlands to provide stopover habitat for over 10,000 American black ducks during fall migration. Also, the Atlantic Coast Joint Venture has been protecting the habitat of the American black duck through habitat restoration and land acquisition projects, mostly within their wintering and breeding areas. In 2003, a Boreal Forest Conservation Framework was adopted by conservation organizations, industries and First Nations to protect the Canadian <b>boreal</b> <b>forests,</b> including the American black duck's eastern Canadian breeding range.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} trees in the world, {{according}} to a 2015 estimate, is 3.04 trillion, of which 1.39 trillion (46%) are in the tropics or sub-tropics, 0.61 trillion (20%) in the temperate zones, and 0.74 trillion (24%) in the coniferous <b>boreal</b> <b>forests.</b> The estimate is about eight times higher than previous estimates, {{and is based on}} tree densities measured on over 400,000 plots. It remains subject to a wide margin of error, not least because the samples are mainly from Europe and North America. The estimate suggests that about 15 billion trees are cut down annually and about 5 billion are planted. In the 12,000 years since the start of human agriculture, the number of trees worldwide has decreased by 46%.|$|E
25|$|However, <b>boreal</b> <b>forests,</b> {{particularly}} those in North America, showed a different response to warming. Many <b>boreal</b> <b>forests</b> greened, but the trend was {{not as strong as}} it was for tundra of the circumpolar Arctic. In North America, some <b>boreal</b> <b>forests</b> actually experienced “browning” (less photosynthetic activity) over the study period. Droughts, forest fire activity, animal and insect behavior, industrial pollution, {{and a number of other}} factors may have contributed to the browning.|$|E
25|$|Ectomycorrhizal {{networks}} are formed between plants that associate with ectomycorrhizal fungi and proliferate {{by way of}} Ectomycorrhizal extramatrical mycelium. In contrast to Glomeromycetes, ectomycorrhizal fungal are a highly diverse and polyphyletic group consisting of 10,000 fungal species. These associations {{tend to be more}} specific, and predominate in temperate and <b>boreal</b> <b>forests.</b>|$|E
50|$|Oil {{developments}} at the {{tar sands}} {{is one of}} the main causes of deforestation in Canada. Less than 14% of Alberta's <b>boreal</b> <b>forest</b> remains intact. Loss of Canadian <b>boreal</b> <b>forest</b> is a threat to migratory birds.|$|R
50|$|The {{vegetation}} {{is typically}} {{of part of}} the dry mixedwood <b>boreal</b> <b>forest</b> natural subregion, a transitional zone on the south edge of the <b>boreal</b> <b>forest,</b> but is surrounded by aspen parkland. This island of <b>boreal</b> <b>forest</b> in the south means that both boreal animal species (moose, black bear, Canada lynx) and grassland animal species (sharp-tailed grouse, mule deer) live in the region. Nearby landscapes include Beaverhill Lake just to the east, and the North Saskatchewan River to the north.|$|R

25|$|Forestry {{has long}} been a major {{industry}} in Canada. Forest products contribute one fifth of the nation's exports. The provinces with the largest forestry industries are British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec. Fifty-four percent of Canada's land area is covered in forest. The <b>boreal</b> <b>forests</b> account for four-fifths of Canada's forestland.|$|E
25|$|In North America, peat fires {{can occur}} during severe {{droughts}} throughout their occurrence, from <b>boreal</b> <b>forests</b> in Canada to swamps and fens in the subtropical southern Florida Everglades. Once a fire has burnt through the area, hollows in the peat are burnt out, and hummocks are desiccated but {{can contribute to}} Sphagnum recolonization.|$|E
25|$|Another species well {{adapted to}} a {{particular}} disturbance is the Jack Pine in <b>boreal</b> <b>forests</b> exposed to crown fires. They, {{as well as some}} other pine species, have specialized serotinous cones that only open and disperse seeds with sufficient heat generated by fire. As a result, this species often dominates in areas where competition has been reduced by fire.|$|E
50|$|The Mealy Mountains {{encompass}} five of Labrador’s ten provincial ecoregions, including coastal s, high sub arctic tundra, high <b>boreal</b> <b>forest,</b> mid <b>boreal</b> <b>forest,</b> {{and string}} bog.

5000|$|All of the {{oil sands}} leases slated for {{development}} {{are located in the}} <b>boreal</b> <b>forest.</b> The <b>boreal</b> <b>forest</b> is particularly valuable for its ability to store large amounts of carbon in its bogs, peat, soil, and trees. The destruction of <b>boreal</b> <b>forest</b> reduces the earth’s capacity to store carbon and releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere as it is destroyed. The currently proposed oil sands projects, if all were to be activated, would directly remove an area of <b>boreal</b> <b>forest</b> eco-system twice the size of Ireland. [...] Destruction of the forest eliminates the habitat for birds, fish, and mammals, including caribou, bear, deer, moose, wolves, coyotes, lynx, wolverine, beaver, fisher, marten, muskrat, and squirrels. Reclamation is not a credible solution.|$|R

25|$|Its primary {{industry}} is oil and gas, with large heavy oil reserves being exploited at the Athabasca oil sands and Wabasca {{area in the}} east of the region. Mostly natural gas is extracted in Peace region and Chinchaga-Rainbow areas in the west, and forestry and logging are also developed in the <b>boreal</b> <b>forests</b> of this region.|$|E
25|$|<b>Boreal</b> <b>forests</b> of the {{southern}} part of the province have extensive black spruce and white spruce forests. The tundra region of northern Manitoba exhibits more sparse black spruce forests whose tree heights are limited by the thin soils, permafrost underlayer and generally cold climate. In this region polar bears are found, denning in the Wapusk National Park and migrating to hunt for seals when pack ice forms on Hudson Bay.|$|E
25|$|Global warming may be {{affecting}} the north {{more than other}} parts of the world and Yukon is no exception. While residents might welcome warmer temperatures, the ultimate effects are not known. Higher temperatures would mean more evaporation and drying out an already dry climate, resulting in more forest fires and reducing the biological productivity of <b>boreal</b> <b>forests,</b> whose growth is limited more by lack of moisture than temperature.|$|E

25|$|The {{wolverine}} {{is found}} primarily in remote {{reaches of the}} Northern <b>boreal</b> <b>forests</b> and subarctic and alpine tundra of the Northern Hemisphere, with the greatest numbers in northern Canada, the US state of Alaska, the mainland Nordic countries of Europe, and throughout western Russia and Siberia. Its population has steadily declined since the 19th century owing to trapping, range reduction and habitat fragmentation. The wolverine is now essentially absent from {{the southern end of}} its European range.|$|E
25|$|White spruce is {{a climax}} canopy {{tree in the}} <b>boreal</b> <b>forests</b> of Canada and Alaska. It {{generally}} occurs on well-drained soils in alluvial and riparian zones, although it also occurs in soils of glacial and lacustrine origin. The understory is dominated by feather mosses (Hylocomium splendens and Pleurozium schreberi, Ptilium crista-castrensis, and Dicranum spp.), and occasionally peat moss. In the far north, the total depth of the moss and underlying humus is normally between , although {{it tends to be}} shallower when hardwoods are present in the stand.|$|E
25|$|Dominant fauna of the Escarpment are {{the species}} found {{elsewhere}} in the Catskills: white-tailed deer, porcupine, fisher, black bear and snowshoe hare. There have been some rare bobcat sightings up on the ridge. Bird species like the rare Bicknell's thrush and ruffed grouse nest in the <b>boreal</b> <b>forests.</b> A few timber rattlesnake dens are known to exist on the rocky ledges of Overlook {{at the southern end}} of the range. The paucity of water on the ridgetops and the slopes means that there are few major fish or amphibian species in the Escarpment, save around North-South Lake.|$|E

25|$|A popular theory {{proposed}} by Read postulates that habitat type and the distinct functions of different mycorrhizas {{help determine the}} particular symbiosis that will become predominant. In this theory, EcM symbioses evolved in relatively productive ecosystems, such as <b>boreal</b> <b>forests,</b> but in which nutrient cycling could still be limiting. In this scenario, ectomycorrhizas are a somewhat intermediate form, having greater mineralization capacities than arbuscular mycorrhizas and less so than types such as ericoid mycorrhizas. This is supported by several studies, some of which also purport arbuscular mycorrhizas to be the ancestral trait. According to this data, many non-mycorrhizal and other mycorrhizal forms represent evolutionary specializations.|$|E
25|$|Picea glauca, {{the white}} spruce, is {{a species of}} spruce native to the {{northern}} temperate and <b>boreal</b> <b>forests</b> in North America. Picea glauca was originally native from central Alaska all through the east, across southern/central Canada to the Avalon Peninsula in Newfoundland. It now has become naturalized southward into the far northern United States border states like Montana, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine; {{there is also an}} isolated population in the Black Hills of South Dakota and Wyoming. It is also known as Canadian spruce, skunk spruce, cat spruce, Black Hills spruce, western white spruce, Alberta white spruce, and Porsild spruce.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{research}} into ectomycorrhizal plants in <b>boreal</b> <b>forests</b> {{has indicated that}} mycorrhizal fungi and plants have a relationship {{that may be more}} complex than simply mutualistic. This relationship was noted when mycorrhizal fungi were unexpectedly found to be hoarding nitrogen from plant roots in times of nitrogen scarcity. Researchers argue that some mycorrhizae distribute nutrients based upon the environment with surrounding plants and other mycorrhizae. They go on to explain how this updated model could explain why mycorrhizae do not alleviate plant nitrogen limitation, and why plants can switch abruptly from a mixed strategy with both mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal roots to a purely mycorrhizal strategy as soil nitrogen availability declines.|$|E
