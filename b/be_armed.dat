5|$|Kroonland {{served as}} a troopship for about the next year. In early March, U.S. Navy {{ordnance}} officers inspected Kroonland and took measurements in preparation to arm her for defense against submarine attacks. On 13 March, she was assigned guns by the Navy, {{becoming one of the}} first seven ships to <b>be</b> <b>armed.</b> With her arming complete, and carrying an armed naval guard to man the guns, Kroonland sailed for Liverpool on 25 March 1917. Twelve days later, the United States formally declared war on Germany.|$|E
5|$|Ministry of Interior {{proposed}} {{a constitutional amendment}} on 15 December 2016 aimed at providing constitutional right to acquire, possess and carry firearms. The proposed law would, if passed, add a new section to Constitutional Act No. 110/1998 Col., on Security of the Czech Republic, expressly providing the right to <b>be</b> <b>armed</b> as part of citizen's duty of participation in provision of internal order, security and democratic order.|$|E

With the Xindi superweapon about to <b>be</b> <b>armed</b> and time running out, Captain Jonathan Archer tries to persuade the Xindi-Aquatics to help destroy it. Sato's kidnapping, and Archer's promises {{to shut down the}} 70-plus known spheres, finally convinces the Aquatics into believing that the Sphere Builders, and not the humans, may indeed represent their true enemy.|$|E
5|$|Operation Teardrop was a United States Navy {{operation}} of World War II conducted during April and May 1945 to sink German U-boats approaching the United States East Coast that {{were believed to}} <b>be</b> <b>armed</b> with V-1 flying bombs. Germany had threatened in propaganda to attack New York with V-1 flying bombs and V-2 missiles. After the war the Allies determined that the submarines had not been carrying either.|$|E
5|$|Södermanland {{was granted}} its {{coat of arms}} in 1560. According to the Swedish Heraldry Society, the arms were created for Gustav Vasa's funeral, and {{the choice of the}} griffin as charge may have been {{influenced}} by the name of Gripsholm (once home of Bo Jonsson Grip). Since 1884, the coat of arms is represented with a ducal coronet. The same coat of arms was granted to Södermanland county in 1940.

5|$|The Tosa-class {{ships were}} {{intended}} to <b>be</b> <b>armed</b> with a main battery of ten 45-caliber 41-centimeter guns in five twin turrets, four of which were superfiring fore and aft. Numbered one through five from front to rear, the hydraulically powered turrets had an elevation range of −2 to +35 degrees. The rate of fire for the guns was around two rounds per minute. The ships were designed to carry 90 rounds per gun, although space was available for 110.|$|E
5|$|The US Navy recognizes 13 October 1775 as {{the date}} of its {{official}} establishment— {{the date of}} the passage of the resolution of the Continental Congress at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania that created the Continental Navy. On this day, Congress authorized the purchase of two vessels to <b>be</b> <b>armed</b> for a cruise against British merchant ships. Congress on 13 December 1775, authorized the building of thirteen frigates within the next three months, five ships of 32 guns, five with 28 guns and three with 24 guns.|$|E

5000|$|Against aerial threats the cruisers <b>were</b> <b>armed</b> {{with four}} 57mm L/80 DP guns {{situated}} in two twin mountings. They also had four 30mm AK-630 CIWS mountings. They <b>were</b> <b>armed</b> with two twin launchers for the 48 SA-N-3 surface-to-air missiles they carried.|$|R
5|$|The {{rejection}} of their protest greatly upset the German forces, {{because they believed}} they were treated unjustly in the war. Shortly after the protest was rejected, Germany issued threats that they would punish all captured American soldiers that were found to <b>be</b> <b>armed</b> with a shotgun. This led to the United States issuing a retaliation threat, stating that any measures unjustly taken against captured American soldiers would lead to an equal act by the United States on captured German soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Traditional galleys were {{effective}} as troop transports for amphibious operations, but were severely under-gunned, especially {{in relation to}} their large crews; a galley with a 250-man crew, most of whom were rowers, would typically <b>be</b> <b>armed</b> with only one 24-pounder cannon and two 6-pounders, all in the bow. However, they were undecked and lacked adequate shelter for the rower-soldiers, great numbers of which succumbed to illness in the 1741–43 war.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the maximum}} calibre of naval gun allowed under the Anglo-German Naval Agreement was 40.6cm (16inch), Hitler soon had second {{thoughts}} about the guns {{to be used for}} the new ships and ordered that they <b>be</b> <b>armed</b> with 38cm (15inch) weapons. However, the 28.3cm turrets were readily available; 38cm turrets would take years to develop, and Hitler wanted capital ships as soon as possible to fulfill his political ideals. He was also reminded that, despite the allowances of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, the British had historically been sensitive about increases in main gun calibers aboard German capital ships. He therefore acquiesced to the ships' being armed with 28.3cm guns, with the provision that they be upgunned to 38cm at the earliest opportunity. The 38cm turret was eventually used in the s.|$|E
50|$|The 45-ton Scourge <b>was</b> <b>armed</b> {{with four}} 6-pounder and four 4-pounder deck guns, while the 76-ton Hamilton <b>was</b> <b>armed</b> with eight 18-pounder carronades and one 12-pounder long gun on a pivot mount. The ships guns remain in {{position}} on deck.|$|R
50|$|The PV-1 armed the Polikarpov I-3 and Tupolev I-4 {{fighters and}} the Tupolev TB-1 bomber.

Subsequent {{modifications}} increased the armament to four PV-1 guns with 4,000 rounds total. The Polikarpov I-15 <b>was</b> <b>armed</b> with four PV-1 guns with 3,000 rounds total. The reconnaissance Polikarpov R-5 <b>was</b> <b>armed</b> with one propeller-synchronized PV-1 and one in a rear turret mount.

5|$|Each legion was {{normally}} {{partnered with}} an approximately {{equal number of}} allied (non-Roman) auxiliae troops. The addition of allied troops to the Roman army was a formalisation of the earlier arrangement of using light troops from the Socii and Latini, who had received Roman citizenship after the Social War. Auxiliary troops could be formed from either auxiliary light cavalry known as alae, auxiliary light infantry known as cohors auxiliae, or a flexible mixture of the two known as cohors equitata. Cavalry types included mounted archers (Latin: sagittarii) and heavy shock cavalry (Latin: cataphracti or clibanarii). Infantry could <b>be</b> <b>armed</b> with bows, slings, throwing spears, long swords, or thrusting spears. Auxiliary units were originally led by their own chiefs, and, in this period, their internal organisation was left to their commanders.|$|E
5|$|Early F-16s could <b>be</b> <b>armed</b> {{with up to}} six AIM-9 Sidewinder heat-seeking {{short-range}} {{air-to-air missiles}} (AAM) by employing rail launchers on each wingtip, as well as radar guided AIM-7 Sparrow medium-range AAMs in a weapons mix. More recent versions support the AIM-120 AMRAAM. The aircraft can carry various other AAMs, {{a wide variety of}} air-to-ground missiles, rockets or bombs; electronic countermeasures (ECM), navigation, targeting or weapons pods; and fuel tanks on 9 hardpoints – six under the wings, two on wingtips, and one under the fuselage. Two other locations under the fuselage are available for sensor or radar pods. The F-16 carries a 20 mm (0.787 in) M61A1 Vulcan cannon for close range aerial combat and strafing. The 20mm cannon is mounted inside the fuselage {{to the left of the}} cockpit.|$|E
5|$|Iberville had {{approached}} the Spanish in January 1702, {{before the war}} broke out in Europe, recommending that the Apalachee warriors <b>be</b> <b>armed</b> and sent against the English colonists and their allies. The Spanish organized an expedition under Francisco Romo de Uriza which left Pensacola in August for the trading centers of the Carolina back country. The English colonists had advance warning of the expedition and organized a defense {{at the head of}} the Flint River, where they routed the Spanish-led force, with upwards of 500 Spanish-led Indians killed or captured.|$|E
25|$|The three Spanish vessels {{were the}} Generalissimo, Huron, and Pastora.

Baris Presi is common throughout {{northern and southern}} Bali. Baris Dadap, however, was limited in range by the 1980s. Dancers are not accompanied by an orchestra, but sing songs regarding wayang during performances; this dance is generally performed during cremation ceremonies or temple festivals (dewayadnya).|$|R
5|$|In a final vain attempt, Roosevelt's Secretary of State Cordell Hull sent a {{telegram}} on 4 June to the Ambassador to Japan Joseph Grew instructing {{him that the}} United States would still accept a cap of 14-inch guns {{if he could get}} Japan to as well. The Japanese replied that they could not accept this unless the number of battleships was also limited; they wanted the United States and the United Kingdom to agree to having an equal number of battleships with Japan, but this was a condition that the two countries refused to accept. On 24 June, the two North Carolinas were ordered with the 14-inch weapons, but on 10 July, Roosevelt directed that they <b>be</b> <b>armed</b> with triple 16-inch instead.|$|E
5|$|Kingswear Castle is an {{artillery}} fort, built to protect Dartmouth harbour in Devon, England. It was constructed between 1491 and 1502 {{in response to}} the threat of French attack {{and was one of the}} first purpose-built artillery forts in Britain. By the end of the 16th century, however, improvements in the range of artillery weapons had reduced the utility of the castle. It took part in the English Civil War and continued to <b>be</b> <b>armed</b> until the early 18th century, but fell into ruin. Restored as a summer house in 1855, in the 21st century it is managed by the Landmark Trust as a holiday let.|$|E
5|$|The I-5 and the I-6 were {{virtually}} identical in performance, although the I-6 took 15 seconds {{to complete a}} full circle versus the 9.5 seconds of the I-5. Both aircraft were armed with two 7.62mm (0.3in) PV-1 machine guns, but the production model of the I-5 was expected to <b>be</b> <b>armed</b> with four, although this proved to impose too great a penalty to the I-5's performance. The exact reasons for {{the selection of the}} I-5 over the I-6, which was debated for a full year, are not known, but likely relate to both of these factors. Curiously, Polikarpov was not informed of the selection of the I-5 until his release in 1933 after his initial sentence of death had been commuted to ten years of imprisonment in a labor camp.|$|E
50|$|From the air, Soviet naval {{aviation}} had ASuW capabilities.
