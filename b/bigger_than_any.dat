They were all built to give good defense against an enemy. Inside the strongholds, the clan had own army unites, their upkeep was paid from the income Ostojas gained from their land that they owned or controlled. They could also afford to hire mercenaries when necessary {{and they were in}} close cooperation with each other, often visiting and helping to maintain the power they have been given.

The larvae have {{three pairs of}} legs (true legs) attached to {{the underside of the}} segment behind the head, called the thorax. The length of the larvae ranges from 5mm, when newly hatched, to 25mm at larval maturity. Newly hatched larvae weigh 2–3mg and grow up to 200mg. The most obvious characteristic of larva is that the abdomen is very swollen and looks a lot <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> other part of body. There are many thin fine hairs along both sides of the body, especially around the abdomen. Occasionally grass grub larvae can be found that are purple/yellow or green in colour, these are diseased.|$|E
500|$|Inverse {{functions}} {{are closely related}} to the original functions. Their graphs correspond to each other upon exchanging the x- and the y-coordinates (or upon reflection at the diagonal line x = y), as shown at the right: a point [...] on the graph of f yields a point [...] on the graph of the logarithm and vice versa. As a consequence, logb(x) diverges to infinity (gets <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> given number) if x grows to infinity, provided that b is greater than one. In that case, [...] is an increasing function. For , [...] tends to minus infinity instead. When x approaches zero, [...] goes to minus infinity for [...] (plus infinity for , respectively).|$|E

However, the fall of the Soviet Union saw funding for the Navy collapse - the fourth ship, renamed as Pyotr Velikiy (Peter the Great), was not commissioned until 1998, while the fifth hull was cancelled, and the remaining three laid up in varying states of disrepair. The first two are projected to eventually be scrapped, while Kalinin (renamed as Admiral Nakhimov), considered to be in better condition, is intended to undergo a major overhaul to return her to active service by 2021.|$|E

[...] Dan Aquilante of the New York Post stated that after the Beyoncé's performances of the songs on 4 at the concerts, the album was to be rated a 10 out of 10. He further wrote, [...] "Where tunes felt lackluster and flabby on the recording, Beyoncé injected a vibrancy in the new songs that boosted the material to be almost the equal to some of her best and biggest radio hits." [...] Yolanda Sangweni of Essence magazine viewed the concert as a chance for Beyoncé to remind people that her [...] "vocal chops" [...] are what got her where she stands today as an artist, and concluded that Michael Jackson and Diana Ross would be very proud of Beyoncé's accomplishments and performances on 4 Intimate Nights with Beyoncé.|$|E

The story was <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> prior story at the studio, was longer in running time, and had four {{times the number of}} locations. Supervising {{technical}} director Rick Sayre noted that the hardest thing about the film was that there was [...] "no hardest thing," [...] alluding to the amount of new technical challenges: fire, water, air, smoke, steam, and explosions were all additional to the new difficulty of working with humans. The film's organizational structure could not be mapped out like previous Pixar features, and it became a running joke to the team. Sayre said the team adopted “Alpha Omega," [...] where one team was concerned with building modeling, shading and layout and another dealt with final camera, lighting, and effects. Another team, dubbed as the character team, digitally sculpted, rigged, and shaded the characters, and a simulation team was responsible for developing simulation technology for hair and clothing. There were 781 visual effects shots in the film, and they were quite often visual gags, such as the window shattering when Bob angrily shuts the car door. In addition, the effects team improved their modeling of clouds, using volumetric rendering for the first time.|$|E

BBC Radio 2 noted that {{the composition of the}} song is [...] "deceptively simple, but its veins run with the whole history of electronic music." [...] They described the song's bassline as [...] "pulsing," [...] and recognised influences of English rock band New Order and German electronic music band Kraftwerk.
