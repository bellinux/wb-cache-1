5|$|The Freedmen's Bureau agent {{wrote to}} Congressman William Kelley of Pennsylvania {{requesting}} {{the removal of}} Johnston's disabilities because of his charity. Kelly did so and the bill passed <b>both</b> <b>houses</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress.</b> Johnston only discovered all of this when he read about {{the passage of the}} bill in the newspaper.|$|E
5|$|When Harding {{joined the}} U.S. Senate, the Democrats {{controlled}} <b>both</b> <b>houses</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress,</b> and {{were led by}} President Wilson. As a junior senator in the minority, Harding received unimportant committee assignments, but carried out those duties assiduously. He was a safe, conservative, Republican vote. As during {{his time in the}} Ohio Senate, Harding came to be widely liked.|$|E
50|$|The Argentine general {{election}} of 1989 {{was held on}} 14 May 1989. Voters chose both the President and their legislators and with a turnout of 85.3%, Carlos Menem won the presidency, and the Justicialist Party won the control <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>house</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress.</b> This is the last presidential election the president was elected by the electoral college.|$|R

5|$|John Cabell Breckinridge (January 16, 1821 – May 17, 1875) was an American lawyer, politician, and soldier. He {{represented}} Kentucky in <b>both</b> <b>houses</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> {{and became}} the 14th and youngest-ever Vice President of the United States, serving from 1857 to 1861. He served in the U.S. Senate during {{the outbreak of the}} American Civil War, but was expelled after joining the Confederate Army. He was appointed Confederate Secretary of War in 1865.|$|E
5|$|Landman {{had also}} been a {{prominent}} opponent of Zionism: when, in 1922, the United States Congress was considering the Lodge–Fish resolution {{in support of the}} Balfour Declaration, Landman and Rabbi David Philipson had presented the Reform movement's (then) anti-Zionist position to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. Landman also printed many opinions against the resolution and Zionism in his American Hebrew Magazine. The bill was eventually unanimously supported by <b>both</b> <b>houses</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress,</b> and approved by President Harding.|$|E
5|$|The Cooper–Church Amendment was resurrected {{during the}} winter and {{incorporated}} into the Supplementary Foreign Assistance Act of 1970. This time the measure made it through <b>both</b> <b>houses</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> and became law on 22 December. As a result, all U.S. ground troops and advisors were barred from participating in military actions in Laos or Cambodia, while the air war being conducted in both countries by the U.S. Air Force was ignored.|$|E
5|$|However, {{because of}} {{political}} infighting between Liberal Republicans and Democrats, and due to several campaign blunders, the physically ailing Greeley {{was no match for}} Grant, who won in a landslide. Grant won 286 of the 352 Electoral College votes, and received 55.8 {{percent of the popular vote}} nationwide. The President's reelection victory also brought an overwhelming Republican majority into <b>both</b> <b>house</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress.</b> Heartbroken after a hard fought political campaign, Greeley died a few weeks after the election. Out of respect for Greeley, Grant attended his funeral.|$|R

5|$|The {{race was}} never close, and the Nixon/Agnew ticket won 49 states and over 60 {{percent of the}} vote in gaining re-election. Trying to {{position}} himself as the frontrunner for 1976, Agnew campaigned widely for Republican candidates, something Nixon would not do. Despite Agnew's efforts, Democrats easily held <b>both</b> <b>houses</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress,</b> gaining two seats in the Senate, though the Republicans gained twelve in the House.|$|E
5|$|Clay, though embittered {{by another}} of his many defeats for the presidency, was appeased by Tyler's {{withdrawal}} from the still-unresolved Senate race, which would permit the election of Rives, and campaigned in Virginia for the Harrison/Tyler ticket. Tyler predicted the Whigs would easily take Virginia; he was embarrassed when he was proved wrong, but was consoled by an overall victory—Harrison and Tyler won by an electoral vote of 234–60 and with 53 {{percent of the popular}} vote. Van Buren took only seven scattered states out of 26. The Whigs gained control of <b>both</b> <b>houses</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to desegregating public schools, Nixon implemented the Philadelphia Plan in 1970—the first significant federal affirmative action program. He also endorsed the Equal Rights Amendment after it passed <b>both</b> <b>houses</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> in 1972 {{and went to}} the states for ratification. Nixon had campaigned as an ERA supporter in 1968, though feminists criticized him for doing little to help the ERA or their cause after his election. Nevertheless, he appointed more women to administration positions than Lyndon Johnson had.|$|E
5|$|Under Section 2, {{whenever}} {{there is a}} vacancy {{in the office of}} Vice President, the President nominates a successor who becomes Vice President if confirmed by a majority vote <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>Houses</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Congress.</b>|$|R

5|$|In the 1946 elections, Republicans wrested {{control of}} <b>both</b> <b>houses</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> from the Democrats {{for the first}} time since the Great Depression and gained control of the {{majority}} of state governments. The power of labor unions had expanded under Roosevelt and the Democrats, and when a 1946 railroad worker strike exacerbated a post-war recession the Republican majorities – over Barkley's objection – curbed union power via the Taft–Hartley Act. They also passed the Twenty-second Amendment, limiting the president to two terms, a posthumous slap at Roosevelt.|$|E
5|$|The Democrats lost {{seats in}} the Senate in the 1950 {{election}} cycle, and party leader Ernest McFarland removed Clinton Anderson {{as chairman of the}} Senate Democratic Reelection Committee, replacing him with Clements for the 1952 election cycle. Clements advocated better cooperation between his committee and the Democratic National Committee in 1952. However, Republicans won the presidency and <b>both</b> <b>houses</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> in 1952, and the Democratic National Committee talked openly of disbanding the Reelection Committee. Clements instead advised that his committee's responsibilities be expanded and that its activities become year-round rather than seasonal.|$|E
5|$|Within a {{month of}} the 2010 midterm elections, Obama {{announced}} a compromise deal with the Congressional Republican leadership that included a temporary, two-year extension of the 2001 and 2003 income tax rates, a one-year payroll tax reduction, continuation of unemployment benefits, and a new rate and exemption amount for estate taxes. The compromise overcame opposition from some in both parties, and the resulting $858billion Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 passed with bipartisan majorities in <b>both</b> <b>houses</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> before Obama signed it on December 17, 2010.|$|E

5|$|By early 1896, {{many in the}} Democratic Party were bitterly {{opposed to}} President Cleveland and his policies. The United States was by then {{in the third year}} of a deep recession, the Panic of 1893. Cleveland was a firm {{supporter}} of the gold standard, and soon after the recession began forced through repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, which he believed had helped cause it. Sherman's act, although not restoring bimetallism, had required the government to purchase and coin large quantities of silver bullion, and its repeal outraged supporters of free silver. Other Cleveland policies, such as his forcible suppression of the Pullman strike, led to the Democrats losing control of <b>both</b> <b>houses</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> in the 1894 midterm elections, and to a revolt against him by silver supporters within his party.|$|E
5|$|Constitutional {{objections}} {{were raised}} in House debates as to whether <b>both</b> <b>houses</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> could constitutionally authorize admission of territories, rather than states. Moreover, if the Republic of Texas, a nation in its own right, were admitted as a state, its territorial boundaries, property relations (including slave property), debts and public lands would require a Senate-ratified treaty. Democrats were particularly uneasy about burdening the United States with $10 million in Texas debt, resenting the deluge of speculators, who had bought Texas bonds cheap and now lobbied Congress for the Texas House bill. House Democrats, at an impasse, relinquished the legislative initiative to the southern Whigs.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{irregularities}} in {{the approval of}} the Lecompton Constitution by Kansas voters, Breckinridge agreed with Buchanan that it was legitimate, but he kept his position secret, and some believed he agreed with his friend, Stephen Douglas, that Lecompton was invalid. Breckinridge's absence from the Senate during debate on admitting Kansas to the Union under Lecompton seemed to confirm this, but his leave—to take his wife from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where she was recovering from an illness, to Washington, D.C.—had been planned for months. The death of his grandmother, Polly Breckinridge, prompted him to leave earlier than planned. During his absence, <b>both</b> <b>houses</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> voted to re-submit the Lecompton Constitution to Kansas voters for approval. On resubmission, it was overwhelmingly rejected.|$|E

5|$|Harrison won 19 of the 26 states, {{including}} New York (home to Van Buren), Kentucky (to Johnson) and Tennessee (Jackson). Van Buren did win in Virginia, {{the state}} of birth of both Whig candidates, and in Illinois, with Lincoln defeated for elector. The electoral vote count was 234 for Harrison and 60 for Van Buren, with the popular vote closer at 1,275,390 for Harrison to 1,128,854 for Van Buren. Of the 60 Van Buren electors, 12 did not vote for Johnson, with 11 (all from South Carolina) choosing Littleton W. Tazewell for vice president, and one (from Virginia) favoring Governor James K. Polk of Tennessee. Turnout was 81 percent of eligible voters, setting a record since surpassed only in 1860 and 1876. The Whigs took <b>both</b> <b>houses</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress,</b> {{and a majority of}} state governorships.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Congress {{passed the}} Line Item Veto Act, which allowed the {{president}} to cancel items from an appropriations bill (a bill authorizing spending) once passed into law. The statute was challenged the following year. The matter rapidly reached the Supreme Court, which struck down the law as violating the Presentment Clause of the Constitution, which governs {{what the president is}} permitted to do with a bill once it has passed <b>both</b> <b>houses</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress.</b> Scalia dissented, seeing no Presentment Clause difficulties and feeling that the act did not violate separation of powers. Scalia indicated he felt that authorizing {{the president to}} cancel an appropriation was no different from allowing him to spend an appropriation at his discretion, which had long been accepted as constitutional.|$|E
5|$|Interested {{parties on}} both sides filed amici. A group of {{conservative}} Republicans in <b>both</b> <b>houses</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress,</b> including Newt Gingrich, Dick Armey, Henry Hyde and Rick Santorum, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children both argued for affirming the conviction, pointing to the invaluable nature of undercover investigations in fighting child pornography, worrying that requiring reasonable suspicion beforehand could make such operations impossible. Americans for Effective Law Enforcement {{said there had been}} no entrapment and that reasonable suspicion was not required before starting investigations such as Looking Glass. The American Civil Liberties Union, its Nebraska chapter and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers weighed in on Jacobson's behalf.|$|E
