Mr. Duguid calculated the transverse <b>breaking</b> <b>strain</b> of average anchor-iron (8 1/2 inches x 4 = 22 square inches), at 83 1/10 tons; and the tensile <b>breaking</b> <b>strain</b> at 484 tons, or 22 tons to the square inch; while the stud-length cable of 1 1/8 inch chain, 150 fathoms long, would carry, if proof, 24 tons.

60|$|Here {{he saw the}} {{important}} and delicate core again carefully tested as to its electrical condition, after which it received a new jacket of tanned jute yarn {{to protect it from}} the iron top coat yet to come. Its jute jacket on, it was then coiled away in tanks full of water, where it was constantly kept submerged and continuously tested for insulation. Last of all the top coat was put on. This consisted of ten wires of peculiarly fine and strong iron. Each of these ten wires had put on it a special coat of its own, made of tarred Manilla yarn, to protect it from rust as well as to lighten its specific gravity. The core being brought from its tank, and passed round several sheaves, which carried it below the factory floor, was drawn up {{through a hole in the}} centre of a circular table, around the circumference of which were ten drums of the Manilla-covered wire. A stout iron rod, fastened to the circumference of the table, rose from between each drum to the ceiling, converging in a cone which passed through to the floor above. Our core rose in the middle of all, and went through the hollow of the cone. When all was put in noisy and bewildering motion, the core which rose from the turning-table and whirling drums as a thin jute-clad line, came out in the floor above a stout iron-clad cable, with a Manilla top-dressing, possessing strength sufficient to bear eleven miles of its own length perpendicularly suspended in water--or a margin of strength more than four and a half times that required,--and with a <b>breaking</b> <b>strain</b> of seven tons fifteen hundredweight.|$|E
50|$|March enthusiasts {{have argued}} that the trio sections' mellow and moving phrases are among Sousa's most musical. Six sudden eighth notes move the melody along.

50|$|The trio {{begins with}} another {{introduction}} {{that has the}} high and middle voices playing chords in tied half notes and whole notes as the lower choir plays a little passage of quarter notes. Like almost all major key marches, it adds one more flat {{and is now in}} the key of concert D Major. The melody for the trio is in the flutes, first clarinet, first trumpet, tenor saxophones and euphonium and is played at a dynamic of piano. The main melody of the trio is repeated with no other voices changing; the portion is repeated at a softer dynamic once more. Much like the second <b>strain,</b> the <b>break</b> <b>strain</b> transitions strongly into its melody from the second strain only this time it is in B minor and repeats the passage one whole step down. The last few measures of the <b>break</b> <b>strain</b> jump down from fortissimo to mezzo-forte and builds back up with eighth notes being passed {{back and forth between the}} upper voices and the euphoniums and tenor saxes until the end of the crescendo is reached. The third time through the trio melody, the euphoniums and upper woodwinds play small passages of eighth notes in a counter melody to the established melody in the cornets, trombones and first bassoons. The section repeats one more time from the <b>break</b> <b>strain</b> and the collective ensemble finishes the piece in a homogenized fortissimo ending.|$|R

6000|$|... "Some {{fifty miles}} below the Inner Station {{we came upon}} a hut of reeds, an {{inclined}} and melancholy pole, with the unrecognizable tatters {{of what had been}} a flag of some sort flying from it, and a neatly stacked woodpile. This was unexpected. We came to the bank, and on the stack of firewood found a flat piece of board with some faded pencil-writing on it. When deciphered it said: 'Wood for you. Hurry up. Approach cautiously.' There was a signature, but it was illegible--not Kurtz--a much longer word. 'Hurry up.' Where? Up the river? 'Approach cautiously.' We had not done so. But the warning could not have been meant for the place where it could be only found after approach. Something was wrong above. But what--and how much? That was the question. We commented adversely upon the imbecility of that telegraphic style. The bush around said nothing, and would not let us look very far, either. A torn curtain of red twill hung {{in the doorway of the}} hut, and flapped sadly in our faces. The dwelling was dismantled; but we could see a white man had lived there not very long ago. There remained a rude table--a plank on two posts; a heap of rubbish reposed in a dark corner, and by the door I picked up a book. It had lost its covers, and the pages had been thumbed into a state of extremely dirty softness; but the back had been lovingly stitched afresh with white cotton thread, which looked clean yet. It was an extraordinary find. Its title was, 'An Inquiry into some Points of Seamanship,' by a man Tower, Towson--some such name--Master in his Majesty's Navy. The matter looked dreary reading enough, with illustrative diagrams and repulsive tables of figures, and the copy was sixty years old. I handled this amazing antiquity with the greatest possible tenderness, lest it should dissolve in my hands. Within, Towson or Towser was inquiring earnestly into the <b>breaking</b> <b>strain</b> of ships' chains and tackle, and other such matters. Not a very enthralling book; but at the first glance you could see there a singleness of intention, an honest concern for the right way of going to work, which made these humble pages, thought out so many years ago, luminous with another than a professional light. The simple old sailor, with his talk of chains and purchases, made me forget the jungle and the pilgrims in a delicious sensation of having come upon something unmistakably real. Such a book being there was wonderful enough; but still more astounding were the notes penciled in the margin, and plainly referring to the text. I couldn't believe my eyes! They were in cipher! Yes, it looked like cipher. Fancy a man lugging with him a book of that description into this nowhere and studying it--and making notes--in cipher at that! It was an extravagant mystery.|$|E

50|$|Most of the time, {{the fishing}} line used for sport fishing has a <b>breaking</b> <b>strain</b> {{less than the}} maximum force the fish can apply to the line.

Eventually, if the fish tires and has not broken the line, they will be reeled in; however, the challenge does not end there.

A stack consisting of Nafion?? 211 membrane held between Toray Carbon paper and bipolar plates was alternatingly placed in - 20 ??C and room temperature conditions. After 50, 75, 100 freeze-thaw cycles the membranes were removed from the simulated stack set-up and a tensile test was performed on them. Membranes were tested in conditions of 25 ??C, 30 % relative humidity and 80 ??C, 90 % relative humidity. After testing the membranes the properties such as Young???s modulus, proportional limit stress, <b>break</b> <b>strain,</b> and swelling strain were analyzed and compared with results from previous work on membranes that had not undergone freeze thaw cycles.
