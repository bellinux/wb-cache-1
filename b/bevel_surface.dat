5000|$|The mortise chisel, {{even in its}} heavyweight [...] "pigsticker" [...] form, is used {{differently}} from a twybill, although the two may be used together. The twybill cuts the sides of mortices, along the grain. Its action is a splitting and prying one, so only requires a handle for leverage and is never struck. Mortise chisels are used for heavy chopping across the grain, are nearly always struck, and are used to square up the ends of square-ended mortises. Both tools are used for levering out chunks when first clearing out a mortise and so have similarly shaped bevels, often with a curved <b>bevel</b> <b>surface</b> for a better fulcrum action.|$|E

We investigated the depth of resistivity-reduced regions which was formed by various hydrogenating conditions and found that the region was extended to the same depth as the penetration depth of hydrogen.

40|$|Secondary ion mass {{spectrometry}} (SIMS) is an invaluable technique for the characterisation of semiconductor materials. The effects of beam induced mixing and/or sputter induced topography, however, {{can make the}} SIMS analysis of the layered structures very difficult due {{to the loss of}} depth resolution and inter-peak dynamic range with depth. Accurate quantification of shallow implanted materials is also particularly difficult due to the changing erosion rates and ion yields during the initial part of the analysis. The bevel-SIMS approach is a process that offers the potential of overcoming these adverse effects. The primary material investigated in this work was shallow boron implanted silicon. Bevels of very small angle (#approx# 100 #mu#rads) were successfully fabricated on the material using a chemical bevelling technique. In this procedure, the material was immersed in an etchant of hydrofluoric acid/nitric acid/acetic acid at 25 deg. C. Accurate analysis of the chemically etched bevels was performed, for the first time, using a 3 D optical interferometer. This technique enabled the whole <b>bevelled</b> <b>surface</b> to be accurately mapped and a digital image to be stored. SIMS imaging was then carried out on the <b>bevelled</b> <b>surface</b> and the image data converted to produce a boron depth profile. The results have been compared to conventional SIMS depth profiling, and it was observed that the bevel-image technique displayed none of the transient effects displayed by the SISM depth profiles. Bevel fabrication by focussed ion beam (FEB) milling was also investigated. Si/SiGe MQW structures were bevelled at 1 deg. The exposed surface was then analysed by SIMS imaging and the image data used to produce depth profiles. These results have been compared to cross sectional transmission electron microscopy (X-TEM) as well as conventional depth profiling. In this case, it was observed that residual damage caused by the FEB milling stage seriously degraded the resulting depth profile.

A north-south wing dating back to both the 16th and 17th centuries abuts the original house. The wall of the sole remaining {{part of the original}} mediaeval building is 33 inches thick.

In the fifth, sixth and seventh groups, the teeth were apicoectomized and capped on the <b>bevelled</b> root <b>surface</b> with one of the following materiais: a dentin bonding system plus composite resin, a glass ionomer cement or a compomer. Two specimens of each experimental group were evaluated for the marginal adaptation using scanning electron microscopy.

40|$|Spiral {{bevel gears}} are used widely in the {{transmission}} systems of several mechanical applications. The design of {{spiral bevel gears}} is very complicated. This {{is due to the}} complexity of the gear tooth geometry. This research concentrates on a special type of spiral bevel gears, the Palloid spiral bevel gears. The design methodology is based on the concepts of the machine kinematics. This delivers a numerical model of the spiral <b>bevel</b> gear tooth <b>surfaces.</b> The concept of a three dimensional vector analysis is applied. In addition, the condition of the tangential contact between the meshing surfaces of the cutting tool and gear blank is utilised. This is performed using the mathematical modelling software package MATLAB. The data points of the gear tooth surfaces obtained from MATLAB are defined as the nodes of the finite element mesh avoiding using a CAD package. In order to achieve high accuracy of gear geometry CAD software has to be avoided as the loss of accuracy is a problem combined with using CAD software.

These canyons are Late Miocene landforms based on a new ignimbrite stratigraphy supported by 42 new 40 Ar/ 39 Ar age determinations obtained on plateau-forming and valley-filling ignimbrites. Between 19 and 13 Ma, a gently sloping <b>surface</b> <b>bevelling</b> the clastic wedge southeast of the developing mountain front was mantled by widespread ignimbrites. After 13 Ma, this paleosurface was tilted up from 2. 2 km a. s. l. at the mountain front to 4. 3 km a. s. l. {{at the base of}} the Pliocene and Pleistocene volcanoes that crown the southwestern edge of the Altiplano. The canyons incised this topography after 9 Ma, while the dated base of younger ignimbrite valley fills suggests that these canyons had been cut down to near their present depths as early as 3. 8 Ma.

Valley incision since 9 Ma at an average rate of 0. 2 mm yrâ 1 is the response to topographic uplift after 13 Ma combined with increasing runoff due to a wetter climate recorded after 7 Ma.

40|$|The stratigraphy, sedimentology, and {{paleontology}} of the Coquimbo Formation in {{a coastal}} section approximately 100 km north of La Serena was Studied to establish relative low-order sea-level changes during the Neogene. During the Early-Middle Miocene, a wide coastal platform was bevelled onto Palaeozoic basement rocks, and marine sedimentation {{may have taken}} place within a deep coastal inlet later transformed into a submarine canyon. Transgression over this platform commenced during the late Burdigalian-early Langhian (16 - 15 Ma) and culminated in a sea-level highstand {{near the end of}} the Serravalian (11. 8 Ma). This transgression was followed by regression during the rest of the Serravalian and Tortonian until approximately 9 Ma. Renewed transgression during the Messinian was Succeeded by regression lasting until 5. 5 Ma, when another transgressive cycle <b>bevelled</b> a ravinement <b>Surface</b> into the underlying deposits. This cycle terminated in a marine highstand during the Zanclean at 4. 9 Ma. Thereafter, the succession changed front enter platform to middle shoreface deposition. Rapid flooding at 3. 9 Ma resulted in the formation of an extensively bored phosphatic hardground, which represents a condensed section. A lowstand during the Piacenzian is represented by inner-shelfdeposits, followed by a return to outer-shelf deposition with contemporaneous upper continental slope sedimentation below the ancient shell'break. The succession is capped by Gelasian upper shoreface deposits dated at 2. 0 - 1. 8 Ma. The reemergence of the shelf during the Pleistocene (1. 0 Ma) formed an extensive coastal plain covered by fluvioestuarine, shelly gravel. Subsequently, four marine terraces were carved into the Succession in the last 0. 5 Ma. A comparison of the recorded sea-level changes with global sea-level Curves provides a reconstruction of local tectonic uplift and downwarp events during the Neogene-Quaternary.
