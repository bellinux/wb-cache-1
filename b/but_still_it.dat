25|$|In {{the opening}} {{race of the}} season, it was a solid start for the Williams team to {{celebrate}} its 30 years in Formula One as Nico Rosberg finally took his first podium finish while Nakajima scored his first points in Formula One in just his 2nd race for Williams. However, the remaining races saw the team slipping backwards and often struggling to score points. But the new Singapore Grand Prix saw Rosberg finish in a shock second place in front title contender of Lewis Hamilton. Williams were looking set to clinch their first victory since the 2004 Brazilian Grand Prix but Rosberg just could not overtake another shock podium finisher and winner Fernando Alonso. Thus, a first victory for Rosberg was denied <b>but</b> <b>still</b> <b>it</b> was his best finish in Formula One until the 2012 Chinese Grand Prix where he finished first after starting from pole position. The team eventually finished the season with 26 points, convincingly beaten by the Toyota F1 team.|$|E

[...] His teammate Nico Hülkenberg had finished the race in front of him, and said after the race: [...] "The Safety Car ended up playing into my hands, which is the little bit of luck you always need to get a good result". Speaking about the race, 14th-placed Jenson Button said: [...] "Painful, I think, is the word. I was on the harder tyre at the start <b>but</b> <b>still</b> <b>it</b> was just waving goodbye to everyone in front really." [...] He also stated that he believed that McLaren were more affected by the high altitude than the other teams. On his one-lap outing, Fernando Alonso explained that the problem that caused his retirement had been discovered the night before. He added: [...] "We had two possibilities, retire the car without even starting the race or try our maximum, knowing that maybe one or two laps was the maximum we could achieve [...] We did one lap, for respect of the fans because they were amazing all weekend." ...|$|E
