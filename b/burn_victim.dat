5|$|The {{decision}} was also made to bring Freddy's physical appearance {{closer to that}} of an actual <b>burn</b> <b>victim,</b> {{and the use of}} computer-generated imagery was used in certain sections of Haley's face to further assist in that vision. A Nightmare on Elm Street was primarily filmed in Illinois because of the positive experience the producers of Platinum Dunes had when filming other films in the same area.|$|E
25|$|In New Nightmare, Freddy's {{appearance}} is updated considerably, {{giving him a}} green fedora that matched his sweater stripes, skin-tight leather pants, knee-high black boots, a turtleneck version of his trademark sweater, a dark blue trench coat, and a fifth claw on his glove, which also has a far more organic appearance, resembling the exposed muscle tissue of an actual hand. Freddy also has fewer burns on his face, though these are more severe, with his muscle tissue exposed in numerous places. Compared to his other incarnations, this Freddy's injuries are more like those of an actual <b>burn</b> <b>victim.</b> For the 2010 remake, Freddy is returned to his iconic attire, but the burns on his face are intensified with further bleaching of the skin and exposed facial tissue on the left cheek, more reminiscent of actual third degree burns than in the original series.|$|E
500|$|Discussing his {{physical}} appearance, Form and Fuller explained that Freddy {{would be more}} similar to a real <b>burn</b> <b>victim.</b> Form later clarified {{that there was a}} fine line {{they did not want to}} cross when it came to making Freddy look like a true <b>burn</b> <b>victim.</b> According to the producer, the crew had many reference photos of actual victims, which detailed how white the skin would appear after healing. Form did not want the audience to turn away in disgust every time Freddy was on the screen, so they opted to hold back on some of the realism. Fuller noted how horrific the images were, and how difficult they were to look at. The special effects crew that worked on The Dark Knight, creating the computer-generated images (CGI) for Two-Face's face, were brought in to work on the minimal CGI used for Freddy's face. The CGI is used in conjunction with the special effects make-up that Haley wears. The prosthetics used to create Freddy's physical look were designed by Andrew Clement. Haley described the experience of wearing all of the prosthetics and make-up as [...] "pretty encumbering".|$|E

The producers revealed the episode title on June 30, 2010. After they began their search in mid-June for a fifty- to sixty-year-old actress to play Olivia's mother, Entertainment Weekly reported on July 2 that Amy Madigan had been cast as Marilyn Dunham for roughly four episodes, beginning with the season premiere. The character was described as [...] "lovely and together" [...] and deeply devoted to her daughter. Further reporting a week later revealed that The Wire actor Andre Royo had been cast for the season premiere as Henry Higgins, [...] "a soulful taxi driver who is unexpectedly forced into a tense situation with Olivia". Henry Higgins is also {{the name of a}} character in My Fair Lady. Even before [...] "Olivia" [...] aired, Royo's guest appearance was extended to appear in a second episode.

40|$|Background: <b>Burn</b> <b>victims</b> {{experience}} immense {{physical and}} mental hardship during their process of rehabilitation and regaining functionality. We examined different objective burn related factors as well as psychological ones, {{in the form of}} personality traits, that may affect the rehabilitation process and its outcome. Objective: To assess the influence and correlation of specific personality traits and objective injury related parameters on the adjustment of <b>burn</b> <b>victims</b> post-injury. Methods: 62 male patients admitted to our burn unit due to burn injuries were compared with 36 healthy male individuals by use of questionnaires to assess each group's psychological adjustment parameters. Multivariate and hierarchical regression analysis was conducted to identify differences between the groups. Results: A significant negative correlation was found between the objective burn injury severity (e. g. TBSA and burn depth) and the adjustment of <b>burn</b> <b>victims</b> (p< 0. 05, p< 0. 001, table 3). Moreover, patients more severely injured tend to be more neurotic (p< 0. 001), and less extroverted and agreeable (p< 0. 01, table 4). Conclusions: Extroverted <b>burn</b> <b>victims</b> tend to adjust better to their post-injury life while the neurotic patients tend to have difficulties adjusting. This finding may suggest new tools for early identification of maladjustment-prone patients and therefore provide them with better psychological support in a more dedicated manner...|$|R

ResultsThe study showed varied first aid knowledge and administration outcomes as a result of different substances such as water or sand, muddy water, starch, corn dough, cow dung, egg white, calamine lotion, gentian violet, ointments, creams, lotions, tooth paste etc. applied as first aid. ConclusionsBurn injuries are common in our settings, a more reason for all to know the immediate intervention to give to victims of such accidents.
