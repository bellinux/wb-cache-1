25|$|The video {{begins with}} Pink World's main character, Artemus, shown in his bedroom, {{looking out the}} window at a {{helicopter}} that follows him throughout {{the first half of the}} video. He is then shown holding a small globe that is glowing red. His mother enters and puts the globe under his bed and tucks him in. With the helicopter following him, the scene changes to a large institutional setting filled with empty beds. He appears sad and confused as his mother washes him. He sees a vision of crowds of people in the Barrier (foreshadowing the scene in the second part of the video). The first part of the video ends as we see Artemus again looking out of his bedroom window, the institution and the crowds in the Barrier apparently a vision. He climbs <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>bed.</b> The plot in the first part of the video is not linear. Scenes are interspersed with flashbacks and future visions.|$|E
60|$|Joan crept <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>bed.</b> A new wonder {{had come}} to her. And from that night Joan's belief in Mrs. Munday's God began to fade, {{circumstances}} helping.|$|E
60|$|He ran lightly downstairs, and {{the young}} man, {{sitting on the edge}} of the bed, waited. Ten minutes passed, and he heard Mr. Wragg returning, {{followed}} by his niece. He slipped <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>bed</b> again.|$|E
50|$|The {{pressurized}} module {{contains a}} small bathroom with privacy curtains and a shower head producing a water mist for sponge baths. It also contains cabinets for tools, workbench areas and two crew seats that can fold <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>beds.</b>|$|R
60|$|The harness broke, with {{a flying}} mess of straps and rope, {{and the car}} plumped with perfect {{exactness}} <b>back</b> <b>into</b> its <b>bed.</b>|$|R
60|$|A fellow {{held his}} arms while he {{loosened}} the stocking {{clinging to his}} foot and climbed <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the hot <b>bed.</b>|$|R
60|$|He got <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>bed</b> agin {{and laid}} there {{listening}} to Ginger waking up Peter. Peter woke up disagreeable, but when Ginger told 'im that Sam 'ad stole a gold locket {{as big as}} a saucer, covered with diamonds, he altered 'is mind.|$|E
60|$|Rage had transfigured her. She {{scarcely}} {{heard her}} own words. They poured out senselessly, monotonously, one calling up another, {{as if from}} the lips of a Cassandra. Lawford sank <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>bed,</b> clutching the sheets with both lean hands. He {{took a deep breath}} and shut his mouth.|$|E
6000|$|Once {{her husband}} said, [...] "What's the matter? It {{seems to me}} you'd rest better if you'd lay down and keep quiet." [...] His voice was low enough, {{but it had a}} {{peculiar}} inflection, which made her sink <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>bed</b> by his side, shivering with fear and weeping silently.|$|E
50|$|It is {{nighttime}} and Mickey Mouse {{is doing}} his night prayers before bedtime. As he gets <b>into</b> <b>bed,</b> Pluto joins Mickey, but then gets sent to his basket as he's a dog. As soon as Mickey falls asleep, Pluto creeps <b>back</b> <b>into</b> Mickey's <b>bed</b> and licks his face. Mickey dreams a mysterious dream about when he proposed to Minnie Mouse and got married at the church after the proposal.|$|R
60|$|He went <b>back</b> <b>into</b> his <b>bed.</b> It was {{opposite}} the window; and the window, {{being at the}} side of the old cottage, looked out on the great open space above the river. When the moonlight appeared, it shone straight into his eyes. I offered to pull down the blind.|$|R
60|$|As {{the room}} was scantily heated, Crabtree lost no time in disrobing. Having donned a long night robe, {{he turned off the}} gas, flung the sheets <b>back,</b> and leaped <b>into</b> <b>bed.</b>|$|R
60|$|Emma {{suffered}} acutely from Mrs. Harkey's visits. Something {{mean and}} wearying went {{out from her}} presence, and her sharp, bold face was a constant irritation. Sometimes when she thought herself alone, Emma crawled to the window which looked up the Coolly, toward Sarah's home, and sat there silently longing to send out a cry for help. But {{at the sound of}} Jane Harkey's step she fled <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>bed</b> like a frightened child.|$|E
60|$|I {{was nearly}} struck dumb with horror on seeing my wife with this hideous female ghoul. They passed by me without noticing me, began {{to dig up}} a corpse which had been buried that day, and then {{sat down on the}} edge of the grave, to enjoy their frightful repast, talking quietly and cheerfully all the while, though I was too far off to hear what they said. When they had finished, they threw back the body into the grave, and heaped back the earth upon it. I made no effort to disturb them, and {{returned}} quickly to the house, when I took care to leave the door open, as I had previously found it. Then I got <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>bed,</b> and pretended to sleep soundly.|$|E
60|$|Then he {{rose and}} tried to dress; but his head ached more than ever, his legs seemed to belong to someone else, and to be no subject of just {{complacency}} to their owner. He reeled as he strove to cross the room, then he struggled <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>bed,</b> where, feeling alternately hot and cold, he covered himself with his ulster, {{in addition to his}} blankets. Anywhere but in college, Maitland would, of course, have rung the bell and called his servant; but in our conservative universities, and especially in so reverend a pile as St. Gatiens, there was, naturally, no bell to ring. Maitland began to try to huddle himself into his greatcoat, that he might crawl to the window and shout to Dakyns, his scout.|$|E
50|$|When the {{embalming}} was completed, {{the remains}} {{were dressed in}} his silk pyjamas and dressing robe and placed <b>back</b> <b>into</b> his <b>bed.</b> Churchill would lie in repose in private at his Hyde Park Gate home until 9:00 pm. Tuesday evening when Kenyon's staff transported his remains to Westminster Hall for public viewing.|$|R
5000|$|In The House of the Spirits by Isabel Allende, Clara Trueba is mute after {{witnessing}} {{her sisters}} molestation and autopsy. [...] "She {{could not move}} until the first lights of dawn appeared. Only then did she slip <b>back</b> <b>into</b> her <b>bed,</b> feeling within her {{the silence of the}} entire world. Silence filled her utterly." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{was thus}} lying, and looking, and dreaming, hanging, as it were, between two epochs of his life, when Alexander {{came to the}} door, and made his {{presence}} known in a loud whisper. John let him in, and jumped <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the warm <b>bed.</b>|$|R
60|$|He woke at dawn {{with a sharp}} twinge in his shoulder, and he rose to {{give himself}} the {{pleasure}} of making his own fire with those fagots of broom and pine twigs which he had enjoyed the night before, promising himself to get <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>bed</b> when the fire was well going, and sleep late. While he stood before the open stove, the jangling of a small bell outside called him to the window, and he saw a procession which had just issued from the church going to administer the extreme unction to some dying person across the piazza. The parish priest went first, bearing the consecrated wafer in its vessel, and at his side an acolyte holding a yellow silk umbrella over the Eucharist; after them came a number of facchini in white robes and white hoods that hid their faces; their tapers burned sallow and lifeless in the new morning light; the bell jangled dismally.|$|E
60|$|She {{could see}} Forts Issy and Vanvres. Both were firing heavily, while between the booms of their guns {{she could hear}} the reports of others. No flashes came back from Meudon or any of the Prussian positions. Nor, though she held her breath to listen, could she hear the sound of musketry. She struck a match and looked at her watch. It was but one o'clock. She closed her window and {{wrapping}} herself up in her dressing-gown sat there for some time looking out. Presently the fire slackened and she crept <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>bed,</b> but again rose when the forts re-opened fire. Then feeling that sleep was impossible she lighted a candle and forced herself to read until daylight. She was dressing when the roar again broke out. This time it was away to the left. She threw on her things, put on her bonnet and cloak, and went out of her room just as M. Michaud issued from his.|$|E
6000|$|After that rhyme, {{which came}} into his head all at once, he became {{conscious}} of music, very soft-lovely! Mum playing! He bethought himself of a macaroon he had, laid up in his chest of drawers, and, getting it, {{came back to the}} window. He leaned out, now munching, now holding his jaws to hear the music better. [...] "Da" [...] used to say that angels played on harps in heaven; but it wasn't half so lovely as Mum playing in the moony night, with him eating a macaroon. A cockchafer buzzed by, a moth flew in his face, the music stopped, and little Jon drew his head in. She must be coming! He didn't want to be found awake. He got <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>bed</b> and pulled the clothes nearly over his head; but he had left a streak of moonlight coming in. It fell across the floor, near the foot of the bed, and he watched it moving ever so slowly towards him, as if it were alive. The music began again, but he could only just hear it now; sleepy music, pretty--sleepy--music--sleepy--slee.....|$|E
50|$|Pipi are edible {{and easily}} {{collected}} for food; traditional cooking methods include boiling and making into fritters. The harvest limit in New Zealand is 150 {{per person per}} day, and although a minimum size is not stipulated in the regulations, only larger pipi should be taken. For Māori, pipi are a traditional food resource, and in earlier times were gathered in specific flax baskets. Smaller specimens would fall between the woven strips and <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the <b>beds</b> as the basket was gently swirled through the water.|$|R
2500|$|Stein died on July 27, 1946 {{at the age}} of 72 {{after surgery}} for stomach cancer at the American Hospital in Neuilly-sur-Seine. [...] She was interred in Paris in Père Lachaise Cemetery. Later Alice B. Toklas was buried {{alongside}} her. According to the famous version of her last moments, before having been taken into surgery, Stein asked her partner Toklas: [...] "What is the answer?" [...] After Toklas replied to Stein that there was no answer, Stein countered by sinking <b>back</b> <b>into</b> her <b>bed,</b> murmuring: [...] "Then, there is no question!" ...|$|R

60|$|The fire {{fought a}} losing battle, {{and at last}} died away, while the frost {{penetrated}} the mossy chinks between the logs and chilled the inner atmosphere. The dogs outside ceased their howling, and, curled up in the snow, dreamed of salmon-stocked heavens where dog-drivers and kindred task-masters were not. Within, the sailor lay like a log, while his host tossed restlessly about, the victim of strange fantasies. As midnight drew near he suddenly threw off the blankets and got up. It was remarkable {{that he could do}} what he then did without ever striking a light. Perhaps {{it was because of the}} darkness that he kept his eyes shut, and perhaps it was for fear he would see the terrible gash on the cheek of his visitor; but, be this as it may, it is a fact that, unseeing, he opened his ammunition box, put a heavy charge into the muzzle of the shotgun without spilling a particle, rammed it down with double wads, and then put everything away and got <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>bed.</b>|$|E
6000|$|You {{return to}} bed, and lie {{listening}} to somebody being dragged upstairs, evidently against their will. By a thoughtful arrangement the spare rooms at [...] "Beggarbush" [...] are exactly underneath the nurseries. The same somebody, you conclude, still offering the most creditable opposition, {{is being put}} <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>bed.</b> You can follow the contest with much exactitude, because every time the body is flung down upon the spring mattress, the bedstead, just above your head, makes a sort of jump; while every time the body succeeds in struggling out again, you are aware by the thud upon the floor. After a time the struggle wanes, or maybe the bed collapses; and you drift back into sleep. But the next moment, or {{what seems to be}} the next moment, you again open your eyes under the consciousness of a presence. The door is being held ajar, and four solemn faces, piled one on top of the other, are peering at you, as though you were some natural curiosity kept in this particular room. Seeing you awake, the top face, walking calmly over the other three, comes in and sits on the bed in a friendly attitude.|$|E
6000|$|It was the {{sun that}} awoke Ruby, by shining in {{at one of}} the small windows of the library, in which he slept. Of course it did not shine in his face, because of the {{relative}} positions of the library and the sun, the first being just below the lantern, and the second just above the horizon, so that the rays struck upwards, and shone with dazzling brilliancy on the dome-shaped ceiling. This was the second time of wakening for Ruby that night, since he lay down to rest. The first wakening was occasioned by the winding up of the machinery which kept the lights in motion, and the chain of which, with a ponderous weight attached to it, passed through a wooden pilaster close to his ear, causing such a sudden and hideous din that the sleeper, not having been warned of it, sprang like a Jack-in-the-box out of bed {{into the middle of the}} room, where he first stared vacantly around him like an unusually surprised owl, and then, guessing the cause of the noise, smiled pitifully, as though to say, [...] "Poor fellow, you're easily frightened," [...] and tumbled <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>bed,</b> where he fell asleep again instantly.|$|E
60|$|Jack led me {{gently to}} my bed, and, seating {{me on the}} edge of it, sat down beside me. I at once {{perceived}} from their looks that they all thought me mad, and felt the necessity of calming me before taking more forcible measures. This tickled me so much that I laughed again heartily, insomuch that Jack could not help joining me. Suddenly a thought flashed into my mind. My heart leaped to my throat, and I glanced downwards. It was there! I seized Jack's right leg, tumbled him <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the <b>bed,</b> and laying the limb across my knee, grasped it violently.|$|R
50|$|It {{turned out}} it was really Paulina who had shot him. Jake blackmailed Paulina into marrying him {{so he could get}} his hands on the Cory fortune. He still refused to let go of Marley, who was now with Jamie. Marley {{wanted nothing to do with}} Jake, but he kept pushing himself into her life, even making bets that he could get her <b>back</b> <b>into</b> his <b>bed.</b> His {{marriage}} to Paulina broke up, and Jake was torn between chasing after her and working on getting Marley back. Marley left town, and Jake wormed his way <b>back</b> <b>into</b> Paulina's life. They married again, but Jake put their marriage in jeopardy when he went along with Vicky's scam to pretend that her son, Kirkland, was a foundling that Paulina had discovered.|$|R
6000|$|The {{next day}} he was moved to a private hotel on the north side, and Mary {{breathed a sigh of}} deep relief as she saw him sink <b>back</b> <b>into</b> his soft <b>bed</b> in a clean and sunny room. He, with a touch of his old fire, said: [...] "This sure beats a holler log, but all the same I'll be glad to see the time when I can camp on my saddle again." ...|$|R
60|$|I got <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>bed,</b> but I did not {{immediately}} fall off to sleep again. There was no doubt at all that my visitor had come at the instigation of Delora, and that his object had been to prevent my sending that cable, which was already on its way. I got up and saw that my door was securely fastened. I am ashamed to confess that at that moment I felt a tremor of fear! I {{no longer had the}} slightest doubt that Delora, if not an impostor, was engaged in some great criminal operation. And Felicia! I thought of the matter in every way. It was impossible that Delora could be an impostor pure and simple. Felicia was content to travel with him. She knew him for her uncle. He must be her uncle, unless she herself had deceived me! I felt my blood run cold at the thought. I flung it from me. I would have no more of it. Felicia, at least, was above suspicion! Delora had, perhaps, been led into this enterprise, whatever it might be, by Louis and his friends. At any rate, the morrow was likely to clear things up. I was the more convinced of that when I remembered that it was one day's grace only that Delora had begged of me. I went off to sleep again soon, and only woke when my brother's servant called me for my bath. At half-past ten, after a consultation with my brother, I drove to the Brazilian Embassy. I sent in my card, and asked to see Mr. Lamartine. He came to me in a few minutes.|$|E
60|$|In the {{solitude}} of the hour there was an intimation of privity to the event which had taken place, an implication of {{the unity of the}} natural and the supernatural, strangely different from that robust gayety of the plain day which later seemed to disown the affair, and leave the burden of proof altogether to the human witness. By this time Hewson had already set about to putting it in such phrases as should carry conviction to the hearer, and yet should convey to him no suspicion of the pride which Hewson felt in the incident as a sort of tribute to himself. He dramatized the scene at breakfast when he should describe it in plain, matter-of-fact terms, and hold every one spellbound, as he or she leaned forward over the table to listen, while he related the fact with studied unconcern for his own part in it, but with a serious regard for the integrity of the fact itself, which he had no wish to exaggerate as to its immediate meaning or remoter implications. It did not yet occur to him that it had none; they were simply to be matters of future observation in a second ordeal; for the first emotion which the incident imparted was the feeling that it would happen again, and in this return would interpret itself. Hewson was so strongly persuaded of something of the kind, that after standing for an indefinite period at the window in his pajamas, he got hardily <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>bed,</b> and waited for the repetition. He was agreeably aware of waiting without a tremor, and rather eagerly than otherwise; then he began to feel drowsy, and this at first flattered him, as a proof of his strange courage in circumstances which would have rendered sleep impossible to most men; but in another moment he started from it. If he slept every one would say he had dreamt the whole thing; and he could never himself be quite sure that he had not.|$|E
60|$|Latimer {{showed a}} belated {{firmness}} {{on the subject}} of Hartlepool Helen, and Vera withdrew without pressing the point, having first settled the gamecock on his extemporised perch and taken an affectionate farewell of the pigling. Latimer undressed and got into bed with all due speed, judging that the pig would abate its inquisitorial restlessness once the light was turned out. As a substitute for a cosy, straw-bedded sty the room offered, at first inspection, few attractions, but the disconsolate animal suddenly discovered an appliance in which the most luxuriously contrived piggeries were notably deficient. The sharp edge of the underneath part of the bed was pitched at exactly the right elevation to permit the pigling to scrape himself ecstatically backwards and forwards, with an artistic humping of the back at the crucial moment and an accompanying gurgle of long-drawn delight. The gamecock, who may have fancied that he was being rocked in the branches of a pine-tree, bore the motion with greater fortitude than Latimer was able to command. A series of slaps directed at the pig’s body were accepted more as an additional and pleasing irritant than as a criticism of conduct or a hint to desist; evidently something more than a man’s firm hand was needed to deal with the case. Latimer slipped out of bed in search of a weapon of dissuasion. There was sufficient light in the room to enable the pig to detect this manœuvre, and the vile temper, inherited from the drowned mother, found full play. Latimer bounded <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>bed,</b> and his conqueror, after a few threatening snorts and champings of its jaws, resumed its massage operations with renewed zeal. During the long wakeful hours which ensued Latimer tried to distract his mind from his own immediate troubles by dwelling with decent sympathy on the second housemaid’s bereavement, but he found himself more often wondering how many Boy Scouts were sharing his Melton overcoat. The rôle of Saint Martin malgré lui was not one which appealed to him.|$|E
50|$|The creek {{contributes}} {{an average}} of 2,800 acre feet to Elkhorn Slough annually. Because this creek previously contained {{the flow of the}} Pajaro River (whose present day watershed is just to the north) the creek bed is very coarse sand. Carneros Creek ran dry from June until December during the 2000 water year. Because the flow in the creek drops to zero over the summer months, seawater from Elkhorn Slough can flow <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the creek <b>bed</b> during high tides.|$|R
50|$|Jamie {{used his}} power of {{attorney}} while Karen was ill to put The Jockey solely in his name, and at first he is very cold towards her after her return, ignoring her suggestions and {{making it clear that}} the pub was no longer hers, but his and run with Mimi, leaving Karen feeling very left out. She explains to him that she knows she has to earn his trust back, and just wants him to give her a chance. After Jamie is overwhelmed by the chaos of trying to organize Libby's wedding party, he asks Karen to help them, finally acknowledging that he does need her, and does appreciate her. Later, he takes her <b>back</b> <b>into</b> their <b>bed</b> and things begin to return to normal for the couple.|$|R
60|$|Moving <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the <b>bed</b> of the channel, {{they went}} on as fast as possible. They were out of sight, but the winding hollow {{lengthened}} the distance. It got darker as they splashed among the pools; and when at last Andrew thought they had gone far enough and they climbed the bank, everything was hidden by drifting fog. Whitney was frankly uneasy. Andrew knew the sands well, but, for all that, {{it would not be}} difficult to lose their way, and they had purposely left no light on board the yacht. Still, it was unthinkable that they should turn back when the man they had been trying to mark down seemed almost in their hands. Banishing his misgivings, he plunged into the clammy mist, following closely behind Andrew.|$|R
