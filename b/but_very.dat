5|$|Copper(I) chloride, {{commonly}} called cuprous chloride, is the lower chloride of copper, with the formula CuCl.

5|$|The famous Hooverville arose {{during the}} Depression, leading to Seattle’s growing {{homeless}} population.

5|$|A surviving, <b>but</b> <b>very</b> {{deteriorated}} 35mm nitrate {{print of}} the film was known to exist in 1988. It was described as being {{in various states of}} decomposition throughout the entire reel, including severe shrinkage and brittle or torn perforations. This print is 925 feet long and was held by John E. Allen, Inc. though it is not specifically known if it transferred to the Library of Congress in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Active and cheerful, the Russian Toy was {{originally}} bred {{both as an}} anti-rat dog and a watch dog. The second quality is still active in the breed, {{and they can be}} very vocal.

Russian Toys are usually very reserved with strangers, <b>but</b> <b>very</b> loyal to their owners, always ready to protect them from any perceived danger.|$|E

5|$|Another survivor, Radomir Krnjajić, {{recalled}} {{that they were}} fed a variety of foods, including pumpkin soup, cucumbers, beets and similar vegetables, and sometimes received a little macaroni or beans, <b>but</b> <b>very</b> little bread. The historian Ivan Fumić concludes that the children were systematically punished for various infractions, and were treated harshly by the Ustaše {{and the majority of}} the nuns. Some of the nuns at the camp, however, did show love and attention to the children. Gojko Knežević, another camp survivor, recounted many years later that the nuns beat the children with birch branches dipped in salt water or vinegar.|$|E
5|$|Bogbean and Water Lobelia {{are common}} plants of moorland pools and lochans. The Least (Nuphar pumila), Yellow and White Water-lilies are also widespread. Pipewort has {{generated}} some botanical controversy regarding its discovery, classification and distribution. It was found growing on Skye in the 18th century, {{although there was}} subsequent confusion as to both the discoverer and the correct scientific name – now agreed to be Eriocaulon aquaticum. The European range of this plant is confined to Scotland and western Ireland {{and it is one}} of {{only a small number of}} species which is common in North America, <b>but</b> <b>very</b> restricted in Europe.|$|E
5|$|British Rail {{was split}} into business-led sectors in the 1980s, {{at which time}} {{operations}} at Stapleton Road passed to Regional Railways. All trains along the Severn Beach Line ran to Severn Beach, but the service pattern was irregular. This was changed in the mid-1990s, with a more frequent service to Avonmouth <b>but</b> <b>very</b> few on to Severn Beach and no Sunday services. Services at Stapleton Road were boosted due to the proximity of Eastville Stadium, but this use ended in 1986 when Bristol Rovers F.C. moved to Twerton Park in Bath.|$|E

The course requirements changed that year; Cabaniss received poor marks in seamanship, tactics, naval tactics, astronomy, and French language, <b>but</b> <b>very</b> high marks in mathematics, electricity, and English composition courses. He maintained his good conduct, earning the second-fewest demerits of any cadet. This earned him an appointment as a Cadet Ensign, a temporary position as an academy officer.|$|E
5|$|Compared to the {{nominate}} form, A. p. kleinschmidti has slightly yellower, less olive, upperparts {{and brighter}} and yellower underparts between the breast streaking. A. p. littoralis may show pinkish underparts and a pale supercilium (eyebrow) in summer, thereby resembling the water pipit. Vagrant Eurasian rock pipits in winter are readily distinguishable from water pipits, <b>but</b> <b>very</b> difficult to assign to subspecies by appearance or measurements. The western populations {{are known to}} be nearly sedentary, so east of the Elbe basin vagrant Eurasian rock pipits are presumably mostly littoralis.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{the game}} officially began in January 2013. Ubisoft Montreal, the {{developer}} of Patriots, handled the game's development, with Ubisoft's offices in Barcelona, Toronto, Kiev, Shanghai and Chengdu providing assistance. The game was originally called Rainbow Six Unbreakable, a title that reflected not only the game's destruction mechanic but also the mindset of the development team, who had to deliver a game that was once stuck in development hell. According to Alexandre Remy, the brand director, the team was confident in their new vision for the game <b>but</b> <b>very</b> nervous when they revealed it, realizing the change of direction would likely disappoint some fans.|$|E

5|$|For {{persistent}} {{low back}} pain, the short-term outcome is also positive, with {{improvement in the}} first six weeks <b>but</b> <b>very</b> little improvement after that. At one year, those with chronic low back pain usually continue to have moderate pain and disability. People at higher risk of long-term disability include those with poor coping skills or with fear of activity (2.5 {{times more likely to have}} poor outcomes at one year), those with a poor ability to cope with pain, functional impairments, poor general health, or a significant psychiatric or psychological component to the pain (Waddell's signs).|$|E
5|$|Gonopods {{occur in}} a {{diversity}} of shapes and sizes, and {{in the range from}} closely resembling walking legs to complex structures quite unlike legs at all. In some groups, the gonopods are kept retracted within the body; in others they project forward parallel to the body. Gonopod morphology is the predominant means of determining species among millipedes: the structures may differ greatly between closely related species <b>but</b> <b>very</b> little within a species. The gonopods develop gradually from walking legs through successive moults until reproductive maturity.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, Parker {{played the}} male lead in Rome & Jewel, a hip-hop take on Romeo and Juliet that got mothballed and re-released in 2008. Parker's title character, who is {{supposed}} to be the modern day Romeo, was a Compton youth with both tenderness and toughness. Despite a troubled script, Parker's rap performance earned comparisons to Will Smith from Nathan Lee of The New York Times. In 2007, he had a small role in Pride, about an African American swim team. Parker was tasked with depicting the visual expectations of an athletic proficiency that was new to him <b>but</b> <b>very</b> familiar to the audience.|$|E
5|$|In north Somerset, mining in the Somerset {{coalfield}} was {{an important}} industry, and {{in an effort to}} reduce the cost of transporting the coal the Somerset Coal Canal was built; part of it was later converted into a railway. Other canals included the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal, Westport Canal, Grand Western Canal, Glastonbury Canal and Chard Canal. The Dorset and Somerset Canal was proposed, <b>but</b> <b>very</b> little of it was ever constructed.|$|E
