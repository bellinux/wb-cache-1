5|$|Erosion-resistant basalt {{underlies}} much of the watershed, {{and streams}} passing over it are relatively free of sediments. However, turbidity increases when unstable soils sandwiched between layers of basalt and other volcanic rocks are disturbed and wash into the river during rainstorms. Despite legal protections, about 22percent of the protected zone was logged {{during the second half}} of the 20thcentury, and erosion increased. For a time in 1996, Portland had to shut down the Bull Run supply because of turbidity and switch to water from wells. A law passed later that year prohibited most logging in or near the watershed, and since then the Portland Water <b>Bureau</b> <b>and</b> the United States Forest Service have closed many of the logging roads and removed culverts and other infrastructure contributing to erosion.|$|E

All but one member of the Ukrainian Politburo Organizational <b>Bureau</b> <b>and</b> Secretariat were arrested. Almost all government officials and Red Army commanders were replaced.
