30|$|We {{investigated}} whether chronic {{intravenous administration}} of l-carnitine could improve myocardial fatty acid imaging in patients on maintenance hemodialysis. We enrolled 72 hemodialysis {{patients who had}} impaired myocardial fatty acid imaging and left ventricular dysfunction not based on coronary lesion. l-Carnitine (1, 000  mg) was intravenously administered after dialysis for 1  year to 36 participants (Carnitine group), while not in the other 36 participants (Control group). Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using an iodinated fatty acid analogue, BMIPP, was performed. Uptake on SPECT images was graded in 17 segments on a five-point scale (0, normal; 4, absent) and assessed as BMIPP summed scores. During follow-up, 19 participants were discontinued from the study, and 53 participants (65  ±  12  years: 27 carnitine, 26 control) were analyzed. The mean BMIPP summed scores 1  year after carnitine administration {{did not differ from}} that before in the carnitine group, nor from that in the control group. However, improved SPECT (Changes in BMIPP summed scores <− 20 %) was found in 7 (25.9 %) participants in the carnitine, whereas in 2 (7.7 %) in the control group. Multivariate logistic analysis showed the improved SPECT was inversely associated with <b>baseline</b> <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> (1  g/L: odds ratio, 0.669); the cut-off was 35  g/L. Chronic intravenous l-carnitine might improve myocardial fatty acid imaging in a selected group of hemodialysis patients with hypoalbuminemia.|$|E
40|$|There is {{a general}} {{perception}} that patients with polycystic kidney disease on peritoneal dialysis have poor long-term technique survival. In order to test this opinion, we performed a retrospective analysis comparing results of 56 consecutive patients with polycystic kidney disease to 56 non-diabetic patients with bilateral small kidneys. The patient groups were all initiated on peritoneal dialysis over a 12 year period and matched for age, gender and years of end stage renal failure. After a mean follow-up period of 37 months {{the two groups were}} statistically indistinguishable in terms of mortality, kidney transplantation-censored technique survival, median death-censored technique survival, the number of patients switched permanently to hemodialysis due to technique failure and the rate of peritonitis. On Cox regression (multivariate) analysis, only the <b>baseline</b> <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> was a significant and independent risk factor of death-censored technique failure.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND & AIMS: We {{investigated}} {{the effectiveness of}} the protease inhibitors peginterferon and ribavirin in treatment-experienced patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 infection and cirrhosis. METHODS: In the Compassionate Use of Protease Inhibitors in Viral C Cirrhosis study, 511 patients with HCV genotype 1 infection and compensated cirrhosis who did not respond to a prior course of peginterferon and ribavirin (44. 3 % relapsers or patients with viral breakthrough, 44. 8 % partial responders, and 8. 0 % null responders) were given either telaprevir (n = 299) or boceprevir (n = 212) for 48 weeks. We assessed percentages of patients with sustained viral responses 12 weeks after therapy and safety. This observational study did not allow for direct comparison of the 2 regimens. RESULTS: Among patients given telaprevir, 74. 2 % of relapsers, 40. 0 % of partial responders, and 19. 4 % of null responders achieved SVR 12. Among those given boceprevir, 53. 9 % of relapsers, 38. 3 % of partial responders, and none of the null responders achieved SVR 12. In multivariate analysis, factors associated with SVR 12 included prior response to treatment response, no lead-in phase, HCV subtype 1 b (vs 1 a), and baseline platelet count greater than 100, 000 /mm(3). Severe adverse events occurred in 49. 9 % of cases, including liver decompensation, severe infections in 10. 4 %, and death in 2. 2 %. In multivariate analysis, <b>baseline</b> <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> less than 35 g/L and baseline platelet counts of 100, 000 /mm(3) or less predicted severe side effects or death. CONCLUSIONS: Relatively high percentages of real-life, treatment-experienced patients with HCV genotype 1 infection and cirrhosis respond to the combination of peginterferon and ribavirin with telaprevir or boceprevir. However, side effects are frequent and often severe. Baseline <b>levels</b> of <b>albumin</b> and platelet counts can be used to guide treatment decisions.

We investigated clinical features and related factors of de novo hypokalemia in incident PD patients. We retrospectively enrolled 82 normokalemic patients starting PD at Gachon University Gil Hospital, Korea. The patients were divided into hypokalemia (K + < 3. 5 mEq/L) and normokalemia (3. 5 mEq/L ≤ K + < 5. 5 mEq/L) groups based on the plasma potassium levels at month 13, and then clinical parameters including peritoneal function and adequacy tests and biochemical parameters were compared. Eight patients who showed hyperkalemia (K + ≥ 5. 5 mEq/L) at month 13 were excluded from our analyses. The incidence of hypokalemia in PD patients was 7. 3 % in a year. The de novo hypokalemia (n= 6) and normokalemia (n= 68) groups had {{no significant differences in}} <b>baseline</b> characteristics.

40|$|End-stage {{renal disease}} (ESRD) {{associated}} with pre-existing advanced liver disease (ALD) {{has increased the}} risk of morbidity and mortality. The {{aim of this study}} is to assess the outcome following the use of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) in ESRD patients with ALD. A retrospective case-controlled study was performed on 16 patients with ALD and ESRD (ESRD-ALD) and 27 control patients with ESRD but without liver disease (ESRD); both groups were started on CAPD during the same period. No major complications were observed in either group in the immediate post-surgical period and, after an average break in period of 11. 3 days, the cases and controls were started on regular CAPD. The average duration of follow-up was 8 ± 2. 3 months in the ESRD-ALD group compared with 20 ± 1. 3 months in the ESRD group. The overall peritonitis rates were 1. 26 /treatment year in the ESRD-ALD group and 0. 63 in the ESRD group. The 6 - and 12 -month survivals among ESRD-ALD patients were 63. 75 % and 38. 75 %, respectively. Patients with ESRD-ALD had significantly lower <b>baseline</b> <b>serum</b> protein and <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> at the time of initiation of CAPD. On follow-up, the hemoglobin levels improved in both the groups along with an improvement in the <b>serum</b> protein and <b>albumin</b> <b>levels.</b> Fourteen of the 16 ESRD-ALD patients died at the end of the 3 -year follow-up period; deaths were due to terminal liver failure in nine patients and peritonitis in five patients. Patients who died in the ESRD-ALD group had lower <b>serum</b> <b>albumin,</b> lower body mass index (BMI) (median BMI 18. 2 vs. 25. 6) and higher grades of liver disease [child Pugh grade B (8), grade C (6) vs. grade B (2) ] at initiation of CAPD. Our study suggests that CAPD is a safe modality in patients with ESRD-ALD and that it does not carry any major risk for bleeding tendencies, technique failure or worsening of nutritional status.

We cross-sectionally investigated in the representative Japanese the association between dietary protein intake and <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels.</b> Methods: A total of 7715 subjects (3220 men and 4495 women, aged 30 years or more) with measurement of <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> who participated in both the National Survey on Circulatory Disorders in 1990 and the National Nutrition Survey in 1990 were analyzed in the present analysis. Multiple-adjustments were performed with linear regression models to estimate the association between <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> and animal or vegetable protein intake adjusting for age and body mass index. Results: The very weak positive association between animal protein and <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> was observed.

The hypothesis is that improved <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> may be beneficial to the SIR parameters and will reduce chemotherapy-induced toxicity. Patients and Methods: Forty-nine stage III b or stage IV inoperable NSCLC patients were divided into two groups, depending on whether albumin administration was given before chemotherapy. The Karnofsky performance score (KPS), nutritional status including body mass index (BMI), and <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> were evaluated. SIR was evaluated by investigating the changes of the C-reactive protein (CRP), calculating the neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and the platelet lymphocyte ratio (PLR), before and after chemotherapy.

Correlations between the pre- and post-operative <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> and various clinical demographics and recurrence-free survival rates were analyzed. Results: Patients with pre-operative hypoalbuminemia (< 3. 5 g/dl) had a significantly worse survival rate than patients with normal pre-operative <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> (&# 8805; 3. 5 g/dl) (p= 0. 008).

However, the distribution and correlates of <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> among individuals with motor disorders have not been reported until now. Therefore, we examined the distribution and correlates of <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> among individuals with motor disorders. [SUBJECTS/METHODS]A cross-sectional study on 249 individuals with motor disabilities (144 men, mean age: 51. 4 years; 105 women, mean age: 51. 4 years) was conducted at five institutions in Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan in 2008. The results were compared with data from the National Health and Nutrition Survey. [RESULTS]The mean <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> were 4. 0 ± 0. 4 g/dL for men and 3. 8 ± 0. 5 g/dL for women. Overall, 17 (11. 8 %) men and 25 (23. 8 %) women had hypoalbuminemia (<b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> ≤ 3. 5 g/dL); these proportions were greater than those among healthy Japanese adults (≤ 1 %).

The collected data included age, body weight, height, <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels,</b> and routine blood biochemistry examination results. These data were compared with data from a healthy control group (N= 32) drawn from the staff of the psychiatric ward. Statistical analysis was done using covariance after age adjustment. Results: The mean <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> were 40. 2 ¡ 4. 0 g/L in patients with mania (N= 25), 39. 8 ¡ 2. 8 g/L in patients with major depression (N= 36), and 45. 8 ¡ 2. 0 g/L in the control group. Patients with mania (F= 64. 6, p = 0. 000) and major depression (F= 68. 9, p = 0. 000), respectively, had significantly lower <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> than the control group after age adjustment. However, for the patients with major depression, no significant difference in <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> were found between patients who had attempted suicide and those who had not. Conclusion: Lower <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> were noted during the acute phases of mania and major depression in Taiwanese psychiatric inpatients...|$|R

We tested the hypothesis that economic status is associated with <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> and explained by nutritional and health status in Japanese older adults. We performed a cross-sectional analysis {{using data from the}} Japan Gerontological Evaluation study (JAGES). The study participants were 6528 functionally independent residents (3189 men and 3339 women) aged ≥ 65 years living in four municipalities in Aichi prefecture. We used household income as an indicator of economic status. Multiple linear regression was used to compare <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> in relation to household income, which was classified as low, middle, and high. Additionally, mediation by nutritional and health-related factors was analyzed in multivariable models. With the middle-income group as reference, participants with low incomes had a significantly lower <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>level,</b> even after adjustment for sex, age, residential area, education, marital status, and household structure. The estimated mean difference was - 0. 17 g/L (95 % confidence interval, - 0. 33 to - 0. 01 g/L). The relation between <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> and low income became statistically insignificant when "body mass index", "consumption of meat or fish", "self-rated health", "presence of medical conditions", "hyperlipidemia", or "respiratory disease "was included in the model. <b>Serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> were lower in Japanese older adults with low economic status.

40|$|BACKGROUND : Acute {{myocardial}} infarction (AMI) {{is one of}} the major causes of mortality and morbidity in the world. <b>Serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> are inversely related with age, smoking, blood pressure and obesity. It is not clear whether low <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> is a nonspecific, prognostic variable, a marker of subclinical disease, or whether it is a part of causal mechanism leading to death due to cardiovascular disease. Some studies have reported an inverse association between <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> and cardiovascular mortality but oth ers have not. 1 The association between <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> and cardiovascular mortality remains controversial. This study was done to evaluate the <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> in patients with ST segment elevation Myocardial infarction (STEMI) over a period of three days from the date of admission and whether the changes had any relationship with the prognosis of the patient. AIM: to associate changes in <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> in AMI patients over a period of three days i. e., day zero - at the time of admission, day+ 1 - the following day(12 to 30 hrs after collecting first sample), day + 2 (32 to 54 hrs after collecting first sample) with the clinical prognosis of the patient.

40|$|Introduction. To date, only {{few studies}} {{focusing}} {{on the issue of}} host general and immune activity have been performed in localized prostate cancer (PCa). The aim {{of this study was to}} elucidate potent non tumor–related biomarkers that express aggressiveness of PCa treated by radical prostatectomy (RP). Materials and methods. Data from 179 patients who underwent RP were analyzed. The correlations between various kinds of non tumor–related factors in addition to tumor–related factors and biochemical recurrence (BCR) were analyzed. The correlations between pre–, intra– and post–operative factors were also analyzed. Results. Thirty–two cases (17. 9 %) had a BCR. The factors found to be significantly predictive of BCR using a Cox–proportional hazard model were the pre–operative serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) level and the existence of pathological lymph node metastasis (LNM). A low pre–operative <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> (< 4. 0 g/dl) was significantly correlated with BCR univariately. Logistic regression analysis revealed that a low pre–operative <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>level,</b> an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score above class 2, and a Gleason score above 8 in the biopsy specimens were significantly predictive of pathological LNM. Conclusions. Tumor–related characteristics are more important for predicting BCR. However, our results suggest that low pre–operative <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> may indicate extensive disease of clinically localized PCa and may ultimately be correlated with BCR. Although multiple reasons may account for the significance of the <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>level,</b> it is noteworthy that delayed diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in comorbid patients with low <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> may lead to PCa progression...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background There {{are several}} methods of {{assessing}} nutritional status in cancer of which <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> {{is one of}} the most commonly used. In recent years, the role of malnutrition as a predictor of survival in cancer has received considerable attention. As a result, it is reasonable to investigate whether <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> has utility as a prognostic indicator of cancer survival in cancer. This review summarizes all available epidemiological literature on the association between pretreatment <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> and survival in different types of cancer. Methods A systematic search of the literature using the MEDLINE database (January 1995 through June 2010) to identify epidemiologic studies on the relationship between <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> and cancer survival. To be included in the review, a study must have: been published in English, reported on data collected in humans with any type of cancer, had <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> as one of the or only predicting factor, had survival as one of the outcome measures (primary or secondary) and had any of the following study designs (case-control, cohort, cross-sectional, case-series prospective, retrospective, nested case-control, ecologic, clinical trial, meta-analysis). Results Of the 29 studies reviewed on cancers of the gastrointestinal tract, all except three found higher <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> to be associated with better survival in multivariate analysis. Of the 10 studies reviewed on lung cancer, all excepting one found higher <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> to be associated with better survival. In 6 studies reviewed on female cancers and multiple cancers each, lower <b>levels</b> of <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> were associated with poor survival. Finally, in all 8 studies reviewed on patients with other cancer sites, lower <b>levels</b> of <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> were associated with poor survival. Conclusions Pretreatment <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> provide useful prognostic significance in cancer. Accordingly, <b>serum</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>level</b> could be used in clinical trials to better define the baseline risk in cancer patients. A critical gap for demonstrating causality, however, is the absence of clinical trials demonstrating that raising <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> by means of intravenous infusion or by hyperalimentation decreases the excess risk of mortality in cancer. </p...|$|R
