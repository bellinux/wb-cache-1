25|$|A {{total of}} 143 species of fish, amphibians, birds and {{reptiles}} {{have been seen}} in the park and the number is expected to go up to 200 once the project is completed. More than 85 different kinds of birds, including rare black bittern, cinnamon bittern, <b>black-winged</b> <b>kite,</b> white-bellied sea eagle, pied kingfisher, yellow wagtails, egret, chestnut-winged cuckoo, and black-winged stilt have been spotted by ornithologists in the green expanse. After the northeast monsoon of 2011, painted storks have been spotted in the park after several years. Butterflies, including the rare painted lady and black rajah and blue-tailed green darner dragon fly, have been among those spotted here. Crows, mynahs, blue rock pigeons and water paddybirds walk on the sand near the waterbodies. Non-poisonous snakes, soft and hard shell turtles, painted frogs and green pond frogs can also be seen in the park. The restoration has also improved the quality of water, which according to Central Pollution Control Board norms, is suitable for propagation of wildlife.|$|E

500|$|Along with Ohiya, Pattipola and Ambewela, Horton Plains forms {{one of the}} Important Bird Areas (IBAs) in Sri Lanka. Together {{with the}} {{adjacent}} Peak Wilderness Sanctuary, Horton Plains contains 21 bird species which occur only on Sri Lanka.

Many birds migrate here in winter including swiftlets, and alpine swift. Crested serpent eagle, mountain hawk-eagle, <b>black-winged</b> <b>kite,</b> and peregrine falcon are among the birds of prey found in Horton Plains. Harriers are among the migratory raptors. This is a key wildlife area. All six highland endemic birds are found here, including dull-blue flycatcher, Sri Lanka white-eye, Sri Lanka wood pigeon, and Sri Lanka bush warbler. Yellow-eared bulbul and black-throated munia are widespread throughout the highlands.|$|E
500|$|Like other elanid kites, black-shouldered kites hunt by {{quartering}} grasslands {{for small}} creatures. This can {{be from a}} perch, but more often by hovering in mid-air. When hunting the kite hovers with its body hanging almost vertically, and its head into the wind. Unlike the Australian kestrel, the <b>black-winged</b> <b>kite</b> shows no obvious sideways movement, even in a strong breeze. One study of a nesting pair noted that the male searched aerially for 82% of the search time. Typically, a kite will hover [...] above a particular spot, peering down intently, sometimes {{for only a few}} seconds, often for a minute or more, then glide swiftly to a new vantage point and hover again. When hunting from a perch, a dead tree is the preferred platform. Like other Elanus kites, The black-shouldered kite grips a vertical branch with a foot on either side, each one above the other and turned inwards, which enables them to maintain a secure footing on relatively small branches. Though hovering is the most common hunting method, the kites have been observed searching the ground beneath a vantage point for periods of up to an hour.|$|E

50|$|In Elanus, he grouped the <b>black-winged</b> <b>kite</b> (now several Elanus spp.), scissor-tailed kite (now Chelictinia), and {{swallow-tailed kite}} (now Elanoides).

50|$|For {{some recent}} decades, it was lumped with the <b>black-winged</b> <b>kite</b> of Europe and Africa as Elanus caeruleus and was collectively called black-shouldered kite.

This argument was accepted by the American Ornithologists' Union, so the white-tailed kite was returned to its original name. Meanwhile, the Old World E. caeruleus is once again called <b>black-winged</b> <b>kite,</b> while the name black-shouldered kite is now reserved for an Australian species, Elanus axillaris, which had also been lumped into E. caeruleus but is now regarded as separate again.|$|E

This Eurasian and African species was sometimes combined with the Australian black-shouldered kite (Elanus axillaris) and the white-tailed kite (Elanus leucurus) of North and South America which together form a superspecies. This kite is distinctive, with long-wings, white, grey and black plumage and owl like forward-facing eyes with red irises. Although mainly seen on the plains, they are sometimes seen on grassy slopes of hills in the higher elevation regions of Asia. They are not migratory, but make short-distance movements in response to weather.|$|E

50|$|The <b>black-winged</b> <b>kite</b> breeds at {{different}} times of the year across its range. Although nesting has been noted throughout the year in India, they appear not to breed in April and May. Courtship is noisy and involves chases and once the pair is formed they copulate frequently. The nest is a loose platform of twigs in which 3 or 4 eggs are laid. The female spends more effort {{in the construction of the}} nest than the male. The eggs are pale creamy with spots of deep red. Both parents incubate but when the chicks hatch, the male spends more time on foraging for food. Females initially feed the young, sometimes hunting close to the nest but will also receive food from the male. After fledging the young birds continue to be dependent for food on the male parent for about 80 days, initially transferring food at perch and later in the air.|$|E

40|$|The use {{of social}} media in Indonesia is {{changing}} traditional trading methods in the country, and this {{extends to the}} sale of protected wildlife such as raptors. Between January and December 2015 the authors monitored 38 Facebook groups and recorded 2, 471 individuals from 21 diurnal raptor species being offered for sale. Most were juveniles, and the <b>Black-winged</b> <b>Kite</b> Elanus caeruleus was the most frequently offered species. The peak of raptor trading was in July and August, coincident with the breeding season of most raptors as many birds are taken as nestlings. Regular scrutiny of social media sites and increased punitive action by law enforcement agencies, and public awareness campaigns by governments and NGOs, are desperately needed to eliminate this audacious market for illegal trade...|$|E
40|$|Raptors show high {{copulation}} rates {{when compared}} to other birds. This fact has been generally attributed to sperm competition. However, copulation rates in raptors tend to be seasonally bimodal, with an early peak outside the female’s fertile period that cannot be explained by the sperm competition hypothesis. We studied the copulation behavior of the <b>Black-winged</b> <b>Kite</b> (Elonus reeru lens), that, unlike raptors previously studied, may raise two broods consecutively in the same breeding season. [he first recorded copulation occurred 44 d prior to the onset of laying and the last one on d 66 after. We observed three seasonal peaks in copulation frequency. The first two peaks (40 and 10 d before egg laying, on average) correspond to the normal pattern in raptors. To explain the first peak, we propose three hypotheses: (1) pair bonding, (2) mate assessment, and (3) territorial sig­ naling. Unfortunately, we have been unable to elaborate further predictions that would distinguish among these three hypotheses. The second peak, during the fertile period, may be attributed to sperm cosnpetition. The third peak, previously unreported in raptors, occurred 50 d after the onset of laying, the mean time lag between first and second clutches in the area. These late copulations, which were also performed by pairs that laid one clutch, may reflect the propensity of the species to lay second clutches (we recorded six replacement clutches and five second clutches out of 98 breeding attempts). This third peak of copulations may also have a fertilization function and may be related to sperm competitionLas ayes rapaces suelen presentar altas tasas copulatorias cuando se las compara con otras ayes. Este hecho ha sido generalmente atrihuido a la competencia espermhtica. Sin embargo, la tasa de cópulas en ayes rapaces tiende a presentar un patron estacional bimodal, con un primer pico antes del periodo en que la hembra es fbrtil, que no puede ser explicado por esta hipOtesis. En este trabajo estudiamos el comportamiento copulatorio del elanio comdn (Elanus caeruleus), que a diferencia de las otras rapaces previamente estudiadas puede sacar adelante dos polladas consecutivas en la misma tem­ porada de cria. La primera cópula se observO 44 dias antes del inicio de la puesta y la Oltima 66 dias después. Observamos tres picos en Ia frecuencia copulatoria a lo largo de la temporada de cria. Los prisneros dos (alrededor de los dias 40 y 10 antes de la puesta) corresponden al patron observado en otras rapaces. Para explicar el primer pico proponemos que se consideren tres hipOtesis: (1) reforza­ miento de los lazos de pareja, (2) valoración de la calidad del compañero y (3) seflalizaciOn del tern­ torio.
