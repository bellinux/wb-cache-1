25|$|A chain <b>boat,</b> <b>chain</b> tug or chain-ship was a type {{of river}} craft, used {{in the second half}} of the 19th century and first half of the 20th century on many European rivers, that made use of a steel chain laid along the {{riverbed}} for its propulsion.|$|E

60|$|He rushed {{around the}} corner of the {{boathouse}} and there beheld a scene that aroused his warmest indignation. Harry Moss was crowded into a corner and over him stood Lew Flapp, beating him with a heavy <b>boat</b> <b>chain.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} {{generation}} of <b>chain</b> <b>boats</b> the <b>chain</b> ran over chain drums {{at the side of the}} boat. In fast-flowing currents or when there were problems lifting the chain due to silting or obstacles on the riverbed such as large rocks, the boat could swing off-course markedly and list to one side. As a result, on later <b>chain</b> <b>boats,</b> the <b>chain</b> drive was always located in the middle of the boat.|$|R
50|$|After {{obtaining a}} {{concession}} to provide <b>chain</b> <b>boat</b> services in 1869, the Danube Steamship Company laid a chain between Vienna and Preßburg (the former name for Bratislava). However, in 1871, some sections of the river were already banning chain shipping. In 1881, <b>chain</b> <b>boats</b> were plying the Danube from Spitz to Linz. There were ten chain ships in use. The chain increasingly broke (on average once per trip) which was {{the reason why the}} <b>chain</b> <b>boats</b> were converted in 1890 into tugboats. In 1891, <b>chain</b> <b>boat</b> services were established between Regensburg and Hofkirchen (113 km). In 1896, <b>chain</b> <b>boat</b> services between Vienna and Ybbs ceased and, in 1906, services between Regensburg and Hofkirchen were also terminated.|$|R
50|$|In 1892 <b>chain</b> <b>boats</b> using Zeuner water {{turbines}} {{were introduced}} on the Elbe. They were a precursor of the present-day hydrojet propulsion systems. In addition to faster downstream travel times, the auxiliary engine also enabled steering corrections during chain operations and simplified turning manoeuvres. Water turbines were used on several <b>chain</b> <b>boats</b> on the Elbe {{and on the}} Bavarian <b>chain</b> <b>boats</b> on the Main.|$|R

Your former conduct was mean enough, and this appears to be on a level with it. With such a heavy <b>boat</b> <b>chain</b> you might have injured Moss very seriously. Do you want me to give you another chance or not?" ...|$|E
50|$|A chain <b>boat,</b> <b>chain</b> tug or chain-ship was a type {{of river}} craft, used {{in the second half}} of the 19th century and first half of the 20th century on many European rivers, that made use of a steel chain laid along the {{riverbed}} for its propulsion. The chain was hauled by a steam engine mounted on board and enabled the boat to tow a string of barges. In Germany, such a boat was variously referred to as a Kettenschleppschiff, Kettenschlepper, Kettendampfer or Kettenschiff and in France as a toueur.|$|E
50|$|The <b>chain</b> <b>boats</b> also {{provided}} river transportation on the canals in France, {{as well as}} on the rivers. Tunnels on the highest level of these canals were very long and electrically driven <b>chain</b> <b>boats</b> were used to tow boats through them. Due to the lack of ventilation in the tunnel systems, electrically operated <b>chain</b> <b>boats</b> continued to be used even after the introduction of self-propelled motor vessels.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} days of the <b>chain</b> <b>boat,</b> paddle steamers were slower at making their way {{upstream}} that <b>chain</b> <b>boats.</b> When heading downstream, however, they were faster and could also haul barges with them.|$|R
50|$|<b>Chain</b> <b>boats</b> {{were also}} used on the River Main in the period from 1886 to 1936. The chain was laid in the 396 km navigable section of the river between Mainz and Bamberg. Up to 8 <b>chain</b> <b>boats</b> were in service on the Main. The chain was {{recovered}} from the Main in 1938 and re-used. The <b>chain</b> <b>boats</b> on the Main were also colloquially called the Maakuh or Määkuh ("Main Cow").|$|R
50|$|<b>Chain</b> <b>boats</b> {{revolutionized}} {{inland waterway}} transport, especially on rivers with strong currents. Compared with the hitherto standard towing method, a <b>chain</b> <b>boat</b> could haul many more and much larger barges. The possible load {{of a single}} barge rose five times {{in just a few}} years. In addition, the <b>chain</b> <b>boat</b> transport was much faster and cheaper. The number of trips a boat could make increased, for example, on the Elbe almost three times.|$|R
50|$|From {{the time}} of those early {{attempts}} {{in the first half}} of the 19th century, <b>chain</b> <b>boat</b> technology improved steadily and the first successful use of <b>chain</b> <b>boats</b> in France took place. After that, other French rivers and canals were also provided with chains. In Germany, chains were laid in the Elbe, Neckar, Main, Spree, Havel, Warthe and Danube. In Russia too, <b>chain</b> <b>boat</b> navigation became widespread. In all, about 3,300 km of chain were laid in Europe.|$|R
50|$|With the {{development}} and growth {{in the use of}} new forms of power, such as the screw propellor and diesel engine {{in the first half of}} the 20th century, self-propelled vessels increasingly superseded the <b>chain</b> <b>boat.</b> The development of river systems and competition from road and rail further reduced the profitability of the <b>chain</b> <b>boat</b> industry that was designed for continuous towing. In time, the use of <b>chain</b> <b>boats</b> became restricted to a few particularly difficult sections of river.|$|R
50|$|By 1878, {{the first}} <b>chain</b> <b>boat</b> had also entered {{service on the}} River Neckar between Mannheim and Heilbronn, hauling nine barges. The {{operation}} of <b>chains</b> <b>boats</b> was managed by the Chain Ship Company of the Neckar (Kettenschifffahrt auf dem Neckar AG). However, the regulation {{of the flow of}} the river by locks in the 1930s, which enabled it to be upgraded into a major waterway, spelt the end of the hitherto still profitable Neckar <b>chain</b> <b>boats</b> and their replacement by large barges.|$|R
50|$|Chain girth is {{specified}} in some design rules to handicap or match {{the capabilities of}} sailing vessels of similar design such as the 12 metre <b>boats.</b> <b>Chain</b> girth is measured as {{a straight line from}} a given elevation on the hull near the waterline vertically from a specified fore-and-aft position and diagonally as viewed from the bow to a point on the hull near the keel. It differs from the skin girth which is measured following the surface of the hull.|$|R
50|$|On the Saale, <b>chain</b> <b>boats</b> {{were taken}} into service in 1873, running from its river mouth to the Calbe, and by 1903 {{services}} had been extended to Halle, a total of 105 km. The last <b>chain</b> <b>boat</b> on the Saale was still working in 1921.|$|R
50|$|If two <b>chain</b> <b>boats</b> met, {{a complex}} {{manoeuvre}} was necessary {{in which one}} <b>boat</b> passed the <b>chain,</b> using an auxiliary chain, to the other boat. This procedure meant a delay of at least 20 minutes for the boat travelling upstream, while the ship heading downstream suffered a delay of about 45 minutes {{as a result of}} the manoeuvre. The introduction of auxiliary engines enabled <b>chain</b> <b>boats</b> to travel downstream under their own power without using the chain, thus avoiding the need for these time-consuming operations.|$|R
50|$|In 1866, in Belgium chain steamers plied the Canal de Willebroek between Brussels and the canal's {{confluence}} {{with the}} Rupel. Unlike <b>chain</b> <b>boats</b> in France and Germany, <b>chain</b> <b>boats</b> in Belgium used the von Bouquié system, whereby the chain was not led down the centre {{line of the}} ship, but simply over a chain wheel {{at the side of}} the ship. The chain wheel was fitted with teeth to prevent the chain slipping. Every day about five <b>chain</b> <b>boats</b> operated hauled in each direction, each hauling a chain of 6 to 12 barges.|$|R

In order to ensure the necessary traction on the chain on the driving drums, the chain was wound several times around two traction drums placed one behind {{the other in the}} centre of the <b>boat.</b> The <b>chain</b> ran in four to five grooves and was alternately wound over the front and rear drums.|$|R

5000|$|Chain-boat {{navigation}} [...] or chain-ship navigation is {{a little-known}} {{chapter in the}} history of shipping on European rivers. From around the middle of the 19th century, vessels called <b>chain</b> <b>boats</b> were used to haul strings of barges upstream by using a fixed chain lying on the bed of a river. The chain was raised from the riverbed to pass over the deck of the steamer, being hauled by a heavy winch powered by a steam engine. A variety of companies operated <b>chain</b> <b>boat</b> services on rivers such as the Elbe, Rhine, Neckar, Main, Saale, Havel, Spree and Saône as well as other rivers in Belgium and the Netherlands. <b>Chain</b> <b>boats</b> were also used in the United States.|$|R
5000|$|In <b>chain</b> <b>boat</b> {{navigation}} the <b>chain</b> {{was simply}} laid [...] "loose" [...] on the riverbed for long distances {{of up to}} several hundred kilometres. Only the deadweight of the massive chain, which weighed about [...] or , and its natural snagging on the sand and stones of the riverbed provided resistance, so that the <b>chain</b> <b>boat</b> and its attached barges could haul themselves along the chain. The water bore {{the weight of the}} boats and barges, whilst the chain only had to cope with the power of the engine. The chain was only anchored at its two ends so that boats could continue to haul themselves {{to the end of the}} chain route.|$|R
50|$|On the River Havel, too, {{there was}} a short period of trials with <b>chain</b> <b>boats.</b> Although the flow of Havel has always been low, {{nevertheless}} a large number of laden barges could be towed inexpensively using a chain steamer. On the Havel and Spree rivers, between Pichelsdorf near the city of Spandau and the Crown Prince Bridge (Kronprinzenbrücke), the Unterbaum {{on the edge of the}} Berlin, the Berlin Barge Company, founded in 1879 by two Englishmen, opened a <b>chain</b> <b>boat</b> service on 16 June 1882. In the Havelland there were numerous brick factories whose products were transported almost exclusively by ship. In summer 1894, <b>chain</b> <b>boats</b> on the Havel and Spree were withdrawn. The development of the steam-driven tugboat with screw propellers had superseded them.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Chain</b> <b>boat</b> {{services}} were also established on the Sheksna in 1871 by the Chain Steamship Company on the Scheksna whose headquarters were in St. Petersburg. The chain extended over {{a length of}} 445 km from the river's confluence with the Volga {{to the city of}} St. Petersburg. From the start, the <b>chain</b> <b>boat</b> service achieved poor results. Subsequently, the company terminated the chain service on a section of the route approximately 278 km long that had a very slight gradient and replaced it with a tugboat service. On the remaining 167 km section with its strong currents the <b>chain</b> <b>boats</b> made a profit in many years of about 30%. In 1885, the company introduced 14 chain steamers on this stretch, each capable of [...]|$|R

50|$|However, fast {{currents}} when rivers were in spate {{could also}} be problematic for <b>chain</b> <b>boats.</b> Depending {{on the nature of}} the river bed, strong movements of sediment could lead to ements to aggradation, thus covering the chain with gravel and stones. A river bed with lots of ledges or large boulders - such as on some sections of the Danube - caused the chain to become snagged and was a major hindrance to <b>chain</b> <b>boats.</b>|$|R
5|$|Upon her return, Confiance {{ran into}} the British {{blockade}} and was chased by a frigate; Surcouf managed to evade her by throwing overboard {{all but one of}} her guns, his <b>boats,</b> anchors, <b>chains</b> and even components of his masts. He eventually arrived at La Rochelle on 13 April 1801.|$|R
50|$|<b>Chain</b> <b>boats</b> were favoured on shallow rivers with fast currents. This was {{the reason}} for the flat, shallow draught of their keels. <b>Chain</b> <b>boats</b> {{optimized}} for particularly shallow water had a draught of only 40 to 50 cm when unladen. Even fully laden with coal, their draught was only about 70 to 75 cm. This shallow draught enabled river transportation even in the dry summer months when the water level of rivers could be very low.|$|R
50|$|Through {{the use of}} {{the steam}} engine it was now possible, for the first time, to meet the rising demand for the {{transport}} capacity driven by increasing industrialization {{in the second half of}} the 19th and first half of the 20th century. <b>Chain</b> <b>boat</b> navigation gave sailors and their barges the opportunity to compete against increasing competition from the railways.Before the introduction of <b>chain</b> <b>boats,</b> paddle steamers were already working as tugs and cargo boats on some stretches of river, but they did not hail a breakthrough in mass transport. Due to its dependence on the water level of the river and on market economic interests, the steamer could not guarantee a regular service. Not until regular services with fast connections, as well as the guaranteed, low transportation costs of the <b>chain</b> <b>boats,</b> could river barge transportation begin to be competitive.|$|R
