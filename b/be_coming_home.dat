25|$|Simons {{had grown}} tired of small town life in Kansas in any event and {{was ready for a}} new challenge. Newspaper {{publisher}} Victor Berger, now America's first socialist Congressman, had previously promised Simons a job on his English-language daily, the Milwaukee Leader, if he had ever needed a position. In June 1913, Simons decided to take Berger up on the offer, accepting the position without great enthusiasm but feeling as though it was for the time being the best he could do. Algie and May Simons would <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> <b>home</b> to Wisconsin.|$|E

2500|$|On April 5, 1968, King {{arrived in}} Memphis to {{retrieve}} her husband's body {{and decided that}} the casket should be kept open during the funeral {{with the hope that}} her children would realize upon seeing his body that he would not <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> <b>home.</b> Mrs. King called photographer Bob Fitch and asked for documentation to be done, having known him for years. On April 7, 1968, former Vice President Richard Nixon visited Mrs. King and recalled his first meeting with her husband in 1955. Nixon also went to Mrs. King's husband's funeral on April 9, 1968, but did not walk in the procession. Nixon believed participating in the procession would be [...] "grandstanding." ...|$|E
2500|$|Agnes, an upper-class {{woman in}} her late 50s, {{discusses}} the possibility of losing her mind. [...] Agnes exclaims that although she is astonished by her own thoughts of madness, it is her sister, Claire, who lives with them, who astonishes her the most. [...] Claire appears and apologizes to Agnes that her own nature is such to bring out in her sister {{the full force of}} her brutality. Claire senses that Tobias and Agnes’s daughter Julia might be going on her fourth divorce and predicts that Julia will <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> <b>home</b> shortly. [...] Agnes reenters, announcing that Julia is coming home. Tobias then {{tells the story of a}} cat that he once had. There is a knock on the door. Harry and Edna, Agnes and Tobias’s best friends, arrive and ask if they can stay there. They have been frightened by something intangible.|$|E
2500|$|On April 10, 2007, a Bahamian {{judge ruled}} Larry Birkhead, photographer, {{as the father}} of Dannielynn. DNA tests had {{established}} Birkhead as the father, with 99.99% certainty. Commenting on the revelation, Birkhead stated, [...] "I hate {{to be the one to}} tell you this but, I told you so. I'm the father...My baby's going to <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> <b>home</b> pretty soon." [...] Birkhead subsequently applied for an amended birth certificate listing him as the father, which paved the way for him to obtain a passport for the baby to leave with him for the United States. Howard K. Stern did not contest the DNA results or the ruling. Subsequent to the ruling, Birkhead returned to the United States with the baby. Smith's mother, Virgie Arthur, appealed the ruling but it was later denied and she was ordered to pay costs.|$|E

2500|$|The song title [...] "Yellow Ledbetter" [...] {{is derived}} from the actual name of an old friend of Vedder from Chicago, named Tim Ledbetter. Although many fans have made their own interpretations of the song, a common theory has been that the song is about someone {{receiving}} a letter and finding his or her brother had died overseas in war, cited from the lyrics in the Live at the Garden version [...] "I don't know whether my brother will <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> <b>home</b> in a box or a bag." [...] On the official bootleg release of 5/3/03 - State College, Pennsylvania, Vedder sings [...] "I'd like to wish this war away, and I tried, but it just, just don't happen, don't happen that way/And my brother...they sent him off to fight for the flag. I just, I don't hope he comes home in a box or a bag", and [...] "And I know that he's just following his path. As long, as long as it's not a box or a bag." [...] On the official bootleg release of 7/11/03 - Mansfield, Massachusetts, Vedder sings in the first verse [...] "I think of him when I go to bed, and he's coming home in a box or a bag." [...] It's widely known that Vedder changes the lyrics of the song when singing it live, so it's difficult to know if what he's singing at the time are the original lyrics from 1991.|$|E
