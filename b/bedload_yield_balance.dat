40|$|The present work focusses on <b>bedload</b> <b>yield</b> estimations for the Bevano River, a {{small stream}} {{situated}} in the Emilia-Romagna Region of northern Italy. The Bevano final stretch is inside a natural park, {{one of the last}} unspoilt zones in the Emilia-Romagna coast. This stream resulted to have very complex outlet dynamics. The mouth is moving rapidly and constantly towards the north, eroding the dunes and the pine forest behind them. The bedload transport was correlated to the long and short term migration of the river mouth. The migration was also related to rainfall data, marine forcing agents and width variations of the beach close to the river outlet. Because of a lack in direct measurements, the <b>bedload</b> <b>yield</b> was assessed using the ENGELUND & HANSEN formula [1972] (modified in MONTEFUSCO [1984]). This formula was considered the most suitable because it predicts the volume of sandy fraction discharged at the river mouth. Rainfall data were collected at the Bertinoro Station (180 m above m. s. l.) and at the Idrovora Fosso Ghiaia Station (2 m above m. s. l.), obtaining an overview of the rainfall for the entire Bevano catchment. The long term evolution of the outlet was studied using four aerial photographs captured between 1943 and 1998. Short term monitoring of the mouth was studied between April 2003 and June 2003, using a Total Station. The influence of tidal currents and waves on the outlet morphodynamics were studied using sand tracers. Both long term and short term analysis revealed that the river is moving rapidly northwards. This trend fastened during the last years (from 1998 and 2003). The <b>bedload</b> <b>yield</b> calculated empirically (Q 355), resulted to be, during fair weather conditions, not significant. The river transports sediments only during periods of heavy rainfalls (Q 10). This material is trapped on the submerged delta and moved onshore by marine currents, increasing the sediment budget of the study area. Most of the sand available for the Lido di Dante beach comes from lateral dune erosion, as it resulted from direct topographic surveys. Sand tracers revealed that the sand eroded by the dunes is transported outside the river mouth by ebb-tidal currents and then northwards by longshore currents, increasing the quantity of sediments available for the beach. Local authorities intend to open a new river mouth, southward from the actual one, in order to avoid inland floods during periods of abundant rainfalls, and marine water ingression inside the pine forest behind the dunes during storms. As a result of this intervention the beach northward from the mouth will start to retreat {{because of the lack of}} sediment coming from dune erosion...|$|R

40|$|The {{measurement}} and prediction of soil erosion {{is important for}} understanding both natural and disturbed landscape systems. In particular numerical models of soil erosion are important tools for managing landscapes as well as understanding how they have evolved over time. Over the last 40 [*]years {{a variety of methods}} have been used to determine rates of soil loss from a landscape and these can be loosely categorized into empirical and physically based models. Alternatively, physically based landscape evolution models (LEMs) have been developed that provide information on soil erosion rates at much longer decadal or centennial scales, over large spatial scales and examine how they may respond to environmental and climatic changes. Both soil erosion LEMs are interested in similar outcomes (landscape development and sediment delivery) yet have quite different methodologies and parameterizations. This paper applies a LEM (the CAESAR model) {{for the first time at}} time and space scales where soil erosion models have largely been used. It tests the ability of the LEM to predict soil erosion on a 30 [*]m experimental plot on a trial rehabilitated landform in the Northern Territory, Australia. It then continues to discuss the synergies and differences between soil erosion and LEMs. The results demonstrate that once calibrated for the site hydrology, predicted suspended sediment and <b>bedload</b> <b>yields</b> from CAESAR show a close correspondence in both volume and timing of field measured data. The model also predicts, at decadal scales, sediment loads close to that of field measured data. Findings indicate that the small-scale drainage network that forms within these erosion plots is an important control on the timing and magnitude of sediment delivery. Therefore, it is important to use models that can alter the DEM to reflect changing topography and drainage network as well as having a greater emphasis on channel processes...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1980 Presentation date: 1979 - 11 - 06 Sediment {{transport}} {{measurements on}} Flynn Creek, a headwater stream in the Oregon Coast Range, have illustrated {{the magnitude of}} fluvial transfer processes, primarily of the bedload component, during a moderate storm runoff season (1979 water year). The total dissolved solids concentration of storm runoff averaged 40 mg/L, and was independent of water discharge. Most particulate export from the 202 ha forested watershed occurred during the annual peak flow of 0. 75 m³/sec-km² (2 -year return interval). Suspended load {{was the most important}} transport mode, with a total yield of 5. 7 x l 0 ⁴ kg during the 24 h peak flow period. The export of coarse particulate organic matter during the same period was 1. 5 x 10 ³ kg. Bedload discharge, as measured with vortex tube and Helley-Smith samplers, occurred in pulses of short duration that did not necessarily coincide with peak streamflow. For the same 24 h storm runoff period, the total <b>bedload</b> <b>yield</b> {{at the mouth of the}} watershed was only 2. 6 x 10 ³ kg (particles > 0. 25 mm), and consisted primarily of sand-size material. Bedload discharge at an upstream site (1. 3 x 10 ⁴ kg) was dominated by gravel-size particles. Channel morphology and in-stream obstructions (organic debris, fish trap) appear to cause significant spatial and temporal variations in sediment transport and streambed composition. Although streamflow was the principal variable controlling sediment transport, results suggest that supply limitations exist. The supply of transportable materials is dependent on the retention characteristics of the stream channel and on local hydraulic conditions. The discharge of both suspended solids and coarse particulate organic matter peaked early in the storm; however, pulses of the latter component on the recession limb appeared to be related to streambed disturbances. Bedload movement is an important process regulating both bed composition and particulate yields in this Coast Range stream. The Helley-smith sampler was the preferable method for use in streams having a large fraction of bedload in the sand-size range. The vortex tube trapped from 60 - 70...|$|R

40|$|Until recently, bedload {{sediment}} transport {{has generally been}} investigated under steady flow conditions, which does not represent the typical {{sediment transport}} scenarios observed within natural fluvial channels. These channels often experience significant variations in bedload transport and bed morphological evolution under unsteady flow conditions, especially during flood hydrograph events. At present, however, there is a distinct {{lack of understanding of}} the interaction between hydrograph flow properties and the variability in bedload transport and bed evolution. Within the current study, different series of parametric experiments were conducted in two glass-walled, tilting flume facilities with the main aim of investigating the response of uniform and graded sediment beds to a range of different unsteady flow hydrograph conditions, and compare this to the corresponding response under equivalent steady flow conditions. The novelty of this research against previous studies is highlighted in terms of (i) the identification of the individual influence of hydrograph-related parameters (shape , unsteadiness HG and total water work Wk) on unsteady sediment transport characteristics (e. g. hysteresis and temporal lag) and the resulting bed evolution; (ii) the use of natural-shaped hydrographs (single and double peak) rather than stepped, triangular or trapezoidal hydrographs; (iii) the direct comparison between <b>bedload</b> sediment transport <b>yields</b> and corresponding bed evolution under unsteady hydrograph and equivalent (volume) steady flows; and (iv) enhanced understanding of influence of intergranular effects (e. g. particle exposure and/or hiding) on observed bedload sediment transport behaviour in unsteady and equivalent steady flows. Experiments conducted with both uniform (course sand, d = 1. 95 mm) and graded (fine gravel, d 50 = 2. 64 mm, 5. 00 mm) beds not only confirm the clockwise and counter-clockwise hysteresis in measured bed load transport rates, but also reveal no/mixed hysteresis patterns as a transitional condition between these clockwise and counter-clockwise hystereses for bedload transport measured under unsteady flow hydrographs. For graded sediment transport, the intergranular effect on temporal lag and hysteresis patterns for transport of classified fine, medium and coarse size classes within graded (unimodal, bimodal and fine-grained) sediment beds in unsteady flow hydrographs is also revealed. Specifically, the coarse size class tends to respond preferentially to the changing flow and exhibits clockwise hysteresis in general; whereas the fine size class tends to become more active later and demonstrates reduced clockwise, no/mixed or counter-clockwise hysteresis. Corresponding temporal variations and hysteresis patterns in the median db 50 size of the bedload transport load are also observed, with the db 50 value generally reaching its peaking value during the rising hydrograph limb and indicating a clockwise hysteresis over the hydrograph duration. Bedforms (i. e. dunes and alternate bars) are found to develop only within uniform sediment bed (d = 1. 95 mm) under both steady and unsteady flows tested. A relevant analysis of the formative conditions under which these bedforms develop is presented. By contrast, no bedforms are observed to form within graded sediment beds; only slight bed evolution (e. g. bed aggradation up to + 5 mm at upstream) is identified for fine-grained sediment bed (d 50 = 2. 64 mm) runs. Additionally, the median size of the bed surface ds 50 is shown to coarsen during the antecedent flow conditions within all graded sediment beds (compared to d 50 in specified particle size distributions). This surface coarsening persists over the duration of both steady and unsteady flow events tested in current study [e. g. run-averaged ds 50 values: (i) unimodal grading, ds 50 = 6. 51 mm (> d 50 = 5 mm); (ii) bimodal grading, ds 50 = 6. 74 mm (> d 50 = 5 mm); and (iii) fine-grained grading, ds 50 = 3. 62 mm (> d 50 = 2. 64 mm) ]. The temporal variations in the median bedload size db 50 (< ds 50 throughout) for both the steady and unsteady flow runs, are also responsible for explaining the development and persistence of the surface armour layer. Bedload transport and bed evolution for uniform and graded sediment beds under steady flows are measured to provide a benchmark for direct comparison with equivalent <b>bedload</b> rates and <b>yields,</b> bedform development, and variations in bedload and bed surface grain size composition under unsteady flows. The difference in effects of unsteady and steady flow is found to be significant for bedload rate (with the unsteady-steady bedload ratio Kq = 0. 23 – 14. 95), <b>bedload</b> <b>yields</b> (i. e. yield ratio us = 1. 11 – 13. 56), bedforms (i. e. dunes, alternate bars and etc.) and bedload composition (i. e. db 50 ratio Kb = 0. 38 – 1. 56), but less significant for bed surface composition (i. e. ds 50 ratio Ks = 0. 92 – 1. 33). Further, the individual influence of hydrograph related parameters (shape, unsteadiness HG, total water work Wk) on <b>bedload</b> <b>yields,</b> yield distribution over the rising and falling two limbs of single-peaked hydrographs, and on of bedform characteristics (i. e. type, dimensions) is also evaluated. In more complex flow hydrographs, such as double-peaked hydrographs, the equivalent bedload transport and bed evolution characteristics are also derived. Finally, the presence of specific grain size classes within the graded sediment beds and their influence on the transport of other six classes is considered from comparison of sediment transport characteristics for (i) the unimodal and bimodal sediment mixtures (with the same d 50 = 5. 0 mm), and (ii) the uniform (d = 1. 95 mm) and fine-grained sediment mixture (d 50 = 2. 64 mm), which arise from relative grain exposure and sheltering effects under the same steady and unsteady flow events. An idealised, theoretical analysis of the hydrodynamic forces and moments associated with these potential impacts is provided. Most importantly, the transport of fine particles is found to vary depending upon the presence state of coarser particle sizes in the surface layer (i. e. stationary or mobile to varying rates), which reveals the mechanism for selective fractional transport within the graded sediment bed under equivalent steady and unsteady hydrograph flow conditions...|$|R

40|$|The Blue Nile is {{a typical}} {{allogenic}} river since it is fed by the monsoon type rainfall on its headwater catchment in Ethiopian highlands and flows downstream trough an almost dry land in Sudan to join the White Nile at Khartoum, giving rise to the Main Nile. The Blue Nile supplies the largest proportion (about 60 %) of the flood water of and about 75 % of the sediment to the Main Nile. For this reason {{the relevance of the}} Blue Nile goes beyond the confluence with the White Nile since it remarkably imprints the hydrologic and sediment characteristics of the Main Nile. Notwithstanding the critical importance of the Blue Nile sediment load, few data of suspended sediment yield have been published and such data are non uniform and sometimes contrasting. <b>Bedload</b> <b>yield</b> is extrapolated mainly from reservoir siltation since field measurements of bedload transport during floods are not yet available (or unpublished). This led a few authors to consider bedload as negligible though the marked delta erosion after the Asswan dam construction and the worrying volume loss due to sedimentation would suggest the opposite. This presentation is based on a large, unpublished data set of flow, suspended load and sediment grain-size characteristic measured in the sixties on the Blue Nile at Khartoum. Suspended load data are analysed and compared with modern data available from the literature. Some recent data of the Blue Nile measured in Ethiopia are reported and analysed as well. Bedload is obtained by using the dune migration method and compared with the only data measured in the field on the lower reach of the Main Nile downstream of Aswan dam. To calculate bedload, several dune geometry models have been used and the resulting yields are compared with suspended load. The data demonstrate that bedload is not to negligible (this result is particularly relevant in view of the construction of the Great Dam of Merow in Sudan and the lack of bed sediment transport data) and that the dune methodology could be applied successfully as it was for the lower reaches of the Main Nile. Moreover, recent climatic variations and land use change in Ethiopia would suggest to intensify the field measurements of the Blue Nile sediment load as it is expected to have changed during the last decades making old data unsuitable for proper dam design and river mangement...|$|R

It is prudent to take appropriate measures throughout the specification process of harmonised data to avoid excessive costs; on the other hand it is necessary to make the benefits visible to improve the acceptance of the necessary measures. This paper proposes the multi-criteria-based Cost-Benefit Considerations instead of the classical Cost-Benefit Analysis for evaluating the impact of the data harmonisation process. Using the example of INSPIRE (Infrastructure for Spatial Information for Environment) it shows how cost-benefit aspects are considered at the different steps of data specification development. We conclude that such methodology <b>yields</b> <b>balanced</b> results in terms of objectives to be reached and the related costs. JRC. H. 6 -Spatial data infrastructure...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2010 This study {{examines}} stream channel erosion processes {{in a small}} urbanizing watershed influenced by deposits of the Columbia Basin catastrophic floods: Kelley Creek, a 12 -km² tributary of Johnson Creek, located just east of Portland, Oregon. Information on landscape history, stream channels, and sediment dynamics was compiled. The effects of future land use changes on stream channel response were projected. The likely effects of engineered solutions (stormwater management detention or infiltration facilities) are compared to land-use controls in mitigating the impact of future development on channel erosion. The geology of Kelley Creek is shaped by volcanic processes and Missoula floods, leading to fine-textured soils and streambeds that are susceptible to erosion. Headwaters are buttes of the Boring Lava formation overlain by Springwater Formation mudflow deposits. Alluvial silts deposited during late Pleistocene catastrophic floods mantle the low-relief valley floor. Land use in Kelley Creek transitioned from forestry to agriculture in the 20 th century, and more recently to urban expansion, increasing concerns of watershed managers about effects of development on sediment dynamics. Since 1930, land use on the valley floor of Kelley Creek {{has been dominated by}} nursery and berry agricultural production. Forested headwaters have been impacted by roads, culverts, and timber harvest. Seven percent of watershed area is currently impervious, with housing and commercial uses projected to increase following the incorporation of Kelley Creek into Portland's metropolitan urban growth boundary. Field surveys and engineering calculations were used to estimate sediment transport under current and future conditions in the watershed. Cross sectional geometry, slope and sediment size distributions were obtained from 15 locations in first to second-order channels in the watershed, and data were analyzed with sediment transport equations to simulate annual sediment transport rates given current and post-development flow patterns. Results indicate that the stream channel is most sensitive to altered discharge patterns where gravel-sized (D₅₀ > 10 mm) sediments currently are mobilized during annual peak events. In locations where fine (D₅₀ < 5 mm) particles dominate the stream bed, particles mobilize throughout the year and changes in discharge patterns do not increase the duration of transport or overall <b>bedload</b> <b>yields.</b> Because most of the sensitive locations with gravel sediments are located within or near the forested headwaters, preserving these headwater forests will protect sensitive stream channels as effectively as engineered stormwater retention or infiltration approaches. Kelley Creek's stream channel is still adjusting to recent mudflows and catastrophic floods, which provided abundant supplies of fine, erodible materials. Allowing this adjustment to continue without accelerating erosion in the face of rapid urban development poses an unusual challenge for managing geomorphic processes...|$|R
40|$|Achieving safe yield, the {{fundamental}} objective of Arizona's 1980 Groundwater Management Act (GMA), {{may prove to}} be a more elusive goal than once expected. The GMA mandated that the Phoenix, Tucson and Prescott Active Management Areas (AMAs) achieve safe <b>yield,</b> a <b>balancing</b> of groundwater withdrawals with recharge, by the year 2025. Some of the assumptions and projections used to set the goal, however, have not held up after 20 years, with the result that safe yield may be a difficult target for some AMAs to reach...|$|R

The framework provides a unified perspective into which some earlier work on techniques for cross-language information retrieval based on translation probabilities can be cast. Modeling synonymy and filtering translation probabilities using bidirectional evidence are shown to <b>yield</b> a <b>balance</b> between retrieval effectiveness and query-time (or indexing-time) efficiency that seems well suited large-scale applications. Evaluations with six test collections show consistent improvements over strong baselines. Keywords: Cross-Language IR, Statistical machine translatio...|$|R
