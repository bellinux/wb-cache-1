5|$|After {{reaching}} peak intensity, Debby slowly weakened, and {{was between}} Category2 and 1 when it passed south of Newfoundland early on September19. Thereafter, the storm accelerated and was moving at roughly 60mph (95km/h) towards the east. Debby was rapidly approaching the British Isles on September20, shortly before it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. Overall, impact was minor in the Lesser Antilles, with only light to moderate rainfall in Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands. On <b>Bermuda,</b> <b>high</b> winds caused some power outages and knocked over trees, though {{damage on the}} island was minimal. In addition, Debby dropped rainfall and produced moderately strong winds on Newfoundland.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{transitioning}} into {{a tropical}} cyclone, the depression executed an elongated counter-clockwise loop to the northeast. Conditions favored further intensification, {{and based on}} ship reports, it is estimated the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Bertha early on July28. Bertha quickly strengthened to attain hurricane status early on July29 about halfway between Cape Canaveral, Florida and Bermuda. The strengthening trend was brief, however, as increased vertical wind shear weakened it back to a tropical storm late on July29, with the center exposed from the deep convection. Bertha continued slowly northeastward to ridging from the <b>Bermuda</b> <b>high</b> extending westward to the United States.|$|E
5|$|Reconnaissance Aircraft {{and surface}} reports {{confirmed}} {{the existence of}} a circulation. Dean moved northwestward at 22mph (35km/h), {{under the influence of the}} <b>Bermuda</b> <b>High</b> to its northeast. The storm strengthened slightly to reach winds of 60mph (95km/h) later on August 22, though the circulation was exposed on the western edge of the convection due to the storm's quick forward motion and persistent wind shear. Initial forecasts predicted the shear to decrease, allowing Dean to attain hurricane status with winds of over 80mph (130km/h). However, an upper-level trough produced an increase of shear over the storm, and by August 23 Dean weakened to a tropical depression. Hours later, the circulation dissipated, and Dean degenerated into a tropical wave to the east of the Bahamas. Regeneration was considered unlikely at the time.|$|E

25|$|Florida {{is a large}} {{subtropical}} {{state that}} experiences hurricanes. Although Brevard county is located along Florida's eastern peninsula, it is less frequently impacted by direct hurricane landfalls than portions of the Panhandle or South Florida. There are two predominant reasons for this. First, westward moving tropical systems often reach an atmospheric ridge weakness in the <b>Bermuda</b> <b>High</b> {{by the time they}} approach Florida at a latitude as northerly as Brevard County. Combined with frontal systems that exit the United States' East Coast, many of these tropical systems are steered northwest and eventually curve northward offshore along Florida's East Central Coast. A second reason is that hurricanes landfalling along the Florida peninsula Gulf Coast often weaken to a tropical storm by the time they move northeast to affect Brevard County (with some exceptions, such as 2004's Charley). No major hurricane, defined as category 3 or higher, has ever struck Brevard since 1850, the beginning of recorded climate.|$|E

Reports from a Reconnaissance flight indicated that Becky was disorganized, with a minimum barometric pressure of [...] Although a fairly strong low-level circulation developed, there was insufficient warming of the center to produce a significant drop in barometric pressure at the surface. Late on July 20, a ship reported a minimum pressure of about , and another ship reported sustained winds of 65mph (100km/h), which would be Becky's peak intensity. A Reconnaissance flight and weather radars suggested the development of an eye feature, and initially it was believed that the storm attained minimal hurricane status. Later it was later confirmed that Becky remained a tropical storm, and the previously forming eye failed to persist.|$|E

50|$|By far {{the most}} {{powerful}} storm of the season, this hurricane formed well east of the Windward Islands and moved northwestward steadily strengthening. It grazed the Leeward Islands as a Category 2 hurricane and began to recurve shortly thereafter. During this recurvature, it strengthened into a Category 3 storm, eventually attaining winds of 120 mi/h km/h. It would maintain Category 3 intensity {{for the next four}} days until it became extratropical on September 23. The storm passed almost directly over Bermuda early on September 21, buffeting the island with 115 mi/h km/h winds and an eight-foot storm surge. As the center of this hurricane passed Bermuda to the southeast, a lull occurred on the island for an hour around 9 am on September 21. The lowest pressure measured was 968 mbar (28.57 inHg).

Wind shear also decreased, allowing Leslie to re-organize and strengthen into a hurricane at 1200UTC on September5.

The storm interacted with Hurricane Connie to its northwest in a process known as the Fujiwhara effect, in which Diane turned toward the north. Quick intensification ensued, potentially due to interaction with a cold-core low that increased atmospheric instability. On August 12, the storm rapidly intensified into a hurricane. The intensification was so quick that a ship southeast of the center believed Diane was undergoing a loop due to a steady drop in barometric pressure, despite moving away from the hurricane.|$|E
500|$|Precipitation {{during the}} wet season is {{primarily}} caused by air mass thunderstorms and the easterly flow {{out of the}} subtropical high (<b>Bermuda</b> <b>High).</b> Intense daytime heating of the ground causes the warm moist tropical air to rise, creating the afternoon thundershowers typical of tropical climates. 2:00pm is the mean time of daily thundershowers across South Florida and the Everglades.
