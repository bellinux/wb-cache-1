These are usually spring applied, with air pressure {{being used to}} hold the <b>brake</b> <b>off</b> and powerful springs holding the brakes on. In most cases, a small lever in the cab is connected to a valve which can admit air to the parking brake cylinders to release the parking brake, or release the air to apply the brake. On some modern vehicles the valve is operated electrically from a lever or button in the cab. The system is relatively safe since if air pressure is lost the springs will apply the brakes. Also, the system prevents the parking brake being released if there is insufficient air pressure to apply the foot brake. A disadvantage to this system {{is that if a}} vehicle requires towing and cannot provide its own air supply, an external supply must be provided to allow the parking brake to be released, or the brake shoes must be manually wound off against the springs.|$|E

50|$|Large {{vehicles}} are usually fitted with power operated or power assisted handbrakes.Power assisted handbrakes are usually found on large vans {{as well as}} some older heavy vehicles. These operate {{in the same way as}} a conventional handbrake, but pulling the lever will operate a valve that allows air or hydraulic pressure or vacuum into a cylinder which applies force to the brake shoes and makes applying the handbrake easier. When releasing the handbrake, the same mechanism also provides assistance to the driver in disengaging the ratchet. Particularly on commercial vehicles with air operated brakes, this has the added benefit of making it much harder or even impossible to release the parking brake when insufficient air pressure is available to operate the brakes.

Since the 1970 s, the course of huge icebergs is permanently tracked using satellite images by the National Ice Center (NIC). A large <b>brake</b> <b>off</b> event is undetected very likely and huge icebergs are easily to track on {{their way through the}} ocean. In many cases, calving of smaller icebergs takes place unobserved, which hampers the estimation of calving rates and mass loss caused by iceberg calving. The surface structures of the floating ice masses around Antarctica give information about {{the size and shape of}} potential calved icebergs, so that the origin of icebergs drifting in the ocean can be restricted to a few calving fronts. SAR images at different resolutions and an edge detection were used to map the surface structures of the floating ice masses around Antarctica and regarding to this, a calving front classification was done. Using the results of the classification, icebergs within SAR images could be assigned to their potential calving front. An iceberg drift model is then used to certify the origin. The iceberg drift model is implemented in a Finite Element Sea ice Ocean Model (FESOM), and the course and the velocity of icebergs are calculated. With this information it is possible to track iceberg ensembles back to their calving front to estimate local calving rates...|$|E
