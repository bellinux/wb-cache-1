40|$|This study {{investigates the}} first-order {{mechanics}} of polygonal fault networks in Utopia Planitia, Mars and whether terrestrial sedimentary basin polygonal terrains are an analog for giant Martian polygons {{since there is}} an overlap in scale between the 3 km terrestrial polygons and the 1 - 40 km giant polygons of Mars. Volumetric contraction accommodates the extensional faulting observed in both cases. Boundary Element Method numerical models are used to simulate the first-order-mechanics of the faulting process. Models use material properties for wet, fine sediment, and apply an extensional strain to produce volumetric contraction. Fracture seeds that simulate the <b>buried</b> <b>topography</b> beneath the basin are placed {{at the base of}} the model. MOLA tracks from the Highlands are used to create the uneven topography beneath the basin since the underlying topography of the Northern Lowlands is thought to be similar to the topography of the older, Southern Highlands. The model investigates whether 1 2 ̆ 6 2 km layer of wet, fine sediments will produce the fracture spacing observed within the polygonal terrains in Utopia (5 – 6. 5 km). A fracture network that is similar to the scale of the polygonal terrain in the Utopia Basin is established within the model at low strain, supporting the idea that <b>buried</b> <b>topography</b> could be the primary scaling factor for the polygon grabens. The results do not constrain an upper limit for strain; the observed trough widths in Utopia suggest that further strain was expressed by the widening of the troughs. Material properties for wet, fine sediments, analogous to the terrestrial counterpart, are appropriate for the model to match what is observed in Utopia. The power-law scale of Highlands topography controls the scale of the surface fracture spacing in the models. Measurements of running average of trough spacing along radial transects with respect to the center of the basin did not yield a monotonic decrease in trough spacing as would be expected for a smooth basement with no <b>buried</b> <b>topography.</b> Study results support the case for <b>buried</b> <b>topography</b> controlling the scale of the giant polygons of Utopia Planitia...|$|E
40|$|In {{his search}} for {{underground}} reservoirs, the ground-water specialist often must seek clues to the occurrence of aquifers by looking for conditions which in the past were favorable for the deposition of permeable beds. In glaciated regions {{a study of the}} <b>buried</b> <b>topography</b> often can provide such clues, leading to the location of buried sand and gravel aquifers. A striking example of the relationship between <b>buried</b> <b>topography</b> and the occurrence of an important aquifer was revealed by an investigation of the ground-water resources of Franklin County, Ohio, made by the U. S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the Division of Water, Ohio Department of Natural Resources. In eastern Franklin County a buried low-land, developed on beds of soft shale, is a repository for thick and extensive de-posits of permeable sand and gravel. The sand and gravel were deposited by glacial meltwaters which were confined to the lowland by abutments formed by more resistant rocks on either side. These permeable deposits compose an aquifer of great potential importance to the Columbus metropolitan area. The glacial deposits in Franklin County range in thickness from zero, in area...|$|E

Data are based on a comparison between the structure of a Hawaiian lava lake and the mare ridges. Resulting data suggest that these ridges may have formed as squeeze-ups and autointrusives in tension fractures over <b>buried</b> <b>topography</b> in the crust of luna lava lakes. Data also suggest that mare ridges may result from: (1) pressure ridges in flows, (2) compressional features resulting from subsidence of mare lava, (3) volcanic ring structures and extrusives, or loccoliths fed by lunar grid controlled dikes, (4) draped topography and fissure eruptives, (5) drag folds or tension-gash dikes caused by wrench faulting at depth, and (6) postmare thrust faults...|$|E
40|$|Geophysical survey {{techniques}} {{are commonly used}} as part of studies to reconstruct past geographies in archaeological and palaeoenvironmental landscape investigations onshore and offshore. However, their use across the intertidal zone for constructing contiguous models is far more challenging. In order to enhance {{the interpretation of the}} recovered data forward modelling is used here to demonstrate the effective use of a staged approach to site investigation. Examples of data from electrical and electromagnetic techniques have been modelled and tested with ground truth measurements including trial pits, coring and cone penetrometer testing. This combination of forward modelling and testing has proved to be particularly effective at mapping key geological situations of archaeological interest. The approach is demonstrated by reference to varying sub-surface sediment types exemplified by two field examples from the UK coast where typical palaeolandscape features, namely incised channels and deeply <b>buried</b> <b>topographies</b> are encountered. These palaeogeographic features were chosen as they have high potential for association with the evidence of past human activity. PostprintPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This paper {{shows the}} {{potential}} of gravity data to map a <b>buried</b> landfill bottom <b>topography.</b> To this end, a gravity inversion method is presented for estimating the landfill’s bottom depths at discrete points assuming a decrease of the density contrast with depth according to a hyperbolic law. The method’s efficiency was tested using synthetic data from simulated waste landfills, producing estimated bottom topographies {{very close to the}} true ones. The method’s potentiality has been further evaluated in applying it to the gravity data from the abandoned Thomas Farm Landfill site, Indiana, USA, whose bottom topogra-phy is known. The estimated topography showed close agreement with the known Thomas Farm Landfill’s bottom topography...|$|R
40|$|On {{the basis}} of field observations, thin section interpretations, microanalytical data, {{electrical}} resistivity survey and luminescence dating, the age, composition and internal structure of coastal eolianite on the west Black Sea coast at Sile, Istanbul, was studied for a combined interpretation of dune rock development and facies characteristics. Results demonstrate that the eolianite {{is made up of}} south-dipping, large-scale dune stratification, consisting mainly of quartz sand and, in particular, abundant ooids, as well as the binding cement which is composed of calcite and aragonite. Based on Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) images, the eolianite has a thickness of between 3. 5 m and 8 m and overlies a <b>buried</b> rugged <b>topography</b> that has developed on the Pliocene unit. This suggests the predominance of northerly winds that account for the landward removal of dune sands by offshore wind drift prior to carbonate cementation. Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating estimations revealed that the initial deposition of the laminated eolianite layers on the underlying older unit took place at 138. 57 +/- 13. 65 ka, matching the Karangatian highstand or Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5 e.

40|$|Extensive {{areas of}} the Martian {{northern}} plains in Utopia and Acidalia planitiae are characterized by 'polygonal terrane'. Polygonal terrane consists of material cut by complex troughs defining a pattern resembling mudcracks, columnar joints, or frost-wedge polygons on earth. However, the Martian polygons are orders of magnitude larger than these potential earth analogues, leading to severe mechanical difficulties for genetic models based on simple analogy arguments. Plate-bending and finite element models indicate that shrinkage of desiccating sediment or cooling volcanics accompanied by differential compaction over <b>buried</b> <b>topography</b> can account for the stresses responsible for polygon troughs {{as well as the}} large size of the polygons. Although trough widths and depths relate primarily to shrinkage, the large scale of the polygonl pattern relates to the spacing between topographic elevations on the surface buried beneath polygonal terrane material. Geological relationships favor a sedimentary origin for polygonal terrane material, but our model is not dependent on the specific genesis. Our analysis also suggests that the polygons must have formed at a geologically rapid rate...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Estimates of lava volumes on {{planetary}} surfaces {{provide important}} {{data on the}} lava flooding history and thermal evolution of a planet. Lack of information concerning {{the configuration of the}} topography prior to volcanic flooding requires the use of a variety of techniques to estimate lava thick-nesses and volumes. A technique is described and developed which provides volume estimates by artificially flooding unflooded lunar topography characteristic of certain geological environments, and tracking the area covered, lava thicknesses, and lava volumes. Comparisons of map patterns of incom-pletely <b>buried</b> <b>topography</b> in these artificially flooded areas are then made to lava-flooded topography on the Moon in order to estimate the actual ava volumes. This technique is applied to two areas related to lunar impact basins; the relatively unflooded Orientale basin, and the Archimedes-Apennine B nch region of the Imbrium basin. Artificially flood-ing the Orientale basin to the Cordillera Mountains (outer basin ring) produces a lava fill geometry with two components; (a) the basin interior (within the inner Rook ring) where the area covered is small but lava thicknesses are large (6 - 8 kin), and (b) the basin edges where larger areas are covered but thicknesses are less, averaging about 2 kin. Detailed examination of the Archimedes-Apennine Bench area (Imbrium basin edge) also shows average thicknesses in this region of basins of approxi...|$|E
40|$|Based on the {{synthesis}} and reinterpretation of long-term data of geophysical studies {{together with the}} hydrology - hydrological materials it has been received new data about the <b>buried</b> <b>topography</b> and spatial distribution of groundwater runoff of the Aragats massif. First of all, it requires to determine the structure of its buried relief, which is basically a regional relief aquitard. The underground water sources {{are considered to be}} precipitation on the massif (approximately 83 % of the total), infiltration of the surface (11 %), the condensation of water vapor in the aeration zone (5 %) and underground inflow from adjacent areas (1. 3 %). It is established to find connection (for topographical scale 1 : 50, 000) based on the heights of the distribution function analysis of modern and buried reliefs (composed by using paleorelief maps of scale 1 : 50, 000). The distribution of heights set size space between adjacent contour lines reliefs. It is created correlation relation between the buried and surface reliefs in different slopes and has been specified the ways of focused groundwater runoff and the possible locations of buried watersheds. Overall, the new data concerning the structure of the buried relief of Aragats massif and the distribution of its underground runoff allow to develop effective measures for the selection of underground waters and their rational usage for the purpose of water supply and irrigation...|$|E
40|$|Knobs, {{partially}} buried craters, ring fractures, {{and some}} mesas permit a qualitative {{determination of the}} <b>topography</b> <b>buried</b> beneath younger northern plains materials. These features are widely distributed in the Utopia area but are absent in a large, roughly circular region centered at about 48 deg N, 240 deg W. This implies {{the existence of a}} circular depression about 3300 km in diameter buried beneath Utopia Planitia that is interpreted to represent the central part of a very large impact basin. The presence of buried curved massifs around part of this depression, and a roughly coincident mascon, lend further support. Present topography, areal geology, and paleotopography of buried surfaces all point to the persistence of this major depression for almost the entire history of Mars...|$|R

Our procedure is an innovative hybrid of knowledge-driven and data-driven schemes that provides a clear protocol for incorporating different types of geophysical data into a 3 D stratigraphic model framework. The limited spatial density of water well bedrock observations precludes detection of the <b>buried</b> valley bedrock <b>topography</b> and renders the water well records alone inadequate for accurate hydrogeological model building.

40|$|Buried U-shaped troughs {{as much as}} 20 km-wide and flat-topped ridges {{adjacent}} to western Marie Byrd Land have recently been proposed {{as the result of}} late Oligocene West Antarctic glaciation.

The Red unconformity extends east-west 160 km near the ice shelf edge, and is 700 m-deep. Part of a 2 km section of Oligocene to middle Miocene strata was removed by erosion. Any smooth post-rift subsidence profile requires that the Red unconformity was carved in water depths of several hundred meters. Several early through middle Miocene glacial erosion surfaces merge to form this unconformity, suggesting multiple advances of thick grounded ice...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with related aspects of physical and settlement changes in the coastal portion of the largest lowland in peninsular Italy, the Tavoliere of Poggia (Apulia). It is an empirical study, summarising the state of archaeological and geographical information, offering new archaeological and sedimentary evidence, and reassessing many interpretations concerning settlement, economic activity and the environment from the mid-Holocene and Early Neolithic times to the present. Formerly {{there were a number}} of lagoons in the coastlands, wide open to the Adriatic or almost wholly closed by the barrier island. Today much of this is cultivated land. Before the implications of such a physical change on past settlement and economy can be assessed, the ancient settlement patterns have to be discovered; the <b>buried</b> <b>topography</b> revealed; and the nature and phasing of the sedimentation that has all but obliterated the lagoons outlined. These are the main objectives in the present study. A perhaps wider range of source material than is orthodox in historical geography is investigated to these ends. The study of written and cartographic sources, from the Roman period onward, is intimately combined with the study of field evidence both archaeological and sedimentary. In this way, much of the evidence falls in to place as a better understanding of the former physical environment is achieved. For instance, cognizance of the openness of one lagoon leads to a more accurate interpretation of the route directions of the Roman itineraria and a better coincidence of archaeological and written evidences for lost settlements. But, bearing in mind that the thesis is essentially an interim statement on an active and longterm research programme, no conclusions are attempted although the study has implications reaching beyond the local area. Instead, the three important factors of change - climatic change, changes in sea level, and the anthropogenic factor - are introduced as the basis of the next stage in the research programme. </p...|$|E
40|$|Bibliography: pages 295 - 307. The {{exposures}} in diamond mines on the Namaqualand {{west coast}} of South Africa provide {{a rare opportunity to}} examine a record that is normally inaccessible beneath a thick cover of aeolian sands. This study presents the main results of fieldwork in mine excavations on the farms Hondeklip and Avontuur-A, near Hondeklip Bay. Sections in the deposits were described in detail and the vertebrate and invertebrate faunas were sampled. The <b>buried</b> <b>topography</b> of the gneiss bedrock, obtained by prospecting, is complex, with the main feature consisting of a coast-parallel ridge flanking a wide palaeochannel on its landward side. Advanced kaolinitic weathering affected both the bedrock and a diamondiferous, basal kaolinitic sediment patchily preserved in the channel. The incision of the channel is related to the Oligocene regression and the basal kaolinitic sediment is interpreted as a fluvial arkose deposited in the channel. Both the bedrock and the deposit in the channel were then kaolinized during humid climatic conditions in the late Oligocene and early Miocene. Weathering-profile silcrete also developed in the basal kaolinitic sediment. It is tentatively proposed that this weathering period may be represented in the Namib Desert by the thick laterite capping Eocene sediments at Kakaoberg. Subsequently, the palaeochannel was exhumed and was ultimately filled by late Tertiary marine deposits. The marine deposits were laid down in shallowing-upwards sequences of the shore face environment. Two regressive, progradational packages (alloformations) are recognized. The older extends seawards from at least - 50 m asl. and is the " 45 - 50 m Complex" of Carrington and Kensley (1969), now called the 50 m Package. East of the channel, on the exposed coast, high-wave-energy storm-deposition in the lower shoreface dominates the preserved record. With lowering of sea-level, the bedrock ridge emerged to the seaward of the prograding palaeoshoreline, reduced the level of incident wave energy and profoundly influenced the development of sub-environments within the progradational regime. Ultimately, low-energy bay deposits filled the palaeochannel in the bedrock. On the basis of vertebrate evidence and correlation with global sea-level trends, the age of the 50 m Package is middle Pliocene. The upper facies of the 50 m Package (foreshore and upper shoreface) have been extensively removed by later subaerial erosion. The subsequent transgression truncated the seaward extent of the 50 m Package, reached ~ 30 m asl. and prograded seaward from that elevation. It is called the 30 m Package and combines the " 29 - 34 m Beach" and " 17 - 21 m Complex" of Carrington and Kensley (1969). A late Pliocene age is envisaged. The upper-shoreface facies of the 30 m Package is usually preserved, but may be disguised by pedogenesis. The diamondiferous marine gravels mined in the area are mainly lower-shoreface storm deposits and pre-existing transgressive lags and shelf deposits have generally been reworked during regression. Enigmatic, muddy and/or phosphatic units, previously called "E-stage," are patchily preserved in the base of the 50 m Package and are revealed to be distal storm deposits laid down in the transitional shoreface to offshore environment. They are part of the overlying regressive sequence, but may include a fragmentary, petrified, mixed, vertebrate remanie. Nevertheless, eroded remnants of older deposits must also occur in places...|$|E
25|$|Smooth plains {{material}} (unit ps) {{forms the}} vast expanses of Borealis and Suisei Planitiae, {{as well as}} most basin and crater floors. It is the most extensive stratigraphic unit in the Borealis region, covering 30 percent of the mapped area. The surface of the smooth plains material is rather sparsely cratered compared to that of the intercrater plains material. Wrinkle ridges are common. Both the floor of the Goethe Basin and the younger craters (now observed as buried craters) superposed on it are mantled by smooth plains material; the unit also fills ghost and flooded craters that are common on both Borealis and Suisei Planitiae and resemble the lunar crater Archimedes. The enormous volume of smooth plains material that must underlie Borealis Planitia in order to <b>bury</b> pre-existing <b>topography,</b> as well as the presence of the material in basin and crater floors, suggest that the smooth plains material was emplaced in a fluidized state as volcanic lava flows (Murray and others, 1974). Even though flow fronts cannot be unambiguously mapped on Borealis Planitia, further evidence of the unit's volcanic origin is supplied by its overlap onto intercrater plains material, best observed along the west edge of Borealis Planitia (FDS 85, 152, 153, 156, and 160). The various types of plains material recognized on Mercury exhibit little tonal contrast. The albedo of smooth plains material is higher than that of lunar mare material (Hapke and others, 1975). The similarity in albedo between mercurian smooth plains material and lunar light plains material led Wilhelms to extend the analogy to composition: he suggested that both units consist of impact ejecta similar to the lunar Cayley Formation sampled by Apollo 16. Wilhelms even hypothesized that the source basin for material of the extensive plains of Borealis Planitia “could well be lurking in the darkness beyond the terminator.” A fuller discussion of the problem is given by Strom.|$|R
40|$|In {{a marine}} environment, {{topographic}} {{features on the}} sea floor will usually be covered by {{a thick layer of}} shale with the rise of sea level, resulting in a uniform, nearly flat surface. Evaporating seas may <b>bury</b> sea floor <b>topography</b> with a thick layer of salt. In a fluvial-deltaic environment, channels are cut and filled with a lithology that may be different from that through which it is cut, followed by subsequent burial with (perhaps) a more uniform sedimentary layer, With continued burial and overburden, pore sizes are reduced and water is squeezed out of the rocks, reducing the rock volume. Different lithologies have different original porosity, pore shapes, and mineral matrix composition, and thus different response to burial. Lateral changes in lithology give rise to lateral changes in compaction, or simply “differential compaction”. For this reason, easily-mapped flooding and other surfaces that were originally flat can exhibit measureable, and often significant structural relief. These maps give rise to lateral “structural ” anomalies. Recognition of differential compaction forms a key component in modern seismic geomorphology based interpretation workflows with excellent publications showing the expression of differential compaction on vertical slices. Mapping the 3 D expression of compaction features takes considerable time and is thus less well reported and the use of 3 D geometric attributes to map compaction features is underutilized. In this paper we illustrate the attribute expression of the more common differential compaction features over channels and carbonate reefs using examples from the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin...|$|R
40|$|International audienceNear-bottom {{magnetic}} measurements on board submersible Nautile {{were carried out}} on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge 21 degrees 40 'N segment, and deep-sea geomagnetic vector anomalies along 19 dive tracks were obtained by applying the processing method for shipboard three-component magnetometer data. A forward modeling technique using short-wavelength components of the anomalies arising from local topography and vertical motion of the submersible was designed to estimate the absolute magnetization intensity of the seafloor. In {{the vicinity of the}} spreading axis a considerable number of magnetization estimations are reliably confirmed by the high correlation between observed and modeled anomalies, whereas less reliable estimations are obtained off-axis, probably because the sediment <b>buries</b> the basement <b>topography.</b> The natural remanent magnetization (NRM) measured on basalt samples collected during these dives is compared with the magnetization from anomalies. Though both results give a similar range of magnetization intensity, no correlation is confirmed between them, possibly because the magnetization from anomalies represents laterally averaged seafloor magnetization, whereas the NRM has variations at the scale of individual pillow or lava pile. Equivalent magnetization inverted from the sea-surface magnetic anomalies shows axial magnetization increases significantly from the segment center to the segment ends. However, the results of eight dives conducted near the spreading axis at different locations along the segment show much less variation in magnetization intensity along the axis. We ascribe the high equivalent magnetization at segment ends to preferential serpentinization of peridotite near the segment ends and the associated formation of magnetite. The results of three across-axis transects composed of 15 dives running in the spreading direction can be consistently interpreted as recording geomagnetic paleointensity variations during the Brunhes epoch. Although magnetization lows are generally correspondent to periods of low paleointensity, they show deeper drop than predicted from the paleointensity variation...|$|R
