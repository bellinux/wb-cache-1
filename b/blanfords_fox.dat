50|$|DNA {{analysis}} {{shows that the}} first three form monophyletic clades. The wolf-like canids and the South American canids together form the tribe Canini. Molecular data imply a North American origin of living Canidae some ten million years ago and an African origin of wolf-like canines (Canis, Cuon, and Lycaon), with the jackals being the most basal of this group. The South American clade is rooted by the maned wolf and bush dog, and the fox-like canids by the fennec fox and <b>Blanfords</b> <b>fox.</b> The grey fox and island fox are basal to the other clades; however, this topological difference is not strongly supported.|$|E

40|$|A {{survey of}} the <b>Blanford's</b> <b>fox</b> was {{established}} in Jabal Masuda (Southern Jordan), to increase the knowledge of its density. Live-trapping method was used and capture mark-recapture technique was applied. We captured a total of 27 specimens including nine re-captured specimens. Density was determined using two methods: the Bondrup-Nielsen formula which identified 8. 5 individuals per km², and the ArcGIS tools which showed values, between 0. 177 to 9 individuals per km². This paper {{is the first to}} give measured information on the <b>Blanford's</b> <b>fox</b> density in Jordan. As well, it showed that ArcGIS 9. 3 Spatial Analyst Extension is an effective tool in establishing information on density in large spatial areas.

50|$|<b>Blanford's</b> <b>fox</b> dwells {{in section}} of the Middle East {{including}} Afghanistan, Egypt, Turkestan, Iran, Pakistan, and Israel. This species prefers semiarid environments.|$|R
50|$|The {{fennec fox}} {{lives in the}} northernmost {{sections}} of Africa. It was not previously within Vulpes, but genetic evidence shows its close relation with <b>Blanford's</b> <b>fox,</b> making it a true fox.|$|R
5000|$|Omnivorous, {{and more}} frugivorous than other foxes. It prefers {{seedless}} grapes, ripe melons and Russian chives when consuming domestic crops. In addition, it eats insects.

40|$|We {{measured}} basal {{metabolic rate}} (BMR) and total evaporative water loss (TEWL) of species of foxes that exist on the Arabian Peninsula, <b>Blanford's</b> <b>fox</b> (Vulpes cana) and two subspecies of Red fox (Vulpes vulpes). Combining these data with that on other canids from the literature, we searched for specialization of physiological traits among desert foxes using both conventional least squares regression and regressions based on phylogenetic independent contrasts. Further, we explored the consequences of reduced body size of foxes on life history parameters such as litter size and neonate mass. For <b>Blanford's</b> <b>foxes,</b> Red foxes from the central desert of Arabia, and Red foxes from the more mesic Asir mountains, body mass averaged 1, 285 +/- 52 g, 1, 967 +/- 289 g, and 3, 060 +/- 482 g, respectively, whereas mean BMR, during summer, was 304. 5 +/- 32. 3 kJ/day, 418. 0 +/- 32. 4 kJ/day, and 724. 1 +/- 120. 2 kJ/day (+/-SD). An analysis of covariance with body mass as a covariate showed no statistical differences in BMR among foxes. Analysis of covariance indicated that Red fox from the Asir mountains had a higher TEWL than Red foxes from central Arabia or than <b>Blanford's</b> <b>foxes</b> also from the mountains. Comparisons of all species of desert and mesic foxes showed {{no significant differences in}} BMR, nor did desert foxes have a significantly lower BMR than other carnivores. TEWL of desert foxes was lower than other more mesic carnivores; deviations in TEWL ranged from - 17. 7 % for the Fennec fox (Fennecus zerda) to - 57. 4 % for the Kit fox (Vulpes velox). Although desert foxes have a BMR comparable to other more mesic species, it appears that desert foxes do have a smaller body mass, lowering overall energy requirements. We attribute this reduction in body size to the "resource limitation hypothesis" whereby natural selection favors smaller individuals in a resource-limited environment, especially during periods of severe food shortage. However, until common garden experiments are performed, developmental plasticity and acclimation cannot be ruled out as contributors to this pattern...|$|R
50|$|<b>Blanford's</b> <b>fox</b> inhabits {{semiarid}} regions, steppes, {{and mountains}} of Afghanistan, Egypt (Sinai), Turkestan, northeast Iran, southwest Pakistan, the West Bank, and Israel. It may also live throughout Arabia (Oman, Yemen, and Jordan), as one {{was trapped in}} Dhofar, Oman in 1984. Recent camera trapping surveys have confirmed {{the presence of the}} species in several places in the mountains of South Sinai, Egypt and the mountains of Ras Al Khaimah, UAE, and in Saudi Arabia.|$|R
50|$|Like all desert <b>foxes,</b> the <b>Blanford's</b> <b>fox</b> has large ears {{which enables}} it to {{dissipate}} heat. However, unlike other desert foxes, {{it does not}} have pads covered with hair, which would otherwise protect its paws from hot sand. Its tail is almost equal in length to its body. Its coat is light tan, with white underparts and a black tip on the tail. Among all extant canids, only the fennec fox is smaller than Blanford's.|$|R
50|$|Mammals like Asiatic cheetahs, Persian leopard, caracal, wild goat, jebeer gazelle, wild sheep, mouflon, ibex, <b>Blanford's</b> <b>fox,</b> Rüppell's fox, {{and exotic}} and {{valuable}} birds like bustard, cuckoo, Pleske's ground jay, and other birds such as partridge, crao, hoopoe, lark, horned lark, {{different types of}} owls, eagles, vultures. Reptilians include the Jafari snake, viper, camel snake, asp, horned asp, gecko and lizard. Rodents include rats and porcupines. Insect-eaters include the hedgehog and bat.|$|R
5000|$|The red fox, Ruppell's fox, and Tibetan sand fox [...] possess white-tipped tails. The Arctic fox's tail-tip is of {{the same}} color {{as the rest of the}} tail (white or blue-gray) <b>Blanford's</b> <b>fox</b> usually {{possesses}} a black-tipped tail, but a small number of specimens (2% in Israel, 24% in the United Arab Emirates) possess a light-tipped tail. The other foxes in this group (Bengal, Cape, corsac, fennec, kit, pale, and swift) all possess black-tipped or dark-tipped tails.|$|R
5000|$|While the IUCN has {{downgraded}} <b>Blanford's</b> <b>fox</b> to [...] "least concern" [...] as more {{has been}} learned about the breadth of its distribution across the Middle East, very {{little is known about}} this species and its vulnerabilities to the diseases of domesticated dogs that have so badly affected other canids. Currently, little competition exists with humans for habitat, and the fox is a protected species in Israel and protected from hunting in Oman and Yemen. Some fur hunting occurs in Afghanistan, and occasionally they may take poison intended for hyenas and other species.|$|R

25|$|The Eastern Desert has a quite {{different}} range of fauna and has {{much in common with}} the Sinai Peninsula, showing the importance of the broad Nile in separating the two desert regions. Here are found the striped hyena, Nubian ibex, bushy-tailed jird, golden spiny mouse, <b>Blanford's</b> <b>fox</b> and Rüppell's fox. The sand partridge, streaked scrub warbler, mourning wheatear and white-crowned wheatear are typical of this region. The high rocky mountains of Gebel Elba in the south have a distinctive range of animals including the aardwolf, striped polecat, and common genet, and there may still be African wild ass in this area.|$|R
50|$|The hamadryas baboon {{is present}} in parts of Yemen, and the {{critically}} endangered Arabian leopard is found only on the Arabian peninsula and there {{are believed to be}} about seventy individuals remaining in the wild in Yemen. A captive breeding programme is being undertaken at Taiz Zoo in the Yemeni Highlands. Other mammals found in Yemen include the mountain gazelle, gray wolf, <b>Blanford's</b> <b>fox,</b> Rüppell's fox, caracal, sand cat, wildcat, common genet, striped hyena, golden jackal, honey badger, bushy-tailed mongoose, rock hyrax, desert hedgehog, Arabian shrew, golden spiny mouse, lesser Egyptian jerboa, several species of gerbils, king jird, Yemeni mouse and a number of species of bat.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the last}} places in which the Arabian leopard survives is the {{mountains}} in southern Oman, and the Jabal Samhan Nature Reserve {{has been set up}} to protect these critically endangered big cats. Other carnivores present in the reserve include the striped hyena, <b>Blanford's</b> <b>fox</b> and Arabian wildcat. [...] The central section of Oman has vast stretches of gravelly desert with very little vegetation. The Arabian Oryx Sanctuary was set up here to aid in the conservation of the Arabian oryx, and it is also a refuge for the sand gazelle, the mountain gazelle, the Nubian ibex, the honey badger, the red fox, the caracal, the sand cat and the Arabian wildcat.|$|R
50|$|Many of {{the large}} mammals found in the Arabian Peninsula were well-adapted to desert life in the harsh terrain, but were wiped out by human hunting in {{the last hundred years}} or so. Hunting is now banned in the United Arab Emirates, but feral goats and donkeys are {{plentiful}} and graze indiscriminately, lessening the chance for the native gazelles to recover from their reduced population sizes. Large terrestrial mammals still found in the United Arab Emirates include the Arabian tahr, the Arabian oryx, the sand gazelle and the mountain gazelle. Carnivores include the Arabian wolf, the striped hyena, the red <b>fox,</b> the <b>Blanford's</b> <b>fox,</b> the Rüppell's fox, the caracal, the Arabian wildcat, the sand cat and the Arabian leopard. Other mammals include the Cape hare, the Brandt's hedgehog, the desert hedgehog and the long-eared hedgehog.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{investigated}} {{the responses of}} common and golden spiny mice (Acomys cahirinus and A. russatus, respectively) to the fecal odor of <b>Blanford’s</b> <b>fox</b> (Vulpes cana), a predator of Acomys, which overlaps in habitat use with the mice. Neither species of mouse showed a significant response {{to the presence of}} fox odor compared with the presence of the fecal odor of a local herbivore (Nubian ibex, Capra ibex nubia). One explanation is that the impact of predation from V. cana may be sufficiently low that the cost of avoidance, in terms of missed feeding opportunities, conveys little selective advantage. Alternatively, fecal odor may not provide a focused cue of immediate danger for spiny mice. The diurnal A. russatus showed a stronger (near significant) response than the nocturnal A. cahirinus to fecal odor of this nocturnal predator. This may be a legacy of the underlying nocturnal activity rhythm of A. russatus or may indicate a generally more cautious response to predator odors, as A. russatus has a much stronger preference for sheltered microhabitats than A. cahirinus...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{behavioural}} {{ecology of}} wild mammals in rabies epizootics {{is a prerequisite}} to scientifically sound management of the disease. The principal vectors of wildlife rabies in a region tend to be abundant representatives of the Carnivora. Although the population dynamics of these species may be radically affected by rabies, and by attempts to control it, they are generally not threatened with widespread extinction as a result. However, the cases of the <b>Blanford's</b> <b>fox,</b> Vulpes cana, the Ethiopian wolf, Canis simensis, and the African wild dog, Lycaon pictus, illustrate how rabies and its control can pose grave conservation problems for rare carnivores. Disease monitoring is therefore {{an important element of}} recovery plans for rare species which are potential victims of rabies and other epizootic pathogens, and the benefits and disbenefits of prophylactic vaccination merit serious evaluationThe articles have been scanned in colour with a HP Scanjet 5590; 600 dpi.

50|$|While the {{southern}} {{slopes of the}} Alborz Mountains are usually semiarid or arid with irregular and low precipitation, the northern slopes of the range are usually humid especially in the western parts of the Central Alborz. In {{the southern}} slopes or the Elburz Range forest steppe ecoregion, the higher elevations are arid with few trees. Juniper {{is the most common}} tree in the inaccessible areas and high elevations, while shrubs are pistachio, maple, and almond. But in the northern slopes, the Caspian Hyrcanian mixed forests ecoregion is lush and forested. The natural vegetation of this region grows in distinct zones: the Hyrcanian forests on the lowest levels; beech forests in the middle zone; and oak forests in higher regions. The wild cypress is the dominant form of vegetation in some valleys, while olive trees grow in the western valleys of the Central Alborz near the Sefidrud. The bezoar ibex, <b>Blanford's</b> <b>fox,</b> Rüppell's fox, red fox, Persian fallow deer, wild boar, Syrian brown bear, Persian leopard, Indian wolf, buzzard, goose, woodpecker, griffon vulture, and eagle are among important animals and birds found in the Alborz Mountains. The extinct Caspian tiger also lived in the Alborz Mountains.|$|R
500|$|Red foxes {{typically}} dominate other fox species. Arctic foxes generally escape {{competition from}} red foxes by living farther north, where food is too scarce {{to support the}} larger-bodied red species. Although the red species' northern limit {{is linked to the}} availability of food, the Arctic species' southern range is limited by the presence of the former. Red and Arctic foxes were both introduced to almost every island from the Aleutian Islands to the Alexander Archipelago during the 1830s–1930s by fur companies. The red foxes invariably displaced the Arctic foxes, with one male red fox having been reported to have killed off all resident Arctic foxes on a small island in 1866. Where they are sympatric, Arctic foxes may also escape competition by feeding on lemmings and flotsam, rather than voles, as favoured by red foxes. Both species will kill each other's kits, given the opportunity. Red foxes are serious competitors of corsac foxes, as they hunt the same prey all year. The red species is also stronger, is better adapted to hunting in snow deeper than [...] and is more effective in hunting and catching medium to large-sized rodents. Corsac foxes seem to only outcompete red foxes in semi-desert and steppe areas. In Israel, <b>Blanford's</b> <b>foxes</b> escape competition with red foxes by restricting themselves to rocky cliffs and actively avoiding the open plains inhabited by red foxes. Red foxes dominate kit and swift foxes. Kit foxes usually avoid competition with their larger cousins by living in more arid environments, though red foxes have been increasing in ranges formerly occupied by kit foxes due to human-induced environmental changes. Red foxes will kill both species, and compete for food and den sites. Grey foxes are exceptional, as they dominate red foxes wherever their ranges meet. Historically, interactions between the two species were rare, as grey foxes favoured heavily wooded or semiarid habitats as opposed to the open and mesic ones preferred by red foxes. However, interactions have become more frequent due to deforestation allowing red foxes to colonise grey fox-inhabited areas.|$|R
