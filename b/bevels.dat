25|$|Shinogi: This is {{the most}} common type of blade {{geometry}} for long swords, but tantō made in this form are very rare, usually created from cut-down blades when a longer sword has been broken. Shinogi means the central ridge that runs along the length of the blade between the edge <b>bevels</b> and the body of the blade.|$|E
25|$|Hira: A {{very common}} tantō form with no shinogi, the edge <b>bevels</b> {{reaching}} {{all the way}} from the edge (ha) to the back (mune) with no separate flats in between, creating an almost triangular cross-section (the back is ridged, as on most other blade forms, so the cross-section is actually an extremely asymmetrical diamond shape; on shinogi zukuri blades it is hexagonal). It is extremely common due to the simplicity of its design.|$|E

2500|$|The regular {{use of a}} bit {{to control}} a horse can create wear facets or <b>bevels</b> on the {{anterior}} corners of the lower second premolars. The corners of the horse's mouth normally keep the bit on the [...] "bars" [...] of the mouth, an interdental space {{where there are no}} teeth, forward of the premolars. The bit must be manipulated by a human or the horse must move it with its tongue for it to touch the teeth. Wear can be caused by the bit abrading the front corners of the premolars if the horse grasps and releases the bit between its teeth; other wear can be created by the bit striking the vertical front edge of the lower premolars, due to very strong pressure from a human handler.|$|E

The use of <b>bevel</b> gears allows the axis of the drive torque from the pedals to be turned through 90 degrees.

5000|$|The first {{signature}} model {{since the}} Y2KV, the Demmelition King V is the signature model of guitarist Phil Demmel of Machine Head. Demmelition King Vs however are not built like traditional King Vs, {{as they have}} two cutaways in each wing on the guitar (used to only be available as custom shop option only). The guitar has an alder body, a maple neck, a 24 fret ebony fretboard with mother of pearl sharkfin inlays, an original Floyd Rose tremolo, EMG 81 active pickup at the bridge and an EMG 60 active pickup at the neck. The Demmelition King V is also factory tuned to Drop B tuning, the same tuning Demmel uses on most Machine Head songs (some are in C# Standard, such as Aesthetics of Hate). It is available in five color schemes (black with silver <b>bevels,</b> white with black <b>bevels,</b> red with black <b>bevels,</b> gold with black <b>bevels</b> and black with white polka dots).|$|E

A square shape would hurt the hand, while a round shape would not give enough friction to gain a firm grip. The eight sides of the handle are called <b>bevels.</b> We can number the <b>bevels</b> from 1 to 8 as follows: if the blade of the racquet is perpendicular to the ground, the bevel facing up is bevel #1. Rotating the racquet counter-clockwise (for a right handed player, clockwise for a left handed player), the next bevel facing up is bevel #2, if you are right-handed, and clockwise if you are left-handed, and so on to identify all 8 <b>bevels.</b>|$|E
