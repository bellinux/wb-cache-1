40|$|Abstract. Magnetic {{flux leakage}} (MFL) is a {{non-destructive}} testing method used to inspect ferrous materials. However, {{there are a}} variety of factors that can affect the MFL inspection tool’s ability to detect and characterize anomalies. An orthogonal experimental design (OED) method is applied to study the effects of apparatus parameters on MFL signals. Integration of OED method of analysis into a routine sample preparation technique could improve the repeatability and quantization capabilities of MFL tools. Three key apparatus parameters, namely permanent magnet (PM) height, magnetic concentrator (MC) length and <b>backing</b> <b>iron</b> (BI) length are chosen for the present study. The importance of each of these key parameters on MFL signals for different defects is determined by a series of experiments...|$|E
40|$|Linear {{synchronous}} motors can be {{used for}} large scale electromagnetic launch. The machines are short time rated and can therefore use substantial values of stator current loading. This leads to high values of armature flux and the risk of demagnetising the excitation magnets. In order to mitigate this risk by reducing the armature flux, quadrature axis flux barriers can be positioned in the permanent magnet <b>backing</b> <b>iron.</b> These reduce the armature field but leave the permanent magnet excitation field largely unchanged. In addition to improving the force due to the larger usable stator current loading, the barriers are beneficial in reducing the synchronous reactance and hence improving the power factor and reducing the Volt Amps per Newton of useful force (VA/N) of a linear motor. The paper explores the use of these barriers for a typical configuration and shows the performance improvements that can be obtained...|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes an {{approach}} to systematically find the optimal geometry of electromagnetic energy harvesters through topology optimization. The energy harvesters designed herein have a pickup coil and permanent magnets (PMs) integrated with a magnetic <b>back</b> <b>iron,</b> completing a closed-loop magnetic circuit. The configuration and geometries of the PMs and <b>back</b> <b>iron</b> are simultaneously determined using topology optimization. The optimization goal is to maximize the root-mean-square (rms) value of the harvested output voltage, which {{is calculated based on}} the Lagrange polynomial interpolation with finite-element analysis. The sensitivity needed to solve the optimization problems is obtained using the adjoint variable method. The proposed optimization approach successfully determines the optimal design of the PMs and <b>back</b> <b>irons.</b> The optimized design consists of two PM pieces with opposite magnetization directions (to rapidly alternate the magnetic field direction) and shaped <b>back</b> <b>irons</b> (to minimize the magnetic reluctance). The optimized design significantly improves the electromagnetic performance of harvesters (a 42. 5 x increase in the rms output voltage with decreases in the volumes of the PM and iron), compared with an initial benchmark design determined through intuition.

By using Fourier decomposition, the magnetization components of four typical Halbach magnet arrays are determined.

40|$|Problem Statement: Axial flux {{permanent}} magnet machines {{are regarded as}} compact high efficiency generators for micro-turbines employed in the distributed power generation systems. High-speed rotor of the generator causes some designing and modeling problems. Sensitivity analysis tasks of the machine parameters are difficult and completely different {{in comparison with the}} problems associated with conventional machines. Approach: This article presents a modeling procedure with some details for performance predictions of High-Speed Axial Flux Generator (HSAFG). The FEM results are employed to validate the proposed model. Proper values of inner diameter to outer diameter ratio, plus <b>back</b> <b>iron</b> thickness of two rotor discs located in two ends are serious design problem for a HSAFG. Results: Impacts of these two parameters on the performance characteristics of a HSAFG are investigated in this paper. Their optimum values are determined for the machine by somewhat precise considerations of the output voltage and efficiency. Conclusions/Recommendations: It has been found out that the optimum performance of HSAFG regarding the voltage and efficiency is achieved by the value of inner to outer diameter ratio sited between 0. 5 - 0. 65. Moreover, the thickness of the rotor <b>back</b> <b>iron</b> can be designed by trial method to produce sufficient air gap flux and resultant terminal voltage.

40|$|The {{ever-increasing}} {{necessity to}} miniaturize smooth torque rotary actuators has placed severe {{constraints on the}} current slotless permanent-magnet technology. These constraints are mainly the consequence of the relatively large effective magnetic airgap which limits the achievable magnetic loading and, therefore, the torque density of slotless permanent-magnet rotary actuators. Further, the miniaturization has to be achieved at ever-decreasing costs and, therefore, it would be advantageous to implement solid <b>back</b> <b>irons.</b> However this, even at reduced magnetic loading, still results in considerable eddy-current losses. Therefore, a careful selection of the various actuator dimensions and most appropriate soft magnetic laminated or solid material {{is a prerequisite for}} applications that require smooth speed and torque characteristic.

40|$|Though {{the hybrid}} {{stepping}} motor {{has a long}} and proven history, in terms of toughness, accuracy of position {{and the ability to}} operate in open loop, motor performance improvements can still be made in terms of the physical structure of the motor's components. It is impossible to build a complete solution of the hybrid stepping motor using simple analytical functions or equivalent circuit representations. This is due to the difficulties introduced by the motor's highly non-linear three dimensional magnetic structure, of which the doubly salient tooth structure, axial magnet, and <b>back</b> <b>iron</b> all complicate the situation. However, with the recent advances in three dimensional finite element software a comprehensive study of the motor has been achieved in this thesis. This has allowed improvements to simpler two dimensional based mathematical models, which allow faster computation of the motor's electromagnetic performance. To aid modelling, novel equations which accurately model today's high permeability steels have been developed. These are shown to be more accurate than the established Jiles-Atherton method. Inductance calculations of the steel's flux paths have been comprehensively improved by the use of elliptical functions. The thesis concludes with the design of two quite individual new machines. The first dramatically improves a motor's power output, smoothness, noise levels, and resonance by modifying the tooth structure. The second uses soft magnetic composite materials to provide an isotropic path for cross lamination flux which flows in a stator's <b>back</b> <b>iron.</b> Both new designs are shown to offer a significant improvements to the high speed torque capability of the hybrid stepping motor...|$|R
