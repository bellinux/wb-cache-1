40|$|Abstract. Similar blast loading {{characteristics}} can {{be obtained}} using impact of aluminium foam projectiles, which enables blast tests to be mimicked in a laboratory scale and in a safer environment. The {{purpose of this study}} is to determine the <b>back-face</b> deflection history of aluminium sandwich panels experimentally by aids of a laser displacement meter when panels are subjected to the impact of metal foam projectiles. This information was usually determined using finite element analysis (FEA) due to the difficulty in the experiment. The projectiles are cylindrical ALPORAS aluminium foam with diameter of 37 mm, length of 50 mm and nominal relative density of 10 %. The sandwich panels consist of two 1 mm aluminium face-sheets and an aluminium honeycomb as the core. There are five different core configurations with a brand name of HEXCEL. The projectiles are fired towards the centre of the sandwich panels at different velocities using a gas gun. During the tests, a laser optical displacement measuring device is used to record the history of the <b>back-face</b> deflection experimentally. The deflection of the <b>back-face</b> is found to reach the maximum before coming to rest at a smaller value. The final <b>back-face</b> deflections of the sandwich panels show exponential relationship with the projectile impulse. The final deflections are compared with the deflection of monolithic plates with equal mass. The sandwich panels deflect less than the monolithic plate with an equal mass up to a critical value but continue to increase significantly afterwards. Care should be taken when using sandwich panels as protective structures against foam projectiles as beyond this point, the monolithic plates outperform the sandwich panels in absorbing the impact load...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMotivated {{by recent}} efforts to {{mitigate}} blast loading using energy-absorbing materials, this paper uses analytical and computational modeling {{to investigate the}} influence of mass distribution on the uniaxial crushing of cellular sandwich plates under air blast loading. In the analytical model, the cellular core is represented using a rigid, perfectly-plastic, locking idealization, as in previous studies, and {{the front and back}} faces are modeled as rigid, with pressure loading applied to the front face and the <b>back-face</b> unrestrained. This model is also applicable to the crushing of cellular media in “blast pendulum” experiments. Fluid–structure interaction effects are treated using a recent result that accounts for nonlinear compressibility effects for intense air blasts. Predictions of the analytical model show excellent agreement with explicit finite element computations, and the model is used to investigate the response of the system for all possible distributions of mass between the front and back faces and the cellular core. Increasing the mass fraction in the front face is found to increase the impulse required for complete crushing of the cellular core but also to produce undesirable increases in <b>back-face</b> accelerations. Optimal mass distributions for mitigating shock transmission through the sandwich plate are investigated by maximizing the impulse capacity while limiting the <b>back-face</b> accelerations to a specified level...|$|R

40|$|Aluminium {{honeycomb}} sandwich panels have potential applications as a protective mechanism {{that can be}} used to prevent failure of an important structure subjected to impact loading. Therefore it is important to fully understand the resistance of the sandwich panels subjected to impact loading conditions. The main objective of this work was to study the resistance of sandwich panels with different aluminium honeycomb cores, air sandwich panels (no core between the two face sheets) and monolithic plates of equivalent mass subjected to impact from foam projectiles. The deformation and the elastic spring-back of the {{honeycomb sandwich}} panels and the monolithic plates have been compared and discussed. The resistance of the panels and plates has been quantified by their <b>back-face</b> deflection with respect to the projectile impulse. Five different types of aluminium honeycombs have been used as the core material. The front-face sheet and the <b>back-face</b> sheet of the honeycomb sandwich panels are made of aluminium plate with 1 mm thickness. Cylindrical ALPORAS aluminium foams with a relative density between 9 % and 11 % are employed as the metal foam projectiles. They are fired at several hundred metres per second towards the centre of the panels and plates using a gas gun. The deflection histories of the <b>back-face</b> have been measured using a laser displacement sensor. From the deflection histories, the maximum deflection and the final deflection of the <b>back-face</b> can be distinguished. Deformation modes and failure modes of the individual component have been observed and classified into several categories. Moreover, the deflections of the honeycomb sandwich panels have been compared with deflections from air sandwich panels. It is found that the honeycomb sandwich panels outperform both the air sandwich panels and the monolithic plates within an impulse range of 2. 25 kNsm(- 2) similar to 4. 70 kNsm(- 2). Outside this operational range, the advantages associated with employing the honeycomb sandwich panels as a protective structure upon impact of foam projectiles diminishes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

5000|$|Black [...] "ink" [...] {{outlines}} and {{contour lines}} {{can be created}} {{using a variety of}} methods. One popular method is to first render a black outline, slightly larger than the object itself. Backface culling is inverted and the <b>back-facing</b> triangles are drawn in black. To dilate the silhouette, these back faces may be drawn in wireframe multiple times with slight changes in translation. Alternatively, back-faces may be rendered solid-filled, with their vertices translated along their vertex normals in a vertex shader. After drawing the outline, back-face culling is set back to normal to draw the shading and optional textures of the object. Finally, the image is composited via Z-buffering, as the back-faces always lie deeper in the scene than the front-faces. The result is that the object is drawn with a black outline and interior contour lines.

40|$|The {{influence}} of specimen <b>back-face</b> boundary on {{the shape and}} size of the crack-tip fracture process zone during crack growth is related to the fracture energy distribution along the crack path. The governing mechanism responsible for the size effect on the specific fracture energy of concrete is the height variation of the crack-tip fracture process zone. Such a height variation exists in the boundary zone where the development of the crack-tip fracture process zone is limited due to the confined space and sharp stress gradient. The reduction in the fracture process zone height leads to a decreasing specific fracture energy distribution along the crack path in the <b>back-face</b> boundary region. The adhesive thickness effect on the critical energy release rate of the adhesive joint sandwiched between two non-yielding substrates and the un-cracked ligament effect on the large scale yielding of polymers and metals provide further proof to the relationship between the height variation of the crack-tip plastic zone and the specific fracture energy...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental and numerical {{investigation into the}} dynamic response of 3 D orthogonal woven carbon composites undergoing soft impact. Composite beams of two different fibre architectures, varying only by the density of through-thickness reinforcement, were centrally impacted by metallic foam projectiles. Using high speed photography, the centre-point <b>back-face</b> deflection was measured {{as a function of}} projectile impulse. Qualitative comparisons are made with a similar uni-directional laminate material. No visible delamination occurred in orthogonal 3 D woven samples, and beam failure was caused by tensile fibre fracture at the gripped ends. This contrasts with uni-direction carbon fibre laminates, which exhibit a combination of wide-spread delamination and tensile fracture. Post-impact clamped-clamped beam bending tests were undertaken across the range of impact velocities tested in order to investigate any internal damage within the material. Increasing impact velocity caused a reduction of beam stiffness: this phenomenon was more pronounced in composites with a higher density of through-thickness reinforcement. A three-dimensional finite element modelling strategy is presented and validated, showing excellent agreement with the experiment in terms of <b>back-face</b> deflection and damage mechanisms. The numerical analyses confirm negligible influence from though-thickness reinforcement in regards to <b>back-face</b> deflection, but significant reductions in delamination damage propagation. Finite element modelling was used to demonstrate the significant structural enhancements provided by the through-the-thickness weave. The contributions to the field made by this research include the characterisation of 3 D woven composite materials under high-speed soft impact, and the demonstration of how established finite element modelling methodologies {{can be applied to the}} simulation of orthogonal woven textile composite materials undergoing soft impact loading...|$|R
