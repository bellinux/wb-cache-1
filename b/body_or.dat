5|$|Abnormal genitalia: usually {{cryptorchidism}} (retention of testicles in <b>body)</b> <b>or</b> monorchism (single testicle). In female patients, this presents {{as missing}} or single ovaries, much harder by nature to detect.

5|$|Decapitation was the {{preferred}} method in German and western Slavic areas, {{with the head}} buried between the feet, behind the buttocks or away from the body.

5|$|Illegality {{is one of}} {{the three}} broad {{headings}} of judicial review of administrative action in Singapore, the others being irrationality and procedural impropriety.

5|$|Psilocybe pelliculosa {{is found}} in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States and Canada, where it grows on the ground in groups or {{clusters}} along trails or forest roads in coniferous woods. A single collection has also been reported from Finland. The mushrooms contain the psychedelic compounds psilocybin and baeocystin, although at relatively low concentrations. Several mushroom species that are similar in appearance to P.pelliculosa can be distinguished by subtle differences {{in the form of the}} fruit <b>body,</b> <b>or</b> by microscopic characteristics.|$|E

Two to four days before the rash occurs there may be tingling or local pain in the area.|$|E
5|$|The turtle starts its day at sunrise, {{emerging}} from the water to bask for several hours. Warmed for activity, it returns to the water to forage.

5|$|Where is {{the mind}} located? If {{the mind is}} a {{physical}} phenomenon of some kind, {{it has to be}} located somewhere. According to some, there are two possible options: either the mind is internal to the body (internalism) or the mind is external to it (externalism). More generally, either the mind depends only on events and properties taking place inside the subject's <b>body</b> <b>or</b> it depends also on factors external to it.|$|E

5|$|A {{pitch that}} is not hit into the field of play is called either a strike or a ball. A batter against whom three strikes are {{recorded}} strikes out. A batter against whom four balls are recorded is awarded a base on balls or walk, a free advance to first base. (A batter may also freely advance to first base if the batter's <b>body</b> <b>or</b> uniform is struck by a pitch outside the strike zone, provided the batter does not swing and attempts to avoid being hit.) Crucial to determining balls and strikes is the umpire's judgment as to whether a pitch has passed through the strike zone, a conceptual area above home plate extending from the midpoint between the batter's shoulders and belt down to the hollow of the knee.|$|E
5|$|A third {{possibility}} is {{the involvement of}} a third <b>body</b> <b>or</b> a type of impact disruption. More-recent lines of evidence for Phobos having a highly porous interior, and suggesting a composition containing mainly phyllosilicates and other minerals known from Mars, point toward an origin of Phobos from material ejected by an impact on Mars that reaccreted in Martian orbit, similar to the prevailing theory for the origin of Earth's moon. Although the VNIR spectra of the moons of Mars resemble those of outer-belt asteroids, the thermal infrared spectra of Phobos are reported to be inconsistent with chondrites of any class.|$|E
5|$|Accelerated {{deposition}} of cholesterol {{in the walls}} of arteries leads to atherosclerosis, the underlying cause of cardiovascular disease. The most common problem in FH {{is the development of}} coronary artery disease (atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries that supply the heart) at a much younger age than would be expected in the general population. This may lead to angina pectoris (chest pain or tightness on exertion) or heart attacks. Less commonly, arteries of the brain are affected; this may lead to transient ischemic attacks (brief episodes of weakness {{on one side of the}} <b>body</b> <b>or</b> inability to talk) or occasionally stroke. Peripheral artery occlusive disease (obstruction of the arteries of the legs) occurs mainly in people with FH who smoke; this can cause pain in the calf muscles during walking that resolves with rest (intermittent claudication) and problems due to a decreased blood supply to the feet (such as gangrene).|$|E
