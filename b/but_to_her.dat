5|$|For {{eight months}} over 1875–76, the Prince of Wales was absent from Britain {{on a tour}} of India, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> dismay Alexandra was left behind. The prince had planned an all-male group and {{intended}} to spend much of the time hunting and shooting. During the prince's tour, one of his friends who was travelling with him, Lord Aylesford, was told by his wife {{that she was going to}} leave him for another man: Lord Blandford, who was himself married. Aylesford was appalled and decided to seek a divorce. Meanwhile, Lord Blandford's brother, Lord Randolph Churchill, persuaded the lovers against an elopement. Now concerned by the threat of divorce, Lady Aylesford sought to dissuade her husband from proceeding but Lord Aylesford was adamant and refused to reconsider. In an attempt to pressure Lord Aylesford to drop his divorce suit, Lady Aylesford and Lord Randolph Churchill called on Alexandra and told her that if the divorce was to proceed they would subpoena her husband as a witness and implicate him in the scandal. Distressed at their threats, and following the advice of Sir William Knollys and the Duchess of Teck, Alexandra informed the queen, who then wrote to the Prince of Wales. The prince was incensed. Eventually, the Blandfords and the Aylesfords both separated privately. Although Lord Randolph Churchill later apologised, for years afterwards the Prince of Wales refused to speak to or see him.|$|E
25|$|In May 1568 Mary, Queen of Scots fled to England, {{and flung}} herself on Elizabeth's protection. She had found refuge in Carlisle Castle, and the {{delicate}} duty of {{taking charge of}} the fugitive was entrusted jointly to Knollys and to Henry Scrope, 9th Baron Scrope of Bolton. On 28 May Knollys arrived at the castle, and was admitted to Mary's presence. At his first interview he was conscious of Mary's powerful fascination. <b>But</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{requests for an interview}} with Elizabeth, and for help to regain her throne, he returned the evasive answers which Elizabeth's advisers had suggested to him, and he frankly drew her attention to the suspicions in which Darnley's murder involved her.|$|E

That same year she hit the stage with actor Morgan Freeman for Shakespeare in the Park's production of The Taming of the Shrew; she then made her Broadway debut with her one-woman show, The Big Love. She had no aspirations {{to return to the}} television. In 1991, she had given birth to her second child, Johnny, and her husband was bidding on a television franchise in the South of England. Along with the bid he included a potential television programming lineup. Listed was a Tracey Ullman special.

25|$|When Allen read Robert Daley's book, Prince of the City (1978), she was {{convinced}} it was a Sidney Lumet project, but the film rights had already been sold to Orion Pictures for Brian De Palma and David Rabe. Allen {{let it be known}} that if that deal should fall through, then she wanted the picture for Sidney. Just as Lumet was about to sign for a different picture, they got the call that Prince of the City was theirs. Allen hadn't wanted to write Prince of the City, just produce it. She was put off by the book's non-linear story structure, but Lumet wouldn't make the picture without her and agreed to write the outline for her. Lumet and Allen went over the book and agreed on what they could use and what they could do without. To her horror, Lumet would come in every day for weeks and scribble on legal pads. She was terrified that she would have to tell him that his stuff was unusable, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> delight the outline was wonderful and she went to work. It was her first project with living subjects, and Allen interviewed nearly everyone in the book and had endless hours of Bob Leuci's tapes for back-up. With all her research and Lumet's outline, she eventually turned out a 365-page script in 10 days. It was nearly impossible to sell the studio on a three-hour picture, but by offering to slash the budget to $10 million they agreed.|$|E
500|$|Benson {{considers}} Brand {{to be one}} of {{the weakest}} female roles in the Bond canon and [...] "a throwback to the rather stiff characterization of Vesper Lynd" [...] from Casino Royale. Brand's lack of interest in Bond removes sexual tension from the novel; she is unique in the canon for being the one woman that Bond does not seduce. The cultural historians Janet Woollacott and Tony Bennett write that the perceived reserve shown by Brand to Bond was not due to frigidity, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> engagement to a fellow police officer.|$|E

The mid-tempo, [...] "bubble-gum pop" [...] "Papi Te Quiero" [...] (Daddy I Love You), {{named one of the}} album's biggest hits, [...] "pairs a straightforward love song with the well known reggae riddim Buyout." [...] Ramiro Burr of Billboard stated [...] "Papi Te Quiero" [...] showcases how [...] "effortlessly and quickly she alternately sings and raps, claiming that she has a distinct vocal style that evokes Gwen Stefani". Although, the literal translation of [...] "Papi Te Quiero" [...] is [...] "Daddy I Love You", it is not directed towards Queen's father <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> love interest; [...] "Papi" [...] can be translated to [...] "baby". [...] "Quiero Bailar" [...] (I Want To Dance) incorporates the Liquid riddim, a musical riddim produced by the [...] "Jamaican cross-over guru" [...] Jeremy Harding. The song's lyrics [...] "warn her dance partner not to misinterpret her moves." [...] She degrades her partner who thinks that just because she dances with him that she is automatically going to have sexual relations with him.|$|E
500|$|The {{cancelled}} {{journey was}} the beginning of the end. A crying, defiant Bosse went off by herself to the seaside resort Hornbæk in Denmark, a much shorter trip, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> senses, a delightfully refreshing one. [...] There, she was soon followed by Strindberg's letters, full of agonized remorse at having given her pain, and then by Strindberg himself, steeling himself to bear the social life Bosse relished. However, the relationship quickly foundered on jealousy and suspicion, as when Strindberg struck a photographer over the head with his stick, unable to endure any attention to Bosse. In August, when Bosse discovered that she was pregnant, even Strindberg's delight (he was a fond parent of the four children of his previous marriages) could not save a marriage full of distrust and accusation. [...] This was illustrated in Strindberg's increasingly frantic letters to Bosse When their daughter Anne-Marie was born on 25 March 1902, they were already living apart. [...] "For the sake of us both it is best that I do not return", wrote Bosse in a letter to Strindberg. [...] "A continuation of life together with suspicion of every word, every act of mine, would be the end of me." [...] At her insistence, Strindberg began divorce proceedings.|$|E

500|$|Roy, who {{had taught}} Cho in Introduction to Poetry the {{previous}} year, {{described him as}} [...] "an intelligent man," [...] and {{that he seemed to}} be an awkward, lonely and insecure student who never took off his sunglasses, even indoors. She described Cho's behavior as [...] "arrogant" [...] and [...] "obnoxious" [...] at times, and that she tried several different ways to help him. Roy declined to comment on Cho's writings, saying only in general that they [...] "seemed very angry." [...] She added that Cho, when called on in class, would take 20 seconds to answer questions, and whispered his response. He also took cell phone pictures of her in class. After Roy became concerned with Cho's behavior and the themes in his writings, she started meeting with Cho to work with him one-on-one. However, she soon became concerned for her safety, and told her assistant that she would use the name of a dead professor as a duress code, in order to alert the assistant to call security. After Roy notified authorities of Cho's behavior, she urged Cho to seek counseling, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> knowledge, Cho never followed through with the request, in spite of his insistence to the contrary.|$|E
500|$|Although some {{survivors}} {{disputed the}} accounts of cannibalism, Charles McGlashan, who corresponded {{with many of the}} survivors over a 40-year period, documented many recollections that it occurred. Some correspondents were not forthcoming, approaching their participation with shame, but others eventually spoke about it freely. McGlashan in his 1879 book History of the Donner Party declined to include some of the more morbid detailssuch as the suffering of the children and infants before death, or how Mrs. Murphy, according to Georgia Donner, gave up, lay down on her bed and faced the wall when the last of the children left in the third relief. He also neglected to mention any cannibalism at Alder Creek. The same year McGlashan's book was published, Georgia Donner wrote to him to clarify some points, saying that human flesh was prepared for people in both tents at Alder Creek, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> recollection (she was four years old during the winter of 1846–1847) it was given only to the youngest children: [...] "Father was crying and did not look at us the entire time, and we little ones felt we could not help it. There was nothing else." [...] She also remembered that Elizabeth Donner, Jacob's wife, announced one morning that she had cooked the arm of Samuel Shoemaker, a 25-year-old teamster. Eliza Donner Houghton, in her 1911 account of the ordeal, did not mention any cannibalism at Alder Creek.|$|E
500|$|Susie's ballads occupy roughly {{one-third of}} the film, {{performing}} {{a combination of both}} contemporary and classic standards. Rosenberg compared the character to actress Marilyn Monroe's character Sugar Kane Kowalczyk in the film Some Like it Hot (1959). Susie's lack of singing experience is balanced by an [...] "ineffable vocal quality that causes people to listen, because they might be missing something." [...] Steve Vineberg, writing in the journal Film Quarterly, agreed that, despite her unimpressive voice, Susie [...] "wears a lyric tight to her skin, liked a zipped-up sleeping bag." [...] According to Télérama's Guillemette Odicino, the character has been [...] "endowed with a voice and a charm to take the breath." [...] Susie remains a heavily guarded individual until she performs [...] "Makin' Whoopee", which finally allows her to lower her defenses. When Susie performs the song, she is – for the first time – not singing to the audience, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> sole accompanist Jack instead. According to Slant film critic Chuck Bowen, [...] "When Susie sings 'Makin' Whoopee' in a traffic-stopping red dress, mounting Jack's piano as if it's an extension of his very essence... all bets of detached, business-collaborative stability between the two are understood to be off." [...] Bowen also compared the character's performance to actress Rita Hayworth's in the film Gilda (1946). Prior to this moment, it almost appears as though a romantic relationship might never actually develop between the two characters. Observing that the character's tough attitude matches the difficult life she has been through, Janet Maslin of The New York Times believes that Susie must be [...] "singing from experience" [...] when she performs the song [...] "Ten Cents a Dance". Go Slow: The Life of Julie London author Michael Owen considers both Pfeiffer's performance and Susie herself to be a tribute to actress and singer Julie London, citing similarities such as asking her accompanist to perform [...] "More Than You Know" [...] in a slow tempo, swearing into a live microphone and delivering a [...] "sexy rendition" [...] of [...] "Makin' Whoopee", capturing [...] "some of the essence of Julie's style." ...|$|E

500|$|Deborah Wilker from The Day {{commented that}} [...] "Madonna's got an almost rabid energy about her, which she {{maintains}} {{for the duration}} of 90 minutes. In fact she rarely leaves the stage—preferring to change costumes in a phone booth instead. Boy can she change. One minute she's a 50's teenager in a party dress, next she's playing a speak-easy chanteuse. It's almost difficult to believe that a career as young as Madonna's could contain so much popular material that on stage the star can barely get to half of it." [...] Don McLeese from Chicago Sun-Times reviewed the performance at Soldier Field stadium said that [...] "'Shine' seems like a dim possibility for her Soldier Field performance this month, because Madonna invariably takes the stage after dusk has turned to dark and brings back the sun again for the two hours that she played." [...] In another review, McCleese commented: [...] " [...] proceeded to show Soldier Field a few moves that would gain Walter Payton some yardage, while putting a whole new twist on the term 'backfield in motion'. The girl really knows how to cause a commotion." [...] Richard Harrington from The Washington Post felt that the tour [...] "would have played better to a full house at the Capital Centre or Merriweather Post Pavilion. <b>But</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> credit, Madonna performed last night as if the house was full, and the show is splendid pop theater. Madonna has described it as 'Broadway in a stadium', and with her nonstop dancing, costume changes, mini-dramas and dynamic pacing, it is sort of a 'Liza With an M.'" [...] Jon Pareles from The New York Times reviewed the concert at Madison Square Garden in New York and felt that [...] "For all its effort and professionalism, the concert wasn't exactly moving; Madonna had to ask the audience to get up and dance twice. But as shallow, kitschy, pop entertainment—no big messages, no revelations, familiar sounds and images, plenty of catchy tunes—the show was easy to enjoy. [...] The tunes stick to her limited vocal range and usually use short phrases—the better to keep her from running out of breath as she dances across the stage. And her band knocked the songs out with solid precision, recreating the gleaming sound of her records.|$|E

2500|$|After {{gradually}} progressing from {{a wheelchair}} to crutches to braces, Allyson's true escape from her impoverished {{life was to}} go to the cinema, where she was enraptured by Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire movies. As a teen, Allyson memorized the trademark Ginger Rogers dance routines; she claimed later to have watched The Gay Divorcee 17 times. She also tried to emulate the singing styles of movie stars although she never mastered reading music. When her mother remarried and the family was reunited with a more stable financial standing, Allyson was enrolled in the Ned Wayburn Dancing Academy and began to enter dance competitions with the stage name of [...] "Elaine Peters". With the death of her stepfather and a bleak future ahead, she left high school after completing two and half years, to seek jobs as a dancer. Her first $60-a-week job was as a tap dancer at the Lido Club in Montreal. Returning to New York, she found work as an actress in movie short subjects filmed by Educational Pictures at its Astoria, Long Island, studio. Fiercely ambitious, Allyson tried her hand at modeling, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> consternation became the [...] "sad-looking before part" [...] in a before-and-after bathing suit magazine ad. Her first career break came when Educational cast her as an ingenue opposite singer Lee Sullivan, comic dancers Herman Timberg, Jr., and Pat Rooney, Jr., and future comedy star Danny Kaye. When Educational ceased operations, Allyson moved to Vitaphone in Brooklyn and starred or co-starred (with dancer Hal Le Roy) in musical shorts.|$|E
2500|$|A {{wide range}} of foods were subject to narambi (taboo) prohibitions. In regards to ngaitji (family group totems), eating them was not narambi but {{depended}} on the family groups' own attitude. Some family groups banned eating them, some could eat them only {{if they had been}} caught by members of another family group and some had no restrictions. Once dead the animal was no longer considered ngaitji which is Ngarrindjeri for [...] "friend". A ngaitji was not actually sacred in the western sense but considered a [...] "spiritual advisor" [...] to the family group. Other foods were narambi but had no supernatural sanctions and these relied on attitudes to the species. Male dogs were friends of the Ngarrindjeri so were not eaten while female dogs were not eaten because they were [...] "unclean". snakes were not eaten because of the [...] "feel of their skin". Some bird species considered to act cruelly to other animals were narambi and magpies were because they warned other birds to flee if any were killed. Some bird species were narambi because they were the spirits of people who had died. Birds became narambi during nesting season and the malleefowl was narambi because its eggs were considered more valuable for food although there were no penalties for violation. Foods with supernatural sanctions were limited to bats, white owls and certain foods that were narambi only to women or to pregnant women. A separate category of narambi was young boys going through initiation. They were themselves considered narambi and any food they caught or prepared was narambi to all women who were even forbidden to see or smell it. Violation, whether accidental or deliberate, resulted in physical punishments including spearings that applied not only to the woman <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> relatives. Taplin in 1862 noted that narambi prohibitions were regularly being broken by children due to European influence and in the 1930s Berndt recorded that most narambi had been forgotten and if known, ignored.|$|E
