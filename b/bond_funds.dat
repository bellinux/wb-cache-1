25|$|Ultrashort <b>bond</b> <b>funds</b> are mutual funds, {{similar to}} money market funds, that, {{as the name}} implies, invest in bonds with {{extremely}} short maturities. Unlike money market funds, however, there are no restrictions {{on the quality of}} the investments they hold. Instead, ultrashort <b>bond</b> <b>funds</b> typically invest in riskier securities in order to increase their return. Since these high-risk securities can experience large swings in price or even default, ultrashort <b>bond</b> <b>funds,</b> unlike money market funds, do not seek to maintain a stable $1.00 NAV and may lose money or dip below the $1.00 mark in the short term. Finally, because they invest in lower quality securities, ultrashort <b>bond</b> <b>funds</b> are more susceptible to adverse market conditions such as those brought on by the financial crisis of 2007–2010.|$|E

2500|$|By 1957, it {{had been}} {{made clear that the}} 1951 bond issue {{was not going to be}} able to pay for the Second Avenue Line.

By then, the New York Times despaired of the line's ever being built. [...] "It certainly will cost more than $500,000,000 and will require a new bond issue," [...] wrote one reporter. In March of that year, NYCTA chairman Charles L.

He stated that the bonds had been allocated to the corridor based on increasing ridership on the Second Avenue Line, but admitted that currency inflation, as well as necessary rehabilitation work to the existing lines, made the Second Avenue Line unlikely in the near future.|$|E
