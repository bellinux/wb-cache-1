5|$|Poulenc {{was briefly}} a soldier {{again during the}} Second World War; he was called up on 2 June 1940 and served in an {{anti-aircraft}} unit at Bordeaux. After France surrendered to Germany, Poulenc was demobilised from the army on 18 July 1940. He spent the summer of that year {{with family and friends}} at Brive-la-Gaillarde in south-central France. In the early months of the war, he had composed little new music, instead re-orchestrating Les biches and reworking his 1932 Sextet for piano and winds. At Brive-la-Gaillarde he began three new works, and once <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> home in Noizay in October he started on a fourth. These were L'Histoire de Babar, le petit éléphant for piano and narrator, the Cello Sonata, the ballet Les Animaux modèles and the song cycle Banalités.|$|E
5|$|One of Mickal's {{most notable}} games came in 1934 against the Mustangs of Southern Methodist. He threw two {{touchdown}} passes, {{the first one}} a 32-yarder {{to tie the game}} at 7–7 in the second quarter. Late in the fourth quarter and down by a touchdown, Mickal dropped <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> own 35-yard line and hurled a pass {{down the middle of the}} field. It was caught in stride at the Mustang 20-yard line by Gaynell Tinsley, who ran it into the end zone to tie the game at 14–14, which was the final score. In week four against 13th-ranked Arkansas, Mickal completed five of seven passes for 117 yards, which included a 52-yard bomb in the third quarter for the first score of the 16–0 win. He also averaged over 50 yards per punt on nine punts. The next week he threw a touchdown pass, kicked a field goal, and averaged over 40 yards per punt in a 29–0 win over previously undefeated Vanderbilt. Mickal was named a first-team All-SEC selection as a fullback by the Associated Press (AP) and as a halfback by the UP.|$|E

The couple bought the 17th century Jerviswood House.|$|E
25|$|Salieri cannot {{reconcile}} Mozart's boorish behaviour {{with the}} genius that God has inexplicably bestowed upon him. Indeed, Salieri, {{who has been}} a devout Catholic all his life, cannot believe that God would choose Mozart over him for such a gift. Salieri renounces God and vows to do everything in his power to destroy Mozart as a way of getting <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> Creator.|$|E

"Now, then, my beauty, don't shrink," [...] he said, as {{the poor}} fox <b>backed</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> {{approach}} {{as far as}} the chain, which fastened the trap to a log of wood, would permit, and then, standing at bay, showed a formidable row of teeth. That grin was its last; another moment, and the handle of the accountant's axe stretched it lifeless on the snow.|$|R
25|$|Donnie Smith, {{a former}} What Do Kids Know? champion, watches the show from a bar. Donnie's parents spent {{the money he}} won as a child, {{and he has been}} fired from his job at Solomon & Solomon, an {{electronics}} store, due to chronic lateness and poor sales. He is obsessed with getting oral surgery, thinking he will land the man of his dreams after he gets braces.

25|$|That night, Spade is {{awakened by}} {{a phone call from}} the police and {{informed}} that Archer has been killed. He meets his friend, Police Detective Tom Polhaus (Ward Bond), at the murder scene. He tries calling Wonderly at her hotel, but she has checked out. <b>Back</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> apartment, he is grilled by Polhaus and Lieutenant Dundy (Barton MacLane), who tell him that Thursby was also murdered the same evening. Dundy suggests that Spade had the opportunity and motive to kill Thursby, who likely killed Archer, immediately after he learned of Archer's death. Archer's widow Iva (Gladys George) believes that Spade shot his partner so he could have her.|$|E

This incident occurred when, three-quarters of an hour before a curfew was to have gone into effect, he stepped outside the house so as not to disturb his sleeping grandchildren, in order to enjoy a few draws on a cigar given him that evening by his son-in-law. The soldier responsible for his death was U. S. Army cook Pfc. Raymond Norwood Bell of North Carolina, who was overcome by remorse and died of alcoholism in 1955.|$|E

25|$|In April 1849 Lienhard and Dürr went as {{partners}} to the mines to trade the sheep. Several weeks later Lienhard sold out to Dürr and, {{back at the}} Fort, acquiesced in Sutter, Jr.’s request of going to Europe {{in order to bring}} the rest of his family to California. Heinrich Lienhard left San Francisco in June 1849, traveling via the Isthmus of Panama to New York and from there via England and Germany to Switzerland. Taking the same route, he returned to San Francisco in January 1850. Only half a year later he decided to leave violence-ridden California for good. Although he loved its climate, prairies, valleys, and mountains, he could not tolerate the lawlessness as well as the exploitation and destruction of the indigenous peoples. On the last day of 1850 and after a journey of six months he was <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> parental home in Switzerland.|$|E
25|$|While Peter Davison, Colin Baker, Sylvester McCoy, and Paul McGann {{have all}} reprised their roles for audio adventures {{produced}} since the 1990s by Big Finish (and sometimes the BBC), Baker {{had declined to}} voice the Doctor until 2009, claiming that he hadn't seen a script he liked. In July 2009, the BBC announced that Baker {{would return to the}} role for a series of five audio dramas, co-starring Richard Franklin as Captain Mike Yates, which would begin release in September. The five audios comprise a single linked story under the banner title Hornets' Nest, written by well-known author Paul Magrs. He returns with a sequel to Hornets' Nest called Demon Quest. Baker has also filmed inserts for a video release of the unfinished Shada in 1992, presented the video release The Tom Baker Years (1992), the latter a look <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> time on the series watching short clips from his episodes and also provided narration for several BBC audio releases of old Doctor Who stories.|$|E
25|$|On 26 October 1937, as the Chinese {{defense of}} Zhabei faltered, Chiang Kai-shek wanted to {{withdraw}} all Chinese forces {{to defend the}} rural western regions of Shanghai and ordered acting commander of the 3rd Military Region Gu Zhutong to leave the 88th Division behind to cover their retreat. Gu was personally attached to the 88th Division and was vehemently against this plan, as was the division's commander Sun Yuanliang, who sent {{his chief of staff}} Zhang Boting to Gu's headquarters to argue against it. However both hesitated to go against Chiang's orders; Sun instead suggested that the number of troops left behind to cover the withdrawal would not matter. He proposed (through Zhang) that a single regiment instead be left to defend one or two fortified regions, a plan Gu approved. <b>Back</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> own headquarters, however, Sun decided that a regiment would still be too many lives wasted and decided to instead order a single over-strength battalion - the 524th Regiment, which had been reduced to 423 men - to defend the divisional headquarters at Sihang Warehouse instead. Xie Jinyuan, relatively new to the 88th, volunteered to lead the regiment, relieving command from Yang Ruifu on 26 October.|$|E

500|$|Nevertheless, Peale {{recommended}} that {{construction on the}} building continue, as he deemed Congress unlikely to pass another appropriation for construction.

[...] Peale was <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> desk at the Philadelphia Mint on December 23, 1837.|$|E
