5000|$|By the 1920s, tracked {{vehicles}} became common, particularly the Caterpillar 60. Rubber-tired vehicles came into {{use in the}} 1940s. To dig canals, raise earth dams, and do other earth-moving jobs, these tractors were equipped with a large thick metal plate in front. (The blade got its curved shape later). In some early models the driver sat on top in the open without a cabin. There are three main types of bulldozer blades: a U-blade for pushing and carrying dirt relatively long distances, a straight blade for [...] "knocking down" [...] and spreading piles of dirt, and a <b>brush</b> <b>rake</b> for removing brush and roots. These attachments (home-built or built by small equipment manufacturers of attachments for wheeled and crawler tractors and trucks) appeared by 1929.|$|E

50|$|The {{performers}} {{are grouped}} around a mast horse (possibly 'Snap Dragon'; see below) with a shiny black head {{made from a}} painted skull set on a short pole. Behind it are two men in threatening postures, one is waving a long stick like the handle of a <b>brush</b> or <b>rake,</b> the other probably a besom broom (blurred).|$|R
6000|$|The bath-mat was {{wrinkled}} and {{the floor}} was wet. (His daughter Verona eccentrically took baths in the morning, now and then.) He slipped on the mat, and slid against the tub. He said [...] "Damn!" [...] Furiously he snatched up his tube of shaving-cream, furiously he lathered, with a belligerent slapping of the unctuous <b>brush,</b> furiously he <b>raked</b> his plump cheeks with a safety-razor. It pulled. The blade was dull. He said, [...] "Damn--oh--oh--damn it!" ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{performers}} {{are grouped}} around a [...] "mast horse" [...] with a shiny black head {{made from a}} skull (with ears attached and a large eyeball in its white-painted eye socket) set on a short pole. It is operated by a person who crouches under a blanket, attached {{to the back of}} the skull, that hides most of the pole. Behind this horse are two men who seem to be threatening it, one with a long stick like the handle of a <b>brush</b> or <b>rake,</b> the other with a besom broom (blurred). The one with the stick wears white trousers, a dark jacket and a top hat; his face is disguised, perhaps by a mask or possibly wrapped in cloth. The other has a dark jacket and a flat-topped, ornate hat that looks like a smoking cap; he may be wearing a mask or perhaps a painted-on beard; his legs cannot be seen.|$|R
