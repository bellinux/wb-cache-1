5|$|A phylogenetic {{analysis}} of various eastern Asian and eastern North American disjunct Suillus species revealed that S.sibiricus forms a well-supported clade with S.americanus and S.umbonatus; these relationships are corroborated by a previous analysis (1996), which used a larger sampling of Suillus species to determine taxonomic {{relationships in the}} genus. Within this clade, S.umbonatus and U.S. S.sibiricus can <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rest of the group. However, the phylogenetic relationships among the tested isolates determined from different methods of analysis are not always consistent {{and could not be}} established with confidence. In general, there is little phylogenetic divergence detected in this clade.|$|E

5|$|Adiantum viridimontanum can <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> morphologically similar {{individuals}} of A.aleuticum by the greater {{length of the}} stalks on the medial ultimate segments and of the false indusia, measuring greater than 0.9mm and greater than 3.5mm, respectively, in A.viridimontanum. Spore size is also a useful character (although not easily measured in the field); the average A.viridimontanum spore measures 51.4μm in diameter. While A.aleuticum spores can reach up to 53μm, they average about 43μm. In A.aleuticum growing as a disjunct on eastern serpentine (the specimens {{most likely to be}} confused with A.viridimontanum), the rhizome is much more frequently branched, with intervals of 1.0 to 2.0mm between nodes.|$|E
5|$|For the {{production}} of pure chromium, the iron must <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> chromium in a two step roasting and leaching process. The chromite ore is heated {{with a mixture of}} calcium carbonate and sodium carbonate in the presence of air. The chromium is oxidized to the hexavalent form, while the iron forms the stable Fe2O3. The subsequent leaching at higher elevated temperatures dissolves the chromates and leaves the insoluble iron oxide. The chromate is converted by sulfuric acid into the dichromate.|$|E
5|$|Such a {{supernova}} event may pose some threat {{to life on}} the Earth. It is thought that the primary star, IK Pegasi A, is unlikely to evolve into a red giant in the immediate future. As shown previously, the space velocity of this star relative to the Sun is 20.4km/s. This is equivalent to moving a distance of one light year every 14,700years. After 5million years, for example, this star will <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Sun by more than 500light years. A TypeI{{a supernova}} within a thousand parsecs (3300light-years) {{is thought to be}} able to affect the Earth, but it must be closer than about 10 parsecs (around thirty light-years) to cause a major harm to the terrestrial biosphere.|$|E

5|$|The {{change in}} {{buoyancy}} of a diving cylinder during the dive {{can be more}} problematic with side-mounted cylinders, and the actual buoyancy at any point during the dive is a consideration with any cylinder that may <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> diver for any reason. Cylinders which will be stage-dropped or handed off to another diver should not change the diver's buoyancy beyond what can be compensated using their buoyancy compensator. Cylinders with approximately neutral buoyancy when full generally require the least compensation when detached.|$|E
5|$|The {{taxonomy}} of the albatross {{group has been}} a source of much debate. The Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy places seabirds, birds of prey and many others in a greatly enlarged order, Ciconiiformes, whereas the ornithological organisations in North America, Europe, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand retain the more traditional order Procellariiformes. The albatrosses can <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> other Procellariiformes both genetically and through morphological characteristics, size, their legs, and the arrangement of their nasal tubes (see below: Morphology and flight).|$|E
5|$|Ireland was {{important}} to Henry, both {{as a source of}} royal revenue – an average of £1,150 was sent from Ireland to the Crown each year during the middle of his reign – and as a source of estates that could be granted to his supporters. The major landowners looked eastwards towards Henry's court for political leadership, and many also possessed estates in Wales and England. The 1240s saw major upheavals in land ownership due to deaths among the barons, enabling Henry to redistribute Irish lands to his supporters. In the 1250s, the King gave out numerous grants of land along the frontier in Ireland to his supporters, creating a buffer zone against the native Irish; the local Irish kings began to suffer increased harassment as English power increased across the region. These lands were in many cases unprofitable for the barons to hold and English power reached its zenith under Henry for the medieval period. In 1254, Henry granted Ireland to his son, Edward, on condition that it would never <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Crown.|$|E

5|$|The 2001 dive season {{concentrated}} on raising the ship's steam engine and condenser. Hull plates {{had to be}} removed to access the engine compartment and both the engine and the condenser had to <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ship, the surrounding wreckage and each other. A Mini Rover ROV was used to provide visibility of the wreck and divers to the support staff above water. The engine was raised on 16 July and the condenser three days later by the crane barge Wotan. Saturation diving was evaluated by the Navy that dive season on Monitor and proved to be very successful, allowing divers to maximize their time on the bottom. The surface-supplied divers evaluated the use of heliox due to the depth of the wreck. It also proved to be successful once the dive tables were adjusted.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} types of plant oils, {{distinguished}} by the method used to extract the oil from the plant. The relevant part of the plant may be placed under pressure to extract the oil, giving an expressed (or pressed) oil. The oils included in this list are of this type. Oils may also be extracted from plants by dissolving parts of plants in water or another solvent. The solution may <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> plant material and concentrated, giving an extracted or leached oil. The mixture may also be separated by distilling the oil away from the plant material. Oils extracted by this latter method are called essential oils. Essential oils often have different properties and uses than pressed or leached vegetable oils. Finally, macerated oils are made by infusing parts of plants in a base oil, a process called liquid-liquid extraction.|$|E
5|$|Following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, {{led by the}} Free Officers Movement of Muhammad Naguib and Gamal Abdel Nasser, {{in which}} the Egyptian monarchy was overthrown, the {{university}} began to <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mosque. A number of properties that surrounded the mosque were acquired and demolished to provide space for a modern campus by 1955. The mosque itself would no longer serve as a school, and the college was officially designated a university in 1961. The 1961 law separated the dual roles of the educational institution and the religious institution which made judgments heeded throughout the Muslim world. The law also created secular departments within al-Azhar, such as colleges of medicine, engineering, and economics, furthering the efforts at modernization first seen following the French occupation. The reforms of the curriculum {{have led to a}} massive {{growth in the number of}} Egyptian students attending al-Azhar run schools, specifically youths attending primary and secondary schools within the al-Azhar system. The number of students reported to attend al-Azhar primary and secondary schools increased from under 90,000 in 1970 to 300,000 in the early in 1980s, up to nearly one million in the early 1990s, and exceeding 1.3 million students in 2001.|$|E

5|$|In late 1863, while Quantrill's Raiders {{spent the}} winter in Texas, {{animosity}} developed between Anderson and Quantrill. Anderson, perhaps falsely, implicated Quantrill in a murder, leading to the latter's arrest by Confederate authorities. Anderson subsequently returned to Missouri {{as the leader of}} a group of raiders and became the most feared guerrilla in the state, killing and robbing dozens of Union soldiers and civilian sympathizers throughout central Missouri. Although Union supporters viewed him as incorrigibly evil, Confederate sympathizers in Missouri saw his actions as justified, possibly owing to their mistreatment by Union forces. In September 1864 he led a raid on Centralia, Missouri. Unexpectedly, they were able to capture a passenger train, the first time Confederate guerrillas had done so. In {{what became known as the}} Centralia Massacre--possibly the war's deadliest and most brutal guerrilla action--his men killed 24 Union soldiers on the train and set an ambush later that day that killed more than 100 Union militiamen. A month later Anderson himself was killed in battle. Historians have made disparate appraisals of Anderson: some see him as a sadistic, psychopathic killer, but for others his actions cannot <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> general lawlessness of the time.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the {{developers}} planned to only upgrade the graphics and tweak the gameplay. However, as development was {{getting closer to}} completion, Capcom started making more substantial changes in the game. For example, the inventory was expanded so that players could carry a standard item like Jill's lock picking, while defense items, which were initially not going to <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> main inventory, were introduced to make the game a bit easier than the original Resident Evil. The developers originally planned to make all enemies invisible but the idea was ultimately discarded {{because it would have}} made the remake very different from the original game. However, they designed the zombies so that they could come back to life {{a certain amount of time}} after they are killed. The developers also added new areas for the player to explore, changed most of the puzzle designs, and included a new control scheme called Type C where players move their characters by pressing the R button of the GameCube controller and steer them with the analog stick. Another addition is the subplot involving the character Lisa Trevor, which was cut from the original game. Instead of using adjectives to describe difficulty levels, Mikami deliberately decided to have unique questions so that the player would pick the hard one.|$|E
5|$|The recoil {{momentum}} of the produced mendelevium-256 atoms is used to bring them physically {{far away from the}} einsteinium target from which they are produced, bringing them onto a thin foil of metal (usually beryllium, aluminium, platinum, or gold) just behind the target in a vacuum. This eliminates the need for immediate chemical separation, which is both costly and prevents reusing of the expensive einsteinium target. The mendelevium atoms are then trapped in a gas atmosphere (frequently helium), and a gas jet from a small opening in the reaction chamber carries the mendelevium along. Using a long capillary tube, and including potassium chloride aerosols in the helium gas, the mendelevium atoms can be transported over tens of meters to be chemically analyzed and have their quantity determined. The mendelevium can then <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> foil material and other fission products by applying acid to the foil and then coprecipitating the mendelevium with lanthanum fluoride, then using a cation-exchange resin column with a 10% ethanol solution saturated with hydrochloric acid, acting as an eluant. However, if the foil is made of gold and thin enough, it is enough to simply dissolve the gold in aqua regia before separating the trivalent actinides from the gold using anion-exchange chromatography, the eluant being 6Mhydrochloric acid.|$|E
