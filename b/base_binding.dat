50|$|This {{protein is}} a small GTPase {{belonging}} to the Ras superfamily. As a Ras superfamily member, RASD1 shares several motifs characteristic of Ras proteins, including four highly conserved GTP binding pocket domains: the phosphate/magnesium binding regions GXXXXGK(S/T) (domain Σ1), DXXG (domain Σ2), and the guanine <b>base</b> <b>binding</b> loops NKXD (domain Σ3) and EXSAK (domain Σ4). These four domains, along with an effector loop, are responsible for binding to other proteins and signaling molecules. Another common Ras motif, the CAAX motif, {{can be found in}} the C-terminal of RASD1 and promotes the subcellular localization of RASD1 to the plasma membrane. As a GTPase, RASD1 also shares motifs, such as in the regions G-1 to G-3, with other GTPases.The full-length RASD1 cDNA produces a protein with a length of 280 amino acid residues and a molecular mass of 31.7 kDa.|$|E
50|$|In {{comparison}} with its better-known archaeal homolog bacteriorhodopsin, {{most of the}} active site residues of known importance to the bacteriorhodopsin mechanism are conserved in proteorhodopsin. Sequence similarity is not significantly conserved however, from either halo- or bacterio- rhodopsin. Homologues of the active site residues Arg82, Asp85 (the primary proton acceptor), Asp212 and Lys216 (the retinal Schiff <b>base</b> <b>binding</b> site) in bacteriorhodopsin are conserved as Arg94, Asp97, Asp227 and Lys231 in proteorhodopsin. However, in proteorhodopsin, there are no carboxylic acid residues directly homologous to Glu194 or Glu204 of bacteriorhodopsin (or Glu 108 and 204 depending on the bacRhodopsin variant), which {{are thought to be}} involved in the proton release pathway at the extracellular surface. However, Asp97 and Arg94 may replace this functionality without the close residue proximity as in bacteriorhodopsin. The department of chemistry at Syracuse University decisevely showed Asp97 cannot be the proton release group as the release happened at forcing conditions under which the aspartic acid group remained protonated.|$|E

All these dinucleoside phosphates assume extended conformations {{in the active}} site leading to better interactions with the enzyme. The 5 '-terminal guanine of all these ligands {{is placed in the}} primary <b>base</b> <b>binding</b> site of the enzyme in an orientation similar to that of 2 '-GMP in the RNase T 1 - 2 '-GMP complex. The 2 '-terminal purines are placed close to the hydrophobic pocket formed by the residues Gly 71, Ser 72, Pro 73 and Gly 74 which occur in a loop region. However, the orientation of the 2 '-terminal pyrimidines is different from that of 2 '-terminal purines. This perhaps explains the higher binding affinity of the 2 ', 5 '-linked guanine dinucleoside phosphates with 2 '-terminal purines than those with 2 '-terminal pyrimidines. A comparison of the binding of the guanine dinucleoside phosphates with 2 ', 5 '- and 3 ', 5 '-linkages suggests significant differences in the ribose pucker and hydrogen bonding interactions between the catalytic residues and the bound nucleoside phosphate implying that 2 ', 5 '-linked dinucleoside phosphates may not be the ideal ligands to probe the role of the catalytic amino acid residues. A change in the amino acid sequence in the surface loop region formed by the residues Gly 71 to Gly 74 drastically affects the conformation of the <b>base</b> <b>binding</b> subsite, and this may account for the inactivity of the enzyme with altered sequence i. e., with Pro, Gly and Ser at positions 71 to 73 respectively. These results thus suggest that in addition to recognition and catalytic sites, interactions at the loop regions which constitute the subsite for <b>base</b> <b>binding</b> are also crucial in determining the substrate specificity...|$|E

A common problem in the screening process is the generation of false positive hits through unspecific effects from the complex chemical composition of the crude extracts. In this study, we explored {{a combination of a}} fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) based activity assay and a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) <b>based</b> <b>binding</b> assay to avoid this problem. An aqueous extract was prepared from rest raw material of the Norwegian spring spawning herring, and further fractionated by methanol solubility and solid phase extraction. FRET based activity assays were used to determine the influence of each extract on the activity of different proteases. Several extracts showed more than 50 % inhibition. The inhibition mechanisms were elucidated by SPR based competition experiments with known inhibitors. For the secreted aspartic proteases 1, 2, 3 and HIV- 1 protease, the results indicated that some extracts contain inhibitors interacting specifically with the active site of the enzymes. The study shows that a combination of an activity assay and an SPR <b>based</b> <b>binding</b> assay is a powerful tool to identify potent inhibitors in marine extracts. Furthermore, the study shows that marine vertebrates offer an interesting source for new bioactive compounds, although they have rarely been explored for this purpose...|$|R

In the structure of EcRNase I in complex with a substrate-mimicking decadeoxynucleotide d(CGCGATCGCG), we observe a cytosine bound in the B 2 <b>base</b> <b>binding</b> site and mixed binding of thymine and guanine in the B 1 <b>base</b> <b>binding</b> site. The active site residues His 55, His 133, and Glu 129 interact with the phosphodiester linkage only through a set of water molecules. Residues forming the B 2 base recognition site are well conserved among bacterial homologs and may generate limited base specificity. On the other hand, the B 1 binding cleft acquires true base aspecificity by combining hydrophobic van der Waals contacts at its sides with a water-mediated hydrogen-bonding network at the bottom.

40|$|The {{modes of}} binding of {{adenosine}} 2 '-monophosphate (2 '-AMP) to the enzyme ribonuclease (RNase) T 1 {{were determined by}} computer modelling studies. The phosphate moiety of 2 '-AMP binds at the primary phosphate binding site. However, adenine can occupy two distinct sites [...] (1) The primary <b>base</b> <b>binding</b> site where the guanine of 2 '-GMP binds and (2) The subsite close to the N 1 subsite for the base on the 3 '-side of guanine in a guanyl dinucleotide. The minimum energy conformers corresponding to the two modes of binding of 2 '-AMP to RNase T 1 {{were found to be}} of nearly the same energy implying that in solution 2 '-AMP binds to the enzyme in both modes. The conformation of the inhibitor and the predicted hydrogen bonding scheme for the RNase T 1 - 2 '-AMP complex in the second binding mode (S) agrees well with the reported x-ray crystallographic study. The existence of the first mode of binding explains the experimental observations that RNase T 1 catalyses the hydrolysis of phosphodiester bonds adjacent to adenosine at high enzyme concentrations. A comparison of the interactions of 2 '-AMP and 2 '-GMP with RNase T 1 reveals that Glu 58 and Asn 98 at the phosphate binding site and Glu 46 at the <b>base</b> <b>binding</b> site preferentially stabilise the enzyme- 2 '-GMP complex...|$|E

40|$|The EcoRV DNA-(adenine-N 6) -methyltransferase (M. EcoRV) {{specifically}} modifies {{the first}} adenine residue within GATATC sequences. During catalysis, the enzyme flips its target base {{out of the}} DNA helix and binds it into a target <b>base</b> <b>binding</b> pocket which is formed in part by Lys 16 and Tyr 196. A cytosine residue is accepted by wild-type M. EcoRV as a substrate at a 31 -fold reduced efficiency {{with respect to the}} kcat/KM values if it is located in a CT mismatch substrate (GCTATC/GATATC). Cytosine residues positioned in a CG base pair (GCTATC/GATAGC) are modified at much more reduced rates, because flipping out the target base is much more difficult in this case. We intended to change the target base specificity of M. EcoRV from adenine-N 6 to cytosine-N 4. To this end we generated, purified and characterized 15 variants of the enzyme, containing single, double and triple amino acid exchanges following different design approaches. One concept was {{to reduce the size of}} the target <b>base</b> <b>binding</b> pocket by site-directed mutagenesis. The K 16 R variant showed an altered specificity, with a 22 -fold preference for cytosine as the target base in a mismatch substrate. This corresponds to a 680 -fold change in specificity, which was accompanied by only a small loss in catalytic activity with the cytosine substrate. The K 16 R/Y 196 W variant no longer methylated adenine residues at all and its activity towards cytosine was reduced only 17 -fold. Therefore, we have changed the target base specificity of M. EcoRV from adenine to cytosine by rational protein design. Because there are no natural paragons for the variants described here, a change of the target base specificity of a DNA interacting enzyme was possible by rational de novo design of its active site...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{structural}} genomics centers provide hundreds of protein structures of unknown function. Therefore, developing methods enabling {{the determination of}} a protein function automatically is imperative. The determination of a protein function {{can be achieved by}} studying the network of its physical interactions. In this context, identifying a potential binding site between proteins is of primary interest. In the literature, methods for predicting a potential binding site location generally are based on classification tools. The aim {{of this paper is to}} show that regression tools are more efficient than classification tools for patches <b>based</b> <b>binding</b> site predictors. For this purpose, we developed a patches <b>based</b> <b>binding</b> site localization method usable with either regression or classification tools. Results We compared predictive performances of regression tools with performances of machine learning classifiers. Using leave-one-out cross-validation, we showed that regression tools provide better predictions than classification ones. Among regression tools, Multilayer Perceptron ranked highest in the quality of predictions. We compared also the predictive performance of our patches based method using Multilayer Perceptron with the performance of three other methods usable through a web server. Our method performed similarly to the other methods. Conclusion Regression is more efficient than classification when applied to our binding site localization method. When it is possible, using regression instead of classification for other existing binding site predictors will probably improve results. Furthermore, the method presented in this work is flexible because the size of the predicted binding site is adjustable. This adaptability is useful when either false positive or negative rates have to be limited. </p...|$|R

Multimeric ligands consist of multiple binding residues tethered together by a linker and are capable of simultaneous binding to multiple receptors. This dissertation details the proof-of-principle experiments that establish that multimeric ligands bind with an increased affinity and cooperativity compared to their monomeric counterparts. We have chosen to evaluate combinations of ligands for the human melanocortin 4 receptor (hMC 4 R), human delta-opioid receptor (hdOR), cholecystokinin-B receptor (CCK-BR), and oxytocin receptor (OTR). Multivalent ligands can be homomeric, meaning that all ligands bind to the same receptor type, or they may be heteromeric, meaning that they bind to different types of receptors. We have evaluated homodimer and homotrimer binding to hMC 4 Rs, and heterodimer binding to hMC 4 Rs and hdORs. Ligands for the receptors were tethered together using backbones constructed of polyethylene glycol (PEG) units or different combinations of amino acid repeats.
