5|$|Electricity was {{introduced}} in Upminster in 1926. Gas main supply came from Romford in 1872 and from 1905 there was gas street lighting. The area was served <b>by</b> <b>good</b> spring water, with mains supply provided by the South Essex Waterworks Company from 1836. Works on the sewerage system began in 1899 in Upminster village and Corbets Tey. In 1922 sewage works for Upminster and Cranham were opened in Great Warley. Land for Upminster Park was purchased by the parish council in 1929.|$|E
5|$|After {{its first}} peak in intensity, Nangka {{slightly}} weakened as convection {{along the west}} side of the system was restricted due to the TUTT cell, and the eye became cloud-filled. Decreasing wind shear and increasing sea surface temperatures allowed the intensification trend to resume, and the structure became more symmetric late on July8 as it moved toward the Northern Marianas Islands. A well-defined inner eye re-developed inside of an outer eyewall. On July9, the JTWC upgraded Nangka to a super typhoon, estimating peak 1minute winds of 250km/h (155mph). The JMA also assessed a 10minute peak of 185km/h (115mph). At 06:00UTC on July9, the eye of Nangka passed over the uninhabited island of Alamagan. The typhoon later weakened while turning more to the west due to increased wind shear. The eye became cloud-filled and was no longer visible by July11, although the organization was sustained <b>by</b> <b>good</b> outflow to the south. However, the convection reorganized the next day and the eye reformed. By that time, Nangka was slowing and nearly stationary as the subtropical ridge receded to the east.|$|E

5|$|During its {{development}} the ZNG experienced {{a number of}} problems, including shortages of weapons and ammunition, lack of uniforms, inadequate training and an overall deficiency in trained officers, and poor staff work and command structures (preventing the effective coordination of multiple units). These problems were offset <b>by</b> <b>good</b> morale, clear objectives {{and high levels of}} mobilisation. After the Battle of the Barracks, the ZNG expanded significantly with arms captured from the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija). By the end of October 60 new brigades and independent battalions were established, and on 3 November the ZNG was renamed the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska).|$|E
5|$|Following the 2009 race, {{officials}} {{decided to}} advance the competition's start date by one week to better accommodate mushers also participating in the Iditarod. The 2010 race started in Fairbanks on February 6, 2010, and the early start date was kept for the 2011 competition. Hans Gatt won the 2010 race with the fastest finish in Yukon Quest history: 9days and 26minutes. That race was marked <b>by</b> <b>good</b> weather, and few mushers dropped out. In 2011, conditions returned to normal, as violent storms blasted the trail and mushers {{during the second half}} of the race. Only 13 of the 25 competitors completed the race, tying the record for fewest finishers. In 2013, poor trail conditions over American Summit forced the Dawson to Eagle section of the course to be rerouted over the Yukon River.|$|E
5|$|In 1558, Elizabeth succeeded her {{half-sister}} to {{the throne}} {{and set out to}} rule <b>by</b> <b>good</b> counsel. She depended heavily on a group of trusted advisers, led by William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley. One of her first actions as queen was the establishment of an English Protestant church, of which she became the Supreme Governor. This Elizabethan Religious Settlement was to evolve into the Church of England. It was expected that Elizabeth would marry and produce an heir to continue the Tudor line. She never did, despite numerous courtships. As she grew older, Elizabeth became famous for her virginity. A cult grew around her which was celebrated in the portraits, pageants, and literature of the day.|$|E

Of the eighteen people on board, five survived. Koch was wounded by gunfire in the left leg and left arm, and broke his right leg in the subsequent crash landing. Despite the injuries, he swam about five miles to the shore where he was looked after by local people, until the Dutch Navy found the survivors some days later, and rescued them with a Dornier flying boat.

5|$|Napoli {{shareholder}} equity on 30 June 2005 was {{a negative}} of €261,466, which the club started from €3 million capital and re-capitalized €3.8 million during 2004–05 Serie C1. On 30 June 2006 the equity was increased to €211,220, as the net loss {{was backed by}} a re-capitalisation of €9.3 million + €261,466 for previous net loss. On 30 June 2007 the equity was increased to €1,961,975, due to the net profit and a re-capitalisation of €288,780 (to make the share capital back to €500,000). On 30 June 2008 the equity was increased to €13,829,015 with a capital increase of just €1,000. The net income contributed the increase in equity on 30 June 2009, which was €24,763,537. On 30 June 2010 the equity was at €25,107,223. On 30 June 2011 the equity was increased to €29,305,052.

5|$|The Michiganensian {{described}} the defeat as follows:"There had been {{every reason to}} expect a victory from Chicago. Michigan had played strong and consistent foot ball throughout her schedule – Chicago had been erratic and unsteady. But there is certainly no sport more full of surprises than foot-ball, and the Thanksgiving Day contest of '96 furnished as sensational a surprise in as exciting a contest as had ever come off on a western gridiron. There was one great difference {{in the character of}} the play of the two teams. Michigan was playing her stock game of football, hard and steady, the game she could have been depended on to play at any time. Chicago seemed to have been trained and nerved to this one game. There could have been little doubt what the result of a series of contests would have been. But this one game, Chicago won <b>by</b> <b>good</b> generalship, by the most advantageous use of her greatest resource – a magnificent player in a telling place.|$|E
5|$|The {{period between}} the {{accession}} of Máel Coluim I and Máel Coluim mac Cináeda was marked <b>by</b> <b>good</b> relations with the Wessex rulers of England, intense internal dynastic disunity and, despite this, relatively successful expansionary policies. In 945, king Máel Coluim I received Strathclyde {{as part of a}} deal with King Edmund of England, an event offset somewhat by Máel Coluim's loss of control in Moray. Sometime in the reign of king Idulb (954–962), the Scots captured the fortress called oppidum Eden, i.e. Edinburgh. Scottish control of Lothian was strengthened with Máel Coluim II's victory over the Northumbrians at the Battle of Carham (1018). The Scots had probably some authority in Strathclyde since the later part of the ninth century, but the kingdom kept its own rulers, and {{it is not clear that}} the Scots were always strong enough to enforce their authority.|$|E
5|$|With the {{subtropical}} ridge to the northeast, the nascent system moved northwestward initially. Despite persistent shear dislocating the convection, the JMA upgraded {{the system to}} a tropical storm at 12:00UTC on July2, naming it Linfa. The storm slowly intensified, amplified <b>by</b> <b>good</b> outflow {{to the south and}} the presence of warm water temperatures. On July3, Linfa's track briefly shifted to the southwest, by which time the convective structure had evolved into a central dense overcast. There was uncertainty in the storm's future as it approached the Philippines. This was due to potential interaction with Typhoon Chan-hom to the northeast, and differences in storm models whether an approaching trough would turn Linfa to the east or the west.|$|E

He then reached the quarter-finals of the Australian Goldfields Open, but lost 4–5 against Peter Ebdon. Murphy gone one better in the next two ranking tournaments, as he reached the semi-finals of the Shanghai Masters and the International Championship, but lost 3–6 against John Higgins and 5–9 against Neil Robertson respectively. Murphy than reached the final of the 2012 UK Championship courtesy of two tight victories.

5|$|The long reign (900–942/3) of Causantín (Constantine II) {{is often}} {{regarded}} {{as the key to}} formation of the Kingdom of Alba. He was later credited with bringing Scottish Christianity into conformity with the Catholic Church. After fighting many battles, his defeat at Brunanburh was followed by his retirement as a Culdee monk at St. Andrews. The period between the accession of his successor Máel Coluim I (Malcolm I) and Máel Coluim mac Cináeda (Malcolm II) was marked <b>by</b> <b>good</b> relations with the Wessex rulers of England, intense internal dynastic disunity and relatively successful expansionary policies. In 945, Máel Coluim I annexed Strathclyde, where the kings of Alba had probably exercised some authority since the later ninth century, as part of an agreement with King Edmund of England. This event was offset by loss of control in Moray. The reign of King Donnchad I (Duncan I) from 1034 was marred by failed military adventures, and he was defeated and killed by MacBeth, the Mormaer of Moray, who became king in 1040. MacBeth ruled for 17 years before he was overthrown by Máel Coluim, the son of Donnchad, who some months later defeated MacBeth's step-son and successor Lulach to become king Máel Coluim III (Malcolm III).|$|E
