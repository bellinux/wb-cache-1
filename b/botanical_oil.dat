30|$|It is {{well known}} that FEV 1 {{measurements}} show substantial heterogeneity in response to treatments, including to 5 -LO inhibitors (Drazen et al. 1999), CysLT 1 receptor antagonists (Tantisira and Drazen 2009), and even the gold standard therapy of inhaled glucocorticoids (Tantisira et al. 2011). Since we anticipated that any therapeutic benefit of the botanical omega- 3 and omega- 6 lipids would reflect a modulatory effect on LT generation, we performed a pre-specified analysis of genotyping at the LTC 4 S locus for the common A to C variant that has been associated with numerous outcomes reflective of altered CysLT generation (Asano et al. 2002; Acevedo et al. 2007; Sayers et al. 2003). We observed two distinct effects of the variant C allele on the response to the <b>botanical</b> <b>oil</b> supplementation. First, the C allele carriers showed a net difference of 7 % in FEV 1 between the placebo corn oil and <b>botanical</b> <b>oil</b> arms (Figure  3), and all 9 of them demonstrated their highest FEV 1 measurements while on the study botanical combination (Figure  4). In contrast, the A allele homozygotes showed no change in FEV 1 {{at any time during the}} course of the study. The 7 % difference in FEV 1 is comparable to the efficacy of montelukast seen in patients with mild persistent asthma with near-normal lung function (Barnes et al. 2001).|$|E

30|$|Second, the granulocytes {{from the}} C allele carriers, but not {{those from the}} A allele homozygotes, showed a {{transient}} but significant, reduction in overall 5 -LO product formation in response to ionophore (Figure  5). In contrast to our preliminary dose-titration study, in which <b>botanical</b> <b>oil</b> effects on LT formation by granulocytes and basophils were compared to pre-treatment levels, the second study involved a corn oil placebo. Thus, we cannot exclude {{the possibility that the}} corn oil (containing relatively high levels of the omega- 6 PUFA, linoleic acid) could have altered LT generation so as to modify the evident effect of the botanicals. Indeed, this seemed to be the case for FEV 1, in which the difference was due to both an increase in FEV 1 with the botanical oils and a decrease in FEV 1 with the corn oil – an observation that was restricted to the C allele carriers (Figure  5 a). Since the effect of the botanicals was significant for total 5 -LO pathway products and for non-CysLTs (Figure  5), we suspect that the variant LTC 4 S allele may alter the response of the 5 -LO pathway to dietary omega- 3 and omega- 6 PUFAs in a manner independent of its primary function of conjugating LTA 4 to glutathione, perhaps from an epistatic effect.|$|E

The research was conducted in the Plant Protection Laboratory, Indonesian Industrial and Beverage Crops Research Institute, from March to November 2012. Botanical materials used were water extracts from Ageratum conyzoides leaves, Azadirachta indica seeds, and Allium sativum tubers, as well as oil from Reutalis trisperma, Syzygium aromaticum, and Andropogon nardus, with respective concentration of 0. 5 %. The insects test used was the 3 rd instar larvae generated in the laboratory. Preliminary testing of the repellency activity was performed used the multiple-choice method, while subsequent testing used the dual-choice method with the parameters of larvae number remains in each treatment until 72 hours. The insecticidal activity was conducted using residual method on the feed substitute, by calculating mortality rate of the test insects.

The micro-plot system reduced variability between testing sites typically seen in larger field trials and provided the opportunity to compare results of studies conducted under the same environmental conditions, saving both time and money by confining product application and tick sampling to a 0. 3 m diameter arena. By seeding the arenas with a known number of laboratory-raised blacklegged tick nymphs, I was able to further reduce the variability and improve product screening reproducibility across years. The products evaluated included CedarCide PCO Choice, EcoPCO® EC-X, Met 52 ® EC, EcoEXEMPT® IC 2, EcoSMART® Organic® Insecticide, Essentria™ IC 3, nootkatone, Progaea, Tick Guard, Tick Killz and Tick Stop.

40|$|Background: Over {{the past}} 30 years {{substantial}} {{progress has been}} made in the medical and surgical management of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Despite this progress, there is an increasing gap in mortality between patients with RA (1. 5 - 3. 0 fold risk) and the general population. This disparity is mainly attributable to cardiovascular disease (CVD) as the CVD risk is comparable in RA patients as to patients with diabetes mellitus. Although the reasons for this gap are not entirely clear, the traditional risk of abnormalities in lipid profiles appears to be enhanced by a chronic increase in inflammatory cytokines, resulting in accelerated atherosclerosis. Study Objective: The object of this study was to determine the effect of marine (fish <b>oil)</b> and <b>botanical</b> <b>oils</b> (borage oil) on lipids (TC, HDL, LDL, TG), a risk factor for cardiovascular disease in patients with RA. The main outcome (to be presented elsewhere) was to determine whether a combination of borage seed oil rich in gammalinolenic acid (GLA) and fish oil rich in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is superior to either oil alone for the treatment of RA. Population and Setting: The study was an 18 month randomized, double-masked comparison of borage seed oil, fish oil, and the combination of both oils in RA patients with active synovitis. Intervention: Patients received 3. 5 gm omega- 3 fatty acids daily in a 2. 1 gm EPA/ 1. 4 gm DHA ratio (7 fish oil and 6 sunflower oil capsules daily); or 1. 8 gm /d GLA (6 borage oil and 7 sunflower oil capsules /d); or 7 fish oil and 6 borage oil capsules daily (combination therapy). Discussion: Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease. Mediators of inflammation and prothrombotic factors contribute to endothelial dysfunction and development of cardiovascular disease in RA patients. Marine and <b>botanical</b> <b>oils</b> represent an excellent primary or secondary therapy for improvement of the cardiovascular risk management in RA. Patients taking these oils exhibit significant additional reductions in total and LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, the TC/HDL ratio, and in the atherogenic index, and experience a significant increase in HDL-cholesterol. All of these improvements in the lipid profile were seen after 9 months of therapy, and increased after 18 months of oils administration. The overall dropout rate was 51 %, and was similar across groups: 25 in the borage oil group, 28 in the fish oil group, and 22 in the combination group. Reasons for dropout were mainly gastrointestinal distress (belching, bloating, diarrhea, nausea, cramping), or an inability to swallow the large number of rather sizable capsules. This can be ameliorated by freezing the capsules and reducing their size. Among those evaluated for this study, compliance was 100 %, assessed by pill counts. Learning Outcome: All treatments were safe, thus treatment of RA patients with one or a combination of these or similar oils should prove useful for reduction of cardiovascular risk in RA patients...|$|R

We evaluated the compatibility of I. fumosorosea blastospores with a range of spray oils and copper-based fungicides registered for use in citrus groves. Results of laboratory and greenhouse tests showed a range of responses of the fungus to the different materials, including compatibility and incompatibility.

It will also be helpful to avoid heavy expenses being spent on the import of pesticides. The focus of the project was to provide a secure IPM protocol to the farmers for the easy and organic control of stored grains insect pests, at farm level. For this purpose, oils of Acorus calamus (Sweet flag), Azadirachta indica (Neem) and Ricinus communis (Castor) were applied individually and as combinations in various concentrations @ 15 - 18 ml solution per sq. ft. area of the jute/cotton bags of different densities. Infestation free wheat was packed in respective treated bags and stored under prevailing ambient conditions of the flourmills. Antixenotic and antibiotic effects of the <b>botanical</b> <b>oils</b> were determined at different storage intervals i. e. 30, 60 and 90 days against Rhizopertha dominica, Sitophilus granarius, Tribolium castaneum and Trogoderma granarium. Statistical examination of the data regarding percent mortality and population build up of the target insects has indicated that different concentrations, storage periods and packing materials have a momentous effect on the insects mortality and their penetration into the bags. Degree of antixenosis and antibiosis has a linear correlation with the concentration of the oils but inversely with the storage periods. Moreover, penetration into the bags was inversely but the mortality was directly proportional to the density of the packing materials. It was observed that fine packing material with 20 % concentration, Neem oil conferred 90 %, sweet flag oil 94 % and castor oil 82 % mortality up to one month. Afterwards a gradient decrease in percent mortality was found in second and third months. Whereas, mixture of three oils in 10 % concentration of each exhibited 100, 95. 55, and 91. 55 % mortality for 30, 60 and 90 days respectively, in cotton bags, having mesh size of 0. 1 x 0. 1 mm. Farinographic studies indicated non significant differences on the water absorption of the dough made from the respective flours of the treatments and the control. Furthermore, sensory evaluation established that there was no distinguishable taste or taint found in the chapatties made from the respective flours of the treatments and the control. It is concluded that oils of Acorus calamus, Azadirachta indica and Ricinus communis are effective, with the selected dosage levels, to save the stored grains from insect pests, the food from toxic residues and the environment from chemical pollution. Mixture of three oils in 10 % concentration showed a better performance than the rest of treatments. Therefore, packing of the cleaned wheat in new treated bags with selected <b>botanical</b> <b>oils</b> and proper sealing thereof can, certainly, provide better results for the safe storage of food grains. An addition of some appropriate IPM practices may also be a supplement for the accomplishment of the suggested insect pests control measure...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate <b>botanical</b> <b>oils,</b> mineral oils and an insecticide that contained azadirachtin (ICA) for the control of Hypothenemus hampei, in addition to the effects of residual castor oil. We evaluated the effectiveness of the vegetable oils of canola, sunflower, corn, soybean and castor, two mineral oils (assist(r) and naturol(r)), and the ICA for the control of H. hampei. The compounds were tested at a concentration of 3. 0 % (v v- 1). The median lethal concentration (LC 50) was estimated with Probit analysis. The oil of castor bean and extract of castor bean cake were also evaluated at concentrations of 3. 0 % (v v- 1) and 3. 0 % (m v- 1), respectively. The mortality rates for H. hampei caused by the ICA and the castor oil were 40. 8 and 53. 7 %, with LC 50 values of 6. 71 and 3. 49 % (v v- 1), respectively. In the castor oil, the methyl esters of the fatty acids were palmitic (1. 10 %), linoleic (4. 50 %), oleic (4. 02 %), stearic (0. 50 %) and ricinoleic acids (88. 04 %). The extract of the castor bean cake was not toxic to H. hampei. The persistence of the castor oil in the environment was low, and the cause of mortality for H. hampei was most likely the blockage of the spiracles, which prevented the insects from breathing...|$|R
30|$|In this contribution, we {{have studied}} the effect of sulfur {{concentration}} on the morphology of carbon nanofibers {{with the use of}} natural precursor: Turpentine oil, a carbon feedstock, ferrocene as catalyst and sulfur as promoting agent. This is the first report of synthesis of carbon nanofiber from a <b>botanical</b> hydrocarbon: Turpentine <b>oil</b> using sulfur as a promoter by a simple, viable, and cost-effective spray pyrolysis method.|$|R
2500|$|Once {{their day}} {{activities}} were over, Hotelito Desconocido offered a spa service using aromatherapy or stone therapy (through the alternation of warm river rocks and cool marbles stones). The {{part of the}} hotel where the open-air spa was offered was known as [...] "El Mundo de la Salud" [...] (English: The World of Health). Baths were also offered, and they included local ingredients like sea salt and <b>botanical</b> essential <b>oils</b> for skin care. The water used in the spas and baths was heated through the solar-powered panels the hotel had on its roofs. Each room was non-smoking and equipped with small battery-powered fans. The restrooms were open-air and had walls made of bamboo covered in indigenous mud. Frames on the walls were made of unfinished tree trunks. Other furniture and decorations were rustic Mexican-styled.|$|R
40|$|The {{volatile}} leaf oils of Eucalyptus kochii subsp. kochii, E. kochii subsp. plenissima, and Eucalyptus oleosa var. borealis, potential Western Australian {{candidates for}} commercial eucalyptus oil production, {{were analyzed by}} means of GC, GC/MS, and IR. The three taxa were found to produce similar but distinctive individual distributions of leaf oil terpenoids. This supports their close <b>botanical</b> relationship. The <b>oils</b> consist mainly of monoterpenoids, with 1, 8 -cineole dominating {{to the extent of}} 80 - 90 %. Approximately 55 other components were detected. The oils of Eucalyptus globulus and Eucalyptus kondininensis were studied also...|$|R
30|$|The {{ability of}} {{inflammatory}} cells to generate leukotrienes {{is influenced by}} polymorphisms in genes involved in leukotriene synthesis (Sampson et al. 2000). Of particular interest is a common A to C single nucleotide polymorphism located 444 base pairs upstream of the gene encoding leukotriene C 4 synthase (LTC 4 S A- 444 C, rs 730012). The dominant variant C allele of the gene for LTC 4 synthase {{has been associated with}} an increase in cysteinyl LT production, reduced lung function and increased effectiveness of LT receptor antagonists against bronchoconstriction in asthma (Sampson et al. 2000; Silverman et al. 1998; Tantisira and Drazen 2009). To our knowledge, no studies have examined whether the LTC 4 S variant allele has an impact on the efficacy of PUFA supplementation on physiologic outcomes associated with asthma. Hence we hypothesized that dietary supplementation with the <b>botanical</b> seed <b>oil</b> combination would improve airflow obstruction in asthmatics when compared to placebo, preferentially in those who carried the variant C allele at the LTC 4 S A- 444 C locus.|$|R
40|$|The {{foodstuff}} pests are {{a global}} issue and {{cause of the}} loss of huge quantities of food worldwide. Currently, their control mainly relies on synthetic insecticides, which, however, are not environmentally sustainable and may affect human health. Thus, alternative eco-friendly and safe practices, are strongly encouraged. Recently, strong efforts are being made to identify and characterize natural products with insecticidal and/or repellent activity against insect pests. Those products defined biopesticides are a broad group that include, <b>botanicals</b> (essential <b>oils</b> and vegetal extracts), natural inert dusts as well as microorganisms derived compounds. Generally, their low toxicity, no residues in food, high efficacy at low concentrations make the use of biopesticides highly promising. Currently, the relatively high cost and the variability of effectiveness make biopesticides a niche product in the insecticide market. However, new formulation strategies are being evaluated and, even if it is unlikely that biopesticides will replace chemical food protection within the next years, it is certain that the number of biopesticides-based products will increase and the costs will fall guaranteeing an increasing place in the market for them for the foreseeable future...|$|R
