5000|$|Cutting Tools: It is good {{procedure}} {{to keep the}} cutting tool sharp to minimize tissue damage and clean from dirt and other substances to avoid the spread of disease. A good knife for general grafting should have a blade and handle length of about 3 inches and 4 inches respectively. Specialized knives for grafting include <b>bud-grafting</b> knives, surgical knives, and pruning knives. Cleavers, chisels, and saws are utilized when the stock is too large to be cut otherwise.|$|E
50|$|Kajang as {{a modern}} town owes its rise in {{particular}} to the coffee estates which were opened up around it in the 1890s. One of the famous coffee estates were Inch Kenneth Estate managed by the Kindersley brothers who {{were among the first}} to plant rubber in the country on a commercial basis. Another was Perang Besar (Great War) Estate, opened by some British ex-servicemen led by Colonel Henry Gough, who was the pioneer of <b>bud-grafting</b> of rubber trees in the country.|$|E
40|$|A two-year {{field study}} was {{conducted}} to examine the capacity of spontaneous formation of long sylleptic shoots (LSS) in nursery trees of pear cvs. 'Abbé Fétel', 'Conference' and 'Starking Delicious' grafted on Quince MA (MA) and Quince BA 29 (BA 29) rootstocks in a nursery during the first year after bud grafting. Tree height (TH), trunk diameter (TD) - 10 cm above the bud union and number of LSS were measured {{at the end of each}} season. The TH was measured from the ground level. The highest number of LSS was developed by cv. 'Abbé Fétel' in both the seasons, and the lowest by cv. 'Starking Delicious'. Tree height and TD were highly significantly affected by the cultivar in both the years and by the rootstock in 2008. The interactions between them did not significantly affect the examined parameters. The study showed that the early growth and syllepsis of pear nursery trees during the first year after <b>bud-grafting</b> were incomparably more affected by the cultivar than by the rootstock under similar weather conditions and on the same soil in a crop rotation system...|$|E
40|$|A {{disorder}} {{causing the}} cracking of bark {{in the lower}} trunk region of seedlings and in the root stock of <b>bud-grafted</b> trees of Hevea brasiliensis was observed recently. A preliminary investigation was carried {{out for the first}} time to study the occurrence, symptoms, its relationship to the genotype of clones or seedlings, age and growth of trees. The observations were that, this disorder appears only after about three years of establishment and reaches a high percentage in about seven years and is completely absent in bud wood nurseries. <b>Bud-grafted</b> trees with the disorder had a greater girth than those unaffected. The genotype of the scion in <b>bud-grafted</b> trees did not have a significant influence on the occurrence of this disorder. The nature and the symptoms of this disorder do not show the involvement of a pathogen of, but secondary infections may be the reason for bark decay around cracks. The information gathered so far points to an inherited physiological disorder that appears at maturity affecting both root stocks in <b>bud-grafted</b> trees and the lower trunk region in seedlings. Key words: bark cracking, physiological disorder, root stock, graft unio...|$|R
40|$|The two spotted {{spider mite}} Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae) {{is a major}} pest of citrus in Spain. Commercial citrus plants are always {{propagated}} asexually by <b>bud-grafting</b> onto a seedling rootstock. During the last 70 years, millions of citrus trees grafted on sour orange have been destroyed because of Citrus tristeza virus (CTV). Therefore other rootstocks are nowadays predominant. The {{aim of this study}} was to asses the influence of the rootstock on selected life history parameters of T. urticae. Mites were reared on leaves of Citrus unshiu trees grafted on six different rootstocks: sour orange, Troyer citrange, trifoliate orange, Volkamer lemon, Alemow and Cleopatra mandarin. Some parameters (sex ratio, egg hatching and survival) were not affected by the rootstock, whereas many other important ones were (fecundity, oviposition rate, lifespan and development time). These differences may explain the diversity found in the selected life history parameters (net fecundity, generation time and intrinsic rate of increase, r m). Sour orange appeared as the worst rootstock for T. urticae (r m = 0. 140). It was closely followed by Troyer citrange and trifoliate orange (6 % and 9 % increase in r m, respectively), then by Alemow (35. 3 % increase in r m), Volkamer lemon (77. 6 % increase in r m) and finally Cleopatra mandarin which yielded an r m 89. 1 % higher than sour orange. These results can explain, at least partially, the increasing prevalence of T. urticae as a pest in Spanish citrus orchards. Furthermore, problems could become much more severe on salt-tolerant rootstocks because of global warming, which is expected to exacerbate the threat of salinity, especially in areas with a semi-arid climate. © 2010 Elsevier B.
