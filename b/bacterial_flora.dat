5|$|Originally Aristotle divided {{all living}} things between plants, which {{generally}} do not move fast enough for humans to notice, and animals. In Linnaeus' system, these became the kingdoms Vegetabilia (later Plantae) and Animalia. Since then, {{it has become clear}} that the Plantae as originally defined included several unrelated groups, and the fungi and several groups of algae were removed to new kingdoms. However, these are still often considered plants in many contexts. Bacterial life is sometimes included in flora, and some classifications use the term <b>bacterial</b> <b>flora</b> separately from plant flora.|$|E
5|$|Many {{commonly}} used antibiotics, such as metronidazole or the macrolides, will greatly increase {{the effect of}} warfarin by reducing the metabolism of warfarin in the body. Other broad-spectrum antibiotics can {{reduce the amount of}} the normal <b>bacterial</b> <b>flora</b> in the bowel, which make significant quantities of vitamin K1, thus potentiating the effect of warfarin. In addition, food that contains large quantities of vitamin K1 will reduce the warfarin effect. Thyroid activity also appears to influence warfarin dosing requirements; hypothyroidism (decreased thyroid function) makes people less responsive to warfarin treatment, while hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) boosts the anticoagulant effect. Several mechanisms have been proposed for this effect, including changes in the rate of breakdown of clotting factors and changes in the metabolism of warfarin.|$|E
5|$|When {{used for}} short periods, {{linezolid}} {{is a relatively}} safe drug. Common side effects of linezolid use (those occurring in more than 1% of people taking linezolid) include diarrhea (reported by 3–11% of clinical trial participants), headache (1–11%), nausea (3–10%), vomiting (1–4%), rash (2%), constipation (2%), altered taste perception (1–2%), and discoloration of the tongue (0.2–1%). Fungal infections such as thrush and vaginal candidiasis may also occur as linezolid suppresses normal <b>bacterial</b> <b>flora</b> and opens a niche for fungi (so-called antibiotic candidiasis). Less common (and potentially more serious) adverse effects include allergic reactions, pancreatitis, and elevated transaminases, which {{may be a sign}} of liver damage. Unlike some antibiotics, such as erythromycin and the quinolones, linezolid has no effect on the QT interval, a measure of cardiac electrical conduction. Adverse effects in children are similar to those that occur in adults.|$|E
40|$|The risk of {{infections and}} the {{appearance}} of symptoms (e. g., odors) represent the main troubles resulting frommalignant wounds. The aim {{of this study was to}} characterize the balance of <b>bacterial</b> <b>floras</b> and the relationships between biofilms and bac-teria and the emergence of symptoms. Experimental research was carried out for 42 days onmalignant wounds associated with breast cancer. Investigations of <b>bacterial</b> <b>floras</b> (aerobes, aero-anaerobes, and anaerobes), detection of the presence of biofilms by microscopic epifluorescence, and clinical assessment were performed. We characterized biofilms in 32 malignant wounds associated with breast cancer and <b>bacterial</b> <b>floras</b> in 25 such wounds. Amixed group of floras, composed of 54 different bacterial types, was identified, with an average number per patient of 3. 6 aerobic species and 1. 7 anaerobic species; the presence of strict anaerobic bacterial strains was evidenced in 70 % of the wounds; biofilm was observed in 35 % of the cases. Odor was a reliable indicator of colonization by anaerobes, even when this symptomwas not directly linked to any of the identified anaerobic bacte-ria. Bacteria are more likely to be present during myelosuppression and significantly increase the emergence of odors and pain when present at amounts of> 105 · g 1. The presence of biofilms was not associated with clinical signs or with precise types of bacteria. No infections occurred during the 42 -day evaluation period. This study provides a dynamic description of the <b>bacterial</b> <b>floras</b> of tumoral wounds. The study results highlight the absolute need for new therapeutic options that are effective for use on circulating bacteria as well as on bacteria organized in biofilm.

In conclusion, authors found that rhinoplasty surgical field is not sterile and continuously exposed to <b>bacterial</b> <b>floras</b> of perinasal skin and nasal cavity. Chlorhexidine pretreatment shows some effect in decreasing the number of S. aureus and Corynebacterium on the perinasal skin but its effect on the prevention of postoperative infection needs further study.|$|R
25|$|Opportunistic {{activity}} by combinations of otherwise normal <b>bacterial</b> <b>flora,</b> such as aerobic streptococci, Neisseria, Actinomyces, spirochetes, and Bacteroides species can prolong the ulcerative process. Fungal causes include Coccidioides immitis (valley fever), Cryptococcus neoformans (cryptococcosis), and Blastomyces dermatitidis ("North American Blastomycosis").

25|$|Fecal bacteriotherapy, {{also known}} as a stool transplant, is {{approximately}} 85% to 90% effective in those for whom antibiotics have not worked. It involves infusion of <b>bacterial</b> <b>flora</b> acquired from the feces of a healthy donor to reverse the bacterial imbalance responsible for the recurring nature of the infection. The procedure replaces normal, healthy colonic flora that had been wiped out by antibiotics, and re-establishes resistance to colonization by Clostridium difficile. Side effects, at least initially, are few.|$|E
25|$|Probiotics are {{bacterial}} preparations that {{alter the}} <b>bacterial</b> <b>flora</b> in the bowel {{to cause a}} beneficial effect. Animal {{research has demonstrated that}} probiotics have barrier enhancing, antibacterial, immune modulating and anti-inflammatory effects which may have a positive effect in the management of SIBO in humans. Lactobacillus casei {{has been found to be}} effective in improving breath hydrogen scores after 6 weeks of treatment presumably by suppressing levels of a small intestinal bacterial overgrowth of fermenting bacteria. The multi-strain preparation VSL#3 was found to be effective in suppressing SIBO. Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus casei have all demonstrated effectiveness in the treatment and management of SIBO. Conversely, Lactobacillus fermentum and Saccharomyces boulardii have been found to be ineffective. A combination of Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus rhamnosus has been found to be effective in suppressing bacterial overgrowth of abnormal gas producing organisms in the small intestine.|$|E

40|$|During {{the past}} year five {{patients}} from countries in the Middle East admitted to a burns unit were found to harbour a strain of Staphylococcus aureus with unusual multi-resistance to antibiotics. The admission of the first patient was followed by an outbreak of infection with this strain involving ten patients in the unit. In addition five staff members {{were found to be}} nasal carriers of the strain. As a result of this incident, the following four patients admitted to the unit were isolated on admission and the spread of their strans was thus prevented. It is recommended that patients on admission to burns units, or similar departments with patients very susceptible to infection, are isolated until their <b>bacterial</b> <b>floras</b> have been examined...|$|R
40|$|Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) or {{trimethoprim}} (TMP) {{alone was}} given on a random double-blind basis to 26 {{young women to}} treat urinary tract infections.

2500|$|Fecal bacteriotherapy {{involves}} {{the infusion of}} human probiotics through fecal enemas. Ulcerative colitis typically requires a more prolonged bacteriotherapy treatment than Clostridium difficile infection to be successful, possibly due to {{the time needed to}} heal the ulcerated epithelium. The response of ulcerative colitis is potentially very favorable with one study reporting 67.7% of sufferers experiencing complete remission. It suggests that the cause of ulcerative colitis may be a previous infection by a still unknown pathogen. This initial infection resolves itself naturally, but somehow causes an imbalance in the colonic <b>bacterial</b> <b>flora,</b> leading to a cycle of inflammation which can be broken by [...] "recolonizing" [...] the colon with bacteria from a healthy bowel. There have been several reported cases of patients who have remained in remission for up to 13 years.|$|E
2500|$|The use of {{systemic}} antibiotics, including (but not limited to) any penicillin-based antibiotic such as ampicillin, cephalosporins, and clindamycin, causes the normal <b>bacterial</b> <b>flora</b> of the bowel to be altered. In particular, when the antibiotic kills off other competing {{bacteria in the}} intestine, any bacteria remaining will have less competition for space and nutrients. The net effect is to permit more extensive growth than normal of certain bacteria. Clostridium difficile is one such type of bacterium. In addition to proliferating in the bowel, C. difficile also produces toxins. Without either toxin A or toxin B, C. difficile may colonize the gut, but is unlikely to cause pseudomembranous colitis. The colitis associated with severe infection {{is part of an}} inflammatory reaction, with the [...] "pseudomembrane" [...] formed by a viscous collection of inflammatory cells, fibrin, and necrotic cells.|$|E

40|$|Administration of {{antimicrobial}} agent {{is the most}} frequent and significant cause of modifications to gastrointestinal bacterial microflora. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the impact on Gram-negative aerobic <b>bacterial</b> intestinal <b>flora,</b> the possible colonization of Candida spp. and the possible emergence of resistant bacterial strains in a ten rats group receiving levofloxacin at the dosage of 10 mg/kg one a day for 5 consecutive days. Our result are in agreement with those of other studies and the reveal that Gram-negative aerobic bacteria are strongly suppressed during levofloxacin treatment. Neither colonization by Candida spp. nor emergence of resistant micro-organism to levofloxacin were observed. After 7 days from completing treatment, <b>bacterial</b> intestinal <b>flora</b> was restored in 8 out of 9 rats. Levofloxacin does not significantly affect intestinal microflora.

40|$|AbstractTo {{study the}} effect of air {{pollution}} on the microecology of the respiratory tracts {{and the relationship of}} the biotopes with respiratory diseases, Wistar rats exposed to mixed air pollutants were used as poisoning models. The <b>bacterial</b> <b>floras</b> of respiratory tract were analyzed as well as expression of pro-inflammatory mediators of the respiratory epithelium. The mRNA and protein expression levels of pro-inflammatory factor and cytokines measured showed that there were significant changes in the microbiocenosis of the respiratory tract. The microorganisms underwent quantitative and qualitative changes following exposure to mixed air pollutants including a decline of indigenous microflora and increase of the content of conditionally pathogenic microorganisms. These changes depended on the degree of air pollution severity. Measurement of pro-inflammatory factors CC 16, TNF-α and IL- 6 revealed a similar time-dependent relationship between the content of conditionally pathogenic microorganisms and the interference of CC 16 secretion, as well as up-expression of TNF-α and IL- 6...|$|R

This organ by becoming the breeding place for poisonous microbes, the fertile cause for the debility that comes with old age, and the death that cuts off many a career of normal course is not nearly run." [...] "Acids are the best antiseptics; they have been used from time immemorial as preservatives; pickles are persevered with vinegar, acidic acid, and when milk is allowed to sour under proper conditions, the germs of putrefaction are destroyed or their activity inhibited, and it keeps a considerable time. How can acids be applied so as to control the <b>bacterial</b> <b>flora</b> of the large intestine? Not in the ordinary way because, when administered through the mouth, they are used up long before they can penetrate the colon. The brilliant idea occurred to Prof. Metchnikoff of the administering acid-producing germs which might work their way through the digestive system, and, reaching the large intestine, produce the acid required. After much experimenting, the bacillus of Massol, Bacillus Bulgaricus was adopted as the most suitable." ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Bacterial</b> <b>floras</b> {{isolated}} from eggs, skin, gills, and intestines {{have been described}} for {{a limited number of}} fish species. Generally, the range of bacterial genera isolated is related to the aquatic habitat of the fish and varies with factors such as the salinity of the habitat and the bacterial load in the water. In many investigations, identification of isolates to the genus level only makes it difficult to determine the precise relationships of aquatic and fish microfloras. Bacteria recovered from the skin and gills may be transient rather than resident on the fish surfaces. Microfloras of fish intestines appear to vary with the complexity of the fish digestive system. The genera present in the gut generally seem to be those from the environment or diet which can survive and multiply in the intestinal tract, although there is evidence for a distinct intestinal microflora in some species. While obligate anaerobes have been recovered from carp and tilapia intestines, low ambient temperatures may prevent colonization by anaerobes in species such as rainbow trout...|$|R
