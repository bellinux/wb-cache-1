For the order to be a commercial success, Ercol perfected the steam <b>bending</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> in large quantities. The wood selected was English elm - a wood previously thought impossible to bend because it distorted. Ercol's innovation meant the chair could be assembled from fourteen pre-formed components, and mechanisation meant that a chair could be made every twenty seconds.|$|E
5000|$|From {{the very}} {{beginning}} of his career Alvar Aalto experimented with materials, especially wood, and even applied for patents for the <b>bending</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> as applied in his furniture designs and as acoustic screens in his buildings. The Aaltos designed several different types of furniture and lamps for the Paimio Sanatorium (1929-33). The best known of the furniture pieces is his cantilevered birch wood Paimio Chair, which was specifically designed for tuberculosis patients to sit in for long hours each day. Aalto argued that the angle {{of the back of the}} chair was the perfect angle for the patient to breathe most easily. The design of the chair may have been influenced by Marcel Breuer's metal Wassily Chair, though Aalto was generally negative towards metal furniture. [...] The degree of bending of the wood tested the technical limits of that time. The chair is part of the permanent collections at the MoMA in New York City and the Finnish Design Museum.|$|E

5000|$|The word [...] "cooper" [...] {{is derived}} from Middle Dutch or Middle Low German kūper 'cooper' from kūpe 'cask', in turn from Latin cupa 'tun, barrel'. Everything a cooper {{produces}} is referred to collectively as cooperage. A cask is any piece of cooperage containing a bouge, bilge, or bulge {{in the middle of}} the container. A barrel is a type of cask, so the terms [...] "barrel-maker" [...] and [...] "barrel-making" [...] refer to just one aspect of a cooper's work. The facility in which casks are made is also referred to as a cooperage. [...] There were four divisions in the cooper's craft. The [...] "dry" [...] or [...] "slack" [...] cooper made containers that would be used to ship dry goods such as cereals, nails, tobacco, fruits, and vegetables. The [...] "dry-tight" [...] cooper made casks designed to keep dry goods in and moisture out. Gunpowder and flour casks are examples of a dry-tight cooper's work. The [...] "white" [...] cooper made straight-staved containers like washtubs, buckets, and butter churns, which would hold water and other liquids but did not allow shipping of the liquids. Usually there was no <b>bending</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> involved in white cooperage. The [...] "wet" [...] or [...] "tight" [...] cooper made casks for long-term storage and transportation of liquids that could even be under pressure, as with beer. The [...] "general" [...] cooper worked on ships, on the docks, and in warehouses, and was responsible for cargo while in storage or transit. With a specialized skill, the general cooper could repair a broken stave without losing the contents of a cask.|$|E

40|$|Woodworking often {{requires}} the wood {{to be bent}} into different shapes. In {{view of the fact}} that macrosonic waves compress and expand the medium through which they are being propagated we assumed that wood subjected to the action of these waves during the bending process would have enhanced plasticity as a result of the loosening-up that takes place in it, as well as of the reduction in effort. To this effect, the <b>bending</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> plasticized in a macrosonic field was studied. This bending took place under good conditions, and structural analyses conducted with the aid of an electron microscope proved initial premises to be corrent. Applied on an industrial scale, this procedure would contribute to improving the technology of wood bending as well as to eliminating factory spoilage...|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} {{of different types}} of knots and fiber deviations on the <b>bending</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood,</b> as managed using visual grading standards, was analytically discussed in this research by means of the finite element method. The effect of each geometrical variable on the strength and stress distribution has been studied individually. This was accomplished after validating a previously presented finite element model that accounted for the three-dimensional shape of the knots and fiber deviations. The simulated sizes and positions were those commonly managed by the standards for strength grading. The research presents the effect of: (1) the size and position of cylindrical face knots; (2) size and position of truncated conical face knots; (3) size and position of shallow conical face knots; (4) size and position of conical edge knots; (5) inclination of face knots. In each case, the analytical predictions of the modulus of rupture and stress distribution are detailed.

40|$|Wood is the {{ultimate}} renewable material. It possesses qualities that have made it a material of choice for millennia, these qualities further enhanced by its recognised carbon sequestration. However, as a biological material it suffers the same fate as any natural material, namely degradation. There are ways in which wood can be enhanced, including eco-friendly methods. One of the emerging eco-friendly methods is the combined use of temperature, moisture and mechanical action – so-called Thermo-Hydro-Mechanical (THM) treatments. THM processing can improve the intrinsic properties of wood, to produce new materials and to acquire a form and functionality desired by engineers without changing its eco-friendly characteristics. There are numerous THM processing techniques {{and the number of}} these processes is growing continuously. THM processing can be divided into two major categories; Thermo-Hydral treatments (TH) and Thermo-Hydro-Mechanical treatments (THM). TH is usually used to enhance wood properties, and is of importance in increasing stress relaxation during drying under high temperature, in the formation of wood-based composites or veneer products and in the artificial ageing of wood. THM on the other hand, is employed in the producing of new materials by densification, shaping by moulding, welding of wood by friction, embossment, <b>bending</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood,</b> wood fusion, and chip-less manufacturing. During THM treatment, wood undergoes large deformation, stress relaxation and chemical degradation, but with strong shape memory depending on parameters like temperature, moisture content, applied forces, processing time and the type of wood. Several TH and THM processes have recently been developed in Europe, Japan, the USA and Canada, but only some of them have been scaled-up industrially. However, to overcome the problems associated with TH/THM wood during processing at the laboratory scale, during scale up and controlling the end use properties, a detailed knowledge of these phenomena becomes important. This requires a close collaboration between experts in wood chemistry, wood mechanics and material science from both academia and from industry. With this report we would like to give a brief state-of-the-art of the important field of THM-processing. The aim of this work has not been to cover the complete field of THM-processing, just give an introduction...|$|E

Moisture transport is presumed to obey the diffusion equation with constant coefficients, such that moisture transport can be directly related to the <b>bending</b> <b>of</b> the board.

Derived diffusion coefficients are in good agreement with values in literature. Furthermore, a scaling law for the deflection of the board is proposed, which is seen to be followed qualitatively but not quantitatively by experiments. Finally, by assuming the deflection of the board to be the response of a linear system, the deflective frequency response of the board can be predicted from its step response. The results allow upscaling of deflection and expansion, such that behavior of thick boards can be determined from an experiment using a thin board...|$|R
