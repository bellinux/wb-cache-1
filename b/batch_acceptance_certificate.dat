In addition to demonstrating assay capability, IOD values {{can also be used}} to fulfill certification requirements of a high-volume forensic drug laboratory. The LOD was defined as the lowest concentration of drug that the laboratory can detect in a specimen with forensic certainty at a minimum of 85 % of the time. Overall <b>batch</b> <b>acceptance</b> criteria included acceptable quantitation of control materials (within 20 % of target), acceptable chromatography (symmetry, peak integration, peak shape, peak, and baseline resolution), retention time within + 1 % of the extracted standard, and mass ion ratios within • of the extracted standard mass ion ratios. Individual specimen acceptance criteria were the same as the <b>batch</b> <b>acceptance</b> criteria excluding the quantitation requirement. Data were collected from all instruments on different runs. A minimum of ten data points was required for each certified instrument, and a minimum of 85 % of data points was acceptable.

I make a proposal on how the clinical chemistry profession could tackle the challenges focused at the conceptual, technical, and organizational level. The profession should "rehearse'' the basic concepts of measurement, because {{they need to be}} understood before one can look for pragmatic solutions when a purist's approach cannot be realized in a foreseeable time. This is illustrated for the measurement of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). To solve problems encountered at the technical level of establishing reference measurement systems, in particular when this is not possible according to {{the point of view of}} purism, the profession should have the courage to agree on pragmatic solutions, without neglecting, however, the technical progress. This is exemplified by way of a solution for measurement of FT 4 in serum water and TSH. Because the technical question is also inseparably connected to the specification of the analytical quality required for measurements, I propose that the profession sets realistic specifications for calibration tolerance, limits for <b>batch</b> <b>acceptance,</b> linearity, etc. Last but not least, I call upon organizing and implementing the accuracy process with utmost care, i. e., in a concerted action with all parties involved in patient care.

40|$|Well known {{reasons for}} local {{failures}} in power transformers {{are caused by}} partial discharges (PD) in the electric insulation. Continuous deterioration over time increases the defect which finally {{can lead to a}} breakdown of the entire insulation. The importance of PD measurement is accommodated by standardized electrical measurement according to IEC 60270 [1] which is required for <b>acceptance</b> <b>certificates</b> at routine testing. Therefore, the apparent charge QIEC has become an important value for transformer quality. Since a couple of years, alternative measurement methods for PD are used. Originally developed for gas insulated systems [2], [3], ultra high frequency (UHF) measurement found its way into transformer diagnosis over the last years [4]. To become an accepted quality factor, UHF has to be proven a reliable testing method, which can bear up against electrical measurements. Therefore, the general physics of UHF PD has to be considered at first. Ultra-high-frequency antennas measure electromagnetic emissions of PD directly in-oil inside a transformer. It becomes apparent, that UHF measurement usually is advantageous concerning external disturbances. Compared to the electric measurement, the UHF method is robust against external signals [5], which makes it suitable for both, offsite measurement at routine testing under laboratory conditions with low ambient noise and onsite, e. g. after transportation and installation of transformers with usually high noise levels. These considerations make the UHF method interesting as supplement for transformer routine tests. Therefore, a sensor calibration or at least a validation of its sensitivity is required [6] comparable to the electrical measurement. To provide profound knowledge of the equipment, the antenna factor (AF) of the UHF sensor needs to be determined under inside-transformer conditions. This contribution shows the determination of the UHF sensor’s AF using a Gigahertz-Transversal-Electro-Magnetic Setup (GTEM cell). To meet inside-transformer conditions, an oil-filled GTEM cell is required for correct permittivity. Correction factors can then be introduced to minimize measurement errors and to establish better comparability of different UHF sensors. Hence, a standard test setup can be defined...|$|R

The bankability of CPV projects {{is an important issue}} to pave the way toward a swift and sustained growth in this technology. The bankability of a PV plant is generally addressed through the modeling of its energy yield under a baseline loss scenario, followed by an on-site measurement campaign aimed at verifying its energy performance. This paper proposes a procedure for assessing the performance of a CPV project, articulated around four main successive steps: Solar Resource Assessment, Yield Assessment, <b>Certificate</b> of Provisional <b>Acceptance,</b> and <b>Certificate</b> of Final <b>Acceptance.</b> This methodology allows the long-term energy production of a CPV project to be estimated with an associated uncertainty of ≈ 5 %. To our knowledge, no such method has been proposed to the CPV industry yet, and this critical situation has hindered or made impossible the completion of several important CPV projects undertaken in the world. The main motive for this proposed method is to bring a practical solution to this urgent problem. This procedure can be operated under a wide range of climatic conditions, and makes it possible to assess the bankability of a CPV plant whose design uses any of the technologies currently available on the market. The method is also compliant with both international standards and local regulations. In consequence, its applicability is both general and international...|$|R

40|$|Quality and {{productivity}} play {{significant role in}} today’s manufacturing market. From customers’ viewpoint quality is very important because the extent of quality of the procured item (or product) influences the degree of satisfaction of the consumers during usage of the procured goods. Therefore, every manufacturing or production unit should concern {{about the quality of}} the product. Apart from quality, there exists another criterion, called productivity which is directly related to the profit level and also goodwill of the organization. Every manufacturing industry aims at producing a large number of products within relatively lesser time. But it is felt that reduction in manufacturing time may cause severe quality loss. In order to embrace these two conflicting criteria it is necessary to check quality level of the item either on-line or off-line. The purpose is to check whether quality lies within desired tolerance level which can be accepted by the customers. Quality of a product can be described by various quality attributes. The attributes may be quantitative or qualitative. In on-line quality control controller and related equipments are provided with the job under operation and continuously the quality is being monitored. If quality falls down the expected level the controller supplies a feedback in order to reset the process environment. In off-line quality control the method is either to check the quality of few products from a <b>batch</b> or lot (<b>acceptance</b> sampling) or to evaluate the best process environment capable of producing desired quality product. This invites optimization problem which seeks identification of the best process condition or parametric combination for the said manufacturing process. If the problem is related to a single quality attribute then it is called single objective (or response) optimization. If more than one attribute comes into consideration it is very difficult to select the optimal setting which can achieve all quality requirements simultaneously. Otherwise optimizing one quality feature may lead severe quality loss to other quality characteristics which may not be accepted by the customers. In order to tackle such a multi-objective optimization problem, the present study applied extended Taguchi method through a case study in straight turning of mild viii steel bar using HSS tool. The study aimed at evaluating the best process environment which could simultaneously satisfy requirements of both quality and as well as productivity with special emphasis on reduction of cutting tool flank wear. Because reduction in flank wear ensures increase in tool life. The predicted optimal setting ensured minimization of surface roughness, height of flank wear of the cutting tool and maximization of MRR (Material Removal Rate). In view of the fact, that traditional Taguchi method cannot solve a multi-objective optimization problem; to overcome this limitation grey relational theory has been coupled with Taguchi method. Furthermore to follow the basic assumption of Taguchi method i. e. quality attributes should be uncorrelated or independent. But is practical case it may not be so. To overcome this shortcoming the study applied Principal Component analysis (PCA) to eliminate response correlation that exists between the responses and to evaluate independent or uncorrelated quality indices called Principal Components. Finally the study combined PCA, grey analysis, utility concept and Taguchi method for predicting the optimal setting. Optimal result was verified through confirmatory test. This indicates application feasibility of the aforesaid techniques for correlated multi-response optimization and off-line quality control in turning operation...|$|R
