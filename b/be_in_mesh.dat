Their advantage over the helical gears is that the side-thrust of one half is balanced by that of the other half. This means that herringbone gears can be used in torque gearboxes without requiring a substantial thrust bearing. Because of this herringbone gears were an important step in the introduction of the steam turbine to marine propulsion.|$|E

It explores the meaning of values by using 2 ̆ 2 preferences and priorities 2 ̆ 2 and by differentiating values from other closely related concepts such as ethics, attitudes,needs, and morals. It also highlights some important evolving value patterns pertaining to customers, organizations,and employees belongs to three generations: Boomers, Generation X, and Generation Y. Another interesting aspect of the article is the exploration of evidence with regard to impact of values as an independent, moderator, and dependent variable on management practices and employee 2 ̆ 7 s behavior and performance. This review is supported by the fact that how the knowledge about degree of intensity and relative importance of value orientations can be used by managers and decision-makers. The discussion of implications of values for practicing managers is also supplemented by the arguments that 2 ̆ 2 values can be modified 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 values should not always <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>mesh</b> in organizations 2 ̆ 2.

In order to restore nutrient content wood ash has been suggested as a fertiliser. Ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi arc involved in the nutrient uptake of forest trees and this study investigates the influence of intensive harvesting and wood ash fertilisation on the external EM mycelium in forest soil. Nylon mesh bags filled with sand <b>were</b> buried <b>in</b> September 1997 in field plots which had or had not been intensively harvested. The effect of wood ash on the production of external EM mycelium <b>was</b> studied <b>in</b> <b>mesh</b> bags amended with wood ash. <b>Mesh</b> bags <b>were</b> retrieved <b>in</b> May and October 1998. The relative amount of fungal mycelia <b>in</b> the <b>mesh</b> bags <b>was</b> estimated with phospholipid fatty acid analysis. The fungi colonising the mesh bags were mainly (> 90 %) ectomycorrhizal. Fungal biomass <b>in</b> the <b>mesh</b> bags <b>was</b> low <b>in</b> the spring but high in the autumn. No significant effect on EM fungal biomass <b>was</b> observed <b>in</b> the <b>mesh</b> bags collected from intensively harvested plots compared with those from control plots, but wood ash amendment resulted in 2. 4 times more EM fungal biomass (P < 0. 05). The effect of external EM mycelium on the dissolution of wood ash <b>was</b> studied <b>in</b> <b>mesh</b> bags filled with wood ash, using <b>mesh</b> bags buried <b>in</b> soil isolated from roots as EM-free controls. The external EM mycelium had no effect on the dissolution rate of the wood ash. 80 % of the potassium was lost from the wood ash within a month, whereas no phosphorus was lost during the experimental period (up to 13 months).

Planetary gear sets are complex, multi-mesh systems formed by multiple stages of planet gears that <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>mesh</b> with a sun gear and {{a ring gear}} and they are held by a common carrier through needle bearings and planet pins. Their design presents unique challenges stemming {{from a number of}} load factors issues, including their planet load sharing behavior, dynamic response, deflections, and support conditions. This study investigates the influence of load factors on gear stresses, and their impact on the resultant bending fatigue lives of the gears in planetary gear sets.

40|$|This work {{presents}} a back-tracking procedure for the optimization of meshes.

Basically, the original <b>mesh</b> <b>is</b> reconstructed <b>in</b> regions around the ill-shaped elements by means of a set of deletion and reconstruction operations based on visibility tests. The back-tracking procedure xes problems related to the quality of generated <b>meshes</b> <b>in</b> general and can <b>be</b> applied <b>in</b> two or three dimensions. The procedure works by deleting elements ranked below a predened shape quality measure. It is important to mention that, although the presented procedure was devised for advancing-front algorithms, it can also <b>be</b> used <b>in</b> <b>meshes</b> generated by dierent approaches, such as Delaunay and others, requiring no modication.
