40|$|<b>Biogenic</b> <b>amines</b> (particularly {{histamine}} in {{the presence}} of putrescine and cadaverine) can lead to scombroid food poisoning if levels become too high. Low levels of these <b>biogenic</b> <b>amines</b> occur naturally, but high levels (FDA sets 50 ppm of histamine in fish as the maximum allowable level) can lead to scombroid poisoning. A number of analytical methods have been employed to analyze <b>biogenic</b> <b>amines,</b> especially High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).

50|$|Histidine decarboxylase (HDC) is {{an enzyme}} {{responsible}} for catalyzing the decarboxylation of histidine to form histamine.

Histidine decarboxylase is the sole member of the histamine synthesis pathway, producing histamine in a one-step reaction. Histamine cannot be generated by any other known enzyme. HDC is therefore {{the primary source of}} histamine in most mammals and eukaryotes. The enzyme employs a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) cofactor, in similarity to many amino acid decarboxylases. Eukaryotes, as well as gram-negative bacteria share a common HDC, while gram-positive bacteria employ an evolutionarily unrelated pyruvoyl-dependent HDC. In humans, histidine decarboxylase is encoded by the HDC gene.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike {{many types}} of food poisoning, scombroid form is not brought about by {{ingestion}} of a pathogen.

Histamine is not destroyed by normal cooking temperatures, so even properly cooked fish can still result in poisoning.
