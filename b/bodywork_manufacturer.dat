50|$|In {{the spring}} of 2007, Scania {{announced}} a collaboration with Finnish bus and coach <b>bodywork</b> <b>manufacturer</b> Lahden Autokori Oy ("Lahti") to build a series of semi-integral coaches known as Scania OmniExpress. Scania and Lahden Autokori had since 2001 collaborated on the low-entry city bus Lahti Scala, built on L94UB and later K UB chassis. A new production plant in Lahti was built for the new product line. From the beginning the OmniExpress was available in two heights; 3.40 and 3.60 metres, replacing Lahden Autokori's own models Lahti Falcon and Lahti Eagle. A pre-production batch was manufactured for demonstrators and selected customers in Finland and Sweden, with normal production beginning in late 2007.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{question}} How can {{the design of}} buses and systems of design for route bus bodywork manufacture reduce {{the negative effects of}} specification diversity? by examining the application of mass customisation processes to an area of bespoke production – the public route bus. The route bus is an essential element of the transport system providing cost efficient public transport, but route buses are manufactured to the specification of bus operators and this design may differ significantly from other bus operators whose supply of vehicles is from the same <b>bodywork</b> <b>manufacturer.</b> The bus <b>bodywork</b> <b>manufacturer</b> must accommodate this specification diversity. The present method for doing so is by means of bespoke production to ensure the bus meets the operator’s explicit specification, but this process is time consuming and expensive in design and manufacture. Where diversity is accommodated by bespoke manufacturing there are functional benefits to the bus operator and passenger, however there are negative consequences in manufacture. This research set out to determine methods of reducing the repercussions of specification diversity; vehicle cost, design and engineering time, and production efficiency. This was achieved by generating physical designs and design methods balancing the bus operators’ access to a suitable product and the manufacturer’s ability to increase efficiency and quality of that product. The research methods explored mass customisation theories through product design experiments. This method required seeking out theoretical perspectives on the research problem and bringing them to bear on two studio experiments – the design of a driver’s area and a bus interior to meet the requirements of all stakeholders in bus transport. The research resulted in four critical interventions to the present bespoke manufacturing methodology, establishing means of reducing the negative impacts of specification diversity in route bus design. The four interventions are demonstrated {{in the development of a}} bus driver’s area and a suite of bus interior components. The bus driver’s area has been carried through to full production for the Australian bus market, while the bus interior demonstrates an extended implementation of intervention four; where the diversity of user requirements in the bus interior necessitate a completely modular system of components. 1. Determine user needs before the bus specification process. 2. Designs to be developed by the manufacturer in response to user needs. 3. This design should be standardised where possible, as suggested by the user needs. 4. Where user needs dictate product variations, apply a mass customisation approach to accommodate these needs. The interventions constitute a contribution to knowledge by their implementation in two design projects, one of which resulted in products adopted by the route bus manufacturer and market...|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to supplying chassis for external bodywork, {{and their own}} bodyworks, Scania have also collaborated with some <b>bodywork</b> <b>manufacturers</b> to deliver buses through Scania's distribution lines, both on a global base and on smaller markets.|$|R
50|$|The Scania Citywide was {{launched}} in 2011 {{as a replacement for}} the OmniCity, except for the right-hand drive markets, where Scania have chosen to rely on external <b>bodywork</b> <b>manufacturers,</b> including Alexander Dennis. With a total of more than 2200 units, the last few OmniCities were built in 2012.|$|R
50|$|The Scania Citywide is {{a series}} of integrally-constructed low-floor and low-entry buses {{introduced}} by Scania in 2011, replacing the Scania OmniCity and OmniLink, except in UK and Ireland, where Scania chose to rely on Alexander Dennis, Irizar and other local <b>bodywork</b> <b>manufacturers</b> instead. The series shares some front styling details with the Scania Touring coach, while most of the design is a simple facelift from the OmniCity and OmniLink.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the factors that explain the market {{leadership}} of a Brazilian bus <b>bodywork</b> <b>manufacturer</b> (Marcopolo). From a methodological point of view, the paper is a case study based on a bibliographic review and in-depth interviews. The underlying hypothesis is that some idiosyncratic factors regarding Brazilian market led the multinationals to give up contesting Brazilian incumbents in the bus bodywork segment. As compared to the automobile industry as whole, bus bodywork manufacturing is a relatively labor-intensive, smaller and less R&D-intensive industry, as innovation tends to be incremental. As a result, Brazilian companies managed to grow hand-in-hand with the local automotive market and dictated the customer-supplier relationship patterns. In order to become a relevant completely knocked down (CKD) vehicle exporter, Marcopolo had to develop technological capabilities related to stock management and lean production principles of modularity and product platforms or families. The firm relied basically on intramural research and development (R&D) and on vertical integration as a technology strategy to develop these capabilities. There seems not to be a relevant cooperative culture between Marcopolo and universities, research centers and other bus bodywork companies. However, there is cooperation between Marcopolo and companies outside the bus bodywork segment. Recently, Marcopolo found its own way to internationalization, especially towards developing countries, through acquisition of existing plants, joint-ventures and involvement of local suppliers. These movements, however, were not intended to be a source of new technologies. In short, Marcopolo's strategies and decisions have been ahead of the public policy rhetoric and of the market trends in Brazil. These strategies were clearly riskier, but, once succeeded, help to understand Marcopolo's leading position...|$|E
50|$|Low-floor chassis {{variants}} {{are offered}} for external bodywork by local <b>bodywork</b> <b>manufacturers.</b> Most are bodied {{in the local}} manufacturer's own styling, but some are licensed to replicate the Lion's City bodywork, usually in markets where MAN don't sell the integral variants. This includes the East Lancs Kinetec for the UK market, which only replicate the front part. Gemilang Coachworks in Malaysia replicate the whole bodywork for their buses sold in Asia Pacific market, including the Lion's City Hybrid bodywork mounted on conventional diesel chassis.|$|R
50|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, the car market experienced a sudden, drastic downturn. Almost all the <b>bodywork</b> <b>manufacturers,</b> including Bertone, reacted to the crisis by turning to military vehicles of various kinds. The company created vehicles such as the Bertone ambulance on a Lancia Artena base. It was a hard time. The demand was scarce. Raw materials and labour was lacking. Military orders where difficult to fulfill. But production did not stop in the Corso Peschiera plant, some luxurious Lancia Aprilia are manufactured as well as the extremely elegant long chassis Fiat 2800 cabriolet, the only one of its kind, built on commission for race driver and motoring journalist Giovanni Lurani Cernuschi.|$|R
50|$|After {{few years}} since its launch, the chassis of the Enviro300 became {{available}} with East Lancs Esteem bodywork, {{with the first}} two for Courtney Coaches entered service in 2006. This {{is the first time}} the Enviro300 chassis being constructed with <b>bodywork</b> by another <b>manufacturer.</b>|$|R
50|$|The N94UB (N94UB4x2EB) rigid two-axle chassis {{was first}} {{introduced}} {{as the basis for}} the integral OmniCity citbus in 1996, but was also available for <b>bodywork</b> by other <b>manufacturers</b> from 1997. Having a full low floor, it did not sell as well as the L94UB in the Nordic countries, where the low-entry alternative was more popular.|$|R
50|$|From 2017 forward, a new {{generation}} of Daytona Prototypes, branded Daytona Prototype International (DPi), will be replacing the original tube-framed Daytona Prototypes. These new prototypes will be based on the four ACO homologated LMP2 chassis made by Dallara, Onroak (Ligier), ORECA, and Riley-Multimatic, with brand bodywork and homologated engines. While there will be no factory teams, manufacturers are asked to partner with a privateer team, and each car will sport <b>manufacturer</b> <b>bodywork,</b> corresponding to their brand-identity. These rules are made to both control costs and attract manufacturers to the series.|$|R
40|$|For {{some years}} press-hardening {{has been a}} fixed {{variable}} {{in the manufacture of}} high-strength structural components. Advantages to be derived from the press-hardening of components include, for example, high strength with low sheet thicknesses; this offers the potential for weight saving and has finally been successful in convincing automotive <b>manufacturers.</b> <b>Bodywork</b> concepts designed to take into account crash requirements, in addition to a general increase in strength characteristics, are also increasingly calling for zones of various characteristics to be embodied within the relevant structural components. In the present work essential aspects of heat treatment for implementation into the press hardening and roll forming processes are analysed and discussed. By adopting a specific temperature regime in the tool, characteristics zones can be set that demonstrate different tensile strengths and degrees of permanent elongation...|$|R
