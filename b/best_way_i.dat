500|$|The Numero Group re-released Barely Real {{with nine}} bonus tracks on both compact disc and vinyl in 2012. This release added {{unreleased}} songs, Peel sessions, demo tracks, and the songs [...] "Cracked in Two", [...] "Broken-Hearted Wine", and a live cover of Unrest's [...] "Hydroplane". On the reissue, Brokaw commented that [...] "we were all {{happy with the}} [...] Some of the Dessau sessions are being included in the reissues on Numero, which I'm very glad about. The <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> can describe {{it is that we}} had high aspirations around what we wanted to achieve and it wasn't always easy (or even possible) to make those happen." ...|$|E
500|$|Dylan {{begins this}} track with a spoken intro where he {{describes}} the origins of folk songs in a satirical vein: [...] "most of the songs that are written uptown in Tin Pan Alley, that's {{where most of the}} folk songs come from nowadays". What follows has been characterized as an absurd, improvised blues which Dylan, in the sleeve notes, describes as [...] "a really off-the-cuff-song. I start with an idea and then I feel what follows. <b>Best</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> can describe this one is that it's sort of like walking by a side street. You gaze in and walk on." [...] Harvey points out that Dylan subsequently elaborated this style of self-deprecatory, absurdist humor into more complex songs, such as [...] "I Shall Be Free No.10" [...] (1964).|$|E
500|$|... "I Care" [...] {{comprised}} 75 {{tracks in}} total: 35 {{for the music}} and 40 for the vocals. According to Swivel, the main challenge in mixing [...] "I Care" [...] was hand‑aligning every single drum shot as it was time-consuming. He said, [...] "It's super‑monotonous, but it's the <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> can do it. If you Beat Detective the drums to the grid, it's never perfect." [...] As the layering of the drums had to be right on the millisecond, Swivel did one kick and snare at a time. This helped him ensure that the kicks line up with the programmed drums, hence preventing any phase inversion. Accordingly, each drum punched through as strongly as the last. The inspiration for the main drum sound on [...] "I Care" [...] came to Swivel at around four {{o'clock in the morning}} during a mixing session. He took a large plate sound from Avid’s D‑Verb plug‑in, rolled the high frequencies off at 8.6kHz, and sent it through an SSL channel strip with a gate on it, setting the release time to 0.6 seconds. He said, [...] "It's a really basic plug‑in, and I used a very 80s‑sounding gated reverb." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{writing process}} {{consumed}} approximately six months, including three months creating notes and analyzing the novel. Zaillian noted that as time progressed, the writing accelerated. [...] "As {{soon as you}} start making decisions," [...] he explained, [...] "you start cutting off {{all of the other}} possibilities of things that could happen. [...] So with every decision that you make you are removing a whole bunch of other possibilities of where that story can go or what that character can do." [...] Given the book's sizable length, Zaillian deleted elements to match Fincher's desired running time. Even so, Zaillan took significant departures from the book. To Zaillian, there was always a [...] "low-grade" [...] anxiety, [...] "but I was never doing anything specifically to please or displease," [...] he continued. [...] "I was simply trying to tell the story the <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> could, and push that out of my mind. I didn't change anything {{just for the sake of}} changing it. There's a lot right about the book, but that part, I thought we could do it a different way, and it could be a nice surprise for the people that have read it." ...|$|E
500|$|The band made {{an attempt}} to begin writing for a {{follow-up}} and had written and began recording one song titled [...] "Circle of the Noose", {{but it was never}} completed or officially released. The song, which is the last to feature guitar work from Navarro prior to his departure, was a tribute to the late qawwali-devotional singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. Navarro described the song as totally pop, dirge-like and said the song was one of the favorite songs he had done with the band. He said [...] "The <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> can describe it is it's like pepped- up '60s folk with '90s ideals, but I would hate to label it as folk because it's not, it moves." [...] On June 7, 2011, Navarro was asked by a Chili Peppers fan on his blog about [...] "Circle of the Noose" [...] and said he didn't have the recordings but would love to hear them. Flea was also asked in 2011 through his Twitter page about the song and was shocked that anyone knew about it. He responded by saying [...] "Holy cow! how in the hell do you know about that? It had a sample of nusrat fateh Ali khan in it...never was finished". On February 3, 2016, a rough mix of [...] "Circle of the Noose", which had been recorded on March 16, 1998, was leaked to the internet. Dave Navarro tweeted [...] "WOW what a trip down memory lane" [...] in response to the leak.|$|E
500|$|According to {{the park}} and Twitter posts {{selected}} by news media, public response during the soft opening was positive; Total Orlando gave the ride five stars for teenagers and four stars for adults. On Coaster101.com [...] "Ashley" [...] said that although the restraints were tight, they were comfortable and not as tight as those on other rides, adding: [...] "The drop on Falcon's Fury is different from any ride I have ever ridden. The <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> can describe it is that instead of leaving your stomach {{at the top of the}} tower, you take it with you to the bottom." [...] According to Florida Trip Guides, the ride was a good addition {{to the park}}'s attraction lineup: [...] "Falcon's Fury is not for the faint of heart. I have ridden dozens of drop towers but this one is different. Something about facing straight down and falling really makes you nervous." [...] Robert Niles of Theme Park Insider said that Falcon's Fury and other recent attractions were nearing the extreme of human tolerance; as a result, [...] "You're getting to the point where instead of making an attraction more popular by having it achieve some type of record, you're actually limiting the audience for that." [...] Randi Nissenbaum of Bay News 9 called the view from the top of the tower incredible, and although she was nervous at first she wanted to ride again. Sue Carlton of the Tampa Bay Times said, [...] "it was terrifying and thrilling and I held on as hard as I could and yelled and closed my eyes and afterward stepped off rubber-kneed and exhilarated." ...|$|E

2500|$|Early in his career, Richter {{also tried}} {{his hand at}} composing, and it even appears that he played some of his {{compositions}} during his audition for Neuhaus. [...] He gave up composition shortly after moving to Moscow. [...] Years later, Richter explained this decision as follows: [...] "Perhaps the <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> can put it is that I see no point in adding to all the bad music in the world".|$|E
2500|$|... "There {{are stories}} that I quit Sabbat because {{the rest of}} the band didn't like my pagan lyrics. That's not true. All of us shared an {{interest}} in paganism. The paganism was never a problem; I was always left {{to get on with the}} lyrics the <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> saw fit. No, the truth was that I could see that the music was going to get even more complex. Andy was writing 11 minute musical epics and I couldn't even begin to see how I'd write lyrics for something like that. I wanted to bring in other musical styles, to bring in violins for instance. That would never have worked with Sabbat." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "End of Time" [...] was {{conceived}} at the MSR Studios in New York City, where Knowles {{and her team}} spent a few days with the band from Fela! - a Broadway musical based on Kuti's life. As stated Jordan [...] "DJ Swivel Young, this period is accountable for the [...] "Fela [...] influence" [...] in the song; this influence is further illustrated in its instrumentation that includes horns and percussion instruments. At the beginning, the production team played music with the band as they experimented with horns, percussion, drums, guitars and keys. DJ Swivel explained: [...] "We'd be taking loops, like a section of percussion — congas for example — and then using them on a completely different record; and that record might be a completely different tempo or in a different key, so we'd literally be pitching it as we went. I used Elastic Audio [...] to fit and stretch it. Having fun is the <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> can put it; there were no rules." ...|$|E

2500|$|Upon signing, Kewell said, [...] "I {{wanted to}} move on and this is the <b>best</b> <b>way.</b> <b>I</b> can't wait to get started, it's just what I'm looking forward to, a new challenge." [...] His {{transfer}} to Galatasaray provoked strong criticism from fans and teammates of his former club Leeds United as he was a Leeds player when two of their fans were killed in clashes before a UEFA Cup semi-final against Galatasaray in Istanbul in April 2000. Kewell responded and in an open letter he stated, [...] "I chose the No 19 shirt when I signed for Galatasaray SK as a sign of respect for Leeds because that was the number I got when I first became a regular member of the Leeds United starting XI. I felt that it might be a way to demonstrate that I had not forgotten where it all started and I was hoping that in a small way it would help the healing process of the tragedy that occurred on 5 April 2000. To blame the Galatasaray club for the tragedy in Istanbul is simply wrong and discriminatory." ...|$|E
2500|$|Casting {{began in}} early August 2009, with open auditions held in various states. Jesse Eisenberg was first {{announced}} to {{be attached to}} the project in September 2009. (Coincidentally, in an interview with Diane Sawyer on ABC's World News with Diane Sawyer, Zuckerberg revealed that Eisenberg's cousin, Eric Fisher, was a Facebook product designer.) Several days later, Justin Timberlake and Andrew Garfield were confirmed to portray the roles of Sean Parker and Eduardo Saverin, respectively. In October 2009, Brenda Song, Rooney Mara, Armie Hammer, Shelby Young, and Josh Pence were cast. Max Minghella and Dakota Johnson were also confirmed to star in the film. In a 2009 interview with The Baltimore Sun, Eisenberg said, [...] "Even though I've gotten to be in some wonderful movies, this character seems so much more overtly insensitive in so many ways that seem more real to me in the <b>best</b> <b>way.</b> <b>I</b> don't often get cast as insensitive people, so it feels very comfortable: fresh and exciting, as if you {{never have to worry about}} the audience. Not that I worry about the audience anyway – it should be just the furthest thing from your mind. The Social Network is the biggest relief I've ever had in a movie".|$|E
2500|$|Off-screen, actress Lucy Speed {{had decided}} to leave the serial after playing Natalie for a year, as she was {{reportedly}} “freaked out” by the media attention she was receiving from being in such a high-profile show. In an interview with the ‘’Walford Gazette’’, Speed commented: “I was very frightened by it quite frankly and certainly unprepared for it. I didn't like at all the attention that came with being on such a high-profile show. It simply wasn't what I signed up for in the first place-all that craziness. I was naive, I admit. Of course it does come with the job of being on the show and {{you have to learn to}} deal with it and cope with it. The advantages always outweigh the drawbacks, anyway, but it didn't seem like that to me at the time. I was very young and extremely shy, so it all became a huge difficulty for me…But I also have to make it clear that from the beginning when I joined, I always intended to stay in it for just a year anyway. I honoured my initial one-year contract and then moved on…they did express their interest in signing me for another year, but I politely but firmly declined. They were a bit shocked. I tried to explain in the <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> could my reasons for leaving at the end of my contract and they ultimately understood, and so I left on good terms with them…I had some growing up to do and instinctively knew that growing up more or less in front of the British public for one year was enough!” ...|$|E
