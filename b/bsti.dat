40|$|Objectives: Opportunities for men {{having sex}} with men (MSM) to meet each other have very much {{improved}} by new communication technologies. Meeting venue-based characteristics can impact how many partners are met and how much sexual risk is taken. We analysed the association between physical and virtual venues and the risk for bacterial sexually transmitted infections (bSTIs) among participants in an MSM online survey. Methods: Data were collected during 2013 / 2014 with a survey targeting MSM living in Germany. The impact of the meeting place with the last non-steady anal sex partner on diagnosis with a <b>bSTI</b> {{in the previous year}} was analysed using bivariate and multivariate regression analysis, taking into account self-reported HIV status, serostatus communication, condom use, partner number, age and city size. Results: The study sample consisted of 8878 respondents (7799 not diagnosed with HIV; 1079 diagnosed with HIV). Meeting partners online was most common (62 % HIV−/ 51 % HIV+), followed by sex venues (11 % HIV−/ 25 % HIV+); other venues were each reported by 2 – 6 % of the respondents. Venue-dependent proportions reporting bSTIs in the recent year were 2 – 4 folds higher among men diagnosed with HIV. In multivariate analysis, HIV status was the strongest predictor for bSTIs (OR= 5. 0; 95 % CI 2. 8 to 8. 7). Compared with meeting partners online, sex (OR 1. 6; 95 % CI 1. 0 to 2. 5) and social venues (OR 1. 9; 95 % CI 1. 4 to 2. 6) were associated with increased <b>bSTI</b> risk for men not diagnosed with HIV, but the risk when meeting partners by smartphone apps was only of borderline significance (OR 1. 5; 95 % CI 0. 9 to 2. 3). For men diagnosed with HIV, <b>bSTI</b> risk increased for sex venues (OR 1. 5; 95 % CI 1. 1 to 2. 1), and was lower for non-gay/other venues (OR 0. 2; 95 % CI 0. 1 to 0. 5). Conclusions: Venues are connected to social-behavioural facets of corresponding sexual encounters, and may be important arenas for differential HIV and STI education, treatment and prevention...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe skin {{secretions}} of Bombina species contain peptides {{and small}} proteins with interesting biological properties. These include bombesin, thyrotropin releasing hormone, <b>BSTI</b> and Bv 8. In this review, the biosynthesis and antimicrobial activity of {{two groups of}} peptides, bombinins and bombinins H, are described. To date, these have only been found in Bombina skin. They are derived from common precursors containing one or two bombinin copies at the amino and a single bombinin H at the carboxyl end. Bombinins are active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and fungi but virtually inactive in haemolysis assays. Conversely, bombinins H have lower bactericidal activities but lyse erythrocytes. In the skin secretions, bombinins H are present in two sizes with either 20 or 17 amino acids. Moreover, they occur as epimers with either an l- or a d-amino acid at position 2. An enzyme catalyzing this inversion of chirality of an amino acid in peptide linkage has been isolated from Bombina skin secretions.

40|$|At {{the present}} time {{adulteration}} of food especially raw milk is becoming a burning issue. Normally milk is adulterated with water, starch, skim milk powder, sugar, detergent, and fat, recently formalin also added with milk to increase the shelf life of milk. That’s why it is very essential to detect the prevalence of adulteration of milk. The present experiment was conducted to know the adulteration of milk. Total thirty milk samples were collected from five different bazaars (Tangail town, Santosh Bazaar, Porabari Bazaar, Boilla Bazaar, Bajitpur Bazaar) of Tangail district where six samples were taken from each entry point. The mean Specific gravity was 1. 021, 1. 020, 1. 019, 1. 019 and 1. 020 respectively which were lower than standard 1. 032 (<b>BSTI,</b> 2000). The results clearly suggest that water {{was the most common}} adulterant in almost all sample of raw milk collected. 56. 67 % and 50 % samples were adulterated with starch and skim milk powder respectively. Two types of preservatives namely borax and sodium bicarbonate were detected in the fluid milk from the study areas. Out of all samples, 23. 33 % was adulterated with sodium bicarbonate and 16. 66 % with borax. However, none of the samples contained either formalin or hydrogen peroxide.

40|$|The present {{research}} work {{deals with the}} assessment of water pollution due to shipbreaking activities {{and its impact on}} the coastal zone of Chittagong, Bangladesh. In order to study the different physicochemical parameters, water samples from thirty Ship-breaking yards were collected and analyzed during the hydrological year 2011 - 2012. The laboratory findings were compared with the recommended values set by Department of Environment (DoE), and standard calculated on the <b>BSTI</b> and WHO value. Some parameters recorded as higher value compare to the international permissible limits in water. The study reveals that pollutants due to ship-breaking are highly toxic in nature. This affects not only the aquatic environment and human beings of the surroundings but also poses a serious threat to ground and surface water resources of the adjoining areas and the coastal environment of Chittagong region. Also it is indicated that the water of ship breaking yards are continuously polluting the Bay of Bengal and the rivers of Chittagong, especially the water of Karnafuli River is being polluted greatly. The polluted water of the Karnafuli River may affect the biodiversity of the Halda River.

40|$|Background Genome-wide {{association}} studies (GWAS) for Parkinson's disease {{have linked}} two loci (MAPT and SNCA) to risk of Parkinson's disease. We aimed to identify novel risk loci for Parkinson's disease. Methods We did a meta-analysis of datasets from five Parkinson's disease GWAS from the USA and Europe to identify loci associated with Parkinson's disease (discovery phase). We then did replication analyses of significantly associated loci {{in an independent}} sample series. Estimates of population-attributable risk were calculated from estimates from the discovery and replication phases combined, and risk-profile estimates for loci identified in the discovery phase were calculated. Findings The discovery phase consisted of 5333 case and 12 019 control samples, with genotyped and imputed data at 7 689 524 SNPs. The replication phase consisted of 7053 case and 9007 control samples. We identified 11 loci that surpassed the threshold for genome-wide significance (p < 5 x 10 (- 8)). Six were previously identified loci (MAPT, SNCA, HLA-DRB 5, <b>BSTI,</b> GAK and LRRK 2) and five were newly identified loci (ACMSD, STK 39, MCCC 1 /LAMP 3, SYT 11, and CCDC 62 /HIP 1 R). The combined population-attributable risk was 60. 3 % (95 % CI 43. 7 - 69 - 3).

To study the various physicochemical and microbiological parameters, surface water samples from the Karnafuli, Halda, Sangu, Matamuhuri, Bakkhali, Naf, Kasalong, Chingri and Mayani Rivers, Kaptai Lake and groundwater samples from almost every Upazilas, smaller administrative unit of Bangladesh, were collected and analyzed. The statistical methods of sampling were used for collecting samples. Samples were preserved using suitable preservation methods. Water samples from the freshwater resources were collected from different points and tide conditions and at different seasons for continuous monitoring during the hydrological years 2008 - 2009. The collected samples were analyzed for the following parameters: pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), total suspended solids (TSS), total solids (TS), dissolved oxygen (DO), transparency, acidity, dissolved carbon dioxide, total alkalinity, total hardness, chloride, ammonia-N, hydrogen sulfide, sulphate-S, o-phosphate-P, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), nitrate-N, nitrite-N, total nitrite and nitrate-N, arsenic, iron, manganese, copper, nickel, chromium, cadmium, lead, calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium using the procedure outlined in the standard methods. Average values of maximum physicochemical and microbiological parameters studied for the Karnafuli River were found higher than the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline.
