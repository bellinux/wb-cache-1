5|$|In 2012, over 40 {{per cent}} of Scotland's {{electricity}} came from renewable energy, and Scotland contributed almost 40 per {{cent of the}} UK's renewables output. At the end of 2012, there was 5,801 megawatts (MW) of installed renewables electricity capacity in Scotland, an increase of 20.95 per cent (1,005 MW) {{on the end of}} 2011. Renewable electricity generation in 2012 was a record high at 14,756 GWh – an increase of 7.3 per cent on 2011, the previous record year for renewables output. The bulk of electricity production is derived from gas and oil. 2002 figures used in RSPB Scotland et al. (2006) are gas (34%), oil (28%), coal (18%) and nuclear (17%), with renewables 3% (principally hydro-electric), prior to the substantial growth in wind power output. It should be borne in mind that electricity production {{is only part of the}} overall energy use budget. In 2002, Scotland consumed a total of 175 Terawatt-hours (TWh) of energy in all forms, some 2% less than in 1990. Of this, only 20% was consumed in the form of electricity <b>by</b> <b>end</b> <b>users,</b> the great majority of energy utilised being from the burning of oil (41%) and gas (36%).|$|E
25|$|The {{terminal}} implements a {{client-server architecture}} with the server {{running on a}} multiprocessor Unix platform. The client, used <b>by</b> <b>end</b> <b>users</b> {{to interact with the}} system, is a Windows application that typically connects directly through a router provided by Bloomberg and installed on-site. End users can also make use of an extra service (Bloomberg Anywhere) to allow the Windows application to connect via internet/IP, or Web access via a Citrix client. There are also applications that allow mobile access via Android, BlackBerry, and iOS. The server side of the terminal was originally developed using mostly the programming languages Fortran and C. Recent years have seen a transition towards C++ and embedded JavaScript on the clients and servers.|$|E

In December 2014, one reviewer commented that Android's notification system is [...] "vastly more complete and robust than in most environments" [...] and that Android is [...] "absolutely usable" [...] as one's primary desktop operating system.|$|E
2500|$|As sub-routines {{functions}} can {{be integrated}} and used {{in a variety of}} ways, and {{in a wide variety of}} larger, more complicated applications. [...] Within large enterprise applications they may, for example, play an important role in defining business rules or risk management parameters, while remaining virtually undetected <b>by</b> <b>end</b> <b>users.</b> [...] Within database management systems and spreadsheets, however, these kinds of functions also represent discrete sets of tools; they can be accessed directly and utilized on a stand-alone basis, or in more complex, user-defined configurations. In this context, functions can be used for business intelligence and ad hoc analysis of data in fields such as finance, statistics, engineering, math, etc.|$|E
2500|$|Normally, any {{intentional}} {{radio transmission}} requires an FCC license pursuant to Title III. [...] However, {{in recent decades}} the FCC has also opened some spectrum bands for unlicensed operations, typically restricting them to low power levels conducive to short-range applications. [...] This has facilitated the development of a very wide range of common technologies from wireless garage door openers, cordless phones, and baby monitors to Wi-Fi and Bluetooth among others. [...] However, unlicensed devices — like most radio transmission equipment — must still receive technical approval from the FCC before being sold into the marketplace, including to ensure that such devices cannot be modified <b>by</b> <b>end</b> <b>users</b> to increase transmit power above FCC limits.|$|E
50|$|Port {{numbers are}} {{categorized}} into three basic categories: well-known, registered, and dynamic/private. The well-known ports are {{assigned by the}} Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) and are typically used by system-level or root processes. Well-known applications running as servers and passively listening for connections typically use these ports. Some examples include: FTP (20 and 21), SSH (22), TELNET (23), SMTP (25), HTTP over SSL/TLS (443), and HTTP (80). Registered ports are typically used <b>by</b> <b>end</b> <b>user</b> applications as ephemeral source ports when contacting servers, {{but they can also}} identify named services that have been registered by a third party. Dynamic/private ports can also be used <b>by</b> <b>end</b> <b>user</b> applications, but are less commonly so. Dynamic/private ports do not contain any meaning outside of any particular TCP connection.|$|R

[...] Cosmos compiles user-made programs and associated libraries using IL2CPU {{to create a}} bootable native executable that can be run with no support. [...] The resulting output can be booted from a USB flash drive, CD-ROM, over a network via Preboot Execution Environment (PXE), or inside a virtual machine. Recent releases also allow deploying to certain x86 embedded devices over Universal Serial Bus (USB). [...] While C# is the primary language used by developers (both on the backend and <b>by</b> <b>end</b> <b>users</b> of Cosmos), many CLI languages can be used, provided they compile to pure CIL {{without the use of}} Platform Invocation Services (P/Invokes). [...] Cosmos is mainly intended for use with [...]NET Framework, with Mono support in the works.|$|E
2500|$|Streaming {{media is}} the {{real-time}} delivery of digital media {{for the immediate}} consumption or enjoyment <b>by</b> <b>end</b> <b>users.</b> Many radio and television broadcasters provide Internet feeds of their live audio and video productions. They may also allow time-shift viewing or listening such as Preview, Classic Clips and Listen Again features. These providers have been joined by a range of pure Internet [...] "broadcasters" [...] who never had on-air licenses. This means that an Internet-connected device, such as a computer or something more specific, {{can be used to}} access on-line media {{in much the same way}} as was previously possible only with a television or radio receiver. The range of available types of content is much wider, from specialized technical webcasts to on-demand popular multimedia services. Podcasting is a variation on this theme, where– usually audio– material is downloaded and played back on a computer or shifted to a portable media player to be listened to on the move. These techniques using simple equipment allow anybody, with little censorship or licensing control, to broadcast audio-visual material worldwide.|$|E
