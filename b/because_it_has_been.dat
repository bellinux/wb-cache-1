5|$|Chlorine is {{responsible}} for the degradation of fish and shrimp in the creek. The sources for chlorine in urban runoff include irrigation and car washing. The only remaining fish species in the creek is carp, which can withstand high amounts of chlorine. Carp up to 18inches (1.5feet / 45cm) long have been found in Aliso Creek near the mouth. Temperatures of the creek near the mouth have been known to exceed , although the temperature at the outflow is often much colder <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> mixed with seawater.|$|E
5|$|The {{state of}} Kerala is {{often viewed as}} the ideal {{progressive}} leader in the women’s rights movement in India among states. Kerala maintains very high relative levels of female literacy and women’s health, as well as greater female inheritance and property rights. For example, a 1998 study conducted by Bina Agarwal found that while only 13% of all women in India with landowning fathers inherited that land as daughters, 24% of such women {{were able to do}} so in the state of Kerala. This is important <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> shown that measures to improve such access to property and economic independence through channels such as education not only directly improve women’s wellbeing and capabilities, but also reduce their risk of exposure to marital or any sort of domestic violence.|$|E

5|$|This tiling {{is called}} the Pythagorean tiling <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{used as the basis}} of proofs of the Pythagorean theorem by the ninth-century Arabic {{mathematician}}s Al-Nayrizi and Thābit ibn Qurra, and by the 19th-century British amateur mathematician Henry Perigal. If the sides of the two squares forming the tiling are the numbers a and b, then the closest distance between corresponding points on congruent squares is c, where c is the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle having sides a and b. For instance, in the illustration to the left, the two squares in the Pythagorean tiling have side lengths 5 and 12 units long, and the side length of the tiles in the overlaying square tiling is 13, based on the Pythagorean triple (5,12,13).|$|E
5|$|For the National Register of Historic Places nomination, {{only the}} {{interior}} {{of one of the}} four units was surveyed, the second floor interior of 341 Broadway. This unit is accessed from a spiral staircase leading from the first floor to the attic. The second floor landing has a short foyer before opening to two parlors. The front parlor is said to have had a water fountain which was removed, but the plumbing is said to exist within the floor. The back parlor has a Queen Anne mantel and leads to the dining room with large floor-to-ceiling china closets. Located {{on the east side of}} the apartment is the kitchen, pantry and rear staircase. The north part of the apartment contains two bedrooms and a bath. The NRHP nomination states that the alterations to the unit were minimal and it is likely that the same would have been done for the first floor unit. The northern Fuller House, containing 343-345 Broadway, has been more seriously modified <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> split into four units. In 2013, real estate information for 343 Broadway suggests the expanse of the modifications to the house by listing the property as having 20 rooms, with 8 bedrooms and 5 baths. According to Trulia the house was sold in 2010 for $140,000 and still in the four unit configuration. A three-bay stuccoed garage dating from the 1920s or 1930 is used by 339-341 Broadway.|$|E

25|$|An {{associated}} attribute {{is highly}} accessible. This might be {{because it is}} evaluated automatically in normal perception or <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> primed.

25|$|<b>Because</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{customary}} in {{electrolytic capacitors}} to bind the excess hydrogen {{with the help}} of reducing or depolarizing compounds, such as aromatic nitrogen compounds or amines, to relieve the resulting pressure, the researchers then searched for compounds of this type. Although the analysis methods were very sensitive in detecting such pressure-relieving compounds, no traces of such agents were found within the failed capacitors.|$|E
25|$|The {{relativistic}} conservation law {{for energy}} and momentum replaces the three classical conservation laws for energy, momentum and mass. Mass {{is no longer}} conserved independently, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> subsumed into the total relativistic energy. This makes the relativistic conservation of energy a simpler concept than in nonrelativistic mechanics, because the total energy is conserved without any qualifications. Kinetic energy converted into heat or internal potential energy shows up as an increase in mass.|$|E

25|$|In Venice stands San Marco's, {{one of the}} world's {{best known}} Byzantine-style churches, dating mainly from the 11th-century and {{decorated}} over many centuries but maintaining its centrally planned Byzantine form. It is called St Mark's Basilica, {{not because it is}} of basilical shape, but <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> awarded that title. It has a Greek Cross plan, a large dome being surrounded by four somewhat smaller ones. Its decoration, both inside and out, is typical of the Byzantine period in its lavish use of mosaics and polychrome marble veneers.|$|E
25|$|Vermilion, a toxic mercury {{compound}} favored for its deep red-orange color by old master painters such as Titian, {{has been replaced}} in painters' palettes by various modern pigments, including cadmium reds. Although genuine Vermilion paint can still be purchased for fine arts and art conservation applications, few manufacturers make it, because of legal liability issues. Few artists buy it, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> superseded by modern pigments that are both less expensive and less toxic, as well as less reactive with other pigments. As a result, genuine Vermilion is almost unavailable. Modern vermilion colors are properly designated as Vermilion Hue to distinguish them from genuine Vermilion.|$|E
25|$|The European rabbit or common rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is {{a species}} of rabbit native to southwestern Europe (Spain, Portugal and Western France) and {{northwest}} Africa (Morocco and Algeria). It has been widely introduced elsewhere, often with devastating effects on local biodiversity. However, its decline in its native range (caused by the diseases myxomatosis and rabbit calicivirus, as well as overhunting and habitat loss), has caused the decline of its highly dependent predators, the Iberian lynx and the Spanish imperial eagle. It is known as an invasive species <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> introduced to countries on all continents {{with the exception of}} Antarctica, and caused many problems within the environment and ecosystems. Australia has the most problems with European rabbits, {{due to the lack of}} natural predators there.|$|E

25|$|Seth Kaplan (2011) {{argues that}} in {{contrast}} to southern Somalia and adjacent territories, Somaliland, the secessionist northwestern portion of Somalia, has built a more democratic mode of governance from the bottom up, with virtually no foreign assistance. Specifically, Kaplan suggests that Somaliland has the most democratic political system in the Horn of Africa <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> largely insulated from the extremist elements {{in the rest of}} Somalia and has viable electoral and legislative systems as well as a robust private sector-dominated economy, unlike neighbouring authoritarian governments. He largely attributes this to Somaliland's integration of customary laws and tradition with modern state structures, which he indicates most post-colonial states in Africa and the Middle East have not had the opportunity to do. Kaplan asserts that this has facilitated cohesiveness and conferred greater governmental legitimacy in Somaliland, as has the territory's comparatively homogeneous population, relatively equitable income distribution, common fear of the south, and absence of interference by outside forces, which has obliged local politicians to observe a degree of accountability.|$|E
500|$|Richard Ekins criticises as [...] "historically false [...] jurisprudentially absurd" [...] {{the claim}} made by Lord Steyn and Lord Hope that {{parliamentary}} sovereignty was solely a judicial creation. He {{argues that the}} doctrine is fundamental to the UK constitution <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> accepted by all three branches of government; [...] "while the judges also accept the rule, they did not create it and may not (lawfully) change it". However, Stuart Lakin responds that parliamentary sovereignty does, in practice and in theory, depend on its recognition by the courts.|$|E
500|$|Hong Kong: In May 2014, Hong Kong began a {{systematic}} destruction of its 28-ton stockpile, which {{was scheduled to}} take place {{over the course of}} two years. In its announcement of the destruction, Hong Kong's Endangered Species Advisory Committee chairman, Wong Kam-sing, explained that, moving forward, [...] "any future forfeiture of ivory will be similarly disposed of on a regular basis". Although the sale of ivory has not been banned entirely in Hong Kong, the commitment and actions it has taken are significant not just for being the largest stockpile destroyed to-date, but also <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> the world's largest ivory market.|$|E

500|$|The {{government}} of Iceland {{has played a}} major role in the advancement of geothermal energy. In the 1940s, the State Electricity Authority was started by the government in order to increase the knowledge of geothermal resources and the utilization of geothermal power in Iceland. It was later changed to the National Energy Authority (Orkustofnun) in 1967. This agency has been very successful and has made it economically [...] to use geothermal energy as a source for heating in many different areas throughout the country. Geothermal power has been so successful that the government no longer has to lead the research in this field <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> taken over by the geothermal industries.|$|E
500|$|Legal {{decisions}} {{surrounding the}} BRCA1 and BRCA2 patents {{will affect the}} field of genetic testing in general. [...] In June 2013, in [...] Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics (No. 12-398), the US Supreme Court unanimously ruled that, [...] "A naturally occurring DNA segment {{is a product of}} nature and not patent eligible merely <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> isolated," [...] invalidating Myriad's patents on the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. However, the Court also held that manipulation of a gene to create something not found in nature could still be eligible for patent protection. [...] The Federal Court of Australia came to the opposite conclusion, upholding the validity of an Australian Myriad Genetics patent over the BRCA1 gene in February 2013, but this decision is being appealed and the appeal will include consideration of the US Supreme Court ruling.|$|E
