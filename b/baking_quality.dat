50|$|The {{sunn pest}} {{is one of}} the most serious pests of wheat and barley in West Asia, where over $42 million (U.S.) is spent for its control. Yield loss from its damage has been {{estimated}} at 20-30% in barley and 50-90% in wheat. This insect damages these crops by feeding on leaves, stems and grains. During feeding they also inject chemicals that greatly reduce the <b>baking</b> <b>quality</b> of flour made from damaged wheat. If 2-3% of the grain is damaged, entire lots may be ruined because the flour will be unpalatable and the bread will not rise. Heavy attack causes wheat stems to break before harvest.|$|E
5000|$|Sprout {{damage is}} {{undesirable}} germination of wheat kernels that occurs on mature, unharvested wheat when wet field conditions persist {{just prior to}} and during the harvest. Mature wheat that has been cut and left lying in the field prior to threshing is particularly vulnerable to sprout damage. Early cold weather in Canada often forces wheat producers there to cut and windrow their crop to allow for drying. Wet conditions can then cause widespread sprout damage. If it has occurred, there is a dramatic increase of the enzyme alpha-amylase. The Falling Number test {{is a measure of}} the presence of this enzyme. A high falling number indicates that the wheat is sound and satisfactory for most baking processes. A low falling number indicates that harmful sprouting has occurred and is suggestive of reduced <b>baking</b> <b>quality.</b> In bread, too much alpha-amylase activity will cause wet sticky bread crumb with large voids in the loaf and too little causes dry crumble bread crumb and high loaf density.|$|E

Currently the average salt intake within the UK is 8. 6 g/day of which bread is {{estimated to}} contribute 1 / 5 of. The {{aim of this study}} was the determine whether the replacement of mineral salt (Smart salt which a low sodium, potassium and magnesium containing salt) is able to produce a loaf of bread considered acceptable in terms of rheological and baking qualities; as this salt replacement strategy may have important implications for a population based reduction in salt intake and consequently, blood pressure. Methods The control (n= 1) and experimental (n= 4) breads were baked within the queen Margaret Laboratory, where dough development time, baking time and loaf height were measured. The breads were then subjected to a single, blind, randomised controlled sensory evaluation study {{with the use of a}} star profile chart in a panel of 11 testers. These samples were analysed based on various <b>baking</b> <b>qualities</b> considered important to the consumer Results Dough development times for corresponding levels of regular salt against Smart salt were similar for the same NaCl levels within each bread showing the extra Potassium and Magnesium content within smart salt have no marked effect on dough development time. The Smart salt loaves were (23 ± 4. 5 mm) taller in height when compared with their corresponding NaCl levels, showing the S. S may have a reduced inhibitory effect on yeast. A significant difference (p 0. 05) were found between other loaves, it may be noted that the mean score of the Smart salt samples for four out of five qualities. Conclusions Smart salt had no direct effect on the dough development time of bread, however, the outcome loaf height was markedly taller than the normal salt loaves (23 mm ± 4. 5). Although no significant difference (p> 0. 05) was found between most groups within the sensory evaluation, we can conclude that Smart salt is able to produce a loaf of bread considered acceptable in terms of all <b>baking</b> <b>qualities</b> when compared to the regular salt variants.

Cultivars are usually tested on organic and conventional farms. However, field properties may differ owing to spatial variations of soils and microclimate heterogeneity. In this study, old, organically bred and conventionally bred cultivars were tested in organic and conventional farming systems of the DOK long-term system comparison trial. RESULTS: Effects of cultivars and systems on yield and quality parameters were statistically significant. Genotype x system interactions were generally not observed. Grain yield across all cultivars increased from 4. 2 Mg ha(- 1) under organic conditions up to 6. 8 Mg ha(- 1) under conventional conditions, with protein contents of 90 and 117 g kg(- 1) respectively. Conventionally bred cultivars yielded significantly more under conventional conditions than organically bred cultivars, whereas neither organically nor conventionally bred cultivars performed better under organic conditions.

Choosing {{the right}} sowing dates can {{maximize}} {{the outcomes of}} the interaction between genotype and environment, thus increasing grain yield and <b>baking</b> <b>quality</b> of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The present study aimed at determining the most appropriate sowing dates that maximize grain yield and <b>baking</b> <b>quality</b> of wheat cultivars. Seven wheat cultivars (BRS 179, BRS Guamirim, BRS Guabiju, BRS Umbu, Safira, CD 105 and CD 115) were evaluated at four sowing dates (the 1 st and the 15 th of June and July) in two harvesting seasons (2007 and 2008). The study was setup in a completely randomized block design with four repetitions. The effects of the year and sowing date when combined explained 93 % of the grain yield variance. In 2007, the CD 105 and Safira cultivars had the highest grain yield (GY) for all sowing dates.

Three different ozone concentrations with different application times rendering three quantities of absorbed ozone have been investigated. Rheological, physicochemical and baking properties of soft wheat flours stemming from both treatments were evaluated and compared to untreated flour. Results were overall significant and showed that the treatment of flour gives more marked results than the treatment on grain for retention capacity in sucrose and volume of cakes but decreases the [alpha]-amylase activity. On the other hand, action of ozone on grain augments the maximum viscosity of the flour. Bread volume was found to be increased by both treatments in similar proportions. The treatments were also analyzed in particular and showed specific characteristics. A single treatment has not been determined to enhance all characteristics of the flour.

Sorghum is a naturally gluten-free grain with ideal <b>baking</b> <b>qualities</b> that is underutilized in the gluten-free baking industry. Research is needed on developing gluten-free breads utilizing sorghum flour {{that could be used}} in future research and commercial production. Three objectives were tested. Objectives evaluated feasibility of using egg white foam with leavening agents in yeast-free bread, optimum mixing time in a laboratory control bread utilizing sorghum flour, and maximizing the amount of sorghum flour {{that could be used in}} the control formulation. Four comparisons were tested for yeast-free breads and 5 were compared for yeast breads. Volume, hardness, and color were measured using 15 replications. Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM) was performed on selected treatments to evaluate crumb structure. Utilizing egg white foam for gluten-free breads produced acceptable volume, color, crumb structure and hardness compared to commercial gluten-free controls. Using egg white foam eliminates proofing time with increased production speed. Increasing mixing time in gluten-free yeast breads significantly (P< 0. 05) improved specific volume and overall loaf volume without negatively affecting crumb hardness in 10 and 15 minute mixing treatments. Crumb structure was significantly improved between 5 and 15 minute treatments. Evaluation with ESEM showed reduced clumping of ingredients in the crumb and thinner air cell walls. Specific volume and loaf volume were significantly (P< 0. 05) higher in 15 minute mixing (2. 13 cm^ 3 /g; 1845 cm^ 3) versus the commercial comparison (2. 00 cm^ 3 /g; 923 cm^ 3). Optimum mixing for yeast bread was 15 minutes and optimum percentage of sorghum used in the flour blend was 60 percent. Increasing the use of commodity grade gluten-free decorticated white sorghum flour will reduce cost of specialty milled ingredients. In future studies mixing for 15 minutes using the laboratory yeast bread formulation containing 60 percent sorghum should be used as the research control as it provided consistent optimum results...|$|R
