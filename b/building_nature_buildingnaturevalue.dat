40|$|Globally, {{there is}} an {{increasing}} pressure on coastal and marine ecosystems. The development of marine infrastructure is causing additional ecological impacts on these systems. To reduce ecological impacts innovative approaches of marine infrastructure development are being developed. These approaches, such as <b>Building</b> with <b>Nature,</b> aim to integrate ecological and social dynamics {{in the creation of}} coastal and marine infrastructure. This integration has implications for the development and management of these projects. To understand opportunities for <b>Building</b> with <b>Nature</b> approaches, this article analyzes the development of the Melbourne Channel Deepening project in Australia that developed from a conventional, state-led project toward a <b>Building</b> with <b>Nature</b> arrangement. This article shows that a <b>Building</b> with <b>Nature</b> project arrangement differs not just substantially in its ecological focus and primacy from a conventional project arrangement, but also in its leading discourse, its actor coalition, its power and resources applied, and {{the rules of the game}} through which the project is designed and implemented.

40|$|Part I Introduction and {{justification}} of the Monitor <b>Building</b> with <b>Nature</b> This report describes the Monitor <b>Building</b> with <b>Nature</b> in the IJsselmeer region. When {{it comes to}} implementing the concept of <b>building</b> with <b>nature</b> the main issue is not how it is technically possible, but whether stakeholders consider it possible and desirable. The monitor gives insight into perceptions of stakeholders and provides possibilities for improvements in decision making and in generating societal support for <b>Building</b> with <b>Nature</b> projects. The project that developed this monitor {{is part of the}} <b>Building</b> with <b>Nature</b> research and innovations programme. The monitor has the following goals: Describe the (changes in) perceptions and actions related to ‘building with nature’ in hydraulic engineering projects. Among which: 1. Describe the situation of the project {{at the start of the}} monitoring, include the history of the project, the broad context, the assignment of the project, and the (formal) involvement of stakeholders. 2. Make an inventory of the (developments in) observed threats and opportunities at project level (design, project management, process). 3. Make an inventory of the (developments in) observed threats and opportunities for <b>building</b> with <b>nature</b> within the external field of force. 4. Make an inventory of perceptions related to improvements and the involvement of the different stakeholders. The focus of the monitor is on perceptions of people who are involved in hydraulic engineering projects. For the development of the monitor, existing monitor approaches are used. The focus of the monitor is gathering of information and has characteristics of constructivist monitoring. However, the monitor aims to show the diversity of the available perceptions and actions. The focus of the monitor is not merely on ‘learning’, although when the monitor is used in meetings or workshops, it can contribute to learning about <b>building</b> with <b>nature.</b> The monitor is qualitative of nature, with implicit use of indicators. The monitor is one of the initiatives of monitoring within the Research programme <b>Building</b> with <b>Nature.</b> One other initiative is for example the monitoring of the Community of Practice in the IJsselmeer region. Part II The Monitor – Questionnaire In preparing for the use of the monitor, three main questions are to be asked. The first question is: what is the focus in the project? The second question is: who are the respondents and why? There are no universal criteria, nor are these desirable. And the third question is: how do we use the questionnaire? Are we interested in doing face to face interviews, or interviews by phone? How the questionnaire is used depends largely on the goal of the monitor and the resources (i. e. time, money, people) availableThe questionnaire consists of four different parts. Part A discusses issues related to <b>building</b> with <b>nature</b> within the project and deals with stakeholders’ perceptions of the concept. Part B discusses factors influencing the feasibility of <b>building</b> with <b>nature.</b> Part C is about placing issues on the agenda and possibilities for improvements. Part D rounds up the questionnaire. For analysing the results of the monitor the following elements compromise the framework of analysis: 1. Aspects perceived as characteristic for <b>building</b> with <b>nature</b> 2. Aspects of <b>building</b> with <b>nature</b> in the project 3. Best practices of <b>building</b> with <b>nature</b> according to respondents 4. Perceptions of factors and conditions which stimulate or obstruct <b>building</b> with <b>nature.</b> 5. Perceptions of the future and future possibilities for realizing <b>building</b> with <b>nature</b> 6. Perceptions of action perspectives to realize <b>building</b> with <b>nature</b> on large scale in multiple 7. projects in the IJsselmeer region. Part III The Monitor tested To test the monitor two projects were selected as pilots: the dike strengthening project Edam- Amsterdam and the silt catch pit. Applying the monitor in these projects has lead to an improved version of the monitor and lessons learned on how to apply the monitor. It was not possible to apply the monitor itself in the dike strengthening project, although the process was very useful. We found that interesting projects to apply the monitor also are subject to sensitive issues. Great concern is necessary to deal with these issues. Therefore, sensitive issues require more preparation time. In the project ‘silt catch pit’ we were able to apply the monitor and make a case description of the project. Applying the questionnaire and developing the case description lead to improvements of the monitor and recommendations on its use. On the development of the monitor, the following is concluded: •Applying the monitor results in a broad insight into the feasibility of the <b>building</b> with <b>nature</b> concept, factors which are of influence and insight into the decision making in <b>building</b> with <b>nature</b> projects. •It is recommended to have an exploratory interview before using the questionnaire. This is necessary to gain enough information relevant for the case description, gain permission to apply the monitor and get in contact with the relevant stakeholders. •Applying the monitor in the silt catch pit showed that it is very suitable to find factors influencing the feasibility of <b>building</b> with <b>nature</b> in projects. Because it was only possible to develop one pilot, we recommend to again reflect critically on the monitor when applied. •Sensitive issues may make a project an (more) interesting one for applying the monitor. However, it may be more difficult to acquire permission for application and it may require more time. During application of the monitor one should be aware of the issues. Demarcation of concepts is important for the sake of comparing results, as the questionnaires are used for different persons and in different moments in time •The questionnaire can be combined with workshops or meetings to stimulate the realization of the <b>building</b> with <b>nature</b> concept. •The case description is based on a monitor that is incomplete and is part of developing the monitor. Therefore the case description should not be used as a complete example and should be considered together with the conclusions and recommendations made...|$|R
