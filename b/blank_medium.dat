40|$|ObjectiveBone marrow–derived mesenchymal {{stem cells}} (MSCs) have shown {{therapeutic}} potential in acute lung injury. Recently, placenta-derived human mesenchymal stem cells (PMSCs) have shown similarities with bone marrow–derived MSCs {{in terms of}} regenerative capabilities and immunogenicity. This study investigates the hypothesis that treatment with PMSCs reduces the development of bronchiolitis obliterans in a murine heterotopic tracheal transplant model. MethodsA murine heterotopic tracheal transplant model was used to study the continuum from acute to chronic rejection. In the treatment groups, PMSCs or PMSC-conditioned medium (PMSCCM) were injected either locally or intratracheally into the allograft. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or <b>blank</b> <b>medium</b> was injected in the control groups. Tracheal luminal obliteration was assessed on sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Infiltration of inflammatory and immune cells and epithelial progenitor cells was assessed using immunohistochemistry and densitometric analysis. ResultsCompared with injection of PBS, local injection of PMSCs significantly reduced luminal obliteration at 28 days after transplantation (P = . 015). Intratracheal injection of PMSCs showed similar results to local injection of PMSCs compared with injection of PBS and <b>blank</b> <b>medium</b> (P = . 022). Tracheas treated with PMSC/PMSCCM showed protection against the loss of epithelium on day 14, {{with an increase in}} P 63 +CK 14 + epithelial progenitor cells and Foxp 3 + regulatory T cells. In addition, injection of PMSCs and PMSCCM significantly reduced the number of neutrophils and CD 3 + T cells on day 14. ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that treatment with PMSCs is protective against the development of bronchiolitis obliterans in an heterotopic tracheal transplant model. These results indicate that PMSCs could provide a novel therapeutic option to reduce chronic rejection after lung transplant...|$|E
40|$|Metal uptake by {{different}} plant species was quantified in sand media amended with biosolids in a sand-culture hydroponic medium. In a previous paper (Koo et al. 2006), {{we concluded that}} total quantities of organic acids were greatest in treatments containing both plants and biosolids, with lesser amounts in treatments with plants alone, biosolids-treated media alone, and a nutrient solution-irrigated <b>blank</b> <b>medium.</b> Biosolids enhanced organic acid production in the rhizosphere. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate how organic acids in root exudates affect the absorption of metals by selected plants. We found that the concentrations of metals in the plant tissue grown on biosolids-treated medium were always higher than that from the standard medium, irrespective of species and cultivar. The amount of metal transferred from the biosolids-treated medium to the plant varied with the metal element, following the order: Cd > Ni = Zn > Cu > Pb > Cr. Interspecies and cultivar differences in metal uptake were trivial compared to differences induced by the treatment. The metal uptake decreased with the growth period, and the kinetics of metal uptake, as indicated by accumulation in corn shoots, were essentially a first order during the initial 4 weeks of growth, especially for Cd and Zn...|$|E

To investigate sperm-OEC interactions, we used chlortetracycline to study the capacitation status of boar sper-matozoa in coculture with homologous OEC and cells of non-reproductive origin (LLC-PK 1, porcine kidney epithelial cell line). Boar spermatozoa were cocultured with OEC and LLC-PK 1 cells for 15, 60, 120, or 240 min. The proportion of capac-itated spermatozoa in coculture with the isthmic and ampullar cells increased significantly (p, 0. 05) during incubation. How-ever, most spermatozoa in coculture with LLC-PK 1 cells or <b>blank</b> (<b>medium</b> only) remained uncapacitated. In addition, preferential binding of uncapacitated, capacitated, or acrosome-reacted boar spermatozoa to OEC and the other cell type was investi-gated. Our approach was to vary the proportions of uncapaci-tated, capacitated, or acrosome-reacted boar spermatozoa in suspension using long preincubation and lysophosphatidylcho-line treatment of semen prior to a very short incubation with OEC or LLC-PK 1 cells. The {{results showed that the}} majority of spermatozoa that were bound to OEC or LLC-PK 1 cells were uncapacitated and that a significant relationship existed be-tween the relative proportion of uncapacitated spermatozoa in the control samples and those bound to LLC-PK 1 cells (r 2 5 0. 43, p, 0. 005). However, there was no correlation between the proportion of uncapacitated spermatozoa in the control samples and the proportion of those bound to isthmic or am-pullar cells. In conclusion, the results clearly demonstrated the specific nature of the sperm-OEC interaction in the porcine species. This interaction is initiated by uncapacitated spermatozoa binding to OEC and is continued by the induction of capacitation in co-cultured spermatozoa...|$|E

40|$|Emodin {{is a major}} active {{anthraquinone}} {{of various}} herbal laxatives, which can exert many pharmacological effects. However, chronic use of anthranoid laxatives, even at low dosages, may cause melanosis coli (MC). It {{has been suggested that}} the accumulation of anthraquinones is a risk factor in the MC process. To investigate the accumulation of emodin, we conducted a bioconcentration study of emodin in zebrafish eleutheroembryos. Based on the economic cooperation and development (OECD) 305 test, zebrafish eleutheroembryos were exposed to emodin at a constant concentration for 48 h, before the test media were replaced by the <b>blank</b> <b>medium</b> for 24 h of depuration. To eliminate the effect of metabolism of emodin for assessment of the bioconcentration factor (BCF), we also conducted a modified test for which zebrafish eleutheroembryos were exposed to the non-renewed test media, whose emodin concentration decreased with time. At different exposure time points, zebrafish eleutheroembryos and exposure media were sampled for analysis of emodin concentration using HPLC-MS/MS. The results showed rapid accumulation of emodin in zebrafish eleutheroembryos to reach a steady-state concentration within 24 h. Meanwhile, emodin was actively metabolized by zebrafish eleutheroembryos to result in 29. 5 – 40. 7 % of its elimination. In the groups with high or low concentrations of emodin, the standardized BCF (sBCF) values in the standard test were 24. 0 and 20. 0, while those in the modified test were 50. 4 and 52. 0. These results showed that emodin could accumulate in zebrafish eleutheroembryos when used for 48 h and beyond, suggesting that the accumulation of anthraquinones may be a risk factor in the MC process. Accordingly, emodin should be unsuitable for long-term use due to its accumulation...|$|E

The MTT assay was performed in 96 -well tissue culture plates (Nalge-Nunc, Rochester, NY, USA) as follows: the cells (1 [*]×[*] 105 /well) were seeded in tissue culture plates and incubated with the different concentrations of ruthenium compound (from 0.15 – 150 μM) dissolved in a total volume of 100 μL/well for 24 h and 48 h at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2. The cells incubated with medium only served as a control. Following the exposure to the tested substances, the cells were incubated with 10 μL of MTT solution (5 mg mL- 1) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 3 h. The microplates were then centrifuged (300 × g/ 15 min/ 10 °C) and the culture media were discarded. Afterwards 200 μl of PBS/ 20 % of SDS (lauryl sulfate) solution (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was added to each well to stop the reaction and plates were kept in the dark overnight.

40|$|Resistant starch (RS) is the starch that escapes human {{digestion}} {{system and}} will be delivered to the lower gut for fermentation by gut microbiota. Five types of resistant starch have been described, including 1) physically amylase-inaccessible type 1 RS, 2) native high amylose type 2 RS, 3) retrograded type 3 RS, 4) chemically modified type 4 RS, and 5) fatty acid complexed type 5 RS. RS {{has been shown to}} lower postprandial glycemic index (including plasma glucose and insulin levels), indicating effects of RS in reducing risk of type II diabetes and possible obesity as well, In addition, RS fermentation in the lower gut has been shown to maintain colon health and prevent colon carcinogenesis, mainly through production of SCFA. Physiological significances of SCFA, especially butyrate, include providing an energy source for colonocytes, maintaining the colonic epithelia cell layer, stimulating basal crypt cell proliferation, and inducing apoptosis of hyper-proliferative cancer cells. Furthermore, RS has also been considered as a prebiotic to modulate gut microbiota favoring RS degradation and SCFA production. The long-term objective of our study is to understand the underlying mechanisms of RS in improving human health from two correlated aspects, modulating gut microbiota and producing SCFA. We hypothesized that when using an in vivo animal model and an in vitro fermentation model, resistant starch consumption would shift gut microbiota pattern towards favoring RS fermentation, especially SCFA production, In respect to the physiological significance of resistant starch implicated in improving colon health, we hypothesized that HA 7 (high amylose starch VII, type 2 RS), and HA 7 -SA (palmitic acid complexed HA 7, type 5 RS) would modulate colonic microbiota into different patterns. The bacterial pattern shifts can explain the differential efficacy of two RS suppressing colon carcinogenesis. Previous studies showed that pre-neoplasm, aberrant crypt foci (ACF) induced by carcinogen Azoxymethane (AOM) were only decreased by 8 -wk feeding of HA 7 (21 y 9) in male Fisher 344 rats, but not by HA 7 -SA (38 y 18), when compared to highly digested control starch (48 y 14). We used PCR-DGGE (Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis) to analyze colonic microbiota with bacteria universal 16 S rRNA gene primers. Our results showed two RSs induced significant shifts of colonic microbiota compared to control digestible starch-fed rats. Moreover, differential bacterial patterns were observed between two RSs such as the specific enrichment of putative Bifidobacterium pseudolongum by HA 7 -SA, but not by HA 7. More importantly, a significant correlation was observed between gut microbiota patterns and ACF numbers developed in AOM treated animals. Further analysis of starch fermentation-associated bacteria groups showed similar shifts of Clostridium cluster IV by two RSs with increased putative Ruminococcus bromii. By contrast, the bacterial pattern of Clostridium cluster XIVa showed correlation with ACF number. Specific enrichment of putative Ruminococcus obeum R. sp. SR 1 / 5 was observed in HA 7 -fed animals, whereas specific decrease of Bacteroides sp. ASF 519 or Parabacteroides goldsteinii (T) by HA 7 -SA was observed in the Bacteroides fragilis group. Our results suggested that gut microbiota patterns modulated by RS were related to differential efficacy of HA 7 and HA 7 -SA in decreasing colonic carcinogenesis. We established an in vitro semi-continuous anaerobic incubation model to compare fermentability, i. e. SCFA production, of four high amylose starches: HAV, HAVI, HAVII and GEMS- 067 from four maize lines with different genetic background and amylose contents (55 %, 65 %, 70 % and 70 % respectively). This was done to evaluate prebiotic effects of resistant starch on modulating gut microbiota hypothetically towards favoring RS fermentation. The digested starch residues (SR), obtained from in vitro digestion with the AOAC 991. 43 method, were incubated with fecal microbiota to simulate human digestion of cooked starchy food. In our study a total of 32 individuals were recruited: 17 lean, 9 overweight and 6 obese individuals. The study was conducted in two phases 5 months apart. Each phase consisted of a 3 -wk incubation period with a frequency of changing BHI (Brain Heart Infusion) medium and SR substrates every 3. 5 d. We observed significantly decreased pH, increased gas production, increased butyrate and total SCFA concentration in incubations with the four SR compared to <b>blank</b> BHI <b>medium</b> control starting at wk 1. There was no difference between SR. Molar proportions of butyrate was increased by SR with decreased acetate proportion, both of which achieved stability starting at wk 2. Additionally, propionate concentration was only increased by SRV {{at the end of the}} 3 -wk incubation compared to BHI medium, but not by other SR. Large inter-individual variation was observed in the proportional increase of butyrate by SR compared to <b>blank</b> BHI <b>medium</b> control. No significant difference was found between lean and overweight individuals from fermentation indicators measured. We concluded that a stable long-term semi-continuous in vitro fermentation model was established to simulate carbohydrate fermentation in human lower gut. We also showed significant increase of butyrate production by RS fermentation with human fecal microbiota. The modulation of microbiota by amylase digestion residues of HAV, VI and VII in our semi-continuous fermentation model was further analyzed with PCR-DGGE by examining total bacterial pattern and that of RS fermentation associated bacteria groups, including Clostridium cluster IV, XIVa and Bacteroides fragilis group. We hypothesized that bacterial patterns obtained after 3 wk fermentation will be selected by three SR incubation and lean/overweight microbiota as well. Our results showed that total bacterial patterns were shifted by three SR incubation with fecal microbiota from 30 donors at the end of 3 -wk fermentation compared to control BHI medium. Moreover, bacterial pattern in SRV fermentation samples differed from that of SRVI and SRVII, which shared a certain degree of similarity. However, bacterial pattern of Clostridium cluster IV and XIVa in SRVI fermentation samples differed from SRV and SRVII, which shared similar patterns, whereas no shifts were observed by any SR in Bacteroides fragilis group bacterial pattern compared to <b>blank</b> BHI <b>medium</b> control. Most important, we observed the putative Ruminococcus bromii was specifically selected during SR incubation by microbiota from lean individuals, but not by microbiota from overweight and obese individuals. We concluded that our in vitro semi-continuous fermentation model can be used to assess prebiotic effects of RS by simulating long-term RS consumption in human. We also showed that Ruminococcus bromii, belonging to Clostridium cluster IV, was selectively enriched by SR and microbiota of lean individuals. In summary, our studies with both in vivo animal model and in vitro fermentation model supported previous recognition of resistant starch acting as a prebiotic to modulate gut microbiota, especially on Clostridium clusters IV and XIVa. Ruminococcus bromii was specifically induced in rat model fed RS as well as in vitro fermentation model using lean microbiota. Moreover, different RS may have different fermentation outcomes. Our findings provided solid evidence to answer the fundamental question of how RS exerted effects on shifting bacterial pattern. In addition, we also showed that the physiological significance of RS might be affected by physical-chemical properties of starch and pre-existing microbiota as well...|$|R

Bacterial growth curves were built by plotting log (N/N 0 [...]) versus time, where N was the viable CFU mL− 1 at a given time and N 0 [...] the viable CFU/mL at time zero. The concentration of curcumin at which the log (N/N 0 [...]) value after 20  h was ≤ 0 was regarded as minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC).|$|R

As promoters and public relation-departments of record companies are constantly inundated by sound carriers of all possible formats, it should be clear that there is no time to listen to all of the material. A compact disk will have far more chances to be played at all. In addition to the burning process the new media allows further, musically creative processing by means of the CD-burning software. So the arrangement of pauses between tracks or their length should not play an underrated part: Shall the tracks blend without a pause or will the following track be more effective when introduced by a long break? Even subsequent fading as well as intensive filtering are integrated software options for additional processing. It goes without saying that the succession of the tracks is exchangeable and can be adjusted to specific needs.

Nevertheless, a CD-burner is one of the daily used parts of equipment for creative musicians. The technical innovation has willingly been accepted...|$|R
30|$|Cultures {{were viewed}} using an {{inverted}} microscope {{to assess the}} degree of confluence {{and the absence of}} bacterial and fungal contamination. Crude extracts of sponge were tested for any cytotoxic activity against two tumor cell lines. They were caco- 2 (colon cancer) and Mcf- 7 (breast cancer). When the cells grown on 75  cm 2 tissue culture flasks reached confluence (usually 24  h), the cell suspension of the three tumor cell lines were prepared in complete growth medium (DMEM). The aliquots of (100  μl) of cell suspension were added to each well on a 96 -well tissue culture plate. The <b>blank</b> wells contained <b>medium</b> in place of cell suspension. The cells were incubated for 24  h at 37  °C in humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO 2. After the formation of a complete monolayer cell sheet in each well of the plate, the medium was aspirated and replaced with DMEM with 2 % fetal bovine serum. Then, the extracts were dispensed into 96 -tissue culture plate at 50  μl/well. Another set of well was kept for including wells of cell controls in which (50  μl) of DMEM with 2 % FBS being added instead of the extracts as negative control. Serial three fold dilutions of the plant extract were added into a 96 -well sterile tissue culture plate using multichannel pipette. The treated and untreated cells were covered with a plate sealer then allowed to grow and proliferate by further incubation the plate for 24  h at 37  °C in humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO 2. At the end of incubation, the plate was examined using the inverted microscope.|$|R
40|$|The day Stephen Shapiro’s {{photographic}} study Bowie (2016) was published, I hastily took a snap {{to promote}} my good taste on social media. My phone’s camera spilled light across Shapiro’s beautiful cover, trapping my own reflection, a dark shape that by chance aligned perfectly with {{the shadow of}} Bowie cast by professional lighting. The serendipity became clear later that day as I wrote this proposal deliberating on the uncanny “anti-narcissistic form of self-reflection” (Boym, 2001) that media offers fans. Fan Studies vacillates between theorising fans as media-consumers (Sandvoss, 2005), active users (Duffett, 2013) and projecting identity onto it (Gee, 2003) tending to frame the interaction around an active/passive reader dynamic (per Barthes, 1998). However, my aim is to identify and explore media as reflecting back {{the image of the}} fan at the moment of their most enchanted engagement with the fan object. I begin by outlining the concepts of remediation (Bolter and Grusin 2000) and seriality (repetition-with-variation or difference as per Deleuze 1994 and différance Derrida 1982) seeing Bowie as both mediated and media. This conceit is made possible via McLuhan’s claim that the medium is the message (1999) and, tangentially, through Colin Wilson’s claim that Bowie is a <b>medium</b> (<b>Blanks,</b> 2016). I then identify how Bowie-related media function as memory sites, looking at media-specific monuments as well as intermedial and remedial morphing between music papers, film, records and fan interactions. Finally, I explore the notion of media-as-mirror, one developed from Holmes’ observation of photography as “the mirror with a memory” (quoted in Ruchatz, 2010), Holdsworth’s account of domestic television as a black mirror (2011), and my own work on fan memories as augmented by intersensual listening experiences with Bowie (October, 2015 b). The character of Thomas Jerome Newton from The Man Who Fell to Earth (Roeg, 1976) is a cipher for these ideas, glancing ‘himself’ differently through multiple television screens (October, 2015 a) and re-emerging as Lazarus (2016). That Bowie could not let go of this character is evidenced by Shapiro’s photographic remediation of the film, and through fan reflection, one that engenders further reflections and serialit...|$|R
