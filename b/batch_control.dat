40|$|In a {{client-server}} system, it may {{be possible}} for the client to corrupt server data through unsafe access methods or programming errors. A common method for protecting the server data is to separate the client and server into distinct protection domains, e. g. Unix processes. Communication between client and server is restricted to a well-defined set of crossdomain calls and results are passed as opaque pointers to server data. Unfortunately, cross-domain calls are expensive and seriously affect the performance of the system. In his work on Batched Futures, Bogle presents a mechanism for batching cross-domain calls, thus amortizing the overhead of the domain crossing across the batch. Bogle showed that the improvement in performance is directly proportional to the average size of a batch (batching factor). This thesis describes two mechanisms {{that can be used to}} improve the batching factor: basic value promises and <b>batched</b> <b>control</b> structures. Basic value promises allow the batching of calls that return basic values (e. g. integer, boolean, character and real). <b>Batched</b> <b>control</b> structures allow the <b>batching</b> of simple <b>control</b> flow statements such as if statements, while loops and for loops. Both mechanisms have been implemented in Thor, an object-oriented database system. This thesis presents performance results showing the e#ectiveness of both mechanisms in increasing the performance of cross-domain calls...|$|R

50|$|The DCS largely {{came about}} {{due to the}} {{increased}} availability of microcomputers {{and the proliferation of}} microprocessors in the world of process control. Computers had already been applied to process automation for some time in the form of both direct digital control (DDC) and setpoint control. In the early 1970s Taylor Instrument Company, (now part of ABB) developed the 1010 system, Foxboro the FOX1 system, Fisher Controls the DC2 system and Bailey Controls the 1055 systems. All of these were DDC applications implemented within minicomputers (DEC PDP-11, Varian Data Machines, MODCOMP etc.) and connected to proprietary Input/Output hardware. Sophisticated (for the time) continuous as well as <b>batch</b> <b>control</b> was implemented in this way. A more conservative approach was setpoint control, where process computers supervised clusters of analog process controllers. A workstation provided visibility into the process using text and crude character graphics. Availability of a fully functional graphical user interface was a way away.|$|E
