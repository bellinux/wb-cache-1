DNA-based methods are recognized as the most appropriate means to detect such fraudulent practices, however, these have not been extensively employed for the authentication of meat products available in South Africa. The {{aim of this study}} was to utilize a variety of molecular techniques to evaluate the extent of meat product mislabelling prevailing on the local market. A total of 139 processed meat products (minced <b>meats,</b> <b>burger</b> patties, deli <b>meats,</b> sausages and dried meats) were collected from retail outlets and butcheries in South Africa. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was employed for the detection of undeclared plant proteins (soya and gluten) in the samples. A commercial DNA-based LCD array was used to screen the samples for the presence of 14 animal species, the results of which were confirmed by species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in some cases also DNA sequencing. The results revealed that 95 of 139 (68 %) samples contained species which were not declared on the product labelling, with the incidence being highest in sausages, burger patties and deli meats. Soya and gluten were identified as undeclared plant proteins in a large number of samples (> 28 %), while pork (37 %) and chicken (23 %) were the most commonly detected animal species. Unconventional species such as donkey, goat and water buffalo were also discovered in a number of products. Overall, this study confirmed that the mislabelling of processed meats is commonplace in South Africa and not only violates food labelling regulations, but also poses economic, religious, ethical and health impacts.

30|$|Emulsion based product {{technology}} is the one which can transform meat of low organoleptic value into a highly acceptable product without tenderization. Therefore processing of meat from ducks and spent hens, a specialized product like sausages can be made affordable even to a low income society of under developed and developing countries. The deviations in consumers’ perception towards the fast food are giving impetus to this field. It is more economical to exploit spent ducks for preparing value added meat products by adding non-meat ingredients, curing salts and seasonings. Inclusion of non-meat additives as binders or extenders had been familiar in production of emulsion based meat products. The palatability of meat products is increased {{by the addition of}} various fat substitutes. Among non-meat additives used as fat substitutes, fillers, binders or extenders are wheat flour in chicken nuggets (Rao et al. 1997), soy-flour in buffalo <b>meat</b> <b>burgers</b> (Modi et al. 2003), liquid egg and soyprotein in goat meat patties (Gujral et al. 2002), amaranthus and buck wheat proteins in emulsion type products (Bejesano and Corke 1998), gram flour in low fat patties (Reddy and Rao 1997).|$|R
