5|$|Since {{silicon nitride}} <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> are harder than metal, this reduces {{contact with the}} bearing track. This results in 80% less friction, 3 to 10 times longer lifetime, 80% higher speed, 60% less weight, the ability to operate with {{lubrication}} starvation, higher corrosion resistance and higher operation temperature, as compared to traditional metal bearings. Silicon nitride balls weigh 79% less than tungsten carbide balls. Silicon nitride <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> {{can be found in}} high end automotive bearings, industrial bearings, wind turbines, motorsports, bicycles, rollerblades and skateboards. Silicon nitride bearings are especially useful in applications where corrosion, electric or magnetic fields prohibit the use of metals. For example, in tidal flow meters, where seawater attack is a problem, or in electric field seekers.|$|E
5|$|Silicon nitride {{bearings}} {{are both}} full ceramic bearings and ceramic hybrid bearings with balls in ceramics and races in steel. Silicon nitride ceramics have good shock resistance {{compared to other}} ceramics. Therefore, <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> made of silicon nitride ceramic are used in performance bearings. A representative example is use of silicon nitride bearings in the main engines of the NASA's Space Shuttle.|$|E

5|$|If two of {{the three}} given circles do not intersect, a center of {{inversion}} can be chosen so that those two given circles become concentric. Under this inversion, the solution circles must fall within the annulus between the two concentric circles. Therefore, they belong to two one-parameter families. In the first family (Figure7), the solutions do not enclose the inner concentric circle, but rather revolve like <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> in the annulus. In the second family (Figure8), the solution circles enclose the inner concentric circle. There are generally four solutions for each family, yielding eight possible solutions, consistent with the algebraic solution.|$|E
5|$|Bevan {{suggested}} a political deception {{with the aim}} of convincing the Swedish government that the Allies intended to invade Norway. During the war Sweden maintained a neutral position, and had relations with both Axis and the Allied nations. It was therefore assumed that if Sweden believed in an imminent threat to Norway this would be passed on to German intelligence. Graffham was envisioned as an extension of existing pressure the Allies were placing on Sweden to end their neutral stance, one example being the requests to end the export of <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> (an important component in military hardware) to Germany. By increasing this pressure with additional, false requests, Bevan hoped to further convince the Germans that Sweden was preparing to join the Allied nations.|$|E
5|$|The ships' main {{armament}} {{consisted of}} four smoothbore, muzzle-loading 11-inch Dahlgren guns mounted in two twin-gun turrets. The fore turret in each ship, except , {{was designed by}} Eads while the aft turret was the standard Ericsson design used in most Union monitors. Unlike the latter, which rested its entire weight on a central spindle {{that had to be}} elevated in order for the turret to rotate, Eads' design better distributed its weight because it rested on a number of <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> underneath {{the outer edge of the}} turret. The structure of the Eads turret extended down to be bottom of the ship and the entire structure rotated. The guns in the Eads turret were mounted on a steam-powered platform that moved up and down, so that the guns could be reloaded below deck, safe from enemy interference.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{deals with}} {{condition}} monitoring of an angular contact <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> in high speed at applicable axial loading in rotating {{systems such as}} motors or space actuators that nowadays {{can be found in}} a variety of consumer products. Some measuring methods of torque in instrument <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> in small motors or similar applications have been summarized. All these methods are not suitable for the extremely low torques and depend on dimensions of the systems. Therefore a completely new diagnosis tool for angular contact <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> with applied applicable axial loading at high speed, in applicable range is designed and developed. This tool allows us to gauge <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> quality and integrity, ensuring that precision specifications are under control, and the maximum efficiency can be gained. Through this tool the user ensures maximum performance of <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> by physically diagnosing of irregularities in bearing prior to use. Problems such as retainer hang-up, ball or race surface problems and contamination, can be determined on a bearing through different samplings...|$|R

40|$|The {{electrical}} {{characteristics of the}} <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> electric motor are studied for applied steady currents ranging from 43. 5 to 70. 15 A. It is found that the <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> behaves like a motor when it starts self-rotating meaning that the shaft and inner race of the pair of the <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> system start rotating by themselves {{without the help of}} any external agent, but with a small efficiency at high currents. During self-rotation, the motor's counterelectromotive force depends on the angular velocity of the shaft and inner race. The <b>ball</b> <b>bearing's</b> behavior at low currents is also explained when it is not self-rotating, (i. e., rotating {{with the help of a}} conventional motor). In the latter case, the motor does not behave like a generator. A theory, based on the electromagnetic interactions developed within each ball, is proposed to explain the action of the <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> as a motor. These interactions are caused by the ball's primary currents and magnetic fields and the effects of the induced magnetic field from the current of the motor's shaft...|$|R
