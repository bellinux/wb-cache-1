500|$|In the end, Wilder {{was happy}} with Monroe's performance, stating: [...] "Anyone can {{remember}} lines, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> real artist {{to come on the}} set and not know her lines and yet give the performance she did!" [...] Despite the difficulties of its production, Some Like It Hot became a critical and commercial success when it was released in March 1959. Monroe's performance earned her a Golden Globe for Best Actress, and prompted Variety to call her [...] "a comedienne with that combination of sex appeal and timing that just can't be beat". It has been voted one of the best films ever made in polls by the American Film Institute and Sight & Sound.|$|E
500|$|Portrayals of Roma {{have often}} been {{received}} positively by critics. Schreiber's portrayal in the 2005 Broadway revival was praised as that of [...] "a most crafty spider indeed", with the actor's grasp of the character's Chicago accent praised for its subtlety. Gillen's 2007 turn as Roma {{has been described as}} [...] "sweaty and aggressive with a hard, rodent-like quality", with reviewer Lyn Gardner of The Guardian finding the performance excellent. Manu Narayan's 2012 depiction was described as [...] "adding velocity" [...] to a [...] "high testosterone" [...] production, coming across as rhythmic and an effective focal point in the piece. Reviewing the 1992 film version, Roger Ebert praised Pacino's acting, writing [...] "any kid can play a war hero. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> real man to play a busted-down real estate salesman".|$|E
500|$|The Castle of Zafra in Guadalajara, Spain {{stood in}} for the Tower of Joy in the {{flashback}} scene involving a young Ned Stark and Ser Arthur Dayne, as witnessed by Bran Stark and the Three-eyed Raven. During filming of the scene, it was reported widely among media sources after {{a fan of the}} series had snuck their way onto a nearby mountain and filmed {{a small portion of the}} fighting scenes that occurred. Robert Aramayo (young Eddard Stark) spoke about the filming of the scene in an interview following the airing of the episode and stated, [...] "We all went through a bunch of training, which continued through our three- or four-day shoot in Spain. It was intense. It was not easy. I did not find it easy to shoot that fight sequence. It's not an easy routine at all. And Luke Roberts, who plays Arther Dayne, he's incredible, man." [...] He continued, [...] "If your move's getting blocked, you obviously can't know that, just like when you're playing a scene through dialogue. You can't know the response your scene partner gives you is going to be the response you'll get. You hope it is. Likewise, in a fight, if you're going to chop somebody's arm off or stab them in the gut — the intention is to chop that arm off or stab someone in the gut, and you have to play that intention fully. I didn't expect it, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> lot of skill in terms of acting to play." ...|$|E

However, he stood for election yet again several months later in the general election of 1924, again as an independent candidate, this time under the label of [...] "Constitutionalist" [...] although with Conservative backing, and was finally elected to represent Epping.
