5|$|Screensavers were {{designed}} {{to ensure that there}} would be no phosphor <b>burn-in</b> of images left on a CRT-based screen. Delrina added sound and basic interactivity with its series of screensaver products, arguably qualifying it as an early form of multimedia.|$|E
25|$|Subject to <b>burn-in</b> effect, {{although}} the cause differs from CRT {{and the effect}} may not be permanent, a static image can cause <b>burn-in</b> {{in a matter of}} hours in badly designed displays.|$|E

They are used in military equipment, in aerospace, in geological probes, in <b>burn-in</b> circuits and in high-quality audio circuits.

25|$|A {{screensaver}} (or screen saver) is {{a computer}} program that blanks the screen or fills it with moving images or patterns when the computer is not in use. The original purpose of screensavers was to prevent phosphor <b>burn-in</b> on CRT and plasma computer monitors (hence the name). Though modern monitors are not susceptible to this issue, screensavers are still used for other purposes. Screensavers are often set up to offer a basic layer of security, by requiring a password to re-access the device. Some screensavers use the otherwise unused computer resources to do useful work, such as processing for distributed computing projects.|$|E
25|$|Since LCD screens {{do not use}} phosphors, they do {{not suffer}} image <b>burn-in</b> when a static image is {{displayed}} on a screen {{for a long time}} (e.g., the table frame for an aircraft schedule on an indoor sign). LCDs are, however, susceptible to image persistence. The LCD screen is more energy-efficient and can be disposed of more safely than a CRT can. Its low electrical power consumption enables it to be used in battery-powered electronic equipment more efficiently than CRTs can be. By 2008, annual sales of televisions with LCD screens exceeded sales of CRT units worldwide, and the CRT became obsolete for most purposes.|$|E
2500|$|For CRTs used in public, such as ATMs and railway {{ticketing}} machines, {{the risk}} of <b>burn-in</b> is especially high because a stand-by display is shown whenever the machine is not in use. Older machines designed without <b>burn-in</b> problems taken into consideration often display evidence of screen damage, with images or text such as [...] "Please insert your card" [...] (in the case of ATMs) visible even when the display changes while the machine is in use. Blanking the screen {{is out of the}} question as the machine would appear to be out of service. In these applications, <b>burn-in</b> can be prevented by shifting the position of the display contents every few seconds, or by having a number of different images that are changed regularly.|$|E
2500|$|Modern CRTs {{are much}} less {{susceptible}} to <b>burn-in</b> than older models due to improvements in phosphor coatings, and because modern computer images are generally lower contrast than the stark green- or white-on-black text and graphics of earlier machines. LCD computer monitors, including the display panels used in laptop computers, are not susceptible to <b>burn-in</b> because the image is not directly produced by phosphors (although they can suffer from a less extreme and usually non-permanent form of image persistence).|$|E
2500|$|Another {{limit is}} that a shadow of an image may be visible after {{refreshing}} parts of the screen. Such shadows are termed [...] "ghost images", and the effect is termed [...] "ghosting". This effect is reminiscent of screen <b>burn-in</b> but, unlike screen <b>burn-in,</b> is solved after the screen is refreshed several times. Turning every pixel white, then black, then white, helps normalize the contrast of the pixels. This is why several devices with this technology [...] "flash" [...] the entire screen white and black when loading a new image.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{the advent}} of LCD screens, most {{computer}} screens were based on cathode ray tubes (CRTs). When the same image is displayed on a CRT screen for long periods, {{the properties of the}} exposed areas of phosphor coating {{on the inside of the}} screen gradually and permanently change, eventually leading to a darkened shadow or [...] "ghost" [...] image on the screen, called a screen <b>burn-in.</b> Cathode ray televisions, oscilloscopes and other devices that use CRTs are all susceptible to phosphor <b>burn-in,</b> as are plasma displays to some extent.|$|E
2500|$|The Atari 400 and 800's screens {{would also}} go through random screensaver-like color changes {{if they were}} left {{inactive}} for too long. The user {{had no control over}} this. These computers, released in 1979, are technically earlier [...] "screen savers." [...] And prior to these computers, the 1977 Atari VCS/2600 gaming console included color cycling in games like Combat or Breakout, in order to prevent <b>burn-in</b> of game images to 1970s-era televisions. In addition, the first model of the TI-30 calculator from 1976 featured a screensaver, which consisted of a decimal point running across the display after 30 seconds of inactivity. This was chiefly used to save battery power, as the LED display was more power intensive than later LCD models. These are examples of screensavers in ROM or the firmware of a computer.|$|E
50|$|<b>Burn-in</b> oven {{applications}} {{can be used}} {{in numerous}} different applications such as high-dissipation forward bias, high-temperature reverse bias, dynamic and static <b>burn-in</b> of microprocessors and other semiconductor devices.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of LCDs, the {{mechanics}} of <b>burn-in</b> are different than plasma and OLED, which develop <b>burn-in</b> from luminance degradation of the light-emitting pixels. For LCDs, <b>burn-in</b> develops in some cases because pixels permanently lose their ability {{to return to their}} relaxed state after a continued static usage profile. In most typical usage profiles, this image persistence in LCD is only transient.|$|E
50|$|Subject to <b>burn-in</b> effect, {{although}} the cause differs from CRT {{and the effect}} may not be permanent, a static image can cause <b>burn-in</b> {{in a matter of}} hours in badly designed displays.|$|E
50|$|Image <b>burn-in</b> {{occurs when}} very bright objects lie in one's field of vision, {{and should not}} be {{confused}} with closed-eye hallucinations. Visual <b>burn-in</b> from bright lights is visible for a few minutes after closing the eyes, or by blinking repeatedly, but the <b>burn-in</b> effect slowly fades away as the retina recovers, whereas the waking-consciousness CEV noise will not disappear if observed continuously over a period of time.|$|E
50|$|For {{electronic}} components, <b>burn-in</b> {{is frequently}} conducted at elevated temperature and perhaps elevated voltage. This process {{may also be}} called heat soaking. The components may be under continuous test or simply tested {{at the end of}} the <b>burn-in</b> period.|$|E
50|$|Plasma {{manufacturers}} have tried various ways of reducing <b>burn-in</b> such as using gray pillarboxes, pixel orbiters and image washing routines, but none {{to date have}} eliminated the problem and all plasma manufacturers continue to exclude <b>burn-in</b> from their warranties.|$|E
5000|$|Image <b>burn-in</b> {{occurs on}} CRTs and plasma panels {{when the same}} picture is {{displayed}} for long periods. This causes the phosphors to overheat, losing some of their luminosity and producing a [...] "shadow" [...] image that is visible with the power off. <b>Burn-in</b> is especially a problem on plasma panels because they run hotter than CRTs. Early plasma televisions were plagued by <b>burn-in,</b> {{making it impossible to}} use video games or anything else that displayed static images.|$|E
50|$|When possible, it {{is better}} to {{eliminate}} the root cause of early failures than doing a <b>burn-in.</b> Because of this, a process that initially uses <b>burn-in</b> may eventually phase it out as the various root causes for failures are identified and eliminated.|$|E
5000|$|Earlier {{generation}} displays {{were more}} susceptible to screen <b>burn-in</b> and image retention. Recent models have a pixel orbiter that moves the entire picture slower than is noticeable to the human eye, which reduces the effect of <b>burn-in</b> but does not prevent it.|$|E
50|$|Screen <b>burn-in,</b> image <b>burn-in</b> or ghost image, colloquially {{known as}} screen burn, is a {{permanent}} discoloration of areas on an electronic display such as a cathode ray tube (CRT) display or computer display monitor or television set caused by cumulative non-uniform usage of the pixels.|$|E
50|$|When the {{equivalent}} lifetime {{of the stress}} is extended into the increasing part of the bathtub-like failure-rate curve, {{the effect of the}} <b>burn-in</b> is a reduction of product lifetime. In a mature production {{it is not easy to}} determine whether there is a decreasing failure rate. To determine the failure time distribution for a very low percentage of the production, one would have to destroy a very large number of devices. By stressing all devices for a certain <b>burn-in</b> time the devices with the highest failure rate fail first and can be taken out of the cohort. Thus by applying a <b>burn-in,</b> early in-use system failures can be avoided at the expense (tradeoff) of a reduced yield caused by the <b>burn-in</b> process.|$|E
50|$|<b>Burn-in</b> ovens are {{designed}} for dynamic and static <b>burn-in</b> of integrated circuits and other electronic devices, including laser diodes. Typical sizes are from under ten to over , with air or nitrogen configurations. Operating temperatures can go over , and can use both single and multiple temperature settings.|$|E

50|$|The {{intention}} is to detect those particular components that would fail {{as a result of}} the initial, high-failure rate portion of the bathtub curve of component reliability. If the <b>burn-in</b> period is made sufficiently long (and, perhaps, artificially stressful), the system can then be trusted to be mostly free of further early failures once the <b>burn-in</b> process is complete.|$|E

50|$|There {{is another}} {{use of the}} term by some audiophiles, who leave new audio {{equipment}} turned on for multiple days or weeks, to get the components to achieve optimal performance. A complete headphone <b>burn-in</b> guide, as well as a <b>burn-in</b> player suitable for most headphones is provided by Tekfusion, an Indian audio brand. However, many debates have arisen about the benefits of this practice.|$|E
50|$|It is {{sometimes}} possible to remedy screen <b>burn-in</b> {{through the use}} of remedial software and remedial devices. This displays random colors on every pixel of the panel to fix the <b>burn-in,</b> but in severe cases (like physical damage) this may not resolve the problem. In the case of OLED screens on Android phones, <b>burn-in</b> reduction apps can display an inverted image of the navigation and status bars (which are constantly displayed and therefore the most likely elements to be burned in) to burn in opposite pattern, resulting in a screen that is entirely burned in (i.e. the entire display is dimmer than it was from the factory, but there are now no visibly burned in patterns).|$|E
50|$|<b>Burn-in</b> {{can still}} happen on LCD monitors, {{but only when}} the same image is {{displayed}} for weeks.|$|E
