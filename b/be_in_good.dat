5|$|While the Leslie {{speaker is}} still made and sold, similar effects {{can now be}} {{obtained}} via analogue electronic devices and digital emulation. Chorus and phase shifter devices can give an approximation of the sounds produced by a Leslie speaker. The Uni-Vibe, a four-stage phase shifter, was specifically marketed as a low-cost Leslie substitute for guitarists, and used a foot-operated fast/slow switch similar to the combo preamp. The pedal was popular, and notable users included Jimi Hendrix, David Gilmour and Robin Trower, but vintage units tend not to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>good</b> condition now due to the degradation of capacitors in the unit. Although {{the sound of a}} Leslie speaker heard in person is quite distinct, digital clones have become increasingly better at emulating it.|$|E
5|$|For {{one year}} it {{met in the}} {{basement}} of Pleasantville's public school (until the Briarcliff Farms building was completed), and did not provide housing. The farm building was completed in spring 1901 and dedicated on May 15. The large Colonial Revival building, with a plain exterior and wide halls, had lecture halls, a library, a laboratory, an office, a dining hall and dormitory space for 40 staff members and students. Its grounds had an orchard, a working garden, experimental greenhouses, poultry houses, a farmhouse and barns. The school's faculty included a director, a horticulturalist, an agriculturalist and instructors in nature study and cold storage. It was coeducational, with identical courses for men and women. Students were required to be proficient in English, provide good references, be at least 16 years of age, and <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>good</b> health. On January 1, 1902 Henry Francis du Pont, then in his third year at Harvard University, wrote to Powell requesting admission to the school; Powell replied that DuPont was listed first in the school's 1903 class. However, DuPont was unable to attend and left Harvard (perhaps due to his mother's sudden death in autumn 1902).|$|E
5|$|In July–August 2012, Kohli struck {{two centuries}} in the five-match ODI tour of Sri Lanka–106 off 113 balls at Hambantota and 128* off 119 balls at Colombo–winning {{man of the}} match in both games. India won the series 4–1 and on account of scoring the most number of runs in the series, Kohli was named player of the series. In the one-off T20I that followed, he scored a 48-ball 68, his first T20I fifty, and won the player of the series award. Kohli scored his second Test century at Bangalore during New Zealand's tour of India and won his first man of the match award in Test cricket. India won the two-match series 2–0, and Kohli {{averaged}} 106 with one hundred and two fifties from three innings. In the subsequent T20I series, he scored 70 runs off 41 balls, but India lost the match by one run and the series 1–0. He continued to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>good</b> form during the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka, with 185 runs from 5 matches {{at an average of}} 46.25. He hit two fifties during the tournament, 50 against Afghanistan in the group stage and 78* against Pakistan in the Super Eights, winning man of the match for both innings.|$|E

5|$|Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler ("Life Guards SS Adolf Hitler"; LSSAH) was {{an elite}} SS {{protection}} unit founded in 1933 as a palace guard to provide protection for Hitler's residences and offices. The LSSAH {{had some of}} the strictest entry requirements. The commander, Sepp Dietrich insisted that the men <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>good</b> physical condition, between the ages of 23 to 35, and have a confirmed ancestry record without Jewish lineage. The LSSAH eventually grew into an elite division of the Waffen-SS. Although nominally under Himmler, Dietrich was the real commander and handled day-to-day administration. By 1945, while the LSSAH fought on the Eastern Front during World War II, a core group of 800 men stayed in Berlin and made up the Leibstandarte Guard Battalion (Wache Reichskanzlei), assigned to guard the Führer.|$|E
5|$|On {{his arrival}} in Nuremberg, Hess was {{reluctant}} {{to give up some}} of his possessions, including samples of food he said had been poisoned by the British; he proposed to use these for his defence during the trial. The commandant of the facility, Colonel Burton C. Andrus of the United States Army, advised him that he would be allowed no special treatment; the samples were sealed and confiscated. Hess's diaries indicate that he did not acknowledge the validity of the court and felt the outcome was a foregone conclusion. He was thin when he arrived, weighing , and had a poor appetite, but was deemed to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>good</b> health. As one defendant, Robert Ley, had managed to hang himself in his cell on 24 October, the remaining prisoners were monitored around the clock. Because of his previous suicide attempts, Hess was handcuffed to a guard whenever he was out of his cell.|$|E
5|$|The Aggie Ring {{cannot be}} {{purchased}} unless specific requirements are met: a current student must <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>good</b> standing {{with a minimum}} 2.00 GPA on a 4.00 scale. In addition, the student must have completed 90 hours of coursework, including at least 45 hours at A Graduate students may receive a Ring after 75% of their graduate coursework is completed. If your graduate degree requires a thesis, your Ring will be delivered on Aggie Ring Day if the thesis has been defended by the deadline set by the Office of Graduate Studies. If the thesis has not been defended by this date, the Aggie Ring will be held until the qualification is met. A Ph.D. student may receive their Ring if they have completed all formal coursework in the degree plan, has a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or above, has successfully completed the residency requirement, has successfully passed the preliminary exam, and has an approved research proposal on file. A Ring may be purchased upon graduation if a student, either undergraduate or graduate, did not meet these criteria while pursuing the degree.|$|E

5|$|The {{figures of}} both Venus and Cupid were {{significantly}} altered during the painting process, {{the result of}} the artist's corrections to the contours as initially painted. Pentimenti can be seen in Venus's upraised arm, in the position of her left shoulder, and on her head. Infra-red reveals that she was originally shown more upright with her head turned to the left. An area on the left of the painting, extending from Venus's left foot to the left leg and foot of Cupid, is apparently unfinished, but this feature is seen in many other works by Velázquez and was probably deliberate. The painting was given a major cleaning and restoration in 1965–66, which showed it to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>good</b> condition, and with very little paint added later by other artists, contrary to what some earlier writers had asserted.|$|E
5|$|Two red keto-carotenoid pigments, {{canthaxanthin}} and adonirubin, {{are responsible}} for the redness in the red-capped robin's plumage. The birds are unable to synthesize these compounds themselves, and hence need to obtain them from their food. Carotenoids are costly to metabolise and are also required for use in immune function, hence birds need to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>good</b> condition to have enough left for use in red feathers. This makes red plumage a good advertisement to prospective mates. A 2001 field study at Terrick Terrick National Park in Victoria found that males who had greater reproductive success and were in better condition moulted into a brighter plumage the following year. However, male age and condition at the time were more likely to predict mating success for the following breeding season. Adult males can breed at one year of age and may do so while yet in non-breeding plumage, but they are less successful at reproducing at this age. The oldest recorded age is 5 years and 7 months for a bird banded near Beverley, Western Australia, in 1990.|$|E
