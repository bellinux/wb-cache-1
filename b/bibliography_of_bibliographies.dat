Moreover, it is a recent genre—even if the exact date of its emergence onto the literary scene is still subject to debate. 1 SF has also been known by many different generic labels prior to its current appellation, but they all connoted a certain image of scientific progress. 2 Despite its relative newness, SF has succeeded in generating an important amount of critical discourse: in the US, for instance, even <b>bibliographies</b> <b>of</b> <b>bibliographies</b> on the subject have been produced. 3 This intense critical activity, however, continues to remain fragmentary in nature: there are many lacunae in its findings {{and a lack of}} specific models against which to accurately define its perspectives. 4 Thematic issues, technological conjecture, and sociological implications have all drawn (albeit in rather chaotic fashion) their fair share of critical attention.
