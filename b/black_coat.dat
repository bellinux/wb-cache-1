5|$|He {{was dressed}} in a strange way. A šajkača was pulled to the front of his head and almost {{completely}} covered his forehead. His eyebrows were hardly visible. Under its weight, the ears seemed to have collapsed. He wore a kind of long, <b>black</b> <b>coat,</b> covered in mud and held in place by a string. He used another piece of string for a belt, and from it hung a pot for boiling water, a tea strainer, a canteen, and other useful things. He walked slightly bent forward, followed everywhere by the noise of the things clashing at his waist.|$|E
5|$|The black {{wildebeest}} has a {{dark brown}} or <b>black</b> <b>coat</b> which is slightly paler {{in summer and}} coarser and shaggier in the winter. Calves are born with shaggy, fawn-coloured fur. Males are darker than females. They have bushy and dark-tipped manes that, as in the blue wildebeest, stick up {{from the back of}} the neck. The hairs which compose this are white or cream-coloured with dark tips. On its muzzle and under its jaw it has black bristly hair. It also has long, dark-coloured hair between its forelegs and under its belly. Other physical features include a thick neck, a plain back, and rather small and beady eyes.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a greater}} number of colours of coat present in the Cardigan breed than the Pembroke, with the breed {{standard}} allowing for a variety of shades of red, sable and brindle. White markings are expected on this breed of Corgi, and one with a <b>black</b> <b>coat</b> is allowed to have tan or brindle points under conformation show rules. Merle markings are present in the breed, although this is normally restricted to blue merle. There are several disqualification criteria in the breed standard for the purpose of conformation showing. This would include drop ears, a white coat, blue eyes or non-solid black noses in dogs without merle colouration.|$|E

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a process {{for the production of}} an opaque coating on a circumferential surface of an optical component, in particular {{on the edge of a}} lens, whereby a <b>black</b> <b>coating</b> is applied to the circumferential surface. The invention proposes an improvement to said process by preventing air inclusions between the <b>black</b> <b>coating</b> applied to the circumferential surface and the circumferential surface, furthermore to reduce the stress exerted on optical component by the process which would otherwise impair the desired optical characteristics through the occurrence of internal stresses. This is achieved by the invention in that, after application of the <b>black</b> <b>coating,</b> the optical component is subjected to the influence of microwave radiation which then heats the <b>black</b> <b>coating,</b> melts it and finally cures it by heat or bakes it on the circumferential surface of the component...|$|R

5|$|It {{begins with}} a young girl playing in the {{backyard}} as snow falls on the ground. The scene shifts {{to that of a}} bedside, where a young woman who has died, lies. Her husband covers her with a white sheet as a priest prays. Madonna, wearing a long, <b>black</b> <b>coat,</b> sings the song underneath a snow-covered, dead tree, as the young girl plays with her dead mother's jewelry. The husband comes and shouts at the girl, tearing away the woman's pearl necklace which drop at the little girl's feet. The adult Madonna is shown lying beside another man singing the song as the little girl visits her mother's grave. The man gets up and slaps Madonna in the face, as the little girl cries in front of the grave. She is taken away from the graveyard by her father, as interspersed scenes show the girl being kissed by her mother, her trying to reach the knob of a door, and Madonna powdering the bruise mark on her face.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} the video was meant to {{illustrate}} the lyrics of the song. It depicts the sexual fantasies of a rich and bored housewife played by Beyoncé who tries to seduce her man while having breakfast at her house wearing a white robe. The video opens with various shots of a big mansion in which the singer is seen {{in one of the}} rooms. She tries to get her man's attention while he reads a newspaper. As he does not notice her, she throws a napkin on the floor and her female servant comes to lift it. The clip transitions to scenes of Beyoncé dressed in a Victorian jeweled outfit with a mask in her hands, lip-syncing the lyrics and dancing to the rhythm of the song. Afterwards, she is seen entering a limousine in which Jay-Z is already inside. Scenes of Beyoncé with a <b>black</b> <b>coat</b> and lingerie walking in front of the car are also intertwined throughout.|$|E

50|$|In {{the modern}} {{thermopile}} pyranometers the active (hot) junctions of the thermopile are located beneath the <b>black</b> <b>coating</b> surface and are heated by the radiation absorbed from the <b>black</b> <b>coating.</b> The passive (cold) junctions of the thermopile are fully protected from solar radiation and in thermal {{contact with the}} pyranometer housing, {{which serves as a}} heat-sink. This prevents any alteration from yellowing or decay when measuring the temperature in the shade, thus impairing the measure of the solar irradiance.|$|R

Bedouin women usually wear brightly coloured long dresses but outside they wear 'abaya' (a thin, long <b>black</b> <b>coat</b> sometimes covered with shiny embroidery) and they will always cover their head and hair with a 'tarha' (a black, thin shawl) when they leave their house.|$|E
25|$|Heim gave Bello {{the name}} Grosser Schweizer Sennenhund and {{dismissed}} the first {{representative of a}} newly named breed from the ring. Heim wrote the first standard based on Bello, and Schertenleib started to search for {{other members of the}} new breed. He found two short-haired bitches and breeding began. The first Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs were stockier and rougher than the modern dogs; the skulls were wider than desirable today and showed a marked stop. Judging from old pictures, the coloring was bad; the <b>black</b> <b>coat</b> was mixed with yellow wool at the neck, flanks and rear.|$|E
25|$|Two covers {{were created}} for The Fame Monster, {{both of which}} were shot by French {{photographer}} Hedi Slimane. In the artwork of the standard edition, Gaga is seen sporting a blond wig and a sleek, angular <b>black</b> <b>coat,</b> the collar of which covers the lower half of her face. The image of the deluxe version sees the singer draped in thick brown hair, her face embellished with heavy, streamy black eyeliner. At first Gaga had a dispute with her record label over the artwork; Interscope found the brunette cover to be too dark and gothic for a mainstream release. However, Gaga explained to them that both would be suitable with the yin and yang concept of the album and ultimately they agreed. The font used on the cover is the sans-serif letterform used by Christian Dior in their campaigns.|$|E

25|$|As black colored wolves occur more {{frequently}} in forested areas than on the tundra (black coats occur in about 62% of wolves in the forested areas of the Canadian Arctic, compared with about 7% in the icy tundra), melanism was concluded by the researchers to give those wolves an adaptive advantage. The mutation’s purpose {{has not yet been}} identified. Dr Barsh ruled out camouflage, as wolves have few natural predators, and {{there is no evidence that}} a <b>black</b> <b>coat</b> color leads to any increase in hunting success rates. Dr. Barsh observed that beta-defensin is involved in providing immunity to viral and bacterial skin infections, which might be more common in forested, warmer environments. It has been suggested that the mutation's association with forested habitats means that the prevalence of melanism should increase as forests expand northward. Dark fur is believed to be dominant in wolves. A mating between a black and a gray wolf resulted in ten pups with dark fur out of a total of fourteen.|$|E
25|$|The men {{are well}} dressed, Graham smokes a pipe while wearing a fur-lined red velvet cape {{and a red}} velvet cap which is {{slightly}} askew. The grey coat he wears with a white neckerchief is opened at the chest, revealing a gold-brocade waistcoat, his lower half is clothed in breeches, stockings and slippers. The chaplain wears a <b>black</b> <b>coat</b> with a white collar, grey stockings and black shoes with gold buckles, the costume of a social inferior to Graham, but indicating his educated status. The clerk's dress is similarly simple, a brown jacket, bluish-green waistcoat and white collar, while the steward wears a white apron, smock and cap with a black collar, and brown trousers. The black servant's dress is richer, a white cap and pink neckerchief, and a green buttoned velvet coat with a yellow waistcoat. Trump wears Graham's wig. The colours of the painting are mostly of cool greys, blues and reds, with the brown {{of some of the}} clothes and the wooden pilaster panelling, and the lighter blue through the window on the left of the painting.|$|E
25|$|The eastern wolf {{was first}} {{recognized}} as a distinct species in 1775 by German naturalist Johann Schreber, who termed it loup noir (black wolf). His depiction of the animal however showed it with a <b>black</b> <b>coat,</b> an atypical coloration in eastern wolves. It was later reclassified as a subspecies of gray wolf by Edward Nelson and Goldman. In 2000, the taxonomic status of the eastern wolf was once again brought into question when a genetic study on canids from Algonquin Provincial Park undertaken in Trent University showed that the local wolves bore similarities to red wolves, based on DNA profiles at eight microsatellite loci. Furthermore, sequences were found in both eastern and red wolves that diverged from those of coyotes by 150,000–300,000 years, and no specimens of either species from the 1960s bore any gray wolf mitochondrial DNA. The scientists involved in this study proposed that the eastern and red wolf were the same species, and that the two be combined under the earlier binomial name of C. lycaon. However, this conclusion was disputed, with one study indicating that the eastern wolf is a gray wolf–coyote hybrid and Mammal Species of the World listed it in 2005 as a subspecies of gray wolf.|$|E
