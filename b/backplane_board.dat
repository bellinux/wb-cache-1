NectarCAM will be finely pixelated (~ 1800 pixels for a 8 degree field of view, FoV) in order to image atmospheric Cherenkov showers by measuring the charge deposited within a few nanoseconds time-window. It will have additional features like the capacity to record the full waveform with GHz sampling for every pixel and to measure event times with nanosecond accuracy. An array of a few tens of medium size telescopes, equipped with NectarCAMs, will achieve up to a factor of ten improvement in sensitivity over existing instruments in the energy range of 100 GeV to 10 TeV.

Optical interconnections within systems and packages transmit data rates up to some Gbit/s with low loss, crosstalk, EMV-sensitivity or reflections. But here the fibers provide no satisfying assembling strategies. To find a more efficient solution, the Fraunhofer IZM has developed a packaging concept, which is based on a hybrid carrier containing both, electrical and optical interconnects: the EOCB (Electrical Optical Circuit Board). The key element is an additional optical layer with waveguide structures. This layer is handled by standard PCB technology. The result is, that waveguides are incorporated into the circuit board. For first tests we used the hot embossing process for foil structuring. After core filling and sealing it with an over-cladding, the optical layer is given into the PCB process. But other solu tions for the waveguide structuring are possible too. They are currently under development. The EOCB uses multimode waveguides to relax assembly tolerances. It has an interface to common SMD technology. Therefore the EOCB concept merges with current methods of manufacturing equipment.

2500|$|A {{consulting}} company in San Leandro, California, IMS Associates Inc., wanted to purchase several Altair computers but the long delivery time convinced {{them that they}} should build their own computers.

40|$|Optical {{interconnects}} {{are considered}} a promising solution for long distance and high bitrate data transmissions, outperforming electrical interconnects in terms of loss and dispersion. Due to the bandwidth and distance advantage of optical interconnects, longer links have been implemented with optics. Recent studies show that optical interconnects have clear advantages even at very short distances - intra system interconnects. The biggest challenge for such optical interconnects is the alignment tolerance. Many free space optical components require very precise assembly and installation, and therefore the overall cost could be increased. This thesis studied the misalignment tolerance and possible alignment correction solutions for optical interconnects at <b>backplane</b> or <b>board</b> level. First the alignment tolerance for free space couplers was simulated and the result indicated the most critical alignments occur between the VCSEL, waveguide and microlens arrays. An in-situ microlens array fabrication method was designed and experimentally demonstrated, with no observable misalignment with the waveguide array. At the receiver side, conical lens arrays were proposed to replace simple microlens arrays for a larger angular alignment tolerance. Multilayer simulation models in CodeV were built to optimized the refractive index and shape profiles of the conical lens arrays. Conical lenses fabricated with micro injection molding machine and fiber etching were characterized. Active component VCSOA was used to correct misalignment in optical connectors between the <b>board</b> and <b>backplane.</b> The alignment correction capability were characterized for both DC and AC (1 GHz) optical signal.

Furthermore, active matrix pixels and display drivers can be integrated together by standard CMOS technology for driving OLED. As a result, a novel microdisplay can be implemented by integrating OLED on a silicon backplane. Liquid-crystal-on-silicon (LCoS) microdisplay is well developed for head mount display (HMD) applications, there are limitations of high power consumption of backlight and complicated optical system. OLED microdisplay solves these problems by self electroluminescence and high efficiency. Moreover, the size can be as compact as LCoS and good for HMD application. The silicon backplane for OLED is developed. There are two topics on design. One is the pixel driving circuit, which has to ensure the current continuously flow through OLED. The major problem is process variation that affects the uniformity of luminance. The process independent pixel driving schemes are proposed.

40|$|The MC 100 LVEP 111 {{is a low}} skew 1 −to− 10 {{differential}} driver, {{designed with}} clock distribution in mind, accepting two clock sources into an input multiplexer. The PECL input signals can be either differential or single−ended (if the VBB output is used). HSTL inputs can be used when the LVEP 111 is operating under PECL conditions. The LVEP 111 specifically guarantees low output−to−output skew. Optimal design, layout, and processing minimize skew within a device and from device to device. To ensure tightest skew, both sides of differential outputs identically terminate into 50 � even if only one output is being used. If an output pair is unused, both outputs may be left open (unterminated) without affecting skew.

The two clock inputs are one differential HSTL and one differential LVPECL. Both input pairs can accept LVDS levels. They are selected by the CLK_SEL pin which is LVTTL. To avoid generation of a runt clock pulse when the device is enabled/disabled, the Output Enable (OE), which is LVTTL, is synchronous ensuring the outputs will only be enabled/disabled when they are already in LOW state (Figure 9).

40|$|T {{has been}} widely used to remove {{machining}} oils from metals after those metals have been stamped and formed. In many cases, removal of the hydrocarbon machining oils is necessary before the metals can undergo further processing such as electroplating. In other situations, the stamping occurs as the last {{step in the process}} and the formed metal parts must be cleaned before packaging and shipping. Because the CFC solvents have been implicated in stratospheric ozone depletion, AT&T has developed a policy that calls for a 50 % reduction in emissions by 1991 with eventual discontinuation of emissions in manufacturing processes by 1994. To comply with the corporate goals, alternative methods of metal cleaning must be developed. These methods may involve cleaning techniques that do not depend upon CFCs or processes that do not result in contaminated parts.

CubeSat frames are usually made of aluminum alloys, this study looks into the possibilities of using polymers and polymer based composites in a custom structural design for the NTNU test satellite (NUTS). This is done for the potential weight reductions of the structural framework and supporting structures. This can be beneficial also in other CubeSat project that has a thigh weight budget. The satellite will use <b>backplane</b> circuit <b>board</b> layout in contrast to common stacking using spacers. The design integrates these parts in the structural support.

The study also covers the component layout, general mechanical concept development and materials selection of the satellite primary and secondary structures. This includes integration of components like magnetorquers, solar cells, batterypack, antenna structures and small required components like launch deployment - switches and ?springs. The environment parameters and loads of the launch and orbit stages combined with requirements to CubeSats and spacecraft structures are reviewed. This entails the effect the environment has on polymers and polymer composite materials. In the launch phase this includes thermal changes, wear and friction and also quasi-static loads, vibrations and shocks. In the orbit environment it includes thermal changes, radiation, erosion, micrometeorites, outgassing and surface charging. These effects are considered in the further design and sizing of the structures. Relevant materials are suggested based on listed requirements, collected material properties recorded in space experiments and recommendations from standards. Issues with using composite and polymer materials in design of small structures are discussed. Structural analyses are researched and applied using FEM based analyses. Some advanced analysis methods were researched as tools to run response analysis in relation to shock and vibration loads and also orbit thermal loads. Work is also done looking at relevant production, prototyping and testing methods for the different structures. This has included vacuum bagging, press molding and milling of aerospace carbon/epoxy prepreg. The results of the study presents new design concepts for parts in the assembly, and some candidate materials like glass and carbon fiber reinforced epoxy, cyanate and bismaleimide resins. A detailed CAD model of the CubeSat concept assembly is produced along with drawings and prototypes of parts of the concept. The results of the FEM analysis show that the structure should support the defined loads using the current geometry and materials, some higher stressed areas were also identified. An advanced thermal model was built and its function is explained along with how to attain better results. The functions of setting up dynamic response analyses are also explained, to get satisfying results from these models more knowledge of the damping characteristics of the materials are needed. Modal analyses show responses of some parts, and how their natural frequencies can be increased. The main findings in designing with composites are challenges with fasteners and combinations with mixed material assemblies due to thermal expansion and galvanic corrosion. Issues in using polymer materials in a CubeSat is related to surface properties and wear effects during launch, and also the materials reaction to the space environment related effects. There is potential for mass savings, but the concept needs some further refinement. The production methods explored are thought to be applicable in further work. </p...|$|R
40|$|UnrestrictedPhotoacoustic {{microscopy}} is an {{imaging technique}} which draws from the specific strengths of two imaging modalities by capturing {{the contrast of}} optical imaging, while retaining the high resolution of ultrasonic imaging. It provides great promise for studying the structure and dynamics of tissue micro-vasculature in development and pathogenesis. Previous work in photoacoustic imaging has been mostly limited to single element transducers. This thesis presents results of a novel photoacoustic microscopy system using a 30 MHz linear array and a custom receive electronics. There are {{two versions of the}} system, PAM I and PAM II. Both systems are comprised of three main components, a short pulsed laser, a high frequency transducer, and a custom multi-channel electronics system. The attraction towards high frequency arrays over single element transducers is natural; they offer the same resolution advantage of higher frequencies, while diminishing the need for mechanical scanning through steering of the beam, delivering aperture flexibility, tighter focusing capabilities through beamformation, and the capability to image in real-time.; The PAM I system includes an Nd:YAG pumped tunable dye laser, delivering a 6. 5 ns pulse duration, and a 10 Hz pulse repetition rate to the sample via an optical fiber. Furnishing an incident energy of approximately 6 mJ/cm 2 at 584 nm, the laser induced acoustic waves via thermoelastic expansion. Using a 30 MHz linear array and a custom multi-channel receive system, both phantom and in situ photoacoustic images were obtained. The receiving transducer array is a piezo-composite 48 element linear array, with an 8 mm focal depth, and a - 6 dB fractional bandwidth of 50 %. Multi-channel receive electronics were developed to include multiplexing and signal processing stages. Four-to-one multiplexers are used to select between elements. The signals are passed through filtering stages, followed by variable and fixed gain stages. The system receiver gain varies from 33 dB- 73 dB, with a - 3 dB system response between 8 MHz and 55 MHz. The channels are further multiplexed to acquire data from a 4 channel oscilloscope. Using offline delay and sum beamforming, initial results provided phantom images from an 80 µm hair in water, and a 6 µm carbon fiber in an optically scattering medium similar to biological tissue. Photoacoustic images in situ clearly showed subcutaneous vessels less than 100 µm in diameter imaged at depths of 3 mm below the skin surface in a Sprague Dawley rat.; The PAM II system is a 16 channel fully automated parallel multi-channel system that acquires data from all elements on the receive board at once. Controlled by the user interface and the PC, the PAM II system uses the receiver front end analog board and is complimented by custom digital electronics. The digital portion of the system is a <b>backplane</b> motherboard/channel <b>board</b> scheme. Individual channel boards simultaneously digitize the echoes from the receiver at a 100 MHz sampling rate. Digital data are then stored in temporary memory and transferred via the PCI bus to the PC with an NI- 6534 (National Instruments, Houston, TX) acquisition board. A Labview program was developed to handle system triggering, and control signals to the digital board and receiver multiplexers. PAM II uses an Isonnolab Edgewave laser pumping 6 ns pulses at 598 nm using an electro-optic Q-switch, delivering an incident energy of below 15 mJ/cm 2. Phantom images in water and Intralipid solution were formed to characterize the system. Photoacoustic images of micro-vessels in a human hand and 3 D images of vasculature in two Sprague Dawley rats were obtained in vivo.

The ILC Reference Design Report calls for 6. 7 km circumference damping rings (which prepare the beams for focusing) using “conventional” stripline kickers driven by fast HV pulsers. Our primary goal was to determine the suitability of the 16 MeV electron beam in the AØ region at Fermilab for precision kicker studies. We found that the low beam energy and lack of redundancy in the beam position monitor system complicated the analysis of our data. In spite of these issues we concluded that the precision we could obtain was adequate to measure the performance and stability of a production module of an ILC kicker, namely 0. 5 %. We concluded that the kicker was stable to an accuracy of ~ 2. 0 % and that we could measure this precision to an accuracy of ~ 0. 5 %. As a result, a low energy beam like that at AØ {{could be used as a}} rapid-turnaround facility for testing ILC production kicker modules. The ILC timing precision for arrival of bunches at the collision point is required to be 0. 1 picosecond or better. We studied the bunch-to-bunch timing accuracy of a “phase detector” installed in AØ in order to determine its suitability as an ILC bunch timing device. A phase detector is an RF structure excited by the passage of a bunch. Its signal is fed through a 1240 MHz high-Q resonant circuit and then down-mixed with the AØ 1300 MHz accelerator RF. We used a kind of autocorrelation technique to compare the phase detector signal with a reference signal obtained from the phase detector’s response to an event at the beginning of the run. We determined that the device installed in our beam, which was instrumented with an 8 -bit 500 MHz ADC, could measure the beam timing to an accuracy of 0. 4 picoseconds. Simulations of the device showed that an increase in ADC clock rate to 2 GHz would improve measurement precision by the required factor of four. As a result, we felt that a device of this sort, assuming matters concerning dynamic range and long-term stability can be addressed successfully, would work at the ILC. Cost effective operation of the ILC will demand highly reliable, fault tolerant and adaptive solutions for both hardware and software. The large numbers of subsystems and large multipliers associated with the modules in those subsystems will cause even a strong level of unit reliability to become an unacceptable level of system availability. An evaluation effort is underway to evaluate standards associated with high availability, and to guide ILC development with standard practices and well-supported commercial solutions. One area of evaluation involves the Advanced Telecom Computing Architecture (ATCA) hardware and software. We worked with an ATCA crate, processor monitors, and a small amount of ATCA circuit boards in order to develop a <b>backplane</b> “spy” <b>board</b> that would let us watch the ATCA backplane communications and pursue development of an inexpensive processor monitor that could be used as a physics-driven component of the crate-level controls system. We made good progress, and felt that we had determined a productive direction to extend this work. We felt that we had learned enough to begin designing a workable processor monitor chip if there were to be sufficient interest in ATCA shown by the ILC community. Fault recognition is a challenging issue in the crafting a high reliability controls system. With tens of thousands of independent processors running hundreds of thousands of critical processes, how can the system identify that a problem has arisen and determine the appropriate steps to take to correct, or compensate, for the failure? One possible solution might come through the use of the OpenClovis supervisory system, which runs on Linux processors and allows a select set of processors to monitor the behavior of individual processes and processors in a large, distributed controls network. We found that OpenClovis exhibited an irritating amount of sensitivity to the exact version of the Linux kernel running on the processors, and that it was poorly equipped to help us sort through problems that arose through conflicts so deep in the operating systems of the processors. But once this issue was addressed, we found that it performed as expected, recognizing crashes and process (and processor) failures...|$|R
