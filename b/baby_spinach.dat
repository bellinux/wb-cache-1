40|$|Since furan is {{classified}} as "possibly carcinogenic to humans," many studies investigated furan concentrations in foods. However, no data {{are available on the}} impact of food ingredients on the retention or release of furan from food. These data are important, since they explain the differences in furan removal during domestic food preparation. Furan retention was studied by spiking various samples with D- 4 -furan and comparing D- 4 -furan evaporation from these samples with comparable aqueous solutions. in addition, furan concentrations were determined. Furan retention caused by starch gels was negligible. Oils caused high furan retention: peak areas of furan in oils ranged from 22 to 25 % of the corresponding aqueous solutions. In addition, in coffee, furan retention was mainly caused by the lipophilic fraction. However, since furan retention was also found in defatted coffee and coffee grounds, other coffee constituents also have the ability to retain furan. Peak areas of furan in the headspace of baby foods ranged from 71 to 97 % of those in water.

This quantitative microbial risk assessment describe the change of L. monocytogenes concentration in fresh <b>baby</b> <b>spinach</b> from farm to table. This model also consists of several scenarios to evaluate decontamination treatments, cross-contamination, and temperature abuse. Cross-contamination was the biggest issue when ensuring safety of leafy green vegetables. Temperature abuse also increased the risk of listeriosis. On the other hand, irradiation treatment with Modified Atmosphere Packaging reduced the number of annual cases of listeriosis by 99. 99 %. In addition, the validation of L. innocua used as a surrogate for L. monocytogenes in fresh <b>baby</b> <b>spinach</b> was evaluated based on reductions by washing (water and chlorine) treatments and growth at temperatures between 5 and 36 oC. According to the results of the washing treatments, the concentration of L. innocua was reduced by almost 0. 5 log CFU/g. This is more than that of L. monocytogenes. Furthermore, the effect of natural background microflora on the growth of L. monocytogenes and L. innocua in fresh <b>baby</b> <b>spinach</b> was determined. The results showed that the growth of L. innocua was affected more than that of L. monocytogenes at temperatures 10 > T > 30 ^(o) C. Although L. innocua and L. monoctogenes are genetically similar, their behavior changes under stress conditions. Ultimately, the dynamic growth models for L. monocytogenes in fresh <b>baby</b> <b>spinach</b> was presented.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} the use of different doses of UV-C (0, 2. 4, 7. 2, 12 and 24 kJm− 2) radiation treatments to inhibit microbial growth of Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella enterica. The spoilage bacteria Pseudomonas marginalis (gram negative) was also tested. These bacteria were studied under in vitro conditions and in <b>baby</b> <b>spinach</b> leaves (in vivo conditions) for 13 and 14 dat 5 ◦C, respectively. All radiation doses were effective in reducing bacterial growth, although contrary to expectations, high doses did not show the highest microbial inhibition in in vitro experiments. UV-C doses (2. 4 – 24 kJm− 2) were also used on <b>baby</b> <b>spinach</b> (Spinacia oleracea L.) leaf surfaces, stored under humidified air using perforated plastic film. A clear inhibitory UV-C effect was observed on L. monocytogenes for 14 d at 5 ◦C. Meanwhile, UV-C radiation reduced S. enterica loads until the first 4 d of storage, after which a significant increase was found on radiated leaves compared to the control. P. marginalis counts were slightly reduced in UV-C treated leaves. In addition, significant decreases in psychrotrophic counts and Enterobacteriaceae were found during the first 4 d of storage. Respiration rates of <b>baby</b> <b>spinach</b> leaves were higher in radiated than in non-radiated leaves. Moreover, no obvious damage on the epidermal surface and to cell shape was detected in radiated and non-radiated leaves by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). In summary, the use of double-sided UV-C radiation, at low doses, was effective in reducing initial microbial counts of the tested bacteria types and psychrotrophic and Enterobacteria counts, and in keeping L. monocytogenes at low levels during the storage period, without affecting the sensory quality of fresh-cut <b>baby</b> <b>spinach</b> leaves.

A total of 1171 samples of pre-packaged or bulk leafy greens from domestic (24. 25 %) and imported (75. 75 %) sources were collected at retail outlets from 11 Canadian cities between April 2014 and March 2015. The samples were processed by shaking or stomaching in an elution buffer followed by oocyst isolation and concentration. DNA extracted from the wash concentrates was tested for C. cayetanensis, Cryptosporidium spp., and T. gondii using our previously developed and validated 18 S rDNA qPCR assay with a universal coccidia primer cocktail and melting curve analysis. Test samples that amplified and had a melting temperature and melt curve shape matching the C. cayetanensis, C. parvum, C. hominis, or T. gondii controls were sequenced to verify the presence of target DNA. Cyclospora cayetanensis was identified in 3 samples of arugula (USA origin), 1 sample of baby arugula (USA and Mexico), 1 sample of <b>baby</b> <b>spinach</b> (USA), and 1 sample of spring mix (USA).

40|$|Increase in {{consumption}} of fresh cut produce {{over the past}} decade has resulted in a rise in incidents of food borne outbreaks due to pathogens. Conventional techniques of sanitizing washes may not be effective since the organic matter released from the fresh produce use up the free chlorine thus reducing the sanitizing potential of wash water just when it is needed most and a heat treatment step to kill pathogens cannot be applied if the purpose is to consume fresh produce. Electron beam (e-beam) irradiation was used to treat cut cantaloupe, cut roma tomatoes, <b>baby</b> <b>spinach,</b> romaine lettuce which were surface inoculated with a cocktail of Salmonella and E. coli O 157 :H 7. Results showed that irradiation reduced Salmonella and E. coli O 157 :H 7 significantly with increasing doses at 0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 6, 0. 8, and 1. 0 kGy. The D 10 -value for Salmonella on irradiated cut cantaloupe, cut roma tomatoes, <b>baby</b> <b>spinach,</b> and romaine lettuce was found to be 0. 71 kGy, 0. 64 kGy, 0. 19 kGy, and 0. 23 kGy respectively. The D 10 -value for E. coli O 157 :H 7 on the produce listed above was found to be 0. 73 kGy, 0. 54 kGy, 0. 18 kGy, and 0. 20 kGy respectively. Low dose e-beam irradiation was found to be an excellent tool for ensuring the reduction of spoilage organisms and extending shelf life in cut cantaloupe, cut roma tomatoes, <b>baby</b> <b>spinach,</b> romaine lettuce, strawberries, and green onion. The produce were tested for 12 days of storage for aerobic plate count, yeast and mold, lactic bacteria, color, texture, and respiration rate as a function of irradiation doses 0, 1, 3, and 5 kGy. Aerobic plate counts, yeast counts, and lactic acid bacteria were reduced appreciably at all doses tested on all commodities. Molds did not grow on any samples including control for cut cantaloupe, cut tomatoes, and green onion but for the other commodities, mold was reduced {{at the same rate as}} yeasts and vegetative bacteria. Lactic acid bacteria were reduced at all doses while the reduction was highest with 5 kGy in all commodities. When irradiated with 5 kGy, during storage, strawberries, spinach, and green onion displayed wet, soggy and mushy appearance, romaine lettuce leaves were wilted, had a translucent midrib and brown pigmentation. E-beam irradiation increased respiration rate for all samples on day 0 compared to non-irradiated control irrespective of the commodity type and the effect was dose dependent. Firmness reduced appreciably for cut roma tomatoes, <b>baby</b> <b>spinach,</b> strawberries, romaine lettuce, and green onion with increasing doses. Cut cantaloupe was low in firmness but the effect was not dose dependent. Irradiation at low doses is a promising tool to reduce pathogens and enhance keeping quality of cut cantaloupe, cut tomatoes, <b>baby</b> <b>spinach,</b> romaine lettuce, strawberries, and green onion. Irradiation is to be implemented as part of an overall HACCP plan and is not meant to replace existing control measures...|$|E
40|$|Chen, HaiqiangAn {{increasing}} number of outbreaks associated with fresh produce such as <b>baby</b> <b>spinach</b> {{have been reported in}} the last two decades with Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 being one of the most frequent causative agents. Chlorinated water has been widely used by food industry to wash these fresh commodities, but this washing procedure has limited efficacy and can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances. Thus, more effective and safer treatment methods are needed to control pathogens in fresh produce. In our first study, several generally recognized as safe organic acids and hydrogen peroxide in combination with mild heat (40 and 50 ̊C) was tested for their efficacies against E. coli O 157 :H 7 on <b>baby</b> <b>spinach.</b> Chlorinated water (200 ppm free chlorine) only reduced the population of E. coli O 157 :H 7 on <b>baby</b> <b>spinach</b> by 1. 2 - 1. 6 log CFU/g, which was not significantly different from DI water washing. Washing with 1 % lactic acid (LA) alone or in combination with citric acid or hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) at 40 ̊C for 5 min was the most effective treatment achieving a 2. 7 log reduction of E. coli O 157 :H 7. In the second study, aerosolization was investigated as a potential way to apply allyl isothiocyanate (AIT), H 2 O 2, acetic acid (AA) and LA on fresh <b>baby</b> <b>spinach</b> to control E. coli O 157 :H 7 during 10 days of storage at 4 ̊C. Treatment of aerosolized 5 % AIT resulted in > 5 log reduction of E. coli O 157 :H 7 on spinach regardless if the samples are pre-washed or not; however, this treatment impaired the sensory quality of leaves. Addition of LA to AIT improved the efficacy of AIT against E. coli O 157 :H 7 during the storage. Treatment of 3 % H 2 O 2 washing followed by a 2 -min treatment of aerosolized 1 % AIT + 2. 5 % LA reduced E. coli O 157 :H 7 on spinach leaves by 4. 8 log CFU/g after 10 days storage at 4 ̊C without causing noticeable adverse effects on the appearance of samples. Therefore, low dose application of AIT in combination with LA has the potential to control E. coli O 157 :H 7 on fresh produce. University of Delaware, Department of Food ScienceM. S...|$|E

40|$|Fresh {{produce is}} {{increasingly}} implicated in outbreaks of foodborne illness. Internalization of bacterial pathogens into produce {{is of particular}} concern as internalized pathogens {{are unlikely to be}} removed by surface sanitizers. It is therefore necessary to develop treatments that will reduce their prevalence and numbers on fresh produce. Irradiation is a penetrating nonthermal treatment that effectively eliminates bacteria. Irradiated <b>baby</b> <b>spinach</b> leaves up to 1. 0 kGy showed negligible (P> 0. 05) changes in color, texture, vitamin C, total carotenoids, and chlorophyll content compared to non-irradiated controls throughout storage (15 days at 4 oC). This research also shows that irradiation effectively reduces viable Escherichia coli cells internalized in lettuce, and that decontamination is not influenced (P> 0. 05) by lettuce variety. Irradiation effectively reduced the population of internalized pathogens in a dose-dependent manner (3 - 4 log reduction at 1. 0 kGy). Microscopy images suggest that the contamination sites of pathogens in leafy vegetables are mainly localized on crevices and in the stomata. A careful design of the treatment (understanding dose distribution) will effectively eliminate pathogens while maintaining produce quality. The use of modified atmosphere packaging increased (P< 0. 05) the sensitivity of pathogens (Salmonella spp. and Listeria spp.) to irradiation in <b>baby</b> <b>spinach</b> leaves (up to 25 %). Increasing concentration of oxygen increased (P< 0. 05) sensitivity of both microorganisms. Radiosensitization could be affected (P< 0. 05) by production of ozone, which increases with increasing dose-rate and oxygen concentration, and reducing temperatures. Antimicrobial effectiveness of various active compounds was determined against Salmonella spp. and Listeria spp. Inclusion complexes were prepared with antimicrobial compounds and -cyclodextrin. The effectiveness of the microencapsulated compounds was tested by spraying them on the surface of <b>baby</b> <b>spinach</b> leaves inoculated with Salmonella spp. The increase in radiosensitivity (up to 40 %) varied with the antimicrobial compound. Spherical poly (DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles with entrapped eugenol and trans-cinnamaldehyde were synthesized for future antimicrobial delivery applications. All loaded nanoparticles proved to be efficient in inhibiting growth of Salmonella spp. and Listeria spp. The entrapment efficiency for eugenol and trans-cinnamaldehyde was 98 % and 92 %, respectively.

Electron microscopy analysis of tainted leaves revealed STEC bacteria in the internal cavity of the stomata, in intercellular spaces, and within vascular tissue (xylem and phloem), where the bacteria were protected from the bactericidal effect of gentamicin, sodium hypochlorite or ozonated water treatments. We confirmed that the T 3 S escN mutant showed a reduced number of bacteria within the stomata suggesting that T 3 S is required for the successful colonization of leaves. In agreement, non-pathogenic E. coli K- 12 strain DH 5 α transformed with a plasmid carrying the LEE pathogenicity island, harboring the T 3 SS and effector genes, internalized into stomata more efficiently than without the LEE. This study highlights a role for pili, flagella, and T 3 SS in the interaction of STEC with spinach leaves. Colonization of plant stomata and internal tissues may constitute a strategy by which STEC survives in a nutrient-rich microenvironment protected from external foes and may be a potential source for human infection...|$|E
40|$|Foodborne {{outbreaks}} {{associated with}} leafy greens {{are attributed to}} many factors including cross-contamination between harvesting equipment and leafy greens. The objectives of the first study were a) to evaluate the efficacy of organic sanitizers and plant antimicrobials on these tools, and b) to determine if modified designs of coring knives are easier to decontaminate {{in comparison to the}} original design. Recently plant extracts and essential oils are gaining popularity due to their antimicrobial properties and being viewed as natural compounds. Studies have shown that plants compounds have antimicrobial activities both in vitro and in foods. However, studies regarding the effects of these antimicrobials on the organoleptic properties of foods are limited. The objectives of the second study were to a) perform sensory analysis to identify plant extracts or essential oils with highest preference liking by consumers in organic leafy greens; b) identify the effects of these compounds on sensory attributes of treated organic leafy greens; and c) determine changes in firmness and color properties of treated organic leafy greens. In order to reduce the strong aroma and flavor characteristics associated with essentials oils and plants extracts, these compounds can be incorporated into edible films. Edible films are thin layer of films made using fruit or vegetable pulp containing plant antimicrobials. The main objective of the last study was to determine preference liking by consumers and changes in physical properties of organic <b>baby</b> <b>spinach</b> treated with antimicrobial edible films. Three different designs of coring tools were evaluated. Coring tools were inoculated with S. Newport and treated with one of the following: deionized water, 50 ppm bleach, 3 % hydrogen peroxide, 5 % Chico wash™, 0. 1 % Oregano oil, 0. 4 % SaniDate 5. 0 ®, 3 % fulvic acid, or 0. 1 % oregano oil for 5 min. The surviving Salmonella populations on the tools were determined by swabbing four different locations on the tools and plating onto xylose lysine desoxycholate (XLD) agar. After inoculation with Salmonella overnight culture (8 log CFU/ml), an average of 6. 35 log CFU/cm² attached onto the original coring tool, 6. 31 log CFU/cm² on modified design 1, and 6. 26 log CFU/cm² on modified design 2 coring tools. When comparing the efficacy of sanitizers, 3 % H₂O₂ had the highest reductions of 5. 98 ± 0. 56 - 6. 22 ± 0. 29 log CFU/cm² in Salmonella population. Treatments with 0. 39 % SaniDate 5. 0 ® and 0. 1 % oregano oil were comparable (to hydrogen peroxide) which yielded reductions of 5. 89 ± 0. 80 - 6. 19 ± 0. 22 log CFU/cm² and 5. 51 ± 0. 58 - 5. 90 ± 0. 46 log CFU/cm², respectively. When comparing the four locations on these tools, the greatest reduction was seen at location 2 / 3 on all three designs of coring tools. Organic iceberg lettuce and <b>baby</b> <b>spinach</b> were washed with various essential oils, plant extracts, and their combinations in tap water for 2 min. After wash treatment, each sample was stored at 4 °C for 20 - 24 h before performing sensory evaluation and measuring changes in physical properties (color and texture) of leafy greens. A randomized block design with an affective test was used and 60 panelists were asked to evaluate each sample for preference liking based on a 9 -point hedonic scale where 9 was extremely liked and 1 not liked at all. Preference liking was evaluated for the following parameters: aroma, color, freshness, mouthfeel, flavor, and overall acceptability. Additionally, panelists quantified each sample using a 5 -point hedonic scale for the following attributes: pungency, browning, bitterness, off-odor, and sourness. Changes in firmness values and color of leafy greens were measured using Texture Analyzer and Chroma meter, respectively. Similar procedure was followed for sensory analysis of <b>baby</b> <b>spinach</b> treated with antimicrobial edible films wherein the edible films were added to bagged spinach. Edible films were made from hibiscus, apple, or carrot pulp which included 0. 5 %, 1. 5 %, or 3 % of carvacrol or cinnamaldehyde. Forty panelists were asked to evaluate each sample based on preference liking and identify intensity of sensory attributes (pungency, browning, bitterness, off-odor, and sourness). Changes in color and firmness values were measured for organic <b>baby</b> <b>spinach</b> treated with edible films in plastic bags. Sensory analysis showed that washing organic iceberg lettuce and <b>baby</b> <b>spinach</b> with 0. 1 % cinnamon oil had the highest preference liking (7 -moderately liked) and the least impact on sensory attributes (1 -not affected at all) of these leafy greens. Similar results were observed for spinach leaves treated with cinnamaldehyde containing edible films showing higher preference liking values in comparison to those treated with carvacrol containing edible films. Our results also indicated that essential oils had higher impact on the firmness values and plant extracts had higher impact on the color properties of leafy greens. For textural analysis, washing iceberg lettuce with 0. 1 % oregano oil in combination with 10 % olive extract yielded the highest firmness value (F= 783. 1 ± 53. 8). For spinach, samples washed with 0. 1 % lemongrass oil in combination with 1 % apple extract yielded the highest firmness value (F= 939. 30 ± 35. 2). Additionally, no significant difference (p≤ 0. 05) was found in firmness or color values of <b>baby</b> <b>spinach</b> treated with edible films containing plant antimicrobials. Results from the coring tool study will provide alternative organic sanitizer options for washing these tools which are more effective than currently used chemical sanitizers such as bleach. Findings from the sensory study will help in identifying appropriate antimicrobial treatments for washing organic leafy greens. Additionally, use of edible films with essential oils may prevent the adverse effects due to the direct application of essential oils on organic leafy greens...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate a Photohydroionization (PHI) panel (novel advanced oxidation technology) and varying concentrations of lactic acid washes for controlling E. coli O 157 :H 7 on <b>baby</b> <b>spinach.</b> Leaves were dip inoculated with a five-strain cocktail of E. coli O 157 :H 7 inoculum having a concentration between 5 - 6 log CFU/ml. Leaves were submerged in inoculum for 30 s and dried for 1 h. Non-inoculated and inoculated leaves were washed for 30 s in food grade lactic acid diluted to concentrations of 0. 5, 1. 0, or 2. 0 % and allowed to dry for 10 min. For PHI treatment, leaves were placed under the PHI panel and treated for 1, 2, or 5 min on both sides for total treatment times of 2, 4 or 10 min. Following treatments, leaves were either sealed in low-density polyethylene bags or enumerated. Samples were enumerated at 0, 3, 7, 10, and 14 days following inoculation. Ten gram samples were diluted with sterile peptone and stomached for one min, and then 0. 1 ml was plated onto sorbitol MacConkey agar with cefixime and tellurite plates that were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. For lactic acid treatments, E. coli O 157 :H 7 populations were different (P 0. 05) due to sampling time so sampling times where pooled together for each lactic acid concentration of 0. 5, 1. 0, and 2. 0 % and resulted in 2. 01, 2. 78, and 3. 67 log CFU/g reductions, respectively. Leaves treated with 1. 0 % and 2. 0 % lactic acid had color degradation and were organoleptically unacceptable by day 14. When leaves were treated with PHI for 1, 2, or 5 min per side, E. coli O 157 :H 7 populations were reduced 1. 6, 1. 49, or 1. 95 log CFU/g, respectively. Leaves treated with PHI were not different from one another, but were different (P < 0. 05) from the positive control. No color change occurred in leaves treated with PHI. The PHI panel and lactic acid washes of 0. 5 % or higher are effective in reducing E. coli O 157 :H 7 in <b>baby</b> <b>spinach...</b>|$|E
40|$|Given {{the high}} {{susceptibility}} of <b>baby</b> <b>spinach</b> leaves to thermal processing, {{the use of}} high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) is explored as a non-thermal blanching method. The effects of HHP were compared with thermal blanching by following residual activity of polyphenol oxidases and peroxidases, colour retention, chlorophyll and carotenoids content, antioxidant capacity and total polyphenols content. Spinach subjected to 700 MPa at 20 ºC for 15 min represented the best treatment among the conditions studied due to its balanced effect on target enzymes and quality indices. The latter treatment reduced enzyme activities of polyphenol oxidases and peroxidases by 86. 4 and 76. 7 %, respectively. Furthermore, leaves did not present changes in colour and an increase by 13. 6 % and 15. 6 % was found in chlorophyll and carotenoids content, respectively; regarding phytochemical compounds, retentions of 28. 2 % of antioxidant capacity and 77. 1 % of polyphenols content were found. Results demonstrated that HHP (700 MPa) at room temperature, when compared with thermal treatments, presented better retention of polyphenols, not significantly different chlorophyll and carotenoids content and no perceptible differences in the instrumental colour evaluated through ΔE value; therefore, it {{can be considered a}} realistic practical alternative to the widely used thermal blanching...|$|E
40|$|Escherichia coli {{serogroup}} O 157 is {{the pathogen}} most {{commonly associated with}} foodborne disease outbreaks, but epidemiological studies suggest that non-O 157 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) is a major player as well. The ten most clinically relevant STECs belong to serogroups O 26, O 103, O 111, O 145, O 157, O 91, O 113, O 128, O 45, and O 121; but emerging strains, such as O 104 :H 4 that was identified with the 2011 German outbreak, could become more prevalent in the future. A 75 -min conventional multiplex PCR assay, IS- 5 P, targeting the four virulence factors stx 1, stx 2, eae, and ehxA plus the O 157 :H 7 - specific + 93 uidA single nucleotide polymorphism was developed to better assess the potential pathogenicity of STEC isolates. All 212 STEC DNAs showed one to five amplification products, while the non- E. coli DNA did not react to this multiplex PCR assay. Enrichment broths obtained from <b>baby</b> <b>spinach,</b> alfalfa sprouts, and cilantro artificially inoculated with O 26, O 103, and O 121 STECs reacted positively to the multiplex assay. Unlike the current FDA BAM 5 P PCR, designed for the specific detection of O 157 :H 7, IS- 5 P will identify potentially harmful O 157 :H 7 and non-O 157 STECs {{so they can be}} removed from the nation’s food supply...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} calcium {{application}} and solution pH on ready-to-eat (RTE) baby-leaf spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) texture and structure preservation was studied. Spinach leaves {{were treated with}} calcium chloride, calcium lactate and calcium propionate, at two different pH conditions (5 and 7), packaged and stored for 7 days at 5 C. After 24 h, the leaves crispness increased 49 and 29 % for leaves treated with calcium chloride and lactate at pH 5 and the elasticity increased 100 % after calcium propionate treatment at pH 7. During spinach shelf-life, the tissue flexibility decreased (20 – 60 %) for all calcium treatments at pH 5 and 7 while tissue crispiness increased (7 – 40 %) only for calcium treatments under pH 7. The electrolyte leakage increased throughout storage and was higher for all calcium treated samples when compared with controls. The chlorophyll content slightly decreased (12 %) {{by the end of}} product shelf-life and did not differ according the calcium treatments. Total vitamin C content was lower in leaves treated with calcium chloride at pH 5 (31 %) and pH 7 (19 %) while the remaining treatments did not affect vitamin C content. The different calcium additives tested for potential texture quality maintenance did not provide the expected benefits on <b>baby</b> <b>spinach</b> leaves but increasing solution pH from 5 to 7 lead to an increased firmness by the end of shelf-life. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) is a {{foodborne}} pathogen {{responsible for}} human diarrheal disease. EHEC {{lives in the}} intestinal tract of cattle and other farm and wild animals, {{which may be the}} source of environmental contamination particularly of agricultural fields. Human infections are associated with consumption of tainted animal products and fresh produce. How the bacteria interact with the plant phyllosphere and withstand industrial decontamination remain to be elucidated. The goals of the present study were to investigate the environmental conditions and surface structures that influence the interaction of EHEC O 157 :H 7 with <b>baby</b> <b>spinach</b> and lettuce leaves in vitro. Independently of the production of Shiga toxin, EHEC O 157 :H 7 colonizes the leaf surface via flagella and the type 3 secretion system (T 3 SS). Ultrastructural analysis of EHEC-infected leafy greens revealed the presence of flagellated bacteria, and mutation of the fliC flagellin gene in EHEC EDL 933 rendered the bacteria significantly less adherent, suggesting the involvement of flagella in the bacteria-leaf interaction. EDL 933 mutated in the escN (ATPase) gene associated with the function of the T 3 SS but not in the eae (intimin adhesin) gene required for adherence to host intestinal cells had significantly reduced adherence compared with that of the parental strain. The data suggest a compelling role of flagella and the T 3 SS in colonization of leafy green produce. Colonization of salad leaves by EHEC strains may be a strategy that ensures survival of these bacteria in the environment and allows transmission to the human host.

40|$|In 2006, a large {{outbreak}} of Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 {{was linked to}} the consumption of ready-to-eat bagged <b>baby</b> <b>spinach</b> in the United States. The likely sources of preharvest spinach contamination were soil and water that became contaminated via cattle or feral pigs in the proximity of the spinach fields. In this study, we compared the transcriptional profiles of 12 E. coli O 157 :H 7 isolates that possess the same two-enzyme pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) profile and are related temporally or geographically to the above outbreak. These E. coli O 157 :H 7 isolates included three clinical isolates, five isolates from separate bags of spinach, and single isolates from pasture soil, river water, cow feces, and a feral pig. The three clinical isolates and two spinach bag isolates grown in cultures to stationary phase showed decreased expression of many σS-regulated genes, including gadA, osmE, osmY, and katE, compared with the soil, water, cow, feral pig, and the other three spinach bag isolates. The decreased expression of these σS-regulated genes was correlated with the decreased resistance of the isolates to acid stress, osmotic stress, and oxidative stress but increases in scavenging ability. We also observed that intraisolate variability was much more pronounced among the clinical and spinach isolates than among the environmental isolates. Together, the transcriptional and phenotypic differences of the spinach outbreak isolates of E. coli O 157 :H 7 support the hypothesis that some variants within the spinach bag retained characteristics of the preharvest isolates, whereas other variants with altered gene expression and phenotypes infected the human host...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge about ribonucleic acids (RNAs) {{and their}} roles has {{recently}} been expanded by extensive studies seeking to uncover novel RNAs using biochemical techniques.

This study focuses on fluorescence-based methods of in vivo RNA visualization. Using fluorescent light has transformed the study of micro-molecular components due to its many advantages.

40|$|A {{retail demand}} model {{measured}} {{the impact of}} the Food and Drug Administration’s 2006 announcement warning consumers about E. coli O 157 : H 7 contamination in spinach. Model results indicated that bulk lettuces were shock substitutes (in contrast to price substitutes) as consumers purchased fewer spinach products and more bulk lettuce of all types. Results also showed that consumers initially moved away from bagged salads without spinach; but consumer confidence rebounded quickly and expenditures rose. Over a period of sixty-eight weeks, retail expenditures decreased 20 % for bagged spinach and 1 % for bulk spinach. Retail expenditures for all leafy greens declined just 1 %. On September 14, 2006, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) an-nounced that consumers should not eat bagged spinach. Epidemiological evidence pointed to bagged spinach as a possible cause of an ongoing multistate food-borne illness outbreak of the potentially deadly bacterium Escherichia coli (E. coli) O 157 : H 7 (Calvin). The next day FDA expanded the warning to include all fresh spinach. FDA had never before made such a sweeping statement about any U. S. -grown produce item. Stores and restaurants immediately removed spinach from their shelves and menus. Spinach harvesting and marketing ceased and there was no U. S. spinach on the market for five days. After FDA determined that bagged <b>baby</b> <b>spinach</b> was the only contaminated product and lifted its warning, consumers did not immediately return to their previous consumption patterns. FDA’s announcement was unique in several ways. Typically, by the time an outbreak associated with fresh produce is detected and the contaminated item is identified, the outbreak is over and the product in question has long since been consumed or discarded. As a result, there is usually no benefit to warning con-sumers about consumption of contaminated fresh fruit and vegetables, and suc...|$|E
