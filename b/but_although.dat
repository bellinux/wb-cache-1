5|$|In 1688, Charles' brother, James II, faced {{widespread}} revolt and {{a potential}} invasion of England by William of Orange. Holmes was a supporter of James, <b>but</b> <b>although</b> he intended to control Yarmouth Castle on the monarch's behalf, the local inhabitants and the garrison at Yarmouth sided with William, preventing him from openly siding with the King.|$|E
5|$|Mary's {{death on}} 28 December 1694 (O.S.) {{eventually}} led to a formal but cool reconciliation between WilliamIII and Anne, now heir to the throne. Marlborough hoped that the rapprochement would lead to his own return to office, <b>but</b> <b>although</b> he and Lady Marlborough were {{allowed to return to}} court, the Earl received no offer of employment.|$|E
5|$|The present lake {{is about}} one-third of its {{original}} size, <b>but</b> <b>although</b> now relatively small it supports {{a wide variety of}} wildlife, including foxes, weasels, rabbits, hedgehogs, lapwings, kestrels, herons, coot, Canada Geese, and several varieties of newt. In 2007 the park was designated a Local Nature Reserve, one of only two in Trafford.|$|E

5|$|After {{a one-day}} tournament in South Africa, West Indies {{returned}} home for Test and ODI series against Pakistan. The ODI series was drawn, but the West Indies defeated Pakistan 2–0 in the Tests. Ambrose took nine wickets at 23.11 to be {{fifth in the}} team bowling averages. The Wisden report suggested that {{he was suffering from}} fatigue after his team's busy schedule, <b>but</b> <b>although</b> not at his best, he continued to take important wickets. For Northamptonshire in 1993, Ambrose was second in the team first-class bowling averages with 59 wickets at 20.45.|$|E
5|$|Although Carabane {{was once}} a {{regional}} capital, the village has since become so politically isolated {{from the rest of}} the country that it no longer fits into any category of the administrative structure decreed by the Senegalese government. The Jola account for the majority of the island's population and Jola society has no formal hierarchy. The indigenous population was originally animist, <b>but</b> <b>although</b> the sacred groves and fetishes survive as cultural icons of Casamance, the monotheistic belief systems of Catholicism and Islam have become the most widely held in Carabane. The literacy rate is approximately 90%. Students attend a primary school on the island, but must move at least as far as Elinkine to continue their studies.|$|E
5|$|As the 19th century wore on non-conformist ministers {{increasingly}} {{began to}} conduct services within the workhouse, but Catholic priests were rarely welcomed. A variety of legislation {{had been introduced}} during the 17th century to limit {{the civil rights of}} Catholics, beginning with the Popish Recusants Act 1605 {{in the wake of the}} failed Gunpowder Plot that year. <b>But</b> <b>although</b> almost all restrictions on Catholics in England and Ireland were removed by the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829, a great deal of anti-Catholic feeling remained. Even in areas with large Catholic populations, such as Liverpool, the appointment of a Catholic chaplain was unthinkable. Some guardians went so far as to refuse Catholic priests entry to the workhouse.|$|E

5|$|Carry {{leaves the}} home that Fenwick has found her and wanders distraught. Eventually, {{she returns to}} the mill, half {{resolved}} to see her old home and then drown herself in the millstream. There she is greeted lovingly by her mother and sister. Her father reluctantly allows her {{to remain in the}} family home; eventually he too forgives her, although he can never forget the shame she has brought on the family. Carry remains with her family {{for the rest of her}} life, <b>but</b> <b>although</b> she has returned to decency, her past ensures that she will never find an honest husband.|$|E
5|$|Deforestation {{has also}} caused {{population}} declines for the vulnerable Yunnan and yellow-billed nuthatches. The Yunnan nuthatch can cope with some tree loss, since it prefers open pine woodland, <b>but</b> <b>although</b> still locally common, it has disappeared from {{several of the}} areas in which it was recorded in the early 20th century. The threat to yellow-billed is particularly acute on Hainan, where more than 70% of the woodland has been lost in the past 50 years due to shifting cultivation and the use of wood for fuel during Chinese government re-settlement programmes.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the novel was {{considered}} a classic for primary school children in the UK, and in the United States it was a staple of high-school suggested reading lists. Modern critics consider the book's worldview to be dated and imperialist, <b>but</b> <b>although</b> less popular today, The Coral Island was adapted into a four-part children's television drama broadcast by ITV in 2000.|$|E

5|$|On 22 November, Albert I entered Brussels {{with the}} Belgian {{army of the}} Yser in a Joyous Entry. The King was widely {{acclaimed}} by the civilian population. Subsequently, some of the notable activisten from the RVV were put on trial <b>but,</b> <b>although</b> the body had professed as many as 15,000 followers, only 312 individuals were convicted of collaboration with the enemy. Among them was Borms who, from prison, would continue {{to play an important}} role in the Flemish Movement in the 1920s. In total, 40,000 Belgian soldiers and civilians were killed and 77,500 wounded during World War I.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Army began {{training}} paratroops in December 1942 as {{an offshoot}} of the training of Independent Companies. The 1st Parachute Battalion was subsequently formed in March 1943. It reached full strength by January 1944, <b>but,</b> <b>although</b> it was warned for action a number of times, including the possible rescue of prisoners of war held at Sandakan in 1945, it did not see any fighting. After the war it participated in the reoccupation of Singapore.|$|E
5|$|The Basingstoke {{committee}} then investigated {{a link to}} the Andover Canal, but in December 1792, interest switched back to a {{link with}} the Itchen. A meeting was held in Southampton, which was chaired by the mayor and included James D'Arcy on the committee. It became part of a much grander scheme to link Bristol to Salisbury, and onwards to London, <b>but</b> <b>although</b> most of this soon died away, the Itchen to Basingstoke link was still being considered in 1796, by which time it was called the London and Southampton Ports Junction Canal. Two routes were surveyed by different engineers, one costing £127,000 and the other £157,566.|$|E

5|$|The SEAD {{campaign}} was halted, <b>but</b> <b>although</b> the IAF possessed no operational {{answer to the}} massive air defence array forming west of the Canal, it nevertheless still enjoyed supremacy in the air-ro-air arena. On July 30, 69 Squadron took part in Operation Rimon 20, a ruse designed to draw Soviet-flown MiG-21s into battle. In the ensuing dogfight, five Soviet fighters were downed, of which one was shot down by Avihu Ben-Nun with Shaul Levi and another by Aviem Sella with Reuven Reshef. With no side securing a clear advantage, yet both able to claim military achievements, American pressure soon bore fruit and a ceasefire marking {{the end of the}} war came into effect on August 7, 1970.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{the death}} of William, Lord of Glamorgan, his {{extensive}} holdings were eventually granted to Gilbert de Clare in 1217. The subjugation of Glamorgan, begun by Fitzhamon, was finally completed by the powerful De Clare family, <b>but</b> <b>although</b> Gilbert de Clare had now {{become one of the}} great Marcher Lords the territory was far from settled. Hywel ap Maredudd, lord of Meisgyn captured his cousin Morgan ap Cadwallon and annexed Glynrhondda in an attempt to reunify the commotes under a single native ruler. This conflict was unresolved by the time of De Clare's death and the area fell under Royal control.|$|E
5|$|After his {{establishment}} in Aleppo, in winter 945–946, Sayf al-Dawla resumed the old Muslim custom of launching annual raids into Byzantine territory. This first operation was of limited scope and {{was followed by}} a prisoner exchange. Warfare on Byzantium's eastern frontiers then subsided for a couple of years, and recommenced only in 948. Initially, the Byzantines were led by the Domestic of the Schools (commander-in-chief) Bardas Phokas the Elder, <b>but</b> <b>although</b> he was capable enough as a subordinate commander, his tenure as commander-in-chief proved largely a failure. In 948–950 the Byzantines scored a few successes, sacking the border fortresses of Hadath and Marash. Bardas' second son, Leo, distinguished himself in these years, especially in November 950, when he ambushed Sayf al-Dawla, who had previously defeated his father in battle, in a mountain pass; Sayf al-Dawla lost 8,000 men and barely escaped himself.|$|E

5|$|An {{army officer}} of Slavic origin from the Pontus region (now {{north-eastern}} Turkey), Thomas rose to prominence, {{along with the}} future emperors Michael II and Leo V the Armenian (r. 813–820), {{under the protection of}} general Bardanes Tourkos. After Bardanes's failed rebellion in 803, Thomas fell into obscurity until Leo V's rise to the throne, when Thomas was raised to a senior military command in central Asia Minor. After the murder of Leo and usurpation of the throne by Michael the Amorian, Thomas revolted, claiming the throne for himself. Thomas quickly secured support from most of the themes (provinces) and troops in Asia Minor, defeated Michael's initial counter-attack and concluded an alliance with the Abbasid Caliphate. After winning over the maritime themes and their ships as well, he crossed with his army to Europe and laid siege to Constantinople. The imperial capital withstood Thomas's attacks by land and sea, while Michael II called for help from the Bulgarian ruler khan Omurtag. Omurtag attacked Thomas's army, <b>but</b> <b>although</b> repelled, the Bulgarians inflicted heavy casualties on Thomas's men, who broke and fled when Michael took to the field a few months later. Thomas and his supporters sought refuge in Arcadiopolis, where he was soon blockaded by Michael's troops. In the end, Thomas's supporters surrendered him in exchange for a pardon, and he was executed.|$|E
5|$|Catholic priests from Yucatán founded several mission towns around Lake Petén Itzá in 1702–1703. The first {{towns to}} be {{concentrated}} into colonial reducciones were Ixtutz, {{which became the}} new town of San José, and neighbouring San Andrés, both {{on the north shore}} of Lake Petén Itzá. They were first subjugated by one of Ursúa's officers, Cristobal de Sologaistoa, before being passed into the care of the Dominican friars for the Christian conversion of the inhabitants. Surviving Itza and Kowoj were resettled in the new colonial towns by a mixture of persuasion and force. Kowoj and Itza leaders in these mission towns rebelled against their Spanish overlords in 1704 and almost retook Nojpetén, <b>but</b> <b>although</b> well-planned, the rebellion was quickly crushed. Its leaders were executed, and most of the mission towns were abandoned; by 1708 only about 6,000 Maya remained in central Petén. The reductions failed in large part because the missionaries charged with converting the inhabitants could not speak the Itza language.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{original}} version having been broadcast on PBS, a pilot episode for an American version (known as Red Dwarf USA) was produced through Universal Studios {{with the intention of}} broadcasting on NBC in 1992. The show essentially followed the same story as the first episode of {{the original}} series, using American actors for most of the main roles: Craig Bierko as Lister, Chris Eigeman as Rimmer, and Hinton Battle as Cat. Exceptions to this were Llewellyn, who reprised his role as Kryten, and the British actress Jane Leeves, who played Holly. It was written by Linwood Boomer and directed by Jeffrey Melman, with Grant and Naylor onboard as creators and executive producers. Llewellyn, Grant and Naylor travelled to America for the filming of the American pilot after production of the fifth series of the UK series. According to Llewellyn and Naylor, the cast were not satisfied with Linwood Boomer's script. Grant and Naylor rewrote the script, <b>but</b> <b>although</b> the cast preferred the re-write, the script as filmed was closer to Boomer's version. The pilot episode includes footage from the UK series in its title sequence, although it did not retain the logo or the theme music of the UK series. During filming of the pilot, the audience reaction was good and it was felt that the story had been well received.|$|E
