50|$|Scruffey was a Private-Owner <b>ballast</b> <b>truck</b> {{owned by}} one S. C. Ruffey and based at Tidmouth. After Oliver {{had been pushed}} down a {{turntable}} well by trucks, Scruffey led the other trucks in singing rude songs about the accident. However, Toad the brake van (see above) had a plan to control the trucks, giving Oliver guidance on marshalling them two by two and Scruffey last and making sure he had sand on the rails {{to give him a}} good grip. When Scruffey told the other trucks to hold back he was pulled apart between them and Oliver. This wasn't so much a result of Oliver's strength as the fact that Scruffey suffered from rotten wood and rusty frames, and would probably have fallen apart anyway. This fact was kept from the other trucks, who now believe Oliver to be extremely strong, and not an engine to be antagonised.|$|E

5000|$|A {{possible}} {{reason for the}} construction of the loop line connecting through to St Kilda was the difficulty experienced by contractors in constructing a rail crossing over the Yarra River at Cremorne, known in the early 19th century as [...] "Forrest Hill". Although today the area is noted for the imposing Melbourne High School to the east of the railway embankment and exclusive houses of South Yarra to the west, in the mid-19th century, the railway bisected a vast swamp. Cooper (1924; p. 181) reports that when the rail embankment was first being constructed it subsided, burying <b>ballast</b> <b>trucks</b> in the swamp. The cost of recovering the trucks was deemed to be uneconomic, so a second embankment was constructed over them.|$|R
