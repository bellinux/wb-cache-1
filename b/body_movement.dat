5|$|For the game's {{character}} sculpting and rigging, {{the team}} introduced various new elements {{that were not}} used in their previous games. Lead character technical director Judd Simantov found {{that the creation of}} the faces was the most challenging, in terms of hardware. For the faces, the team used joint-based facial rigs, with some blend-shape correctives. To reta{{in the shape of the}} face and avoid awkward movement, the faces were rigged with the mouth open and eyes slightly closed. The faces were also based on the Facial Action Coding System, allowing for an anatomical-based approach. The use of a higher mesh density also allowed more volumes and creasing in the shape of the face, creating cleaner silhouettes and shapes and giving enough geometry to sculpt correctives. In an attempt to add subtle features, pupil dilation was added to the character models. For the bodies, the team edited the character movements from Uncharted 2, softening some joint alignment. The animation of carpal joints was also added for the game, allowing more dynamic hand shapes, and flexibility. Another subtle addition was the arm mover controls, allowing minor editing on the arms; though this feature was previously available, it was opened up to the animators for The Last of Us. A muscle system was also added, adding muscle shells that bulge, based on attachment joint distance; the muscle system, written in Maya within a few days, works in real time. To solve an issue in which <b>body</b> <b>movement</b> resulted in awkward movement of clothing, runtime helpers were implemented. A total of 326 joints were used in the full character model, with 98 of these in the face; 85 of these are runtime driven, while 241 are locked into animation.|$|E

The investigated categories of <b>body</b> <b>movements</b> belong to the Laban Effort Framework: Strong—Light, Free—Bound and Sudden—Sustained. All <b>body</b> <b>movements</b> were represented {{by a set of}} activities used for data collection. The calculated accuracy of detecting the <b>body</b> <b>movements</b> was based on collecting data from a single wireless tri-axial accelerometer sensor. Ten healthy subjects collected data from three body locations (chest, wrist and thigh) simultaneously in order to analyze the locations comparatively. The data was then processed and analyzed using Machine Learning techniques. The wrist placement was found to be the best single location to record data for detecting Strong—Light <b>body</b> <b>movements</b> using the Random Forest classifier. The wrist placement was also the best location for classifying Bound—Free <b>body</b> <b>movements</b> using the SVM classifier. However, the data collected from the chest placement yielded the best results for detecting Sudden—Sustained <b>body</b> <b>movements</b> using the Random Forest classifier. The study shows that the choice of the accelerometer placement should depend on the targeted type of movement. In addition, the choice of the classifier when processing data should also depend on the chosen location and the target movement...|$|R

25|$|Swimming {{butterfly}} {{is difficult}} if the core is not utilized, and correct timing and <b>body</b> <b>movement</b> makes swimming butterfly much easier. The body moves in a wave-like fashion, {{controlled by the}} core, and as the chest is pressed down, the hips go up, and the posterior breaks the water surface and transfers into a fluid kick. During the push phase, the chest goes up and the hips are at their lowest position. In this style, the second pulse in the cycle is stronger than the first pulse, as the second pulse is more in flow with the <b>body</b> <b>movement.</b>|$|E

These are the inputs of the actual model to generate a continuum of laughs rhythmic <b>body</b> <b>movements.</b> In the paper, we also propose a method to integrate rhyth-mic <b>body</b> <b>movements</b> generated by our model with other synthetized expressive cues of laughter such as facial expres-sions and additional <b>body</b> <b>movements.</b> Finally, we present a real-time human-virtual character interaction scenario where virtual character applies our model to answer to human's laugh in real-time...|$|R

25|$|Balance, equilibrioception, or {{vestibular}} {{sense is}} the sense that allows an organism to sense <b>body</b> <b>movement,</b> direction, and acceleration, and to attain and maintain postural equilibrium and balance.

In technical terms, this organ is responsible for two senses of angular momentum acceleration and linear acceleration (which also senses gravity), but they are known together as equilibrioception.|$|E

40|$|Abstract * This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} analyzing human-robot interaction by <b>body</b> <b>movements.</b> Future intelligent robots will communicate with humans and perform physical and communicative tasks to participate in daily life. A human-like body will provide an abundance of non-verbal information and enable us to smoothly communicate with the robot. To achieve this, we have developed a humanoid robot that autonomously interacts with humans by speaking and making gestures. It {{is used as a}} testbed for studying embodied communication. Our strategy is to analyze human-robot interaction in terms of <b>body</b> <b>movements</b> using a motion capturing system, which allows us to measure the <b>body</b> <b>movements</b> in detail. We have performed experiments to compare the <b>body</b> <b>movements</b> with subjective impressions of the robot. The results reveal the importance of well-coordinated behaviors and suggest a new analytical approach to human-robot interaction. ...|$|R

25|$|Kinesiology is the {{scientific}} study of human or non-human <b>body</b> <b>movement.</b> Kinesiology addresses physiological, biomechanical, and psychological mechanisms of movement. Applications of kinesiology to human health (i.e., human kinesiology) include biomechanics and orthopedics; strength and conditioning; sport psychology; methods of rehabilitation, such as physical and occupational therapy; and sport and exercise. Studies of human and animal motion include measures from motion tracking systems, electrophysiology of muscle and brain activity, various methods for monitoring physiological function, and other behavioral and cognitive research techniques.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to artifacts {{generated by the}} body, many artifacts originate from outside the <b>body.</b> <b>Movement</b> by the patient, or even just settling of the electrodes, may cause electrode pops, spikes originating from a momentary change in the impedance of a given electrode. Poor grounding of the EEG electrodes can cause significant 50 or 60nbsp&Hz artifact, depending on the local power system's frequency. A third source of possible interference can be {{the presence of an}} IV drip; such devices can cause rhythmic, fast, low-voltage bursts, which may be confused for spikes.|$|E
25|$|Action {{video game}} players have better hand-eye {{coordination}} and visuo-motor skills, such as resistance to distraction, sensitivity to {{information in the}} peripheral vision and ability to count briefly presented objects, than non-players. Through {{the development of the}} PlayStation Move, Kinect and Wii, video games can help develop motor skills through full <b>body</b> <b>movement.</b> Experiments have indicated increases in cognition and problem solving skills in professional gamers. A common thought is that video games are for people who are lazy, but in reality they are benefiting children with spatial navigation, reasoning, memory and perception.|$|E
50|$|Children who do {{not have}} Autism learn to relate the <b>body</b> <b>movements</b> that they see with the {{emotions}} and mental states of others when they have face to face interactions with other children.

After seeing these representations being used multiple times, children are then able to make inferences about the representations and the people making them. This means that the children {{will be able to make}} an assumption about a person that they interact with in the future since they already understand what the <b>body</b> <b>movements</b> and or <b>body</b> language represents.|$|R

25|$|Body {{temperature}} {{is not well}} regulated during REM sleep, and thus organisms become more sensitive to temperatures outside their thermoneutral zone. Cats and other small furry mammals will shiver and breathe faster to regulate temperature during NREMS but not during REMS. With the loss of muscle tone, animals lose the ability to regulate temperature through <b>body</b> <b>movement.</b> (However, even cats with pontine lesions preventing muscle atonia during REM did not regulate their temperature by shivering.) Neurons which typically activate in response to cold temperatures—triggers for neural thermoregulation—simply do not fire during REM sleep, {{as they do in}} NREM sleep and waking.|$|E
25|$|The {{peripheral}} {{nervous system}} (PNS) is divided into the somatic nervous system, the autonomic nervous system, and the enteric nervous system. However, it is the somatic nervous system, responsible for <b>body</b> <b>movement</b> and the reception of external stimuli, which allows one to understand how cutaneous innervation is {{made possible by the}} action of specific sensory fibers located on the skin, as well as the distinct pathways they take to the central nervous system. The skin, {{which is part of the}} integumentary system, plays an important role in the somatic nervous system because it contains a range of nerve endings that react to heat and cold, touch, pressure, vibration, and tissue injury.|$|E
