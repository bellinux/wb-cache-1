The internal contamination control and environmental health considerations for the Space Station are discussed. The microbiology, toxicology, water quality, radiological health, vibroacoustics, and barothermal physiology subsystems of the EHS are described. Proposed capabilities of the EHS are: the environmental sample collection, processing, {{and analysis of the}} <b>breathing</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> potable and hygiene water, and internal surfaces...|$|E
40|$|An {{anaesthetic}} circuit or {{system can}} be defined as that part of anaesthetic apparatus which is used to connect the patient to the anaesthetic machine deployed to deliver predetermined volumes and concentration of oxygen, anaesthetic gases and volatile agents. This can easily be achieved by using a length of tubing, supplying the anaesthetic mixture from the machine to the patient. But it is highly desirable to have a proper circuit or system between the patient and the anaesthetic machine due to the following reasons: (a) The patient is to be provided with a desired, balanced and congenial <b>breathing</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> Some anaesthetic circuits may tend to modify the concentration of gases and vapours which are actually delivered to the patient. (b) The re-breathing of exhaled anaesthetic mixture requires to be prevented or minimised. Accumulation of CO 2 due to re-breathing also reduces the inspired concentration of O 2 and anaesthetic mixture in use. (c) The mixing of inspired gases with room air as well as the pollution of theatre atmosphere from expired gases has to be prevented. (d) The resistance to expiration needs to be minimised. N/...|$|E
40|$|Airborne dust, {{suspended}} {{inside a}} space vehicle or in future celestial habitats, can present {{a serious threat}} to crew health if it is not controlled. During the Apollo missions to the moon, lunar dust brought inside the capsule caused eye irritation and breathing difficulty to the crew when they launched from the moon and re-acquired "microgravity. " During Shuttle flights reactive and toxic dusts such as lithium hydroxide have created a risk to crew health, and fine particles from combustion events can be especially worrisome. Under nominal spaceflight conditions, airborne dusts and particles tend to be larger than on earth because of the absence of gravity settling. Aboard the ISS, dusts are effectively managed by HEPA filters, although floating dust in newly-arrived modules can be a nuisance. Future missions to the moon and to Mars will present additional challenges because of the possibility that external dust will enter the <b>breathing</b> <b>atmosphere</b> of the habitat and reach the crew's respiratory system. Testing with simulated lunar and Martian dust has shown that these materials are toxic when placed into the lungs of test animals. Defining and evaluating the physical and chemical properties of Martian dusts through robotic missions will challenge our ability to prepare better dust simulants and to determine the risk to crew health from exposure to such dusts...|$|E

Attention is presently given to the comparative performance levels obtained by silver-oxide-based and silver/zinc-oxide-based systems, which also proved to be longer-lasting than the silver oxide-absorber system.

40|$|Several {{organic and}} {{inorganic}} materials {{have been tested}} for possible incorporation into a sensing array in order to add elemental mercury vapor to the suite of chemical species detected. Materials have included gold films, treated gold films, polymer-carbon composite films, gold-polymer-carbon composite films and palladium chloride sintered films. The toxicity of mercury and its adverse effect on human and animal health has made environmental monitoring of mercury in gas and liquid phases important (1, 2). As consumer products which contain elemental mercury, such as fluorescent lighting, become more widespread, the need to monitor environments {{for the presence of}} vapor phase elemental mercury will increase. Sensors in use today to detect mercury in gaseous streams are generally based on amalgam formation with gold or other metals, including noble metals and aluminum. Recently, NASA has recognized a need to detect elemental mercury vapor in the <b>breathing</b> <b>atmosphere</b> of the crew cabin in spacecraft and has requested that such a capability be incorporated into the JPL Electronic Nose (3). The detection concentration target for this application is 10 parts-per-billion (ppb), or 0. 08 mg/m 3. In order to respond to the request to incorporate mercury sensing into the JPL Electronic Nose (ENose) platform, it was necessary to consider only conductometric methods of sensing, as any other transduction method would have required redesign of the platform. Any mercury detection technique which could not be incorporated into the existing platform, such as an electrochemical technique, could not be considered...|$|E
40|$|Helium {{is one of}} {{inert gases}} causing {{physical}} asphyxiation, whose excess content in the <b>breathing</b> <b>atmosphere</b> reduces the partial pressure of oxygen and may be fatal after short-term exposure. When breathing a mixture of an inert gas (helium, nitrogen, argon) {{with a small amount}} of oxygen, with the possibility of exhaling carbon dioxide, no warning signs characteristic of suffocation are perceived by the subject. Freedom from discomfort and pain, effectiveness, rapid effect and relatively easy availability of required accessories have resulted in the use of inert gases for suicidal purposes. The paper reports two cases of suicide committed by using a special kit consisting of the so-called “suicide bag” (or “exit bag”) filled with helium supplied through a plastic tube. In both cases, examination of the sites where the corpses were found and analysis of collected material allowed to establish that before their death the subjects had searched the Internet for instructions on how to commit suicide using helium. Due to the advanced putrefaction process, the autopsies failed to determine the causes of their death unequivocally. However, the circumstances surrounding the deaths suggested rapid asphyxiation as a result of oxygen deficiency in the breathing mixture. Since in cases of the type discussed here the cause of death cannot generally be established by autopsy, knowledge of the circumstances of disclosure of the corpse, as well as examination of the cadaver and the death scene is of utmost importance...|$|E

40|$|Several {{candidate}} advanced pressure bladder membrane {{materials have}} been developed for NASA Johnson Space Center by DSM Biomedical for selective permeability of carbon dioxide and water vapor. These materials were elasthane and two other formulations of thermoplastic polyether polyurethane. Each material was tested in two thicknesses for permeability to carbon dioxide, oxygen and water vapor. Although oxygen leaks through the suit bladder would amount to only about 60 cc/hr in a full size suit, significant amounts of carbon dioxide would not be rejected by the system to justify its use. While the ratio of carbon dioxide to oxygen permeability is about 48 to 1, this is offset by the small partial pressure of carbon dioxide in acceptable <b>breathing</b> <b>atmospheres</b> of the suit. Humidity management remains a possible use of the membranes depending on {{the degree to which the}} water permeability is inhibited by cations in the sweat. Tests are underway to explore cation fouling from sweat...|$|R

50|$|Although N. glauca {{live in the}} water, they <b>breathe</b> <b>atmosphere</b> air and do {{not have}} gills. When these insects are diving or resting under the water surface, they create a film of air that {{surrounds}} their body. This air film is also known as a superhydrophobic coating or surface, and it prevents the insect from becoming wet. It also reduces the drag (physics) that is created when diving. To be able to create this air film around it, N. glauca is covered in hairy structures, except on its head and legs. There are two types of hairs and air retention is maximized by having both types: setae and microtrichia. The most important part in creating an air film is the density of the hairs. Notonecta glauca has dense microtrichia and their air film can last up to 120 days. The air film cannot last forever because as an insect respires (breathes), the oxygen partial pressure will decrease and nitrogen partial pressure will increase, causing the air bubble to decrease in size.|$|R
