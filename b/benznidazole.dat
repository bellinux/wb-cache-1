50|$|Studies {{in animals}} {{have shown that}} <b>benznidazole</b> can cross the placenta. Due to its {{potential}} for teratogenicity, use of <b>benznidazole</b> in pregnancy is not recommended.|$|E
50|$|<b>Benznidazole</b> {{should not}} be used in people with severe liver and/or kidney disease. Pregnant women should not use <b>benznidazole</b> because it can cross the {{placenta}} and cause teratogenicity.|$|E
50|$|Oral <b>benznidazole</b> has a {{bioavailability}} of 92%, with a {{peak concentration}} time of 3-4 hours after administration. 5% {{of the parent}} drug is excreted unchanged in the urine, which implies that clearance of <b>benznidazole</b> is mainly through metabolism by the liver. Its elimination half-life is 10.5-13.6 hours.|$|E
50|$|<b>Benznidazole</b> {{and other}} nitroimidazoles {{have been shown}} to {{decrease}} the rate of clearance of 5-fluorouracil (including 5-fluorouracil produced from its prodrugs capecitabine, doxifluridine, and tegafur). While co-administration of any of these drugs with <b>benznidazole</b> is not contraindicated, monitoring for 5-fluorouracil toxicity is recommended in the event they are used together.|$|E

50|$|<b>Benznidazole</b> is {{the primary}} {{treatment}} of choice for Chagas disease, is produced in Latin America where the disease originates and is most prevalent, at the public pharma LAFEPE in Brasil. Mundo Sano and the Chemo pharmaceutical group developed a second generic version of <b>benznidazole,</b> which is manufactured by the Argentine company Laboratorio ELEA under the name Abarax. On 20 March 2012, the Argentine Minister of Health, Dr Juan Manzur triumphantly announced the first ever production of benzinidazole in Argentina.|$|E

The most common adverse reactions associated with <b>benznidazole</b> are allergic dermatitis and peripheral neuropathy. It is reported that up to 30% of people will experience dermatitis when starting treatment. <b>Benznidazole</b> may cause photosensitization of the skin, resulting in rashes. Rashes usually appear within the first 2 weeks of treatment and resolve over time. In rare instances, skin hypersensitivity can result in exfoliative skin eruptions, edema, and fever. Peripheral neuropathy may occur {{later on in the}} treatment course and is dose dependent. It is not permanent, but takes time to resolve.|$|E
50|$|<b>Benznidazole</b> {{has proven}} to be {{effective}} in the treatment of reactivated T. cruzi infections caused by immunosuppression, such as in people with AIDS or in those under immunosuppressive therapy related to organ transplants.|$|E
50|$|However, {{some studies}} {{indicate}} treatment with <b>benznidazole</b> during the chronic phase, even if incapable of producing parasitologic cure, because it reduces electrocardiographic changes and a delays worsening {{of the clinical}} condition of the patient.|$|E
50|$|Nifurtimox is a {{medication}} {{used to treat}} Chagas disease and sleeping sickness. For sleeping sickness it is used together with eflornithine. In Chagas disease it is a second line option to <b>benznidazole.</b> It is given by mouth.|$|E

50|$|<b>Benznidazole</b> is an {{antiparasitic}} medication used in {{the treatment}} of Chagas disease. While it is highly effective in early disease this decreases in those who have long term infection. It is the first line treatment given its moderate side effects compared to nifurtimox.

50|$|Trypanosomes are {{parasitic}} protozoa {{that cause}} African trypanosomiasis and Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis). There are no vaccines {{to prevent these}} infections so drugs such as pentamidine and suramin, <b>benznidazole</b> and nifurtimox and used to treat infections. These drugs are effective but infections caused by resistant parasites have been reported.|$|E
5000|$|There is {{also some}} {{indication}} that posaconazole {{may be the most}} effective treatment for both chronic and acute Chagas disease, showing much better efficacy than <b>benznidazole.</b> [...] Schering-Plough is currently recruiting participants for a phase II clinical trial in Argentina to test its efficacy against asymptomatic, chronic Chagas.|$|E
5000|$|This is {{the only}} {{paediatric}} dosage treatment for Chagas disease, launched in 2011 through a collaboration between DNDi and LAFEPE (Laboratório Farmacêutico do Estado de Pernambuco). In November 2013, the Mundo Sano Foundation and DNDi signed a collaboration agreement to deliver a second source of the treatment in partnership with ELEA (producers of Abarax®). The paediatric dosage form of <b>benznidazole</b> is designed for infants and young children under 2 years of age (20 kg body weight) infected congenitally. Thanks to its age-adapted, easy-to-use, affordable, and non-patented tablet, the new treatment contributes to improved dosing accuracy, safety, and adherence to treatment. The paediatric dosage form of <b>benznidazole</b> was granted registration by Brazil`s National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) in 2011, and further endemic countries are targeted for obtaining registration. It was included on the WHO Essential Medicines List for Children in July 2013 ...|$|E
5000|$|A {{study of}} nitroimidazoles found the drug {{extremely}} effective against T. cruzi and T. brucei which cause Chagas disease and African sleeping sickness, respectively. The drug is considerably {{more effective than}} standard <b>benznidazole</b> therapy (for Chagas) which is considered the gold standard. [...] This is despite that other nitroimidazoles proved ineffective against these pathogens.|$|E
50|$|Nifurtimox {{has been}} used to treat Chagas disease, when it is given for 30 to 60 days. However, long term use of Nifurtimox does {{increase}} chances of adverse events like gastrointestinal and neurological side effects. Due to the low tolerance and completion rate of Nifurtimox, <b>benznidazole</b> is now being more considered for those who have Chagas disease and require long term treatment.|$|E

50|$|<b>Benznidazole</b> {{came into}} medical use in 1971. It {{is on the}} World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most {{effective}} and safe medicines needed in a health system.

As of 2012 Laboratório Farmacêutico do Estado de Pernambuco, a government run pharmaceutical company in Brazil was the only producer.|$|E
50|$|<b>Benznidazole</b> is a {{nitroimidazole}} antiparasitic {{with good}} activity against acute infection with Trypanosoma cruzi, {{commonly referred to}} as Chagas disease. Like other nitroimidazoles, benznidazole's main mechanism of action is to generate radical species which can damage the parasite's DNA or cellular machinery. The mechanism by which nitroimidazoles do this seems to depend on whether or not oxygen is present. This is particularly relevant in the case of Trypanosoma species, which are considered facultative anaerobes.|$|E
5000|$|... ==Medical uses== <b>Benznidazole</b> has a {{significant}} activity during the acute phase of Chagas disease, with a therapeutical success rate up to 80%. Its curative capabilities during the chronic phase are, however, limited. Some studies have found parasitologic cure (a complete elimination of T. cruzi from the body) in pediatric and young patients during the early stage of the chronic phase, but overall failure rate in chronically infected individuals is typically above 80%.|$|E
50|$|<b>Benznidazole</b> {{can be used}} in {{children}} and infants, with the same 5-7 mg/kg per day weight-based dosing regimen that is used to treat adult infections. Children are found to be at a lower risk of adverse events compared to adults, possibly due to increased hepatic clearance of the drug. The most prevalent adverse effects {{in children}} were found to be gastrointestinal, dermatologic, and neurologic in nature. However, the incidence of severe dermatologic and neurologic adverse events is lower in the pediatric population compared to adults.|$|E
50|$|From the {{chemistry}} perspective, nitroimidazole antibiotics {{can be classified}} according {{to the location of}} the nitro functional group. 4- and 5-nitroimidazole are equivalent from the perspective of drugs since these tautomers readily interconvert. Drugs of the 5-nitro variety include metronidazole, tinidazole, nimorazole, dimetridazole, 6-Amino PA824, ornidazole, megazol, and azanidazole. Drugs based on 2-nitromidazoles include <b>benznidazole.</b> Nitroimidazole antibiotics have been used to combat anaerobic bacterial and parasitic infections. Perhaps the most common example is metronidazole. Other heterocycles such as nitrothiazoles (thiazole) are also used for this purpose. Nitroheterocycles may be reductively activated in hypoxic cells, and then undergo redox recycling or decompose to toxic products.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{presence}} of oxygen, by contrast, any radical nitro compounds produced will be rapidly oxidized by molecular oxygen, yielding the original nitroimidazole compound and a superoxide anion in {{a process known as}} [...] "futile cycling". In these cases, the generation of superoxide is believed to give rise to other reactive oxygen species. The degree of toxicity or mutagenicity produced by these oxygen radicals depends on cells' ability to detoxify superoxide radicals and other reactive oxygen species. In mammals, these radicals can be converted safely to hydrogen peroxide, meaning <b>benznidazole</b> has very limited direct toxicity to human cells. In Trypanosoma species, however, there is a reduced capacity to detoxify these radicals, which results in damage to the parasite's cellular machinery.|$|E
50|$|Under {{anaerobic}} conditions, the {{nitro group}} of nitroimidazoles {{is believed to}} be reduced by the pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase complex to create a reactive nitro radical species. The nitro radical can then either engage in other redox reactions directly or spontaneously give rise to a nitrite ion and imidazole radical instead. The initial reduction takes place because nitroimidazoles are better electron acceptors for ferredoxin than the natural substrates. In mammals, the principal mediators of electron transport are NAD+/NADH and NADP+/NADPH, which have a more positive reduction potential and so will not reduce nitroimidazoles to the radical form. This limits the spectrum of activity of nitroimidazoles so that host cells and DNA are not also damaged. This mechanism has been well-established for 5-nitroimidazoles such as metronidazole, but it is unclear if the same mechanism can be expanded to 2-nitroimidazoles (including <b>benznidazole).</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Benznidazole</b> is {{recommended}} in Brazil {{for the treatment}} of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in acute and early chronic phases of Chagas' disease. Observations by others have indicated a higher incidence of neoplasias in immunosuppressed patients, presenting Chagas' disease reactivation, submitted to treatment with <b>benznidazole.</b> In the present study, we investigated whether there is a potentiation in the generation of lymphomas in chronically infected mice, treated with immunosuppressive drugs and <b>benznidazole.</b> For this, 142 Swiss mice chronically infected with the 21 SF strain of T. cruzi and 72 normal Swiss mice were used. Both infected and normal mice were divided into experimental groups and submitted to one of the following treatment regimens: <b>benznidazole</b> alone; immunosuppressive drugs (azathioprine, betamethasone and cyclosporin); a combination of immunosuppressive drugs and benznidazole; and untreated controls. In the infected group treated with <b>benznidazole,</b> one mouse developed a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. This finding has been interpreted as a spontaneous tumor of mice. The study of the chronically infected mice treated with the combination of immunosuppressive drugs and <b>benznidazole</b> demonstrated an absence of lymphomas or other neoplasias. These findings support the indication of <b>benznidazole,</b> as the drug of choice, for immunosuppressed patients that develop a reactivation of Chagas' disease...|$|E
40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIObjectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} <b>benznidazole</b> on endothelial activation in a murine model of Chagas disease. Methods: A low (30 mg/kg/day) and a high (100 mg/kg/day) dose of <b>benznidazole</b> were administered to mice infected with Trypanosoma cruzi during the early phases of the infection. The effects of the treatments were assessed at 24 and 90 days postinfection by evaluating the parasitaemia, mortality, histopathological changes and expression of ICAM in the cardiac tissue. The blood levels of thromboxane A 2, soluble ICAM and E-selectin were also measured. T. cruzi clearance was assessed by the detection of parasite DNA in the heart tissue of infected mice. Results: <b>Benznidazole</b> decreased the cardiac damage induced by the parasite, and amastigote nests disappeared at 90 days postinfection. Both doses cleared the parasite from the cardiac tissue at 24 and 90 days postinfection. In addition, <b>benznidazole</b> decreased the thromboxane levels and normalized the plasma sICAM and sE-selectin levels by 90 days postinfection. Conclusions: Early administration of <b>benznidazole</b> at a dose as low as 30 mg/kg eradicates T. cruzi from cardiac tissue. Additionally, <b>benznidazole</b> prevents cardiac damage and modulates endothelial activation {{as part of its}} antichagasic activity...|$|E
