25|$|During {{the first}} half of the 1820s, there were slight gradual {{modifications}} of Regency styles, with the position of the waistline trending successively lower than the high waistline of the Regency (just below the breasts), and also further development of the trends of the late 1810s towards giving skirts a somewhat conical silhouette (as opposed to earlier more clinging and free-flowing styles), and in having various types of decoration (sometimes large and ornate) applied horizontally around the dress near the hem. Sleeves also began increasing in size, foreshadowing the styles of the 1830s. However, there was still no radical break with the Empire/Regency aesthetic. Skirts became even wider at the bottom during the 1820s, with more ornamentation and definition toward the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skirt</b> such as tucks, pleats, ruffles, or loops of silk or fur.|$|E
25|$|The {{previous}} decade saw Spanish breeches as {{the most}} popular. These were stiff breeches which fell above or just below the knee and were rather moderately fitted. By the mid-1650s, in Western Europe, much looser, uncollected breeches, called petticoat breeches became the most popular. As the 1650s progressed, they became larger and looser, very much giving {{the impression of a}} lady's petticoat. They were usually decorated with many yards of ribbon around the waist and around the ungathered knee {{on the outside of the}} leg. Alongside the petticoat breeches, a collected but still loose fitted breeches called rhinegraves, were also worn. By the early 1660s, their popularity surpassed petticoat breeches. They were usually worn with an overskirt over them. The overskirt was heavily decorated with ribbon on the waist and the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skirt.</b> Its length was usually just above the knee, but could also extend past the knee so that the rhinegraves underneath could not be seen and only the bottom of the stocking-tops was visible.|$|E

60|$|You may be {{sure that}} I got out of my things as soon as I could borrow an Altrurian costume, and now my Paris {{confections}} are already hung up for monuments, as Richard III. says, in the Capitalistic Museum, where people from the outlying Regions may come and study them as object-lessons in what not to wear. (You remember what you said Aristides told you, when he spoke that day at the mountains, about the Regions that Altruria is divided into? This is the Maritime Region, and the city where we are living for the present is the capital.) You may think this was rather hard on me, and at first it did seem pretty intimate, having my things in a long glass case, and {{it gave me a}} shock to see them, {{as if it had been}} my ghost, whenever I passed them. But the fact is I was more ashamed than hurt--they were so ugly and stupid and useless. I could have borne my Paris dress and my picture-hat if it had not been for those ridiculous high-heeled, pointed-toe shoes, which the Curatress had stood at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skirts.</b> They looked <b>the</b> most frantic things you can imagine, and <b>the</b> mere sight <b>of</b> them made my poor feet ache in the beautiful sandals I am wearing now; when once you have put on sandals you say good-bye and good-riddance to shoes. In a single month my feet have grown almost a tenth as large again as they were, and my friends here encourage me to believe that they will yet measure nearly the classic size, though, as you know, I am not in my first youth and can't expect them to do miracles.|$|R

If the mask has a purge valve and the strap tension is correct, the diver holds the head so that the valve is at the lowest point and exhales through the nose. If the mask is a good fit on the diver's face and the strap is correctly placed, exhaling through the nose will usually drive water out along <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skirt.</b> It {{may be necessary to}} press <b>the</b> upper part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mask against the face to improve the seal if the diver is rolled to one side.

50|$|It was noticed {{early on}} that the energy needed to lift a {{hovercraft}} was {{directly related to the}} smoothness of the surface it traveled on. This was not surprising; the air trapped under the hovercraft's skirt will remain there except where it leaks out around the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skirt</b> where it contacts the ground - if this interface is smooth, the amount of leaked air will be low. What was surprising was that the amount of energy lost through this process could be lower than steel wheeled vehicles, at least at high speeds.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{roughly the}} 1960s, Ngöbe women have worn full-length, short-sleeve dresses called naguas. They extend {{from the neck}} to the ankles. It is widely {{believed}} that the dresses were introduced by Catholic missionaries for modesty's sake, as the Ngäbe traditionally wore loincloths and little else. The dresses are usually adorned with geometric patterns at the sleeve and neck lines, the waist, and at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skirt.</b> The classic Ngäbe geometric pattern is called dientes, or [...] "teeth", and is said to represent mountains, animal teeth, the ripples of the river, or dragon scales.|$|E

40|$|Pressure vessel towers {{used in the}} {{petrochemical}} {{and chemical}} industry are designed to accommodate numbers of internals including trays and beds resulting in tall vertical structures. Transportation of tall towers from the fabrication shop to the construction site presents challenges that can result in high transportation costs or a logistically impossible task <b>of</b> moving <b>the</b> vessel. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solutions to this problem is to shorten the tower for transport by cutting part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tower <b>skirt</b> and welding it in the field. Depending on the location, welding on site can be expensive, labour intensive and may cause problems in <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weld and the tower being out of level. Using a flanged skirt connection will reduce the field labour spent on connecting <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skirt</b> to <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vessel. The challenge that lies in front of designers is that the current codes and available literature do not give a specific design and calculation guidance for implementing such a solution. This paper looks at different analytical methods {{to be used for}} <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> a <b>skirt</b> splice. Methods provided by Jawad and Farr, <b>the</b> Canadian Institute <b>of</b> Steel Construction, <b>the</b> American Institute <b>of</b> Steel Construction, and the Peterson Method from the European Commission’s High-Strength Tower in Steel for Wind Turbines (HISTWIN) are analyzed. Based on this analysis, the most optimal and safe design and fabrication methodology for implementing a Flanged Skirt Connection is proposed...|$|R
5000|$|As {{with all}} GM {{full-size}} lines, the DeVille was redesigned for 1971. The new GM full-size bodies, at 64.3 inches front shoulder room (62.1 inches on Cadillac) and 63.4 inches rear shoulder room (64.0 inches on Cadillac) {{set a record}} for interior width {{that would not be}} matched by any car until the full-size GM rear-wheel-drive models <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early to mid-1990s. Pairs of individually housed squarish headlamps were set wider apart. The V-shaped grille had an eggcrate style insert and was protected by massive vertical guards framing a rectangular license plate indentation. A wide hood with full-length windsplints, a prominent center crease and hidden windshield wipers was seen. A Cadillac crest decorated the nose and new indicator lamps appeared atop each front fender. A horizontal beltline molding ran from behind the front wheel housing, almost to the rear stopping where an elliptical bulge in the body came to a point and where thin rectangular side markers were placed above and below the chrome strip. The rear wheel openings were again housed in fender skirts. Tail lamps were <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same type as before but were no longer divided by a chrome bar. Long horizontal back-up lamps were set in the bumper, on either side of a deeply recessed license plate housing. DeVilles were set apart visually by thin bright metal rocker panel steps and signature script on the front fenders bearing the series name. <b>The</b> <b>bottoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rear fenders were decorated with a bright metal beauty panel that was wider than the rocker panel strips and blended into the molding running along <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fender <b>skirt.</b> <b>The</b> standard engine remained the 472, still rated at 375 SAE gross horsepower and [...] of torque.|$|R
5000|$|To {{tone down}} the rough and {{somewhat}} masculine look of the denim fabric, denim skirts are sometimes designed with alternating cloth panels, which can be diagonal, triangular, vertical, or there can be cloth panel trim at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skirt.</b> Also, to make the skirt look more feminine, denim skirts are (more often than skirts made from other fabrics), trimmed with fringes, lace, leather fringes, or decorated with embroidery, patchwork, rhinestones, writing, or even painting. Prints are quite rare on denim skirts. Deviating from the front fly and button closure is common though, with back or side zippers or a column of front buttons (on a [...] "fake" [...] fly) being common.|$|E
50|$|The Shopi {{have a very}} {{original}} and characteristic folklore. The traditional male costume of the Shopi is white, while the female costumes are diverse. White male costumes are spread at the western Shopluk. The hats they wear are also white and tall (called gugla). Traditionally Shopi costume from the Kyustendil region are in black and they are called Chernodreshkovci — Blackcoats. Some Shope women wear {{a special kind of}} sukman called a litak, which is black, generally is worn without an apron, and is heavily decorated around the neck and <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skirt</b> in gold, often with great quantities of gold-colored sequins.

2500|$|After {{considerable}} experimentation, Denys Bliss at Hovercraft Development Ltd. {{found the}} solution to this problem. Instead of using two separate rubber sheets to form <b>the</b> <b>skirt,</b> a single sheet of rubber was bent into a U shape to provide both sides, with slots cut into <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U forming the annular vent. When deforming pressure was applied to <b>the</b> outside <b>of</b> this design, air pressure in <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skirt</b> forced <b>the</b> inner wall to move in as well, keeping the channel open. Although there was some deformation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> curtain, the airflow within <b>the</b> <b>skirt</b> was maintained and the lift remained relatively steady. Over time, this design evolved into individual extensions over <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slots in <b>the</b> <b>skirt,</b> known as [...] "fingers".|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> a single {{cylinder}} high-speed spark ignition linear engine with a spring system return cycle. <b>The</b> main objective <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{research is to}} design and analyse a free piston linear engine that is easy to start, easy to maintain and easy to control. <b>The</b> unique design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spring as a return cycle in a free piston linear engine is presented {{and its effects on}} engine performance and motion are discussed. The engine performance has been predicted the aim is to design a linear engine particularly for the spring system. The spring design has been optimised by using a multilevel optimization approach. Based on <b>the</b> optimisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spring design, the linear engine geometry design has been conducted. <b>The</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> linear engine design has been measured and the results compared with the predicted performance. Besides which <b>the</b> motion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> linear engine has been studied; however, friction affect show <b>the</b> rotated <b>of</b> <b>the</b> piston. It is necessary to modify the spring mechanism to ensure that the scavenging process works properly. Two scenarios such as <b>the</b> removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> piston <b>skirt</b> and adding a lock to the connecting rod are recommended, based of structural stress and thermal-structural stress analysis. Software has been used in the research to analyse <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> free piston linear engine with a spring system, including GT-Power, SolidWorks, Matlab, Algor, and Spread-Sheet. The model has been built using GT-Power to predict the engine performance. To validate the model, it has been assessed with the original engine manual and experimentally. Three step multilevel optimisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spring geometry has been carried out by using Matlab and Spread-Sheet. SolidWorks has been used to design all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> components and for <b>the</b> assembly <b>of</b> <b>the</b> linear engine. Cosmos motion, which is a part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SolidWorks facility, has been used to analyse <b>the</b> piston dynamics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> linear engine. Once again, GT-Power has been used to analyse <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spring design on the linear engine performance. For <b>the</b> modification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spring system, Algor has been used to analyse <b>the</b> thermal-structural stress <b>of</b> <b>the</b> piston and the connecting rod. Through step by step considerations started from building model to predict <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> linear engine, to optimize the spring geometry design then continued build the free piston linear engine with spring system including design, analyses and modified. The result is a design which predicts the performance and <b>the</b> dynamics <b>of</b> piston motion. Only 50 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 12 speeds sampled worked correctly. <b>The</b> rotation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> piston on the Z-ordinate can be fixed through modification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> piston or connecting rod. A design of a single cylinder high-speed spark ignition linear engine with spring system as return cycle has been carried out.

5000|$|Florence Pomeroy, Lady Haberton, was {{president}} of the Rational Dress movement in Britain. At a National Health Society exhibition held in 1882, Viscountess Haliburton presented her invention of a [...] "divided skirt", which was a long skirt that cleared the ground, with separate halves at the bottom made with material attached to the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skirt.</b> She hoped that her invention would become popular by supporting women's freedom of physical movement, but the British public was not impressed by the invention, perhaps because of the negative [...] "unwomanly" [...] association of the style with the American Bloomers movement. Amelia Jenks Bloomer had encouraged the wearing of visible bloomers by feminists to assert their right to wear comfortable and practical clothing, but it {{was no more than a}} passing fashion itself among radical feminists. The movement to reform women's dress would persist and have longterm success, however; by the 1920s, Coco Chanel was enormously successful at selling a progressive, far less restrictive silhouette that abandoned the corset and raised hemlines. The new silhouette symbolised modernism for trendy young women and became the 20th century standard. Other Paris designers continued reintroducing pants for women and the trend was gradually adopted over the next century.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most unusual}} Chaparral was the 2J. On the chassis' sides bottom edges were {{articulated}} plastic skirts that sealed {{against the ground}} (a technology that would later appear in Formula One). At {{the rear of the}} 2J were housed two fans (sourced from a military tank engine) driven by a single two stroke twin cylinder engine. The car had a [...] "skirt" [...] made of Lexan extending to the ground on both sides, laterally {{on the back of the}} car, and laterally from just aft of the front wheels. It was integrated with the suspension system so the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skirt</b> would maintain a distance of one inch from the ground regardless of G forces or anomalies in the road surface, thereby providing a zone within which the fans could create a partial vacuum which would provide a downforceon the order of 1.25-1.50 G of the car fully loaded (fuel, oil, coolant). This gave the car tremendous gripping power and enabled greater maneuverability at all speeds. Since it created the same levels of low pressure under the car at all speeds, down-force did not decrease at lower speeds. With other aerodynamic devices, down-force decreases as the car slows down or achieves too much of a slip angle, both of which were not problems for the [...] "sucker car".|$|E
5000|$|Usually sleeveless, {{and having}} a simple style design. It is {{normally}} waist length, ending at <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skirt.</b> Typically worn alone with a bra underneath. This style top is worn by most American school squads as it is very modest and meets most dress codes, with midriff exposure limited to bare lower backs and an inch of frontal skin while the arms are raised. The sleeveless shell, if worn alone, will normally leave the arms and shoulders open. A properly fitted shell top is essential in making the uniform look flattering for everyone on the cheer squad. A shell that is properly sized and fitted will leave enough room around the arm openings for movement, eliminating fabric rubbing against the underarms. Additionally, if the shell is sized with the correct measurements, <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hem should be long enough to meet <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skirt</b> while standing stationary. These tops can be highly customized from very ordinary to highly detailed designs. Certain cut-outs in sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> garment are an option, as are varying hemlines for <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> top. For instance, instead of a straight hem along <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> top, some squads will choose a [...] "cut-up V" [...] hem, which leaves an upside down [...] "V" [...] notch open along the front, leaving slight midriff exposed at the belly button area. This style is selected to allow for an additional color stripe along <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> hem <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shell.|$|R
50|$|During {{the seventeenth}} and eighteenth centuries <b>the</b> {{fullness}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skirt</b> was concentrated around the hips, thus forming a silhouette similar to Western bustles. <b>The</b> fullness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skirt</b> reached its extreme around 1800.

A scaling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skirt</b> length is suggested by an analysis of published data, which also leads to a scaling for <b>the</b> volume <b>of</b> liquid in <b>the</b> <b>skirt.</b> <b>The</b> theoretical predictions are compared with the few experimental results for which sufficiently detailed information is available...|$|R
