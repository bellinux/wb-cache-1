25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s Gerngross {{became one of}} the first vocal critics of <b>biobased</b> processes. By using life cycle {{assessment}} tools he demonstrated the shortcomings of bioplastics and similar biomass based technologies intended as a substitute for the petrochemical processes used today. His main findings showed that changing from petrochemical to biomass-based processes often worsens their environmental impact and increases the emissions of carbon dioxide when compared to conventional processes based on fossil fuel stocks. With the recent mandate to increase biofuel content in the United States this area of research has become increasingly important, but to date has failed to guide public policy in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2012, {{a fire at}} the Evonik Industries {{plant in}} Marl, Germany, stopped {{production}} for an expected duration of several months. The plant produced a substantial proportion of the world's production of CDT, particularly that needed to produce laurolactam, a precursor to the polyamide PA12. This in turn led to concerns for global production of finished goods, particularly in the automotive industry. [...] Other <b>biobased</b> polyamides, not dependent on laurolactam or CDT, have been put forward as alternative materials.|$|E

In Section 941 of Subtitle D, the Secretaries of Agriculture and of Energy are {{instructed}} to direct {{research and development}} toward three areas related to biofuels.

Second, developing technologies for converting cellulosic biomass into intermediates that can subsequently be converted into <b>biobased</b> fuels and <b>biobased</b> products. Third, product diversification through technologies relevant to production of a range of <b>biobased</b> products (including chemicals, animal feeds, and cogenerated power) that eventually can increase the feasibility of fuel production in a biorefinery.
