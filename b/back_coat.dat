25|$|Fox species {{differ in}} fur color, length, and density. Coat colors range from pearly white to {{black and white}} to black flecked with white or grey on the underside. Fennec foxes (and other species of fox adapted {{to life in the}} desert, such as kit foxes), for example, have large ears and short fur to aid in keeping the body cool. Arctic foxes, on the other hand, have tiny ears and short limbs as well as thick, {{insulating}} fur, which aid in keeping the body warm. Red foxes, by contrast, have a typical auburn pelt, the tail normally ending with white marking. A fox's coat color and texture may vary due to the change in seasons; fox pelts are richer and denser in the colder months and lighter in the warmer months. To get rid of the dense winter coat, foxes moult once a year around April; the process begins from the feet, up the legs, and then along the <b>back.</b> <b>Coat</b> color may also change as the individual ages.|$|E
500|$|The pelage (fur) is {{so dense}} {{that it can}} clog {{electric}} clippers. The ventral (chest) coat and throat are white or cream. The dorsal (<b>back)</b> <b>coat</b> varies from gray to rosy-brown, sometimes with a brown pygal patch around the tail region, where the fur grades to pale gray or grayish brown. The dorsal coloration is slightly darker around the neck and crown. The hair on the throat, cheeks, and ears is white or off-white and also less dense, allowing the dark skin underneath to show through. The muzzle is dark grayish and the nose is black, and the eyes are encompassed by black triangular patches. [...] Facial vibrissae (whiskers) are developed and found above the lips (mystacal), on the cheeks (genal), and on the eyebrow (superciliary). [...] Vibrissae are also found slightly above the wrist {{on the underside of}} the forearm.

5000|$|Schnauzers have {{distinctive}} beards and long, feathery eyebrows. They {{are generally}} either a {{salt and pepper}} color, black, or white, {{but they can be}} brown also. Some owners shave their Schnauzers down the back while the hairs on their legs are kept long and curly, but this changes the coat colour, so show schnauzers especially will have their <b>back</b> <b>coat</b> [...] "stripped" [...] by hand, to encourage the salt and pepper pattern to emerge. It was traditional to have the tails docked and the ears cropped to give an alert appearance. It was common to crop the ears and dock the tails on working dogs. As these are ratters, these procedures don't give the rat anything to grab on to when being attacked and therefore cannot fight back. Cropping and docking are now illegal in the European Union, Australia and New Zealand, and are becoming less common elsewhere. The schnauzer's beard and leg hair should be brushed often to prevent mats from forming.|$|E

40|$|Thermal {{printing}} is a {{rapid and}} inexpensive printing technology {{widely used in}} commercial applications such as point-of-sale receipts, luggage tags, faxes, and labels (Mendum, Stoler et al. 2011). Direct thermal printing produces an image when specific chemicals within the coating of thermal paper are heated. 5 Thermal printing technology was first developed in the late 1960 s, and its popularity grew in the 1980 s and 1990 s as it became more cost effective and versatile. This chapter describes {{the components of the}} thermal paper system, its associated equipment, process, and applications, as well as the alternative chemicals analyzed and considered in the alternatives assessment. 3. 1 Components of Thermal Paper Thermal paper is a highly engineered product that is coated with a thermal sensitive layer that reacts in the presence of heat to create the printed image. The following sections describe the key components of thermal paper development, including chemistry and manufacture. This information was useful in evaluating potential alternatives in this application. 3. 1. 1 Paper Thermal paper is a standard paper grade that has been coated with a thermal sensitive layer, also known as a thermal reactive layer (see Figure 3 - 1). A pre-coat, or base coat, is applied to the base paper and allows for high resolution by preventing the heat transfer through all of the paper‟s layers, and for smoothness. Applied to the pre-coat is a thermal layer that contains the necessary reactive components (see Section 3. 1. 2). Additionally, thermal paper may contain a protective top coat and/or <b>back</b> <b>coat.</b> Top coats may be used for some applications to protect thermal paper from mechanical stress or chemical reactions. Similarly, back coats may be used to provide additional protection during lamination, printing, or other mechanical processes (Koehler Thermal Papers n. d.). Thermal paper used for receipts typically lack the top and back coats...|$|E

40|$|The {{contrast}} {{visible in}} a coated relief specimen viewed by {{transmission electron microscopy}} is generated by the angular difference between the direction of contrast coat evaporation and the direction from which the relief is viewed. This contrast can often be exploited for the computer reconstruction of specimen relief from optical density data if the contrast angle is known. If an additional <b>backing</b> <b>coat</b> is present, the relief must be viewed along the direction of <b>backing</b> <b>coat</b> evaporation, and may therefore require reorientation {{by the use of}} a rotate/tilt holder. Despite attainment of correct orientation, undercutting  multiple intersections of imaging electrons with different regions of contrast coat  may yet prevent valid reconstruction. Although the danger of experiencing undercutting is high, "vertical" coating, in conjunction with minimal tilting, could be used when maximum relief information is required from a unique specimen. Bidirectional contrasting may also be useful for increasing the information capacity of relief coats...|$|R
