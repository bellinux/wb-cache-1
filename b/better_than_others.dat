5|$|Tests {{have shown}} that all divers are {{affected}} by nitrogen narcosis, though some experience lesser effects than others. Even though {{it is possible that}} some divers can manage <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>others</b> because of learning to cope with the subjective impairment, the underlying behavioral effects remain. These effects are particularly dangerous because a diver may feel they are not experiencing narcosis, yet still be affected by it.|$|E
5|$|Later studies {{investigated}} {{aspects of}} the effect. Koole, Dijksterhuis, and van Knippenberg sought to explore how automatic the preference process was. They did this with both numbers and letters. They divided participants into two groups. The first group was asked to give quick, intuitive reactions stating preferences for the stimuli. The second group was asked to reason why they liked some numbers <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>others</b> and to analyse which features of the numbers they liked. As the researchers had predicted, they found that both the birthday-number effect and name-letter effect disappeared in the ‘thinking’ condition. They argued that thinking about reasons instigates deliberative overriding of implicit self-esteem effects. This conclusion was supported by looking at correlations between the effects: whereas in the feeling condition {{the strength of a}} participant's birthday-number effect was correlated to his or her name-letter effect, no such correlation was found in the thinking condition.|$|E

25|$|Priests and {{candidates}} for the priesthood often live at a level both materially and educationally superior to that of their families {{and the members of}} their own age group. It is therefore very easy for them to succumb to the temptation of thinking of themselves as <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>others.</b> When this happens, the ideal of priestly service and self-giving dedication can fade, leaving the priest dissatisfied and disheartened.|$|E

When maintained according to manufacturers' recommendations, well-designed waterless urinals do not emit any more odors than flushed urinals do. However, some odor-trapping devices work <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>others</b> in the longer term. Regular, thorough maintenance of the respective odor control device is needed for all types of waterless urinals, as per the manufacturer's recommendation.|$|E

Everyone owned property, but some pieces of land were <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>others.</b> Eventually, Brigham Young ordered the community to diminish the financial gap that set them apart from the other communities.|$|E

25|$|The load that {{a driver}} {{presents}} to an amplifier {{consists of a}} complex electrical impedance—a combination of resistance and both capacitive and inductive reactance, which combines properties of the driver, its mechanical motion, the effects of crossover components (if any are in the signal path between amplifier and driver), {{and the effects of}} air loading on the driver as modified by the enclosure and its environment. Most amplifiers' output specifications are given at a specific power into an ideal resistive load; however, a loudspeaker does not have a constant impedance across its frequency range. Instead, the voice coil is inductive, the driver has mechanical resonances, the enclosure changes the driver's electrical and mechanical characteristics, and a passive crossover between the drivers and the amplifier contributes its own variations. The result is a load impedance that varies widely with frequency, and usually a varying phase relationship between voltage and current as well, also changing with frequency. Some amplifiers can cope with the variation <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>others</b> can.|$|E
25|$|Despite this new-found freedom, however, {{it meant}} that the {{numerous}} economical benefits and patronage, which {{was a part of}} the traditional clan system, were abolished along with it. Because of this the numerous menkyo holders of SMR who had depended on the old system for financial support had no choice but to adapt themselves to this new Japan. Many of them left the traditional clan holdings, where their ancestors had lived for centuries, and made new lives and livelihoods for themselves. The final abolishment of the warrior-caste and the feudal-system also led to a rapid modernisation of Japan. During this era many of the old bushi (Samurai warriors of all ranks) had no choice but to abandon the old (and considered by most of the Japanese population of the time to be all but obsolete) martial arts altogether. Throughout Japan most of the surviving traditions were kept alive, if only barely, by the former samurai and other enthusiastic individuals, the former which now had to find a new place (and a new source of income) in the new Japan which frowned upon the old samurai way. Some of the old ryū, who were not as dependent on old samurai government sponsorship as others, fared <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>others</b> in the transition from samurai to the Western-style government.|$|E

[...] His main complaint was that there was little creativity in the remixes. Both reviewers were pleased with the piano remix of [...] "Exhausted", and both criticized its exclusivity to the special bundle.|$|E

500|$|Hubbard {{also taught}} that, upon {{the deaths of}} humans, thetans {{continued}} to [...] "implant stations", including locations on planets near Earth, where their memories were erased and new memories emplaced. On grounds that some [...] "implant stations" [...] were <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>others,</b> Hubbard advised his followers to avoid the one on Venus. After passing an implant station, he taught, the thetan returned to Earth, where it was incarnated. Hubbard taught the Christian concept of heaven {{was based on a}} physical location on another planet, which he claimed to have visited. He compared its appearance to Busch Gardens in Pasadena, California, and noted it contained effigies of characters from the New Testament. Over time, he recalled, the location fell into disrepair. A town nearby contained an implant station, at which thetans were convinced to return there.|$|E
500|$|Although the F-4C was {{essentially}} {{identical to the}} Navy/Marine Corps F-4B in flight performance and carried the AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles, USAF-tailored F-4Ds initially arrived in June 1967 equipped with AIM-4 Falcons. However, the Falcon, like its predecessors, was designed to shoot down heavy bombers flying straight and level. Its reliability proved no <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>others</b> and its complex firing sequence and limited seeker-head cooling time made it virtually useless in combat against agile fighters. The F-4Ds reverted to using Sidewinders under the [...] "Rivet Haste" [...] program in early 1968, and by 1972 the AIM-7E-2 [...] "Dogfight Sparrow" [...] had become the preferred missile for USAF pilots. Like other Vietnam War Phantoms, the F-4Ds were urgently fitted with radar homing and warning (RHAW) antennas to detect the Soviet-built S-75 Dvina SAMs.|$|E
