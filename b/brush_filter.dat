40|$|Abstract. It is {{important}} to improve the teaching and tutoring materials available in undergraduate CG education. Exposure to such material will certainly help encourage CG research. However, new image generation algorithms proposed in recent research are not usually included in tutoring material at the undergraduate level. We, the authors, have developed teaching material designed for educating undergraduates in CG. This paper describes teaching materials that support the study of NPR, or “non-photorealistic processing”, a painting-style image processing technique used in CG education. Our {{goal is to make}} a tutoring system for studying NPR through Java programming. First, we will introduce “Jimmy”, an educational Java software program for NPR. Jimmy supports a new <b>brush</b> and <b>filtering</b> functions for painting-style images. Second, we introduce a “CG Experiment Course Syllabus ” for using the proposed system, and we describe the outcomes of its exercises. Students can develop new <b>brush,</b> <b>filtering,</b> and drawing techniques for painting-style images by extending and modifying the algorithms. Through using our system we found the following results...|$|R

50|$|Filter feeding {{crustaceans}} have setae on modified appendages {{that act}} as filters. Filter feeding may have developed in association with swimming, with early morphological adaptions occurring on the appendages of the body trunk. Subsequent adaptions appear to have favoured forward filtering appendages. Filtering appendages generate water currents that bring food items into reach for collection by setae. Other setae {{may be used to}} <b>brush</b> the <b>filtering</b> setae clean, and yet other setae may transport food items to the mouth.|$|R

40|$|Researchers {{and analysts}} in modern {{industrial}} and academic environments {{are faced with}} a daunting amount of multi-dimensional data. While there has been significant development in the areas of data mining and knowledge discovery, there is still the need for improved visualizations and generic solutions. The state-of-the-art in visual analytics and exploratory data visualization is to incorporate more profound analysis methods while focusing on fast interactive abilities. The common trend in these scenarios is to either visualize an abstraction of the data set or to better utilize screen-space. This paper presents a novel technique that combines clustering, dimension reduction and multi-dimensional data representation to form a multivariate data visualization that incorporates both detail and overview. This amalgamation counters the individual drawbacks of common projection and multi-dimensional data visualization techniques, namely ambiguity and clutter. A specific clustering criterion is used to decompose a multi-dimensional data set into a hierarchical tree structure. This decomposition is embedded in a novel Dimensional Anchor visualization {{through the use of a}} weighted linear dimension reduction technique. The resulting Structural Decomposition Tree (SDT) provides not only an insight of the data set’s inherent structure, but also conveys detailed coordinate value information. Further, fast and intuitive interaction techniques are explored in order to guide the user in highlighting, <b>brushing,</b> and <b>filtering</b> of the data...|$|R

For alkaline papers, either Whatman qualitative filter paper No. 3 was immersed in calcium hydroxide solution (pH c. 13) for 15  min and air dried, or commercially-obtained buffered acid-free tissue paper was used. For experiments involving unlaked carmine and tin-laked carmine only the tissue paper was used.

40|$|Parallel {{coordinates}} is {{a widely}} used visualization technique for presenting, analyzing and exploring multi-dimensional data. However, like many other visualizations, it can suffer from an overplotting problem when ren-dering large data sets. Until now, quite a few methods are proposed to discover and illustrate the major data trends in cluttered parallel coordinates. Among them, frequency-based approaches using binning and histograms are widely adopted. The traditional binning method, which records line-segment frequency, only considers data in a two-dimensional subspace, as a result, the multi-dimensional features are not taken into account for trend and outlier analysis. Obtaining a coherent binned representation in higher dimensions is challenging because multidimensional binning can suffer from the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we utilize the Markov Chain model to compute an n-dimensional joint probability for each data tuple based on a two-dimensional binning method. This probability value can be utilized to guide the user for selection and brushing. We provide various interaction techniques for the user to control the parameters during the <b>brushing</b> process. <b>Filtered</b> data with a high probability measure often explicitly illustrates major data trends. In order to scale to large data sets, we also propose a more precise angular representation for angular histograms to depict {{the density of the}} brushed data trends. We demonstrate our methods and evaluate the results {{on a wide variety of}} data sets, including real-world, high-dimensional biological data.

40|$|Maps {{are used}} for centuries to {{visualize}} geographical or topological information and nowadays, with modern technology, we can create interactive maps {{that allow us to}} display and access additional information. Some of them have even become part of our daily life, such as, almost real-time traffic information. Furthermore, maps are often used to display data of population densities, temperatures and spatial distribution of geographical phenomenon. Fraunhofer Institute of Solar Energy ISE decided to build an interactive map that shows the locations of all power plants listed on the European Energy Exchange (EEX). Since July 2014, the Fraunhofer ISE has been providing interactive charts on electricity production and other related information about electricity and power generation in Germany. These charts became very popular and widely used by people from different professions, namely scientists, politicians, journalists as well as online/printed media. Due to the high popularity of these interactive energy charts, an interactive map has been added to the Energy Charts data visualization portal to make the framework more informative and interesting for users. The map has several search options and levels of detail for searching different power plant locations, technical data, and connectivity to the high voltage transmission lines. Furthermore, this new visualization framework is interconnected with the existing energy charts. The dynamic linking, <b>brushing</b> and <b>filtering</b> technique in both map and energy charts have enhanced the framework by an additional layer providing more visibility and information on the selected power plants...|$|R
50|$|In 2011, a more-expensive {{enhanced}} {{version was}} developed under contract for German appliance maker Vorwerk Kobold, distributed only in Germany as the Vorwerk VR-100, with some slow expansion later into other European locations. This model appears {{very similar to}} Neato vacuums and shares many parts, but had an additional spinning side brush extending beyond the case edge, for areas not normally reached, and a more powerful suction fan. The bristle front <b>brush</b> and pleated <b>filter</b> were introduced first on these German models and later in 2012 for Neato models. The Vorwerk unit was also powered by a higher capacity lithium-ion battery, long used in laptop computers, compared to the cheaper nickel-metal hydride battery (NiMh) battery used in Neato models. Differences in details of the charging process for these different types of batteries, {{as well as the}} additional side brush motor, requires different firmware programs for each model's computer. Updates to these programs are delivered separately by each company in case of revisions.|$|R

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. November 2014. Major: Computer Science. Advisor: Daniel F Keefe. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); x, 130 pages. The visual {{system is the}} highest-bandwidth pathway into the human brain, and visualization takes advantage of this pathway to allow users to understand datasets they are interested in. Recent scientific advances {{have led to the}} collection of larger and more complicated datasets, leading to new challenges in effectively visualizing these data. The focus of this dissertation is on addressing these challenges and enabling the next generation of visualization systems. We address these challenges through two complementary research thrusts: "Advanced Visualization Practice" and "Visualization Design Tools. "In our Advanced Visualization Practice thrust, we take steps to extend the process of interactive visualization to work effectively with complicated multivariate motion datasets. We present <b>brushing</b> and <b>filtering</b> operations that allow users to perform complicated filtering operations in a linked-window visualization while maintaining context in complementary views, including two-dimensional plots, three-dimensional plots, and recorded video. We also present the concept of "trends," or patterns of motions that behave similarly over a period of time, and introduce visualization elements to allow users to examine, interact with, and navigate these trends. These contributions help to implement Shneiderman's information seeking mantra (Overview first, zoom and filter, then details-on-demand) in the context of collections of motion datasets. During our work in Advanced Visualization Practice, we realized that there were a lack of tools enabling visualization developers to rapidly and controllably create and evaluate these visualizations. We address this deficiency by our Visualization Design Tools thrust, introducing the idea of visualization creation interfaces where users draw directly on top of data in order to effect their desired changes to the current visualization. In an application of this idea to streamline visualizations, we present a sketch-based streamline visualization creation interface, allowing users to create accurate streamline visualizations by simply drawing the lines they want to appear. An underlying algorithm constrains the input to be accurate while still matching the user's intent. In a second application of this idea, we present a Photoshop-style interface, enabling users to create complicated multivariate visualizations without needing to program. A colormap painting and dabbing algorithm allows users to create complicated colormaps by drawing colors on top of a colormap; an algorithm determines the desired locality of the user's input and updates the colormap accordingly. These interfaces show the potential for future interfaces in this direction to expand the visualization design process to include users currently excluded, such as domain scientists and artists. Through these two complementary thrusts, we help to solve problems preventing newer datasets from being fully exploited. Our contributions in Advanced Visualization Practice solve problems that are impeding the visualization of motion datasets. Our contributions in Visualization Design Tools provide a blueprint for the creation of visualization interfaces that can enable all users instead of just programmers to contribute directly to the visualization design and creation process. Together, these set the stage for future visualization interfaces to better solve our biggest visualization challenges...|$|R
