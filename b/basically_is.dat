But after that then, we got everybody—managers, the record company—on our back to write [...] "Hold me Now, Part 2" [...] and harassing you to try and find a formula. But we can't really. We'll never find a formula for what we did. And that upsets some of them.|$|E

500|$|Weiss {{also noted}} {{about the death}} of King Tommen Baratheon, [...] "Meanwhile, while the {{explosion}} is happening, Tommen is alone. This fragile, malleable, devastated child, <b>basically,</b> <b>is</b> sitting there without anybody to comfort him, and if she had been there, he wouldn't have gone out that window. She failed him, and she alone failed him here." [...] Benioff continued about portraying the mindset of Cersei Lannister, saying [...] "I think the idea of Cersei without her children is a pretty terrifying prospect. It was the one thing that really humanized her, you know, her love for her kids. And as much of a monster as she could sometimes be, she was a mother who truly really did love her children, and now those children are gone, and all she's got is power." [...] In a subsequent interview after the episode airing, Weiss stated that Cersei's mindset following the ramifications of this episode will {{play an important role in}} the story for the next season.|$|E
500|$|Urobuchi {{attributed}} {{his past}} experience working on projects with screenwriters Ichiro Itano and Yōsuke Kuroda {{as a major}} influence in his writing for Puella Magi Madoka Magica, and has referred {{to both of them}} as his mentors. To set the initial pacing of the series, Urobuchi used a technique he credited as originally from Kuroda. The first episode would throw the viewer into a specific part of the story with unknown context, the second episode would then define the particular rules governing the story's setting, and the third episode would be responsible for divulging the revelation in the plot so as to hook the viewer. The twist in the third episode was determined during the project proposal stage and involved the death of Mami, a main character figure. This decision was controversial, and Urobuchi recalled production staff members continually approaching him and asking him to reconsider due to their own fondness for the character. However, he refused and the plot remained unchanged during production. Nevertheless, Urobuchi realized that this progression could be very hard for viewers to accept and might hurt the overall series' success with some audiences, commenting: [...] "I always thought this is an age where entertainment <b>basically</b> <b>is</b> about soothing and healing, like adopting a style where unchanging day-to-day life is to continue forever." ...|$|E
500|$|Cuse and Lindelof {{admitted}} they took some {{inspiration from the}} final episode of , [...] "", where Captain Picard jumps between three time frames. The Lost writers compared Minkowski's role to Q, as [...] "someone who is undergoing and understands the same events as our protagonist". Faraday, on the other hand, was the expert that always appears in time travel fiction—as Lindelof put it, [...] "He's our Doc Brown here, who <b>basically</b> <b>is</b> gonna tell the protagonist to go and find him in the past". Whereas the average Lost episode took two weeks to plan and write, [...] "The Constant" [...] took five because the writers experienced difficulty when determining its effect on future stories. Popular Mechanics analyzed the possibility of time travel using Losts rules. [...] Michio Kaku claimed that [...] "the show's producers did their homework". [...] According to Kaku, [...] "there's no law of physics preventing this kind of time travel—just a lack of know-how… {{it would take a}} very advanced civilization to really do this". [...] Cuse stated that [...] "we [...] try to use enough science to give a sense of credibility". [...] "The Constant" [...] was the first episode set on the Kahana, but the writers decided to avoid using the new setting just to give new information—Lindelof has declared that [...] "you would have mindless exposition unless the characters were {{in a constant state of}} crisis". According to Lindelof, Desmond's confusion prevents the characters who arrived from the island from asking questions to the freighter's crew.|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, detractors {{targeted}} the film's direction of storyline and structure. In his review for The New York Times, Harold C. Schonberg wrote, [...] "Days of Heaven never really makes up its mind {{what it wants}} to be. It ends up something between a Texas pastoral and Cavalleria Rusticana. Back of what <b>basically</b> <b>is</b> a conventional plot is all kinds of fancy, self-conscious cineaste techniques."
