5|$|A {{well-documented}} {{outbreak of}} colony losses spread from the Isle of Wight {{to the rest}} of the UK in 1906. These losses later were attributed to a combination of factors, including adverse weather, intensive apiculture leading to inadequate forage, and a new infection, the chronic bee paralysis virus, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> the cause of this agricultural beekeeping problem was similarly mysterious and unknown.|$|E
5|$|In April, Bochco {{stated that}} he did not intend to kill off Smits' character, Simone. On L.A.

Whether Smits' character would overlap with Schroder's character on screen was undetermined when Schroder was announced in June, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> Season 6 production was scheduled to commence on August 10, 1998. As of mid-July, Smits' departing episode was not scheduled to film until September.|$|E

5|$|Since its {{creation}} following the 1930 census, the 12th district had been represented by Democrats. The 12th stretched from {{just south of}} Pasadena to the Orange and San Bernardino county lines, encompassing such small towns as Whittier, Pomona and Covina. The area has since been entirely absorbed into the Los Angeles megalopolis, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> it was principally agricultural. The freeway system had barely touched the 12th district; only a small segment of the Pasadena Freeway cut across its northwest corner.|$|E

5|$|The {{score of}} the E-flat major version of Bach's Magnificat was first {{published}} by Simrock in 1811, edited by Georg PÃ¶lchau, however with printing errors, and without the Christmas hymns. It was the first composition of Bach for vocal soloists, chorus and orchestra that was printed in orchestral score, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> this publication had little success in sales. When in 1822 young Felix Mendelssohn composed a Magnificat in D major he showed that he knew Bach's version.|$|E

5|$|There {{was also}} great {{interest}} in human evolution. Neanderthal fossils were discovered in 1856, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> {{it was not clear}} that they represented a different species from modern humans. Eugene Dubois created a sensation with his discovery of Java Man, the first fossil evidence of a species that seemed clearly intermediate between humans and apes, in 1891.|$|E

5|$|A comet-impact {{mission was}} first {{proposed}} to NASA in 1996, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> NASA engineers were skeptical that the target could be hit. In 1999, a revised and technologically upgraded mission proposal, dubbed Deep Impact, was accepted and funded {{as part of}} NASA's Discovery Program of low-cost spacecraft. The two spacecraft (Impactor and Flyby) and the three main instruments were built and integrated by Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. in Boulder, Colorado. Developing the software for the spacecraft took 18 months and the application code consisted of 20,000 lines and 19 different application threads. The total cost of developing the spacecraft and completing its mission reached US$330million.|$|E
5|$|Archie Ledbrooke, {{a sports}} {{reporter}} for the Daily Mirror and the first treasurer of the Cricket Writers' Club, {{came up with the}} idea for the award. It was first presented in 1950, when Roy Tattersall of Lancashire was the recipient. In 1986, the vote was tied, and the award was made jointly to Ashley Metcalfe of Nottinghamshire and James Whitaker of Leicestershire. The 1995 winner, Andrew Symonds, went on to make over 200 international appearances for Australia, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> of his award was eligible to play for England, as he was born in Birmingham. , representatives of seventeen of the eighteen first-class cricket counties have won the award; no player from Worcestershire has ever won. Yorkshire players have collected the award most frequently, doing so on eleven occasions. Only eight winners have not gone on to play international cricket.|$|E
5|$|Chabaneau {{was able}} to easily remove most of platinum's natural impurities, {{including}} gold, mercury, lead, copper, and iron, leading him {{to believe that he}} was working with pure platinum. However, the metal displayed inconsistent characteristics. At times it was malleable, yet at times it was highly brittle. Sometimes it was entirely incombustible, yet sometimes it burned readily. These inconsistencies were a result of various impurities: rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and ruthenium. These elements would later {{come to be known as}} the platinum group metals, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> of Chabaneau's research, they had not yet been discovered.|$|E

5|$|Escape from Tomorrow is a 2013 American {{independent}} dark fantasy psychological horror film, {{the debut}} of writer and director Randy Moore. It {{tells the story of}} an unemployed father having increasingly bizarre experiences and disturbing visions {{on the last day of}} a family vacation at the Walt Disney World Resort. It premiered in January at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival and was later a personal selection of Roger Ebert, shown at his 15th annual film festival in Champaign, Illinois. The film was a 2012 official selection of the PollyGrind Film Festival, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> filmmakers were still working on some legal issues and asked that it not be screened.|$|E
5|$|For torpedo {{training}} it {{was even}} more difficult. Shallow water was needed to recover training duds. Torpedoes usually sank by 20 to 50 feet before making their run. Thorney Island was selected but then quickly ruled out as a useful site. It was later used, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> its location near Portsmouth was considered too near the English Channel and as a result Turnberry in south-west Scotland was selected instead with Fighter Command giving up the site to Coastal Command. These Torpedo Training Units (TTU) were formed in January 1943. Training in this regard enabled the Command to cope with increasing demands for trained aircrews.|$|E
5|$|In 1902 Victor Henri {{proposed}} a quantitative theory of enzyme kinetics, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> the experimental {{significance of the}} hydrogen ion concentration was not yet recognized. After Peter Lauritz SÃ¸rensen had defined the logarithmic pH-scale and introduced the concept of buffering in 1909 the German chemist Leonor Michaelis and his Canadian postdoc Maud Leonora Menten repeated Henri's experiments and confirmed his equation, which is now generally referred to as Michaelis-Menten kinetics (sometimes also Henri-Michaelis-Menten kinetics). Their work was further developed by G. E. Briggs and J. B. S. Haldane, who derived kinetic equations that are still widely considered today a starting point in modeling enzymatic activity.|$|E

5|$|Little of {{this was}} true, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> the British {{had no way of}} knowing this. The files of the Admiralstab in Berlin show that he was {{approached}} by N, rather than volunteering for intelligence service, entered their employment as early as May 1914 (rather than in August as he claimed), received regular pay rather than being unpaid, and intended to return to Berlin on completing his mission. It is unknown whether he really had any intention of going to the US, and there is no indication from the Admiralstab files that he had been asked to keep his controller's name a secret. After hearing Lody's evidence the court martial was adjourned until the following Monday.|$|E
5|$|One {{argument}} leveled by Westmoreland at {{the time}} (and often quoted by historians of the battle) was that only two Marine regiments were tied down at Khe Sanh compared with several NVA divisions. <b>But,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> Hanoi {{made the decision to}} move in around the base, Khe Sanh was held by only two (or even just one) American battalions. It is debatable whether the destruction of one battalion could have been the goal of two to four NVA divisions. Yet, even if Westmoreland believed his statement, his argument never moved on to the next logical level. By the end of January 1968, he had moved half of all US combat troopsânearly fifty maneuver battalionsâto I Corps.|$|E
5|$|Planned at short notice, {{the mission}} {{followed}} an offer by the Italian government {{to open the}} ports of Taranto and Brindisi on the heel of Italy to the Allies. The airborne division was selected to undertake the mission, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> they were located in North Africa. A shortage of transport aircraft meant the division could not land in their traditional way by parachute and glider, and all the landing craft in the area were already allocated to the other landings: Operation Avalanche at Salerno on the western coast, and Operation Baytown at Calabria. Instead, the division had to be transported across the Mediterranean by ships of the Royal Navy. The landing was unopposed and the airborne division successfully captured the ports of Taranto, and later Brindisi on the Adriatic coast in working order.|$|E
