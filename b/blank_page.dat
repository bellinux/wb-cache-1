In September 2016, the rumors led to Pitchfork {{reporting}} that Daft Punk had no plans for a future tour. A website that first appeared on 27 October 2016 featured a <b>blank</b> <b>page</b> with text reading Alive in plain text. Within the website coding were geo-coordinates based in Paris, Los Angeles, London, New York, Tokyo, São Paulo, Ibiza and Indio, the latter being location of Coachella.

5|$|There is {{only one}} early {{manuscript}} of Y Gododdin, the Book of Aneirin, thought to date from {{the second half of}} the 13th century. The currently accepted view is that this manuscript contains the work of two scribes, usually known as A and B. Scribe A wrote down 88 stanzas of the poem, then left a <b>blank</b> <b>page</b> before writing down four related poems known as Gorchanau. This scribe wrote the material down in Middle Welsh orthography. Scribe B added material later, and apparently had access to an earlier manuscript since the material added by this scribe is in Old Welsh orthography. Scribe B wrote 35 stanzas, some of which are variants of stanzas also given by Scribe A while others are not given by A. The last stanza is incomplete and three folios are missing from the end of the manuscript, so some material may have been lost.|$|E

Sensing the conservative political trends in Beijing, Jiang Zemin demanded that the article be censored. Many newspapers were printed with a <b>blank</b> <b>page.</b> Jiang then suspended Qin Benli.

500|$|... "Blank Page" [...] is {{a simplistic}} piano {{arranged}} ballad, which lasts for a duration of [...] (four minutes and four seconds). Her vocal range spans from F3 to G5. Lyrically, {{the song is}} about how Aguilera wishes to [...] "wipe the slate clean" [...] with a former lover and [...] "reconcile an old romance". She knows that she has wronged him, but is asking {{to be given a}} second chance. Andrew Hampp for Billboard noted that this sentiment is revealed by Aguilera in the lyrics [...] "If I could do undo that I hurt you/ I would do anything for us to make it through". The song begins with the chords of a piano as Aguilera sings [...] "I know there's hurt/ I know there's pain/ But people change/ Lord, knows I've been no saint/ In my own way/ Regret choices I've made/ How I do I say I'm sorry?/ How do I say I'm sorry?." [...] On the chorus, the lyrics are hopeful that she can right any wrongs she may have committed: [...] "Draw me a smile, and save me tonight/ I'll be your <b>blank</b> <b>page</b> waiting for you to bring me to life/ Paint me a heart, let me be your art/ I am a <b>blank</b> <b>page</b> waiting for life to start/ Let our hearts start and beat as one together/ Let our hearts start and beat as one forever". The arrangement of the minimalist piano composition is [...] "fiery" [...] yet [...] "spare". Aside from garnering innumerable comparisons to Aguilera's own song [...] "Beautiful", the composition of [...] "Blank Page" [...] was subject to critique by Jim Farber writing for New York Daily News.

500|$|In {{naming the}} character, {{executive}} producer and head writer Russell T Davies {{drew inspiration from}} the Marvel Comics character Agatha Harkness, a character whose surname Davies had previously used in naming lead characters in Century Falls and The Grand. Davies states that reusing names (such as Tyler, Smith, Harper, Harkness and Jones) allows {{him to get a}} grip of the character on the <b>blank</b> <b>page.</b> Jack's original appearances in Doctor Who were conceived with the intention of forming a character arc in which Jack is transformed from a coward to a hero, and John Barrowman consciously minded this in his portrayal of the character. Following on that arc, the character's debut episode would leave his morality as ambiguous, publicity materials asking, [...] "Is he a force for good or ill?" ...|$|E

Gosling undertook Muay Thai training {{in preparation for the}} role, and has described the script as [...] "the strangest thing I’ve ever read". Both the film and his performance drew negative reviews. David Edelstein of New York Magazine stated: [...] "Gosling looked like a major actor as a skinhead in The Believer and a star in Half Nelson. Then he stopped acting and started posing. His performance in Only God Forgives (would God forgive that title?) is one long, moist stare". Stephen Holden of the New York Times criticized Gosling's inability [...] "to give his automaton any suggestion of an inner life". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone commented that Gosling, while [...] "meant to be a <b>blank</b> <b>page</b> for us to write on, often looks merely blank".|$|E

500|$|In a 1955 {{letter to}} W. H. Auden, Tolkien recollects {{that he began}} work on The Hobbit one day early in the 1930s, when he was marking School Certificate papers. He found a <b>blank</b> <b>page.</b> Suddenly inspired, he wrote the words, [...] "In {{a hole in the}} ground there lived a hobbit." [...] By late 1932 he had {{finished}} the story and then lent the manuscript to several friends, including C. S. Lewis and a student of Tolkien's named Elaine Griffiths. In 1936, when Griffiths was visited in Oxford by Susan Dagnall, a staff member of the publisher George Allen & Unwin, she is reported to have either lent Dagnall the book or suggested she borrow it from Tolkien. In any event, Dagnall was impressed by it, and showed the book to Stanley Unwin, who then asked his 10-year-old son Rayner to review it. Rayner's favourable comments settled Allen & Unwin's decision to publish Tolkien's book.|$|E
500|$|When Gareth David-Lloyd {{was cast}} in the role, the {{character}} was renamed Ianto Jones. This {{was inspired by the}} character of Yanto Jones, also played by David-Lloyd, in Russell T Davies's 2004 comedy-drama Mine All Mine. Ianto shares the surname [...] "Jones" [...] with Doctor Who characters Martha Jones and family as well as Harriet Jones, Torchwood character Eugene Jones ("Random Shoes"), and Stuart Allen Jones in Davies's earlier Queer as Folk; Davies states that reusing names (such as Tyler, Smith, Harper, Harkness and Jones) allows him to get a grip of the character on the <b>blank</b> <b>page.</b> In developing the character's attire, costume designer Ray Holman comments: [...] "Ianto has a very distinct look but his suits actually vary quite a lot. He started off with some nice but boring Marks and Spencers suits in series one, which were top-end fitted ones but always very sober. Towards the end of series one, I also got him into a waistcoat, and everyone thought that looked really good.|$|E
500|$|The {{book was}} {{designed}} so {{that each of the}} Gospels would have an elaborate introductory decorative programme. Each Gospel was originally prefaced by a full page miniature containing the four evangelist symbols, followed by a <b>blank</b> <b>page.</b> Then came a portrait of the evangelist which faced the opening text of the Gospel which was given an elaborate decorative treatment. The Gospel of Matthew retains both its Evangelist portrait (...) and its page of Evangelist symbols (folio 27r, see above). The Gospel of Mark is missing the Evangelist portrait but retains its Evangelist symbols page (...) [...] The Gospel of Luke is missing both the portrait and the Evangelist symbols page. The Gospel of John, like the Gospel of Matthew, retains both its portrait (folio 291v, see at right) and its Evangelist symbols page (...) [...] It can be assumed that the portraits for Mark and Luke and the symbols page for Luke at one time existed but have been lost. The use of all four of the Evangelist symbols in front of each Gospel is striking and was intended to reinforce the message of the unity of the Gospels.|$|E

500|$|Henry {{tried to}} present his victory as a new {{beginning}} for the country; he hired chroniclers to portray his reign as a [...] "modern age" [...] with its dawn in 1485. [...] Hicks states that the works of Vergil and the blind historian Bernard André, promoted by subsequent Tudor administrations, became the authoritative sources for writers {{for the next four}} hundred years. [...] As such, Tudor literature paints a flattering picture of Henry's reign, depicting the Battle of Bosworth as the final clash of the civil war and downplaying the subsequent uprisings. [...] For England the Middle Ages ended in 1485, and English Heritage claims that other than William the Conqueror's successful invasion of 1066, no other year holds more significance in English history. By portraying Richard as a hunchbacked tyrant who usurped the throne by killing his nephews, the Tudor historians attached a sense of myth to the battle: it became an epic clash between good and evil with a satisfying moral outcome. [...] According to Reader Colin Burrow, André was so overwhelmed by the historic significance of the battle that he represented it with a <b>blank</b> <b>page</b> in his Henry VII (1502). [...] For Professor Peter Saccio, the battle was indeed a unique clash in the annals of English history, because [...] "the victory was determined, not by those who fought, but by those who delayed fighting until they were sure of being on the winning side." ...|$|E
500|$|As well as lavish illumination, {{the period}} saw the {{development}} of a distinct English tradition of line drawing in manuscripts, sometimes with the addition of light colour in ink or wash (watercolour), often to reinforce ink in highlighting outlines. This is often divided into two rather different sub-styles. These also developed from continental styles [...] one of which, sometimes referred to as the [...] "Utrecht style", was influenced strongly by the presence in Canterbury from around 1000 of the Carolingian Utrecht Psalter, where each psalm is illustrated with a panoramic ink drawing full of tiny figures. The Harley Psalter from Canterbury (probably 1020s) is a copy, with differences in style such as the addition of coloured washes. Dunstan was himself an artist, as were many monks who rose to senior positions, and the earliest datable outline drawing is probably by him, and includes a portrait of him prostrating himself before Christ. This was added to a <b>blank</b> <b>page</b> in an older book, probably before his exile in 956. The other [...] "Winchester" [...] style of drawing can be characterised by detailed and agitated drapery, an effect sometimes taken to excess, but giving animation to figures. The skilled use of line drawing continued to be a feature of English art for centuries, for example in the Eadwine Psalter (Canterbury, probably 1150s) and the work of Matthew Paris, monk of St Albans (c. 1200 – 1259) and his followers.|$|E
