40|$|The {{movement}} of water through temperate glaciers {{is important for}} understanding fundamental issues within glaciology. These include glacier induced floods, glacier dynamics and run-off prediction. Traditional englacial hydrology is thought to consist of interconnected tubular channels that merge down-glacier and drain through the glacier to the bed. However, englacial hydrology is much debated as the links between the glacier surface and bed are not well understood. Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is a geophysical tool that is well suited for studying glaciated areas. Recent ice coring attempts in New Zealand’s temperate alpine glaciers were not successful in coring to bedrock due to the interception of water at depth. This highlights {{the need for a}} better understanding of the englacial hydrology of temperate systems. This study investigates the englacial hydrology at Annette Plateau where on three occasions the interception of water has prevented successful coring to the glacier <b>bed.</b> <b>Ground</b> penetrating radar was used to conduct two high-resolution surveys on Annette Plateau in early spring 2011 and early summer 2011. Across-glacier profiles were acquired at 20 m spacing to enable tracking of englacial reflectors between profiles. Models of temperate englacial features were made to aid feature identification within radar profiles. Radar data is compared with density, stratigraphy and chemistry results from the 45 m ice core obtained at Annette Plateau in winter 2009. The early-summer survey indicates an increase in the glacier’s water content compared with the early-spring survey. Englacial reflectors show evidence of (a) spatially continuous englacial conduits, (b) the formation of a water table feature which shallows down glacier, and (c) detailed bedrock topography. Hydropotential surfaces, calculated for the water table and bedrock horizons, show the direction of water flow. Ice core chemistry shows a correlation between the depth of the water table and a significant hiatus indicated by tritium dating. We infer that an extensive water table has formed on an old melt surface where ice from approximately 1930 - 1991 has been removed. This water table responds to seasonal temperature changes and hydrological inputs...|$|E
40|$|Standardization of {{measurement}} procedures and performances are important goals in every {{field of science}} and are in general intensely pursued by scientists. Certain natural phenomena, however, present particularly difficult challenges in this regard and many efforts are still needed to actually reach standardization and systematic performance {{of measurement}}s. Debris flows certainly belong to this latter category. Due to their low frequency of occurrence, their short duration and their sudden and abrupt nature they are extremely difficult to be measured. Only instrumented basins where debris flows occur with a sufficiently high frequency per year allow systematic monitoring activities. Even though during the last decades several such basin have been instrumented, field measurement data are still scanty and methods of measurement are not yet sufficiently standardized. One {{of the goals of}} the European Territorial Cooperation project SedAlp "Sediment management in Alpine basins: integrating sediment continuum, risk mitigation and hydropower" (Alpine Space Programme 2007 - 2013) is to make some advancement in this direction. One of the expected outputs of the SedAlp project is a protocol on debris flow monitoring. Ground vibration sensors have been increasingly used and tested, during the last few years, as devices to monitor debris flows and they have also been proposed as one of the more reliable devices for the design of debris flow warning systems. The need to process the output of ground vibration sensors, to diminish the amount of data to be recorded, is usually due to the reduced storing capabilities and the limited power supply, normally provided by solar panels, available in the high mountain environment. There are different methods that can be found in literature to process the ground vibration signal produced by debris flows. In this paper we will discuss the two most commonly employed: the method of amplitude and the method of impulses. These two methods of data processing are analyzed describing their origin and their use, presenting examples of applications and their main advantages and shortcomings. The two methods are then applied to process the ground vibration raw data produced by a debris flow occurred in the Rebaixader Torrent (Spanish Pyrenees) in 2012. The detection of debris flows through seismic devices occurs at a certain distance from the channel <b>bed.</b> <b>Ground</b> vibration detectors are installed outside of the flow path, usually {{along the banks of the}} torrent or on the surrounding valley slopes, in order to avoid damage or even complete destruction. Seismic networks, however, are also prone to detect other earth surface processes that can be confused with the passage of a debris flow. Recognizing these other processes is important, particularly when the seismic network is used for warning purposes and not only for monitoring. To this aim, two seismic networks were installed in two instrumented basins located in the Italian Alps: the Marderello (Western Italian Alps) and the Gadria (Eastern Italian Alps). Both networks were designed for debris flow monitoring purposes and for testing warning algorithms. The seismic recordings of torrential processes that occurred at different distance from the monitoring networks, within and outside the monitored channels, are presented and discussed. It was found that knowledge of the waveform that these different processes produce is critical to the successful design and implementation of seismic networks for debris flow warning. The output of the seismic devices commonly employed for the monitoring of debris flows, such as geophones and seismometers, is a voltage that is directly proportional to the ground vibration velocity. The output signal in analogical form is usually digitalized at a fixed sampling frequency to be opportunely processed. The processing is performed to both reduce the amount of data to be stored in a data-logger and to reveal the main features of the phenomenon that are not immediately detectable in the raw signal, such as its main front, eventual subsequent surges, the wave form and so on. The processing also allows a better and sounder development of algorithms, when seismic devices are employed for warning purposes. However, the processing of the raw signal alters in different ways the original raw data, depending on the processing method adopted. This may consequently limit or reduce the efficacy of the warning. To this aim, the methods of amplitude and impulses have been also applied to some seismic recordings obtained in the instrumented basin of Illgraben (Switzerland) and Chalk Cliffs (USA). Data from two years of seismic monitoring performed in the Gadria basin are presented and discussed, together with the warning algorithm integrated in the system since 2014. In summer 2014 the alarm was correctly triggered by a debris flow and a red light was activated 3 minutes before the passage of the main front through the cross-section where this experimental semaphore is installed. The alarm lasted for the whole duration of the flow, correctly switching off after 20 minutes. Testing the algorithm on the whole seismic dataset recorded during both summers 2013 and 2014, the two debris flows event occurred in this time interval were correctly detected and only 3 false alarm where produced. After numerical simulation, it was possible to state that to eliminate false alarms a non-simultaneousness criterion in the threshold triggering can be adopted. The analysis of the frequency content of the seismic traces recorded at Gadria also allowed to draw some preliminary conclusions on the spectral characterization of the debris flow phenomena through geophone data. Some future developments are also outlined: the next step in the definition of a more advanced and robust warning system would be possible integrating the spectral information in the warning algorith...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The term piosphere was orginially {{defined as}} an {{indicator}} of the localized impact of grazing on vegetation and soils. It is a radiating zone of attenuating animal impact away from a concentrator, e. g, water, mineral licks, <b>bedding</b> <b>grounds,</b> etc. Over time there may be increased soil erosion, reductions in vegetation cover and changes in soil chemistry within piospheres. This paper expands this definition to include any concentrated animal or anthropogenic impact that radiates from an area of concentration. Satellite remote sensing instruments are capable of detecting both broad-scale climatic effects and small-scale localized impacts. A remote sensing– based tool for conducting piospheric analysis was developed to help evaluate areas of landscape impact caused by livestock or other concentrators. The program charac-terizes a piospheric response using three GIS layers: a boundary (e. g., a paddock); a concentrator (e. g., a water source); and a response index (e. g., a remotely sensed vegetation index). Piospheric analysis was demonstrated within a grazing paddock that had obvious piospheres.

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of soil electrical and thermal resistivities {{is essential for}} several engineering projects such as laying of high voltage buried power cables, nuclear waste disposal, design of fluidized thermal <b>beds,</b> <b>ground</b> modification techniques etc. This necessitates precise determination of these resistivities, and relationship between them, which mainly depend on the soil type, its origin, compaction density and saturation. Such a relationship would also be helpful for determining one of these resistivities, if {{the other one is}} known. With this in view, efforts were made to develop artificial neural network (ANN) models that can be employed for estimating the soil electrical resistivity based on its soil thermal resistivity and the degree of saturation. To achieve this, measurements of electrical and thermal resistivities were carried out on different types soils compacted at different densities and moisture contents. These models were validated by comparing the predicted results vis-A-vis those obtained from experiments. The efficiency of these ANN models in predicting the soil electrical resistivity has been demonstrated, if its thermal resistivity is known. These ANN models are found to yield better results as compared to the generalized relationships proposed by the earlier researchers. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. ...|$|R

Furthermore, since L-band is sensitive to ebullition bubbles trapped by lake ice (bubbles increase backscatter), this study helps to elucidate potential confounding factors of bubbles in efforts to detect floating vs. grounded ice using L-band SAR...|$|R

40|$|Although it {{is widely}} {{understood}} that {{the collapse of the}} West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) would cause a global sea-level rise of 6 m, there continues to be considerable debate about the response of this ice sheet to climate change. The stability of the WAIS, which is characterized by a <b>bed</b> <b>grounded</b> well below sea level, may depend on geologically controlled conditions at the base, which are independent of climate. Ice streams moving up to 750 m/yr disperse material from the interior through to the oceans. As these ice streams tend to buffer the reservoir of slow-moving inland ice from exposure to oceanic degradation, understanding the ice-streaming process is important for evaluating WAIS stability. There is strong evidence that ice streams slide on a lubricating layer of water-saturated till. Development of this basal layer requires both water and easily eroded sediments. Active lithospheric extension may elevate regional heat flux, increase basal melting, and trigger ice streaming. If a geologically defined boundary with a sharp contrast in geothermal flux exists beneath the WAIS, ice streams may only be capable of operating as a buffer over a restricted region. Should ocean waters penetrate beyond this boundary, the ice-stream buffer would disappear, possibly triggering a collapse of the inland ice reservoir. Aerogeophysical evidence for active volcanism and elevated heat flux beneath the WAIS near the critical region where ice streaming begins is presented...|$|R
