Although Cesar apologizes immediately, Sebastian is unforgiving. Their duel {{is interrupted by}} a runaway <b>bull.</b> <b>Trapped</b> {{on the ground with}} his sword belt tangled in his boot, certain to be gored by the bull, Sebastian is saved at the last minute by Cesar.

25|$|In Giant (1956), Mineo played Angel Obregon II, a Mexican boy {{killed in}} World War II, {{but many of}} his {{subsequent}} roles were variations of his role in Rebel Without a Cause, and he was typecast as a troubled teen. In the Disney adventure Tonka (1958), for instance, Mineo starred as a young Sioux named White <b>Bull</b> who <b>traps</b> and domesticates a clear-eyed, spirited wild horse named Tonka that becomes the famous Comanche, the lone survivor of Custer's Last Stand.|$|R
50|$|If {{the price}} action traders have other {{reasons to be}} bearish in {{addition}} to this action, they will be waiting for this situation and will take the opportunity to make money going short where the <b>trapped</b> <b>bulls</b> have their protective stops positioned. If the reversal in the outside bar was quick, then many bearish traders will be as surprised as the bulls and the result will provide extra impetus to the market as they all seek to sell after the outside bar has closed. The same sort of situation also holds true in reverse for retracements of bear trends.|$|R

40|$|This section {{describes}} work {{accomplished in}} 2000 that continued to address two objectives of this project. These objectives are (1) determine {{the distribution of}} juvenile and adult bull trout Salvelinus confluentus and habitats associated with that distribution, and (2) determine fluvial and resident bull trout life history patterns. Completion of these objectives is intended through studies of bull trout in the Grande Ronde, Walla Walla, and John Day basins. These basins were selected because they provide a variety of habitats, from relatively degraded to pristine, and bull trout populations were thought to vary from relatively depressed to robust. In all three basins we continued to monitor the movements of bull trout with radio transmitters applied in 1998 (Hemmingsen, Bellerud, Gunckel and Howell 2001) and 1999 (Hemmingsen, Gunckel and Howell 2001). No new radio transmitters were applied to bull trout of the upper John Day River subbasin, Mill Creek (Walla Walla Basin), or the Grande Ronde Basin in 2000. We did implant radio transmitters in two bull trout incidentally captured in the John Day River near {{the confluence of the}} North Fork John Day River. In Mill Creek, we used traps to capture migrant bull trout to obtain data for the third successive year in this stream. With these traps, we intended to determine the timing of bull trout movements both upstream and downstream, and to determine the relative abundance, size and age of migrant fish. Because we captured migrant <b>bull</b> trout with <b>traps</b> for three years in the upper John Day River and its tributaries (Hemmingsen, Bellerud, Buchanan, Gunckel, Shappart and Howell 2001; Hemmingsen, Bellerud, Gunckel and Howell 2001; Hemmingsen, Gunckel and Howell 2001) and traps were no longer needed to capture bull trout for radio-tagging, no traps were operated in the John Day Basin in 2000...|$|R
