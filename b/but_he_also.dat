5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1770s, Johnson {{had become}} an {{established}} publisher. Writers—particularly Dissenters—sought him out, and his home started to become the centre of a radical and stimulating intellectual milieu. Because he was willing to publish multiple opinions on issues, he was respected as a publisher by writers from across the political spectrum. Johnson published many Unitarian works, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>also</b> issued works criticizing them; although he was an abolitionist, he also published works arguing in favour of the slave trade; he supported inoculation, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>also</b> published works critical of the practice.|$|E

50|$|Radar is {{a monkey}} who wears lime green. He is Comet's best friend. He is {{depicted}} as being athletic, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> can sometimes {{be a little bit}} grumpy. <b>but</b> <b>he's</b> <b>also</b> a bit of a sore loser. He is voiced by Joe Gaudet.|$|R
50|$|He is {{typically}} an attacking midfielder, who operated {{primarily on the}} right side of the midfield, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> can <b>also</b> play through the middle as well as the left occasionally. He is known for his crossing and playmaking abilities <b>but</b> <b>he</b> is <b>also</b> an able goalscorer.|$|R
5|$|In private life, {{he is said}} to {{have had}} a {{weakness}} for gambling, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>also</b> had a reputation of an honest reformer, who puts the good of the country above his own.|$|E
5|$|Bonfiglioli often bought {{material}} from writers without an established reputation; {{he did not}} make any special effort to acquire stories from well-known names. He was known for writing long and helpful rejection letters to newcomers, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>also</b> {{had a reputation for}} laziness, and much of the day-to-day editorial work was done by assistants—first James Parkhill-Rathbone, and then Keith Roberts.|$|E
5|$|Christiansen (1998) {{estimated}} that the leg bones of Tyrannosaurus were not significantly stronger than those of elephants, which are relatively limited in their top speed and never actually run (there is no airborne phase), and hence proposed that the dinosaur's maximum speed would have been about , {{which is about the}} speed of a human sprinter. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>also</b> noted that such estimates depend on many dubious assumptions.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{his lack}} of an {{extensive}} formal education, Brock appreciated its importance. As an adult, he spent much time reading {{in an attempt to}} improve his education. He read many works on military tactics and science, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>also</b> read ancient history and other less immediately practical topics. At the time of his death, he owned a modest library of books, including classic works by Shakespeare, Voltaire, and Samuel Johnson.|$|E
5|$|Grill {{was also}} {{interested}} in porcelain. Part of his orders may have been {{just a way to}} get his money transferred from China to Sweden after he was ordered to return home in 1768, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>also</b> ordered his own armorial dinner service.|$|E
5|$|In 1781, Adams {{retired from}} the Continental Congress. His health was one reason; he was {{approaching}} his sixtieth birthday and suffered from tremors that made writing difficult. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>also</b> wanted to return to Massachusetts to influence politics in the Commonwealth. He returned to Boston in 1781, and never left Massachusetts again.|$|E

5|$|John Albert Bauer (4 June 1882 – 20 November 1918) was a Swedish {{painter and}} illustrator. His work is {{concerned}} with landscape and mythology, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>also</b> composed portraits. He {{is best known for}} his illustrations of early editions of Bland tomtar och troll (Among Gnomes and Trolls), an anthology of Swedish folklore and fairy tales.|$|E
5|$|Osbert's lands were chiefly in Norfolk and Suffolk, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>also</b> {{had some}} lands in Essex and {{some from the}} Count of Perche. Other lands were held from two monastic houses in East Anglia: St Benet Holme and Bury St Edmunds.|$|E
5|$|St. Augustine (354430) {{believed}} that the determinism of astrology conflicted with the Christian doctrines of man's free will and responsibility, and God not being the cause of evil, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>also</b> grounded his opposition philosophically, citing the failure of astrology to explain twins who behave differently although conceived {{at the same moment}} and born at approximately the same time.|$|E
50|$|I’m a Punisher guy. What Garth Ennis {{has done}} with Frank Castle really is what made me realize what comic books could do. The Foolkiller is {{obviously}} different {{in a number of}} ways from the Punisher, <b>but</b> <b>he’s</b> <b>also</b> perhaps the closest thing the Marvel Universe has to him.|$|R
5000|$|Hart was {{described}} by the Liverpool website as [...] "a left-back, who relishes going forward and poses a real threat when pushing on down the flank", and someone who [...] "can carry the attack with his fine athletic profile - <b>but</b> <b>he's</b> <b>also</b> very strong in the tackle".|$|R

5|$|A {{year after}} his first novel was {{published}} Maugham began contributing to magazines and periodicals; initially these were short stories, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>also</b> wrote opinion pieces, non-fictional and autobiographical work, and letters. Much of his non-fictional writing was published in book form, and covered a range of topics, including travel, current affairs, autobiography and belles lettres. Maugham was also editor {{on a number of}} works, which often included adding a preface or introductory chapter to the work of other writers. In 1903 his first play was performed, A Man of Honour at the Imperial Theatre, London. It was the first of many of his works that were produced for the stage, and with the later development of cinema, his novels and stories were also adapted for the big screen.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} the Boston Latin School in 1750, Hancock {{enrolled}} in Harvard College and received a bachelor's degree in 1754. Upon graduation, he began to work for his uncle, just as the French and Indian War (1754–1763) had begun. Thomas Hancock had close relations with the royal governors of Massachusetts and secured profitable government contracts during the war. John Hancock learned much about his uncle's business during these years and was trained for eventual partnership in the firm. Hancock worked hard, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>also</b> enjoyed {{playing the role of}} a wealthy aristocrat and developed a fondness for expensive clothes.|$|E
5|$|After {{his term}} as governor, Brown again {{returned}} to his legal practice in Louisville. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the House of Representatives in 1896, losing to Republican Walter Evans. He would later claim that he had only run {{in order to improve}} Democratic voter turnout for William Jennings Bryan's 1896 presidential bid. Prior to the 1899 Democratic nominating convention, Brown was mentioned as a possible gubernatorial nominee, but he declined to become a candidate. When the convention began, he was mentioned as a candidate for convention chairman, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>also</b> refused to serve in this capacity.|$|E

He becomes the companion protector to Da’an, <b>but</b> <b>he's</b> <b>also</b> the Resistance (liberation group) leader.|$|R
5|$|After {{returning}} to continental Europe, Forster turned toward academia. He traveled to Paris {{to seek out}} a discussion with the American revolutionary Benjamin Franklin in 1777. He taught natural history at the Collegium Carolinum in the Ottoneum, Kassel (1778–84), and later at the Academy of Vilna (Vilnius University) (1784–87). In 1788, he became head librarian at the University of Mainz. Most of his scientific work during this time consisted of essays on botany and ethnology, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>also</b> prefaced and translated many books about travel and exploration, including a German translation of Cook's diaries.|$|E
5|$|At {{the outset}} of his regency, Pedro promulgated decrees that {{guaranteed}} personal and property rights. He also reduced government expenditure and taxes. Even the revolutionaries arrested in the Merchants' Exchange incident were set free. On 5 June 1821, army troops under Portuguese lieutenant general Jorge Avilez (later Count of Avilez) mutinied, demanding that Pedro should take an oath to uphold the Portuguese Constitution after it was enacted. The prince rode out alone to intervene with the mutineers. He calmly and resourcefully negotiated, winning {{the respect of the}} troops and succeeding in reducing the impact of their more unacceptable demands. The mutiny was a thinly veiled military coup d'état that sought to turn Pedro into a mere figurehead and transfer power to Avilez. The prince accepted the unsatisfactory outcome, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>also</b> warned that {{it was the last time}} he would yield under pressure.|$|E
5|$|At these concerts, Bache {{frequently}} {{appeared as}} soloist, accompanist or conductor, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>also</b> engaged other artists {{in an attempt}} to show he was not giving the concerts out of self-aggrandizement. Bülow conducted two concerts, Edward Dannreuther led the orchestra in two concerts. August Manns, the conductor of a series of orchestral concerts held at the Crystal Palace and an admirer of Liszt's works, led four concerts. The majority of instrumentalists engaged were also members of the Crystal Palace orchestra to ensure the level of performance was as high as possible. Among guest soloists was the noted violinist August Wilhelmj, who played the Bach Chaconne in D minor at one concert.|$|E
