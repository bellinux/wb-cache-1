40|$|For {{the reasons}} of {{environmental}} problems connected {{with the use of}} furan binders the attention is increasingly paid to self-setting mixtures with alkali resols. A resol binder stabilized with KOH, NaOH is hardened by liquid esters with the formation of alkaline salts. The increase of their concentration affects the shortening of the mixture <b>bench</b> <b>life,</b> it decreases strength, abrasive wear of moulds and cores is growing, and it results in uneconomical dilution of the reclaim with expensive new base sand. Length of life (<b>bench</b> <b>life)</b> of mixtures plays an important role just in manufacture of huge and voluminous moulds and cores in self-setting mixtures. This contribution aims at analyzing the function of reactive alkaline salts in the reclaim, it monitors consequences of its thermal exposure on properties of self-setting mixtures, and it deals with development of methods evaluating its qualities...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This {{paper will}} cover some {{processing}} routes along with grading and physical/chemical attributes of silica sand. The silica sand {{in this experiment}} was divided into four lots, {{and each of them}} was processed by the methods of calcining, scrubbing, mulling or rubbing respectively. The test results show that the sand grains which processed by different processing methods are irregular, the acid demand value of sand is lower than that of the base sand, and the grain size distribution of sand {{is similar to that of}} the base sand. However, the SiO 2 content of processed sand is increased, the impurities content has a downward trend. Compared with the base sand, it can be found that the tensile strength value of molding sand prepared using the processed sands is higher and the <b>bench</b> <b>life</b> is almost no change...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{foundries}} increasingly use chemically-bonded no-bake sand cores and molds {{because they}} provide ease of molding, good surface finish, and collapsibility. One {{of the most popular}} binder systems is oil urethane no-bake comprising three parts: alkyd resin, catalyst, and crosslinking agent. Their amounts and ratios can influence mold shrinkage, and thereby dimensional quality of the resulting casting. With rising emphasis on net-shape casting, {{there is a need to}} optimize the binder composition to minimize the dimensional errors, while achieving the desired <b>bench</b> <b>life,</b> stripping time and hardness. This work investigates the effect of binder composition on the dimensions of chemically-bonded sand cores (25 mm diameter and 100 mm length) with respect to time. The maximum shrinkage of 0. 15 % over length was observed when resin content was 2. 4 % by weight of sand. The rate of shrinkage was higher with increase in the amount of catalyst. Core hardness and reduction in weight were also measured followed by SEM studies to gain a better understanding of the underlying phenomena, including formation of resin bridges between compacted sand particles and evaporation of solvent. This work is expected to aid in selection of the most appropriate binder composition for a given set of molding process constraints and cast product requirements...|$|E

The leading Liberal Unionists were {{invited to join the}} Conservative Lord Salisbury's government. Salisbury said he was even willing to let Hartington become Prime Minister of a coalition ministry but the latter declined. In part, Hartington was worried this would split the Liberal Unionists and lose them votes from pro-Unionist Liberal supporters. The Liberal Unionists, despite providing the necessary margin for Salisbury's majority, continued to sit on the opposition <b>benches</b> throughout the <b>life</b> of the parliament, and Hartington and Chamberlain uneasily shared the opposition Front Bench with their former colleagues Gladstone and Harcourt.|$|R

40|$|Collaboratories: Speaking to {{the power}} of big science Consider two genetically {{identical}} mice. One is fed a low-fat diet, the other high-fat. The mouse eating high fats not only gets fat, but eats more and undergoes many changes, while the low-fat fed mouse remains healthy. In the era of big science, experiments now can sample every circulating protein and all the tissues affected by the high-fat diet that cause metabolic changes and other problems associated with obesity and diabetes. “It’s amazing, but how can we make sense of it? ” asked Alan Saltiel, a cell biologist who is director of the Life Sciences Institute at the University of Michigan. “We can examine every gene, every protein, every metabolite, and look at the patterns of changes until we’re blue in the face, {{but at the end of}} the day, we’re left with a big time dilemma: What do we do with all this data?” The mapping of the human genome has given scientists vast new amounts of data that are breathtaking — and daunting. The <b>benches</b> of each <b>life</b> sciences discipline — labs of geneticists, structural biologists, biochemists, physiologists, and more — can test every protein from every tissue in pursuit of answers to questions about human health. And there are so many questions: What happens at the genetic level that cause problems associated with disease? In which tissue does the problem first arise? How can the data be used? Can the answers lead to cures or drug development to address the problems? “It’s not enough to do big science, but we have to develop a language of collaboration to communicate across disciplines to take advantage of all the data, ” said Saltiel. And at LSI it’s not only the open benches, the “laboratory without walls, ” that are creating an exchange of ideas, but the open doors that invite interaction...|$|R
40|$|In 1991, Clarence Thomas was {{confirmed}} {{as the first}} Black radical conservative Justice, in spite of opposition including credible allegations of sexual harassment lodged against him. His unprecedented confirmation evoked unprecedented reactions, including written ones. One such written action {{is the basis for}} this article. Our nation is now fast approaching the anniversary, not only of Thomas’ 25 ceremonial years on the Court, but also of almost 25 years since an unprecedented, published, pointed, open, publicly and widely circulated correspondence was sent to the newly confirmed Justice Thomas by another Black judge. Esteemed Federal Judge A. Leon Higginbotham, Jr., penned An Open Letter to Justice Clarence Thomas from a Federal Judicial Colleague. Higginbotham wrote this personal letter to Thomas, after the bitter confirmation process, to remind the new Justice, and perhaps chastise him, too, about the good, and the harm, Thomas could do toward underrepresented people, many with backgrounds similar to Thomas, from the <b>bench</b> with this <b>life</b> appointment. For over these 25 years, there is no evidence Justice Thomas ever wrote in response. Therefore, this essay is a construction of Thomas 2 ̆ 7 implicit 2 ̆ 2 response 2 ̆ 2 to Higginbotham’s call in his open letter. This essay construes such by examining Thomas’ response from the bench. Thomas’ response, though not addressed in a return letter to Higginbotham, is directed to all who, like Higginbotham, are concerned with Thomas’ views as to his role on the Court. This essay is {{based on the premise that}} the best evidence of Thomas’ response is seen in the opinions he has written and the sides he has taken in constitutional disputes or, as his late judicial comrade may say, cultural wars over the constitutional meaning of equality in this country...|$|R
5000|$|Born in Târgoviște, {{his parents}} were Alexandru Brătescu, a low-ranking boyar {{and the son of}} a pitar (bread supplier), and Alexandrina, {{daughter}} of Ion Voinescu, a major in the Wallachian Revolution of 1848. He was the second of four children. His childhood took place amidst the traditional environment of old Târgoviște and at the Brătești estate. He attended primary school in his native town from 1875 to 1879, then at the Cocorăscu boarding school and finally at Saint Sava High School in Bucharest from 1879 to 1883. One theory, unsupported by documentary evidence, is that his literary debut occurred with a poem in Târgoviște's Armonia magazine in 1883; a likelier scenario is that it took place in România magazine in 1887, when he published the short story [...] "Dolores" [...] with the help of Alexandru Vlahuță. He attended the medical faculty of Bucharest University from 1889 to 1890, but switched to law. At the same time, he audited the logic and history of philosophy course taught by Titu Maiorescu, entered Bucharest's Junimea circle, and in 1890 began contributing to its Convorbiri Literare. His father died in 1890, and Maiorescu took on the role of father figure in the young man's life. After graduating in 1892, he was appointed a judge through his mentor's intervention, serving at Bucharest, Pitești, Craiova and Târgoviște. Living in his native town for nearly two decades after arriving there in 1896, he practiced as a lawyer after leaving the <b>bench.</b> Brătescu-Voinești found <b>life</b> there rather constraining: he had to sell the Brătești property at a loss, and lived on the irregular income earned from lawyer's fees. He lacked a literary discussion circle, largely editing his own work, and would eventually enter politics out of boredom.|$|R
