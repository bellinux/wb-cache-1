5|$|The {{script was}} {{originally}} too long, {{and as a}} result many sequences had to be cut, some even after they had been filmed. These included a fight scene with the Doctor and Rosanna's steward (Simon Gregor), a longer fight sequence between Rory and Francesco, and some dialogue between the Doctor and Amy following the climax. In the original script, Amy and Rory cornered Francesco after suspecting him of killing a villager and Francesco climbed up the wall. Whithouse thought this would be a relatively easy stunt, but was told it would <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> to accomplish and Whithouse revised it to when Francesco simply runs away. When discussing the script with Whithouse, Helen McCrory, who portrayed Rosanna, thought that she should hurt Amy at some point and it was added that she bites Amy while she is in the chamber.|$|E

The {{decision was made}} to prolong the negotiations with Blackfish as long as possible, since reinforcements from Virginia were expected. Boone and Major William Bailey Smith went outside again and told Blackfish that they feared that the trip to Detroit would <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> on the women and children. Blackfish pointed out that he had brought 40 horses to transport those unable to walk. Boone asked for another day to consult with the others. Leaders from the two sides smoked a ceremonial pipe together to mark the peace agreement, and then broke off negotiations for the day.|$|E

When asked whether the character would return in Soulcalibur III, Yotoriyama replied, [...] "Necrid has gone on vacation."

500|$|The film's setting {{proved to}} be a {{potential}} problem for Carpenter, who needed to create a decaying, semi-destroyed version of New York City on a shoe-string budget. He and the film's production designer Joe Alves rejected shooting on location in New York City because it would <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> {{to make it look like}} a destroyed city. Carpenter suggested shooting on a movie back lot but Alves nixed that idea [...] "because the texture of a real street is not like a back lot."

Desgrange accepted it, saying that Steinès would take the blame if the mountains would <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> to climb. In the two previous editions, the highest point was the Col de la République at [...] In 1905, Desgrange chose to overlook this, and focused instead on {{the introduction of the}} Ballon d'Alsace, because he saw that he had missed the opportunity for publicity previously.|$|E

500|$|According to Fey, in the DVD {{commentary}} {{for this}} episode, {{the show was}} not allowed to [...] "say or imply" [...] that the United States government had truly run out of flu shots, as many jokes in the original script were cut out. In addition, there were [...] "a lot of meetings" [...] in regards to where the red dot on Liz Lemon's arm would be. In the commentary, Fey revealed that the show had to ask Disney permission to [...] "imply" [...] that Jack and Elisa, while on their date, were in attendance at The Lion King musical, which was granted. The romantic scenes between Jack and Elisa, which showed them at a park at night, were filmed in front of a green screen. The show's producers initially wanted to go to different locations around New York, but believed it would <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> to shoot. In addition, Liz's scenes at the beach were also shot in front of a green screen.|$|E
500|$|At first, a {{batch of}} Z-0s were built with the Fafnir for testing, the DB 600 again proving to <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> to obtain. These were quickly {{replaced}} with the Z-1 model, which added another gun for the bombardier, but the additional weight of the nose and guns meant the bomb load was reduced to 500kg (1,100lb). The Luftwaffe, not being satisfied with the test outcome of the Z series, immediately ordered performance and design studies to increase the overall performance of the bomber. These resulted in very optimistic speeds and altitudes for all future Z variants, especially for the Z-5 aircraft. Planned performance altitudes of up to 7,620 m (25,000ft) at a maximum speed of 418km/h (260mph) with an aircraft weight of 8,100kg (17,800lb) were planned. Unfortunately, production aircraft never reached these optimistic performances during the service career of the Do 17Z. At 7,740kg (17,200lb), the heavy Do 17Z-1 used two Bramo 323 A-1 engines with self-sealing fuel cells in the fuselage and wings. The crew of four consumed approximately 20 bottles of oxygen during long flights above [...] The Do 17Z-1 had a speed of 352km/h (220mph) at 1,100 m (3,500ft). However, {{the performance of the}} Bramo 323s did not permit the Do 17 to reach 416km/h (260mph) at 3,900 m (13,000ft) and level flight when fully loaded. Range of the Z-1 at ground level was [...] while at 4,700 m (15,500ft) this increased to [...] This gave an average range of [...] The introduction of the Bramo 323P increased subsequent performance in the following sub variants.|$|E
500|$|Paul asks Mary Alice’s {{neighbors and}} friends, Susan (Teri Hatcher), Lynette (Felicity Huffman), Bree (Marcia Cross) and Gabrielle (Eva Longoria), {{to go through}} her clothes and other {{belongings}} and then pack them up, as he thinks it will <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> for him. The women end up finding a letter addressed to Mary Alice, a blackmail note reading, [...] "I know what you did, it makes me sick, I’m going to tell." [...] Thereafter, the women make a series of discoveries concerning Mary Alice’s past and her possible motives for ending her life; she was being treated by Dr. Albert Goldfine (Sam Lloyd) where she revealed that she once went by the name Angela, and she may {{have had something to}} do with a baby that went missing. [...] Paul soon discovers who sent Mary Alice the note, their next-door neighbor struggling with financial difficulty, Martha Huber (Christine Estabrook), whom he ends up strangling to death out of pure rage and burying her body in the nearby forest. Meanwhile, her son Zach begins having flashbacks and is under the impression he killed a baby named Dana, who he believed to be his younger sister and reveals this to Julie Mayer (Andrea Bowen), Susan’s daughter. Paul worries over what Susan is spreading about their family, so he tells Susan in private that Zach accidentally killed his younger sister, Dana, and that he and Mary Alice covered it up to protect him. However, it becomes evident that this is not the case when Paul tells Zach that Dana is still very much alive.|$|E

There he outlined the great similarity of the theories, but incorrectly claimed that Fatio assumed elastic collisions, even though the loss of speed of the gravitational corpuscles was explicitly stressed by Fatio as a crucial element of his theory. Le Sage sent {{in a letter to}} Boscovich the beginning of Fatio's Latin poem (modeled on Lucretius) on the subject of his theory of gravitation, and told him that he wanted to publish it, but Boscovich did not agree, arguing that it would <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> for most people to understand if it is published in Latin.|$|E

2500|$|The last, {{and most}} radical, shift in Franquin's {{production}} happened in 1977, {{when he went}} through another nervous breakdown and began his Idées Noires strip (lit. [...] "Dark Thoughts"), first for the Spirou supplement, Le Trombone Illustré (with other cartoonists like René Follet) and later for Fluide Glacial. [...] With Idées Noires, Franquin showed the darker, pessimistic side of his nature. In one strip, a pair of flies are seen wandering through a strange landscape, discussing the mistakes of their predecessors. In the final panel, we see the landscape is a city made from human skulls, and one fly responds: [...] "Don't <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> on them, they did leave us such splendid cities". Drawn entirely in black and white, Idées Noires is much more adult-oriented than Franquin's other works, focusing on themes such as death, war, pollution and capital punishment with a devastatingly sarcastic sense of humour.|$|E
2500|$|Preventing wild {{pitches and}} {{avoiding}} passed balls. Although the pitcher {{has a responsibility}} to throw with reasonable accuracy, catchers must be mobile enough to catch (or block) errant pitches. By doing so, a catcher prevents baserunners from advancing while the loose ball is retrieved. An errant pitch that eludes the catcher and allows a baserunner to take one or more additional bases is called a wild pitch. (Techniques for blocking wild pitches are described in the previous section.) A pitched ball which would require only ordinary effort to be caught or blocked by the catcher—but is nonetheless misplayed, allowing a base runner to advance—is called a [...] "passed ball". If any pitch is thrown in the dirt, and is considered to <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> for the catcher to block, it's considered to be called a [...] "Wild Pitch". If a pitcher throws the pitch and it touches your glove and goes away from you, allowing the base runner to advance, is called a [...] "Passed Ball".|$|E
2500|$|A French dip {{sandwich}}, {{also known}} as a beef dip, is a hot sandwich consisting of thinly sliced roast beef (or, sometimes, other meats) on a [...] "French roll" [...] or baguette. It is usually served au jus ("with juice"), that is, with beef juice from the cooking process. Beef broth or beef consommé is sometimes substituted. Despite the sandwich's name, the French dip sandwich was not invented in France, but in the United States. Both Philippe the Original's and Cole's Pacific Electric Buffet, two restaurants in Los Angeles, claim to have invented the French dip sandwich. Philippe Mathieu may have possibly invented the sandwich by accident around the year 1918, who according to one story, accidentally dropped a sandwich in a pan of au jus. Another story is that a fireman to Philippe's restaurant found his roast beef sandwich roll to <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>hard.</b> Thus, Philippe had it dipped in juice. Whatever the origin, Cole's Pacific Electric Buffet also claims to have invented the French dip sandwich as well.|$|E

2500|$|In a statement, Goodell {{said that}} the NFL would not {{tolerate}} [...] "conduct or a culture" [...] that put player safety at risk. He also {{said that the}} fact that the scheme went on for three years demanded that [...] "a strong and lasting message must be sent that such conduct is totally unacceptable and has no place in the game." [...] He was particularly angered that those involved had denied there was a bounty program in place. In an interview with NFL Network's Rich Eisen, Goodell said that the threat to player safety, as well as the fact the Saints lied about it, demanded significant punishment. [...] "I don't think you can <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> on people that put at risk our players' health and safety," [...] Goodell told Eisen. He reiterated this in an interview later that day with ESPN's Schefter, saying that the fact those involved [...] "continued to mislead" [...] the league about it was a significant factor in the sanctions. [...] "You have to be accountable and responsible in the NFL," [...] Goodell said. Goodell also implied that Payton would have faced significant punishment in any event, since his contractual obligation to supervise his assistants meant that he at least should have known about the scheme. He {{also said that the}}re would be zero tolerance for payments for in-game performance in the future, saying that payments for good play eventually escalate to bounties for deliberately injuring players. Later, Schefter said on ESPN's SportsCenter that league officials felt Payton was at least as guilty as Williams, despite initial focus on Williams' role as the mastermind in the scheme.|$|E
2500|$|The {{team had}} two effects with {{vehicles}} {{that did not}} perform as originally planned. The first, in [...] "Rush", involved a scene where Pete and Chloe intentionally drive their car off a cliff and Clark speeds in to catch it before it hits the ground. To attain the shot of Clark catching Pete’s car required the crew to suspend the car from a crane with Sam Jones III and Allison Mack inside the car. The scene was filmed in a rock quarry, as {{there are not many}} cliffs in the Vancouver area, with segments of the scene created digitally. The car was then filmed as it was being pulled into the air backwards—the footage was then reverse {{to give the impression that}} it was falling. Initially, Mike Walls and his crew tried to pull the car straight up, but it was not working. The movement of the car had to be tweaked to give a sense of reality. In the season finale, Jonathan and Martha crash their truck on their way home after an EMP blast, which Clark caused, sends a shock wave out that downs a telephone pole and their truck hits it. In order to get the Kent truck to roll for the moment where Jonathan and Martha encounter the wave of EMP, two stunt drivers drove the truck toward a collapsed telephone pole, skidding into it. Then, with mannequins in the truck for safety, the effects team wrapped some cables around the truck and launched it off a ratchet to make it roll. Unfortunately, this did not go as smoothly as planned the first time, as the telephone pole did not fall when they set off the explosive charge to break it. Since it would <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>hard</b> to strap John Schneider and Annette O'Toole into the truck while it is upside down, and too dangerous to flip the truck with them already in it, Mike Walls and his team built a rotating truck seat, which allowed them to strap Schneider and O’Toole in, then rotate the seat so that they are upside down and slide that into the overturned truck.|$|E
