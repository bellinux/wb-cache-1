All data were determined by the combination of pulsed-laser polymerization (PLP) and subsequent polymer analysis by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). This-so-called PLP-SEC technique has been recommended as the method of choice for the determination of k(p) by the IUPAC Working Party on Modeling of Polymerisation Kinetics and Processes. The present data fulfill consistency criteria and the agreement among the data from different laboratories is remarkable. The values for CHMA, GMA, and BzMA are therefore recommended as constituting benchmark data sets for each monomer. The data for iBoMA are also considered reliable, but since SEC calibration was established only by a single group, the data are not considered as a benchmark data set. All k(p) data for each monomer are best fitted by the following Arrhenius relations: CHMA: k(P) = 10 (6. 80) L. mol(- 1). s(- 1) exp(- 23. 0 kJ. mol(- 1) / (R. T), GMA: k(p) = 10 (6. 79) L. mol(- 1). s(- 1) exp (- 22. 9 kJ. mol(- 1)) / (R. T), BzMA: k(p) = 10 (6. 83) L. mol(- 1). s(- 1) exp(- 22. 9 kJ. mol(- 1)) / (R.

40|$|The {{influence}} of cobalt catalytic chain transfer agents to control molecular {{weight in the}} miniemulsion polymerization of methyl methacrylate has been studied. The solubility of the cobalt catalyst {{was found to have}} a large influence on the mechanism of the reaction. Two catalysts were selected for study: cobaloxime boron fluoride (COBF), which partitions approximately equally between the water and oil phases, and tetraphenylcobaloxime boron fluoride (COPhBF) which resides exclusively in the oil phase. The COBF-mediated reaction was found to be extremely sensitive to the selection of initiator, displaying poor catalytic activity in the presence of oxygen-centered radicals (derived from potassium persulfate). In contrast, the COPhBF catalytic activity proved to be independent of initiator type, as the catalyst does not come in direct contact with the initiator-derived radicals. The results are consistent with a mechanism whereby the cobalt catalyst is poisoned or deactivated in the presence of oxygen-centered radicals. In miniemulsion polymerization the catalyst can effectively be isolated from the initiator radicals, thereby allowing a batch reaction to proceed without significant loss of catalytic activity.
