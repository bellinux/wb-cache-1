5|$|Jean Baptiste Point du Sable (or Point de Sable, Point au Sable, Point Sable, Pointe DuSable) (before 1750 – August 28, 1818) is {{regarded}} as the first permanent resident of what became Chicago, Illinois. Little is known of his life prior to the 1770s. In 1779, he was living on the site of present-day Michigan City, Indiana, when he was arrested by the British military on suspicion of <b>being</b> <b>an</b> <b>American</b> sympathizer in the American Revolutionary War. In the early 1780s he worked for the British lieutenant-governor of Michilimackinac on an estate at what is now the city of St. Clair, Michigan, before moving to settle {{at the mouth of the}} Chicago River. He is first recorded living in Chicago in early 1790, having apparently become established sometime earlier. He sold his property in Chicago in 1800 and moved to St. Charles, Missouri, where he died in 1818.|$|E

25|$|Professor Katarina Sjöberg {{argues in}} The Wall Street Culture {{that within the}} media {{negative}} images of Wall Street are painted {{in terms of the}} district's market falls, money losses and deceitful gains. However, this is not what Wall Street investors are bothered by. Instead, it is the public's words and opinions which they feel mold their image. Sjöberg notes that in the American culture, money making is of utmost importance and knowing how to make money is considered to be respectable. Therefore, Wall Street investors prioritize their work as well as strive to climb the corporate ladder. They also feel obligated to maintain the image the public creates, because it strengthens their position as a Wall Street employee. They value seeing themselves as experts in their field, especially since they live in a society that values wealth. This justifies their acts of greed, and allows them to take part in activities often deemed as criminal because they feel as though it is expected. Moreover, they do not regret their actions because to them, it is part of <b>being</b> <b>an</b> <b>American.</b> Aside from living up to the public's image, Wall Street workers justify their high salaries with an argument pointed out by Karen Ho in Disciplining Investment Bankers, Disciplining the Economy: Wall Street's Institutional Culture of Crisis, the Downsizing of Corporate America. She argues that {{due to the fact that}} the financial market is volatile in conjunction with the existence of job insecurity, Wall Street workers are compensated through their salaries.|$|E

500|$|Some critics, however—including Edgar Allan Poe—felt {{that while}} Irving {{should be given}} credit for being an innovator, the writing itself was often unsophisticated. [...] "Irving is much over-rated", Poe wrote in 1838, [...] "and a nice {{distinction}} might be drawn between his just and his surreptitious and adventitious reputation—between what {{is due to the}} pioneer solely, and what to the writer". A critic for the New-York Mirror wrote: [...] "No man in the Republic of Letters has been more overrated than Mr. Washington Irving". Some critics noted especially that Irving, despite <b>being</b> <b>an</b> <b>American,</b> catered to British sensibilities and, as one critic noted, wrote [...] "of and for England, rather than his own country".|$|E

[...] But Cameron admitted to some ambiguity on the issue, agreeing that [...] "the bad guys could be America in this movie, or the good guys could be America in this movie, depending on your perspective", and stated that Avatars defeat at the Academy Awards might {{have been due to}} the perceived anti-U.S. theme in it.|$|E

2500|$|He {{opened a}} shop in New York City in 1846 and quickly became popular during the American Civil War among {{soldiers}} and sailors of both Union and Confederate militaries. Hildebrandt began traveling from camp to camp to tattoo soldiers, making his popularity increase, and also giving birth to the tradition of getting tattoos while <b>being</b> <b>an</b> <b>American</b> serviceman. Soon after the Civil War, tattoos became fashionable among upper-class young adults. This trend lasted {{until the beginning of}} World War I. The invention of the electric tattoo machine caused popularity of tattoos among the wealthy to drop off. The machine made the tattooing procedure both much easier and cheaper, thus, eliminating the status symbol tattoos previously held, as they were now affordable for all socioeconomic classes. [...] The status symbol of a tattoo shifted from a representation of wealth, to a mark typically seen on rebels and criminals. Despite this change, tattoos remained popular among military servicemen, and the tradition continues today.|$|E
2500|$|By 14 July 1810, Elliot {{had assumed}} command of Porcupine. On {{that day the}} sailing master for Porcupine {{impressed}} an American sailor, Isaac Clark, from Jane out of Norfolk, Virginia. Elliott tore up the seaman's protection (a document attesting to his <b>being</b> <b>an</b> <b>American</b> citizen and so exempt from British impressment), declaring the man an Englishman. Over {{the next few weeks}} Elliott had Clark whipped three times (each whipping consisting of 24 lashes) when Clark refused to go on duty, and held in irons on bread and water. After nine weeks Clark surrendered. He served on Porcupine {{for two and a half}} years, being wounded in an engagement with a French frigate. Eventually he was transferred to [...] and then to a hospital due to ongoing problems with his wound. There the American consul was able to get him released and discharged, a copy of the protection having been forwarded from Salem, Massachusetts.

2500|$|Protection {{papers were}} used by American sailors to prevent {{themselves}} from being taken off American ships and impressed into the Royal Navy. These were simple documents that described the sailor as <b>being</b> <b>an</b> <b>American</b> sailor. Many of the protection certificates were so general, {{and it was so}} easy to abuse the system, that many impressment officers of the Royal Navy paid no attention to them. [...] "In applying for a duplicate Seaman's Protection Certificate in 1817, James Francis stated that he 'had a protection granted him by the Collector of this Port on or about 12 March 1806 which was torn up and destroyed by a British Captain when at sea.'" [...] One way of making them more specific was to describe a tattoo, which is highly personal, and thus use that description to identify the seaman. As a result, many of the later certificates carried information about tattoos and scars, as well as other specific information. This also perhaps led to an increase and proliferation of tattoos among American seamen. [...] "Frequently their 'protection papers' made reference to tattoos, clear evidence that individual was a seafaring man; rarely did members of the general public adorn themselves with tattoos." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the past, Cave {{identified}} as a Christian. In his recorded lectures on music and songwriting, he has claimed that any true love song is a song for God and has ascribed the mellowing of his music to a shift in focus from the Old to the New Testaments. He {{does not belong to}} a particular denomination and has distanced himself from [...] "religion as <b>being</b> <b>an</b> <b>American</b> thing, in which the name of God has been hijacked". He said in a Los Angeles Times article: [...] "I'm not religious, and I'm not a Christian, but I do reserve the right to believe in the possibility of a god. It's kind of defending the indefensible, though; I'm critical of what religions are becoming, the more destructive they're becoming. But I think as an artist, particularly, it's a necessary part of what I do, that there is some divine element going on within my songs." [...] When asked in 2009 about whether he believed in a personal God, Cave's reply was: [...] "No". When interviewed by Jarvis Cocker on 12 September 2010, for his BBC Radio 6 show [...] "Jarvis Cocker's Sunday Service", Cave stated: [...] "I believe in God in spite of religion, not because of it." ...|$|E

In his first such report, published on May 20, 1917, Emory wrote, [...] "One coming to camp is struck, instantly, by the type of men Uncle Sam has taken under his care for the next three months, and to whom he will entrust the training of the first army of 500,000. There are quite a number of men between the ages of 30 and 40, but the great majority are from 20 to 30. They are all fine, upstanding fellows, and most of them have had college educations. Many of the men are married and many were doing well in civil life before coming here. They fully appreciated what it would mean for a man to leave his family, friends and business for an indefinite period, and it makes a fellow feel proud of <b>being</b> <b>an</b> <b>American</b> when he glances about and thinks for a moment of the sacrifices voluntarily assumed by the 2,500 men here and the 38,000 men at the other training camps." ...|$|E
