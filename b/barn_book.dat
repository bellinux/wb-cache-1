Opened in 2002 as a property of the Belz Factory Outlets, it is owned by FB Orlando Acquisition Company, LLC and managed by Paragon Outlet Partners LLC. The mall was 860000 sq ft in size with Bass Pro Shops, Boot <b>Barn,</b> <b>Book</b> Warehouse, Gods & Monsters, and Ron Jon Surf Shop as anchor stores. It also comprised several entertainment venues, including a Cinemark movie theater, Sky Zone Trampoline Park, Sky Trail Ropes Course, Gods & Monsters, and a Putting Edge glow-in-the-dark miniature golf course.|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} Arts in the Parks {{is not new}} in the United States. The {{provision}} of natural and manmade theatres and amphitheatres in major American cities has been actively in process from the late Nineteenth Century. Small towns have had, {{and many of them}} now lost, band stands, opera houses, and other forms of public stages upon which the Performing Arts could be demonstrated. In the past two decades, however, the emphasis of municipal park planning and programming has been athletically oriented. A wider public acceptance of and interest in the Arts has now begun to reflect itself in park programming that provides for music, dance, and theatre, in short, the Performing Arts. A major prototype program in the American Arts/Parks movement is the Wo 1 ftrap Farm Park on the outskirts of Washington, D. C. Wolftrap offers a high quality Performing Arts program operated by a non-profit citizen's group, the Wolftrap Foundation, in cooperation with a public agency, the National Park Service. Taking example from this cooperative venture the community of Columbia, Missouri explored the possibility of a Performing Arts program in that city's new culturally oriented Nifong Park. The Maplewood <b>Barn</b> <b>Book</b> attempts to document some of the process through which this exploration took plate and offer some observations and suggestions as to further development of this and similar projects...|$|E

40|$|From {{the late}} 1960 s to about 1985, the Pulsed-Sphere Program at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) {{was carried out}} to measure 14 -MeV neutron leakage spectra from target spheres made out of various elements, compounds, and {{mixtures}} Data from these experiments have been {{and continue to be}} fundamental in the evaluation of neutron Monte Carlo transport codes and cross section data libraries In addition, the data provide important integral information for stockpile stewardship, fusion technology, neutron therapy, and other applications Therefore, comparisons between computer Monte Carlo simulations and the results of these experiments are pivotal for the integral testing of processed nuclear data libraries and transport codes Fortunately, a large subset of data from the pulsed-sphere program (some 70 experiments) is available as a computer file called disp 93 in Furthermore, in the past few years, there has been a remarkable improvement in computer performance that allows for more realistic simulations by Monte Carlo codes such as TART 4 Previous TART simulations of the pulsed-sphere experiments were performed using simplified models with relatively small numbers of histories and very large solid angle detectors to offset the limitations in computer power. Also, not all the TART input files were created with the same level of detail For example, some input files included the air around the sphere while others did not These factors prompted a study to simulate in more detail all of the available pulsed-sphere experiments using the Monte Carlo transport code, TART, and the LLNL evaluated neutron data library, ENDL The timing of this study is significant because many years have passed since those experiments were done, and only a few people who participated in them are still working at LLNL Their help has been essential for an accurate documentation of the experiments For the Stewardship Program it is important to preserve and make use of as much of the data as possible, because it represents a unique resource and an enormous effort that would be very costly to reproduce The initial part of this study consisted of an analysis of the experimental setup and neutron source characteristics necessary to create the foundation for a TART input file The next task was to create the input files for the various experiments by incorporating particular settings, such as flight path, sphere materials and dimension, etc, to the basic TART input The results of the TART simulations of these experiments will be used to help assess the quality of evaluated data currently in ENDL Further, other nuclear libraries, e g, ENDF/B-VI, JENDL- 3, and JEF- 2, will be used in the Monte Carlo simulations after being reformatted for TART and other Laboratory codes Finally, this work {{will be part of the}} integral check of the new evaluations being prepared for the Stewardship <b>Barn</b> <b>Book</b> by the LLNL Nuclear Data Grou...|$|E
