5000|$|The SEP during Cárdenas {{presidency}} {{increased the}} number and quality of schools for indigenous communities. Cardenas was also an advocate for <b>bi-lingual</b> <b>education</b> and in 1939 the SEP started a <b>bi-lingual</b> <b>education</b> program, where indigenous schools were taught in regional languages then slowly transitioned to Spanish. This {{was the first time}} national education programs used indigenous languages to acculturate indigenous children. To support this program, bilingual teachers were trained to educate indigenous communities formally, linguistically, and culturally. Ultimately, a lack of proper use of indigenous languages by bilingual teachers and indigenous resistance to cultural education meant the project only succeeded at acculturating individuals as opposed to creating regional social transformations ...|$|E

The school was founded in 1994, and offers a <b>bi-lingual</b> <b>education</b> in French and English. The bilingual educational curriculum attracts families that are internationally oriented and with resources to afford the tuition.|$|E
50|$|Saarbrücken houses several {{institutions}} of {{primary and secondary}} education. Notable is the Saarland's oldest grammar school, the Ludwigsgymnasium, {{which was founded in}} 1604 as a latin school. The building of Saarbrücken's bi-lingual French-German Deutsch-Französisches Gymnasium, founded in 1961 and operating as a laboratory school under the Élysée Treaty, also houses the École française de Sarrebruck et Dilling, a French primary school which offers bi-lingual German elements. Together with several Kindergartens offering <b>bi-lingual</b> French-German <b>education,</b> Saarbrücken thus offers a full <b>bi-lingual</b> French-German formal <b>education.</b>|$|R

The slow rate of change is com-pounded by a rapid increase in English language learners and an extreme shortage of teachers, particularly bicultural and <b>bi-lingual</b> special <b>education</b> teachers...|$|R

5000|$|In 1999 a {{group of}} Arab parents voted down a 1999 bond because they wanted one with more substantial. Instead of that $50 million bond, the parents {{approved}} of a $150 million around 2001. Extensive bi-lingual programs in the district (where some schools have 90% Arabic-origin student populations) have caused concern with the Wayne County Regional Education Service Agency issuing a report suggesting banning Arabic except where absolutely necessary. State budget cuts in 2011 are expected to heavily impact special programs including <b>bi-lingual</b> <b>education.</b> [...] In 2012 the U.S. Department of Justice asked the district to provide more information in immigrant languages to parents of students who had difficulty with English.|$|E
5000|$|The Principal, Toby Belfield, caused {{controversy}} in May 2015 when he questioned {{the merits of}} a <b>bi-lingual</b> <b>education,</b> stating {{in a letter to}} the Denbighshire Free Press that whilst [...] "tradition and heritage are important - but much more important is to ensure that we do not reduce the opportunities available for Welsh children." [...] His claims that bilingual education was educationally 'weaker' than in England and abroad received widespread attention nationally, splitting opinion. The school received attention from national press again in February 2017, after leaked emails from the Principal (addressed to the students and parents) concerning a crackdown on behaviour caused controversy.|$|E
40|$|One on {{the most}} {{important}} components of the language development of bi-lingual students is the word acquisition. The main purpose in word acquisition is to provide bi-lingual students with basic communication skills without any difficulties. Frequency studies are among the most important sources to determine the words that the student needs. Therefore it is an important issue, whether frequency studies are considered while choosing the words in the text used for the <b>bi-lingual</b> students’ <b>education,</b> or not. In this study, it is analyzed whether “Dictionary of the Frequency of Turkish Written Words” is considered or not, while choosing the text used in language training. This study, which aims to analyze the words that create the texts, is a descriptive research. In this study is used the document scanning method. The results of the study show that there is a meaningful difference between the words used in the texts prepared for the bi-lingual Turkish students and the words used in the “Dictionary of the Frequency of Turkish Written Words”. According to the findings, {{it can be said that}} frequency word studies are not effectively used to make the students acquire the necessary vocabulary in order to provide the basic communication skills. Furthermore a qualified policy is not followed about the planning of the words to be taught...|$|R
5000|$|Mercedes Gleitze {{was born}} to Heinrich and Anna (born Kurr) Gleitze in 1900 in the English coastal town of Brighton. She and her two elder sisters came from German {{heritage}} and Mercedes spent time with her grandparents in Herzogenaurach in Bavaria and two years studying at the Maria Stern Convent School in Nördlingen. Her father was a German immigrant from the county of Göttingen. He was a baker and her mother taught languages. With her <b>bi-lingual</b> background and <b>education</b> Gleitze become a secretary and stenographer in central London exploiting her talent for languages. In her spare time she started swimming in the River Thames. Her first significant record was for 10 hr 45 min she spent swimming in the Thames. This was the longest time for a woman in 1923. She attracted attention when, at the eighth attempt, {{she became the first}} English woman to swim the English Channel, on 7 October 1927. The record was in doubt when in the following days another woman claimed to have swum the channel faster. Her version of events proved to be a fabrication but the effect of this hoax undermined Gleitze's claim. Under pressure from the media she agreed to undertake a [...] "vindication swim" [...] even though the water was much colder than when channel swimming is normally attempted. Gleitze failed to complete the swim but her endurance of the cold convinced all that the original record should stand. Gleitze made not only her name but also that of Rolex's Oyster watch. The watch withstood her second swim and this was used to launch an advertising campaign in Britain. Rolex still use Gleitze's name in their publicity.|$|R
5000|$|Pearse, {{generally}} {{known as}} a leader of the Easter Rising in 1916, had long been critical of the educational system in Ireland, which he believed taught Irish children to be good Englishmen. He had for years been committed to the preservation of the Irish language, mostly through the Gaelic League, and was dearly concerned about the language's future. A trip abroad to Belgium and his observations of <b>bi-lingual</b> <b>education</b> there inspired him to attempt a similar experiment at home. Pearse also simply liked boys and wanted to spend time with them, writing: [...] "To me a boy is the most interesting of all living things, and I have for years found myself coveting the privilege of being in a position to mould or help to mould, the lives of boys to noble ends.".|$|E

In fulfilling a second purposes, the study emphasizes the influence of literacy on the social values of the Cherokees. The third purpose is to consider the idea of the Cherokees themselves that <b>bi-lingual</b> <b>education,</b> first in Cherokee, then in English, and a renewed national pride and productivity in literacy could go far in solving the problems of social alienation and educational negativism that exist among un-assimilated Cherokees...|$|E
