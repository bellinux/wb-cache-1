40|$|The {{influence}} {{of the nature of}} the composite's surface on ultrasonic polar backscatter measurements for detecting and characterizing porosity in composite laminates is studied, focusing on the effects of <b>bleeder</b> <b>cloth</b> impressions noted by Bar-Cohen (1987). The results indicate that the presence of the <b>bleeder</b> <b>cloth</b> impressions substantially influences the degree of anisotropy. It is found that, for relatively thin samples in which selective time gating is not feasible, the state of the insonified surface and the state of the back surface both influence the received signal...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} of ultrasonic polar backscatter measurements for detecting and characterizing porosity in composite laminates {{has been investigated}} {{in a number of}} laboratories[l–l 1]. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the influence of the nature of the composite’s surface on such measurements. The deleterious effects of <b>bleeder</b> <b>cloth</b> impressions, previously noted by Bar-Cohen[12], led to the hypothesis that the periodic surface features due to <b>bleeder</b> <b>cloth</b> impressions remaining after the cure process contribute significantly to the received backscattered signal, possibly masking the anisotropy of backscatter which is used to estimate porosity...|$|E
40|$|Results are {{presented}} from the continued {{investigations into the}} use of ultrasonic measurement techniques for the detection and characterization of porosity. The effects that <b>bleeder</b> <b>cloth</b> impressions (left after the cure process) have on the capability of polar backscatter to interrogate volume effects such as porosity are described. Some preliminary data regarding a comparison of phase sensitive and phase insensitivie detection for materials characterization is presented...|$|E
