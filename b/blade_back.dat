25|$|The basic {{philosophy}} of Courtney stroke {{is to keep}} the oars (sculls or sweep) in the water as long as possible and in the air as short as possible. To do this, Courtney taught his rowers to sharply lower the hands to the lap when the preceding stroke is finished. This forced the blade of the oar out of the water perpendicular to the surface. Then he required his rowers to quickly shoot their arms forward moving the <b>blade</b> <b>back</b> to start another stroke. He emphasized that the blade should be {{as close as possible to}} the water. He wanted the blade to enter the water at slight inclined to the surface of the water to allow it to enter cleanly. Once the blade entered the water, he taught his rowers to immediately start the stroke. During the stroke he wanted the blade to always be covered but not sunk too deep.|$|E
2500|$|A sliding knife is a knife {{that can}} be opened by sliding the knife blade out {{the front of the}} handle. One method of opening is where the blade exits out the front of the handle point-first and then is locked into place (an example of this is the gravity knife). Another form is an O-T-F (out-the-front) switchblade, which only {{requires}} the push of a button or spring to cause the blade to slide out of the handle and lock into place. To retract the <b>blade</b> <b>back</b> into the handle, a release lever or button, usually the same control as to open, is pressed. [...] A very common form of sliding knife is the sliding utility knife (commonly known as a stanley knife or boxcutter).|$|E

With one last touch of humanity I turned the <b>blade</b> <b>back</b> and struck him with the butt. He went headlong forward and lay stretched on the ground. I stumbled over him and stood panting. He lay still.|$|E

5000|$|Chiburui (血振るい), {{also called}} chiburi, {{is the process}} by which one symbolically removes blood from a sword blade.

50|$|Folding {{propellers}} are spun outwards by {{centrifugal force}} when {{the engine is}} turning, but when the engine stops, the pressure of airflow or waterflow forces the <b>blades</b> <b>back.</b> It follows that such propellers must be pushers, as tractor propellers cannot fold <b>back.</b> Typically, the <b>blades</b> are geared together so that they open and close in unison. Folding propellers used mainly to be two-bladed, but 3-bladed and 4-bladed versions are now available.|$|R

5000|$|The rigid arm {{scroll saw}} was popular until the 1970s but {{is no longer}} made. It has a single-piece cast iron frame. The blade is {{attached}} to a pitman arm on the bottom, which pulls the blade down. A spring in the upper arm pulls the <b>blade</b> <b>back</b> up again. This design has a significant weakness in that the tension on the blade changes with every stroke; modern scroll saws are all [...] "constant tension" [...] designs.|$|E
50|$|Cynthia {{was later}} imprisoned {{in the tower}} by the Baron (the future King Vladimir). She had an {{encounter}} with a prisoner named Lucas Cross whom Cynthia recognized as being dangerous since the prison was overrun by vampires. Some decades later in the future, Doctor Doom (upon learning of his mother's history) sent <b>Blade</b> <b>back</b> in time to free her. Even when he frees her {{with the help of}} Lucas Cross, they work together to fight off a group of vampires. Afterwards, Cynthia made her escape.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} powerhouse {{of the dam}} had {{a single}} 280 inch m six-bladed Kaplan turbine designed by Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company and a General Electric generator rated at 45.2 MW. The original turbine was placed in service in 1973. After years of heavy vibration and a poorly matched turbine design, one of the blades catastrophically failed in February 2009, causing an immediate shutdown of the plant. The sheared off blade, weighing , was later recovered from the river. The turbine runner was repaired in 2010 by welding the old <b>blade</b> <b>back</b> in place. Other cracks were also discovered and repaired at this time.|$|E
5000|$|The {{woods that}} once covered this {{earthwork}} were cut {{down in the}} early-1970s (after the publication of Sellman's book), and this [...] "hill-slope fort" [...] is now clearly visible in an open field. It is shown on Ordnance Survey maps at SS537374 (but please note that it is located on private property and is not accessible to the public). The fort is about 70 paces in diameter, and {{is located on the}} western spur of a hill overlooking to the west the valley of Knowl Water. The remains of a track leading to the fort can still be seen. Many Mesolithic and Neolithic flint scrapers, serrated <b>blades,</b> <b>backed</b> <b>blades,</b> burins, knives, and arrowheads (all identified & verified by Exeter University) as well as slingshots and other stones showing signs of having been used as tools have been found near the fort.|$|R
5000|$|The {{categories}} of stone artifacts found include cutting tools, scraping tools, incising tools, striking tools, and many flakes {{that were used}} for various purposes. The cutting tools were most numerous having 131 specimens. These included 23 projectile points, 37 knives, 13 multi-functional tools, 20 <b>blades,</b> 3 <b>backed</b> <b>blades,</b> 2 drills and 33 biface fragments. The scraping tools consisted of 31 specimens, which varied in their purpose {{and the location of}} the scraping edge. The incising tools were least numerous with 22 specimens.|$|R

5000|$|After the mix-up is corrected, Blade, Duncan {{and company}} are all set free. In an anti-climax, Duncan and Blade both enter a Knowledge bowl {{in an effort}} to get <b>Blade</b> <b>back</b> with Ellen. They succeed when Blade answers a tiebreaker {{question}} to win the competition, recalling a choice tidbit Ellen once told him. Afterward, both couples end up together. In a final scene, Duncan's dad finds out the hard way that Duncan is definitely not gay by catching him and Damita having sex in Duncan's bedroom. However, after returning to his room with his wife, he expresses relief and noted that his son's girlfriend is [...] "stacked".|$|E
5000|$|In 1876 {{a special}} plough {{was invented by}} {{agricultural}} machinery apprentice Richard Bowyer Smith, and later developed and perfected by his brother, Clarence Herbert Smith, on the Yorke Peninsula (where the problem was particularly acute). The plough consisted of any number of hinged shares: when the blade encountered an underground obstacle like a mallee stump, it would rise out of the ground. Attached weights forced the <b>blade</b> <b>back</b> into the ground after the root was passed, allowing {{as much of the}} ground to be furrowed as possible. Although a little unorthodox, the plough in action appearing [...] "like a ship in a storm", it proved remarkably effective, and was dubbed the [...] "stump-jump" [...] plough.|$|E

Later when Drizzt takes the <b>blade</b> <b>back</b> from an unfortunate orc soldier, he uses it in vicious battle with Obould, the cruel orc king. He loses Khazid'hea in this battle and Obould, instead of using the devastating blade to his advantage, throws it down a mountainside, where it finally comes into possession of Tos'un Armgo-who is undoubtedly of alike mind.|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{research}} in northern Australia {{continues to expand}} the known distribution of <b>backed</b> <b>blades.</b> It is now generally accepted that the distribution maps of 20 years ago reflect the distribution of research rather than of the artefacts themselves. The total number of such artefacts known from northern Australia is, however, still very small. During ethnographic fieldwork in the southern Gulf of Carpentaria in August 1989 the author had occasion to visit a public facility 4 km south of Borroloola overlooking the McArthur River (Fig. 1). During an early visit a light scatter of artefacts was noticed in an area denuded through vehicle and pedestrian traffic. A cursory examination located two <b>backed</b> <b>blades,</b> one broken bifacial point and one small grindstone fragment in close association. Subsequent visits failed to locate any other artefact of these types. Figure 1 General site location As far as is known this is the northernmost occurrence of <b>backed</b> <b>blades</b> in Australia to date. This find complements a recent report on one <b>backed</b> <b>blade</b> from a rock shelter close to Robinson River station (Mulvaney and Pickering 1989 : 25).
