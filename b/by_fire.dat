5|$|Like {{many plants}} in {{south-west}} Western Australia, B.attenuata {{is adapted to}} {{an environment in which}} bushfire events are relatively frequent. Most Banksia species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: reseeders are killed <b>by</b> <b>fire,</b> but fire also triggers the release of their canopy seed bank, thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; resprouters survive fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, more rarely, epicormic buds protected by thick bark. Bearing epicormic buds and a lignotuber, B.attenuata is one of the latter group, with follicles that may open spontaneously or <b>by</b> <b>fire.</b>|$|E
5|$|Like {{many plants}} in {{south-west}} Western Australia, B.oligantha {{is adapted to}} {{an environment in which}} bushfire events are relatively frequent. Most Banksia species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: reseeders are killed <b>by</b> <b>fire,</b> but fire also triggers the release of their canopy seed bank, thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; resprouters survive fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, more rarely, epicormic buds protected by thick bark. B.oligantha is a reseeder; it has thin bark, and lacks a lignotuber, so it is killed <b>by</b> <b>fire.</b> However, the species is weakly serotinous: fire triggers seed release, yet seed release still occurs in the absence of fire.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The tempotron is a {{model of}} {{supervised}} learning that allows a spiking neuron to discriminate between different categories of spike trains, <b>by</b> <b>firing</b> or not as function of the category. We show that tempotron learning is quasi-equivalent to an application for a specific problem of a previously proposed, more general and biologically plausible, supervised learning rule (ReSuMe). Moreover, we show through simulations that by using ReSuMe one can train neurons to categorize spike trains not only <b>by</b> <b>firing</b> or not, but also <b>by</b> <b>firing</b> given spike trains, in contrast to the original tempotron proposal...|$|R
