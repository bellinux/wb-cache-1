5|$|For the 2001–02 season, McGrady {{averaged}} 25.6 points, 7.9 rebounds, and 5.3 assists per game, {{earning his}} second All-NBA Team selection, {{this time to}} the All-NBA First Team. During that year's All-Star Game, he completed {{one of the most}} memorable highlights of his career, throwing the ball off the <b>backboard</b> to himself and completing an alley-oop in traffic. At season's end, the Magic were again ousted in the first round of the playoffs, losing in four games to the Charlotte Hornets.|$|E

50|$|After {{the first}} few games spectators complained {{that they could not}} see the game because of opaque wooden <b>backboards.</b> The Nurre Mirror Plate Company in Bloomington was {{employed}} to create new <b>backboards</b> that contained one-and-a-half inch thick plate glass so that fans could see games without an obstructed view. It was the first facility in the country to use glass <b>backboards.</b>|$|R
5|$|Originally {{a soccer}} player, Rolle {{did not play}} {{basketball}} until he was 15, when local coach Darrel Sears saw him walking across a basketball court and saw Rolle's great height. Sears asked if {{he knew how to}} play; Rolle said no. Sears asked him to try shooting from the foul line. His first shot, according to Rolle, completely missed the <b>backboard</b> and fell into the bushes behind it. At the time Rolle was not interested in the game and only attended Sears' practices because free fried chicken was provided.|$|E
5|$|The teams traded baskets for the {{majority}} of the second half, with the largest advantage being four points by Georgetown with over twelve minutes to go in the game. After five more minutes of game play, North Carolina managed to cut the lead to two, 56–54. The Tar Heels then obtained a single point lead with 5:50 to play and set up in their four corners offense,\ to run out the game clock. The Tar Heels were quickly fouled and Jimmy Black converted two free throws, while Fred Brown made two his own on the other end to bring the score to 59–58 in favor of North Carolina. With three and a half minutes left in the contest, Michael Jordan drove to the basket and made a shot off of the <b>backboard</b> to increase the Tar Heels' lead to three, 61–58. On Georgetown's following possession, Ewing made a jump shot to bring his team within one. North Carolina again set up in the four corners. While making an attempt to steal the ball from Matt Doherty, the Hoyas' Eric Smith was called for a foul. This sent Doherty to the line for a one-and-one, which he missed and Ewing got the rebound. Smith then hit a twelve-foot jump shot with 57 seconds left to go to give Georgetown the lead, 62–61. Then, Jordan received a pass from Black and connected on a shot with fifteen seconds remaining in the game to give North Carolina a one-point lead. On the Hoyas' ensuing possession, Fred Brown passed the ball away to Worthy, who proceeded to run out some of the clock before being fouled. Because the Hoyas were in the double bonus, Worthy received two free throw attempts, both of which he missed. Floyd got the rebound and attempted a last second shot that also missed.|$|E

25|$|In 1917 the Hoosiers {{began playing}} their {{games at the}} Men's Gymnasium. After the first few games there spectators complained that they couldn't see the game because of opaque wooden <b>backboards.</b> Therefore, new <b>backboards</b> were {{installed}} that contained one-and-a-half inch thick plate glass so that fans could see games without an obstructed view. As a result, {{it was the first}} facility – and the Hoosiers were the first team – in the country to use glass <b>backboards.</b>|$|R

25|$|A {{shot that}} misses both {{the rim and}} the <b>backboard</b> {{completely}} {{is referred to as}} an air ball. A particularly bad shot, or one that only hits the <b>backboard,</b> is jocularly called a brick. The hang time is the length of time a player stays in the air after jumping, either to make a slam dunk, lay-up or jump shot.|$|E

50|$|<b>Backboards</b> are {{designed}} to be slightly wider and longer than the average human body to accommodate the immobilization straps, and have handles for carrying the patient. Most <b>backboards</b> {{are designed}} to be completely X-ray translucent so that they do not interfere with the exam while patients are strapped to them. They are light enough to be easily carried by one person, and are usually buoyant.|$|R
2500|$|Many of Hoch's nicknames {{during the}} {{basketball}} years were [...] "Horrible Hoch" [...] and [...] "The House of Horrors." [...] Such nicknames were {{in reference to}} the difficulty opposing teams had in dealing with the tight area surrounding the court and the curved walls and decorative lattice work directly behind the <b>backboards.</b> The curvature of the walls made the <b>backboards</b> appear to be moving causing opponents to miss free throws.|$|R
25|$|The Men's Gymnasium {{served as}} the home of the {{basketball}} team from 1917–1928. After the first few games spectators complained that they couldn't see the game because of opaque wooden <b>backboards.</b> As a result, the Nurre Mirror Plate Company in Bloomington was employed to create new <b>backboards</b> that contained one-and-a-half inch thick plate glass so that fans could see games without an obstructed view. As a result, it was the first facility in the country to use glass <b>backboards.</b> Due to growing popularity of the sport at the school the team eventually had to move to a larger arena. The facility is now used by the School of Public Health-Bloomington (formerly the School of Health, Physical Education, and Recreation, HPER).|$|R
25|$|A {{block is}} {{performed}} when, after a shot is attempted, a defender succeeds in altering the shot by touching the ball. In almost all variants of play, {{it is illegal}} to touch the ball after it is in the downward path of its arc; this is known as goaltending. It is also illegal under NBA and Men's NCAA basketball to block a shot after it has touched the <b>backboard,</b> or when any part of the ball is directly above the rim. Under international rules {{it is illegal to}} block a shot that is in the downward path of its arc or one that has touched the <b>backboard</b> until the ball has hit the rim. After the ball hits the rim, it is again legal to touch it even though it is no longer considered as a block performed.|$|E
25|$|Beach basketball: A {{modified}} version of basketball, played on beaches, was invented by Philip Bryant. Beach basketball is played in a circular court with no <b>backboard</b> on the goal, no out-of-bounds rule with the ball movement to be done via passes or 2½ steps, as dribbling is next to impossible on a soft surface.|$|E
25|$|Slamball: Slamball is full-contact basketball, with trampolines. Points are {{scored by}} playing the ball through the net, as in basketball, though the point-scoring rules are modified. The main {{differences}} from the parent sport is the court; below the padded basketball rim and <b>backboard</b> are four trampolines {{set into the}} floor, which serve to propel players to great heights for slam dunks. The rules also permit some physical contact between {{the members of the}} four-player teams.|$|E

25|$|On offense, Pippen relied {{primarily}} on his remarkable athleticism {{to gain an}} advantage over his defender; he slashed towards the basket for higher percentage shots. Early in his career, Pippen was not an adept jump shooter; he struggled when shooting directly on a line to the basket. He favored shooting his jump shots—mid-range and three pointers—on an angle. He could regularly bank the ball off the <b>backboard</b> into the basket. He honed his jump shot {{over the course of}} his career and became more effective at scoring from distance later in his career.|$|E
25|$|On {{the ensuing}} Magic possession, the Lakers played great defense and forced Courtney Lee to miss an awkward layup shot with 10.5 seconds left. With {{a chance to}} take a 2–0 series lead, Kobe Bryant was blocked on a jumper by Türkoğlu, who gained control of the ball and called {{time-out}} with 0.6 seconds left. After another timeout, Türkoğlu threw a half-court lob to Courtney Lee, who had come free after a screen on his defender. However, Lee was traveling too fast and launched his layup from almost behind the <b>backboard,</b> causing it to miss.|$|E
25|$|Most level {{crossings}} (Bahnübergang in German, “passage à niveau” in French, “passaggi a livello” in Italian) in Switzerland have two red {{lights on the}} bottom of a triangle <b>backboard,</b> bells, barriers, and more rarely, another triangle with one red light in the middle. When activated, each red light flashes for a third of a second. The bells ring as well. After a few seconds, the barriers come down and the bells stop ringing. Most Swiss crossings are automatic and a few are also on rack railway systems, so they have rising teeth that come out from the ground.|$|E

25|$|The {{objective}} of rebounding is to successfully gain {{possession of the}} basketball after a missed field goal or free throw, as it rebounds from the hoop or <b>backboard.</b> This {{plays a major role}} in the game, as most possessions end when a team misses a shot. There are two categories of rebounds: offensive rebounds, in which the ball is recovered by the offensive side and does not change possession, and defensive rebounds, in which the defending team gains possession of the loose ball. The majority of rebounds are defensive, as the team on defense tends to be in better position to recover missed shots.|$|E
25|$|Typically, {{a player}} faces the basket {{with both feet}} facing the basket. A player will rest {{the ball on the}} {{fingertips}} of the dominant hand (the shooting arm) slightly above the head, with the other hand supporting the side of the ball. The ball is usually shot by jumping (though not always) and extending the shooting arm. The shooting arm, fully extended with the wrist fully bent, is held stationary for a moment following the release of the ball, known as a follow-through. Players often try to put a steady backspin on the ball to absorb its impact with the rim. The ideal trajectory of the shot is somewhat controversial, but generally a proper arc is recommended. Players may shoot directly into the basket or may use the <b>backboard</b> to redirect the ball into the basket.|$|E
25|$|Level {{crossings}} (Bahnübergang in German) in Germany {{are different}} than some other level crossings throughout Europe. These crossings use yellow and red lights and a bell/alarm (some crossings do not have these though) {{to indicate that the}} crossing is active. When activating a preliminary yellow light flashes which is followed by a red light that stays lit until the train(s) have cleared the crossing. Most of these crossings usually have a lightning symbol on the crossbucks. These symbols indicate that the railway is electrified with overhead wires. Older crossings have a single red light on a square <b>backboard</b> with a red and white boarder. After crossing the level crossing, unless there is a speed limit sign, the speed limit is the national speed limit. That is, 50km/h for built up areas and 100km/h outside built up areas.|$|E
