5|$|In May 2006 Three Valleys Water {{announced}} that it had detected the persistent, <b>bioaccumulative,</b> and toxic fluorosurfactant perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS)which is used in fire fighting foamin a ground water bore hole close to the Buncefield site. It stated that no water from this well entered the public water supply and that a nearby well and pumping station had been closed since the fire as a precaution. The chemical is a known health risk and the UK government had been about to ban its use.|$|E
25|$|In general, tissue residue {{approaches}} {{are used for}} chemicals that bioaccumulate or for <b>bioaccumulative</b> chemicals. The majority of these substances are organic compounds that are not easily metabolized by organisms and have long environmental persistence. Examples of these chemicals include: polychlorinated dibenzodioxins, furans, biphenyls, DDT and its metabolites, and dieldrin.|$|E
25|$|Arsenic is <b>bioaccumulative</b> in many organisms, {{marine species}} in particular, {{but it does}} not appear to {{biomagnify}} significantly in food webs. In polluted areas, plant growth may be affected by root uptake of arsenate, which is a phosphate analog and therefore readily transported in plant tissues and cells. In polluted areas, uptake of the more toxic arsenite ion (found more particularly in reducing conditions) is likely in poorly-drained soils.|$|E
25|$|PFOA {{contaminates}} every continent. PFOA {{has been}} {{detected in the}} central Pacific Ocean at low parts per quadrillion ranges, and at low parts per trillion levels in coastal waters. Due to the surfactant nature of PFOA, {{it has been found}} to concentrate in the top layers of ocean water. PFOA is detected widely in surface waters, and is present in numerous mammals, fish, and bird species. PFOA is in the blood or vital organs of Atlantic salmon, swordfish, striped mullet, gray seals, common cormorants, Alaskan polar bears, brown pelicans, sea turtles, sea eagles, Midwestern bald eagles, California sea lions and Laysan albatrosses on Sand Island, a wildlife refuge on Midway Atoll, {{in the middle of the}} North Pacific Ocean, about halfway between North America and Asia. However, wildlife has much less PFOA than humans, unlike PFOS and other longer perfluorinated carboxylic acids; in wildlife, PFOA is not as <b>bioaccumulative</b> as longer perfluorinated carboxylic acids.|$|E
