5|$|The plain {{appearance}} of the garden warbler means {{that it can be}} confused with several other species. The melodious and icterine warblers usually have long bills and a yellowish tint to their plumage. The <b>booted</b> <b>warbler</b> is similar in colour, although it is smaller, more delicately built and has a flesh-coloured bill. Western and eastern olivaceous warblers are also relatively small, and have white outer tail feathers as well as a pinkish bill. Juvenile barred warblers, which lack the obvious barring of adults, are much larger than garden warblers and have a pale double wingbar.|$|E

2500|$|Almost no {{species in}} the Persian Gulf is spared from the real estate {{development}} of UAE and Oman, including the hawksbill turtle, greater flamingo, and <b>booted</b> <b>warbler,</b> mainly due to destruction of the mangrove habitats {{to make way for}} towers, hotels, and luxury resorts. Even dolphins that frequent the gulf in northern waters, around Iran are at serious risk. Recent statistics and observations show that dolphins are at danger of entrapment in purse seine fishing nets and exposure to chemical pollutants; perhaps the most alarming sign is the [...] "mass suicides" [...] committed by dolphins off Iran's Hormozgan province, which are not well understood, but are suspected to be linked with a deteriorating marine environment from water pollution from oil, sewage, and industrial run offs.|$|E

It was {{formerly}} considered to be conspecific with Sykes's warbler, but the two are now usually both afforded species status. <b>Booted</b> <b>warbler</b> itself breeds from central Russia to western China, and migrates to winter in the Indian subcontinent {{as far south as}} Sri Lanka. <b>Booted</b> <b>warbler</b> has expanded its breeding range westward in recent decades and nests now as far west and north as Finland.It is a small passerine bird, found in open country with bushes and other tall vegetation. 3-4 eggs are laid in a nest in a bush or vegetation. Like most warblers they are insectivorous.|$|E
