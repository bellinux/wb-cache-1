As early as the 15th century, the Spanish horse was widely distributed throughout the Mediterranean, and was known in northern European countries, despite being less common and more expensive there. As time went on, kings from across Europe, including every French monarch from Francis I to Louis XVI, had equestrian portraits created showing themselves riding Spanish-type horses. The kings of France, including Louis XIII and Louis XIV, especially preferred the Spanish horse; the head groom to Henri IV, Salomon de la <b>Broue,</b> said in 1600, [...] "Comparing the best horses, I give the Spanish horse first place for its perfection, because it is the most beautiful, noble, graceful and courageous". War horses from Spain and Portugal began to be introduced to England in the 12th century, and importation continued through the 15th century. In the 16th century, Henry VIII received gifts of Spanish horses from Charles V, Ferdinand II of Aragon and the Duke of Savoy and others when he wed Katherine of Aragon. [...] He also purchased additional war and riding horses through agents in Spain. By 1576, Spanish horses made up one third of British royal studs at Malmesbury and Tutbury. The Spanish horse peaked in popularity in Great Britain during the 17th century, when horses were freely imported from Spain and exchanged as gifts between royal families. With the introduction of the Thoroughbred, interest in the Spanish horse faded after the mid-18th century, although they remained popular through the early 19th century. The Conquistadors of the 16thcentury rode Spanish horses, particularly animals from Andalusia, and the modern Andalusian descended from similar bloodstock. By 1500, Spanish horses were established in studs on Santo Domingo, and Spanish horses made their way into the ancestry of many breeds founded in North and South America. Many Spanish explorers from the 16th century on brought Spanish horses with them for use as war horses and later as breeding stock. By 1642, the Spanish horse had spread to Moldovia, to the stables of Transylvanian prince George Rakoczi.|$|E

Our approach is to analyze the perverse equivalence induced by certain Deligne [...] Lusztig varieties (the geometric form of <b>Broué's</b> conjecture) directly; this uses the cohomology of these varieties, together with information from the cyclotomic Hecke algebra. We start with a conjecture on the cohomology of these Deligne [...] Lusztig varieties, prove various desirable properties about it, and then use this to prove {{the existence of the}} perverse equivalences predicted by the geometric form of <b>Broué's</b> conjecture whenever the defect group is cyclic (except possibly for two blocks whose Brauer tree is unknown).

40|$|AbstractIn the {{representation}} theory of finite groups, {{there is a}} well known and important conjecture due to M.  Broué. He conjectures that, for any prime p, if a p-block A of a finite group G has an Abelian defect group P, then A and its Brauer corresponding block B of the normalizer NG(P) of P in G are equivalent (Rickard equivalent). This conjecture is called <b>Broué’s</b> Abelian defect group conjecture. We prove in this paper that <b>Broué’s</b> Abelian defect group conjecture is true for a non-principal 3 -block A with an elementary Abelian defect group P of order 9 of the Janko simple group J 4.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{conjecture}} {{on the degree of}} unipotent characters in the cohomology of particular Deligne-Lusztig varieties for groups of Lie type, and derive consequences of it. These degrees are a necessary piece of data in the geometric version of <b>Broué's</b> abelian defect group conjecture, and can be used to verify this geometric conjecture in new cases. The geometric version of <b>Broué's</b> conjecture should produce a more combinatorially defined derived equivalence, called a perverse equivalence. We prove that our conjectural degree is an integer (which is not obvious) and has the correct parity for a perfect isometry, and verify that it induces a perverse equivalence for all unipotent blocks of groups of Lie type with cyclic defect groups, whenever the shape of the Brauer tree is known (i. e., not E 7 and E 8). It has also been used to find perverse equivalences for some non-cyclic cases.

This paper represents {{the culmination of}} a large effort by a number of authors to verify <b>Broué’s</b> conjecture for a coherent class of blocks, namely principal blocks with elementary abelian defect groups of order 9. As such the result is of considerable importance, being the first class of wild type blocks to be checked in this way. The proof uses the classification of finite simple groups. Let G be a finite group and p be a prime. For a Sylow p-subgroup P of G, write B 0 (G) and B 0 (NG(P)) for the principal p-blocks of G and NG(P), respectively (with respect to an algebraically closed field of characteristic p). <b>Broué’s</b> conjecture states that if P is abelian, then B 0 (G) and B 0 (NG(P)) are derived equivalent. In fact, this paper addresses the refinement {{that there should be a}} splendid derived equivalence (Rickard equivalence), which in particular implies that the corresponding blocks with respect to a suitable discrete valuation ring are also derived equivalent.
