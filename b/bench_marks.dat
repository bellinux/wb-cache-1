50|$|Mean {{sea level}} was {{measured}} at 26 tide gauges: 21 in the United States and 5 in Canada. The datum {{was defined by}} the observed heights of mean sea level at the 26 tide gauges and by the set of elevations of all <b>bench</b> <b>marks</b> resulting from the adjustment. The adjustment required a total of 66,315 miles (106,724 km) of leveling with 246 closed circuits and 25 circuits at sea level.|$|E

50|$|A {{bench mark}} is a point, at a known {{elevation}} {{above or below}} an adopted datum, marked on a durable object. <b>Bench</b> <b>marks</b> such as an upward-pointing broad arrow symbol (used to denote a government survey from 1852) could be chiselled on a rock - {{as was the case}} at Bessie Point. Alternatively, metal disks could be attached to a rock, or to a concrete block. Often a horizontal line was cut, balanced on the point of the arrow, although only an arrow was cut at Bessie Point. Other examples of broad arrow <b>bench</b> <b>marks</b> cut into rocks exist at Bowen (1887), and at Princess Charlotte Bay in the Flinders group of islands (1899, by HMS Dart). In the case of the Bessie Point 1878 bench mark, which is cut into the largest boulder on the shoreline, the datum was low water ordinary spring tides, calculated as being 12 feet (3.66m) below the broad arrow. All water depths (in feet) on the map of Cairns Harbour made in 1878 thus represented the depth available at low water ordinary spring tides, that water level being 12 feet below the bench mark. The tidal range for spring tides in the bay was 8-10 feet (2.4-3m).|$|E

5000|$|The {{most common}} and {{convenient}} datum which is internationally accepted is mean sea level. Countries take their nearby sea levels as datum planes for calculations of Reduced levels [...] For example Pakistan takes sea near Karachi as its datum while India takes sea near Mumbai as its datum for calculation of Reduced levels of different places in their respective countries. The term Reduced Level is denoted shortly by ‘RL’. National survey departments of each country determines RL’s of significantly important locations or points. These points are called as permanent benchmarks and this survey process is known as Great Trigonometrical Surveying (GTS). The permanent <b>bench</b> <b>marks</b> act as reference points for determining RL’s of other locations in a particular country.|$|E

Overall, the Harvard endowment fell below that of its peers (in terms of capital gains). Harvard Magazine reported in 2014 that Mendillo was compensated $9.6 million in the 2013 fiscal year.
