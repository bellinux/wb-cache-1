The specific {{content of the}} final preparation was 5. 02 nmol/mg protein, which was 7. 8 -fold that of microsomes. It showed two protein bands of 49 and 32 kDa in sodium dodecylsul-fate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. N-Terminal 20 amino acid sequence of the protein of a higher molecular mass (49 kDa) isolated by an electroblotting technique is 94 % homologous with that of CYP 2 D 2. In a reconstituted system including NADPH-cytochrome P- 450 reductase and an NADPH-generating system, the final prepara-tion had the highest activity toward BTL and debrisoquine 4 -hydrox-ylation among 12 isozymes of cytochrome P- 450 examined.

40|$|Eriocheir japonicus, fresh-water crabs inhabiting {{rivers and}} {{estuaries}} in Japan, were investigated for cytochrome P 450 (CYP) -dependent drug-metabolizing enzyme activities {{to see if}} these activities reflect the river pollution gradient. From the laboratory dose-response experiments, {{we found that the}} polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) 3 -methylcholanthrene induced total CYP contents, ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase activity, and <b>bunitrolol</b> 4 -hydroxylase activity in crab hepatopancreas. In the field studies, crabs collected from the river with the highest concentration of PAHs exhibited the highest levels of CYP, the highest activities of benzo[a]pyrene 3 -hydroxylase, imipramine 2 -hydroxylase, <b>bunitrolol</b> 4 -hydroxylase, ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase, and the ability to metabolically activate benzo[a]pyrene, but erythromycin N-demethylase activity was not induced. The correlation between PAH levels and drug-metabolizing enzyme activities in female crabs were not as marked as in male crabs. The levels and activities of CYP did not appear to reflect the concentrations of organochlorines and polychlorinated biphenyl congeners (PCBs) studied in the fat of crab hepatopancreas...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} chronic beta {{blockade}} on the haemodynamic response to graded exercise was studied in 18 hypertensive patients treated with <b>bunitrolol,</b> which has partial agonist activity. The patients first received a placebo for 5 to 12 days, then <b>bunitrolol</b> 30 mg daily {{for one week}} and subsequently the dose was doubled weekly as necessary up to 240 mg daily. At rest haemodynamic changes after beta blockade were only minor; heart rate decreased by 8 % and no significant change was observed in stroke index, cardiac index, (a-v) O 2 difference and VO 2. The hypotensive effect was not significant and no significant change in mean pulmonary arterial and wedge pressure was observed. Maximal exercise capacity remained unchanged, because of haemodynamic responses. The maximal exercise heart rate was reduced by 25 % during beta blockade, which was compensated by a 34 % elevation in stroke index, whereas maximal cardiac index and (a-v) O 2 difference remained unchanged. There was no consistent change in mean pulmonary artery pressure during maximal exercise, but the mean brachial artery pressure fell by 12 %. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. To {{examine the}} effect of Babesia {{infection}} on the level of the drug-metabolizing enzyme hepatic cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 2 D, we intraperitoneally inoculated Babesia microti into male ICR mice. CYP 2 D protein and CYP 2 D 9 mRNA were significantly decreased at 12 days after infection with B. microti. The activity of <b>bunitrolol</b> 4 -hydroxylase, which is catalyzed by CYP 2 D, was also significantly decreased. The mRNA levels of transcriptional regulators of CYP 2 D 9, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 α and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 b, were markedly suppressed. These results suggest that Babesia infection represses CYP 2 D expression in the mouse liver. The decline in CYP 2 D-dependent drug metabolism might be involved in the incidence of adverse drug reactions in patients with babesiosis...|$|E
40|$|Effect of the {{induction}} of cytochrome P 4501 A 1 with 3 -methylchol-anthrene (3 -MC) treatment on kinetics of <b>bunitrolol</b> (BTL) 4 -hydrox-ylase activity of rat liver microsomes was investigated. The rela-tionship between the rate and BTL concentration showed monophasic kinetics (KM = 0. 74 ± 0. 13 aM) when microsomes from untreated rats were used, whereas microsomes from 3 -MC-treated rats showed biphasic kinetics (KM 1 = 0. 76 ± 0. 13, KM 2 = 646 ± 16 tM). Anti-cytochrome P 450 (P 450) BTL (P 4502 D subfam-ily) antiserum inhibited the reaction> 90 % when low concentra-tions (- 10. eM) of BTL {{were used in}} both microsomes. However, at high BTL concentrations (- 2, 000. tM), the inhibition was only up to a half of control in microsomes from 3 -MG-treated rats, whereas in microsomes from untreated rats, the rates were suppressed> 90 %.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{estimate}} the suitability of using accumulation of pollutants in wildlife {{as an indicator of}} environmental pollution, I investigated the residue levels of organochlorine compounds (OCs) and their accumulation patterns in 8 species of terrestrial mammals and 10 species of birds. The accumulation of OCs to environment has been of great concern, because of their persistent and less degraded properties. OCs accumulated in terrestrial mammals and birds were mostly in the order of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) >dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane compounds (DDTs) >hexachlorocyclohexane isomers (HCHs) >hexachlorobenzene (HCB). The accumulation levels of OCs in terrestrial mammals were lower than those in birds. The contamination levels of OCs were found to be higher in omnivorous mammals than in herbivorous ones, and in fish-eating ones and raptors than in omnivorous birds. In fox and dog, PCB- 180 (2, 2 ', 3, 4, 4 ', 5, 5 '-heptachlorobiphenyl) was the most dominant PCB congener, while in the other species PCB- 153 (2, 2 ', 4, 4 ', 5, 5 '-hexachlorobiphenyl) was the most persistent. This phenomenon may be caused by the species differences in metabolic preferences of cytochrome P 450 (CYP) toward PCB congeners. The residual levels of environmental pollutants depend on the balance between the levels of uptake and excretion of these chemicals. CYP multiple enzyme system {{plays a major role in}} oxidative metabolism of a broad variety of endogenous and exogenous compounds, including sterols, fatty acids, drugs and xenobiotics. The differences of the characteristics of CYP isozymes or their relative abundance lead to the differences in accumulation of environmental pollutants. Some CYP isozymes are known to be induced by xenobiotics, including environmental pollutants. I thought this property of CYP isozymes could be used as an indicator of environmental pollution. I collected Clethrionomys rufocanus (Cr) from three different sampling sites, a forest, urban and agricultural area, and investigated CYP -dependent enzyme activities in hepatic microsomes of Cr. All of these CYP dependent enzyme activities in liver microsomes from Cr in the forest area were the lowest as compared with those from Cr in other sampling sites and were comparable to those from laboratory grown control animals. Cr in the urban area had moderately induced levels of a CYP isozyme (the isozyme corresponding to rat's CYP 1 A) and related activities which are also induced by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and dioxins. The animals in the agricultural area had high levels of CYP isozymes (the isozyme corresponding to rat's CYP 1 A and CYP 2 B) and related activities which are induced by agricultural chemicals. And Cr in agricultural area also had high levels of CYP 2 C 11,CYP 2 E 1,and CYP 2 D. These results indicated that CYP-dependent enzyme activities in hepatic microsomes from Cr are rely upon their inhabiting environment (urban, agricultural and forest area). Cr in Sapporo showed the polymorphism in CYP 2 D dependent activities, in imipramine 2 - hydroxylation (IH) and <b>bunitrolol</b> 4 -hydroxylation (BH). Cr collected from the different origin were bred in the laboratory and raised under the same condition to elucidate if there are differences in genetic-makeups. The CYP dependent enzyme activities showed almost the same levels regardless of their parents' origin. Nowadays, there are huge numbers of chemicals in environment, however, most of them are unidentified and the effect of those chemicals on living organisms are not known. In order to estimate such chemicals' effects on the ecosystem of the environment, Clethrionomys rufocanus may be used as good indicator animals, because their CYP-dependent enzyme activities are differently changed with inhabiting environment. In this study, I was able to show that Cr can be used as a good indicator animal to assess the level of environmental pollution, and CYP dependent enzyme activities can be used as biomarkers of environmental pollution...|$|E
