5|$|Alive or Just <b>Breathing</b> <b>is</b> {{the second}} studio album by American metalcore band Killswitch Engage. It was {{released}} on May 21, 2002, through Roadrunner Records. Alive or Just Breathing was Killswitch Engage's first album on Roadrunner and was recorded from October 2001 to February 2002. Produced by drummer and guitarist Adam Dutkiewicz, this was the band's first album on a major label, which prompted them to write and record the album {{to the best of}} their abilities. Alive or Just Breathing has been viewed as a landmark album in the metalcore genre and was well praised upon its release by fans and critics. The lyrics, which were all written by vocalist Jesse Leach, were intended to bring a positive message through the music.|$|E
5|$|Intubation may be {{necessary}} for a patient with decreased oxygen content and oxygen saturation of the blood caused when their <b>breathing</b> <b>is</b> inadequate (hypoventilation), suspended (apnea), or when the lungs are unable to sufficiently transfer gasses to the blood. Such patients, who may be awake and alert, are typically critically ill with a multisystem disease or multiple severe injuries. Examples of such conditions include cervical spine injury, multiple rib fractures, severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or near-drowning. Specifically, intubation is considered if the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) is less than 60millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) while breathing an inspired O2 concentration (FIO2) of 50% or greater. In patients with elevated arterial carbon dioxide, an arterial partial pressure of CO2 (PaCO2) greater than 45mm Hg {{in the setting of}} acidemia would prompt intubation, especially if a series of measurements demonstrate a worsening respiratory acidosis. Regardless of the laboratory values, these guidelines are always interpreted in the clinical context.|$|E
5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} {{vary depending on}} {{what part of the}} tracheobronchial tree is injured and how severely it is damaged. There are no direct signs of TBI, but certain signs suggest the injury and raise a clinician's suspicion that it has occurred. Many of the signs {{and symptoms}} are also present in injuries with similar injury mechanisms such as pneumothorax. Dyspnea and respiratory distress are found in 76â€“100% of people with TBI, and coughing up blood has been found in up to 25%. However, isolated TBI does not usually cause profuse bleeding; if such bleeding is observed {{it is likely to be}} due to another injury such as a ruptured large blood vessel. The patient may exhibit dysphonia or have diminished breath sounds, and rapid <b>breathing</b> <b>is</b> common. Coughing may be present, and stridor, an abnormal, high-pitched breath sound indicating obstruction of the upper airway can also occur.|$|E
5000|$|Room to Breathe {{received}} generally favourable reviews. JesusfreakHideout gave it 4 {{stars and}} said [...] "Room to <b>Breathe</b> <b>is</b> as relevant and bold as ever".

50|$|<b>Breathe</b> <b>was</b> {{director}} Nicholas Winter's debut feature film. Winter {{also wrote}} the screenplay, shot and edited the film. As the storyline is based around Bailey's life in London, the film features much of London's picturesque skylines and scenery. <b>Breathe</b> <b>was</b> also filmed in Scotland and Somerset.|$|R

5|$|The lungs are {{the primary}} organs of the {{respiratory}} system in humans and many other animals including a few fish and some snails. In mammals and most other vertebrates, two lungs are located near the backbone {{on either side of}} the heart. Their function in the respiratory system is to extract oxygen from the atmosphere and transfer it into the bloodstream, and to release carbon dioxide from the bloodstream into the atmosphere, in a process of gas exchange. Respiration is driven by different muscular systems in different species. Mammals, reptiles and birds use their different muscles to support and foster breathing. In early tetrapods, air was driven into the lungs by the pharyngeal muscles via buccal pumping, a mechanism still seen in amphibians. In humans, the main muscle of respiration that drives <b>breathing</b> <b>is</b> the diaphragm. The lungs also provide airflow that makes vocal sounds including human speech possible.|$|E
5|$|The lungs {{of mammals}} are spongy and honeycombed. <b>Breathing</b> <b>is</b> mainly {{achieved}} with the diaphragm, which divides the thorax from the abdominal cavity, forming a dome convex to the thorax. Contraction of the diaphragm flattens the dome, increasing {{the volume of}} the lung cavity. Air enters through the oral and nasal cavities, and travels through the larynx, trachea and bronchi, and expands the alveoli. Relaxing the diaphragm has the opposite effect, decreasing {{the volume of the}} lung cavity, causing air to be pushed out of the lungs. During exercise, the abdominal wall contracts, increasing pressure on the diaphragm, which forces air out quicker and more forcefully. The rib cage is able to expand and contract the chest cavity through the action of other respiratory muscles. Consequently, air is sucked into or expelled out of the lungs, always moving down its pressure gradient. This type of lung is known as a bellows lung due to its resemblance to blacksmith bellows.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the body}} {{requires}} oxygen for metabolism, low oxygen levels normally do not stimulate breathing. Rather, <b>breathing</b> <b>is</b> stimulated by higher carbon dioxide levels.|$|E

25|$|Buddy <b>breathing</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the}} few scuba {{skills in}} which the {{incompetence}} of one diver can threaten the life of another. Poor buddy breathing performance has resulted in the death of both divers on more than one occasion.|$|E
25|$|Wet breathing: Wet <b>breathing</b> <b>is</b> {{caused by}} water {{getting into the}} {{regulator}} and compromising breathing comfort and safety. Water can leak into the second stage body through damaged soft parts like torn mouthpieces, damaged exhaust valves and perforated diaphragms, through cracked housings, or through poorly sealing or fouled exhaust valves.|$|E
25|$|Irregular respirations {{occur when}} injury {{to parts of}} the brain {{interfere}} with the respiratory drive. Biot's respiration, in which <b>breathing</b> <b>is</b> rapid for a period and then absent for a period, occurs because of injury to the cerebral hemispheres or diencephalon. Hyperventilation can occur when the brain stem or tegmentum is damaged.|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{examined the}} influence of cognitive-linguistic processing demands on speech <b>breathing.</b> Twenty women <b>were</b> studied during performance of two speaking activities designed to differ in cognitive-linguistic planning requirements. Speech <b>breathing</b> <b>was</b> monitored with respiratory magnetometers from which recordings were made of anteroposterior diameter changes of the rib cage and abdomen. Results indicated that speech <b>breathing</b> <b>was</b> highly similar across speaking conditions, with the exception that the average lung volume expended per syllable was greater during performance of the more demanding speaking activity. Further analyses suggested that greater lung volume expenditures were associated with longer expiratory pause times. In conclusion, it appears that general speech <b>breathing</b> performance <b>is</b> essentially unaffected by variations in cognitive-linguistic demands, however, certain fluency-related <b>breathing</b> behaviors <b>are</b> highly sensitive to such demands...|$|R

25|$|Buddy <b>breathing</b> <b>is</b> {{discouraged}} by many training agencies because other more reliable techniques and equipment exist. The technique needs training and regular practice by both divers {{if it is}} to be used successfully in a crisis; panic and task loading being the main reasons for it failing. Especially in situations in which one or both of the participants are not well-trained in the technique, the procedure has been criticised for endangering two people instead of one.|$|E
25|$|Infection can be {{prevented}} by proper immunization with the tetanus vaccine. In {{those who have a}} significant wound and less than three doses of the vaccine, both immunization and tetanus immune globulin are recommended. The wound should be cleaned and any dead tissue should be removed. In those who are infected tetanus immune globulin or, if it is not available, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is used. Muscle relaxants may be used to control spasms. Mechanical ventilation may be required if a person's <b>breathing</b> <b>is</b> affected.|$|E
25|$|Premature infants {{are those}} born at 37 weeks or less gestational stage. They {{are subject to}} {{numerous}} health risks, such as abnormal breathing patterns, decreased body fat and muscle tissue, as well as feeding issues. The coordination for sucking and <b>breathing</b> <b>is</b> often not fully developed, making feeding a challenge. The improved developmental activity and behavioural status of premature infants when they are discharged from the NICU, {{is directly related to}} the stimulation programs and interventions they benefited from during hospitalization, such as music therapy.|$|E

25|$|Inflammation of the {{epiglottis}} {{is known}} as epiglottitis. Epiglottitis is mainly caused by Haemophilus influenzae. A person with epiglottitis may have a fever, sore throat, difficulty swallowing, and difficulty breathing. For this reason, acute epiglottitis is considered a medical emergency, {{because of the risk}} of obstruction of the pharynx. Epiglottitis is often managed with antibiotics, racemic epinephrine (a sympathomimetic bronchodilator that is delivered by aerosol), and may require tracheal intubation or a tracheostomy if <b>breathing</b> <b>is</b> difficult. Behind the root of the tongue is an epiglottic vallecula which is an important anatomical landmark in intubation.|$|E
25|$|A {{pattern of}} two breaths per diver should be {{established}} {{as soon as possible}} and then terminate the dive and start the ascent as soon as possible, as air consumption while buddy <b>breathing</b> <b>is</b> usually more than double the normal rate. Most demand valves will only drain correctly if the hose is to the user's right, and in these cases the divers should align themselves to allow convenient movement of the demand valve from donor to recipient and back. When the divers need to ascend or swim horizontally, it requires co-ordination and some skill, which is best practiced in a low hazard environment.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} {{technique for}} buddy <b>breathing</b> <b>is</b> for the divers to alternately breathe from the demand valve, usually each taking two breaths before exchanging the DV, {{but it is}} common for the receiver to be out of breath {{at the start of the}} procedure, and they may need a few more breaths to stabilize. Once a rhythm has been established, it is usual to terminate the dive and start the ascent, so buddy breathing training will usually include assisted ascents. Assisted ascents using a secondary demand valve are simpler than buddy breathing ascents, and this skill is quicker to learn.|$|E

25|$|Organ donors may {{be living}} or may {{have died of}} brain death or circulatory death. Most {{deceased}} donors {{are those who have}} been pronounced brain dead. Brain dead means the cessation of brain function, typically after receiving an injury (either traumatic or pathological) to the brain, or otherwise cutting off blood circulation to the brain (drowning, suffocation, etc.). <b>Breathing</b> <b>is</b> maintained via artificial sources, which, in turn, maintains heartbeat. Once brain death has been declared the person can be considered for organ donation. Criteria for brain death vary. Because less than 3% of all deaths in the U.S. are the result of brain death, the overwhelming majority of deaths are ineligible for organ donation, resulting in severe shortages.|$|E
25|$|Effective {{use of any}} {{alternate}} {{air source}} requires competence in the associated skill set. The procedures for receiving air from another diver or from one's own equipment are most effective and least {{likely to result in}} a life-threatening incident if well trained {{to the extent that they}} do not distract the diver from other essential matters. A major difference from buddy <b>breathing</b> <b>is</b> that the diver using a redundant alternative air source need not alternate breathing with the donor, which can be a substantial advantage in many circumstances. There is a further significant advantage when the alternate air source is carried by the diver using it, in that it is not necessary to locate the buddy before it is available, but this comes at the cost of extra equipment.|$|E
25|$|Prevention of snake bites {{can involve}} wearing {{protective}} footwear, avoiding areas where snakes live, and not handling snakes. Treatment partly {{depends on the}} type of snake. Washing the wound with soap and water and holding the limb still is recommended. Trying to suck out the venom, cutting the wound with a knife, or using a tourniquet is not recommended. Antivenom is effective at preventing death from bites; however, antivenoms frequently have side effects. The type of antivenom needed depends {{on the type of}} snake involved. When the type of snake is unknown, antivenom is often given based on the types known to be in the area. In some areas of the world getting the right type of antivenom is difficult and this partly contributes to why they sometimes do not work. An additional issue is the cost of these medications. Antivenom has little effect on the area around the bite itself. Supporting the person's <b>breathing</b> <b>is</b> sometimes also required.|$|E
