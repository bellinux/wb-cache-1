5|$|Bush was {{appointed}} to the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) in 1938, and soon became its chairman. As chairman of the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), and later director of OSRD, Bush coordinated the activities of some six thousand leading American scientists in the application of science to warfare. Bush was a well-known policymaker and public intellectual during World War II, when he was in effect the first presidential science advisor. As head of NDRC and OSRD, he initiated the Manhattan Project, and ensured that it received top priority from the highest levels of government. In Science, The Endless Frontier, his 1945 report to the President of the United States, <b>Bush</b> <b>called</b> for an expansion of government support for science, and he pressed for the creation of the National Science Foundation.|$|E
25|$|Internationally, Dzurinda is {{perceived}} as a successful and progressive politician, mostly due to the internationally acclaimed economic reforms his government implemented during Dzurinda's second government (2002-2006).

25|$|In April 1999, former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher {{and former}} US President George H. W. <b>Bush</b> <b>called</b> upon the British {{government}} to release Pinochet. They urged that Pinochet {{be allowed to}} return to his homeland rather than be forced to go to Spain. On the other hand, United Nations High Commissioner of Human Rights, Mary Robinson, hailed the Lords' ruling, declaring that it was a clear endorsement that torture is an international crime subject to universal jurisdiction. Furthermore, Amnesty International and the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture demanded his extradition to Spain. Finally, in protest against Spain's action, Chile withdrew for a time its ambassador from Madrid.|$|E
25|$|In May 1989, {{during the}} Panamanian {{national}} elections, {{an alliance of}} parties opposed to the Noriega dictatorship counted results from the country's election precincts, before they {{were sent to the}} district centers. Their tally showed their candidate, Guillermo Endara, defeating Carlos Duque, candidate of a pro-Noriega coalition, by nearly 3–1. Endara was beaten up by Noriega supporters the next day in his motorcade. Noriega declared the election null and maintained power by force, making him unpopular among Panamanians. Noriega's government insisted that it had won the presidential election and that irregularities had been on the part of U.S.-backed candidates from opposition parties. <b>Bush</b> <b>called</b> on Noriega to honor the will of the Panamanian people. The United States reinforced its Canal Zone garrison, and increased the tempo of training and other activities intended to put pressure on Noriega.|$|E
25|$|In time, {{a number}} of {{prominent}} members of Congress began to oppose the program's expansion, including later Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry, who cast votes against the B-2 in 1989, 1991 and 1992 while a U.S. Senator, representing Massachusetts. By 1992, Republican President George H.W. <b>Bush</b> <b>called</b> for the cancellation of the B-2 and promised to cut military spending by 30% {{in the wake of}} the collapse of the Soviet Union. In October 1995, former Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force, General Mike Ryan, and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General John Shalikashvili, strongly recommended against Congressional action to fund the purchase of any additional B-2s, arguing that to do so would require unacceptable cuts in existing conventional and nuclear-capable aircraft, and that the military had greater priorities in spending a limited budget.|$|E

25|$|The {{components}} {{are still being}} studied and are not determined with absolute certainty. Stacte is variously described as being the extract of the transparent portion of the myrrh resin which exudes spontaneously from the tree, or a balsam from a tree such as opobalsamum or a styrax. Onycha, which in Greek means “nail,” is variously described as being the operculum from a shell found in the Red Sea (which are said to resemble a fingernail), the exudation from the rock rose <b>bush</b> <b>called</b> labdanum (both petals and markings which are said to resemble a fingernail), Styrax benzoin, bdellium, or even cloves. Galbanum is {{generally considered to be}} Ferula galbaniflua. Also considered is a milder variety from the Levant or possibly even a close relative of Ferula galbaniflua called narthex (or giant fennel). Pure frankincense is the resin of a tree of the boswellia species.|$|E
25|$|On 2 August 1990, Saddam {{launched}} a military invasion onto neighboring Kuwait, reportedly {{due to its}} vast oil reserves, which would have helped him pay off the debts he owed to other countries during the Iran–Iraq War (see Gulf War). Within 24 hours, the Emir of Kuwait had fled. However, subsequently, an international coalition force consisting of American, British, Saudi and other troops liberated the country in 1991 and Iraqi troops were forced out of Kuwait (see Operation Desert Storm). Subsequently, {{one month after the}} Gulf War in February 1991, United States President George H. W. <b>Bush</b> <b>called</b> on the Iraqi people to stage an uprising against Saddam Hussein. This was followed by a series of rebellions {{in many parts of the}} country, such as the south by Shi'ite groups such as SCIRI and the Islamic Da'awa Party. Meanwhile, the Kurds in the north staged their own uprising for autonomy, under the leadership of Massoud Barzani, leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, and Jalal Talabani, leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. The Peshmerga were trained into hardened guerrillas, who managed to infiltrate the Jash, a Saddam-orientated Kurdish militia (see Jash (term) and National Defense Battalions (Iraq)). The rebels soon managed to capture the town of Ranya, Sulaimaniya and ultimately the oil center of Kirkuk. Saddam retaliated swiftly, battering Kirkuk with artillery and targeting hospitals in particular. Geographically the towns captured by the Kurdish rebels were difficult to defend as they sat on plains below mountains. The rebels were forced to retreat in the mountains, where reportedly the Iraqi helicopters threw flour of them (which was believed to be a grim legacy of the reputed powdery chemical weapons which were used by the Iraqi administration during the Al-Anfal Campaign).|$|E

500|$|Polls {{conducted}} in 2006 showed {{an average of}} 37percent approval ratings for Bush, the lowest for any second-term president at that point of his term since Harry S. Truman in March 1951 (when Truman's approval rating was 28percent), which contributed to what <b>Bush</b> <b>called</b> the [...] "thumping" [...] of the Republican Party in the 2006 mid-term elections. Throughout most of 2007, Bush's approval rating hovered in the mid-thirties; the average for his entire second term was 37percent, according to Gallup.|$|E

Kemp is also remembered alongside George Wallace and William Jennings Bryan for influencing history by changing the direction of presidential elections despite their defeats.|$|E
500|$|Contemporary reviews were mixed. Moving Picture World {{film critic}} W. Stephen <b>Bush</b> <b>called</b> the film [...] "first-class" [...] despite {{problems}} with the plot, cinematography, and the [...] "unbelievably poor" [...] music accompaniment at the Academy of Music. He also remarked on the censorship of the novel's plot, stating that [...] "not even the sternest of moralists can find anything objectionable" [...] in the film. Fox's response was published the following week, in which he praised Bush's review and committed to avoiding [...] "the salacious or the sex drama". Peter Milne of Motion Picture News also praised the decision to make a [...] "clean" [...] adaptation of the novel, {{as well as the}} film's realism. However, Variety gave the film a negative review that criticized its editing, its direction, and Whitney's acting ability, suggesting that the film would profit solely on the name of the book it adapted.|$|E

Bush made a speech during his re-election campaign where he said, [...] "We are going to keep on trying to strengthen the American family, to make American families a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons." [...] The writers decided that they wanted to respond by adding a response to the next broadcast of The Simpsons, which was a rerun of [...] "Stark Raving Dad" [...] on January 30. The broadcast included a new tongue-in-cheek opening where they watch Bush's speech. Bart replies, [...] "Hey, we're just like the Waltons. We're praying {{for an end to the}} Depression, too". The criticism eventually led to the idea for the episode [...] "Two Bad Neighbors", which has George and Barbara move into the house across the street from the Simpsons.|$|E
