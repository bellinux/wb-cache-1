5000|$|<b>Boil-off</b> of {{cryogenic}} propellants {{in space}} may be mitigated by both technological solutions {{as well as}} system-level planning and design.From a technical perspective: for a propellant depot with passive insulation system to effectively store cryogenic fluids, <b>boil-off</b> caused by heating from solar and other sources must be mitigated, eliminated, or used for economic purposes.

50|$|In {{addition}} to technical {{solutions to the}} challenge of excessive <b>boil-off</b> of cryogenic rocket propellants, system-level solutions have been proposed. From a systems perspective, reductions in the standby time of the LH2 cryogenic storage in order to achieve, effectively, a just in time (JIT) delivery to each customer, matched with the balanced refinery technology to split the long-term storable feedstock—water—into the stoichiometric LOX/LH2 necessary, is theoretically capable of achieving a system-level solution to <b>boil-off.</b> Such proposals have been suggested as supplementing good technological techniques to reduce <b>boil-off,</b> but would not replace the need for efficient technological storage solutions.|$|E

50|$|The {{natural gas}} that fuels dual fuel engines {{is carried on}} ships as a boiling liquid, and transported at {{slightly}} higher than atmospheric pressure. When tank insulation is penetrated by any influx in heat, it will cause {{the temperature of the}} liquefied natural gas to rise, which allows for vaporization from liquid to gas. When heat penetrates the tank, the tank’s pressure increases due to <b>boil-off.</b> The insulation of the tanks is designed with the most advanced technology. Even still, the insulation of the tanks is penetrated by heat. The <b>boil-off</b> occurs during the ships voyage. During a storm, the LNG cargo moves and sloshes around in the tanks. The <b>boil-off</b> gas represents 0.1% - 0.25% of the ships capacity per day. Tanks need to be maintained at a steady pressure. If the pressure in tanks is not controlled relief or safety valves are forced to open, venting the <b>boil-off</b> into the atmosphere until pressure is relieved. At this point, it has been proven that on board LNG re-liquefaction is uneconomical for most ships. Instead, the gas produced by this <b>boil-off</b> effect is routed to the ship’s propulsion system and used as fuel for power plants such as steam boilers and dual fuel marine diesel engines. This reduces the use of bunker fuel, reducing fuel costs and equipment maintenance costs.|$|E

5000|$|A marine LNG {{engine is}} a {{dual fuel engine}} that uses natural gas and bunker fuel to convert {{chemical}} energy in to mechanical energy. Due to natural gas’ cleaner burning properties, the use of natural gas in merchant ship propulsion plants is becoming an option for companies in order to comply with IMO and MARPOL environmental regulations. The natural gas is stored in liquid state (LNG) and the <b>boil-off</b> gas is routed to and burned in dual fuel engines. [...] Shipping companies have been cautious when choosing a propulsion system for their fleets. The steam turbine system has been the main choice as the prime mover on LNG carriers {{over the last several}} decades. The decades old system on steam propelled LNG carriers uses BOG (<b>boil-off</b> gas). LNG carriers are heavily insulated to keep the LNG at around -160 °C - to keep it liquefied. What happens is that even with all the insulation, the LNG containment area is penetrated by heat which allows for naturally generated <b>boil-off</b> gas (BOG).|$|E
50|$|Eye {{protection}} is required {{at all times}} when working with cryogenic fluids. When pouring a cryogen, working with a wide-mouth Dewar flask or around the exhaust of cold <b>boil-off</b> gas, use of a full face shield is recommended.|$|E

50|$|Ablative armor {{frequently}} {{appears in}} the Star Trek universe. It {{was introduced in the}} Star Trek world in the year 2371. The USS Defiant was equipped with ablative armor in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. The Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Technical Manual explains that it works in two stages: when the shields are hit by an energy or particle weapon, phaser or thermal energy from the ship is dissipated across the hull. This creates a <b>boil-off</b> rate that carries away most of the incoming beam's energy. Most of the time the <b>boil-off</b> creates a particle cloud that is dense enough to disperse the incoming beam. The USS Prometheus from Star Trek: Voyager was also equipped with ablative hull armor.|$|E
50|$|Cryogenic {{propellants}} (liquid oxygen oxidizer, {{and liquid}} hydrogen fuel) {{need to be}} continuously topped off (i.e., <b>boil-off</b> replaced) during the launch sequence (countdown), as the vehicle awaits liftoff. This becomes particularly important as complex sequences may be interrupted by planned or unplanned holds to fix problems.|$|E
50|$|Maximum boil-off/minimum oil:- In {{this mode}} the tank {{pressures}} are kept low {{and you have}} a greater <b>boil-off</b> but still there is a large amount of fuel oil used. This decreases the amount of LNG delivered but the cargo will be delivered cold which many ports prefer.|$|E
5000|$|Even at a destination, the SEP {{system can}} be {{configured}} to provide power to maintain the systems or prevent propellant <b>boil-off</b> before the crew arrives. [...] However, existing flight-qualified solar-electric propulsion is at levels of 1-5 kW. A Mars cargo mission would require ~100 kW, and a crewed flight ~150-300 kW.|$|E
50|$|Before the 2009 races, {{the wing}} root mounted oil coolers were {{replaced}} with a <b>boil-off</b> oil cooling system. As a result, the outer half of both wing root inlets were closed off.

50|$|Overall, it is {{estimated}} that Q-Max carriers have about 40% lower energy requirements and carbon emissions than conventional LNG carriers. The quoted estimates do however ignore the additional fuel used to re-liquify boil off gas rather than burn the gas for fuel. The ships can be converted to use the <b>boil-off</b> gas but as of February 2013 none have yet been converted.|$|E
50|$|The {{two common}} types of LNG {{carriers}} are Moss and Membrane. Moss type carriers feature spherical tanks to hold LNG, while Membrane style carriers feature more traditional rectangular style tanks with a stainless-steel membrane. Membrane tankers {{are more common}} because they are smaller than moss ships {{for the same amount}} of LNG fuel carried, but they create more <b>boil-off</b> gas than Moss style ships.|$|E
50|$|Heavy lift advocates {{state that}} the total mass to orbit {{required}} for a mission can actually increase {{because of the need}} to launch more propellant tanks and <b>boil-off</b> mitigation hardware. Heavy launch vehicles are not developed, so these costs are added to the trade, rather than using existing smaller rockets. Heavy lift advocates question the cost model for propellant depots and cite the need for development and demonstration.|$|E
50|$|Grignard {{reagents}} {{are notorious}} for having induction periods. This is usually due to two reasons: Firstly, the thin film of oxide on the magnesium reagent must be removed before the bulk magnesium can react. Secondly, Grignard reactions, while exothermic, are typically conducted at low temperature for better selectivity. For these two reasons, Grignard reactions often can have a long induction period, followed by a thermal runaway, even causing the reaction solvent to <b>boil-off.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{disadvantage}} of LH2/LOX engines is the low density and low temperature of liquid hydrogen, which means bigger and insulated and thus heavier fuel tanks are needed. This increases the rocket's structural mass which reduces its delta-v significantly. Another disadvantage is the poor storability of LH2/LOX-powered rockets: Due {{to the constant}} hydrogen <b>boil-off,</b> the rocket can only be fueled shortly before launch, which makes cryogenic engines unsuitable for ICBMs and other rocket applications {{with the need for}} short launch preparations.|$|E

The integrity of both membranes is permanently monitored by detection of hydrocarbon in the nitrogen. An evolution is proposed by NG2, with the replacement of nitrogen by argon as the flushed inert and insulation gas. Argon has a better insulation power than nitrogen, which could save 10% of <b>boil-off</b> gas.|$|E
50|$|Bath cryostats {{are similar}} in {{construction}} to vacuum flasks filled with liquid helium. A coldplate is placed in thermal contact with the liquid helium bath. The liquid helium may be replenished as it boils away, at intervals between a few hours and several months, depending on the volume and construction of the cryostat. The <b>boil-off</b> rate is minimised by shielding the bath with either cold helium vapour, or vacuum shield with walls constructed from so-called super insulator material. The helium vapour which boils away from the bath very effectively cools thermal shields around {{the outside of the}} bath. In the older designs there may be additional liquid nitrogen bath, or several concentric layers of shielding, with gradually increasing temperatures. However, the invention of super insulator materials has made this technology obsolete.|$|E
50|$|In 1980 British Gas {{constructed}} a LNG peak-shaving facility {{on the south}} west of the refinery site. The facility was used to support the NTS at times of high demand, and to ensure security of gas supplies in SE England. During periods of high demand liquefied gas was pumped from storage tanks and heated in vapourisers to a gaseous state for delivery into the NTS. There are four tanks each of 50,000 m3 (total storage capacity of 200,000 m3), constructed of 9% nickel-steel alloy insulated with perlite, each with a containment bund to half the tank height. At times of low demand gas could be withdrawn from the NTS and liquefied by cryogenic cooling to minus 162°C to replenish the storage tanks. An adjacent gas holder received gaseous <b>boil-off</b> from the tanks.|$|E

50|$|The {{higher cost}} of {{turbines}} {{and the associated}} gears or generator/motor sets is offset by lower maintenance requirements and the smaller size of a turbine when compared to a reciprocating engine having an equivalent power, although the fuel costs are higher than a diesel engine because steam turbines have lower thermal efficiency. To reduce fuel costs the thermal efficiency of both types of engine have been improved over the years. Today, propulsion steam turbine cycle efficiencies have yet to break 50%, yet diesel engines routinely exceed 50%, especially in marine applications. Diesel power plants also have lower operating costs since fewer operators are required. Thus, conventional steam power is used in very few new ships. An exception is LNG carriers which often find it more economical to use <b>boil-off</b> gas with a steam turbine than to re-liquify it.|$|E

50|$|A {{simplified}} {{diagram of}} the key elements of an SRF cavity setup is shown below. The cavity is immersed in a saturated liquid helium bath. Pumping removes helium vapor <b>boil-off</b> and controls the bath temperature. The helium vessel is often pumped to a pressure below helium's superfluid lambda point {{to take advantage of}} the superfluid's thermal properties. Because superfluid has very high thermal conductivity, it makes an excellent coolant. In addition, superfluids boil only at free surfaces, preventing the formation of bubbles on the surface of the cavity, which would cause mechanical perturbations. An antenna is needed in the setup to couple RF power to the cavity fields and, in turn, any passing particle beam. The cold portions of the setup need to be extremely well insulated, which is best accomplished by a vacuum vessel surrounding the helium vessel and all ancillary cold components. The full SRF cavity containment system, including the vacuum vessel and many details not discussed here, is a cryomodule.|$|E
5000|$|Cryostats used in MRI {{machines}} {{are designed to}} hold a cryogen, typically helium, in a liquid state with minimal evaporation (<b>boil-off).</b> The liquid helium bath is designed to keep the superconducting magnet's bobbin of superconductive wire in its superconductive state. In this state the wire has no electrical resistance and very large currents are maintained with a low power input. To maintain superconductivity, the bobbin must be kept below its transition temperature by being immersed in the liquid helium. If, for any reason, the wire becomes resistive, i.e. loses superconductivity, a condition known as a [...] "quench", the liquid helium evaporates, instantly raising pressure within the vessel. A burst disk, usually made of carbon, is placed within the chimney or vent pipe so that during a pressure excursion, the gaseous helium can be safely vented out of the MRI suite. Modern MRI cryostats use a mechanical refrigerator (cryocooler) to re-condense the helium gas {{and return it to}} the bath, to maintain cryogenic conditions and to conserve helium.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Simple Depot" [...] {{mission was}} {{proposed}} by NASA in 2011 {{as a potential}} first PTSD mission, with launch no earlier than 2015, on an Atlas V 551. Simple Depot would utilize the [...] "used" [...] (nearly-emptied) Centaur upper stage LH2 tank for long-term storage of LO2 while LH2 will be stored in the Simple Depot LH2 module, which is launched with only ambient-temperature gaseous Helium in it. The SD LH2 tank was to be 3 m diameter and 16 m long, [...] in volume, and store 5 mT of LH2. [...] "At a useful mixture ratio (MR) of 6:1 this quantity of LH2 can be paired with 25.7 mT of LO2, allowing for 0.7 mT of LH2 {{to be used for}} vapor cooling, for a total useful propellant mass of 30 mT. ... the described depot will have a <b>boil-off</b> rate of approaching 0.1 percent per day, consisting entirely of hydrogen." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{program had}} {{technical}} achievements as well, such as developing high-strength fibers, and carbide coatings for Carbon-Carbon composites. The hot-section design evolved {{to use all}} Carbon-Carbon to maximize turbine inlet temperature and minimize weight. Carbon-Carbon has much lower nuclear heating than other candidate materials, so thermal stresses were minimized as well. Prototype turbine components employing a 2-D polar reinforcement weave were fabricated {{for use in the}} corrosive, high-temperature hydrogen environment found in the proposed particle bed reactor (PBR)-powered engine. The particle bed reactor concept required significant radiation shielding, not only for the payload, electronics and structure of the vehicle, but also to prevent unacceptable <b>boil-off</b> of the cryogenic propellant. A propellant-cooled, composite shield of Tungsten, which attenuates gamma rays and absorbs thermal neutrons, and Lithium Hydride, which has a large scattering cross section for fast and thermal neutrons was found to perform well with low mass compared to older Boron Aluminum Titanium Hydride (BATH) shields.|$|E
