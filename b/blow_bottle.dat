40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesPurpose: Cardio-respiratory {{physiotherapy}} {{for patients}} undergoing abdominal surgery {{has been found}} to be beneficial in improving lung function post-operatively and in the prevention and treatment of post-operative pulmonary complications (PPCs). The <b>Blow</b> <b>Bottle,</b> a Positive Expiratory Pressure (PEP) therapy device, is commonly used as an adjunct to physiotherapy. The <b>Blow</b> <b>Bottle</b> is low cost and can be easily made by the physiotherapist using readily available materials in the hospital setting. However, evidence to support the use of Blow Bottles in the post-operative management of abdominal surgery is minimal, with few studies reporting significant positive effects especially when compared to conventional cardio-respiratory physiotherapy techniques. Methodology: A randomized control was implemented in a public tertiary institution within the Western Cape. Patients admitted for open abdominal surgery via midline incision were eligible for the trial. Participants were randomly allocated to either the control group (CG) receiving conventional post-operative cardio-respiratory physiotherapy, or the intervention group (IG) who received the additional use of the <b>Blow</b> <b>Bottle.</b> Lung function and the development of post-operative pulmonary complications were the primary outcome s of this study. Lung Function was evaluated by means of spirometry testing and interpretation of Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV 1) and Forced Vital Capacity (FVC). The development of post-operative pulmonary complications were diagnosed using the criteria by Mackay et al. (2005) where changes from pre-operative findings of auscultation; temperature, X-ray and sputum are evaluated post-operatively and recorded using the Adapted Abdominal Physiotherapy Outcomes Data Sheet (A-APODS). Results: A total of 19 participants were enrolled in the study, n= 11 (CG) and n= 8 (IG), predominantly female (n= 14) and admitted for cancer related abdominal surgery (n= 9). There was a statistically significant (p< 0. 05) marked reduction in post-operative lung function from baseline across groups, 62 % in FEV 1 and 47 % in FVC on the first post-operative day. The FEV 1 and FVC were similar across both the control and intervention groups for the first three post-operative days. On auscultation majority of participants had decreased breath sounds on the first post-operative day. However, no one participant developed a PPC across the duration of the study as diagnosed using the criteria by Mackay et al. (2005). Conclusion: Whether the additional use of the <b>Blow</b> <b>Bottle</b> is more beneficial than conventional post-operative cardio-physiotherapy alone is inconclusive due to the incremental drop out of participants from the study and small sample size. In this study there was however a significant reduction in lung function post-operatively. This mandates the need for further research investigating the abdominal surgical field and the use of devices to improve lung function, such as the <b>Blow</b> <b>Bottle,</b> as literature is scant and outdated, and sorely lacking in the resource constraint South African hospital settings...|$|E
40|$|Deep {{breathing}} exercises {{are widely used}} in the postoperative care to prevent or reduce pulmonary complications, but no scientific evidence for the efficacy has been found after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. The aim of the thesis was to describe postoperative pulmonary function and to evaluate the efficacy of deep {{breathing exercises}} performed {{with or without a}} <b>blow</b> <b>bottle</b> device for positive expiratory pressure (PEP) 10 cmH 2 O or an inspiratory resistance-positive expiratory pressure (IR-PEP) mask with an inspiratory pressure of - 5 cmH 2 O and an expiratory pressure of + 10 to + 15 cmH 2 O. Patients undergoing CABG were instructed to perform 30 slow deep breaths hourly during daytime for the first four postoperative days. Patient management was similar in the groups, except for the different breathing techniques. Measurements were performed preoperatively, on the fourth postoperative day and four months after surgery. The immediate effect of the deep breathing exercises was examined on the second postoperative day. Pulmonary function was assessed by spirometry, diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide and arterial blood gases. Atelectasis was determined by chest roentgenograms or spiral computed tomography (CT). Lung volumes were markedly reduced on the fourth postoperative day. Four months after surgery the pulmonary function was still significantly reduced. On the second and fourth postoperative day all patients had atelectasis visible on CT. A single session of deep breathing exercises performed with or without a mechanical device caused a significant reduction in atelectasis and an improvement in oxygenation. No major differences between deep breathing performed with or without a <b>blow</b> <b>bottle</b> or IR-PEP-device were found, except for a lesser decrease in total lung capacity in the <b>blow</b> <b>bottle</b> group on the fourth postoperative day. Patients who performed deep breathing exercises after CABG had significantly smaller atelectasis and better pulmonary function on the fourth postoperative day compared to a control group who performed no exercises...|$|E

Some of the glass tubes recovered are fire-closed at one end and are partially inflated by blowing through the open end while still hot to form a small bottle; thus they are considered as a rudimentary form of blowpipe.|$|R
5000|$|Methods {{used for}} {{pulmonary}} hygiene include suctioning of the airways, chest physiotherapy, <b>blow</b> <b>bottles,</b> and nasotracheal suction. [...] Bronchoscopy, {{in which a}} tube is inserted into the airways so that an examiner can view them, can be used therapeutically as part of pulmonary hygiene. Incentive spirometry and use of analgesics (pain medications) that do not inhibit breathing are also parts of pulmonary toilet. [...] Coughing is also important for ridding the airways of secretions, so healthcare providers are careful not to oversedate patients, because that could inhibit coughing. [...] Tracheotomy facilitates pulmonary toilet. Percussion, another method, loosens secretions and allows the cilia of the airways to remove material. Positioning is another method for promoting drainage of secretions; sometimes patients are placed in a prone position to aid in this purpose.|$|R

The machine {{will be used for}} the production of plastic bottles suitable for bottling brewed beer at the microbrewery at Massey University Palmerston North. Premanufactured PET preforms have proven to be the most convenient and promising choice for the fabrication of <b>blown</b> <b>bottles.</b> Basic tests to understand the behaviour of the preforms and the challenges of the blowing process have been carried out. A special focus has been placed on the different circumstances at University in contrast to industrial bottle production in particular the needed air pressure to form the bottles. The following step was to find the ideal method and principle to handle the preforms and to transform them in the desired shape. Finally the design, drawing of the parts and assemblies were carried out with the 3 -D CAD software Solidworks. The designed parts for the bottle blower have been manufactured at the mechanical Workshop at Massey University. To control the bottle blower, the National Instruments USB interface was selected which required the design and manufacture of an additional driver interface card to protect the USB interface and convert the TTL levels into higher voltage. The final assembly and testing of the blower then concluded the practical work for this master project. A suitable design for the bottle production was found and the assembled Bottle Blower can now be used for the production of PET bottles...|$|R
