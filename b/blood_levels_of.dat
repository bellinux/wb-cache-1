5|$|Aspirin {{and other}} NSAIDs can cause {{abnormally}} high <b>blood</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> potassium by inducing a hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronic state via inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis; however, these agents do not typically cause hyperkalemia by {{themselves in the}} setting of normal renal function and euvolemic state.|$|E
5|$|There is an {{association}} between the <b>blood</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> homocysteine and thrombosis, although {{this has not been}} reported consistently in all studies. Homocysteine levels are determined by mutations in the MTHFR and CBS genes, but also by levels of folic acid, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12, which depend on diet.|$|E

40|$|Thirty-five {{hypertensive}} {{patients were}} treated with atenolol in weekly increasing doses (25, 50, 100, and 200 mg thrice daily). Factors determining the <b>blood</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> the drug were studied along with the relationship between <b>blood</b> <b>level,</b> the degree <b>of</b> cardiac beta blockade, and the antihypertensive effect of the drug. The <b>blood</b> <b>level</b> obtained varied with the daily dose, the time of blood sampling during the day, the body weight, and the creatinine clearance. The degree of beta blockade was assessed by measuring maximum-exercise tachycardia and was correlated with the <b>blood</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> atenolol.

5|$|Molybdenum {{deficiency}} {{has also}} been reported {{as a consequence of}} non-molybdenum supplemented total parenteral nutrition (complete intravenous feeding) for long periods of time. It results in high <b>blood</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> sulfite and urate, {{in much the same way}} as molybdenum cofactor deficiency. However (presumably since pure molybdenum deficiency from this cause occurs primarily in adults), the neurological consequences are not as marked as in cases of congenital cofactor deficiency.|$|E
5|$|Nephrotic syndrome, {{in which}} protein from the {{bloodstream}} is {{released into the}} urine due to kidney diseases, can predispose to thrombosis; this is particularly the case in more severe cases (as indicated by <b>blood</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> albumin below 25g/l) and if the syndrome {{is caused by the}} condition membranous nephropathy.

40|$|An {{intestinal}} {{absorption test}} {{with the use}} of D-xylose has been performed on 19 patients including 3 of acute hepatitis, 7 of chronic hepatitis and 9 of liver cirrhosis, and the following results were obtained. 1) The 5 hr urinary excretion and 2 hr <b>blood</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> D-xylose tend to increase in patients of acute and chronic hepatitis with severer disorder of liver functions. 2) The standard deviations of the 5 hr urinary excretion and 2 hr <b>blood</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> D-xylose are larger in liver cirrhosis than in the other liver diseases. Those cases having severe disorder of liver functions are found to be diminished in 5 hr urinary excretion and 2 hr <b>blood</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> D-xylose. 3) A decrease in the absorption of D-xylose from the small intestine of liver cirrhosis might be caused by the diminished surface area of villi of the small intestine. </p...|$|R
40|$|The <b>blood</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> Vitamin B(1) in 80 {{cases of}} various {{dermatologic}} disorders was defermined with thiochrome method using permutit and considering {{the value of}} the healthy individuals and the results of other investigators, the minimum limit was established on 6. 0 γ% and the following results were obtained: 1) In 17 cases of healthy individuals, the average <b>of</b> the <b>blood</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> total Vit.

B(1) decreased in cases in which excessive exsudation could be seen, pemphigus, Domian enanthem and pellagra showed obvious deficiency of Vit. B(1). Moreover, in most of the cases of erythematodes and psoriasis vulgaris showed Vit. B(1) deficiency, but in acne vulgaris, alopecia arezta, chloasma and erythema induratum Bazin showed normal value. 4) Vit. B(1) takes part in the metabolism with close relation with the functions of many organs, as well as with other Vitamins and endocrine system; so the variation <b>of</b> the <b>blood</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> Vit.

5|$|Lactate uptake by {{the liver}} is diminished with {{metformin}} administration because lactate is a substrate for hepatic gluconeogenesis, {{a process that}} metformin inhibits. In healthy individuals, this slight excess is cleared by other mechanisms (including uptake by unimpaired kidneys), and no significant elevation in <b>blood</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> lactate occurs. Given impaired kidney function, clearance of metformin and lactate is reduced, increasing levels of both, and possibly causing lactic acid buildup. Because metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate, any condition that may precipitate lactic acidosis is a contraindication. Common causes include alcoholism (due to depletion of NAD+ stores), heart failure and respiratory disease (due to inadequate tissue oxygenation); {{the most common cause}} is kidney disease.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people with}} obesity hypoventilation {{syndrome}} have concurrent obstructive sleep apnea, a condition characterized by snoring, brief episodes of apnea (cessation of breathing) during the night, interrupted sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness. In OHS, sleepiness may be worsened by elevated <b>blood</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> carbon dioxide, which causes drowsiness ("CO2 narcosis"). Other symptoms present in both conditions are depression, and hypertension (high blood pressure) {{that is difficult}} to control with medication. The high carbon dioxide can also cause headaches, which tend to be worsening in the morning.|$|E
5|$|On 19 April 2009, 21 polo ponies died {{shortly before}} a match in the United States Polo Open.

5|$|Protease inhibitors, nefazodone, sertraline, grapefruit, fluoxetine, erythromycin, diltiazem, {{clarithromycin}} {{inhibit the}} metabolism of midazolam, {{leading to a}} prolonged action. St John's wort, rifapentine, rifampin, rifabutin, phenytoin enhance the metabolism of midazolam leading to a reduced action. Sedating antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs such as phenobarbital, phenytoin and carbamazepine, sedative antihistamines, opioids, antipsychotics and alcohol enhance the sedative effects of midazolam. Midazolam is metabolized almost completely by cytochrome P450-3A4. Atorvastatin administration along with midazolam results in a reduced elimination rate of midazolam. St John's wort decreases the <b>blood</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> midazolam. Grapefruit juice reduces intestinal 3A4 and results in less metabolism and higher plasma concentrations.|$|E
5|$|Treatment for acute adrenal {{insufficiency}} requires the administration of intravenous saline or dextrose solution; volumes of over two liters may be required in an adult. This {{is followed by the}} administration of hydrocortisone, which is pharmaceutical grade cortisol, intravenously or into a muscle. The drug dexamethasone has similar properties, but its use is not recommended unless it is required to reduce swelling in the brain around the area of hemorrhage. Some are well enough not to require immediate cortisol replacement; in this case, <b>blood</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> cortisol are determined at 9:00AM (as cortisol levels vary over the day). A level below 550nmol/l indicates a need for replacement.|$|E
5|$|In diurnal animals, it {{is typical}} for <b>blood</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> the hormone cortisol—which {{is used to}} {{increase}} blood sugar and aid metabolism and is also produced in response to stress—to be most stable in the afternoon after decreasing throughout the morning. However, cortisol levels are also the most reactive to environmental changes unrelated to sleep and daylight during the afternoon. As a result, {{this time of day}} is considered optimal for researchers studying stress and hormone levels. Plants generally have their highest photosynthetic levels of the day at noon and in the early afternoon, owing to the sun's high angle in the sky. The large proliferation of maize crops across Earth has caused tiny, harmless fluctuations in the normal pattern of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, since these crops photosynthesize large amounts of carbon dioxide during these times and this process sharply drops down during the late afternoon and evening.|$|E

40|$|The placental {{transmission}} of lincomycin was studied in 60 patients in late pregnancy. A peak maternal <b>blood</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> 12 · 5 μg/ml was recorded 45 minutes after injection, and detectable levels were still present up to 42 {{hours after a}} single injection.

5|$|Overdoses of {{ingested}} iron {{can cause}} excessive levels of free iron in the blood. High <b>blood</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> free ferrous iron react with peroxides to produce highly reactive free radicals that can damage DNA, proteins, lipids, and other cellular components. Iron toxicity {{occurs when the}} cell contains free iron, which generally occurs when iron levels exceed the availability of transferrin to bind the iron. Damage to {{the cells of the}} gastrointestinal tract can also prevent them from regulating iron absorption, leading to further increases in blood levels. Iron typically damages cells in the heart, liver and elsewhere, causing adverse effects that include coma, metabolic acidosis, shock, liver failure, coagulopathy, adult respiratory distress syndrome, long-term organ damage, and even death. Humans experience iron toxicity when the iron exceeds 20milligrams for every kilogram of body mass; 60milligrams per kilogram is considered a lethal dose. Overconsumption of iron, often the result of children eating large quantities of ferrous sulfate tablets intended for adult consumption, {{is one of the most}} common toxicological causes of death in children under six. The Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) sets the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for adults at 45mg/day. For children under fourteen years old the UL is 40mg/day.|$|E
5|$|The disease term venous {{thromboembolism}} (VTE) {{includes the}} development of either DVT or pulmonary embolism (PE). Genetic factors that {{increase the risk of}} VTE include deficiencies of three proteins that normally prevent blood from clotting—protein C, protein S, and antithrombin—in addition to non-O blood type and mutations in the factor V and prothrombin genes. Deficiencies in antithrombin, protein C, and protein S are rare but strong, or moderately strong, risk factors. These three thrombophilia increase the risk of VTE by about 10 times. Factor V Leiden, which makes factor V resistant to inactivation by activated protein C, and the genetic variant prothrombin G20210A, which causes increased prothrombin levels, are predominantly expressed in Caucasians. They moderately increase risk for VTE, by three to eight times for factor V Leiden and two to three times for prothrombin G20210A. Having a non-O blood type roughly doubles VTE risk. Non-O blood type is common in all races, making it an important risk factor. Individuals without O blood type have higher <b>blood</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> von Willebrand factor and factor VIII than those with O blood type, increasing the likelihood of clotting.|$|E
5|$|The first {{reported}} poisonings resulting in death from {{the consumption of}} A.bisporigera were from near San Antonio, Mexico, in 1957, where a rancher, his wife, and three children consumed the fungus; only the man survived. Amanita poisoning {{is characterized by the}} following distinct stages: the incubation stage is an asymptomatic period which ranges from 6 to 12 hours after ingestion. In the gastrointestinal stage, about 6 to 16 hours after ingestion, there is onset of abdominal pain, explosive vomiting, and diarrhea for up to 24 hours, which may lead to dehydration, severe electrolyte imbalances, and shock. These early symptoms may be related to other toxins such as phalloidin. In the cytotoxic stage, 24 to 48 hours after ingestion, clinical and biochemical signs of liver damage are observed, but the patient is typically free of gastrointestinal symptoms. The signs of liver dysfunction such as jaundice, hypoglycemia, acidosis, and hemorrhage appear. Later, there is an increase in the levels of prothrombin and <b>blood</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> ammonia, and the signs of hepatic encephalopathy and/or kidney failure appear. The risk factors for mortality that have been reported are age younger than 10 years, short latency period between ingestion and onset of symptoms, severe coagulopathy (blood clotting disorder), severe hyperbilirubinemia (jaundice), and rising serum creatinine levels.|$|E
50|$|In human adults, {{the normal}} <b>blood</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> {{antithrombin}} activity has been measured {{to be around}} 1.1 units/mL.

25|$|A {{secondary}} hyperaldosteronism develops {{due to the}} decreased blood volume.

40|$|THE {{enhancement}} <b>of</b> the serum <b>blood</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> antibiotics after oral admin-istration of minimal doses {{would be}} highly desirous.

High serum <b>blood</b> <b>levels</b> are maintained only {{with the use of}} multiple doses of the chosen drug {{over an extended period of}} time.

40|$|The serum {{concentrations}} of tri-iodothyronine (T 3), thyroxine (T 4), and thyrotrophin (TSH) were measured in 10 term newborn infants between birth {{and the age}} of 2 days by radioimmunoassay. The mean concentration of T 3 in maternal serum was 1. 62 mug/l, and it increased from the low cord <b>blood</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> 0 - 63 mug/l to the peak value of 1 - 76 mug/l within the first 2 hours of life. Mean serum T 4 concentrations increased from the cord <b>blood</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> 145 mug/l to the peak value of 205 mug/l within the first 24 hours of life. The postnatal increase of the mean serum TSH concentrations from the cord <b>blood</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> 5 - 7 mU/l to the peak value of 20 - 6 mU/l within 2 hours was similar to the increase of T 3. These data confirm earlier reports which show that T 3 secretion is low at birth and TSH secretion is stimulated strongly but transiently after birth, and that the low T 3 secretion is rapidly normalized in 2 hours along with the TSH release. Because of these strong and rapid changes, we recommend screening of the function of the pituitary-thyroid axis in neonates after the age of 24 hours...|$|R
