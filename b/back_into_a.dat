5|$|Hurricane Olga {{formed as}} a {{subtropical}} cyclone on November 24 and meandered westward where it reached hurricane status on November 26. The storm attained peak winds of 90mph (150km/h) before turning southeastward and weakening <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> tropical storm. Olga dissipated as a tropical cyclone on December 6 east of the Bahamas.|$|E
5|$|The family Ardeidae {{contains}} the herons, egrets and bitterns. Herons and egrets are wading birds with long necks and legs. Herons {{are large and}} egrets are smaller. Bitterns tend to be shorter-necked and more secretive. Unlike other long-necked birds such as storks, ibises, and spoonbills, members of the Ardeidae fly with their necks pulled <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> curve.|$|E

5|$|As Josephine {{continued}} east-northeastward, it had weakened <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> tropical storm. Under {{the influence}} of an area of high pressure {{to the north and}} a nearby area of low pressure, Josephine began executing a cyclonic loop to the north while approaching Atlantic Canada. During the cyclonic loop, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on October18. Shortly thereafter, the remnants of Josephine merged with a broad mid-latitude trough. The remnants of Josephine tracked southward and completed the cyclonic loop on October19. The system eventually curved to the east-northeastward and moved in that direction until it became unidentifiable on October21.|$|E
5|$|At 09:00 Sefik {{and his two}} battalions were {{approaching}} Kavak Tepe, and made contact with his 2nd Battalion that had conducted a fighting withdrawal, and {{an hour and a}} half later the regiment was deployed to stop the ANZACs advancing any further. Around 10:00 Kemal arrived at Scrubby Knoll and steadied some retreating troops, pushing them <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> defensive position. As they arrived, the 57th Infantry Regiment were given their orders and prepared to counter-attack. Scrubby Knoll, known to the Turks as Kemalyeri (Kemal's Place), now became the site of the Turkish headquarters for the remainder of the campaign.|$|E

5|$|At Bristol Road, PA 263 enters Warwick Township {{and becomes}} a four-lane divided highway as it turns north and runs through wooded areas with some homes, {{crossing}} Little Neshaminy Creek. The route regains a center left-turn lane as it reaches an intersection with Almshouse Road {{in the community of}} Jamison. At this intersection, the route is briefly a divided highway. After Almshouse Road, PA 263 continues north through business areas before heading past residential development. The route turns <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> divided highway as it crosses over the Neshaminy Creek and passes through areas woodland and homes. The road leaves Warwick Township for Buckingham Township at the Sugar Bottom Road intersection.|$|E
5|$|Dan {{crossed over}} the island and emerged into the South China Sea, having lost its eye feature and {{weakened}} <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> tropical storm. Convection soon redeveloped as the storm moved northwestward through warm waters. The JTWC reports that Dan reattained typhoon status at 0000 UTC on October 12, although it according to the JMA it did so 24 hours earlier. The typhoon continued to intensify, and the JTWC estimates that it reached its peak intensity at 0600 UTC, with 1-minute maximum sustained winds of 130km/h (80mph). The JMA indicates that Dan peaked slightly afterward, with 10-minute sustained winds of 140km/h (85mph) and a minimum barometric pressure reading of 960 millibars.|$|E
5|$|Early on November 20, the JTWC {{reported}} that a tropical depression had developed. Shortly thereafter, MFR {{reported that}} a tropical disturbance had formed. The low moved west-southwest while gradually deepening. Late on November 20, MFR upgraded the system into a moderate tropical storm. The storm failed to intensify further as it had moved onshore northern Madagascar. By November 21, MFR estimated that the storm weakened <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> disturbance. After emerging into the Mozambique Channel, Anety reportedly re-intensified back to moderate tropical storm status. While making its closest approach to the African mainland, the storm resumed weakening while turning back southeast. On November 23, both agencies stopped monitoring the system.|$|E

5|$|Hampden was {{temporarily}} converted into an athletics stadium for the 2014 Commonwealth Games. It hosted its last international game before the conversion work on 15 November 2013 and Queen's Park are playing their home {{games at the}} Excelsior Stadium in Airdrie. Due to the works being carried out at the Olympic Stadium, the 2014 London Grand Prix was by hosted by Hampden. The conversion works involved the removal of eight rows of seating, which reduced the capacity to 44,000. Hampden was converted <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> football stadium after the Commonwealth Games.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, the {{new owner}} of Swakeleys, CES Properties (Ickenham), {{received}} planning permission from Hillingdon Council to convert the house <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> single large residence, including 23 en-suite bedrooms, a party pavilion and a stable. CES Properties placed restrictions on the staging of the Ickenham Festival that year, leading to the festival's organising committee relocating its planned gala day and evening events to the nearby Vyners School. The festival had previously used {{the grounds of the}} house as a focal point for events. CES Properties placed the house up for sale in February 2015 for Â£45 million.|$|E

5|$|Philippe {{continued}} to steadily strengthen, becoming a hurricane late on September 18 as it traveled north in a low-shear environment and some models {{suggested that this}} trend would continue and Philippe {{would go on to}} become a major hurricane. However, Philippe began to encounter higher wind shear from a non-tropical low, the development of which partly resulted from Hurricane Rita's outflow. As a result of this shear, Philippe's winds only managed to reach a peak of 80mph (130km/h) before weakening <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> tropical storm on September 20.|$|E

5|$|Python {{does not}} support tail call {{optimization}} or first-class continuations, and, according to Guido van Rossum, it never will. However, better support for coroutine-like functionality is provided in 2.5, by extending Python's generators. Before 2.5, generators were lazy iterators; information was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. From Python 2.5, {{it is possible to}} pass information <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> generator function, and from Python 3.3, the information can be passed through multiple stack levels.|$|E
5|$|The Ashford Ring Road was {{completed}} in November 1974 around the town centre {{in an attempt to}} relieve congestion, though part of it involved demolition of existing properties and part of the old market. It initially opened as one way, but was converted <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> two-way operation in 2007, at a total cost of Â£14m, so the town centre could expand and accommodate more people. The two-way route incorporates the first shared space scheme in the country. An art installation, Lost O, curated by the artist Michael Pinsky, was created as part of this redevelopment but confused drivers.|$|E
5|$|The {{house was}} {{transformed}} into three cottages during the 17th century, which involved a new door and additional fireplaces being added. The economy and status of Southampton did not begin to improve until the 18th century, when it became a noted cultural centre. In 1780 the three cottages were converted <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> single building, owned by a MrsCollins as a lodging house for actors. During the Victorian era Southampton saw a huge expansion of its maritime docks {{and the construction of}} a new railway line. The Medieval Merchant's House was converted again, and had become a beer-shop by 1883, and a popular public house called the Bull's Head.|$|E
