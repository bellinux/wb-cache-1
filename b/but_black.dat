5|$|Black {{returns to}} Seattle, researching Gehenna Industries from his home. He uncovers a {{warehouse}} address {{belonging to the}} cult, which Atkins investigates. The warehouse is full of cached weaponry, stockpiled for the cult's doomsday predictions. The cult's leader lures Atkins into the industrial microwave which {{has been used to}} immolate the victims, but the police arrive in time to save him, having been tipped off by Black that Atkins may be in danger. The weapons stockpile allows the police to bring down the cult, <b>but</b> <b>Black</b> is certain that their influence is still a threat.|$|E
5|$|Calloway {{enters the}} church {{wielding}} explosives, taking the congregation hostage. The building is quickly surrounded by police and reporters as Calloway gives a sermon to his hostages {{about the loss}} of faith. Black believes he can connect with Calloway, and is allowed to enter the church. Calloway is initially hostile, <b>but</b> <b>Black</b> is able to talk him down, convincing Calloway that his faith has not been lost, but simply tested—despite all that has happened, Calloway has never lost his belief in God. Realizing the truth of this, Calloway surrenders.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{investigation}} has found traces of this {{drug in the}} other victims, with Black believing that the killer not only has access to it through his occupation but is likely consuming it himself while committing his crimes in order to readily act on his sexual fantasies. Black follows up on this, and investigates Nesbitt's pharmacy. Nesbitt is not working at the time, <b>but</b> <b>Black</b> realizes he must be the killer. He interviews Nesbitt's wife (Barbara Howard), finding {{that they have not}} had sex in eighteen years of marriage—however, Nesbitt has recently become interested in trying again.|$|E

40|$|The spatial {{mismatch}} hypothesis associates {{high unemployment}} rates among inner-city blacks with the spatial dispersion of employment to suburban job markets. An alternative explanation for high unemployment is the skills mismatch hypothesis, which argues that skill demands in urban labor markets increase over time, <b>but</b> <b>blacks</b> lag behind other population groups in their job skills and educational attainments. This {{research suggests that}} spatial and skills mismatch are interlinked. Logistical regression models are utilized, with 1990 PUMS data, to test the impacts of spatial accessibility on employment {{of black and white}} youths between 16 and 25 years of age in three different labor-market segments. The results confirm that a disadvantage for blacks exists as {{a combination of the two}} mismatches. Racial job-accessibility differentials appears to be more important in lower labor-market segments <b>but</b> <b>blacks</b> experience a disadvantage both in central-city and in suburban locations. ...|$|R

He and fellow Group members Brian Roedecker (Allan Zinyk) and Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) identify the victim as Rebecca Damsen. Damsen's email correspondence leads them to a San Jose address; Watts finds the bodies of both the owner and Damsen in a nearby graveyard. By the bodies is another number, which they determine to be an IP address.|$|E
5|$|The Holy Roman Empire (800/962 – 1806, {{known as}} the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation after 1512) {{did not have a}} {{national}} flag, <b>but</b> <b>black</b> and gold were used as colors of the Holy Roman Emperor and featured in the imperial banner: a black eagle on a golden background. After the late 13th or early 14th century, the claws and beak of the eagle were colored red. From the early 15th century, a double-headed eagle was used.|$|E
5|$|Black {{immediately}} faced {{accusations of}} poor appointments by Stanley. The School Textbook Commission was {{singled out for}} particular criticism. The Kentucky Court of Appeals had ruled that the Commission acted illegally in selecting textbooks submitted in dummy form. Black called on the commissioners to resign, but when they refused, he claimed he had no power to remove them except for fraud or corruption. The Louisville Courier-Journal pointed out that Black could replace any Stanley appointees {{that had not yet}} been confirmed by the Senate, <b>but</b> <b>Black</b> refused to do so. Some believed that Black had agreed to retain Stanley's appointees in exchange for Stanley's support of Black's re-election campaign.|$|E

5|$|In April 1982, Mandela was {{transferred}} to Pollsmoor Prison in Tokai, Cape Town, along with senior ANC leaders Walter Sisulu, Andrew Mlangeni, Ahmed Kathrada, and Raymond Mhlaba; they {{believed that they were}} being isolated to remove their influence on younger activists at Robben Island. Conditions at Pollsmoor were better than at Robben Island, although Mandela missed the camaraderie and scenery of the island. Getting on well with Pollsmoor's commanding officer, Brigadier Munro, Mandela was permitted to create a roof garden; he also read voraciously and corresponded widely, now permitted 52 letters a year. He was appointed patron of the multi-racial United Democratic Front (UDF), founded to combat reforms implemented by South African President P. W. Botha. Botha's National Party government had permitted Coloured and Indian citizens to vote for their own parliaments, which had control over education, health, and housing, <b>but</b> <b>black</b> Africans were excluded from the system; like Mandela, the UDF saw this as an attempt to divide the anti-apartheid movement on racial lines.|$|E
5|$|Most bogs {{exist in}} glaciated areas, <b>but</b> <b>Black</b> Moshannon State Park {{is on the}} Allegheny Plateau. This area was not covered by glaciers during the last ice age. The bogs formed here because of the beds of {{sandstone}} that lie flat, a short distance {{below the surface of}} the earth. The sandstone formations in the park do not absorb water very well, so any depression in them will collect water, as has happened here. The bogs extend the shores of the lake. Migratory shorebirds that visit here include greater and lesser yellowlegs, least sandpiper, solitary sandpiper, and the spotted sandpiper, which has been confirmed as using the IBA as a breeding grounds.|$|E
5|$|Both {{male and}} female mallards have {{distinct}} iridescent purple-blue speculum feathers edged with white, which are prominent in flight or at rest but temporarily shed during the annual summer moult. Upon hatching, the plumage of the duckling is yellow on the underside and face (with streaks by the eyes) and black on the back (with some yellow spots) {{all the way to}} the top and back of the head. Its legs and bill are also black. As it nears a month in age, the duckling's plumage starts becoming drab, looking more like the female, though more streaked, and its legs lose their dark grey colouring. Two months after hatching, the fledgling period has ended, and the duckling is now a juvenile. Between three and four months of age, the juvenile can finally begin flying, as its wings are fully developed for flight (which can be confirmed by the sight of purple speculum feathers). Its bill soon loses its dark grey colouring, and its sex can finally be distinguished visually by three factors: 1)the bill is yellow in males, <b>but</b> <b>black</b> and orange in females; 2)the breast feathers are reddish-brown in males, but brown in females; and 3)in males, the centre tail feather (drake feather) is curled, but in females, the centre tail feather is straight. During the final period of maturity leading up to adulthood (6–10 months of age), the plumage of female juveniles remains the same while the plumage of male juveniles gradually changes to its characteristic colours. This change in plumage also applies to adult mallard males when they transition in and out of their non-breeding eclipse plumage at the beginning and the end of the summer moulting period. The adulthood age for mallards is fourteen months, and the average life expectancy is three years, but they can live to twenty.|$|E
