2500|$|Cameron {{had already}} {{published}} magazine articles and a literary book, Faces of Leacock, a 1967 {{study of the}} great Canadian humorist, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> finally free to begin his apprenticeship as a full-time writer. For him, D'Escousse was an ideal home base. [...] "For a writer," [...] Cameron writes, [...] "the great benefit of a village {{is the way you}} can know people." [...] He added that in cities, writers are inevitably drawn into limited circles, but villages let them escape. [...] "My friends in D'Escousse include welders, fishermen, millwrights and mothers on welfare as well as teachers, potters, priests and businessmen." [...] Moreover, a writer who lives in a village watches people change and grow. [...] "An electrician becomes a politician, schoolboys become truckers and contractors, middle-aged civil servants retire and old people take their departures. Knowing them year by year, I can grasp something of the flow of their lives." ...|$|E
2500|$|Owain {{remained}} free <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a hunted guerilla leader. The revolt {{continued to}} splutter on. In 1410, Owain readied his supporters {{for a last}} raid deep into Shropshire. Many of his most loyal commanders were present. It {{may have been a}} last desperate suicide raid. Whatever was intended, the raid went terribly wrong and many of the leading figures still at large were captured. Rhys Ddu ("Black Rhys") of Cardigan, one of Owain’s most faithful commanders, was captured and taken to London for execution. A chronicle of the time states that Rhys Ddu was: [...] "…laid on a hurdle and so drawn forth to Tyburn through the City and was there hanged and let down again. His head was smitten off and his body quartered and sent to four towns and his head set on London Bridge." [...] Philip Scudamore and Rhys ap Tudur were also beheaded and their heads displayed at Shrewsbury and Chester (no doubt to discourage any further thoughts of rebellion).|$|E
