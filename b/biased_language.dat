On cross-examination, Hermle found an inconsistency with Pao's deposition video {{on the question of whether}} she asked to see an Equal Opportunity Employment policy. She also sought to show evidence of plotting in 2011 and 2012 by bringing up emails in which Pao discussed her options with friend and Google engineer Lori Park. These revealed that Pao had applied for jobs at YouTube and Menlo Ventures and was considering starting her own firm. Some issues with how Pao responded to termination were also raised. Pao said that it made sense for her to break the news to the CEOs of the three companies in her immediate network but revealed that Ted Schlein chastised her for doing so. On the stand, Pao objected to the way Employment Law Alliance investigator Stephen Hirschfeld responded to the discrimination complaints by Trae Vassallo and herself. She alleged that the reports used <b>biased</b> <b>language,</b> softened the airplane incident by changing the name of a pornographic show to Entourage and focused on eliminating KPCB's liability rather than addressing the concerns of employees. When Hirschfeld was questioned by Lawless, he revealed that his reports did not include a matrix which Vassallo used to tabulate discrepancies between male and female partners. This criticism was repeated by Allison West of Employment Practices Specialists who testified that the firm's investigation of gender issues was insufficient. She also commented that it was circular for the defendant to rely heavily on performance reviews to discredit Pao's allegations against the people writing them.|$|E

40|$|Inductive logic {{programming}} (ILP) is a recently emerging subfield of machine learning that aims at overcoming {{the limitations of}} most attribute-value learning algorithms by adopting a more powerful language of first-order logic. Employing successful learning techniques of ILP to learn interesting characteristics among database relations {{is of particular interest}} to the knowledge discovery in databases research community. However, most existing ILP systems are general-purpose learners and that means users {{have to know how to}} tune some factors of ILP learners to best suit their tasks at hand. One such factor with great impact on the efficiency of ILP learning is how to specify the <b>language</b> <b>bias.</b> The <b>language</b> <b>bias</b> is a restriction on the format (or syntax) of clauses allowed in the hypothesis space. If the language is too weak, the search space is very large, and hence, the learning efficiency is decreased. On the contrary, if the language is too strong, the search space is so small that many interesting rules may be excluded from consideration. It is the purpose of this dissertation to develop an algorithm to generate a potentially useful <b>language</b> <b>bias</b> that is more appropriate for the task of inducing semantic constraints from the database relations. These constraints will be a major source of semantic knowledge for semantic query optimization in database query processing. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm was verified experimentally. The appropriate form of <b>language</b> <b>bias</b> specification, which is the output of the algorithm, was tested on the ILP system CLAUDIEN comparing with a number of different forms of <b>language</b> <b>bias</b> specification.

40|$|Language {{plays an}} {{indispensable}} {{role in the}} transmission, maintenance, and formation of culturally shared beliefs. Yet beliefs about groups, in particular, are shared despite the existence of prohibitive norms that act to inhibit their expression. This apparent incongruity suggests that cultural beliefs become shared through linguistic means other than explicit expression. In support of this, the linguistic bias paradigm proposes that linguistic bias is the implicit and unintentional expression of beliefs through the differential use of linguistic abstraction (Franco & Maass, 1996; Maass, 1999; Maass, Salvi, Arcuri, & Semin, 1989), {{as defined by the}} Linguistic Category Model (Semin & Fiedler, 1988). According to this paradigm, linguistic bias not only reveals the speakers’ privately held beliefs but also transmits these beliefs to recipients, leading to belief sharedness. The consequences of exposure to linguistic bias, however, have yet to be shown and this is the aim of the present research program. The first study focuses on belief transmission, by determining if there is a direct causal effect from linguistic abstraction to individual impression formation. Results show that <b>biased</b> <b>language</b> transmits information about individuals but the communication context, specifically whom the message is about, is also important. Given this, {{it is likely that the}} content of the message will also affect the reception of <b>biased</b> <b>language.</b> The second study thus focuses on belief maintenance, by considering the relative effects of different levels of linguistic abstraction on pre-existing beliefs. Results were inconclusive, but may have been affected by methodological limitations. The third study addresses these limitations while focusing on belief formation, by measuring the impact of <b>biased</b> <b>language</b> in the absence of pre-existing beliefs. Recipients, in general, formed beliefs that corresponded to the <b>biased</b> <b>language</b> to which they were exposed. Together, these studies suggest that linguistic bias plays a role in belief sharedness as a mechanism through which cultural beliefs are transmitted and formed.

40|$|Abstract: Publication bias {{occurs when}} results of {{published}} studies are systematically different from results of unpublished studies. The term “dissemination bias ” {{has also been}} recommended to describe all forms of biases in the research-dissemination process, including outcome-reporting bias, time-lag bias, gray-literature <b>bias,</b> full-publication <b>bias,</b> <b>language</b> <b>bias,</b> citation bias, and media-attention bias. We can measure publication bias {{by comparing the results}} of published and unpublished studies addressing the same question. Following up cohorts of studies from inception and comparing publication levels in studies with statistically significant or “positive” results suggested greater odds of formal publication in those with such results, compared to those without. Within reviews, funnel plots and related statistical methods can be used to indicate presence or absence of publication bias, although these can be unreliable in many circumstances. Methods of avoiding publication bias, by identifying and including unpublished outcomes and unpublished studies, are discussed and evaluated. These include searching without limiting by outcome, searching prospective trials registers, searching informal sources, including meeting abstracts and PhD theses, searching regulatory body websites, contacting authors of included studies, and contacting pharmaceutical or medical device companies for further studies.

40|$|Background: An {{important}} {{characteristic of}} meta-analysis {{is that the}} results are determined both by {{the management of the}} meta-analysis process and by the features of studies included. The scientific rigor of potential primary studies varies considerably and the common objection to meta-analytic summaries is that they combine results from studies of different quality. Researchers began to develop quality scales for experimental studies, however now the interest of researchers is also focusing on observational studies. Since 1980, when Chalmers developed the first quality scale to assess primary studies included in metaanalysis, more than 100 scales have been developed, which vary dramatically in {{the quality and quantity of}} the items included. No standard lists of items exist, and the used quality scales lack empirically-supported components. Methods: Two of the most important and diffuse quality scales for experimental studies, Jadad system and Chalmers’ scale, and a quality scale used for observational studies, developed by Angelillo et al., are described and compared. Conclusion: The fallibility of meta-analysis is not surprising, considering the various bias that may be introduced by the processes of locating and selecting studies, including publication <b>bias,</b> <b>language</b> <b>bias</b> and citation bias.

The prevailing inhibition hypothesis takes larger reaction-time (RT) costs for switching to the first language (L 1) than to the second language (L 2) as evidence for suppression of the non-target language. Switch cost asymmetries can alternatively be explained by an L 1 -repeat-benefit, assuming selective absence of language competition in repeating L 1. To test the latter hypothesis, RTs and event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded when unbalanced Dutch–English bilinguals switched between overt picture naming in L 1 and L 2.

50|$|Moreover, {{the fact}} that the Big Five model was based on lexical hypothesis, (i.e. on the verbal {{descriptors}} of individual differences) indicated strong methodological flaws in this model, especially related to its main factors, Extraversion and Neuroticism. First, there is a natural pro-social <b>bias</b> of <b>language</b> in people's verbal evaluations. After all, language is an invention of group dynamics that was developed to facilitate socialization, the exchange of information and to synchronize group activity. This social function of language therefore creates a sociability bias in verbal descriptors of human behaviour: there are more words related to social than physical or even mental aspects of behavior. The sheer number of such descriptors will cause them to group into a largest factor in any language, and such grouping {{has nothing to do with}} the way that core systems of individual differences are set up. Second, there is also a negativity bias in emotionality (i.e. most emotions have negative affectivity), and there are more words in language to describe negative rather than positive emotions. Such asymmetry in emotional valence creates another <b>bias</b> in <b>language.</b> Experiments using the lexical hypothesis approach indeed demonstrated that the use of lexical material skews the resulting dimensionality according to a sociability <b>bias</b> of <b>language</b> and a negativity bias of emotionality, grouping all evaluations around these two dimensions. This means that the two largest dimensions in the Big Five model might be just an artifact of the lexical approach that this model employed.|$|R
