The demonstrators marched towards Ambohitsorohitra Palace {{and crossed the}} [...] "ligne rouge" [...] (red line), the perimeter line around the palace gates that demarcates the zone off-limits to the public. The palace guards responded by firing live ammunition to disperse the crowd. Initial reports counted 83 wounded and 28 people killed, including a local reporter. Some looting was reported afterward. Ambulances took the wounded to hospitals or private clinics, and bodies were seen piled up on the streets before they {{were taken to the}} morgue. The National Police warned that the death toll could rise, as many of the wounded were in critical condition. The following day it was reported that the death toll had increased to at least 50, with doctors estimating that 180 people had arrived at the city's main Ravoahangy Andrianavalona Hospital.

40|$|Objective: to {{investigate}} the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of Enterococcus species isolated from a university hospital, and explore the mechanisms underlying the antimicrobial resistance, so as to provide clinical evidence for the inappropriate clinical use of antimicrobial agents and the control and prevention of enterococcal infections. Methods: a total of 1, 157 enterococcal strains isolated from various clinical specimens from January 2010 to December 2012 in the General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University were identified to species level with a VITEK- 2 COMPACT fully automated microbiological system, and the antimicrobial susceptibility of Enterococcus species was determined using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. The multiple-drug resistant enterococcal isolates were screened from the clinical isolates of Enterococcus species from the <b>burns</b> <b>department.</b> The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Enterococcus species to the three fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin and levofloxacin was determined with the agar dilution method, and {{the changes in the}} MIC of Enterococcus species to the three fluoroquinolones following reserpine treatment were evaluated. The β-lactam, aminoglycoside, tetracycline, macrolide, glycopeptide resistance genes and the efflux pump emeA genes were detected in the enterococcal isolates using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Results: the 1, 157 clinical isolates of Enterococcus species included 679 E. faecium isolates (58. 7 %), 382 E. faecalis isolates (33 %), 26 E. casseliflavus isolates (2. 2 %), 24 E. avium isolates (2. 1 %), and 46 isolates of other Enterococcus species (4 %). The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance varied significantly between E. faecium and E. faecalis, and ≤ 1. 1 % of these two Enterococcus species were found to be resistant to vancomycin, teicoplanin or linezolid. In addition, the Enterococcus species isolated from different departments of the hospital exhibited various resistances to the same antimicrobial agent, while reserpine treatment reduced the resistance of Enterococcus species to ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin and levofloxacin. The β-lactamase gene TEM, aminoglycoside-modifying-enzyme genes aac(6 ') -aph(2 "), aph(3 ') -III, ant(6) -I and ant(2 ") -I, tetracycline resistance gene tetM, erythromycin resistance gene ermB, vancomycin resistance gene vanA and the enterococcal multidrug resistance efflux emeA gene were detected in 77 %, 62 %, 26 %, 13 %, 36 %, 31 %, 66 %, 5 % and 55 % of the 100 multiple-drug resistant enterococcal isolates. Conclusions: similar to previous findings, E. faecium and E. faecalis are predominant conditionally pathogenic bacteria that cause hospital-acquired infections that can cause urinary and respiratory system infections. Multiple and high-level antimicrobial resistance is highly prevalent in the hospital isolates of Enterococcus species. Reserpine treatment inhibits the active efflux of Enterococcus species to ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin and levofloxacin in vitro and reduces the MIC of Enterococcus species to these three fluoroquinolones. The presence of the enterococcal multidrug resistance efflux emeA gene is associated with the resistance to antibiotics in Enterococcus species. The monitoring of the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of Enterococcus species is of great significance to guide the control and prevention of enterococcal infections...|$|E
40|$|Background: Burns {{represent}} the major percentage of injuries to children. Their incidence level, injury mechanisms and treatment often {{differ from the}} burn injuries of adults. Methods: From the medical records of the Department for Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery of the Ljubljana Medical Centre we gathered, analyzed and compared the burn injuries of children up {{to the age of}} 15 who were admitted to hospital in the year 2003 to those who were treated as outpatients. Moreover, we compared the burn injuries of hospitalized children at the same department in the years 2003, 1993 and 1983 respectively. We compared their gender, age, the total body surface area of burns, the depth of burns, frequency of the mechanisms of injury, the affected parts of the body and the length and mode of treatment. Finally, we compared our results with the results of similar studies from other burn centres. Results: The number of children treated for <b>burns</b> at the <b>department</b> has declined. In all the years studied, the injured children were younger than 5 and the majority of them were boys. The number of children admitted with substantial total body surface areas of burns was also declining. However, there was {{an increase in the number}} of children admitted with burns less than 10 % of their total body surface area. The number of burns treated by surgery slightly increased over the years studied. There was a similar sex and age distribution among the hospitalized children and those treated as outpatients. Conclusions: The number of children hospitalized with burns is in decline. In the years 1983, 1993 and 2003, there was no significant difference in the percentage of children who were treated surgically and those who were treated conservatively (P = 0. 247).

40|$|Abstract Background Work-related burns {{are common}} among {{occupational}} injuries. Zhejiang Province is an industrial {{area with a}} high incidence of chemical burns. We aimed to survey epidemiological features of chemical burns in Zhejiang province to determine associated factors and acquire data for developing a strategy to prevent and treat chemical burns. Methods Questionnaires were developed, reviewed and validated by experts, and sent to 25 hospitals in Zhejiang province to prospectively collect data of 492 chemical burn patients admitted during one year from Sept. 1, 2008 to Aug. 31, 2009. Questions included victims' characteristics and general condition, injury location, causes of accident, causative chemicals, total body surface area burn, concomitant injuries, employee safety training, and awareness level of protective measures. Surveys were completed for each of burn patients by <b>burn</b> <b>department</b> personnel who interviewed the hospitalized patients. Results In this study, 417 victims (87. 61 %) got chemical burn at work, of which 355 victims (74. 58 %) worked in private or individual enterprises. Most frequent chemicals involved were hydrofluoric acid and sulfuric acid. Main causes of chemical injury accidents were inappropriate operation of equipment or handling of chemicals and absence of or failure to use effective individual protection. Conclusions Most chemical burns are preventable occupational injuries that can be attributed to inappropriate operation of equipment or handling of chemicals, lack of employee awareness about appropriate action and lack of effective protective equipment and training.

40|$|Introduction Facial burns {{could create}} serious scar {{problems}} resulting disfigurement particularly on children. The conventional methods of producing transparent face masks for scar control remains complex and require dexterous skills of experienced clinician and patients’ compliance during fitting. In this study, we adopted a portable 3 D scanning and Computer-Aided Design (CAD) to produce 3 D-printed transparent facemasks. Its efficacy was tested on two children with facial burns resulting hypertrophic scars. Method This study adopted a longitudinal case follow up research design. Two children with facial burns were recruited {{in the study}} upon consent. Their facial features were scanned with a portable 3 D scanner and then edited and converted to the target files: the customized printable facemask files. The transparent facemask was directly printed out on the transparent biocompatible material followed by adding the medical grade silicone gel to provide extra pressure on the scar site. The facemasks were fitted to the patients with elastic straps connecting the printed anchoring bolts. Both children and family were instructed to wear the facemask for at least 20  h per day and they were assessed before treatment, one month and three months after treatment on the facial scar conditions. Results At the one-month and three-month assessments after treatment, a decrease in average scar thickness was shown and the facial appearance was satisfactory. The 3 D-printed facemasks were well fitted on both patients. The treatment was well-tolerated and no complication was reported. Conclusion 3 D-printed transparent facemask is convenient and efficient to fabricate, and is suitable for treating pediatric facial hypertrophic scars after <b>burn.</b> <b>Department</b> of Rehabilitation Sciences 2016 - 2017 > Academic research: refereed > Publication in refereed journalbcr...|$|R
