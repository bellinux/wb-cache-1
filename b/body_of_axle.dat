50|$|The {{cylinder}} piston {{arrangement of the}} dashpot, i.e. the Lower Spring seat and the axle box guide is not fully sealed due to the limitation of the design and practical applicability. Its design provides that when a vertical vibration occurs during {{the movement of the}} railway coach, the axle box guide moves down. The downward movement <b>of</b> the <b>Axle</b> box guide puts pressure on the oil in the lower spring seat. The oil rushes up. However, since there are holes in the guide cap, the oil passes through these holes into the hollow <b>body</b> <b>of</b> the <b>axle</b> box guide. This helps in dampening the vertical vibrations. The axle box guide displaces the oil in the lower spring seat and pushes it upwards. Since, only part quantity of oil is able to move up in the hollow portion <b>of</b> the <b>axle</b> box guide, the balance displaced oil moves up.|$|R
40|$|Three {{alternative}} methods of crack detection and corrosion assessment for railway axle inspection {{have been proposed}} in the WOLAXIM (Whole Life Rail Axle Assessment and Improvement) project. One method is for the exposed <b>body</b> <b>of</b> the <b>axles</b> (intended primarily for freight wagon or passenger trailing axles) and {{can be carried out}} automatically, as the vehicles pass an inspection station that could be installed in carriage sidings or marshalling yards. A second method is specifically for the hollow <b>axles</b> <b>of</b> high speed trains and aims to improve the speed of the inspection and improve crack detection reliability. This could be deployed while the train is in the depot overnight and without dismantling the wheel set. The third method is to improve the measurement of corrosion and therefore the sentencing <b>of</b> corroded <b>axles.</b> This will be linked to newly developed corrosion fatigue assessment models by reliability methods. This paper describes the main principles of these methods and gives some preliminary results...|$|R
50|$|It is {{most often}} {{employed}} in steam engines and used to convert rotary into linear reciprocating motion in order to drive a sliding valve or a pump ram. In order to do so an eccentric usually has a groove at its circumference around which is closely fitted a circular collar (eccentric strap) attached to which an eccentric rod is suspended {{in such a way}} that its other end can impart the required reciprocating motion. A return crank fulfils the same function except that it can only work at the end <b>of</b> an <b>axle</b> or on the outside of a wheel whereas an eccentric can also be fitted to the <b>body</b> <b>of</b> the <b>axle</b> between the wheels. Unlike a cam, which also converts rotary into linear motion at almost any rate of acceleration and deceleration, an eccentric or return crank can only impart simple harmonic motion.|$|R
50|$|A block lift (often {{referred}} to as a budget lift) is a modification that is similar to a body lift in the way it works, but used in a different location. Block lifts are used to provide more room between the <b>body</b> and <b>axle</b> <b>of</b> a vehicle for larger tires. A block lift consists of either extended spring isolators or blocks that are inserted between a vehicles axle and spring, or a spring and the vehicles <b>body.</b> This type <b>of</b> lift is often preferred due to the affordability and ease of installation.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The {{toll rate}} charged for {{the usage of}} {{facilities}} such as a tunnel or a bridge is usually proportional to the number <b>of</b> <b>axles</b> possessed by a vehicle. However, it is sometimes difficult {{to determine the number}} <b>of</b> <b>axles</b> <b>of</b> a vehicle by the toll-booth operator and therefore, an automatic system that can identify the number <b>of</b> <b>axles</b> is sought. Instead <b>of</b> detecting the <b>axle,</b> wheels <b>of</b> a vehicle are tested and a method based on the Hough transform for detecting circles is proposed. As the system must be able to detect the correct number of wheels in real-time, sub-sampling based on the Haar Wavelet transform is applied. Experimental results show that the system is able to identify the wheel correctly and to process the input images in real-time...|$|R

The bridge toll is fixed for each vehicle category, and is charged only once in eastward direction on the two bridges in Istanbul. The road toll is rated further depending on the distance driven between the entry and the exit of motorway for each vehicle category.
