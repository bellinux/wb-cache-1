5|$|Fertility {{awareness}} methods involve {{determining the}} most fertile {{days of the}} menstrual cycle and avoiding unprotected intercourse. Techniques for determining fertility include monitoring basal <b>body</b> <b>temperature,</b> cervical secretions, or {{the day of the}} cycle. They have typical first-year failure rates of 24%; perfect use first-year failure rates depend on which method is used and range from 0.4% to 5%. The evidence on which these estimates are based, however, is poor as the majority of people in trials stop their use early. Globally, they are used by about 3.6% of couples. If based on both basal <b>body</b> <b>temperature</b> and another primary sign, the method is referred to as symptothermal. Overall first-year failure rates of <2% to 20% have been reported in clinical studies of the symptothermal method.|$|E
40|$|Aim: Temperature {{influences}} most {{components of}} animal ecology and life history – {{but what kind}} of temperature? Physiologists usually examine the influence of <b>body</b> <b>temperatures,</b> while biogeographers and macroecologists tend to focus on environmental temperatures. We aim {{to examine the relationship between}} these two measures, to determine the factors that affect lizard <b>body</b> <b>temperatures</b> and to test the effect of both temperature measures on lizard life history. Location: World-wide. Methods: We used a large (861 species) global dataset of lizard <b>body</b> <b>temperatures,</b> and the mean annual temperatures across their geographic ranges to examine the relationships between body and mean annual temperatures. We then examined factors influencing <b>body</b> <b>temperatures,</b> and tested for the influence of both on ecological and life-history traits while accounting for the influence of shared ancestry. Results: <b>Body</b> <b>temperatures</b> and mean annual temperatures are uncorrelated. However, accounting for activity time (nocturnal species have low <b>body</b> <b>temperatures),</b> use of space (fossorial and semi-aquatic species are ‘colder’), insularity (mainland species are ‘hotter’) and phylogeny, the two temperatures are positively correlated. High <b>body</b> <b>temperatures</b> are only associated with larger hatchlings and increased rates of biomass production. Annual temperatures are positively correlated with clutch frequency and annual longevity, and negatively correlated with clutch size, age at first reproduction and longevity. Main conclusions: Lizards with low <b>body</b> <b>temperatures</b> do not seem to have ‘slower’ life-history attributes than species with high <b>body</b> <b>temperatures.</b> The longer seasons prevalent in warm regions, and physiological processes that operate while lizards are inactive (but warm enough), make environmental temperatures better predictors of lizard life-history variation than <b>body</b> <b>temperatures.</b> This surprisingly greater effect of environmental temperatures on lizard life histories hints that global warming may have a profound influence on lizard ecology and evolution. ...|$|R

40|$|Lizards may select higher <b>body</b> <b>temperatures</b> after feeding, but {{rigorous}} {{experimental evidence}} of this is confined to {{a small number of}} lineages. Here it was examined in an anguid lizard, namely the slow-worm Anguis fragilis, which is a semi-fossorial cool temperate species that exhibits relatively low field <b>body</b> <b>temperatures.</b> <b>Body</b> <b>temperatures</b> selected by slow-worms in a thermal gradient were low compared with many other lizards (means ranged from 25. 3 to 26. 4 ºC). This indicates that low field <b>body</b> <b>temperatures</b> described previously are not due to thermoconformity in a cool environment. More significantly, selected <b>body</b> <b>temperatures</b> differed between fed and three-day fasted treatments, with an increase of 0. 4 – 1. 2 ºC being observed after feeding. The magnitude of this increase is similar to that reported for two iguanid lizards, and shows that a postprandial response is also present in this ecologically and phylogenetically distant species...|$|R
5|$|Most {{of these}} studies give two thermoregulatory roles for the sail of Dimetrodon: one {{as a means of}} warming quickly in the morning, and another as a way to cool down when <b>body</b> <b>temperature</b> becomes high. Dimetrodon and all other Early Permian land {{vertebrates}} are assumed to have been cold-blooded or poikilothermic, relying on the sun to maintain a high <b>body</b> <b>temperature.</b> Because of its large size, Dimetrodon had high thermal inertia, meaning that changes in <b>body</b> <b>temperature</b> occurred more slowly in it than in smaller-bodied animals. As temperatures rose in the mornings, the small-bodied prey of Dimetrodon could warm their bodies much faster than could something the size of Dimetrodon. Many paleontologists including Haack have proposed that the sail of Dimetrodon may have allowed it to warm quickly in the morning in order to keep pace with its prey. The sail's large surface area also meant heat could dissipate quickly into the surroundings, useful if the animal needed to release excess heat produced by metabolism or absorbed from the sun. Dimetrodon may have angled its sail away from the sun to cool off or restricted blood flow to the sail to maintain heat at night.|$|E

5|$|The {{biology of}} life {{operates}} {{within a certain}} range of temperatures. Heat {{is a form of}} energy that regulates temperature. Heat affects growth rates, activity, behaviour, and primary production. Temperature is largely dependent on the incidence of solar radiation. The latitudinal and longitudinal spatial variation of temperature greatly affects climates and consequently the distribution of biodiversity and levels of primary production in different ecosystems or biomes across the planet. Heat and temperature relate importantly to metabolic activity. Poikilotherms, for example, have a <b>body</b> <b>temperature</b> that is largely regulated and dependent on the temperature of the external environment. In contrast, homeotherms regulate their internal <b>body</b> <b>temperature</b> by expending metabolic energy.|$|E

5|$|When endothermy first {{appeared}} in the evolution of mammals is uncertain, though it is generally agreed to have first evolved in non-mammalian therapsids.

5|$|In 1986, J.Scott Turner and C.Richard Tracy {{proposed}} that {{the evolution of a}} sail in Dimetrodon was related to the evolution of warm-bloodedness in mammal ancestors.

Turner and Tracy noted that early therapsids, a more advanced group of synapsids closely related to mammals, had long limbs which can release heat {{in a manner similar to}} that of the sail of Dimetrodon. The homeothermy that developed in animals like Dimetrodon may have carried over to therapsids through a modification of body shape, which would eventually develop into the warm-bloodedness of mammals.|$|E
40|$|Until recently, marine {{scientists}} have {{relied heavily on}} satellite sea surface temperatures and terrestrial weather stations as indicators {{of the way in}} which the thermal environment, and hence the <b>body</b> <b>temperatures</b> of organisms, vary over spatial and temporal scales. We designed biomimetic temperature loggers for three species of rocky intertidal invertebrates to determine whether mimic <b>body</b> <b>temperatures</b> differ from the external environment and among species and microhabitats. For all three species, microhabitat temperatures were considerably higher than the <b>body</b> <b>temperatures,</b> with differences as great as 11. 1 °C on horizontal rocky substrata. Across microhabitats, daily maximal temperatures of the limpet Cellana tramoserica were on average 2. 1 and 3. 1 °C higher than <b>body</b> <b>temperatures</b> of the whelk Dicathais orbita and the barnacle Tesseropora rosea respectively. Among-microhabitat variation in each species 2 ̆ 7 temperature was equally as variable as differences among species within microhabitats.
