5|$|During {{the crisis}} between {{the king and}} Archbishop Anselm of Canterbury in 1095 and 1096, Luffa managed to support Anselm while {{retaining}} the king's respect. Under King Henry I, William's younger brother and successor, Luffa took little part in the Investiture Crisis in England. In 1106, Luffa did sign a letter to Anselm written by William Giffard Bishop of Winchester-elect that <b>begged</b> <b>the</b> archbishop to return to England from his exile.|$|E
5|$|Thereafter Myrrha {{walked in}} exile for nine months, past {{the palms of}} Arabia and the fields of Panchaea, until she reached Sabaea.

Later, Lucina freed the newborn Adonis from the tree.|$|E

His wounds became infected, and Ross <b>begged</b> <b>the</b> others to kill him to end his pain. When {{he was able to}} travel, he was first carried on a litter suspended between two mules, and then on the shoulders of his men. He recovered fully, but experienced some pain for {{much of the rest of}} the year.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to provide an account of <b>the</b> fallaciousness of <b>begging</b> <b>the</b> {{question}} without thereby indicting as fallacious all otherwise acceptable deductively valid reasoning. The solution that we suggest exploits the intuition that all good arguments are weakly circular. <b>The</b> fallaciousness of <b>begging</b> <b>the</b> question is not that the reasoning is circular simpliciter. Rather, <b>begging</b> <b>the</b> question is a fallacy because the conclusion relies on an undischarged assumption that the audience cannot accept without further argumentation. In the face of such an argument the arguer might just as well have merely asserted the conclusion. 1. Goal and thesis of the essay Goal: To provide an account of <b>the</b> fallacy of <b>begging</b> <b>the</b> question that both recognizes the circularity that is inherently present in any good argument (specifically a deductively valid argument), yet does not characterize all good arguments (specifically deductively valid arguments) as question <b>begging.</b> Thesis: <b>Begging</b> <b>the</b> question is an informal fallacy in that an argument and a context (hence the informality) must have the following characteristic: the conclusion depends upon an assumption that is not accepted by the audience without further argumentation. 2.

5|$|Alice, heavily {{pregnant}} with her third child, saw Louis depart to command the Hessian cavalry against the Prussians, and sent her children to stay with Queen Victoria in England. Despite her pregnancy, she performed the royal duties expected of her sex and station, making bandages for troops and preparing hospitals. On 11 July, {{she gave birth to}} Princess Irene; Prussian troops {{were on the verge of}} entering Darmstadt, she <b>begged</b> <b>the</b> Grand Duke to surrender on Prussia's terms. This provoked fury from the fiercely anti-Prussian Prince Alexander, but Alice realised that the conquered German states would likely form a union which she, like her sister Victoria, supported.|$|E
5|$|By {{now it was}} mid-August, {{more than}} three months since Shackleton had left Elephant Island. Shackleton <b>begged</b> <b>the</b> Chilean Government to lend him Yelcho, a small steam tug that had {{assisted}} Emma during the previous attempt. The Government agreed, and on 25 August Yelcho, captained by Luis Pardo, set out for Elephant Island. This time, as Shackleton records, providence favoured them. The seas were open, and the ship was able to approach close to the island, in thick fog. At 11:40 am on 30 August the fog lifted, the camp was spotted and, within an hour, all the Elephant Island party were safely aboard, bound for Punta Arenas.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth {{believed}} that her daughter's mere presence would help calm the opposition. Accompanied by Garai and a modest following, she and Mary {{set out for}} Đakovo. However, Elizabeth had seriously misjudged the situation. On 25 July 1386, they were ambushed en route and attacked by John Horvat in Gorjani. Their small entourage failed to fight off the attackers. Garai was killed by the rebels and his head was sent to Charles's widow Margaret, while the queens were imprisoned in the bishop of Zagreb's castle of Gomnec. Elizabeth took all blame for the rebellion and <b>begged</b> <b>the</b> attackers to spare her daughter's life.|$|E
5000|$|The {{idea that}} Moore <b>begs</b> <b>the</b> {{question}} (i.e. assumes the conclusion in a premise) was first raised by W. Frankena. Since analytic equivalency, for two objects X and Y, logically {{results in the}} question [...] "Is it true that X is Y?" [...] being meaningless (by Moore's own argument), {{to say that the}} question is meaningless is to concede analytic equivalency. Thus Moore <b>begs</b> <b>the</b> question in the second premise. He assumes that the question is a meaningful one (i.e. that it is an open question). This <b>begs</b> <b>the</b> question and the open-question argument thus fails.|$|R

The consul held an assembly and addressed his troops about the upcoming war. He then sent envoys to Eposognatus, chieftain of the Tectosagi, the only chieftain who was friendly with Pergamum. The envoys returned and replied that the chieftain of the Tectosagi <b>begged</b> <b>the</b> Romans not to invade his territory. He also claimed that he would attempt to force the submission of the other chieftains.|$|E
5|$|A {{different}} {{version of}} this tale narrates that when the youngest daughter-in-law was pregnant, she secretly ate the food-offerings ritually dedicated to Shashthi and then blamed the theft on the black cat. Angered by the dishonour of its mistress and the unjust accusation of theft, the cat pledged to teach the young mother a lesson. In {{this version of the}} tale, the cat not only stole her six children, but also ate them. But when the seventh child was born, the mother caught the cat fleeing with her child and followed it but tripped in middle of the chase and fainted. The cat took the infant to Shashthi's abode, where she told the goddess the whole tale of her insult. The benign goddess, however, was annoyed with the cat and rushed to the aid of the mother. The goddess explained the reason of her suffering, and after the mother had <b>begged</b> <b>the</b> cat for forgiveness and had sworn to worship Shashthi on anointed days, all seven of her children were returned to her.|$|E
5|$|At 10:23, {{the judge}} raised a {{security}} alarm. Judicial officers, {{and a federal}} police officer {{who was in the}} court building testifying in an unrelated case, arrived at the scene; however, during the ongoing commotion the police officer mistook Okaz for the attacker and shot him in the upper leg. Wiens collapsed and was apprehended after one of the judges pointed out that not Okaz but Wiens was the assailant. While under arrest, Wiens resisted and <b>begged</b> <b>the</b> police officer to shoot him dead. Okaz, critically wounded in the stabbing attack, was in a coma for two days. He was subsequently treated for several weeks in a hospital near Dresden for the stabbing and shooting injuries. El-Sherbini died in the court building at 11:07, succumbing to her injuries.|$|E

5|$|By midday, {{the crowds}} {{returned}} around St. Philip Neri's Church. General George Cadwalader ordered the crowds to disperse, {{but they did}} not. By the evening, the sheriff had arrived with a 150-strong posse. Throughout the evening, the military presence grew, and three cannons were stationed on the streets. The soldiers cleared the streets near the church, despite being pelted with rocks by the mob. In response to the rock throwers, General Cadwalader ordered a cannon to be fired at the crowd on Third Street. A man named Charles Naylor <b>begged</b> <b>the</b> general not to fire; he and several others were arrested and held within the church. By the morning of July 7, most of the soldiers had left, but the crowds returned, being led by an alderman and the sheriff, and demanded that the remaining guard release Naylor. Everyone except Naylor was released. The crowds grew, and a cannon was brought from a nearby wharf and used to threaten the church. After further negotiations, Naylor was released and carried home to cheers on people's shoulders.|$|E
5|$|The conversion, said Belhaven, {{would enable}} James Francis Edward's {{accession}} to the English throne upon William III's death. The Queen-Regent was not swayed by Belhaven's argument, so a compromise was reached: James Francis Edward, if he became King, {{would limit the}} number of Roman Catholic priests in England and promise not to tamper with the established Church of England. In exchange, the confederate Lords would do all in their power to block the passing of the Hanoverian succession in Scottish parliament. When, in March 1702, William III died, Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat, declared for James Francis Edward at Inverness. Soon after, Lovat travelled to the court-in-exile at Saint-Germain, and <b>begged</b> <b>the</b> Queen-Regent to allow her son to come to Scotland. Lovat intended to raise an army of 15,000 soldiers in Scotland, to seize the throne for James Francis Edward. Mary refused to part with James Francis Edward, and the rising failed. Mary's regency ceased with her son's reaching of the age of 16.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The aim of {{this paper}} is to make it clear how and why <b>begging</b> <b>the</b> {{question}} should be seen as a pragmatic fallacy which can only be properly evaluated in a context of dialogue. Included in the paper is a review of the contemporary literature on <b>begging</b> <b>the</b> question that shows the gradual emergence over the past twenty years or so of the dialectical conception of this fallacy. A second aim of the paper is to investigate a number of general problems raised by the pragmatic framework. In this paper, it is shown that the methods required to analyze and evaluate criticisms of <b>begging</b> <b>the</b> question are practical, and come under the heading of logical pragmatics, which is concerned with the use of propositions by an arguer to convince, persuade, or refute an-other arguer in a context of dialogue. However, certain parts of these methods also have to do with logical semantics, which is concerned with relationships between the truth and falsehood of propositions, and with logical reasoning, which is concerned with diagramming the structure of sequences of arguments. To begin with, it is clear that <b>begging</b> <b>the</b> question is not a fallacy that can, at least straightforwardly, be modelled in a deductive logic of propositions. For the circular argument form, `A, therefore A', is deductively valid. The recent literature on <b>begging</b> <b>the</b> question, out-lined in Section 1 below, has concentrated on examining syllogisms and other familiar forms of deductively valid argument, in an attempt to get a grasp of just what is wrong with question-begging arguments. These articles are shown in the account below to have posed the prob-lem: What is the context of argument in which <b>begging</b> <b>the</b> question makes sense as a fallacy? Subsequently, one stream of the literature followed the lead of Ham-blin (1970, 1971), who advocated the formal game of dialogue as the right sort of context to model <b>begging</b> <b>the</b> question as a fallacy. But this literature became problematic when it was discovered that circular sequences of argumentation could be constructed in formal games o...|$|R
