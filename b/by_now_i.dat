In 1979, Wigner {{married his}} third wife, Eileen Clare-Patton (Pat) Hamilton, {{the widow of}} {{physicist}} Donald Ross Hamilton, the Dean of the Graduate School at Princeton University, {{who had died in}} 1972. In 1992, at the age of 90, he published his memoirs, The Recollections of Eugene P. Wigner with Andrew Szanton. In it, Wigner said: [...] "The full meaning of life, the collective meaning of all human desires, is fundamentally a mystery beyond our grasp. As a young man, I chafed at this state of affairs. But <b>by</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> have made peace with it. I even feel a certain honor to be associated with such a mystery." [...] In his collection of essays Symmetries and Reflections – Scientific Essays (1995), he commented: [...] "It was not possible to formulate the laws of quantum mechanics in a fully consistent way without reference to consciousness." ...|$|E

Cahan, recalled in his 1992 memoir (by then he was a globally recognised medical expert on cancer) what happened next in 1952:She was admitted to New York Hospital [...] Her doctors were puzzled by what was described in the press as [...] "a liver problem," [...] and suspected {{that she might have}} cancer. Hearing this, and without Gertrude's knowledge, her husband consulted me. Not wanting to alarm her by appearing in person (she knew, of course, that <b>by</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> was a cancer specialist), I sent some of my colleagues as consultants. They, too, were puzzled, and ordered an exploratory laparotomy (abdominal operation).|$|E
