40|$|Abstract. Hydrostatic Curves {{is widely}} used to {{calculate}} vessel’s displacement by ship’s officers and surveyors. However, under some specific circumstances such as light ballast arrival condition, {{it is difficult to}} obtain an accurate figure of displacement by using Hydrostatic curves. At this time, <b>Bonjean</b> <b>curves</b> as an alternative can be employed in calculating vessel’s displacement. The procedures are introduced step by step to calculate the vessel’s displacement by Bonjean’s curves. The differences of calculation by two means are demonstrated on a specific bulk carrier and therewith the reasons are analyzed. Finally, the article appeals the detailed <b>Bonjean</b> <b>curves</b> shall be provided on board by shipyard for improving the accuracy of calculation...|$|E

In modern shipbuilding industry, longitudinal gravity launching method is suitable for most kinds of ships, and is still widely used in many shipyards. Exactly calculation of the ship’s floating state and force acting on the hull and sliders is very important for security of launching ships. The present paper investigated the floating state and hydrostatic force and moment acting on a multi-purpose cargo ship based on some useful data such as <b>Bonjean</b> <b>curves,</b> distribution of ship mass, coefficients of ship form and arrangement of slipway. The variations of buoyancy and draughts at bow and stern with slipping distance are calculated and compared for two cases...|$|E
