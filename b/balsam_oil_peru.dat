The family name, from the type genus Dipterocarpus, is derived from Greek (di = two, pteron = wing and karpos = fruit) and refers to the two-winged fruit. The largest genera are Shorea (196 species), Hopea (104 species), Dipterocarpus (70 species), and Vatica (65 species). Many are large forest emergent species, typically reaching heights of 40-70 m, some even over 80 m (in the genera Dryobalanops, Hopea and Shorea), with the tallest known living specimen (Shorea faguetiana) 93.0 m tall. The species of this family are of major importance in the timber trade. Their distribution is pantropical, from northern South America to Africa, the Seychelles, India, Indochina, Indonesia and Malaysia. The greatest diversity of Dipterocarpaceae occurs in Borneo.

40|$|Fragrances and {{flavouring}} substances {{are defined by}} their action on the human sense. The flavouring effect of a substance is determined by its impact on membrane receptors of the human gustatory and olfactory systems. The partial or complete saturation of these receptors provides the physiologic response to a flavouring agent. Fragrances may be natural, such as <b>balsams,</b> essential <b>oil,</b> concretes or absolutes, and synthetic. Because of {{the widespread use of}} the fragrances in a large variety of consumer products, ranging from foods to perfumes to cosmetics to skin products, it is important to examine the effects for humans due to exposure to these materials. Among the potential risks of the fragrances exposure, the genotoxic effect is of particular interest, considering that DNA-damage, at gene or chromosomal levels, can result in adverse effects, such as cancer and germ cell alteration. Also, the potential protective properties of the fragrances are of interest because of their widespread exposure and the easy availability. In our previous studies, the mutagenic (to define the safety profile) and antimutagenic, (to investigate the protective properties) activity of two natural fragrances, β-caryophyllene and β-caryophyllene oxide, and a synthetic one, α-hexyl cinnamaldheyde, has been investigated. All substances showed to possess interesting antimutagenic activity in our experiments, carried out by the Ames test. Preliminary study demonstrated that β-caryophyllene, β-caryophyllene oxide and α-hexyl cinnamaldheyde reduce the mutagenic effect of CSC (condensate smoke cigarettes). Moreover, β-caryophyllene was able to inhibit ethyl methanesulfonate-induced clastogenicity in cultured human lymphocytes (Micronucleus assay). Moreover, a previous published paper (Legault and Pichette, 2010. Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, 59 : 1643 – 1647) indicated that β-caryophyllene potentiated the anticancer activity of paclitaxel on MCF- 7, DLD- 1 and L- 929 cell lines. Furthemore, β-caryophyllene oxide has shown to induce the apoptosis in PC- 3 and MCF- 7 cells (Park et al., 2011. Cancer Letters 312 : 178 – 188). In line with these data, the aim of this research project is to study the potential anticancer activity of β-caryophyllene, β-caryophyllene oxide and α-hexyl cinnamaldheyde against different tumor cells. Also, the combination of these substances with anticancer agents will be investigated because they could work as synergist. Finally, the potential mechanism of action of these compounds will be examined...|$|R

60|$|Heat {{promotes}} Fluidity {{very much}} by diminishing the Tenacity of Bodies. It makes many Bodies fluid {{which are not}} fluid in cold, and increases the Fluidity of tenacious Liquids, as of <b>Oil,</b> <b>Balsam,</b> and Honey, and thereby decreases their Resistance. But it decreases not the Resistance of Water considerably, as it would do if any considerable part of the Resistance of Water arose from the Attrition or Tenacity of its Parts. And therefore the Resistance of Water arises principally and almost entirely from the Vis inertiæ of its Matter; and by consequence, if the Heavens were as dense as Water, {{they would not have}} much less Resistance than Water; if as dense as Quick-silver, they would not have much less Resistance than Quick-silver; if absolutely dense, or full of Matter without any Vacuum, let the Matter be never so subtil and fluid, they would have a greater Resistance than Quick-silver. A solid Globe in such a Medium would lose above half its Motion in moving three times the length of its Diameter, and a Globe not solid (such as are the Planets,) would be retarded sooner. And therefore {{to make way for the}} regular and lasting Motions of the Planets and Comets, it's necessary to empty the Heavens of all Matter, except perhaps some very thin Vapours, Steams, or Effluvia, arising from the Atmospheres of the Earth, Planets, and Comets, and from such an exceedingly rare Æthereal Medium as we described above. A dense Fluid can be of no use for explaining the Phænomena of Nature, the Motions of the Planets and Comets being better explain'd without it. It serves only to disturb and retard the Motions of those great Bodies, and make the Frame of Nature languish: And in the Pores of Bodies, it serves only to stop the vibrating Motions of their Parts, wherein their Heat and Activity consists. And as it is of no use, and hinders the Operations of Nature, and makes her languish, so there is no evidence for its Existence, and therefore it ought to be rejected. And if it be rejected, the Hypotheses that Light consists in Pression or Motion, propagated through such a Medium, are rejected with it.|$|R

The principal compounds responsible for propolis bioactivities are flavonoids and phenolic compounds, but very often different propolis types have distinct main bioactive compounds. Propolis value is still poorly acknowledged by the Portuguese beekeepers, generally constituting a by-product that is discarded during hive management, and only recently Portuguese propolis has started to be investigated. It is our goal to contribute to the evaluation of its chemical diversity and biological activities. The study here reported concerns specifically with the evaluation of propolis phytotoxic effects envisaging its potential economic valorization as a bioherbicide. Phytotoxic effects of n-hexane (HE) and ethanol (EE) extracts obtained from propolis samples collected in two apiaries (Côa – C, Pereiro - P) in the east-central region of Portugal, were tested in plantlets of flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) grown in vitro. Results shown that both samples and types of extracts impaired plant growth but specific differences were detected: all treatments inhibited root growth but P samples, in particular HE. P, were much more effective than C ones, and while HE did not affect epicotyl and hypocotyl growth, EE, in particular EE. P, strongly inhibited their growth. Total polyphenols and flavonoids quantification revealed that EE. P has higher contents than EE.
