5|$|At {{some point}} in the future, IK Pegasi A will consume the {{hydrogen}} fuel at its core and start to evolve away from the main sequence to form a red giant. The envelope of a red giant can grow to significant dimensions, extending up to a hundred times its previous radius (or larger).

5|$|Michaud {{suggests}} that an interstellar grouping of civilizations might {{take the form}} of an empire, which need not necessarily be a force for evil, but may provide for peace and security throughout its jurisdiction. Owing to the distances <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars,</b> such an empire would not necessarily maintain control solely by military force, but may rather tolerate local cultures and institutions to the extent that these would not pose a threat to the central imperial authority. Such tolerance may, as has happened historically on Earth, extend to allowing nominal self-rule of specific regions by existing institutions, while maintaining that area as a puppet or client state to accomplish the aims of the imperial power. However, particularly advanced powers may use methods, including faster-than-light travel, to make centralized administration more effective.|$|E
5|$|The space <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> in the M87 {{galaxy is}} filled with a diffuse {{interstellar}} medium of gas, which has been chemically enriched by the elements ejected from stars as they passed beyond {{the end of their}} main sequence lifetime. Carbon and nitrogen are continuously supplied by intermediate mass stars as they pass through the asymptotic giant branch. The heavier elements from oxygen to iron are primarily produced by supernova explosions within the galaxy. About 60% of the abundance of these heavy elements was produced by core-collapse supernovae, while the remainder came from Type Ia supernovae. The distribution of these elements suggests that early enrichment was from core-collapse supernovae. The contribution from these sources was much lower in abundance than in the Milky Way. Type Ia supernovae have provided a continuous contribution to the interstellar medium of M87 throughout the history of the galaxy.|$|E

5|$|French {{astronomer}} Charles Messier discovered M87 in 1781, cataloguing it as a nebulous feature while {{searching for}} objects that would confuse comet hunters. The second brightest galaxy within the northern Virgo Cluster, M87 is located about 16.4 million parsecs (53.5 million light-years) from Earth. Unlike a disk-shaped spiral galaxy, M87 has no distinctive dust lanes. Instead, {{it has an}} almost featureless, ellipsoidal shape typical of most giant elliptical galaxies, diminishing in luminosity with distance from the centre. Forming around one sixth of M87's mass, the stars in this galaxy have a nearly spherically symmetric distribution, their density decreasing with increasing distance from the core. At the core is an active supermassive black hole, which forms the primary component of an active galactic nucleus. This object is a strong source of multiwavelength radiation, particularly radio waves. M87's galactic envelope extends out to a radius of about 150 kiloparsecs (490,000 light-years), {{where it has been}} truncated—possibly by an encounter with another galaxy. <b>Between</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> is a diffuse interstellar medium of gas that has been chemically enriched by elements emitted from evolved stars.|$|E
