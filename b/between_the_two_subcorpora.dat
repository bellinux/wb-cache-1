40|$|The paper {{illustrates}} {{the important role}} played by vague expressions in native speaker communicative competence and investigates {{the use of a}} particular type of vague expressions, general extenders - like ‘and so on’, ‘or something’, ‘etcetera’ - in <b>two</b> <b>subcorpora</b> of 62 EU parliamentary debates comprising native English and non-native English. Results show that by far the most frequent general extenders occurring in <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>subcorpora</b> are ‘and so on’ and ‘etcetera’, which Overstreet (1999) has found to be typical of formal settings. In keeping with Terraschke and Holmes (2007), who investigated the use of general extenders in conversations, this study shows that general extenders have similar functions in <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>subcorpora.</b> From a formal point of view, the form [adjectives + general extender] appears exclusively in the native subcorpus, albeit in three cases, which may indicate a greater conformity to the norm on the part of non-native speakers...|$|R

Making reference to recent studies which underline the potential of corpus linguistic methodologies for the study of language as a social phenomenon, this dissertation focuses on word meaning (some of the words analysed are 'international' and 'quality') in a small specialized corpus consisting of the About us section of 340 British and Indian university websites.

40|$|The ALesKo learner corpus is a {{small-scale}} comparable corpus {{consisting of}} two subcorpora: annotated essays by advanced Chinese learners of German and comparable essays by German native speakers. The motivation for its compilation was the investigation of discourse-related phenomena such as local coherence in second-language acquisition of German. After introducing how the texts were compiled and annotated, the article focuses on quantitative studies at the token level. We discuss problems of tokenisation and part-of-speech tagging and compare the inventory of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>subcorpora</b> in terms of frequently used N-grams and lexical richness, among other aspects.

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the sociocognitive approach to Terminology pioneered by Temmerman (2000) this paper aims at comparing the use of lexical metaphors in a bilingual comparable corpus of criminal judgments in Spanish and Italian. The objectives of this contrastive study are twofold: on the one hand, to identify differences and similarities in the frequency and typology of some metaphorical expressions used in Spanish and Italian criminal judgments, and, on the other hand, to show the crucial role played by metaphorical thinking in this specific subgenre of judicial texts. The comparable corpus has approximately 480, 000 tokens and is made up by <b>two</b> <b>subcorpora</b> (Spanish and Italian) of judgments delivered by the Supreme Courts in both countries (Tribunal Supremo and Corte di Cassazione). As far as methodology is concerned, corpus analysis was conducted using version 5 of the WordSmith Tools software. First wordlists of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>subcorpora</b> were used to identify keywords, extracted using two reference corpora. Second, KWIC concordances were run to investigate use and typology in greater detail and infer metaphorical uses from collocational information. By concordancing most of the keywords, the existence of linguistic metaphors that realized particular conceptual metaphors was established. Finally, lexical metaphors were classified according to a number of source and target domains. The paper applies this methodology to a select group of metaphorical realizations from both corpora, showing the empirical importance of evidence of metaphorical reasoning influencing the lexicon of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> judicial systems...|$|R
40|$|Corporate social {{responsibility}} (CSR) has recently become a fashionable {{item on the}} corporate agenda, and a central plank of corporate communication (Goodman, 2000; Christensen, 2002). Traditionally, companies {{have been involved in}} disseminating detailed information about their performance, goals, priorities and developments. Nowadays, however, firms have embarked on more frequent and ambitious initiatives focussed on issues such as sustainability, ethics and CSR (Lantos, 2001; Dahlsrud, 2006), which are commonly ascribed to the public, institutional and not-for-profit sectors. Firms’ pledge of support for economic development, environmental preservation and community welfare has evolved into a promotional strategy adopted in business settings to reinforce actors’ positive image, increase credibility, and gain consumers’ confidence. In <b>the</b> automobile industry <b>two</b> leading companies are exemplars of the integration of long-term social and environmental aspects into their business and (self-) promotional activities, Fiat and Toyota. The aim of the paper is to examine a small database of CSR reports and to identify some of the core sustainability-oriented values. With the support of corpus linguistics tools (Sinclair, 2003, 2004) and the software package WordSmith Tools 4. 0 (Scott, 2004), <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>subcorpora</b> of documents published by Fiat and Toyota are analysed both quantitatively and qualitatively. The study of wordlists, key-words and their phraseological patterns (e. g. environmental, employees, safety, energy, training, recycling, research) highlights some argumentative strategies adopted by <b>the</b> <b>two</b> manufacturers to demonstrate their accountability to stakeholders, and sheds some light on the crucial role played by CSR in corporate communication...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} use of tag {{questions}} (TQs) in British English fiction dialogue by making comparisons to spoken conversation. Data has been retrieved from <b>two</b> <b>subcorpora</b> of <b>the</b> British National Corpus (BNC) : a Fiction Subcorpus and the demographic part of the spoken component. More than 2, 500 TQs have been analysed for their formal features and more than 600 TQs also for their pragmatic functions. The results show that declarative tag questions (DecTQs) are underrepresented in fiction dialogue, whereas imperative tag questions (ImpTQs) are overrepresented. Moreover, several differences <b>between</b> <b>the</b> formal features and pragmatic functions of TQs in fiction dialogue and spoken conversation have been reported. In fiction, reporting clauses and comments in the narrative provide the reader with information the author believes the reader needs to interpret the dialogue {{in the way the}} author has intended; hence, fiction dialogue is enriched with information which is useful in the analysis of a linguistic phenomenon such as the TQ. For the functional analysis of TQs, a hierarchical model has been developed and applied. Most DecTQs turn out to be used rhetorically; only a minority are response-eliciting and, in fiction dialogue, a small number also exchange goods and services. The functional patterns for DecTQs are quite different in <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>subcorpora.</b> Most rhetorical DecTQs are addressee-oriented in fiction dialogue, but speaker-centred in spoken conversation. Among the response-eliciting DecTQs, there are similar proportions of confirmation-seeking DecTQs, but, in fiction dialogue, there are proportionately more confirmation-demanding DecTQs, and also a few conversation-initiating DecTQs. All ImpTQs exchange goods and services; in fiction dialogue, there is a higher proportion of ImpTQs used as commands, and a lower proportion of ImpTQs providing advice. The distinctive functional patterns for TQs in fiction dialogue seem largely due to the depiction of problems, conflicts and confrontations and an avoidance of conversations on trivial matters. In fiction dialogue, authors utilize the full potential of DecTQs, which results in large formal and functional variation, whereas they tend to prefer the most conventional form of ImpTQs. Differences <b>between</b> <b>the</b> functional patterns of TQs in fiction dialogue and spoken conversation may partly explain the differences in frequencies and formal features...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, I {{examine whether}} the {{variation}} patterns of haber pluralization (e. g., hubo/hubieron fiestas ‘there was/were parties’) in Peninsular Spanish corroborate the hypothesis elaborated in earlier work that the phenomenon constitutes a competition <b>between</b> <b>two</b> variants of <b>the</b> presentational construction with haber that is constrained by domain-general cognitive constraints on spreading activation. In addition, this paper examines whether haber pluralization is incrementing in frequency in particular Peninsular regions {{and whether or}} not the phenomenon is spreading geographically. To meet these objectives, I analyze a dataset of more than 7, 500 cases of haber + plural NP, which were culled from two publicly available data sources: the Corpus Oral y Sonoro del Español Rural (which represents only rural speakers born before the 1940 s; Fernández-Ordóñez, 2005 -) and Twitter (which represents mainly young and middle-aged speakers). The results of a mixed-effects logistic regression analysis that tests the effects of tense, the absence/presence of negation, typical action- chain position of the noun, the regional origin of the examples, and the data sources support that haber pluralization constitutes a competition between two presentational haber constructions that is constrained by domain-general cognitive constraints on spreading activation. This model also supports that pluralized haber is spreading westward from its epicenters (Valencia, Barcelona, and Murcia), while also incrementing in frequency in northern, eastern and southern Spain. However, its frequency appears to be declining in central Spain. A geographically more detailed, but similar picture is obtained with three generalized additive mixed models that test the effects of geography on the total dataset as well as on each of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>subcorpora.</b> status: accepte...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study investigating the hypothesis that the recurrent features, or universals, of translated language are primarily the result of a mediation process that is shared among different kinds of mediated language, rather than the particularities of bilingual language processing. The investigation made use of a comparable corpus consisting of a subcorpus of English texts translated from Afrikaans, a subcorpus of comparable edited English texts, and a subcorpus of comparable unedited (and also untranslated) English texts. The frequency and distribution of linguistic features associated with three of the universals of translated language (explicitation, normalisation/conservatism, and simplification) across the three subcorpora were analysed. The study was guided by the hypothesis that the frequency and distribution of linguistic features associated with the universals of translated language would demonstrate similarities in <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>subcorpora</b> of mediated text (i. e., the translated and edited subcorpus), as compared to the subcorpus of unmediated text (i. e., the unedited subcorpus). However, the study yields almost no evidence for a mediation effect that is shared by translated and edited language, at least not along the linguistic features investigated. There is, however, evidence for {{what appears to be a}} separate translation-specific effect, which seems likely to be more unconscious, more proceduralised and more related to the linguistic level alone. This offers some support for the hypothesis of universals of translated language that are unique to this kind of text mediation specifically. Furthermore, the findings of the study suggest that editing may involve a different kind of mediation effect altogether, which frequently remains invisible in conventional corpus-based studies comparing translated and non-translated language, and which requires further investigation.

40|$|The present paper {{focuses on}} the way Europe is {{construed}} in a corpus of British and Italian TV news programmes. We focused of TV news programmes rather than on print media since, according to a Eurobarometer report (Eurobarometer 55, 2001), 67 % of EU citizens use television as primary source {{for information about the}} EU. News programmes were collected and orthographically transcribed from TG 1 and TG 5 in Italy at 20 h 00, and BBC 1 at 18 h 00 and ITV 1 at 18 h 30 in the UK from 12 February to 6 April 2007, as part of the IntUne project. Starting from previous studies focusing on the structure of TV news bulletins (Haarman and Lombardo 2009), a specific XML annotation was added to the texts in order to encode metadata relative to source, date, the structure of news stories and speaker information in order to make use of contextual information in the interpretation of linguistic data available through the corpus. The use of comparable corpora provides the means to carry out an analysis of media texts, building models bottom up from data rather than starting from a hypothesis, while still being able to look at the contexts of culture, the environment in which the text was produced, and the context of situation, the immediate environment of the language in use. This enables the researcher to generalise from the data whilst keeping in mind the dangers of making broad assumptions from a single textual context. Bearing these methodological premises in mind we analysed all the occurrences of Europe/Europa in <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>subcorpora,</b> highlighting how <b>the</b> term is highly polysemous shifting from a geographical space to a political, historical, and cultural unit. The analysis makes it possible to compare the differing perceptions of Europe reflected in British and Italian TV news programmes...|$|R
