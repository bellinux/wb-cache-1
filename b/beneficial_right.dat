5000|$|... • Ijara {{financing}} is a redeemable {{lease contract}} {{based on the}} Islamic principle of Ijara wa Iqtina, (lease to own). The process is simple: You identify a property and an independent Trust acquires it on your behalf and leases it back to you. You make monthly payments to the Trust that comprise of a Rent portion and an Acquisition payment. At {{the end of the}} contract term, the Trust transfers the house ownership to your name. You now own the property free and clear. The minimum down payment for Ijara contracts is typically 30%. Your payment on-account represents your <b>beneficial</b> <b>rights</b> in the property. Your monthly payments include rent and further payments on-account, thereby increasing your <b>beneficial</b> <b>rights.</b> You can acquire full title to the property when the sum of your payments on-account equals the original purchase price. The original purchase price is the goal toward which you are always working; we do not adjust it {{over the life of the}} lease. This eliminates gharar (doubtful practices), or any uncertainty when it comes to your financial arrangement.|$|R

Previously, the beneficial value was 100 percent. The purpose of this essay is to evaluate the relationship between the banks´ activities, and the new bill of beneficial rights, especially what the effects will become for the public companies within the printing houses, with 1 - 49 employees in the Skåne Region. The survey includes a total of 142 companies and it was distributed via e-mail. The conclusions from the study are that there are tendencies of increased difficulties for companies to get their credits granted by the banks. The study shows that credits, already granted requires an insurance, which increases the personal risk for the owners of the printing houses. The study can’t point out that companies must look for financial capital from other financial sources, however the findings indicate an increased amount of offers for leasing and/or factoring...|$|E

Clause 13.3 would usually be void for perpetuity because there was no statutory exemption in Jamaica to the common law rule. But with each new member, there was a new settlement, and each member was a life in being, so the termination of a new settlement could in fact be calculated, and so the scheme was in fact not void for perpetuity. The powers for the trustees to change the settlement’s terms were void for perpetuity, and so was the power for the widows to designate a beneficiary to receive benefits, because these were only contingent on termination of the plan itself which could occur more than 21 years after the death of any particular beneficiary. (The individual settlements were contingent on the death of each individual beneficiary under the scheme.)

40|$|Worldwide {{financial}} markets increasingly depend on structures that reduce risk by interposing intermediaries between investors {{and the companies}} obligated to pay them. This reduction of risk may be offset, however, by the risk that an intermediary will fail, and its creditors then will claim against assets held by the intermediary {{for the benefit of}} investors. If the intermediary holds assets solely in a custodial capacity, this risk traditionally is addressed by agency and trust law. What is novel, however, is that intermediaries in a wide rang of domestic and international dealings- including the trading of investment securities, the sale of loan participants, and securitization transactions- now hold assets in which they, as well as investors, share <b>beneficial</b> <b>rights.</b> The sharing of these rights creates significant uncertainty as to whether the intermediary 2 ̆ 7 s creditors can look to all those assets, or merely to the intermediary 2 ̆ 7 s interest therein, for repayment. This 2 ̆ 2 intermediary risk 2 ̆ 2 not only affects individual investors and increases transaction costs but also can be systematic: the failure of an intermediary may trigger a chain reaction of failures of investing institutions that contract with the intermediary. Moreover, the problem of the intermediary risk raises innovative legal issues that blur the boundaries between commercial law and property. This Article analyzes how legal systems worldwide should respond to this risk. If concludes that a uniform rule is needed to regulate intermediary risk in cross-border commercial and financial transactions, and it examines how such a rule should be implemented in an international law context...|$|R
50|$|Traded {{endowment}} policies (TEPs) {{or second}} hand endowment policies (SHEPs) are traditional with-profits endowments {{that have been}} sold to a new owner part way through their term. The TEP market enables buyers (investors) to buy unwanted endowment policies for more than the surrender value offered by the insurance company. Investors will pay more than the surrender value because the policy has greater value if it is kept in force than if it is terminated early. When a policy is sold, all <b>beneficial</b> <b>rights</b> on the policy are transferred to the new owner. The new owner takes on responsibility for future premium payments and collects the maturity value when the policy matures or the death benefit when the original life assured dies. Policyholders who sell their policies, no longer benefit from the life cover and should consider whether to take out alternative cover.The TEP market deals exclusively with Traditional With Profits policies. The easiest way of determining whether an endowment policy is in this category is to check to see whether it mentions units, indicating it is a Unitised With Profits or Unit Linked policy, if bonuses are in sterling {{and there is no}} mention of units then it is probably a traditional With Profits. The other types of policies - “Unit Linked” and “Unitised With Profits” have a performance factor which is dependent directly on current investment market conditions. These are not tradable as the guarantees on the policy are much lower and there is no gap between the surrender value and the market value.|$|R

As a case study, we analyze the security of a remote administration product called Absolute Manage.

Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to issue unauthorized commands on client systems and execute arbitrary code with administrator privileges. These blatant vulnerabilities suggest that remote administration tools require increased scrutiny from the security community.

40|$|Abstract: We {{study the}} {{allocation}} of property rights to individuals who may differ in their valuations of those rights and in their abilities to pay. Agents’ limited abilities to pay prevent them from achieving allocative efficiency through voluntary negotiation, so initial allocation of property rights matters. We show that non-market assignment of the rights, as simple as random rationing at below-market price, yields more efficient allocation than a competitive market if the rights are fully transferable. Further, need-based assignment schemes that favor the poor and merit-based schemes that favor those with high valuations are socially desirable. Conversely, if speculation is prevalent, it may be <b>beneficial</b> to render <b>rights</b> inalienable (i. e., prohibit transferability). Our result provides a potential rationale for government intervention of competitive markets and some implications for limitations of market oriented assignment rules, {{in the presence of}} financing costs...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a comprehensive assessment of empirical {{evidence about the}} impact of financial globalization on growth and volatility in developing countries.

Empirically, good institutions and quality of governance are crucial in helping developing countries derive the benefits of globalization. Similarly, macroeconomic stability appears to be an important prerequisite for ensuring that financial globalization is beneficial for developing countries. Finally, countries that employ relatively flexible exchange rate regimes and succeed in maintaining fiscal discipline are more likely to enjoy the potential growth and stabilization benefits of financial globalization. ...|$|R

Overall, our results indicate that although these systems can improve awareness of some important product attributes, with this enhanced awareness comes a reduced awareness of other product characteristics. At worst, these systems actually appear to make the customer less informed, and result in negative assessments of the retailer...|$|R
