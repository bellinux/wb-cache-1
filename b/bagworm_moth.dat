40|$|Accurate {{identification}} of species is fundamental for biological research and necessary for species conservation. DNA barcoding is particularly useful when identification using morphological characteristics is laborious and/or unreliable. However, barcodes for species {{are dependent on}} the availability of reference sequences from correctly identified specimens. The traditional use of morphology to delimit the species boundaries of Finnish <b>bagworm</b> <b>moths</b> (Lepidoptera: Psychidae: Naryciinae: Dahliciini) is controversial because there is overlap in their morphological characteristics. In addition, there are no suitable molecular markers. We verified the delimitation of seven out of eight previously described taxa, by using the currently standardized COI barcode and phylogenetic inference based on fragments of mitochondrial (COI) and nuclear genes (MDH). Moreover, we compared the results of molecular methods with the outcome of geometric morphometrics. Based on molecular identification, our findings indicate that there are five sexual species (Dahlica and Siederia spp.) and two parthenogenetic species (D. fennicella and D. triquetrella) in Finland. We suggest that molecular methods, together with geometric morphometrics of male genitalia are an effective way of delimiting species of <b>bagworm</b> <b>moths...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{parasite}} hypothesis for sex {{is one of}} {{the many}} theories that have been suggested to solve the mystery of the widespread occurrence of sex despite its high short-term costs. It suggests that sexual lineages have an evolutionary advantage over parthenogens because they can frequently generate new genotypes that are temporarily less prone to coevolving parasites. In this study, we looked for further supporting evidence for the parasite hypothesis of sex in an attempt to understand the coexistence of sexual and parthenogenetic <b>bagworm</b> <b>moths</b> (Naryciinae). The <b>bagworm</b> <b>moths</b> and their parasitoids form one of the few natural host-parasite systems where sexual and parthenogenetic hosts are apparently not separated by ecological or geographical barriers. Furthermore, in support of the parasite hypothesis for sex, parthenogenetic presence is negatively correlated with parasitism rate. We specifically tested, by identifying the reproductive mode of the parasitized individuals, whether parasitoids preferentially attack the parthenogens in sites with both sexual and parthenogenetic forms, as predicted by the parasite hypothesis. We collected hosts from sites with different frequencies of parthenogenetic and sexual moths. A DNA barcoding approach was used to determine the reproductive mode of the parasitized hosts. Furthermore, we investigated whether differences in host and parasitoid phenology could provide an alternative explanation for the variation in parasitism rates between parthenogens and sexuals. Our results contradict the prediction of the parasite hypothesis because parthenogenetic <b>bagworm</b> <b>moths</b> were less parasitized than sexuals in sympatric sites. Our findings can be explained by differences in phenology between the parthenogenetic and sexual moths rather than genetic incompatibility between parthenogenetic hosts and parasitoids. The stable coexistence of sexual and parthenogenetic Naryciinae despite the many apparent costs of sex in this system remains a mystery. Our work adds to the list of studies were the assumptions of the parasite hypothesis for sex are not all met. Â© 2012 European Society For Evolutionary Biology...|$|R

In addition, he studies cognitive abilities, with reference to short-intervaljudgment, in human subjects. He also studied cognitive abilities involving case constructionbehavior in a species of <b>bagworm</b> <b>moth.</b> He demonstrated alteration in temporal organizationin human subjects, who carry out rotational shift duties. He reported disruption of circadianrhythm in cognitive judgment of short-time intervals in shift workers. He proposed a model foroptimization of human shift work. He reported that shift work might reduce humanlongevity. He reported disruption of circadian clock in cancer patients and suggestedimplementation of patient-specific chronotherapeutic protocol. He demonstrated functionalcircadian oscillators in cave fish and reinterpreted findings of others {{to rule out the}} hypothesisof clock regression in hypogean fish. He reported rhythmic pattern in case architecture ofbagworm moth. He proposed a model illustrating the ability of this moth to process thornlength and distance signals hierarchically during case construction through toggling itspreference between thorns and cut-twigs.https://web.archive.org/web/20111117034820/http://www.prsu.ac.in/lifescience.htm ...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{species diversity}} {{and evolution of}} parthenogenesis among <b>bagworm</b> <b>moth</b> species of Dahlica and Siederia using mitochondrial DNA sequencing. Parthenogenesis is rare among Lepidoptera other than Psychidae. Genera Dahlica and Siederia form a confusing group with controversial species boundaries and widely overlapping morphological features that make species determination difficult. We evaluated the reliability of species determination based on wing scale morphology by comparing it with a phylogenetic tree obtained using mtDNA. Species determination based on morphological characteristics did not correspond to species determination based on mtDNA markers. On {{the basis of the}} molecular phylogeny, the status of these two genera is questionable. Our results indicate that parthenogenetic D. fennicella, D. triquetrella and D. lichenella evolved independently from different sexual ancestors suggesting that asexual reproduction is favoured in this group...|$|E
40|$|Douglas W. TallamyThe {{proliferation}} of alien plants and their widespread replacement of native plants {{is predicted to}} negatively affect the insect community. Conservation biocontrol seeks to protect natural enemies, such as predators and parasitoids, through methods such as habitat management, in which plants are used to provide necessary resources to natural enemies. Native plants may support a stronger population of natural enemies than exotic plants. <b>Bagworm</b> and polyphemus <b>moth</b> larvae were placed in alien and native plant plots, and their survival was tracked until pupation. It was predicted that plots planted with native plants would have enhanced natural enemy communities, resulting in increased mortality in caterpillar larvae. Thus, larval survival {{would serve as a}} relative measure of the natural enemy community in plots planted with alien plants versus plots planted with native plants. No difference was found between the survival of bagworm larvae between alien and native plots. Almost no difference was found in the survival of polyphemus larvae, though the polyphemus moth experiment may have been confounded by differing rates of growth based on food plant.

40|$|Both {{ecological}} and genetic mechanisms {{have been proposed}} to explain patterns of herbivore attack on interspecific plant hybrids, but distinguishing among them can be difficult in natural hybrid zones. We performed a common-garden experiment to evaluate four genetic hypotheses: dominance, additivity, elevated hybrid susceptibility, and elevated hybrid resistance. Censuses and cage experiments were used to compare insect responses to basin big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata spp. tridentata), mountain big sagebrush (A. t. vaseyana), and their F 2 progeny. After two growing seasons, hybrid shrubs resembled mountain big sagenbrush in size, but were more similar to basin big sagebrush in flower production. Censuses of naturally colonizing insects (the gall midge Rhopalomyia obovata, the <b>bagworm</b> <b>moth</b> Apterona helix, and the aphid Obtusicauda coweni) tended to support the dominance hypothesis: if the insect clearly discriminated between the two parents, its frequency on hybrids closely resembled that {{on one of the}} parents. Moreover, colonization of hybrids in all three cases suggested a dominance deviation toward the susceptible parent rather than toward the resistant parent. In contrast to the censuses, cage experiments involving two insects supported the hybrid-susceptibility hypothesis; both survival and growth of the grasshopper Melanoplus sanguinipes and growth of the leaf beetle Trirhabda pilosa were higher on hybrid shrubs than on either parent. Because many secondary compounds have been determined to occur at intermediate concentrations in F 2 shrubs, dominance for susceptibility may indicate that insects respond to plant traits (e. g., oviposition stimulants and deterrents) in a threshold manner. Mechanisms underlying increased hybrid susceptibility are less clear, but our experimental design makes environmental explanations (e. g., the plant-stress hypothesis) unlikely. Although we eliminated several confounding factors, our results agree with the conclusion from natural hybrid zones that insect responses to hybrid plants are likely to be idiosyncratic; even congeneric species did not respond similarly to hybrid and parental plants...|$|E
