5|$|Emerald ash borer {{primarily}} infest and {{can cause}} significant damage to ash species including green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), <b>black</b> <b>ash</b> (Fraxinus nigra), white ash (Fraxinus americana), and blue ash (Fraxinus quadrangulata) in North America. In Europe, Fraxinus excelsior is the main ash species colonized by EAB. Ash susceptibility can vary due to the attractiveness of chemical volatiles to adults, or the ability of larvae to detoxify phenolic compounds. Emerald ash borer has also been found infesting white fringe tree in North America, which is a non-ash host, but {{it is unclear whether}} the trees were healthy when first infested, or were already in decline due to drought.|$|E

Ten shrub species also grow near the lake. These include three dogwood species, two holly species, multiflora rose, Morrow's honeysuckle, speckled alder, spicebush, and mayberry. Eighteen species of herbs live on the lake, as well. Five of these species are sedges. Cattails and beds of grass grow along the shores of Lake Chillisquaque. Additionally, a sizable population of Rotala ramosior grows on the lake.|$|E

500|$|Green ash and <b>black</b> <b>ash</b> {{trees are}} {{preferred}} by emerald ash borer. White ash is also killed rapidly, but usually only after all green and <b>black</b> <b>ash</b> trees are eliminated. Blue ash displays some {{resistance to the}} emerald ash borer by forming callus tissue around emerald ash borer galleries, but is eventually killed. Many of the specialized predators and parasitoids that suppressed emerald ash borer in Asia were not present in North America. Predators and parasitoids native to North America do not sufficiently suppress emerald ash borer, so populations continue to grow. Emerald ash borer populations can spread between [...] a year. It primarily spreads through flight or by transportation of ash bark containing products such as firewood or nursery stock, which allows it to reach new areas and create satellite populations outside of the main infestation.|$|E

40|$|This {{study focused}} on removal of color, COD, and lignin in {{wastewater}} of pulp and paper mill using white wood <b>ash</b> and <b>black</b> wood <b>ash</b> that generated from boilers unit in the pulp and paper mill. Batch experiments were setup for studying the equilibrium time, pH, quantity of wood ash and adsorption isotherm. The results from the equilibrium time experiment concluded that the equilibrium time of the white wood ash is much more rapid than the <b>black</b> wood <b>ash</b> indicated as 2 minutes and 25 minutes, respectively. The effect of pH on the removal of such studied parameters was different for the white and <b>black</b> wood <b>ash.</b> Variation in pH of wastewater at the levels of 2 to 10 had no influence in removal of color (89 - 93 %), COD (66 - 70 %) and lignin (78 - 82 %) when white wood ash was used, whereas the effect of pH on the removal was evident when using <b>black</b> wood <b>ash.</b> The highest removal of color (42. 2 %), lignin (31. 1 %) and COD (29. 7 %) was found when the initial pH was adjusted to 2 and such removal was gradually decreased when pH was raised. The optimum dose of white wood ash for the highest removal efficiency was 20 g ash /L of wastewater. This amount of wood ash can remove color 95 %, lignin 80 % and COD 69 %. The reason for high removal efficiency of white wood ash might occur from the precipitation of lignin by CaO which is the major component of the <b>ash.</b> For the <b>black</b> wood <b>ash,</b> the optimum dose was calculated from the isotherm equation of adsorption, both by Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm. These isotherms were applicable to color and lignin, while they were inapplicable to COD. The isotherm for adsorption of color and lignin indicate that the removal mechanism by <b>black</b> wood <b>ash</b> {{was likely to be}} physical adsorption. The results indicated that the white wood ash was better than the <b>black</b> wood <b>ash</b> in treating the pulp and paper wastewater...|$|R

[...] Unusual plants include the first spring-blooming plant, skunk cabbage, often blooming so early that temperatures are still freezing and snow may still be on the ground. [...] As the name implies, they have a disagreeable odor except to the various insects that prefer to feed on rotting flesh or dung. By consuming carbohydrates stored in its fleshy roots, skunk cabbages can maintain a temperature inside the spathe that is 15–35 degrees warmer than the surrounding air temperature. The warmth helps attract cold-blooded, early-emerging pollinating insects during early spring when temperatures are still chilly. [...] As the spathe dies back the large, showy leaves emerge which die back by mid-August, making the plant difficult to find in late summer. Other wild flowers include wild ginger, trout lilies, anemones, marsh marigold and various ferns and sedges.
