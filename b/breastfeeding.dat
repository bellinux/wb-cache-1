5|$|<b>Breastfeeding</b> causes {{negative}} feedback to occur on pulse secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Depending {{on the strength}} of the {{negative feedback}}, <b>breastfeeding</b> women may experience complete suppression of follicular development, but no ovulation, or normal menstrual cycle may resume. Suppression of ovulation is more likely when suckling occurs more frequently. The production of prolactin in response to suckling is important to maintaining lactational amenorrhea. On average, women who are fully <b>breastfeeding</b> whose infants suckle frequently experience a return of menstruation at fourteen and a half months postpartum. There is a wide range of response among individual <b>breastfeeding</b> women, however, with some experiencing return of menstruation at two months and others remaining amenorrheic for up to 42 months postpartum.|$|E
5|$|If a {{woman is}} untreated, two years of <b>breastfeeding</b> results in an HIV/AIDS risk in her baby of about 17%. Treatment {{decreases}} this risk to 1 to 2% per year. Due to the increased risk of death without <b>breastfeeding</b> in many areas in the developing world, the World Health Organization recommends either: (1) the mother and baby being treated with antiretroviral medication while <b>breastfeeding</b> being continued (2) the provision of safe formula.|$|E
5|$|Programs {{to prevent}} the {{vertical}} transmission of HIV (from mothers to children) can reduce rates of transmission by 92–99%. This primarily {{involves the use of}} a combination of antiviral medications during pregnancy and after birth in the infant and potentially includes bottle feeding rather than <b>breastfeeding.</b> If replacement feeding is acceptable, feasible, affordable, sustainable, and safe, mothers should avoid <b>breastfeeding</b> their infants; however exclusive <b>breastfeeding</b> is recommended during the first months of life if this is not the case. If exclusive <b>breastfeeding</b> is carried out, the provision of extended antiretroviral prophylaxis to the infant decreases the risk of transmission. In 2015, Cuba became the first country in the world to eradicate mother-to-child transmission of HIV.|$|E

25|$|Breast {{augmentation}} surgery generally {{does not}} interfere with future ability to <b>breastfeed.</b> Breast reduction surgery more frequently leads to decreased sensation in the nipple-areola complex, and to low milk supply in women who choose to <b>breastfeed.</b> Implants can interfere with mammography (breast x-rays images).|$|R

5|$|The lactational {{amenorrhea}} method {{involves the}} use of a woman's natural postpartum infertility which occurs after delivery and may be extended by <b>breastfeeding.</b> This usually requires the presence of no periods, exclusively <b>breastfeeding</b> the infant, and a child younger than six months. The World Health Organization states that if <b>breastfeeding</b> is the infant's only source of nutrition, the failure rate is 2% in the six months following delivery. Six uncontrolled studies of lactational amenorrhea method users found failure rates at 6 months postpartum between 0% and 7.5%. Failure rates increase to 4–7% at one year and 13% at two years. Feeding formula, pumping instead of nursing, the use of a pacifier, and feeding solids all increase its failure rate. In those who are exclusively <b>breastfeeding,</b> about 10% begin having periods before three months and 20% before six months. In those who are not <b>breastfeeding,</b> fertility may return four weeks after delivery.|$|E
5|$|Oxytocin (OXT) {{deficiency}} generally causes few symptoms, {{as it is}} only {{required at}} the time of childbirth and <b>breastfeeding.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pregnant and <b>breastfeeding</b> women, {{who require}} 66% more daily iodine {{requirement}} than non-pregnant women, may still not be getting enough iodine. The World Health Organization recommends a daily intake of 250µg for pregnant and <b>breastfeeding</b> women. As many women will not achieve this from dietary sources alone, the American Thyroid Association recommends a 150µg daily supplement by mouth.|$|E
25|$|The Cuban {{constitution}} {{contains a}} provision that allows one hour per day to <b>breastfeed</b> for women who return to their jobs after giving birth. Cuba also operates regional maternity homes {{for women who are}} undergoing high-risk pregnancies; after giving birth, 80% of women in these facilities will <b>breastfeed.</b>|$|R
50|$|Alcohol {{use during}} {{pregnancy}} is does not effect {{the ability to}} <b>breastfeed</b> the infant. In addition, an infant may <b>breastfeed</b> even if the mother continues to consume alcohol after the birth. An infant born to a mother that has an alcohol dependency may go through alcohol withdrawal after the birth.|$|R
40|$|The thyroid and thyroid hormones {{are intimately}} {{connected}} with the maintenance of pregnancy and lactation. As such, any disorders of the thyroid {{can have an impact}} on women 2 ̆ 7 s ability to <b>breastfeed.</b> In addition, some thyroid disorders that occur in the postnatal period can be misinterpreted as postnatal depression or other illnesses. In the past, the need to take certain thyroid medications meant that mothers were instructed not to <b>breastfeed</b> for fear of disrupting the thyroid function of their babies. Newer and safer drugs to treat thyroid disorders now mean that mothers can safely continue to <b>breastfeed...</b>|$|R

5|$|Prevention {{includes}} {{hand washing}} with soap, drinking clean water, proper disposal of human waste, and <b>breastfeeding</b> babies {{instead of using}} formula. The rotavirus vaccine is recommended in children. Treatment involves getting enough fluids. For mild or moderate cases, this can typically be achieved by drinking oral rehydration solution (a combination of water, salts, and sugar). In those who are breast fed, continued <b>breastfeeding</b> is recommended. For more severe cases, intravenous fluids may be needed. Fluids may also be given by a nasogastric tube. Zinc supplementation is recommended in children. Antibiotics are generally not needed.|$|E
5|$|Preventive care, vaccinations {{and medical}} {{screenings}} cannot {{be subject to}} co-payments, co-insurance or deductibles.

40|$|The {{experiment}} was accomplished {{in a completely}} randomized block design, using 25 cross bred bullocks nursed in the periods of 35, 42, 49, 56 and 63 days of life. Effect of the <b>breastfeed</b> periods was not observed on the weight development of the bullocks. The consumption of daily and total milk {{was influenced by the}} weight when being born and for the <b>breastfeed</b> period (P < 0, 05). The adjustment of the averages for the variation analysis showed an increase tendency in the consumption of proportional milk to the <b>breastfeed</b> periods. The wean at 35 days was shown economically viable...|$|R
40|$|Research Question How {{do women}} who {{choose not to}} <b>breastfeed</b> {{perceive}} their healthcare experience? Method This qualitative research study used a phenomenographic approach to explore the healthcare experience of women who do not <b>breastfeed.</b> Seven women were interviewed about their healthcare experience relating to their choice of feeding, approximately four weeks after giving birth. Six conceptions were identified and an outcome space was developed to demonstrate the relationships and meaning of the conceptions in a visual format. Findings There were five unmet needs identified by the participants during this study. These needs included equity, self sufficiency, support, education and the need not to feel pressured. Conclusion Women in this study who chose not to <b>breastfeed</b> identified important areas where they felt that their needs were not met. In keeping with the Code of Ethics for Nurses and Midwives, the identified needs of women who do not <b>breastfeed</b> must be addressed in a caring, compassionate and just manner. The care and education of women who formula feed should be of the highest standard possible, even if the choice not to <b>breastfeed</b> is not the preferred choice of healthcare professionals...|$|R
50|$|Although {{not used}} regularly, English shows some {{instrument}} incorporation, as in <b>breastfeed,</b> and direct object incorporation, as in babysit. Etymologically, such verbs in English are usually back-formations: the verbs <b>breastfeed</b> and babysit are formed from the adjective breast-fed and the noun babysitter respectively. Incorporation and plain compounding may be fuzzy categories: consider backstabbing, name-calling, axe murder.|$|R
5|$|Evidence {{supports}} {{effectiveness and}} safety in adolescents {{and those who}} have and have not previously had children. IUDs do not affect <b>breastfeeding</b> and can be inserted immediately after delivery. They may also be used immediately after an abortion. Once removed, even after long term use, fertility returns to normal immediately.|$|E
5|$|HIV is {{transmitted}} by three main routes: sexual contact, significant exposure to infected body fluids or tissues, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or <b>breastfeeding</b> (known as vertical transmission). There is no risk of acquiring HIV if exposed to feces, nasal secretions, saliva, sputum, sweat, tears, urine, or vomit unless these are contaminated with blood. It {{is possible to}} be co-infected {{by more than one}} strain of HIV—a condition known as HIV superinfection.|$|E
5|$|In teenagers, pregnancies are {{at greater}} risk of poor outcomes. Comprehensive sex {{education}} and access to birth control decreases the rate of unwanted pregnancies in this age group. While all forms of birth control can generally be used by young people, long-acting reversible birth control such as implants, IUDs, or vaginal rings are more successful in reducing rates of teenage pregnancy. After the delivery of a child, a woman who is not exclusively <b>breastfeeding</b> may become pregnant again after as few as four to six weeks. Some methods of birth control can be started immediately following the birth, while others require a delay of up to six months. In women who are <b>breastfeeding,</b> progestin-only methods are preferred over combined oral birth control pills. In women who have reached menopause, it is recommended that birth control be continued for one year after the last period.|$|E

5|$|Midazolam, {{when taken}} during the third {{trimester}} of pregnancy, may cause risk to the neonate, including benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, with possible symptoms including hypotonia, apnoeic spells, cyanosis, and impaired metabolic responses to cold stress. Symptoms of hypotonia and the neonatal benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome {{have been reported to}} persist from hours to months after birth. Other neonatal withdrawal symptoms include hyperexcitability, tremor, and gastrointestinal upset (diarrhea or vomiting). <b>Breastfeeding</b> by mothers using midazolam is not recommended.|$|E
5|$|Premastication is {{complementary}} to <b>breastfeeding</b> in {{the health}} practices of infants and young children, providing large amounts of carbohydrate and protein nutrients not always available through breast milk, and micronutrients such as iron, zinc, and vitamin B12 which are essential nutrients present mainly in meat. Compounds in the saliva, such as haptocorrin also help increase B12 availability by protecting the vitamin against stomach acid.|$|E
5|$|Side {{effects can}} include a {{decrease}} in efforts to breathe, low blood pressure, and sleepiness. Tolerance to its effects and withdrawal syndrome may occur following long-term use. Paradoxical effects, such as increased activity, can occur especially in children and older people. There is evidence of risk when used during pregnancy but no evidence of harm with a single dose during <b>breastfeeding.</b> It is of the benzodiazepine class and works through the GABA neurotransmitter.|$|E

50|$|The World Health Organization {{recommends}} {{that if a}} mother is unable to <b>breastfeed,</b> chooses not to <b>breastfeed,</b> or if her baby (often premature) shows signs that it isn't getting enough breast-milk, a healthy wet nurse or milk from a donor is a healthy alternative to formula. A special formula is manufactured for premature babies, although the World Health Organization recommends it only if breast-milk is medically not an option such as if a premature baby has to be fed formula through a tube to maintain a healthy weight. The World Health Organization advocates {{the importance of a}} baby being close to its mother whenever possible even if the mother does not <b>breastfeed.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{pituitary}} gland {{is located at}} the base of the brain, and intimately connected with the hypothalamus. It consists of two lobes: the posterior pituitary, which consists of nervous tissue branching out of the hypothalamus, and the anterior pituitary, which consists of hormone-producing epithelium. The posterior pituitary secretes antidiuretic hormone, which regulates osmolarity of the blood, and oxytocin, which causes contractions of the uterus in childbirth and participates in <b>breastfeeding.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{supply of}} easily {{accessible}} uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices {{are important for}} reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis.
