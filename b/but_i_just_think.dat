As {{described}} in Beebo Brinker, {{one had to}} knock on the door and be recognized before being let in. In reality, women were not allowed to wear pants in some bars in New York City. Police raided bars and arrested everyone within regularly; a raid on a gay bar prompted the seminal Stonewall riots in 1969 that started the gay rights movement. Because of the atmosphere of secrecy and shame, little was recorded at the time {{about what it was like}} to be gay then, and Bannon unwittingly recorded history from her own visits to Greenwich Village. In 2007, one of the writers who adapted three of the books into a play said of Bannon's work, [...] "I think she rises above the pulp. She wasn't trying to write trash.

Upon signing with the Warriors, general manager Chris Mullin said of Maggette, [...] "He gets his points and rebounds. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> it's his approach to the work and his lifestyle {{that will be a}} huge benefit for our young guys.

5000|$|Banks {{has said}} she admires American {{recording}} artists Beyoncé and Aaliyah stating the former [...] "is the queen of everything. She's the most remarkable performer and musician. And this is just my humble opinion, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> she's better than everyone else making music right now." [...] Banks also cites Bajan pop singer Rihanna, and house singer Crystal Waters as influences. Banks is inspired by, and has drawn directly upon, black gay culture, such as the film Paris is Burning, in her music.|$|E

Ivey spent $50,000 of his own money in the race; Wilson received more than $30,000 in donations from 43 contributors. The candidates spent mostly on signs, mailers, and telephone systems to reach voters. Ivey polled 2,202 votes (53 percent) to Wilson's 1,954 (47 percent).|$|E
5000|$|At a {{press conference}} in London on 15 September 2008, David Jason {{announced}} that he would be quitting the role of DI Jack Frost. Jason's main reason for quitting the role was that Frost was by now the oldest detective on television and he felt that it was 'natural' to retire as Frost. At 68, a police detective would already have been retired for eight years. Sir David said: [...] "You wouldn't want me to play Frost in a wheelchair, would you?... Frost is getting a little long in the tooth. I still enjoy doing it and it's a great part <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> he's got to retire. It'll be a sad day." ...|$|E

[...] Regarding their popularity, Yankovic has said, [...] "At this point, it's sort of mandatory for me to do a polka medley.

2500|$|Meath's captain Nigel Crawford {{gave his}} {{opinion on the}} incident: [...] "I'm sure most players have been {{involved}} in controversial situations like that where you get calls for replays and things like that happening, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> don't <b>think</b> it's possible or <b>I</b> <b>just</b> don't <b>think</b> it can happen.

It's just very unfortunate that it happens in a high-profile game right {{at the end of a}} game to a team that hasn't won in a long time. It's just a very unfortunate situation".|$|R
5000|$|In February 2015, while {{promoting}} his newest film, Chappie, director Neil Blomkamp expressed some regrets regarding Elysium, commenting: [...] "I feel like I fucked it up, I feel like ultimately {{the story is}} not the right story.. I still think the satirical idea of a ring, filled with rich people, hovering above the impoverished Earth, is an awesome idea. I love it so much, I almost {{want to go back and}} do it correctly. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> the script wasn’t… I just didn’t make a good enough film is ultimately what it is. I feel like I executed all of the stuff that could be executed, like costume and set design and special effects very well. But, ultimately, it was all resting on a somewhat not totally formed skeletal system, so the script just wasn’t there; the story wasn’t fully there." ...|$|E
5000|$|In their critique, Contactmusic.com gave [...] "Father" [...] a mixed review. They stated, [...] "...if {{you think}} the lyrics are strong on that ("Judgement Day") wait till you here [...] "Father" [...] the second cut on the single. Lyrics like [...] "I spent 23 years trying to be {{what you wanted to}} me be though it seemed that you never see me until I picked up the mic and I was on the TV now your ringing of my phone like every week" [...] and [...] "How can you call {{yourself}} a man when you can't love your own unless you can control them". Both of these tracks make great album cuts <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> the UK will find it hard to deal with such lyrics in a pop single no matter how urban / street the artist is. Ms Dynamite is back and she is more than living up to her name via the lyrical content. The overall double A-side single was rated 3/5.|$|E

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Vanity Fair, Lawrence called the leak a [...] "sex crime" [...] and a [...] "sexual violation" [...] and added, [...] "anybody who looked at those pictures, you're perpetuating a sexual offense and you should cower with shame". This view was contrasted by another victim of the hack, Emily Ratajkowski, who told GQ, [...] "A {{lot of people who}} were victims of hack said anyone who looks at these pictures should feel guilty, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> don't <b>think</b> that's fair", and [...] "I'm not sure that anyone who Googles it is necessarily a criminal.

It just seemed like the time was right to do it. I always felt that I could do those Frank stories by the inch, yard, or mile. The length of the stories never really mattered that much to me."

5000|$|In an October 2013, {{interview}} with, The Come Up Show, {{he spoke}} about when the album would be released, saying: [...] "Well you know what, this YAOWA album would’ve came out maybe a year {{a year and a}} half ago, but I’m happy it didn’t. I made some changes in my life that I talk about on the YAOWA project. From weight loss to stopping smoking and drinking, just lifestyle changes. I’ve traveled so much with Slaughterhouse; I’ve learned so many things from Eminem and I’ve just been alongside some great people so my story got iller. I feel like if I told my story {{a year and a half}} ago it still would have been ill because I’m one of the dopest, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> that it’s so much more wide-spread now that this YAOWA album is going to be received in a way where people are going to learn a lot about the old me and the new me. I couldn’t have it any other way; I mean it’s been a while but worth the wait regardless, if that sounds cliche or not I really mean that.|$|E
5000|$|Albarn was honoured at the Ivor Novello Awards {{where he}} picked up the {{lifetime}} achievement award for his work with Blur, Gorillaz, The Good, the Bad & the Queen, as well as his myriad of soundtracks and other work. During his acceptance speech, he spoke out about his love of the band Simple Minds and how they may be shaping the new Gorillaz record: [...] "From someone who grew up in Leytonstone, it was a culture shock to say the least. Anyway, we were in this band and we had a guitarist who was an Edge from U2 obsessive, but we had a more kind of loose bass player who was really Simple Minds. Graham and me were a bit kind of more mercurial about what we like and what we don't like, but they were more adamant. Looking back at it now, I loved pretending that I was in U2, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> that Simple Minds were cooler. [...] "Promised You a Miracle" [...] - I listened to it when I started doing this new Gorillaz record and it just blew my mind, and it blew everyone who I was working with's mind. They hadn't even heard of Simple Minds, and they loved it - so that's testament to it being incredible." ...|$|E
5000|$|The single {{received}} general positive {{reviews from}} fans and critics. Popjustice.com stated, [...] "it's {{a bit like}} on Derren Brown when he spends days, weeks or months programming someone so that one day, when he comes along and prods them on the shoulder, it all comes flooding back {{and they can do}} something amazing like fly a kite or do the ironing with their eyes shut etc. It is as if the last eight or however many years of The X Factor, with the Inspirational Blub Tunes blasting out every time someone does something happy or sad or notable, has programmed us so that a prod from this Westlife tune makes us feel like we're through the boot camp. It feels good being Through To Boot Camp. It feels very good indeed. While 4music.com emphasized on a part of the lyrics saying, [...] "It includes such gems as 'Pulling at me like the stars do / You're like gravity.' Who'd have thought that physics could have such an influence in pop music." [...] Music All Stars said [...] "Safe" [...] is good, it has Westlife's typical moving/heart-warming lyrics <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> the Irish lads have made way better first singles in the past." [...] Entertainment Focus said: [...] "Westlife are hardly considered to be cool are they in the industry? We aren’t going to do that. Whilst we wouldn’t choose {{to go out and buy}} a Westlife single we can understand why people would. There's something so familiar about a Westlife track that the minute it starts you feel like you’re sat with an old friend you hold very dear. Safe sticks to the usual formula, and therefore guarantees that the band will be once again battling for the top spot in the charts the week of release. Soaring melodies, harmony-filled vocals and dramatic instrumentation all combine for another classic slice of Westlife. You can say many things about Westlife but one thing you can’t say is that the lads can’t sing. Each of the boys can hold their own and whilst Safe doesn’t exactly set our world on fire it’ll be held dearly to the hearts of every Westlife fan in the world. After 11 years you’ve got to admire the fact that the band are sticking with the ‘if it ain’t broke don’t fix it’ formula don’t you?" [...] Tina Hart of MSN UK quoted, Admittedly, I was kind of over Westlife when I got over Boyzone the first time around - sorry guys, I was a fickle teenager. The Irish quartet is still churning out the tunes though as the lead single Safe from forthcoming (eleventh!) album Gravity, is a suitably nice, sentimental ballad that will undoubtedly please hardcore fans and I’m sure I’ll now end up singing ‘I will keeep you sa-a-aafe’ all day after a few plays. With an accompanying dramatic multi-storyline video featuring a fiery car crash and domestic violence, it's not definitely not your less-interesting visual Flying Without Wings but Safe doesn’t quite reach the audio-epicness of FOW either. Robert Copsey of Digital Spy said: [...] "Let's just get this out the way: Westlife's new single is called 'Safe' and it's a ballad. While the jokes write themselves, anyone who remembers their dodgy Rat Pack covers record from 2004 knows that we, and they, are in a much better place now. Back then we were certain the lads were about to call time, but a further five albums down the line, it's obvious they're doing something right. Of course, their eleven years in the game has given them a knack for spotting a good ballad, but truth be told, it's difficult to drum up much excitement for this kind of thing tenth album around. Nonetheless, the pounding piano riff, fist-clenching lyrics and that key change are, as ever, all present and correct. The real test? Whether it's used during those teary moments on next year's X Factor." [...] Daily Star added: [...] "YES, it's a ballad. But, hang on? This is not slushier than a smashed-up punnet of out-of-season Sainsbury's strawberries. In fact - gasp! - it's kind of cool in a key change-tastic boyband ballady way. Fans are going to have a right job deciding between buying this and the JLS and Take That offerings. In fact, the ‘Loife might just mop up the Take That fans who aren’t so keen on the lads’ new Muse-esque direction.IndieLondon informed, [...] "How you going to live your life like the dream you have is real?… I will keep you safe…" [...] So sing Westlife during the chorus to their epic new power ballad, Safe. And that title tells you just about everything you need to know about the track… it's safe, conventional and passionately heartfelt in the way that you’d expect a power pop ballad to be from one of the boy bands of the moment. That is to say, a moody piano score, belated swirling string arrangements and a layered chorus that delivers each question - [...] "How you gonna love? How you gonna feel?" [...] - with passion and meaning. It's destined to sweep the hopeless romantics off their feet, and to provide the backing for several movie and/or TV scenes… but it is formulaic no matter how well done for this kind of thing (and therefore kind of average)." ...|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} on Kidd Kraddick in the Morning she said, [...] "It was a learning experience for sure. Sonically it's just not my vibe. I think it would've been a great hit song for somebody else maybe, but it's <b>just</b> not what <b>I</b> like to sing. It's a bubblegum pop record for sure, and I like to sing stuff that's a little more soulful. I love pop music, I'm a huge pop music fan, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> didn't <b>think</b> that that record was right for me."

6000|$|L. Yes, {{certainly}}, my dear: <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>just</b> as certainly (though geologists {{differ on}} this matter), {{not with the}} violence, or on the scale, of their ancient ruin and renewal.

I wasn't in a temper anymore--and it left a dreadful sort of goneness, too. I felt so ashamed of myself. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> couldn't <b>think</b> of going and telling Mrs. Lynde so. It would be so humiliating. I {{made up my mind}} I'd stay shut up here forever rather than do that. But still--I'd do {{anything}} for you--if you really want me to--" ...|$|R
5000|$|In a Q&A with The Hollywood Reporter on May 16, 2003, Whedon explained: [...] We just couldn't find a {{home for}} (it). We had a great {{animation}} director, great visuals, six or seven hilarious scripts from our own staff—and nobody wanted it. I was completely baffled. I felt like I was sitting there with bags of money and nobody would take them from me. It {{was a question of}} people either not wanting it or not being able to put up the money because it was not a cheap show. One thing I was very hard-line about was, I didn't want people to see it if it looked like crap. I wanted it to be on a level with Animaniacs or Batman: The Animated Series. And that's a little pricier. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> don't <b>think</b> it's worth doing unless it's beautiful to look at as well as fun.|$|R
50|$|From 1965 to 1972, Fradon left comics {{to raise}} her daughter. In 1972, she {{returned}} to DC where later in the decade she would draw Plastic Man, Freedom Fighters, and Super Friends which she penciled for almost its entire run. She also worked for Marvel Comics during this period, but left after only two assignments: a fill-in issue of Fantastic Four and the never-published fifth issue of The Cat. Fradon recounted: First of all, I was really rusty. And The Cat I was totally confounded by not drawing from a script. They gave me this one paragraph and said go draw this 17-page story. I don’t think I did my best work by any means. I think I had a script on Fantastic Four, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> don’t <b>think</b> they were satisfied with my work.

I confess I don't have all the details. I do know that we participated in all the meetings that produced the draft. Beyond that, I can't give you specific reasons here from the podium as to why we didn't sign on to it. We've put out a public document that I can give you the citation for afterwards and it explains our reasons for not participating in the draft. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>just</b> as a general comment, clearly the draft that was put up for a vote or put for signature was not one that met our needs and expectations.|$|R
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Myles McNutt from The A.V. Club awarded the episode a C rating, noting that Test the Store' {{was just too}} dumb to build any further momentum; I wish I had a better word for it, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> can't <b>think</b> of one." [...] However, McNutt appreciated Jim's presentation, noting that [...] "the final presentation was a pretty decent setpiece." [...] What Culture! reviewer Joseph Kratzer awarded the episode three out of five stars, noting that the episode fell victim to [...] "the overall lack of focus and believability that has plagued The Office all season." [...] Jeffrey Hyatt from Screen Crave gave the episode a review of seven out of ten, noting that [...] "The Office continues to get the comedy boost it needs from the Florida storyline." [...] Hyatt called the scene featuring Dwight and Jim imitating Kelly and Ryan's mom as [...] "one of my favorite moments of the season so far." [...] Despite this, he did call the episode [...] "uneven," [...] noting that the Scranton story-line was [...] "ho-hum." [...] Dan Forcella from TV Fanatic awarded the episode {{four out of five}} stars and praised Jim's presentation, writing, [...] "Between Jim's outfit and makeup, the fact that he embraced the presentation throughout, and all of the Chuck references, I was speechless {{by the end of that}} thing." ...|$|R
5000|$|As {{supported}} by neuroscientific studies, critiques of Hello World! (and similarly created works) {{could potentially be}} affected by anti-computer prejudice, derived from the fact of knowing in advance (or not) the non-human nature of the author. [...] The music critic Tom Service of The Guardian acknowledged as much in his review of a 2012 performance, writing, [...] "Now, maybe I'm falling victim to a perceptual bias against a faceless computer program <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> don't <b>think</b> Hello World! is especially impressive." [...] He continued: To me, it's precisely the musical [...] "genomes", {{the backbone of the}} way Iamus programs and produces its pieces, that are the problem. It sounds like it's slavishly manipulating pitch cells to generate melodies that have a kind of superficial coherence and relationship to one another, with all the dryness and greyness that suggests, despite the expressive commitment of the three performers. But the material of Hello World! (there's no equivalent of the humorous exclamation mark in the music, more's the pity) is so unmemorable, and the way it's elaborated so workaday, that the piece leaves no distinctive impression. Despite describing the piece as [...] "more successful than previous attempts to produce generic musical compositions from computers," [...] he added, [...] "The real paradox of Iamus is why it's being used to attempt to fool humanity in this way. If you've got a computer program of this sophistication, why bother trying to compose pieces that a human, and not a very good human at that - well, not a compositional genius anyway - could write? Why not use it to find new realms of sound, new kinds of musical ideas?" ...|$|R
5000|$|The album {{features}} fourteen {{brand new}} Van Zandt compositions. The singer's third wife Jeanene recalls in To Live's To Fly finding {{the lyrics to}} [...] "A Song For" [...] scribbled on a notepad and, after reading them, tearfully said, [...] "Townes, this new song is so beautiful. It's bound to be my favorite," [...] to which Van Zandt replied, [...] "Song my ass...That's a suicide note." [...] The album features some lighter moments, such as the comical [...] "Billy, Boney and Ma" [...] and the bluesy [...] "Goin' Down To Memphis", and some heartfelt moments as well, with Van Zandt including lullabies to his two youngest children, [...] "Hey Willy Boy" [...] and [...] "Katie Belle Blue" [...] (the liner notes include a dedication [...] "to John (JT), Will, and Katie Bell"). In a 1994 interview Van Zandt explained to Aretha Sills, [...] "One is for my wife called 'Lover’s Lullaby'. And one I wrote for money, about Will, who’s eleven. Got {{a phone call from}} a record company, said we’re putting together an album of lullabies. I said, 'I'm not sure I have any lullabies.' 'Well, there’s money in it.' 'Oh, Yeah! I got one. I got a good one!' So I sat up 'til four o’clock in the morning and wrote 'Hey Willie Boy', and it’s a really pretty song. And then 'Katie Belle Blue' I wrote from love, to put Katie Belle to sleep." [...] However, these light-hearted songs are contrasted with [...] "The Hole" [...] and [...] "Marie", some of the darkest material in the Van Zandt canon. In the 2004 biopic Be Here To Love Me, Guy Clark recalls hearing [...] "Marie" [...] for the first time when Van Zandt played it for him in Santa Monica where they were booked to play McCabes' Guitar Shop: [...] "He sits down with a guitar and has this piece of paper on his knee and proceeds to play 'Marie' all the way through. He says, 'Man, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> wrote this this morning.' And I'm like (mimes disbelief), 'You're shittin' me, man!' And (he) went over across the street that night and played it - and remembered every word. I swear to God I saw him do it." [...] Van Zandt claimed the song was inspired by Meryl Streep's character in the film Ironweed and describes the harrowing plight of a homeless couple who wind up living under a bridge until the woman dies with the protagonist's unborn child [...] "safe inside her." [...] Van Zandt performed the song years before he committed it to tape, but Michael Timmins of the Cowboy Junkies told John Kruth in 2007 that [...] "it was such a disappointment the way the producer handled it. The song really got lost in that production. They should have just let the man tell his story. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> don't <b>think</b> Townes cared all that much. His thing was songwriting; by the time he recorded a song, his attitude was well, whatever." [...] Many regard the song as a milestone and a late-career masterpiece. [...] "The Hole" [...] was another minor-key metaphorical tale about a man's nightmarish encounter with an old hag who turns him into a toad.|$|R
50|$|Katt Shea {{worked on}} the {{original}} story. She later recalled: <b>I</b> <b>just</b> didn't get paid for it. It was weird.
