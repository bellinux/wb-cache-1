50|$|Members select various {{statistics}} which include, race, age, height, weight, {{adherence to}} safer sex practices, amount of body hair, body type, penis size, and other criteria. They also upload pictures of themselves, {{at least one}} of which must show their unclothed <b>body,</b> <b>shirt</b> off. As a result, the site has been described as the most graphic and audacious of the gay dating sites. There is a space on the profile dedicated to a text description of the member and what he is looking for, these blurbs range from a few sentences to full pages. Members join any of several communities such as those reserved for those that are visibly muscular. Members can then choose to allow or disallow other communities from being able to see them. This community-based system is one of the site's unique selling propositions in that it allows a more nuanced search function for attributes within user profiles. It acts as a pre search, along with age range preferences, so that members only see, and are only seen by, other members who they are likely to find attractive. Thus giving the impression that the site is dedicated to their tastes and requirements and avoiding unwanted contact.|$|E
60|$|Jerry's struggles availed him nothing. His {{coat and}} vest were {{literally}} ripped from his <b>body,</b> and his <b>shirt</b> followed.|$|R
60|$|Levi, {{with the}} knife still gripped tight in his hand, stood leaning over his victim, looking down upon his <b>body.</b> His <b>shirt</b> and hand, and even his naked arm, were stained and blotched with blood. The moon lit up his face {{and it was the}} face of a devil from hell.|$|R
50|$|Third: The third strip {{was black}} with {{stunning}} yellow {{details on the}} <b>body</b> of the <b>shirt,</b> which also featured a yellow crew neck. Black shorts and socks with yellow details completed the third strip.|$|R
5000|$|Points - {{the corners}} of a collar; in a buttoned-down collar, the points are fitted with buttonholes that attach to small buttons on the <b>body</b> of the <b>shirt</b> to hold the collar neatly in place.|$|R
50|$|The Osprey Body Armour is {{complemented by}} the Under <b>Body</b> Armour Combat <b>Shirt</b> (UBACS) {{but can be}} worn over the CS95 DPM jacket or PCS MTP jacket. The UBACS torso is made of wicking coolmax fabric with soft {{protection}} in the shoulders and sleeves.|$|R
25|$|Either two or four patch {{pockets and}} two {{vertical}} rows of alforzas (fine, tiny pleats, usually ten, sewed closely together) {{run along the}} front and back of the shirt. The pockets are separately detailed with identical alforzas that are aligned with the alforzas on the <b>body</b> of the <b>shirt.</b>|$|R
50|$|Away: The away kit {{features}} the colours gold and navy, and {{is similar to}} the away kit worn in the Double-winning 2001-02 season. The shirt has navy shoulders and a crew-neck, but the most striking feature of the kit is the subtle diamond graphic on the <b>body</b> of the <b>shirt.</b> The strip is combined with navy shorts and socks.|$|R
50|$|In the Street Fighter II V series, Cammy is {{a former}} special forces operative-turned-assassin who is hired by Balrog to assassinate Chun-Li's father, but is stopped by Fei Long. After her fight, she realizes that Balrog had tricked her and nearly kills him. Cammy has a {{completely}} different look in the series, wearing black leather pants a black <b>body</b> fit <b>shirt,</b> red gloves, red boots, and a black necklace with a silver cross. This incarnation of the character {{does not have a}} scar on her cheek and wears her hair in a single ponytail. As in the animated movie, the series' English dub depicts Cammy as American instead of British.|$|R
50|$|Home: The home strip {{introduced}} gold {{into the}} colour scheme {{and at the}} same time ditching the traditional white colour entirely from the shirt and the shorts, with the Adidas' trademark three stripes, sponsor logos and the badge all rendered in gold. In addition to this, the <b>body</b> of the <b>shirt</b> featured a very subtle diagonal graphic. The shorts and the socks were blue and white, as usual.|$|R
5000|$|A yoke is a shaped pattern piece {{which forms}} {{part of a}} garment, usually fitting around the neck and shoulders, or around the hips to provide support for looser parts of the garment, such as a {{gathered}} skirt or the <b>body</b> of a <b>shirt.</b> Yoke construction was first seen in the 19th century. Bodice yokes were first seen in the 1880s, whilst the yoke skirt, a skirt suspended from a fitted hip yoke, was first seen in 1898.|$|R
50|$|Away: The away kit {{features}} two {{tones of}} grey, with the <b>body</b> of the <b>shirt</b> being lighter and the sleeves and necktie (V-neck) darker. The three white Adidas' stripes are displayed vertically {{along the sides}} of the shirt. The club's badge is monochromatic and, just like in the previous seasons, it has the three stars above, each representing 10 league titles won by the club. The shorts are dark grey and the socks are predominantly light grey, {{with the exception of a}} horizontal stripe. The first appearance of this kit was against Real Betis on 20 July.|$|R
40|$|Black {{and white}} lantern slide showing Reverend Edward James Ball, the first male missionary to be {{involved}} in the Peruvian Inland Mission. He stands in front of a two storey thatched building, with a thatched shelter behind him. Rev. Ball holds his hat in front of his <b>body,</b> wears a <b>shirt</b> and trousers, and smiles happily. This slide comes from a collection created by the Peruvian Inland Mission, an evangelical mission started in 1930 by Miss Annie G Soper in northeast Peru, which was administered by the evangelical interdenominational mission, Regions Beyond Missionary Union from 1948...|$|R
5000|$|One day, at the Cafe Typo, Nagiko's {{favourite}} haunt, {{she meets}} Jerome, a British translator. Intrigued by his knowledge, {{they go to}} a private space where she has Jerome write on her body in various languages. In spite of her interest, Nagiko dislikes Jerome's handwriting and orders him out. Jerome totally shocks Nagiko, however, when he asks her to teach him, offering her to write on his <b>body.</b> Opening his <b>shirt,</b> he offers Nagiko to [...] "Use my body like the pages of a book. Of your book!". Nagiko has never considered this aspect in her desires before: her lovers always write on her body. When she backs out and runs, Jerome laughs at her.|$|R
50|$|The new away kit â€” a {{striking}} solid purple colour but sporting the same vertical white pin stripes on the <b>body</b> of the <b>shirt</b> {{as the home}} kit plus all the same kit supplier, sponsorship and club crest logos - was possibly {{a throwback to the}} classic maroon and thin white striped shirts that had been the club's one-time strip created for its appearance at Wembley in the 1956 FA Cup Final against Birmingham City. In comparison to the new home and away kits, the new third kit consisted of a relatively conservative all white shirt and socks with solid sky blue shorts, with the white shirt sporting a thin sky blue diagonal sash across the front of the left shoulder.|$|R
6000|$|There {{was never}} an {{interval}} when something was not at hand to be done. Joe waited for nothing, waited on nothing, and went on the jump from task to task. They starched two hundred white shirts, with a single gathering movement seizing a shirt so that the wristbands, neckband, yoke, and bosom protruded beyond the circling right hand. At the same moment the left hand held up the <b>body</b> of the <b>shirt</b> {{so that it would}} not enter the starch, and at the moment the right hand dipped into the starch--starch so hot that, in order to wring it out, their hands had to thrust, and thrust continually, into a bucket of cold water. And that night they worked till half-past ten, dipping [...] "fancy starch"--all the frilled and airy, delicate wear of ladies.|$|R
40|$|The primary aim of {{this thesis}} was to develop more {{acceptable}} methods of ballistic neck protection that could replace the existing OSPREY ballistic neck collar. Clinical and post mortem injury analysis, computed tomography interpretation and ergonomics assessments were undertaken, resulting in the recommendation of two prototype designs to the Ministry of Defence. These two prototypes have subsequently been renamed the Enhanced Protection Under <b>Body</b> Armour Combat <b>Shirt</b> and the Patrol collar, and are now issued to all UK armed forces personnel deploying on operations overseas. The secondary {{aim of this}} thesis was to develop methods to validate the potential medical effectiveness of future body armour designs. Two new novel injury models have been developed using an anthropometrically accurate three- dimensional representation of cervical anatomical structures. Penetration of representative fragment simulating projectiles through skin and muscle was determined experimentally using physical and animal simulants. The Coverage of Armour Tool is {{being used in the}} current Ministry of Defence VIRTUS procurement programme to rule out future body armour designs on medical grounds, thereby greatly reducing the number of prototypes requiring ergonomics assessment. ...|$|R
40|$|The Holter monitor is used {{to measure}} an {{electrocardiogram}} (ECG) signal while a subject moves. However, the Holter monitor is uncomfortable for the subject. Another method of measuring the ECG signal uses a smart shirt. We developed a smart shirt that has six electrodes on the chest and can measure a detailed ECG, obtained with unipolar precordial leads. The electrodes and wires of the shirt are made of conductive ink that is flexible and stretchable. The smart shirt is stretchable and fits the body well. However, because of {{the gap between the}} smart <b>shirt</b> and the <b>body,</b> electrodes V 1 and V 2 do not touch the body consistently. We developed a conductive foam block that fills this gap. We investigated the characteristics of the conductive foam block, and measured ECG signals using the smart shirt. The electrical resistance of the conductive foam block was reduced by pressure. This characteristic could be utilized to measure the ECG signal because the block was pressed by the <b>body</b> and smart <b>shirt.</b> We could measure the ECG signal using the smart shirt and blocks while the subject walked and could detect peaks of the ECG signal while the subject jogged slowly...|$|R
40|$|Future {{exploration}} missions {{require the}} development of a new liquid cooling garment (LCG) to support the next generation extravehicular activity (EVA) suit system. The new LCG must offer greater system reliability, optimal thermal performance as required by mission directive, and meet other design requirements including improved tactile comfort. To advance {{the development of}} a future LCG, a thermal performance test was conducted to evaluate: (1) the comparable thermal performance of the EMU LCG and the CSAFE developed engineering evaluation unit (EEU) LCG, (2) the effect of the thermal comfort undergarment (TCU) on the EMU LCG tactile and thermal comfort, and (3) the performance of a torso or upper <b>body</b> only LCG <b>shirt</b> to evaluate a proposed auxiliary loop. To evaluate the thermal performance of each configuration, a metabolic test was conducted using the Demonstrator Spacesuit to create a relevant test environment. Three (3) male test subjects of similar height and weight walked on a treadmill at various speeds to produce three different metabolic loads - resting (300 - 600 BTU/hr), walking at a slow pace (1200 BTU/hr), and walking at a brisk pace (2200 BTU/hr). Each subject participated in five tests - two wearing the CSAFE full LCG, one wearing the EMU LCG without TCUs, one wearing the EMU LCG with TCUs, and one with the CSAFE shirt-only. During the test, performance data for the breathing air and cooling water systems and subject specific data was collected to define the thermal performance of the configurations. The test results show that the CSAFE EEU LCG and EMU LCG with TCU had comparable performance. The testing also showed that an auxiliary loop LCG, sized similarly to the shirt-only configuration, should provide adequate cooling for contingency scenarios. Finally, the testing showed that the TCU did not significantly hinder LCG heat transfer, and may prove to be acceptable for future suit use with additional analysis and testing...|$|R
60|$|Keeping {{close to}} the wall that went about the pier on the seaward side, to escape the driving foam and the wind, which {{threatened}} every moment to lift us off our feet, {{we made our way}} in silence {{to the door of the}} square building. Michael Robartes opened it with a key, on which I saw the rust of many salt winds, and led me along a bare passage and up an uncarpeted stair to a little room surrounded with bookshelves. A meal would be brought, but only of fruit, for I must submit to a tempered fast before the ceremony, he explained, and with it a book on the doctrine and method of the Order, over which I was to spend what remained of the winter daylight. He then left me, promising to return an hour before the ceremony. I began searching among the bookshelves, and found one of the most exhaustive alchemical libraries I have ever seen. There were the works of Morienus, who hid his immortal <b>body</b> under a <b>shirt</b> of hair-cloth; of Avicenna, who was a drunkard and yet controlled numberless legions of spirits; of Alfarabi, who put so many spirits into his lute that he could make men laugh, or weep, or fall in deadly trance as he would; of Lully, who transformed himself into the likeness of a red cock; of Flamel, who with his wife Parnella achieved the elixir many hundreds of years ago, and is fabled to live still in Arabia among the Dervishes; and of many of less fame. There were very few mystics but alchemical mystics, and because, I had little doubt, of the devotion to one god of the greater number and of the limited sense of beauty, which Robartes would hold an inevitable consequence; but I did notice a complete set of facsimiles of the prophetical writings of William Blake, and probably because of the multitudes that thronged his illumination and were 'like the gay fishes on the wave when the moon sucks up the dew.' I noted also many poets and prose writers of every age, but only those who were a little weary of life, as indeed the greatest have been everywhere, and who cast their imagination to us, as a something they needed no longer now that they were going up in their fiery chariots.|$|R
