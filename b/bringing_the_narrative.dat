40|$|The {{following}} {{thesis is}} {{an investigation of}} the textual strategies functioning in four novels by Boris Vian: L'Ecume des jours (1947), L'Automne a Pekin (1947), L'Herbe rouge (1950) and L'Arrache-creur (1953). It examines the novels' usage of intertextuality (references, direct and indirect, to other works of literature), and analyses the potentiality for producing meaning that is contained within this usage. By conjoining the four novels in this common textual strategy, it also examines how the novels refer to each other (intratextuality), and how they may, therefore, be considered as a unified and coherent tetralogy. Within this threefold strategy, the thesis yields a new reading of the four novels: Chapters One and Two deal with caricature and 'clins d'reil' in L 'Ecume des jours, exposing an association with Surrealism and the beginnings of a novelistic mythology; Chapters Three and Four follow the surface structure of L 'Automne a Pekin, at each stage revealing the veiled intertextual structure, the importance both of Parisian novels and the genre of detective fiction; Chapters Five and Six question the status of L 'Herbe rouge as a novel of Science Fiction, exposing its oneiric qualities and the role of death; finally, Chapters Seven and Eight show how the tetralogy can be seen to reach its climax in a final novel which closes the circle, <b>bringing</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrative</b> {{back to the beginning of}} the first. This thesis, therefore, through the use of a critical tool (intertextuality) not before fully exploited in the context of Boris Vian's reuvre, discloses new readings of each of the four 'romans signes Vian', as well as offering a comprehensive view of a tetralogy of texts considered as one self-referential unit...|$|E

40|$|This essay – {{developed}} from a keynote {{delivered at the}} interdisciplinary conference ‘Vauxhall Revisited’ (Tate Britain, 2008) – draws on perspectives from architectural history, cultural geography, {{and the history of}} auditory culture in an exploration of the ‘soundscape’ of the eighteenth-century pleasure garden. Focusing on Vauxhall, the least investigated musically of London’s late Georgian commercial garden resorts, Cowgill explores how music was used to demarcate time and space, to articulate national/imperial identity and political affiliations, to create and manipulate illusion, and to regulate the movement and demeanour of audiences in a carefully constructed, multi-sensory night-time environment. Discussion is informed by detailed study of primary sources, including songsheets, scrapbooks, albums, bills, prints, periodicals and newspapers, and archival material from the Minet Library (Lambeth Archive) and British Library. Commentary on London’s pleasure gardens tends to leave off {{at the close of the}} eighteenth century, as if the nineteenth was simply a long, slow period of decline; yet the urban garden resort proved remarkably resilient amid a rapidly changing economic and social environment, and Cowgill highlights the musical transformations that helped to ensure this long-term survival. Finally, discussion broadens to examine the influence of pleasure-garden culture on the concert life and venues of the high Victorian period – including the Crystal Palace, Albert Hall and Alexandra Palace – and ultimately on the early history of the promenade concerts, <b>bringing</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrative</b> up to more recent times. The essay underlines the need for music historians to expand their frames of reference to include sound, rather than music alone, and argues that musical performance in the open air formed an important component of late Georgian entertainment culture. The collection to which this essay contributes was published in the series Penn Studies in Landscape Architecture, and features a number of established cultural historians including John Dixon Hunt and Peter Borsay...|$|E
40|$|I’ve {{always been}} {{attracted}} to organic beauty and the inherent transience of nature, {{as well as the}} dichotomy of life and death and how one cannot be without the other. I’m interested in <b>bringing</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrative</b> of life into my work as well as paying tribute to the complex beauty of what occurs naturally in the world around us. I often focus on one subject in depth to give emphasis to their story in particular, whether it be a place or a living thing. When conveying these ideas I rely on descriptive illustration and concise line work, because of my attraction to the definitive nature of line and stability in a piece that it can imbue. The medium I prefer is ink, which allows for precision and, when desired, adequate rendering. I enjoy the instant gratification and am able to enhance a drawing by means of detail and contrast. I typically choose subject matter that pertains to nature; whether it be organic decay, animals, insects, or plant life. I want my audience to think when they see my work, and to read into the detail as they would a novel; finding the bits of information that I include to inform the viewer of the main subject. For artistic influences, I’m most attracted to the linear language of Art Nouveau. Specifically, the lyrical quality of Alphonse Mucha’s line work. I’m equally as inspired by artists like Christina Mrozik for the ability to create substantially beautiful work that is heightened in effect by her subject matter; she paints and draws flowers and animals that are unnatural in position, often with bone and muscle exhibited in a borderline biological analysis. What attracts me to these things is how they’re able to pull attention to the beauty that is already around us, and create a dialogue between viewers and the things they ignore that live alongside them. If I can give an old story a new face for someone, it would be a greatest success...|$|E
40|$|This general history {{proposes to}} offer a Native American {{perspective}} on Indian-Anglo contact. Wilson 2 ̆ 7 s approach is now fairly standard. He includes substantial quotes from collections of Indian origin traditions and general ethnographic descriptions of elements of Indian cultures, <b>bringing</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrative</b> into the 1970 s with accounts of the Indian occupations of Alcatraz in 1969 and the Wounded Knee trading post in 1972. Wilson 2 ̆ 7 s sympathetic telling of Native history leads to certain problematic interpretations. He describes Aztec leaders, for example, as holding flowers to their noses to counteract the unpleasant body odor of Spanish conquistadors who did not bathe, although Aztec sources describe combinations of flowers {{as a means of}} sustaining the powers of men in high office. Wilson 2 ̆ 7 s history is a synthesis of secondary sources. He employs quotes from primary sources he has gleaned from important books on American Indian history, thereby generating an air of credibility; but his bibliographic notes make clear that he is using quotes other scholars have enlisted to support their arguments. His sources are well chosen, but the latest date from the early 1990 s and do not represent the most current scholarship. The more recent work of such influential scholars as Richard White and Francis Jennings is not included. He incorporates the standard events of conflict between Indians and Americans Removal, Chief Joseph 2 ̆ 7 s flight from the Walowa Valley in Oregon, Standing Bear 2 ̆ 7 s suit against the government, the massacre of Lakota Ghost Dance adherents at Wounded Knee. Where one gets the greatest sense of the continuity of American Indian cultures and their relationship to contemporary American cultures is in the chapter on the Great Plains. Introduced by a discussion of contemporary environmental arguments that the Plains should be returned to grasslands and buffalo, the chapter focuses on the impact of epidemic diseases and warfare on Plains people. It also includes an account of die Five Civilized Tribes-Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, Creek, and Seminole-who were indeed removed to lands west of the Mississippi River, but whose territory in the eastern, mountainous region of what is now the state of Oklahoma did not resemble the true Plains region. Wilson writes in an engaging narrative style. He follows the standard template for Native American history-quotes from origin stories, ethnographic descriptions, reliance on certain standard secondary sources, and a sympathetic stance that portrays Indians as victims of white aggression. The book is a useful synthesis that will appeal to a general readership. Historians will read it with discretion...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{oral history}} has been celebrated by its {{practitioners}} for its humanizing potential, {{and its ability to}} democratize history by <b>bringing</b> <b>the</b> <b>narratives</b> of people and communities typically absent in the archives into conversation with that of the political and intellectual elites who generally write history. And when dealing with <b>the</b> <b>narratives</b> of ordinary people living in conditions of social and political stability, the value of oral history is unquestionable. However, in recent years, oral historians have increasingly expanded their gaze to consider intimate accounts of extreme human experiences, such as narratives of survival and flight in response to mass atrocities. This shift in academic and practical interests begs the questions: Are there limits to oral historical methods and theory? And if so, what are these limits? This paper begins to address these questions by drawing upon fourteen months of fieldwork in Rwanda and Bosnia-Hercegovina, during which I conducted multiple life history interviews with approximately one hundred survivors, ex-combatants, and perpetrators of genocide and related mass atrocities. I argue that there are limits to the application of oral history, particularly when working amid highly politicized research settings...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} Philip Roth’s American trilogy – American Pastoral, I Married a Communist and The Human Stain – {{with emphasis}} on the narrator/author, long-standing Roth character Nathan Zuckerman. I argue that the most fruitful reading of the trilogy is one that constantly keeps in mind that significant portions of the plot are imagined – or “authored” – by this familiar character. Such a reading is aware of how the American trilogy both “rewrites” the previous Zuckerman fictions, and turns {{the stories of the}} three novels’ respective protagonists, Seymour “Swede” Levov, Ira Ringold and Coleman Silk, into useful fictions through which Zuckerman can explore how the myth of America corresponds to the realities of postwar history. The thesis is divided into five chapters. In Chapter 1, I summarize the plot in each novel and make my case for a Zuckerman-centred reading. In Chapter 2, I map out who Zuckerman is and describe the transformation he has gone through when we encounter him in the American trilogy. In Chapter 3, I analyze <b>the</b> <b>narrative</b> strategy in each novel, and discuss the implications of the way Zuckerman explicitly <b>brings</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrative</b> process to our attention.

5000|$|The Hebrew Bible and Old Testament {{with which}} we are {{familiar}} is called the Masoretic text, a text preserved by Jewish rabbis from early in the current era (the Christian era). There are, however, two other major texts, the Septuagint and the Samaritan Pentateuch. The Septuagint ("the seventy," [...] often called the LXX, which is 70 in Latin script) is a Greek translation of the Jewish holy books made in Egypt {{in the last few}} centuries before Christ; it mostly agrees with the Masoretic text, but not in its chronology. The Samaritan text is the text preserved by the Samaritan Jewish community. This community dates from some time in the last few centuries before Christ - just when is disputed - and, like the Septuagint, differs markedly from the Masoretic text in its chronology. Modern scholars do not regard the Masoretic text as superior to the other two - the Masoretic is sometimes clearly wrong, as when it says that Saul began to reign at two years of age and reigned for one year.

25|$|Kaplan credits artist Arnold Tsang {{from coming}} up with the {{preliminary}} designs of all the heroes in <b>the</b> game. <b>The</b> <b>narrative</b> and characters themselves were then developed through an iterative process between the gameplay developers, artists, and promotional media as they worked to <b>bring</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrative</b> together. In this regards, Torbjörn was the defining character for the game, as while he was not created first, his art style was originally created by Tsang to help bridge the gap between the Warcraft universe to Overwatch. Blizzard's art director Sam Didier reviewed Tsang's original design, prompting several questions to help tighten the art design that led to Torbjörn's gameplay mechanics, and subsequently, Torbjörn's appearance was used as a baseline in all other character and map designs to make sure that these assets would appear to fit into the same universe as Torbjörn. Another example is Doomfist, a character introduced into one of the game's promotional videos where his gauntlet was on display. This {{led to the creation of}} one of the maps that expanded upon the Doomfist concept, making that a title passed down among others in the past, and seeding some of the existing heroes' backstory has had connections to the Doomfist title. This process gave them a sufficient starting point to work from in introducing Doomfist as a playable hero in Overwatch. Other examples of similar iterative expansion to the characters given by Metzen and Chu include the heroes Genji and Hanzo who were characters borne out of an initial single character concept and leading to them being rivals of each other, and the introduction of Lúcio as a means to expand upon the loosely connected Vishkar Corporation concept that was part of Symmetra's backstory.|$|R
