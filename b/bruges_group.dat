2500|$|On 16 May 1994, Powell {{spoke at}} the <b>Bruges</b> <b>Group</b> and said Europe had [...] "destroyed one Prime Minister and will destroy another Prime Minister yet" [...] and demanded powers {{surrendered}} to the European Court of Justice to be repatriated. In June 1994, he wrote an article for the Daily Mail, where he stated that [...] "Britain is waking from the nightmare {{of being part of}} the continental bloc, to rediscover that these offshore islands belong to the outside world and lie open to its oceans". Innovations in contemporary society did not worry him: [...] "When exploration has run its course, we shall revert to the normal type of living to which nature and instinct predispose us. The decline will not have been permanent. The deterioration will not have been irreversible".|$|E

The League opposed the recently signed Maastricht Treaty {{and sought to}} sway the governing Conservative Party toward removing the United Kingdom from the European Union (EU). A former Liberal Party candidate, member of the <b>Bruges</b> <b>Group,</b> and professor at the London School of Economics (LSE), Sked had converted to Euroscepticism while teaching the LSE's European Studies programme. Under the Anti-Federalist League's banner, Sked stood as a prospective Member of Parliament (MP) in Bath at the 1992 general election, gaining 0.2% of the vote. At a League meeting held in the LSE on 3 September 1993, the group was renamed the UK Independence Party, deliberately avoiding the term [...] "British" [...] {{so as to avoid}} confusion with the far-right British National Party (BNP).|$|E

50|$|The {{division}} of labour that underlies the practice of industrial design did have precedents in the pre-industrial era. The growth of trade in the medieval period {{led to the emergence}} of large workshops in cities such as Florence, Venice, Nuremberg and <b>Bruges,</b> where <b>groups</b> of more specialized craftsmen made objects with common forms through the repetitive duplication of models which defined by their shared training and technique. Competitive pressures in the early 16th century led to the emergence in Italy and Germany of pattern books: collections of engravings illustrating decorative forms and motifs which could be applied {{to a wide range of}} products, and whose creation took place in advance of their application. The use of drawing to specify how something was to be constructed later was first developed by architects and shipwrights during the Italian Renaissance.|$|R
