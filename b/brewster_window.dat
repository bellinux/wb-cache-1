For this purpose, we have been developing a forced gas-cooled <b>Brewster</b> <b>window</b> with low loss silicon nitride composite (SN- 287 Kyocera) for megawatt and CW power transmission. The thermal analysis of the window with forced gas-cooling on the basis of the finite element method shows a 0. 5 MWCW, HE 1 ' mode transmission is possible to the 100 x 300 mm 2 silicon nitride disk. Since this material has very low thermal expansion coefficient, we first designed and assembled a prototype <b>Brewster</b> <b>window</b> using normal silicon nitride (SN- 220 Kyocera) to check the structure of brazing and welding. To transmit millimeter waves the comrgated waveguide sections are prepared at the both sides of the disk. At the atmospheric side of the waveguide nozzles for gas-cooling are drilled on the wall. The number of the nozzle holes is optimized to be nine with the diameter of lmm, and air is blown on the disk unidirectionally.

The deep-UV output is generally applicable as excitation wavelength {{in the field of}} biochemical and environmental analysis. However, it has received little attention in the literature, probably because a complete laser set-up normally requires a high investment.

40|$|Chemical vapor {{deposition}} (CVD) diamond {{windows are}} a crucial component in heating and current drive (H&CD) applications. In {{order to minimize}} the amount of reflected power from the diamond disc, its thickness must match the desired beam wavelength, thus proper targeting of the plasma requires movable beam reflectors. This is the case, for instance, of the ITER electron cyclotron H&CD system. However, looking at DEMO, the higher heat loads and neutron fluxes could make the use of movable parts close to the plasma difficult. The issue might be solved by using gyrotrons able to tune the beam frequency to the desired resonance, but this concept requires transmission windows that work in a given frequency range, such as the <b>Brewster</b> <b>window.</b> It consists of a CVD diamond disc brazed to two copper cuffs at the Brewster angle. The brazing process is carried out at about 800 °C and then the temperature is decreased down to room temperature. Diamond and copper have very different thermal expansion coefficients, therefore high stresses build up during the cool down phase {{that might lead to}} failure of the disc. Considering also the complex geometry of the window with the skewed position of the disc, analyses are required in the first place to check its feasibility. The cool down phase was simulated by FEM structural analyses for several geometric and constraint configurations of the window.

40|$|In a {{high power}} {{experiment}} using a Russian 140 GHz, 0. 5 MW, 1 s gyrotron the power absorbed in a circular, liquid nitrogen edge cooled, single-disk sapphire window (HEMEX) was determined. Within the experimental uncertainties, the measured loss tangent values of (8 #+-# 4) x 10 "-" 6 in the temperature range between 87 and 95 K {{are in good}} agreement with cold test measurements. The assessment of a medium aspect ratio elongated liquid nitrogen edge cooled, single-disk sapphire window has shown, {{that the use of}} an elliptical rf beam with flattened power distribution and an aspect ratio of 8 : 1 (252 mm x 32 mm window aperture) or of a ring-shaped elliptical beam with an aspect ratio of 3 : 1 (156 mm x 52 mm) allows a power transmission capability of 1 MW, CW at 170 GHz. Finite element calculations on stress distribution at 5 bar overpressure show that all stresses are well below the admissible limits. A principle design of the window assembly is presented. Finite element calculations on a liquid neon edge cooled, single-disk sapphire window using pessimistic values of loss tangent and thermal conductivity give a CW power transmission capability for a Gaussian/HE_ 1 _ 1 -power distribution of 2. 8 MW, 2. 3 MW and 1. 8 MW at 140 GHz, 170 GHz and 220 GHz, respectively, allowing even 2 MW, CW windows at 170 GHz. Calculations on stress distribution (5 bar overpressure) and a final principle design were done. Finite element calculations on a large aspect ratio rectangular <b>Brewster</b> <b>window</b> (680 mm x 12 mm) with water edge cooling at 293 K show that Au-doped silicon and PACVD diamond are possible candidates for CW operation around 170 GHz. Diamond is preferable since there is no danger of enhanced losses due to thermal excitation of charge carriers at temperatures higher than 350 K. The final design of the window assembly is presented. The total losses of the assembly (7. 3 %) can be reduced to approximately 3 % by using periodically rippled wall mode converters to generate the 90 % HE_ 1 _ 1 / 10 % HE_ 1 _ 2 (in phase) mode mixture for optimum coupling to the free-space Gaussian mode.

40|$|A folded {{resonator}} {{requires an}} oblique {{angle of incidence}} on the folded curved mirror, which introduces astigmatic distortions that limit {{the performance of the}} lasers. We present a simple method to compensate the astigmatism of folded resonator without <b>Brewster</b> <b>windows</b> {{for the first time to}} the best of our knowledge. Based on the theory of the propagation and transformation of Gaussian beams, the method is both effective and reliable. Theoretical results show that the folded resonator can be compensated astigmatism completely when the following two conditions are fulfilled. Firstly, when the Gaussian beam with a determined size beam waist is obliquely incident on an off-axis concave mirror, two new Gaussian beam respectively in the tangential and sagittal planes are formed. Another off-axis concave mirror is located at another intersection point of the two new Gaussian beams. Secondly, adjusting the incident angle of the second concave mirror or its focal length can make the above two Gaussian beam coincide in the image plane of the second concave mirror, which compensates the astigmatic aberration completely. A side-pumped continues-wave (CW) passively mode locked Nd:YAG laser was taken as an example of the astigmatically compensated folded resonators. The experimental results show good agreement with the theoretical predictions. This method can be used effectively to design astigmatically compensated cavities resonator of high-performance lasers.

Systematic effects due to variations in temperature, pressure, and optical density were measured for this rotational-vibrational transition pair.

We show that flow cytometric {{measurement of the}} depolarization forward scattered light using a <b>Brewster's</b> <b>Window</b> Analyzer {{can be used to}} quantify the degree of calcification of coccolithophores at the single-cell level. Calcite-containing particles or cells were distinguished from non-calcified particles or cells by high values of forward scatter light with polarization orthogonal to that of the laser. Forward scatter polarization state varied strongly and linearly with the number of attached coccoliths per coccosphere when Emiliania huxleyi cells were first completely decalcified and then allowed to rebuild coccospheres. Cells of the heavily calcified E. huxleyi R-morphotype strain NZEH were also grown in different extracellular Ca 2 + concentrations, forming complete coccospheres that contained similar numbers of attached coccoliths but varied in total calcite mass. Forward scatter polarization state varied strongly and linearly with coccosphere calcite mass. In contrast, forward scatter polarization state of detached coccoliths did not vary significantly with calcite weight, although forward scatter and side scatter did. Treatments had relatively minor effects on forward scatter, side scatter and forward scatter polarization state of decalcified cells, suggesting that depolarization of forward scatter light from E. huxleyi cells might be linearly determined, to a first approximation, by the ratio of surface calcite to organic protoplast. We suggest that flow cytometric measurement of forward scatter depolarization provides a potentially valuable method for analysis of calcification state of individual cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{gyrotron}} is {{a special}} type of vacuum electron tube, which allows the generation or amplification of the highest frequencies (> 100 GHz) at very high power levels (> 1 MW). The high power millimeter wave guiding components have to be integrated into an ultra high vacuum system. To be able to verify their proper behavior under normal atmospheric conditions at low power levels, special measurement techniques are required. One task of this work was the development of such techniques. The main demand for this low power analysis is the excitation of high order modes, identical to those needed for the generation of extremely high power levels inside the gyrotron resonator. In order to optimize {{the performance of the}} quasi-optical mode generators that are constructed for this purpose, special techniques for the low power mode purity analysis as well as a new vector millimeter wave network analyzer had to be developed. These new measurement systems were successfully used for the experimental optimization of the high frequency outcoupling of the gyrotron. These results also have been verified by high power test. The second emphasis of this work was the development of broadband millimeter wave windows for gyrotrons with quasi-optical radio frequency outcoupling. The main restriction for the stepwise frequency tuned operation of this millimeter wave oscillator has been given by the output window mounted perpendicular to the ray paths. To overcome this frequency dependent transmission behavior, {{for the very first time}} a gyrotron oscillator was equipped with a <b>Brewster</b> angle <b>window.</b> By using the <b>Brewster</b> angle output <b>window</b> a series of modes at different frequencies were coupled out with almost the same intensity, whereas the window mounted perpendicular to the ray paths shows a strong frequency selective behavior.

These results achieved, in cooperation with a Japanese working team, imply a genuine solution for a continuous wave 1 MW gyrotron output window. (orig.)

Schawlow and Townes had already applied for a patent on the laser, in July 1958. Their patent was granted on March 22, 1960. Gould and TRG launched a legal challenge based on his 1957 notebook as evidence that Gould had invented the laser prior to Schawlow and Townes's patent application. (At the time, the United States used a first to invent system for patents.) While this challenge was being fought in the Patent Office and the courts, further applications were filed on specific laser technologies by Bell Labs, Hughes Research Laboratories, Westinghouse, and others. Gould ultimately lost {{the battle for the}} U.S. patent on the laser itself, primarily on the grounds that his notebook did not explicitly say that the sidewalls of the laser medium were to be transparent, even though he planned to optically pump the gain medium through them, and considered loss of light through the sidewalls by diffraction. Questions were also raised about whether Gould's notebook provided sufficient information to allow a laser to be constructed, given that Gould's team at TRG was unable to do so. Gould was able to obtain patents on the laser in several other countries, however, and he continued fighting for U.S. patents on specific laser technologies for many years afterward.|$|R

Techniques have been developed to measure the populations of these metastable and resonance trapped levels by comparing the light emitted {{from the side of the}} laser tube to the light emitted from the end of the tube along the tube axis. Absolute values for the populations of the upper and lower level of the laser transition have also been obtained without the use of a calibrated detector. The different mechanisms whereby excited states may be populated in a gas discharge are discussed, and cross-sections for the different collision processes estimated. These are used together with the measured values of populations, to determine the likely dominant processes in the afterglow. Measurements of the rates of decay of the populations of the levels in Helium, Neon, Carbon and Nitrogen show a correlation between the populations of the metastable states of Helium and Neon and the 3 p levels of Carbon and Nitrogen.
