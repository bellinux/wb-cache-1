500|$|The apothecaries' pound in Venice had {{exactly the}} same subdivisions {{as those in the}} non-Romance countries, but its total weight of 301g was at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>range.</b> During the Habsburg reign of 1814–1859 an {{exception}} was made for Venice; as a result the extreme weights of 301g and 420g coexisted within one state and in immediate proximity. The Venice standard was also used elsewhere, for example in Udine. In Dubrovnik (called [...] "Ragusa" [...] until 1909) its use was partially continued {{for a long time in}} spite of the official Habsburg weight reform.|$|E
2500|$|Cromwell's {{paternal}} grandfather Sir Henry Williams {{was one of}} the two wealthiest landowners in Huntingdonshire. Cromwell's father Robert was {{of modest}} means but still a part of the gentry class. As a younger son with many siblings, Robert inherited only a house at Huntingdon and a small amount of land. This land would have generated an income of up to £300 a year, near the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> of gentry incomes. Cromwell himself in 1654 said, [...] "I was by birth a gentleman, living neither in considerable height, nor yet in obscurity".|$|E
2500|$|Regarding {{the sheer}} size of Callas's instrument, Celletti says, [...] "Her voice was penetrating. The volume as such was average: neither small nor powerful. But the penetration, allied to this incisive quality (which bordered on the ugly because it {{frequently}} contained an element of harshness) ensured that her voice could be clearly heard anywhere in the auditorium." [...] Rodolfo Celletti wrote that Callas had [...] "a voluminous, penetrating, and dark voice" [...] ("una voce voluminosa, squillante e di timbro scuro"). After her first performance of Medea in 1953, the critic for Musical Courier wrote that [...] "she displayed a vocal generosity that was scarcely believable for its amplitude and resilience." [...] In a 1982 Opera News interview with Joan Sutherland and Richard Bonynge, Bonynge stated, [...] "But before she slimmed down, I mean this was such a colossal voice. It just poured out of her, the way Flagstad's did.... Callas had a huge voice. When she and Stignani sang Norma, at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> you could barely tell who was who ... Oh it was colossal. And she took the big sound right up to the top." [...] In his book, Michael Scott makes the distinction that whereas Callas's pre-1954 voice was a [...] "dramatic soprano with an exceptional top", after the weight loss, it became, as one Chicago critic described the voice in Lucia, a [...] "huge soprano leggiero".|$|E
