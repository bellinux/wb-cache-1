5|$|Before the Georgian era, the Treasury of England {{was led by}} the Lord High Treasurer. By {{the late}} Tudor period, the Lord High Treasurer was {{regarded}} as one of the Great Officers of State and tended to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>dominant</b> figure in government: the Duke of Somerset, Lord High Treasurer (1547–1549), served as Lord Protector to his nephew King Edward VI; Lord Burghley, Lord High Treasurer (1572–1598), was the dominant minister among Queen Elizabeth I's ministers; Burghley's son Lord Salisbury succeeded his father as chief minister to Elizabeth I (1598–1603) and later served King James I as Lord High Treasurer (1608–1612).|$|E
5|$|Beta Pictoris {{shows an}} excess of {{infrared}} emission compared to normal stars of its type, which is caused by large quantities of dust and gas (including carbon monoxide) near the star. Detailed observations reveal a large disk of dust and gas orbiting the star, {{which was the first}} debris disk to be imaged around another star. In addition to the presence of several planetesimal belts and cometary activity, there are indications that planets have formed within this disk and that the processes of planet formation may still be ongoing. Material from the Beta Pictoris debris disk is thought to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>dominant</b> source of interstellar meteoroids in the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, {{others were}} {{also working on}} the {{development}} of sound-on-film. In 1919, the same year that DeForest received his first patents in the field, three German inventors, Josef Engl (1893–1942), Hans Vogt (1890–1979), and Joseph Massolle (1889–1957), patented the Tri-Ergon sound system. On September 17, 1922, the Tri-Ergon group gave a public screening of sound-on-film productions—including a dramatic talkie, Der Brandstifter (The Arsonist) —before an invited audience at the Alhambra Kino in Berlin. By the end of the decade, Tri-Ergon would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>dominant</b> European sound system. In 1923, two Danish engineers, Axel Petersen and Arnold Poulsen, patented a system that recorded sound on a separate filmstrip running parallel with the image reel. Gaumont licensed the technology and briefly put it to commercial use under the name Cinéphone.|$|E

5|$|The {{means by}} which gamma-ray bursts convert energy into {{radiation}} remains poorly understood, and as of 2010 {{there was still no}} generally accepted model for how this process occurs. Any successful model of GRB emission must explain the physical process for generating gamma-ray emission that matches the observed diversity of light curves, spectra, and other characteristics. Particularly challenging is the need to explain the very high efficiencies that are inferred from some explosions: some gamma-ray bursts may convert as much as half (or more) of the explosion energy into gamma-rays. Early observations of the bright optical counterparts to GRB 990123 and to GRB 080319B, whose optical light curves were extrapolations of the gamma-ray light spectra, have suggested that inverse Compton may <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>dominant</b> process in some events. In this model, pre-existing low-energy photons are scattered by relativistic electrons within the explosion, augmenting their energy by a large factor and transforming them into gamma-rays.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of methane and possibly nitrogen suggests that Makemake {{could have a}} transient atmosphere {{similar to that of}} Pluto near its perihelion. Nitrogen, if present, will <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>dominant</b> component of it. The existence of an atmosphere also provides a natural explanation for the nitrogen depletion: because the gravity of Makemake is weaker than that of Pluto, Eris and Triton, a large amount of nitrogen was probably lost via atmospheric escape; methane is lighter than nitrogen, but has significantly lower vapor pressure at temperatures prevalent at the surface of Makemake (32–36K), which hinders its escape; the result of this process is a higher relative abundance of methane. However, studies of Pluto's atmosphere by New Horizons suggest that methane, not nitrogen, is the dominant escaping gas, suggesting that the reasons for Makemake's absence of nitrogen may be more complicated.|$|E
5|$|The tunnel {{runs through}} {{an area with}} complex and varied geology. It runs through two rock complexes, the Halsnøy Basement Rock on the Sveio side, and Hardangerfjord Cover Complex on the Stord side. Both were created during the {{creation}} of the Caledonian orogeny 500 million years ago. The Halsnøy Basement Rock consists of Precambrian rock with elements of gneiss of both sedimentary and magmatic origin. They range between granite gneiss to mylonite. In the area between the two complexes, there is some amount of gabbro. At the lowest point, the tunnel runs through a section of phyllite, which continues to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>dominant</b> species until the tunnel reaches Otterøya. Below the island the tunnel reaches a section of greenstone, before it rises again through more phyllite.|$|E
