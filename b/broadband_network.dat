The {{three most important}} broadband wireless technologies are IEEE 802. 11, IEEE 802. 16, and Wireless Mesh Network (WMN). Security attacks and vulnerabilities vary amongst these <b>broadband</b> wireless <b>networks</b> because of differences in topologies, network operations and physical setups.

In this paper, we discuss the fundamental issues that have to be tackled in order to provide broadband services that are currently available (or will very shortly be) to wireline hosts. We compare and contrast the architectures that have been proposed for extending the <b>broadband</b> wireline <b>network</b> infrastructure to the wireless environment. We argue that transporting small ATM cells over the air leads to inefficient utilization of the already scarce transmission capacity. Subsequently, we propose an architecture for integrated wireless and wireline <b>broadband</b> <b>networks.</b> The proposed architecture allows us to design the wireline and the wirele [...] ...|$|R

25|$|The National <b>Broadband</b> <b>Network</b> was {{initially}} a fibre {{to the home}} (FTTH) open-access network in planning and trial operation in Australia by the federal government. The national <b>broadband</b> <b>network</b> aimed to provide up to 1000 Mbit/s speeds and to connect to 93% of Australian households and businesses. This has since been revised under a Coalition government to a Mixed-Technology system relying largely on Australia's existing and largely depreciated Copper networks. This revision aims for 25 Mbit/s to 100 Mbit/s, with consumer reports ranging from 1 Mbit/s to 100 Mbit/s. The Australian government had previously called for proposals to build a Fibre to the Node (FTTN) <b>broadband</b> <b>network</b> providing download speeds up to 100 and upload speeds up to 40Megabits per second. The government also utlilises fixed wireless technology and satellite technology to provide fast broadband connection in rural area and very remote area. Fixed wireless provides speeds up to 50/20 Mbit/s. Satellite technology uses sky muster communication satellite which was launched in October 2015 to provide fast broadband in very remote area. It provides speeds up to 25/5 Mbit/s. The network will be the largest single infrastructure investment in Australia's history. In February 2017, the Federal Government of Australia funded the project for the NBN in order to build a mixed technology network.|$|E
