5|$|A {{reviewer}} at RPGFan {{praised the}} game for its plot, its intimate scope, and its music, while a writer for Famitsu found the game's mood to <b>be</b> <b>boring.</b> As the science fiction elements were well received, later entries in the series gradually {{moved away from the}} dating theme and became more focused on science fiction. The PlayStation Portable version of the game was the 967th best selling video game of the year in Japan in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Calisthenics, {{especially}} as {{done in the}} huge formations favored at the time, could <b>be</b> <b>boring,</b> and {{at the high school}} and college levels, games such as baseball and rugby were more often spectator sports than a practical source of physical exercise for the masses. Moreover, at elite levels, baseball, football, and even judo did not put much emphasis on moral or intellectual development. Instead, elite coaches and athletes tended to emphasize winning, at almost any cost.|$|E
5|$|The album {{received}} {{a score of}} 70/100 from Dutch-language music site Metalfan.NL, which preferred the DVD to the CD version. French-language site MusicWaves gave the album a rating of 4 out of 5 stars, and compared Wednesday 13's style to that of Alice Cooper and Marilyn Manson. The album {{received a}} rating of 8/10 from German-language site Metal.de, which recommended it as a good gift. The Swedish-language review site Hallowed.se found the album to <b>be</b> <b>boring.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Sir Richmond {{suddenly}} remembered Miss Seyffert and half {{turned his face}} towards her. Her forehead was just visible over {{the hood of the}} open coupe. She appeared to be intelligently intent upon the scenery. Then he broke out suddenly into a tirade against the world. [...] "But I <b>am</b> <b>bored</b> by this jostling unreasonable world. At {{the bottom of my heart}} I am bitterly resentful to-day. This is a world of fools and brutes in which we live, a world of idiotic traditions, imbecile limitations, cowardice, habit, greed and mean cruelty. It is a slum of a world, a congested district, an insanitary jumble of souls and bodies. Every good thing, every sweet desire is thwarted--every one. I have to lead the life of a slum missionary, a sanitary inspector, an underpaid teacher. I <b>am</b> <b>bored.</b> Oh God! how I <b>am</b> <b>bored!</b> I <b>am</b> <b>bored</b> by our laws and customs. I <b>am</b> <b>bored</b> by our rotten empire and its empty monarchy. I <b>am</b> <b>bored</b> by its parades and its flags and its sham enthusiasms. I <b>am</b> <b>bored</b> by London and its life, by its smart life and by its servile life alike. I <b>am</b> <b>bored</b> by theatres and by books and by every sort of thing that people call pleasure. I <b>am</b> <b>bored</b> by the brag of people and the claims of people and the feelings of people. Damn people! I <b>am</b> <b>bored</b> by profiteers and by the snatching they call business enterprise. Damn every business man! I <b>am</b> <b>bored</b> by politics and the universal mismanagement of everything. I <b>am</b> <b>bored</b> by France, by Anglo-Saxondom, by German self-pity, by Bolshevik fanaticism. I <b>am</b> <b>bored</b> by these fools' squabbles that devastate the world. I <b>am</b> <b>bored</b> by Ireland, Orange and Green. Curse the Irish--north and south together! Lord! how I HATE the Irish from Carson to the last Sinn Feiner! And I <b>am</b> <b>bored</b> by India and by Egypt. I <b>am</b> <b>bored</b> by Poland and by Islam. I <b>am</b> <b>bored</b> by anyone who professes to have rights. Damn their rights! Curse their rights! I <b>am</b> <b>bored</b> to death by this year and by last year and by the prospect of next year. I am bored--I am horribly bored--by my work. I <b>am</b> <b>bored</b> by every sort of renunciation. I want to live with the woman I love and I want to work within the limits of my capacity. Curse all Hullo! Damn his eyes!--Steady, ah!

5|$|Day of the Tentacle {{features}} a four-minute long animated opening credit sequence, the first LucasArts game to have such. Ahern noted that their previous games would run the credits over primarily still shots which would only {{last for a}} few minutes, but with Tentacle, the team had grown so large that they worried this approach would <b>be</b> <b>boring</b> to players. They assigned Kyle Balda, an intern at CalArts, to create the animated sequence, with Chan helping to create minimalist backgrounds {{to aid in the}} animation. Originally this sequence was around seven minutes long, and included the three characters arriving at the mansion and releasing Purple Tentacle. Another LucasArts designer, Hal Barwood, suggested they cut it in half, leading to the shortened version as in the released game, and having the player take over when they arrive at the mansion.|$|E

Dr. James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) attempts to convince the curmudgeonly Gregory House to treat Adler, but House initially dismisses him, believing that the case would <b>be</b> <b>boring.</b> Hospital administrator Dr. Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) approaches House in the elevator and attempts to persuade him to fulfill his duties at the hospital's walk-in clinic, a task House loathes because the cases are usually simplistic. House refuses, claiming that Cuddy cannot fire him due to tenure, and hurriedly leaves. When House's team attempts to perform an MRI on Adler, they discover that House's authorization for diagnostics has been revoked; Cuddy restores his authorization in exchange for his working at the clinic.|$|E

30|$|After obtaining 30 {{waveforms}} on a sound specimen, a 3  mm diameter hole <b>was</b> <b>bored</b> at {{the center}} of a cross section. Then, 30 waveforms were obtained at the cross section of interest. Then, a second hole of the same diameter <b>was</b> <b>bored.</b> The procedure of obtaining a waveform and <b>boring</b> another hole <b>was</b> repeated until the number of holes reached nine. All of the holes penetrated only early wood and were made as close to the center as possible. The holes <b>were</b> <b>bored</b> to a depth of 50  mm. Because holes <b>were</b> <b>bored</b> close to the center, ultrasound always passed through the holes. The contact area was 346  mm 2 (diameter of couplant was 21  mm).|$|R

25|$|He had {{a distant}} {{relationship}} with his youngest brother, but a close one with Manfred. Unlike most Prussian nobles Wolfram von Richthofen went to the local Gymnasium (academic high school) {{and did not have}} private tutors at home. He attended school in Striegau. His grades in mathematics and German language were good, but he did not excel at foreign languages (in which he scored average to poor results). He found studying language to <b>be</b> <b>boring,</b> but did learn Italian and could converse competently in it in later life.|$|E
25|$|Air : The air {{signs are}} Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius. A native with mainly air signs {{will be an}} {{excellent}} communicator, concerned with ideas and theories of all kinds. They are looking for answers to life's questions and make good teachers and writers. Air people are more tense than they appear at first sight and may live on their nerves. They have many friends and acquaintances but may not be particularly interested in family life. They {{are interested in the}} latest technologies and are able to do a number of things at once. Air subjects are also very imaginative and quick-witted, but may be sarcastic and rude. A subject lacking air signs will have little imagination and lightness of touch. They have an over-emphasis on practicalities and can lack a sense of humour, and <b>be</b> <b>boring</b> company. They can find it difficult to communicate or to assimilate and explain new ideas. Planets in the 3rd, 7th and 11th houses, and an emphasis on mutable signs in the chart will help to compensate for this lack.|$|E
5000|$|In {{recognition}} of the author's many years {{he thought about the}} form in which the book could be presented to Russian readers and in 2008 moved it into Russian (having supplied the text of twenty years ago by later comments), and only in 2012 he published the Russian edition of the publication. The book was published in Moscow in [...] "Astrel" [...] publishing house. The book used photos from the personal archive of the author. Design of the Russian edition met with sharp criticism of the art director of the publishing house Penguin Books Paul Buckley: [...] "Everything here <b>is</b> <b>boring.</b> Photo <b>is</b> <b>boring,</b> font <b>is</b> <b>boring,</b> layout <b>is</b> <b>boring</b> and who may be interested in such a book In the US?

500|$|An {{important}} {{criterion for}} inclusion {{is that a}} painting or sculpture must not <b>be</b> <b>boring.</b> Michael Frank says they {{are not interested in}} commercial works like Dogs Playing Poker: [...] "We collect things made in earnest, where people attempted to make art and something went wrong, either in the execution or in the original premise."

500|$|Writing for Computer & Video Games, Matthew Woodley {{praised the}} game's variety and interface. While he disliked its long loading times, he {{believed}} that they were [...] "a {{small price to pay for}} such a brilliant game". However, Labyrinth was criticized by the three reviewers of Zzap!64. Although he praised its visuals, co-reviewer Paul Sumner called the game too slow-paced for an action title and too simplistic for an adventure. Co-reviewer Julian Rignall considered it to <b>be</b> <b>boring</b> and [...] "a real disappointment", given Lucasfilm's strong track record.|$|E

It was written by Jordon Omley, Michael Mani, Wayne Wilkins, Louis Biancaniello and Ryan Tedder. Tedder explained {{that he wanted to}} create an edgy song for Lewis so that it would not <b>be</b> <b>boring</b> or predictable. A Contemporary R and urban song, the lyrics focus the failure of a relationship.

500|$|Recording {{began in}} Trident Studios in October 1975 [...] with {{producer}} David Hentschel.

Collins thought the group could carry on as an instrumental act, but other group members felt that it would <b>be</b> <b>boring</b> without vocals. [...] The group had still not decided on a replacement singer, {{so they decided to}} start recording backing tracks and audition singers as they went.|$|E
500|$|Other early {{documented}} uses of {{the phrase}} are from reviews by critic Mike Saunders. In the November 12, 1970 issue of Rolling Stone, he commented on an album put out the previous year by the British band Humble Pie: [...] "Safe as Yesterday Is, their first American release, proved that Humble Pie could <b>be</b> <b>boring</b> in lots of different ways. Here they were a noisy, unmelodic, heavy metal-leaden shit-rock band with the loud and noisy parts beyond doubt. There {{were a couple of}} nice songs...and one monumental pile of refuse". He described the band's latest, self-titled release as [...] "more of the same 27th-rate heavy metal crap".|$|E

500|$|I don't think it's {{important}} to take it too literally.

We can't just keep distracting ourselves we do have to educate ourselves and wake up and do something about it.

500|$|Ports of Night Trap {{to other}} {{platforms}} received more harsh reviews; critics felt the game did not age well. Staff at GamePro {{said it was}} [...] "innovative at one time, but Traps graphics and sounds now play like standard stuff."

[...] Critics overwhelmingly found the game to <b>be</b> <b>boring</b> and dull. On a positive note, however, they did agree that the 3DO and 32X provided a larger color palette and higher-quality video than the Sega CD original. Night Trap was a commercial success, with sales totaling 400,000 copies by 1998.|$|E
