40|$|The {{quantification}} {{of human}} immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) RNA has facilitated clinical research and expedited the development of antiretroviral drugs. The branched-DNA (<b>bDNA)</b> <b>assay</b> provides a reliable method for the quantification of HIV- 1 RNA in human plasma and {{is considered one of}} the most reproducible assays ready for use in clinical trials. A series of oligonucleotide probe design and solution changes have been developed to enhance the sensitivity of the <b>bDNA</b> <b>assay</b> while maintaining its performance characteristics. Among the changes incorporated into the enhanced-sensitivity bDNA (ES <b>bDNA)</b> <b>assay</b> to reduce the background level and enhance the signal are the use of shorter overhang sequences of target probes for capture, the cruciform design of target probes for amplification, and the addition of preamplifier molecules. The ES <b>bDNA</b> <b>assay</b> is at least 20 -fold more sensitive than the first-generation <b>bDNA</b> <b>assay,</b> yet it maintains a high level of accuracy, linearity, and reproducibility. Further, quantification values obtained with the ES <b>bDNA</b> <b>assay</b> and the first-generation <b>bDNA</b> <b>assay</b> are highly correlated, thus allowing for meaningful comparisons of HIV- 1 RNA levels in specimens tested with either assay. The ES <b>bDNA</b> <b>assay</b> may be useful in determining the prognostic value of HIV- 1 RNA levels of below 10, 000 copies per ml and in assessing the clinical benefit of antiretroviral therapy-induced decreases in plasma HIV- 1 RNA sustained at levels of below 10, 000 copies per ml...|$|E
40|$|Quantification of {{cytomegalovirus}} (CMV) DNA {{in blood}} may {{aid in the}} identification of patients at highest risk for developing CMV disease, the evaluation of new therapeutics, and the prompt recognition of drug-resistant CMV strains. A branched-DNA (<b>bDNA)</b> <b>assay</b> was developed for the reliable quantification of CMV DNA in peripheral blood leukocytes. The <b>bDNA</b> <b>assay</b> allowed for the highly specific and reproducible quantification of CMV DNA in clinical specimens. Furthermore, the <b>bDNA</b> <b>assay</b> was at least as sensitive as culture techniques and displayed a nearly 3 log 10 dynamic range in quantification. Changes in CMV DNA levels measured by the <b>bDNA</b> <b>assay</b> in a human immunodeficiency virus-positive patient undergoing therapy were consistent with CMV culture, antigen, and genotype results and correlated with disease progression and resistance markers. The <b>bDNA</b> <b>assay</b> for the quantification of CMV DNA may provide a useful tool {{that can be used to}} aid physicians in monitoring disease progression, evaluating therapeutic regimens, and recognizing viral resistance and drug failure...|$|E
40|$|We have {{evaluated}} the VERSANT HCV RNA 3. 0. Assay (HCV 3. 0 <b>bDNA</b> <b>assay)</b> (Bayer Diagnostics, Berkeley, Calif.), {{which is an}} improved signal amplification procedure for the HCV 2. 0 <b>bDNA</b> <b>assay</b> for the quantitation of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA in serum or plasma of HCV-infected individuals. The HCV 3. 0 <b>bDNA</b> <b>assay</b> has a linear dynamic range of 2. 5 × 103 to 4. 0 × 107 HCV RNA copies per ml (c/ml). The performance of the HCV 3. 0 <b>bDNA</b> <b>assay</b> was evaluated using three different test panels. An overall specificity of 96. 8 % relative to the detection limit of the HCV 3. 0 <b>bDNA</b> <b>assay</b> was found. The intra- and interrun reproducibilities for both the dilution panel and the NAP (AcroMetrix, Benicia, Calif.) panel were consistent with coefficients of variation of less than 9 %. Quantitation with the HCV 3. 0 <b>bDNA</b> <b>assay</b> was linear over {{the entire range of}} both panels (ranges of 4. 4 × 103 to 3. 5 × 106 c/ml and 5 × 103 to 2 × 106 IU/ml, respectively), with correlation coefficients of 0. 999, slopes close to one, and intercepts close to zero. The regression equation indicated that 1 IU corresponded to about 4. 8 copies of HCV RNA. A correlation coefficient of 0. 941 was found for HCV RNA values (in international units per milliliter) obtained from the HCV 3. 0 <b>bDNA</b> <b>assay</b> and the HCV Monitor version 2. 0 assay (HCV Monitor 2. 0 assay) (Roche Diagnostic Systems, Branchburg, N. J.). Quantitative results obtained close to the lower limit of the HCV 3. 0 <b>bDNA</b> <b>assay</b> might imply that its lower limit should be reconsidered and raised, if necessary. It appeared that quantitation values obtained from the HCV Monitor 2. 0 assay of between 5 × 102 and 105 IU/ml were in general higher than those obtained from the HCV 3. 0 <b>bDNA</b> <b>assay,</b> whereas values obtained from the HCV Monitor 2. 0 assay were underestimated for samples with HCV RNA levels above 105 IU/ml...|$|E
40|$|Branched DNA (bDNA) is {{a signal}} {{amplification}} technology used in clinical and research laboratories to quantitatively detect nucleic acids. An overnight incubation {{is a significant}} drawback of highly sensitive <b>bDNA</b> <b>assays.</b> The VERSANT® HIV- 1 RNA 3. 0 <b>Assay</b> (<b>bDNA)</b> ("Versant Assay") currently used in clinical laboratories was modified to allow shorter target incubation, enabling the viral load assay to be run in a single day. To dramatically reduce the target incubation from 16 - 18 h to 2. 5 h, composition of only the "Lysis Diluent" solution was modified. Nucleic acid probes in the assay were unchanged. Performance of the modified assay (assay in development; not commercially available) was evaluated and compared to the Versant Assay. Dilution series replicates (> 950 results) were used to demonstrate that analytical sensitivity, linearity, accuracy, and precision for the shorter modified assay are comparable to the Versant Assay. HIV RNA-positive clinical specimens (n = 135) showed {{no significant difference in}} quantification between the modified assay and the Versant Assay. Equivalent relative quantification of samples of eight genotypes was demonstrated for the two assays. Elevated levels of several potentially interfering endogenous substances had no effect on quantification or specificity of the modified assay. The modified assay with drastically improved turnaround time demonstrates the viability of signal-amplifying technology, such as bDNA, {{as an alternative to the}} PCR-based assays dominating viral load monitoring in clinical laboratories. Highly sensitive <b>bDNA</b> <b>assays</b> with a single day turnaround may be ideal for laboratories with especially stringent cost, contamination, or reliability requirements...|$|R
40|$|A key {{advantage}} of monitoring HIV viral load (VL) in persons receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) {{is the ability}} to detect virologic failure before clinical deterioration or resistance occurs. Detection of virologic failure will help clarify the need for enhanced adherence counseling or a change to second- line therapy. Low-cost, locally performable alternates to expensive VL assays are needed where resources are limited. We monitored the response to 48 -week ART in 100 treatment-naïve Kenyan adults using a low-cost VL measurement, the Cavidi reverse transcriptase (RT) assay and gold-standard assays, Roche RNA PCR and Bayer Versant HIV- 1 RNA (<b>bDNA)</b> <b>assays.</b> In Altman-Bland plots, the mean difference in viral loads between the three assays was small (or = 400 copies/ml compared to gold-standard assays. After 24 weeks of treatment, viral load measured by the RT assay was undetectable in 95 % of 65 patients with undetectable RNA PCR VL (< 400 copies/ml), 90 % of 67 patients with undetectable bDNA VL, and 96 % of 57 patients with undetectable VL in both RNA PCR and <b>bDNA</b> <b>assays.</b> The negative predictive value of the RT assay was 100 % compared to either assay; the positive predictive value was 86 % compared to RNA PCR and 70 % compared to <b>bDNA.</b> The RT <b>assay</b> compared well with gold standard assays. Our study highlights the importance of not interchanging viral load assays when monitoring an individual patient.

40|$|Quantification {{of human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) RNA {{as a measure of}} viral load has greatly improved the monitoring of therapies for infected individuals. With the significant reductions in viral load now observed in individuals treated with highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART), viral load assays have been adapted to achieve greater sensitivity. Two commercially available ultrasensitive assays, the Bayer Quantiplex HIV- 1 bDNA version 3. 0 (<b>bDNA</b> 3. 0) <b>assay</b> and the Roche Amplicor HIV- 1 Monitor Ultrasensitive version 1. 5 (Amplicor 1. 5) assay, are now being used to monitor HIV- 1 -infected individuals. Both of these ultrasensitive assays have a reported lower limit of 50 HIV- 1 RNA copies/ml and were developed from corresponding older generation assays with lower limits of 400 to 500 copies/ml. However, the comparability of viral load data generated by these ultrasensitive assays and the relative costs of labor, disposables, and biohazardous wastes were not determined in most cases. In this study, we used matched clinical plasma samples to compare the quantification of the newer <b>bDNA</b> 3. 0 <b>assay</b> with that of the older <b>bDNA</b> 2. 0 <b>assay</b> and to compare the quantification and costs of the <b>bDNA</b> 3. 0 <b>assay</b> and the Amplicor 1. 5 assay. We found that quantification by the <b>bDNA</b> 3. 0 <b>assay</b> was approximately twofold higher than that by the <b>bDNA</b> 2. 0 <b>assay</b> and was highly correlated to that by the Amplicor 1. 5 assay. Moreover, cost analysis based on labor, disposables, and biohazardous wastes showed significant savings with the <b>bDNA</b> 3. 0 <b>assay</b> as compared to the costs of the Amplicor 1. 5 assay...|$|R
40|$|The optimal {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) DNA quantitative assay {{for clinical}} use remains to be determined. We examined the sensitivity, linearity, and variability of a novel second-generation antibody capture solution hybridization assay, the Digene Hybrid Capture II assay (HCII), and compared it with another widely used solution hybridization assay, the branched-DNA (<b>bDNA)</b> <b>assay</b> (Quantiplex; Chiron Corp.). Our results showed similar and satisfactory assay linearity values, as well as interassay and intra-assay variability values, for both HCII and bDNA assays across different ranges of HBV DNA. Ninety-one percent of 102 serum samples from hepatitis B surface antigen-positive patients showed concordant results with the two assays. The HCH assay was more sensitive than the <b>bDNA</b> <b>assay</b> by 1 dilution, with the lowest reading being 0. 9 pg/ml (3. 8 pg/ml by <b>bDNA</b> <b>assay).</b> The HBV DNA seropositivity rates for the 102 samples were 58, 67, and 97 % by bDNA, HCII, and nested PCR, respectively. While the relationship between results obtained with the <b>bDNA</b> <b>assay</b> and those with the HCII assay was nonlinear, with the <b>bDNA</b> <b>assay</b> yielding values 2. 83 ± 0. 92 -fold {{higher than those of}} the HCII assay, especially at high HBV DNA levels, a linear relationship was observed between the two sets of data after logarithmic conversion. The formula for interassay conversion of results was derived as follows: HBV DNA by HCII (picograms per milliliter) = 3. 19 x [HBV DNA by bDNA (megaequivalents per milliliter) ] 0. 866. The HCII assay was technically less complex and required a shorter assay time (4 h) than the <b>bDNA</b> <b>assay</b> (24 h). We conclude that the HCII assay compares favorably with the <b>bDNA</b> <b>assay</b> and offers the additional advantages of increased sensitivity and shorter assay time. The increased sensitivity should be particularly useful in monitoring the efficacy of antiviral therapies and detecting the emergence of drug-resistant HBV mutants. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|Selection of HBsAg-positive {{patients}} for antiviral therapy requires an estimation of disease activity and viral replication. Serum transaminases and histological analysis {{are commonly used}} to assess disease activity, and viral replication is assessed by serological testing of HBeAg and serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA. Dot blot hybridisation may be insufficiently sensitive to corroborate low-grade replication in patients with active hepatitis, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) may be testing too sensitive for this role. Theoretically an assay of intermediate sensitivity is therefore required. Our aim was to evaluate whether the branched chain DNA (<b>bDNA)</b> <b>assay</b> would fulfil this function. Seventy-one HBsAg-positive patients were tested for HBV DNA by the bDNA assay; 64 were also tested by dot blot hybridisation and, when appropriate, also by PCR. Thirty-seven (52 %) patients were positive for HBV DNA by the <b>bDNA</b> <b>assay.</b> HBV DNA was detected in the majority (21 / 28; 75 %) of HBeAg-positive patients but also in 14 of 36 (39 %) anti-HBe-positive patients.

Good correlation between the HCV RNA levels as detected by the two assays was observed, with a correlation co-efficient of 0. 83 (P < 0. 0001) and 0. 90 (P < 0. 0001) at week 0 and 24, respectively. Hepatitis C virus RNA (HCV RNA) levels could be assessed with the <b>bDNA</b> <b>assay</b> in 14 / 17 (82 percent) HCV cDNA-PCR positive pretreatment samples. The <b>bDNA</b> <b>assay</b> apparently failed to detect low viral titres. Interferon treated patients (n = 11) showed either a complete response, being a large reduction in HCV RNA level to below the detection limit of the HCV cDNA-PCR assay (6 / 11) or no significant reduction in HCV RNA level (5 / 11). A "partial" virological response was not observed. The changes in HCV RNA plasma levels in non-responders during interferon (IFN) treatment were similar to the (small) natural fluctuations in viral load observed in controls (untreated patients). Although the <b>bDNA</b> <b>assay</b> was not as sensitive as cDNA-PCR, given its user friendliness and quantitative results, it is concluded {{that it is a}} useful test for monitoring HCV RNA levels in patients treated with interferon.

The specificity of the <b>bDNA</b> 3. 0 <b>assay</b> was 98. 2 %.

40|$|With an {{estimated}} 350 – 400 million people worldwide chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV), {{and the subsequent}} serious complications caused by liver damage including cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma, HBV infection remains a global health issue, particularly in Taiwan, an HBV-hyperendemic area. Sensitive and accurate quantification of HBV DNA is necessary to monitor patients with chronic hepatitis B who are receiving antiviral therapy to determine treatment response and adapt therapy. We evaluated and compared the clinical performance of two HBV DNA assays based on different technologies: the RealArt™ HBV™ PCR Kit (Abbott HBV DNA PCR kit, real-time polymerase chain reaction assay, detection limit: 27 IU/mL) and the VERSANT <b>bDNA</b> 3. 0 <b>assay</b> (Bayer, branched DNA signal amplification assay, detection limit: 357 IU/mL). Serum levels of HBV DNA in 173 chronic HBV carriers were determined using both the RealArt™ HBV™ PCR Kit and the VERSANT bDNA 3. 0 test. Of the 173 samples analyzed for baseline viral load detection, HBV DNA was quantifiable in 147 patients (82. 1 %) by the RealArt™ HBV™ PCR Kit, which {{was significantly higher than}} the 92 (53. 2 %) samples quantified by the VERSANT <b>bDNA</b> 3. 0 <b>assay.</b> A total of 86 (49. 7 %) samples were quantifiable by both assays, whereas 25 (14. 5 %) were below the detection limit of both assays. The HBV DNA quantification values measured by the RealArt™ HBV™ PCR Kit and the VERSANT <b>bDNA</b> 3. 0 <b>assay</b> were positively correlated (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient r = 0. 932, p < 0. 001). On average, the results derived from the RealArt™ HBV™ PCR Kit were 0. 67 log lower than those of the VERSANT <b>bDNA</b> 3. 0 <b>assay.</b> HBV DNA concentrations were significantly higher in 63 HBV e antigen (HBeAg) seropositive patients than in 110 HBeAg-seronegative patients (5. 42 ± 2. 34 logs vs. 3. 21 ± 2. 27 logs, p < 0. 001). The RealArt™ HBV™ PCR Kit is more sensitive and has a wider dynamic range than the VERSANT <b>bDNA</b> 3. 0 <b>assay</b> in the clinical setting of chronic hepatitis B patients.

40|$|We {{evaluated}} the branched-chain DNA (<b>bDNA)</b> <b>assay</b> QuantiGene Reagent System to measure RNA in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. The QuantiGene Reagent System {{does not require}} RNA isolation, avoids enzymatic preamplification, and has a simple workflow. Five selected genes were measured by bDNA assay; quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) {{was used as a}} reference method. Mixed-effect statistical models were used to partition the overall variance into components attributable to xenograft, sample, and assay. For FFPE tissues, the coefficients of reliability were significantly higher for the <b>bDNA</b> <b>assay</b> (93 – 100 %) than for qPCR (82. 4 – 95 %). Correlations between qPCRFROZEN, the gold standard, and bDNAFFPE ranged from 0. 60 to 0. 94, similar to those from qPCRFROZEN and qPCRFFPE. Additionally, the sensitivity of the <b>bDNA</b> <b>assay</b> in tissue homogenates was 10 -fold higher than in purified RNA. In 9 - to 13 -year-old blocks with poor RNA quality, the <b>bDNA</b> <b>assay</b> allowed the correct identification of the overexpression of known cancer genes. In conclusion, the QuantiGene Reagent System is considerably more reliable, reproducible, and sensitive than qPCR, providing an alternative method for the measurement of gene expression in FFPE tissues.

The first was an experimental study in which heparin- and EDTA-anticoagulated blood samples were collected from 101 HIV-positive individuals and processed to plasma after delays of 2, 6, and 18 h. HIV- 1 RNA levels in each sample were then measured by both branched-DNA (bDNA) and reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) assays. Compared to samples processed within 2 h, the loss (decay) of HIV- 1 RNA in heparinized blood was significant (P < 0. 05) but small after 6 h (<b>bDNA</b> <b>assay,</b> − 0. 12 log 10 copies/ml; RT-PCR, − 0. 05 log 10 copies/ml) and after 18 h (<b>bDNA</b> <b>assay,</b> − 0. 27 log 10 copies/ml; RT-PCR, − 0. 15 log 10 copies/ml). Decay in EDTA-anticoagulated blood was not significant after 6 h (<b>bDNA</b> <b>assay,</b> − 0. 002 log 10 copies/ml; RT-PCR, − 0. 02 log 10 copies/ml), but it was after 18 h (<b>bDNA</b> <b>assay,</b> − 0. 09 log 10 copies/ml; RT-PCR, − 0. 09 log 10 copies/ml). Only 4 % of samples processed after 6 h lost more than 50 % (≥ 0. 3 log 10 copies/ml) of the HIV- 1 RNA, regardless of the anticoagulant or the assay that was used. The second study compared HIV- 1 RNA levels in samples from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS; samples were collected in heparin-containing tubes in 1985, had a 6 -h average processing delay, and were assayed by <b>bDNA</b> <b>assay)</b> and the British Columbia Drug Treatment Program (BCDTP) (collected in EDTA- or acid citrate dextrose-containing tubes in 1996 and 1997, had a 2 -h maximum processing delay, and were assayed by RT-PCR).

A standard curve was obtained from an additional series of tubes containing both the internal standard and known amounts of a wild-type HCV RNA transcript, thus eliminating the need for titrating samples with the competitor. Eighty-eight anti-HCV-positive samples were tested by RT-PCR and a branched-DNA (<b>bDNA)</b> <b>assay</b> which has a detection limit of 3. 5 3 105 copies per ml.

50|$|Several {{different}} short single-stranded DNA molecules (oligonucleotides) {{are used}} in a branched DNA-assay. The capture and capture-extender oligonucleotide bind to the target nucleic acid and immobilize it on a solid support. The label oligonucleotide and the branched DNA then detects the immobilized target nucleic acid. The immobilization of the target on a solid support makes extensive washing easier, which reduces false positive results. After binding of the target to the solid support it can be detected by branched DNA which is coupled to an enzyme (e.g. alkaline phosphatase). The branched DNA binds to the sample nucleic acid by specific hybridization in areas which are not occupied by capture hybrids. The branching of the DNA allows for very dense decorating of the DNA with the enzyme, which {{is important for the}} high sensitivity of the assay. The enzyme catalyzes a reaction of a substrate which generates light (detectable in a luminometer). The amount of light emitted increases with the amount of the specific nucleic acid present in the sample. The design of the branched DNA and the way it is hybridized to the nucleic acid to be investigated differs between different generations of the bDNA assay.Despite the fact that the starting material is not preamplified, <b>bDNA</b> <b>assays</b> can detect less than 100 copies of HIV-RNA per mL of blood.|$|R

Sociodemographic (sex, skin color, age, income, years of schooling), lifestyle (smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical activity level), clinical (antiretroviral therapy, time of HIV infection, CD 4 lymphocyte count, viral load), and anthropometric (nutritional status and waist circumference) variables were investigated. Data on sociodemographic and lifestyle variables were collected through a pre-tested and standardized questionnaire. CD 4 count was determined by flow cytometry and viral load by branched DNA (<b>bDNA)</b> <b>assays</b> for HIV- 1. All variables were analyzed at a p< 0. 05 significance level.

Armored RNA is a good candidate for an RNase-resistant positive control or standard. However, its use has been limited by the maximal length of the exogenous RNA packaged into virus-like particles by routine armored RNA technology. In the present study, we produced armored long RNA (armored L-RNA) controls or standards (AR-HIV-pol- 3034 b) for a <b>bDNA</b> <b>assay</b> of HIV- 1 by increasing the amount and affinity of the pac sites (the pac site is a specific 19 -nucleotide stem-loop region located at the 5 ′ terminus of the MS 2 bacteriophage replicase gene) by a one-plasmid double-expression system. AR-HIV-pol- 3034 b was completely resistant to DNase and RNase, was stable in normal human EDTA-preserved plasma at 4 °C for at least 6 months, and produced reproducible, linear results in the Versant HIV- 1 RNA 3. 0 assay. In conclusion, AR-HIV-pol- 3034 b could act as a positive control or standard in a <b>bDNA</b> <b>assay</b> for the detection of HIV- 1.

40|$|Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is {{currently}} considered {{the method of}} choice for steroid hormone receptor status evaluation in human breast cancer and, therefore, it is commonly utilized for assessing canine mammary tumors. In case of low hormone receptor expression, IHC is limited and thus is complemented by molecular analyses. In the present study, a multiplex <b>bDNA</b> <b>assay</b> was evaluated as a method for hormone receptor gene expression detection in canine mammary tissues. Estrogen receptor (ESR 1), progesterone receptor (PGR), prolactin receptor (PRLR) and growth hormone receptor (GHR) gene expressions were evaluated in neoplastic and non-neoplastic canine mammary tissues. A set of 119 fresh frozen and 180 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) was comparatively analyzed and used for assay evaluation. Furthermore, a possible association between the hormone receptor expression in different histological subtypes of canine malignant mammary tumors and the castration status, breed and invasive growth of the tumor were analyzed. The multiplex <b>bDNA</b> <b>assay</b> {{proved to be more}} sensitive for fresh frozen specimens. Hormone receptor expression found was significantly decreased in malignant mammary tumors in comparison to non-neoplastic tissue and benign mammary tumors. Among the histological subtypes the lowest gene expression levels of ESR 1, PGR and PRLR were found in solid, anaplastic and ductal carcinomas. In summary, the evaluation showed that the measurement of hormone receptors with the multiplex <b>bDNA</b> <b>assay</b> represents a practicable method for obtaining detailed quantitative information about gene expression in canine mammary tissue for future studies. Still, comparison with IHC or quantitative real-time PCR is needed for further validation of the present method...|$|E
40|$|A {{nucleic acid}} photo-cross-linking {{technology}} {{was used to}} develop a direct assay for the quantification of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels in serum. Cross-linker-modified DNA probes complementary to the viral genomes of the major HBV subtypes were synthesized and used in an assay that could be completed in less than 6 h. The quantification range of the assay, as determined by testing serial dilutions of Eurohep HBV reference standards and cloned HBV DNA, was 5 × 105 to 3 × 109 molecules of HBV DNA/ml of serum. Within-run and between-run coefficients of variation (CVs) for the assay were 4. 3 and 4. 0 %, respectively. The assay {{was used to determine}} HBV DNA levels in 302 serum samples, and the results were compared to those obtained after testing the same samples with the Chiron branched-DNA (<b>bDNA)</b> <b>assay</b> for HBV DNA. Of the samples tested, 218 were positive for HBV DNA by both assays and 72 gave results below the cutoff for both assays. Of the remaining 12 samples, 10 were positive for HBV DNA by the cross-linking assay only; the 2 other samples were positive by the <b>bDNA</b> <b>assay</b> only. Twenty-eight samples had to be retested by the <b>bDNA</b> <b>assay</b> (CV, > 20 % between the results obtained from the testing of each sample in duplicate), whereas only three samples required retesting by the cross-linking assay. The correlation between the HBV DNA levels, as measured by the two tests, was very high (r = 0. 902; P = 0. 01). We conclude that the cross-linking assay is a sensitive and reproducible method for the detection and quantification of HBV DNA levels in serum...|$|E
40|$|This study {{determined}} the proficiencies of laboratories measuring {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) viral loads and the accuracies of two assays used for HIV- 1 viral load measurement in Australia and investigated the variability of the new versions of these assays. Quality assessment program panels containing (i) dilutions of HIV- 1 subtype B, (ii) replicates of identical samples of HIV- 1 subtype B, and (iii) samples of subtype E and B were tested by laboratories. Total variability (within and between laboratories) was tested with quality control samples. The coefficients of variation (CVs) for the Roche AMPLICOR HIV- 1 MONITOR version (v) 1. 0 and Chiron Quantiplex <b>bDNA</b> 2. 0 <b>assays</b> ranged from 53 to 87 % and 22 to 31 %, respectively. The widespread occurrence of invalid runs with the AMPLICOR HIV- 1 MONITOR 1. 0 assay was identified. The CVs of the new versions of the assays were 82 to 86 % for the AMPLICOR HIV- 1 MONITOR v 1. 5 assay and 16 to 23 % for the Quantiplex <b>bDNA</b> 3. 0 <b>assay.</b> For virus dilution samples, all but 5 of 19 laboratories obtained results within 2 standard deviations of the mean. The Quantiplex <b>bDNA</b> 2. 0 <b>assay</b> reported values lower than those reported by the AMPLICOR HIV- 1 MONITOR version 1. 0 assay for samples containing HIV- 1 subtype B, whereas the reverse was true for subtype E. Identification and resolution {{of the problem of}} invalid runs markedly improved the quality of HIV- 1 viral load testing. The variability observed between laboratories and between assays, even the most recent versions, dictates that monitoring of viral load in an individual should always be by the same laboratory and by the same assay.

40|$|Abstract: The {{molecular}} {{determination of}} viral load in the serum represents {{the most valuable}} prognostic marker of HBV infection. In this paper, a new molecular assay for the quantitative measurement of HBV presence is described. It is based on PCR performing with a HBV-specific competitor DNA template. For {{the construction of the}} DNA template, a HBV DNA-originated 436 bp DNA fragment was modified by introducing a 110 bp deletion and cloned into pUC 19. The resulting vector serves as the competitor DNA template in the competitive PCR. Post-PCR, the competitor DNA generates an amplified fragment of 306 bp; it could be easily distinguished from the product generated from the viraloriginated DNA product (416 bp) when the same primers are used. The quantitative ratio between the two products enables the quantitative determination of viral load. The range of the HB-PCR assay is from 3 x 10 4 to 6 x 10 10 particles/ml. A serum HBV load determination performed by HB-PCR assay indicated a close correlation with the results of the Quantiplex HBV DNA <b>assay</b> (<b>bDNA).</b> The HB-PCR <b>assay</b> is cheap, reliable and easy to use in any laboratory working with PCR methods...|$|R
40|$|The QUANTIPLEX HIV- 1 RNA assay, version 3. 0 (a {{branched}} DNA, version 3. 0, assay [bDNA 3. 0 assay]), {{was evaluated}} by analyzing spiked and clinical plasma samples and was {{compared with the}} AMPLICOR HIV- 1 MONITOR Ultrasensitive (ultrasensitive reverse transcription-PCR [US-RT-PCR]) method. A panel of spiked plasma samples that contained 0 to 750, 000 copies of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) RNA per ml was tested four times in each of four laboratories (1, 344 assays). Negative results (< 50 copies/ml) were obtained in 30 of 32 (94 %) assays with seronegative samples, 66 of 128 (52 %) assays with HIV- 1 RNA at 50 copies/ml, and 5 of 128 (4 %) assays with HIV- 1 RNA at 100 copies/ml. The assay was linear from 100 to 500, 000 copies/ml. The within-run standard deviation (SD) of the log 10 estimated HIV- 1 RNA concentration was 0. 08 at 1, 000 to 500, 000 copies/ml, increased below 1, 000 copies/ml, and was 0. 17 at 100 copies/ml. Between-run reproducibility at 100 to 500 copies/ml was < 0. 10 log 10 in most comparisons. Interlaboratory differences across runs were ≤ 0. 10 log 10 at all concentrations examined. A subset of the panel (25 to 500 copies/ml) was also analyzed by the US-RT-PCR assay. The within-run SD varied inversely with the log 10 HIV- 1 RNA concentration but was higher than the SD for the <b>bDNA</b> 3. 0 <b>assay</b> at all concentrations. Log-log regression analysis indicated that the two methods produced very similar estimates at 100 to 500 copies/ml. In parallel testing of clinical specimens with low HIV- 1 RNA levels, 80 plasma samples with < 50 copies/ml by the US-RT-PCR assay had < 50 copies/ml when they were retested by the <b>bDNA</b> 3. 0 <b>assay.</b> In contrast, 11 of 78 (14 %) plasma samples with < 50 copies/ml by the <b>bDNA</b> 3. 0 <b>assay</b> had ≥ 50 copies/ml when they were retested by the US-RT-PCR assay (median, 86 copies/ml; range, 50 to 217 copies/ml). Estimation of bDNA 3. 0 values of < 50 copies/ml by extending the standard curve of the assay showed that these samples with discrepant results had higher HIV- 1 RNA levels than the samples with concordant results (median, 34 versus 17 copies/ml; P = 0. 0051 by the Wilcoxon two-sample test). The excellent reproducibility, broad linear range, and good sensitivity of the <b>bDNA</b> 3. 0 <b>assay</b> make it a very attractive method for quantitation of HIV- 1 RNA levels in plasma...|$|R
40|$|A simple, sensitive, and {{specific}} ligation-dependent PCR (LD-PCR) method {{for the detection}} of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA in serum is described. The assay uses two DNA capture probes for RNA isolation and two DNA hemiprobes for subsequent PCR. Each capture probe has a 3 ' sequence complementary to the conserved 5 ' untranslated region of HCV RNA and a biotin moiety at the 5 ' end capable of interacting with streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads. Each hemiprobe contains a sequence complementary to the 5 ' untranslated region in juxtaposition to one another and a common sequence for PCR primer binding. In guanidinium thiocyanate solutions, the capture probes and the hemiprobes form a hybrid with their target, and the hybrid can be isolated from serum by the binding of the capture probes to the paramagnetic beads {{in the presence of a}} magnetic field. The hemiprobes can then be linked to each other by incubation with T 4 DNA ligase to form a full probe that serves as a template for a PCR. When serial 10 -fold dilutions of synthetic HCV RNA (10 (7) to 10 molecules) were tested, there was a good correlation between the amount of PCR product and the initial number of RNA molecules, with a sensitivity of 100 HCV RNA molecules per reaction. Twenty-four specimens that had been tested by either a branched DNA probe (<b>bDNA)</b> <b>assay</b> (13 specimens) or a reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) assay (11 specimens) were also analyzed by LD-PCR. The results showed a good correlation among LD-PCR, RT-PCR, and the <b>bDNA</b> <b>assay.</b> However, both LD-PCR and RT-PCR were more sensitive than the <b>bDNA</b> <b>assay</b> when the HCV titer was low...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{our study}} was to compare the {{performances}} of two new hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA assays, a cross-linking assay (NAXCOR) and a hybrid-capture amplification assay (Digene), versus the widely used branched-DNA (<b>bDNA)</b> <b>assay</b> (Chiron) in the monitoring of HBV DNA levels during antiviral treatment. Serial serum samples from 12 chronically HBV infected patients undergoing a phase II trial of an antiviral drug, 2 ′, 3 ′-dideoxy- 5 -fluoro- 3 ′-thiacytidine (FTC), were studied. A total of 96 serum samples were tested for HBV DNA using the cross-linking, hybrid-capture amplification, and bDNA assays. In the comparison of the cross-linking and bDNA assays, concordant results were found in 77 (80. 3 %) samples, no {{significant difference was found}} between the median log 10 HBV DNA levels (6. 66 versus 7. 17 meq/ml), and the results of the two assays were closely correlated (r = 0. 95). In the comparison of the hybrid-capture amplification and bDNA assays, concordant results were found in 79 (82. 3 %) samples, no significant difference was found between the median log 10 HBV DNA levels (6. 98 versus 6. 99 meq/ml), and the results of the two assays were closely correlated (r = 0. 99). Six (6. 3 %) samples by the cross-linking assay and 10 (10. 4 %) samples by the <b>bDNA</b> <b>assay</b> required retesting because of unacceptably high within-run coefficients of variance. No sample required retesting in the hybrid-capture amplification assay according to the internal validation. In conclusion, the cross-linking and hybrid-capture amplification assays were as sensitive as the <b>bDNA</b> <b>assay</b> for HBV DNA detection and can be recommended for monitoring of HBV DNA levels during antiviral treatment...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background HIV- 1 is {{characterized}} by increased genetic heterogeneity which tends to hinder the reliability of detection and accuracy of HIV- 1 RNA quantitation assays. Methods In this study, the Abbott RealTime HIV- 1 (Abbott RealTime) assay was compared to the Roche Cobas TaqMan HIV- 1 (Cobas TaqMan) and the Siemens Versant HIV- 1 RNA 3. 0 (<b>bDNA</b> 3. 0) <b>assays,</b> using clinical samples of various viral load levels and subtypes from Greece, where the recent epidemiology of HIV- 1 infection has been characterized by increasing genetic diversity and a marked increase in subtype A genetic strains among newly diagnosed infections. Results A high correlation was observed between the quantitative results obtained by the Abbott RealTime and the Cobas TaqMan assays. Viral load values quantified by the Abbott RealTime were on average lower than those obtained by the Cobas TaqMan, with a mean (SD) difference of - 0. 206 (0. 298) log 10 copies/ml. The mean differences according to HIV- 1 subtypes between the two techniques for samples of subtype A, B, and non-A/non-B were 0. 089, - 0. 262, and - 0. 298 log 10 copies/ml, respectively. Overall, differences were less than 0. 5 log 10 for 85 % of the samples, and > 1 log 10 in only one subtype B sample. Similarly, Abbott RealTime and <b>bDNA</b> 3. 0 <b>assays</b> yielded a very good correlation of quantitative results, whereas viral load values assessed by the Abbott RealTime were on average higher (mean (SD) difference: 0. 160 (0. 287) log 10 copies/ml). The mean differences according to HIV- 1 subtypes between the two techniques for subtype A, B and non-A/non-B samples were 0. 438, 0. 105 and 0. 191 log 10 copies/ml, respectively. Overall, the majority of samples (86 %) differed by less than 0. 5 log 10, while none of the samples showed a deviation of more than 1. 0 log 10. Conclusions In an area of changing HIV- 1 subtype pattern, the Abbott RealTime assay showed a high correlation and good agreement of results when compared both to the Cobas TaqMan and <b>bDNA</b> 3. 0 <b>assays,</b> for all HIV- 1 subtypes tested. All three assays could determine viral load from samples of different HIV- 1 subtypes adequately.

Methods: Patients were stratified into four groups based on HIV- 1 viral load and matched according to age, gender and those receiving antiretroviral treatment. IL- 27 levels and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured using electrochemilu-minescence assays. D-dimer and CD 4 + T cell counts were measured using an Enzyme Linked Fluorescence Assay and FACS, respectively. sCD 14 and sCD 163 were measured using ELISA.

This assay allows for the direct direction of specific PCR products within minutes of completion of the PCR by monitoring the increase in fluorescence of a dye-labeled oligonucleotide probe. We evaluated this assay by comparing the results obtained by nested PCR with those obtained by TaqMan PCR. Test samples included two separate dilutions series of plasma samples from experimentally infected chimpanzees and a panel of 48 serum specimens from patients with community-acquired hepatitis C virus. The quantity of HCV RNA in each chimpanzee plasma sample was determined by using branched DNA (<b>bDNA)</b> signal amplification <b>assay</b> (Quantiplex HCV RNA assay; Chiron Corp., Emeryville, Calif.). Both PCR assays demonstrated similar levels of detection and could reliably detect 13 bDNA genome equivalents per sample. We found an overall concordance of 88 % between results of two PCR assays with the community-acquired panel, which resolved to 100 % when discrepant samples were retested by nested PCR.

Test samples included a proficiency testing panel consisting of 10 undiluted plasma samples, three separate dilution series, and sera from 99 patients with chronic liver disease. The quantity of HCV RNA in each patient serum sample was determined by a branched DNA (bDNA) signal amplification assay (Quantiplex HCV-RNA assay; Chiron, Emeryville, Calif.). There was complete concordance between the results of the RT-PCR assays with the 10 undiluted plasma samples used for proficiency testing (3 positive and 7 negative samples). However, the analytical sensitivity of SRT-PCR was 4 - to 10 -fold greater than that of the AMPLICOR test in the dilution series. HCV RNA was detected in 44, 45, and 40 of the patient serum samples, by SRT-PCR, the AMPLICOR test, and the <b>bDNA</b> <b>assay,</b> respectively.

From 1993 to 2005, 110 men collected 327 semen specimens. Initial blood and seminal plasma RNA levels in untreated men were only moderately correlated (Spearman r[*]=[*] 0. 38, p[*]=[*] 0. 0002). Estimated peak and set point levels were lower in semen than blood by 0. 8 (p[*]=[*] 0. 001) and 0. 7 (p[*]<[*] 0. 001) log 10 copies/ml, respectively.

40|$|Hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA {{measurement}} before, {{during and}} after antiviral therapy has become an essential tool {{in the management of}} interferon-based treatment of HCV-related infections. Conventional Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) has been largely used to obtain quantitative data, but laborious, time-consuming post-PCR handling steps are required to gain valuable results. Real time (RT) PCR now provides advantages over end-point (EP) PCR due to its improved rapidity, sensitivity, reproducibility and the reduced risk of carry-over contamination, and has now proven itself to be valuable for the more precise monitoring of viral load kinetics and assessing antiviral response. The Abbott Real-Time HCV-RNA is a recently introduced assay for the automated processing of clinical samples and HCV-RNA quantitation: its basic technology relies on use of fluorescent linear probes (dynamic range using 0. 5 ml as input target= 12 - 108 IU/mL) and a hybridization/detection step at low temperature (35 °C), which allows target mismatches to be tolerated.
