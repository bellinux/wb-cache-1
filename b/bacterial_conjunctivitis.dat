Susceptibility testing was performed using Kirby–Bauer disk diffusion method and the minimum inhibitory concentration was also determined. It revealed multiple drug resistance associated with β-lactamase production. Only gentamicin, rifampicin, and azithromycin were active against the test pathogens. A dual therapy was initiated using gentamicin as well as azithromycin to treat the possible co-infection with Chlamydia trachomatis.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{assess and}} compare the in vitro {{susceptibility}} of ocular bacterial isolates to fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin. METHODS: A total of 154 bacterial ocular isolates from keratitis and conjunctivitis were tested for sensitivity to the studied antibiotics, using the disk diffusion method. RESULTS: Of the 51 corneal isolates, 46 (90. 2 %) were sensitive to ciprofloxacin, 45 (88. 2 %) to ofloxacin and 41 (80. 4 %) to lomefloxacin. All corneal isolates were sensitive to moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin. Of the 103 bacterial conjunctival isolates, 101 (98. 1 %) and 103 (100 %) were sensitive to gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin, respectively.

Design: Interpretive assessment. Methods: Literature review and interpretation. Results: Ocular <b>bacterial</b> infections include <b>conjunctivitis,</b> keratitis, endophthalmitis, blepharitis, orbital cellulitis, and dacryocystitis. Treatment for most ocular bacterial infections is primarily empiric with broad-spectrum antibiotics, which are effective against the most common bacteria associated with these ocular infections. However, the widespread use of broad-spectrum systemic antibiotics has resulted in a global increase in resistance among both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria to a number of the older antibiotics {{as well as some of}} the newer fluoroquinolones used to treat ophthalmic infections. Strategies for the prevention of the increase in ocular pathogen resistance should be developed and implemented.

40|$|Prikazujemo slučaj okularne infekcije uzrokovane telazijom u 82 -godišnjeg bolesnika. Infekcija pripada skupini zoonoza, a uzrokovana je parazitom (nematodom) iz porodice Thelaziide. Opisane su dvije vrste telazija koje uzrokuju infekciju u ljudi: Thelazia callipaeda i Thelazija californiensis. Prenosi se sa životinja, najčešće psa, na čovjeka putem muha iz porodice Drosophilidae. Bolesnik se javlja u hitnu oftalmološku ambulantu zbog bolova i svrbeža u lijevom oku koji traju već nekoliko dana. Prigodom prvog pregleda ustanovljeno je jako crvenilo konjunktive i cilijarnog područja, te veliki kornealni apsces pozitivan na fl uorescenski test bez vidljivih struktura u pozadini. Pregledom vanjskog konjunktivalnog kuta, pod vjeđom, uoči se pokretna, crvolika forma. Tijekom pregleda, uz lokalnu anesteziju tetrakainom, ukupno je odstranjeno sedam sitnih, mliječno bijelih crva različitih veličina i faze razvoja. Nakon kirurške ekstirpacije parazita, učini se mikrobiološka identifi kacija i utvrdi dijagnoza telazioze. The fi rst case of ocular thelaziasis {{in a human}} male {{patient in}} Croatia is presented. Thelaziasis is a {{zoonosis}} caused by nematodes of the genus Thelazia, parasites of the conjunctival bags or tear ducts of mammals and birds. Two types of the genus Thelazia (T.) {{have been described as}} causes of infection in humans, T. callipaeda and T. californiensis. To date, less than 300 thelaziasis cases in humans have been reported. This zoonosis is very rare in humans in European countries, with a high incidence in Asian countries, especially in China, Thailand and Japan. Because of the high prevalence of the parasites in the Far East, T. callipaeda is called ‘Oriental eye worm’. The fi rst case of thelaziasis in Europe was described in 2008 in Italy and France, where cases in animals had already been reported. Seasonal occurrence of thelaziasis in Europe depends on the presence of the vector, fruit fl ies of Drosophilidae family, Phortica variegate as the most common type. Adult worm is milky white, females grow to 20 mm and males up to 12 mm. Dogs and cats are the most common sources of infection for humans, which occurs as unilateral ocular infection. The clinical picture of infection is similar to <b>bacterial</b> and allergic <b>conjunctivitis</b> with tearing and foreign body sensation. After removal of worms, clinical signs quickly disappear and {{there is no need for}} anthelmintic treatment. In the treatment of secondary infections, local antibiotics and corticosteroids can be applied. The 82 -year-old male patient presented to outpatient ophthalmology clinic for occasional sensation of pain, itching, redness and tearing in his left eye during the last few days. His left eye was blind due to previous retinal detachment and had severe conjunctival and ciliary infection with large corneal abscess. Worm-like movement in the lateral canthus was observed. After topical anesthesia, seven worms were removed. Upon surgical extirpation of the parasite, the diagnosis of thelaziasis was verifi ed by microbiological identifi cation. Only two cases of Thelazia in dogs were reported in Croatia, in December 2013 and January 2014. It is important to bear in mind this cause of eye infections, especially when caused by larval stages that are diffi cult to identify. Untimely diagnosis and inadequate treatment lead to extended illness and complications. The appearance of this parasite in Croatian patients suggests the need for inclusion of the pathogen in the differential diagnosis of <b>bacterial</b> or allergic <b>conjunctivitis...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: Global {{estimates}} suggest {{there are}} almost 19 million visually impaired children worldwide, the major cause being uncorrected refractive error (RE). Aim: To assess the prevalence of visual impairment (VI) and RE among Sudanese school-aged children. Setting: Eight randomly selected primary schools from 21 districts in South Darfur State of Sudan were involved. Methods: A school-based cross-sectional study of RE and VI in primary schoolchildren from grades 1 to 8 (children aged 6 – 15 years) was investigated. A Refractive Error Study in Children (RESC) protocol was implemented to determine the prevalence of RE and VI in these schoolaged children. Participants were enrolled through stratified multistage cluster sampling of four all-male and four all-female primary schools from South Darfur State of Sudan. Examination procedures followed the RESC protocol, which included visual acuity (VA) measurements, binocular vision assessments, retinoscopy and autorefraction under cycloplegia, as well as examination of the external eye, anterior-segment, media and fundus. Results: A total of 1775 children {{were invited to participate}} in the study and 1678 were examined resulting in a participation rate of 94. 5 %. The findings indicated that the prevalence of uncorrected, presenting and best-corrected VA of 6 / 12 or worse was 6. 4 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 4. 9 – 7. 9), 4. 4 % (95 % CI, 2. 9 – 5. 9) and 1. 2 % (95 % CI, 0. 3 – 2. 7) respectively. RE was the cause of VI in 57 % of participants, retinal disorders in 13. 1 %, amblyopia in 5. 6 %, corneal opacity in 0. 9 %, cataract in 3. 7 %, with the causes of reduced vision undetermined in 10. 3 % and various other causes contributed 9. 3 %. External and anterior-segment abnormalities were observed in 10. 2 % of children. This was mainly allergic conjunctivitis (5. 3 %) followed by <b>bacterial</b> and viral <b>conjunctivitis</b> (4. 2 %). The prevalence of myopia (≥|- 0. 50 D|) in one or both eyes was 6. 8 % (95 % CI, 5. 3 – 8. 3), hypermetropia (≥ 2 D) was noted in 1. 9 % (95 % CI, 0. 4 – 3. 4) and astigmatism (≥|- 0. 75 D|) prevailed in 2. 5 % (95 % CI, 1. 0 – 4. 0). Prevalence of VI among schoolaged children were associated with the children’s age and grade levels (p = 0. 00) but was not correlated with gender (p = 0. 224). Prevalence of RE among school-aged children was significantly correlated with age and grade levels (p = 0. 00). No significant correlation was found between gender and prevalence of RE (p = 0. 833). The prevalence of VI because of myopia was associated with increasing grade levels and also the childhood age (p = 0. 023), but there was no significant difference in the prevalence of VI because of myopia between male and female children. Conclusion: Uncorrected RE was a major cause of VI among children in the South Darfur State. There is thus a critical need for developing a comprehensive child eye care plan focusing on the reduction of uncorrected RE through collaboration between key stakeholders and government. </p...|$|R
