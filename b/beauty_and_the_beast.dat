5|$|Director Bill Condon {{originally}} intended to include most songs from the Broadway musical adaptation of <b>Beauty</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Beast</b> in the remake. However, Disney ultimately decided to recruit composer Alan Menken and lyricist Tim Rice to write entirely new songs for the film instead. Original <b>Beauty</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Beast</b> composer Menken reunited with Rice, {{with whom he had}} previously collaborated on Disney's animated film Aladdin (1992), to write three new songs for the remake. Rice once again replaced original <b>Beauty</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Beast</b> lyricist Howard Ashman, who had passed away shortly before the animated film's release in 1991, similar {{to the way in which}} he replaced the lyricist to aid Menken in writing new material for the 1994 stage adaptation. Menken believes that the songs he and Rice had written for the stage musical would not have translated well to the screen due to structural differences between the two formats.|$|E
5|$|Decades later, {{during the}} {{production}} of Who Framed Roger Rabbit in 1987, the Disney studio resurrected <b>Beauty</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Beast</b> as a project for the satellite animation studio it had set up in London, England to work on Roger Rabbit. Richard Williams, who had directed the animated portions of Roger Rabbit, was approached to direct but declined in favor of continuing work on his long-gestating project The Thief and the Cobbler. In his place, Williams recommended his colleague, English animation director Richard Purdum, and work began under producer Don Hahn on a non-musical version of <b>Beauty</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Beast</b> set in 19th century France. At the behest of Disney CEO Michael Eisner, <b>Beauty</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Beast</b> became the first Disney animated film to use a screenwriter. This was an unusual production move for an animated film, which is traditionally developed on storyboards rather than in scripted form. Linda Woolverton wrote the original draft of the story before storyboarding began, and worked with the story team to retool and develop the film.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, IGN named <b>Beauty</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Beast</b> as the {{greatest}} animated film of all time, directly ahead of WALL-E, The Incredibles, Toy Story 2, and The Iron Giant.|$|E

5|$|<b>Beauty</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Beast</b> is a 1991 American {{animated}} musical romantic fantasy film {{produced by}} Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures. The 30th Disney animated feature film {{and the third}} released during the Disney Renaissance period, {{it is based on}} the French fairy tale of the same name by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont (who was also credited in the English version as well as in the French version), and ideas from the 1946 French film of the same name directed by Jean Cocteau. <b>Beauty</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Beast</b> focuses on the relationship between the Beast (voice of Robby Benson), a prince who is magically transformed into a monster and his servants into household objects as punishment for his arrogance, and Belle (voice of Paige O'Hara), a young woman whom he imprisons in his castle. To become a prince again, Beast must learn to love Belle and earn her love in return to avoid remaining a monster forever. The film also features the voices of Richard White, Jerry Orbach, David Ogden Stiers, and Angela Lansbury.|$|E

50|$|After he left Samson {{for artistic}} divergences, Thunderstick {{then went on}} to form his own eponymous band called Thunderstick {{consisting}} of two guitarists, bass and female vocalist. They recorded two hard rock albums, the EP Feel like Rock 'n' Roll? (1983) and a full feature LP <b>Beauty</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Beasts</b> (1984) via Magnum/Thunderbolt Records. These have been restored and remastered for a 2011 CD release, an anthology called Echoes from the Analogue Asylum which also features previously-unreleased material.|$|R
500|$|The [...] "Something There" [...] musical {{sequence}} {{was added}} towards <b>the</b> end of <b>Beauty</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Beasts</b> filmmaking process. Belle was animated by Mark Henn, while <b>the</b> <b>Beast</b> was animated by Aaron Blaise. Henn described [...] "Something There" [...] as [...] "a great sequence," [...] continuing, [...] "I love to animate songs." [...] Los Angeles Times Charles Solomon felt that Belle was drawn inconsistently throughout the film, observing {{that the character}} appears [...] "noticeably slimmer" [...] during [...] "Something There".|$|R
5000|$|In Disney's fantasy film Enchanted (2007), the Jon McLaughlin ballad [...] "So Close" [...] {{serves as}} a [...] "deliberate" [...] {{reference}} to both <b>the</b> song <b>and</b> scene. Because director Kevin Lima {{had always wanted to}} recreate the cinematography exhibited in <b>Beauty</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Beast's</b> ballroom sequence in live-action, an entire dance sequence was filmed to accommodate his vision. In addition to being composed by Alan Menken, one-half of [...] "Beauty <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Beast"'s songwriters, [...] "So Close" [...] was arranged by Robbie Buchanan, who arranged the Dion-Bryson single.|$|R
5|$|A {{sing along}} {{edition of the}} film, hosted by Jordin Sparks, was {{released}} in select theaters on September 29 and October 2, 2010. Prior to the showing of the film, Sparks showed an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the newly restored film {{and the making of}} her new <b>Beauty</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Beast</b> music video. There was also commentary from producer Don Hahn, interviews with the cast and an inside look at how the animation was created.|$|E
5|$|Belle is {{a fictional}} {{character}} who appears in Walt Disney Pictures' 30th animated feature film <b>Beauty</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Beast</b> (1991). Originally voiced by American actress and singer Paige O'Hara, Belle is the non-conforming {{daughter of an}} inventor. Belle yearns to abandon her predictable village life in return for adventure. When her father Maurice is imprisoned by a cold-hearted beast, Belle offers him her own freedom in exchange for her father's, and eventually learns to love the Beast despite his unsightly outward appearance.|$|E
5|$|Production {{designer}} Anthony D. G. Pratt {{was influenced}} by French architect Charles Garnier, designer of the original Paris opera house, as well as Edgar Degas, John Singer Sargent, Gustave Caillebotte, the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Schumacher was inspired by Jean Cocteau's <b>Beauty</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Beast</b> (1946), where a hallway is lined with arms holding candelabra. The cemetery {{was based on the}} Père Lachaise and Montparnasse. Costume designer Alexandra Byrne utilised a limited black, white, gold and silver colour palette for the Masquerade ball.|$|E
50|$|Pitch Perfect 2 grossed $184.2 {{million in}} North America and $103.2 million in other territories for a {{worldwide}} total of $287.5 million, against {{a budget of}} $29 million. In its first five days, the film surpassed the total gross of the original ($115.4 million), and also overtook School of Rock ($131.3 million) for the highest grossing musical-comedy of all-time <b>and</b> <b>the</b> second greatest musical debut ever (behind <b>Beauty</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Beasts</b> $174.8 million in 2017). Deadline.com calculated the net profit of the film to be $139.6 million, when factoring together all expenses <b>and</b> revenues for <b>the</b> film.|$|R
500|$|Since [...] "A Change in Me" [...] was {{introduced}} four years into <b>Beauty</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Beasts</b> run, <b>the</b> song {{has not yet}} been included on any official English-language cast albums. However, it has been recorded for the 2005 Manila, 2008 Madrid and 2009 Barcelona original cast recordings of the musical by various actresses in their native languages. It has since been covered by several artists. Actress Susan Egan, who originated the role of Belle when the show premiered in 1994, had already long left the production by the time [...] "A Change in Me" [...] {{was introduced}}. She covered the song for her debut studio album So Far in 2002. Arranged and produced by Craig Barna, Egan's version of [...] "A Change in Me" [...] was the first English-language studio recording of the song.|$|R
50|$|In 2005, Yu {{came out}} of {{retirement}} to appear in Derek Yees film 2 Young.

5|$|The Queen's castle {{was used}} {{prominently}} in the advertising of the film (acting as {{the backdrop of the}} film's poster). Later Disney fairy tales, including Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, The Little Mermaid, <b>Beauty</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Beast</b> and Aladdin, feature similarly fantastical castles and palaces, and often these buildings act as centrepieces or backdrops for the movies' posters. A fairy tale castle stands at the centre of each Disney theme park, and the image of the castle is used in the logo for Buena Vista International.|$|E
5|$|These {{ideas were}} {{somewhat}} similar to {{elements of the}} 1946 French film version of <b>Beauty</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Beast,</b> which introduced the character of Avenant, an oafish suitor somewhat similar to Gaston, as well as inanimate objects coming {{to life in the}} Beast's castle. The animated objects were, however, given distinct personalities in the Disney version. By early 1990, Katzenberg had approved the revised script, and storyboarding began again. The production flew story artists back and forth between California and New York for storyboard approvals from Ashman, though the team was not told the reason why.|$|E
5|$|Trevor Munson {{conceived}} {{the character of}} Mick Angel in 2004 and spent {{two and a half}} years writing a novel featuring the character. The story was adapted into a feature film script, and Bruce Willis was considered as a possibility for the lead role. The script was shown to Nina Tassler at CBS, who paired Munson with Ron Koslow, creator of <b>Beauty</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Beast,</b> to rewrite the script as a television series.|$|E
50|$|Nathan Mack {{was born}} on April 15, 2007 in England. He attends Stagecoach Performing Arts School for {{children}} {{where he has been}} a student since he was seven. For the role of Chip his teachers put him forward for the audition. Nathan states that although it was nerve-wracking, it was an enjoyable experience. He also says that they try to make you feel comfortable before the audition, he exclaims that when they were having a conversation they made him laugh. He ended up doing two auditions and when his mother told him that he won he didnt believe her because he was so overwhelmed. He was selected to become Chip Potts by <b>Beauty</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Beasts</b> Casting Director, Lucy Bevan. He stated that working and meeting with all the actors was what he loved most about the film.|$|R
2500|$|Stanley Meyer {{designed}} the production's set. Following Disney's instructions to [...] "to make the animated film come to life", Meyer's set {{was very much}} a literal interpretation of the film. Meyer found it [...] "tricky" [...] to translate two-dimensional environments into a three-dimensional world. The West Wing's appearance mirrors that of its resident <b>the</b> <b>Beast,</b> being hideous on the outside but beautiful when the audience is finally taken inside of it. In stark contrast to popular musicals The Phantom of <b>the</b> Opera <b>and</b> Into <b>the</b> Woods, <b>Beauty</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Beasts</b> set resembles a hybrid of Gothic Victorian and Louis Quinze. Disney hired costume designer Ann Hould-Ward to design the musical's costumes because the studio enjoyed a [...] "certain aesthetic" [...] she had used in her previous work, and thus allowed her much creative freedom. Roth was particularly impressed with the designer's contributions to the musicals Sunday in the Park With George <b>and</b> Into <b>the</b> Woods. Hould-Ward accepted Disney's offer because she was interested in seeing exactly how a corporate company producing a Broadway musical for the first time would [...] "change the Broadway world." [...] Conceptualization began in summer 1992. For research purposes, Disney encouraged Hould-Ward to reference the animated film; she also researched clothing worn throughout the late 18th century, during which the original fairy tale was written, and spent one year discovering how household items looked during the mid-1700s. Additionally, Hould-Ward visited with <b>Beauty</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Beasts</b> original animators, spending one week learning how they created their characters to ensure that they would be recognizable to those who had seen the film. However, the designer also decided that her own creations would not exactly replicate the film's. Basing the costumes on the Rococo art movement, Hould-Ward presented her initial ideas to Eisner and then-Disney president Frank Wells. Once approved, Hould-Ward and her team spent the following year creating prototypes of each major costume. With an unusually long work schedule of two years, Hould-Ward recalled that [...] "this kind of timeline... wasn't the norm in a Broadway musical" [...] at the time.|$|R
5000|$|Disney {{released}} Dions version on {{its official}} YouTube channel on March 8, 2017, nine {{days before the}} release of the film. Although not officially released as a single from <b>Beauty</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Beasts</b> soundtrack, due to Dions unavailability to promote it, [...] "How Does a Moment Last Forever" [...] has made an impact in certain countries due to the films success at the box office. It has peaked at number one for two weeks in the singers native Canadian province of Quebec, number nine on the US Billboards Kid Digital Song Sales, number 94 on the UK Singles Downloads Chart (number 80 in Scotland) and number 124 on the French Digital Singles Chart (number 125 on the Overall Sales Chart). [...] "How Does a Moment Last Forever" [...] also proved to be successful in Asian countries like Hong Kong, Indonesia, Philippines Singapore and South Korea.|$|R
5|$|A Disney Digital 3D {{version of}} the film, the second of a {{traditionally}} animated film, was originally scheduled {{to be released in}} US theatres on February 12, 2010, but the project was postponed. On August 25, 2011, Disney announced that the 3D {{version of the}} film would make its American debut at Hollywood's El Capitan Theatre from September 2–15, 2011. Disney spent less than $10 million on the 3D conversion. After the successful 3D re-release of The Lion King, Disney announced a wide 3D re-release of <b>Beauty</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Beast</b> in North America beginning January 13, 2012.|$|E
5|$|Accompanied {{in theaters}} by the Mickey Mouse {{featurette}} The Prince and the Pauper, The Rescuers Down Under (1990) was Disney's first animated feature sequel and the studio's first film {{to be fully}} colored and composited via computer using the CAPS system. However, the film did not duplicate the success of The Little Mermaid. The next Disney animated feature, <b>Beauty</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Beast,</b> had begun production in London but was moved back to Burbank after Disney decided to shutter the London satellite office and retool the film into a musical-comedy format similar to The Little Mermaid. Alan Menken and Howard Ashman were retained to write the song score, though Ashman died before production was completed.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} {{and success of}} the movie, Walt Disney Pictures has {{announced}} the development of several live-action adaptations of their Animated Classics series. Maleficent, Cinderella, The Jungle Book and <b>Beauty</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Beast</b> have followed to similar box-office results with the latter three also earning critical praise. Disney has also announced the development of live-action adaptations of Christopher Robin, Dumbo, Aladdin, The Lion King, Mulan, Pinocchio, Fantasia, The Sword in the Stone, The Black Cauldron, Peter Pan, The Little Mermaid, and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The company also has plans for live-action spin-offs of Peter Pan, One Hundred and One Dalmatians and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs along with a live-action prequel to Aladdin.|$|E
500|$|A {{few days}} after their dinner, Braxton telephoned Ross to confirm that she had finally signed the contract; {{this was the first}} time Ross learned that Rice had {{apparently}} promised Braxton that he would write an entirely new song for her to sing in the musical if she agreed to sign the paperwork. Panicked, Ross immediately contacted Rice, who confirmed that he had in fact agreed to write a song for Braxton, blaming himself for having consumed too much alcohol during their dinner. Rice asked Ross to allow him 24 hours to review <b>the</b> musical <b>and</b> see if there was in fact a moment for which he and Menken could develop a new song, and decided to write a ballad for the second act during which Belle tells Maurice how she has changed during her stay in <b>the</b> <b>Beast's</b> castle. [...] "A Change in Me" [...] was written four years into <b>Beauty</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Beasts</b> run.|$|R
