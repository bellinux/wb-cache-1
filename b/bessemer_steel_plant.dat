50|$|Returning to {{civilian}} life, in July 1865 {{he went to}} work for the Cambria Co. and was named superintendent of the experimental Bessemer steel works in Wyandotte, Michigan. This was the first <b>Bessemer</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plant</b> to be operated in the United States. He remained in charge of the Wyandotte Bessemer Works until 1866, when he returned to Johnstown where the Cambria Co. was erecting a Bessemer plant. Since the construction of this factory was not completed until July 1871, Cambria placed Hunt in charge of the process of rolling steel ingots into rail tracks for use by the Pennsylvania Railroad. Once the Cambria Bessemer plant was put into operation, Hunt, along with John E. Fry and Alexander L. Holley introduced a new bottom casting method for which the three received a patent.|$|E
5000|$|George Merrick Rice {{was born}} in West Brookfield, Massachusetts on 20 Nov 1808 to Col. Samuel Buckminster Rice and Abigail (Bradish) Rice. [...] He {{attended}} public schools in West Brookfield, and after serving as a clerk {{for a few years}} in a country store in Leicester, Massachusetts, he moved to Worcester in 1829 and became a partner in the dry goods firm Andrew, March and Company. Shortly afterwards, he purchased the dry goods business of Burt and Merrick in 1830 and a few years later he purchased a flour and grain store near the end the Blackstone Canal in Worcester. In 1846, he became a partner in the firm of Howe, Goddard and Company (H.P. Howe and Isaac Goddard) in the manufacture of calico printing and bleaching machinery. This company eventually became the Rice, Barton, and Fales Machinery and Iron Company. [...] He became the president of the Worcester Steel Works in 1882, installing a <b>Bessemer</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plant</b> in 1884, with expanded operations producing as much as 230 tons of steel per day after addition of an open hearth steel furnace. The business operated for 30 years in Worcester {{and was one of the}} largest businesses in the city. He also served as president of the Worcester Safe Deposit and Trust Company and president of the Manufacturers Mutual Insurance Company.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the last}} three decades of the 19th century iron and steel became a leading industry, in second place by value added, with {{machinery}} being in first place. [...] The Bessemer process was the first large scale process for producing steel, which it was able to do at low cost. [...] The first U.S. licensed Bessemer plant began operation in 1865. <b>Bessemer</b> <b>steel</b> was used mostly for rails. [...] Due to difficulty in controlling quality and embrittlement with aging, <b>Bessemer</b> <b>steel</b> was not suitable for structural purposes.|$|R

5000|$|The {{success of}} John Vaughan and Henry Bolckow's Teesside's first blast furnace {{which opened in}} 1851 {{followed}} by several others, meant by 1873, Middlesbrough was producing 2 million tonnes of pig iron a year, a third of Britain's total pig iron output. Iron was in big demand in Britain in the late 19th century, particularly for {{the rapid expansion of}} the railways being built in every part of the country. More and more blast furnaces were opened in the vicinity of Middlesbrough to meet this demand such {{that by the end of}} the century Teesside was producing about a third of the nation's iron output. The growth of Middlesbrough which became known by its nickname [...] "Ironopolis" [...] was visited in 1862 by the Victorian prime Minister Gladstone who said [...] "This remarkable place, the youngest child of England's enterprise, is an infant, but if an infant, an infant Hercules"By the 1870s, steel, a much stronger and more resilient metal was in big demand and Middlesbrough had to compete with Sheffield as the major producer. In 1875 Bolckow and Vaughan opened the first <b>Bessemer</b> <b>Steel</b> <b>plant</b> in Middlesbrough and the River Tees was destined to become known as [...] "The Steel River" [...] leaving its old nickname [...] "Ironopolis" [...] behind. In 1881 one commentator described how the ironstone of the Eston Hills had been used in the building of structures throughout the world, Sir H G Ried, the British politician, was to say in reference to the great railways and bridges of the world [...] "The iron of Eston has diffused itself all over the world. it furnishes the railways of the world; it runs by neapolitan and papal dungeons; it startles the bandit in his haunt in cicilia; it crosses over the plains of Africa; it stretches over the plains of India. it has crept out of the Cleveland Hills where it has slept since Roman days, and now like a strong and invincible serpent, coils itself around the world" ...|$|E

50|$|To {{make the}} steel legally {{it was decided}} to acquire the Bessemer patent rights. Zoheth S. Durfee went to England to acquire the patent rights to the Bessemer process. He was {{unsuccessful}} at this but did observe several European steelmakers and managed to get the rights to Englishman Robert Mushet's patent use of spiegeleisen (manganese-rich pig iron) for better overall quality of steel produced this way. Meanwhile, William F. Durfee (engineer and architect), Robert Mushet, Thomas Clare and John Brown were brought in by Ward to make the procedure necessary to produce <b>Bessemer</b> <b>steel,</b> especially using spiegeleisen. He succeeded in making <b>Bessemer</b> <b>steel</b> at the experimental works of the Kelly Pneumatic Process Company owned by Ward and his investors. The first <b>Bessemer</b> <b>steel</b> made in the United States was at this factory in 1865. In Henry Bessemer's autobiography he writes that the Bessemer process was first experimentally practised in the United States with a 3-ton converter, at the ironworks of Mr. E. B. Ward, at Wyandotte, near Detroit.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>Bessemer</b> process {{revolutionized}} <b>steel</b> manufacture by decreasing its cost, from £40 per {{long ton}} to £6-7 per long ton, along with greatly increasing {{the scale and}} speed of production of this vital raw material. The process also decreased the labor requirements for steel-making. Before it was introduced, steel was far too expensive to make bridges or the framework for buildings and thus wrought iron had been used throughout the Industrial Revolution. After {{the introduction of the}} <b>Bessemer</b> process, <b>steel</b> and wrought iron became similarly priced, and some users, primarily railroads, turned to steel. Quality problems, such as brittleness caused by nitrogen in the blowing air, prevented <b>Bessemer</b> <b>steel</b> from being used for many structural applications. [...] Open-hearth steel was suitable for structural applications.|$|R

40|$|Iron {{and steel}} {{production}} grew {{dramatically in the}} U. S. when mass production technologies for steel were adopted in the 1860 s. According to new measures presented in this study, earnings inequality rose within the iron and steel industries about 1870, perhaps because technological uncertainty led to gambles and turbulence. Firms made a variety of technological choices and began formal research and development. Professional associations and journals for mechanical engineers and chemists appeared. A national market replaced local markets for iron and steel. An industrial union replaced craft unions. As new ore sources and cheap water transportation were introduced, new plants along the Great Lakes outcompeted existing plants elsewhere. Because new iron and <b>steel</b> <b>plants</b> in the 1870 s were larger than any U. S. plants had ever been, cost accounting appeared in the industry and grew in importance. Uncertainty explains the rise in inequality better than a skill bias account, according to which differences among individuals generate greater differences in wages. Analogous issues of inequality come up with respect to recent information technology. technological change, <b>Bessemer</b> <b>steel,</b> technological uncertainty, turbulence, inequality, innovation...|$|R

25|$|Carnegie {{made his}} fortune in the steel industry, {{controlling}} the most extensive integrated iron and steel operations ever owned by an individual in the United States. One of his two great innovations was in the cheap and efficient mass production of steel by adopting and adapting the <b>Bessemer</b> process for <b>steel</b> making. Sir Henry Bessemer had invented the furnace which allowed the high carbon content of pig iron to be burnt away in a controlled and rapid way. The steel price dropped as a direct result, and <b>Bessemer</b> <b>steel</b> was rapidly adopted for rails; however, it was not suitable for buildings and bridges.|$|R
