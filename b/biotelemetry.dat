5|$|Most strokes {{result from}} loss of blood supply, {{typically}} {{because of an}} embolus, rupture of a fatty plaque or narrowing of small arteries. Strokes can also result from bleeding within the brain. Transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) are strokes in which symptoms resolve within 24 hours. Investigation into the stroke will involve a medical examination (including a neurological examination) and the taking of a medical history, focusing on {{the duration of the}} symptoms and risk factors (including high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, and smoking). Further investigation is needed in younger patients. An ECG and <b>biotelemetry</b> may be conducted to identify atrial fibrillation; an ultrasound can investigate narrowing of the carotid arteries; an echocardiogram can be used to look for clots within the heart, diseases of the heart valves or the presence of a patent foramen ovale. Blood tests are routinely done as part of the workup including diabetes tests and a lipid profile.|$|E

50|$|Cardiac {{monitoring}} generally {{refers to}} {{continuous or intermittent}} monitoring of heart activity, generally by electrocardiography, with assessment of the patient's condition relative to their cardiac rhythm. It is different from hemodynamic monitoring, which monitors the pressure and flow of blood within the cardiovascular system. The two may be performed simultaneously on critical heart patients. Cardiac monitoring with a small device worn by an ambulatory patient (one well enough to walk around) is known as ambulatory electrocardiography (such as with a Holter monitor, wireless ambulatory ECG, or an implantable loop recorder). Transmitting data from a monitor to a distant monitoring station is known as telemetry or <b>biotelemetry.</b>|$|E

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 10 - 12, 1972 / International Hotel, Los Angeles, CaliforniaA date {{cannot be}} pinpointed for {{the concept of}} using {{telemetry}} for acquiring biological data; however, {{it is known that}} the birth of <b>biotelemetry</b> in the form of hardware occurred about 1921 [...] with the report of a heart sound transmitter. <b>Biotelemetry</b> matured only slightly from the twenties to the early fifties. During the fifties and sixties large amounts of money were administered through the money pipeline of the federal government. As a consequence, the growth during this period was bath rapid and grotesque, with tentacles reaching into scores of industrial and educational institutions. Duplication of efforts was quite common during this period and hundreds of miniature <b>biotelemetry</b> systems were built, but results deriving from practical application were quite limited. During the last few years, much of the chaff was shucked from this new growth, a root system developed, and <b>biotelemetry</b> found limited use as a tool in clinical medicine and in medical research. In the past <b>biotelemetry</b> has not lived up to the expectations. What about the future [...] will it really occupy an important place in clinical medicine and medical research? What is the economic outlook [...] how many jobs will it support? Which areas will require new talent? And, finally, what are the most common problems and haw can they be solved...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of <b>biotelemetry</b> {{in case of}} a RF controllable microvalve is discussed. <b>Biotelemetry</b> implies the contactless measurement of different electrical and nonelectrical parameters measured on human or animal subjects. A <b>biotelemetry</b> system consists of a transmitter and a receiver with a transmission link in-between. Transmitted information can be a biopotential or a nonelectric value like arterial pressure, respiration, body temperature or pH value. Transducers convert nonelectrical values into electrical signals. Radio frequency (RF) telemetry allows a patient greater mobility. Above all, the {{application of}} wireless communication becomes more and more popular in microinvasive surgery. Battery powered implants are most commonly used, but batteries must be changed after a period of time. To avoid this, wireless transcutaneous radio frequency (RF) communication is proposed for the powering and control of medical implants...|$|E
40|$|<b>Biotelemetry</b> can {{contribute}} towards reducing animal numbers and suffering in disciplines including physiology, pharmacology and behavioural research. However, the technique {{can also cause}} harm to animals, making <b>biotelemetry</b> a ‘refinement that needs refining’. Current welfare issues relating to the housing and husbandry of animals used in <b>biotelemetry</b> studies are single vs. group housing, provision of environmental enrichment, long term laboratory housing and use of telemetered data to help assess welfare. Animals may be singly housed because more than one device transmits on the same wavelength; due to concerns regarding damage to surgical sites; because they are wearing exteriorised jackets; or if monitoring systems can only record from individually housed animals. Much {{of this can be}} overcome by thoughtful experimental design and surgery refinements. Similarly, if <b>biotelemetry</b> studies preclude certain enrichment items, husbandry refinement protocols can be adapted to permit some environmental stimulation. Nevertheless, long-term laboratory housing raises welfare concerns and maximum durations should be defined. Telemetered data can be used to help assess welfare, helping to determine endpoints and refine future studies. The above measures will help to improve data quality as well as welfare, because experimental confounds due to physiological and psychological stress will be minimised...|$|E

40|$|The {{emerging}} {{discipline of}} Animal-Computer Interaction (ACI) aims {{to understand the}} relation between animals and technology in naturalistic settings, to design technology that can support animals in different contexts and to develop user-centred research methods and frameworks that enable animals {{to take part in}} the design process as legitimate contributors [11]. Given existing interspecies differences and communication barriers, measuring the behaviour of animals involved in ACI research can be instrumental to achieving any or all of these aims, as a way of gauging the animals’ patterns, needs and preferences. Indeed, measuring behaviour is a common practice among ACI researchers, who take various approaches to this task [5, 15, 17, 24]. In this respect, the use of <b>biotelemetry</b> devices such as VHF tags and GPS trackers, or bio-logging and environmental sensors has a significant potential [22]. At the same time, <b>biotelemetry</b> has been used for many years in many areas of biological research. <b>Biotelemetry</b> is used to improve the quality of physiological and behavioural data collected from animals and in an attempt to reduce researchers’ intrusion in the animals’ habitat [2]. However, there is evidence that carrying <b>biotelemetry</b> tags may influence the bearer’s physiology and behaviour [20]. Such impacts interfere with the validity of recorded data [14] and the welfare of individual animal wearers [1, 3, 13]. Neither of these effects are compatible with the animal-centred perspective advocated by ACI, on both scientific and ethical grounds. Our analysis of current body-attached device design and biotelemetry-enabled studies points to a general lack of wearer-centred perspective. To address these issues, we have developed a framework to inform the design of wearer-centred <b>biotelemetry</b> interventions, in order to support the implementation of animal-centred research methodologies and design solutions in ACI and other disciplines...|$|E
