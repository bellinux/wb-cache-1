25|$|While {{these efforts}} at obtaining {{international}} recognition continued, the Mongols and Russians were negotiating. At {{the end of}} 1912, Russia and the Mongols signed a treaty by which Russia acknowledged Mongol autonomy within the Republic of China; it also provided for Russian assistance in the training of a new Mongolian army and for Russian commercial privileges in Mongolia. Nevertheless, in the equivalent Mongolian version of the treaty, the terms designated independence were used. Both versions have the same value; so it was formally recognition of Mongolia as an independent state and its name Great Mongolian State. In 1913 Russia agreed to provide Mongolia with weapons and a loan of two million rubles. In 1913, Mongolia and Tibet signed a <b>bilateral</b> <b>treaty,</b> recognizing each other as independent states.|$|E

25|$|On an {{international}} level, the Soviets pursued {{until the late}} 1960s an isolationist policy. While the Tsars had concluded several short-lived bilateral copyright treaties with Western nations, the Soviet Union had no external copyright relations at all until 1967, when it concluded a first <b>bilateral</b> <b>treaty</b> with Hungary. A major change occurred in 1973, when the USSR joined the Universal Copyright Convention. Subsequently, more bilateral treaties were concluded, amongst them two with Western countries (Austria and Sweden). After its foundation as an independent successor state of the USSR, the Russian Federation joined the Berne Convention in 1995. The negotiations about the adherence of Russia to the World Trade Organization (WTO) led to several amendments of the Russian copyright law {{in order to meet}} the adherence requirements.|$|E
25|$|Both {{countries}} maintained mutual diplomatic relationships {{since the}} early-19th century when the United States established a diplomatic mission in Santa Fe de Bogota in 1823.

At that time, the Gran Colombia included {{the territory of the}} present-day republics of Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela, and Panama. U.S. relations with the government in Bogotá were not interrupted when Ecuador and Venezuela left the federation in 1830. In 1846, the U.S. Polk administration signed a treaty with Colombia, which owned Panama at the time. A railway across the isthmus was opened in 1855. Under the treaty U.S. troops landed in Panama six times in the nineteenth century to crush rebellions, ensuring that the railway was not hindered.|$|E

In 1959, Egypt and Sudan signed a <b>bilateral</b> <b>treaty,</b> the 1959 Nile Waters Agreement, which gave both countries exclusive maritime rights over the Nile waters. Ever since, Egypt {{under international law}} vetoed almost all projects in Ethiopia that sought to utilize the local Nile tributaries.

Fenagh began to associate Salvadoran immigrants with illegal land invasions, and in January 1969, the Honduran government refused to renew the 1967 <b>Bilateral</b> <b>Treaty</b> on Immigration with El Salvador that had been designed to regulate the flow of individuals across their common border. In April INA {{announced that it would}} begin to expel from their lands those who had acquired property under agrarian reform without fulfilling the legal requirement that they be Honduran by birth.

To reassure Mu'in ad-Din, Nur ad-Din curtailed his stay in Damascus and turned instead towards the Principality of Antioch, where he was able to seize Artah, Kafar Latha, Basarfut, and Balat.|$|E
