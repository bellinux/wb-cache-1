5|$|Article 14 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore, {{specifically}} Article 14(1), {{guarantees to}} Singapore citizens {{the rights to}} {{freedom of speech and}} expression, peaceful assembly without arms, and association. However, the enjoyment of these rights may <b>be</b> <b>restricted</b> by laws imposed by the Parliament of Singapore on the grounds stated in Article 14(2) of the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Article8 {{recognises}} {{the right}} of workers to form or join trade unions and protects the right to strike. It allows these rights to <b>be</b> <b>restricted</b> {{for members of the}} armed forces, police, or government administrators. Several parties have placed reservations on this clause, allowing it to be interpreted {{in a manner consistent with}} their constitutions (e.g.,China, Mexico), or extending the restriction of union rights to groups such as firefighters (e.g.,Japan).|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries trails were formed, often by the {{movement}} of game herds, that could be traveled on horseback. However, vehicular access to the summit was practically impossible until {{the construction of a}} road in 1964, and it continues to <b>be</b> <b>restricted.</b> Today, multiple trails to the summit exist, in various states of use.|$|E

50|$|A sectoral {{currency}} {{is a form}} of complementary currency that <b>is</b> <b>restricted</b> to a specific sector. Examples of sectoral currency are the Saber, which <b>is</b> <b>restricted</b> to the educational sector and thus can only be used to buy education, and the Fureai kippu, which <b>is</b> <b>restricted</b> to the health care sector.|$|R
50|$|Sicyopus is a genus {{of small}} gobies. Most are native to fast-flowing {{streams and rivers}} in Southeast Asia and Melanesia, but S. zosterophorus also occurs in China, Japan and Palau, S. nigriradiatus <b>is</b> <b>restricted</b> to Pohnpei, S. jonklaasi <b>is</b> <b>restricted</b> to Sri Lanka, and S. lord <b>is</b> <b>restricted</b> to Madagascar.|$|R
5|$|The {{choice between}} scuba and surface {{supplied}} diving equipment {{is based on}} both legal and logistical constraints. Where the diver requires mobility and a large range of movement, scuba is usually the choice if safety and legal constraints allow. Higher risk work, particularly commercial diving, may <b>be</b> <b>restricted</b> to surface supplied equipment by legislation and codes of practice.|$|E
5|$|The {{fossil record}} {{for this group}} appears to <b>be</b> <b>restricted</b> to a foot bone of an early Miocene bird from Bavaria which has been {{identified}} as an extinct representative of the climbing Certhioidea, a clade comprising the treecreepers, wallcreeper and nuthatches. It has been described as Certhiops rummeli. Two fossil species have been described in the Sitta genus: S. cuvieri Gervais, 1852 and S. senogalliensis Portis, 1888, but probably not belong to nuthatches.|$|E
5|$|Type {{safety is}} {{variable}} in COBOL. Numeric data is converted between different representations and sizes silently and alphanumeric {{data can be}} placed in any data item that can be stored as a string, including numeric and group data. In contrast, object references and pointers may only be assigned from items of the same type and their values may <b>be</b> <b>restricted</b> to a certain type.|$|E

5|$|Under Article 15(4) of the Constitution, a person's {{freedom of}} {{religion}} can <b>be</b> <b>restricted</b> by a general law relating to public order, public health or morality. The term general law is not defined in the Constitution, but may refer to a law that applies to all persons or places belonging to a particular class.|$|E
5|$|While devotional {{paintings}} – especially altarpieces – remained {{dominant in}} Early Netherlandish art, secular portraiture became increasingly common in both {{northern and southern}} Europe as artists freed themselves from the prevailing idea that portraiture should <b>be</b> <b>restricted</b> to saints and other religious figures. In Italy this development was tied to the ideals of humanism.|$|E
5|$|Alcelaphus lelwel x cokii: Known as the Kenya Highland {{hartebeest}} or the Laikipia hartebeest. It is a {{cross between}} the Lelwel and Coke's hartebeest. This hybrid is lighter in colour and larger than Coke's hartebeest. It is a light buff with reddish-tawny upper parts, and the head is longer than in Coke's hartebeest. Both sexes have horns, which are heavier as well as longer {{than those of the}} parents. It was formerly distributed throughout the western Kenyan highlands, between Lake Victoria and Mount Kenya, but is now believed to <b>be</b> <b>restricted</b> to the Lambwe Valley (south-west Kenya) and Laikipia and nearby regions of west-central Kenya.|$|E
40|$|I {{describe}} several computational complexity {{results for}} planning, {{some of which}} identify tractable planning problems. The model of planning, called &quot;propositional planning, &quot; is simple—conditions within operators are literals with no variables allowed. The different planning problems are defined by different restrictions on the preconditions and postconditions of operators. The main results are: Propositional planning is PSPACE-complete, even if operators <b>are</b> <b>restricted</b> to two positive (nonnegated) preconditions and two postconditions, or if operators <b>are</b> <b>restricted</b> to one postcondition (with any number of preconditions). It is NP-complete if operators <b>are</b> <b>restricted</b> to positive postconditions, even if operators <b>are</b> <b>restricted</b> to one precondition and one positive postcondition. It is tractable in a few restricted cases, {{one of which is}} if each operator <b>is</b> <b>restricted</b> to positive preconditions and one postcondition. The blocks-world problem, slightly modified, is a subproblem of this restricted planning problem. ...|$|R

50|$|Public {{access to}} beaches <b>is</b> <b>restricted</b> {{in some parts}} of the world. For example, most beaches on the Jersey Shore <b>are</b> <b>restricted</b> to people who can {{purchase}} beach tags.Some beaches also restrict dogs for some periods of the year.|$|R
5|$|All recent {{specimens}} of the Borneo shark {{have been collected}} solely from fishery landing sites at Mukah in Sarawak, despite thorough surveys across the rest of Borneo (including at the locality of the type specimen). Thus, its range may now <b>be</b> <b>restricted</b> to shallow, inshore waters in northwestern Borneo. Of the five earlier specimens, four came from Borneo and one from Zhoushan Island in China, hinting at a wider historical distribution. This species was also recorded from Borongan in the Philippines in 1895, and Java in 1933; these records cannot be substantiated {{and there have been}} no subsequent sightings from these areas.|$|E
5|$|Article 14(3) {{provides}} {{that the right}} to form associations may also <b>be</b> <b>restricted</b> by any law relating to labour or education. The Trade Unions Act regulates labour organizations, while schools are generally required to be registered under either the Education Act or the Private Education Act. Under the Education Act, it is an offence for pupils or other persons to assemble on the premises of a school the registration of which has been cancelled. Statutes governing universities provide that student bodies created pursuant to a university's constituent documents must be registered under the Societies Act unless the Minister for Home Affairs has exempted such bodies.|$|E
5|$|As regards proportionality, the law {{states that}} a self-defense {{may not be}} manifestly disproportionate. It is evident, that for a self-defense to be successful, {{it has to be}} {{performed}} on a level exceeding the attack. Unlike in case of necessity, the consequence of necessary self-defense may be more serious than consequence of the attack. The defense may not <b>be</b> <b>restricted</b> to a passive one, it can also be active. It is not the outcome of the incident but the sequence of actions at its beginning which determines who is to be deemed the attacker, and who is the party attacked.|$|E
5000|$|Of the {{approximately}} 40 extant species, the natural range of five (comprising the genus Francolinus) <b>are</b> <b>restricted</b> to Asia, while the remaining genera <b>are</b> <b>restricted</b> to Africa.

30|$|Appendix Table  7 {{presents}} the (weighted) {{number of cases}} and means for the analysis variables from 2003 to 2013. In 2003 all respondents were in full-time education so no labour market outcomes could be analysed. For occupational status, earnings and full-time employment, the analyses <b>were</b> <b>restricted</b> to respondents employed and not studying full-time. For employment, the analyses <b>were</b> <b>restricted</b> to respondents not in full-time study. For unemployment, the analyses <b>were</b> <b>restricted</b> to respondents in the labour force.|$|R
5|$|As {{the wing}} develops, the dorsal and ventral integumental layers become closely apposed {{over most of}} their area forming the wing membrane. The {{remaining}} areas form channels, the future veins, in which the nerves and tracheae may occur. The cuticle surrounding the veins becomes thickened and more heavily sclerotized to provide strength and rigidity to the wing. Two types of hair may occur on the wings: microtrichia, which are small and irregularly scattered, and macrotrichia, which are larger, socketed, and may <b>be</b> <b>restricted</b> to veins. The scales of Lepidoptera and Trichoptera are highly modified macrotrichia.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{findings}} of these and other studies in the early 1970s, the current consensus is that the use of methoxyflurane should <b>be</b> <b>restricted</b> only to healthy individuals, in situations where it offers specific advantages and even then, only at dosages less than 2.5MAC hours. Partly because of these warnings, but also because of the development of newer volatile anesthetics such as enflurane, isoflurane, desflurane and sevoflurane, the clinical use of methoxyflurane as a general anesthetic in humans was largely abandoned in the mid-1970s.|$|E
5|$|Electoral success overtook {{the party}} and Janmaat began to make {{controversial}} statements in the media. Based on his conviction that high office should <b>be</b> <b>restricted</b> to third-generation Dutch nationals, he suggested that several cabinet ministers, including Justice Minister Ernst Hirsch-Ballin who was of Jewish descent, and Agriculture State Secretary Dzsingisz Gabor who was of Hungarian descent, should {{be removed from the}} Dutch leadership. This marked the start of prosecutions of Centre Democrats party members on charges of racism, as well as the decision by the other parties in Parliament and government to place a cordon sanitaire around the party.|$|E

5|$|Some {{species have}} large natural ranges. The eared dove ranges across the {{entirety}} of South America from Colombia to Tierra del Fuego, the Eurasian collared dove has a massive (if discontinuous) distribution from Britain across Europe, the Middle East, India, Pakistan and China, and the laughing dove across most of sub-Saharan Africa, as well as India, Pakistan, and the Middle East. Other species have tiny, <b>restricted</b> distributions; this <b>is</b> most common in island endemics. The whistling dove is endemic to the tiny Kadavu Island in Fiji, the Caroline ground dove <b>is</b> <b>restricted</b> to two islands, Truk and Pohnpei in the Caroline Islands, and the Grenada dove <b>is</b> <b>restricted</b> to Grenada in the Caribbean. Some continental species also have tiny distributions; for example, the black-banded fruit dove <b>is</b> <b>restricted</b> to a small area of the Arnhem Land of Australia, the Somali pigeon <b>is</b> <b>restricted</b> to a tiny area of northern Somalia, and Moreno's ground dove <b>is</b> <b>restricted</b> to the area around Salta and Tucuman in northern Argentina.|$|R
5|$|Friedman {{rejected}} {{the use of}} fiscal policy {{as a tool of}} demand management; and he held that the government's role in the guidance of the economy should <b>be</b> <b>restricted</b> severely. Friedman wrote extensively on the Great Depression, which he termed the Great Contraction, arguing that it had been caused by an ordinary financial shock whose duration and seriousness were greatly increased by the subsequent contraction of the money supply caused by the misguided policies of the directors of the Federal Reserve.|$|E
5|$|Greece, Australia, France, and United Kingdom are {{the only}} {{countries}} to be represented at every Olympic Games since their inception in 1896. While countries sometimes miss an Olympics {{due to a lack}} of qualified athletes, some choose to boycott a celebration of the Games for various reasons. The Olympic Council of Ireland boycotted the 1936 Berlin Games, because the IOC insisted its team needed to <b>be</b> <b>restricted</b> to the Irish Free State rather than representing the entire island of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Historically the King of the Welsh {{people would}} travel, with his court, in a circuit, {{demanding}} tribute {{in the form}} of food from communities they visited as they went. The tribute was codified in the Laws of Hywel Dda, showing that people lived on beer, bread, meat and dairy products, with few vegetables beyond cabbages and leeks. The laws show how much value was put on different parts of Welsh life at the time, for example that wealth was measured in cattle; they also show that the court included hunters, who would <b>be</b> <b>restricted</b> to seasonal hunting sessions.|$|E
50|$|All {{species of}} Chondrina <b>are</b> <b>restricted</b> to the West Palaearctic. Centers of species {{diversity}} are {{found on the}} Iberian peninsula, in northern Italy and in the Balkans.

50|$|In 1981, the Adult Accompaniment {{rating was}} {{introduced}} which allowed films {{to be classified}} so that children under 14 <b>were</b> <b>restricted</b> unless escorted by an adult. The classification was developed to open films of social significance to younger audiences which might otherwise have <b>been</b> <b>restricted.</b> In developing the new classification, provincial officials noted that the film One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest <b>was</b> <b>restricted</b> to adults only, although the film {{was based on a}} book that was studied by many high school students.|$|R
25|$|The airline {{transport}} pilot licencehelicopter <b>is</b> <b>restricted</b> to {{aerial work}} only if the night and instrument flight time requirements are not met.
