50|$|The Western <b>broad-toothed</b> <b>field</b> <b>mouse</b> (Apodemus epimelas) is {{a species}} of rodent in the genus Apodemus from southeastern Europe. It is related to A. mystacinus, which occurs further to the east.|$|E
50|$|The <b>broad-toothed</b> <b>field</b> <b>mouse</b> (Apodemus mystacinus) is {{a species}} of rodent in the family Muridae.It is found in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Georgia, Greece, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Serbia and Montenegro.|$|E
50|$|The steppe <b>field</b> <b>mouse</b> (Apodemus witherbyi) is {{a species}} of rodent in the family Muridae found in Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Israel, Turkey, Jordan, Iran, Turkmenistan, Pakistan, and {{probably}} Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon, and Syria. The Mount Hermon <b>field</b> <b>mouse</b> (sometimes recognized as a distinct species: A. hermonensis) and the yellow-breasted <b>field</b> <b>mouse</b> (sometimes recognized as a distinct species: A. fulvipectus) were considered conspecific with the steppe <b>field</b> <b>mouse</b> by Musser and Carleton (2005).|$|R

50|$|Fossils {{of another}} species, {{originally}} identified as Rhagamys minor, and {{dating back to}} the early and middle Pleistocene, are also found on Corsica and Sardinia, but this species has been reallocated to Rhagapodemus. Rhagamys orthodon seems to be most closely related to Rhagapodemus and to the field mice (Apodemus). Its molars {{are similar to those of}} the wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) and the striped field mouse (Apodemus agrarius) but are larger and more derived, being hypsodont teeth suitable for feeding on a coarse, abrasive diet. Over time, Rhagamys orthodon increased in size and became larger than the <b>broad-toothed</b> <b>field</b> <b>mouse</b> (Apodemus mystacinus).|$|E
50|$|The {{woodland}} vegetation is good {{habitat for}} various animals, including wolves and jackals, foxes, porcupines, hyraxes, mongooses and the <b>broad-toothed</b> <b>field</b> <b>mouse</b> (Apodemus mysticanus). In a cave {{at the top}} of the Mount, long-fingered bats (Myotis capaccini), can be found roosting. Various reptiles can also be found including; the Greek tortoise (Testudo graeca), the hardun lizard (Stellagama stellio), the Lebanon lizard (Phoenicolacerta laevi) and the red whip snake (Platyceps collaris). The woodland is also a good habitat for various birds including jays (Garrulus), Syrian woodpeckers (Dendrocopos syriacus), Sardinian warblers (Sylvia melanocephala), Eurasian hobbies (Falco subbuteo), great tits (Parus major), great spotted cuckoos (Clamator glandarius) and snake eagles (Circaetus).|$|E
40|$|Daily and {{seasonal}} variations in physiological characteristics of mammals {{can be considered}} adaptations to temporal habitat variables. Across different ecosystems, physiological adjustments {{are expected to be}} sensitive to different environmental signals such as changes in photoperiod, temperature or water and food availability; the relative importance of a particular signal being dependent on the ecosystem in question. Energy intake, oxygen consumption (VO 2) and body temperature (Tb) daily rhythms were compared between two populations of the <b>broad-toothed</b> <b>field</b> <b>mouse</b> Apodemus mystacinus, one from a Mediterranean and another from a sub-Alpine ecosystem. Mice were acclimated to short-day (SD) ‘winter ’ and long-day (LD) ‘summer ’ photoperiods under different levels of salinity simulating osmotic challenges. Mediterranean mice had higher VO 2 values than sub-Alpine mice. In addition, mice exposed to short days had higher VO 2 values when given water with a high salinity compared with mice exposed to long days. By comparison, across both populations, increasing salinity resulted in a decreased Tb in SD- but not in LD-mice. Thus, SD-mice may conserve energy by decreasing Tb during (‘winter’) conditions which are expected to be cool, whereas LD-mice might do the opposite and maintain a higher Tb during (‘summer’) conditions which are expected to be warm. LD-mice behaved to reduce energy expenditure, which might be considered a useful trait during ‘summer ’ conditions. Overall, increasing salinity was a clear signal for Mediterranean-mice with resultant effects on VO 2 and Tb daily rhythms but had less of an effect on sub-Alpine mice, which were mor...|$|E

40|$|The <b>broad-toothed</b> <b>field</b> <b>mouse</b> (Apodemus mystacinus) is {{distributed}} throughout the Balkan Peninsula, Asia Minor and the Middle East. It is generally split into two different specific entities: Apodemus epimelas occurs on the Balkan Peninsula and A. mystacinus inhabits Asia Minor and the Middle East. This analysis, based on two mitochondrial regions (cytochrome b and the D-loop) and the interstitial retinol binding protein (IRBP) nuclear gene, confirms an important level of genetic divergence between the animals from these regions and their separation from each other at least 4. 2 - 5. 1 Mya, which is in favour of a distinct specific status. Finally, the broad-toothed field mice from southwestern Turkey appear to be {{closely related to the}} animals from Crete but highly distinct from the populations of the other Oriental regions. This supports a distinct subspecific level (A. m. rhodius) for the insular animals and also for those from south-western Turkey. From a biogeographical point of view, it can be assumed that either late Pliocene or early Pleistocene cooling led to the isolation of two main groups of A. mystacinus, one in the Balkan region and the other one in Turkey and the Near East (Syria and Israel). In this region, it is suggested that a more recent event appeared during the Quaternary period, isolating broad-toothed field mice in Crete and leading to the appearance of two well-differentiated genetic groups: one in Crete and south-western Turkey, and the other widespread in northern and eastern Turkey {{as well as in the}} Near East. © 2005 The Linnean Society of London.

50|$|The {{wood mouse}} (Apodemus sylvaticus) {{is a common}} murid rodent from Europe and northwestern Africa.

50|$|Large Japanese <b>field</b> <b>mice</b> forage {{primarily}} at night, likely to avoid predation. They {{are known to}} be seed-eating mice, particularly around autumn and winter, as the mice hoard acorns and walnuts, which comprise 13-100% of their food.

Mast seeding can have serious effects on <b>field</b> <b>mouse</b> populations, including increases in overwinter survival, winter reproduction, and population density.|$|R
40|$|Detection of {{non-target species}} during {{distribution}} surveys {{may influence the}} detection of the focal species, due to bait being consumed, or trapping devices inactivated. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of non-target species (<b>field</b> <b>mice,</b> Apodemus sp.) on the detection and occupancy estimates of a target species (the red squirrel, Sciurus vulgaris) during hair-tubes surveys. Following a modelling approach that accounted for imperfect detection of both target and non-target species, we tested the hypothesis that detection probability of the red squirrel is affected by detection of <b>field</b> <b>mice.</b> We also investigated the level of bias that occurred in estimation of key-parameters such as probability of presence and detection probability. Our results show that detection of red squirrels and <b>field</b> <b>mice</b> using hair-tubes surveys is not independent. Detection probability of the red squirrel was higher when <b>field</b> <b>mice</b> did not visit the hair-tubes. Nevertheless, there was no bias in parameter estimates, therefore relatively accurate estimates would have been obtained despite this interference...|$|R
