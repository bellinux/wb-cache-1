50|$|Two yacht club facilities, the New Orleans Yacht Club and Southern Yacht Club, {{along with}} a number of marine-related <b>businesses,</b> <b>condominiums,</b> and boathouses, occupy the area {{surrounding}} the park, marinas, and boat channels. West End's most recognizable icon, the New Canal Lighthouse or more commonly New Basin Canal Lighthouse, originally constructed in 1838, was heavily damaged by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Reconstruction of the familiar landmark began in February 2012 and was completed in 2013.|$|R
50|$|South Core is a {{neighbourhood}} {{located in}} downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The remodeling and restoration of Union Station {{and the construction}} of a new wave of <b>business</b> and <b>condominium</b> towers is central to this area's forecast growth.|$|R

50|$|Companies can be {{installed}} in the Campo Bom segment of the VALETEC Park under three different modalities: inside the Feevale’s Technology Incubator, ITEF, for pre-incubation and incubation; in business accelerators and <b>business</b> <b>condominiums,</b> such as the Alberto Santos Dumont Business Center and the Montserrat Business Condominium; and in individual facilities, which companies may choose to either purchase or rent. Feevale is a regional community university (public, yet not state-owned) which operates in the Campo Bom segment of the VALETEC Park through its Academic Extension Center. This is a space for learning, research and extension activities, with an auditorium, event hall, meeting rooms, restaurant and areas for partners and advanced service providers. In the surroundings of the Academic Extension Center, there are several green preservation areas which make perfect spots for relaxing outdoors, with plenty of shadow to contemplate nature and exercise creativity.|$|R

50|$|Located on the {{southeast}} {{side of the}} city, across Sam Rayburn Tollway from the larger part of the city, is Austin Ranch, a mixed-use development consisting of retail <b>businesses,</b> apartments and <b>condominiums.</b>|$|R
50|$|The town's {{population}} oscillated until World War II, when {{it began}} growing steadily. Currently, it is largely residential, with an elementary school, some <b>businesses,</b> and many <b>condominiums</b> in the unincorporated areas {{to the north and}} south.|$|R
50|$|In {{previous}} decades, much of {{the land}} was unusable due to its designation as rail lands. Today, that stigma is gone as multiple <b>business</b> and <b>condominium</b> towers have risen and more continue to be built. The name South Core derives from south of the downtown (or financial) core of the city. The name of the area mimics the district names Soho in New York City and Soho in West End of London.|$|R
50|$|In {{the central}} <b>business</b> district, {{residential}} <b>condominium</b> buildings, such as Le Roc Fleuri and Le 1200 Ouest (Tours Lépine), {{have been constructed}} in the mid-2000s between the office towers which {{were built in the}} late 1980s and early 1990s.|$|R

50|$|The {{district}} is located between the affluent North Slope residential neighborhood and the Hilltop neighborhood. The area shares {{more in common}} with Tacoma's downtown owing to its urban nature and large population of apartment-dwelling working class residents. The area consists primarily of <b>businesses,</b> apartment & <b>condominium</b> buildings, some with views of Commencement Bay. Like most of downtown Tacoma, the area is gentrifying.|$|R
50|$|In 2007, {{much of the}} {{remainder}} of the property became Piemonte, a mixed-use development with <b>condominiums,</b> <b>business</b> offices, and some retail stores. In the fall of 2008, the centerpiece of Piemonte opened: the Citizens Business Bank Arena, an 11,000-seat sports and entertainment venue. The arena is home to the AHL Ontario Reign, and is built in the general area of Turn 3 of the old Ontario track.|$|R
5000|$|The {{concentration}} of mostly retail businesses on N 55th Street near Meridian Avenue is known variously as Tangletown or Meridian and {{considered by some}} to be more closely associated with Greenlake than Wallingford. The likely source for the name Tangletown is the irregular configuration of Seattle' s street grid in this transition zone, where Wallingford shades into the Green Lake neighborhood, some of which follow the contours of Green Lake, others conforming to the city's basic grid. An alternative explanation is that the neighborhood was given the name Tangletown years ago, when a streetcar interchange occupied the space where <b>businesses</b> and <b>condominiums</b> now stand. Meridian sometimes refers to a wider neighborhood than Tangletown, which refers strictly to the retail district.|$|R
5|$|During the 1980s, Gravel was a {{real estate}} {{developer}} in Anchorage and Kenai, Alaska, a consultant, and a stockbroker. One of his real estate ventures, a <b>condominium</b> <b>business,</b> was forced to declare bankruptcy and a lawsuit ensued. During 1986, Gravel worked in partnership with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets to buy losses that financially troubled Alaska Native Corporations could not take as tax deductions and sell them to large national companies looking for tax writeoffs.|$|R
30|$|Consequently, the Customer site dataset {{shows the}} number of {{customer}} sites of each power line per grid square, while the Line measurement dataset indicates the amount of flowing energy through the lines at time t. Customer sites provide energy to different types of customers (e.g. houses, <b>condominiums,</b> <b>business</b> activities, industries etc.), which require different amount of electricity. For privacy reasons this information is hidden, meaning that in the dataset the energy flowing is uniformly distributed among {{the various types of}} customers.|$|R

Mirror Lake {{can be seen}} in the photo as well as the harbor off in the distance, which houses the St. Petersburg Municipal Marina. Located right in front of the marina are the Bayfront Tower Condominiums. An aerial view of Saint Petersburg taken today will show how much the city has been built up since 1978. There are many more <b>businesses,</b> hotels and <b>condominiums</b> that have been constructed in St. Petersburg over the past 34 years. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|The face of North Carolina’s {{coast is}} changing. Rampant {{development}} {{is leading a}} shift from traditional working waterfront communities, which support commercial fishing and related <b>businesses,</b> to <b>condominiums</b> and housing developments. The loss of working waterfronts, including the subsequent economic, cultural, and historical changes, coupled {{with the loss of}} public access to public trust waters, led the North Carolina General Assembly to take action. In 2006, the General Assembly created the Waterfront Access Study Committee and charged the Committee with examining the changing nature of North Carolina’s coast and recommending ways for the state to halt these changes. This masters project reviews the progress and current status of the waterfront access program in North Carolina, and it explores opportunities for Environmental Defense Fund {{to get involved in the}} waterfront access issue, either through the state program or through alternative opportunities.

5|$|Michael (Steve Carell), {{having left}} Dunder Mifflin with Pam (Jenna Fischer) to form his own company, {{is having trouble}} {{starting}} his first day {{as president of the}} Michael Scott Paper Company. Pam tries to keep things together and suggests they create a list of things to do to maintain a positive working atmosphere. Michael sets up a meeting with a potential investor and makes a list of potential salesmen to join the company. He receives a letter from his realtor saying that running a <b>business</b> from his <b>condominium</b> is in violation of his residence agreement, so he needs to find office space for the company. Michael and Pam leave to find potential salesmen and then have their meeting with the potential investor.|$|R
40|$|The face of North Carolina’s {{coast is}} changing. Rampant {{development}} {{is leading a}} shift from traditional working waterfront communities, which support commercial fishing and related <b>businesses,</b> to <b>condominiums</b> and housing developments. The loss of working waterfronts, including the subsequent economic, cultural, and historical changes, coupled {{with the loss of}} public access to public trust waters, led the North Carolina General Assembly to take action. In 2006, the General Assembly created the Waterfront Access Study Committee (WASC) and charged the Committee with examining the changing nature of North Carolina’s coast and recommending ways for the state to halt these changes. This masters project reviews the progress and current status of the waterfront access program in North Carolina, and it explores opportunities for Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) {{to get involved in the}} waterfront access issue. The report relies on information from literature reviews, interviews, and attendance at three public meetings. The report begins with a review of the work of the WASC and its recommendations. It then reviews the General Assembly’s response to the WASC’s report. The General Assembly’s actions included the extension of present use value taxation to working waterfront properties, the creation of the Advisory Committee for the Coordination of Waterfront Access (646 Committee) to oversee future waterfront access work, and the establishment of the Waterfront Access and Marine Industry Fund (WAMI), which will distribute $ 20 million for working waterfront and public access projects throughout the state. Present use value taxation offers little opportunity for involvement by EDF. The 646 Committee provides opportunities for EDF to monitor the state’s waterfront access program and suggest improvements or new actions. The WAMI allows EDF to monitor and comment on projects receiving funding and to identify additional sites for funding. EDF also could get involved in waterfront access by building relationships with developers, establishing working relationships with fishermen, advocating for the creation of a new waterfront access fund with conservation goals, and supporting fishermen in their own efforts to preserve working waterfronts. These suggestions can help guide EDF’s decision whether to expend resources to get involved in waterfront access issues in North Carolina...|$|R
40|$|Florida {{is a major}} rookery {{site for}} Atlantic loggerhead (Carretta carretta) and {{important}} nesting grounds for green (Chelonia mydas) and leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea) sea turtles. South Florida is becoming a highly urbanized area with increased coastal development (i. e. <b>condominiums,</b> <b>businesses,</b> and hotels). Artificial lighting from these structures repels nesting females and impairs the natural cues used by hatchlings to orient to the sea, thereby increasing mis- and- disorientation events of the sea turtles. Florida Fish 2 ̆ 6 Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) and Broward County Environmental Protection Department attempted {{to address this problem}} by relocating nests to darker beaches. Unfortunately, this alternative enabled residents and commercial businesses to prolong compliance to established lighting ordinances. In an attempt to have the lighting ordinances enforced, FWC recently ordered that fewer nests be relocated in Broward County, FL. As a result, many hatchlings during the nesting seasons of 2006 and 2007 were adversely affected by beach lighting and suffered high mortality due to exhaustion, dehydration, and predation. Municipalities with established lighting ordinances and the level of enforcement have identified areas in need of improvement and further enforcement. The effectiveness of existing ordinances has also shown strengths and weaknesses within the legal system. In addition, areas without lighting ordinances have been identified and proposed ordinances are currently being sought. The purpose of this project was to examine mis-and-dis orientation events over the past two nesting seasons, where less nest relocation occurred, in order to ascertain any significant differences. With this information, current lighting ordinances and proposed lighting ordinances can be modified to ensure the greatest survival rate for sea turtles...|$|R
