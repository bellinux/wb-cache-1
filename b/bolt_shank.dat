40|$|A {{finite element}} model with {{three-dimensional}} solid elements is established to investigate the structural performance of bolted connections between cold-formed steel strips and hot rolled steel plates under shear. Non-linear material, geometrical and contact analysis is carried out to predict the load-extension curves of typical bolted connections with cold-formed steel strips of high yield strength and low ductility. The failure mode {{of interest in the}} present investigation is the bearing failure of cold-formed steel strip around bolt holes; a full description of the {{finite element model}} is presented. Based on test data, a stress-strain curve for the cold-formed steel strip is proposed which allows the cold-formed steel strip to yield and degrade in strength at large strain. The load-extension curves of four sets of test specimens were successfully predicted up to an extension of 3 mm. The predicted bearing resistance and the extensional stiffness of the bolted connections compare well with test data.

40|$|A {{finite element}} model with {{three-dimensional}} solid elements was established to investigate the bearing failure of cold-formed steel bolted connections under shear. It was demonstrated (Chung and Ip. Engineering Structures 2000; 22 : 1271 - 1284) that the predicted load-extension curves of bolted connections in lap shear tests followed closely to the measured load-extension curves provided that measured steel strengths and geometrical dimensions {{were used in the}} analysis. Furthermore, it was shown (Chung and Ip. Proceedings of the Second European Conference on Steel Structures, Praha, May 1999, p. 503 - 506) that stress-strain curves, contact stiffnesses and frictional coefficients between element interfaces, and clamping forces developed in <b>bolt</b> <b>shanks</b> were important parameters for accurate prediction of the deformation characteristics of bolted connections. This paper presents an extension of the finite element investigation onto the structural behaviour of cold-formed steel bolted connections, and three distinctive failure modes (Ip and Chung. Proceeding of the Second International Conference on Advances in Steel Structures, Hong Kong, December 1999) as observed in lap shear tests are successfully modelled: bearing failure; shear-out failure; and net-section failure. Furthermore, a parametric study on bolted connections with different configurations is performed to provide bearing resistances for practical design, and the results of the {{finite element model}}ling are also compared with four codified design rules. It is found that the design rules are not applicable for bolted connections with high strength steels due to reduced ductility. Consequently, a semiempirical design formula for bearing resistance of bolted connections is proposed after calibrating against finite element results. The proposed design rule relates the bearing resistances with the design yield and tensile strengths of steel strips through a strength coefficient. It is demonstrated that the design rule is applicable for bolted connections of both low strength and high strength steels with different ductility limits.

Since 1989, successive UT inspections in various European plants have revealed a trend of progressive indications. Different bolt and locking designs have been used during the initial design and building phase of the plants. Lock-bar style bolts are one type of bolts which are used in numerous plants in Europe and the US. Lock-bar style bolts pose a challenge due to limited ultrasonic probe access availability. Furthermore, the inspection approach has to capture indications in the bolt threaded region {{as well as in}} the <b>bolt</b> head to <b>shank</b> interface. During recently performed qualifications in Europe the ultrasonic inspection of lock-bar style bolts has been improved by using advanced probe design and an an alysis approach.

Inner hexagon (hex) bolts with a locking washer represent another design used in several plants in Europe and the US. This bolt design poses another challenge based on varying cone dimensions and limited access through the inner hex. Ultrasonic beam field simulations have been performed to support and verify laboratory and qualification testing. This paper describes the qualification process in more detail.

40|$|The {{physical}} characteristics of hydrogen embrittlement failure of subsea bolts operating under CP are surface cracks at thread and shank area {{and for some}} cases they are completely ruptured from the shank area. The metallurgical reason for failure already reported by researchers (including for Inconel 718) was the interaction of hydrogen atoms with grain boundary precipitates (Ni 3 Nb δ) resulting in hydrogen assisted intergranular cracking. Inconel 718 was received as rectangular block (RB) and bolts (Φ 28 mm). They were heat treated as per API 6 A 718 specifications. The yield strength and vickers hardness found for API aged RB specimen S 2 API was 840 MPa and 340 HV respectively. On the other hand API bolt was found with bulk yield strength of 880 MPa and vickers hardness in the range 370 - 400 HV (bulk to edge of the bolt). The structure of <b>bolt</b> (bulk, <b>shank</b> and thread) and rectangular block was investigated, using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), to understand {{the reason for this}} difference. The experimental results were compared with theoretical predictions. The microstructure of the API bolt shows no evidence of intergranular (Ni 3 Nb δ) precipitates and the nano-structure revealed γ’ and Ni 3 Nb γ’’ precipitates. This suggest that for Inconel 718 in the form of bolts the theory of intergranular cracking hydrogen enhanced de-cohesion at the grain boundary matrix precipitate interfaces is not specifically relevant instead the transgranular oversized γ’ precipitates (50 nm γ’ at thread edge of the bolt) and the elongated metastable γ’’ discs (50 - 100 nm at shank and thread edge of the bolt) could act as initiation point for HEDE. Moreover, it was also found that threading of the bolt (after heat treatment) results in shearing of γ’ precipitates at threads edge. These sheared γ’ precipitates could aid in trapping hydrogen atoms under CP in service leading to HEDE. The newly developed bolting materials Incoloy 945 and its higher strength version 945 x (as rectangular and cylindrical blocks) were added for structural investigation because of lower content of Nb present in their matrix than 718.

30|$|The {{analysis}} {{was carried out}} with a monotonically incremental loading scheme for all connection models imitating experimental loading procedure. The connection models are analyzed in three loading steps. In the first step, a prescribed force, 40  % of minimum tensile strength of bolt, {{is applied to the}} pretension node of a predefined section of the <b>bolt</b> <b>shank.</b> As a result, the length of <b>bolt</b> <b>shank</b> at the pretension section changes by the amount necessary to carry the prescribed load. In the second step, the prescribed bolt load is replaced by changing the length of pretension section back to the initial length. Bolt pretension force of all models (excluding A 1 Po, FE 5 and FE 6) is prescribed as 40  % of the ultimate strength of bolt. For connection models A 1 Po, FE 5 and FE 6, corresponding values are 0, 20 and 60  % of the ultimate strength of bolt, respectively. Thus, A 1 Po connection model designated with subscript ‘Po’ as listed in Table  2 is analyzed considering zero pretension force of bolts. In the third step, bending moment is introduced to the beam-to-column connection by employing vertical displacement of the middle section of plane Z–X of the stub column (Fig.  3). Automatic load increment scheme is preferred because ABAQUS can select the precise incremental rate to attain the optimum computational efficiency.|$|E
30|$|The {{modelling}} {{of contacts}} between various components {{plays a major}} role in the performance of the connection. The bolt pre-tension and friction are the most critical parameters. The forces are transmitted by friction between members as a result of bolt pre-tensioning. The contact pairs are web angles to beam web/column flange, <b>bolt</b> <b>shank</b> to bolt hole, and bolt head to respective components. Out of these, the contact between <b>bolt</b> <b>shank</b> and bolt hole is frictionless, whereas the others are friction contact. The interaction consists of two components, one normal to the surface and the other tangential to the surface. The tangential component consists of relative motion between the surfaces and frictional shear stress, if connection is made up of HSFG bolts. Hard contact is given between the surfaces, i.e., the surfaces separate, when the contact pressure between them becomes zero or negative. While in contact the normal and shear forces are transmitted from one surface to another. Thus, a suitable value of friction coefficient should be given such that the frictional forces resist relative sliding of the surface. To simulate the exact connection behaviour, finite sliding contact pair definition is given between the two surfaces, one of which is the master and other is slave surface. The master surface should be a discontinuous surface and the surface intersecting the master is called slave surface.|$|E

These include, a clamped joint with clearance fit between the bolt and hole, a clamped joint with the bolt in an interference fit with the hole, a flanged joint which allows the flange and bolt to bend; and a shear joint in a clevis and tang configuration. These applications were initially developed for measuring and monitoring preload in the NASA Space Shuttle Orbiter critical joints but are also applicable for monitoring loads in other critical bolted joints of structures such as transportation bridges and other aerospace structures.

The new blind-bolt is {{a modified version of}} the standard Lindapter Hollo-bolt, and its application relates to the construction of bolted, moment-resisting connections between open profile beams and concrete-filled tubular columns. The fatigue behaviour of the system is studied on the basis of constant amplitude loading tests, with a total of 56 experiments being reported. The specimens were subjected to tensile loading for various stress ranges, with the repeated load being selected relative to the design yield stress of the blind-bolt's internal shank. The influence of testing frequency and strength of concrete infill is also examined.

A finite element model of the modified connection was modeled, analyzed and compared to the original finite element model prior to modification to show their correlation...|$|E
