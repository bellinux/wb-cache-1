5|$|A monarch is {{the head}} of a monarchy, a form of {{government}} in which a state or polity is ruled <b>by</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> who normally rules for life or until abdication, and typically inherits the throne by birth. Monarchs may be autocrats (as in all absolute monarchies) or may be ceremonial figureheads, exercising only limited or no reserve powers at all, with actual authority vested in a legislature and/or executive cabinet (as in many constitutional monarchies). In many cases, a monarch will also be linked with a state religion. Most states only have a single monarch at any given time, although a regent may rule when the monarch is a minor, not present, or otherwise incapable of ruling. Cases in which two monarchs rule simultaneously over a single state, as is the current situation in Andorra, are known as coregencies.|$|E

50|$|Biological {{determinism}} {{of human}} gender roles {{is the belief}} that human sexuality is controlled <b>by</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual's</b> genes or some component of their physiology.

5|$|Idiots and lunatics {{had their}} land looked after by a court-appointed administrator, and any profits {{went into a}} trust fund to support the insane person. Due to the vested {{interest}} of the King (who would hold the lands) the actual lunacy or idiocy was determined by a jury, not <b>by</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> judge. Under the Lunacy Act 1845 the Lord Chancellor {{had a right to}} appoint a commission to investigate the insanity of an individual; as part of his role as Keeper of the King's conscience, however, he would only do this when it was beneficial to the lunatic, not simply because somebody had been found insane.|$|E
5|$|Large whales, such as mysticetes, are {{not usually}} subject to predation, but smaller whales, such as monodontids or ziphiids, are. These species are preyed on by the killer whale or orca. To subdue and kill whales, orcas {{continuously}} ram them with their heads; this can sometimes kill bowhead whales, or severely injure them. Other times they corral the narwhals or belugas before striking. They are typically hunted by groups of 10 or fewer orcas, but they are seldom attacked <b>by</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual.</b> Calves are more commonly taken by orcas, but adults can be targeted as well.|$|E
5|$|Many {{recently}} developed SGDs include performance measurement and analysis tools to help monitor the content used <b>by</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual.</b> This raises concerns about privacy, and {{some argue that}} the device user {{should be involved in}} the decision to monitor use in this way. Similar concerns have been raised regarding the proposals for devices with automatic content generation, and privacy is increasingly a factor in design of SGDs. As AAC devices are designed to be used in all areas of a user’s life, there are sensitive legal, social, and technical issues centred on a wide family of personal data management problems that can be found in contexts of AAC use. For example, SGDs may have to be designed so that they support the user's right to delete logs of conversations or content that has been added automatically.|$|E
