5|$|In the 1980s, the USAF <b>began</b> <b>looking</b> for a {{replacement}} for its fighter aircraft, especially to counter the USSR's advanced Sukhoi Su-27 and Mikoyan MiG-29. Several companies submitted design proposals; the USAF selected proposals from Northrop and Lockheed. Northrop teamed with McDonnell Douglas to develop the YF-23, while Lockheed, Boeing and General Dynamics developed the YF-22.|$|E

5|$|Decline {{in market}} demand {{combined}} with movement restrictions {{imposed by the}} Israeli military {{have led to a}} deterioration of the local economy, particularly in the trade and the stone-cutting industries. In 2007, unemployment reached 30%. Consequently, many unemployed persons <b>began</b> <b>looking</b> into agriculture to earn income. The most cultivated crops are grains, especially barley, followed by lentils and chick peas. A sizable segment of the population raise livestock and 10% breed their own domestic animals. In total, there are 144 cows, 7,000 goats, 14,000 sheep, and 500 beehives. Much of the town's agricultural products are sold in Hebron.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{his final}} year on campus, Middleton was once again pressed by the {{university}} president to retire from the army {{and go to work}} for the college.

Not having been overseas in over sixteen years, he put in a request for duty in the Philippines. He finished his tenure at LSU in the summer of 1936, having overseen the increase in students completing the ROTC program from about 500 to over 1700 cadets.|$|E

5|$|In early July, a {{few days}} after a communist-led mass {{uprising}} commenced, Aćimović reshuffled his government, replacing three commissioners and appointing deputies for most of the portfolios. By mid-July, the Germans had decided that the Aćimović regime was incompetent and unable to deal with the uprising, and <b>began</b> <b>looking</b> for a replacement. At the end of August this resulted in the resignation of the Commissioner Government and the appointment of the Government of National Salvation led by former Minister of the Army and Navy General Milan Nedić, in which Aćimović initially retained the Interior portfolio.|$|E

5|$|Recognizing {{that the}} delays that {{affected}} {{the development and}} deployment of the CF-100 could also affect its successor, {{and the fact that}} the Soviets were working on newer jet-powered bombers that would render the CF-100 ineffective, the RCAF <b>began</b> <b>looking</b> for a supersonic, missile-armed replacement for the Canuck even before it had entered service. In March 1952, the RCAF's Final Report of the All-Weather Interceptor Requirements Team was submitted to Avro Canada.|$|E
5|$|Spedding {{recruited}} two chemistry {{professors at}} Ames for his group there, Harley Wilhelm and I. B. Johns. Spedding and Wilhelm <b>began</b> <b>looking</b> {{for ways to}} create the uranium metal. At the time, it was produced {{in the form of}} a powder, and was highly pyrophoric. It could be pressed and sintered and stored in cans, but to be useful, it needed to be melted and cast. The Ames team found that molten uranium could be cast in a graphite container. Although graphite was known to react with uranium, this could be managed because the carbide formed only where the two touched.|$|E

5|$|The {{defendants}} did {{not appeal}} to the U.S. Supreme Court, and the time for filing such an appeal lapsed on March 22, 1976. After Judge Gignoux's decision became final, the Passamaquoddy and Penobscot gained federal recognition in 1976, thus becoming eligible for $5 million/year in housing, education, health care, and other social services from the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Further, the Interior Department's Solicitors Office <b>began</b> <b>looking</b> into whether and how it should proceed in United States v. Maine.|$|E
5|$|To {{fill the}} demand for other aircraft, {{especially}} smaller ones like the de Havilland Mosquito, the Air Ministry <b>began</b> <b>looking</b> at US manufacturers to supply the bombsight.

5|$|Wheelwright's stay in Exeter was short-lived, however, as the Bay Colony {{planted a}} {{settlement}} at Hampton, which included Wheelwright's purchase in its jurisdiction, and this put the banished Wheelwright in Massachusetts territory.

5|$|According to Quirky, Wink {{products}} were in 300,000 homes by 2015. In April 2015 Wink experienced a security problem that made {{many of its}} hubs go offline or break, forcing the company to issue a recall. The recall caused a several-month inventory backlog and subsequent shortage of the Wink hub. Due to financial difficulties, {{due in part to}} the recall, Quirky <b>began</b> <b>looking</b> for buyers to sell Wink to in 2015. That November, after Quirky went through bankruptcy proceedings, it sold Wink for $15 million to Flextronics (now called Flex), to whom Quirky owed $18.7 million. Flex was Wink's primary supplier of firmware and hardware. Wink continues to operate as an independent subsidiary of Flex. As of 2016, 1.3 million devices are connected to Wink.|$|E
5|$|At Harwell, Pontecorvo {{continued}} {{to be involved in}} reactor design projects. As a member of the Power Steering Committee (PSC), he was involved in discussions of the production and use of fissile materials, and of the materials used in construction of reactors. In 1949, other Via Panisperna boys, particularly Emilio Segrè, began to press their claim over patents relating to the behaviour of slow neutrons, which were at the heart of nuclear reactor—and nuclear weapon—design. The American Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) therefore <b>began</b> <b>looking</b> into their backgrounds. It noted, from its 1943 Manhattan Project files, that Pontecorvo's siblings Guiliana, Laura and Gillo were communists, and that Pontecorvo and Marianne were probably communists too, and reported this to MI5 in Britain, and MI6's Kim Philby in Washington, D.C.|$|E
