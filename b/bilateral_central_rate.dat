40|$|Empirical {{evidence}} about the behaviour of the exchange rates {{in terms of the}} US Dollar (USD) has shown different regularities (autocorrelation, daily seasonality, heteroscedasticicity, long memory). In this sense, we are interested in analysing the regularities that {{can be found in the}} behaviour of the European currencies in terms of Deutsche Mark (DEM) specifically those related to the mean because they could lead to the design of potentially exploitable strategies. The hypothesis is that the existence of a monetary system, which operates with bands around the <b>bilateral</b> <b>central</b> <b>rate,</b> can have an important influence on the behaviour of the exchange rates. Thus daily prices of four foreign currencies (French Franc (FRF), British Pound (GBP), Italian Lira (ITL) and Spanish Peseta (ESP)) are analysed over the period from 1 January 1976 to 31 December 1993. The results have confirmed a previous hypothesis. ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{report a}} case of <b>bilateral</b> <b>central</b> retinal artery {{occlusion}} with both anterior and posterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Observations: A 65 -year-old Caucasian woman presented with acute respiratory distress syndrome and septic shock. After treatment with vasopressors and prolonged prone positioning, she was noted to be bilaterally completely blind on hospitalization day 12. Evaluation revealed evidence of <b>bilateral</b> <b>central</b> retinal artery occlusion and bilateral ischemic optic neuropathy. Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits demonstrated severe restricted diffusion of both optic nerves consistent with ischemia. Both central retinal artery occlusion and ischemic optic neuropathy {{have been reported in}} cases of severe hypotension, blood loss, and prone positioning, most often postoperatively after spinal surgery. Conclusions and importance: To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of <b>bilateral</b> <b>central</b> retinal artery occlusion with both anterior and posterior ischemic optic neuropathy, presumed due to the combination of severe systemic hypotension, hypoxemia due to the respiratory distress syndrome, and prolonged prone positioning...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Ipsilateral central {{compartment}} node dissection {{has been}} proposed to reduce the morbidity of prophylactic <b>bilateral</b> <b>central</b> compartment node dissection in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), but it carries the risk of contralateral metastases being overlooked in approximately 25 % of patients. We aimed to verify if frozen section examination (FSE) can identify patients who could benefit from <b>bilateral</b> <b>central</b> compartment node dissection. Methods: All the consenting patients with clinically unifocal PTC, without any preoperative evidence of lymph node involvement, observed between September 2010 and September 2011 underwent total thyroidectomy plus <b>bilateral</b> <b>central</b> compartment node dissection. Ipsilateral central compartment nodes were sent for FSE. Results: Forty-eight patients were included. Mean number of removed nodes was 13. 2 ± 6. 8. Final histology showed lymph node metastases in 21 patients: ipsilateral in 15, bilateral in 6. FSE accurately predicted lymph node status in 43 patients (27 node negative, 16 node positive). Five node metastases were not detected at FSE: three were micrometastases (≤ 2 mm). Sensitivity, specificity and overall accuracy of FSE in definition of N status status were 80. 7, 100, and 90 %, respectively. Conclusions: FSE is accurate in predicting node metastases in clinically unifocal node negative PTC and {{can be useful in}} determining the extension of central compartment node dissection. False-negative results are reported mainly in case of micrometastases, which usually have limited clinical implications. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R

40|$|Background and Objectives：Papillary thyroid cancers (PTCs) often {{present as}} {{multifocal}} tumors. Whether multifocal tumors {{are associated with}} increased risk of recurrence and mortality is still the subject of controversy. The aim of current study was to indi-vidualize factors associated with multifocality of papillary thyroid cancer and determine the clinical significance of multifocal thy-roid cancer. Subjects and Method：We undertook a retrospective study of 403 patients treated between January, 2003 and June, 2007 for papillary thyroid carcinoma by total thyroidectomy and central compartment neck dissection (n= 403) with or without comprehensive lateral neck dissection. There were 342 women and 61 men whose mean age was 47. 3 years old. Following criteria were used to study the pattern of and factors related with multifocality：sex, age, extracapsular extension, central compartment lymph node metastasis, the involvement of lateral neck lymph node, AMES risk group, distant metastasis. Results：Of those fac-tors, sex (p= 0. 0481), central compartment lymph node metastasis (p= 0. 0007), the involvement of lateral neck lymph node (p= 0. 0001) were significantly related factors for multifocality of papillary thyroid cancer. Age, primary tumor size, AMES risk group were not significantly related with multifocality. <b>Bilateral</b> or contralateral <b>central</b> compartment lymph node metastasis oc-curred more frequently in multifocal PTCs (64. 0 %) than solitary PTCs (46. 9) (p= 0. 012). Conclusion：Our {{data suggest that the}} multifocal tumors in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma are associated with increased risk of <b>bilateral</b> <b>central</b> compartment and lateral cervical lymph node metastasis.
