40|$|Chemical {{interactions}} play {{a fundamental}} {{role in the}} ecology of marine foodwebs. Dimethyl sulfide (DMS) is a ubiquitous marine trace gas that acts as a bioactive compound by eliciting foraging behavior in a range of marine taxa including the copepod Temora longicornis. Production of DMS can rapidly increase following microzooplankton grazing on phytoplankton. Here, we investigated whether grazing-induced DMS elicits an increase in foraging behavior in the copepod Calanus helgolandicus. We developed a semi-automated method to quantify the effect of grazing-mediated DMS on the proportion of the time budget tethered females allocate towards slow swimming, typically associated with feeding. The pooled data showed no differences in the proportion of the 25 min time <b>budget</b> <b>allocated</b> <b>towards</b> slow swimming between high (23. 6 +/- 9. 74 %) and low (29. 1 +/- 18. 33 %) DMS treatments. However, there was a high degree of variability between behavioral responses of individual copepods. We discuss the need for more detailed species-specific studies of individual level responses of copepods to chemical signals at different spatial scales to improve our understanding of chemical interactions between copepods and their prey...|$|E
40|$|Early {{childhood}} caries (ECC) is {{a problematic}} disease {{that has been}} on the rise in young pre-school age children within the last decade. Children who have untreated dental disease early in life, are at increased risk of having poor oral health throughout their lifetimes. Approximately 70 % of dental disease is found in only 20 % of the nation?s high-risk children. Professional organizations and governing bodies have formed several initiatives in order to help lower the prevalence of ECC in children. One such initiative, early preventive dental visits, i. e. dental home, has proven to be successful; yet, the evidence is limited in documenting its effectiveness. First Dental Home (FDH) is the state of Texas Medicaid initiative to improve access to care for children. FDH was initiated to improve oral healthcare for children aged 6 months to 35 months of age by providing simple, consistent messages regarding proper oral healthcare to the parents/caregivers of the children. Despite the large fiscal <b>budget</b> <b>allocated</b> <b>towards</b> the success of FDH, no studies regarding the program?s effectiveness have been published to date. This study aimed {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the FDH by comparing the knowledge, practice and opinions of participating vs. non-participating parents regarding their young children. A 29 -question survey was given to mostly low-income parents who visited qualifying Medicaid clinics in North Texas (Dallas/Fort Worth) and South Texas (Harlingen). A total of 165 parents completed the survey. Several significant results emerged between the knowledge and practices responses of the parents sampled. On the knowledge section, FDH parents responded correctly more often than the non-FDH parents when asked about the recommended amount of toothpaste recommended for toddlers (p= 0. 023). In addition, 79. 6 % of FDH parents vs. 21. 1 % of non-FDH parents knew that tap water is a potential source of fluoride (p< 0. 001). Regarding oral health practices, 80 % of FDH parents did not let their child go to sleep with anything such as a bottle, sippy cup or pacifier (p= 0. 01). Furthermore, FDH parents scored higher on the overall knowledge score (p< 0. 001) and practice score (p< 0. 001). Based on our preliminary findings, FDH visits are having a positive impact on parents by not only increasing their oral healthcare knowledge, but also helping them implement what they have learned...|$|E
40|$|Nonprofit institutions, sans a large <b>budget</b> <b>allocated</b> <b>towards</b> design, {{publications}} {{production and}} printing, {{suffer from a}} lack of effective print communications. Even within the classification of 2 ̆ 2 nonprofit, 2 ̆ 2 a distinction can be made between successful groups and struggling ones. To further compound the matter, nonprofit groups, beyond just a deficit of funds, lack a graphic artist 2 ̆ 7 s understanding of how to assemble, produce and intelligently purchase print communications. It is no wonder then, that the struggling nonprofit group finds itself caught in a frustrating cycle. They need, desperately, to get their word out in order to raise funds; yet they lack the resources to produce the printed vehicles for that message. A cavernous gap exists between the quality of printed matter produced by successful institutions versus struggling ones. Information, in a consolidated, easy-to-use form, can help to bridge that gap. The proposed information a guidebook, entitled, 2 ̆ 2 A Nonprofit 2 ̆ 7 s Guide to Internally-Planned, Successful, Print Communications. 2 ̆ 2 This guidebook, based on an investigation into the print needs and communications objectives of nonprofit groups, will serve to educate and inform the layperson in the methods and techniques used in contemporary graphic arts publishing. Before actually writing the guidebook, a survey of nonprofit groups (both 2 ̆ 2 struggling 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 successful 2 ̆ 2) was executed for the following purposes: To validate the belief that nonprofits were starved for real-world, low-cost, tight-budget, print-communications assistance. To determine the baseline of understanding in graphic arts possessed by nonprofit groups whether they struggled for funds and donations or not. To assess the needs and objectives of nonprofits in the struggle to promote their mission through the medium of print. A local, struggling nonprofit sponsor was chosen to work with. The New York Branch of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children were the focus of this research and the 2 ̆ 2 home office 2 ̆ 2 for the guidebook 2 ̆ 7 s investigations. In addition, the author provided specific, technical, communications assistance to advance the NCMEC 2 ̆ 7 s promotional endeavors through print. Beginning with an overview into the importance of effective print communication in today 2 ̆ 7 s visually-competitive world, the guidebook stresses the benefits of implementing a well-constructed print communications program. Often taken for granted in the commercial world, print communications has an assumed, predictable role in the crucial areas of: marketing, advertising and public relations. Not so for the nonprofit. For a great many, print communications is a misunderstood, some times frightening, burden to be undertaken almost as a last resort. To organizations without the capital, resources and expertise print in communications, demands of both budget and staff can be immense. Even to those nonprofit groups with certain in-bouse communication capabilities, the effort is sometimes viewed as a necessary evil. Clearly, an understanding of print communication 2 ̆ 7 s fundamentals is required before a struggling nonprofit could initiate an effective print communications pro gram- Subsequent chapters provide a crash-course in the areas of: typography, design, printing and reproduction, basic color, graphics, electronic publishing and paper and finishing options. Commercially, there are numerous desktop publishing books and pre-designed layout guides available. However, that 2 ̆ 7 s simply not enough information when your responsibilities go beyond basic 2 ̆ 2 personal computing. 2 ̆ 2 Nonprofit communications officers have donors to solicit, volunteers to entice and a constituency to appease. There is a certain level of professionalism required of promotional pieces that attempt to solicit donations. The expectations of a print vehicle that asks for another 2 ̆ 7 s time and or money is very different than what is presumed of a corporate entity 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 office newsletter, 2 ̆ 2 for instance. Aside {{from the fact that the}} aforementioned commercial books generally ignore the needs and limitations of nonprofits, what good is such information if there is no foundation in the fundamentals of reproduction? A printed piece is doomed for failure if it is not assembled well. As we know type, design, and color basics (just for starters), must be under stood if a printed piece is to stand any chance of holding the attention of a modem, visually-literate audience. Pre-fabricated, 2 ̆ 2 do-it-yourself layouts are simply insufficient to accomplish this. Nonprofits need more information, and they need it in an accurate, affordable medium. To further compound the issue, nonprofit communications officers themselves are often responsible for the bulk of print communications duties. They do not have the luxury of sending material out-of-house to be typeset, designed and assembled. Rather, the obligation to produce print communications often falls entirely on their shoulders. In the typical nonprofit organization, there is no 2 ̆ 2 advertising, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 marketing 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 creative services 2 ̆ 2 departments to turn to for assistance. Within A Nonprofit 2 ̆ 7 s Guide to Internally-Planned, Successful Print Communications, through step-by-step instructions and a 2 ̆ 2 real-world 2 ̆ 2 perspective, the 2 ̆ 2 secrets 2 ̆ 2 of successful print communications are revealed. However, this research does not claim to be a panacea, limitations and realities shall be addressed up front. Many are the obstacles and challenges a typical nonprofit agency faces in the attempt to promote its mission. This guidebook honestly acknowledges those limitations and seeks solutions, alternatives and 2 ̆ 2 work-arounds 2 ̆ 2 unlike any commercial offering. The heart of the guidebook is a step-by-step instructional 2 ̆ 2 how-to 2 ̆ 2 guide for the nonprofit to pro duce the specific printed vehicles intended to deliver their message. Examples and illustrations on the professional preparation of such materials as: newsletters, fundraising brochures, print advertisements, etc., guide the reader into the previously uncharted wilds of the production of print communications. Concluding the guidebook is a section on 2 ̆ 2 the business 2 ̆ 2 of nonprofits. Tough times lie ahead for the nation 2 ̆ 7 s nonprofit groups. Thoughts, concerns and advice on the 2 ̆ 2 nonprofit struggle 2 ̆ 2 are offered, as well as advice on how to 2 ̆ 2 fight back 2 ̆ 2 against cutbacks, trickling philanthropy and rising competition. Next, an open forum of comments from real nonprofit professionals is offered. As a marshalling of common concerns, the 2 ̆ 2 Q and A 2 ̆ 2 dialogue attempts to provide a sense of solidarity for the nonprofit. The 2 ̆ 2 we 2 ̆ 7 re all in this together 2 ̆ 2 message offers a positive beacon in an otherwise murky, uncertain atmosphere. It serves to underscore the struggle and challenge one faces in promoting uphill, formidable missions or causes. The unmistakable determination echoing in the voices from this forum also serves to provide a source of inspiration. Finally, alternative methods of general financing (co-sponsoring, donations) are offered to instruct the nonprofit on how to fund the graphic reproduction of their newly-planned communications material. (A proliferation of other, specific 2 ̆ 2 moneysaving ideas 2 ̆ 2 and tips are to be found embedded throughout the text.) To validate the fact that the guidebook will actually help nonprofits to reach better print communications, several sources were called upon to gauge the guide book 2 ̆ 7 s effectiveness and discuss its usefulness and potential. Finally, through both traditional, 2 ̆ 2 grass roots 2 ̆ 2 channels and modern reproduction, the guidebook is being made available to interested nonprofit groups so that they may access the information and put it to use in their advertising, promotions, and print communications campaigns...|$|E

30|$|In {{the next}} section, a Strengths-Weaknesses {{analysis}} of logistics solutions tailored for being {{applied in the}} urban retail context is developed. The section introduces the measures, the external costs of which are calculated in section 4 under the methodological approach. The external costs are calculated per urban policy and per urban logistics concept and the results feed the sustainability analysis {{that takes place in}} the subsequent chapters, shaping the indicator-based sustainability evaluation framework. The reason external costs are used as the core of our sustainability framework is because the logistics operations create a range of externalities causing impacts mainly on society (infrastructure damage, environmental pollution, mobility obstacles etc.) which urge people and, principally, authorities to <b>allocate</b> <b>budget</b> <b>towards</b> mitigating them. Eventually, the impacts of external costs are economic, environmental and overall social.|$|R
