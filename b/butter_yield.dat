50|$|The {{development}} of the yearly butter record is of more than passing interest. In 1813, Mr. Caleb Oakes, of Danvers, Mass., purchased a cow then five years old, of unknown stock, that in 1814 made 300 pounds of butter, in 1815 over 400 pounds, and in 1816, between May 15 and December 20. 484 pounds 4 ounces of butter. The largest amount made in one week was 19 pounds. The Oakes cow became famous and was given the prize of the Massachusetts State Agricultural Society in 1816. For years the yield of the Oakes cow was unsurpassed, {{so far as the}} public is aware. Finally the Jersey cow Eurotas made a sensation and excelled all previous records, by producing 778 pounds 1 ounce of butter in a year. This set the Jersey world agog, and Mary Ann of St. Lambert went into a year's test to break the record of Eurotas, which she did by producing 867 pounds 14¾ ounces of butter in a year. Then a challenge cup was offered to the Jersey who would excel Mary Ann in the <b>butter</b> <b>yield,</b> and Landseer's Fancy took possession of this, after demonstrating that she could make 936 pounds 14¾ ounces of butter to Mary Ann's 867 pounds 14¾ ounces. But after this, Eurotissima made 945 pounds 9 ounces and took the cup; then Bisson's Belle relieved her of it by making 1,028 pounds 15 ounces, and finally, in 1892, Signal's Lily Flagg, by producing 1,047 pounds ¾ ounce of butter in a year, led this list of celebrated Jerseys. But for greatest total <b>butter</b> <b>yield</b> in a year, it is said that the Jersey is not the champion, for the Holstein-Friesian cow Pauline Paul, in 1890 and 1891, in 365 days, produced 18,669 pounds 9 ounces of milk under test, from which was made 1,153 pounds 15¾ ounces of butter, worked and salted, one ounce to the pound.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Pocket gophers (Geomyidae) have an {{extensive}} impact on {{both natural and}} agricultural systems. Trapping is a technique often used to sample and manage these populations. The identification of an attractant that increases capture rates of pocket gophers would greatly assist researchers and pest management professionals alike. Therefore, we tested the attractiveness of four attractants (peanut butter, anise, grapefruit attractant, and carrot) plus a control (no attractant) using uncovered and covered trap sets to determine what impact they have on visitation and capture rates of pocket gophers. We also determined how the impact of cover status and attractants differ across varying weights and gender of pocket gophers. We found no direct effect of any attractant on visitation and capture rates of pocket gophers, nor on the gender of captured individuals. However, when no attractant was used, the number of pocket gophers captured per 100 trap nights was greater when trap sets were uncovered vs. when covered, and capture rates were generally high and consistent when using peanut butter as an attractant. Additionally, we noted that covered trap sets that were baited with peanut <b>butter</b> <b>yielded</b> heavier pocket gopher captures than uncovered trap sets using this same attractant. This is key, given the difficulty associated with capturing older, more experienced individuals. Combined with data from a previous investigation, this {{suggests that there is}} no advantage to using any attractant when utilizing uncovered trap sets, but there is likely some benefit to using peanut butter in covered trap sets [Current Zoology 60 () : –, 2014]...|$|R

It is impossible to recover cocoa butter with GAME at 100 °C when nibs with moisture contents higher than 5. 5 wt. % are used due to the extrusion of the cocoa solids through the filter medium. Similar yields were obtained when cocoa liquor and cocoa nibs were used in GAME experiments at the same conditions. Lastly it is shown that higher yields can be achieved when multi-stage GAME is used instead of single stage GAME. An absolute increase in cocoa <b>butter</b> <b>yield</b> of 7 – 10 % was achieved when two-stage GAME was used instead of single stage GAME. - Industrial relevance - Cocoa butter is used as an ingredient in a number of popular foodstuffs, and continuous efforts are made by industry to improve the current cocoa butter recovery processes. Hydraulic pressing is the most frequently used process for producing high quality cocoa butter from cocoa nibs. In GAME the cocoa nibs are saturated with supercritical carbon dioxide prior to expression. GAME offers increased cocoa butter yields compared to conventional expression of cocoa nibs. The GAME process has been patented for screw presses, but no information is available on the effect different process parameters have on the performance of GAME in hydraulic presses.

40|$|Pentadesma {{butter is}} still {{traditionally}} extracted starting from pretreated almonds by traditional techniques of heating. The {{aim of this}} work was to study {{the effect of the}} almonds post-harvest pretreatments on the physicochemical characteristics, the extraction yield {{and the quality of the}} Pentadesma butter. In addition, the effect of the various unit operations of the extraction technology on the quality of the extracted butter from pretreated almonds was studied. According to the same traditional process of extraction, two various butters of Pentadesma were extracted starting from almonds differing only by the post-harvest pretreatment applied (roasting or boiling). The color, the aspect and the breaking strength of the almonds were different. The <b>butter</b> extraction <b>yield</b> varied according to the pretreatment applied. The best yields (33. 5 _ 4. 1 %) were obtained from boiled almonds, but their transformation was more difficult than that of roasted. The analysis of the samples at different stages of the transformation allowed the appreciation of the effect of the almonds pretreatments on the acidity and the peroxide value variations at each unit operation of the butter extraction. The fatty acid composition and the tocopherol content of the two extracted butters varied with the almonds pretreatments. The roasted almonds provided a richer butter in stearic acid, a and d-tocopherols and less rich in oleic acid than that provided by the boiled almonds. The pretreatments allowed a total loss of the contained linolenic acid, b and dtocopherols in the butters and decreased the oleic acid and a- tocopherol contents. The physico-chemical characteristics of the Pentadesma butter varied according to the almonds pretreatments. Thus, it would be interesting to make a reasoned choice of the most suitable post-harvest pretreatment in order to obtain a butter with a good quality and an acceptable extraction yield.

40|$|In this study, the {{churning}} efficiency of milk sample for buttermaking from camel milk by blending it with goat milk and microbiological quality of butter made at different blending levels were assessed. The experiment {{was laid out}} in completely randomized design with five treatments: T 1 (100 % camel milk), T 2 (75 % camel and 25 % goat milk), T 3 (50 % camel and 50 % goat milk), T 4 (25 % camel and 75 % goat milk) and T 5 (100 % goat milk). The churning efficiency and microbiological quality of the milk and butter samples were analyzed following standard procedures. The fermentation time (11. 33 days), churning time (121. 7 min) and churning temperature (28 °C) of T 1 were significantly (P < 0. 001) higher than the other milk samples. T 1 had significantly (P < 0. 001) lower churning pH (4. 13) and <b>butter</b> <b>yield</b> (49. 3 g/L) than the other samples. T 3 and T 4 had significantly (P < 0. 001) higher <b>butter</b> <b>yield</b> than the other milk samples. The fermentation time, churning time and churning temperature of T 5 were significantly (P < 0. 001) lower than the rest and T 5 required significantly (P < 0. 001) higher churning pH than the other milk samples. The coliform count (CC), enterobacteriaceae count (EBC), lipolytic bacteria count (LBC) and {{yeast and mould count}} (YMC) of T 1 was significantly (P < 0. 001) higher than the other butter samples. The CC, EC and total bacteria count (TBC) of T 5 was significantly (P < 0. 001) higher than T 2, T 3 and T 4 and it had significantly (P < 0. 001) lower TBC than the others.

Although butter can be made from pure camel milk, it took longer churning time and fermentation time. Thus, research is needed in order to reduce {{the churning}} time, improve the yield of butter and microbial quality made from pure and blended camel milk by manipulating the operating parameters viz., pH of the milk, churning temperature, method of churning and volume of milk in the churn...|$|E

The maximum <b>butter</b> <b>yield</b> is obtained with kernels content 10 to 15 % of residual water. The cutting up of kernels makes easier the vaporizing of water but, also increases acidity and reduces contents of unsaponifiable, triterpenic alcohols and sterols successive in an increase of interface between enzymes and molecules.

Mouldiness in kernels <b>Butter</b> <b>Yield</b> (BY) and Free Fatty Acid (FFA) were evaluated as standard quality parameters. All kernels irrespective of the duration of par-boiling attained the desired 7 - 7. 5 % moisture content in 7 days when solar dried while the mat and floor took 11 and 14 days to dry, respectively. Parboiled kernels longitudinally cut, indicated very mouldy kernels from the floor dried kernels resulting in {{significantly higher levels of}} FFA in the butter compared to those from mat and solar dried kernels. The moulds isolated and identified from the parboiled kernels were Aspergillus tamari, Aspergillus wentii, Aspergillus terreus, Aspergillus versicolor, Aspergillus flavus, Fusarium avenaceum, Rhizopus stolonifer, Rhizoctonia and Penicillium species. Non parboiled kernels, irrespective of the drying method had no mouldy nuts but high FFA (19. 10 - 19. 99 %). Both parboiling duration and drying method significantly affected BY and FFA levels. Fruit storage before depulping negatively affected the quality of the resulting butter. Drying method had a significant effect on the shea kernel and butter quality.

40|$|The current {{methods used}} to recover high quality oil from {{oilseeds}} have low yields (mechanical expression, aqueous extraction), {{require the use of}} toxic chemicals and rigorous purification processes that can reduce the quality of the oil (solvent extraction with hexane) or are unsuitable for the recovery of commodity oils due to the low solubility of plant oils in environmentally benign solvents (supercritical extraction with CO 2). Gas assisted mechanical expression (GAME) utilises the much higher solubility of supercritical CO 2 in the oil to enhance the extraction yields of mechanical expression. GAME experiments with cocoa nibs were performed at 40 – 100 °C, CO 2 pressures of 0 – 20 MPa and effective mechanical pressures of 20 – 50 MPa. The maximum yield with conventional expression (71. 8 %) was obtained at a mechanical pressure of 50 MPa and a temperature of 100 °C. It is shown that GAME has a substantially higher yield than conventional mechanical expression for the recovery of cocoa butter from cocoa nibs, with the highest yield (87. 1 %) obtained at 100 °C, a CO 2 pressure of 10 MPa and an effective mechanical pressure of 50 MPa. The cocoa <b>butter</b> <b>yield</b> increases with increasing CO 2 pressure until 10 MPa but remains almost constant for higher CO 2 pressures. In contrast to conventional expression GAME also allows the recovery of cocoa butter from cocoa nibs at temperatures below the melting point of pure cocoa butter. The cocoa butter produced with GAME was found to be unfractionated and is therefore of the same quality as mechanically expressed cocoa butter. Experiments with linseed and sesame seed show that GAME performed at 40 °C with 10 MPa CO 2 also results in an increased yield of oil (71. 8 – 83. 8 % for linseed, 74. 3 – 80. 2 % for sesame seed) when compared to the yield obtained with conventional mechanical expression performed at 40 °C (38. 5 – 45. 7 % for linseed, 60. 1 – 65. 6 % for sesame seed). From these results it is concluded that GAME offers a promising process for the recovery of high-quality vegetable oils at high yields...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{shea tree}} is an {{endogenous}} and multipurpose tree from the Savanah zone of Africa, mostly used for its fruits and the fat extracted from its kernels, {{commonly known as}} shea butter. The butter is used for cooking and medicinal purposes by local populations, and in cosmetic products {{as well as a}} cocoa butter substitute in chocolate in others areas of Africa and at the international level. The butter is generally extracted by traditional methods, which vary throughout the production zones but involve some common processing operations viz. boiling of the fresh nuts, sun drying, shelling, crushing, roasting, milling, churning, and heating. This thesis investigated the influence of traditional processing of shea on quality attributes of shea kernels and butter. The results showed that 2 mains techniques (differing in the heat treatment applied to the fresh nuts) are used to process shea fruits after their collection: the boiling followed by sun drying technique and the smoking technique. Boiled and sundried kernels contained a higher fat content (48 % dw) and yielded more butter (30 % of kernel mass) than smoked kernels that had a fat content of 39 % dw. The butter extracted from the boiled kernels had a better quality than the butter from smoked kernels with respect to the unsaponifiable fraction (7 %), tocopherol compounds (125 mg/g), peroxide value (8 meq O 2 /kg), and FFA (2 %). Some processing operations, namely the storage of fresh nuts as related to their boiling time and the roasting of kernels, were optimized using the response surface method to design the experiments. The conditions to obtain an optimal quality of kernels are to store the nuts for 3 days and boil them for 28 ± 3 min. Subsequently, optimal roasting conditions for kernels were found to be 15 min at 171 ºC, which resulted in kernels with a fat content of 49 % dw, a <b>butter</b> <b>yield</b> of 32 %, and butter with a FFA of 1. 2 %. The results also revealed that shea butter extracted from roasted kernels contained more volatile compounds (58) than that from unroasted kernels (27). Additionally, storage temperature and storage duration significantly affected some quality characteristics of shea butter, whereas the influence of local packaging materials was less pronounced Shea processors are advised to process shea fruits by integrating the optimal conditions of storage of fresh nuts, boiling and roasting found in this research, then pack the butter in clean and opaque plastic and store it in a relatively cool area to maintain the quality of the product during prolonged storage periods. Areas for future research were identified for further improvements of local shea processing.  ...|$|E
