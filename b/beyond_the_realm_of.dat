5|$|Ti Noel {{has been}} {{considered}} a product of creolization, combining the African magical perspective of Macandal with the Catholic realism of Henri Christophe. A key aspect {{of the novel is}} that the main character is of interest not because of his skin colour, but rather for his human attributes that allow universal reflection <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> race. In this sense, magic realism is a necessary tool of expression and the technique serves to confront the novel's hero, better develop his purpose as a man, and advance a simultaneously profound and straightforward understanding of the human experience.|$|E

25|$|Social {{systems have}} {{patterns}} of social relation that change over time; {{the changing nature}} of space and time determines the interaction of social relations and therefore structure. Hitherto, social structures or models were either taken to be <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> human control—the positivistic approach—or posit that action creates them—the interpretivist approach. The duality of structure emphasizes that they are different sides to the same central question of how social order is created.|$|E

25|$|Some {{ethnic groups}} {{complain}} over {{the distribution of}} the revenue generated by oil resources with claims that the central government is failing to invest profits from the oil industry in employment generation, post-war reconstruction and welfare projects. Low human development indicators among local Khuzestanis are contrasted with the wealth generation of the local oil industry. Minority rights are frequently identified with strategic concerns, with ethnic unrest perceived by the Iranian government as being generated by foreign governments to undermine the country's oil industry and its internal stability. The politics of Khuzestan therefore have international significance and go <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> electoral politics.|$|E
25|$|Star {{has been}} {{particularly}} influential {{in the area of}} information infrastructure, frequently noting that although the study of infrastructure often entails examining things that seem commonplace, those everyday items have widespread consequences for humans and human interaction. Star has worked to develop ways of understanding how people communicate about infrastructure, and has helped develop research methods aimed to examine the role infrastructure plays in mediated human activities. But her work extends far <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> information infrastructure. Star's interest in the connection between technology and lived experience led her to work in a wide array of disciplines, including library sciences, computer sciences, neuroscience, philosophy and women's studies.|$|E
25|$|Carnivorous {{plants have}} long {{been the subject of}} popular {{interest}} and exposition, much of it highly inaccurate. Fictional plants have been featured in a number of books, movies, television series, and video games. Typically, these fictional depictions include exaggerated characteristics, such as enormous size or possession of abilities <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> reality, and {{can be viewed as a}} kind of artistic license. Two of the most famous examples of fictional carnivorous plants in popular culture are the 1960s black comedy The Little Shop of Horrors and the triffids of John Wyndham's The Day of the Triffids. Other movies, such as The Hellstrom Chronicle (1971), and television series utilize accurate depictions of carnivorous plants for cinematic purposes.|$|E

25|$|The {{institutionalization of}} science {{occurred}} throughout the 18th century. In 1731, Benjamin Franklin established the Library Company of Philadelphia, the first library {{owned by a}} group of public citizens, which quickly expanded <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> books and became a center of scientific experiment, and which hosted public exhibitions of scientific experiments. Benjamin Franklin invested a town in Massachusetts with a collection of books that the town voted to make available to all free of charge, forming the first Public Library. Academie de Chirurgia (Paris) published Memoires pour les Chirurgiens, generally considered to be the first medical journal, in 1736. The American Philosophical Society, patterned on the Royal Society (London), was founded in Philadelphia in 1743. As numerous other scientific journals and societies were founded, Alois Senefelder developed the concept of lithography for use in mass printing work in Germany in 1796.|$|E
25|$|Spencer's {{interest}} in psychology {{derived from a}} more fundamental concern which was to establish the universality of natural law. In common with others of his generation, including the members of Chapman's salon, he was possessed {{with the idea of}} demonstrating {{that it was possible to}} show that everything in the universe – including human culture, language, and morality – could be explained by laws of universal validity. This was in contrast to the views of many theologians of the time who insisted that some parts of creation, in particular the human soul, were <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> scientific investigation. Comte's Système de Philosophie Positive had been written with the ambition of demonstrating the universality of natural law, and Spencer was to follow Comte in the scale of his ambition. However, Spencer differed from Comte in believing it was possible to discover a single law of universal application which he identified with progressive development and was to call the principle of evolution.|$|E
25|$|However, when {{power output}} from the nuclear {{reaction}} increases rapidly, {{it may take}} longer for the water to heat up and boil than it does for the voids to cause the nuclear reactions to decrease. In such an event, reactor power can grow rapidly without any negative feedback from the expansion or boiling of the water, {{even if it is}} in a channel just 1cm away. Dramatic heating will occur to the nuclear fuel, leading to melting and vaporization of the metals within the core. Rapid expansion, increases in pressure, and failure of core components may lead to the destruction of the nuclear reactor, {{as was the case with}} SL-1. As the energy of expansion and heat travel from the nuclear fuel to the water and the vessel, it becomes likely that the nuclear reaction will shut down, either from the lack of sufficient moderator or from the fuel expanding <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> a critical mass. In the post-accident analysis of SL-1, scientists determined that the two shutdown mechanisms were almost equally matched (see below).|$|E

Whereas Indian classical is linear and uses just one scale (rāga) to improvise within a composition, jazz has a much broader palette for musical improvisation, where multiple scales {{can be used to}} improvise through complex harmonies. Indian classical music, however, has some of the world's most complex rhythm structures and subtle quarter tones that takes its sound far <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>realms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> twelve tone scale.|$|R

500|$|Stephen Brockmann argues {{the fact}} that Caligari was filmed entirely in a studio enhances the madness portrayed by the film's visuals because [...] "there is no access to a natural world <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> the {{tortured}} human psyche". The sets occasionally feature circular images that reflect {{the chaos of the}} film, presenting patterns of movement that seem to be going nowhere, such as the merry-go-round at the fair, moving at a titled angle that makes it appear at risk of collapsing. Other elements of the film convey the same visual motifs as the sets, including the costumes and make-up design for Dr. Caligari and Cesare, both of which are highly exaggerated and grotesque. Even the hair of the characters is an Expressionistic design element, especially Cesare's black, spiky, jagged locks. They are the only two characters in the film with Expressionistic make-up and costumes, making them appear as if they {{are the only ones who}} truly belong in this distorted world. Despite their apparent normalcy, however, Francis and the other characters never appear disturbed by the madness around them reflected in the sets; they instead react as if they are parts of a normal background.|$|E
500|$|Despite the song's {{commercial}} success, [...] "We Are the World" [...] received {{mixed reviews}} from journalists, music critics {{and the public}} following its release. American journalist Greil Marcus felt that the song sounded like a Pepsi jingle. He wrote, [...] "... the constant repetition of 'There's a choice we're making' conflates with Pepsi's trademarked 'The choice of a new generation' in a way that, {{on the part of}} Pepsi-contracted song writers Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie, is certainly not intentional, and even more certainly <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>realm</b> <b>of</b> serendipity." [...] Marcus added, [...] "In the realm of contextualization, 'We Are the World' says less about Ethiopia than it does about Pepsi—and the true result will likely be less that certain Ethiopian individuals will live, or anyway live a bit longer than they otherwise would have, than that Pepsi will get the catch phrase of its advertising campaign sung for free by Ray Charles, Stevie Wonder, Bruce Springsteen, and all the rest." [...] Author Reebee Garofalo agreed, and expressed the opinion that the line [...] "We're saving our own lives" [...] was a [...] "distasteful element of self-indulgence". He asserted that the artists of USA for Africa were proclaiming [...] "their own salvation for singing about an issue they will never experience on behalf of a people most of them will never encounter".|$|E
