500|$|Hasbro and Hub Network (prior to its {{rebranding}} as Discovery Family) {{have also}} sought to market to bronies.

[...] A company spokeswoman said that bronies are [...] "a small group of My Little Pony fans who don't necessarily fit what one might expect to be the brand's target audience", while its core audience in the older market is predominantly females. Despite the bronies being an unusual and unexpected audience, Hasbro and Hub Network chose to [...] "salute and embrace all the viewers who have embraced our brand", according to Margaret Loesch, CEO of Hub Network and former executive producer of the original My Little Pony animated series. Hasbro has allowed the fandom to be an organic movement leading to its growth and success, according to Stephen Davis, head of Hasbro Studios.|$|E
500|$|Will & Grace creators and {{executive}} producers David Kohan and Max Mutchnick {{were in favor}} of doing a live episode; [...] "We love the idea of a live episode because we get to show the audience of Will & Grace what we've known from day one — we work with the best cast in network television," [...] said Mutchnick. He noted that the live element would allow the writers to make changes in the script right up until the airing of the episode. Kevin Reilly, who at the time served as NBC Entertainment President, said the [...] "challenging live platform launch" [...] for Will & Grace would be a good way for the show to inaugurate its final season. In discussion of the episode, Burrows, the director of all Will & Grace episodes, commented: [...] "This will be like the classic golden era of television that I was weaned on, where the audience sees everything. Directing a live broadcast will be a first for me, and as long as I have <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>business,</b> there are very few firsts." ...|$|E

500|$|Before the album's release, in December 2012, Cudi {{dedicated}} Indicud to {{the late}} Ben Breedlove and all his fans who died, continuing: [...] "My journey shall continue in your honor. Never forgotten." [...] The dedication was ultimately included in the album's liner notes. The album is upbeat and optimistic, very much unlike his previous studio album [...] (2010), which was considered darkly erratic. The positive vibe stems from Cudi's desire to always change and reinvent: [...] "I always try to push myself {{to the next level}} with everything I do. Since I've <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>business,</b> critics have known that about me. When I started working on Indicud, I just wanted to bring more energy into my sound. Most of my old music was driven towards relaxed, chilled out smoke music. And that was my goal first coming in. Now it's like, 'What’s a side of me that people haven’t seen?' The only time people have seen me on up-tempos is on remixes or some shit. So I just wanted to take the energy to the next level. That ultimately inspired the subject matter. It was a chain reaction. With the up-tempos came more positive lyrics. It just brightened up the whole shit." ...|$|E
500|$|That same year, Cooper {{made two}} films with {{director}} and good friend Howard Hawks. In the biographical film Sergeant York, Cooper portrays war hero Alvin C. York, {{one of the}} most decorated American soldiers in World War I. The film chronicles York's early backwoods days in Tennessee, his religious conversion and subsequent piety, his stand as a conscientious objector, and finally his heroic actions at the Battle of the Argonne Forest, which earned him the Medal of Honor. Initially, Cooper was nervous and uncertain about playing a living hero, so he traveled to Tennessee to visit York at his home, and the two quiet men established an immediate rapport and discovered they had much in common. Inspired by York's encouragement, Cooper delivered a performance that Howard Barnes of the New York Herald Tribune called [...] "one of extraordinary conviction and versatility", and that Archer Winston of the New York Post called [...] "one of his best". After the film's release, Cooper was awarded the Distinguished Citizenship Medal by the Veterans of Foreign Wars for his [...] "powerful contribution to the promotion of patriotism and loyalty". York admired Cooper's performance and helped promote the film for Warner Bros. Sergeant York became the top-grossing film of the year and was nominated for eleven Academy Awards. Accepting his first Academy Award for Best Actor from his friend James Stewart, Cooper said, [...] "It was Sergeant Alvin York who won this award. Shucks, I've <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>business</b> sixteen years and sometimes dreamed I might get one of these. That's all I can say ... Funny when I was dreaming I always made a better speech." ...|$|E

The song officially impacted the radios on January 19, 2010.

2500|$|Porter {{began his}} {{engineering}} career in 1954 at WLAC-TV in Nashville, Tennessee, where {{he wished to}} be a cameraman—nobody wanted to mix sound, though, and that job was assigned to him, {{the guy with the}} least seniority. He mixed up to four microphones for television broadcast for $92 per week, equivalent to $ today. At nearby RCA Records in 1959, the chief engineer was transferred after angering Chet Atkins, and Porter applied for the position. He was told by an RCA executive from New York that the job would ruin his marriage, but Porter said [...] "I can handle that"—he was hired at $148 per week, and given two weeks to learn all the equipment and how to mix up to 12 microphones for music recordings. Shortly after starting with RCA on March 31, 1959, Porter mixed the single [...] "Lonesome Old House" [...] for Don Gibson; it was a crossover success in both the country music and the pop music charts, and Porter began to be requested by name. In June 1959, he mixed [...] "The Three Bells" [...] for the Browns, with Atkins producing and Anita Kerr arranging. While editing the master to be sent to New York for pressing, Porter accidentally hit the wrong controls on the tape recorder and stretched the tape {{at the beginning of the}} song, distorting the pitch. Without telling anyone, he spliced a different take with a good intro onto the beginning, and sent that version instead. Four decades later, Porter recalled his quick fix: [...] "this was a need-to-know situation and I figured nobody needed to know. I had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>business</b> three months or something like that. You're not a good engineer until you destroy a master and hopefully live to talk about it." [...] In July, the song went to number one on the U.S. country and pop charts, and Porter's reputation rose.|$|E
