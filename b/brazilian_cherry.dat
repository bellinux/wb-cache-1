40|$|Supercritical {{carbon dioxide}} (SC-CO(2)) extractions of <b>Brazilian</b> <b>cherry</b> (Eugenia uniflora L.) {{were carried out}} under varied {{conditions}} of pressure and temperature, according to a central composite 2 (2) experimental design, {{in order to produce}} flavour-rich extracts. The composition of the extracts was evaluated by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The abundance of the extracted compounds was then related to sensory analysis results, assisted by principal component and factorial discriminant analysis (PCA and FDA, respectively). The identified sesquiterpenes and ketones were found to strongly contribute to the characteristic flavour of the <b>Brazilian</b> <b>cherry.</b> The extracts also contained a variety of other volatile compounds, and part of the fruit wax contained long-chain hydrocarbons that according to multivariate analysis, contributed to the yield of the extracts, but not the flavour. Volatile phenolic compounds, to which antioxidant properties are attributed, were also present in the extracts in high proportion, regardless of the extraction conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|This work {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} pressure and temperature on yield and characteristic flavour intensity of <b>Brazilian</b> <b>cherry</b> (Eugenia uniflora L) extracts obtained by supercritical CO(2) using response surface analysis, which is a simple and efficient method for first inquiries. A complete central composite 2 (2) factorial experimental design was applied using temperature (ranging from 40 to 60 degrees C) and pressure (from 150 to 250 bar) as independent variables. A second order model proved to be predictive (p 50 degrees C), Therefore, as far as <b>Brazilian</b> <b>cherry</b> is concerned, optimum conditions for achieving higher extract yield do not necessarily coincide to those for obtaining richer flavour intensity. Industrial relevance: Supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) is an emerging clean technology through which one may obtain extracts free from organic solvents. Extract yields from natural products for applications in food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries have been widely disseminated in the literature. Accordingly, two lines of research have industrial relevance, namely, (i) operational optimization studies for high SFE yields and (ii) investigation on important properties extracts are expected to present (so as to define their prospective industrial application). Specifically, this work studied the optimization of SFE process to obtain extracts from a tropical fruit showing high intensity of its characteristic flavour, aiming at promoting its application in natural aroma enrichment of processed foods.

40|$|The <b>Brazilian</b> <b>Cherry</b> (Eugenia uniflora L.) is {{a native}} species of Brazil species native to the {{southern}} of Brazil. The aerial part of the plant (leaves and fruits) contains essential oil high in sesquiterpenes, which {{is used in the}} cosmetics industry and popular medicine. Although it has great potential, information regarding the distillation of its essential oil is scarce. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the post-harvest treatments of the aerial part in order to improve the extraction of essential oil. The samples were collected from terminal branches of the same access of Eugenia uniflora L. belonging to the collection of aromatic and medicinal plants of the Center of Horticulture of the Agronomical Institute of Campinas, Sao Paulo State, Brazil, from May to June, 2005. The experiment was conducted in completely randomized blocks and a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial designs, with 3 replications, the factors being: two parts of the plant (leaves and branches), two methods of sample preparation (leaves and branches, whole or triturated) and two forms of the sample (fresh and frozen), totalizing eight treatments. The leaves were distilled in a modified Clevenger distiller for 3 hours. The frozen parts were kept for 7 days at - 10 oC before distillation. The highest concentration of essential oil is occurs in the leaves of <b>Brazilian</b> <b>Cherry,</b> with the twigs of the plant containing a small amount [...] The freezing of the leaves reduced the oil yield as compared to that by others treatments, and the trituration of the vegetal material raised the extracted amount of oil...|$|E
40|$|AbstractEssential oil (EO) of {{the leaves}} of Eugenia uniflora L. (<b>Brazilian</b> <b>cherry</b> tree) was {{evaluated}} for its antioxidant, antibacterial and antifungal properties. The acute toxicity of the EO administered by oral route was also evaluated in mice.

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the anti-quorum sensing {{activity}} of phenolic extracts from grumixama (Eugenia brasiliensis), also known as <b>Brazilian</b> <b>cherry,</b> in concentrations that did not interfere with bacterial growth. The pulp phenolic compounds were extracted by using solid phage extraction in a mini-collumn C 18 and quantified by spectrophotometry. The anti-quorum sensing activity was evaluated by testing the inhibition of violacein production in Chromobacterium violaceum and by evaluating the swarming motility in Aeromonas hydrophila and Serratia marcescens, both phenotypes regulated by quorum sensing. The phenolic extract strongly inhibited the production of violacein in C. violaceum, reducing its production in comparison with a control with no extract. No inhibition of growth was observed at the concentrations tested for quorum sensing inhibition. Confirming the quorum sensing inhibition phenotype, the extract was also able to inhibit swarming motility in S. marcescens and in A. hydrophila, although in the later the effect was marginal. Overall, these results indicate that phenolic extract from E. brasiliensis presents quorum sensing inhibitory activity most likely due to the presence of fruit phenolics which have been implicated as quorum sensing inhibitors in Gram negative bacteria...|$|E
40|$|Nine {{microsatellite}} loci {{for genetic}} analysis of three {{populations of the}} tropical tree Eugenia uniflora L. (pitanga or <b>Brazilian</b> <b>cherry)</b> from fragments of semideciduous forest were developed. We used the technique of building a (GA) (n) and (CA) (n) microsatellite-enriched library by capture with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. We assessed the polymorphism of seven microsatellites in 84 mature trees found in three areas (Ribeir (a) over tildeo Preto, Tambau and S (a) over tildeo Jose do Rio Pardo), highly impacted by the agricultural practices, in a large region among Pardo river and Mogi-Guacu river basins, in state of S (a) over tildeo Paulo, Brazil. All loci were polymorphic, {{and the number of}} alleles was high, ranging from 6 to 24, with a mean of 14. 4. All stands showed the same high level of genetic diversity (mean H(E) = 0. 83) and a low genetic differentiation (mean F(ST) = 0. 031), indicating that genetic diversity was higher within rather than among populations. Seven of the nine loci were highly variable, and sufficiently informative for E. uniflora. It was concluded that these new SSR markers can be efficiently used for gene flow studies.

40|$|Eugenia uniflora L. is {{a member}} of the Myrtaceae family and is {{commonly}} known as <b>Brazilian</b> <b>cherry</b> tree. In this study, we evaluated the chemical composition of Eugenia uniflora L. essential oil (EuEO) by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and assessed its anti-Leishmania activity. We also explored the potential mechanisms of action and cytotoxicity of EuEO. Thirty-two compounds were identified, which constituted 92. 65 % of the total oil composition. The most abundant components were sesquiterpenes (91. 92 %), with curzerene (47. 3 %), γ-elemene (14. 25 %), and trans-β-elemenone (10. 4 %) being the major constituents. The bioactivity shown by EuEO against promastigotes (IC 50, 3. 04 [*]μg·mL− 1) and amastigotes (IC 50, 1. 92 [*]μg·mL− 1) suggested significant anti-Leishmania activity. In the cytotoxicity determination, EuEO was 20 times more toxic to amastigotes than to macrophages. Hemolytic activity was 63. 22 % at the highest concentration tested (400 [*]μg·mL− 1); however, there appeared to be no toxicity at 50 [*]μg·mL− 1. While the data show that EuEO activity is not mediated by nitric oxide production, they do suggest that macrophage activation may be involved in EuEO anti-Leishmania activity, as evidenced by increases in both the phagocytic capacity and the lysosomal activity. More studies are needed to determine in vivo activity as well as additional mechanisms of the anti-Leishmania activity...|$|E
40|$|The exotic {{flavor of}} Brazilian {{tropical}} fruits led to increased consumption.
