5|$|Tatiana was {{described}} as tall and slender, with dark auburn hair and dark blue-gray eyes, fine, chiseled features, and a refined, elegant bearing <b>befitting</b> {{the daughter of an}} Emperor. She was considered the most beautiful of the four grand duchesses by many courtiers. Of all her sisters, Tatiana most closely resembled their mother.|$|E
5|$|The crew celebrated Christmas aboard Monitor while berthed at Hampton Roads in {{what was}} {{described}} as a most merry fashion, while many other celebrations were occurring along the shore. The ship's cook was paid one dollar to prepare a meal for the crew <b>befitting</b> the day; it was received with mixed opinion. That day, Monitor was made ready for sea, her crew under strict orders not to discuss the impending voyage with anyone, but bad weather delayed her departure until 29 December.|$|E
5|$|The jaguar {{is often}} {{described}} as nocturnal, but is more specifically crepuscular (peak activity around dawn and dusk). Both sexes hunt, but males travel farther each day than females, <b>befitting</b> their larger territories. The jaguar may hunt during the day if game is available and is a relatively energetic feline, spending as much as 50–60 percent of its time active. The jaguar's elusive nature and the inaccessibility of much of its preferred habitat make it a difficult animal to sight, let alone study.|$|E
5|$|The {{two teams}} {{finished}} with extremely similar statistical totals, as <b>befitting</b> a close game. The two teams were within 38total yards of each other; Kansas had 344yards and Virginia Tech had 306. That relative closeness {{was reflected in}} the teams' first-down totals as well. Virginia Tech earned 20first downs: 10rushing, eightpassing, and twovia penalty. Kansas, meanwhile, earned 19first downs: fiverushing, 13passing, and onevia penalty.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 12th-century {{ascendancy}} of the Hoysalas, {{the kings of}} the dynasty entertained imperial ambitions. King Vishnuvardhana wanted to perform Vedic sacrifices <b>befitting</b> an emperor, and surpass his overlords, the Western Chalukyas, in military and architectural achievements. This led to his conversion from Jainism to Vaishnavism. Around the same time, the well-known philosopher Ramanujacharya sought refuge from the Cholas in Hoysala territory and popularised the Sri Vaishnava faith, a sect of Hindu Vaishnavism. Although Jains continued to dominate culturally {{in what is now}} the southern Karnataka region for a while, these social changes would later contribute to the decline of Jain literary output. The growing political clout of the Hoysalas attracted many bards and scholars to their court, who in turn wrote panegyrics on their patrons.|$|E
5|$|Goodman and Edson were {{strongly}} influenced {{by the use of}} American Indian culture by Ernest Thompson Seton in his Woodcraft Indians program. They decided to create an honor society of their own at camp that summer, in a manner <b>befitting</b> a boy's interest and understanding. Goodman utilized the appeal of Indian lore and recognition by a Scout's peers as motivational tools. He devised a program where troops chose, at the camp's conclusion, those boys from among their number who best exemplified the ideals of Scouting. Those elected were acknowledged as having displayed, in the eyes of their fellow Scouts, a spirit of unselfish service and brotherhood. Edson helped Goodman research the traditions and language of the Lenni Lenape—also known as the Delaware—who had once inhabited Treasure Island.|$|E
5|$|In 1920 the {{dreadnought}} São Paulo {{bore the}} imperial coffins to Brazil. The Portuguese republican government granted PedroII an exhumation with dignities <b>befitting</b> a Head of State, and {{he received the}} same honors upon arrival in Brazil. The Count of Eu accompanied the remains, along with his only surviving son, Pedro de Alcântara. His wife, Princess Isabel, was elderly, unwell and unable to participate. She died one year later, without ever seeing her homeland again. President Artur Bernardes declared a national holiday {{and the return of}} the Emperor was celebrated throughout the nation.|$|E
5|$|Burke {{experimented with}} a variety of musical styles {{throughout}} the game's development. Burke's original compositions were lighthearted as <b>befitting</b> for a Nintendo game, but became darker along with other parts of the game to match the Xbox audience when Microsoft acquired Rare. The composer thought that this transition was reflected in the soundtrack, with some Nintendo-style music juxtaposed against the roaring orchestral tracks. Burke estimates that he had written four hours of audio for the project and ultimately recorded 80 minutes with an orchestra and choir over four days in Prague. The team recorded the orchestra and choir separately. Sumthing Else Music Works published the soundtrack on compact disc and for download via the iTunes Store and Amazon. It was nominated for the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences Outstanding Achievement in Original Music Composition award.|$|E
5|$|Henry Hastings, {{the third}} earl, was a zealous {{promoter}} of puritanism and founded Ashby Grammar School to provide education {{in accordance with}} his religious views. Anthony Gilby had lived in exile in Geneva {{during the reign of}} Mary, but was invited to Ashby by the earl and made the town a nationally important centre for radical Protestantism. Attempts by the church authorities to discipline him failed, and he died after 25 years spent preaching and pamphleteering. Hastings' influence meant that between 1562 and 1632 Ashby had a succession of Puritan ministers. The last of these was Arthur Hildersham, another influential figure who sought to internationalise radical Protestantism, but became vulnerable to the strictures of his bishop after Henry Hastings died in 1595. Hildersham was barred from preaching or deprived of his living for 17 of the 38 years of his incumbency, Earl Henry was interred in St Helen's after a lavish funeral <b>befitting</b> his status as Lord President of the Council of the North.|$|E
5|$|Kameo {{is known}} for its {{prolonged}} development cycle, which spanned four Nintendo and Microsoft consoles. It was conceived as a Pokémon-style game of capturing and nurturing monsters, but traded its lighthearted Nintendo overtones for darker themes more <b>befitting</b> of Xbox audiences when Microsoft acquired the developer. In this process, Kameo was repurposed from a fairy to an elf—a transition the game's director later concluded was unsuccessful. While nearly finished for the original Xbox console, the title was delayed to become an exclusive launch title for the upcoming Xbox 360. Rare used the extra time to improve the game's audiovisuals, including Rare's first orchestral soundtrack, and add a local cooperative multiplayer mode. Kameo released alongside the Xbox 360 launches: November 2005 in North America and several weeks later in Europe.|$|E
5|$|In 1897, Victoria {{had written}} {{instructions}} for her funeral, {{which was to}} be military as <b>befitting</b> a soldier's daughter {{and the head of the}} army, and white instead of black. On 25 January, Edward VII, the Kaiser and Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, helped lift her body into the coffin. She was dressed in a white dress and her wedding veil. An array of mementos commemorating her extended family, friends and servants were laid in the coffin with her, at her request, by her doctor and dressers. One of Albert's dressing gowns was placed by her side, with a plaster cast of his hand, while a lock of John Brown's hair, along with a picture of him, was placed in her left hand concealed from the view of the family by a carefully positioned bunch of flowers. Items of jewellery placed on Victoria included the wedding ring of John Brown's mother, given to her by Brown in 1883. Her funeral was held on Saturday 2 February, in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, and after two days of lying-in-state, she was interred beside Prince Albert in Frogmore Mausoleum at Windsor Great Park.|$|E

25|$|Views {{from the}} top are extensive, <b>befitting</b> the central location, with the Scafells and Helvellyn ranges being shown to {{particular}} effect.|$|E
25|$|<b>Befitting</b> George Town's {{status as}} a major Malaysian city with various multi-national {{economic}} and social interests, several nations have either established their consulates or appointed honorary-consulates within George Town.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{individual}} {{elements of the}} concept have very long histories as activities <b>befitting</b> a learned person, the earliest written source putting the four together is Zhang Yanyuan's Fashu Yaolu (Compendium of Calligraphy) from the Tang Dynasty.|$|E
25|$|Typical Golden Retrievers {{are active}} and fun-loving animals with the {{exceptionally}} patient demeanour <b>befitting</b> a dog bred to sit quietly {{for hours in}} a hunting blind. Adult Goldens love to work, and have a keen ability {{to focus on a}} given task. They will work until they collapse, so care should be taken to avoid overworking them.|$|E
25|$|Each {{football}} Saturday, the Band of the Fighting Irish is led {{onto the}} field for its traditional pre-game salute by the celebrated Irish Guard. This group of precision marchers was formed in 1949 when then Director H. Lee Hope conceived the idea of adding color to the band while maintaining the dignity <b>befitting</b> the nation's oldest university band.|$|E
25|$|By {{the spring}} of 1522 Norfolk was almost 80 {{years of age and}} in failing health. He retired to his ducal castle at Framlingham in Suffolk where he died on 21 May 1524. His funeral and burial on 22 June at Thetford Priory were said to have been 'spectacular and {{enormously}} expensive', <b>befitting</b> the richest and most powerful peer in England.|$|E
25|$|Captain Nolan's {{estimated}} monthly {{basic pay}} of $175.00 (or $210.00 depending on calculation of service time) was stopped in September 1869 and every penny {{was attached to}} pay the $5,217.33 due. At that monthly rate it would take almost 30 (or 24) months of his pay to settle the debt. His allowances as <b>befitting</b> his rank {{did not seem to}} be attached.|$|E
25|$|In Eastern Christianity, {{the sort}} of extra-liturgical adoration which {{developed}} in the West has never {{been part of the}} Eastern liturgy which St. Basil celebrated, but a liturgy for adoration does exist among the Eastern Catholic Churches, involving psalms and placing a covered diskos with the sacred species on the altar. This is <b>befitting</b> the Eastern custom of veiling those things deemed sacred from human eyes.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the later}} hagiographical literature, Theodore {{received}} an education <b>befitting</b> his family's station, {{and from the}} age of seven was instructed by a private tutor, eventually concentrating in particular on theology. It is however not clear that these opportunities were available to even the most well-placed Byzantine families of the eighth century, and it is possible that Theodore was at least partially an autodidact.|$|E
25|$|Ram Barat (Hindi: राम बारात) {{is a part}} of Ramlila {{celebration in}} Agra. It {{is one of the biggest}} annual events in North India. Ram Barat {{literally}} means Baraat Marriage procession of Sri Ram. Every year a new locality is chosen in Agra and is elaborately decorated with lights & flowers. The area is given a major face lift <b>befitting</b> the venue for the divine marriage.|$|E
25|$|However, Pan Zhang led {{an extravagant}} lifestyle, {{especially}} {{in his later}} years. The quality of his personal items and clothing actually exceeded that <b>befitting</b> his rank and status. He also killed some wealthy officials and seized their property for himself, and had broken the law on several occasions. When others reported these incidents to Sun Quan, he did not pursue the matter in consideration of Pan Zhang's contributions.|$|E
25|$|Kalākaua was {{the first}} monarch to travel around the world. While visiting Europe, he took note of the grand palaces owned by other monarchs. Like Kamehameha V, he dreamed of a royal palace <b>befitting</b> of the {{sovereignty}} of a modern state such as Hawaii. He commissioned the construction a new Iolani Palace, {{directly across the street}} from Aliiōlani Hale, to become the official palace of the Hawaiian monarchy.|$|E
25|$|Tim Allen, Richard Karn, Casey Sander, and Debbe Dunning had {{a reunion}} in a {{television}} special named Tim Allen Presents: A User's Guide to Home Improvement in 2003 (a terminally ill Earl Hindman did voice-overs, <b>befitting</b> his never-seen persona of Wilson).

The special is included on the season 8 DVD set.|$|E
25|$|On January 20, 1984, Weissmuller {{died from}} {{pulmonary}} edema {{at the age}} of 79. He was buried just outside Acapulco, Valle de La Luz at the Valley of the Light Cemetery. As his coffin was lowered into the ground, a recording of the Tarzan yell he invented was played three times, at his request. He was honored with a 21-gun salute, <b>befitting</b> a head-of-state, which was arranged by Senator Ted Kennedy and President Ronald Reagan.|$|E
25|$|Reynolds' {{body was}} {{immediately}} transported from Gettysburg to Taneytown, Maryland, {{and then to}} his birthplace, Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where he was buried on July 4, 1863. <b>Befitting</b> his importance to the Union and his native state, he is memorialized by three statues in Gettysburg National Military Park (an equestrian statue on McPherson Ridge, one by John Quincy Adams Ward in the National Cemetery, {{and one on the}} Pennsylvania Memorial), as well as one in front of the Philadelphia City Hall.|$|E
25|$|The top of Lord's Seat is {{a smooth}} grassy dome, the summit being {{marked by the}} meeting point of ruined fences and a small cairn. The view is extensive, <b>befitting</b> the highest point north of Whinlatter. The Northern Fells are well {{displayed}} over Bassenthwaite {{and there is also}} {{a good view of the}} Helvellyn range. Grasmoor and its supporters restrict the southward panorama, but there is no such obstruction to the north, the Scottish Hills being visible across the Solway Firth.|$|E
25|$|Hasbrouck's house shows {{sophistication and}} {{refinement}} <b>befitting</b> a large landholder {{who served as}} town supervisor {{and later in the}} American Revolutionary War. It is the culmination of the Dutch/Belgian-style stone houses that had been built all over Ulster County during the preceding century. His descendants found the house somewhat confining and, over several different generations, modified it in ways that reflected the changing tastes of the 19th and 20th centuries. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.|$|E
25|$|Four years later, in 1698, the rebuilt Statehouse in Jamestown {{burned down}} again, this time accidentally. The {{government}} again relocated 'temporarily' to Middle Plantation, {{and in addition}} to the better climate now also enjoyed use of the College's facilities. The College students made a presentation to the House of Burgesses, and it was agreed in 1699 that the colonial capital should be permanently moved to Middle Plantation. A village was laid out and Middle Plantation was renamed Williamsburg in honor of King William III of England, <b>befitting</b> the town's newly elevated status.|$|E
25|$|After {{the mansion}} was completed, Spreckels began {{throwing}} opulent parties <b>befitting</b> {{a woman of}} her status. Although attended by local celebrities such as author Jack London and sculptor Earl Cummings, {{there were a number}} of people who were disdainful of her earlier infamy and snubbed her invitations. This motivated her to gain some respectability for herself, which she did by going to Paris. There, she met entertainer Loie Fuller and through Fuller, other artists, most notably Auguste Rodin. With Fuller's encouragement and contacts, Alma Spreckels eventually became one of the more influential art collectors in the U.S.|$|E
25|$|Although {{bronze casting}} {{has a long}} history in south India, a much larger and a much greater number of bronze sculptures in all sizes ranging from massive to {{miniature}} were cast during the Chola period than before, further attesting to the importance of bronze sculpture during this period. It should be noted that when in worship, these images are bedecked in silk costumes, garlands, and gem encrusted jewels, <b>befitting</b> the particular avatar and religious context. Decorating temple bronzes in this way is a tradition at least a thousand years old and such decorations are referred to in 10th-century Chola inscriptions.|$|E
25|$|As <b>befitting</b> {{a luxury}} car, Toronados {{featured}} {{a long list}} of standard equipment that included Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission, variable-ratio power steering, power front disc brakes along with an electric clock, carpeting and deluxe wheel covers. Virtually all Toronados were sold loaded with extra-cost options including air conditioning, AM/FM stereo with 8-track tape player, power trunk release, vinyl roof, tilt and telescopic steering wheel, cruise control, power windows, power door locks and six-way power seats. Power windows became standard equipment in 1975. A new feature in 1974 was a gauge that monitored if the driver was driving economically or not.|$|E
25|$|In 1894, {{the college}} {{architect}} Walter Cope drew up {{plans for a}} second expansion of the Deanery {{at the request of}} M. Carey Thomas, shortly after she was appointed to the college Presidency. The Philadelphia firm of Cope and Stewardson had been commissioned to design and construct several campus buildings in the 1880s and 90s, including the dormitories Radnor (1885) and Denbigh (1891). The Deanery expansion, which was largely funded by Mary Garrett, was intended to transform the Deanery into a home <b>befitting</b> Thomas's new presidential status, fitting into Thomas's larger vision for the expansion of the campus.|$|E
25|$|It {{is clear}} that a {{grateful}} nation, recognizing the tremendous contributions of the key military and naval leaders in World War II, created these supreme grades {{as an attempt to}} accord to these leaders the prestige, the clear-cut leadership, and the emolument of office <b>befitting</b> their service to their country in war. It is the conviction of the Department of the Air Force that this recognition was and is appropriate. Moreover, appointments to this grade during periods other than war would carry the unavoidable connotation of downgrading of those officers so honored in World War II.|$|E
