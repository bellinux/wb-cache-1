They put on a much stronger resistance when {{the police and the}} army tried to occupy the Polytechnic campuses of Zacatenco and Santo Tomas. The battle lasted from 17:00 hours on September 23 to the early hours of September 24. The physician Justo Igor de León Loyola wrote in his book, La Noche de Santo Tomás (Santo Tomas' night): Today I have seen bloodier fights, unequal battles: Both sides are armed... <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> difference in the weapons, handguns caliber 22 against military rifles M-1, bazookas against Molotov bombs.|$|E
25|$|Once when Ramtanu Lahiri was ill, David Hare {{came and}} treated {{him in his}} house in a dingy lane. Hare used {{to keep track of}} all his students. Those were also the days when Kolkata society was in {{turbulence}} about the formation of the Brahma Sabha by Raja Rammohun Roy in 1828. It was an age of change. The practice of suttee was banned in 1829. That led to enormous debates and petitions for and against it. In 1831, Derozio was forced to resign from Hindu College and he died soon afterwards at the age of only 22 years, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> brilliant array of students he left behind: Krishna Mohan Banerjee, Ram Gopal Ghosh, Rasik Krishna Mallick, Sib Chandra Deb, Hara Chandra Ghosh, Peary Chand Mitra, Radhanath Sikdar and Ramtanu Lahiri, to name a few, all fired with the zeal to serve and change the county. In 1832, Krishna Mohan Banerjee, one of the Derozians converted to Christianity. From 1833 onwards, Indians were allowed to be deputy collectors and deputy magistrates, and some of the Derozians benefitted because of the relaxation.|$|E

500|$|Upon release, Neon Bible {{garnered}} universal acclaim, {{receiving an}} 87—the seventh highest score of 2007—from review aggregator Metacritic. NME reviewer Mark Beaumont commented the album [...] "is a climactic monolith {{of a record}} in the grand tradition of melodic transatlantic clamour rock." [...] The A.V. Club reviewer Kyle Ryan interpreted the album as a commentary on the post-9/11 American world, saying that [...] "the band is seemingly sending a beacon to other reasonable people forced underground by the world's insanity." [...] Stylus contributor Derek Miller saw the album in similar terms, saying that while the album touches on [...] "violence, paranoia, the falsity of simple labor, the war-call of organized religion—a what's what of indie turmoil after 2003" [...] the band go further {{to the point where}} its [...] "thematic threads bind the songs."

Phil and Grant were in the show together for at least 10years, and they were fantastic– so to be linked to them is phenomenal.

Rachel Tarley from the Metro said [...] "it's nice to have a bit of fresh blood in the soap, especially since the appearance of another one of his siblings always seems to leave Michael a little more demented than he was before. Lapinskas revealed to the Daily Mirror that because of his role in EastEnders, he is recognised in public, calling the experience [...] "surreal".

2500|$|Despite this, {{he managed}} to resist temptation both from within and without, and lived a {{perfectly}} obedient life. Jesus is therefore set forth as the supreme Example in whose footsteps Christians must follow. The fact that he overcame sin completely, despite having no advantage over other human beings, demonstrates that we too can {{live a life of}} complete obedience by trusting in him.

2500|$|Some {{scholars}} claim sharia allows {{religious freedom}} because a sharia verse teaches, [...] "there is no compulsion in religion." [...] Other scholars claim sharia recognizes only one proper religion, considers apostasy as sin punishable with death, {{and members of}} other religions as kafir (infidel); or hold that sharia demands that all apostates and kafir must be put to death, enslaved or be ransomed. Yet other scholars suggest that sharia has become a product of human interpretation and inevitably leads to disagreements about the “precise contents of the Shari'a." [...] In the end, then, what is being applied is not sharia, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> particular group of clerics and government decide is sharia. It is these differing interpretations of sharia that explain why many Islamic countries have laws that restrict and criminalize apostasy, proselytism and their citizens' freedom of conscience and religion.|$|E
2500|$|Adventist {{doctrine}} is that God took [...] "man's nature in its fallen condition," [...] but yet [...] "Christ {{did not in}} the least participate in its sin", which shows Christ with post fall humanity but a sinlessness of Adam before the fall Mainstream Adventists believe that Jesus was beset with all of the moral weaknesses and frailties that ordinary humans experience. However, {{he did not have the}} propensity to sin. Christ could be tested by temptation, but like Adam before the fall, did not have the ungodly desires or sinful inclinations of humanity. Ellen White states [...] "The Lord Jesus came to our world, not to reveal what a God could do, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> man could do, through faith in God’s power to help in every emergency.

2500|$|SputnikMusic {{rated the}} album 4 out of 5, commenting, “Ulver {{have taken a}} decidedly more subtle {{approach}} to songwriting and the mood they’re attempting to create, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> mood it is. The feeling that you get while listening to this album could best be summed up by the word “serenity”. Granted, it is a somber form of serenity, but the word still fits perfectly.” Adding, “If there are any problems that some may have with this new album {{it is going to}} be the same thing that is going to make others love this album, and that is its subtlety. Whereas on Blood Inside and Perdition City the albums commanded your attention due to their frequent shift from soft to loud sections and their regular use of discordant sounds, Shadows of the Sun will easily fade away from your attention if you don’t give it the awareness it deserves.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Colonial America did {{not have}} a {{significant}} theatre presence until 1752, when London entrepreneur William Hallam sent a company of actors to the colonies managed by his brother Lewis. In New York in the summer of 1753, they performed ballad-operas, such as The Beggar’s Opera, and ballad-farces. By the 1840s, P.T. Barnum was operating an entertainment complex in lower Manhattan. Other early musical theatre in America consisted of British forms, such as burletta and pantomime, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> piece was called did not necessarily define what it was. The 1852 Broadway extravaganza The Magic Deer advertised itself as [...] "A Serio Comico Tragico Operatical Historical Extravaganzical Burletical Tale of Enchantment." [...] Theatre in New York moved from downtown gradually to midtown from around 1850, and did not arrive in the Times Square area until the 1920s and 1930s. Broadway's The Elves (1857) broke the 50 performance barrier. New York runs continued to lag far behind those in London, but Laura Keene's [...] "musical burletta" [...] Seven Sisters (1860) shattered previous New York records with a run of 253 performances.|$|E
2500|$|The album itself {{received}} generally positive reviews by the UK critics, Keith Cameron of the NME {{gave the}} record {{seven out of}} ten in his review. Cameron compared Suede to The Smiths; he wrote, [...] "'Suede' faces the same problems [...] and similarly fails to deliver on a few, admittedly trifling, levels". However, he concluded, [...] "This is the solid, quality, ring-of-confidence debut [...] dreamed the band would produce". Stuart Maconie of Q gave the album 4 out of 5 stars. In his review he drew comparisons to Bowie, Morrissey and Marr. In conclusion he said [...] "Bowie and the Smiths are obvious points of reference. From each, Suede have taken an alien sexual charisma, a peculiarly claustrophobic Englishness and brazenly good tunes. Moreover, rarely has a record from the indie sector come with such a burning sense of its own significance." [...] In Select, Steve Lamacq noted [...] "a feeling {{in the air that}} they haven't fully let themselves go yet", concluding: [...] "As debuts go this isn't exactly Suede in flames: <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> smouldering attempt." [...] Ben Thompson of The Independent wrote that [...] "it would be a shame if the eagerness to get the backlash underway stopped their excellent album getting the respect it deserves." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 5 October 2014, it was {{announced}} that West would be leaving the show in a [...] "dramatic" [...] storyline. Dominic Treadwell-Collins, executive producer, said of West's departure, [...] "When you have an actor of Tim's calibre joining your cast, you treasure every day that you have him - and we knew from the start that Stan's stay {{with the rest of the}} Carter family would be a finite one. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> stay - and as we draw towards Stan's exit from the show, the audience should get ready as one of Britain's finest actors pulls out all the stops and gives his King Lear..." [...] It was reported on 2 November 2014 that Babe Smith (Annette Badland) would grow suspicious of Stan's whereabouts and when she discovers the truth, order him to tell his family. Over a week later, it {{was announced}} that Stan would confirm he has terminal prostate cancer to his family after Babe hastily tells them at Lee's birthday meal. These scenes were praised by Prostate Cancer UK. On 20 December 2014, Dyer revealed on The Graham Norton Show that Stan would ask Mick to help him die in a new euthanasia storyline. Dyer said, [...] "I'm juggling about eight storylines at the moment. My old man is on his way out. My mother's got Alzheimer's - she's not my mother, my sister's actually my mum. My dad dying - he's not my dad, he's actually my grandad - he wants me to smother him." [...] The prostate cancer began taking its effect on Stan's health on 23 January 2015 when Stan collapses in mid-commotion. Digital Spy Sophie Dainty reported in January 2015 that the Carters would clash over Stan's request to be killed by his family as Tina agrees to helping him, but Mick firmly disagrees. Mick even informs the family of Stan's request and they strongly disagree. Stan's request was made following his collapse. West praised show bosses for handling Stan's cancer storyline the way they have and their way of handling West's decision to leave the show, [...] "They very kindly said I could have some time out and they would send me to South Africa or prison. But I suggested something finite like death so they decided it would be good for me to have a disease of which I would know about and one where it could be arranged for me to die in six months' time." ...|$|E
