The reconstructed and conserved helmet was unveiled in January 2012.|$|E
50|$|Gillem Bluff, a fault scarp, {{was created}} as the region {{stretched}} and a <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> dropped down along this fault (see Basin and Range Province). The tuff layer {{on top of}} Gillem Bluff is 2,000,000 years old, inferring the rock layers beneath are even older. The oldest lava flow from the Medicine Lake Volcano within the monument is the Basalt of Hovey Point, near Captain Jack's Stronghold, which is 450,000 years old. Petroglyph Point was created about 275,000 years ago when cinders erupted through the shallow water of Tule Lake; violent explosions of ash and steam formed layers upon layers of tuff.|$|E
40|$|On October 27, 1935, a landslide, {{uncommon}} in this district, {{took place at}} a valley-head of the eastern slope of Dainenzi Hill, south of Sendai. A <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> about 90 m long and 20 m wide sank at the valley head to the maximum depth of 9 m, and another block in front of it, 90 m by 100 m, moved forward about 1 m. The following items may {{be taken into consideration}} as suggestive to the probable cause of this landslide. (1) Meteorological condition. We had an exceptionally heavy precipitation during September, 1935, and, 85. 7 mm rainfall, on the day the landslide took place. (2) Geological condition. The upper layer of the ground of this district consists of pervious rocks, sand and gravel, and beneath there is a layer of impervious sandy shale with a dip of 10 degrees to the east. (3) Tectonic condition. This district rests on the so called "Miyagino Flexure" which seems to be still active...|$|E

50|$|In 1993, {{initial stages}} of new road {{development}} revealed traces of several graves throughout the land slated for construction. Seven graves were discovered upon further excavation. Four of these showed little historical significance; the three remaining graves, contained organic materials that would prompt further analysis.

40|$|EarthSaw{trademark} is a {{proposed}} technology {{for construction of}} uniform high quality barriers under and around pits and trenches containing buried radioactive waste without excavating or disturbing the waste. The method works by digging a deep vertical trench {{around the perimeter of}} a site, filling that trench with high specific gravity grout sealant, and then cutting a horizontal bottom pathway {{at the base of the}} trench with a simple cable saw mechanism. The severed <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> becomes buoyant in the grout and floats on a thick layer of grout, which then cures into an impermeable barrier. The ''Interim Report on task 1 and 2 '' which is incorporated into this report as appendix A, provided theoretical derivations, field validation of formulas, a detailed quantitative engineering description of the technique, engineering drawings of the hardware, and a computer model of how the process would perform in a wide variety of soil conditions common to DOE waste burial sites. The accomplishments of task 1 and 2 are also summarized herein Task 3 work product provides a comprehensive field test plan in Appendix B and a health and safety plan in Appendix C and proposal for a field-scale demonstration of the EarthSaw barrier technology.

40|$|Results of magnetotelluric tests, {{carried out}} in Siberian {{kimberlite}} province, are examined {{from the viewpoint of}} structural control over location of kimberlite fields and bunches of kimberlite pipes. It is demonstrated that the key factors controlling occurrence of kimberlite magmatism are: deep systems of rift-driven fractures; areas of their intersection within high-ohmic <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>Earth</b> crust; conducting permeable areas, located at the intersections of deep faults. Various-rank objects of kimberlite magmatism are characterized by a certain combination of geoelectric heterogeneities, differing in resistance, lateral sizes and depth. The province is situated within the boundaries, limited by isolines 180 - 220  km of current asthenosphere; kimberlite areas – within the contours of high-resistance regional heterogeneities. Fields and bunches of kimberlite pipes are concentrated within boundaries of conducting subvertical zones. These factors can be used as criteria of predictive assessment for promising diamond areas of the ancient platforms...|$|R

50|$|Earthquakes {{happen when}} two <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Earth's</b> crust move {{relative}} to one another.

25|$|Late Precambrian {{rocks are}} {{widespread}} on Anglesey, Llŷn and Arfon with other, more restricted occurrences in north Pembrokeshire, Radnorshire and Carmarthenshire. The often intensive metamorphism which these originally volcanic and sedimentary rocks {{have been subjected}} to and their generally faulted relationship to neighbouring rocks has meant that geologists’ understanding of them has been limited. The majority lie on or close to the margins <b>of</b> terranes, <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Earth’s</b> crust which have had differing geological histories before assuming their present configuration.

50|$|The Narmada Valley is a graben, a layered <b>block</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Earth's</b> crust {{that dropped}} down {{relative}} to the blocks on either side due to ancient spreading <b>of</b> the <b>Earth's</b> crust. Two normal faults, known as the Narmada North fault and Narmada South fault, parallel to the river's course, and mark {{the boundary between the}} Narmada block and the Vindhya and Satpura blocks or Horsts which rose {{relative to the}} Narmada Graben. The Narmada's watershed includes the northern slopes of the Satpuras, and the steep southern slope of the Vindhyas, but not the Vindhyan tableland, the streams from which flow into the Ganges and Yamuna. The Narmada valley is considered extremely important for palaeontological studies in India. Several dinosaur fossils have been found in the area including Titanosaurus indicus found in 1877 by Richard Lydekker and the recently discovered Rajasaurus narmadensis.|$|R
50|$|When two <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> the <b>earth</b> {{suddenly}} slip past {{each other}} in the fault <b>of</b> the <b>earth,</b> it is called an earthquake. Energy released in many forms moves in all directions and causes the ground to shake. Sometimes earthquakes may have foreshocks, which are smaller earthquakes that occur in the same region which is followed by a larger earthquake. The larger earthquake, called the mainshock, always has aftershocks that follow it. Aftershocks can continue of hours, weeks, months and sometimes even years depending on how big the mainshock was. Earthquakes usually occur on active faults which define major tectonic plates on the <b>Earth.</b> 90% <b>of</b> the world’s earthquakes occur along plate boundaries. Earthquakes can cause much damage, mainly from the ground shaking and leaving cracks in the ground. Sometimes it can also cause buildings to collapse and cause deaths.|$|R
40|$|During an earthquake, two <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Earth’s</b> crust slide {{past one}} another {{generating}} {{massive amounts of}} frictional heat. In fact, Kanamori & Brodsky (2001) describe earthquakes as thermal events more than seismic events {{because most of the}} energy release during an earthquake goes into heat rather than seismic waves. While seismologists continue to collect valuable data, Earthscope’s SAFOD and PBO projects provide a unique opportunity for us to expand our knowledge of the earthquake process by understanding heat produced along large faults. Most notably, frictional heat could hold the key to unlocking the three-decade-old mystery about the frictional strength of plate boundary faults. This enhanced understanding of the rheology of plate boundaries will lead to improvements in mechanical models of faulting, stress-triggering, and earthquake rupture...|$|R
