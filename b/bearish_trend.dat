5000|$|From 1970 to 1989, {{the show}} used the Wall Street Week Index (later {{known as the}} WSW Technical Market Index), a {{technical}} analysis developed by Robert Nurock. The analysis consisted of ten separate technical indicators, each of which was assigned a value of either +1 (indicating a bullish trend), -1 (for a <b>bearish</b> <b>trend,</b> or 0 (neutral)). A net balance of +5 (or higher) was interpreted as a buy signal, while a reading of -5 (or lower) was a sell signal. While the index rarely gave outright buy or sell signals, over time it was found to give an accurate forecast of the stock market. Rukeyser irreverently named the index [...] "The Elves" [...] (a reference to the Gnomes of Zürich), and dubbed Nurock the [...] "Chief Elf." [...] After being in neutral for a considerable period of time, Rukeyser requested {{significant changes in the}} makeup of the index. Nurock refused since he believed his ten indicators were still the best way to judge the technical aspects of the market. This ended Nurock's association with the show and the Index was replaced.|$|E
40|$|A {{dynamical}} {{model is}} introduced {{for the formation}} of a bullish or bearish trends driving an asset price in a given market. Initially, each agent decides to buy or sell according to its personal opinion, which results from the combination of its own private information, the public information and its own analysis. It then adjusts such opinion through the market as it observes sequentially the behavior of a group of random selection of other agents. Its choice is then determined by a local majority rule including itself. Whenever the selected group is at a tie, i. e., it is undecided on what to do, the choice is determined by the local group belief with respect to the anticipated trend at that time. These local adjustments create a dynamic that leads the market price formation. In case of balanced anticipations the market is found to be efficient in being successful to make the "right price" to emerge from the sequential aggregation of all the local individual informations which all together contain the fundamental value. However, when a leading optimistic belief prevails, the same efficient market mechanisms are found to produce a bullish dynamic even though most agents have bearish private informations. The market yields then a wider and wider discrepancy between the fundamental value and the market value, which in turn creates a speculative bubble. Nevertheless, there exists a limit in the growing of the bubble where private opinions take over again and at once invert the trend, originating a sudden <b>bearish</b> <b>trend.</b> Moreover, {{in the case of a}} drastic shift in the collective expectations, a huge drop in price levels may also occur extremely fast and puts the market out of control, it is a market crash. ...|$|E

ABSTRACT: This paper measures the investor’s sentiment in stock market. There are two indicators to measure investor sentiment either directly or indirectly, Closing price of stocks and traded volume as proxy variables (indirect method) were used for analyses. This study finds the connection between investor’s sentiments, which depends upon the bullish and <b>bearish</b> market <b>trends.</b> After analysis, it is concluded that bullish and <b>bearish</b> <b>trends</b> {{in the stock market}} are appropriate measures for measuring the investor’s sentiments as per results shown in this study...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{tests the}} {{performance}} of 2894 hedge funds in a time period that encompasses unambiguously bullish and <b>bearish</b> <b>trends</b> whose pivot is commonly set at March 2000. The database proves to be fairly trustable {{with respect to the}} most important biases in hedge funds studies, despite the high attrition rate of funds observed in the down market. An original ten-factor composite performance model is applied that achieves very high significance levels. The analysis of performance indicates that most hedge funds significantly outperformed the market during the whole test period, mostly thanks to the bullish subperiod. In contrast, no significant underperformance of individual hedge funds strategies is observed when markets headed south. The analysis of persistence yields very similar results, with most of the predictability being found among middle performers during the bullish period. However, the "Market Neutral" strategy represents a remarkable exception, as abnormal performance is sustained throughout and significant persistence can be found between the 20 % and 69 % best performers in this category, probably thanks to an extreme adaptability and a very active investment behaviour.

40|$|Revtex, 7 pages, 7 figuresIt is {{suggested}} to consider long term trends of financial markets as a growth phenomenon. The {{question that is}} asked is what conditions are needed for a long term sustainable growth or contraction in a financial market? The paper discuss the role of traditional market players of long only mutual funds versus hedge funds which take both short and long positions. It will be argued that financial markets since their very origin and only till very recently, {{have been in a}} state of ``broken symmetry'' which favored long term growth instead of contraction. The reason for this ``broken symmetry'' into a long term ``bull phase'' is the historical almost complete dominance by long only players in financial markets. Dangers connected to short trading are illustrated by the appearence of long term <b>bearish</b> <b>trends</b> seen in analytical results and by simulation results of an agent based market model. Recent short trade data of the Nasdaq Composite index show an increase in the short activity prior to or {{at the same time as}} dips in the market, and reveal an steadily increase in the short trading activity, reaching levels never seen before...|$|R
40|$|The present {{paper is}} an attempt to study the impact of {{volatility}} and systematic risk in select Housing Finance Companies in India. During the period of rapid melt down of stock markets most of the share prices fell to their lowest levels. The movement of BSE sensex as well as five other top housing companies namely HDFC, LIC Housing Finance, GIC Housing Finance, Dewan Housing Finance Ltd and Canfinhomes were studies for a period of 5 years ie from March 2004 to March 2009 and the fluctuations of share prices during bullish and <b>bearish</b> <b>trends</b> were recorded. The study reveals that the proportion of systematic risk is more in HDFC Limited followed by LIC Housing Finance Limited, Can Fin Homes Limited and GIC Housing Finance Limited. Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Limited has very small proportion of systematic risk associated with it. It indicates that the housing finance companies cannot give greater returns than market returns in a bull market and did not loose more than the market lost in a bear market. The investment in housing finance stocks is stable in nature. It can be concluded that investment in housing finance stocks is more safe in volatile market conditions...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} two closely related areas of {{liquidity}} and market impact. The historic limit order book of Stock Exchange Trading Sys- tem (SETS) {{operated by the}} London Stock Exchange (LSE) is rebuilt using this framework for empirical analysis of information contained in the limit order book. The concept of Notional Volume Weighted Average Price (NVWAP) is introduced to construct liquidity supply and demand curves based on real time bid and ask schedules of {{the full length of}} the limit or- der book. This unique approach is used to determine how the order book behaves and I find consistent wave-like patterns between up- ward and downward price trends. Regression coefficients of the slope of the curves for each market event are estimated using an exponen- tial model. Four statistics are defined to identify bullish and <b>bearish</b> <b>trends</b> without prior knowledge of the market price. Detailed analy- sis shows that these statistics correctly identify market conditions for 88 % to 97 % of the observations. The intraday patterns of regression coefficients are revealed using a nonparametric kernel regression model. These intraday patterns are not found to be consistent between stocks over time. A resampled and deseasonalised set of estimated regression coefficients is analysed for temporal dependence using a multivariate vector autoregression (VAR) model. Inferences drawn from marginal probabilities regarding Cranger-causality do not show significant impact of slope coefficients {{on the opposite side of}} the limit order book implying that each side of the market is simultaneously rather than sequentially influenced by prevailing market conditions. The VWAP concept is extended to estimate the average shape of the limit order book and average market impact. The average market impact estimates are found to be superior than the order imbalance based approach. A time-of-day market impact for a given aggregate volume is estimated using a multivariate kernel regression model with monotonicity constraint. The estimated market impact shows stock- specific and wave-like impact that is asymmetric for buyers and sellers. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis article {{investigates the}} impact of US stock market {{openings}} on linkages between the UK and French markets. Using intraday data over the period December 2004 to March 2009, we find significant time-varying dependence between the UK and French stock returns, which alter {{according to the state}} of the US market. Indeed, not only does the opening of the US market itself significantly affect the UK stock dependency, but such linkages also seem to be closely dependent on bearish or bullish US market trends. Interestingly, the estimation of a two-regime Threshold Autoregressive (TAR) model indicates that the <b>bearish</b> US <b>trends</b> are a source of minor linkage (lower regime), whereas the bullish US trends involve higher interdependency (upper regime). This finding is particularly interesting as following the US trend expectations enables us to better forecast future European stock prices and to calculate the level of their potential contagion effects...|$|R

40|$|The {{impact of}} short run price {{trending}} on the conditional volatility is tested empirically. A new family of conditionally heteroscedastic models with a trend-dependent conditional variance equation: The Trend-GARCH model is described. Modern microeconomic theory often suggests {{the connection between}} the past behaviour of time series, the subsequent reaction of market individuals, and thereon changes in the future characteristics of the time series. Results reveal important properties of these models, which are consistent with stylized facts found in financial data sets. They can also be employed for model identification, estimation, and testing. The empirical analysis supports the existence of trend effects. The Trend-GARCH model proves to be superior to alternative models such as EGARCH, AGARCH, TGARCH OR GARCH-in-Mean in replicating the leverage effect in the conditional variance, in fitting the news impact curve and in fitting the volatility estimates from high frequency data. In addition, we show that the leverage effect is dependent on the current trend, i. e. it differentiates between bullish and <b>bearish</b> markets. Furthermore, <b>trend</b> effects can account for {{a significant part of the}} long memory property of asset price volatilities.
