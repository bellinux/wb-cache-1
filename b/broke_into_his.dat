5|$|In November 2005, {{three men}} {{carrying}} guns <b>broke</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> home, removing any valuables. They {{asked if he}} was gay, and when he refused to respond they kidnapped him, later shooting him dead and dumping the body elsewhere. The police subsequently arrested four individuals and charged them with murder in the furtherance of a robbery. The accused remained in police custody for almost ten years before the case came to court. At that point, the police dropped their murder charges against two of the accused. The other two, Dwayne Owen and Andre West, went on trial and were found unanimously guilty of murder by a jury. Although prosecutors had requested capital punishment in the case, the judge sentenced them to life in prison with a minimum of thirty years before becoming eligible for parole.|$|E

Alexander: An {{author who}} {{was in the process of}} typing his magnum opus A Clockwork Orange, when Alex and his droogs <b>broke</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> house, beat him, tore up his work and then brutally gang-raped his wife, which caused her {{subsequent}} death. He is left deeply scarred by these events, and when he encounters Alex two years later he uses him as a guinea pig in a sadistic experiment intended to prove the Ludovico technique unsound. He is given the name Frank Alexander in the film.|$|E

25|$|On 15 May 1366 Devereux was {{assigned}} to inquire into the complaint of Gilbert and Elizabeth Giffard that the Prior of Saint Oswald’s was not maintaining the chapel on Kingshome manor, Gloucestershire, that {{was held in the}} king’s hand because Elizabeth was underage. He was appointed Justice of the Peace for Gloucestershire on 16 May 1366, and again on 10 July 1368. On 8 Aug 1368 he was appointed to investigate a complaint by Sir John de Burley that Emery le Botiller and others <b>broke</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> park at Harsfeld, Gloucestershire, hunted deer, cut down trees, and then carried them away with other goods.|$|E
25|$|An Oyer and terminer {{commission}} was called on 11 Sep 1357 for a complaint by Sir Richard de Acton that Walter Devereux was {{among a number}} of individuals that <b>broke</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> park at Aily, Somersetshire, hunted and carried away a great part of the deer therein, and then killed livestock worth 10 marks. Another {{commission was}} called in 1362 on a complaint by the abbot of Abbotsbury that Walter Devereux was {{among a number of}} individuals who tore up stones for metes and bounds in his lands in Tolpuddle (Dorsetshire), felled trees, broke a stank erected to store water for times of drought, carried away fish and timber, trod down and consumed with cattle his crops and grass, and so molested his bondmen there that they cannot hold his bondage.|$|E
25|$|Penrose and Miller bought Farley Farm House in Sussex in 1949, {{where he}} {{displayed}} his valuable collection {{of modern art}} {{and in particular the}} Surrealists and works by Picasso. Penrose also designed the landscaping around the house as a setting for works of modern sculpture. In 1972, thieves <b>broke</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> London flat, stole a number of works, and then demanded a ransom. During a BBC TV interview, Penrose stated he would refuse all demands for a ransom. The paintings were later recovered as a result of diligent police work. Some were damaged but were restored by the Tate Gallery. After the death of his wife, Penrose loaned several key paintings from her collection to The Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art in Edinburgh, a practice that Penrose's descendants have continued with his collection.|$|E

25|$|The Daily Telegraph, citing {{anonymous}} sources, {{reported that}} in December 2006, a top Syrian official (according to one article this {{was the head of}} the Atomic Energy Commission of Syria, Ibrahim Othman) arrived in London under a false name. The Mossad had detected a booking for the official in a London hotel, and dispatched at least ten undercover agents to London. The agents were split into three teams. One group was sent to Heathrow Airport to identify the official as he arrived, a second to book into his hotel, and a third to monitor his movements and visitors. Some of the operatives were from the Kidon Division, which specializes in assassinations, and the Neviot Division, which specializes in breaking into homes, embassies, and hotel rooms to install bugging devices. On the first day of his visit, he visited the Syrian embassy and then went shopping. Kidon operatives closely followed him, while Neviot operatives <b>broke</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> hotel room and found his laptop. A computer expert then installed software that allowed the Mossad to monitor his activities on the computer. When the computer material was examined at Mossad headquarters, officials found blueprints and hundreds of pictures of the Kibar facility in various stages of construction, and correspondence. One photograph showed North Korean nuclear official Chon Chibu meeting with Ibrahim Othman, Syria's atomic energy agency director. Though the Mossad had originally planned to kill the official in London, it was decided to spare his life following the discovery. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert was notified. The following month, Olmert formed a three-member panel to report on Syria's nuclear program. The CIA was also informed and the American intelligence network joined the quest for more information. Six months later, Brigadier-General Yaakov Amidror, one of the panel's members, informed Olmert that Syria was working with North Korea and Iran on a nuclear facility. Iran had funneled $1 billion to the project, and planned on using the Kibar facility to replace Iranian facilities if Iran was unable to complete its uranium enrichment program.|$|E
500|$|On January 4, 2000, Mihdhar left Yemen {{and flew}} to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, {{where he spent}} the night. [...] The CIA <b>broke</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> hotel room and photocopied his passport, which gave them his full name, birth {{information}} and passport number for the first time, and alerted them that he held an entry visa to the United States. [...] The photocopy {{was sent to the}} CIA's Alec Station, which was tracking al-Qaeda.|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of {{repeated}} racial bigotry, Russell refused to respond to fan acclaim or friendship from his neighbors, thinking it was insincere and hypocritical. This attitude contributed to his legendarily bad rapport with fans and journalists. He alienated Celtics fans by saying, [...] "You owe the public the same it owes you, nothing! I refuse to smile and be nice to the kiddies." [...] This supported the opinion of many white fans that Russell (who was by then the highest-paid Celtic) was egotistical, paranoid and hypocritical. The already hostile atmosphere between Russell and Boston hit its apex when vandals <b>broke</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> house, covered the walls with racist graffiti, damaged his trophies and defecated in the beds. In response, Russell described Boston as a [...] "flea market of racism". In King Of The Court by Aram Goudsouzian, he was quoted saying, [...] "From my very first year I {{thought of myself as}} playing for the Celtics, not for Boston. The fans could do or think whatever they wanted." [...] Referring to a time when the Celtics could not sell out the Boston Garden despite hockey’s popularity in the same stadium, Russell recalled “We [...] did a survey about what we could do to improve attendance. Over 50 percent of responses said 'There’s too many black players.'” In retirement, Russell described the Boston press as corrupt and racist; in response, Boston sports journalist Larry Claflin claimed that Russell himself was the real racist.|$|E

2500|$|Margera {{was engaged}} to Jenn Rivell, a {{divorced}} single mother. Rivell played a prominent part in several of his projects and the couple appeared to be cohabiting in various episodes of Viva La Bam. Their seven-year relationship ended in 2005.

2500|$|I am {{engaged in}} a famous Cause: The Cause of King, of Scarborough vs. a Mob, that <b>broke</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> House, and [...] rifled his Papers, and terrifyed him, his Wife, Children and Servants in the Night. The Terror, and Distress, the Distraction and Horror of this Family cannot be {{described}} by Words or painted upon Canvass. It is enough to move a Statue, to melt an Heart of Stone, to read the Story.... It was not surprising that Richard King became a loyalist. All of his sons, however, became patriots in the American War of Independence.|$|E
2500|$|The protest {{ended on}} the 30th day on January 10, 2009, with Pelloni {{saying that he}} was {{suffering}} from a [...] "wicked headache". Pelloni described Nintendo as a [...] "heartless corporation, only interested in the biggest profits". He ransacked his room in frustration and posted a lengthy comment on his website, declaring his defeat. In light of the statement and the lack of any visible movement on the webcam, a concerned user from the /v/ board on 4chan was able to retrieve Pelloni's telephone number from his Whois information. The user contacted his sister in an attempt to have somebody check on him. Then, on January 11, the police <b>broke</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> room to check on him, finding him well.|$|E

50|$|The first {{recording}} {{session for}} the song was on 25 February 1964 at Abbey Road Studios when three takes were attempted, but only one was complete.

2500|$|This novel {{technique}} worked wonders, as the Thebans rapidly {{broke through}} the Athenian left, and moved to encircle {{the rest of the}} Athenian army. [...] However, the Thespians on the Boeotian left were up against the Athenians' crack troops, and were themselves quickly overwhelmed, surrounded, and killed almost to a man. [...] Sensing that his victorious Thebans could not outflank the enemy before the Athenian right <b>broke</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> rear, Pagondas chose to do something utterly unprecedented in the annals of Greek warfare. [...] He called in a reserve force (the mere creation of which was itself unprecedented) of several hundred cavaliers to support the now decimated Thespians. [...] The Athenians on the right were stunned by this—so much so that they apparently fell into a confusion and turned tail. [...] This was perhaps fortunate for Pagondas's cavaliers, as Greek cavalry, made up of light-armed aristocrats without saddles or stirrups, was no match for a company of hoplites. [...] Nevertheless, the use of the cavalry reserve broke the Athenian right and, because the Thebans had by now moved into the Athenian rear, caused a general Athenian rout.|$|E
2500|$|The Franklins fled, {{afraid for}} their lives {{that they might be}} lynched. They took refuge with ex-state Senator Stanwix Mayfield, and with his help turned {{themselves}} in to Orangeburg Sheriff John H. Dukes. Franklin's initial trial took place on September 9, 1907. P. T. Hildebrand and three other lawyers were the prosecution and Patsy was found not guilty, while Pink was found guilty in the one-day trial heard by judge J. C. Klugh. Franklin's defense was Jacob Moorer from Orangeburg and John Adams from Columbia. The type of agricultural contract Franklin worked under was then and later called, [...] "peonage laws". Franklin claimed that the constables <b>broke</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> house and did not identify themselves, and that he was acting in self-defense. The prosecution claimed that the doors were open and that the constables did announce their presence and identify themselves. Franklin's leaving the Thomas farm was legal, otherwise his contract would have, indeed, been illegal peonage, but the landowner had convinced officials to write a warrant for his arrest. Franklin was sentenced to hang after the initial trial, a sentence that was confirmed in a resentensing in early September 1910, with a date set in December to give chance for further appeal [...] Moorer and Adams stated they would appeal. The jury was all white and Moorer and Adams felt this was due to unconstitutional discrimination against blacks seeking to register to vote (and thus to be eligible for juries). It was reported that even trial judge Klugh believed that Franklin would not have been convicted if he were white.|$|E

50|$|Maks Luburic {{was one of}} Pavalic's Lieutenants during WWII. Maks <b>broke</b> {{splintered}} <b>into</b> <b>his</b> own group, Odpor-HNO in 1955. This split {{was apparently}} {{due to the fact}} that Pavalic was willing to give up some historically Croatian land in exchange to reestablish an independent Croatia The working relationship between the two men was a long standing one, beginning in the 1930's with the Ustache movement. In 1969, Luburić was assassinated by the Yugoslav secret police the UDBA.|$|R
