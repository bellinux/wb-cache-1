5000|$|TerraDrive Live, like Assassin is a [...] "lifestyle-invading" [...] game; play {{may not be}} {{restricted}} to a specific time interval, but is integrated into the players' everyday activities (in the case of PAX, during a three-day convention). TerraDrive Live players {{are referred to as}} Mercs and must find other players to defeat in combat. Mercs are identified by the Life Tokens they wear in their convention <b>badge</b> <b>holder.</b> When two players identify each other and agree to combat, they agree to wager an equal number of life tokens, then [...] "fight" [...] each other with three throws of rock paper scissors. Each throw is modified by powerups, which are cards that enhance defensive or offensive capabilities. For example, armor powerups protect against certain throws (either rock, paper, or scissors, depending on the powerup). A specific powerup can nullify armor powerups. There are also weapon, ability, and equipment powerup types. There are currently twelve powerups in the entire set. When one merc beats another (best of three rock paper scissors throws), he or she gets the wagered life tokens and one of the defeated merc's powerups (if he/she had any equipped for the final throw).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} implementation of a new CORBA-based software for Active Badge System (ABS) originally designed at ORL in Cambridge UK [3]. Since the system was designed and constructed some drawbacks in its architecture and functionality have been identified during its exploitation in the real office environment. At {{the beginning of the}} new software design a conceptual model of existing ABS has been evaluated in the context of requirements of ABS front-end applications. This led to the following conclusions. The granularity of the existing ABS is large, i. e. it consists of {{a relatively small number of}} heavyweight objects. This made the system reconfiguration and management of the persistent data difficult. The system data were passed by value enabling inconsistencies in the system state. End applications operated on messages in the internal format of the ABS wire protocol. The scalability of the original system was significantly restricted by the centralized processing of location information. The experience has shown that an additional middle layer between the ABS system core and front-end applications is needed, which would provide more abstract view of information about equipment and user location and history of its changes. The implementation of the existing system in ANSA causes that it is not compliant with today modern software technology. The existing Active Badge software mainly supports a model of the system built around three relationships: 1) badge to <b>badge</b> <b>holder,</b> 2) sensor to place (called a sensor group) and 3) sighting that is a temporal relationship between a badge and a sensor. All other dependencies are inferred from these relationships. A detailed analysis of that system leads to the conclusion that there are two categories of rela [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Reverse {{engineers}} often like {{to argue}} that a prime motivator for their activities is the desire to discover and patch vulnerabilities in closed-source binary software. Given the veritable plethora [...] nay, Katrina-like flood of vulnerabilities being discovered on a near daily basis, {{one has to wonder}} where all these binary patches are hiding. Clearly this argument is a sham to make reverse engineers feel better about their DMCA violating activities. Now, just to be clear, there have been one or two third party binary patches released in the past year, but why haven't there been more? Is it truly a difficult task to develop such a patch or are our sights simply set too high? Is a true fix to the problem a requirement or is it sufficient to modify the vulnerable program just enough to make it immune to scripted attacks, the goal being to provide sufficient protection to survive until a vendor supplied patch can truly fix the problem. Dan Geer argued that a software monoculture is a dangerous thing leading to the rapid spread of malicious code {{in the event of a}} public vulnerability disclosure. The goal of this talk is to discuss simple yet effective measures to introduce sufficient genetic diversity into an inbred piece of software to allow it to survive in the wild until a vendor supplied update becomes available.
