5000|$|Although {{there are}} many other {{apparent}} causes of bearing failure, most can be reduced to these three. For example, a bearing which is run dry of lubricant fails not because it is [...] "without lubricant", but because lack of lubrication leads to fatigue and welding, and the resulting wear debris can cause abrasion. Similar events occur in false brinelling damage. In high speed applications, the oil flow also reduces the <b>bearing</b> <b>metal</b> temperature by convection. The oil becomes the heat sink for the friction losses generated by the bearing.|$|E

Time between grease replacements decreases very strongly with diameter of bearing: for a 40 mm bearing, grease should be replaced every 5000 working hours, while for a 100 mm bearing it should be replaced every 500 working hours.|$|E

This paper deals with a systematic analysis of a mechanical accident of the mill turbines and reduction gears at one of the cane sugar mill plants in Okinawa.

40|$|Microbial strains, {{characterized}} by increased tolerance {{and ability to}} grow in <b>metal</b> <b>bearing</b> wastewaters {{as well as by}} effective metal sequestering capability by both active (bioaccumulative) and passive (biosorptive) processes, were tested as inoculum for metal laden wastewater treatment systems. Their capacity to grow in <b>metal</b> <b>bearing</b> wastewater, using an easily available and inexpensive carbon source such as acetate, was studied in batch experiments. Two principal conclusions were drawn: (1) Growth was observed for all the strains examined suggesting that the strains can be acclimated to <b>metals</b> <b>bearing</b> wastewaters. (2) Solution pH increased from neutral to alkaline values during growth (pH(initial) = 7, pH(final) = 10). The later was observed systematically for all strains. Metal precipitation, due to the metabolically generated alkalinity is expected as a result. Supporting evidence for this hypothesis was provided during the operation of two pilot moving bed sand filters treating two different <b>metal</b> <b>bearing</b> wastewaters. Acetate was used as carbon source to support the growth and maintenance of microbial biomass on the sand grains of the filters. The characteristics of the sludge produced from the operation of the pilot plants were subsequently studied in the laboratory. Both sludges were significantly loaded with large amounts of metals. A mechanism of metal precipitation induced by the metabolically generated alkalinity, when acetate is used as carbon source, could be proposed as the main process responsible for the metals sequestering inside the moving bed sandfilter reactor.
