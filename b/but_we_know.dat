25|$|This {{frontier}} {{remained for}} about 100 years, {{and no doubt}} in that long period much was done to it to which precise dates are difficult to fix. It cannot even be absolutely certain when the frontier laid out by Pius was equipped with the manpitts and other special fortifications. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> that {{the pressure of the}} barbarians began to be felt seriously in the later part of the 2nd century, and after long struggles the whole or almost the whole district east of the Rhine and north of the Danube was lost, seemingly all within one short period, about 250.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} some things {{for which it is}} not enough to state a single cause, but several, of which one, however, is the case. Just as if you were to see the lifeless corpse of a man lying far away, it would be fitting to list all the causes of death in order to make sure that the single cause of this death may be stated. For you would not be able to {{establish}} conclusively that he died by the sword or of cold or of illness or perhaps by poison, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> that there is something of this kind that happened to him.|$|E
25|$|Through his {{research}} with the rats, he learned that forgetting was dependent {{on the amount of}} tissue removed and not where it was removed from. He called this mass action and he believed that it was a general rule that governed how brain tissue would respond, independent of the type of learning. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> now that mass action was true for these rats, because learning to run a maze is known as complex learning and it requires multiple cortical areas, so cutting into individual parts alone will not erase the memory from the rats' brains, but taking large sections removes multiple cortical areas at one time and so they can forget.|$|E

25|$|Lübeck {{remained}} organist of St. Nikolai {{until his}} death in 1740. One of his sons (also named Vincent, 16841755) assisted him from 1735 and succeeded him. During much of his career, Lübeck was a renowned teacher and organ consultant (passing judgements on, among others, Schnitger instruments). <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> little about his teaching activities; his pupils, aside from the two sons, included Michael Johann Friedrich Wiedeburg, a renowned keyboard pedagogue. Although J.S. Bach may have been influenced by Lübeck, they almost certainly never met. Lübeck's works were quickly forgotten with {{much of the rest of}} 17th and 18th century organ music. The first modern edition of the composer's work appeared in 1921 in Germany (G. Harms (Klecken, 1921)). A school in Stade was named in his honor, the Vincent Lübeck Gymnasium.|$|E
25|$|The same {{argument}} for unification {{could be made}} for Latin and Cyrillic -- the American English encoding system known as ASCII never encoded the Cyrillic А (U+0410) differently from the Latin A (U+0041) -- <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> that ASCII was never intended to display both Latin and Cyrillic in the same document. Similarly, Korean encoding standards never had the aim of displaying Korean and Japanese and Chinese and Cyrillic and Ethiopian all within a single document. Almost all of the variants that the PRC developed or standardized got unique codepoints owing simply to the fortune of the Simplified Chinese transition carrying through into the computing age. This privilege however, seems to apply inconsistently. While most simplifications performed in Japan and mainland China with codepoints in national standards, including characters simplified differently in each country, did make it into Unicode as unique codepoints.|$|E
25|$|We {{look for}} a solid and impregnable barrier of the Democracies against the three Axis powers, and we refuse to accept the dictum that the Pacific {{struggle}} must {{be treated as a}} subordinate segment of the general conflict. By that it is not meant that any one of the other theatres of war is of less importance than the Pacific, but that Australia asks for a concerted plan evoking the greatest strength at the Democracies' disposal, determined upon hurling Japan back. The Australian Government, therefore regards the Pacific struggle as primarily one in which the United States and Australia must have the fullest say {{in the direction of the}} Democracies' fighting plan. Without any inhibitions of any kind, I make it clear that Australia looks to America, free of any pangs as to our traditional links or kinship with the United Kingdom. We know the problems that the United Kingdom faces. We know the dangers of dispersal of strength, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> too, that Australia can go and Britain can still hold on.

500|$|Many reviewers {{praised the}} audio for being {{especially}} vivid. Multiplayer especially was noted in {{being the best}} on Xbox Live at the time. Game Informer, along with numerous other publications, rated it higher than Halo: Combat Evolved, citing enhanced multiplayer and less repetitive gameplay. Most critics noted that Halo 2 stuck with the formula that made its predecessor successful, and was alternatively praised and faulted for this decision. Edges review concluded that Halo 2 could be summed up with a line from its script: [...] "It's not a new plan. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> it'll work." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed at the White Lodge, in Oxted, Surrey.

[...] Pemberton suggested that a partial influence for the episode {{may have been the}} children's television series Brum. He said that he and Shearsmith had [...] "always wanted to be a couple of robbers in that, so that might be where the idea came from". Both writers agreed that their roles were [...] "great to perform", and Pemberton described the resulting episode by saying that it [...] "worked out better than [...] could have dreamed".|$|E

500|$|Until {{at least}} the eighteenth century, shamanism was {{at the core of}} Manchu spiritual life and {{differentiated}} Manchus from Han Chinese even as Manchu Bannermen garrisoned in various Chinese cities were adopting many aspects of the Chinese lifestyle. In 1747 the Qianlong Emperor (r. 1735–1796) commissioned the publication of a [...] "Shamanic Code" [...] to revive and regulate shamanic practices, which he feared were becoming lost. He had it distributed to Bannermen to guide their practice, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> very little about the effect of this policy. Mongols and Han Chinese were forbidden to attend shamanic ceremonies. Partly because of their secret aspect, these rituals attracted the curiosity of Beijing dwellers and visitors to the Qing capital. Even after the [...] "Shamanic Code" [...] was translated into Chinese and published in the 1780s, outsiders had little understanding of these practices.|$|E
500|$|Calypso {{is part of}} a {{spectrum}} of similar folk and popular Caribbean styles that spans benna and mento, but remains the most prominent genre of Lesser Antillean music. Calypso's roots are somewhat unclear, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> it can be traced to 18th-century Trinidad and other Caribbean islands like Saint Lucia. Modern calypso, however, began in the 19th century, a fusion of disparate elements ranging from the masquerade song lavway, French Creole belair and the stick fighting chantwell. Calypso's early rise was closely connected with the adoption of Carnival by Trinidadian slaves, including camboulay drumming and the music masquerade processions. Popular calypso arose in the early 20th century, with the rise of internationally known calypsonians like Attila the Hun [...] and Roaring Lion. calypso remained popular throughout the Caribbean in the later 20th century, the islands began producing calypso stars. In the 1970s, a calypso variant called soca arose, characterized by a focus on dance rhythms rather than lyricism. Soca has since spread across the Caribbean and abroad.|$|E

500|$|At Trenton, Washington faced a dilemma. All but {{a handful}} of his men's enlistments were expiring on December 31, and he knew that the army would {{collapse}} unless he convinced them to stay. So, on the 30th, Washington appealed to his men to stay one month longer for a bounty of ten dollars. He asked any men who wanted to volunteer to poise their firelocks, but not a man turned out. Washington then wheeled his horse around and rode in front of the troops, saying [...] "My brave fellows, you have done all I asked you to do, and more than could be reasonably expected; but your country is at stake, your wives, your houses and all that you hold dear. You have worn yourselves out with fatigues and hardships, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> not how to spare you. If you will consent to stay only one month longer, you will render that service to the cause of liberty and to your country which you probably never can do under any other circumstances."

500|$|Regional {{variants}} {{of the word}} Allah occur in both pagan and Christian pre-Islamic inscriptions. Different theories have been proposed regarding the role of Allah in pre-Islamic polytheistic cults. Some authors have suggested that polytheistic Arabs used the name as {{a reference to a}} creator god or a supreme deity of their pantheon. The term may have been vague in the Meccan religion. According to one hypothesis, which goes back to Julius Wellhausen, Allah (the supreme deity of the tribal federation around Quraysh) was a designation that consecrated the superiority of Hubal (the supreme deity of Quraysh) over the other gods. However, there is also evidence that Allah and Hubal were two distinct deities. According to that hypothesis, the Kaaba was first consecrated to a supreme deity named Allah and then hosted the pantheon of Quraysh after their conquest of Mecca, about a century before the time of Muhammad. [...] Some inscriptions seem to indicate the use of Allah as a name of a polytheist deity centuries earlier, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> nothing precise about this use. Some scholars have suggested that Allah may have represented a remote creator god who was gradually eclipsed by more particularized local deities. There is disagreement on whether Allah {{played a major role in}} the Meccan religious cult. No iconic representation of Allah is known to have existed. [...] Muhammad's father's name was [...] meaning [...] "the slave of Allāh".|$|E
500|$|Clive Russell, who portrayed Blackfish, {{spoke about}} working with Gwendoline Christie as Brienne of Tarth, noting [...] "There's {{something}} very curious, by the way, I'm probably about 6'6" [...] tall. I think she's about 6'3", but all the time I worked with her, I {{felt like she was}} taller than me. Now I don't really know what {{that has to do with}} it. It might be something to do with being confronted by a physically charismatic very tall woman, or maybe it's that she's caught the impressiveness of the character of that woman, that soldier. She's also an extraordinarily hilarious woman. We had great fun together. It was great fun to play." [...] Gwendoline Christie also spoke about filming with Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who portrays Jaime Lannister, again, saying [...] "I was excited, It was really fun to be with Nikolaj again, and I thought the way of which their reunion happens is not really expected. I just loved that it was so formal, because within the confines of such formality, and having to negotiate with each other, there are so many other stories begging to be told in those moments. There's a slow process of creeping familiarity among two people who haven't been together for a long time; it was allowed to build." [...] Coster-Waldau also spoke about their first reunion scene, stating [...] "It's a great scene. These characters are so much about holding their cards so close to their chest and they don't want to reveal how they're feeling. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> there's history between them, that this is more than two knights meeting.

500|$|In notable {{contrast}} to his successor Stigand, Robert does not figure among the important benefactors to English churches, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> of some transfers to Jumièges of important English church treasures, the first trickle {{of what was to}} become a flood of treasure taken to Normandy after the Conquest. These included the relic of the head of Saint Valentine only recently given to the monks of Winchester Cathedral by Emma of Normandy. Though the Winchester head remained in place, another one appeared at Jumièges; he [...] "must have clandestinely removed the head, or at least the greater part of it, and left his monks to venerate the empty or nearly empty capsa". Two of the four most important surviving late Anglo-Saxon illuminated manuscripts went the same way, thus probably preventing their destruction in a series of fires that devastated the major English libraries. One is the so-called Missal of Robert of Jumièges, actually a sacramentary with thirteen surviving full-page miniatures, which bears an inscription apparently in Robert's own hand recording its donation to Jumièges when he was Bishop of London, and the other the so-called Benedictional of Archbishop Robert, actually a pontifical with three remaining full-page miniatures and other decoration (respectively Rouen, Bibliothèque Municipale, Manuscripts Y.6 and Y.7). The latter may well have been commissioned by Æthelgar, Robert's predecessor as Archbishop in 988–90, although it is possible the [...] "Archbishop Robert" [...] of the traditional name is Emma's brother Robert, Archbishop of Rouen from 990 to 1037. These masterpieces of the Winchester style were the most elaborately decorated Anglo-Saxon manuscripts known to have reached Normandy, either before or after the Conquest, and influenced the much less-developed local style, though this remained very largely restricted to initials.|$|E
