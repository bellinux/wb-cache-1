5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, the capital {{shifted to the}} newly built, well planned city of Gandhinagar. This marked {{the start of a}} long period of decline in the city, marked <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of development.|$|E

40|$|Migrants of non-Western origin often {{live among}} themselves. This {{residential}} segregation is, however, not necessarily caused <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>lacking</b> will to integrate. It rather seems {{to a large}} part explainable with the socio-economic differences between population groups. The key to successful integration of migrants into the German society thus lies in the alleviation of inequalities in respect to education, income and German language skills.

5000|$|Exocrine {{pancreatic}} dysfunction: Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency arises due to <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of acinar {{cells that}} produce digestive enzymes. These are extensively depleted and replaced <b>by</b> fat. <b>A</b> <b>lack</b> of pancreatic digestive enzymes leaves patients unable to digest and absorb fat. However, pancreatic status may improve with age in some patients.|$|R
5|$|According to Schultheiss, Herrmann, and Jonas, {{although}} Trousseau {{had earlier}} suggested that surgery was a viable option, {{there is no}} evidence that the subject subsequently received treatment; They suggest several possible factors, including legal issues, the subject's refusal, or failed treatment followed <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of reporting, for the lack of surgery or evidence of such. Maisonneuve, partially shown in one of the photographs, treated another intersex patient in 1862.|$|E
5|$|Although {{opened in}} 1800 {{at the cost}} of £100,000, the new harbour at Grimsby failed to attract the levels of trade the company had projected, caused largely <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of inland {{transport}} networks. The financial problems facing the Grimsby Haven Company led to factions and difficulty in its running and put strain on Boucherett's relations with Yarborough; having invested much money and time in the now failing company, Boucherett also found it draining of him financially.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Chen {{spent several}} months {{surveying}} residents of Shandong Province, collecting accounts of forced, late-term abortions and forced sterilization {{of women who}} stood in violation of China’s one-child policy. His survey was based in Linyi and included surrounding rural suburbs. Chen later recalled that his survey would have been significantly larger in scope were he not limited <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of financial resources.|$|E

5|$|In January 2016, Boeing {{confirmed}} {{plans to}} reduce the production rate of the 777 family from 8.3 per month to 7 per month in 2017 to help close the production gap between the 777 and 777X created <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of new orders. In 2018, assembling test 777-9 aircraft is expected to lower output to an effective rate of 5.5 per month. Boeing will drop 777 production to five per month in August 2017.|$|E
5|$|In May 2008, The Industry Standard {{remarked that}} Twitter's {{long-term}} viability is limited <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of revenue.

5|$|Joyce {{dissipated}} {{in an area}} of low {{wind shear}} and warm sea surface temperatures. The National Hurricane Center attributed the weakening to dry air from the Sahara. The dry air may have been caused <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of southwesterlies bring moisture from equatorial areas, and continental influence from South America.|$|E
50|$|<b>By</b> 1929, <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of {{investment}} {{had led to}} <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of new orders. The oncoming economic depression lead to a shut-down of the works and resultant huge redundancies, with minimal maintenance applied to the residual infrastructure. The result was that by 1934, unemployment in Ebbw Vale stood at 54% out of a population of 31,000.|$|R

5|$|Since {{the major}} {{eruption}} ~70,000 years ago, eruptions of smaller magnitude have also occurred at Toba. The small cone of Pusukbukit formed on the southwestern {{margin of the}} caldera and lava domes. The most recent eruption may have been at Tandukbenua on the northwestern caldera edge, suggested <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of vegetation that {{could be due to}} an eruption within the last few hundred years.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese force lacked for transport, {{engineer}} and logistical support and was hampered <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of cohesion {{due to its}} disparate command structure and poor infrastructure. In contrast, the Australian force had fought together in previous campaigns and was backed up by a formidable logistical support base that could deliver them a technological and industrial superiority that the Japanese were unable to match.|$|E
5|$|The entire 24th Division {{gathered}} {{to make a}} final stand around Taejon, holding a line along the Kum River {{to the east of}} the city. Hampered <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of communication and equipment, and a shortage of heavy weapons to match the KPA's firepower, the outnumbered, ill-equipped and untrained American forces were pushed back from the riverbank after several days before fighting an intense urban battle to defend the city. After a fierce three-day struggle, the Americans withdrew.|$|E

5|$|The gatehouse's eastwards-facing tower {{contains}} the chapel, an unusual arrangement driven <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of space, with a recently restored east window of reset 15th-century glass designed by Nicola Hopwood, which illuminates the priest's seat, or sedile. The 15th-century window frame itself replaced an even taller, earlier 13th-century window. The chapel's west window is modern, and commemorates British servicemen who died between 1936–76 in radar development. The altar itself is particularly old, possibly pre-dating the castle.|$|E
5|$|All {{the crew}} {{on board the}} ship {{at the time of}} the {{incident}} (41 in total) are believed to have died, although not all the bodies were found. In addition, one visitor to the ship (an officer's wife) and eight terminal workers were killed. Initial efforts to contain the fire were hampered <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of organization and poorly maintained fire-fighting equipment at the terminal. The Bantry fire brigade spent some time waiting at the town pier for a launch to take them onto the island. The terminal's own fire engine would not start. Firefighters had to break into the terminal's main depot to access materials and equipment (much of which did not work).|$|E
5|$|Although Tito's headquarters, {{along with}} several other Partisan organisations, was {{temporarily}} disrupted and key staff were lost during the operation, all Partisan organisations were quickly re-located and resumed operation. Drvar reverted to Partisan control {{within a few weeks}} of the operation. The operation was a failure, as Tito, his principal headquarters staff and the allied military personnel escaped, despite their presence in Drvar {{at the time of the}} airborne assault. The operation failed due to a number of factors, including Partisan resistance in the town itself and along the approaches to Drvar. The failure of the various German intelligence agencies to share the limited intelligence available on Tito's exact location also contributed to the unsuccessful outcome for the Germans, and this failure to share intelligence was compounded <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of contingency planning by the commander of the German airborne force.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} new {{empirical evidence}} on the international performance of Swedish economic history, spurred by the ongoing discussion about the discipline’s current and future status. The results are modest: Swedish economic historians wrote only 0. 2 % of all articles in international economic history journals since 1970, and less than 2 % of all papers presented at the largest international conferences in recent years. This low degree of internationalization can be explained <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>lacking</b> interest in writing in English and, primarily, a reluctance to use modern economic theories and statistical analysis as complements to the traditional qualitative research methods...|$|R

5|$|Body piercing, {{a form of}} body modification, is the {{practice}} of puncturing or cutting {{a part of the}} human body, creating an opening in which jewelry may be worn. The word piercing can refer to the act or practice of body piercing, or to an opening in the body created by this act or practice. Although the history of body piercing is obscured by popular misinformation and <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of scholarly reference, ample evidence exists to document that it has been practiced in various forms by both sexes since ancient times throughout the world.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its status}} an {{international}} language, English is expeditious {{when it comes}} adopting foreign words, and borrows vocabulary from {{a large number of}} other sources. Early studies of English vocabulary by lexicographers, the scholars who formally study vocabulary, compile dictionaries, or both, were impeded <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of comprehensive data on actual vocabulary in use from good-quality linguistic corpora, collections of actual written texts and spoken passages. Many statements published {{before the end of the}} 20th century about the growth of English vocabulary over time, the dates of first use of various words in English, and the sources of English vocabulary will have to be corrected as new computerised analysis of linguistic corpus data becomes available.|$|E
5|$|Each cavalry {{regiment}} was {{to consist}} of four cavalry squadrons, a machine gun squadron, and an engineer squadron. Shortly before the war, an abortive {{attempt was made to}} motorise the 1st Cavalry Division, but this was stymied <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of motor transport and the division largely remained a horsed formation throughout its existence. The 1st Cavalry Division was also never equipped with the planned motorised anti-tank battery, and the divisional artillery battalion was largely equipped with World War I-vintage pieces. Two peacetime components of the division, the 2nd Cavalry Brigade and 3rd Cavalry Regiment, were earmarked to join other formations when they were mobilised, so the primary fighting formation of the 1st Cavalry Division was the 1st Cavalry Brigade, commanding the 2nd, 6th and 8th Cavalry Regiments.|$|E
