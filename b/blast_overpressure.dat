40|$|Predicting {{potential}} {{consequences of}} Vapor Cloud Explosions (VCEs) {{has always been}} an important issue in safety assessments, because of the devastating damage that this phenomenon can create on (petro chemical) production sites. Although the TNO Multi-Energy method has been {{recognized as one of the}} best methods to predict <b>blast</b> <b>overpressures</b> of vapor cloud explosions, its application has been complicated by the required expert knowledge to choose a blast strength category and the congested fraction of the flammable cloud. In the GAME project (Guidance on Application of Multi-Energy, a contract research project for HSE), TNO already developed a quantitative method to derive the blast strength of VCEs, based on well-defined congestion area properties. Recently, this method has been extended and combined with dispersion models to derive a practical cloud coverage fraction, which is used to find the other important influencing parameter: the explosive mass of the congested part of the flammable cloud. This so-called "explosion regions" method can be used to determine the potential damage zones on a realistic site, with various potential sources of releases and multiple congestion areas or "receptors".

40|$|Despite many {{fundamental}} objections, TNT-equivalency {{methods are}} widely used for simple vapour cloud explosion blast modelling. Presently, however, the TNO Multi-Energy method is increasingly accepted as a more reasonable alternative. Applying the Multi-Energy method, blast can be modelled by the specification of an equivalent fuel-air charge, which is characterized by two parameters: a charge size and a strength. Subsequently, the blast wave parameters at any distance from the charge can be read from fuel-air blast charts. So far, the TNO user recommendations to determine charge size and strength were based on simple assumptions which {{are believed to be}} safe and conservative. If such a safe and conservative approach leads to unacceptably high <b>blast</b> <b>overpressures,</b> the user may determine a more accurate value for the charge strength by seeking correlation with available experimental data. To allow a user simple and quick access to the experimental data, a parameter combination has been devised. This parameter combination characterizes the initial and boundary conditions that largely determine the strength of a gas explosion. The parameter combination was correlated with explosion overpressures available from experimental data sets. The result is an instant data base in the form of graphs. The graphs allow a user to estimate the charge strength on the basis of experimental data...|$|R
40|$|Blast damage {{assessment}} of buildings and structural elements requires an accurate prediction {{of the blast}} loads {{in terms of the}} peak pressures and impulses. Blast loadings on structures have typically been evaluated using empirical relationships. These relationships assume that there are no obstacles between the explosive device and the target. If a blast barrier is used to protect personnel or a structure behind it, the actual blast loading environment will be significantly reduced for some distance behind the barrier. This paper is concerned with an accurate prediction of the area ofeffectiveness behind the barrier using experimental data and a neural network-based model. To train and validate the neural network, a database is developed through a series of measurements of the blast environment behind the barrier. The principal parameters controlling the blast environment, such as wall height, distance behind the wall, height above ground, and standoff distance are used as the training input data. Peak overpressure and peak scaled impulse are used as the outputs in the neural network configuration. The trained and validated neural network is used to develop contour plots of overpressure and impulse adjustment factors to simplify the process of predicting the effectiveness of blast barriers. Thedeveloped model is also deployed in a stand-alone application that is used as a fast-running predictive tool for the <b>blast</b> <b>overpressures</b> and impulses behind the wall...|$|R

Shock tube experiments were performed to generate the blast injured specimens (cadaveric Sprague-Dawley rats). <b>Blast</b> <b>overpressures</b> of 100 and 180 [*]kPa were studied. Synchrotron tomography imaging was used to capture volumetric image data of lungs. Specimens were ventilated using a custom-built system to study multiple inflation pressures during each tomography scan. These data enabled the first digital volume correlation (DVC) measurements in lung tissue to be performed. Quantitative analysis was performed to describe the damaged architecture of the lung. No clear changes in the microstructure of the tissue morphology were observed due to controlled low- to moderate-level blast exposure. However, significant focal sites of injury were observed using DVC, which allowed the detection of bias and concentration in the patterns of strain level. Morphological analysis corroborated the findings, illustrating that the focal damage caused by a blast can give rise to diffuse influence across the tissue. It is important to characterize the non-instantly fatal doses of blast, given the transient nature of blast lung in the clinical setting. This research has highlighted the need for better understanding of focal injury and its zone of influence (alveolar interdependency and neighboring tissue burden {{as a result of}} focal injury). DVC techniques show great promise as a tool to advance this endeavor, providing a new perspective on lung mechanics after blast...|$|R
40|$|As an {{asteroid}} descends toward Earth, it deposits {{energy in the}} atmosphere through aerodynamic drag and ablation. Asteroid impact risk assessments rely on energy deposition estimates to predict <b>blast</b> <b>overpressures</b> and ground damage that may result from an airburst, {{such as the one}} that occurred over Chelyabinsk, Russia in 2013. The rates and altitudes at which energy is deposited along the entry trajectory depend upon how the bolide fragments, which in turn depends upon its internal structure and composition. In this work, we have developed an analytic asteroid fragmentation model to assess the atmospheric energy deposition of asteroids with a range of structures and compositions. The modeling approach combines successive fragmentation of larger independent pieces with aggregate debris clouds released with each fragmentation event. The model can vary the number and masses of fragments produced, the amount of mass released as debris clouds, the size-strength scaling used to increase the robustness of smaller fragments, and other parameters. The initial asteroid body can be seeded with a distribution of independent fragment sizes amid a remaining debris mass to represent loose rubble pile conglomerations, can be given an outer regolith later, or can be defined as a coherent or fractured monolith. This approach enables the model to represent a range of breakup behaviors and reproduce detailed energy deposition features such as multiple flares due to successive burst events, high-altitude regolith blow-off, or initial disruption of rubble piles followed by more energetic breakup of the constituent boulders. These capabilities provide a means to investigate sensitivities of ground damage to potential variations in asteroid structure...|$|R

40|$|Recognition of {{traumatic}} brain injury (TBI) has increased due to higher rates of injuries reported in sports and veterans.

Ethical considerations {{have resulted in the}} use of anesthetics and analgesics in virtually all animal models of TBI. However, emerging evidence indicates that anesthetics may provide neuroprotection that could confound results. Therefore, I am determining the level of anesthetic induced neuroprotection in acute recovery (48 Hours) following bTBI by assessing damage sustained to the dentate gyrus, retrosplenial and visual cortices. Using a Cranium Only Blast Injury Apparatus, I delivered non-lethal <b>blast</b> <b>overpressures</b> averaging 534 kiloPascals (kPa) to five groups of adult C 57 BL/ 6 mice (control, no anesthetic, xylazine only (13 mg/kg, IP), xylazine/buprenorphine (13 mg/kg, IP and 0. 1 mg/kg, SC), and ketamine, xylazine, buprenex (75 mg/kg, IP, 13 mg/kg, IP 0. 1 mg/kg, SC). Following recovery, immunocytochemistry was used to visualize changes in: doublecortin (a marker for neurogenesis), parvalbumin and calretinin (two calcium-binding proteins), and the astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein. My preliminary results show increases in neurogenesis and differential effects of calretinin and parvalbumin in all brain regions following blast injury in the absence of anesthetic and that the use of anesthetics alters these results. Because injuries sustained in combat may not receive medical attention until 48 hours after trauma, this time point can offer valuable information regarding the specific pathways affected and the therapeutic window required for pharmacological intervention...|$|R

Australia {{has one of the highest}} levels of tunnel advance per capita per annum in the world, yet the use of underground space in our cities appears difficult for our planners and politicians to comprehend, not withstanding the general availability of good quality rock and contractor expertise in Australia. However, the lack of space in our urban areas is being highlighted as our major cities expand outwards and people and businesses gravitate towards city centres. Typical potential underground space uses include car parking, self-storage and archiving facilities, water storage, underground quarrying, small industrial facilities and another layer of traffic (electric and fuel cell) and services network. Historically, blasting in high density population areas has resulted in blast vibrations and <b>blast</b> <b>overpressures</b> exceeding the limits, which in some case have been set extremely low in terms of peak particle velocity (PPV). This makes conventional blasting difficult, often requiring low charge weights per delay and associated small blast sizes and slow advance rates.

Although more expensive than conventional blasting, excavation by blasting using these products and technologies in relatively good quality ground is believed, in most cases, to be less than the cost of mechanical excavation.

40|$|Blast-induced mild {{traumatic}} brain injury (bTBI) has become increasingly common in recent military conflicts. The mechanisms by which non-impact blast exposure results in bTBI are incompletely understood. Current small animal bTBI models predominantly utilize compressed air-driven membrane rupture as their blast wave source, while large animal models use chemical explosives. The pressure-time signature of each blast mode is unique, {{making it difficult to}} evaluate the contributions of the different components of the blast wave to bTBI when using a single blast source. We utilized a multi-mode shock tube, the McMillan blast device, capable of utilizing compressed air- and compressed helium-driven membrane rupture, and the explosives oxyhydrogen and cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX, the primary component of C- 4 plastic explosives) as the driving source. At similar maximal <b>blast</b> <b>overpressures,</b> the positive pressure phase of compressed air-driven blasts was longer, and the positive impulse was greater, than those observed for shockwaves produced by other driving sources. Helium-driven shockwaves more closely resembled RDX blasts, but by displacing air created a hypoxic environment within the shock tube. Pressure-time traces from oxyhydrogen-driven shockwaves were very similar those produced by RDX, although they resulted in elevated carbon monoxide levels due to combustion of the polyethylene bag used to contain the gases within the shock tube prior to detonation. Rats exposed to compressed air-driven blasts had more pronounced vascular damage than those exposed to oxyhydrogen-driven blasts of the same peak overpressure, indicating that differences in blast wave characteristics other than peak overpressure may influence the extent of bTBI. Use of this multi-mode shock tube in small animal models will enable comparison of the extent of brain injury with the pressure-time signature produced using each blast mode, facilitating evaluation of the blast wave components contributing to bTBI...|$|R

40|$|Blast induced {{neurotrauma}} (BINT) {{has been}} designated as the “signature injury” to warfighters in the recent military conflicts. The occurrence of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in blasts is controversial in the medical and scientific communities because the manifesting symptoms occur without visible injuries. Whether the primary blast waves alone can cause mechanical insult that is comparable to existing traumatic brain injury thresholds is still an open question, and this work is aimed to address this issue. In {{the first part of}} this dissertation, mechanics of primary blast loading on Realistic Explosive Dummy (RED) head with and without helmets is studied using experiments and a validated numerical model. It is shown that geometry of the head and helmet, their configurations and orientations with respect to the direction of the blast govern the flow dynamics around the head; these factors in turn determine the surface pressures. The blast wave can focus under the helmet if there is a gap between the head and the helmet leading to an increase in surface pressures beneath the focused regions. In the second part of this dissertation, the response of post-mortem human specimen (PMHS) heads is studied. Three PMHS heads are subjected to primary blast of varying peak incident intensities or overpressures (70 kPa, 140 kPa and 200 kPa). When the incident blast intensity is increased, there is a statistically significant increase in the peak intracranial pressure (ICP) and total impulse (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). Further, for <b>blast</b> <b>overpressures</b> of 140 kPa and 200 kPa, ICP values exceed brain injury thresholds available in the literature based on blunt impacts. From the parametric studies on the validated human head model, it is seen that the wave propagation through skin-skull-brain parenchyma plays prominent role in governing ICP-time histories. The effect of helmets on PMHS head is also analyzed. The results suggest that based only on ICP blast mitigation offered by the current helmets may be marginal, if at all.

40|$|Head {{injuries}} {{in an explosion}} occur {{as a result of}} a sudden pressure changes (e. g. shock-blast) in the atmosphere (primary injury), high velocity impacts of debris (secondary injury) and people being thrown against the solid objects (tertiary injury) in the field. In this thesis, experimental and numerical approaches are used to delineate the intracranial loading mechanics of both primary (blast) and tertiary injuries (blunt). The blast induced head injuries are simulated using a fluid-filled cylinder. This simplified model represents the head-brain complex and the model is subjected to a blast with the Friedlander waveform type of loading. We measured the temporal variations in surface pressure and strain in the cylinder and corresponding fluid pressure. Based on these data, the loading pathways from the external blast to the pressure field in the fluid are identified. The results indicate that the net loading at a given point in the fluid comprises direct transmissive loads and deflection-induced indirect loads. The study also shows that the fluid pressure (analogue of intracranial pressure) increases linearly with increase in reflected <b>blast</b> <b>overpressures</b> (ROP) for a given shell thickness. When the ROP is kept constant, fluid pressure increases linearly with the decrease in shell thickness. For understanding the blunt induced head injuries, the complaint (acrylic gel complex) and rigid (aluminum body) head surrogates with an identical mass are impacted on target surfaces of different stiffnesses. The study indicates that the acceleration field in the gel-filled head surrogate varies from coup to counter-coup region, whereas the field is uniform in the rigid surrogate. The variation in the acceleration field is influenced by the shell deformation that in turn depends on the stiffness of the target surface. Impact studies on the helmet padding currently being used by the US Army are also carried out at different loading conditions. Our results indicate that for a fixed thickness of a foam pad, an increase in the stiffness of the pad will result in the increased absorption of the impact energy. Advisor: Namas Chandr...|$|R
