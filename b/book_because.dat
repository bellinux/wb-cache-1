5|$|Brisingr is {{the third}} novel in the Inheritance Cycle by Christopher Paolini. It was {{released}} on September 20, 2008. Originally, Paolini intended to conclude the then Inheritance Trilogy in three books, but during writing the third book he decided that the series was too complex to conclude in one <b>book,</b> <b>because</b> the single book would be close to 1,500 pages long. A deluxe edition of Brisingr, which includes removed scenes and previously unseen art, was released on October 13, 2009.|$|E
5|$|Once filming on {{the movie}} was completed, Berg began to explore {{adapting}} the story for television. Berg later said he had regretted having to jettison many of the interpersonal topics from the <b>book</b> <b>because</b> of the time constraints of a feature film. Creating a TV series, particularly one based on fictional characters, allowed him to address many of those elements in-depth.|$|E
5|$|As {{the nineteenth}} century progressed, there were several other {{important}} observations about the genealogical structure of the Catalogue. In 1860 Adolf Kirchhoff noted the mass of information connected {{to the family of}} Io, a stemma which could be assigned to the third <b>book</b> <b>because</b> of an ancient citation placing Phineus, one of her descendents, there. The picture of the Catalogue that was emerging began to resemble the Bibliotheca in structure, but Theodor Bergk was the first to suggest explicitly (though in passing) that the poem might be reconstructed {{with the help of the}} mythographic work. Bergk and his contemporaries still largely followed Marckscheffel's conclusion that the Catalogue and Ehoiai were semi-distinct texts, and it was not until 1894 that Friedrich Leo finally demonstrated that these were in fact alternate titles for a single poem.|$|E

5|$|Her cell was 6 × 12ft (1.8 x 3.6m) with no window, {{containing}} a bed, toilet and sink. The jail had 30 cells {{built in a}} U shape, and although detainees could talk to one another, {{they were unable to}} see each other. Her lawyer said the guards behaved professionally, and had not tried to harass or embarrass Manning. She was allowed to walk for up to one hour a day, meals were taken in the cell, and she was shackled during visits. There was access to television when it was placed in the corridor, and she was allowed to keep one magazine and one <b>book.</b> <b>Because</b> she was in pretrial detention, she received full pay.|$|E
5|$|It is {{uncertain}} {{at what point}} among the extant fragments the division between books 1 and 2 fell, but {{at least some of}} the Aeolid families were covered in the second book. The families of Perieres, Deion and Sisyphus (in that order) were most likely found in the 2nd <b>book</b> <b>because</b> there does not appear to be enough room left in book 1 to accommodate them as a group after the children of Neleus and Pelias. It was once thought that the Ehoie of Atalanta opened the book, but recently published evidence casts doubt upon this view (see Book 3, below).|$|E
5|$|Static Shock {{had some}} {{alterations}} {{from the original}} comic <b>book</b> <b>because</b> it was oriented to a pre-teen audience. Nevertheless, the show approached several social issues, which was positively received by most television critics. Static Shock was nominated for numerous awards, including the Daytime Emmy. Some criticism was directed towards its jokes—which {{were said to be}} stale and too similar to Spider-Man style—and animation, which was said to be unnatural and overdated. The series also produced some related merchandise, which sold poorly; McDuffie cited the low sales as one of the main factors behind the series' cancellation. In spite of this, its popularity revived interest in the original Milestone comic and introduced McDuffie to the animation industry.|$|E

5|$|In 1980 Christopher Tolkien {{published}} {{a collection of}} more fragmentary material, under the title Unfinished Tales of Númenor and Middle-earth. In subsequent years (1983–1996) he {{published a}} large amount of the remaining unpublished materials, together with notes and extensive commentary, in a series of twelve volumes called The History of Middle-earth. They contain unfinished, abandoned, alternative, and outright contradictory accounts, since they were always a work in progress for Tolkien and he only rarely settled on a definitive version for any of the stories. There is not complete consistency between The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, the two most closely related works, because Tolkien never fully integrated all their traditions into each other. He commented in 1965, while editing The Hobbit for a third edition, that he would have preferred to completely rewrite the <b>book</b> <b>because</b> of the style of its prose.|$|E
5|$|When the SI {{standard}} {{was published in}} 1960, the only major Commonwealth country to have adopted the metric system was India. In 1863, the first reading of {{a bill that would}} have made the metric system compulsory passed its first reading in the House of Commons by 110 votes to 75. The bill, however, failed to make the statute <b>book</b> <b>because</b> of lack of parliamentary time. In 1965, after this and similar false starts the then Federation of British Industry informed the British Government that its members favoured the adoption of the metric system. The rationale behind the request was that 80% of British exports were to countries that used the metric system or that were considering changing to the metric system. The Board of Trade, on behalf of the Government, agreed to support a ten-year metrication programme. The government agreed to a voluntary policy requiring minimal legislation and costs to be borne where they fell. SI would be used from the outset. The rest of the Commonwealth, South Africa and Ireland followed within a few years; in some countries such as South Africa and Australia metrication was mandatory rather than voluntary.|$|E
5|$|During the 1880s, Moore {{began work}} {{on a series of}} novels in a realist style. His first novel, A Modern Lover (1883) was a three-volume work, as {{preferred}} by the circulating libraries, and deals with the art scene of the 1870s and 1880s in which many characters are identifiably real. The circulating libraries in England banned the <b>book</b> <b>because</b> of its explicit portrayal of the amorous pursuits of its hero. At this time the British circulating libraries, such as Mudie's Select Library, controlled the market for fiction and the public, who paid fees to borrow their books, expected them to guarantee the morality of the novels available. His next book, a novel in the realist style, A Mummers Wife (1885) was also regarded as unsuitable by Mudie's and W H Smith refused to stock it on their news-stalls. Despite this, during its first year of publication the book was in its fourteenth edition mainly due to the publicity stirred up by its opponents. The French newspaper Le Voltaire published it in serial form as La Femme du cabotin in July–October 1886. His next novel A Drama in Muslin was banned by Mudie's and Smith's. In response Moore declared war on the circulating libraries by publishing two provocative pamphlets; Literature at Nurse and Circulating Morals. In these, he complained that the libraries profit from salacious popular fiction while refusing to stock serious literary fiction.|$|E

5|$|For their novel, {{the group}} members {{decide to take}} the typical {{elements}} from already popular young-adult series. Homer initially suggest that they write about vampires, but Patty notes {{the fact that there}} are already so many popular novels out there in that genre. They therefore decide to write about an orphan troll who goes to a magic school located under the Brooklyn Bridge. Fantasy author Neil Gaiman overhears the team talking and offers his help writing the novel; although they allow him to join, he is only given the task of bringing food for them while they are writing. The group members quickly finish the novel, which they name The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy, and meet up with a book publishing executive for TweenLit Inc. at a book fair. Although he likes the novel, he dismisses it because it lacks a fake author with an inspirational back story. Meanwhile, Lisa is having a hard time making progress on her <b>book</b> <b>because</b> of constant distractions and quickly becomes saddened after realizing that she will never have her name on a novel. However, Homer approaches her and offers her to be the fake author of The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy. Lisa admits defeat and takes the offer. They and the rest of the crew then approach the book publishing executive again, and he decides to buy the novel for a million dollars. As the team is celebrating at Moe's Tavern, they receive an advance copy. They are shocked to discover that the publisher has replaced the troll-aspects of the story with vampires, renaming the novel The Vampire Twins of Transylvania Prep, because market testing showed that vampires are more popular than trolls.|$|E

25|$|Sedgwick and Frank's {{critique}} of Cvetkovich's first book, however, is merely {{used as a}} way to challenge the “hygiene of…antiessentialism” in poststructuralist theory. In a footnote, they state that there are numerous other theorists (including Sedgwick herself) that are more steeped in the “routines of theory” of which they accuse Cvetkovich, and who are “more directly responsible for their popularization.” However, they chose to critique Cvetkovich's <b>book</b> <b>because</b> using a new scholar's work would allow them to more “effectively defamiliarize” the “critical practices” they are challenging.|$|E

25|$|National Publications {{was looking}} for a hit to {{accompany}} their success with Detective Comics, and did not have time to solicit new material.

He found a number of adventurer stories, but needed a lead feature. Sullivan asked former coworker Sheldon Mayer if he could help. Mayer found the rejected Superman comic strips, and Sullivan told Siegel and Shuster that if they could paste them into 13 comic book pages, he would buy them.|$|E

25|$|Later in 1966, Lane {{became a}} {{full-time}} Judge of the Queen's Bench Division (with the customary Knighthood), {{as well as}} a Bencher at Gray's Inn. He delivered some notable judgments: in 1968, he awarded damages against a school for a pupil who had been injured in 'horseplay' between his peers, saying that the school had a responsibility to stop it getting out of hand; and while acting as an appeal judge, he found for the publishers of Last Exit to Brooklyn who had been convicted of publishing an obscene <b>book,</b> <b>because</b> of faults in the trial Judge's summing-up. He was picked to head the inquiry into the Staines air disaster in 1972, and concluded that the underlying cause was an undiagnosed heart condition of the pilot which impaired his judgement, coupled with the pilot's known bad temper which led to his junior crew being unwilling to challenge him.|$|E
25|$|Nebuchadnezzar is an {{important}} character in the Book of Daniel, a collection of legendary tales and visions dating from the 2nd century BC.
