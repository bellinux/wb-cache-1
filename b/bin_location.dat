To evaluate the Kandangan City solid waste transport system assisted with software ArcGIS 10 from ESRI. Solid waste generation identification results Kandangan City is 56096. 67 liters/day, which is still dominated by the composition of the household resources by 71. 93 %, but it also acquired 93 new pieces of candidates waste <b>bin</b> <b>location.</b> Then the analysis of <b>bin</b> <b>location</b> suitability of the 26 existing <b>bin</b> <b>location</b> and 93 new <b>bin</b> <b>location</b> produce 61 optimal <b>bin</b> <b>location.</b> Further analysis of the 3 pieces of existing solid waste transportation routes only 1 solid waste transportation route that need to be repaired is DA 968 AM. From the analysis of the optimal and route obtained 7 sets of transportation routes using 3 units of dump trucks. Level of service with well-managed solid waste generation indicator is 65. 03 %, an increase of 25 % compared to the existing condition which is only 40 %, in addition to compliance with service level Minimum Service Standart fields of solid waste. Based on the analysis results can be concluded evaluation of Kandangan City solid waste transportation system with the use of GIS can improve the service level solid waste management...|$|E

Eight subjects moved (self-paced) light or heavy products (0. 2 and 3. 0 kg) from a central product bin to an inner or outer order bin (at 60 or 150 cm) on the left or right side of the workstation, while movements were recorded. The outer compared to inner <b>bin</b> <b>location</b> resulted in more upper arm elevation and trunk inclination per work cycle, both in terms of number of peak values and in terms of time integrals of angles (which is a dose measure over time). Considering the peak values and time integrals per minute (instead of per work cycle), these effects are reduced, due to the higher cycle times for outer bins. Hand use (left, right or both) was not affected by order bin locations...|$|E
40|$|Spherical {{harmonic}} cross-correlation is {{a robust}} registration technique {{that uses the}} normals of two overlapping point clouds to bring them into coarse rotational alignment. This registration technique however has a high computational cost as spherical harmonics need to be calculated for every normal. By binning the normals, the computational efficiency is improved as the spherical harmonics can be pre-computed and cached at each <b>bin</b> <b>location.</b> In this paper we evaluate the efficiency and accuracy of the equiangle grid, icosahedron subdivision and the Fibonacci spiral, an approach we propose. It is found that the equiangle grid has the best efficiency as it can perform direct binning, followed by the Fibonacci spiral and then the icosahedron, all of which decrease the computational cost compared to no binning. The Fibonacci spiral produces the highest achieved accuracy of the three approaches while maintaining a low number of bins. The number of bins allowed by the equiangle grid and icosahedron are much more restrictive than the Fibonacci spiral. The performed analysis shows that the Fibonacci spiral can perform {{as well as the}} original cross-correlation algorithm without binning, while also providing a significant improvement in computational efficiency...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Enhancing the {{sustainability}} of the management of waste from Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) is becoming an increasingly important issue, globally. Using the University of the West Indies (UWI), Cave Hill campus, in Barbados as the case study HEI, and a combination of questionnaires, key informant interviews and waste audits, the study aimed to understand waste management practices on campus, {{as well as to}} gain an insight into how waste is managed at the national level. The results suggest that the key challenge facing sustainable waste management at the University and the country in general was limited financial resources. Key motivators for recycling at the UWI were its benefits to keeping the Campus clean and the generation of funds. The major barriers were a lack of motivation, high bin contamination and a lack of knowledge regarding the Recycling Initiative. <b>Bin</b> <b>location</b> {{had a significant impact on}} recyclable and contamination levels. Per capita overall and recyclable arisings at the University were 393. 93 grams and 308. 35 grams respectively.

At the national level, increased public awareness programs and involving everyone in the process were key strategies proposed to overcome the challenges...|$|E

By contrast, the Cosmic Microwave Background at z ~ 1100 {{acts as the}} point of reference {{for the growth of}} large scale structure. As a result, we find {{there is a lack of}} synergy between growth and distance measures. We show that when measuring the gravitational growth index gamma using redshift-space distortions, typically 80 % of the signal corresponds to the local growth rate at the galaxy <b>bin</b> <b>location,</b> while the remaining fraction is determined by its behaviour at higher redshifts. In order to clarify whether modified gravity may be responsible for the dark energy phenomenon, the aim is to search for a modification to the growth of structure. One might expect the magnitude of this deviation to be commensurate with the apparent dark energy density Omega_Lambda(z). This provides an incentive to study redshift-space distortions (RSD) at as low a redshift as is practical. Specifically, we find the region around z = 0. 5 offers the optimal balance of available volume and signal strength. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figures, changes reflect published versio...|$|E

Solid waste management {{is not just a}} technical issue but it also has socio-political and cultural dimensions that need solution through policies, administration, re-orientation, organizational arrangements. The important thing is that the total solid waste generated is not equal to the solid waste reached to the dumping site. This study includes the details about total quantity of solid waste produced, its collection, physical structure, and transference, treating and dumping of solid waste in Rawalpindi city. Its focuses GIS based Solid Waste Management through Collection and Routing.

GIS use to locate the position of waste bins is based on suitable space to households, maximum service coverage. A <b>bin</b> <b>location</b> point covers the built up areas.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{development}} of digital audio watermarking in addressing issues such as copyright protection. Over the past two decades, many digital watermarking algorithms have been developed, {{each with its own}} advantages and disadvantages. The main aim of this thesis was to develop a new watermarking algorithm within an existing Fast Fourier Transform framework. This resulted in {{the development of}} a Complex Spectrum Phase Evolution based watermarking algorithm. In this new implementation, the embedding positions were generated dynamically thereby rendering it more difficult for an attacker to remove, and watermark information was embedded by manipulation of the spectral components in the time domain thereby reducing any audible distortion. Further improvements were attained when the embedding criteria was based on <b>bin</b> <b>location</b> comparison instead of magnitude, thereby rendering it more robust against those attacks that interfere with the spectral magnitudes. However, it was discovered that this new audio watermarking algorithm has some disadvantages such as a relatively low capacity and a non-consistent robustness for different audio files. Therefore, a further aim of this thesis was to improve the algorithm from a different perspective. Improvements were investigated using an Singular Value Decomposition framework wherein a novel observation was discovered. Furthermore, a psychoacoustic model was incorporated to suppress any audible distortion. This resulted in a watermarking algorithm which achieved a higher capacity and a more consistent robustness. The overall result was that two new digital audio watermarking algorithms were developed which were complementary in their performance thereby opening more opportunities for further research...|$|E
