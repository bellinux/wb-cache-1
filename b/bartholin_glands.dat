50|$|<b>Bartholin</b> <b>gland</b> {{carcinoma}} is {{an uncommon}} type of malignancy in the <b>Bartholin</b> <b>gland</b> {{that accounts for}} 1% of all vulvar malignant neoplasms. It is most common in women in their mid-60s. The tumor can become large before a woman is aware of symptoms. One of the first symptoms can be dyspareunia. In other instances a woman may find a mass or ulcer in the vulva area. Many clincians assume that an enlarged <b>Bartholin</b> <b>gland</b> is malignant in postmenopausal woman until proven otherwise. The growth of the tumor can spread to nearby {{areas such as the}} ischiorectal fossa and inguinal lymph nodes. Approximately 50% of <b>bartholin</b> <b>gland</b> carcinomas originate from squamous cell carcinomas. Another uncommon characteristic of <b>Bartholin</b> <b>gland</b> malignancies is that the growth of a lesion originates from the three types of epithelial tissue present in the gland: mucinous, transitional, and squamous.|$|R

40|$|Study Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} CO 2 laser treatment and parameters correlated with recurrence in patients with <b>Bartholin</b> <b>gland</b> abscesses treated using this approach. Design: Prospective study (Canadian Task Force classification II- 2). Setting: University hospital. Patients: One hundred forty-seven patients who met eligibility criteria. Intervention: Preoperative ultrasound evaluation of <b>Bartholin</b> <b>gland</b> lesions and CO 2 laser treatment. Measurements and Main Results: All patients received CO 2 laser therapy, with median operative time 15 minutes (range, 12 - 35 minutes). Median postoperative stay was 1 hours (range, 1 - 4 hours). Estimated 3 -year relapse-free rate was 88. 56 %. Lesion wall thickness 0. 5 - 1. 5 mm, multilocular lesion, and hyperechogenic lesion were correlated with recurrence. Conclusion: CO 2 laser of <b>Bartholin</b> <b>gland</b> abscesses could be a valid option.

50|$|A vestibulectomy is a {{gynecological}} {{surgical procedure}} {{that can be}} used to treat vulvar pain and vulvar vestibulitis. The amount of tissue removed during the surgery can vary.

The structures removed are the hymen, mucous membrane, <b>Bartholin</b> <b>glands</b> ducts and minor vestibular glands. In some surgeries, the amount of tissue removed is not so extensive.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{measure the}} {{prevalence}} of gonorrhoea in Ethiopian women attending gynaecologic, obstetric and family planning clinics: to determine the reliability of patient self history of sexually transmitted disease (STD); to correlate the serological diagnosis of gonorrhoea with clinical evidence of pelvic infection in order to define a reliable clinical diagnosis of gonorrhoea {{in a country where}} pelvic inflammatory disease is very common but where routine laboratory culture and serological tests for gonorrhoea are unavailable. SUBJECTS [...] 1851 Ethiopian women: 50 % symptomatic, 50 % asymptomatic. SETTING [...] Gynaecological outpatient department, antenatal, postnatal and family planning clinics (Ethiopian Family Guidance Association (EFGA)), in two teaching hospitals and a mother and child health centre in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. METHODS [...] The indirect haemagglutination test with gonococcal pilus antigen as an epidemiological tool was used in a cross-section study to screen 1851 sera for evidence of past or current gonococcal infection. The gonococcal antibody test (GAT) seropositivity was correlated with patient's history of STD, age, clinic attended and the clinical evidence of infection in "gonococcal target organs" urethra, salpinges or <b>Bartholin</b> <b>glands.</b> RESULTS [...] Fifty nine per cent of the study group were seropositive for the gonococcal antibody test, 22 % with titres {{greater than or equal to}} 1 / 320, indicative of current, recent or recurrent infection. Seropositivity indicating past or present gonococcal infection was highest in those who gave a history of having had treated syphilis (85 %), in women aged 40 - 49 (72 %), and family planning attenders (EFGA) (66 %) of whom 31 % had titres greater than or equal to 1 / 320. Fifty per cent had clinical evidence of past or present infection in the urethra, salpinges or <b>Bartholin</b> <b>glands.</b> Gonococcal antibodies were present in 54 % of women with no evidence of clinical infection, compared with 91 % of those with pyosalpinx and 86 % of those with triple infection of urethra, salpinges and <b>Bartholin</b> <b>glands.</b> CONCLUSION [...] The high prevalence of gonococcal antibodies in Ethiopian women, especially in asymptomatic clinic attenders must be of concern for all health workers especially those in gynaecology and obstetrics and the related disciplines of family planning and neonatal paediatrics. While seropositivity was highest in those giving a past history of syphilis, the patient's history of STD was unreliable, as of those who denied having any history of STD, fifty per cent were GAT seropositive. Despite a high correlation between GAT seropositivity with pyosalpinx and clinical evidence of infection in urethra, salpinges and <b>bartholin</b> <b>glands,</b> gonococcal antibodies were present in 54 % of women with no clinical evidence of infection.

The thesis on " Women´s awareness on {{prevention and treatment}} possibilities for vulvovaginal infections was worked out by a research technique. The thesis {{is divided into two}} sections [...] theoretical and practical. The theoretical section is subdivided into thirteen main chapters. The introduction gives information on the current state of knowledge and is followed by a brief description of external and internal female genitals. Much attention is paid to pathophysiology of vulvovaginal infections and their classification. The issues of viral vulnovaginitis and <b>Bartholin</b> <b>glands</b> inflammation are not omitted. In the main chapter diagnostic possibilities and methods in the treatment of vulvovaginal infections and diagnostic criteria are surveyed. Another chapter deals with therapy of vulvovaginal infections mentioned and the description of supportive preparatives used to stabilize vaginal medium. An important part of the thesis is a chapter giving account of prevention possibilities and the role of a midwife in nursing care for a woman suffering from gynaecological inflammations mentioned. In the final chapter information on the nursing process in women with inflammatory diseases of vulva and vagina is given. The objective of the thesis was to learn about the awareness of prevention possibilities and treatment of vulvovaginal infections in women of reproductive age. Two hypotheses were stated: Hypothesis 1 assumed that women are not informed about vulvovaginal infections possible prevention. Hypothesis 2 assumed that women are informed about the possibilities of vulvovaginal infections treatment. To verify or reject the hypotheses the questionnaire method was used.

40|$|Objective To compare {{recurrence}} of a cyst or abscess of the <b>Bartholin</b> <b>gland</b> after surgical treatment using a Word catheter or marsupialisation. Design Multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial. Setting Eighteen {{hospitals in the}} Netherlands and one hospital in England. Population Women with a symptomatic cyst or abscess of the <b>Bartholin</b> <b>gland.</b> Methods Women were randomised to treatment with Word catheter or marsupialisation. Main outcome measures The primary outcome was {{recurrence of}} the cyst or abscess within 1 year of treatment. The secondary outcomes included pain during and after treatment (measured on a 10 -point scale), use of analgesics, and time from diagnosis to treatment. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. To assess whether marsupialisation would reduce the recurrence rate by 5 %(from 20 to 15 %) we needed to include 160 women (alpha error 0. 05, beta error 0. 2). Results One hundred and sixty-one women were randomly allocated to treatment by Word catheter (n = 82) or marsupialisation (n = 79) between August 2010 and May 2014. Baseline characteristics were comparable. Recurrence occurred in 10 women (12 %) allocated to Word catheter versus eight women (10 %) allocated to marsupialisation: relative risk (RR) 1. 1, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 64 - 1. 91; P = 0. 70. Pain scores after treatment were also comparable. In the first 24 hours after treatment, 33 % used analgesics in the Word catheter group versus 74 % in the marsupialisation group (P < 0. 001). Time from diagnosis to treatment was 1 hour for placement of Word catheter versus 4 hours for marsupialisation (P = 0. 001).
