50|$|Inboard of {{the sheer}} strake the heavier gunwale is {{similarly}} bent in along the line {{of the sheer}}. This part of the work is finished by fitting the <b>breast</b> <b>hook</b> and quarter knees. Swivel or crutch chocks are fitted as appropriate to the gunwale, the thwarts fitted down onto the rising and held in position by knees up to the gunwale and perhaps down onto the stringer. The structure of gunwale, rising, thwart and thwart knees greatly stiffens and strengthens the shell and turns it into a boat. There are several ways of fixing the rubbing strake but in a clinker boat, it is applied to the outside of the sheer strake.|$|E

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate performance, mortality and incidence of lesions on the <b>breasts,</b> <b>hooks</b> and foot pads of broilers raised on wood-scrap litter, rice hulls, Brachiaria hey (Brachiaria decumbens), Napier hay (Pennisetum purpureum) and Coast-cross hay (Cynodon dactylon). A randomized experimental design with five litters, two sexes, four replications and fifty birds per box was used. A standard litter height of 5 cm of wood-scraps and a weight of 20 250 g were adopted as criteria for use of other materials in the boxes. The amount of excreta deposited was 1697 g per raised bird (34, 00 % of feed consumption). The incidence of lesions was evaluated in five birds per box after 35, 42 and 49 days and after slaughter. The criteria for scoring lesions were: 0 = without lesion; 1 = inflammation; 2 = mild ulceration; 3 = severe ulceration. At the end of experimental period (49 days) no differences were observed For weight, weight gain, feed consumption, feed/gain ratio and mortality among treatments. The lesions of the hocks and foot pads of the birds, raised on either Coast-cross hay and Napier hay, were more severe than those on wood-scraps and Brachiaria hay. Males showed better performance than females, but their hock lesions were more severe, independent of the litter used. Based on the performance and lesions scores, {{it was concluded that}} Braquiaria hay could be used as litter in replace wood-scraps and rice bulls...|$|R

Methods: This was a descriptive study conducted at the Department of Radiology, Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi. All patients undergoing needle localization biopsy of a nonpalpable breast lesion under mammographic or ultrasound guidance between January 2009 to December 2010 were included in the study. Patients with incomplete medical records were excluded. All patients&rsquo; mammograms or ultrasound were categorized using BI-RADS&reg; assessment categories. The percentages of benign and malignant lesions were determined by pathological examination of surgically removed specimens. A correlation was sought between preoperative imaging assessment and the final diagnosis. The complications associated with the procedure were also recorded. Results: A total of 151 biopsies were carried out, of which 80 were performed under mammographic guidance and 71 were performed under ultrasound guidance. The mean age of the patients was 51. 89 years. The overall malignancy rate was 25. 16 %. Of 93 cases reported radiologically as malignant, 60 turned out to be malignant, and of the 58 cases reported as benign on imaging, three proved to be malignant on histopathology. The sensitivity of imaging findings was 95 % and the specificity was 62 %. The malignancy rate was 5 % for benign lesions and 64 % for malignant lesions, respectively. There were no complications related to wire localization, and only two patients had minor complications following surgical excision, giving a complication rate of 1. 32 %. Conclusion: Hook wire localization biopsy is a safe and effective procedure for definitive diagnosis of suspicious lesions on imaging, and is more helpful if the imaging findings are suspicious.
