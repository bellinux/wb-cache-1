5|$|The monks of Glastonbury used {{to claim}} that during the sack of Canterbury by the Danes in 1012, Dunstan's <b>body</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> carried for safety to their abbey.

5|$|A {{few months}} later, Olbers was again {{attempting}} to locate Ceres {{when he noticed}} another moving object in the vicinity. This was the asteroid Pallas, coincidentally passing near Ceres at the time. The discovery of this object created interest in the astronomy community. Before this point it had been speculated by astronomers {{that there should be}} a planet in the gap between Mars and Jupiter. Now, unexpectedly, a second such <b>body</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> found. When Pallas was discovered, some estimates of its size were as high as 3,380km in diameter. Even as recently as 1979, Pallas was estimated to be 673km in diameter, 26% greater than the currently accepted value.|$|E

5|$|Carbon dating {{carried out}} at the University of Edinburgh dated the skull to between 1650 and 1880, while {{the fact that it}} had been {{deposited}} on top of a layer of Victorian tiles suggested that it belonged to the end of this era. The skull had fracture marks consistent with Webster's account of throwing Thomas down the stairs, and it was found to have low collagen levels, consistent with it being boiled. In July 2011, the coroner concluded that the skull was indeed that of Thomas. DNA testing was not possible as she had died childless and no relatives could be traced; in addition, there was no record of where the rest of her <b>body</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> buried.|$|E

5|$|Even {{in studies}} {{restricted}} to postsynaptic events, investigators have not determined {{the location of}} the protein synthesis that underlies L-LTP. Specifically, it is unclear whether protein synthesis takes place in the postsynaptic cell body or in its dendrites. Despite having observed ribosomes (the major components of the protein synthesis machinery) in dendrites as early as the 1960s, prevailing wisdom was that the cell body was the predominant site of protein synthesis in neurons. This reasoning was not seriously challenged until the 1980s, when investigators reported observing protein synthesis in dendrites whose connection to their cell <b>body</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> severed. More recently, investigators have demonstrated that this type of local protein synthesis is necessary for some types of LTP.|$|E
5|$|Harold's {{body was}} {{identified}} {{the day after}} the battle, either through his armour or marks on his body. The English dead, who included some of Harold's brothers and his housecarls, were left on the battlefield. Gytha, Harold's mother, offered the victorious duke the weight of her son's body in gold for its custody, but her offer was refused. William ordered that Harold's body was to be thrown into the sea, but whether that took place is unclear. Waltham Abbey, which had been founded by Harold, later claimed that his <b>body</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> secretly buried there.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, Dr. Don Gregorio Chil y Naranjo {{discovered}} several incisions in some mummies that he speculated {{may have}} been used to remove the internal organs. Don Brothwell's work in 1969 confirmed that evisceration was a method used by the Guanche. Along with a team of other scientists, Brothwell conducted a pathological examination of a Guanche mummy. The examination revealed that the <b>body</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> eviscerated, then the abdominal and thoracic cavities had been packed with a mud-like substance that contained the bark of a pine tree. Some sort of packing was also applied subcutaneously, but the exact make-up of this particular embalming substance is unknown.|$|E

5|$|In 1995, Tomás Eloy Martínez {{published}} Santa Evita, a fictionalized work propounding {{many new}} {{stories about the}} escapades of the corpse. Allegations that her body was the object of inappropriate attentions are derived from his description of an 'emotional necrophilia' by embalmers, Coronel Koenig and his assistant Arancibia. Many primary and secondary references to his novel have inaccurately stated that her <b>body</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> defiled in some way resulting in the widespread belief in this myth. Also included are allegations that many wax copies had been made, that the corpse had been damaged with a hammer, {{and that one of}} the wax copies was the object of an officer's sexual attentions.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Major Ken Quesada (Kevin Dunn) {{immediately}} {{sets up a}} {{press conference}} and assigns Martin responsibility over the briefing session for the following day. Rustin continues the investigation at a bar that evening and asks two prostitutes—Anette (Charleigh Harmon) and Lucy (Alyshia Ochse)—about any disappearances, but to no avail. By the next morning, there were several breakthroughs in the investigation: the <b>body</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> successfully identified as 28-year-old Dora Lange; an autopsy revealed she had been strangled, tortured, and possibly raped; and early toxicology reports found traces of lysergic acid and methamphetamine in her bloodstream. Martin, Rustin, and Quesada brief their colleagues with the new evidence.|$|E

While the Rippers turn the tide of the battle, Jet Girl kills Sergeant Small (Don Harvey), who had earlier sexually harassed her. Kesslee reveals that Sam is in the pipe, her life {{endangered}} by rising water. Tank Girl uses her tank to kill Kesslee, then pulls Sam out of the pipe. The film ends with an animated sequence showing water starting to flow freely. Tank Girl drives down rapids, pulling Booga behind on water-skis, then takes them over a waterfall, shouting for joy.|$|E
5|$|After Lavasani's <b>body</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> recovered, Sir David McNee, Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, {{contacted}} the Home Secretary to request approval to hand {{control of the}} operation over to the British Army, under the provisions of Military Aid to the Civil Power. Whitelaw relayed the request to Thatcher, {{and the prime minister}} agreed immediately. Thus John Dellow, the ranking police officer at the embassy, signed over control of the operation to Lieutenant Colonel Mike Rose at 19:07, authorising Rose to order an assault at his discretion. Meanwhile, the police negotiators began stalling Oan. They offered concessions in order to distract him and prevent him killing further hostages, buying time for the SAS to make its final preparations for the now-inevitable assault.|$|E
5|$|Black's fellow Group members {{arrive to}} help, {{though he had}} not yet {{contacted}} any of them. They set up roadblocks throughout the city but are unsuccessful in finding Catherine. Black returns home, where his colleague Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) tells him about trying to conceive a son with his wife. Watts had once been assigned to a child-murder case in which the dismembered infant's <b>body</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> found in a cooler. He believed that God would reward him with his longed-for son if he could find the killer—years later, he still only has his three daughters, which has caused him to realize it is impossible to sacrifice one thing to gain another. Watts then has a Group member install software on Black's computer, allowing him access to sensitive documents—Black comments that he thought he already had full access before. Watts also explains that the Group's interest in Black is the reason for the Polaroid Man's actions. Elsewhere, the Polaroid Man ties up Catherine in a dark room.|$|E
