2500|$|In the <b>brokerage</b> <b>business,</b> soft dollars {{have been}} in use for many years. Prior to May 1, 1975—sometimes {{referred}} to as [...] "May Day"—all brokerage firms used a fixed price commission schedule published by the New York Stock Exchange; the schedule was a matrix listing the number of shares in the trade on one axis, the stock's price per share on the other axis, and the corresponding commission charge in {{the cells of the}} matrix.

40|$|We {{examine whether}} {{conflicts}} of interest with investment banking and <b>brokerage</b> <b>businesses</b> induce sell-side analysts to issue optimistic stock recommendations and, if so, whether investors are misled by such biases. Using quantitative measures of potential conflicts constructed from a novel data set containing revenue breakdowns of analyst employers, we find that recommendation levels are indeed positively related to conflict magnitudes. The optimistic bias stemming from investment banking conflicts was especially pronounced during the late- 1990 s stock market bubble. However, evidence from the response of stock prices and trading volumes to upgrades and downgrades suggests that the market recognizes analysts' conflicts and properly discounts analysts' opinions. This pattern persists even during the bubble period. Moreover, the 1 -year stock performance following revised recommendations is unrelated to the magnitude of conflicts. Overall, our findings {{do not support the}} view that conflicted analysts are able to systematically mislead investors with optimistic stock recommendations. (c) 2008 by The University of Chicago.
