60|$|Pausing in her troubled march, {{she swept}} away the curtain swaying {{in the wind}} and looked out, as if imploring help from Nature, the great mother of us all. A summer moon rode high in a {{cloudless}} heaven, and far as eye could reach stretched the green wilderness of a Cuban cafetal. No forest, but a tropical orchard, rich in lime, <b>banana,</b> <b>plantain,</b> palm, and orange trees, under whose protective shade grew the evergreen coffee plant, whose dark-red berries are the fortune of their possessor, and the luxury of one-half the world. Wide avenues diverging from the mansion, with its belt of brilliant shrubs and flowers, formed shadowy vistas, along which, on the wings of the wind, came a breath of far-off music, like a wooing voice; for the magic of night and distance lulled the cadence of a Spanish contradanza to a trance of sound, soft, subdued, and infinitely sweet. It was a southern scene, but not a southern face that looked out upon it with such unerring glance; there was no southern languor in the figure, stately and erect; no southern swarthiness on fairest cheek and arm; no southern darkness in the shadowy gold of the neglected hair; the light frost of northern snows lurked in the features, delicately cut, yet vividly alive, betraying a temperament ardent, dominant, and subtle. For passion burned in the deep eyes, changing their violet to black. Pride sat on the forehead, with its dark brows; all a woman's sweetest spells touched the lips, whose shape was a smile; and in the spirited carriage of the head appeared the freedom of an intellect ripened under colder skies, the energy of a nature that could wring strength from suffering, and dare to act where feebler souls would only dare desire.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Most nations, whether {{economically}} advanced or {{at different}} stages of development are faced with the problem of disposal and treatment of wastes. Wastes could be treated in several ways (e. g. by reducing its bulk or by recovering and reprocessing it into useful substance) to meet sanitary standards. Ethanol fermented from renewable sources for fuel or fuel additives are known as bio-ethanol. In Nigeria, many food crops have been specifically grown for the production of bio-ethanol. However, bio-ethanol production from waste materials removed from fruits is very rare. In the present study, wastes from fruits such as <b>banana,</b> <b>plantain</b> and pineapple peels which are in abundance and do not interfere with food security were subjected to simultaneous saccharification and fermentation for 7 days by co–culture of Aspergillus niger and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Biomass yield, cell dry weight, reducing sugar concentration and the ethanol yield were determined at 24 hours interval. The results of the study showed that after 7 days of fermentation, pineapple peels had the highest biomass yield of 1. 89 (OD), followed by banana peels 1. 60 (OD), while plantain peels had the least 0. 98 (OD). The reducing sugar concentrations ranged between 0. 27 – 0. 94 mg/cm 3 for pineapple, 0. 20 – 0. 82 mg/cm 3 for banana and 0. 16 – 0. 45 mg/cm 3 The optimal ethanol yields were 8. 34 % v/v, 7. 45 % v/v and 3. 98 % v/v for pineapple, banana and plantain peels respectively. These indicate that pineapple and banana peels ethanol yields were significantly higher (P< 0. 05) than plantain peel ethanol yield. The findings {{of this study suggest that}} wastes from fruits that contain fermentable sugars can no longer be discarded into our environment, but should be converted to useful products like bio-ethanol that can serve as alternative energy source.

40|$|Sustainable {{production}} of <b>banana,</b> <b>plantain</b> and enset in Africa {{is crucial to}} secure food and provide income to millions of people.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Changes in the {{nutrient}} composition during storage of plantain, banana, yam and cocoyam using different storage {{methods have been}} investigated. It {{has been shown that}} there was an increase in moisture content of banana and plantain during storage in open air, (28. 2 ± 0. 10 to 30. 2 ± 0. 03 % for banana and 31. 6 ± 0. 18 to 34. 1 ± 02 % for plantain) after 9 days of storage. These were followed by a slight decrease in the deep refrigerator storage and then an over all increase in the deep freezer storage [...] Small changes were observed in crude protein and ether extracts during open air storage of banana and plantain as well as yam and cocoyam. A general trend of lowest nutrient values during deep freezer storage has been observed. It thus seems that storage of <b>banana,</b> <b>plantain</b> is better in a refrigerator than open air probably due to the minimized nutrient loss caused by metabolic activities such as respiration and sprouting. It should however be noted that for these food items, open air storage was in fact better than deep-freezer storage provided consumption is hastened since the deep freezer subjected the food stuffs to chilling injury and nutrient loss...|$|E
40|$|The ancient soilborne plant {{vascular}} pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum {{has evolved}} and adapted to cause severe damage in an unusually {{wide range of}} plants. In order to better describe and understand these adaptations, strains with very similar lifestyles and host specializations are grouped into ecotypes. We used comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to investigate three particular ecotypes in the American phylotype II group: (i) brown rot strains from phylotypes IIB- 1 and IIB- 2, historically known as race 3 biovar 2 and clonal; (ii) new pathogenic variants from phylotype IIB- 4 NPB that lack pathogenicity for banana but can infect many other plant species; and (iii) Moko disease-causing strains from phylotypes IIB- 3, IIB- 4, and IIA- 6, historically known as race 2, that cause wilt on <b>banana,</b> <b>plantain,</b> and Heliconia spp. We compared the genomes of 72 R. solanacearum strains, mainly from the three major ecotypes of phylotype II, using a newly developed pangenomic microarray to decipher their population structure and gain clues about the epidemiology of these ecotypes. Strain phylogeny and population structure were reconstructed. The results revealed a phylogeographic structure within brown rot strains, allowing us to distinguish European outbreak strains of Andean and African origins. The pangenomic CGH data also demonstrated that Moko ecotype IIB- 4 is phylogenetically distinct from the emerging IIB- 4 NPB strains. These findings improved {{our understanding of the}} epidemiology of important ecotypes in phylotype II and will be useful for evolutionary analyses and the development of new DNA-based diagnostic tools.

40|$|This work {{aimed to}} study the in vitro colonic {{fermentation}} profile of unavailable carbohydrates of two different kinds of unripe banana flour and to evaluate their postprandial glycemic responses. The unripe banana mass (UBM), obtained from the cooked pulp of unripe bananas (Musa acuminata, Nanico variety), and the unripe banana starch (UBS), obtained from isolated starch of unripe <b>banana,</b> <b>plantain</b> type (Musa paradisiaca) in natura, were studied. The fermentability of the flours was evaluated by different parameters, using rat inoculum, {{as well as the}} glycemic response produced after the ingestion by healthy volunteers. The flours presented high concentration of unavailable carbohydrates, which varied in the content of resistant starch, dietary fiber and indigestible fraction (IF). The in vitro colonic fermentation of the flours was high, 98 % for the UBS and 75 % for the UBM when expressed by the total amount of SCFA such as acetate, butyrate and propionate in relation to lactulose. The increase in the area under the glycemic curve after ingestion of the flours was 90 % lower for the UBS and 40 % lower for the UBM than the increase produced after bread intake. These characteristics highlight the potential of UBM and UBS as functional ingredients. However, in vivo studies are necessary in order to evaluate the possible benefic effects of the fermentation on intestinal health.
