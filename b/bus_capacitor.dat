40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the major issues}} {{that exist in the}} single-stage ac/dc converters with power factor correction (PFC) and presents a novel converter based on a quasi-active PFC scheme. Two additional windings wound in the transformer of a conventional dc/dc flyback converter are used to drive and achieve continuous current mode operation of an input inductor. In addition, direct energy transfer paths are provided through the additional windings to improve the conversion efficiency and to reduce the dc <b>bus</b> <b>capacitor</b> voltage below 450 V for universal line applications. The proposed converter can be easily designed to comply with IEC 61000 - 3 - 2 Class D requirement and to achieve fast output voltage regulation. By properly tuning the converter parameters, a good tradeoff between efficiency, dc <b>bus</b> <b>capacitor</b> voltage stress, and harmonic content can be achieved.

40|$|Accurate {{identification}} of DC fink ripple current {{is an important}} part of switched power converter design, since the spectral content of this current impacts on DC <b>bus</b> <b>capacitor</b> lifetime, the stability of the converter control and the EMI performance of the system. Conventionally the RMS magnitude of the ripple current is used to evaluate this impact, but this approach does not readily differentiate between PWM strategies, and can be challenging to evaluate for more complex converter topologies. This paper presents a new generalized approach that analytically determines the harmonic spectrum of the DC link and DC <b>bus</b> <b>capacitor</b> currents for any voltage-source switched converter topology. The principle of the strategy is that the product of a phase leg switching function and its load current in the time domain, which defines the switched current flowing through the phase leg, can be evaluated in the frequency domain by convolving the spectra of these two time varying functions. Since PWM has a discrete line frequency spectrum, this convolution evaluates as an infinite summation in the frequency domain, which reduces to a simple frequency shift of the PWM spectrum when the load current is assumed to be a fundamental single frequency sinusoid. Hence the switched currents flowing through the phase legs of an inverter can be evaluated as a summation of harmonics for any PWM strategy or inverter topology, and can then be readily combined using superposition to determine the DC link and DC <b>bus</b> <b>capacitor</b> currents. The analytical approach has been verified against experimental results for an extensive range of two-level and multi-level converter topologies and PWM strategies...|$|E
40|$|Permanent magnet {{synchronous}} machines (PMSMs) {{are widely}} used in electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles to propel the wheels. Various control strategies {{have been developed for}} PMSM drive systems to achieve both high efficiency and safe operation. In a PMSM drive system, generally the high voltage battery and the power converters are connected by a relay. In vehicle key-off events, although the battery is isolated immediately from the relay, the DC bus filter capacitor has to be discharged as quickly as possible to avoid an electrical hazard. This research explores the DC <b>bus</b> <b>capacitor</b> discharge of PMSM drive systems for hybrid/electric vehicles. Based on analyzing the power flow during discharge, a three-stage discharge algorithm has been developed, including a fast discharge stage, a DC bus voltage closed-loop regulation stage, and an inverter shutdown stage.

40|$|Connecting {{converters}} in cascade is a {{basic configuration}} of dc distributed power systems (DPS). The impedance interaction between individually designed converters may make the cascaded system unstable. The previous presented approaches of stabilizing the cascaded systems need to modify the source and/or load converter's internal structure such as the topology and control circuit that are contradictory to the modularization characteristic of dc DPS. In this paper, an adaptive active capacitor converter (AACC) is introduced to stabilize the cascaded system. The AACC is connected in parallelwith the cascaded system's intermediate bus and only needs to detect the bus voltage without any change of the existing subsystems. Hence, it can be designed as a standard module for dc DPS. The AACC serves as an equivalent <b>bus</b> <b>capacitor</b> to reduce the output impedance of the source converter, thus avoiding the intersection with the load converter's input impedance, and as a result, the cascaded system becomes stable. The equivalent <b>bus</b> <b>capacitor</b> emulated by the AACC is adaptive according to the output power of the cascaded system, and thus, the power loss of AACC is minimized and the dynamic response {{of the system is}} better than that of the system using a passive capacitor. Furthermore, since no electrolytic capacitor is needed in the AACC, the cascaded system's lifetime is prolonged. The operation principle, control, and design consideration of the AACC are discussed in this paper, and a 480 W cascaded system comprising two phase-shifted full-bridge converters has been built and evaluated.

The energy conversion efficiency, power loss modelling and control of these topologies are investigated in this work. With regard to the cascaded two-stage dc/dc converters, this thesis demonstrates the relationship between the overall conversion efficiency and the dc <b>bus</b> <b>capacitor</b> ripple current. The ripple current can be reduced by controlling the phase-shift of duty cycles of the active switches. By doing this, the efficiency can be improved and the capacitor lifetime can be prolonged.
