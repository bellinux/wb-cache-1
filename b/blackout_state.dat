40|$|UDP {{traffic is}} a part of the {{aggregate}} traffic over InterPlaNetary Internet backbone links, which includes planet images and multimedia data from some scientific observations. Existing rate control schemes cannot solve the rate control problem in InterPlaNetary Internet which is characterized by extremely long propagation delays, high link errors, asymmetrical bandwidth, and blackouts. In this paper, a rate control protocol, RCP-Planet, is proposed to address all the above challenges. RCP-Planet consists of two novel algorithms, i. e. Begin State and Operational State. The protocol is based on a novel rate probing mechanism, i. e. sending probing sequences to capture the available bandwidth. A new rate control scheme is designed to update the transmission rate based on the observed rate for the probing sequence. Tornado codes are used for packet-level FEC because of their fast encoding and decoding speed. Bandwidth asymmetry problem is addressed by FEC block-level ACKs. Moreover, RCP-Planet incorporates <b>Blackout</b> <b>State</b> into the protocol to improve performance in blackout conditions. Simulation results show that RCP-Planet achieves high throughput performance, fairness, and is delay tolerant. Copyright # 2007 Joh...|$|E
40|$|Satellite IP {{networks}} {{are characterized by}} high bit error rates, long propagation delays, low bandwidth feedback links, and persistent fades resulting from varying weather patterns. A new unicast transport protocol is designed to address all the above challenges. Two new algorithms, Jump Start and Quick Recovery, are presented to replace the traditional Slow Start algorithm and to recover rapidly from multiple segment losses within one window of data. The characteristics of satellite IP networks also distinguish satellite multicasting from multicasting in terrestrial wirelined networks. A reliable data multicast transport protocol, TCP-Peachtree, is proposed to solve the acknowledgment implosion and scalability problems in satellite IP networks. Developments in space technology are enabling the realization of deep space missions. The scientific data from these missions need to be delivered to the Earth successfully. To achieve this goal, the InterPlaNetary Internet is proposed as the Internet of the deep space planetary networks, which is characterized by extremely high propagation delays, high link errors, asymmetrical bandwidth, and blackouts. A reliable transport protocol, TP-Planet, is proposed for data traffic in the InterPlaNetary Internet. TP-Planet deploys rate-based additive-increase multiplicative-decrease (AIMD) congestion control and replaces the inefficient slow start algorithm with a novel Initial State algorithm that allows the capture of link resources in a very fast and controlled manner. A new congestion detection and control mechanism is developed and a <b>Blackout</b> <b>State</b> is incorporated into the protocol operation. Multimedia traffic is also {{one part of the}} aggregate traffic over InterPlaNetary Internet backbone links and it has additional requirements such as minimum bandwidth, smooth traffic, and error control. To address all the above challenges, RCP-Planet is proposed. RCP-Planet consists of two novel algorithms, i. e., Begin State and Operational State. The protocol is based on a novel rate probing mechanism and a new rate control scheme to update the media rate smoothly based on the observed rate for the probing sequence. Ph. D.

That gives me the fortitude to fight Ghost Rider and the supernatural abilities to compete on some level with that guy." [...] The film creators have confirmed that the character will not follow the Marvel mythology of the character and admitted that they based his characterization on {{the look of the}} character alone. Ray Carrigan is a mercenary, drug dealer, and gun runner who works for Roarke (the human form of the Devil). He and his men are hired by Roarke to kidnap Danny, the son of Nadya (a woman who once was an ex-girlfriend of Carrigan and was saved from the brink of death by Roarke). Even though Ray and his men succeeded in capturing Danny, they end up pursued by Nayda and Ghost Rider. After being badly injured during a fight with Ghost Rider at a quarry, Carrigan's body is found dying under some rubble by Roarke. To ensure that Carrigan finishes his job, Roarke uses his powers to heal Carrigan by transforming him into Blackout. A difference between the comics version is that this Blackout has powers over darkness and decay and not a vampire. Blackout's decay powers don't work on a Twinkie when every other food he tries to eat rapidly decays the moment he touches it. When Ghost Rider, Moreau, and Nadya bring Danny to a holy area where Danny would be protected, the monks there wanted to kill the boy to prevent the Devil from getting them only for Blackout to kill the monks and recapture Danny. During the fight with Roarke to rescue Danny, Moreau sacrifices himself to distract Blackout from attacking Johnny Blaze (who is then repowered by Danny). In the final fight with Ghost Rider on the road, Blackout is killed when Ghost Rider uses the Penance Stare on him and throws him off of Nadya's truck.|$|R

The series of accidents alarm that close attention should {{be paid to the}} coordination hidden failures between the relay protections and the SSCS, or among parameters of power plants related to power grid, the relay protection and the SSCS. With the large scale new energy connected to power grid in China, the grid-connected control and protection of wind energy generation and photovoltaic power generation brings a new challenge to the relay protection system and the SSCS. The operating experience about new energy indicates that the tripping accident of large-scale wind turbine generators in Northwest China Power Grid in 2011 was caused by hidden coordination problem among the feeder protection, SVC/SVG and the grid-connected protection of wind turbines. Moreover, that large-scale new energy is connected to the power grid in centralization brings new challenges to the adaptability of various criterions of the SSCS. Among these challenges the criterion for fault trip and control measures may become invalid. Therefore, there is necessity to study hidden failures caused by generator-power grid coordination problem; otherwise a tiny accident could lead to instability and large scale blackouts of power grid.|$|R
40|$|The {{security}} of the smart grid is a grand challenge across cyber and physical domains. As an emerging critical infrastructure that integrates {{information and communication technologies}} (ICT) into power and energy systems (PES) with improved efficiency, reliability, and sustainability, the smart grid encompasses a transcontinental network of interdependent and interoperating cyber-physical systems (CPS) through the computerization, interconnection, and communication of systems and devices. Across the closely interwoven cyber-physical spaces, the vulnerability and exposure of critical systems and processes have been on the rise: malicious attackers may penetrate through access points in the cyberspace and exploit vulnerabilities in the physical systems, posing major threats to disrupt the delivery of electricity through massive cascading blackouts. Risks and impacts of such attacks have been demonstrated by intensive research efforts as well as real-world incidences recently, drawing increasing concerns from the government, the industry, and the public. ^ This dissertation will investigate the cyber-physical {{security of}} smart grid against potential massive blackouts. The work is composed of three synergistic tasks: 1) understand the mechanisms behind major cascading blackouts; 2) identify critical attack vectors that could initiate the cascading process; 3) develop effective strategies to enhance the resilience of the grid. The dissertation will first assess operational and structural vulnerabilities in massive cascading <b>blackouts</b> through steady <b>state</b> and complex network models, respectively. It will then examine malicious attacks that exploit the vulnerabilities through compromised control and measurements, where advanced machine learning algorithms are employed to identify critical attack vectors that would trigger massive cascades. Simulations results on IEEE standard benchmarks are evaluated and revealed the impact of sophisticated attacks. The dissertation aims to facilitate our awareness and preparedness toward an attack-resilient smart grid of the future. ...|$|R
40|$|Among {{the four}} phases along the hazard {{continuum}} [...] preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation [...] the sub‐field of long‐term recovery {{has long been}} an outlier, an "orphan" when it comes to concerted policy attention and pre‐disaster planning. It's not that community residents or municipal and state government officials are unaware of the potential long‐term residual consequences of natural disasters. Since the attacks of September 11, 2001 and the subsequent creation of the Department of Homeland Security, the U. S. government has spent billions of dollars to upgrade and enhance the country's ability to detect and respond to major catastrophic events, whether man‐made or natural in origin. The country experienced catastrophic wildfires in 2003, 2007 ‐ 2008, and 2011, a regional electrical <b>blackout</b> affecting 9 <b>states</b> and part of Canada in 2003, major Midwest flooding in 2008 and again this year, Category 3 or greater hurricanes in 2004, 2005, and 2008, and significant tornado clusters in 2011 that claimed 529 lives and caused over $ 17 billion in damages. These hazards have struck virtually every region of the country, and the consequences are readily evident to emergency managers and local city and county. Although the ratio of uncovered to covered losses has declined over this three‐decade timeframe, from approximately 8 : 1 to 4 : 1, absolute dollar losses have escalated tremendously. This may represent gains in mitigation efforts to insure against losses in high‐risk areas, but the size and growth of uncovered losses suggest a growing recovery challenge. This difference between covered and uncovered losses reflects the absolute minimum investment required for affected areas to return to pre‐event conditions, much less build back to a better or higher standard. Furthermore, what this trend line cannot capture are those disaster consequences not so easily monetized [...] diminished physical and mental health among an affected citizenry, loss of a sense of community and attachment to place, or large scale social disruptions or population displacements. Given the magnitude of the social investment needed to pursue long‐term recovery after a disaster, and the attention that other phases in the hazard continuum have experienced, why is recovery still a policy orphan, and what are the local implications for pre‐disaster planning for long‐term recovery...|$|R
