50|$|A {{redirector}} may support <b>back-to-back</b> <b>operation,</b> {{in which}} two computers run copies of the redirector and an outbound connection from one results in an inbound connection to the other. In effect, this technique creates a serial communications tunnel through a network connection. In practice, this configuration works only for certain applications but offers potentially lower costs and higher performance using the Internet to carry serial communications instead of modems between two computers.|$|E
5000|$|A {{redirector}} {{may include}} a modem emulator {{that allows the}} application to use [...] "AT" [...] modem commands even though no physical modem is present. The [...] "number" [...] dialed is an IP address, and the connection is a TCP network connection instead of a modem telephone call. This type of redirector is generally used by applications in originating client software needs to use a modem but the destination for the connection is a network endpoint. <b>Back-to-back</b> <b>operation</b> {{of this type of}} redirector can, in some cases, function as a replacement for modems on two computers for some applications. Network effects on timing of the data stream generally preclude the use of this method for transmitting faxes. Additionally, this method is also not reliable if used for PPP connections (such as dial-up networking) due to architectural limitations of TCP, a topic discussed in technical literature related to TCP-over-TCP.|$|E
40|$|One of the {{problems}} in future processors will be the resource conflicts caused by several load/store units competing to access the same cache bank. The traditional approach for handling this case is by introducing buffers combined with a cross-bar. This approach suffers from (i) the nondeterministic latency of a load/store and (ii) the extra latency caused by the cross-bar and the buffer management. A deterministic latency is of the utmost importance for the forwarding mechanism of out-of-order processors because it enables <b>back-to-back</b> <b>operation</b> of instructions. We propose a technique by which we eliminate the buffers and crossbars from the critical path of the load/store execution. This results in both, a low and a deterministic latency. Our solution consists of predicting which bank is to be accessed. Only {{in the case of a}} wrong prediction a penalty results. 1...|$|E

40|$|A {{multilevel}} inverter {{for generating}} 17 voltage levels using a three-level flying capacitor inverter and cascaded H-bridge modules with floating capacitors has been proposed. Various {{aspects of the}} proposed inverter like capacitor voltage balancing have been presented in the present paper. Experimental results are presented to study {{the performance of the}} proposed converter. The stability of the capacitor balancing algorithm has been verified both during transients and steady-state operation. All the capacitors in this circuit can be balanced instantaneously by using one of the pole voltage combinations. Another advantage of this topology is its ability to generate all the voltages from a single dc-link power supply which enables <b>back-to-back</b> <b>operation</b> of converter. Also, the proposed inverter can be operated at all load power factors and modulation indices. Additional advantage is, if one of the H-bridges fail, the inverter can still be operated at full load with reduced number of levels. This configuration has very low dv/dt and common-mode voltage variation...|$|E
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of a polarized electron-nucleon collider (ENC) with a center-of-mass energy up to 14 GeV for luminosities exceeding 1032 cm- 2 s- 1 is presently studied. The proposed concept utilizes the planned 15 GeV/c High-Energy Storage Ring (HESR) {{at the future}} International Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) [1] for protons/deuterons and integrates an additional 3. 3 GeV electron ring (Fig. 1). Calculations of cooled beam equilibria including intra-beam scattering and beam-beam interaction have been performed using the BetaCool code [2]. A special design of the interaction region (IR) is required to realize <b>back-to-back</b> <b>operation</b> of the HESR storage ring [3] in fixed target mode together with the elaborated collider mode. For polarized proton/deuteron beams additional equipment has to be implemented in several machines of the acceleration chain and HESR to preserve the beam’s polarization [4]. A corresponding scheme for polarized electrons is currently under investigation. In this presentation the required modifications and extensions of the HESR are discussed and the proposed concept is presented...|$|E
40|$|International {{audience}} 100 -Gb/s coherent systems {{based on}} polarization-division multiplexed quadrature {{phase shift keying}} (PDMQPSK), with aggregate wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) capacities approaching 10 Tb/s per fibre, are being widely deployed due to the benefits provided by coherent detection. The stringent linewidth requirements for lasers used in these systems only allow optical sources with certain phase noise characteristics to be employed. A major challenge is therefore to produce lasers with the requisite performance at low cost. Discrete mode laser diodes (DMLDs) can be designed for narrow linewidth emission and present an economic approach with a focus on high volume manufacturability of monolithic semiconductor lasers. In this paper the performance of a 112 Gb/s long-haul optical transmission system employing PDM-QPSK is investigated using a range of transmitter lasers with linewidth values ranging from 100 kHz to 5 MHz. A linewidth of 100 kHz was obtained from an external cavity laser (ECL) and linewidths ranging from 200 kHz to 5 MHz were obtained from DMLDs. The performance of the system is analysed through experimental measurements and simulations performed by Virtual Photonics Incorporated Transmission Maker (VPI™). Results are presented for <b>back-to-back</b> <b>operation</b> and after transmission through G. 654 pure silica core fibre (PSCF) at distances up to 6930 km...|$|E
40|$|The authors present data-how {{solutions}} on {{a pipeline}} of transputers for banded and dense systems of linear equations using Gauss elimination and the Gauss-Jordan method, respectively, These implementations, written in occam, are especially effective {{when there is}} a continuous supply of right-hand sides to be solved with the same coefficient matrix. Attention is paid to both load balancing and resource handling within the processor elements of the pipeline, When solving multiple right-hand sides, floating-point efficiency levels on 32 -processor implementations range from 110 % (for dense systems) down to 90 % (for banded systems), where 100 % represents the peak performance attainable from a single transputer applied to the same problem (effectively <b>back-to-back</b> floating-point <b>operations</b> on data in external memory).

40|$|Various prototypes {{designs of}} 36 kV vacuum interrupters {{have been tested}} in {{high-power}} test station during capacitive switching <b>operations.</b> <b>Back-to-back</b> tests were performed for inrush current of 20 kA peak level and 4250 Hz frequency. Experiment was performed {{with a number of}} prototype vacuum interrupters of different geometry and contact material. Vacuum gap behavior under pre-arcing and inrush current conditions (pre-arc energy, duration and interruption of inrush current) will be highlighted. Field electron emission measurement has been used to monitor field electron emission current that flows in vacuum gaps after current interruption. Statistics will be presented in relation to the late breakdown events, field electron emission current measurement, vacuum interrupters design and contact material. It was observed that only the mechanism of electron field emission alone could not explain the breakdown in vacuum at the origin of late breakdown phenomena. Contact material, vacuum interrupter design as well as circuit breaker characteristics are determining the dielectric withstand during capacitor bank switching operations...|$|R
