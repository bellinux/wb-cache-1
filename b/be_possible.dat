5|$|A four-track Second Avenue Subway would {{originate}} from {{a connection to}} the IRT Pelham Line at 138th Street, the Bronx, to Grand Street, Manhattan. The connection to the Pelham Line would allow for eight additional trains per hour operating between Manhattan and the Pelham Line. It would then <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> to operate 10-car trains via the line and it would also <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> to operate full express service via the line's center express track. The trains operating via Nassau Street would go to Brooklyn via the Montague Tunnel. During non-rush hours trains would terminate at Broad Street. There would be a passageway built from Grand Central via 43rd Street to Second Avenue to permit transfers.|$|E
5|$|Apart from {{attempts}} to control {{the spread of the}} Aedes mosquito there are ongoing efforts to develop antiviral drugs that would be used to treat attacks of dengue fever and prevent severe complications. Discovery {{of the structure of the}} viral proteins may aid the development of effective drugs. There are several plausible targets. The first approach is inhibition of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (coded by NS5), which copies the viral genetic material, with nucleoside analogs. Secondly, it may <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> to develop specific inhibitors of the viral protease (coded by NS3), which splices viral proteins. Finally, it may <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> to develop entry inhibitors, which stop the virus entering cells, or inhibitors of the 5′ capping process, which is required for viral replication.|$|E

40|$|What I {{call the}} {{argument}} from almost indiscernibles is an argument, {{put forward by}} Robert Adams in 1979, {{for the possibility of}} indiscernibles based on the possibility of almost indiscernibles. The argument is that if almost indiscernibles <b>are</b> <b>possible,</b> indiscernibles <b>are</b> <b>possible,</b> but since almost indiscernible <b>are</b> <b>possible,</b> indiscernibles <b>are</b> <b>possible.</b> The argument seems to be an improvement over the mere appeal to intuitions, like that suggested by Max Black, that situations in which there <b>are</b> indiscernibles <b>are</b> <b>possible,</b> for the argument purports to give us a reason that indiscernibles <b>are</b> <b>possible.</b> In this paper I shall assess the argument by examining whether there is support for the conditional premise that if almost indiscernibles <b>are</b> <b>possible,</b> indiscernibles <b>are</b> <b>possible.</b> I shall argue that there are reasons to think that either the premise lacks support or almost indiscernibles are dispensable. If the premise lacks support, the argument does not establish the possibility of almost indiscernibles; if almost indiscernibles are dispensable, the argument is not needed to establish the possibility of indiscernibles...|$|R

5|$|One further {{proposal}} {{was made to}} rebury Lody in the 1960s. In 1959 the British and German governments agreed to move German war dead who had been buried in various locations around the UK to a new central cemetery at Cannock Chase in Staffordshire. The German War Graves Commission (VDK) asked if it would <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> to disinter Lody's body and move it to Cannock Chase. By that time, the plot had been reused for further common graves, buried above Lody's body. The VDK was told {{that it would not}} <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> to disinter the other bodies without the permission of the relatives, which would have been an almost impossible task where common graves were concerned. The {{proposal was}} abandoned and Lody's body remains at Plaistow.|$|E

5|$|According to the AACAP Practice Parameter (2005) the {{question}} of whether attachment disorders can reliably be diagnosed in older children and adults has not been resolved. Attachment behaviors used for the diagnosis of RAD change markedly with development and defining analogous behaviors in older children is difficult. There are no substantially validated measures of attachment in middle childhood or early adolescence. Assessments of RAD past school age may not <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> at all as by this time children have developed along individual lines {{to such an extent that}} early attachment experiences are only one factor among many that determine emotion and behavior.|$|E
