5|$|Cadet nurses {{came from}} across the nation and from all backgrounds. Some joined <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> become nurses, others for the free education, and others joined because their country needed them. Attrition rates for cadets were {{comparable}} to those reported for other nursing schools in the same period. The corps was {{the largest of the}} federal nurse-training programs, and allowed young women to serve their country in uniform and without discrimination. The American Hospital Association credited the cadet student nurses with helping to prevent the collapse of civilian nursing during the war.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1968, {{his father}} John S. McCain Jr. was named {{commander}} of all U.S. {{forces in the}} Vietnam theater, and the North Vietnamese offered McCain early release <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> appear merciful for propaganda purposes, and also to show other POWs that elite prisoners were willing to be treated preferentially. McCain refused repatriation unless every man taken in before him was also released. Such early release was prohibited by the POWs' interpretation of the military Code of Conduct which states in Article III: “I will accept neither parole nor special favors from the enemy”. To prevent the enemy from using prisoners for propaganda, officers were to agree {{to be released in}} the order in which they were captured.|$|E
5|$|Tagliani won {{the pole}} {{position}} but {{was passed by}} Bryan Herta on the first lap. Papis moved into the lead on the fifth lap and remained in the position for 54 laps {{more than any other}} driver {{during the course of the}} race. Most drivers chose to run in front of the field but not take the lead <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> conserve fuel. The race was reduced from its original distance of 250 laps to 220 because of fading daylight and the event was delayed by morning rain. Da Matta held off Papis at the start-finish line to win after a caution period for a crash involving Scott Dixon ended competitive racing in the event.|$|E

5|$|The Flyers {{hosted a}} {{practice}} {{game against the}} Muncie Tigers on September 26, 1920, but {{the result of the}} game is unknown. The Flyers' first game of the season was against the Rock Island Independents. The Independents beat the Flyers 45–0. As a result, the Staleys, who were supposed to play the Flyers the next week, cancelled <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> play a better team. The Flyers tried to schedule game {{for the next few weeks}} but were unsuccessful. Since there were no rules to keep players on teams, several Flyers' players left and played for other teams. The Flyers scheduled a game against the Cleveland Tigers three weeks later, but the game was cancelled because the Tigers decided to play against the Panhandles instead. The same result happened next week against the Dayton Triangles. The Flyers were challenged by the Gas City Tigers and Muncie Offers More AC—two teams of Muncie. These games are not counted in the APFA standings.|$|E
5|$|Who's That Girl: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is {{the first}} soundtrack album by American singer and {{songwriter}} Madonna. It was released on July 21, 1987 by Sire Records to promote the film of the same name. It also contains songs by her label mates Scritti Politti, Duncan Faure, Club Nouveau, Coati Mundi and Michael Davidson. The soundtrack is credited as a Madonna album, despite her only performing four of the nine tracks on the album. After the commercial success of her film Desperately Seeking Susan (1985), Madonna wanted to act in another comedy film titled Slammer, about a woman named Nikki Finn who was falsely accused of homicide. However, due to the critical and commercial failure of her adventure film Shanghai Surprise (1986), Warner Bros. were initially reluctant to green light the project, but later agreed, after Madonna convinced them and also <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> cash in on Madonna's success with soundtracks.|$|E

25|$|Three intellectuals, Liu Xiaobo, Zhou Duo, Gao Xin, and a Taiwanese singer Hou Dejian {{declared}} a second hunger strike <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> revive the pro-democracy movement. After weeks of occupying the Square, {{the students were}} tired, and internal rifts opened between moderate and hardliner student groups. In their declaration speech, the hunger strikers openly criticized the government's suppression of the movement to remind the students that their cause was worth fighting for, and pushed them to continue their occupation of the Square.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} troops that {{took part in the}} battle is unclear and has been disputed. Early Qing sources tend to inflate the number of Li Zicheng's troops <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{emphasize}} the Qing's military prowess against the Shun; these sources claim that Li Zicheng's army counted up to 200,000 men. Modern historians have largely deflated these figures: Frederic Wakeman gives a figure of 60,000 men for Li's army, whereas Frederick Mote claims that Li had more than 100,000 troops under his command.|$|E

The wrestlers agreed to do this (with the other talent encouraging them) to get out of regular training for that day. DeMott refuted the notion that it was his idea, stating that the other trainees came up with <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> skip the session.|$|E
50|$|People build {{individual}} {{homes for}} all sorts of reasons, but mainly <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> create something tailored to their family's unique requirements; or something architecturally appealing in all manner of styles; or <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> live in a home that they {{might not be able to}} afford on the open market. There is something uniquely rewarding about building a home for you and your family, it harks back to the most basic of human instincts. Nowadays, however, self-build homes are not just about shelter and security, they are about expressing yourself and changing your lifestyle. For many, self-build is a chance to create the life they have always dreamed of.|$|R
50|$|Rosenblatt {{noted that}} there is a {{surprising}} link between PSM and motivation. After closely observing employees in the public section, material indicated that when PSM encourages individuals it can spark innovation. When employees are rewarded for previous accomplishments in the workplace, they are motivated to do even more, although that motivation is not necessarily coming from a genuine place and instead comes from the desire to receive more rewards. Rosenblatt reaffirms the notion that individuals aren't to concern themselves with what their driving force for may be, whether they are making accomplishments <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be innovative or <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> receive a bonus, the ends will ultimately justify the means.|$|R

25|$|In 1983 The Faith {{released}} an eight-song twelve inch EP called Subject to Change. It {{was produced by}} Ian MacKaye and showed the band progressing into more melodic territory {{with the addition of}} a second guitarist. Eddie Janney, formerly of the Untouchables and Ian MacKaye's short-lived Skewbald/Grand Union, joined The Faith at the end of 1982 to play second guitar and made his recorded debut. The addition was made <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> get some more complex guitar ideas into the songs and soften the impact of guitar malfunctions, which were a constant threat during good shows. Not to mention, they just wanted a fuller sound and liked the way Eddie played.|$|E
25|$|When ecology {{emerged as}} a matter of public {{interest}} in the 1970s, a few zoos began to consider making conservation their central role, with Gerald Durrell of the Jersey Zoo, George Rabb of Brookfield Zoo, and William Conway of the Bronx Zoo (Wildlife Conservation Society) leading the discussion. From then on, zoo professionals became increasingly aware of the need to engage themselves in conservation programs, and the American Zoo Association soon said that conservation was its highest priority. <b>Because</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> stress conservation issues, many large zoos stopped the practice of having animals perform tricks for visitors. The Detroit Zoo, for example, stopped its elephant show in 1969, and its chimpanzee show in 1983, acknowledging that the trainers had probably abused the animals to get them to perform.|$|E
25|$|Some {{candidates}} ran in duos <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> combine {{family life}} with politics. Brouwer, Rosenmöller and Sipkes already were MPs for GreenLeft, whilst Rabbae was new – {{he had been}} chair of the Dutch Centre for Foreigners. In the first round, the duos ended up ahead of the others, but neither had an absolute majority. A second round was needed, in which Brouwer and Rabbae won with 51%. Brouwer became the first candidate and Rabbae second, the second duo Rosenmöller and Sipkes occupied the following place followed by Marijke Vos, former chair of the party. The idea of a dual top candidacy did not communicate well to the voters. GreenLeft lost one seat, leaving only five. Yet in the same election, the centre-left Labour Party also {{lost a lot of}} seats.|$|E

25|$|Randel Helms {{argues that}} the books of the Bible were written for and against {{different}} points of view—that the Bible's authors were often motivated to write <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> challenge or correct those who had written before them. So, for example, Paul said that he opposed Peter because he felt that Peter was clearly in the wrong (Galatians 1 and 2). Helms notes that Jeremiah condemned the entire religious establishment, that the prophets and priests were frauds, {{every one of them}} (Jeremiah 8:10). Luke felt the need to write another gospel even though other writers had already drawn up their own account of events (Luke 1:1). Luke felt that Mark's gospel was filled with errors and edited it freely, even the words of the dying Christ were not left unaltered.|$|E
25|$|It was {{the time}} of Canal Mania, and the initial offers for shares were over-subscribed. Amidst discontent from land owners, {{dividends}} were further limited to eight per-cent, the tolls on coal were reduced, and £20,000 of shares were set aside for purchase by the land owners. The bill was opposed by the Erewash Canal and the Trent and Mersey Canal, who were promoting {{a plan for the}} Trent Canal from Derwent Mouth, where the Trent and Mersey ended, via the Erewash, Beeston and Nottingham to the Trent below Nottingham. The Trent Navigation also argued against it, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> build the Beeston Cut themselves. Complicated negotiations followed, in which the Beeston Cut was dropped from the bill, on the understanding that the Trent Navigation would then apply to build it, and the Trent Canal bill was withdrawn when the Trent Navigation pledged to pursue a bill to improve the river. When an Act of Parliament was granted in May 1792, there were great celebrations in Nottingham.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 200s, when Lu Xun was 20 years old, {{he came to}} serve the warlord Sun Quan, who was {{nominally}} a subject of the Han emperor, but had full autonomy in governing the territories in Jiangdong he inherited from his elder brother, Sun Ce. Lu Xun started {{his career as a}} minor officer in Sun Quan's office. He later became a Foreman Clerk in the East and West Bureaus (東西曹令史) and the Tuntian Commandant of Haichang (海昌屯田都尉; jurisdiction in present-day Haining, Zhejiang), before he was appointed as a county-level official. When the county was plagued by consecutive years of drought, Lu Xun opened up the granaries and distributed food supplies to the people, and promoted agriculture. The people benefited from his policies. At the time, there were many households in Wu, Kuaiji, and Danyang (丹楊) commanderies who were hiding from the government <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> evade taxes and conscription. Lu Xun had them tracked down, registered and resettled. Some able-bodied young men were drafted for military service while others were recruited for agricultural labour.|$|E

25|$|In {{particular}} {{during the}} 1960s and 1970s many gurus acquired groups of young followers in Western Europe and the USA. According to the American sociologist David G. Bromley this was partially {{due to the}} repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1965 which permitted Asian gurus entrance to the USA. According to the Dutch Indologist Albertina Nugteren, the repeal was only one of several factors and a minor one compared with the two most important causes for the surge of all things 'Eastern': the post-war cross-cultural mobility and the general dissatisfaction with established Western values. According to the professor in sociology Stephen A. Kent at the University of Alberta and Kranenborg (1974), {{one of the reasons why}} in the 1970s young people including hippies turned to gurus was because they found that drugs had opened for them the existence of the transcendental or <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> get high without drugs. According to Kent, another reason why this happened so often in the USA then, was because some anti-Vietnam War protesters and political activists became worn out or disillusioned of the possibilities to change society through political means, and as an alternative turned to religious means. Some gurus and the groups they lead attracted opposition. One example of such group was the Hare Krishna movement (ISKCON) founded by A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada in 1966, many of whose followers voluntarily accepted the demandingly ascetic lifestyle of bhakti yoga on a full-time basis, in stark contrast to much of the popular culture of the time.|$|E
