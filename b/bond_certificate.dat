5000|$|One of {{the high}} points of his career came after he left MGM. This was the editing of The Towering Inferno (1974) with his son Carl Kress. In the words of Tony Sloman, [...] "The Towering Inferno is superbly put together, its {{pyramidal}} star structure cleverly maintained throughout, its climax as the high-level water tanks flood the blazing glass tower genuinely riveting, {{but there is a}} single edit within that film which encapsulates the art, craft and skill of the professional editor. Fred Astaire has taken a spreadsheet-sized junk <b>bond</b> <b>certificate</b> from out of his briefcase and puts it folded into his inside pocket. Seamless, except you never see him fold the document. It's done - brilliantly on a cut, an edit that must have brought great satisfaction to whichever Kress wrought it, and a supreme example of great (and totally invisible) editing." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{designer}} {{also suggested}} a [...] "negotiation" [...] variant {{in which a}} country's decisions are made {{by a vote of}} its bondholders, with players holding more/higher bonds having greater influence. Specifically, each bond value point (the big numeral on the upper right corner of the <b>bond</b> <b>certificate)</b> counts as one vote. Players can lend and give one another money, but the bank and treasuries still cannot give or lend money in any way. Because a nation can go onto the Investor field against the will of the holder of the flag, the government is not forced to pay out every bond. Rather, the treasury pays as much interest as possible, beginning with the lowest (2M) bond and then up from there. In the event that the investor card is still used, it is unnecessary to allow extra investment by players who do not have a flag, since they are still able to participate in governance through voting. Gerdts notes, [...] "You do not need a government to lead a country anymore. What you rather need is majorities for your ideas, and the right coalition-partners in critical situations! It's all about negotiation and backstabbing now..." [...] The gameflow can be described as follows: ...|$|E
