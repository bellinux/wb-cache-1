25|$|The African {{beliefs and}} {{practices}} certainly influenced Cuba's music. Polyrhythmic percussion is an inherent part of African music, as melody is part of European music. Also, in African tradition, percussion is always joined to song and dance, and to a particular social setting. The result of the meeting of European and African cultures is that most Cuban popular music is creolized. This creolization of Cuban life has <b>been</b> <b>happening</b> for a long time, and by the 20th century, elements of African belief, music and dance were well integrated into popular and folk forms.|$|E

According to iSupply, production in units of CRTs was not surpassed by LCDs production until 4Q 2007, owing largely to CRT production at factories in China.

This was {{in part because of the}} multiple chiefdoms and even mini-kingdoms in this area. Most villages were found up to a day's walk from the ocean—possibly a defensive response to the growing number of vazaha (foreigners) anchoring in their bays. The various Raondriana ("princes") power was a function of their alliances with ombiasy (traditional diviner-healers) and scribes (using a form of Arabic script to write Malagasy), as well as how many soldiers they had available for battles with other Raondriana (Rakotoarisoa, 1998).|$|E

25|$|In 1841 {{the early}} {{settlers}} {{found themselves in}} need of a government after the death of pioneer Ewing Young. Young had accumulated much wealth as a successful rancher following the Willamette Cattle Company events of 1837 when he and a group of other settlers herded over 600 head of cattle from California to Oregon. This made him very wealthy and intertwined him economically with many of the other pioneers in the valley. Young had died without a will or heir, thus necessitating a need for a probate court, because otherwise people were sure that his estate would have been disposed for the Hudson's Bay Company, the Catholic Jesuit Priests from Canada, or the Protestant Methodist Mission from the United States, as that had <b>been</b> <b>happening</b> in the past. Several meetings occurred over the subsequent months which included François Norbert Blanchet, William J. Bailey, Mr. Charlevon, David Donpierre, Gustavus Hines, William Johnson, Jason Lee, Étienne Lucier, Robert Moore, Josiah Lamberson Parrish, Sidney Smith, and David Leslie.|$|E
25|$|However, {{with recent}} {{advances}} in ecological understanding {{it has become clear}} that draining of this vast lake affected the entire climate of this important region that is India's capital territory and its neighbourhood. The draining of the lake completely also caused the watertable in the entire area to go down and the area becoming arid. There have been some plans since to at least resurrect a much smaller lake in the area. Most of the Najafgarh jheel basin lands have increased many folds in their value owing to them coming within Delhi, India's capital territory and are under ownership of farmers who may want to make a fast buck selling them to developers who want to convert the former lake basin into housing complexes as has already <b>been</b> <b>happening</b> with major housing colonies coming up in the region. If Najafgarh drain, which was built to drain the original Najafgarh lake or jheel, ever breaches its wide embankments it will flood these developed lands owing to them spread all over the former low lying jheel or lake basin.|$|E

Several of its arguments were based on the predicted evaporation of hypothetical micro black holes by Hawking radiation and on the theoretical predictions of the Standard Model with regard to the outcome of events to be studied in the LHC.

30|$|Theory can be {{considered}} as a light on social reality – illuminating what <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> and providing a rationale for understanding why it <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> (Tobin 2008). Since theory can address such questions it is a tool for interpretive researchers to seek to understand social life, from the perspectives of participants. The role of an interpretive researcher is to find out from participants what <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> and the rationale for what <b>is</b> <b>happening.</b> A theoretical framework illuminates social reality, but it only shows what the theory is capable of showing. Different theories can provide different landscapes for what <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> and why it <b>is</b> <b>happening.</b> For example, theories about expressed emotions might give interesting accounts of facial expression of emotion, emotions represented by prosody, and use of gestures when emotions become excessive. However, as rich as these insights might prove to be they will be silent about more issues than they illuminate. As theories illuminate so they obscure. How do people act to restore harmony in their bodies when their blood oxygen is low, when pulse rate is high, or when body temperature rises? Narratives about mindfulness might be absent because participants are not aware that mindfulness is salient to what <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> – or they might not even know {{there is such a thing}} as mindfulness. Becoming aware of a particular theory that might have salience to what <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> and why it <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> affords seeing differently. Of course, if participants see differently there is a fresh stream of possibilities for action – depending on what they see and their value system in relation to what they see happening, they will act accordingly. That is, fresh ways of looking can expand action possibilities. Becoming aware of what participants previously were unaware of is a way of fracturing existing equilibria – akin to an intervention that can unsettle patterns of action in particular social settings. Ann Swidler (1986) noted that culture reveals itself in unsettled times – an insight that provides a rationale for interventions that expand theoretical repertoires, thereby enabling participants to reflexively engage with their lifeworlds – becoming aware of things they previously were unaware of, and making changes when and as they feel change is necessary.|$|R
