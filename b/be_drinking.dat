25|$|Regardless of hours, yum cha {{starts with}} the diners {{ordering}} {{a specific set of}} teas they would like to drink.

2500|$|During the Polar Special, both Jeremy Clarkson and James May {{were shown}} to <b>be</b> <b>drinking</b> a gin and tonic whilst driving through an ice field in the Arctic. The {{producers}} claimed that they were beyond the jurisdiction of drink driving laws {{as they were in}} international waters at the time, whilst Clarkson stating on the programme that he was not driving but sailing ('piloting' a vehicle on (frozen) water as opposed to actual land). However, the BBC Trust found that the scene could [...] "glamorise the misuse of alcohol" [...] and that the scene [...] "was not editorially justified {{in the context of a}} family show pre-watershed".|$|E
2500|$|The event {{depicted}} in the Symposium {{is a group of}} men attending a banquet, who have now come to the symposium; which was, in ancient Greece, a traditional part of a banquet that took place after the meal, when drinking for pleasure was accompanied by music, dancing, recitals, or conversation. [...] The setting means that the participants will <b>be</b> <b>drinking</b> wine; this suggests that the men might be induced to say things they wouldn’t say elsewhere or when sober. [...] They might speak frankly, or take risks, or be prone to hubris — they might also even be inspired to make speeches that are particularly heartfelt and noble.|$|E
5000|$|So as it {{was applied}} here, the {{statement}} [...] "if he <b>is</b> <b>drinking,</b> everyone <b>is</b> drinking" [...] was taken to be correct in one case, if everyone <b>was</b> <b>drinking,</b> {{and in the other}} case, if he <b>was</b> not <b>drinking</b> — even though his drinking may not have {{had anything to do with}} anyone else's drinking.|$|R

2500|$|In 2006, John Dandois, Media Arts Group executive, recounted a {{story that}} on one {{occasion}} six years previously, Kinkade became drunk at a Siegfried & Roy magic show in Las Vegas and began shouting [...] "Codpiece!

Dandois also said of Kinkade, [...] "Thom would be fine, he would <b>be</b> <b>drinking,</b> {{and then all of}} a sudden, you couldn't tell where the boundary was, and then he became very incoherent, and he would start cussing and doing a lot of weird stuff." [...] In June 2010, Kinkade was arrested in Carmel, California, for driving while under the influence of alcohol. He was later convicted.|$|E
2500|$|The M*A*S*H (TV series) episode [...] "Bottoms Up" [...] (Season 9, Episode 15) {{featured}} a side {{story about a}} Nurse (Cpt. Helen Whitfield) who was found to <b>be</b> <b>drinking</b> heavily off-duty. By {{the culmination of the}} episode, after a confrontation by Maj. Margaret Houlihan, the character swears off her alcoholism and presumably quits immediately. At mealtime, an unspecified time later, Whitfield becomes hysterical upon being served food in the Mess tent, claiming that there are things crawling onto her from it. The characters of Margaret and Col. Sherman Potter, subdue her. Potter, having recognized the symptoms of Delirium Tremens (which he abbreviates [...] "D.T."), orders 5ml of Paraldehyde from a witnessing nurse.|$|E
2500|$|Eliade's fantasy novel Domnișoara Christina, was, on its own, {{the topic}} of a scandal. The novel deals with the fate of an {{eccentric}} family, the Moscus, who are haunted by {{the ghost of a}} murdered young woman, known as Christina. The apparition shares characteristics with vampires and with strigoi: she is believed to <b>be</b> <b>drinking</b> the blood of cattle and that of a young family member. The young man Egor becomes the object of Christina's desire, and is shown to have intercourse with her. Noting that the plot and setting reminded one of horror fiction works by the German author Hanns Heinz Ewers, and defending Domnişoara Christina in front of harsher criticism, Călinescu nonetheless argued that the [...] "international environment" [...] in which it took place was [...] "upsetting". He also depicted the plot as focused on [...] "major impurity", summarizing the story's references to necrophilia, menstrual fetish and ephebophilia.|$|E

50|$|Alcohol {{expectations}} {{can operate}} {{in the absence of}} actual consumption of alcohol. Research in the United States over a period of decades has shown that men tend to become more sexually aroused when they think they have <b>been</b> <b>drinking</b> alcohol, — even when they have not <b>been</b> <b>drinking</b> it. Women report feeling more sexually aroused when they falsely believe the beverages they have <b>been</b> <b>drinking</b> contained alcohol (although one measure of their physiological arousal shows that they became less aroused).|$|R
5000|$|Otherwise {{at least}} one person <b>is</b> not <b>drinking.</b> For any nondrinking person, the {{statement}} if that particular person <b>is</b> <b>drinking,</b> then everyone in the pub <b>is</b> <b>drinking</b> <b>is</b> formally true: its antecedent ("that particular person is drinking") is false, therefore the statement is true {{due to the nature of}} material implication in formal logic, which states that [...] "If P, then Q" [...] is always true if P is false. (These kinds of statements are said to be vacuously true.) ...|$|R
2500|$|During the Mission Status Briefing, International Space Station Program Manager Mike Suffredini {{noted that}} the water {{recycling}} system appeared to be functioning normally after the modifications performed by the crew on orbit. Additional water samples were taken, and the crew would be bringing home approximately six liters of sample water for extensive testing. The crew on the station would not <b>be</b> <b>drinking</b> any of the water until the engineers and scientists on the ground {{had a chance to}} thoroughly analyze the samples taken. Suffredini also noted that while the goal of the EVA activities to perform maintenance on the starboard SARJ was to allow it to operate [...] "periodically", the initial test showed encouraging results, and the lubrication and other work done by the spacewalkers may allow for more routine operations than originally expected. It would be weeks before a more complete assessment could be given, the joint would need to be put through more testing, as well as analysis of the results from engineers on the ground, but Suffredini was encouraged by the initial results.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order for}} an army {{to be in}} good {{fighting}} condition, it must maintain the health of its soldiers. [...] One way of doing this is knowing the proper location to set up camp. [...] Military camps were not to be set up in any sort of marshy region. [...] Marsh lands tend to have standing water, which can draw in mosquitos. [...] Mosquitos in turn can carry deadly disease, such as malaria. [...] As the camp and troops were needed to be moved, the troops would be wearing heavy soled shoes in order to prevent wear on soldiers’ feet. [...] Waterborne illness has also remained an issue throughout the centuries. [...] When soldiers would look for water they would be searching for some sort of natural spring, or other form of flowing water. [...] When water sources were found, any type of rotting wood, or plant material, would be removed before the water was used for drinking. [...] If these features could not be removed, then water would be drawn from {{a different part of the}} source. [...] By doing this the soldiers were more likely to <b>be</b> <b>drinking</b> from a safe source of water. [...] Thus, water borne bacteria had a less chance of making soldiers ill. [...] One process used to check for dirty water, was to moisten a fine white linen cloth with the water and leave it out to dry. [...] If the cloth had any type of stain, it would be considered to be diseased. [...] If the cloth was clean, the water was healthy and drinkable. [...] Fresh water also assists with sewage disposal, as well as wound care. [...] Thus, a source of fresh water was a preemptive measure taken to defeat disease and keep men healthy once they were wounded.|$|E
