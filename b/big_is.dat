In the film, a Harlem drug lord known as Mr. Big plans to {{distribute}} two tons of heroin free to put rival drug barons out of business. Mr. <b>Big</b> <b>is</b> revealed to be the disguised alter ego of Dr. Kananga, a corrupt Caribbean dictator, who rules San Monique, the fictional island where the heroin poppies are secretly farmed. Bond is investigating the deaths of three British agents, leading him to Kananga, and is soon trapped in a world of gangsters and voodoo as he fights {{to put a stop to}} the drug baron's scheme.|$|E
25|$|The two {{arguments}} Sam and Sally in tree (a) {{are dependent}} on the predicate likes, whereby these arguments are also syntactically dependent on likes. What {{this means is that}} the semantic and syntactic dependencies overlap and point in the same direction (down the tree). Attributive adjectives, however, are predicates that take their head noun as their argument, hence <b>big</b> <b>is</b> a predicate in tree (b) that takes bones as its one argument; the semantic dependency points up the tree and therefore runs counter to the syntactic dependency. A similar situation obtains in (c), where the preposition predicate on takes the two arguments the picture and the wall; one of these semantic dependencies points up the syntactic hierarchy, whereas the other points down it. Finally, the predicate to help in (d) takes the one argument Jim but is not directly connected to Jim in the syntactic hierarchy, which means that that semantic dependency is entirely independent of the syntactic dependencies.|$|E

The titular protagonist of the game is Sonic, a hedgehog with the ability to run at supersonic speeds who has returned home after a long journey. His longtime friend is Tails, a fox who is a skilled mechanic and can fly using his two tails. Knuckles is an echidna with the ability to glide; he is the guardian of the Master Emerald, a powerful gem that keeps his home of Angel Island floating in the sky. Amy is a pink hedgehog who wields a large hammer and views Sonic as her love interest. E-102 Gamma is a gunner robot belonging to the E-100 Series tasked with serving his creator. <b>Big</b> <b>is</b> a giant cat interested in fishing and is usually accompanied by his friend, Froggy. The characters are aided by Tikal, a mysterious female echidna who shows the characters visions of the distant past, and also gives out hints to the player.|$|E

For Benson, [...] "Mr <b>Big</b> <b>is</b> only an adequate villain", with little depth to him. According to the literary analyst LeRoy L. Panek, in his examination of 20th century British spy novels, Live and Let Die showed a departure from the [...] "gentleman crook" [...] that showed in much earlier literature, as the intellectual and organisational skills of Mr Big were emphasised, rather than the behavioural. Within Mr Big's organisation, Panek identifies Mr Big's henchmen as [...] "merely incompetent gunsels" [...] when compared with Bond, who the latter can eliminate with relative ease.|$|E

500|$|Many of Kavner's roles {{have been}} {{described}} by New York Times writer Hilary de Vries as a [...] "woman who is supportive, sympathetic, or self-effacingly funny". Kavner grew to despise playing such roles, saying, [...] "If it smacks of Brenda Morgenstern, I won't take the job." [...] She had a supporting role as Eleanor Costello, a nurse who befriends Robin Williams' character in the Academy Award nominated film Awakenings. Kavner interviewed several nurses {{in preparation for the}} role, and Penny Marshall, the director of the film, described Kavner as [...] "a low-maintenance actor [...] You {{never have to worry about}} giving [...] back-story for her characters." [...] In 1992, Kavner starred in This Is My Life, her first leading role in a feature film. Kavner played Dottie Ingels, an aspiring stand-up comedian who starts neglecting her family when her career begins to take off. Kavner described Dottie as [...] "really selfish" [...] but admitted, [...] "I liked the role for that very reason." [...] Kavner had been asked to play a character with a smaller role in the film, but Joe Roth, at the time the chairman of 20th Century Fox, suggested that they cast a lesser known actress in the lead role. Nora Ephron, the writer of This Is My Life, said Kavner [...] "has so little vanity that it is almost shocking. Not only does she have no demands as an actress - 'How <b>big</b> <b>is</b> my trailer, what's in my refrigerator?' - but she will do anything for the character if it makes sense to her." ...|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{stated that}} Moore [...] "has the {{superficial}} attributes for the job: The urbanity, the quizzically raised eyebrow, the calm under fire and in bed". However, {{he felt that}} Moore wasn't satisfactory in living up to the legacy left by Sean Connery in the preceding films. He rated the villains [...] "a little banal", adding that the film [...] "doesn't have a Bond villain worthy of the Goldfingers, Dr. Nos and Oddjobs of the past." [...] Chris Nashawaty similarly argues that Dr. Kananga/Mr. <b>Big</b> <b>is</b> the worst villain of the Roger Moore James Bond films. BBC Films reviewer William Mager praised the use of locations, but said that the plot was [...] "convoluted". He stated that [...] "Connery and Lazenby had an air of concealed thuggishness, clenched fists at the ready, but in Moore's case a sardonic quip and a raised eyebrow are his deadliest weapons". Reviewer Leonard Maltin rated the film {{two and a half}} stars out of four, describing it as a [...] "barely memorable, overlong James Bond movie" [...] that [...] "seems merely an excuse to film wild chase sequences". Danny Peary noted that Jane Seymour portrays [...] "one of the Bond series's most beautiful heroines" [...] but had little praise for Moore, whom he described as making [...] "an unimpressive debut as James Bond in Tom Mankiewicz's unimaginative adaptation of Ian Fleming's second novel…The movie stumbles along most of the way. It's hard to remember Moore is playing Bond at times – in fact, if he and Seymour were black, the picture could pass as one of the black exploitation films of the day. There are few interesting action sequences – a motorboat chase is trite enough to begin with, but the filmmakers make it worse by throwing in some stupid Louisiana cops, including pot-bellied Sheriff Pepper." ...|$|E
