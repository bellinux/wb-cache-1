25|$|Although many kiosks {{have been}} fitted with {{replacement}} backs over recent years, unmodified examples generally have the identity of their manufacturer marked on a plate on the outside {{at the bottom of}} their <b>back</b> <b>panel.</b> The only exceptions are the few Mk1 models made by Bratt Colbran, which are anonymous. A supplementary way of identifying the manufacturer is by means of casting marks on the various component parts – i.e. LF, CC, MF, MS and BC – which were used to various extents over the years. A more consistent manufacturer mark can be found at about shoulder height on the inner face of the <b>back</b> <b>panel.</b> These marks generally identify both the manufacturer and the precise model of kiosk. Up to around 1949, the year of manufacture is also included. The more recently erected non-BT K6 kiosks (generally painted black) are for the most part new castings, sourced from new manufacturers.|$|E

25|$|The iPhone 4 {{features}} a redesigned structure, designed by Jonathan Ive, {{a design that}} would later be reused and adapted for the iPhone 4S, 5, 5S and SE. Most notably, the bulges of the <b>back</b> <b>panel</b> {{as well as the}} band between the front and back are gone and have been replaced with flattened surfaces. The redesign reflects the utilitarianism and uniformity of existing Apple products, such as the iPad and the iMac. The overall dimensions of the iPhone 4 have been reduced from its predecessor.|$|E
25|$|A year later, he {{came across}} another problem from {{hardware}} engineers working on the institute's next computer: minimize the amount of wire needed to connect the pins on the <b>back</b> <b>panel</b> of the machine. As a solution, he re-discovered the algorithm known as Prim's minimal spanning tree algorithm. The Prim's algorithm was originally developed in 1930 by Czech mathematician Vojtěch Jarník and later independently rediscovered and republished by Robert C. Prim in 1957 and Dijkstra in 1959. Therefore, it is also sometimes called the DJP algorithm.|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} half of the 16th century the temple was {{furnished}} in the new Renaissance style. They maintained the four and six seat stalla with wooden inlays, dated from 1568 to 1569 on the side. This is attributed to George Tischler from Kezmarok. On the western chorus in 1634 a large organ was built with rich early Baroque ornamentation and sculpture of St. Michael the Archangel at the top. The northern side of the central presbytery under the Gothic arcades two tribunes with early Baroque railing were added. Into the outer side organ with rich polychrome decoration was put. At the top of the middle organ tower there is a sculpture of King David and on the sides there are statues of angels from Presov carvers. To the column between presbyteries of central and southern naves a baptistery was built in the Renaissance style in {{the second half}} of the 16th century. It was made of red marble with wrought copper lid. The lid is made of copper and it is decorated with wrought iron ornaments elevating by rope threaded through the bracket, with relief decorations of winged heads of angels, decorated with wrought scrolls, and on the metal sheet painting decoration of representation of Christ's baptism. Beaten grid with high sculpture of the Good Shepherd on the roof in northern presbytery comes from the same period. It was built at a time when it served the Presov German Lutheran Church. Originally it was an exit from the area of the temple, today it is entrance to the vestry. Stalla are decorated with herm pilasters. The pulpit was made in the 17th century in Renaissance style. Another relief of Christ and the Samaritan is the highlight of the rostrum to the arcuate windowsill. Another relief Christ, this time on a stormy sea, is located on the <b>back</b> <b>panel</b> of the pulpit. A statue of the Good Shepherd and the carved symbols of the three divine virtues rest on a canopy. In 1634 the church was bleached and in 1641 the tower was repaired. In {{the second half of}} the 17th century organ gallery was made with carved railing, which includes a smooth sill and a niche with the figure of Christ in its middle. On the sides it has columns decorated with wrapped vines. The parapet is decorated with ornaments and figurines.|$|E

500|$|The {{statue of}} A'a is a wooden {{anthropomorphic}} figure, 117cm high and 36cm wide. [...] It is, in {{the estimation of}} Alfred Gell, [...] "arguably the finest extant piece of Polynesian sculpture". The figure is hollow, and has a removable <b>back</b> <b>panel</b> allowing access to the interior. [...] The sculpture's arms are carved in high relief; its legs are separated and slightly bent. [...] The figure has no feet or base, and it is unknown if it did when it was created. [...] The lower legs, right buttock, and left arm of the sculpture are damaged, and the penis has been broken off completely. [...] While the other damage could {{be the result of}} deterioration over time, the severing of the figure's penis appears to have been deliberate, though it is not known whether it was by British missionaries or Polynesian converts.|$|E
500|$|Phantasmagoria {{was heavily}} advertised by Sierra {{in advance of}} its release, and the company touted it as its biggest game to date. It was Sierra's first {{computer}} game targeted to an adult audience. There was no legislated rating system for computer games in the United States in place, although one was being debated before the U.S. Senate at the time. Sierra was among several major software companies that voluntarily supported the ratings system designed by the Entertainment Software Rating Board, which rated games so adults could make decisions about software purchases. The game was given an [...] "M" [...] rating for [...] "mature" [...] audiences, meaning intended for audiences 17 or older. As a result it carried a content warning on the box that said [...] "contains adult subject matter". The game box prominently displayed this rating, {{as well as a}} warning on the <b>back</b> <b>panel</b> that the game contains adult subject matter inappropriate for children. It also encouraged parents to review the material before providing it to children and asked retailers not to sell it to minors. Phantasmagoria also received mature ratings in Germany and the United Kingdom.|$|E

40|$|What is the risk? Given that astronauts {{exposed to}} {{microgravity}} experience a cephalad fluid shift, {{and that both}} symptomatic and asymptomatic astronauts have exhibited optic nerve sheath edema on MRI, {{there is a high}} probability that all astronauts have some degree of increased intracranial pressure (ICP; intracranial hypertension), and that those susceptible (via eye architecture, anatomy, narrow optic disc) have a high likelihood of developing papilledema (optic disc edema, globe flattening), choroidal folds, and/or hyperopic shifts and that the degree of edema may determine long-term or permanent vision impairment or loss. <b>Back</b> to <b>back</b> <b>panels</b> on this topic have been developed to address this emerging risk. The first panel will focus on the 6 clinical cases with emphasis on ophthalmic findings and imaging techniques used pre-, in-, and post-flight. The second panel will discuss the operational mitigation and medical requirements, the potential role of CO 2 on ISS, and the research approach being developed. In total these <b>back</b> to <b>back</b> <b>panels</b> will explore what is known about this risk, what has been done immediately to address it, and how an integrated research model is being developed...|$|R
2500|$|To give extra {{fullness}} to the back, {{there are}} often pleats where the <b>back</b> <b>panel</b> joins to the yoke. [...] On some fittings these are not needed, and handmade shirts may feature the extra fabric being worked continuously into the seam. [...] In America, a box pleat is common (two pleats together in the centre), while in Britain the pleats are placed wider out under the shoulders.|$|E
2500|$|Chick tracts {{end with}} a {{suggested}} prayer for the reader to pray to accept Jesus Christ. In most of these tracts it is a standard sinner's prayer for salvation. In the tracts dealing with [...] "false religions", the prayer includes a clause to reject these religions. Included with the prayer are directions for converting to Christianity, which is also repeated on the inside <b>back</b> <b>panel</b> along with steps to take should the reader convert to Christianity.|$|E
2500|$|In naval architecture, {{the term}} [...] "transom" [...] has two meanings. [...] First, a transom {{can refer to}} any of the {{individual}} beams that run side-to-side or [...] "athwart" [...] the hull at any point abaft the fashion timber; second, a transom can refer specifically to the flat or slightly curved surface that is the very <b>back</b> <b>panel</b> of a transom stern. [...] In this sense, a transom stern is the product of the use of a series of transoms, and hence the two terms have blended.|$|E
50|$|The {{printed paper}} sleeve for a {{standard}} DVD {{case can be}} printed on a standard A4 sheet of paper which, after cropping, can be slipped into the outer jacket. The paper room {{on the front and}} <b>back</b> <b>panels</b> of the case is 129.5mm × 183mm and spine panels have a width of 14mm or less. This gives 273mm × 183mm as resulting maximum overall dimensions for the printout (which is less than the 297mm × 210mm of an A4 paper sheet).|$|R
50|$|Wood {{panelling}} or wainscoting, {{almost always}} made from oak, became popular in Northern Europe from the 14th century, after European carpenters rediscovered the techniques to create frame and panel joinery. The framing technique was used from the 13th century onwards to clad interior walls, to form choir stalls, and to manufacture moveable and semi-moveable furniture, such as chests and presses, {{and even the}} <b>back</b> <b>panels</b> of joined chairs. Linenfold was developed as a simple technique to decorate the flat surfaces of the ubiquitous panels thus created.|$|R
50|$|The {{seat and}} the <b>back</b> <b>panels</b> {{are created by}} the cross pieces {{designed}} in a mold. In this way, the problematic sharp bend between the seat and the back is avoided {{and the length of}} individual rods is shortened. The seat and back are curved to the shape of the body. The rear legs extend into the armrest. The formation of this element requires high-quality wood with a good deal of waste involved. This is a prefabricated chair held together with bolts and nuts.|$|R
