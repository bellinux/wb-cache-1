However, any online voting system is susceptible to the Sybil attack where adversaries can out-vote real users by creating several Sybil identities. In this paper, we present SumUp, a Sybilresilient online content rating system that leverages trust networks among users to defend against Sybil attacks with strong security guarantees. SumUp addresses the <b>basic</b> <b>vote</b> aggregation {{problem of how to}} aggregate votes from different users in a trust network in the face of Sybil identities casting an arbitrarily large number of bogus votes. By using the technique of adaptive vote flow aggregation, SumUp can significantly limit the number of bogus votes cast by adversaries to no more than the number of attack edges in the trust network (with high probability). SumUp leverages user voting history to further restrict the voting power of adversaries who continuously misbehave to below the attack edges. Using detailed evaluation of several existing social networks (Digg, YouTube, Flickr, Live-Journal), we show SumUp’s ability to handle Sybil attack. By applying SumUp on the voting trace of Digg (online news voting site), we have detected strong evidence of attack on many articles marked “popular ” by Digg. ...|$|E

With these two modifications of the standard Hough transform we incorporate principles of orientation consensus and thus sharpen the peaks in the parameter space.

40|$|Abstract. We present three voting {{protocols}} with unconditional {{privacy and}} information-theoretic correctness, without assuming any bound {{on the number}} of corrupt voters or voting authorities. All protocols have polynomial complexity and require private channels and a simultaneous broadcast channel. Our first protocol is a <b>basic</b> <b>voting</b> scheme which allows voters to interact in order to compute the tally. Privacy of the ballot is unconditional, but any voter can cause the protocol to fail, in which case information about the tally may nevertheless transpire. Our second protocol introduces voting authorities which allow the implementation of the first protocol, while reducing the interaction and limiting it to be only between voters and authorities and among the authorities themselves. The simultaneous broadcast is also limited to the authorities. As long as a single authority is honest, the privacy is unconditional, however, a single corrupt authority or a single corrupt voter can cause the protocol to fail. Our final protocol provides a safeguard against corrupt voters by enabling a verification technique to allow the authorities to revoke incorrect votes. We also discuss the implementation of a simultaneous broadcast channel with the use of temporary computational assumptions, yielding versions of our protocols achieving everlasting security...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} most recent issues in the ongoing debate on the reform of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The Fund has {{recognized}} that IMF surveillance should put greater weight on analyzing and discussing global economic issues. By taking account of international spillovers, surveillance should in future be multilateral rather than purely country-specific. Exchange rates and policies should also {{be the focus of}} renewed interest. Moreover, {{there is no doubt that}} IMF quotas will have to be adjusted to take account of the changing economic weight of many IMF member countries in the world economy. Negotiations on a new quota formula started after the Annual Meeting in Singapore in September 2006. The influence of low income countries should be strengthened by increasing the number of <b>basic</b> <b>votes</b> in order to prevent the Fund from loosing legitimacy. However, with the IMF’s intention to put more weight on GDP in the new quota formula, the stage is set for complex, difficult and time-consuming negotiations. Finally, the IMF will need to reform its financing system and budgeting procedures to ensure that expenditures will be adequately curtailed to enable it to work efficiently despite income shortfalls, which might well be not transitory but of a permanent nature.

40|$|The International Monetary Fund {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{international}} organizations using a weighted voting system. The weights of its 188 members are determined by a fixed amount of <b>basic</b> <b>votes</b> plus some extra votes for so-called Special Drawing Rights (SDR). On January 26, 2016, the conditions for the SDRs were increased at the 14 th General Quota Review, which drastically changed the corresponding voting weights. However, since the share of voting weights in general is not equal to the influence, of a committee member on the committees overall decision, so-called power indices were introduced. So far the power distribution of the IMF was only computed by either approximation procedures or smaller games than then entire Board of Governors consisting of 188 members. We improve existing algorithms, based on dynamic programming, for the computation of power indices and provide the exact results for the IMF Board of Governors before and after the increase of voting weights. Tuned low-level details of the algorithms allow the repeated routine with sparse computational resources and can of course be applied to other large voting bodies. It turned out that the Banzhaf power shares are rather sensitive to changes of the quota. Comment: 19 pages, 2 figures, 13 table...|$|R
40|$|We present three voting {{protocols}} with unconditional {{privacy and}} correctness, without assuming any bound {{on the number}} of corrupt participants. All protocols have polynomial complexity and require private channels and a simultaneous broadcast channel. Unlike previously proposed protocols in this model, the protocols that we present deterministically output the exact tally. Our first protocol is a <b>basic</b> <b>voting</b> scheme which allows voters to interact in order to compute the tally. Privacy of the ballot is unconditional in the sense that regardless of the behavior of the dishonest participants nothing can be learned through the protocol that could not be learned in an ideal realisation. Unfortunately, a single dishonest participant can make the protocol abort, in which case the dishonest participants can nevertheless learn the outcome of the tally. Our second protocol introduces voting authorities which improves the communication complexity by limiting interaction to be only between voters and authorities and among the authorities themselves; the simultaneous broadcast is also limited to the authorities. In the second protocol, as long as a single authority is honest, the privacy is unconditional, however, a single corrupt authority or a single corrupt voter can cause the protocol to abort. Our final protocol provides a safeguard against corrupt voters by enabling a verification technique to allow the authorities to revoke incorrect votes without aborting the protocol.

40|$|The 2000 {{election}} {{ignited a}} fierce {{controversy over the}} machinery used for voting. Civil rights advocates have called for the replacement of outdated paper-based voting equipment, like the infamous “hanging chad” punch card. Yet the introduction of paperless technology, especially electronic “touchscreen” machines, has induced widespread concern that software might be rigged to alter election results. This article examines the debate over electronic voting, which raises fundamental questions about the democratic values that should guide the administration of elections. It frames the debate by defining four equality norms embodied in federal voting rights laws and the Constitution. Electronic voting {{has the potential to}} advance racial equality, disability access, and multilingual access. At the same time, there are legitimate concerns surrounding the implementation of present-generation technology. The proposed “voter verified paper audit trail” is unlikely to resolve these concerns, though other measures may be taken to promote security and transparency. The article concludes that legislatures and courts have important roles to play in the transformation of voting technology, but that the most important decisions lie in the hands of state and local election officials. It suggests a legal structure that will protect <b>basic</b> <b>voting</b> rights while allowing for innovation and experimentation.

40|$|Mesothelioma {{is a form}} {{of cancer}} {{generally}} caused from previous exposure to asbestos. Although it was considered a rare neoplasm in the past, its incidence is increasing worldwide due to extensive use of asbestos. In the current practice of medicine, the gold standard for diagnosing mesothelioma is through a pleural biopsy with subsequent histologic examination of the tissue. The diagnostic tissue should demonstrate the invasion by the tumor and is obtained through thoracoscopy or open thoracotomy, both being highly invasive surgical operations. On the other hand, thoracocentesis, which is removal of effusion fluid from the pleural space, is a far less invasive procedure that can provide material for cytological examination. In this study, we aim at detecting and classifying malignant mesothelioma based on the nuclear chromatin distribution from digital images of mesothelial cells in effusion cytology specimens. Accordingly, a computerized method is developed to determine whether a set of nuclei belonging to a patient is benign or malignant. The quantification of chromatin distribution is performed by using the optimal transport-based linear embedding for segmented nuclei in combination with the modified Fisher discriminant analysis. Classification is then performed through a k-nearest neighborhood approach and a <b>basic</b> <b>voting</b> strategy. Our experiments on 34 different human cases result in 100 % accurate predictions computed with blind cross validation. Experimental comparisons also show that the new method can significantly outperform standard numerical feature-type methods in terms of agreement with the clinical diagnosis gold standard.

This question has launched a wide theoretical debate in both economics and political science, but convincing empirical support for the dierent models proposed is still rare. The <b>basic</b> rational <b>voting</b> model of Downs (1957) predicts zero participation because each individual vote is extremely unlikely to be pivotal.

40|$|Economic voting {{models have}} {{received}} {{a great deal of}} empirical support in Great Britain over the last decade, sustaining the general argument that governments tend to be rewarded for delivering econmic prosperity but blamed for declining prosperity. Voters evaluate governments both at the national scale (the performance of the national economy) and at the individual or household scale (changes in their own perceived financial situation). Results of a cross-sectional study of the respondents to a survey conducted after the 1997 General Election are consistent with this argument. The case is developed, however, that additional variables should be added, representing: an intermediate spatial scale [...] perceived changes in the voters' local economy; the attribution of credit/blame [...] governments should only be rewarded (punished) if voters associate economic changes with government policies; the local context [...] the actual situation in the voters' milieux; and the electoral context [...] do voters' economic evaluations have a differential impact depending on whether they voted for the successful party at the previous election.
