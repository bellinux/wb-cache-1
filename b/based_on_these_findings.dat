40|$|Comprehension of {{information}} conveyed by emotional tone of speech is highly important for successful social interactions. Regarding the underlying neurobiological mechanisms, successive steps of cerebral processing involving auditory analysis within the temporal cortex and evaluative judgements within the frontal lobes have been differentiated (Schirmer & Kotz, 2006; Wildgruber et al., 2006). To further disentangle {{the impact of}} stimulus properties and appraisal levels a series of fMRI studies has been performed. The results of these studies indicate a strong association of cerebral responses and acoustic properties of the stimuli in some regions (stimulus-driven effects), whereas other areas showed modulation of activation linked to the focussing of attention to specific task components (task-dependent effects). <b>Based</b> <b>on</b> <b>these</b> <b>finding...</b>|$|R

25|$|Dureza, a dark-skinned grape variety {{from the}} Ardèche region in France, {{has all but}} {{disappeared}} from the vineyards, and the preservation of such varieties is a speciality of Montpellier. Mondeuse blanche is a white grape variety cultivated in the Savoy region, and is still found in very small amounts in that region's vineyards today. Both varieties are somewhat obscure today, and have never achieved anything near Syrah's fame or popularity, {{and there is no}} record of them ever having been cultivated at long distances from their present homes. Thus, both of Syrah's parents come from a limited area in southeastern France, very close to northern Rhône. <b>Based</b> <b>on</b> <b>these</b> <b>findings,</b> the researchers have concluded Syrah originated from northern Rhône.|$|E
30|$|In this report, {{our case}} was not {{complicated}} by aspiration pneumonia or systematic inflammatory response syndrome, and re-expansion via drainage was successful. <b>Base</b> <b>on</b> <b>these</b> <b>findings,</b> {{we performed a}} one-stage closure of the BPF. Closure {{was expected to be}} difficult for three reasons: (1) the pulmonary artery and bronchopleural stump were contiguous, (2) the fistula was too large to close easily, and (3) the middle lobe bronchus was near the BPF. We initially considered performing a middle lobectomy; however, we rejected this option due to the presence of thick adhesions in the hilum. During the primary operation, the latissimus dorsi muscle and anterior serratus muscle were dissected via posterolateral incision; therefore, it was difficult to cover or wedge the bronchopleural stump using the muscle flaps.|$|R

25|$|American {{researcher}} William Thompson {{headed the}} research team for the IPSFC, which tagged fish at various upstream locations, from which data could be collected for analysis. One of these sites was at Hells Gate, where scientists captured salmon along the banks with fill nets, tagged them, removed some of their scales for racial analysis, and then released {{them back into the}} river. In 1938, the IPSFC discovered {{what appeared to be a}} blockage of Fraser sockeye salmon at Hells Gate. Fish were turning up in tagging nets more than once, being held up behind the narrow passage of river, and re-appearing far downstream after being tagged. <b>Based</b> <b>on</b> <b>these</b> <b>findings,</b> Thompson decided to place increased emphasis on Hells Gate beginning in 1939.|$|E
25|$|<b>Based</b> <b>on</b> <b>these</b> <b>findings,</b> Mabus {{considered}} a court-martial for Toussaint but ultimately decided against it, {{because of the}} amount of time that had passed between the incidents and the report, the previous review of the incidents and the short amount of time between Toussaint's return from an overseas deployment and the end of his enlistment. On October 21, the Navy announced that Toussaint would be reassigned to Naval Special Warfare Group 2 in Norfolk, Virginia where he would have no command responsibilities. He received a letter of censure. His planned re-enlistment was denied and he was forced to retire in January 2010. Roughead has also ordered the Naval Criminal Investigative Service to re-examine the case. Sestak has called for Congressional hearings into the hazing allegations.|$|E

40|$|The {{electronic}} structure of SrTiO 3 (001) surfaces was studied using scanning tunneling spectroscopy and density-functional theory. With {{high dynamic range}} measurements, an in-gap transition level was observed on SrO-terminated surfaces, at 2. 7 eV above the valence band maximum. The density of centers responsible for this level was found to increase with surface segregation of oxygen vacancies and decrease with exposure to molecular oxygen. <b>Based</b> <b>on</b> <b>these</b> <b>finding,</b> the level is attributed to surface O vacancies. A level at a similar energy is predicted theoretically on SrO-terminated surfaces. For TiO 2 -terminated surfaces, no discrete in-gap state was observed, although one is predicted theoretically.

500|$|In {{water tank}} testing, {{engineers}} subjected G-ALYU to repeated re-pressurisation and over-pressurisation, and on 24 June 1954, after 3,057 flight cycles (1,221 actual and 1,836 simulated), G-ALYU burst open. Hall, Geoffrey de Havilland and Bishop were immediately {{called to the}} scene, where the water tank was drained to reveal that the fuselage had ripped open at {{a corner of the}} forward left escape hatch cutout. A further test reproduced the same results. [...] <b>Based</b> <b>on</b> <b>these</b> <b>findings,</b> Comet 1 structural failures could be expected at anywhere from 1,000 to 9,000 cycles. Before the Elba accident, G-ALYP had made 1,290 pressurised flights, while G-ALYY had made 900 pressurised flights before crashing. Dr P.B. Walker, Head of the Structures Department at the RAE, said he was not surprised by this, noting that the difference was about three to one, and previous experience with metal fatigue suggested a total range of nine to one between experiment and outcome in the field could result in failure.|$|E

Co-director Jennifer Lee created a cheerful wardrobe featuring [...] "playful" [...] floral patterns and saturated colors in order to accurately reflect Anna's personality. The animators also took into account the climate that Anna is living in, costuming her in heavy wools and velvets, reflecting traditional winter clothing of the Scandinavian area.

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Brosius became {{interested}} in a small brain-specific RNA that {{was thought to be}} a waste product of a mechanism orchestrating the expression of genes by RNA polymerase III transcription of identifier sequence (ID) repetitive elements, classified as SINEs, short interspersed repeats, located in the introns of brain-specific genes by making chromatin [...] accessible to RNA polymerase II. This attractive hypothesis was not tenable. Instead, the Brosius laboratory focused on this brain cytoplasmic BC1 RNA, cloned it as cDNA by developing a method for generating cDNA libraries based on non-polyadenylated RNAs, and isolated its single gene, which evolved from a retroposed copy of a transfer RNA (tRNAAla). It was shown that BC1 RNA is the source gene for ID repetitive elements in rodents, and his laboratory established that the dendritic localization of BC1 RNA in neurons co-localizes with numerous components of the translation machinery. <b>Based</b> <b>on</b> <b>these</b> <b>findings,</b> Brosius concluded as early as the eighties that: ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, {{more than}} half the water samples taken from 53 DC-area homes under the {{procedures}} required by the EPA's Lead and Copper Rule showed levels of lead exceeding the national standard of 15 parts per billion (ppb). [...] Lead disrupts the physical and mental development of fetuses, babies, and young children, and can cause kidney problems and high blood pressure in adults. The rule does not assume that there is a [...] "safe" [...] level of exposure, but notes that 15 ppb is an [...] "action level" [...] where utilities must take action. The rule was created in 1991, after research showed that drinking water could account for one-fifth of all lead intake. Lead is not normally present in drinking water; it is released from the inside surface of lead service lines (pipes that run from the main to the house), joints connected with lead-based solder, and lead fixtures inside the house. <b>Based</b> <b>on</b> <b>these</b> <b>findings,</b> WASA was required to notify the public and implement plans to replace lead service lines in key areas of the municipal water system.|$|E
2500|$|Research {{carried out}} in the 1980s {{revealed}} that a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell mutant called XR-1 was [...] "extremely sensitive" [...] with regard to being killed by gamma rays during the G1 portion of the cell cycle but, in the same research studies, showed [...] "nearly normal resistance" [...] to gamma-ray damage during the late S phase; {{and in the course of}} this research, XR-1’s cell-cycle sensitivity was correlated with its inability to repair DNA double-strand breaks produced by ionizing radiation and restriction enzymes. [...] In particular, in a study using somatic cell hybrids of XR-1 cells and human fibroblasts, Giaccia et al. (1989) showed that the XR-1 mutation was a recessive mutation; [...] and in follow-up to this work, Giaccia et al. (1990) carried out further studies examining the XR-1 mutation (again using somatic cell hybrids formed between XR-1 and human fibroblasts) and were able to map the human complementing gene to chromosome 5 using chromosome-segregation analysis. [...] Giaccia et al, tentatively assigned this human gene the name “XRCC4” (an abbreviation of “X-ray-complementing Chinese hamster gene 4”) and determined that (a) the newly named XRCC4 gene biochemically restored the hamster defect to normal levels of resistance to gamma-ray radiation and bleomycin and (b) the XRCC4 gene restored the proficiency to repair DNA DSBs.
