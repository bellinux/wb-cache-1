In those regions where a few suppliers or marketing agents dominate the market, prices may rise wellabove the comptitive ideal of marginal cost. Furthermore, if all customers do not shift instantaneously to the lowest-priced supplier, perhaps because of inadequate information about the reliability of alternative generators and/or additional investments required to switch suppliers, then depending upon the duration of those lags, the optimal pricing policy of the existing dominant generators may be to ignore the competition for an appreciable period of time.

The interconnection of large quantities of the distributed power sources, such as PV power sources, to the current <b>bulk</b> <b>power</b> grids is anticipated, and as a result, fluctuations of voltage and frequency will increase and make the adjustment of the power demand-supply balance difficult.
