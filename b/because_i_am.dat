5|$|When {{you were}} hungry, {{you began to}} cry, because you could not speak. You were seven months without teeth, always sucking. But after you got one, you began to gnaw a crust of bread. It {{was not long before}} another came pop. At ten months you had four pretty white teeth, and you used to bite me. Poor mamma! Still I did not cry, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not a child, but you hurt me very much. So I said to papa, it is time the little girl should eat. She is not naughty, yet she hurts me. I have given her a crust of bread, and I must look for some other milk.|$|E

25|$|I {{would not}} wish to a dog or to a snake, to the most low and misfortunate {{creature}} of the earth, I would {{not wish to}} any of them what I have had to suffer for things that I am not guilty of. But my conviction is that I have suffered for things that I am guilty of. I am suffering <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a radical and indeed I am a radical; I have suffered <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> an Italian and indeed I am an Italian...if you could execute me two times, and if I could be reborn two other times, I would live again to do what I have done already.|$|E
5000|$|Born in San Cataldo, Caltanissetta, Messina {{was from}} a family of mafiosi going back a few generations. [...] "I {{represent}} the seventh generation belonging to Cosa Nostra," [...] he said. [...] "I <b>was</b> affiliated not <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a robber or <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> able to kill, but <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> bound to become a member by family tradition." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You noticed, at least, I suppose, {{that she}} was not afraid to speak. I never {{repeated}} it, not <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> jealous, but <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> curious to see how long your ignorance would last if left to itself." ...|$|R

25|$|Meryl Streep and Freida Pinto, actresses and ambassadors of <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> <b>Am</b> a Girl, {{expressed}} their {{support to the}} director and film. On 9 March, the documentary film screened during an event at Baruch College, New York City, which was attended by Meryl Streep, Chris Martin, Dakota Fanning and Freida Pinto.|$|E
25|$|Awakening (2000) was {{produced}} Performance Space 122 and {{was based on}} the 1899 novel The Awakening by Kate Chopin. The play is about the character Edna who is in an unsatisfactory marriage and also includes Kate Chopin as a character. Chiori Miyagawa stated that she was drawn to write an adaption of the novel because of the main character, “All my theatrical characters are outsiders in different ways, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> one”.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, in 1903 {{at the age}} of 24, {{her plans}} to study to become a teacher in Tokyo came to nothing. In a letter to Mrs. Abendanon, R.A. Kartini wrote that the plan had been {{abandoned}} because {{she was going to be}} married..."In short, I no longer desire to take advantage of this opportunity, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> to be married..". This was despite the fact that for its part, the Dutch Education Department had finally given permission for R.A. Kartini and R.Ay. Rukmini to study in Batavia.|$|E
60|$|I {{went on with}} my hair now, quite comfortably. I sobbed {{a little}} still, but that <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> crying, not <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> crying then.|$|R

3000|$|... “I {{became very}} anxious as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> getting {{more into the}} gambling. Maybe it’s <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> worried about the money I lost, the money <b>I</b> borrowed… <b>I</b> <b>was</b> also scared that <b>I</b> might not <b>be</b> able to control myself forever. Then <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> so anxious, <b>I</b> needed to do something. Then I went to the casino or bar to gamble.” [...]...|$|R
25|$|Walking {{the streets}} of Venice, Aschenbach is accosted at every turn by beggars, street sellers and others {{demanding}} his custom. Seeing rubbish {{on the streets and}} smelling the foul water of the canals, he feels nauseated and claustrophobic, and decides that he must leave Venice. Back at the hotel, the Manager expresses his regret over Aschenbach's departure. When Tadzio returns Aschenbach's glances, Aschenbach himself also feels regret. On arriving at the station, Aschenbach finds that his luggage has been sent on the wrong train ("I am furious <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> forced to return, but secretly I rejoice. Vacillating, irresolute, absurd"), and he realises upon seeing Tadzio again that the boy was the cause of his regret at leaving.|$|E
25|$|Dear Princess, as I {{have already}} cabled you, I granted leave to Gogo , {{but only for}} your sake. He himself, of course, has not earned it, and {{unfortunately}} I must again repeat that I am extremely dissatisfied with his services. Both when on duty and on board during cruises he simply {{does not want to}} do anything at all; neither advice, nor the example of others have any effect whatever on him. Laziness, untidiness, and total lack of self esteem make him the laughing stock of his comrades and draw upon him the dissatisfaction of his superiors, who do {{not know what to do}} with him. Today I gave him a severe reprimand, and have ordered his superior, that is the Commander of the Ship, to punish him severely for every misdemeanor! Perhaps that will have some effect. I am writing you all this, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> afraid that Gogo will hide the truth from you, all the more as he is past-master at inventing excuses and talking himself out of trouble. It seems to me he would do better to transfer to land service, for he will never make a good sailor! It is very unpleasant for me to have to write you all this, but what can I do. I send you my best wishes for the New Year, and trust that you and the children are well.|$|E

500|$|Thompson, {{although}} born in London, has {{confessed to}} feeling Scottish: [...] "not only <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> half Scottish {{but also because}} I've spent half my life here". She frequently returns to Scotland and visits Dunoon in Argyll and Bute, where she owns a home.|$|E
500|$|... "If the {{director}} tells the producer {{that he wants}} 50 camels, the latter will probably say, 'Why not 25? Can't you manage with 25 camels?' Whereas, if he is telling me the same thing... I will not waste time asking him questions <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> also creatively aware why he needs them." ...|$|E

500|$|While she dislikes being {{referred}} to as [...] "Bono's wife", she has said, [...] " [...] I really don't have a big problem with my own identity, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a very private person, so I've always let Bono take the brunt of anything that was coming along. He is happy to do that; I am quite happy {{to make my own}} way around things." ...|$|E
500|$|The show also {{featured}} many, often acclaimed, one-off sketches, like Two Soups, where Julie Walters plays an elderly deaf waitress who takes an incredibly {{long time to}} take an order for two bowls of soup. In 2004, British television network Channel 4 (in a poll conducted on its website) awarded it [...] "27th Best Comedy Sketch Of All Time". Walters said [...] "she [...] knows I like playing old women. Why? <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> one! I love the shape of them." ...|$|E

500|$|Sitti Nurbaya {{inspired}} numerous authors, including Nur Sutan Iskandar, who {{stated that}} he wrote Apa Dayaku Karena Aku Perempuan (What Am I to Do <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> <b>Am</b> a Girl, 1924) {{as a direct result}} of reading it; Iskandar later wrote Cinta yang Membawa Maut (Love that Brings Death, 1926), which deals with the same themes. The Sitti Nurbaya storyline has often been reused, to the point that Balfas has referred to similar plots as following [...] "the Sitti Nurbaya formula".|$|E
500|$|Alongside {{her acting}} career, Pinto has been {{actively}} involved with several humanitarian causes and is vocal about the uplifting {{of women and}} underprivileged children. She has cited Angelina Jolie and Malala Yousafzai as [...] "massive" [...] inspirations in this regard. In 2010, Pinto joined Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf in support of their philanthropic organisation, the Agassi Foundation. She raised $75,000 for their annual fund raiser—"The 15th Grand Slam for Children"—which was aimed at providing education for underprivileged children. Two years later, she was appointed as the global ambassador of Plan International's <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a Girl, a campaign that promotes gender equality {{with the aim of}} lifting millions of girls out of poverty.|$|E
500|$|And the Band Played On was {{critically}} acclaimed {{and became a}} best-seller. Judith Eannarino of the Library Journal called it [...] "one {{of the most important}} books of the year", upon its release. It made Shilts both a star and a pariah for his coverage of the disease and the bitter politics in the gay community. He described his motivation to undertake the writing of the book in an interview after its release, saying, [...] "Any good reporter could have done this story, but I think the reason I did it, and no one else did, is <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> gay. It was happening to people I cared about and loved." [...] The book was later adapted into an HBO film of the same name in 1993. Shilts was tested for HIV while he was writing the book; he died of complications from AIDS in 1994.|$|E
