When the OS VBI routine is enabled direct updates to the ANTIC DLIST registers by the CPU or the ANTIC Jump instructions will be overwritten by the OS {{during the next}} Vertical Blank. This implies that an ANTIC JVB (Jump and wait for Vertical <b>Blank)</b> <b>instruction</b> that specifies an invalid address (or a valid address that differs from the shadow SDLST value) has no real affect on the display.|$|E
5000|$|Blank Mode lines {{cannot be}} {{contained}} within a scrolling region, because <b>Blank</b> Mode line <b>instructions</b> inherently {{do not have}} a Vertical Scroll Modifier bit. (<b>Blank</b> Mode line <b>instructions</b> specify the <b>blank</b> line count using the bits 7 through 5 that function as LMS, HS, and VS Modifiers for [...] "regular" [...] Playfield Mode <b>instructions.)</b> However, a <b>Blank</b> Mode <b>instruction</b> can be used to end a scrolling region and is still subject to the expected scan line height changes per the vertical scroll value.|$|R

50|$|Note {{that the}} DLI {{modifier}} bit {{is available for}} <b>blank</b> line <b>instructions.</b> When the DLI bit is enabled a Display List Interrupt will be triggered during the last scan line of the <b>blank</b> line(s) <b>instruction.</b> Since playfield DMA does not occur during blank lines (only Display list DMA and Player/Missile DMA (if enabled) occurs) the blank lines can be used where Playfield graphics will not be needed giving more time for Display List Interrupt routines changing color registers or Player/Missile positions.|$|R
50|$|The {{registers}} {{are also}} updated during Display List execution by ANTIC's JMP (Jump) and JVB (Jump {{and wait for}} Vertical <b>Blank).</b> These <b>instructions</b> load the full 16-bits of address, so {{can be used to}} circumvent the 1K Display List limitation.|$|R
40|$|Should {{modifications}} {{or other}} considerations {{be given to}} plans that use varied provider contract terms (capitated versus fee for service, etc.) ? Proposed Resolution: We recommend that no effort be made {{at this time to}} recharacterize capitated payments to providers as part claim and part administrative expense. Capitated payments will enter the calculation as clinical services Current statutory reporting requires staff and group model HMOs to accurately report administrative expenses (see Health <b>Blank</b> <b>instructions</b> Statement of Revenue and Expenses and SSAP No. 70 and No. 85). However, we urge Health and Human services and insurance regulators to follow provider contracting trends and keep watch for potential abuses to the intent of the MLR rebate provisions – preliminary resolution 7 / 8...|$|R
5000|$|Deyes {{signed a}} book deal with Blink Publishing in 2014, with his debut book The Pointless Book due for release in September {{of the same}} year. The book is part journal, part {{activity}} book and includes a free downloadable app and social media integration. It has been unfavourably compared to Keri Smith's Wreck This Journal, which contained some similar ideas. Rhik Samadder, for The Guardian, stated [...] "It’s {{a bit like the}} activity sheets given to children in museums and on planes to keep them quiet. Most of the pages are largely <b>blank,</b> containing <b>instructions</b> to [...] "Draw a selfie" [...] or [...] "Fill this page in with whatever you want!", and found that while [...] "It may not be Moby Dick", he stated that [...] "the Pointless Book is a canny piece of merchandising." ...|$|R

Wehmiller and Vincent Pellerito, 2015, Database of Quaternary Coastal Geochronologic Information for the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts of North America (additional {{information}} for sites in Peru and Chile) : Delaware Geological Survey Open File Report R 5, 7 pp. The database and supplemental files are all compressed using {{a program called}} 7 Zip, which can be downloaded from the internet. Open-File Report 50 presents and describes a database of geochronological {{information for}} coastal deposits of the US Atlantic and Pacific coasts, {{as well as for}} sites from the Pacific coast of South America. This database represents a synthesis of nearly forty years of study conducted by John F. Wehmiller and students in the Department of Geological Sciences, University of Delaware, as well as many collaborating colleagues. The majority of the chronological information in the database is based on amino acid racemization (AAR) data for fossil mollusks obtained from over 1000 collection sites. These chronological data have been used for various mapping, paleoenvironmental, stratigraphic, sea-level, and tectonic studies. In addition to the database itself, 18 on-line supplements containing information related to sample descriptions, sample and collection site photographs, field notes, supporting or related analytical data, and laboratory publications and technical reports are available. Periodic updates and additions will be made where appropriate. The database will be updated regularly to add new data or to complete entries that are currently <b>blank.</b> The <b>instructions</b> provided with the database indicate the date of the latest revision, as well as all revisions after the first release. Some output data from the Amino Acid Racemization Data Base (AARDB) are available at on-line mapping sites or are posted to the NOAA-World Data Center for archival preservation ([URL]...|$|R
