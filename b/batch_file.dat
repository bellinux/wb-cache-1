500|$|The protagonists {{eventually}} {{learn that}} the criminals are all connected to an organization called the [...] "WWW (World Three)". The WWW intentionally infects computer networks with computer viruses so as to hinder their normal operations and hack vital information. The group is led by Dr. Wily, a former colleague of Lan's grandfather. While working together, Wily had specialized in robotics while Lan's grandfather specialized in networks, which eventually led to NetNavis. The government cut Wily's funding, opting instead to pursue Hikari's NetNavi project. Wily's goal throughout the game is to collect four super programs with which the [...] "LifeVirus" [...] may be constructed. The LifeVirus is a nearly indestructible virus capable of wiping out the Net and all associated devices. The protagonists infiltrate the WWW, but MegaMan.EXE becomes disabled. Chaud arrives and gives Lan a <b>batch</b> <b>file</b> from Dr. Hikari to restore his Navi. After receiving the file [...] "Hub.bat", Lan questions his father about the name. It is revealed the MegaMan.EXE is actually a unique Navi made by Lan's father. When Lan's twin brother, Hub, died at a young age, Dr. Hikari transferred Hub's consciousness into the NetNavi MegaMan.EXE. This created a special physical and virtual bond between the two brothers. In the end, Lan and MegaMan.EXE manage to defeat Wily, destroy the LifeVirus, and restore peace to ACDC.|$|E
2500|$|While {{originally}} {{used primarily}} for encrypting {{the contents of}} e-mail messages and attachments from a desktop client, PGP products have been diversified since 2002 into a set of encryption applications which can be managed by an optional central policy server. [...] PGP encryption applications include e-mail and attachments, digital signatures, laptop full disk encryption, file and folder security, protection for IM sessions, <b>batch</b> <b>file</b> transfer encryption, and protection for files and folders stored on network servers and, more recently, encrypted or signed HTTP request/responses {{by means of a}} client-side (Enigform) and a server-side (mod openpgp) module. There is also a Wordpress plugin available, called wp-enigform-authentication, that takes advantage of the session management features of Enigform with mod_openpgp.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>batch</b> <b>file</b> {{is a kind}} of script file in DOS, OS/2 and Microsoft Windows. It {{consists}} of a series of commands to be executed by the command-line interpreter, stored in a plain text file. A <b>batch</b> <b>file</b> may contain any command the interpreter accepts interactively and use constructs that enable conditional branching and looping within the <b>batch</b> <b>file,</b> such as [...] "if", [...] "for", [...] "goto" [...] and labels. The term [...] "batch" [...] is from batch processing, meaning [...] "non-interactive execution", though a <b>batch</b> <b>file</b> may not process a batch of multiple data.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Batch</b> <b>files</b> and the <b>batch</b> {{processor}} {{could be}} used to issue a series of commands with some rudimentary control flow. <b>Batch</b> <b>files</b> had the extension [...]BAT.|$|R
50|$|The {{detailed}} {{handling of}} <b>batch</b> <b>files</b> has changed. Some of the detail {{in this article}} applies to all <b>batch</b> <b>files,</b> while other details apply only to certain versions.|$|R
5000|$|...bat: The first {{filename}} extension used by Microsoft for <b>batch</b> <b>files.</b> This extension runs with DOS and all versions of Windows, under COMMAND.COM or cmd.exe, despite {{the different ways}} the two command interpreters execute <b>batch</b> <b>files.</b>|$|R
50|$|In October 1999, Dale Shipp {{created a}} fix called BWREPFIX that corrects {{the problem on}} the users end. This {{solution}} uses a <b>batch</b> <b>file</b> in the archiver section rather than calling the archiver directly. In the <b>batch</b> <b>file,</b> the outbound message dates are fixed and then the <b>batch</b> <b>file</b> calls the archiver which then packs the messages for transmitting to the BBS.|$|E
50|$|SYS$INPUT - Standard input. Used interactively, this {{represents}} the terminal keyboard. Used in a <b>batch</b> <b>file,</b> it is <b>batch</b> <b>file</b> lines not preceded with a $ symbol, or specified as an input deck using the DECK command.|$|E
50|$|OS/2's <b>batch</b> <b>file</b> {{interpreter}} {{also supports}} an EXTPROC command. This passes the <b>batch</b> <b>file</b> {{to the program}} named on the EXTPROC file as a data file. The named program can be a script file; {{this is similar to}} the #! mechanism.|$|E
5000|$|The Unix [...] {{mechanism}} and OS/2 EXTPROC command facilitate {{the passing of}} <b>batch</b> <b>files</b> to external processors. One can use these mechanisms to write specific command processors for dedicated uses, and process external data files which reside in <b>batch</b> <b>files.</b>|$|R
5000|$|As {{with any}} other {{programming}} language, <b>batch</b> <b>files</b> can be used maliciously. Simple trojans and fork bombs are easily created, and <b>batch</b> <b>files</b> can do a form of DNS poisoning by modifying the hosts <b>file.</b> <b>Batch</b> viruses are possible, and can also spread themselves via USB flash drives by using Windows' Autorun capability.|$|R

5000|$|So {{to run a}} <b>batch</b> <b>file</b> on a UNC share, {{assign a}} {{temporary}} drive letter to the UNC share, and use the UNC share as the working directory of the <b>batch</b> <b>file,</b> a Windows shortcut can be constructed that looks like this: ...|$|E

5000|$|Many [...]ZAP Files require user intervention. This can be {{overcome}} if the Systems Administrator creates a <b>Batch</b> <b>file</b> and runs a quiet or silent install from a <b>Batch</b> <b>File</b> command. However, running an Executable file (such as setup.exe) often bypasses quiet, passive or silent installation switches, even if specified in the SetupCommand.|$|E
50|$|This also solves {{a problem}} related to User Account Control (UAC) on Windows Vista and newer. When an {{administrator}} is logged on and UAC is enabled, and {{they try to}} run a <b>batch</b> <b>file</b> as administrator from a network drive letter, using the right-click file context menu, the operation will unexpectedly fail. This is because the elevated UAC privileged account context does not have network drive letter assignments, {{and it is not}} possible to assign drive letters for the elevated context via the Explorer shell or logon scripts. However, by creating a shortcut to the <b>batch</b> <b>file</b> using the above PUSHD / POPD construct, and using the shortcut to run the <b>batch</b> <b>file</b> as administrator, the temporary drive letter will be created and removed in the elevated account context, and the <b>batch</b> <b>file</b> will function correctly.|$|E

50|$|SYS$COMMAND - Does {{not have}} a direct {{analogue}} in the Unix model. Used interactively, it will read from the terminal. Used in a <b>batch</b> <b>file</b> when run interactively, it will read from the terminal. Used in a <b>batch</b> <b>file</b> run noninteractively, it will read from the SYS$INPUT stream (if one is defined), otherwise it will read nothing and return end of file.|$|E

50|$|<b>Batch</b> <b>files</b> use an OEM {{character}} set, {{as defined}} by the computer, e.g. Code page 437. The non-ASCII parts of these are incompatible with the Unicode or Windows character sets otherwise used in Windows so care needs to be taken. Non-English file names work only if entered through a DOS character set compatible editor. File names with characters outside this set won't work in <b>batch</b> <b>files.</b>|$|R
