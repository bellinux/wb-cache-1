5|$|At {{the same}} time as these keeps were being built by the {{extremely}} wealthy, much smaller, keep-like structures called tower houses or peel towers were built across Ireland, Scotland, and northern England, often by relatively poorer local lords and landowners. It was originally argued that Irish tower houses were based on the Scottish design, but the pattern of development of such castles in Ireland does not support this hypothesis. A tower house would typically be a tall, square, stone-built, crenelated building; Scottish and Ulster tower houses were often also surrounded by a barmkyn or bawn wall. Most academics have concluded that tower houses should not be classified as keeps <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> form of fortified house.|$|E
5|$|Columbus is a {{historic}} statue in Providence, Rhode Island, United States on Elmwood Avenue in Columbus Square. Columbus is a bronze cast of a sterling silver statue which was created by Rhode Island's Gorham Manufacturing Company for the 1892 Columbian Exposition in Chicago. The original silver statue was not meant for permanent exhibition, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> demonstration of {{the skills of the}} Gorham Company, and was later melted down. The bronze cast was dedicated November 8, 1893 as a gift from the Elmwood Association to the City of Providence. It stands upon a granite base {{at the center of a}} grassy triangle at the intersection of Reservoir Avenue and Elmwood Avenue. The statue features Christopher Columbus, was created in 1893 by Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.|$|E
50|$|The 1931 UCI Road World Championships {{took place}} in Copenhagen, Denmark. Unusually, the race was not run <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{traditional}} road race, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> individual time-trial.|$|R
5000|$|Goodeve Erskine had {{different}} ideas, however. He portrayed the Crown's {{takeover of the}} territorial Earldom not <b>as</b> pursuant to <b>a</b> charter, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> act of tyranny. He argued: ...|$|R
5000|$|... 30 mm {{ammunition}} {{is typically}} not used against personnel, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> anti-materiel or armor-piercing round. Rounds {{of this size}} can be effective against armored vehicles as well as fortified bunkers.|$|R
5|$|In Jainism, God has no {{role to play}} in an individual's destiny; one's {{personal}} destiny is {{not seen}} as a consequence of any system of reward or punishment, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of its own personal karma. A text from a volume of the ancient Jain canon, Bhagvati sūtra 8.9.9, links specific states of existence to specific karmas. Violent deeds, killing of creatures having five sense organs, eating fish, and so on, lead to rebirth in hell. Deception, fraud and falsehood leads to rebirth in the animal and vegetable world. Kindness, compassion and humble character result in human birth; while austerities and the making and keeping of vows leads to rebirth in heaven.|$|E
5|$|The inaugural Winter Olympics {{were held}} in Chamonix, France, from 25 January to 4 February 1924. A total of 258 athletes from 16 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) competed in 16 events across 9 disciplines. Women also took part in these Games, {{although}} the only events {{they were allowed to}} compete in were the figure skating ladies' singles and pairs. When the Games were held, they were not recognized as the Winter Olympics <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> winter sports week festival. It was not until 1926 that the International Olympic Committee (IOC) officially recognized them as the first Winter Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Then {{there is}} the {{deliberate}} citation of false information which is then ascribed legitimate authors. For instance, at a minimum, five of the History's sixteen citations of Dexippus {{are considered to be}} fake, and Dexippus appears to be mentioned, not as a principal source of information, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> contradictory author to be contrasted against information sourced from Herodian or the Enmannsche Kaisergeschichte. In addition Quintus Gargilius Martialis, who produced works on horticulture and medicine, is cited twice as a biographer, which is considered to be another false attribution.|$|E
5000|$|Knoll {{stated that}} she was not a {{furniture}} designer, perhaps because she didn’t want her furniture pieces to be viewed on their own <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> element of her holistic interior design.|$|R

5|$|Although {{the story}} of Duke Karl Alexander and Joseph Süß Oppenheimer {{constituted}} a relatively obscure episode in German history, it {{became the subject of}} a number of literary and dramatic treatments over the course of more than a century; the earliest of these having been Wilhelm Hauff's 1827 novella. The most successful literary adaptation was Lion Feuchtwanger's novel titled Jud Süß (1925) based on a play that he had written in 1916 but subsequently withdrew. As a Jew, Feuchtwanger did not intend his portrayal of Süß to be antisemitic <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> study of the tragedy caused by the human weaknesses of greed, pride, and ambition. With an interest in exploring the challenges confronting Jews in the Diaspora, Feuchtwanger was particularly concerned with the issues of conversion and antisemitism. He was particularly {{struck by the fact that}} Süß could have saved himself by converting to Christianity but had steadfastly refused to do so, opting instead to return to formal Jewish observance and piety.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the middle}} of the 13th century, the area of Vidin had been {{autonomous}} under ineffective Bulgarian overlordship, and was ruled successively by Yakov Svetoslav (died 1276), Shishman (died between 1308 and 1313), and then Michael Shishman. Shishman and his son received the high courtly title of despotēs from their cousin Theodore Svetoslav and the latter was referred to in a contemporary Venetian source as a Despot of Bulgaria and Lord of Vidin. With the death of the Serbian king Stefan Milutin, Michael Shishman was able to follow a more active policy in the Bulgarian capital Tarnovo. He soon became a leading noble {{in the internal affairs of}} the country and, on the childless death of young George Terter II in 1323, Michael Shishman was elected emperor of Bulgaria by the nobility. According to some historians he was chosen because he was a descendant of the Asen dynasty and interpret his ascenсion to the throne not as the beginning of a new dynasty <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> continuation of the House of Asen. His half-brother, Belaur, succeeded him as despot of Vidin.|$|E
5|$|Some common {{structures}} {{are shown in}} figures 3 and 4, along with their lumped-element counterparts. These lumped-element approximations {{are not to be}} taken as equivalent circuits <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> guide to the behaviour of the distributed elements over a certain frequency range. Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show a short-circuit and open-circuit stub, respectively. When the stub length is λ/4, these behave, respectively, as anti-resonators and resonators and are therefore useful, respectively, as elements in band-pass and band-stop filters. Figure 3(c) shows a short-circuited line coupled to the main line. This also behaves as a resonator, but is commonly used in low-pass filter applications with the resonant frequency well outside the band of interest. Figures 3(d) and 3(e) show coupled line structures which are both useful in band-pass filters. The structures of figures 3(c) and 3(e) have equivalent circuits involving stubs placed in series with the line. Such a topology is straightforward to implement in open-wire circuits but not with a planar technology. These two {{structures are}} therefore useful for implementing an equivalent series element.|$|E
5|$|In 1500, Manutius {{released}} the first books printed using italic type, again designed by Griffo. This was originally not intended <b>as</b> <b>a</b> complementary design, <b>as</b> is used today, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> alternative, more informal typeface suitable for small volumes.|$|R

5|$|The {{number of}} {{supporting}} characters was kept low to emphasize their individuality, and their personalities were left ambiguous {{to reinforce the}} desire for player immersion. The heroine Yuko Takao {{was intended to be}} a different type of character to previous main heroines, being a non-playable character from the beginning of story development. She was the only major non-playable character not to have her own Reason. The character of Lucifer designed was not a standard villain, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> gentlemanly observer who sets tests for the player. To reflect his omnipotent status as God's opposite, he is portrayed in a number of forms, including a child and an old man. Alongside this, the staff wanted to portray demons not only as enemies but as characters the player could relate to and grow attached to when inviting them to their party. One of the key elements for demon designs recycled from earlier games was bringing them into the game and making them as true as possible to the original design while fitting into the game's art style.|$|E
5|$|When {{animals are}} faced with a choice to either wait for a reward, or receive a reward right away, the {{discounting}} of the reward is hyperbolic. As the length of time of waiting for a reward increases, the reward is discounted at a gradual rate. Empirical data have suggested that exponential discounting, rewards discounting at a constant rate per unit of waiting time, only occurs when there are random interruptions in foraging. Discounting can also be related to the risk sensitivity of animals. Rather than relating risk to delay, risk sensitivity acts as a function of delay discounting. In a study conducted by Haden and Platt, macaque monkeys were given the choice of a medium reward that they knew they would receive, versus a more risky choice. The riskier choice would reward the monkey with a large reward fifty percent of the time, and a small reward the other fifty percent. The ultimate payoff was the same, but the monkeys preferred the riskier choice. They speculated that the monkeys did not see their action as risky, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> large, delayed reward. They reasoned that the monkeys viewed the large reward as certain: if they did not get the large reward the first time around, they would eventually get it, but at a longer delay.|$|E
25|$|Excavations have {{indicated}} that Mound 72 was not constructed as a single mound, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> series of smaller mounds. These mounds were reshaped and covered over to give Mound 72 its final ridge-top shape.|$|E
40|$|Relevance {{has become}} a major area of {{research}} in the field of Information Retrieval, {{despite the fact that the}} concept relevance is not well understood. This paper models manifestations of relevance within a system of relevance attributes to show that the attributes function in different dimensions for the different manifestations of relevance. It is shown that motivational relevance, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> manifestation of relevance, should not be viewed <b>as</b> part of <b>a</b> linear, objective-subjective scale of relevances, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> attribute of relevance. Similarly, that the manifestation of affective relevance should not be viewed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> discrete category of relevance manifestation, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> influencing factor on the other subjective relevance types. The paper argues a consolidated model of relevance manifestations which includes the notion of socio-cognitive relevance...|$|R

We seek to problematize definite and simplified notions of answers and propose answers be seen not <b>as</b> <b>a</b> final step in research <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> opening, an assemblage, a jar, or a call to transition into new forms of questions, outlooks, and modes of thought...|$|R
