5|$|Because {{there would}} be only one chance {{to carry out the}} test correctly, Bainbridge decided that a {{rehearsal}} should be carried out to allow the plans and procedures to be verified, and the instrumentation to be tested and calibrated. Oppenheimer was initially skeptical, <b>but</b> <b>gave</b> permission, and later agreed that it contributed {{to the success of the}} Trinity test.|$|E
5|$|Born on June 20, 1974, Sharon Collins {{grew up in}} Madison, Wisconsin. Having been {{abandoned}} by her father, she lived with her mother, Doris Collins (Karen Hensel), who was {{confined to a wheelchair}} after chasing a rebellious Sharon years earlier. Sharon became pregnant by high-school boyfriend Frank Barritt (Phil Dozois), <b>but</b> <b>gave</b> the child up for adoption.|$|E
5|$|The Nice briefly {{considered}} {{looking for}} a replacement, with Steve Howe trying out at an audition. Howe got on well {{with the rest of}} the band, but a week later had second thoughts and decided not to join.

5|$|After disbanding, {{all four}} members of Bauhaus {{undertook}} various solo projects before Ash, David J and Kevin Haskins reformed as Love and Rockets in 1985. Bauhaus reformed for the Resurrection Tour in 1998 and for a one-off concert in April 2005. Another reunion tour followed {{towards the end of}} 2005, before work started on a new album Go Away White, released in March 2008. The album charted poorly, only reaching No. 120 on the UK Albums Chart, <b>but</b> <b>gave</b> the band their first entry for a studio album on the U.S. Billboard 200 when it reached No. 105. Following the release of the album, Bauhaus disbanded again.|$|E
5|$|After nearly 40 {{years of}} service, Eichelberger retired with {{the rank of}} {{lieutenant}} general on 31 December 1948. In 1950, he moved to Asheville, North Carolina, where {{he lived with his}} wife Em {{for the rest of his}} life. He suffered from a number of health problems, including hypertension and diabetes, and had his gall bladder removed. His name appeared in a series of articles for the Saturday Evening Post on his campaigns in the Southwest Pacific, actually written by ghostwriter Milton MacKaye. They subsequently expanded the articles into a book, Our Jungle Road to Tokyo. The book sold reasonably well, and Harry Truman and Omar Bradley requested autographed copies. In 1951 he traveled to Hollywood, where he served as technical consultant on Francis Goes to West Point (1952) and The Day the Band Played (1952), but he was not altogether happy with the results. He turned his hand to writing articles about the Far East for Newsweek, <b>but</b> <b>gave</b> this away in 1954. He then worked on the lecture circuit, giving speeches about his experiences, <b>but</b> <b>gave</b> this up too in 1955. He campaigned for Richard Nixon in 1960.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} November, Chopin {{returned}} to Paris. He passed the winter in unremitting illness, <b>but</b> <b>gave</b> occasional lessons and was visited by friends, including Delacroix and Franchomme. Occasionally he played, or accompanied the singing of Delfina Potocka, for his friends. During the summer of 1849, his friends found him an apartment in Chaillot, out of {{the centre of the}} city, for which the rent was secretly subsidised by an admirer, Princess Obreskoff. Here in June 1849 he was visited by Jenny Lind.|$|E

5|$|Hitler's {{leadership}} style {{was to give}} contradictory orders to subordinates and to place them into positions where their duties and responsibilities overlapped with those of others. In this way, Hitler fostered distrust, competition, and infighting among his subordinates to consolidate and maximise his own power. His cabinet never met after 1938, and he discouraged his ministers from meeting independently. Hitler typically did not issue written orders, <b>but</b> <b>gave</b> them orally at meetings or in phone conversations; he also had Bormann convey orders. Bormann used his position to control {{the flow of information}} and access to Hitler, earning him enemies, including Himmler.|$|E
5|$|In 1988-1989, upon graduation, Pascu taught Romanian {{language}} and literature at a primary school in Ulmu, Călăraşi County, <b>but</b> <b>gave</b> up to pursue his singing career. Late in 1989, he was in Semenic, where he met Mircea Baniciu, former member of Romania's leading rock band Transsylvania Phoenix. He was a guest in Baniciu's home just as the anti-communist Revolution erupted in Timişoara. He rejoined Divertis in Iaşi, but their scheduled show there was broken up by the communist authorities.|$|E
5|$|Kongsfjord Telemetry Station {{constituted}} one of {{the four}} initial ESTRACK ground stations which provided radio tracking and telemetry communication with ESRO's low Earth orbit satellites. The ground station communicated with the satellites in the 136–137MHz band. This was optimal for low-orbit satellites, allowed for a small antenna dish <b>but</b> <b>gave</b> a low bit rate. The various satellites using the facility conducted measurements of solar radiation, cosmic radiation, the polar ionosphere, and ionizing and dynamic effects regarding electric currents and magnetic disturbances.|$|E

5|$|Like the original, Drakengard 2 {{combines}} on-foot hack and slash with aerial combat {{stages and}} RPG game mechanics. The previous game's producer, writer and character designer {{returned to their}} respective roles. The game {{was designed as a}} more mainstream game in light of the previous game's dark aesthetic and story. The game sold 206,000 copies by the end of 2005. Western reviews praised the story, <b>but</b> <b>gave</b> mixed opinions about the graphics and widely criticized the gameplay. A spin-off from the series, Nier, was released in 2010, while a third entry in the series, Drakengard 3, was released in December 2013 in Japan and May 2014 in North America and Europe.|$|E
5|$|Several forts in Confederate {{territory}} {{remained in}} Union hands. Davis sent {{a commission to}} Washington with an offer to pay for any federal property on Southern soil, {{as well as the}} Southern portion of the national debt, but Lincoln refused to meet with the commissioners. Brief informal discussions did take place with Secretary of State William Seward through Supreme Court Justice John A. Campbell. From Alabama, he later resigned from the federal government. Seward hinted that Fort Sumter would be evacuated, <b>but</b> <b>gave</b> no assurance.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, Catherine conceived, but the child, a girl, was {{stillborn}} on 31 January 1510. About {{four months}} later, Catherine again became pregnant. On New Year's Day 1511, the child – Henry – was born. After the grief {{of losing their}} first child, the couple were pleased to have a boy and festivities were held, including a two-day joust known as the 1511 Westminster Tournament. However, the child died seven weeks later. Catherine had two stillborn sons in 1514 and 1515, <b>but</b> <b>gave</b> birth in February 1516 to a girl, Mary. Relations between Henry and Catherine had been strained, but they eased slightly after Mary's birth.|$|E

5|$|The Austrian and French armies {{met again}} at Schliengen on 24 October. Moreau had arrayed his force in a semi-circle on the heights, {{offering}} him a tactically superior position. Charles threw his army against both flanks; the French left flank fought stubbornly, <b>but</b> <b>gave</b> way {{under the pressure}} of Condé's emigre corps; the right flank withstood a day-long battering by Latour and Nauendorf, but eventually had to withdraw. The loss of access to the crossing at Kehl forced Moreau to withdraw south to Hüningen.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} met with {{favorable}} reviews from critics. The Morning Telegraph offers general praise for the good photography and the well-told story. The Nickelodeon was equally positive and began to reflect the acting, staging and photography {{was up to the}} regular standard of the Thanhouser company. The New York Dramatic Mirror offered additional comments on the Thanhouser company's higher standards in their productions, <b>but</b> <b>gave</b> an otherwise positive review that focused on the novelty of the circus scenes.|$|E
5|$|The first Dutch {{settlements}} in the New York area appeared around 1613. The English captured the New Netherland Colony from the Dutch in 1664, renaming it the Province of New York after the King's brother, the Duke of York (later King James II). The Dutch recaptured the colony in July 1673 during the Third Anglo-Dutch War, <b>but</b> <b>gave</b> {{it back to the}} English under the Treaty of Westminster in exchange for Suriname. The Duke of York never governed the colony himself: he instead appointed governors, councils, and other officers to run the government. Richard Nicolls served as the first governor of New York.|$|E

When an opportunity presented itself, Mummius disobeyed, attacked the Spartacan forces, and was subsequently routed. Despite this initial loss, Crassus engaged Spartacus and defeated him, killing some 6,000 of the rebels.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{statutes}} of the Nobel Foundation, each laureate {{is required to}} give a public lecture on a subject related {{to the topic of}} their prize. The Nobel lecture as a rhetorical genre took decades to reach its current format. These lectures normally occur during Nobel Week (the week leading up to the award ceremony and banquet, which begins with the laureates arriving in Stockholm and normally ends with the Nobel banquet), but this is not mandatory. The laureate is only obliged to give the lecture within six months of receiving the prize. Some have happened even later. For example, US President Theodore Roosevelt received the Peace Prize in 1906 <b>but</b> <b>gave</b> his lecture in 1910, after his term in office. The lectures are organised by the same association which selected the laureates.|$|E
5|$|Aleph {{was created}} to embody the Shin Megami Tensei II world, which is {{reflected}} in his character design: he has a portable computer and a visor that he controls demons with, and carries swords, guns and armor for use in battle. His computer was designed to look compact, and the visor {{was designed to be}} wireless, to show that the game takes place in the future. Kaneko decided to not give Aleph a personality, partially because he is controlled by the player, and partially because he is portrayed as an artificial being, created by the Center's scientists. Beth and Daleth were designed to look similar to the first Shin Megami Tensei Heroine and Hero, using the colors blue and green, respectively. Lucifer was visually portrayed as an elegant gentleman, as Kaneko saw him as someone who tempts and tries the player, rather than being evil. He designed Lucifer in accordance with portrayals of him as a beautiful twelve-winged angel, <b>but</b> <b>gave</b> him six wings instead, for a total of twelve across his appearances in Shin Megami Tensei and Shin Megami Tensei II.|$|E
