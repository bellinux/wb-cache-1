40|$|Creating {{agents that}} proficiently {{interact}} with people {{is critical for}} many applications. Towards creating these agents, models are needed that effectively predict people’s decisions {{in a variety of}} problems. To date, two approaches have been suggested to generally describe people’s decision behavior. One approach creates a-priori predictions about people’s behavior, either based on theoretical rational behavior or based on psychological models, including bounded rationality. A second type of approach focuses on creating models based exclusively on observations of people’s behavior. At the forefront of these types of methods are various machine learning algorithms. This paper explores how these two approaches can be compared and combined in different types of domains. In relatively simple domains, both psychological models and <b>machine</b> learning yield <b>clear</b> prediction models with nearly identical results.
