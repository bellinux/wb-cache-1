50|$|The block {{instrument}} {{consists of a}} small cabinet; its front face displays two indicators — telegraph needles — and has a commutator handle (some early designs of {{block instrument}}s had miniature semaphore arms instead of needles). The upper indicator shows {{the state of the}} forward section, on the line leading away from the signal box. The commutator is used by the signalman to indicate the state of the section approaching his signal box, and the lower indicator repeats the commutator position. All indications are repeated on a similar instrument {{at the other end of}} the block section, in the associated signal box. The commutator has three positions and each of the two indicators has three positions: normal (or line <b>blocked),</b> <b>line</b> clear, and train on line. Either integral to the instrument or separately mounted, there is a single-stroke bell and a bell operating device, either a tapper or a plunger.|$|E
5000|$|In practice, Class 74 {{was a rare}} {{visitor to}} Weymouth (because {{failures}} on diesel were common and a stranded train, irate passengers and <b>blocked</b> <b>line</b> are highly undesirable) and was usually replaced at Bournemouth by the redoubtable Class 33 for the final leg of the journey. This was almost directly attributable to their problems when running on diesel power and totally negated their raison d'être. Quite simply; they were not trusted and as a result, they failed to deliver the expected advantages of a higher power (than Class 73) electro-diesel. Services to Southampton Ocean terminal did use them frequently over non-electrified lines, but this required {{only a few miles}} of diesel haulage rather than 60+ on the trip to Weymouth and back. Also, following the closure of Southampton Terminus Station, the section of non-electrified track served Ocean Terminal exclusively - a failure here would not inconvenience other services - the same was not true West of Bournemouth. The steep ascent from Weymouth would also have taxed their [...] diesel output to the utmost, as the 'Channel Islands Boat Train' usually loaded to 11 cars.|$|E
40|$|Given a {{rectangle}} with emitters and receivers on its perimeter, one can detect objects in it by determining {{which of the}} line segments between emitters and receivers are blocked by objects. The problem of object detection can be formulated as the problem of finding all non-empty n-wedge intersections, where a wedge is defined by a consecutive set of <b>blocked</b> <b>line</b> segments from the same emitter. We show that for a given set of wedges, one emanating from each emitter, we can determine the intersection (i. e., the convex polygon) in time linear {{in the number of}} wedges, assuming some given ordering of the wedges. We present two algorithms that efficiently determine all non-empty n-wedge intersections, assuming that objects are sufficiently large...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Pictures used by GPS {{devices are}} usually overly large {{to be stored}} as Bit Map, so they are by and large compressed. The common {{compression}} method is JPEG; however JPEG assumes that the average color of beginning of each <b>blocks</b> <b>line</b> is usually similar to the average color of end of its preceding <b>blocks</b> <b>line.</b> Many times this assumption is incorrect for GPS picture. This paper suggests a way to change this method to an improved method that is more suitable for JPEG based GPS images...|$|R

40|$|GPS devices {{typically}} {{make use}} of images that are excessively large to be stored as a Bit Map, so the images are always compressed. The widespread compression technique is JPEG; however JPEG has a disadvantage – JPEG assumes that the average color of beginning of each <b>blocks</b> <b>line</b> is commonly similar to the average color of end of its preceding <b>blocks</b> <b>line.</b> Almost always this assumption is wrong for GPS images. This paper proposes a method to adjust JPEG order of compression to an improved order that is more suitable for GPS images...|$|R
40|$|Array {{processing}} proved {{itself in}} the last decades as a powerful approach to suppress harmful radio frequency interference. However the interference mitigation in the spatial domain {{can also lead to}} the attenuation and loss of the desired GNSS signals which are not sufficiently separated by their directions of arrival from the interfering signals. In order to overcome this effect, the present paper proposes an approach to combine array processing and vector tracking in a single receiver. Formerly, the vector tracking loops have been shown to deliver superior performance in scenarios with <b>blocked</b> <b>line</b> of sight signals due to aiding of the affected signals during the outage. Since vector tracking loops are susceptible to faked GNSS signals, the proposed receiver architecture also includes a spoofing detection based on the direction of arrival estimation. The paper presents the technical concept and details about the realization of the array-based receiver which was developed at the German Aerospace Center (DLR). The techniques used to mitigate brute-force radio frequency interference and to detect spoofing signals are described. Experimental results obtained with these techniques in field are discussed...|$|E

50|$|When smoke {{testing a}} {{sanitary}} sewer system {{it is helpful}} to partially block off the section of sewer to be tested. This can be done by using a sand bag {{on the end of a}} rope.

The second <b>block</b> (<b>lines</b> 4 - 5) of FLIP defines services, which may have one or more ports. In this example, Apache and JBoss were specified. In the sequence, we define a policy group (lines 7 - 11), which specifies the behavior that will be taken about services in a given scenario. One group was created that allows access to Apache HTTPD (<b>line</b> 9) and <b>blocks</b> access to JBoss (line 10) except when the connection comes from sadf-engine.info.ufrn.br. Finally, it is necessary to make a connection between the group and the protected domain (line 13).|$|R
