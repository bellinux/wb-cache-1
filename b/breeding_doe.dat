40|$|Abstract Background Longevity is {{the amount}} of time {{breeding}} females stay active in a herd by avoiding death or culling because of illness or reproductive failure. This is a trait of economic relevance in commercial small ruminant breeding herds as it affects lifetime reproductive output. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if breed of meat goat influences <b>breeding</b> <b>doe</b> survival rates and cumulative reproductive performance under semi-intensive management. Results Boer (n[*]=[*] 132), Kiko (n[*]=[*] 92) and Spanish (n[*]=[*] 79) does were evaluated for longevity trends and cumulative kid production. The herd was managed on humid subtropical pasture. Does had the chance to complete 2 to 6 production years. Survival curves were analyzed for 2 culling methods. The actual culling practice removed does after two failures to wean a kid. An alternative culling protocol removed doe records after the first failure to wean a kid. Kid production traits analyzed across herd life were the total number of kids weaned and cumulative kid weight weaned to the 2 -, 3 -, and 5 -year stayability endpoints. Most (82 %) doe exits were illness-related under the actual culling method. Reproductive failure represented 51 % of doe exits under the alternative culling protocol. Boer does had greater survival declines (P [*] P [*] P [*] Conclusion Boer does had low stayability and cumulative kid production rates compared with Kiko and Spanish does. Poor health was the primary driver of does exiting the herd. Kiko and Spanish does did not differ for longevity and lifetime performance indicators. </p...|$|E

Many breeders prefer to postpone <b>breeding</b> until the <b>doe</b> has reached 70% of the adult weight. However, this separation is rarely possible in extensively managed, open-range herds.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in Dilla University with the objectives of to evaluate pre-weaning growth performance of boar-Arsi bale goats. Three bucks with 87. 5 % blood level of boer breed were purchased from Almata Agro Industry and 30 yearling female Arsi-Bale goats were purchased from a local market for cross breeding. Following natural controlled <b>breeding,</b> <b>Doe’s</b> were mated with Boar buck to produce 44 % boer and 50 % local blood level kids. Does were mated in single sire groups of at least 30 does for one buck. Birth weight, weaning weight, weekly weight were recorded in the morning before grazing and watering. The experiment kids consider only kidding November, 2014 to February 2015 totally 25 kids were born and one only died until weaning. Out of all born F 1 kids 17, 7 kids were males and females respectively. From thirty pregnant Doe’s 6. 67 % of them having dystocia. From the total 96 % of kids survive up to weaning. Kid mortality rate was 4. 2 %. The birth weight of boer-arsi bale cross kids were 3. 02 for male kids and 2. 41 for female kids. The overall mean of weaning weight of boar arsi bale kids were varies by sex which is 22. 48 ± 3. 47 for male kids and 18. 60 ± 2. 20 for female kids and Pre-weaning weight obtained (175. 83 ± 6). From the trial it is possible to conclude that boer-arsi bale kids have better growth performances than most of the goat breeds in Ethiopia. integrated efforts combining the feed, breeding and nutritional aspects of production are very important {{to make use of the}} breed...|$|R
40|$|Summary. Fourteen {{seasonally}} anoestrous, non-lactating fallow does {{were each}} treated with an intravaginal progesterone device for 14 days {{followed by a}} subcutaneously implanted osmotic minipump delivering synthetic GnRH at doses of 125 ng/h (7 does) or 250 ng/h (7 does) for up to 7 days, about 6 weeks before the natural <b>breeding</b> season.

For example, Small Farm Today in 2005 claimed {{beneficial}} use in invalid and convalescent diets, proposing that glycerol ethers, possibly important in nutrition for nursing infants, {{are much higher}} in doe milk than in cow milk. [...] A 1970 book on animal <b>breeding</b> claimed <b>doe</b> milk differs from cow or human milk by having higher digestibility, distinct alkalinity, higher buffering capacity, and certain therapeutic values in human medicine and nutrition. [...] George Mateljan suggested doe milk can replace ewe milk or cow milk in diets {{of those who are}} allergic to certain mammals' milk. However, like cow milk, doe milk has lactose (sugar), and may cause gastrointestinal problems for individuals with lactose intolerance. [...] In fact, the level of lactose {{is similar to that of}} bovine milk.|$|R
