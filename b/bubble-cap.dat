50|$|The trays or plates used in {{industrial}} distillation columns are fabricated of circular steel plates and usually installed inside the column at intervals of about 60 to 75 cm (24 to 30 inches) up {{the height of}} the column. That spacing is chosen primarily for ease of installation and ease of access for future repair or maintenance. An example of a very simple tray is a perforated tray. The desired contacting between vapor and liquid occurs as the vapor, flowing upwards through the perforations, comes into contact with the liquid flowing downwards through the perforations. In current modern practice, as shown in the adjacent diagram, better contacting is achieved by installing <b>bubble-caps</b> or valve caps at each perforation to promote the formation of vapor bubbles flowing through a thin layer of liquid maintained by a weir on each tray.|$|R
50|$|So-called <b>bubble-cap</b> or valve-cap trays are {{examples}} of the vapor and liquid contact devices used in industrial distillation columns. Another example of vapor and liquid contact devices are the spikes in laboratory Vigreux fractionating columns.|$|E
5000|$|Van Winkle's Correlation is an {{empirical}} formula that predicts the Murphree plate efficiency for distillation columns separating binary systems. Both system variables and plate parameters are included, and the correlation can be applies to <b>bubble-cap</b> and sieve plates. The equation is: ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Bubble-cap</b> [...] "trays" [...] or [...] "plates" [...] {{are one of}} {{the types}} of {{physical}} devices, which are used to provide good contact between the upflowing vapor and the downflowing liquid inside an industrial fractionating column. Such trays are shown in Figures 4 and 5.|$|E
40|$|The two {{distillation}} columns of Wacker Institute pilot plant at the Chattanooga State Community College are investigated for stable operating regions, flooding phenomena {{that occurs in}} the <b>bubble-cap</b> tray distillation column, weeping phenomena that occurs in the sieve tray distillation column, and comparison of operation between the two {{distillation columns}}. With {{the use of a}} distributed control system (DCS) and glass equipment in the pilot plant, these phenomena are analyzed visually {{and with the help of}} instrumentation readings. The energy usage and production limits of both distillation columns are discussed. The flooding of <b>bubble-cap</b> trays occur before reaching production goals due to a flaw inside the column. The weeping of sieve trays does not allow the distillation column to operate efficiently at low flow rates. The <b>bubble-cap</b> tray distillation column uses less energy to achieve the same production goals as the sieve tray distillation column...|$|E
40|$|The {{determination}} of plate efficiency of rectification {{column for the}} separation of Bonny Light Crude Oil into its fractions was studied. The atmospheric distillation column of a typical Refinery (PHRC) was used in determining the efficiencies of the <b>bubble-cap</b> plate of the column. It was observed that {{the efficiency of the}} plates below the feed plate varies, but above the feed plate, it increases up the top of the column and was highest at top plate. The total number of ideal and actual plates was found to be 7. The Murphree equation for plate efficiency was used to determine the overall efficiency of the column with the aid of the McCabe-Thiele diagram to be 93. 9 %. This work has shown the efficiency, reliability and integrity of the plant...|$|E
40|$|A twenty-tray single <b>bubble-cap</b> {{column was}} used to air strip ammonia and {{methanol}} from a synthetic, {{as well as a}} plant wastewater stream. When feeding synthetic solutions containing 700 mg/kg ammonia, stripping efficiencies of more than 98 % were achieved at gas to liquid mass ratios (G/L) ratios of 2. 5 - 2. 7. This produced stripper bottom solutions contains 10 mg/kg ammonia. Reducing the air flow by 25 % increased the ammonia content in the stripper bottoms to 30 mg/kg. Using the graphical McCabe-Theile method, the overall column efficiency for the bubble cap column during ammonia stripping was between 9 and 26 % because of the low contact efficiency of this column. When treating the as received plant wastewater, the ammonia removal efficiency was only 84 % at thelower G/L ratio. This increased to 99 % by raising the pH from 9. 8 to 11. 5 and increasing the G/L mass ratio. The ammonia volumetric mass transfer coefficient (KLa) for these tests was calculated to be between 0. 38 and 0. 58 h- 1. Both stripping and absorption of methanol occurred in the column during stripping of ammonia. Based upon solution analyses, the methanol removal efficiency varied between 55 and 95 %...|$|E
40|$|The {{distributor}} plate {{effects on the}} hydrodynamic characteristics of turbulent fluidized beds are investigated by obtaining measurements of pressure and radial voidage profiles in a column diameter of 0. 29 m with Group A particles using bubble <b>bubble-cap</b> or perforated plate distributors. Distributor pressure drop measurements between the two distributors are compared with the theoretical estimations while {{the influence of the}} mass inventory is studied. Comparison is established for the transition velocity from bubbling to turbulent regime, Uc, deduced from the pressure fluctuations in the bed using gauge pressure measurements. The effect of the distributor on the flow structure near the bottom region of the bed is studied using differential and gauge pressure transducers located at different axial positions along the bed. The radial voidage profile in the bed is also measured using optical fiber probes, which provide local measurements of the voidage at different heights above the distributor. The {{distributor plate}} has a significant effect on the bed hydrodynamics. Owing to the jetting caused by the perforated plate distributor, earlier onset of the transition to the turbulent fluidization flow regime was observed. Moreover, increased carry over for the perforated plate compared with the bubble caps has been confirmed. The results have highlighted the influence of the distributor plate on the fluidized bed hydrodynamics which has consequences in terms of comparing experimental and simulation results between different distributor platesPublicad...|$|E
