25|$|Academic Abdullahi El-Tom, in his {{critique}} of the book, states that the latter half {{is not nearly as}} well-argued as the heavily statistical beginning, making points that are then not substantiated and sometimes falling into polemical statements. For example, the Black Book states that the equipment that was to be used for the Western Highway Project was diverted to the Northern Highway Project, which is both widely rumored and believed, but no evidence is provided to <b>back</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> El-Tom further makes the following observations: it has an implicit view of Sudan as Islamic; it emphasizes the grievances of Western Sudan (i.e. Darfur and Kordofan) over the other marginalized regions; and it has an unforgiving stance towards all the north, rather than just the three clans identified as controlling the government (i.e. the Shaigiya, the Jaaliyeen and the Danagla).|$|E
25|$|Despite {{losing in}} the first round of the Ordina Open to Carlos Berlocq 6–2, 3–6, 2–6, he was able to reach the quarterfinals of Wimbledon for the first time, {{defeating}} then world no. 9 James Blake 3–6, 6–3, 6–3, 7–6(7–4) in the third round, earning his first top 10 win of the year. He lost to world no. 1 Federer 6–7(2–7), 6–3, 1–6, 3–6, this marks Ferrero reaching the quarterfinals or better of each slam. He <b>back</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> with another quarterfinal at the Mercedes Cup losing to Feliciano López 4–6, 6–3, 4–6, but was upset {{in the first}} round by Andreas Seppi at the Austrian Open 6–7(3–7), 6–4, 2–6 The Spaniard's US Open campaign was a disappointment, despite making it to the third round of the Western & Southern Financial Group Masters losing to American James Blake 1–6, 4–6 after defeating world no. 6 Fernando González 6–2, 7–6(9–7), he lost {{in the first round}}s of Rogers Cup to Lleyton Hewitt 6–7(5–7), 4–6 and US Open to Feliciano López 3–6, 4–6, 4–6.

"Some joyous shagging songs, though, are paltry {{excitement}} {{beside that}} of seeing an artist of such fame, long held as iconic without enough genuinely exciting music to <b>back</b> <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> reach her full throttle of awesomeness.

[...] Tony Maglio from The Wrap also questioned her lyrical content, specifically criticizing the lyrics [...] "I <b>back</b> <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> cause I don’t give a fuck" [...] and [...] "I’m MC Hammer fly." [...] Jordan Sargent from Spin called the track [...] "far from Mike Will's best work" [...] and negatively compared Cyrus' delivery to that of Lil Debbie.|$|E
500|$|Justice Souter {{wrote for}} the five-justice majority, [...] "The {{nominally}} private character of the Association is overborne by the pervasive entwinement of public institutions and public officials in its composition and workings, {{and there is no}} substantial reason to claim unfairness in applying constitutional standards to it." [...] Part of the basis for this determination were historical statements by the Tennessee Board of Education, which had granted regulatory authority to the association and recognition of its own independent authority. For example, the Board explicitly approved the TSSAA's rules and reserved the right to continuously review them in the future. Further, employees at the association were given state pensions. Because the association could essentially [...] "coerce" [...] the member schools to follow its rules and the state would <b>back</b> <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> it was using state police power. Therefore, Souter concluded, the restrictions on denial of due process would apply to the association, and the lawsuit could proceed in the lower courts.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the female}} protagonists {{challenge}} their male [...] "suitors" [...] {{to keep up}} instead of being full of empty promises; the women further feel that [...] "He's not fulfilling you like he says". Williams further explained {{the meaning of the}} song during an interview with MTV News, [...] "We've had experiences with men doing a lot of talking but they can’t <b>back</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> You said you could do this, but you can't, whether that's on the dance floor or wherever else. He said what he could do for you, but..." [...] The lyrics are constructed in the chorus-verse pattern. The song opens with the lines [...] "Hit me" [...] and the first verses sung by Beyoncé follow: [...] "I put it right there made it easy for you to get to / Now you want to act like you don't know what to do". The chorus follows during which the group repeatedly sings the lines [...] "Can you keep up?". Rowland's second verses follow where she sings the lines [...] "Put it on me deep in the right direction". The chorus is repeated twice before the bridge by Williams. After the bridge, the group sings the lines [...] "Here's your papers, baby you are dismissed" [...] letting their man know that he is not good enough for them. Rowland sings a short ad lib, and then the trio ends with a repeated chorus. Nick Reynolds from BBC compared the song Missy Elliott's [...] "Pass That Dutch" [...] and to songs by The Supremes. He further found a name check of Public Enemy's [...] "Bring the Noise". Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine also compared [...] "Lose My Breath with [...] "Pass That Dutch".|$|E

500|$|The revamped concerts {{were also}} met with {{critical}} acclaim. Mark Savage from BBC Online reviewed {{the first of the}} revised performances in the United Kingdom. Savage described the concert as a hugely ambitious, terrifyingly loud show, [...] "spread over four acts and held together by a flimsy 'narrative' about Gaga and her dancer friends trying to get to a party." [...] He was also impressed that the entire spectacle was put together in just four weeks. MTV's James Montogomery reviewed the first North American performance of the tour in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. He said that the tour was [...] "packed with more wattage than an overheated power plant and more costume changes than a thousand Vegas reviews, it's the kind of show that leaves you with wide eyes, ringing ears, aching limbs and absolutely zero chance of making it to work in the morning." [...] New York Daily News writer Jim Farber expected that the theatricality of the show might have obscured the songs, but instead felt that Gaga's voice was perfect and the concert actually [...] "pushed Gaga a long way towards her obvious goal – to be the queen of this pop moment." [...] Glenn Gamboa from Newsday said that Gaga [...] "built her monster-sized fame on knowing how to create a spectacle and then having the substance to <b>back</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> For every coat made of Kermit the Frog dolls or headdresses that covered her face in red lace, there was a stomping disco anthem or tender piano ballad to match. That back and forth is the centerpiece of her Monster Ball Tour." [...] Dan Aquilante from the New York Post was critical of the show, calling it [...] "scripted, silly, and tired, right down to Gaga's patter." [...] He added that the 15 costumes Gaga wore during the two-hour plus gig were [...] "more successful helping her cement the notion of an erotic and exotic otherworld." [...] Writing in the Telegram & Gazette, Craig S. Semon was appreciative of the show, calling it [...] "an out-of-this-world blast and end-of-the-world blow-out that must be seen to be believed." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{first four}} of the book’s seven {{chapters}} serve as a preamble to the final three. First, Cochran and Harpending present evidence for recent, accelerated human evolution after the invention of agriculture. In itself, this argument represents a paradigm shift, albeit one that now has clear data to <b>back</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> [...] The International HapMap Project and other {{studies have shown that}} selection is ongoing and has accelerated over time. This has been a key discovery in human biology, and Cochran and Harpending, building on their own work and that of others such as John Hawks of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, tie the advent of agriculture—and the selection pressures resulting from the new diets, new modes of habitation, new animal neighbors, and new modes of living that agriculture made possible—to this accelerating evolution.|$|E
2500|$|Baggott got {{the idea}} to write Farewell to Reality and become a science activist when {{watching}} the BBC program What is Reality. In his opinion, the program started out well, but became what he calls [...] "fairy tale physics" [...] when it included interviews with theoretical physicists who talked about such ideas as multiverse, superstring theory, and supersymmetry. These topics, according to Baggott, are fascinating to read about and are an entertaining way to make documentaries, sell books, or spend time at parties, but are [...] "abstracted, theoretical speculation without any kind of empirical foundation" [...] and [...] "not science". Farewell to Reality is Baggott's attempt to counteract the [...] "fuzzy science theory" [...] and advocate for evidence and facts. Baggott states, [...] "When you start asking 'Do {{we live in a}} hologram?' Then you are crossing into metaphysics, and you are heading down the path of allowing all kinds of things that have no evidence to <b>back</b> <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> like creationism." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mark Danson of Contactmusic.com was {{not very}} fond of the song, criticizing the Neptunes' sound, and said: [...] "as it sounds like [...] Williams has done this one in his sleep, it'll {{probably}} slip under the radar unless it has a fairly decent video to <b>back</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> It’s obviously {{supposed to be a}} kind of sexy electronica, but it just ends up sounding slack." [...] Tony Naylor of NME called the song [...] "probably the oddest track" [...] on the Tasty album. Adam Webb of Yahoo! Music UK said that the song [...] "nestles in seamlessly, the rhythm as relentless as a parade of majorettes with Kelis upfront as the cheerleader." [...] Neil Drumming of Entertainment Weekly called the song a [...] "lusty party anthem". Ernest Hardy of Rolling Stone called it [...] "the superfreakiest song on the charts", Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called it [...] "thick and creamy", Steve Jones of USA Today called it [...] "saucy", and Dorian Lynskey of The Guardian said that in the song [...] "Kelis exploits her husky croon like never before, pouring it over lascivious double entendre." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although of a {{slightly}} short and medium build (1.73 m/5ft 8"), Laver developed a technically complete serve-and-volley game, with aggressive groundstrokes to <b>back</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> Dan Maskell, the Voice of Wimbledon, [...] {{described him as}} [...] "technically faultless." [...] His left-handed serve was well disguised and wide swinging. His groundstrokes on both flanks were hit with topspin, as was the attacking topspin lob, which Laver developed into a weapon. His stroke technique was based on quick shoulder turns, true swings, and accurate timing. His backhand, often hit on the run, was a point-ender that gave him an advantage. Laver was very quick and had a strong left forearm. Rex Bellamy wrote, [...] "The strength of that wrist and forearm gave him blazing power without loss of control, {{even when he was}} on the run and at full stretch. The combination of speed and strength, especially wrist strength, enabled him to hit ferocious winners when way out of court." [...] At the net, he had forcing volleys, often hit as stroke volleys. Especially on the backhand, he could hit sharp underspin angles as well. [...] He was difficult to lob, because of his springing agility, and when forced to retreat, he could come up with a vicious counterpunch.|$|E
2500|$|Chomsky {{has shown}} cynicism towards the {{credibility}} of postmodernism and poststructuralism. In particular he has criticised the Parisian intellectual community; the following disclaimer may be taken as indicative: [...] "I wouldn't say this if I hadn't been explicitly asked for my opinion – and if asked to <b>back</b> <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> I'm going to respond that I don't think it merits {{the time to do}} so" [...] (ibid). Chomsky's lack of interest arises from what he sees as a combination of difficult language and limited intellectual or [...] "real world" [...] value, especially in Parisian academe: [...] "Sometimes it gets kind of comical, say in post-modern discourse. Especially around Paris, it has become a comic strip, I mean it's all gibberish ... they try to decode it and see what is the actual meaning behind it, things that you could explain to an eight-year old child. There's nothing there." [...] (Chomsky on Anarchism, pg. 216). This is exacerbated, in his view, by the attention paid to academics by the French press: [...] "in France if you're part of the intellectual elite and you cough, there's a front-page story in Le Monde. That's {{one of the reasons why}} French intellectual culture is so farcical – it's like Hollywood" [...] (Understanding Power, pg. 96).|$|E
