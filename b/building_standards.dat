5|$|Following the {{scorched}} earth {{tactics of}} retreating Wehrmacht troops, large areas in Northern Norway {{needed to be}} rebuilt. In 1945, there was an overwhelming need for housing. An architectural competition produced several designs for simple, cost-effective, and rapidly assembled housing. The resulting houses were Spartan and broke with <b>building</b> <b>standards,</b> but met an immediate need for shelter.|$|E
5|$|In {{the realm}} of {{structural}} engineering and technical Chinese architecture, there were also government standard building codes, outlined in the early Tang book of the Yingshan Ling (National Building Law). Fragments of this book have survived in the Tang Lü (The Tang Code), while the Song dynasty architectural manual of the Yingzao Fashi (State <b>Building</b> <b>Standards)</b> by Li Jie (1065–1101) in 1103 is the oldest existing technical treatise on Chinese architecture that has survived in full. During the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang (712–756) there were 34,850 registered craftsmen serving the state, managed by the Agency of Palace Buildings (Jingzuo Jian).|$|E

The WELL <b>Building</b> <b>Standard</b> is a performance-based standard {{that is designed to}} improve human health outcomes by integrating medical research into the design and construction of buildings. However, given the relatively young age of the <b>building</b> <b>standard,</b> it does not yet address health at the community level. Focusing on the wellness concepts established in WELL Standard v 1. 0, this research project re-imagines the standard as a metric to measure the health and wellness of master-planned communities. Through an analysis of the WELL <b>Building</b> <b>Standard</b> and other health-related literature, this research project identifies design strategies, protocols, and policies {{that can be used to}} improve health outcomes at the community level...|$|R

5|$|Typhoon Pongsona {{produced}} {{strong wind}} gusts peaking at 278km/h (173mph 1-min), which left the entire island of Guam without power and destroyed about 1,300houses. With strong <b>building</b> <b>standards</b> and experience from repeated typhoon strikes, {{there were no}} fatalities directly related to Pongsona, although there was one indirect death from flying glass. Damage on the island totaled over $700million (2002 USD, $ USD), making Pongsona among the five costliest typhoons on the island. The typhoon also caused heavy damage on Rota {{and elsewhere in the}} Northern Mariana Islands, {{and as a result of}} its impact the name was retired.|$|E
5|$|Across Guam, damage totaled over $700million (2002USD, $ USD), {{placing it}} among the five costliest typhoons on the island. The typhoon injured 193people, as {{reported}} by the Guam Department of Health; most were lacerations and fractures caused by flying glass and other debris. There was one indirect death attributed to the storm, when a 71-year-old woman was cut by flying glass and subsequently suffered a fatal heart attack; medical help could not reach her due to the intensity of the storm. As six typhoons had passed directly over the island during the previous ten years, officials in Guam enacted strong <b>building</b> <b>standards,</b> keeping deaths and injuries to a minimum. The typhoon was considered by the public the worst typhoon to ever strike the island due to the large eye affecting most of the population.|$|E
5|$|The Crown {{kept the}} {{freehold}} {{of the land}} south of the street except for No.79, which was granted to Nell Gwyn's trustees in 1676 or 1677 by Charles II. The buildings constructed {{on the south side}} of Pall Mall in subsequent years were grander than those on the north owing to stricter design and <b>building</b> <b>standards</b> imposed by the crown commissioners. When the main road was relocated further north, some houses suddenly had their backs facing the main road, losing available land for gardening. In 1664, residents filed a petition to turn the old road into gardens, which was successful. The trustees of the Earl of St Albans received a sixty-year lease on most of this from April 1665 so that trustees could issue sub-leases to their tenants.|$|E

5|$|Jali are pierced stone screens with {{regularly}} repeating patterns. They {{are characteristic}} of Indo-Islamic architecture, for example in the Mughal dynasty buildings at Fatehpur Sikri and the Taj Mahal. The geometric designs combine polygons such as octagons and pentagons with other shapes such as 5- and 8-pointed stars. The patterns emphasized symmetries and suggested infinity by repetition. Jali functioned as windows or room dividers, providing privacy but allowing in air and light. Jali forms a prominent element of the architecture of India. The use of perforated walls has declined with modern <b>building</b> <b>standards</b> {{and the need for}} security. Modern, simplified jali walls, for example made with pre-moulded clay or cement blocks, have been popularised by the architect Laurie Baker. Pierced windows in girih style are sometimes found elsewhere in the Islamic world, such as in windows of the Mosque of Ibn Tulun in Cairo.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the damaged}} houses were of poor construction, {{and in the}} wake of Althea, {{engineering}} studies of the destruction resulted in a new understanding of the structural design loads necessary to withstand severe winds. In particular, inadequate roof cladding and fastening systems were among the primary points of failure. Consequently, much stricter building codes were explored in Queensland and Australia as a whole. Three years later, Cyclone Tracy's devastation in Darwin, Northern Territory, bolstered the trend of more rigorous construction specifications in the country. Many of the buildings destroyed by Tracy were government housing units constructed according to new guidelines based on findings after Althea, showing the need for further study. The severe cyclones prompted Queensland to develop its first statewide building regulations in 1975; the new Queensland Home Building Code was fully adopted in the mid-1980s. Under the new regulations, roofs had to be more securely anchored than before using bolts and reinforced fastenings. Having seen the dangers of deficient construction first-hand, Townsville was the first community to enact the enhanced <b>building</b> <b>standards,</b> and served as a testing ground for further revisions. The Cyclone Testing Station, a wind damage research organisation housed within James Cook University's Townsville campus, was established in 1977 in response to cyclones Althea and Tracy.|$|E
5|$|Everyone in {{the office}} {{complains}} about Dwight Schrute's (Rainn Wilson) <b>building</b> <b>standards,</b> such as un-plying toilet paper, adding motion sensors to the lights, and placing a roach billboard over the windows to the office. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer), as office administrator, threatens to move everyone to a different building if nothing is done. She leaves and comes back with pictures of a newer office space and says they can move in three months. Dwight investigates and finds that the office building does not exist. When Dwight plays coy around Pam, she admits to Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) that she lied about the office building and that she is afraid of failing again after failing {{as an artist and}} a salesperson. Jim tries in vain to reassure her, and she breaks down in tears. Later Nate (Mark Proksch), Dwight's building assistant, discreetly gives Pam a book on the state building regulations. Pam shows Dwight that his policies are in violation of the laws written in the book, so Dwight puts everything back to normal. The camera crew confronts Dwight with footage showing that he overheard Pam's conversation with Jim and instructed Nate to give her the book on the building regulations. Dwight admits that he allowed her to win, but mocks the idea that he did so out of compassion.|$|E
