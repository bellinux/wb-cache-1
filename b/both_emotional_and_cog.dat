40|$|This study {{examined}} the neural areas involved in the recognition of <b>both</b> <b>emotional</b> prosody <b>and</b> phonemic components of words expressed in spoken language using echo-planar, {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI). Ten right-handed males were asked to discriminate words based on tither expressed emotional tone (angry, happy, sad, or neutral) or phonemic characteristics, specifically, initial consonant sound (bower, dower, power, or tower). Significant bilateral activity was observed in the detection of <b>both</b> <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> verbal aspects of language when compared to baseline activity. We found that the detection of emotion compared with verbal detection resulted in significant activity in the right inferior frontal lobe. Conversely, the detection of verbal stimuli compared with the detection of emotion activated left inferior frontal lobe regions most significantly. Specific analysis of the anterior auditory cortex revealed increased right hemisphere activity during the detection of emotion compared to activity during verbal detection. These findings illustrate bilateral involvement in the detection of emotion in language while concomitantly showing significantly lateralized activity in <b>both</b> <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> verbal detection, in both the temporal and frontal lobes.

40|$|Empathy is {{a multidimensional}} {{phenomenon}} {{that consists of}} <b>both</b> <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> cognitive components. This paper gives an overview of behavioural and neuroscientific sex differences in empathy, as well as potential explanations to those results. Research indicates existence of sex differences in <b>both</b> <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> cognitive empathy, although inconsistent findings suggest both female superiority as well as male superiority. Gender roles, social desirability, as well deficiencies in measurement and imprecise conceptualizations of empathy is argued as contributors to found sex differences. With a restricted amount of research on sex differences in empathy, inconsistent findings {{as well as a}} great proportion of critique towards both the research field of empathy as well as towards focus on sex differences; the authors argue that presented sex differences in empathy must be interpreted with a great caution.
