50|$|Some {{embedded}} system designs may also include an intermediary <b>boot</b> <b>sequence</b> step {{in form of}} additional code that gets loaded into system RAM by the integrated boot ROM.

50|$|Many Linux {{distributions}} use readahead {{on a list}} of {{commonly used}} files to speed up booting.

5000|$|The Poqet PC {{is a very}} small, {{portable}} IBM PC compatible computer, {{introduced in}} 1989 by Poqet Computer Corporation with a price of $2000. The computer was discontinued after Fujitsu Ltd. bought Poqet Computer Corp. It was the first subnotebook form factor IBM PC compatible computer that ran MS-DOS. The Poqet PC is powered by two AA-size batteries. Through the use of aggressive power management, which includes stopping the CPU between keystrokes, the batteries are able to power the computer for anywhere between {{a couple of weeks}} and a couple of months, depending on usage. The computer also uses an [...] "instant on" [...] feature, such that after powering it down, it can be used again immediately without having to go through a full <b>booting</b> <b>sequence.</b> The Poqet PC is comparable to the HP 95LX/HP 100LX/HP 200LX and the Atari Portfolio handheld computers.|$|R
40|$|When {{it comes}} to the domain of {{embedded}} technologies, the ARM processor architecture is very popular. According to Wikipedia[8] around 90 % of all 32 bit embedded CPU’s are based on the ARM processor architecture as of 2009. Its usage is growing in cell phones, PDA’s, GPS devices, and netbooks. The fact that the ARM architecture has entered the netbook marked has made it a very interesting architecture for operating system development. Systems based on the ARM processor architecture, can become very complex machines since these are meant to support varied tasks such as memory management and process management. This means that an operating system has to be ported to these ARM processor architectures. An operating system redesigned to extract the maximum performance out of the hardware and still be stable and secure. Often such operating system porting is the work of specialized third party vendors having expertise on this domain. This Thesis describes the details of porting the FenixOS the research operating system to the ARM Cortex A 8 processor architecture. It describes; the Kernel <b>boot</b> <b>sequences</b> utilizing an embedded bootloader, the utilization of a software ARM emulator, early kernel initialization where virtual memory is setup, IRQ/FIQ setup and finally contexts switches are also described. i...|$|R

50|$|In {{most modern}} BIOSes, the boot {{priority}} order of all potentially bootable devices can be freely configured {{by the user}} through the BIOS configuration utility. In older BIOSes, limited boot priority options are selectable; in the earliest BIOSes, a fixed priority scheme was implemented, with floppy disk drives first, fixed disks (i.e. hard disks) second, and typically no other boot devices supported, subject to modification of these rules by installed option ROMs. The BIOS in an early PC also usually would only boot from the first floppy disk drive or the first hard disk drive, {{even if there were}} two drives of either type installed. All more advanced <b>boot</b> priority <b>sequences</b> evolved as incremental improvements on this basic system.|$|R

5000|$|The BIOS selects {{candidate}} boot devices {{using information}} collected by POST and configuration information from EEPROM, CMOS RAM or, {{in the earliest}} PCs, DIP switches. Following the <b>boot</b> priority <b>sequence</b> in effect, BIOS checks each device {{in order to see}} if it is bootable. For a disk drive or a device that logically emulates a disk drive, such as a USB flash drive or perhaps a tape drive, to perform this check the BIOS attempts to load the first sector (boot sector) from the disk into RAM at memory address [...] If the sector cannot be read (due to a missing or unformatted disk, or due to a hardware failure), the BIOS considers the device unbootable and proceeds to check the next device. If the sector is read successfully, some BIOSes will also check for the boot sector signature 0x55 0xAA in the last two bytes of the sector (which is 512 bytes long), before accepting a boot sector and considering the device bootable.|$|R

50|$|The {{machine was}} {{physically}} compact for its day, designed around chassis/gate configurations shared with other IBM machines {{such as the}} 3705 communications controller, and a typical configuration would take up one or two racks about 5 ft high, the smallest System/7's were only about 3 ft high. The usual console device was a Teletype Model 33 ASR (designated as the IBM 5028), which was also how the machine would generally read its <b>boot</b> loader <b>sequence.</b> Since the semiconductor memory emptied when it lost power (in those days, losing memory when you switched off the power {{was regarded as a}} novelty) and ROM was unknown (after all, it was not needed with magnetic core memory) the machine had minimal capabilities at startup. It typically would read a tiny bootloader from the Teletype, and then that program would in turn read in the full program from another computer or from a high speed paper tape reader, or from an RPQ interface to a tape cassette player. Although many of the external devices used on the system used the ASCII character set, the internal operation of the system used the EBCDIC character set which IBM used on most systems.|$|R
5000|$|In 1967 Dee {{began his}} early evening chat show Dee Time on BBC TV. The show became very popular, {{with up to}} 18 million viewers. It opened with sports {{presenter}} Len Martin announcing [...] "It's Siiiiimon Dee!", imitating The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, and closed with a famous film sequence of Dee driving off in an E-type Jaguar with blonde model Lorna McDonald. McDonald appeared anonymously at the time, dressed in a mini-skirt and “kinky”-style <b>boots.</b> The opening <b>sequence</b> {{has been described as}} both [...] "iconic" [...] of the times [...] and a [...] "visual cliché" [...] that lent itself to parody (for example, by comedian Benny Hill).

Only two complete editions of Dee Time survive in the BBC archives; the programme was transmitted live and the BBC recorded contemporary live programmes only for any possible legal ramifications, wiping them after six weeks. He became very successful and adopted an extravagant lifestyle. Also in 1967, he was the host of the Miss World contest transmitted live on BBC1 from the Lyceum Ballroom, London. He also had cameo roles in films, including The Italian Job (1969) and Doctor in Trouble (1970).|$|R
50|$|The {{bootloader}} will {{load the}} kernel and initial root file system image into memory {{and then start}} the kernel, passing in the memory address of the image. At {{the end of its}} <b>boot</b> <b>sequence,</b> the kernel tries to determine the format of the image from its first few blocks of data, which can lead either to the initrd or initramfs scheme.|$|E
5000|$|As {{part of the}} {{starting}} sequence the POST routines may display a prompt to the user for a key press to access built-in setup functions of the BIOS. This allows the user to set various options particular to the mother board before the operating system is loaded. If no key is pressed, the POST will proceed on to the <b>boot</b> <b>sequence</b> required to load the installed operating system.|$|E
50|$|This {{application}} directory is executed (run) {{when the}} machine boots (if so configured), therefore causing its !Run file {{to be executed}} (i.e. $.!Boot.!Run in Acorn pathname syntax). This file then causes various files to be executed, OS modules loaded, standard icons to be loaded and filetypes defined, and defines a number of standard variables through which its various subdirectories are accessed. Thus RISC OS's entire <b>boot</b> <b>sequence</b> can be avoided merely by holding Shift.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{some other}} {{hardware}} components, the video card usually {{needs to be}} active very early during the boot process so that the user can see what is going on. This requires the card to be activated before any operating system begins loading; thus {{it needs to be}} activated by the BIOS, the only software that is present at this early stage. System BIOS loads video BIOS from card's ROM into system RAM and transfers control to it early in <b>boot</b> <b>sequence.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A primary {{partition}} contains one file system. In DOS and all early versions of Microsoft Windows systems, Microsoft required {{what it called}} the system partition {{to be the first}} partition. All Windows operating systems from Windows 95 onwards can be located on (almost) any partition, but the boot files ( [...] , , , etc.) must reside on a {{primary partition}}. However, other factors, such as a PC's BIOS (see <b>Boot</b> <b>sequence</b> on standard PC) may also impose specific requirements as to which partition must contain the primary OS.|$|E
50|$|The BBL on each machine {{monitors}} {{the state of}} all servers and can automatically restart failed servers. It can also detect hung servers and kill/restart them as required. The BRIDGE process in a clustered environment monitors to BBL, {{so there are no}} single points of failure. Any transactions that are affected by a server or machine failure and that have not completed the prepare phase are rolled back. Transactions that have completed the prepare phase but not the commit phase will be committed as part of the Tuxedo <b>boot</b> <b>sequence.</b>|$|E
50|$|On modern {{general purpose}} computers, the boot up process can take tens of seconds, or even minutes, and {{typically}} involves performing a power-on self-test, locating and initializing peripheral devices, and then finding, loading and starting an operating system. The process of hibernating or sleeping {{does not involve}} booting. Minimally, some embedded systems do not require a noticeable <b>boot</b> <b>sequence</b> to begin functioning and when turned on may simply run operational programs that are stored in ROM. All computing systems are state machines, and a reboot {{may be the only}} method to return to a designated zero-state from an unintended, locked state.|$|E
50|$|The first Display Adapter was {{installed}} on the model 5570-S, {{also known as the}} first Micro Channel machine in PS/55, had a compatibility problem with PS/2. From the model 5550-S released in 1988, the Display Adapter II {{was installed}} that had been resolved PS/2 compatibility. In the <b>boot</b> <b>sequence,</b> display adapter enabled VGA on the motherboard and the video signal was output through MCA connector and display adapter. When using Japanese DOS, VGA was disabled and display adapter switched the video signal from VGA to own graphics chip. In addition, 256 color mode (1024x768 pixels in 256 of 262,144 colors) was supported.|$|E
50|$|At this point, the {{extension}} ROM code takes over, typically testing and initializing the hardware it controls and registering interrupt vectors {{for use by}} post-boot applications. It may use BIOS services (including those provided by previously initialized option ROMs) to provide a user configuration interface, to display diagnostic information, or {{to do anything else}} that it requires. While the actions mentioned are typical behaviors of BIOS extension ROMs, each option ROM receives total control of the computer and may do anything at all, as noted with more detail in the Extensions section below; it is possible that an option ROM will not return to BIOS, pre-empting the BIOS's <b>boot</b> <b>sequence</b> altogether.|$|E
50|$|Also, if an {{expansion}} ROM wishes {{to change the}} way the system boots unilaterally, it can simply hook INT 19h or other interrupts normally called from interrupt 19h, such as INT 13h, the BIOS disk service, to intercept the BIOS boot process. Then it can replace the BIOS boot process with one of its own, or it can merely modify the <b>boot</b> <b>sequence</b> by inserting its own boot actions into it, by preventing the BIOS from detecting certain devices as bootable, or both. Before the BIOS Boot Specification was promulgated, this was the only way for expansion ROMs to implement boot capability for devices not supported for booting by the native BIOS of the motherboard.|$|E
50|$|The F-series infra-red {{keyboards}} {{contained a}} real-time clock; during the machine's <b>boot</b> <b>sequence,</b> the BIOS would graphically prompt {{the user to}} press the 'DATE/TIME' key. This would transmit the date and time settings from the keyboard to the computer via IR, setting the RTC in the computer. The Infra-Red trackball {{could also be used}} as a mouse by tilting the unit forward - the ball protrudes from {{the top and bottom of}} the unit and can roll on a surface. The units also shipped with fibre-optic 'Light Pipes' that can channel the IR signals, designed to prevent multiple keyboards and trackballs from interfering with adjacent machines in office environments where multiple F-series computers were (predicted to be) in use.|$|E
50|$|VGA {{adapters}} usually support both monochrome {{and color}} modes, though the monochrome mode is almost never used, {{and support for}} the full set of MDA text mode attributes (intense, underline) is often missing. Black and white text on nearly all modern VGA adapters is drawn by using gray colored text on a black background in color mode. VGA monochrome monitors intended primarily for text were sold, but most of them will work at least adequately with a VGA adapter in color mode. Occasionally, a faulty connection between a modern monitor and video card will cause the VGA part of the card to detect the monitor as monochrome; this will cause the BIOS and initial <b>boot</b> <b>sequence</b> to appear in greyscale. Usually, once the video card's drivers are loaded (for example, by continuing to boot into the operating system), they will override this detection and the monitor will return to color.|$|E
50|$|SharpOS {{began in}} November 2006 {{as a public}} {{discussion}} on the Mono development mailing list as a thread named Operating System in C#. After attracting many participants, Michael Schurter created the SharpOS.org wiki and mailing list to continue the discussion at a more relevant location. Soon after, the core developers (Bruce Markham, William Lahti, Sander van Rossen, and Mircea-Cristian Racasan) decided that they would design their own ahead-of-time (AOT) compiler to allow the operating system to run its <b>boot</b> <b>sequence</b> without using another programming language. Once the AOT compiler was far enough developed, the team then started to code the kernel. This was met with long periods of inactivity and few active developers {{due to lack of}} interest in unsafe kernel programming. On 1 January 2008, the SharpOS team made their first milestone release public, this is the first version of the software to appear in the SharpOS SourceForge package repository available for general public use.|$|E
