40|$|Presented in {{this thesis}} is {{a study of the}} effects of {{nano-sized}} particles used as a catalytic additive in composite solid propellant. This study was done with titanium oxide (titania) -based particles, but much of the findings and theory are applicable to any metal oxide produced by a similar method. The process required for efficiently producing larger batches of nanoparticle additives was seen to {{have a significant impact on}} the effectiveness of the additive to modify the burning rate of composite propellant consisting of ammonium perchlorate (AP) and hydroxyl terminated polybutadiene (HTPB). Specifically, titania was seen to be both an effective and ineffective <b>burning</b> <b>rate</b> <b>modifier</b> depending on how the nanoparticle additive was dried and subsequently heat treated. Nanoadditives were produced by various synthesis methods and tested in composite propellant consisting of 80 percent AP. Processability and scale-up effects are examined in selecting ideal synthesis methods of nanoscale titanium oxide for use as a <b>burning</b> <b>rate</b> <b>modifier</b> in composite propellant. Sintering of spray-dried additive agglomerates during the heat-treating process was shown to make the agglomerates difficult to break up during mixing and hinder the dispersion of the additive in the propellant. A link between additive processing, agglomerate dispersion mechanics and ultimately catalytic effect on the burning rate of AP/HTPB propellants has been developed by the theories presented {{in this thesis}}. This thesis studies the interaction between additive dispersion and the dispersion of reactions created by using fine AP in multimodal propellants. A limit in dispersion with powder additives was seen to cause the titania catalyst to be less effective in propellants containing fine AP. A new method for incorporating metal oxide nanoadditives into composite propellant with very high dispersion by suspending the additive material in the propellant binder is introduced. This new method has produced increases in burning rate of 50 to 60 percent over baseline propellants. This thesis reviews these studies with a particular focus on the application and scale-up of these nanoparticle additives to implement these additives in actual motor propellants and assesses many of the current problems and difficulties that hinder the nanoadditives? true potential in composite propellant...|$|E
40|$|Species {{including}} N 2 H 4, NH 3 and N 2 O {{are known}} to be present near the surface of burning hydrazinium nitroformate (HNF). In this paper, planar laser induced fluorescence from the near surface region of burning HNF pellets is reported indicating the presence of NO 2. These four species are formed in the upper (foamy) layer of the solid phase. A <b>burning</b> <b>rate</b> <b>modifier</b> might be selected to induce reactions between the gaseous species in this layer. Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) is able to start highly exothermic reactions at relatively low temperatures. The SCR catalyst V 2 O 5 increases the burning rate of HNF by a factor of 11 at 0. 1 MPa. The pressure exponent is reduced to 0. 28, far below the target value of 0. 5 required for practical application of HNF in propellant formulations. As far as SCR catalysts have been tested as burning rate modifiers of HNF, they are effective, yet incompatible. To overcome this incompatibility remedies might possibly be found in high-temperature catalysts, or in coating particles. © 2011 The Combustion Institute...|$|E

40|$|In {{preparation}} of energetic composite formulations, functionally terminated pre-polymers {{have been used}} as binder. After physically mixing the pre-polymers with oxidizing components, metallic fuel, <b>burning</b> <b>rate</b> <b>modifier</b> and other minor ingredients, they are cured with a suitable curing agent to provide physical and chemical stability. These pre-polymers could be functionalized with carboxyl, epoxide or hydroxyl groups at varying average chain functionalities. For carboxyl-terminated pre-polymers, an epoxy functional curing agents could be used. If the pre-polymer possesses hydroxyl groups, isocyanate functional curing agents are the most suitable curing agents in terms of easy and efficient processing. Glycidyl azide polymer (GAP) is one of the well-known low-molecular weight energetic liquid pre-polymer, which was developed to use as energetic binder, high performance additive and gas generator for high performance smokeless composite propellant and explosive formulations. Linear or branched GAP can be synthesized by nucleophilic substitution reaction of corresponding poly(epichlorohydrin) (PECH) with sodium azide through replacement of chloromethyl groups of PECH with pendant energetic azido-methyl groups on the polyether main chain. Positive heat of formation (+ 957 kJ/kg) enables exothermic and rapid decomposition of GAP producing fuel rich gases. Its polyether main chain provides GAP with relatively low glass transition temperature (Tg= - 48 oC) and presence of hydroxyl functional groups allows it to have easy processing in curing with isocyanate curing agents to form covalently crosslinked polyurethane structure. These outstanding properties of GAP enable it to be used as energetic polymeric binder and high performance additive in {{preparation of}} energetic materials and low vulnerable explosives. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{fact that}} the {{characteristics}} of solid composite propellant can be modified through the incorporation of small amounts of additives has been established for some time. Unfortunately, due to the properties {{of many of these}} materials, a negative consequence is typically exhibited on a different parameter of the propellant, resulting in the requirement of multiple additives to attain the specifications of the propellant. A relatively new class of ingredients, termed “multifunctional additives”, is gaining attention as potential replacements to traditionally used property modifying materials. This report includes a review of currently available multifunctional additives, specifically those used as ballistic modifiers, as well as an investigation of two new materials in this function. ^ Traditional burning rate modifiers for composite solid propellants typically detract from the overall energetics of a propellant formulation and decrease the specific impulse of the motor to which they are added. Transition metal complexes of the energetic ligand bistetrazolamine (BTA) are evaluated in this report as burning rate modifiers that maintain specific impulse of the non-catalyzed propellant. Iron-BTA, specifically, is investigated as a <b>burning</b> <b>rate</b> <b>modifier</b> and is compared to iron oxide. Additionally, four BTA complexes are assessed as ballistic modifiers with chemical equilibrium calculations to determine their effect on the specific impulse of the propellant. It is found that Fe-BTA would be successful as a multifunctional additive, both increasing the burning rate of AP/HTPB propellant and decreasing the loss in specific impulse relative to iron oxide. ^ The second multifunctional additive evaluated in this report is ammonia borane (AB), a material that has been recently gaining attention due to its high content of hydrogen. AB is examined as both a fuel and performance enhancer, increasing the specific impulse of the propellant it is added to. The design of a propellant is described from the chemical equilibrium calculations to the implementation of a viable propellant and safety testing of the new formulation. In the end, it is determined that AB is not an ideal additive for AP based propellants, nor is it compatible with many popular prepolymer curatives in use today. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the development of}} techniques used to investigate the combustion behavior of liquid monopropellants with or without additives, {{with a focus on}} nano-scale particles as burning rate modifiers in nitromethane. The linear burning rates of these mixtures were measured in a constant-volume system at chamber pressures ranging from 3 to 14 MPa, all without direct observation of the propellant burning front. Distinct differences in burning rates were observed between burns using a quartz-lined cavity and those employing plain carbon steel. Several analytical models and numerical approximations were used to estimate the temperature profiles of quartz, steel, and layered strand burner tubes, indicating that the higher burning rates measured in the steel cavity were likely caused by a combination of heat transfer and catalytic effects. The close match between the burning rates of neat nitromethane gathered in this study and those taken from recent studies utilizing optical systems proves the utility of the author?s method, while the consistently measured burning rates of the various nitromethane-based nanofluids prove the versatility of the same method when extended to tests on suspended-particle mixtures. Nano-scale aluminum was used to increase the overall energy density of propellant mixtures, fumed silica powder was used to increase the mixture thickness and encourage aluminum suspension, and nano-scale titania was also included based on its previous use as a <b>burning</b> <b>rate</b> <b>modifier</b> in solid propellants. The silica loading was varied from 1 % to 3 % by weight, aluminum loading was varied from 5 % to 13. 5 % by weight, and titania was added at 1 % by weight. A comprehensive settling study was used to characterize the stability of numerous propellant mixtures, quantifying the particle settling rates of unstable mixtures while subsequently eliminating this instability from all burned configurations. This thesis observed a wide variety of particle effects on the combustion behavior of nitromethane; some of these trends were previously observed by other research groups, while several burning rate effects were observed by the current author for the first time. These novel behavioral trends included an increase in propellant pressure sensitivity over the tested 3 - to 14 -MPa range for mixtures that included 3 % silica by weight, and an even more dramatic increase in pressure sensitivity and linear burning rates was observed only at chamber pressures above 8 MPa for propellants that included 1 % titania by weight without silica. The various performance trends uncovered and techniques developed through this study have already been applied to new mixtures based on more exotic compounds, utilizing the lessons learned herein as a springboard to greatly expand the range of propellants currently tested at Texas A&M University...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} work focuses on studying the combustion characteristics, specifically the <b>burning</b> <b>rates</b> of nanoenergetic materials composed of nano aluminum and nickel oxide. A fluoroelastomer, FC- 2175 (chemically {{the same as}} Viton™), {{was used as the}} binder. Nano aluminum and nickel oxide were chosen as this system is close to a gasless system, does not require pre-heating and has the potential for studying the effects of doping and magnetic field. Various parameters influence the combustion of these composites. Variation of <b>burning</b> <b>rate</b> with particle-size of the oxidizer, binder content, packing density and pressure were studied. The effect of doping the oxidizer and the presence of magnetic field on the <b>burning</b> <b>rate</b> were also studied. The <b>burning</b> <b>rate</b> was found to increase with decrease in particle-size but for smaller particles, specific surface area seemed to be the dominating factor affecting the <b>burning</b> <b>rate.</b> At larger particle-sizes, the results show that the particle-size is the dominating factor affecting the <b>burning</b> <b>rate.</b> The <b>burning</b> <b>rate</b> was also found to decrease with increase in binder content. Similarly, decreasing the pressure increased the <b>burning</b> <b>rate.</b> With increase in packing density, the results show that for this composite, the <b>burning</b> <b>rate</b> first increases and then decreases. This is likely due to the effect of convective and non-planar burning. To study the effect of doping, the oxidizer was doped with lithium (p-doping) and chromium (n-doping). Experiments depicted that doping may affect the <b>burning</b> <b>rate.</b> However, the variation in <b>burning</b> <b>rate</b> was also influenced by other factors like surface area and particle-size of the oxidizer, which varied in this experiment. The doped and undoped oxidizers had different particle-sizes and surface area and due to this, it is unclear if the trend in <b>burning</b> <b>rate</b> for these composites was due to the effect of doping or particle-size and surface area. As nickel is ferromagnetic, the effect of magnetic field on <b>burning</b> <b>rate</b> was explored.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} is performed to determine the local <b>burning</b> <b>rate</b> of vertically oriented burning slabs of PMMA (poly(methyl methacrylate)) under steady-state conditions. The <b>burning</b> <b>rate</b> {{is essential for the}} determination of flame temperatures, flame lengths, and burnout, all critical parameters to establish fire growth. The experimental procedure consists of a postprocessing of digitized images obtained with three CCD cameras placed {{on the sides of the}} PMMA slabs. The cameras are used to establish the displacement of the regressing surface as a function of time. The PMMA/gas interface is characterized by a bubbling layer that scatters light, making the bubbles visible. The video images are processed by establishing a gray-level intensity threshold that defines the depth of the bubbling layer. The local <b>burning</b> <b>rate</b> is then computed from the time derivative of the surface regression. Local <b>burning</b> <b>rates</b> for PMMA slabs, 30 cm high, 3 cm thick, and 2. 5, 5, 10, 15, and 20 cm in width are obtained. Three-dimensional effects appear for 2. 5 -cm-wide slabs. For wider slabs, the local <b>burning</b> <b>rate</b> along the centre line is found not to be width-dependent and to be in good agreement with literature data. Results show that the pyrolyzing surface divides vertically into four regions. In the lowest region (0 < x < 4 cm), the local <b>burning</b> <b>rate</b> increases with the distance from the leading edge, x. For 4 < x < 10 cm, the local <b>burning</b> <b>rate</b> follows a power-law decay. For slabs wider than 2. 5 cm, the exponent approximates - 0. 35.

The results from the extinction tests and the residue analyses indicate that the transient rate augmentation was highly dependent on local enhancement of the combustion zone heat feedback to the surface by the growth of molten residue particles on or just above the burning surface. The size, shape, and number density of molten residue particles, rather than the total residue weight, determined the acceleration-induced <b>burning</b> <b>rate</b> augmentation.

40|$|THE {{addition}} of catalysts normally serves {{the purpose of}} imparting a desired <b>burning</b> <b>rate</b> change in a composite propellant. These may either retard or enhance the <b>burning</b> <b>rate.</b> Some often quoted catalysts are oxides, chromites and chromates of metals. A lot of {{work has been done}} on rinding the effect of the {{addition of}} some of these catalysts on the burning rate; however, none seems to have appeared on the influence of lithium fluoride (LiF). Only qualitative reduction in the <b>burning</b> <b>rate</b> of composite propellants with the addition of LiF was reported by Williams et al. 1 Dickinson and Jackson 2 reported a slight decrease in the specific impulse of composite propellant with the addition of LiF; however, they made no mention of the effect of its addition on the <b>burning</b> <b>rate.</b> We have studied the effect of the addition of varying amounts of LiF on the <b>burning</b> <b>rate</b> of Ammonium Perchlorate (AP) -Polyester propellant...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} {{understand}} the <b>burning</b> <b>rate</b> of AP/HTPB propellant of the base bleed unit, the p-t curves of combustion of AP/HTPB base bleed propellant are measured in the closed bomb. The <b>burning</b> <b>rate</b> formula of the propellant under 50 - 200 MPa is obtained by fitting to the experimental results. Based on division zone combustion theory, a simplified model of the <b>burning</b> <b>rate</b> of AP/HTPB base bleed propellant under high pressure is established. The calculation results and the experimental results are in good agreement...|$|R
40|$|Copper chromites {{are well}} known as <b>burning</b> <b>rate</b> {{catalysts}} for the combustion of composite solid propellants, used {{as a source of}} energy for rocket propulsion. The propellant <b>burning</b> <b>rate</b> depends upon the catalyst characteristics such as chemical composition and specific surface area. In this work, copper chromite samples from different suppliers were characterized by chemical analysis, FT-IR spectroscopy and by surface area measurement (BET). The samples were then evaluated as <b>burning</b> <b>rate</b> catalyst in a typical composite propellant formulation based on HTPB binder, ammonium perchlorate and aluminum. The obtained surface area values are very close to those informed by the catalyst suppliers. The propellant processing as well as its mechanical properties were not substantially affected by the type of catalyst. Some copper chromite catalysts caused an increase in the propellant <b>burning</b> <b>rate</b> in comparison to the iron oxide catalyst. The results show that in addition to the surface area, other parameters like chemical composition, crystalline structure and the presence of impurities might be affecting the catalyst performance. All evaluated copper chromite samples may be used as <b>burning</b> <b>rate</b> catalyst in composite solid propellant formulations, with slight advantages for the SX 14, Cu- 0202 P and Cu- 1800 P samples, which led to the highest <b>burning</b> <b>rate</b> propellants...|$|R

40|$|This report {{represents}} {{an attempt to}} correlate experimental data obtained with a <b>burning</b> <b>rate</b> bomb with the data obtained from the firing of rocket charges, and to obtain <b>burning</b> <b>rate</b> curves for new propellants where insufficient data exists. It was found that very good agreement could be obtained between experimental data obtained in a <b>burning</b> <b>rate</b> bomb and data derived from test firing of rocket charges. A comparison was made among three different propellants which utilized Thiokol LP- 3 for the fuel, and potassium perchlorate and ammonium perchlorate, separately or in combination, for the oxidizer. It was found that potassium perchlorate only gave the fastest <b>burning</b> <b>rate,</b> and the ammonium perchlorate only gave the slowest <b>burning</b> <b>rate,</b> while a mixture of the two gave an intermediate value. An investigation was made on the coning of solid propellant charges. Coning is the term applied when the burning of a solid propellant charge forms a conical burning surface. Normally a flat burning surface is expected and desired. It was found that a wide deviation in the <b>burning</b> <b>rates</b> existed between {{the center of the}} propellant and the edge {{in the case of the}} mixture of the ammonium and potassium perchlorate and the pure ammonium perchlorate oxidizers. The results also showed that the difference in <b>burning</b> <b>rates</b> between the center and edge of the charge increased as the amount of ammonium perchlorate in the oxidizer was increased. The limited investigation seemed to indicate that the fundamental variation in <b>burning</b> <b>rate</b> was the only cause of coning. Best results were obtained from the use of a restricting material similar in nature to the propellant being investigated. In this case, a Thiokol restricting material gave the best results on the Thiokol propellants. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{transient}} ballistics and combustion {{model is}} derived {{to represent the}} closed vessel experiment that is widely used to characterize the high pressure <b>burning</b> <b>rates</b> of solid propellants. The model is applied to explain why <b>burning</b> <b>rates</b> deduced from the closed vessel are in basic agreement with those measured from an equilibrium strand burner {{in the case of}} homogeneous propellants, but differ significantly in the case of nitramine composite propellants. Thermal profile time lag effects become small at high pressure because the <b>burning</b> <b>rates</b> become high. However, the development of the burning surface structure of those nitramine propellants which exhibit shifts in pressure exponent causes the mass <b>burning</b> <b>rate</b> to lag and then exceed the equilibrium value. It is necessary to consider this mechanism in applications dealing with high pressures and pressurization rates...|$|R
