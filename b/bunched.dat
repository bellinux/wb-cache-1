Artner, noted that di Suvero {{was limited to}} his midsize pieces {{because of the size}} of the gallery, and even these were a bit tightly <b>bunched.</b> He felt the Chase Promenade might have served as a better forum and would have left the artist unfettered to choose from a wider range of pieces.|$|E
40|$|An {{amplitude}} ratio of two frequency {{components in the}} beam spectrum gives the <b>bunch</b> length. It is analytically demonstrated that this technique can detect an rms <b>bunch</b> length under that normalized frequencies are less than 1. Such a <b>bunch</b> length monitor was fabricated for the KEKB. Design, hardware {{and the performance of}} a bunch-length monitor are described. The <b>bunch</b> length was measured both in single <b>bunch</b> and multi-bunch modes. The average <b>bunch</b> length in multi-bunch mode with a 4 -bucket <b>bunch</b> spacing did not indicate a significant difference from that in single <b>bunch</b> mode. ...|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{to produce}} and measure {{femtosecond}} electron <b>bunches</b> are described. A 2. 6 MeV rf-gun with thermionic cathode is used at the SUNSHINE (Stanford UNiversity SHort INtense Electron Source) facility in conjunction with an α-magnet for <b>bunch</b> compression to produce f-sec electron <b>bunches.</b> Transition radiation generated by these <b>bunches</b> is analyzed in a Michelson interferometer to determine the <b>bunch</b> length.

5|$|Lambeosaurus {{was like}} other hadrosaurids, and could move on both two legs and all fours, {{as shown by}} {{footprints}} of related animals. It had a long tail stiffened by ossified tendons that prevented it from drooping. The hands had four fingers, lacking the innermost finger of the generalized five-fingered tetrapod hand, while the second, third, and fourth fingers were <b>bunched</b> together and bore hooves, suggesting the animal could have used the hands for support. The fifth finger was free and {{could be used to}} manipulate objects. Each foot had only the three central toes.|$|E
5|$|A break formed after , {{including}} Gustavo César, Cameron Meyer, Dmytro Grabovskyy and Alessandro Donati. Soon after, Levi Leipheimer crashed, but was unhurt. The break was caught, and a solo break {{was formed}} by Vladimir Isaichev. Astana drove the peloton up the Turchino, the day's lone climb, with Armstrong leading the descent and race leader Danilo Di Luca somewhat surprisingly coming forward to hold Armstrong's wheel. Some riders tried to escape for victory on the way into Arenzano, but the sprinters' teams worked to keep the field together, and Mark Cavendish took another <b>bunched</b> sprint win over Tyler Farrar and Alessandro Petacchi.|$|E
5|$|From 21 April 2001, Live & Kicking began {{broadcasting}} from BBC Scotland in Glasgow and saw Farley, Cawood and Deley {{joined by}} Heather Suttie who replaced Hill. The set {{remained the same}} after having been transported up to Glasgow from London, however a new seating area was added, consisting of pouffes and beanbags. The feel of the show also changed and was also split into three sections. The first hour became Kicking Toons which <b>bunched</b> all the cartoons together, the next hour would feature {{the main components of}} Live & Kicking including the games and sketches and the final hour became Live & Loud which featured all the music performances.|$|E
40|$|The Cornell Electron-Positron Storage Ring (CESR) has a {{longitudinal}} dipole-coupled-bunch instability that limits {{the total amount}} of current that can be stored in the ring without feedback. As a result, {{it is one of the}} major limitations for higher stored current and luminosity. This paper reports the measurements of multiple <b>bunch</b> longitudinal dynamics done on CESR with a streak camera. The camera was used to measure the dependence of the <b>bunch</b> distribution on current and accelerating RF voltage, for multiple <b>bunches</b> stored in CESR, as well as the effects of the longitudinal instability on the <b>bunch</b> distribution. Measurements of the beam’s longitudinal <b>bunch</b> distribution with multiple <b>bunches</b> present in the ring, help give an understanding of the instability, how it affects the <b>bunch</b> distribution, and possibly give insight into a cure of the instability. 1. Multiple <b>Bunch</b> Operations at CESR Multiple <b>bunches</b> refers to more than one <b>bunch</b> of electrons or positrons being present in CESR at one time. Multiple <b>bunches</b> in CESR are necessary to achieve high luminosity. Under present high energy physics colliding beam conditions, there are up to nine nearly evenly spaced trains of <b>bunches,</b> with up to five <b>bunches</b> in each train, for a maximum of 45 electron and 45 positron <b>bunches.</b> The <b>bunches</b> are separated at crossing points, other than the interaction point, by vertical and horizonta...|$|R
40|$|Linear accelerators {{employed}} as drivers for X-ray free electron lasers (FELs) require relativistic electron <b>bunch</b> with sub-picosecond <b>bunch</b> length. Precise <b>bunch</b> length measurements {{are important for}} the tuning and operation of the FELs. Previously, we have demonstrated that electro-optic detection is a powerful technique for sub-picosecond electron <b>bunch</b> length measurements. In those experiments, the measured <b>bunch</b> length was the average of all electron <b>bunches</b> within a macropulse. Here, for the first time, we present the measurement {{of the length of}} individual electron <b>bunches</b> using a development of our previous technique. In this experiment, the longitudinal electron <b>bunch</b> shape is encoded electro-optically on to the frequency spectrum of a chirped laser pulse. Subsequently, the laser pulse is dispersed by a grating and the spectrum is imaged with a CCD camera. Single <b>bunch</b> measurements are achieved by using a nanosecond gated camera, and synchronizing the gate with both the electron <b>bunch</b> and the laser pulse repetition rates. The electron <b>bunch</b> length is determined by measuring the laser pulse spectra with and without the presence of an electron <b>bunch.</b> We demonstrate that this method enables a real-time diagnostic for the <b>bunch</b> length of single electron <b>bunches</b> with a time resolution of 370 femtoseconds and a high signal-noise-ratio. r 2002 Elsevie...|$|R
40|$|When a {{low energy}} {{electron}} <b>bunch</b> (∼ 20 [*][*]MeV) crosses from {{top of a}} high energy <b>bunch</b> (e. g., 3  GeV) at an angle (e. g., 45 °), the Coulomb force exerted on the high energy <b>bunch</b> by the low energy <b>bunch</b> will kick a very short (∼ 150 [*][*]fs) slice from {{the core of the}} high energy <b>bunch.</b> The slice of electron <b>bunch</b> can generate ultrashort x-ray pulse. In this paper, we will give analytical expressions about the angular kicks dependence on the crossing angle by assuming a Gaussian distribution for the low energy <b>bunch.</b> Applying the analytical results to the storage ring <b>bunch</b> in NSLS-II [1], we will discuss the optimized parameters of the electron beam slicing system in order to obtain a very short slice <b>bunch</b> and a sufficient separation between the slice and the core <b>bunch...</b>|$|R
5|$|At the {{designated}} time of 05:25, the British opened {{up with an}} artillery barrage on the German positions just as the Australian forces entered no man's land for the attack. Heavy machine gun fire assaulted the troops from all directions as they <b>bunched</b> together on the firmer ground to avoid sinking in the boggy mud. Serious resistance was encountered at Hilside Farm, a strong point {{to the east of}} Augustus Wood in the centre of the highest part of the Passchendaele ridge. The position consisted of two pillboxes, supported by fifty metres of trench that was occupied by approximately thirty men with four machine guns. The fire from these machine guns forced the men of the 34th Battalion to seek cover on the exposed crest and threatened to halt the entire advance.|$|E
5|$|The {{posterior}} thoracic {{group is}} made up of six somites, each possessing a pair of long multi-jointed appendages. The segments of these appendages are longer near the body and taper towards the flexible distal segments, extending past the carapace. They bear a fringe of long, slender filaments, all of which are directed towards the middle of the body, a characteristic shared by extant crustaceans. Though usually squashed into blade-like shapes from the fossilisation process, the filaments were slender cylindrical tubes when the animal was alive. The filaments at the tipmost segment are often <b>bunched</b> together. These appendages are believed to be the exopodites and may have functioned as gills and as swimming limbs. They are possibly biramous, with some specimens showing traces of what may be small endopodites at their bases.|$|E
5|$|Very little went {{as planned}} during the landing at Omaha. Difficulties in {{navigation}} caused {{the majority of}} landing craft to miss their targets throughout the day. The defenses were unexpectedly strong, and inflicted heavy casualties on landing U.S. troops. Under heavy fire, the engineers struggled to clear the beach obstacles; later landings <b>bunched</b> up around the few channels that were cleared. Weakened by the casualties taken just in landing, the surviving assault troops could not clear the heavily defended exits off the beach. This caused further problems and consequent delays for later landings. Small penetrations were eventually achieved by groups of survivors making improvised assaults, scaling the bluffs between the most heavily defended points. By {{the end of the}} day, two small isolated footholds had been won, which were subsequently exploited against weaker defenses further inland, thus achieving the original D-Day objectives over the following days.|$|E

40|$|Considering {{growth of}} a vicinal face from solution, by {{carrying}} out Monte Carlo simulation, we study step <b>bunching</b> induced by flow of atoms in solution. For simplicity, we use two-diffusional solution field and one-dimensional vicinal face. When the flow of atoms in solution is in the step-down direction, the vicinal face is unstable and step <b>bunching</b> occurs. When the flow is fast, small <b>bunches</b> are formed in the inital stage. The size of <b>bunches</b> increases by coalescence of small <b>bunches.</b> In a later stage, coalescence and separation of <b>bunches</b> repeatedly occur, {{and the size of}} <b>bunches</b> is saturated.

40|$|We study step <b>bunching</b> under {{conditions}} of attachment/detachment limited kinetics {{in the presence of}} a deposition or sublimation flux, which leads to <b>bunch</b> motion. Analysis of the discrete step dynamics reveals that the <b>bunch</b> velocity is inversely proportional to the <b>bunch</b> size for general step-step interactions. The shape of steadily moving <b>bunches</b> is studied within a continuum theory, and analytic expressions for the <b>bunch</b> profile are derived. Scaling laws obtained previously for non-moving <b>bunches</b> are recovered asymptotically, but singularities of the static theory are removed and strong corrections to scaling are found. The size of the largest terrace between two <b>bunches</b> is identified as a central scaling parameter. Our theory applies to a large class of <b>bunching</b> instabilities, including sublimation with attachment asymmetry and surface electromigration in the presence of sublimation or growth...|$|R
