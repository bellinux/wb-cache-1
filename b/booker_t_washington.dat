Bethune had met with Washington in 1896 and was impressed by his clout with his donors.|$|E

The tag team match got underway, and JBL was {{led to believe that}} <b>Booker</b> <b>T</b> was going to betray Van Dam and Mysterio, as <b>Booker</b> <b>T</b> warned both Van Dam and Mysterio not to interfere with him during the match. The match concluded with <b>Booker</b> <b>T</b> pinning JBL after an axe kick, thus turning Booker face. The following week on SmackDown!, <b>Booker</b> <b>T</b> defeated Orlando Jordan to earn the right to face JBL for the WWE Championship at Survivor Series.

5|$|John Chilembwe, born locally {{in around}} 1871, {{received}} his early education at a Church of Scotland mission and later met Joseph Booth, a radical Baptist missionary {{who ran the}} Zambezi Industrial Mission. Booth preached a form of egalitarianism and his progressive attitude towards race attracted Chilembwe's attention. Under Booth's patronage, Chilembwe travelled to the United States to study at a theological college in Virginia. There he mixed in African-American circles and was influenced by stories of the abolitionist John Brown and the egalitarianist <b>Booker</b> <b>T.</b> <b>Washington.</b>|$|E

5|$|When she died, Tubman {{was buried}} with semi-military honors at Fort Hill Cemetery in Auburn. The city commemorated {{her life with}} a plaque on the courthouse. Although it showed pride for her many achievements, its use of dialect ("I nebber run my train off de track"), {{apparently}} chosen for its authenticity, {{has been criticized for}} undermining her stature as an American patriot and dedicated humanitarian. Still, the dedication ceremony was a powerful tribute to her memory, and <b>Booker</b> <b>T.</b> <b>Washington</b> delivered the keynote address. The Harriet Tubman home was abandoned after 1920, but was later renovated by the AME Zion Church. Today, it welcomes visitors as a museum and education center.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} decade of the new century, Du Bois emerged as a {{spokesperson}} for his race, second only to <b>Booker</b> <b>T.</b> <b>Washington.</b> Washington was the director of the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, and wielded tremendous influence within the African-American and white communities. Washington was the architect of the Atlanta Compromise, an unwritten deal he struck in 1895 with Southern white leaders who dominated state governments after Reconstruction. Essentially the agreement provided that Southern blacks, who overwhelmingly lived in rural communities, would submit to the current discrimination, segregation, disenfranchisement, and non-unionized employment; that Southern whites would permit blacks to receive a basic education, some economic opportunities, and justice within the legal system; and that Northern whites would invest in Southern enterprises and fund black educational charities.Lewis, pp. 180–181.Logan, Rayford Whittingham (1997), The Betrayal of the Negro, from Rutherford B.

5|$|Information about Chilembwe’s Church {{before the}} {{rebellion}} is scant, but his ideology proved popular and {{he developed a}} strong local following. For {{at least the first}} 12 years of his ministry, he preached ideas of African self-respect and advancement through education, hard work and personal responsibility, as advocated by <b>Booker</b> <b>T.</b> <b>Washington,</b> and he encouraged his followers to adopt European-style dress and habits. His activities were initially supported by white protestant missionaries., although his relations with Catholic missions were less friendly. he Mission's schools meanwhile began teaching racial equality, based on Christian teaching and anti-colonialism. Many of his followers came from the local middle-class, who had similarly adopted European customs. Chilembwe's acceptance of European culture created an unorthodox anti-colonial ideology based around a form of nationalism, rather than a desire to restore the pre-colonial social order.|$|E

5|$|The next match pitted <b>Booker</b> <b>T</b> against Robert Roode, who was {{accompanied}} by Payton Banks, in a bout lasting nine minutes and seventeen seconds. Near the end, <b>Booker</b> <b>T</b> began to bash Roode's leg against the ringpost. Afterwards, Roode began walking to the backstage area as <b>Booker</b> <b>T</b> followed continuing the fight as the referee counted out both men, ending the contest in a draw. <b>Booker</b> <b>T</b> and Roode fought throughout the backstage area into the parking lot, where Roode pulled Banks from the driver's seat of a car before making his own get away leaving <b>Booker</b> <b>T</b> and Banks behind.|$|R
500|$|The other {{featured}} preliminary {{match was}} Kurt Angle versus <b>Booker</b> <b>T</b> in a singles match. On {{an episode of}} SmackDown!, Angle, <b>Booker</b> <b>T,</b> Big Show and JBL {{took part in a}} Fatal four-way match to determine the number one contender to the WWE championship, which JBL won. The following week, Angle challenged <b>Booker</b> <b>T</b> to a match at Judgment Day, which Booker accepted. Prior to that, Angle had insulted <b>Booker</b> <b>T's</b> wife, Sharmell, which led to <b>Booker</b> <b>T</b> attacking and accepting Angle's challenge. On the May 12 episode of SmackDown!, Angle admitted he would like to have [...] "perverted sex" [...] with Sharmell. That same night, Angle and <b>Booker</b> <b>T</b> were scheduled in a match, which led to Angle leaving the ring and going backstage to Sharmell. <b>Booker</b> <b>T</b> went backstage and found Sharmell on the floor crying. This led to Angle attacking <b>Booker</b> <b>T</b> from behind and pushing him towards a pair of steel lockers. The following week, Long was scripted to suspend Angle and demanded that Angle apologize for his actions. Angle apologized, but admitted that he actually kissed Sharmell and let her fondle his [...] "private parts" [...] before <b>Booker</b> <b>T</b> {{made his way to the}} locker room.|$|R
5|$|The match Kaz and <b>Booker</b> <b>T</b> versus Christian Cage and Robert Roode {{was also}} scheduled.
