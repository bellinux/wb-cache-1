50|$|First {{developed}} in 1725, blueprinting uses a wet process {{to produce an}} image of white lines on a cyan or Prussian blue ground. To make a <b>blueprint,</b> a heavy <b>paper</b> (or more rarely drafting linen) support is impregnated with potassium ferricyanide and ferric ammonium, placed under a translucent original drawing, weighted with glass, and exposed to ultraviolet light. After sufficient light exposure, the glass and original drawing are removed and the <b>blueprint</b> <b>paper</b> is washed to reveal a negative image.

5000|$|A {{blueprint}} is {{a reproduction}} of a technical drawing, documenting an architecture or an engineering design, using a contact print process on light-sensitive sheets. Introduced in the 19th century, the process allowed rapid and accurate reproduction of documents used in construction and industry. The blue-print process was characterized by light-colored lines on a blue background, a negative of the original. The process was unable to reproduce color or shades of grey. [...] Various base materials {{have been used for}} <b>blueprints.</b> <b>Paper</b> was a common choice; for more durable prints linen was sometimes used, but with time, the linen prints would shrink slightly.

The Local Agenda 21 was derived from The Agenda 21, the main document of sustainable development agreed by UN in 1992. It is generally known that society development, population growth and growing peoples needs meet the limited quantities of the resources. Exactly this conflict between unlimited peoples wants and the limited amount of the resources has led to creating the Agenda 21 which was the reaction to unreasonable wastage of the resources and to environment deterioration.

Software processmodeling is often a challenging and expensive endeavor, because a well specified processmay still include inefficiencies that are hardly detected before enacting it. Thus, assessing process quality is a relevant concern to improve several aspects such as conceptual integrity, correctness, usability, maintainability, and performance, among others. This paper describes AVISPA, a graphical tool that allows analyzing the quality of SPEM 2. 0 software processes models. AVISPA identifies a series of error patterns and highlights them in different blueprints.

40|$|Impact {{investing}} {{has been}} revolutionary {{in the history}} of capital markets. The concept refers to investments with the intention of generating positive social impact over and above financial returns. Over the last six years, impact investing has moved from the margins to the mainstream with an estimated market size of $ 46 billion in 2014 (World Economic Forum, 2014), shifting the paradigm on how the world blends impact with financial returns. But there is more to be achieved. A 55 % annual growth rate would be required to reach the target market size of $ 1 trillion by 2020 (J. P. Morgan, 2010). This exponential growth can be achieved only by unlocking mission-oriented capital at scale, by bringing in new actors from the private sector to support sustainable development and by developing innovative financial products that can channelize resources to high impact entities - which in turn can deliver scalable and sustainable market-based solutions. Leveraging its expertise in innovative finance, Impact Investment Exchange Asia (IIX) sets out to achieve this by developing a new financial product that seeks to bridge the current gap between development and finance: the IIX Sustainability Bond (ISB). ISBs are debt securities that pool together in a single portfolio, a group of high-impact entities that have undergone a rigorous due diligence process based on both social and financial criteria. This unique pooled structure allows underlying borrowers to access large amounts of capital that they would not otherwise have been able to raise individually. ISBs are designed to be sustainable instruments, offering attractive rates of risk-adjusted returns to impact investors who are interested in a double bottom line. ISBs will be listed on the Stock Exchange of Mauritius, adding an additional layer of secondary liquidity, mission protection and transparency. IIX's commitment-to action to the Clinton Global initiative, the first ISB, is the Women's Livelihood Bond (WLB), a $ 20 million debt security designed to unlock capital for Impact Enterprises (IEs) and Microfinance Institute (MFIs) {{that are part of the}} sustainable livelihoods spectrum for women in South-East Asia. The WLB is projected to empower over half a million women with access to credit, to market linkages, to natural resources and to affordable goods and services. This will, in turn, help them transition from subsistence to sustainable livelihoods and redefine the dominant narrative from viewing women as victims to recognizing them as solutions to development, change and progress. This <b>Blueprint</b> <b>Paper,</b> developed by IIX's sister non-profit entity Shujog, aims to provide an overview of the bond mechanics by outlining the key steps involved in the bond structuring process. Supported by the Rockefeller Foundation, a visionary catalyst in the impact investing space, this preliminary paper will capture the progress made to date by IIX on product, pipeline and partnership development. A subsequent paper will be published post bond issuance which will capture the key steps involved in selling the bond to investors and listing it on the Stock Exchange of Mauritius. Shujog hopes this paper will act as a roadmap for other stakeholders in the space to create similar instruments that are designed to change finance and finance change...|$|R
40|$|China and Inner Asia Session 618 : The Rise and Global Impact of the Chinese Academy: Does the Education <b>Blueprint</b> Matter?This <b>paper</b> {{explores the}} {{challenges}} of higher education reform in China through {{a case study of}} recent reform efforts at Shantou University in southeast China. Reforms proposed in the 2020 Blueprint most relevant to this analysis include installing faculty governance, empowering university administrators, and allowing open recruitment of faculty members. These bold initiatives have been launched and tested at Shantou University since 2002, with funding support from Hong Kong-based billionaire entrepreneur, Li Ka-shing. The paper particularly focuses on HR (human resources) reform efforts at Shantou’s School of Journalism and Communication. In the context of achievements, challenges and obstacles of Shantou’s overall reform efforts, the author argues that HR reforms are {{critical to the success of}} other reform initiatives, but changes in the HR system are likewise contingent upon larger structural changes outside the university, such as reforms in China’s Hukou system. The author also argues that for 2020 Blueprint policies to succeed, the government must adopt a value approach (as much as a functional approach) to higher education reform by promoting fundamental values that underlie academic excellence: openness, transparency, and the pursuit of knowledge for its own intrinsic value. Lessons from Shantou can map reform trajectories for other universities and inform government implementation of Blueprint 2020 reform proposals. As the only Chinese public university funded mainly by private money, Shantou University also provides a unique test-of-concept for the government’s proposal to promote a private-public mixed mode of university funding. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to give {{background}} information on current barriers to trade in four services sectors in the ASEAN region. The information was summarized in a companion paper (Dee 2009), which also laid out concrete proposals for achieving the liberalization targets for these sectors from the ASEAN Economic Blueprint. The four key services are medical services (medical, dental and paramedical services), health services (hospital, medical laboratory and ambulance services), banking services and insurance services. The medical and health sectors are priority sectors under the ASEAN Economic Community <b>Blueprint.</b> This <b>paper</b> describes the survey instruments that were used to collect information about current regulatory policy settings in these sectors in each of the ten ASEAN economies, gives a detailed presentation of results, and compares the results to other recent surveys of services trade barriers in these sectors. In the case of healthcare, there are few comparable cross-country studies, and none that have looked at the evolution of services trade barriers over time. In the case of banking and insurance, by contrast, there have been several previous studies, two of which have looked at how services trade barriers in these sectors have changed over time. In this paper, the most recent information on barriers to financial services trade in ASEAN is also made comparable to that in these other recent studies, so that the current situation in ASEAN can be compared with the recent situation in a number of other developed and developing countries. The findings of the other recent studies on the patterns of financial services liberalization over time are also summarized, as this can give insights into likely patterns of liberalization in ASEAN.

However, in actual fact, at present the {{government}} agents in charge are still using graphical data {{in the form of}} maps and manual information data (<b>blueprints</b> and <b>paper)</b> which results in various problems. Some of the problems include problems in data storage since the map and information data available at present are saved using paper media which would not last very long and easily damaged, problems in planning the maintenance of road ways, bridges and traffic lights because of the relatively long time spent to check the condition, last maintenance time, and associating acquired data with the maps, which could take half a day (according to the amount of data searched) since the checking of data is done manually and separately (disintegrated) from the information data in the maps. Furthermore, manual data checking has a low level of accuracy, since there could be data skipped in the checking process. To overcome the problem of traffic inventory (road ways, bridges and traffic lights) in Denpasar, a GIS-based System (Geographical Information System) is designed and made in this final project, which could deliver information on road ways, bridges and traffic lights in Denpasar in detail. This system would give solutions to the problems such as digital (softcopy) and integrated map data and information data storage so that the map data will last longer and not easily damaged (not including the condition of force majeure), decision making in planning the maintenance of road ways, bridges and traffic lights could be made faster since the checking of the condition, last maintenance time and map marking is done by the system to the integrated data and takes just a few seconds to complete.
