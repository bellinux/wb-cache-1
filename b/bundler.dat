The legal ramifications of lobbying are further intertangled with aspects of campaign finance reform, since lobbyists often spend time seeking donations for the reelection efforts of congresspersons; sorting out these issues can pose ethical challenges.|$|R

40|$|During {{animal cell}} division, the central spindle, an anti-parallel {{microtubule}} bundle structure formed between segregating chromosomes during anaphase, cooperates with astral microtubules {{to position the}} cleavage furrow. Because the central spindle is the only structure linking {{the two halves of}} the mitotic spindle, it is under mechanical tension from dynein-generated cortical pulling forces, which determine spindle positioning and drive chromosome segregation through spindle elongation. The central spindle should be flexible enough for efficient chromosome segregation while maintaining its structural integrity for reliable cytokinesis. How the cell balances these potentially conflicting requirements is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the central spindle in C. elegans embryos has a resilient mechanism for recovery from perturbations by excess tension derived from cortical pulling forces. This mechanism involves the direct interaction of two different types of conserved microtubule <b>bundlers</b> that are crucial for central spindle formation, PRC 1 and centralspindlin. ...|$|R
40|$|Invadopodia and filopodia are dynamic, actin-based {{protrusions}} {{contributing to}} cancer cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. The force of actin bundles {{is essential for}} their protrusive activity. The bundling protein fascin is known {{to play a role}} in both invadopodia and filopodia. As it is more and more acknowledged that functionally related proteins cooperate, it is unlikely that only fascin bundles actin in these protrusions. Another interesting candidate is L-plastin, normally expressed in hematopoietic cells, but considered a common marker of many cancer types. We identified L-plastin as a new component of invadopodia, where it contributes to degradation and invasiveness. By means of specific, high-affinity nanobodies inhibiting bundling of fascin or L-plastin, we further unraveled their cooperative mode of action. We show that the <b>bundlers</b> cannot compensate for each other due to strikingly different bundling characteristics: L-plastin bundles are much thinner and less tightly packed. Composite bundles adopt an intermediate phenotype, with fascin delivering the rigidity and strength for protrusive force and structural stability, whereas L-plastin accounts for the flexibility needed for elongation. Consistent with this, elevated L-plastin expression promotes elongation and reduces protrusion density in cells with relatively lower L-plastin than fascin levels...|$|R

40|$|Microtubules {{and other}} {{proteins}} self-organize into complex dynamic {{structures such as}} the mitotic spindle, which separates the chromosomes during cell division. Much {{is known about the}} individual molecular players involved in assembly and positioning of the mitotic spindle, but how they act together to generate the often unexpected behavior of the whole microtubule system is not understood. Two recent papers use a combination of experimental (imaging) and theoretical (computer simulation) methods to explore the formation of bipolar linear microtubule arrays in fission yeast and the oscillatory movement of the mitotic spindle in the nematode worm. In the simulation approach, the rules for the interactions of the components (microtubules and microtubule-associated proteins) are specified and the evolution of the system is followed, with the aim of identifying the minimal set of components that can mimic the real system. The work on fission yeast concludes that bipolar microtubule structures can arise from self-organization of microtubules through nucleators, <b>bundlers,</b> and sliders, without a requirement for a special microtubule-organizing center. The work on the worm embryo suggests that both the positive feedback that drives oscillations and the centering force that limits their amplitude may arise from microtubule pulling forces. The systems approach exemplified by these papers should stimulate new experiments aimed at discovering the principles of cellular organization...|$|R
40|$|In the United States it {{is taken}} for granted {{that members of the}} public should have access to {{information}} about their government. This access takes many forms, including the ability to obtain copies of government documents, the ability to attend meetings of government officials, and the related obligations of government officials to document their activities and to reveal certain otherwise private information about themselves. This access also is often limited by countervailing concerns, such as the privacy of individual citizens and national security. Nevertheless, the presumption both at the federal level and in every state is to provide such access. Now, however, a number of public debates raise the issue of whether this right to know should extend beyond government-government and private-government interactions to also reach private-private interactions that indirectly attempt to influence government officials. For example, should the right to know extend to public identification of 2 ̆ 2 <b>bundlers</b> 2 ̆ 2 who successfully encourage others to make substantial campaign contributions? Similarly, should the right to know require the public disclosure of all significant funders for election-related spending done independently of candidates and political parties? Should the right to know also extend to significant funders behind grassroots lobbying efforts? This Article explores these questions. Part I briefly describes the history of the public’s right to know in the United States. Part II explains and critiques the reasons commonly asserted to support the public’s right to know, considering whether they in fact support a right to know about government-related activities and actors {{on the part of the}} public, including when it comes to private-private political interactions. Finally, Part III considers the extent to which the public’s right to know should extend to certain specific types of private-private interactions that have political ramifications...|$|R
40|$|The {{workshop}} {{took place}} at Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke), Suonenjoki Research Unit November 25 – 26, 2015. Workshop was arranged as a joint arrangement between Luke and Latvian State Forest Research Institute "Silava" and the main sponsor was Nordic Forest Research (SNS) / Operating Systems for Centre of Advanced Research (OSCAR 2, 2011 - 2015). This OSCAR Workshop was also promoted by IUFRO Research Group 3. 02. 00 Stand establishment and treatment. Altogether 28 participants from Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania and Sweden participated in the workshop. The objective of the workshop was to present ongoing research concerning mechanized silviculture in Nordic and Baltic countries and to discuss future research needs. State of art reports about mechanized silviculture from Sweden and Finland were presented and discussed. In the Swedish review, inverting; interface from nursery to planting machine; feeding of seedlings in planting device; identification of plantings spots and obstacles as well as planting device development without compactation were covered. In the Finnish part, mechanized planting and mechanized young stand management were discussed. Finally, {{the differences between the}} Swedish and Finnish Scots pine management cultures were discussed. The ongoing research projects concerning forest regeneration, drainage and management of young stands in Baltic countries were presented and discussed. The overview about the management of Latvia’s state forests started the session following {{the state of the art}} review of the ongoing research activities in mechanization of silviculture in Latvia. Next, the work productivity of wood ash forest fertilization was discovered. Forest regeneration and young stand management in Estonia followed. In conclusion, SeedPAD, as a new and efficient Scots pine regeneration method in Northern Sweden, was viewed. New ways of young stand management were presented and discussed. At first, the productivity of Vimek harvester and forwarder were scrutinized. Next, Fixteri FX 15 a small-tree <b>bundlers</b> work processes and productivity in early pine dominated thinnings were considered following an overview of the evolution of innovative systems for small diameter tree harvest in Sweden. In the end, biocontrol methods against hardwood sprouting using Chondrostereum purpureum were covered. In the workshop the need for further Nordic-Baltic co-operation was strongly emphasized. Cooperation in research activities as well as in dissemination of new research findings and in deployment of new innovation were widely discussed. Workshop included also a short field excursion where the PCT operation with “Tehojätkä” (Usewood Forest Master) and young stands treated with Naarva uprooter were demonstrated. 201...|$|R

40|$|To {{meet the}} 'Twenty in Ten Initiative' goals {{set in the}} 2007 State of the Union address, forest {{resources}} will be needed as feedstocks for lignocellulosic ethanol production. It {{has been estimated that}} 368 million dry tons can be produced annually in the U. S. from logging residues and fuel treatment thinnings. Currently, very little of this woody biomass is used for energy production due to the costs and difficulty in collecting and transporting this material. However, minimizing biomass costs (including harvest, handling, transport, storage, and processing costs) delivered to the refinery is necessary to develop a sustainable cellulosic ethanol industry. Achieving this goal requires a fresh look at conventional timber harvesting operations to identify ways of efficiently integrating energy wood collection and developing cost-effective technologies to harvest small-diameter trees. In conventional whole-tree logging operations, entire trees are felled and skidded from the stump to the landing. The residues (also called slash), consisting of tops and limbs, accumulate at the landing when trees are delimbed. This slash can be ground at the landing with a mobile grinder or transported to another central location with a stationary grinder. The ground material is transported via chip vans, or possibly large roll on/off containers, to the user facility. Cut-to-length harvesting systems are gaining popularity in some locations. In these operations, specialized harvesters that can fall, delimb, and cut logs to length are used. The small diameter tops and limbs accumulate along the machine's track. It can be left in the forest to dry or removed soon after harvest while logs are extracted. Removing slash during the same operation as the wood {{has been shown to be}} more efficient. However, leaving residue in the forest to dry reduces moisture content, which improves grinder performance, reduces dry matter loss during storage, and inhibits colonization of fungi that produce harmful spores. In recent years, new machines that are specially designed for collection of small diameter wood have been developed in the U. S. and Europe. Residue <b>bundlers</b> and balers improve transportation and handling efficiency by densifying the material and packaging it so that it can be handled with conventional equipment. An experimental integrated harvester/grinder can fall small diameter trees and feed them into a grinder. The ground material is collected in a bin that can be dumped into a chip van. The harvester head is also capable of delimbing and bucking (cut into sections) small timber to be used for pulp and posts. Limitations of these new technologies are their large capital costs and complexity, leading to high maintenance costs and the need for highly trained operators. To ensure that quality feedstock materials consistently enter the mouth of the refinery, the uniform format supply system concept proposes that feedstock diversity be managed at harvest, much like the current grain supply system. This allows for standardization of key infrastructure components and facilitation of a biomass commodity system. Challenges in achieving a uniform woody biomass supply include, but are not limited to, developing machines for efficient harvest of small-diameter trees in a range of topographies and conditions, developing machines and operating plans for grinding biomass as near to the stump as possible, developing cost-effective drying strategies to reduce losses and mold growth during wood chip storage, and quantifying environmental impacts of slash removal and fuel thinnings to aid landowner decisions and policy development...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Cells {{carrying}} out mitosis {{must ensure that}} each daughter cell receives {{a full complement of}} chromosomes. As part of this process, multiprotein complexes called kinetochores link centromeric DNA to microtubule plus ends. This attachment allows cells to carry out two tasks that are essential for proper chromosome segregation. It couples chromosome position to microtubule plus end dynamics to allow maneuvering of chromosomes. It also senses whether chromosomes have been correctly attached to the spindle, correcting errors and delaying the cell cycle as necessary. That the kinetochore can maintain attachment to a microtubule plus end that is constantly polymerizing and disintegrating under its grip is one of the kinetochore's more extraordinary feats. Why evolution has chosen to utilize the plus-end, one of the cell's most ephemeral structures, as the site of its crucial chromosomal attachments is unknown. My lab previously isolated a Saccharomyces cerevisiae kinetochore mutant, DAM 1 - 765, whose kinetochores retain their initial lateral attachment to the microtubule lattice instead of maturing into end-on attachments. Despite this fundamental defect in spindle organization, DAM 1 - 765 cells proliferate nearly as rapidly as wild-type. To determine how end-on kinetochore-microtubule attachments benefit the cell, I performed a synthetic lethal screen against DAM 1 - 765. This screen produced mutant alleles of the EB 1 homolog Bim 1, CLIP- 170 homolog Bik 1, and the kinesin- 14 subunits Kar 3 and Cik 1. Cells possessing these mutations fail to properly bundle spindle microtubules and struggle to biorient chromosomes, phenotypes which are exacerbated in the presence of DAM 1 - 765. The presence of a kinetochore capping the plus end of a kinetochore microtubule appears to assist in the proper development of interpolar microtubules. In the absence of such a cap, spindle microtubules are poorly organized, and spindles are short and subject to collapse. Three proteins identified in my synthetic lethal screen, Bim 1 and Kar 3 /Cik 1, are believed to be involved in bundling and regulating interpolar microtubules. It is unknown, however, how these proteins accomplish these tasks when they are only known to be able to bind to a single microtubule. I have identified a potential Bim 1 binding motif, SxIP, on Cik 1 's N-terminus. This motif is highly conserved among kinesin- 14 s. To determine the role this motif plays in kinesin- 14 function on the mitotic spindle, I mutated this motif to alanine residues and assayed the mutation's effect on spindle structure via fluorescence microscopy. The motif is important for recruitment of Cik 1 to the spindle and for maintenance of proper spindle length in both metaphase and anaphase. The existence of a greater Bim 1 /Kar 3 /Cik 1 complex capable of binding to two microtubules (one via Bim 1 's calponin homology domain, and one via Kar 3 /Cik 1 's motor and motor homology domains) could explain how Bim 1 and Kar 3 /Cik 1 are able to bundle interpolar microtubules together. This work confirms that Bim 1, Kar 3, and Cik 1 are important <b>bundlers</b> and regulators of interpolar microtubules and raises the possibility that Bik 1 may be involved in this process as well. It suggests a mechanism by which Bim 1 and Kar 3 /Cik 1 may carry out these tasks. It also demonstrates that regulation of the different cohorts of spindle microtubules is intimately linked; interpolar microtubules rely on the proper maturation of kinetochore microtubules to properly develop themselves...|$|R
