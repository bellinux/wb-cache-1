50|$|The 120 film {{format is}} a roll film which is {{nominally}} 60 mm wide (in fact, about 61 mm, or 2.4 inches). The film {{is held in}} an open spool originally made of wood with metal flanges, later with all-metal, and finally with all-plastic. The length of film is typically 30 in up to 32 - 33 in, attached {{to a piece of}} <b>backing</b> <b>paper</b> longer and slightly wider than the film. The <b>backing</b> <b>paper</b> protects the film while it is wound on the spool, with enough extra length to allow loading and unloading the roll in daylight without exposing any of the film. Frame number markings for three standard image formats (6×4.5, 6×6, and 6×9; see below) are printed on the <b>backing</b> <b>paper.</b>|$|E

50|$|Those {{wishing to}} {{photograph}} with an 828-format camera have few options. As of 2005, 828 film {{is available for}} purchase on the Internet; this film is probably respooled from bulk unperforated 35mm film. Another option is to use standard 135 film, with sprocket holes, and respool it with used 828 <b>backing</b> <b>paper</b> onto old spools. The effective image size will be reduced with this method as the perforations will intrude on the image area. Finally, as with other obsolete film types, 120 film can be cut (with <b>backing</b> <b>paper)</b> and respooled onto 828 spools.|$|E

5000|$|... 35 mm {{cartridges}} {{are generally}} easier to load and unload from a camera than medium-format rolls. A 35 mm cartridge is placed inside a camera, {{and in most}} motorized cameras this {{is all that is}} needed; the camera loads the film, and rewinds it into the cartridge for removal. Far fewer medium-format cameras are motorized, and medium-format roll film does not have sprocket holes, so loading often requires that marking on the <b>backing</b> <b>paper</b> of the film be lined up with markings on the camera, and on unloading, the <b>backing</b> <b>paper</b> must be carefully secured to protect the film from light.|$|E
50|$|Patents on Manual label {{dispensers}} {{go back to}} the 1920s. They are designed for light-duty use. They are operated by hand and are not automated, but still assist in the process of removing labels from their liners. Many manual {{label dispensers}} can dispense multiple rolls at once. Operation is performed by pulling the liner/backing paper around a plate or bar which causes the label to peel away from the <b>backing</b> <b>paper.</b> This happens because the <b>backing</b> <b>paper</b> is usually thinner than the label itself and is also underneath. When the liner is forced around a tight radius the label lifts away and protrudes through the front or top of the dispenser.|$|E

50|$|The first {{self-adhesive}} stamp {{was issued}} by Sierra Leone in 1964, {{and by the}} 1990s these stamps came into wide use. These are inevitably diecut, meaning that the stamps themselves are cut entirely apart, held together only by the <b>backing</b> <b>paper.</b> At first the <b>backing</b> <b>paper</b> was itself solid, but in a repeat of history, is now slightly rouletted so as to facilitate tearing off blocks of stamps without having to remove them from the backing. Since the diecut {{goes all the way}} through the stamp, any shape will work, and the original self-adhesives were straight-edged. However, the tradition of perforation is so strong that more recent self-adhesives have a wavy diecut simulating the perforation. It can be recognized by studying the edge of the stamp closely; true perforations will have torn paper fibers on each tooth, while simulated perforations are smooth.|$|E
50|$|A decal {{typically}} comprises three layers: the color, or image, layer which {{comprises the}} decorative design; the covercoat, a clear protective layer, which may incorporate a low-melting glass; and the <b>backing</b> <b>paper</b> {{on which the}} design is printed by screen printing or lithography.

50|$|Simple {{conservation}} of these fragile materials {{can be carried}} out by the adventurous amateur. A hand-coloured photograph should be removed from the frame, retaining any original screws or nails holding the frame together. Wood panels, acidic cardboard slats, and acidic <b>backing</b> <b>paper</b> can be removed from the frame and mat-board and discarded, retaining any identifying information such as stamps or writing on the <b>backing</b> <b>paper.</b> The mat-board on which the photograph is mounted, even though acidic in nature, cannot be removed and replaced due to the intrinsic value of this original mounting. Often the artist's signature and the title of the photograph are inscribed on the mat-board. The best preservation method to promote limited degradation is to store the photograph in a dry environment with low temperature, low relative humidity, and low light. The hand-coloured photograph should be replaced in its original frame, held in place with archival quality acid-free paper paperboard, and closed with the original nails or screws.|$|E
50|$|The 220 format was {{introduced}} in 1965 and is the same width as 120 film, but with about double the length of film and thus {{twice the number of}} possible exposures per roll. Unlike 120 film, however, there is no <b>backing</b> <b>paper</b> behind the film itself, just a leader and a trailer. This results in a longer film on the same spool, but there are no printed frame numbers. Moreover, it cannot be used in unmodified old cameras that have a red window as frame indicator. Also, since the film alone is thinner than a film with a <b>backing</b> <b>paper,</b> a special pressure plate may be required to achieve optimal focus if the film is registered against its back side. Some cameras capable of using both 120 and 220 film will have a two position adjustment of the pressure plate (e.g. the Pentax 6x7, Mamiya C220 or Mamiya C330) while others will require different film backs e.g. the Pentax 645 or Kowa Six).|$|E
5000|$|Like the 120 format, {{there is}} a {{continuous}} <b>backing</b> <b>paper,</b> and the frame number is visible through a small window {{at the rear of}} the cartridge. Cameras for this type of film are equipped with a large rectangular window in the back door, through which is visible not only the frame number, but also a portion of the label showing the film type and speed. The cartridge has a captive take-up spool, but no supply spool: the film and <b>backing</b> <b>paper</b> are simply coiled tightly and placed in the supply end of the cartridge. The positioning of the image is fixed by the cartridge. The film is 35 mm wide, but unlike 135 film, it is unperforated, except for one registration hole per image, similar to the earlier 828 film. The camera is equipped with a sensing pin which falls into this hole when the film is fully advanced to the next frame, at which point the winding knob or lever is locked, so as to prevent winding past the pre-exposed frame lines.|$|E
