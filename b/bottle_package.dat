40|$|The {{design and}} {{realization}} of softdrink mixer device based on microcontroller AT 89 S 51 has been done. The function device is automatically in softdrink mixing on glass or <b>bottle</b> <b>package.</b> The hardware of this device consists of censor LDR circuit, non inverting comparator, transistor as switch circuit, relay driver, minimum system of microcontroller AT 89 S 51, LCD (Liquid Crystal Display), solenoid valve, keypad, 24 V DC motor, buzzer, and conveyor. The software is assembly program. Based on this circuit, microcontroller as center on automatically softdrink mixer. The function of LDR is light intensity detection and the censor signal will be compare with non inverting comparator. To detect high level, used transistor as switch circuit. Relay circuit used to moved valve solenoid and DC motor. The function of LCD as display system. The keypad as number input of softdrink will doing. Voice indicator {{used to detect}} drink level. The conveyor function as move glass after loaded softdrink in the glass. This device has been realized and it can mixing softdrink.
