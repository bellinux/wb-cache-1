5|$|The avian {{circulatory system}} {{is driven by}} a four-chambered, myogenic heart {{contained}} in a fibrous pericardial sac. This pericardial sac is filled with a serous fluid for lubrication. The heart itself is divided into a right and left half, each with an atrium and ventricle. The atrium and ventricles of each side are separated by atrioventricular valves which prevent <b>back</b> <b>flow</b> from one chamber to the next during contraction. Being myogenic, the heart's pace is maintained by pacemaker cells found in the sinoatrial node, located on the right atrium.|$|E
25|$|The {{coronary}} circulation system provides a blood {{supply to the}} heart muscle itself. The {{coronary circulation}} begins near {{the origin of the}} aorta by two coronary arteries: the right coronary artery and the left coronary artery. After nourishing the heart muscle, blood returns through the coronary veins into the coronary sinus and from this one into the right atrium. <b>Back</b> <b>flow</b> of blood through its opening during atrial systole is prevented by the Thebesian valve. The smallest cardiac veins drain directly into the heart chambers.|$|E
25|$|Acetylene is {{not just}} flammable; in certain {{conditions}} it is explosive. Although it has an upper flammability limit in air of 81%, acetylene's explosive decomposition behaviour makes this irrelevant. If a detonation wave enters the acetylene tank, the tank will be blown apart by the decomposition. Ordinary check valves that normally prevent <b>back</b> <b>flow</b> cannot stop a detonation wave {{because they are not}} capable of closing before the wave passes around the gate. For that reason a flashback arrestor is needed. It is designed to operate before the detonation wave makes it from the hose side to the supply side.|$|E

500|$|Flooding {{along the}} Ohio River, causing <b>back</b> <b>flow</b> {{of the middle}} fork of the Saline River has plagued Harrisburg over the years. The city was flooded in 1883–1884 and again in 1913. The most severe came during the Ohio River flood of 1937 when much of the city, except [...] "Crusoes' Island", a {{downtown}} orbit that encircled the town square, was underwater. High water had reached [...] from the river, and the city was flooded in its position among tributary lowlands. 10,000 out of the 16,000 residents were left stranded on the crowded [...] "island" [...] for weeks, while the other 80% of Harrisburg was completely inundated. By the time the flood waters had receded, 4000 were left homeless. [...] Between Gallatin County and Harrisburg, about [...] of Illinois Route 13 was covered by [...] of water; motorboats navigated the entire distance to rescue marooned families. National guard boats were the means of transportation in the city, and several thousand people were transported daily from temporary island to island. According to the Sanborn Map Company, Harrisburg in October 1925 had a population of 15,000, and in a revised version by January 1937 the population had fallen to 13,000. After that, a levee was erected north and east of the city for protection from future floods. The levee became the unofficial northern and eastern border of the town. No businesses or residences exist in the Saline River Middle Fork floodplains. Flooding reoccurred in January 1982 due to drainage problems from the frozen ground, and in 1983, due to [...] of rain. The Pankey Branch pumping system, {{on the east side}} of town, was built to handle flooding from the Saline River only, and has serious complex watershed technical problems, causing continual water backup within the levee during large rain events. The city rebuilt a new pumping system and requested the Army Corps of Engineers to certify the levee.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cause for}} this [...] is the {{separation}} of the flow from the blade surfaces. This effect {{can be explained by the}} flow over an air foil. When the angle of incidence increases (during the low velocity flow) at the [...] entrance of the air foil, flow pattern changes and separation occurs. This is the first stage of stalling and through this separation point the flow separates leading to the formation of vortices, <b>back</b> <b>flow</b> in the separated region. For a further the explanation of stall and rotating stall, refer to compressor surge. The stall zone for the single axial fan and axial fans operated in parallel are shown in the figure.|$|E
2500|$|Suppose {{the initial}} {{operating}} point D (...) at some rpm N. On decreasing the flow- rate at same rpm along the characteristic curve by partial {{closing of the}} valve, the pressure in the pipe increases which will be taken care by increase in input pressure at the compressor. Further increase in pressure till point P (surge point), compressor pressure will increase. Further moving towards left keeping rpm constant, pressure in pipe will increase but compressor pressure will decrease leading to back air-flow towards the compressor. Due to this <b>back</b> <b>flow,</b> pressure in pipe will decrease because this unequal pressure condition cannot stay {{for a long period}} of time. Though valve position is set for lower flow rate say point G but compressor will work according to normal stable operation point say E, so path E-F-P-G-E will be followed leading to breakdown of flow, hence pressure in the compressor falls further to point H (...) [...] This increase and decrease of pressure in pipe will occur repeatedly in pipe and compressor following the cycle E-F-P-G-H-E also known as the surge cycle.|$|E

2500|$|The first heart sound, or S1, {{forms the}} [...] "lub" [...] of [...] "lub-dub" [...] and is {{composed}} of components M1 (mitral valve closure) and T1 (tricuspid valve closure). Normally M1 precedes T1 slightly. It {{is caused by the}} [...] closure of the atrioventricular valves, i.e. tricuspid and mitral (bicuspid), at the beginning of ventricular contraction, or systole. When the ventricles begin to contract, so do the papillary muscles in each ventricle. The papillary muscles are attached to the cusps or leaflets of the tricuspid and mitral valves via chordae tendineae (heart strings). When the papillary muscles contract, the chordae tendineae become tense and thereby prevent the backflow of blood into the lower pressure environment of the atria. The chordae tendineae act a bit like the strings on a parachute, and allow the leaflets of the valve to balloon up into the atria slightly, but not so much as to evert the cusp edges and allow <b>back</b> <b>flow</b> of blood. It is the pressure created from ventricular contraction that closes the valve, not the papillary muscles themselves. The contraction of the ventricle begins just prior to AV valves closing and prior to the semilunar valves opening. The sudden tensing of the chordae tendineae and the squeezing of the ventricles against closed semilunar valves, sends blood rushing back toward the atria, and the parachute-like valves catch the rush of blood in their leaflets causing the valve to snap shut. The S1 sound results from reverberation within the blood associated with the sudden block of flow reversal by the valves. The delay of T1 even more than normally causes the split S1 which is heard in a right bundle branch blockage.|$|E
50|$|Internal {{compression}} {{refers to}} the compression of air within the supercharger itself, which, already at or close to boost level, can be delivered smoothly to the engine {{with little or no}} <b>back</b> <b>flow.</b> This is more effective than <b>back</b> <b>flow</b> compression and allows higher efficiency to be achieved. Internal compression devices usually use a fixed internal compression ratio. When the boost pressure is equal to the compression pressure of the supercharger, the <b>back</b> <b>flow</b> is zero. If the boost pressure exceeds that compression pressure, <b>back</b> <b>flow</b> can still occur as in a roots blower. Internal compression blowers must be matched to the expected boost pressure in order to achieve the higher efficiency they are capable of, otherwise they will suffer the same problems and low efficiency of the roots blowers.|$|E
