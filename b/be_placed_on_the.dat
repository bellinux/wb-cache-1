5|$|The Baronetage Committee was {{established}} by a 1910 Order in Council, during Edward VII's reign, to scrutinise all succession claims (and thus reject doubtful ones) to <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Roll of Baronets.|$|E
5|$|Less {{than two}} weeks later, on 2 December, Admiral Hipper {{submitted}} his request to <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> inactive list. He retired on 13 December with a full pension; {{at the age of}} 55, Hipper spent almost 37 years on active duty in the Imperial Navy. The German fleet in Scapa Flow, meanwhile, was scuttled by its crew on 21 June 1919.|$|E
5000|$|In the beginning, <b>the</b> 2 tigers <b>are</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> middle column. Specifically, one tiger <b>is</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{second point}} {{from the top}} of the middle column, and <b>the</b> other tiger <b>is</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fourth point. <b>The</b> goats <b>are</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second left most column and second right most column. <b>The</b> goats <b>are</b> {{specifically}} <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first point and third point of each column from the top. Therefore, there are four points <b>on</b> <b>the</b> board that all the 20 goats <b>are</b> <b>placed</b> upon initially, and each of the four points has 5 goats each.|$|R

50|$|At {{the start}} of the game all four tigers <b>are</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> four corners of the grid, facing the center. No goats <b>are</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> board during the initial setup.|$|R
5|$|One of the adaptations made to Palladianism in America {{was that}} the piano nobile now tended to <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground floor, rather than above a service floor, as was the {{tradition}} in Europe. This service floor, if it existed at all, was now a discreet semi-basement. This negated {{the need for an}} ornate external staircase leading to the main entrance as in the more original Palladian designs. This would also be a feature of the neoclassical style that followed Palladianism.|$|E
5|$|Relationships with {{tribes to}} retain Native {{names have been}} {{established}} {{at the high school}} level. Arapahoe High School (Centennial, Colorado) now uses a logo provided by the Arapaho Tribe of Wyoming, which initially included an agreement that the image would not <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> gym floor or any article of clothing. The latter provision has not always been observed, but the logo does not appear on the team uniforms. The agreement also includes tribal participation in school events.|$|E
5|$|The Mk. XIV {{consisted}} of two independent parts, the sighting head and the computor. The sighting head was located in the bomb aimer's window {{at the front of}} the aircraft. The separate computor cabinet was assembled with the operating knobs positioned on the right side of the case, so it had to <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left side of the fuselage. The two were connected via two flexible cable drives.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the start}} of the game, each player chooses two objects from a list {{provided}} and creates plasticine sculptures of each, and places them {{in the middle of the}} board. Each player <b>places</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> board three tokens: a magician, a witches' hat and an Elfstone. <b>The</b> hats <b>are</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> scoring track; <b>the</b> elfstones <b>are</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> elfstone track, and <b>the</b> magicians <b>are</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> space marked [...] "A".

5|$|Around 1497, while {{continuing}} {{with his work}} on the Caesars, Cairano also developed five keystones for portico of the Loggia palazzo, representing Sant'Apollonio, San Faustino, San Giovita, Justice and Faith. Between 1499 and 1500, he delivered two large trophies to <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top order of palazzo, while between 1493 and 1505, Cairano participated in the fulfilment of leonine protome, capitals, and candelabras and friezes for the same top order. The attention of the artist to his craft and productions is evident, and it influenced in general all the decorative sculptural works made for the palazzo at the time.|$|E
5|$|During the eight-month period, Beyoncé {{recorded}} over seventy {{songs and}} decided during the editing process {{that she did}} not want to reconcile the two approaches into one disc. If a song was meaningless to her, she cut them off during the process of elimination for the final track listing. After a process of elimination, twelve tracks were selected to <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> standard edition of the album, while five additional tracks were chosen to make the final cut for the deluxe edition of the album. Beyoncé later revealed that songs from established producers like The Neptunes and Danja were not able to make the final cut.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, {{the group}} E Clampus Vitus {{commissioned}} and dedicated a plaque commemorating Emperor Norton's {{call for the}} construction of a suspension bridge between San Francisco and Oakland, via Yerba Buena Island (formerly Goat Island). The group's intention was that the plaque <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> newly opened San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge itself. This was not approved by the bridge authorities, however; and, sometime shortly after World War II, the plaque was installed at the Cliff House. In the 1990s, the plaque was moved to the Transbay Terminal. When the Terminal was closed and demolished in 2010, as part of the project to construct a new Transbay Transit Center, the plaque was placed in storage, where it remains.|$|E

50|$|In the beginning, {{the hare}} <b>is</b> <b>placed</b> {{at the central}} point of the board (at {{position}} c3). Ten hunters <b>are</b> <b>place</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first two ranks of {{one side of the}} board (row 1 and 2). If twelve hunters are used, the remaining two hunters <b>are</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> third rank's outermost points (at positions a3 and e3). If eleven hunters are used, it is unknown where the remaining one hunter <b>is</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> third rank.|$|R
5|$|In Polish heraldry, the {{tincture}} of {{the charge}} has priority {{in relation to the}} tincture of the field. In the case of Polish national colors, white, the color of the White Eagle, should always be placed in a more honorable position than red, the color of the field of the Polish coat of arms. In the most usual, horizontal alignment, this means that the white stripe is placed above the red one. If the alignment is vertical, the white stripe should be on the left from the onlooker's point of view. If the flag is hung vertically above a street, the white stripe should <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left when looking in the direction of increasing house numbers. If it drapes a coffin, the white stripe should be placed over the heart.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter left Egypt on 22 November 1916 and {{returned}} to the United Kingdom, where she was paid off at Devonport to provide crews for antisubmarine vessels. She remained at Devonport until April 1919, in commission as a special service vessel and auxiliary patrol ship until February 1918, when she was again paid off. After that she became an accommodation ship. In April 1919, Jupiter became the first Majestic-class ship to <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> disposal list. She was sold for scrapping on 15 January 1920, and on 11 March 1920 was towed from Chatham to Blyth to be scrapped.|$|E
5|$|Once the badnjak has burnt through, the thicker end {{is often}} {{taken out of}} the fire and used {{according}} to the local custom. It may be carried around the beehives, extinguished, and placed between the branches of a young plum or apple tree. The men may make crosses from it and put them under the eaves, on the fields, meadows, vineyards, and apiaries, so that the coming year may be happy and fruitful. It may also be set aside for next Christmas Eve, to <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fire immediately before the new badnjak, as a symbol of continuity. In Kosovo, a part of the badnjak is preserved and burned again on New Years Day and Epiphany.|$|E

5|$|Ross won the {{election}} with a large majority. Shortly after his arrival in Austin, his youngest son died. Ross returned home for a week to attend the funeral and help care for another son who was seriously ill. On returning to the state capital, {{he was assigned to}} the committees for Educational Affairs, Internal Improvements, Finance, Penitentiaries, Military Affairs (where he served as chairman), State Affairs, Contingent Expenses, Stock and Stock Raising, Agricultural Affairs, and Enrolled Bills. Ross introduced a petition on behalf of 500 citizens of McLennan County, requesting a prohibition amendment to <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> next statewide ballot; the legislature did agree to place this on the next ballot.|$|E
5|$|Standard {{planetary}} models {{suggest that}} the interior of Saturn {{is similar to that}} of Jupiter, having a small rocky core surrounded by hydrogen and helium with trace amounts of various volatiles. This core is similar in composition to the Earth, but more dense. Examination of Saturn's gravitational moment, in combination with physical models of the interior, has allowed constraints to <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mass of Saturn's core. In 2004, scientists estimated that the core must be 9–22 times the mass of the Earth, which corresponds to a diameter of about 25,000km. This is surrounded by a thicker liquid metallic hydrogen layer, followed by a liquid layer of helium-saturated molecular hydrogen that gradually transitions to a gas with increasing altitude. The outermost layer spans 1,000km and consists of gas.|$|E
5|$|Thio Li-ann has {{opined that}} the 1989 {{measures}} taken to limit judicial checks on executive power demonstrate {{a preference for}} non-legal institutional checks. One example of a non-legal institutional check is the requirement under the Constitution and the ISA for an advisory board to hear detainees' representations and recommend to the President whether a detention order should be terminated. Thio argues that such checks are weak and cannot replace judicial review. She contends that since Article149 of the Constitution permits the enactment of repressive laws which contravene constitutional liberties, meaningful restraints should <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wide discretionary powers under the ISA. Similarly, in Chng Suan Tze, the Court of Appeal rejected {{the view that the}} executive's accountability to Parliament is a sufficient safeguard against the arbitrary exercise of power.|$|E

5|$|Three albums {{have been}} released: the promotional Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII Pre Soundtrack in July 2013, the Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII Original Soundtrack in November 2013, and Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII Soundtrack Plus in March 2014. The music has {{received}} a mostly positive response from reviewers. The main soundtrack, despite some tracks being critiqued, was generally praised as a good selection of music and a fitting conclusion {{to the music of}} the Final Fantasy XIII series. It was also praised by reviewers of the game as a whole. The Soundtrack Plus album was reviewed less favorably. Both commercial albums sold well enough to <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Oricon charts, with the Original Soundtrack reaching #29 and remaining on the charts for four weeks.|$|E
5|$|Track {{and field}} events {{are divided into}} three broad categories: track events, field events, and {{combined}} events. The majority of athletes tend to specialise in just one event (or event type) {{with the aim of}} perfecting their performances, although the aim of combined events athletes is to become proficient in a number of disciplines. Track events involve running on a track over a specified distances and—in the case of the hurdling and steeplechase events—obstacles may <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> track. There are also relay races in which teams of athletes run and pass on a baton to their team member {{at the end of a}} certain distance.|$|E
5|$|Whenever {{the flag}} is {{displayed}} indoors in halls at public meetings or gatherings of any kind, it {{should always be}} on the right (observers' left), as this is the position of authority. So when the flag is displayed next to a speaker in the hall or other meeting place, it must <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> speaker's right hand. When it is displayed elsewhere in the hall, it should be {{to the right of the}} audience. The flag should be displayed completely spread out with the saffron stripe on top. If hung vertically on the wall behind the podium, the saffron stripe should be to the left of the onlookers facing the flag with the hoist cord at the top.|$|E
