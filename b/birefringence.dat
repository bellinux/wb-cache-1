5|$|Lipid bilayers exhibit {{high levels}} of <b>birefringence</b> where the {{refractive}} index in {{the plane of the}} bilayer differs from that perpendicular by as much as 0.1 refractive index units. This has been used to characterise the degree of order and disruption in bilayers using dual polarisation interferometry to understand mechanisms of protein interaction.|$|E
5|$|Vanadinite {{is usually}} bright-red or orange-red in colour, {{although}} sometimes brown, red-brown, grey, yellow, or colourless. Its distinctive colour makes it popular among mineral collectors. Its streak {{can be either}} pale yellow or brownish-yellow. Vanadinite may be transparent, translucent or opaque, and its lustre can range from resinous to adamantine. Vanadinite is anisotropic, meaning that some of its properties differ when measured along different axes. When measured perpendicular and parallel to its axis of anisotropy, its refractive indices are 2.350 and 2.416 respectively. This gives it a <b>birefringence</b> of 0.066.|$|E
5|$|Einstein {{was troubled}} {{by the fact that}} his theory seemed incomplete, since it did not {{determine}} the direction of a spontaneously emitted photon. A probabilistic nature of light-particle motion was first considered by Newton in his treatment of <b>birefringence</b> and, more generally, of the splitting of light beams at interfaces into a transmitted beam and a reflected beam. Newton hypothesized that hidden variables in the light particle determined which of the two paths a single photon would take. Similarly, Einstein hoped for a more complete theory that would leave nothing to chance, beginning his separation from quantum mechanics. Ironically, Max Born's probabilistic interpretation of the wave function was inspired by Einstein's later work searching for a more complete theory.|$|E
5|$|In most {{theories}} up to {{the eighteenth}} century, light was pictured as being made up of particles. Since particle models cannot easily account for the refraction, diffraction and <b>birefringence</b> of light, wave theories of light were proposed by René Descartes (1637), Robert Hooke (1665), and Christiaan Huygens (1678); however, particle models remained dominant, chiefly due {{to the influence of}} Isaac Newton. In the early nineteenth century, Thomas Young and August Fresnel clearly demonstrated the interference and diffraction of light and by 1850 wave models were generally accepted. In 1865, James Clerk Maxwell's prediction that light was an electromagnetic wave—which was confirmed experimentally in 1888 by Heinrich Hertz's detection of radio waves—seemed to be the final blow to particle models of light.|$|E
5|$|Liquid {{crystals}} (LCs) are {{matter in}} a state which has properties between those of conventional liquids and those of solid crystals. For instance, a liquid crystal may flow like a liquid, but its molecules may be oriented in a crystal-like way. There are {{many different types of}} liquid-crystal phases, which can be distinguished by their different optical properties (such as <b>birefringence).</b> When viewed under a microscope using a polarized light source, different liquid crystal phases will appear to have distinct textures. The contrasting areas in the textures correspond to domains where the liquid-crystal molecules are oriented in different directions. Within a domain, however, the molecules are well ordered. LC materials may not always be in a liquid-crystal phase (just as water may turn into ice or steam).|$|E
25|$|<b>Birefringence</b> {{characteristics}} in sperm heads allow {{the selection of}} spermatozoa for intracytoplasmic sperm injection. Likewise, zona imaging uses <b>birefringence</b> on oocytes to select the ones with highest chances of successful pregnancy. <b>Birefringence</b> of particles biopsied from pulmonary nodules indicates silicosis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Birefringence</b> {{is used in}} many optical devices. Liquid-crystal displays, {{the most}} common sort of flat panel display, cause their pixels to become lighter or darker through {{rotation}} of the polarization (circular <b>birefringence)</b> of linearly polarized light as viewed through a sheet polarizer at the screen's surface. Similarly, light modulators modulate the intensity of light through electrically induced <b>birefringence</b> of polarized light followed by a polarizer. The Lyot filter is a specialized narrowband spectral filter employing the wavelength dependence of <b>birefringence.</b> Wave plates are thin birefringent sheets widely used in certain optical equipment for modifying the polarization state of light passing through it.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to anisotropy {{in the electric}} polarizability (electric susceptibility), anisotropy in the magnetic polarizability (magnetic permeability) can also cause <b>birefringence.</b> However, at optical frequencies, values of magnetic permeability for natural materials are not measurably different from µ0, {{so this is not}} a source of optical <b>birefringence</b> in practice.|$|E
25|$|<b>Birefringence</b> {{and other}} polarization-based optical effects (such as optical {{rotation}} and linear or circular dichroism) {{can be measured}} by measuring {{the changes in the}} polarization of light passing through the material. These measurements are known as polarimetry. Polarized light microscopes, which contain two polarizers that are at 90° to each other {{on either side of the}} sample, are used to visualize <b>birefringence.</b> The addition of quarter-wave plates permit examination of circularly polarized light. <b>Birefringence</b> measurements have been made with phase-modulated systems for examining the transient flow behavior of fluids.|$|E
25|$|Uniaxial <b>birefringence</b> is {{classified}} as positive when the extraordinary index of refraction ne {{is greater than the}} ordinary index no. Negative <b>birefringence</b> means that Δn = ne − no is less than zero. In other words, the polarization of the fast (or slow) wave is perpendicular to the optic axis when the <b>birefringence</b> of the crystal is positive (or negative, respectively). In the case of biaxial crystals, all three of the principal axes have different refractive indices, so this designation does not apply. But for any defined ray direction one can just as well designate the fast and slow ray polarizations.|$|E
25|$|<b>Birefringence</b> is {{utilized}} in medical diagnostics. One powerful accessory used with optical microscopes {{is a pair}} of crossed polarizing filters. Light from the source is polarized in the X direction after passing through the first polarizer, but above the specimen is a polarizer (a so-called analyzer) oriented in the Y direction. Therefore, no light from the source will be accepted by the analyzer, and the field will appear dark. However areas of the sample possessing <b>birefringence</b> will generally couple some of the X-polarized light into the Y polarization; these areas will then appear bright against the dark background. Modifications to this basic principle can differentiate between positive and negative <b>birefringence.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Birefringence</b> {{is widely}} used in {{mineralogy}} to identify rocks, minerals, and gemstones.|$|E
25|$|We {{have seen}} (above) that the <b>birefringence</b> {{of a type}} of crystal is useful in {{identifying}} it, and thus detection of linear <b>birefringence</b> is especially useful in geology and mineralogy. Linearly polarized light generally has its polarization state altered upon transmission through such a crystal, making it stand out when viewed in between two crossed polarizers, {{as seen in the}} photograph, above. Likewise, in chemistry, rotation of polarization axes in a liquid solution can be a useful measurement. In a liquid, linear <b>birefringence</b> is impossible, however there may be circular <b>birefringence</b> when a chiral molecule is in solution. When the right and left handed enantiomers of such a molecule are present in equal numbers (a so-called racemic mixture) then their effects cancel out. However, when there is only one (or a preponderance of one), as is more often the case for organic molecules, a net circular <b>birefringence</b> (or optical activity) is observed, revealing the magnitude of that imbalance (or the concentration of the molecule itself, when it can be assumed that only one enantiomer is present). This is measured using a polarimeter in which polarized light is passed through a tube of the liquid, {{at the end of which}} is another polarizer which is rotated in order to null the transmission of light through it.|$|E
25|$|In ophthalmology, {{binocular}} retinal <b>birefringence</b> {{screening of}} the Henle fibers (photoreceptor axons that go radially outward from the fovea) provides a reliable detection of strabismus and possibly also of anisometropic amblyopia. Furthermore, scanning laser polarimetry utilises the <b>birefringence</b> of the optic nerve fibre layer to indirectly quantify its thickness, which is of use in the assessment and monitoring of glaucoma.|$|E
25|$|Inevitable {{manufacturing}} imperfections in {{optical fiber}} leads to <b>birefringence,</b> {{which is one}} cause of pulse broadening in fiber-optic communications. Such imperfections can be geometrical (lack of circular symmetry), due to stress applied to the optical fiber and/or due to bending of the fiber. <b>Birefringence</b> is intentionally introduced (for instance, by making the cross-section elliptical) {{in order to produce}} polarization-maintaining optical fibers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Birefringence</b> is {{the optical}} {{property}} of a material having a refractive index {{that depends on}} the polarization and propagation direction of light. These optically anisotropic materials are said to be birefringent (or birefractive). The <b>birefringence</b> is often quantified as the maximum difference between refractive indices exhibited by the material. Crystals with non-cubic crystal structures are often birefringent, as are plastics under mechanical stress.|$|E
25|$|More {{recent studies}} have not found any {{evidence}} for this effect (see section on <b>Birefringence).</b>|$|E
25|$|For instance, needle {{aspiration}} {{of fluid}} from a gouty joint will reveal negatively birefringent monosodium urate crystals. Calcium pyrophosphate crystals, in contrast, show weak positive <b>birefringence.</b> Urate crystals appear yellow, and calcium pyrophosphate crystals appear blue when their long axes are aligned parallel {{to that of}} a red compensator filter, or a crystal of known <b>birefringence</b> is added to the sample for comparison.|$|E
25|$|In {{an ideal}} doped fiber without <b>birefringence,</b> the PDG would be inconveniently large. Fortunately, in optical fibers {{small amounts of}} <b>birefringence</b> are always present and, furthermore, the fast and slow axes vary {{randomly}} along the fiber length. A typical DFA has several tens of meters, long enough to already show this randomness of the <b>birefringence</b> axes. These two combined effects (which in transmission fibers give rise to polarization mode dispersion) produce a misalignment of the relative polarizations of the signal and pump lasers along the fiber, thus tending to average out the PDG. The result is that PDG {{is very difficult to}} observe in a single amplifier (but is noticeable in links with several cascaded amplifiers).|$|E
25|$|<b>Birefringence</b> can be {{observed}} in amyloid plaques such as are found in the brains of Alzheimer's patients when stained with a dye such as Congo Red. Modified proteins such as immunoglobulin light chains abnormally accumulate between cells, forming fibrils. Multiple folds of these fibers line up and take on a beta-pleated sheet conformation. Congo red dye intercalates between the folds and, when observed under polarized light, causes <b>birefringence.</b>|$|E
25|$|Circular <b>birefringence</b> in liquids {{where there}} is an enantiomeric excess in a {{solution}} containing a molecule which has stereo isomers.|$|E
25|$|The Jones matrix due to {{passage through}} a {{transparent}} material {{is dependent on}} the propagation distance as well as the <b>birefringence.</b> The <b>birefringence</b> (as well as the average refractive index) will generally be dispersive, that is, it will vary as a function of optical frequency (wavelength). In the case of non-birefringent materials, however, the 2×2 Jones matrix is the identity matrix (multiplied by a scalar phase factor and attenuation factor), implying no change in polarization during propagation.|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} <b>birefringence</b> in shear waves {{traveling}} through the solid Earth (the Earth's liquid core does not support shear waves) is widely used in seismology.|$|E
25|$|<b>Birefringence</b> is {{observed}} in anisotropic elastic materials. In these materials, the two polarizations split {{according to their}} effective refractive indices, which are also sensitive to stress.|$|E
25|$|The Experiments of Rayleigh and Brace (1902, 1904) {{showed that}} length {{contraction}} doesn't lead to <b>birefringence</b> for a co-moving observer, {{in accordance with}} the relativity principle.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{equally as}} {{important}} is optic character. Diamond and other cubic (and also amorphous) materials are isotropic, meaning that light entering a stone behaves {{the same way}} regardless of direction. Conversely, most minerals are anisotropic, which produces <b>birefringence,</b> or double refraction of light entering the material in all directions other than an optic axis (a direction of single refraction in a doubly refractive material). Under low magnification, this <b>birefringence</b> is usually detectable as a visual doubling of a cut gemstone's rear facets or internal flaws. An effective diamond simulant should therefore be isotropic.|$|E
25|$|Some {{sapphire}}-glass {{windows are}} made from pure sapphire boules that have been grown in a specific crystal orientation, typically along the optical axis, the c-axis, for minimum <b>birefringence</b> for the application.|$|E
25|$|Stress <b>birefringence</b> {{results when}} {{isotropic}} materials are stressed or deformed (i.e., stretched or bent) causing {{a loss of}} physical isotropy and consequently a loss of isotropy in the material's permittivity tensor.|$|E
25|$|Astronomical {{tests are}} {{conducted}} {{in connection with}} the flight time of photons, where Lorentz violating factors could cause anomalous dispersion and <b>birefringence</b> leading to a dependency of photons on energy, frequency or polarization.|$|E
25|$|<b>Birefringence</b> of lipid bilayers can be {{measured}} using dual polarization interferometry. This provides {{a measure of the}} degree of order within these fluid layers and how this order is disrupted when the layer interacts with other biomolecules.|$|E
25|$|Not all {{crystals}} {{have all}} of these properties. Conversely, these properties are not quite exclusive to crystals. They can appear in glasses or polycrystals that have been made anisotropic by working or stress—for example, stress-induced <b>birefringence.</b>|$|E
25|$|Media {{in which}} {{transmission}} of one polarization mode is preferentially reduced are called dichroic or diattenuating. Like <b>birefringence,</b> diattenuation {{can be with}} respect to linear polarization modes (in a crystal) or circular polarization modes (usually in a liquid).|$|E
25|$|Moreover, {{one can use}} as basis {{functions}} any pair of {{orthogonal polarization}} states, not just linear polarizations. For instance, choosing right and left circular polarizations as basis functions simplifies the solution of problems involving circular <b>birefringence</b> (optical activity) or circular dichroism.|$|E
25|$|Form <b>birefringence,</b> whereby {{structure}} {{elements such}} as rods, having one refractive index, are suspended in a medium with a different refractive index. When the lattice spacing is much smaller than a wavelength, such a structure {{is described as a}} metamaterial.|$|E
25|$|The {{property}} of (linear) <b>birefringence</b> is widespread in crystalline minerals, and indeed was pivotal {{in the initial}} discovery of polarization. In mineralogy, this property is frequently exploited using polarization microscopes, {{for the purpose of}} identifying minerals. See optical mineralogy for more details.|$|E
25|$|Huygens had experimented in 1672 {{with double}} {{refraction}} (<b>birefringence)</b> in Icelandic spar (calcite), a phenomenon discovered in 1669 by Rasmus Bartholin. At first {{he could not}} elucidate what he found. He later explained it with his wave front theory and concept of evolutes. He also developed ideas on caustics. Newton in his Opticks of 1704 proposed instead a corpuscular theory of light. The theory of Huygens was not accepted, by some, because longitudinal waves cannot show <b>birefringence.</b> The interference experiments of Thomas Young vindicated a wave theory in 1801: the results could not be explained with light particles. The {{solution to the problem}} Huygens had faced was then resolved by a transverse wave theory. For a view from modern physics see wave–particle duality.|$|E
