40|$|Densely {{deployed}} {{small cell}} networks {{will address the}} growing demand for broadband mobile connectivity, by increasing access network capacity and coverage. However, most potential small cell base station (SCBS) locations do not have existing telecommunication infrastructure. Providing backhaul connectivity to core networks is therefore a challenge. Millimeter wave (mmW) technologies operated at 30 - 90 GHz are currently being considered to provide low-cost, flexible, high-capacity and reliable backhaul solutions using existing roof-mounted backhaul aggregation sites. Using intelligent mmW radio devices and massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), for enabling point-to-multipoint (PtMP) operation, is considered in this research. The core aim {{of this research is}} to develop an architecture of an intelligent non-line-sight (NLOS) small cell backhaul (SCB) system based on mmW and massive MIMO technologies, and supporting intelligent algorithms to facilitate reliable NLOS street-to-rooftop NLOS SCB connectivity. In the proposed architecture, diffraction points are used as signal anchor points between <b>backhaul</b> <b>radio</b> devices. In the new architecture the integration of these technologies is considered. This involves the design of efficient artificial intelligence algorithms to enable <b>backhaul</b> <b>radio</b> devices to autonomously select suitable NLOS propagation paths, find an optimal number of links that meet the backhaul performance requirements and determine an optimal number of diffractions points capable of covering predetermined SCB locations. Throughout the thesis, a number of algorithms are developed and simulated using the MATLAB application. This thesis mainly investigates three key issues: First, a novel intelligent NLOS SCB architecture, termed the cognitive NLOS SCB (CNSCB) system is proposed to enable street-to-rooftop NLOS connectivity using predetermined diffraction points located on roof edges. Second, an algorithm to enable the autonomous creation of multiple-paths, evaluate the performance of each link and determine an optimal number of possible paths per backhaul link is developed. Third, an algorithm to determine the optimal number of diffraction points that can cover an identified SCBS location is also developed. Also, another investigated issue related to the operation of the proposed architecture is its energy efficiency, and its performance is compared to that of a point-to-point (PtP) architecture. The proposed solutions were examined using analytical models, simulations and experimental work to determine the strength of the street-to-rooftop backhaul links and their ability to meet current and future SCB requirements. The results obtained showed that reliable multiple NLOS links can be achieved using device intelligence to guide radio signals along the propagation path. Furthermore, the PtMP architecture is found to be more energy efficient than the PtP architecture. The proposed architecture and algorithms offer a novel backhaul solution for outdoor urban small cells. Finally, this research shows that traditional techniques of addressing the demand for connectivity, which consisted of improving or evolving existing solutions, may nolonger be applicable in emerging communication technologies. There is therefore need to consider new ways of solving the emerging challenges...|$|E
40|$|In this invited {{presentation}} I {{describe how}} we prepare for 5 G in my research division. The background {{is that we}} have contributed to 3 G and 4 G developments with two commercial successes: The hat-fed reflector antenna for <b>backhaul</b> <b>radio</b> links, and Bluetest reverberation chambers for OTA (Oer-The-Air) characterization of devices with MIMO and OFDM. 5 G means Gbit/s data rates, for which higher frequencies are needed towards the user terminal, may be up to 30 or 60 GHz. This means that the multipath will be weaker as it gradually diminishes when frequency increases. Therefore, we prepare by introducing a Random-LOS (RLOS) complement to the OTA testing in Rich Isotropic Multipath (RIMP) being provided by Bluetest's reverberation chambers. Further, high gain steerable beams will be needed, requiring new planar packaging solutions for closer integration of antennas and RF chipsets. Therefore, we prepare by research on gap waveguides. Massive MIMO have many technological uncertainties, so others also consider old-fashioned phased arrays, but they will not work in RIMP. The best hardware can only be chosen if we know how to characterize the system performance. The radiation pattern and realized gain cannot be used directly for this purpose due to all the statistical variations caused by the arbitrariness of the user. Therefore, we introduce instead the Probability of Detection (PoD) as a quality metric. This will be different for each desired number of bitstreams. Further, we quantify the difference between different PoD curves in dBiid in RIMP, i. e. in dB relative to the i. i. d. (idependent identically distributed) case, and in dBt in RLOS, i. e. in dB relative to an ideal polarization- and coverage- matched threshold receiver.

40|$|The {{mobile data}} rates {{and number of}} devices are {{constantly}} increasing, creating new challenges for the network operators to increase the cell and area capacities of the mobile networks. For LTE-A and future 5 G networks, one well-known solution to improve the capacity and coverage is network densification i. e. introduction of more and smaller cells in the network. As these small cells are typically located in cities and other urban areas, adoption of unconventional installation sites such as lamp posts and building walls is needed. Thus, the provisioning of the conventional wired backhaul might not be feasible. Potential solutions for the small cell wireless backhaul are technologies utilizing millimeter wave (mmW) frequencies, which can provide several gigahertz of spectrum. Typically, frequencies between 60 - 80 GHz are used for backhauling applications. The adoption of the mmW frequencies calls for narrow antenna beams, less than a few degrees, {{to compensate for the}} high path losses and other attenuation sources at these frequencies. Such narrow-beam radio links also need vibration compensation mechanisms to mitigate the effect of the sways and twists of the installation structures caused by wind. Therefore, electrical beam steering capability is needed to control the direction of the antenna beam quickly during link operation. The main scope of this thesis work is related to architecture studies and hardware development for a proof of a concept for an mmW beam steerable <b>backhaul</b> <b>radio</b> for small cells, which can support multi-gigabit data rates. This work has been carried out as a part of Nokia Bell Labs 5 G mmW Backhaul proof of concept (PoC) project.

The deployment of a very dense network based on small cells connected through a heterogeneous backhaul is a realistic way of achieving a high throughput in a mobile network. But, the non-ideal characteristics of this backhaul and the blurring borders between access and the backhaul networks require a joint design of both, involving the three lower OSI layers.

Regarding the MAC layer, we pay special attention to partly distributed algorithms operating on smaller time-scales that take into account backhaul constraints and inter-cell interference. Finally, in the network layer we propose the use of cooperative routing schemes that optimize the cell load distribution and admission and congestion control algorithms that use access and backhaul information. Based on these approaches, a joint design of access and backhaul network can be effectively carried out, in order to enable the deployment of small-cells and heterogeneous backhaul...|$|R

The details of 5 G {{are the subject of}} ongoing research and debate, mostly focused on understanding how radio technologies can enable the 5 G vision [2][3]. 5 G will need to offer not only higher peak-rates per subscriber, but also handle a larger number of simultaneously connected devices, to provide better coverage and to offer highly reliable communications with low outage probability and latency. 5 G must also achieve the above objectives at a similar cost and energy consumption as todayâ€™s networks [4][5].

However, the current control plane of cellular networks neither is designed to support this increased control traffic nor provides mechanisms to quickly accommodate new signaling messages [8].

30|$|Massive network {{densification}} and heterogeneity are {{two major}} trends heralding the fifth generation of mobile cellular networks (5). Heterogeneous networks are commonly identified as systems comprising multiple types of base stations (BS) that are distinguished by their transmit power and <b>backhaul</b> and <b>radio</b> access technology {{as well as the}} experienced propagation conditions. In such topologies, the aggregate co-channel interference from other cells (also referred to as other-cell interference, external interference, network interference, or simply interference) {{is one of the main}} performance limiting factors [1 â€“ 7]. At the same time, it forms the basis for determining the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) and the other-cell interference factor (OCIF), which constitute fundamental metrics for assessing the performance of mobile networks. The SIR commonly refers to the ratio between the desired signal power and the total interference power [1, 3]. In contrast, the OCIF (also termed f-factor or interference factor) is traditionally defined as the ratio of the other-cell interference to the own-cell interference (also denoted as same-cell or inner-cell interference) [8 â€“ 11]. Own-cell interference arises, e.g., as multiple access interference due to cross correlation of spread-spectrum signals in a code-division multiple access (CDMA) system [8]. In more recent work, the OCIF is defined as the ratio of the other-cell received power to the total inner-cell received power, encompassing both the desired signal as well as the own-cell interference [5 â€“ 7, 12, 13]. This definition is still valid for mobile systems without own-cell interference, such as orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) [6, 14]. Therefore, the thorough statistical description of aggregate co-channel interference from other cells is essential for system analysis and design. The main goal of the interference analysis is to capture key characteristics of the interference as a function of relatively few parameters. Although abstractions such as the Wyner model and the hexagonal grid first appeared two or even five decades ago [15, 16], mathematically tractable interference statistics are still the exception rather than the rule.|$|R

40|$|International audienceâ€”In this paper, {{we address}} the caching problem in small cell {{networks}} from a game theoretic point of view. In particular, we formulate the caching problem as a many-to-many matching game between small base stations and service providers' servers. The servers store {{a set of}} videos and aim to cache these videos at the small base stations {{in order to reduce}} the experienced delay by the end-users. On the other hand, small base stations cache the videos according to their local popularity, so as to reduce the load on the backhaul links. We propose a new matching algorithm for the many-to-many problem and prove that it reaches a pairwise stable outcome. Simulation results show that the number of satisfied requests by the small base stations in the proposed caching algorithm can reach up to three times the satisfaction of a random caching policy. Moreover, the expected download time of all the videos can be reduced significantly. I. INTRODUCTION During the last decade, the rapid proliferation of smart-phones coupled with the rising popularity of Online Social Networks (OSNs) have led to an exponential growth of mobile video traffic [1]. Meanwhile, existing wireless networks have already reached their capacity limits, especially during peak hours [2]. In order to ensure acceptable Quality of Experience (QoE) for the end-users, the next generation of wireless net-works will consist of a very dense deployment of low-cost and low-power small base stations (SBSs) [3]. The SBSs provide a cost-effective way to offload traffic from the main macro-cellular networks. However, the prospective performance gains expected from SBS deployment will be limited by capacity-limited and possibly heterogeneous backhaul links that connect the SBSs to the core network [3]. Indeed, the solution of deploying high speed fiber-optic backhaul is too expensive and thus, the use of DSL backhaul connections need to be considered [4]. Distributed caching at the network edge is considered as a promising solution to deal with the backhaul bottleneck [5], [6]. The basic idea is to duplicate and store the data at the SBSs side. Consequently, users' requests can be served locally, from the closest SBSs without using the backhaul links, when possible. In prior works, the cache placement problem has been mainly addressed for wired networks, especially for Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) [7]â€“[10]. However, the CDNs topology is different from the small cell networks topology since the CDNs' caching servers are part of the core network while the SBSs are connected to the core network and the User Equipments (UE) via <b>backhaul</b> and <b>radio</b> links, respectively.

The aim of this novel backhauling approach is to combine carrier-grade network performance with reduced maintenance effort as well as independent and self-sufficient power supply. In order to facilitate the success prospects of this concept, the thesis comprises the following major contributions: Formal, multi-domain system model and evaluation methodology First, adapted from the theory of cyber-physical systems, the author devises a multi-domain evaluation methodology and a system-level simulation framework for energy-autarkic coordinated WBNs, including a novel balanced scorecard concept. Second, the thesis specifically addresses the topic of Topology Control (TC) in point-to-point radio networks {{and how it can}} be exploited for network management purposes. Given a set of network nodes equipped with multiple radio transceivers and known locations, TC continuously optimizes the setup and configuration of radio links between network nodes, thus supporting initial network deployment, network operation, as well as topology re-configuration. In particular, the author shows that TC in WBNs belongs to the class of NP-hard quadratic assignment problems and that it has significant impact in operational practice, e. g., on routing efficiency, network redundancy levels, service reliability, and energy consumption. Two novel algorithms focusing on maximizing edge connectivity of network graphs are developed. Finally, this work carries out an analytical benchmarking and a numerical performance analysis of the introduced concepts and algorithms. The author analytically derives minimum performance levels of the the developed TC algorithms. For the analyzed scenarios of remote Alpine communities and rural Tanzania, the evaluation shows that the algorithms improve energy efficiency and more evenly balance energy consumption across backhaul nodes, thus significantly increasing the number of available backhaul nodes compared to state-of-the-art TC algorithms...|$|R
