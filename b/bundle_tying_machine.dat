40|$|A before-and-after {{experimental}} design {{was conducted to}} evaluate the potential reduction {{in the risk of}} musculoskeletal injuries to concrete reinforcement workers when using an automatic rebar <b>tying</b> <b>machine.</b> Eleven (11) concrete reinforcement workers participated in this experiment. All dependent variables (trunk posture, and rebar tying time) were measured before and after implementing the rebar <b>tying</b> <b>machine.</b> The results of the study indicated that working with a rebar <b>tying</b> <b>machine</b> significantly reduced the magnitude and duration of exposure to awkward trunk posture. Tying time was reduced when participants used the machine. Based on trunk posture exposure and rebar tying time, it is concluded that the rebar <b>tying</b> <b>machine</b> can be an effective tool to reduce the frequency and duration of severe trunk flexion and increase productivity among concrete reinforcement workers...|$|R

40|$|I {{discuss the}} impact of <b>tying,</b> <b>bundling,</b> and loyalty/requirement rebates on {{consumer}} surplus in the affected markets. I show that the Chicago School Theory of a single monopoly surplus that justifies <b>tying,</b> <b>bundling,</b> and loyalty/requirement rebates {{on the basis of}} efficiency typically fails. Thus, <b>tying,</b> <b>bundling,</b> and loyalty/requirement rebates can be used to extract consumer surplus and enhance profit of firms with market power.

60|$|In the meantime, we {{had found}} nothing of any value but the silver and the trinkets, and neither of these were in our way.

Instantly there broke from the grey parcel a little moaning cry, and from it there protruded a small, scared face, with very bright brown eyes, and two little speckled, dimpled fists.|$|R

60|$|SIR,--Having read, in {{your paper}} of the 26th of October last, a {{paragraph}} respecting an old gentleman {{by the name}} of Knickerbocker, who was missing from his lodgings; if it would be any relief to his friends, or furnish them with any clue to discover where he is, you may inform them that a person answering the description given was seen by the passengers of the Albany stage, early in the morning, about four or five weeks since, resting himself {{by the side of the}} road, a little above King's Bridge. He had in his hand a small <b>bundle</b> <b>tied</b> in a red bandana handkerchief: he appeared to be traveling northward, and was very much fatigued and exhausted.|$|R

60|$|A mile {{west of the}} {{settlement}} Wetzel abandoned the forest and picked {{his way down the}} steep bluff to the river. Here he prepared to swim to the western shore. He took off his buckskin garments, spread them out on the ground, placed his knapsack in the middle, and rolling all into a small <b>bundle</b> <b>tied</b> it round his rifle. Grasping the rifle just above the hammer he waded into the water up to his waist and then, turning easily on his back he held the rifle straight up, allowing the butt to rest on his breast. This left his right arm unhampered. With a powerful back-arm stroke he rapidly swam the river, which was deep and narrow at this point. In {{a quarter of an hour}} he was once more in his dry suit.|$|R
60|$|In {{the centre}} of the lane a row of elm-trees {{displayed}} their gnarled, knotted roots. Human beings were seated there, whose matted hair clung round their tired faces. Their gaunt limbs were clothed in rags; each had a stick, and some sort of dirty <b>bundle</b> <b>tied</b> to it. They were asleep. On a bench beyond, two toothless old women sat, moving their eyes from side to side, and a crimson-faced woman was snoring. Under the next tree a Cockney youth and his girl were sitting side by side-pale young things, with loose mouths, and hollow cheeks, and restless eyes. Their arms were enlaced; they were silent. A little farther on two young men in working clothes were looking straight before them, with desperately tired faces. They, too, were silent.|$|R
60|$|What was {{her real}} fate nobody knows, in {{consequence}} {{of so many}} pretending to know. It {{is one of those}} facts that have become confounded by a variety of historians. Some asserted that she lost her way among the tangled mazes of the swamp and sunk into some pit or slough; others, more uncharitable, hinted that she had eloped with the household booty, and made off to some other province; while others assert that the tempter had decoyed her into a dismal quagmire, on top of which her hat was found lying. In confirmation of this, it was said a great black man with an axe on his shoulder was seen late that very evening coming out of the swamp, carrying a <b>bundle</b> <b>tied</b> in a check apron, with an air of surly triumph.|$|R
40|$|The pithy, {{cylindrical}} stalks {{were used}} to weave matting, {{as well as for}} bedding and roofing material. As thatching material, common threesquare was spread out in <b>bundles,</b> <b>tied</b> together, then secured in place with poles. Various indigenous peoples of Canada ate the fleshy rootstocks and rhizomes (Kunlein and Turner 1991). The Kwakiutl used the stalks and oil on a child’s head to make the hair grow long and thick (Moerman 1998). Conservation: Common threesquare is especially good for stabilizing or restoring disturbed or degraded areas, for erosion and slope control, and for wildlife food and cover. Its dense root mass makes this species resistant to soil compaction and erosion making it an excellent choice for soil stabilization in wetland and riparian sites. Wildlife: The seed is used by wetland birds including: baldpate...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the economic logic underlying bundles and tie-in sales {{and uses the}} lessons learned from that examination to analyze seven specific instances of bundling {{that have been the}} subject of antitrust scrutiny or other policy initiatives. It is particularly interested in products that are non-rivalrous in consumption, making all-you-can-eat pricing a viable candidate for efficiency. The main economic points are the following: A la carte pricing may populate economic models, but most products are bundles. They are bundles because bundles are generally more efficient. Tie-in sales are much less common and often not properly understood in textbook discussions. Market foreclosure, the principal efficiency concern with <b>tying</b> and <b>bundling,</b> is likely to be exceedingly rare. The seven instances of <b>bundling</b> (<b>ties)</b> examined in the paper are: cable television; patent pools; blanket licenses; iPods and iTunes; telephones; musi...|$|R

40|$|In this Article {{we propose}} that monopolization conduct be {{analyzed}} {{through the lens}} of cartel behavior. Although cartels typically suppress interfirm rivalry, in many instances this is not their sole focus. Many cartels operate as two-stage mechanisms. The first stage consists of reaching a consensus on a plan to restrict output or otherwise curb rivalry. For many cartels, once interfirm rivalry is addressed, the cartel moves to the second stage of activity, in which it uses exclusionary behavior often featured in monopolization cases to ensure the effectiveness of its efforts to restrict output. To illustrate this phenomenon, we draw upon the records of cartel inquiries to provide examples of cartels engaging in overt predation against non-cartel rivals, leveraging into both downstream and horizontally-related markets, exclusively dealing, blocking entry, <b>bundling,</b> <b>tying,</b> raising rivals 2 ̆ 7 costs, and other conduct typically associated with allegations of monopolization...|$|R
40|$|We analyze firms' {{incentives}} to <b>bundle</b> and <b>tie</b> in the telecommunications industry. As a first step, we develop a discrete-choice demand model where firms sell products that may combine several services in bundles, and consumers choose assortments {{of different types}} of products available from various vendors. Our approach extends standard discrete-choice demand models of differentiated product to allow for both flexible substitution patterns and to map demand for each choice alternative onto the demand for each service or bundle that a firm may sell. We exploit these properties to examine bundling behavior when firms choose: (i) prices, and (ii) which products to sell. Using consumer-level data and survey data from the Portuguese telecommunications industry, we estimate our demand model and identify firm {{incentives to}} <b>bundle</b> and <b>tie</b> in this industry. We use the model to perform several policy related conterfactuals and evaluate their impact on prices and product provision...|$|R
