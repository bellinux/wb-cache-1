40|$|Nationally, a {{critical}} nursing shortage looms. In {{addition to the}} fact that nurses are increasingly in short supply, the aging of the nursing profession combines to present a daunting challenge to the healthcare field. Exactly why students may not be choosing the nursing profession in adequate numbers is not known. However, several factors inherent to nursing are suspected. For example, the strong likelihood of experiencing severe occupational injuries (i. e., back injury) or illnesses (i. e., occupational stress, or some <b>blood</b> <b>borne</b> <b>pathogen)</b> or workplace violence, which nurses face daily, are arguably primary motivators for nurses to leave the profession, thus adding to the shortage.

40|$|Worldwide, {{approximately}} 170 {{million people}} are infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV), which gives a global prevalence of about 3 %. HCV is a <b>blood</b> <b>borne</b> <b>pathogen</b> build up from a genetically variable RNA genome, a nucleocapsid and an envelope that contains glycoproteins required for attachment and entry to host cells, which are mainly hepatocytes. HCV can be classified into six genotypes which can be further divided in subtypes. The natural history and response to treatment varies between the different genotypes and subtypes. Chronic HCV infections are identified as the major cause for chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and liver transplantation. The majority of HCV infections remain asymptomatic for many years, which leads to spread of the virus and late treatment. The predominant mode of transmission in many Western countries is injecting drug abuse. The detection of hepatitis C or anti-HCV antibodies is important for both the first diagnosis and the monitoring of the treatment. Conventional serological tests include anti-HCV antibody and HCV antigen tests. If genotype-specific HCV epitopes are used for the immunoassay, this technique {{can also be used}} to determine the HCV genotype. Another serological marker than anti-HCV antibodies is the HCV core protein. The molecular techniques consist from several methods of Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT) and genotype testing. NATs include qualitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), which are used for detection; and branched-chain DNA (bDNA) amplification, quantitative RT-PCR and Real-Time RT-PCR, which are used for quantification. The usage of NATs is currently the preferred method to confirm a HCV infection. However, serological tests are still used mainly in developing countries because of the relative low costs compared to molecular techniques. The current available HCV tests show a high sensitivity and specificity. ...|$|R

Most of the injections (90 to 95 %) are given for therapeutic purposes and only 5 to 10 % are given for immunization. It is estimated that worldwide every year a billion injections are given to women and children for immunization. Up to half of these injections are currently thought to be unsafe. Due to the sheer burden of injections and the coresponding magnitude of unsafe injections, the proportion of <b>blood</b> <b>borne</b> <b>pathogen</b> transmission is much larger than is due to unsafe blood transfusion. Unsafe injections are responsible for million cases of Hepatitis B and C and an estimated one-quarter of a million cases of HIV annually. Worldwide 8 to 16 million hepatitis B, 2. 3 - 4. 7 million hepatitis C and 80, 000 - 1, 60, 000 HIV infections are estimated to occur yearly form reuse of syringes and needles without adequate sterilization 2.

The authors apply concepts from infectious disease epidemiology to discuss the direct and indirect effects of SEP upon the spread of <b>blood</b> <b>borne</b> <b>pathogens</b> in drug users, their social networks and the broader community. Further, the authors discuss social policies, particularly drug control policies, which have directly and/or indirectly limited SEP functioning at local and national levels. A critical review of the literature suggests that biases common to observational studies can account for higher HIV incidence among SEP attenders relative to non-attenders. Strong selection factors often lead high-risk drug users to be over-represented among SEP attenders. Failure to account for these factors and the indirect effects of SEPs can bias interpretations of programme effectiveness. Future SEP evaluations should consider behavioural data, the local ethnographic context, the prevalence of infectious disease in the groups under study and the structural components of SEP that are most and least effective at reducing incidence of <b>blood</b> <b>borne</b> <b>pathogens.</b> Hierarchical models that take into account the ecological dimensions of SEP are recommended as an approach for future studies.

40|$|A {{contentious}} area {{of clinical}} {{practice in the}} discipline of surgery, with ethical implications, relates to disclosure of clinician HIV status to patients, specifically where exposure prone procedures, performed in a confined body space using sharp instruments without full vision of the operative area, carrying a technical risk of <b>blood</b> <b>borne</b> <b>pathogen</b> transmission are being performed by HIV positive surgeons. Within the context of patient informed consent, it has been proposed that surgeons who are HIV positive make their status known to patients on whom they would perform such procedures. Failing which it is proposed that surgeons who are HIV positive should refrain from such procedures. It has been counterargued that such disclosure is an infringement on clinician privacy and that curtailing the scope of practice is prejudicial to both surgeon and patient. The former in terms of employment prospects and the latter based {{on the lack of}} data supporting a significant risk of clinician to patient transmission with a resultant unnecessary loss of surgical skills. Existing recommendations appear to be informed more by sentiment than science and are thus potentially unsatisfactory, more so in that they do not seem to confer benefit to either patients or clinicians. Further, whilst such policies emanate from developed countries they may not address the clinical realities or sentiment of the South African situation. Where such policies do exist, it is not clear to what extent the recommendations accord with clinician views. Against this background the current study surveyed views of practicing South African surgeons regarding aspects of this issue i. e. HIV and surgeons. Some of the salient findings included the view that a patient centred approach requiring HIV status disclosure to patients would be discriminatory to surgeons whilst not clearly of benefit to patients. Further that HIV positive surgeons should determine their own scope of practice. Certainly it appears that patient centered approaches and restrictive policies, related to this issue, do not appear to accord with clinician sentiment. In the absence of any comparable data either locally or internationally, the current study provides a preliminary indication of clinician views with implications for the development of locally relevant guidelines...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims: Hepatitis G virus (HGV) has a {{worldwide}} distribution, and the prevalence rates among blood donors and high-risk groups are different. The {{purpose of this}} study was to assess the frequency of the HGV infection in blood donors as a <b>blood</b> <b>borne</b> <b>pathogen</b> and in high-risk groups (multitransfused patients), such as thalassemic, hemophillic, and hemodialysis patients. Methods: 400 Iranian (Tehran Blood Transfusion Center, 2004) blood donors were tested for HGV RNA by a reverse transcriptase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. The participants were negative in blood screening tests for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C virus antibodies (anti- HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Ag/Ab, and Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR). HGV RNA positivity was surveyed in 40 thalassaemic, 16 hemophilic, and 46 hemodialysis patients by RT-PCR. To assess the frequency of infection, the prevalence of HGV RNA positive cases per 100 donors/patients with 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI) were calculated. P values were estimated with chi-square tests. Results: 19 (4. 8 %; 95 % CI: 2. 9 - 6. 5 %) out of 400 blood donors samples were HGV RNA positive. The prevalence of HGV infection was 5. 28 % (13 out of 243) in repeat donors, 4. 12 % (4 in 99) in lapsed donors, and 3. 50 % (2 out of 58) in first-time blood donors. The combined prevalence of HGV infection in these groups of patients was 16 (15. 7 %; 95 % CI: 8. 3 - 23. 1 %) out of 102 samples. HGV RNA frequency was 1 out of 40 (2. 5 %; 95 % CI: 1. 8 - 3. 2 %) thalassemic patients, 15 out of 46 (32. 6 %; 95 % CI: 16. 8 - 48. 4 %) hemodialysis patients, and 0 out of 16 hemophilics patients. Conclusions: The prevalence of HGV RNA in the high-risk population was 15. 7 % and nearly 3 times more than blood donors (4. 8 %). These data indicate the possibility of parenteral transmission of HGV, especially by transfusion of blood and blood components. Decisions to screen blood supplies for a transfusion-transmitted infection agent should be based on sufficient benefits for recipients...|$|R
40|$|Abstract 				 				 					 						Background 					The {{complexity}} and multiscale {{nature of the}} mammalian immune response provides an excellent test bed for the potential of mathematical modeling and simulation to facilitate mechanistic understanding. Historically, mathematical models of the immune response focused on subsets {{of the immune system}} and/or specific aspects of the response. Mathematical models have been developed for the humoral side of the immune response, or for the cellular side, or for cytokine kinetics, but rarely have they been proposed to encompass the overall system complexity. We propose here a framework for integration of subset models, based on a system biology approach. 				 				 					 						Results 					A dynamic simulator, the Fully-integrated Immune Response Model (FIRM), was built in a stepwise fashion by integrating published subset models and adding novel features. The approach used to build the model includes the formulation of the network of interacting species and the subsequent introduction of rate laws to describe each biological process. The resulting model represents a multi-organ structure, comprised of the target organ where the immune response takes place, circulating blood, lymphoid T, and lymphoid B tissue. The cell types accounted for include macrophages, a few T-cell lineages (cytotoxic, regulatory, helper 1, and helper 2), and B-cell activation to plasma cells. Four different cytokines were accounted for: IFN-&# 947;, IL- 4, IL- 10 and IL- 12. In addition, generic inflammatory signals are used to represent the kinetics of IL- 1, IL- 2, and TGF-&# 946;. Cell recruitment, differentiation, replication, apoptosis and migration are described as appropriate for the different cell types. The model is a hybrid structure containing information from several mammalian species. The structure of the network was built to be physiologically and biochemically consistent. Rate laws for all the cellular fate processes, growth factor production rates and half-lives, together with antibody production rates and half-lives, are provided. The results demonstrate how this framework can be used to integrate mathematical models of the immune response from several published sources and describe qualitative predictions of global immune system response arising from the integrated, hybrid model. In addition, we show how the model can be expanded to include novel biological findings. Case studies were carried out to simulate TB infection, tumor rejection, response to a <b>blood</b> <b>borne</b> <b>pathogen</b> and the consequences of accounting for regulatory T-cells. 				 				 					 						Conclusions 					The final result of this work is a postulated and increasingly comprehensive representation of the mammalian immune system, based on physiological knowledge and susceptible to further experimental testing and validation. We believe that the integrated nature of FIRM has the potential to simulate a range of responses under a variety of conditions, from modeling of immune responses after tuberculosis (TB) infection to tumor formation in tissues. FIRM also has the flexibility to be expanded to include both complex and novel immunological response features as our knowledge of the immune system advances...|$|R

40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the HIV epidemic, intravenous drug use has been directly and indirectly accountable for more than 1 / 3 of all cases. It has been shown that syringe exchange programs (SEPs) prevent and reduce incidence of HIV and other <b>blood</b> <b>borne</b> <b>pathogens</b> among IDUs. Approximately 203 SEPs are operating in 34 different states, but less than 10 % of IDUs can access their services. This is of strategic public health significance due to the recent federal ban on funding for SEPs in January 2012. One response to this, in an effort to increase coverage and reduce incidence of <b>blood</b> <b>borne</b> <b>pathogens,</b> IDUs have spontaneously emerged as “secondary syringe exchangers” (SSEs) to disseminate sterile injection equipment in the community. Although secondary exchangers exist, minimal data exists on their effectiveness and risk for HIV and other <b>blood</b> <b>borne</b> <b>pathogens.</b> A critical literature review included peer-reviewed studies on SSEs anywhere in the United States. Relevant research with regard to SSEs was accessed primarily through medical, public health, and social science databases. In order to ensure that relevant studies were included, the search terms used employed multiple synonyms for SEPs and SSEs, with no publication date restrictions. The studies included in the review were concentrated in two states and were subject to several different types of bias including: recall, response, interviewer, and sampling. The majority of studies found that SSEs were likely to be African American, male, unemployed, and had more extensive social interactions with other IDUs and larger networks. HIV risk-related behaviors were higher among receptive secondary exchangers versus distributive exchangers; however, both {{were more likely to be}} protected against HIV versus non-exchangers.

The {{aim of this study}} was to identify such plants with antimicrobial and antioxidant efficacy for controlling some food <b>borne</b> <b>pathogens.</b> The locally available plants viz., Ficus religiosa, Leucas aspera, Holarrhena antidysenterica and Psidium guajavai were selected for the study. Various methods were tried to standardize the extraction of antimicrobial agents. Methanol extraction of P. guajava showed high antimicrobial activity against the food <b>borne</b> <b>pathogens</b> like S. typi, Pseudomonas spp and B. Subtilis. Whereas in case of antifungal H. antidysenterica showed more activity with maximum of 23 mm inhibition zone against Aspergillus spp. The high antioxidant activity of 36 ìg/ 100 mg was observed in Psidium guajava. The GC-MS study also revealed the various phytic components for H. antidysenterica, which assured that it has high antimicrobial, anticancer activity against the food <b>borne</b> <b>pathogens.</b> It was concluded that plant extract can be used as a preservatives against the food <b>borne</b> <b>pathogens.</b> Key words: Antioxidant Antimicrobial Antifungal activity Medicinal plant INTRODUCTION In order to promote the use of {{medicinal plants}} as Nature has been a source of medicinal agents for pertinent to thoroughly investigate their composition thousands of years and an impressive number of modern and activity and thus validate their use [1].
