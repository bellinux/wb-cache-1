5|$|The {{metabolism}} of bupropion {{is highly}} variable: the effective doses of bupropion received by persons who ingest {{the same amount}} of the drug may differ <b>by</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as 5.5times (with a half-life of 12–30hours), while the effective doses of hydroxybupropion may differ <b>by</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as 7.5times (with a half-life of 15–25hours). Based on this, some researchers have advocated monitoring of the blood level of bupropion and hydroxybupropion. The half-lives of erythrohydrobupropion and threohydrobupropion are roughly 23–43hours and 24–50hours respectively.|$|E

5|$|During the November 11, 2006, {{game against}} Kansas State, McCoy {{suffered}} a stinger shoulder injury while rushing {{for a touchdown}} on the opening drive against Kansas State.

The Longhorns fell behind <b>by</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as 21 points before Snead brought them back to within 3, finally falling in an upset by the Wildcats 45–42. There was speculation that Snead might be the starter for the final regular season game, because it was unknown whether McCoy would return for the Longhorns season closer against rival Texas A on November 24, 2006. However, McCoy was cleared to play the game against the Aggies.|$|E

In comparison, the blue iguana of Grand Cayman's head-bob displays differed {{from those of the}} animals on Cuba by only about 20%. The rapid change in display structure between the colony of animals on Isla Magueyes and those on Cuba illustrated the potential of small founding population size as a catalyst to evolution with regard to communication or display.

The Knicks briefly came within 10 points with ten minutes left in the game, but the Nuggets went on a 12–2 run and were never threatened again. Carmelo Anthony scored 24 points to lead the Nuggets, and Marcus Camby added 24 points and 9 rebounds; Stephon Marbury scored a season-high 31 points for the Knicks.|$|E
5|$|Gernot Klepper, in an {{analysis}} similar to Krugman and Baldwin, has also used the Brander Spencer and other models to analyze the effects of entry into the transport aircraft industry. He included the effects of learning during the production process which depends {{on the scale of}} production. His calibrated model suggested that per unit production costs can fall <b>by</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as 20% if total production is doubled. In that case, the entry of another firm (in this case, Airbus) into the market would decrease per firm output and reduce the learning and scale effects. In his analysis, the entry of Airbus would cause an increase in consumer surplus, but this would be smaller than the resulting loss in producer surplus.|$|E
5|$|In Oklahoma, {{moisture}} from the storm, combined with a slow-moving cold front, produced heavy rainfall across the state, peaking at 8.98inches (228mm) in Courtney. Due to below normal precipitation <b>by</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as 5 to 10inches (127 to 255mm), flooding was localized and overall minimal. Near Medford, the rainfall lead to 2feet (0.6m) deep flooding on U.S. Highway 81, forcing its closure. The rainfall was welcome in the state, and lessened the rainfall deficit.|$|E

5|$|Many {{genes are}} known to be {{involved}} in schizophrenia, each of small effect and unknown transmission and expression. The summation of these effect sizes into a polygenic risk score can explain at least 7% of the variability in liability for schizophrenia. Around 5% of cases of schizophrenia are understood to be at least partially attributable to rare copy number variants (CNVs), including 22q11, 1q21 and 16p11. These rare CNVs increase the risk of an individual developing the disorder <b>by</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as 20-fold, and are frequently comorbid with autism and intellectual disabilities. There is a genetic relation between the common variants which cause schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, an inverse genetic correlation with intelligence and no genetic correlation with immune disorders.|$|E
