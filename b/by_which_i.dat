500|$|Playwright Alan Bennett was {{particularly}} repulsed by Witchfinder. In his regular column in The Listener, published eight {{days after the}} film's release, Bennett explained how he felt horror films should always be [...] "punctuated by belly laughs" [...] and attacked Reeves's completely humourless movie as [...] "the most persistently sadistic and morally rotten film I have seen. It was a degrading experience <b>by</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> mean {{it made me feel}} dirty." [...] Although Reeves was infuriated, his response indicated that he believed Bennett's reaction was proof that his decision to include such extreme violence was the correct approach to the material. In his letter published in The Listener, Reeves noted: [...] "Surely the most immoral thing in any form of entertainment is the conditioning of the audience to accept and enjoy violence... Violence is horrible, degrading and sordid. Insofar as one is going to show it on the screen at all, it should be presented as such– and the more people it shocks into sickened recognition of these facts the better. I wish I could have witnessed Mr. Bennett frantically attempting to wash away the 'dirty' feeling my film gave him. It would have been proof of the fact that Witchfinder General works as intended." ...|$|E

Clubs Nathan Rabin {{reported}} that past season premieres of 30 Rock {{had a solid}} track record as being the worst episodes of the season, nonetheless Rabin found [...] "The Fabian Strategy" [...] hilarious and breaking that barrier. He wrote that Matt Damon has been great on the show as Carol; however, his only complaint was Carol's character flaw as being too sensitive. Rabin, who has complained [...] "extensively" [...] about Jenna's character in the past, said the character was in [...] "fine form" [...] {{in her role as}} a TGS producer. Rabin gave the episode an A- grade rating. Bob Sassone of TV Squad deemed this episode a [...] "solid season-opener" [...] that featured [...] "lots of great lines and plot development". Meredith Blake, a contributor from the Los Angeles Times, was thrilled that the Jack and Avery relationship [...] "not only lasted the summer, but is thriving", and wrote that she was looking forward to the pregnancy storyline involving Avery. Blake noted that Damon's character was [...] "darn-near perfect, <b>by</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> mean 'a male version of Liz.'" [...] Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for HitFix said that [...] "The Fabian Strategy" [...] did not [...] "live up to the good old days" [...] of past episodes, nonetheless {{reported that}} he [...] "laughed enough" [...] and was pleased with the direction the show took Liz and Carol's relationship. Sepinwall did not like Tracy and Kenneth's story, calling it a complete miss, but was appreciative of the other storylines, choosing Pete and Jenna's as his favorite. Alessandra Stanley from The New York Times was positive about Damon's role on the show, noting that he has been a [...] "hoot". Scott Eidler of The Cornell Daily Sun commented that the episode was a [...] "nice start to the [...] season" [...] of 30 Rock as it was [...] "perhaps more plot-driven than packed with the emotional and uproariously funny episodes that concluded last season." [...] Eidler commented that [...] "The Fabian Strategy" [...] never did [...] " [...] the utter hilariousness of last season, but I hope that wasn't the climax... and it can eventually return to its previous heights of hilarity". TV Guides Bruce Fretts was complimentary towards Damon's role as Tina Fey's love interest, writing that Damon [...] "showed a refreshingly silly side in keeping with 30 Rocks anything-goes spirit." [...] Matt Wilstein of The Huffington Post called the premiere [...] "a very solid first episode", enjoying Damon's part on the show and the Kenneth story of him still being fired by NBC.|$|E

2500|$|The {{volume was}} {{published}} {{during a period}} when Pound felt despondent about his work, and he added a defense on the last page: [...] "I give only these unquestionable poems... it is quite certain that the personal hatred <b>by</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> am held by many, and the invidia which is directed against me because I have dared openly to declare my belief in certain young artists {{will be brought to}} bear on the flaws of such translations".

40|$|AbstractThe {{exploration}} of the redox chemistry of bound ubiquinone during catalysis {{is a prerequisite for}} the understanding of the mechanism <b>by</b> <b>which</b> Complex <b>I</b> (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) :ubiquinone oxidoreductase) transduces redox energy into an electrochemical proton gradient. Studies of redox dependent changes in the spectrum of Complex I from Escherichia coli in the mid- and near-ultraviolet (UV) and visible areas were performed to identify the spectral contribution, and to determine the redox properties, of the tightly bound ubiquinone. A very low midpoint redox potential (<− 300 mV) was found for the bound ubiquinone, more than 400 mV lower than when dissolved in a phospholipid membrane. This thermodynamic property of bound ubiquinone has important implications for the mechanism <b>by</b> <b>which</b> Complex <b>I</b> catalyzes proton translocation...|$|R

The then Yale provost, Alison Richard, stated that gay and lesbian studies was too narrow a specialty for a program in perpetuity. Kramer's rejected proposal read: [...] "Yale is to use this money solely for 1) the study of and/or instruction in gay male literature, <b>by</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> mean courses to study gay male writers throughout history or the teaching to gay male students of writing about their heritage and their experience.

2500|$|As with Magick itself, {{a magical}} weapon is any {{instrument}} {{used to bring}} about intentional change.

The composition and distribution of this book is thus an act of Magick <b>by</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> cause Changes {{to take place in}} conformity with my Will." [...] With that said, in practice, magical weapons are usually specific, consecrated items used within ceremonial magic. There is no hard and fast rule for what is or isn't a magical weapon—if a magician considers it such a weapon, then it is. However, there does exist a set of magical weapons that have particular uses and symbolic meanings. Common weapons include the dagger (or athame in neopagan parlance), sword, wand, holy oil, cup (or graal), disk (or pentacle), oil lamp, bell, and thurible (or censer).|$|E

When Ismail led the independent Malayan delegation to the General Assembly, he carried the traditional Malay dagger (kris) – according to him, the first time a weapon of any kind had been brought into the assembly. At the UN, Ismail developed a strongly held view that Malayan foreign policy had to keep [...] "an independent line, <b>by</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> mean that our stand on international problems should not be influenced by the policies of other countries, big or small". While serving in the United States and at the United Nations, Ismail wrote personal notes to the Prime Minister, which were recently compiled and published in a book titled [...] "Malaya's First Year at the UN". Ismail remained involved in local politics, however, and pressed for the Alliance coalition of UMNO, the MCA and the Malayan Indian Congress (MIC) to merge into one multi-racial party, instead of remaining as a coalition comprising three mono-racial parties.|$|E
