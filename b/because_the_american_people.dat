More accurately, they are being killed by an alliance of misguided, paternalistic "reformers," education profiteers, and those who seek to dismantle the institution of public education.

40|$|America {{is known}} as the country of {{immigrant}} <b>because</b> most of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> are immigrants. They came from many different countries with many different cultures too. Sometimes, the different culture between their own culture and American culture makes them face some conflicts. The person who often faces those conflicts is the second immigrant or the children of the first immigrant who was born in America. That issue is the reasons why the writer makes this thesis. This thesis is aimed to analyze the conflicts which are faced by Gogol, one of the characters in the movie entitled “The Namesake”. The method of research in writing this thesis is library research. The methods of approaches that the writer uses are structural approach, sociology of literature and psychological theory. The structural approach is used to analyze intrinsic aspects such as character, setting and conflict. Besides that, the writer also uses cinematography theory since this thesis uses movie as the object. The sociology of literature is used only in observation of Indian culture and American culture in “The Namesake” movie. Meanwhile, in the psychological theory, the writer uses psychoanalytical theory of Sigmund Freud which consists of id, ego, and superego. Through the analysis, the writer finds that Gogol faces a lot of conflicts, both internal and external. <b>The</b> conflicts appear <b>because</b> three structures in psychoanalytical theory (id, ego and superego) are not integrated well and do not work in harmony. Besides that, the writer also finds that there is culture clash between Indian culture and American culture which gives certain effects in Gogol’s life...|$|R

5000|$|An article {{written for}} the Washington Post on 10 July 2005 raised the {{attention}} of commentators {{in the media and}} [...] "blogosphere". The piece, an attempt to articulate Cohen's self identified roles as academic, pundit, and father, was written as his son prepared to deploy to Iraq to fight a war the elder Cohen had been calling for since early 2001. The piece ends:There is a lot of talk these days about shaky public support for the war. That is not really the issue. Nor should cheerleading, as opposed to truth-telling, be our leaders' chief concern. If we fail in Iraq—and I don't think we will—it won't be <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> lack heart, but because leaders and institutions have failed. Rather than fretting about support at home, let them show themselves dedicated to waging and winning a strange kind of war and describing it as it is, candidly and in detail. Then the American people will give them all the support they need. The scholar in me is not surprised when our leaders blunder, although the pundit in me is dismayed when they do. What the father in me expects from our leaders is, simply, the truth—an end to happy talk and denials of error, and a seriousness equal to that {{of the men and women}} our country sends into the fight.|$|E

He dismissed the notion that any one single reason explained the loss, saying “Different candidates lost for different reasons.” He saw a bright side in events saying “The good news is that even with these shortcomings, low presidential approval numbers, and uncertainty about Iraq, our candidates saw, even with all those things happening, their ideas taking hold {{in the final days of}} their campaigns. A shift of 78,000 votes in the entire country would have changed the outcome. Our ideas didn’t get beat; in fact, we did.” He applauded the Constitutional system saying the defeat proves “that no one party has a permanent claim to power…This means any viable political movement, such as ours, can never afford to become stagnant or complacent. We must constantly refresh our ideas, assess our performance, and make corrections when necessary. This is a great moment to do all three of those things. For a generation Reagan conservatives have consistently demonstrated an ability to do just that. Nowhere has this been more evident than in our response to the threats of Islamic totalitarianism and the fight with our terrorist enemies.” He said “While the threats of Islamic totalitarianism at times require different tactics, we are approaching those challenges with the same resolve that allowed us to defeat communism. I am convinced that in this fight we will also prevail <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> understand the need to win. We must continue to lead the fight against Islamic totalitarianism and sustain the will to win the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. …the war and on domestic issues Our plan must avoid the mistakes of the past several years. …I am confident that we will successfully move forward.” ...|$|E

40|$|The First Amendment {{states that}} “Congress shall make no law {{respecting}} an establishment of religion, or prohibiting {{the free exercise}} thereof; or abridging {{the freedom of speech}} or of the press. ” The First Amendment made the press a watchdog and a check on the three branches of the government.

Because a free press is one of the cornerstones in a democratic country such as the U. S., this research paper test the hypothesis: that compared to earlier post-Vietnam military public-affairs strategies, the public-affairs strategy in the invasion phase of the Iraq War allowed the American press at a time of armed conflict to serve as a check on the government and inform the American people about military progress without endangering military operational strategy and security. The paper will also examine why public-affairs strategies have been implemented and what factors have influenced the decision to use the various strategies. The paper examine military restrictive public-affairs strategy (the Grenada Invasion and the Persian Gulf War), experimental public-affairs strategy (Bosnia intervention and Afghanistan War) and stategic public-affairs startegy (invasion phase of the Iraq War) ...|$|E
40|$|Living Originalism {{is about}} American {{constitutional}} practice. But it raises {{two sets of}} interesting questions for scholars of comparative constitutional law. First, Balkin is largely silent {{on the role of}} comparative materials in living originalism. But the negative implication from his understanding of constitutions is that comparative materials are irrelevant to constitutional construction. One of the central ideas in Living Originalism is the notion that the Constitution is “our law,” <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> “identify with it and are attached to it. ” The notion of the Constitution as “our law” has embedded within a conception of an intergenerational “collective subject”—We the People—“with a collective destiny that engages in collective activities,” which include the construction of the Constitution itself. And so living originalism means that “we understand our present situation and the possibilities and needs of the future through the trajectory of our interpretation of the meaning of the past—both the principles we committed ourselves to achieving and the evils we promised we would not permit again. ” Constitutional construction is an internally and historically oriented process that draws upon local sources that are situated or particular to American constitutional culture, and seeks to reinterpret and adapt them in light of contemporary circumstances. Comparative materials have no place within this argumentative matrix. So here is my first question: Is it possible to reinterpret living originalism in a way that renders it comparatively engaged while still acknowledging the distinctiveness of the American constitutional identity? Indeed, can a comparatively inflected living originalism actually sharpen an awareness of national constitutional difference? Second, Balkin is self-consciously writing for an American audience about the nature of American constitutional practice. He presents living originalism, fidelity, text and principle, original meaning and original expected application, and constitutional construction as indigenous constitutional concepts, {{in a manner that is}} deeply reminiscent of Bruce Ackerman‟s call to reject foreign constitutional frameworks in We the People. But, of course, the issues that Balkin grapples with are not peculiarly American. It is entirely possible that his conceptual tools might have some analytic purchase outside the United States. Indeed, in a footnote Balkin opens the door to this possibility, even while he denies it. Balkin doubts the comparative relevance of his argument, by underlining that Living Originalism is directed at “the American constitutional tradition and may not be readily generalizable to the constitutions of other countries. ” The reason is that a contingent combination of factors gives rise to American constitutional culture, and he suggests it is unlikely that these factors are found in other constitutional systems. For example, Balkin draws a link between the sociological legitimacy of the American Constitution to “an imagined transgenerational project of constitutional politics,” and opines that “[i]n many cases, a country may play only a minor role in the construction of a national identity. ” Likewise, he contrasts how America‟s Constitution “emerged from a revolutionary tradition” with how other “constitutions developed through longer, more gradual, and relatively peaceful transitions from colonial status. ” But, of course, these are contingent points of contrast that are not necessarily true in every case, and represent differences more in degree than in kind. The American case may be distinctive, but is not utterly unique. This possibility gives rise to my second set of questions: Does Balkin‟s account of the phenomenology of constitutional argument have purchase outside the American constitutional tradition? If so, what can we learn by exploring the culture of constitutional argument in these foreign constitutional cultures...|$|E
