5000|$|The {{vehicles}} were operated {{in a dark}} green camouflage, probably used by the original Warsaw Pact user, and retained this camouflage afterwards, though during combat, {{there is evidence that}} the tanks were streaked with paint or mud to break up the colour. Cypriot National Guard T-34's were entirely unique from all Soviet and Warsaw Pact countries in that they mounted the US M2 Browning [...]50cal machine gun, originally on the rear of the turret roof, on top of the ventilator domes. Some time before 1974, the armament was then moved forward {{to the front of the}} turret, in front of the commanders cupola. The standard identifying marking was a dark blue square overlaid with a white cross, identical to that used by the Hellenic Army, and intended to show the obvious affinity of the indigenous population majority towards Hellenism, and to some extent, unionism with Greece. All of the tanks carried a number plate painted onto the front glacis plate. Following the 1974 invasion by Turkey, numbers in service were drastically reduced through attrition, and the last remaining operational examples were painted in sand yellow and green camouflage, with a yellow <b>bridging</b> <b>class</b> disk applied centrally to their lower bow plate.|$|E
40|$|Seismic {{fragility}} curves for <b>classes</b> {{of highway}} <b>bridges</b> {{are essential for}} risk assessment of highway transportation networks exposed to seismic hazards. This study develops seismic fragility curves for nine <b>classes</b> of <b>bridges</b> (common three-span, zero-skew bridges with non-integral abutments) common to the central and southeastern United States. The methodology adopted uses 3 -D analytical models and nonlinear time-history analyses. An {{important aspect of the}} selected methodology is that it considers the contribution of multiple bridge components. The results show that multispan steel girder bridges are the most vulnerable of the considered <b>bridge</b> <b>classes</b> while single-span <b>bridges</b> tend to be the least vulnerable. A comparison of the proposed fragility curves with those currently found in HAZUS-MH shows a strong agreement for the multispan simply supported steel girder <b>bridge</b> <b>class.</b> However, for other simply supported <b>bridge</b> <b>classes</b> (concrete girder, slab), the proposed fragility curves suggest a lower vulnerability level than presented in HAZUS-MH.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the institutional transformations of language-in-education programmes in Madrid, linked to wider socio-economic processes of change. Drawing on a research team's ethnographic revisit, we explore how wider processes are impacting everyday discursive practices in the <b>Bridging</b> <b>Class</b> (BC) programme, first implemented in 2003 to teach Spanish {{to the children of}} migrant workers in state schools. We focus on the coexistence of this programme with the recently implemented Bilingual Schools Programme, aimed to equip students from working-class areas to compete in global markets. Based on the analysis of interviews and classroom interactions with BC students at one secondary school, in connection with the wider socio-historical processes underlying language-in-education policies, this study reveals a process of discrediting of the BC that contributed to a local hierarchisation of programmes (and its participants). Further implications are discussed regarding how individuals collaborated with each other under these institutional conditions...|$|E

40|$|This article {{contributes}} to the ongoing discussion on how tolerance may be fostered in Western European countries and {{to the question of}} how contextual factors such as welfare state expenditures may contribute to this formation. Tolerance is understood as a basic democratic principle that helps civil societies cope with rising levels of diversity stemming from increased immigration and individualism. Within the tolerance literature it is commonly agreed upon that a comprehensive welfare state is capable of <b>bridging</b> <b>class</b> divides and overcoming social categorization. However, over the past decades European welfare states experienced an ongoing influx of immigrants, challenging their general purpose and increasing notions of ‘welfare chauvinism’. Drawing on insights from both tolerance and welfare state solidarity literature, we implement hierarchical analyses based on Eurobarometer data to assess the potential influence of welfare state universalism on political and social tolerance in 15 Western European countries. Moreover, we demonstrate that this relationship is highly conditional on the degree of ethnic heterogeneity within a country...|$|E

40|$|D. Ed. (Educational Psychology) This {{research}} {{was done in}} response to the need of educational psychologists to intervene on a sensory integration level as it affects learning and behaviour, which falls within the scope of practice of educational psychologists in South Africa. The research study aimed to explore the research question: how sociodrama {{could be used as a}} therapeutic intervention to address the sensory integration of adolescents who present with mild intellectual impairment. The study is situated in the interpretivist-constructivist paradigm, using sociocultural theory as theoretical framework. I therefore commenced with the research with the assumption that the six participants each had their own cultural stories and background within which they functioned, and that they could learn from one another in the sociodramatic group setting. The sociodrama sessions were conducted at a school for learners who presented with mild learning impairments. The participants of the research study attended the <b>bridging</b> <b>class</b> of the school, where the focus is on basic literacy and mathematical skills. Thirteen sociodrama sessions were conducted, where the focus was on the development of sensory integration skills. A qualitative research approach was followed and a case study design was chosen for the inquiry. Data collection included the use of sensory profiles, a background questionnaire, context observation, participant observation, visual journals, reflections, video-recordings and an interview with the educator. I utilised the steps suggested by Braun and Clarke (2006) to thematically analyse the qualitative data and to identify themes. The aim of the research study was to firstly be of benefit to the research participants, creating sociodramatic opportunities through which their sensory integration skills could be developed. The research inquiry furthermore aimed to contribute to the field of educational psychology as it allowed for the development of knowledge on sensory integration and provides a unique therapeutic approach to develop sensory integration skills in adolescents who present with mild intellectual impairment...|$|E

40|$|Errata added at {{request of}} advisor and {{approved}} by Graduate Office, March 15 2016. Quantitative and qualitative assessment of the seismic risk to highway bridges is crucial in pre-earthquake planning, and post-earthquake response of transportation systems. Such assessments provide valuable knowledge {{about a number of}} principal effects of earthquakes such as traffic disruption of the overall highway system, impact on the regions' economy and post-earthquake response and recovery, and more recently serve as measures to quantify resilience. Unlike previous work, this study captures unique bridge design attributes specific to California <b>bridge</b> <b>classes</b> along with their evolution over three significant design eras, separated by the historic 1971 San Fernando and 1989 Loma Prieta earthquakes (these events affected changes in bridge seismic design philosophy). This research developed next-generation fragility curves for four multispan concrete <b>bridge</b> <b>classes</b> by synthesizing new knowledge and emerging modeling capabilities, and by closely coordinating new and ongoing national research initiatives with expertise from bridge designers. A multi-phase framework was developed for generating fragility curves, which provides decision makers with essential tools for emergency response, design, planning, policy support, and maximizing investments in bridge retrofit. This framework encompasses generational changes in bridge design and construction details. Parameterized high-fidelity three-dimensional nonlinear analytical models are developed for the portfolios of <b>bridge</b> <b>classes</b> within different design eras. These models incorporate a wide range of geometric and material uncertainties, and their responses are characterized under seismic loadings. Fragility curves were then developed considering the vulnerability of multiple components and thereby help to quantify the performance of highway bridge networks and to study the impact of seismic design principles on the performance within a <b>bridge</b> <b>class.</b> This not only leads to the development of fragility relations that are unique and better suited for bridges in California, but also leads to the creation of better <b>bridge</b> <b>classes</b> and sub-bins that have more consistent performance characteristics than those currently provided by the National Bridge Inventory. Another important feature of this research is associated with the development of damage state definitions and grouping of bridge components {{in a way that they}} have similar consequences in terms of repair and traffic implications following a seismic event. These definitions are in alignment with the California Department of Transportation's design and operational experience, thereby enabling better performance assessment, emergency response, and management in the aftermath of a seismic event. The fragility curves developed as a part of this research will be employed in ShakeCast, a web-based post-earthquake situational awareness application that automatically retrieves earthquake shaking data and generates potential damage assessment notifications for emergency managers and responders.

40|$|Fragility curves play a {{critical}} role in regional seismic risk assessment and are a key component of tools used to support emergency response and preparedness in California following an earthquake. To have an accurate assessment of regional damage, it is critical to provide fragility curves that best represent the bridge inventory. However, it is impractical to develop unique fragility curves for each structure across a regional portfolio. One strategy that has been adopted to address this challenge is to group <b>bridges</b> into <b>classes</b> with similar design or structural performance. Traditionally, this grouping has been performed based on a relatively subjective identification of sub-classes. However, such an identification leads to a number of <b>bridge</b> <b>classes</b> and unwarranted grouping. This work suggests a performance based grouping methodology to group the box-girder bridges in California, and is the first systematic approach in sub-binning <b>bridge</b> <b>classes</b> for the regional risk assessment. The proposed grouping and analytical fragility methodology is used to derive fragility relationships for single frame box girder bridges in California. The fragility curves generated as a part of this research will be implemented in ShakeCast, a web based post-earthquake situational awareness application that supports the emergency responders and managers in California. This work concludes with the application of machine learning techniques for the generation of bridge-specific fragility curves. Ph. D...|$|R

40|$|Dynamic loads {{can cause}} severe damage to bridges, {{and lead to}} {{malfunction}} of transportation networks. A comprehensive {{understanding of the nature}} of the dynamic loads and the structural response of bridges can prevent undesired failures while keeping the cost-safety balance. Dissimilar to the static behaviour, the dynamic response of bridges depends on several structural parameters such as material properties, damping and mode shapes. Furthermore, dynamic load characteristics can significantly change the structural response. In most cases, complexity and involvement of numerous parameters require the designer to investigate the bridge response via a massive numerical study. Depending on the seismicity of the bridge local site, seismic vulnerability assessment of the bridges can be done based on the fragility curves. These curves are conditional probability functions which give the probability of a bridge attaining or exceeding a particular damage level for an earthquake of a given intensity level. In this dissertation, analytical fragility curves are developed for the ordinary highway bridges in the assessment of their seismic vulnerability. Bridges are first grouped into certain major <b>bridge</b> <b>classes</b> based on their structural attributes and sample bridges are generated to account for the structural variability. Nonlinear response history analyses are conducted for each bridge sample with their detailed 3 -D analytical models under different earthquake ground motions having varying seismic intensities. Several engineering demand parameters are employed in the determination of seismic response of the bridge components as well as defining damage limit states in terms of member capacities. Fragility curves are obtained from the probability of exceeding each specified damage limit state for each major <b>bridge</b> <b>class.</b> Skew and single-column bent bridges are found to be the most vulnerable ones in comparison with the other <b>bridge</b> <b>classes.</b> Developed fragility curves can be implemented in the seismic risk assessment packages for mitigation purposes...|$|R
