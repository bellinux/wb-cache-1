5|$|Both sides {{declared}} victory. On {{a tactical}} level, the battle went in Israel's favor, and {{the aim of}} destroying the Karameh camp was achieved.

50|$|Tobougg {{failed to}} live up to his trainer's {{prediction}} in four starts in 2002. He finished last of the fifteen runners <b>behind</b> Nayef <b>in</b> the Dubai Sheema Classic, and on his return to Europe, ran fifth <b>behind</b> Rebellline <b>in</b> the Tattersalls Gold Cup.|$|R
