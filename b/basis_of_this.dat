On the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> match and his general chess reputation, {{he was invited}} to represent German chess at the first international chess tournament, to be held in London in 1851. Anderssen was reluctant to accept the invitation, as he was deterred by the travel costs. However the tournament's principal organizer, Howard Staunton, offered to pay Anderssen's travel expenses out of his own pocket if necessary, should Anderssen fail to win a tournament prize. Anderssen accepted this generous offer.|$|E
5|$|The fungus {{has been}} shown to provide a {{protective}} effect against heavy metal toxicity when associated with the host Pinus sylvestris, preventing copper accumulation in the needles, and protecting seedlings against cadmium toxicity. Owing to its frequent rate of sexual reproduction and the resulting extensive gene flow within populations, the fungus can rapidly evolve a trait to tolerate otherwise toxic levels of heavy metals in the environment. The genetic <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> adaptation—intriguing to researchers investigating the bioremediation potential of metal-adapted plants and their fungal associates—are contained in the genome sequence of S.luteus, published in 2015.|$|E
5|$|With the {{discovery}} of the pion in 1947, the search for new elementary particles became a popular research topic. By operating fast ionization chambers within a cloud chamber, Herbert showed that the bursts of ionization they recorded were primarily produced by relatively low energy cosmic rays, whose nuclear interactions typically involve the ejection of several heavily ionising nuclear fragments. On the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> effect, he and Rossi demonstrated that the behaviour of these interactions {{is similar to that of}} penetrating showers.|$|E

5|$|A {{percentage}} {{of each group}} working in less contaminated areas was badged. Eventually, 18,875 film-badge dosimeters were issued to about 15% of the total work force. On the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> sampling, a theoretical total exposure was calculated for each person {{who did not have}} a personal badge. As expected, exposures for target ship crewmen who reboarded their ships after Baker were higher than those for support ship crews. The hulls of support ships that entered the lagoon after Baker became so radioactive that sleeping quarters were moved toward the center of each ship. Of the total mass of radioactive particles scattered by each explosion, 85% was unfissioned plutonium which produces alpha radiation not detected by film badges or Geiger counters. There was no method of detecting plutonium in a timely fashion, and participants were not monitored for ingestion of it.|$|E
5|$|According to legend, in 832 A.D. Óengus II led {{an army of}} Picts and Scots {{into battle}} against the Angles, led by Æthelstan, near modern-day Athelstaneford, East Lothian. The legend states that whilst engaged in prayer {{on the eve of}} battle, Óengus vowed that if granted victory he would appoint Saint Andrew as the Patron Saint of Scotland; Andrew then {{appeared}} to Óengus that night in a dream and assured him of victory. On the morning of battle white clouds forming the shape of an X were said to have appeared in the sky. Óengus and his combined force, emboldened by this apparent divine intervention, took to the field and despite being inferior in terms of numbers were victorious. Having interpreted the cloud phenomenon as representing the crux decussata upon which Saint Andrew was crucified, Óengus honoured his pre-battle pledge and duly appointed Saint Andrew as the Patron Saint of Scotland. The white saltire set against a celestial blue background {{is said to have been}} adopted as the design of the flag of Scotland on the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> legend.|$|E
5|$|In 1879, Camille Flammarion {{noted that}} the comets 1862 III and 1889 III had aphelia of 47 and 49AU, respectively, {{suggesting}} that they might mark the orbital radius of an unknown planet that had dragged them into an elliptical orbit. Astronomer George Forbes concluded on the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> evidence that two planets must exist beyond Neptune. He calculated, {{based on the fact}} that four comets possessed aphelia at around 100AU and a further six with aphelia clustered at around 300AU, the orbital elements of a pair of hypothetical trans-Neptunian planets. These elements concorded suggestively with those made independently by another astronomer named David Peck Todd, suggesting to many that they might be valid. However, sceptics argued that the orbits of the comets involved were still too uncertain to produce meaningful results. George Forbes is today considered to be the first describing Planet Nine.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} speculated that the 7s {{electrons}} are relativistically stabilized, so that in reducing conditions, only the 7p1/2 or 6d electron would be ionized, leading to the monovalent Lr+ ion. However, all experiments to reduce Lr3+ to Lr2+ or Lr+ in aqueous solution were unsuccessful, similarly to lutetium. On the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> the standard electrode potential of the E°(Lr3+→Lr+) couple was calculated {{to be less than}} −1.56V, indicating that the existence of Lr+ ions in aqueous solution was unlikely. The upper limit for the E°(Lr3+→Lr2+) couple was predicted to be −0.44V: the values for E°(Lr3+→Lr) and E°(Lr4+→Lr3+) are predicted to be −2.06V and +7.9V. The stability of the group oxidation state in the 6d transition series decreases as RfIV > DbV > SgVI, and lawrencium continues the trend with LrIII being more stable than RfIV.|$|E
5|$|The archetypal {{example of}} this {{situation}} is antithrombin, which circulates in plasma in a partially inserted relatively inactive state. The primary specificity determining residue (the P1 arginine) points toward {{the body of the}} serpin and is unavailable to the protease. Upon binding a high-affinity pentasaccharide sequence within long-chain heparin, antithrombin undergoes a conformational change, RCL expulsion, and exposure of the P1 arginine. The heparin pentasaccharide-bound form of antithrombin is, thus, a more effective inhibitor of thrombin and factor Xa. Furthermore, both of these coagulation proteases also contain binding sites (called exosites) for heparin. Heparin, therefore, also acts as a template for binding of both protease and serpin, further dramatically accelerating the interaction between the two parties. After the initial interaction, the final serpin complex is formed and the heparin moiety is released. This interaction is physiologically important. For example, after injury to the blood vessel wall, heparin is exposed, and antithrombin is activated to control the clotting response. Understanding of the molecular <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> interaction enabled the development of Fondaparinux, a synthetic form of Heparin pentasaccharide used as an anti-clotting drug.|$|E
5|$|The host {{city for}} an Olympic Games is usually chosen {{seven to eight}} years ahead of their celebration. The process of {{selection}} is carried out in two phases that span a two-year period. The prospective host city applies to its country's National Olympic Committee; if more than one city from the same country submits a proposal to its NOC, the national committee typically holds an internal selection, since only one city per NOC can {{be presented to the}} International Olympic Committee for consideration. Once the deadline for submission of proposals by the NOCs is reached, the first phase (Application) begins with the applicant cities asked to complete a questionnaire regarding several key criteria related to the organisation of the Olympic Games. In this form, the applicants must give assurances that they will comply with the Olympic Charter and with any other regulations established by the IOC Executive Committee. The evaluation of the filled questionnaires by a specialised group provides the IOC with an overview of each applicant's project and their potential to host the Games. On the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> technical evaluation, the IOC Executive Board selects the applicants that will proceed to the candidature stage.|$|E

5|$|The two liberal {{governments of}} César Gaviria (1990-1994) and Ernesto Samper (1994-1998) pursued {{a policy of}} {{economic}} opening and business modernization. In the spirit of these policies, the government established a comprehensive new sector policy that aimed at increasing water and sanitation investments through targeted transfers to municipalities, improving service quality and efficiency by promoting private sector participation in the poorest {{parts of the country}} where public utilities were not performing well, the establishment of autonomous regulatory agencies at the national level, increased cost recovery, and protecting the poorest through cross-subsidies in the form of area-based tariffs. The <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> sector policy was established by Law 142 of July 1994, at the end of president César Gaviria’s term of office. With some modifications to that law in 2001, the same policy continues to be pursued to today despite several changes of governments.|$|E
5|$|Voting is {{regarded}} as key to representative democracy, which requires that the leaders of a country are elected by the people. The <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> concept is that everyone should be treated equally and everyone has equal rights. Every person, therefore, {{has a right to}} one vote, and no more, in the choice of representatives. The right to vote is a primary right, a right of fundamental importance by which other rights are protected. It is one of the important bulwarks of a representative democracy and in this regard, the ballot box is the people's ultimate mechanism to control the shaping of government policies. However, it must be recognized that voting is not an infallible litmus test for democracy; rather, it functions as a procedural device that is normally regarded as the best instrument for securing the ideal of self-governance.|$|E
