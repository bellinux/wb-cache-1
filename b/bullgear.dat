40|$|Gearboxes and gears {{are part}} of the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) antenna drives. The drives show {{backlash}} at the gearboxes and elevation <b>bullgear</b> due to a small gap between the gear teeth. Left uncorrected, backlash deteriorates the antenna pointing precision. Implementing two identical drives impose two non-identical torques. The torque difference (a. k. a. torque bias, or counter-torque) eliminates backlash. The electronic circuit at the axis drive generates the torque bias profile. The performance of the existing circuit is analyzed, and a modified circuit is designed that improves the antenna dynamics under external disturbances. 1 2...|$|E
