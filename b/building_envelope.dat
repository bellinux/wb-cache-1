40|$|An {{accurate}} {{method for}} the quantification of real-life driving rain loads on <b>building</b> <b>envelopes</b> from generally available climatic data such as wind speed, wind direction and horizontal rainfall intensity serves various purposes, from {{the development of}} design guidelines for <b>building</b> <b>envelopes</b> to the incorporation of driving rain loads as a boundary condition in Heat-Air-Moisture (HAM) transfer analysis models. In this paper, an existing numerical technique for driving rain simulation is incorporated into a practical numerical method to estimate driving rain loads on <b>building</b> <b>envelopes</b> based on the building geometry and the climatic data at the building site. This numerical method is applied for several sequences of spells around a low-rise test building {{and the results are}} experimentally verified.

40|$|This master’s thesis aims to {{determine}} how – based on {{the example of a}} modern singlefamily house – the design of a <b>building’s</b> <b>envelope</b> influences the comfort of the inhabitants and the consumption of energy inside buildings. We compared two massive and two light designs of <b>building</b> <b>envelopes.</b> The massive <b>building</b> <b>envelopes</b> have a load-bearing structure made of bricks and reinforced concrete and are thermally insulated on the outer side. The light <b>building</b> <b>envelopes</b> are examples of envelopes used in wooden prefabricated buildings. All of the above mentioned <b>building</b> <b>envelopes</b> are regularly used in Slovenia. This master's thesis is divided into several stages. Firstly, we calculated the prescribed parameter values of thermal comfort. Then we made four calculation models {{with the help of the}} EnergyPlus and placed them at the location Udine. We checked the response of the calculation models and took further steps towards improving the level of comfort. Next, the calculation model was moved to a location in Ljubljana. There we repeated the processes from the previous location – we checked the response of the calculation models and took further steps to improve the level of comfort. The study showed that the buildings with light <b>building</b> <b>envelopes</b> are more likely to overheat, have a less stable temperature, and create a less pleasant living environment than buildings with massive <b>building</b> <b>envelopes.</b> In the end we calculated the energy consumption for both locations with programmes EnergyPlus and KI Energija 2014. The comparison shows that the total energy consumption for heating and cooling is similar in all calculation models. The difference in energy consumption between the most efficient and the less efficient model is not higher than 14...|$|R

25|$|To reduce {{operating}} energy use, designers use {{details that}} reduce air leakage through the <b>building</b> <b>envelope</b> (the barrier between conditioned and unconditioned space). They also specify high-performance windows and extra insulation in walls, ceilings, and floors. Another strategy, passive solar building design, is often implemented in low-energy homes. Designers orient windows and walls and place awnings, porches, and trees to shade windows and roofs {{during the summer}} while maximizing solar gain in the winter. In addition, effective window placement (daylighting) can provide more natural light and lessen the need for electric lighting during the day. Solar water heating further reduces energy costs.|$|E

25|$|These {{biological}} chemicals {{can arise}} from {{a host of}} means, {{but there are two}} common classes: (a) moisture induced growth of mold colonies and (b) natural substances released into the air such as animal dander and plant pollen. Mold is always associated with moisture, and its growth can be inhibited by keeping humidity levels below 50%. Moisture buildup inside buildings may arise from water penetrating compromised areas of the <b>building</b> <b>envelope</b> or skin, from plumbing leaks, from condensation due to improper ventilation, or from ground moisture penetrating a building part. Even something as simple as drying clothes indoors on radiators can increase the risk of exposure to (amongst other things) Aspergillus - a highly dangerous mould that can be fatal for asthma sufferers and the elderly. In areas where cellulosic materials (paper and wood, including drywall) become moist and fail to dry within 48 hours, mold mildew can propagate and release allergenic spores into the air.|$|E
25|$|Once in place, {{concrete}} offers great {{energy efficiency}} over {{the lifetime of}} a building. Concrete walls leak air far less than those made of wood frames. Air leakage accounts for {{a large percentage of}} energy loss from a home. The thermal mass properties of concrete increase the efficiency of both residential and commercial buildings. By storing and releasing the energy needed for heating or cooling, concrete's thermal mass delivers year-round benefits by reducing temperature swings inside and minimizing heating and cooling costs. While insulation reduces energy loss through the <b>building</b> <b>envelope,</b> thermal mass uses walls to store and release energy. Modern concrete wall systems use both external insulation and thermal mass to create an energy-efficient building. Insulating concrete forms (ICFs) are hollow blocks or panels made of either insulating foam or rastra that are stacked to form the shape of the walls of a building and then filled with reinforced concrete to create the structure.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} types of {{different}} materials that are used throughout this building. The main materials used in the <b>building</b> <b>envelope</b> consist of concrete, glass, granite and steel. The curtain wall facade of this building uses large glass panels, framed with black granite framing. While the glass used for the lower box is completely transparent, the curtain wall for the upper seven floors uses fritted glass {{with a series of}} light gray circles, each approximately the size of a CD. This creates a protective screen that hinders view out from the building, but provides privacy to its users while reducing heat gain, and maintaining a certain level of sophistication is its aesthetics at the same time. Each of the twelve hypostyle columns are made of reinforced concrete. The columns supporting the tower are Agilia Concrete, which is more enhanced in design effect and construction process compared to traditional concretes: it can be placed 50% faster than the traditional concrete, and form complex shapes that would have been impossible in previous years. Each colossal column spans spanning one meter in diameter and 19 meters high; each one was constructed in a single pour in order to achieve the highest quality and a sense of grace and elegance. A striking urban colonnade is created through this series of columns; asserting its presence on campus while setting distinct boundaries between the street, public space of the campus and the privacy of the pharmacy faculty. Self-compacting concrete is used as the structural support system {{throughout the rest of the}} structure. The pods were constructed as “steel baskets” suspended by steel rods. The shells of these pods are constructed of structural steel and plaster and silver reflective paint are used for the finishes of these pods.|$|E

2500|$|The vast {{majority}} of stained glass was originally created to function {{as part of the}} <b>building</b> <b>envelope,</b> separating the interior of the structure from exterior environmental conditions.

[...] As a result, panels often become encrusted with thick layers of dirt that eventually become quite firmly affixed, and can even begin to intermingle with the underlying, corroded layers of paint (Rauch 2004, 3). [...] Environmental influences also {{play a role in the}} continuing deterioration of metal cames and frameworks, which can cause significant structural damage. In addition to these environmental stressors, further deterioration can also result from the myriad of other factors that influence the materials out of which the window is constructed, such as vibration from building use and the remains of previous treatments and repairs that have since deteriorated and increased the corrosion processes of other materials (Rauch 2004, 3).|$|E
