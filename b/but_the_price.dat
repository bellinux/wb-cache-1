5|$|Catherine of Braganza {{brought the}} Portuguese habit of tea to England around 1660. Initially, its expense {{restricted}} it to wealthy consumers, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> gradually dropped, until by the 19th century its use was widespread. Introduced in the 16th century, coffee became popular by the 17th century, {{especially in the}} coffee houses, the first opening in Oxford in 1650. Hot chocolate was a popular drink by the 17th century, long before it {{was used as a}} food. Chocolate bars were developed and marketed by three English Quaker-founded businesses, Joseph Fry's (1847), Rowntree's (1862), and Cadbury's (1868).|$|E
5|$|Encrypting {{ransomware}} reappeared in September 2013 with a Trojan {{known as}} CryptoLocker, which generated a 2048-bit RSA key pair and uploaded {{in turn to}} a command-and-control server, and used to encrypt files using a whitelist of specific file extensions. The malware threatened to delete the private key if a payment of Bitcoin or a pre-paid cash voucher was not made within 3 days of the infection. Due to the extremely large key size it uses, analysts and those affected by the Trojan considered CryptoLocker extremely difficult to repair. Even after the deadline passed, the private key could still be obtained using an online tool, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> would increase to 10 BTC—which cost approximately US$2300 as of November 2013.|$|E
5|$|In August 2011, the Glazers were {{believed}} to have approached Credit Suisse {{in preparation for a}} $1billion (approx. £600million) initial public offering (IPO) on the Singapore stock exchange that would value the club at more than £2billion. However, in July 2012, the club announced plans to list its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange instead. Shares were originally set to go on sale for between $16 and $20 each, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> was cut to $14 by the launch of the IPO on 10 August, following negative comments from Wall Street analysts and Facebook's disappointing stock market debut in May. Even after the cut, Manchester United was valued at $2.3billion, making it the most valuable football club in the world.|$|E
50|$|If all {{agents have}} the same lexicographic preferences, then general {{equilibrium}} cannot exist because agents won't sell to each other (as long as <b>price</b> of <b>the</b> less preferred is more than zero). <b>But</b> if <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of <b>the</b> less wanted is zero, then all agents want an infinite amount of the good.

25|$|A {{charitable}} {{view of the}} Japanese {{system of}} divorce is that it favors a ‘clean break’ so that the divorced parties have little or nothing {{more to do with}} each other after the divorce. A less generous interpretation is that it permits the spouse with economic assets (usually the husband) to keep most of his assets, avoid payment of alimony and provide little or no child support, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> he pays is the abandonment of any relationship with his children, while the other spouse is punished economically, but keeps her children.|$|E
25|$|Use of {{diclofenac}} {{in animals}} {{has been reported}} to have led to a sharp decline in the vulture population in the Indian subcontinent – a 95% decline by 2003 and a 99.9% decline by 2008. The mechanism is presumed to be renal failure, however toxicity may be due to direct inhibition of uric acid secretion in vultures. Vultures eat the carcasses of livestock that have been administered veterinary diclofenac, and are poisoned by the accumulated chemical, as vultures do not have a particular enzyme to break down diclofenac. At a meeting of the National Wildlife Board in March 2005, the Government of India announced it intended to phase out the veterinary use of diclofenac. Meloxicam is a safer candidate to replace use of diclofenac. It is more expensive than diclofenac, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> is coming down as more drug companies begin to manufacture it.|$|E

25|$|After {{his short}} stint at San Lorenzo, he {{was traded to}} his {{hometown}} team, Talleres and later Racing de Córdoba. In 1996, he joined Belgrano of the Primera B Nacional Argentina; {{for the next two}} years he would be the starter winning Belgrano a promotion to the Primera División Argentina. He moved on to Los Andes, again helping his club to a promotion to the Primera División. Sala's good play earned him a look from Argentine powerhouse River Plate who bought his rights. After earning a few non-league match starts, he was loaned out to rival Independiente where he started for two seasons. After two seasons Independiente were looking to buy Sala, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> was not right. As the Argentine economy unraveled, River officials looked to loan him to a team that could actually afford Sala's price tag; Deportivo Cali in Colombia was that club.|$|E
25|$|In 1860 the Thorndon Park {{reservoir}} was opened, finally {{providing an}} alternative water source to the now turbid River Torrens. Gas street lighting was implemented in 1867, the University of Adelaide {{was founded in}} 1874, the South Australian Art Gallery opened in 1881 and the Happy Valley Reservoir opened in 1896. In the 1890s Australia was affected by a severe economic depression, ending a hectic era of land booms and tumultuous expansionism. Financial institutions in Melbourne and banks in Sydney closed. The national fertility rate fell and immigration {{was reduced to a}} trickle. The value of South Australia's exports nearly halved. Drought and poor harvests from 1884 compounded the problems, with some families leaving for Western Australia. Adelaide was not as badly hit as the larger gold-rush cities of Sydney and Melbourne, and silver and lead discoveries at Broken Hill provided some relief. Only one year of deficit was recorded, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> paid was retrenchments and lean public spending. Wine and copper were the only industries not to suffer a downturn.|$|E

500|$|High Explosive Research {{achieved}} its objective {{with remarkable}} economy and efficiency, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> was still high. Between 1946 and 1953, Risley spent £72 million, Harwell almost £27 million and the weapons establishment over £9.5 million. By comparison, British defence expenditure in 1948 was £600 million. HER accounted for 11 per {{cent of the}} Ministry of Supply's expenditure between 1946 and 1953. It had bi-partisan and popular support. Given Britain's dire financial position, thought turned to replacing conventional forces with atomic bombs. While certainly expensive, they could deliver extraordinary destructive power at relatively low cost. [...] The concept of deterrence began to evolve, based on experiences {{dating back to the}} Great War. There were also technological spin-offs. The possession of nuclear reactors, the means to produce nuclear fuels and a repository of scientific knowledge {{led to the creation of}} a vast nuclear power industry.|$|E
500|$|The 1938 coins, {{again without}} a special name, were struck {{at all three}} mints, {{the first time that}} had been done for the Oregon Trail coins in one year. [...] Six {{thousand}} (plus pieces for the Assay Commission) were struck at each mint, and the issue was sold in sets of three, for $6.25. [...] The same practice was followed in 1939, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> was raised to $7.50 a set and the mintage reduced to 3,000 coins, plus the assay pieces. [...] According to Swiatek and Breen, these sets were also bought up by speculators, and individual collectors often had to pay double or triple the issue price to secure a set. [...] The coins did not sell out instantly; the OTMA's accounting records reveal that nine months after the 1938 coins were put on sale, the organization still had almost half the issue available. Similarly, by October 1939, the Association had sold only 8,283 half dollars dated that year, less than the 9,000 available for sale. Nevertheless, collectors sent letters of protest to congressmen and to the Treasury Department. On August 5, 1939, Congress acted, passing legislation that put an end to all commemorative issues authorized before March 1939. [...] Swiatek and Breen observed that if Congress had not intervened, [...] "there would probably be Oregon Trail coins dated 1980".|$|E
