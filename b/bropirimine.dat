50|$|<b>Bropirimine</b> is an {{experimental}} drug with anti-cancer and antiviral properties. It is an orally effective immunomodulator {{and is being}} tried in bladder cancers.|$|E
50|$|For {{the first}} step, the dianion from malonic acid {{half-ester}} is formed by treatment with butyllithium. Acylation of the anion with benzoyl chloride proceeds at the carbanion, {{which is more}} nucleophilic (because of the higher charge density). This tricarbonyl compound decarboxylates on acidification to the β-ketoester. Condensation with guanidine leads to the pyrimidone. NBS mediated bromination then gives <b>bropirimine.</b>|$|E
40|$|Pyrimidinones, like 2 -amino- 5 -bromo- 6 -phenyl- 4 -pyrimidinone (<b>bropirimine),</b> are potent immunomodulators. Natural killer cell {{activity}} and macrophage cytotoxicity are increased after <b>bropirimine</b> treatment, an effect exerted through induction of cytokines. Up to now, the interferons have been {{supposed to be}} the main mediators but we have found that tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα) can also be an important mediator of the <b>bropirimine</b> antitumour effects. Increased serum levels of TNFα were seen in rats after intraperitoneal administration of 200 mg/kg <b>bropirimine</b> on 2 consecutive days. We also found that the tumour-growth-inhibiting effect of the drug on a colon carcinoma in rats could be reduced about 40 % by giving the rats rabbit anti-TNFα serum just prior to drug treatment. These results indicate that <b>bropirimine</b> can induce the release of TNFα in vivo and that this endogenous TNFα may be important as far as the antitumour effect of the drug is concerned...|$|E
40|$|Reversed-phase {{high-performance}} {{liquid chromatography}} procedures were developed {{for the analysis of}} pyrimidine-based drugs <b>bropirimine</b> and its derivatives (2 -N-acetyl- and 2 -N-propanoyl-) and for pyrimethamine and its 2 / 4 - substituted derivatives (2, N-propanoyl and 2, 4 -N, N-dipropanoyl-) and its 6 - substituted (methyl-, ethyl-, propyl- and isopropyl- carboxylates) analogues. Stability studies indicated that these derivatives were not sufficiently labile to act as potential prodrugs. Solubility-pH profiles were constructed from which the dissociation constants were calculated. The physicochemical properties of these compounds were studied and attempts were made to increase the poor aqueous solubility of <b>bropirimine</b> (35 μg/mL) by prodrug synthesis, solvate formation (acetic acid, N, N-dimethylformamide and N-methylformamide) and the use of co-solvents and additives. The first two methods proved to be fruitless whereas the latter method resulted in an intravenous formulation incorporating 32 mg/mL of <b>bropirimine.</b> An in-vitro method for the detection of precipitation was developed and the results suggested that by using low injection rates (500 mL/hr) precipitation could be minimised. Differential scanning calorimetry showed that <b>bropirimine</b> debrominates {{in the presence of a}} number of additives commonly used in formulation work but the temperature at which this occurred were usually > 200 oC. In-vitro work gave encouraging results for the possibility of rectal delivery of <b>bropirimine</b> but in-vivo work on rabbits showed considerable variations in the resulting plasma levels and pharmacokinetic parameters...|$|E
40|$|Murine {{cytomegalovirus}} (MCMV) {{infection of}} mice resulted in suppression of mitogen induced proliferation and interleukin 2 (IL- 2) responses of splenic cells. This suppression was also evident as {{a reduction in}} the number of cells expressing Thy- 1 or L 3 T 4 and {{a reduction in the}} ratio of T helper/T suppressor cells. The pyrimidinone compound, <b>bropirimine,</b> when administered to MCMV infected mice was able to restore mitogen-induced proliferative and IL- 2 responses of splenic cells, to increase the number of cells expressing Thy- 1 or L 3 T 4, to restore the ratio of T helper/T suppressor cells and to increase the number of cells inducible for expression of IL- 2 receptors...|$|E
40|$|Bladder cancer {{treatment}} remains a challenge despite {{significant improvements in}} preventing disease progression and improving survival. Intravesical therapy {{has been used in}} the management of superficial transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the urinary bladder (i. e. Ta, T 1, and carcinoma in situ) with specific objectives which include treating existing or residual tumor, preventing recurrence of tumor, preventing disease progression, and prolonging survival. The initial clinical stage and grade remain the main determinant factors in survival regardless of the treatment. Prostatic urethral mucosal involvement with bladder cancer can be effectively treated with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) intravesical immunotherapy. Intravesical chemotherapy reduces short-term tumor recurrence by about 20 %, and long-term recurrence by about 7 %, but has not reduced progression or mortality. Presently, BCG immunotherapy remains the most effective treatment and prophylaxis for TCC (Ta, T 1, CIS) and reduces tumor recurrence, disease progression, and mortality. Interferons, Keyhole-limpet hemocyanin (KLH), <b>bropirimine</b> and Photofrin-Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) are under investigation in the management of TCC and early results are encouraging. This review highlights and summarizes the recent advances in therapy for superficial TCC...|$|E
40|$|Biological {{response}} modifiers (BRMs) have particular promise {{when used}} in combination with more standard antiviral agents for treatment of viral diseases. Reported here {{are a series of}} studies which have used two BRMs in combination with the antiviral drug, ribavirin (l-β-o-ribofuranosyl- 1, 2, 4 -triazole- 3 -carboxamide) in treatment of experimentally-induced phlebovirus (Punta Toro virus) infections in mice. The positive BRMs studied include <b>bropirimine</b> (2 -amino- 5 -bromo- 6 -phenyl- 4 [3 H]pyrimidinone) given orally at dosages of 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg/day beginning 24 h after virus inoculation. and 7 -thia- 8 -oxoguanosine administered intrapcritoneally at dosages of 6. 3, 12. 5 and 25 mg/kg/day given 24 and 31 h after virus inoculation. In each experiment. multiple dosages of both BRM and ribavirin were selected to range from ineffective levels to, in certain cases with ribavirin, lethally toxic levels. Ribavirin was always administered orally twice daily for three days starting 24 h after virus inoculation. Both drug combinations were considered synergistic, increasing the therapeutic index compared to either drug used alone, and significantly reducing the evidence of ribavirin toxicity. Efficacy was seen as increased survivors, decreased virus recovery from tissues and blood. and lowered glutamic oxalic and pyruvic transaminase levels in the serum...|$|E
40|$|The {{detection}} of potentially highly curable low-grade bladder cancers by noninvasive techniques remains an unsolved problem. Conventional cytology detects such tumors with 50 % sensitivity, {{the addition of}} DNA image analysis cytometry in patients with previous transitional cell superficial bladder carcinoma increases the chance to detect low-grade tumors. The specificity and sensitivity of {{detection of}} low-grade bladder tumors can be further improved by quantitative fluorescence image analysis using antibodies directed against tumor-associated antigens. The chance of subsequent tumor following initial complete resection is significantly lowered compared to resection alone by either intravesical adjuvant chemotherapy or immunotherapy. BCG is superior to chemotherapy in patients with high risk for recurrence, adjuvant intravesical chemotherapy does not prevent progression to > T 1 when compared with resection alone, BCG may delay progression {{and the need for}} cystectomy in high-risk patients (T 1, Cis or Cis associated with papillary Ta/T 1, > 3 recurrences/year, grade 3 tumors). Oral medication with <b>bropirimine</b> (an interferon inducer) induced complete response in patients with carcinoma in situ, oral Lactobacillus casei prolonged the recurrence-free interval to 1. 8 times that in the control group. New compounds for adjuvant treatment of superficial bladder tumors are best first tested on their ablative effects (marker lesion, Cis) prior to be used for prophylaxi...|$|E
40|$|Using a {{recently}} developed model {{for studying the}} biology of locally recurrent (LR) mammary tumours in the 13762 NF rat mammary adenocarcinoma system, we examined the sensitivity to polymorphonuclear cell, macrophage and natural killer cell cytolysis. The parental MTF 7 (T 20) cell line; the 'primary' tumours which arose following subcutaneous inoculation into the mammary fat pad, sc 1 and sc 3; and the local recurrences (following surgical excision) LR 1 and LR 1 a from sc 1, and LR 3 from sc 3 were all cells generally resistant to specific PMN cytolysis. LPS-activated macrophages caused 25. 1 %, 38. 7 % and 58. 8 % specific cytolysis in MTF 7, sc 1 and LR 1 cells, respectively at E:T of 20 : 1 and 72 h co-incubation. LR 1 a, sc 3 and LR 3 lysis ranged from 0 - 4. 4 % under the same conditions. Non-activated macrophages did not lyse any of the cell lines. Locally recurrent and 'primary' tumour cell lines were also not lysed by naive NK cells (range 0. 5 - 4. 0 % cytolysis). NK cells activated with <b>bropirimine,</b> a potent immunomodulator currently being studied in clinical trials, and/or interleukin- 2 were mildly more effective at killing LR cells. Our results show that locally recurrent tumours exhibit heterogeneous sensitivities and are different from 'primary' tumour cells in sensitivities to immune cell killing, {{but they are not}} necessarily more or less sensitive. Results with bropirimine-activated or IL- 2 -activated NK cells emphasize that nonspecific activation is insufficient to eliminate all tumour subpopulations...|$|E
40|$|Severe {{combined}} immunodeficient (SCID) mice {{were found}} to be highly susceptible to murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection. Treatment of infected mice with ganciclovir (12. 5, 25, and 50 mg/kg of body weight for 10 days) starting 24 h after virus challenge resulted in delays in death by 2 to 8 days, and no animals survived the infection. (S) - 1 -[3 -Hydroxy- 2 -(phosphonylmethoxy) propyl]cytosine (HPMPC) was much more potent, with doses of 1, 3. 2, and 10 mg/kg/day (for 10 days) increasing the mean survival time by 15 to 30 days. Twenty-day treatments with HPMPC starting 5 days after virus inoculation increased the mean survival time by 24 to 32 days, with once-weekly (50 -mg/kg) treatments being equivalent to daily (10 -mg/kg) treatments. Delays in the development of liver, lung, and spleen virus titers in ganciclovir- and HPMPC-treated groups correlated with extensions in the mean survival times relative to the survival times of the placebo controls. The two compounds were approximately equally toxic to uninfected BALB/c mice treated for 10 days, causing 80 to 100 % mortality after a dose of 150 mg/kg and 0 % mortality after a dose of 75 mg/kg. Thus, the relative therapeutic index of HPMPC was 50 -fold greater than that of ganciclovir. Recombinant alpha interferon delta 4 alpha 1 /alpha 2 (1 x 10 (4) and 5 x 10 (4) units per mouse per day) and <b>bropirimine</b> (100 and 300 mg/kg/day) provided no protection from the lethal MCMV infection. The severe combined immunodeficient mouse MCMV infection is an important new model that will permit chemotherapy regimens to be studied over several months...|$|E
40|$|Background: For {{more than}} 20 years, {{superficial}} bladder tumors {{have been demonstrated}} {{to be sensitive to}} several biological response modifiers and especially to immunomodulators. The best-known and studied immunomodulator is the bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG). However, despite its well-recognized efficacy, BCG is not a universal panacea and is associated with potentially significant side effects. Methods: New perspectives in BCG therapy aiming to increase BCG efficacy or to decrease side effects include the use of genetically engineered BCG strains producing cytokines as well as the use of purified BCG subcomponents. Because a cascade of immunological reactions including the secretion of several cytokines has been demonstrated in the BCG mode of action, many other biological response modifiers and especially immunomodulators have been studied for superficial transitional cell carcinoma therapy. Some were investigated in human trials, others are still in laboratory studies; some are administered intravesically whereas others are given orally. Interferon-α (IFN-α) intravesical instillations have been evaluated in several controlled studies. Results: Although toxicity of intravesical IFN is minimal, its optimal dose, schedule and efficacy remain to be defined. Recent prospective studies comparing IFN to BCG intravesical therapy have been somewhat disappointing although this cytokine may be effective in some patients with T(a) -T 1 disease who have failed BCG therapy. Other immunomodulators administered intravesically investigated in clinical studies include interleukin 2 (recently used in a clinical study with a marker tumor response), levamisole, Rubratin,a Nocardia rubra cell wall skeleton, and keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Several biological response modifiers administered orally such as vitamin A land its derivatives), Lactobacillus casei or <b>bropirimine</b> have been tested in clinical trials as well. In contrast, Allium sativum (garlic) or OK- 432 (a streptococcal preparation) or BCG subfractions have been tested in laboratory studies only. Conclusions: Published reports on several of these biological response modifiers suggest that these compounds may be an alternative in patients with superficial bladder cancer who have failed or have not tolerated BCG, but further evaluation to improve efficacy, durability and understand their mechanism of action is warranted.
