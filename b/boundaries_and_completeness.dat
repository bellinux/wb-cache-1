A self-adjoint linear operator A is defined in a suitable Hilbert space H such that the eigenvalues of such a problem coincide with those of A. We discuss asymptotic behavior of its eigenvalues <b>and</b> <b>completeness</b> of its eigenfunctions...|$|R

In his original announcement, Agmon [3] didn’t mention scattering. If one can decompose V=A^*B so that A, B: X^* → L^ 2 (perhaps after multiplication by (H_ 0 + 1)^- 1 / 2), then one {{can show that}} A, B are locally smooth for both H and H_ 0 on (0,∞ [...])∖E and so by Theorem  14.10, one gets existence <b>and</b> <b>completeness</b> (ideas due to Lavine [415, 417]).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the proposed criteria {{for measuring the}} quality <b>and</b> <b>completeness</b> of field spectroscopy metadata in a spectral archive. Definitions for metadata quality <b>and</b> <b>completeness</b> for field spectroscopy datasets are introduced. Unique methods for measuring quality <b>and</b> <b>completeness</b> of metadata {{to meet the requirements}} of field spectroscopy datasets are presented. Field spectroscopy metadata quality can be defined in terms of (but is not limited to) logical consistency, lineage, semantic and syntactic error rates, compliance with a quality standard, quality assurance by a recognized authority, and reputational authority of the data owners/data creators. Two spectral libraries are examined as case studies of operationalized metadata policies, {{and the degree to which}} they are aligned with the needs of field spectroscopy scientists. The case studies reveal that the metadata in publicly available spectral datasets are underperforming on the quality <b>and</b> <b>completeness</b> measures. This paper is part two in a series examining the issues central to a metadata standard for field spectroscopy datasets...|$|R
40|$|We {{give new}} {{formulations}} {{of the property}} of soundness <b>and</b> <b>completeness</b> of a resolution system and of the lifting lemma, and we discuss their relationship. The discussion points out why certain resolution systems are not complete, {{and that there is}} a simple method for showing that a resolution system is "absolutely incomplete" [...] that there is no notion of program completion and no logic which could give soundness <b>and</b> <b>completeness.</b> The method is demonstrated on the case of basic variants of the SLDNF-resolution. The same approach can be used to analyze other resolution systems. Keywords: soundness <b>and</b> <b>completeness,</b> lifting lemma, program completion, SLDNF-resolution. 1 Introduction One of the ideas underlying the development of logic programming is that programming should be to a greater extent declarative. Declarativeness of logic programming is characterized in a formal way, by so called, soundness <b>and</b> <b>completeness</b> properties. Many sound resolution systems have been proposed as po [...] ...|$|R
