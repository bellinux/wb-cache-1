40|$|This memo {{describes}} {{the design of}} a set of waveguide quadrature hybrids suitable for use in <b>balanced</b> and sideband-separating <b>mixers,</b> <b>balanced</b> amplifiers, and power combiners and dividers. The hybrids are of the branch-line type, which can be machined in a split block configuration on a CNC milling machine. The prototype designs are for the WR- 10 band (75 – 110 GHz), but the dimensions are chosen to allow scaling to any waveguide band up to ~ 700 GHz. The designs were optimized using a space mapping procedure, with a fast but approximate microwave circuit simulator (MMICAD) and a slower but accurate FDTD EM simulator (QuickWave). Introduction and Goals Quadrature hybrids are used in <b>balanced</b> <b>mixers</b> and amplifiers, sideband-separating mixers, and power dividers and combiners. In developing receivers for ALMA, waveguide quadrature hybrids have been proposed for power combining in the first LO system [1], and for a <b>balanced</b> sideband-separating SIS <b>mixer</b> [2]. The latter requires three RF quadrature hybrids, one for sideband separation and one for each of the component balance...|$|R
5000|$|A single <b>balanced</b> <b>mixer</b> is {{arranged}} {{with one of}} its inputs applied to a balanced (differential) circuit so that either the local oscillator (LO) or signal input (RF) is suppressed at the output, but not both.|$|E
5000|$|A double <b>balanced</b> <b>mixer</b> {{has both}} its inputs applied to {{differential}} circuits, so {{that neither of}} the input signals and only the product signal appears at the output. Double balanced mixers are more complex and require higher drive levels than unbalanced and single balanced designs.|$|E
50|$|Another form of mixer {{operates}} by switching, {{with the}} smaller input signal being passed inverted or non inverted {{according to the}} phase of the local oscillator (LO). This would be typical of the normal operating mode of a packaged double <b>balanced</b> <b>mixer,</b> with the local oscillator drive considerably higher than the signal amplitude.|$|E
40|$|Balanced {{receivers}} {{are under}} {{development at the}} Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (CSO) for the 230 / 460 GHz and 345 / 660 GHz atmospheric windows. The mixers are tunerless, implemented in a balanced configuration, have a 4 - 8 GHz IF, {{and can be used}} in dual frequency observation mode. As shall be seen, the balanced arrangement provides a high level of amplitude noise immunity and allows all of the available LO power to be used. In turn, this permits complete automation of the receivers by means of synthesized LO source(s). A disadvantage of <b>balanced</b> <b>mixers</b> is, perhaps, that the sidebands at the IF remain convolved (DSB), unlike sideband separating (2 SB) receivers. The latter, however are unbalanced and do not have the noise and LO injection advantages of <b>balanced</b> <b>mixers.</b> For the CSO, <b>balanced</b> <b>mixers</b> covering the range 180 - 720 GHz were judged most promising to facilitate many of the astrophysical science goals in the years to come. In parallel, a dual polarization 280 - 420 GHz continuous comparison (correlation) receiver is in an advanced state of development. The instrument has two beams on the sky; a reference and a signal beam. Using only cooled reflecting optics, two polarizing grids, and a quadrature hybrid coupler, the sky beams are coupled to four tunerless SIS mixers (both polarizations). The 4 - 12 GHz mixer IF outputs are, after amplification, correlated against each other. In principle, this technique results in flat baselines with very low RMS noise, and is especially well suited for high redshift Galaxy work. Not only do these changes greatly enhance the spectroscopic capabilities of the CSO, they will also enable the observatory to be integrated into the Harvard-Smithsonian Submillimeter Array (SMA), as an additional telescope...|$|R

40|$|The {{analysis}} of crosstalk between ports of integrated <b>balanced</b> <b>mixers</b> {{is difficult because}} the circuit is strongly nonlinear and the crosstalk depends on information which, if it is known at all, is not always provided by the foundry. This paper presents a general method for calculating mixer crosstalk. Device measurements are combined with periodic small-signal analysis to yield the crosstalk between any combination of mixer ports for arbitrary device sizes, terminations, and biases. An example shows {{the application of the}} procedure on predicting RF-LO crosstalk of aCMOSmixer. 1 INTRODUCTION <b>Balanced</b> integrated <b>mixers</b> have a high isolation between the ports. There are circumstances, however, in which extraordinary requirements are put on the port isolation. One notable example is the isolation from the RF input port to the LO input port of a mixer used for a direct conversion receiver. To prevent detection of amplitude modulated interferers this isolation must be as high as 60 dB [1] [...] ...|$|R
50|$|Using a <b>balanced</b> <b>mixer</b> {{a double}} side band signal is generated, this is then {{passed through a}} very narrow {{bandpass}} filter to leave only one side-band. By convention it is normal to use the upper sideband (USB) in communication systems, except for amateur radio when the carrier frequency is below 10 MHz. There the lower side band (LSB) is normally used.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the desired IF signal and its unwanted image (the mixing product of opposite sign above), the mixer output will also contain the two original frequencies, [...] and [...] and various harmonic combinations of the input signals. These undesired signals are rejected by the IF filter. If a double <b>balanced</b> <b>mixer</b> is employed, the input signals appearing at the mixer outputs are greatly attenuated, reducing the required complexity of the IF filter.|$|E
50|$|One {{method of}} {{reducing}} the potential for this transmitter defect {{is the use of}} balanced and double balanced mixers. A simple mixer will pass both of the input frequencies and all of their harmonics along with the sum and difference frequencies. If the simple mixer is replaced with a <b>balanced</b> <b>mixer</b> then the number of possible products is reduced. If the frequency mixer has fewer outputs the task of making sure that the final output is clean will be simpler.|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} a heterodyne experiment {{which uses a}} 380 - 520 GHz planar circuit balanced Nb-Al_ 2 O_ 3 -Nb superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) quasiparticle mixer with 4 - 8 GHz instantaneous intermediate frequency (IF) bandwidth to quantitatively determine local oscillator (LO) noise. A <b>balanced</b> <b>mixer</b> is a unique tool to separate noise at the mixer's LO port from other noise sources. This is not possible in single-ended mixers. The antisymmetric IV characteristic of a SIS mixer further helps to simplify the measurements. The double-sideband receiver sensitivity of the <b>balanced</b> <b>mixer</b> is 2 - 4 times the quantum noise limit hν/k_B over the measured frequencies with a maximum LO noise rejection of 15 dB. This work presents independent measurements with three different LO sources that produce the reference frequency but also an amount of near-carrier noise power which is quantified in the experiment {{as a function of}} the LO and IF frequency in terms of an equivalent noise temperature T_LO. In a second experiment we use only one of two SIS mixers of the <b>balanced</b> <b>mixer</b> chip, in order to verify the influence of near-carrier LO noise power on a single-ended heterodyne mixer measurement. We find an IF frequency dependence of near-carrier LO noise power. The frequency-resolved IF noise temperature slope is flat or slightly negative for the single-ended mixer. This is in contrast to the IF slope of the <b>balanced</b> <b>mixer</b> itself which is positive due to the expected IF roll-off of the mixer. This indicates a higher noise level closer to the LO's carrier frequency. Our findings imply that near-carrier LO noise has the largest impact on the sensitivity of a receiver system which uses mixers with a low IF band, for example superconducting hot-electron bolometer (HEB) mixers.

40|$|The {{development}} of single-chip transmitters and receivers is hindered by several obstacles. The main difficulties include the low quality factor of MMIC filters, limited output power of solid state devices at millimeter-wave frequencies, and poor frequency stability of monolithic oscillators. This research investigates novel techniques {{to overcome these}} challenges. The scope of work includes proposal of new circuit structures and techniques, theoretical analyses, MMIC realisations and experimental verifications with measured results. To reduce filtering requirements, single-ended and single-balanced resistive mixers, utilising a unique resonance technique to achieve port isolations, are developed for V-band direct conversion receivers. A double-balanced resistive mixer, with high input power capability to reduce output power amplification requirements is also developed for millimeter-wave transmitters. A distributed resistive mixer is proposed to achieve wideband performance with low intermodulation. As {{an alternative to the}} use of baluns for generating anti-phase signals required in <b>balanced</b> <b>mixers,</b> a <b>balanced</b> oscillator is introduced. This novel oscillator can also operate as a power combining oscillator to obtain higher output power. In addition, a transmission-line stabilising technique can be applied to improve the oscillator phase noise. For the analysis of mixer circuits, the large-signal / small-signal analysis technique is extended to the case of multiple device mixers. For baluns used in the <b>balanced</b> <b>mixers,</b> a simplified analysis is applied, leading to a new class of impedance transforming baluns, which can be matched at all ports.
