The <b>banner</b> <b>ad</b> was also unique, as compared to advertising appearing in then comparable media, such as newspapers and magazines. Unlike advertising in periodicals, the <b>banner</b> <b>ad</b> encouraged media consumers to actually leave the media service or product and go to a separate media environment (typically a Web site operated by the advertiser). In contrast, readers viewing newspaper or magazine advertising are not encouraged to leave the periodical. Rather, the message of the advertising is itself intended to influence the reader.|$|E

The focus was on health-related banner advertisements targeting senior citizens. The study first sought to determine the frequency of appearance of those ads when classified into categories of compliance-gaining tactics provided by research scholars. Second, the study explored the relative perceived effectiveness among those categories. Two graduate students from a Central Texas university sorted text messages into predetermined compliance-gaining categories. Chi square tests looked for significant differences in the frequencies of <b>banner</b> <b>ads</b> in each category. Forty-five senior citizens from the Central Texas area completed surveys regarding the perceived effectiveness of a randomly ordered, randomly selected set of categorized <b>banner</b> <b>ads.</b> A repeated measures test attempted to determine whether some compliance-gaining strategies used in health-related <b>banner</b> <b>ads</b> were perceived as more effective than others. The hypothesis stated that there would be differences in frequencies of compliance-gaining strategies used among the compliance-gaining categories in health-related <b>banner</b> <b>ads</b> for senior citizens. The hypothesis was supported. The research question asked if some categories of compliance-gaining strategies used in health-related <b>banner</b> <b>ads</b> were perceived as more effective than others by senior citizens. There was no evidence that senior citizens perceived any compliance-gaining category as being more effective than any other. However, post hoc analyses revealed trends in {{the types of}} compliance-gaining messages senior citizens perceived as more effective. These trends provide a basis for directional predictions in future studies...|$|R

The most surprising result is that recall was especially bad for animated banners.
