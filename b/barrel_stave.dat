5000|$|Farmers {{found the}} surface of the town uneven, its hard and rocky soil [...] "tolerably productive." [...] Outlets of ponds, however, {{provided}} Casco with good sites for water powered mills. The town had four sawmills, four gristmills, a shook mill, a <b>barrel</b> <b>stave</b> mill, four shingle factories, a carriage factory and a tannery. In 1832, the Cumberland and Oxford Canal made Sebago Lake a direct trade route to Portland. Steamboat travel commenced on the waterways in the 1840s, carrying tourists and freight.In 1938, Sebago Lake State Park was established, one of the state's five original state parks.|$|E

50|$|Statehood {{had caused}} the {{dissolution}} of the Choctaw Nation as a political entity, replaced by the creation of several counties of the new state of Oklahoma. Gavin fell within the boundaries of McCurtain County, Oklahoma. Idabel was chosen as the county seat, although Garvin then had the larger population. Its economic base was forest products, because of the dense forests in its vicinity. The town had several wood processing businesses creating job opportunities. There was a large sawmill, a veneering plant, a barrel hoop plant and a <b>barrel</b> <b>stave</b> plant. Whole logs could be shipped to other markets over several miles of a tramway that led south toward the Red River. Garvin's population rose to a peak of 957 in 2010, then dropped to only 293 at the 1920 census. Garvin never regained its previous growth. Meanwhile, its local rival, Idabel had surged ahead to a 1910 population of 1,493 and continued to 3,067 in 1920.|$|E
50|$|Farmers grew mostly hay, and {{the town}} became noted for cattle. Mills were {{established}} at 2 water power sites; these developed in the 19th-century into principal villages within the town, especially after {{the arrival of the}} Grand Trunk Railway in the 1850s. Welchville was located on the Little Androscoggin River, where the woolen textile mill of the Harper Manufacturing Company was established. At the outlet of Thompson Lake was Oxford village, first called Craigie's Mill for the sawmill and gristmill built by Andrew Craigie, a Boston apothecary and land speculator. This was also the site of a grisly murder that, to this day, goes unsolved. Here were erected a <b>barrel</b> <b>stave</b> mill, a shovel handle factory, and the woolen textile mills of the Robinson Manufacturing Company. The railroad brought seasonal tourists to Thompson Lake, where inns and hotels opened. Today, Oxford is a recreational area with fine architecture remaining from its prosperous mill town past. The Congregational Church, built in 1842-1843, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E

Her father was a teacher who moved to Maples to co-found a <b>barrel</b> <b>stave</b> factory. Her mother was a teacher. Fitch moved with her mother to Hopkinton, Massachusetts, {{to live with her}} father's patents as her father tried to recover from a {{financial}} setback from the Panic of 1873. Unhappy with the Hopkinton schools, the family moved to Kalamazoo, Michigan, in 1879.Fitch {{graduated from high school in}} 1883 and moved to Boston, Massachusetts, to attend the Museum of Fine Arts School. She met Dwight H. Perkins in her third year at the school. Fitch started to write children's fiction on a freelance basis for Young Folks. She graduated in 1886 and took a job as an illustrator for the Prang Educational Company of Boston. A year later, she followed Walter Scott Perry to the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York, to become his assistant. Fitch left on August 18, 1891, to marry Perkins and move to Chicago, Illinois.|$|E

40|$|Mammals protect {{themselves}} from inflammation triggered by microorganisms through secretion of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). One mechanism by which AMPs kill bacterial cells is perforating their membranes. Membrane interactions and pore formation were investigated for α-helical AMPs leading to the formulation of three basic mechanistic models: the <b>barrel</b> <b>stave,</b> toroidal, and carpet model. One major drawback of these models is their simplicity. They {{do not reflect the}} real in vitro and in vivo conditions. To challenge and refine these models using a structure-based approach we set out to investigate how human cathelicidin (LL- 37) and dermcidin (DCD) interact with membranes. Both peptides are α-helical and their structures have been solved at atomic resolution. DCD assembles in solution into a hexameric pre-channel complex before the actual membrane targeting and integration step can occur, and the complex follows a deviation of the <b>barrel</b> <b>stave</b> model. LL- 37 interacts with lipids and shows the formation of oligomers generating fibril-like supramolecular structures on membranes. LL- 37 further assembles into transmembrane pores with yet unknown structure expressing a deviation of the toroidal pore model. Both of their specific targeting mechanisms will be discussed {{in the context of the}} “old” models propagated in the literature...|$|E
40|$|Ceratotoxins are a-helical {{cationic}} peptides {{isolated from}} the medfly Ceratitis capitata. These amphipathic peptides were found to display strong antibacterial activity and weak hemolytic activity. When reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers, ceratotoxins developed highly asymmetric I/V curves under voltage ramps and formed, in single-channel experiments, well-defined voltage-dependent ion channels according to the <b>barrel</b> <b>stave</b> model. The antibacterial activity and pore-forming properties of these molecules were well correlated. Similar experiments performed with synthesized truncated fragments showed that the C-terminal domain of ceratotoxins, is strongly implicated {{in the formation of}} helical bundles in the membrane whereas the largely cationic N-terminal region is likely to anchor ceratotoxins on the lipid surface...|$|E
40|$|AGITTAL {{synostosis}} {{continues to}} constitute {{the most common}} type of craniosynostosis affecting infants. Since the introduction of surgical techniques for the management of scaphocephaly associated with this con-dition approximately 112 years ago, various procedures have been advocated and performed. During the last three decades, extensive craniectomies and cranial vault remod-eling have been popularized by craniofacial and neurolog-ical surgeons. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy, safety, complications, and outcomes associated with treat-ing patients with sagittal suture synostosis in whom en-doscopy-assisted wide-vertex craniectomies were per-formed with bitemporal and biparietal <b>barrel</b> <b>stave</b> osteotomies. Postoperatively custom-made cranial mold-ing helmets were placed to achieve and maintain normo-cephaly.

40|$|The {{cytotoxic}} cell granule secretory pathway {{is essential for}} host defense. This pathway is fundamentally a form of intracellular protein delivery where granule proteases (granzymes) from cytotoxic lymphocytes are thought to diffuse through <b>barrel</b> <b>stave</b> pores generated in the plasma membrane of the target cell by the pore forming protein perforin (PFN) and mediate apoptotic as well as additional biological effects. While recent electron microscopy and structural analyses indicate that recombinant PFN oligomerizes to form pores containing 20 monomers (20 nm) when applied to liposomal membranes, these pores are not observed by propidium iodide uptake in target cells. Instead, concentrations of human PFN that encourage granzyme-mediated apoptosis are associated with pore structures that unexpectedly favor phosphatidyl-serine flip-flop measured by Annexin-V and Lactadherin. Efforts that reduce PFN mediated Ca influx in targets did not reduce Annexin-V reactivity. Antigen specific mouse CD 8 cells initiate a similar rapid flip-flop in target cells. A lipid that augments plasma membrane curvature as well as cholesterol depletion in target cells enhance flip-flop. Annexin-V staining highly correlated with apoptosis after Granzyme B (GzmB) treatment. We propose the structures that PFN oligomers form in the membrane bilayer may include arcs previously observed by electron microscopy and that these unusual structures represent an incomplete mixture of plasma membrane lipid and PFN oligomers that may act as a flexible gateway for Gzm...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe membrane-lytic peptide melittin has {{previously}} been shown to form pores in lipid bilayers that have been {{described in terms of}} two different structural models. In the “barrel stave” model the bilayer remains more or less flat, with the peptides penetrating across the bilayer hydrocarbon region and aggregating to form a pore, whereas in the “toroidal pore” melittin induces defects in the bilayer such that the bilayer bends sharply inward to form a pore lined by both peptides and lipid headgroups. Here we test these models by measuring both the free energy of melittin transfer (ΔG°) and melittin-induced leakage as a function of bilayer elastic (material) properties that determine the energetics of bilayer bending, including the area compressibility modulus (Ka), bilayer bending modulus (kc), and monolayer spontaneous curvature (Ro). The addition of cholesterol to phosphatidylcholine (PC) bilayers, which increases Ka and kc, decreases both ΔG° and the melittin-induced vesicle leakage. In contrast, the addition to PC bilayers of molecules with either positive Ro, such as lysoPC, or negative Ro, such as dioleoylglycerol, has little effect on ΔG°, but produces large changes in melittin-induced leakage, from 86 % for 8 : 2 PC/lysoPC to 18 % for 8 : 2 PC/dioleoylglycerol. We observe linear relationships between melittin-induced leakage and both Ka and 1 /Ro 2. However, in contrast to what would be expected for a <b>barrel</b> <b>stave</b> model, there is no correlation between observed leakage and bilayer hydrocarbon thickness. All of these results demonstrate the importance of bilayer material properties on melittin-induced leakage and indicate that the melittin-induced pores are defects in the bilayer lined in part by lipid molecules...|$|E
