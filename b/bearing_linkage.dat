Positioning precision and stability are especially critical when the supported mirror directs a high-intensity beam aimed at a distant target.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} {{of a novel}} family of acetylenic cyclophanes via Pd, Cu and Zn catalyzed cross-coupling reactions is described. The cyclophanes were constructed in good yields and X-ray crystal analysis revealed a twisted helical geometry. The nature of the geometry {{and the ability to}} complex solvent molecules within the lattice varied upon the number of acetylenic linkages present. Functionalized cyclophanes bearing long alkyl chains based on the helical structures 191 and 213 were also synthesized with potential as novel liquid crystals. Cyclophane 280 showed LC-like behavior when melting was observed under a polarized light microscope. Intramolecular cyclization of paracyclophanes was observed and resulted in cyclophanes, 192 and 203. X-ray crystallographic analysis of the carboxylic acid derivative, 203 revealed the strained nature of the butadiyne bridge. The triple bonds were distorted with bond angles of 163. 7 ° and 163. 5 °. A novel method for the {{synthesis of}} diynes and tetraynes using an in situ desilylation/dimerization procedure was developed but was unsuccessful in producing linear hexaynes. Attempted dimerization of 281 for the synthesis of 282 failed due to a competing intramolecular producing 283. Derivative 307 revealed another highly strained butadiyne bridge possessing bond angles of 164. 1 ° and 153. 4 °. Metacyclophanes with a termini separation of approximately between 7. 8 and 10 A did not undergo intramolecular cyclization. A sequential coupling procedure involving a double dimerization of acetylenes produced traces of the desired cyclophane 282 and no competing intramolecular cyclization products were observed. Progress towards 327, a structural isomer of 282, using an alternative sequential coupling protocol involving a double Sonogashira cyclization is detailed. Attempts to prepare acetylenic cyclophanes <b>bearing</b> metaphenyl/acetylene <b>linkages</b> are described.

Various synthetic schemes were developed {{for the inclusion of}} thiourea moieties along with other desired linkages in these polymers. The designed monomers (dinitro, diamines, dicarboxylic acids, diacid chlorides, diols and diisocyanates) <b>bearing</b> pre-formed <b>linkages</b> were then synthesized and employed for the preparation of novel thiourea-based polymeric materials. The incorporation of different functional groups provides an opportunity to control certain physical properties such as solvent miscibility, ηinh, crystallinity, molecular weight, thermal stability and flame retardancy of the resulting polymers. The effect of thiourea and other functional groups on the properties of newly synthesized polymers were scrutinized together with their structure-property relationship. Major tools utilized for the examination of polymer properties are FTIR, 1 H NMR, solubility, viscometry, GPC, TGA, DSC and XRD. Novel thiourea-based polymers demonstrated outstanding thermal stability without deteriorating their organosolubility or processability. Another objective of the work was to evaluate the expedient applications and potential relevance of these valuable high-performance materials for advanced technologies. The processable pol (thiourea-amide) s, poly(thioureaamide imide) s, poly(thiourea-ether-imide) s and poly(urethane-azomethine-thiourea) s were found to have superior thermal stability as well as non-flammability. Poly(phenylthiourea-azomethineimide) s having C=S and –C=N– moieties can act as imminent contenders to fabricate certain electrically conducting materials. Poly(thiourea-amide) s, in addition to the excellent solubility and thermal resistance, can be employed as solid extracting phases for the elimination of environmentally toxic metal ions from aqueous media. Prior to this effort, reported in peerreviewed journals, synthesis of high temperature polymers bearing C=S entity was an unexplored area. Easy processability, high molar mass, heat and flame stability, electrical conductivity, etc, depict their high adaptability in future, rendering them backbone materials in polymer science...|$|R
40|$|PhDThe work {{presented}} {{involves the}} theoretical and {{experimental studies of}} the kinematic and dynamic effects of <b>bearing</b> clearance in <b>linkage</b> mechanisms. In the test mechanism developed a six-bar linkage, having a test plain bearing, is oscillated at amplitude of 17. 5 mm within the frequency range 4 - 7 Hz. A transducer assembly is {{used to measure the}} impact accelerations which are related to clearance size, mass distribution, spring load and excitation configuration, (the vibrators are independently phased). The motion-analysis of the test mechanism including clearance at a bearing is described using Lagrangian mechanics. The behaviour of the system is obtained by solving the coupled time-dependent equations using Kutta-Merson integration procedure. The method proves to be lengthy in computation time and not easily applied in design. Further, it is shown that there is little difference, in a gross sense, between the results so found and results obtained assuming no bearing clearance. An empirical formula relating the three parameters, clearance size, the rate of change of contact position and the corresponding minimum reaction force is derived from the no-clearance analysis. The. variation of this empirical relationship with excitation frequency is found to be similar to that obtained for the experimental impact levels. Thus it may be used to describe the impact accelerations and its numerical significance as a design criterion is suggested. The experimental work also demonstrates that the pattern of the impact levels remains unchanged when the bearing is oil film lubricated. Some simple design guides using the empirical relationship on a four-bar chain are suggested and general application from a practical point of view is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Pipecolidepsin A is a cyclodepsipeptide {{produced}} by a Homophymia marine sponge that has shown interesting anticancer properties against several human cancer cell lines. From a structural point of view, it is a “head-to-side-chain” cyclodepsipeptide, in which the ester bond links the C-terminal and the side-chain of the unprecedented amino acid AHDMHA. This linkage provides a beta-branched arrangement that comprises a 25 -membered macrolactone, and an exocyclic peptidic arm terminated with a polyketide moiety. Furthermore, Pipecolidepsin A contains up to 6 synthetic building blocks with several potential side reactions during the SPPS. The syntheses of the suitable protected derivatives of the amino acids L-threo-beta-EtO-Asn, AHDMHA and DADHOHA have been developed in our laboratory. Additionally, an already described procedure to synthesize the beta-hydroxyacid HTMHA was also adapted and reproduced. The biggest synthetic challenge of Pipecolidepsin A’s synthesis is {{the construction of the}} ester bond over an extremely hindered secondary alcohol. Thus, incorporation of the Alloc-pipecolic-OH moiety was studied at different growing stages of the peptide chain, meaning, after coupling of Fmoc-AHDMHA-OH, Fmoc-diMeGln-OH and Fmoc-DADHOHA(Acetonide, Trt) -OH residues. Moreover, when developing the synthetic scheme, some main potential side reactions and synthetic challenges were considered: consecutive coupling of extremely bulky residues, racemization, intramolecular lactamization of unprotected beta-amino diMe-Gln, aspartimides formation and dehydration to nitrile of the unprotected side-chain amides. A robust and reproducible synthetic strategy for Pipecolidepsin A has been developed for the first time. The chemical, structural and biological equivalence between natural and synthetic Pipecolidepsin A has been satisfactorily proved by means of HPLC-PDA co-elution, 1 H and 13 C NMR spectral assignment comparison, and biological evaluation of both compounds employing a colorimetric assay based on the sulforhodamine B reaction. Importantly, the synthetic scheme has been proved useful to provide straightforward access to analogs that will facilitate valuable structure-activity relationships (SARs). In addition, the synthesis of the cytotoxic proline-rich peptide Phakellistatin 19 was successfully achieved by using a combination of solid-phase and solution techniques. After chemical and spectral validation of the synthetic compound, biological evaluation revealed that synthetic Phakellistatin 19 did not display the same cytotoxicity of the natural counterpart. Thus, two different hypotheses were suggested and studied. The first one points out that preparations of natural Phakellistatins could contain a spectrally undetectable amount of a contamination (structurally related, eg. an epimer, or a totally different compound), which would be responsible for the biological activity. The second one argue that the presence of several Pro residues capable of cis-trans isomerism in a constrained macrocycle provides structures with a complex conformational profile. Individual conformers at Pro <b>linkages</b> <b>bearing</b> different biological properties could be stabilized in different conditions. Dos productes naturals marins de naturalesa peptídica han estat sintetitzats i estudiats estructuralment en la present tesi doctoral. El Pipecolidepsin A és un ciclodepsipèptid “cap-cadena lateral” que ha mostrat uns valors de citotoxicitat molt prometedors. Té una disposició estructural molt característica en la que un enllaç èster uneix l’extrem carboxil-terminal amb la cadena lateral de l’aminoàcid AHDMHA, originant d’aquesta manera una macrolactona de 25 membres i un braç peptídic exocíclic acabat amb un beta-hidroxiàcid. A més a més, la seva complexitat sintètica es veu incrementada per la presència en la seva estructura de fins a 6 aminoàcids sintètics no comercials. Les síntesis dels derivats correctament protegits dels residus L-threo-beta-EtO-Asn, AHDMHA, DADHOHA i HTMHA han estat desenvolupades i verificades al nostre laboratori. L’etapa crítica de la síntesi del Pipecolidepsin A és la formació de l’enllaç èster sobre un alcohol extremadament impedit. A més a més, són moltes les reaccions secundàries associades als diferents residus sintètics (deshidratació d’amides laterals a nitrils, racemització, formació d’aspartimides, lactamització intramolecular del residu DiMe-Gln quan l’amina està desprotegida [...] .). Tot això es tindrà en compte durant el desenvolupament i validació de l’estratègia sintètica que donarà accés al Pipecolidepsin A, i obrirà la porta a la síntesi d’altres anàlegs i compostos relacionats. El Phakellistatin 19 és un pèptid cíclic homodètic ric en residus prolina. Un esquema sintètic que combina fase sòlida i solució ha estat satisfactòriament desenvolupat. No obstant i malgrat haver verificat l’equivalència química i espectral del Phakellistatin 19 sintètic, aquest no presenta el mateix comportament biològic que el natural. La possibilitat que una impuresa (en especial un epimer) espectralment no detectable sigui la responsable de la citotoxicitat, o bé que la presència de residus Pro capaços d’establir un equilibri cis-trans real generin un complex equilibri conformacional en el que els diferents confòrmers tinguin un perfil biològic diferent, han estat extensivament estudiades...|$|R
