25|$|The German {{defenders}} {{had prepared}} {{the area with}} blockhouses, minefields, barbed wire, and booby-traps, hidden by the snow. There were also numerous bunkers in the area, mostly belonging to the deep defenses of the Siegfried Line, which were also centers of resistance. The dense forest allowed infiltration and flanking attacks and it was sometimes difficult to establish a front line or to <b>be</b> <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> an area had been cleared of the enemy. The small numbers of routes and clearings had also allowed German machine-gun, mortar and artillery teams to pre-range their weapons and fire accurately. Apart from the bad and very cold weather, the dense forest and rough terrain also prevented proper use of the Allied air superiority, which presented great difficulties in spotting any targets.|$|E
25|$|Philosophy is {{sometimes}} {{described as a}} life of reason, with normal human reason pursued in a more consistent and dedicated way than usual. Two categories of problem concerning reason have long been discussed by philosophers concerning reason, essentially being reasonings about reasoning itself as a human aim, or philosophizing about philosophizing. The first question is concerning whether we can <b>be</b> <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> reason can achieve knowledge of truth better than other ways of trying to achieve such knowledge. The other question is whether a life of reason, a life that aims to be guided by reason, {{can be expected to}} achieve a happy life more so than other ways of life (whether such a life of reason results in knowledge or not).|$|E

25|$|The 6th impression's blue-green is medium {{light and}} {{distinctly}} blue. The 7th impression's khaki binding, {{on the other}} hand, shows no hint of blue or green. Its color is considerably darker than the 10th through 12th impressions. The rust color of the 7th impression seems slightly darker than the 8th. Also, the 7th is lacquered whereas the 8th is not, which probably accounts for the color difference. The covers on the 10th through 12th impressions {{are very similar to}} each other, lighter than the 6th impression, and contain no distinctly blue cast. The 10th impression might be slightly lighter than the 12th, and the 12th might be slightly lighter than the 11th. However, not enough copies have been seen to <b>be</b> <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> the differences apply across each entire printing. The 14th impression is a heavily saturated grass green, distinctive and unmistakable. The grain of the cloth is finer and has been lacquered to smoothness.|$|E
25|$|Nasir al-Dawla {{had reason}} to <b>be</b> <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> he could defeat Mu'izz al-Dawla if he made an attempt to capture Baghdad. His army had been bolstered {{by the arrival of}} {{numerous}} Turkish soldiers who had fled from Baghdad just before Mu'izz al-Dawla's entrance into the capital, and he was much more familiar with the territory between Mosul and Baghdad than his rival was. Mu'izz al-Dawla, on the other hand, was on less secure ground; Baghdad was in a sorry state thanks to years of mismanagement and he was hamstrung by its numerous financial and military problems. Nasir al-Dawla furthermore gained a pretext for war when in January 946 Mu'izz al-Dawla deposed and blinded the caliph al-Mustakfi and replaced him with the more obedient al-Muti'. As a result of these factors, Nasir al-Dawla took a belligerent tone with the Buyids; he withheld the payment of tribute to Baghdad, refused to recognize al-Muti' as caliph and continued to mint coins in al-Mustakfi's name.|$|E
25|$|Inventory credit {{refers to}} the use of stock, or inventory, as {{collateral}} to raise finance. Where banks may be reluctant to accept traditional collateral, for example in developing countries where land title may be lacking, inventory credit is a potentially important way of overcoming financing constraints. This is not a new concept; archaeological evidence suggests that it was practiced in Ancient Rome. Obtaining finance against stocks {{of a wide range of}} products held in a bonded warehouse is common in much of the world. It is, for example, used with Parmesan cheese in Italy. Inventory credit on the basis of stored agricultural produce is widely used in Latin American countries and in some Asian countries. A precondition for such credit is that banks must <b>be</b> <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> the stored product will be available if they need to call on the collateral; this implies the existence of a reliable network of certified warehouses. Banks also face problems in valuing the inventory. The possibility of sudden falls in commodity prices means that they are usually reluctant to lend more than about 60% of the value of the inventory at the time of the loan.|$|E

500|$|... a. [...] According to Edward Cohen, {{professor}} of Classics at the University of Pennsylvania, Cleoboule {{was the daughter}} of a Scythian woman and of an Athenian father, Gylon, although other scholars insist on the genealogical purity of Demosthenes. There is an agreement among scholars that Cleoboule was a Crimean and not an Athenian citizen. Gylon had suffered banishment {{at the end of the}} Peloponnesian War for allegedly betraying Nymphaeum in Crimaea. According to Aeschines, Gylon received as a gift from the Bosporan rulers a place called [...] "the Gardens" [...] in the colony of Kepoi in present-day Russia (located within two miles (3km) of Phanagoria). Nevertheless, the accuracy of these allegations is disputed, since more than seventy years had elapsed between Gylon's possible treachery and Aeschines' speech, and, therefore, the orator could <b>be</b> <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> his audience would have no direct knowledge of events at Nymphaeum.|$|E

2500|$|Words {{are easy}} to fake. Should they {{turn out to be}} lies, {{listeners}} will adapt by ignoring them in favour of hard-to-fake indices or cues. For language to work, then, listeners must <b>be</b> <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> those with whom they are on speaking terms are generally likely to be honest. A peculiar feature of language is [...] "displaced reference", which means reference to topics outside the currently perceptible situation. This property prevents utterances from being corroborated in the immediate [...] "here" [...] and [...] "now". For this reason, language presupposes relatively high levels of mutual trust in order to become established over time as an evolutionarily stable strategy. A theory of the origins of language must therefore explain why humans could begin trusting cheap signals in ways that other animals apparently cannot (see signalling theory).|$|E

From this hypothesis he contrasted 2 Thessalonians 3:5 and 1 Thessalonians 3:13, and contended that the letter was written after Paul's death. Contrariwise Nicholl has put forward an argument for the authenticity of Second Thessalonians. He argues that 'the pseudonymous view is ... more vulnerable than most of its advocates conceded. ... The lack of consensus regarding a date and destination ... reflects a dilemma for this position: on the one hand, the date needs to be early enough for the letter to have been accepted as Pauline ... the other hand, the date and destination need to be such that the author could <b>be</b> <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> no contemporary of 1 Thessalonians ... could have exposed 2 Thessalonians as a ... forgery.' ...|$|E

Nevertheless, there has been considerable individual speculation on the matter."

The (British) Foreign Office had retorted that the Tudeh was no real threat. But, in August 1953, when the Foreign Office echoed the Eisenhower administration's claim that the Tudeh was about to take over, Acheson now retorted that there was no such communist danger. Acheson was honest enough to admit that the issue of the Tudeh was a smokescreen.|$|E

2500|$|In August 1628, Buckingham was assassinated, {{leaving a}} gap {{at the royal}} court. Henrietta Maria's {{relationship}} with her husband promptly began to improve and the two forged deep bonds of love and affection, marked by various jokes played by Henrietta Maria on Charles. Henrietta Maria became pregnant {{for the first time}} in 1628 but lost her first child shortly after birth in 1629, following a very difficult labour. In 1630, the future Charles II was born successfully, however, following another complicated childbirth by the noted physician Theodore de Mayerne. By now, Henrietta Maria had effectively taken over Buckingham's role as Charles's closest friend and advisor. Despite the ejection of the French staff in 1626, Charles's court was heavily influenced by French society; French was usually used in preference to English, being considered a more polite language. Additionally, Charles would regularly write letters to Henrietta Maria addressed [...] "Dear Heart." [...] These letters showcase the loving nature of their relationship. For example, on 11 January 1645 Charles wrote, [...] "And dear Heart, thou canst not but <b>be</b> <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> there is no danger which I will not hazzard, or pains that I will not undergo, to enjoy the happiness of thy company" ...|$|E
