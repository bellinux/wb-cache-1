40|$|Abstract — The Existing {{domestic}} {{energy meter}} reading systems universally exist many problems, such as difficulty in construction, too narrow bandwidth, too low rate, poor real time, not two-way communication quickly etc. To solve above problems, this project uses the wireless technology for Automatic Meter Reading system. We are introducing {{a new way}} of communication between the EB section and the consumer using ZIGBEE technology for transmitting the customer’s electricity consumption and <b>bill</b> <b>information</b> that is calculated using PIC microcontroller. The power fluctuations are monitored using the voltage sensor and current sensor and fed to the microcontroller which indicates it to the Electricity Board. Depending on the power generation, the house hold devices are controlled automatically. From EB section the <b>information</b> regarding the <b>bill</b> amount and payment are communicated to the consumer via GSM. This facilitates the consumer such that he can request for the <b>bill</b> <b>information</b> any time by sending a message to the monitoring section...|$|R
