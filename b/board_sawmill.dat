40|$|Reduction in the {{rotation}} ages of softwood saw log plantations in South Africa is causing increased proportions of low stiffness sawn lumber at final harvest. It has been shown for some species that the microfibril angle (MFA) of the S 2 layer of tracheids is strongly related to the modulus of elasticity (MOE) of wood, {{even more so than}} wood density, especially in wood formed during juvenile growth. The objectives of this study were to describe the variation in MFA in young Pinus patula trees and to determine the relationship between MFA and the dynamic MOE of sawn Pinus patula lumber. Thirty 16 - 20 year old trees from six compartments from the Mpumalanga escarpment were processed into discs and lumber. MFA, density and ring width were measured at two height levels using Silviscan 3. The average annual ring MFA varied between 7 o and 29 o; the pattern of variation depending mainly on height level and the ring number from the pith. The MFA in P. patula followed the same within-tree variation trends as in New Zealand-grown Pinus radiata but the average MFA was lower in absolute terms and differences between height levels were less pronounced. MFA and density exhibited highly significant Pearson correlations of 0. 73 and 0. 70 respectively with board dynamic MOE. A multiple regression model, which included MFA, density and ring width, explained 71 % of the variation in the dynamic MOE of boards. A sensitivity analysis on the model showed that MFA and density had approximately similar influences on predicting the dynamic MOE of Pinus patula <b>boards.</b> <b>Sawmilling</b> South Africa and the NRF’s THRIP programme.

50|$|Prior to the {{invention}} of the <b>sawmill,</b> <b>boards</b> were rived (split) and planed, or more often sawn by two men with a whipsaw, using saddleblocks to hold the log, and a saw pit for the pitman who worked below. Sawing was slow, and required strong and hearty men. The topsawer had to be the stronger of the two because the saw was pulled in turn by each man, and the lower had the advantage of gravity. The topsawyer also had to guide the saw so that the board was of even thickness. This was often done by following a chalkline.|$|R

50|$|A sawmill or lumber mill is a {{facility}} where logs are cut into lumber. Before {{the invention of}} the <b>sawmill,</b> <b>boards</b> were made in various manual ways, either rived (split) and planed, hewn, or more often hand sawn by two men with a whipsaw, one above and another in a saw pit below. The earliest known mechanical mill is the Hierapolis sawmill, a Roman water-powered stone mill at Hierapolis, Asia Minor dating back to the 3rd century AD. Other water-powered mills followed and by the 11th century they were widespread in Spain and North Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia, and in the next few centuries, spread across Europe. The circular motion of the wheel was converted to a reciprocating motion at the saw blade. Generally, only the saw was powered, and the logs had to be loaded and moved by hand. An early improvement was the development of a movable carriage, also water powered, to move the log steadily through the saw blade.|$|R

The task is challenging due to the changing appearance of boards during the process. These are changes in color, texture and physical form. Lighting conditions and camera parameters are also unknown and can change between different camera systems inside a sawmill. Before matching, image alignment is carried out using 2 -D to 1 -D projection signals. Signals are generated using the statistical properties of gray scale images. Aligned images are then matched using fast and compact local descriptors. The performance of the system was evaluated using over 1000 real life images captured with visual quality control cameras integrated into the production line. A tracing accuracy over 95 % was achieved with a high confidence of the individual match. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between annual softwood sawmill production and lumber processing variables was ex-amined {{using data from}} Sawmill Improvement Program (SIP) studies of 650 softwood mills. The variables were lumber recovery factor (LRF); headrig and resaw kerf width; total sawing variation, rough green size, and oversizing-undersizing for 4 / 4 and 8 / 4 lumber; planer allowance; and average log diameter and length. All variables except planer allowance and average log di-ameter were significantly influenced by annual sawmill production. The conversion efficiency of the mills in terms of most of these variables increased as sawmill size increased but decreased at annual production levels approaching or exceeding 100 million <b>board</b> feet. Study <b>sawmills</b> were grouped by geographic region and annual production class.

Bell was brave, too, as well as energetic. Once Thrums had been overrun with thieves. It is now thought {{that there may have}} been only one, but he had the wicked cleverness of a gang. Such was his repute that there were weavers who spoke of locking their doors when they went from home. He was not very skilful, however, being generally caught, and when they said they knew he was a robber he gave them their things back and went away. If they had given him time there is no doubt that he would have gone off with his plunder. One night he went to T'nowhead, and Bell, who slept in the kitchen, was wakened by the noise. She knew who it would be, so she rose and dressed herself, and went to look for him with a candle. The thief had not known what to do when he got in, and as it was very lonely he was glad to see Bell. She told him he ought to be ashamed of himself, and would not let him out by the door until he had taken off his boots so as not to soil the carpet.|$|R

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The goal of this work {{was to develop a}} life cycle {{inventory}} for the production of dimension lumber manufactured in the Southeast region of the US. The target audience are those interested in further life cycle analyses which involve lumber. Approximately one third of the softwood lumber consumed in the United States is produced from southern yellow pine. An estimated 400 mills across 13 southern states currently produce between 16 and 17 billion <b>board</b> feet annually. <b>Sawmill</b> production is concentrated in the states of Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana, which are described as the Southeast Region in this report. These four states account for 51 % of the lumber produced in the South. Harvesting restrictions in the western United States have shifted production and demand for softwood lumber to the South, with the result that over the last decade softwood lumber production in the South increased by 31 % while production in the West declined by 17 %. Nine sawmills were identified {{with the assistance of the}} Southern Forest Products Association as typical large production pine mills in the southeast. A large production sawmill was defined as having at least 75, 000 thousand board feet (Mbf) of production per year. Surveys following the CORRIM research guidelines were sent to each of the nine mills. Four surveys were returned, two from bandmill operations and one each from curve saw and chip and saw operations. The combined total production was approximately 555, 500 Mbf and represents 9. 4 % of the tota...|$|R

40|$|The Irish {{government}} has undertaken to reduce national CO 2 emissions through {{a range of}} measures put out in their Biomass Action Plan and the National Renewable Energy Action Plan. The conversion of peat fired power plants to co-fire with renewable biomass is one of these. This paper considers how the adoption of sweeping policies impact on other actors presently supplying or utilizing woody biomass resources. The SAWMILL sector (18 <b>sawmills),</b> <b>BOARD</b> sector, 3 board plants, and ENERGY sector (3 peat fired power stations) were included in a Linear Programming (LP) based transportation study. Specific transport costs between each residue producing <b>sawmill</b> and each <b>board</b> and energy plant were modeled and used in finding the minimum delivered cost {{for a number of}} scenarios. Scenario 2015 represented the status quo, while Scenario 2030 represented a situation with 30 % co-firing with woody biomass equivalents in the energy plants. For each time horizon, the problem was solved from the perspective of society at large (GLOBAL), {{for the benefit of the}} board sector (BOARD) or with emphasis on minimizing the cost to the energy sector (ENERGY). The cost of transporting alternative sources of renewable energy was varied between € 100 and € 500 TJ− 1. Results showed how overall supply costs increase with increasing alternative energy cost, but also how the dynamics between sectors focus worked. The cost of transport to the Energy sector ranged from € 306, 043 to € 996, 842 in Scenario 2015, while the increased demand in 2030 led to a range of between € 1, 132, 831 and € 4, 926, 040, depending on the alternative cost selected. For the Board sector, whose absolute demand remained constant, the total transport cost ranged between € 868, 506 and € 3, 454, 916 in Scenario 2015. The unchanged demand showed that the transport costs also remained the same for the 2030 Scenario, however, the optimization focusing on the Energy sector, increased the delivery cost to the Board sector by up to € 693, 730 per year by 2015 and € 842, 271 per year by 2030, indicating how intervention would be necessary if political ambitions of a 30 % co-firing should happen without detriment to other important wood based industries...|$|R
40|$|The {{properties}} of Norwegian timber varies greatly, but no quality sorting is done before the logs are sawn to <b>boards</b> at the <b>sawmills.</b> This means that {{large amounts of}} timber with wide variation in quality pass through the grading system, resulting in a smaller yield in the higher strength classes. The requirements for structural timber are getting higher due to stricter safety margins in new standards. Still, forest owners are only rewarded by the volume the timber contains, and not based upon {{the strength of the}} timber. Thus, forest owners don't focus on which strength classes the timber belongs to during harvesting which causes a grading loss in higher strength classes. To meet the requirements from producers and customers, a more correct description of the timber is of importance. To achieve this, an earlier sorting and a more precise prediction of the wood properties is necessary. In this study, the timber properties are predicted by forest inventory data to investigate the potential of presorting by the use of variable at site, tree and log level. Density, modulus of elasticity (MOE) and modulus of rupture (MOR) were measured on 1206 boards from 205 Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) trees, sampled from 14 sites in south-eastern Norway. The variability of the properties was analyzed in linear mixed models where the random variance was divided into site variance, tree variance and residual variance. Variables at stand level, tree level, log level and board level were treated as fixed effects, and added as covariates to the model. For density, relative log height in tree (Hrel), expressed as the ratio of the position of one log to the total tree height, was the most important fixed effect, and density increased with increasing relative log height. For MOE, both the H/D-ratio, defined as the ratio of tree height to DBH of each selected tree, DBH and the interaction between Hrel and DBH were important fixed effects. MOE increased with increasing H/D-ratio and interaction between Hrel and DBH, while it decreased with increasing DBH. For MOR, DBH was the most important fixed effect, and MOR decreased with increasing DBH. Variance due to site accounts for a smaller proportion of the total variance in MOE and MOR than in density, while the within-tree variance accounts for a larger proportion of the variance in MOE and MOR than in density. Density is better explained than MOE and MOR at stand level, while this difference is much smaller, and partly opposite when also tree and log variables are included. This is probably because the density varies quite a lot at stand level, while MOE and MOR are also influenced by knots and other defects which may vary between trees and within trees. Since the strength properties are explained differently on stand, tree and log level, this means that the potential for sorting at different levels are not equal for density, MOE and MOR. For density, variables at stand, tree and log level reduced the site and tree variance {{to a greater extent than}} IP-value from Dynagrade. For MOE and MOR, variables at stand, tree and log level alone did not reduce the site and tree variance to a greater extent than IP-value, but the contribution from these variables improved the grading in combination with Dynagrade. Presorting using forest inventory data has the potential of improving the grading yield, but an implementation in the forest industry will require great effort and a desire from the entire value chain to be feasible.

5000|$|The Fairwood {{area was}} {{settled in the}} late 1880s with coal mining, farming and {{ranching}} as the major activities. In those times, transportation was limited, especially in the winter. There were several lakeside resorts used by Seattle area residents for fishing and day trips. Indians and early settlers found the Cedar River which runs through the valley below Fairwood to be the shortest route from Puget Sound to Eastern Washington. The valley, north of the library, was heavily wooded with narrow and rough trails making travel difficult. The lack of a direct route and {{the condition of the}} trails, muddy in winter and rocky in summer, hindered settlement along the valley. [...] As early as 1870, Martin Cavanaugh discovered coal in the area now bordered by 196th SE and the Maple Valley Highway just below Cedar Mountain in eastern Fairwood. In 1882 the Black Diamond Coal Company of California surveyed the Cedar River Valley for coal and found enough good prospects to warrant a search and the financing of a railroad. They ended up selling the rail rights to Henry Villard of the Northern Pacific who developed the railroad under the name of Columbia & Puget Sound Railway. In 1904 this railway was sold to the Pacific Coast Coal Company which later became part of the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul electrified line. With development of the railway came settlers, many of whom worked in the mines and lived in small cedar shacks on hillsides and along the river. In 1884 James M. Colman began to mine the Cedar Mountain area, and his family helped to start and operate the small town of Cedar Mountain. It consisted of a store, hotel, <b>boarding</b> house, <b>sawmill,</b> post office, a couple of saloons and many small homes. The children who lived {{at the top of the}} mountain went to two schools: Cedar Mountain and Crosson. Crosson was located at the present intersection of 196th and Shadow Lake Road and has since been remodeled into a residence. One of the first known buildings in the Fairwood area is the Elliott Dairy Farm. It is a complex of eight buildings associated with the dairy farm of Robert James Elliott. The complex includes a large Craftsman-style dwelling, three barns, a feed house, milk house, equipment shed, and a carriage house with attached garage. It is the last remaining intact dairy farm in the area, as well as being the longest operating farm in the area. The dairy farm operated from 1906 to 1968, when the Elliott's grandson sold off the herd. Beef cattle were on the property until the early 1970s after which all farming operations ended. Since 1983 the house has been vacant, but it has been designated a King County Historical Landmark. In the vicinity of the Elliott farm there was a train stop known as Elliott Station (not named after Robert Elliott). This railroad stop was along the railway owned and operated by the Pacific Coast Coal Company. The first school in the area was built near the Elliott farm and opened on November 8, 1885. All eight grades were taught in the schoolhouse and attendance ranged from two to two dozen. The school became part of the Renton School District in 1942 and closed its doors in 1962. The building was purchased by William Veenhuizen in 1947 and moved back to their farm which is located a short distance from the Elliott farm. William Veenhuizen is a long-time resident of the Fairwood area and was born in the farm to which he moved the schoolhouse. The school has since been turned into apartments. [...] The Aqua Barn Ranch, a large white, two story farmhouse with green shutters, is also one of the oldest structures in the Fairwood. In 1894 Samuel and Mary Denny bought 40 acres of what would eventually become the Aqua Barn Ranch. Samuel was a cousin of Arthur Denny, one of Seattle's founders. His wife, Mary, was the youngest daughter of Carson Boren, another early Seattle pioneer. They built a small farmhouse on the property and in 1889 sold it to Lars and Sine Hansen. Albert Hansen, the son of Lars and Sine, and his wife, Janette, moved into the house in 1916 and remodeled it as it appears today. They continued to operate the dairy until 1945 until their daughter, Mrs. Helen Flynn, and her husband took over the property in the 1950s. They turned the 60 acres of land and buildings into a rural recreation center which is still in operation today. The Madsen farm, close by the Hansen property, housed the first post office in the area near the Elliott train stop. the Aqua Barn and the Elliot Farm buildings remain standing along the Maple Valley Highway, as reminders of the early days. Benson Highway, one of the major roads in the Fairwood area, is named after John H. Benson. In 1906 John and Elmer, his brother, bought several tracts of land in an area platted as Spring Glen Acre Tracts. They moved into an old homestead on Elmer's property until John was able to build a four-bedroom home on his piece of land. The only access to the property was on an old trail that slowed them down so much that they began to look for ways to build a road. They built a temporary road which was not passable in winter and this was the situation other settlers of the Spring Glen area faced until 1913 when the first portion of the Benson Road was built. That section was two miles long and connected the farm to Renton. Other sections of road were added over several decades until the John F. Benson Road reached from the Renton city limits to the city limits of Kent. East of Benson there was some farming, especially along the Cedar River along Jones Road (named after Ed Jones; his original ranch is now known as the Cook livestock farm), horse ranching, and a coal mine where the Fairwood Greens is located. On the east side of fairwood, Art Foss's parents settled along Shadow Lake in 1927. They opened a small resort with cabins and a restaurant on the lake. Spring Lake, once known as Otter Lake, was often visited by Seattle fishermen who traveled by coal train up the valley and then hiked up the hill and rented rowboats from the Slusser family. Swan Lake, currently known as Lake Youngs, was also used by local residents as a place to swim, picnic and fish. Today Lake Youngs is in the Seattle watershed and is off limits to the public. The Seattle Water District has two pipelines, developed in the early 1900s, which run from the Cedar River at Landsburg through to Lake Youngs. The Fairwood and Cascade area had many coal mines. The Lake Youngs coal mine was located where Petrovitsky Park is today. Fire King mine was located near what is known today as the Fairwood Greens. When the Fairwood Greens was developed in the early 1970s, many coal mining shafts were found and subsequently filled. A few miles west of the library on 116th SE near the Cascade Shopping Center, there was the Starkovitch Coal mine started in 1938 by the father of John Starkovitch. Martina, John's wife, indicates that she and her husband operated their mine until 1950 when it had to be shut down due to water filling up the mine shafts. Frank Plant operated a mine near Talbot Road and another mine named the Springbrook mine which was just west of the Cascade Vista area. The Wilson mine was located just west of the Benson Highway near the site of the Summerhill apartments. The area as it is recognized today was developed in the early 1950s and 1960s. Cascade Vista began to be developed with homes in 1957 and the Cascade shopping center in 1959. Modern commercial development at the intersection of Benson and Petrovitsky started in earnest in 1959. The Fairwood Greens Golf course was completed in 1967 and major housing projects at Fairwood Greens, Fairwood West and Fairwood Crest began in 1968. Since that time the area surrounding the Fairwood library has developed rapidly with many new housing projects along 140th SE and also along Petrovitsky. Spring Glen Elementary was built in 1953 and most of the other schools in the area were constructed from 1962 (Cascade Elementary) through 1971 (Kentridge High School in 1968; Lindbergh High School which didn't open until 1973 due to a lack of students). In spite of the rapid development and influx of cars and people, you can still find reminders of how things may have been: horse farms, small sheep ranches, many winding rural roads with smaller old homes, lakes and ponds, and large tracts of undeveloped second growth forest.|$|R
