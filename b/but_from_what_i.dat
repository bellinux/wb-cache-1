500|$|He {{started the}} 2003–04 season at Rochdale, making 16 {{appearances}} and scoring five goals in League Two. Rochdale's new manager Steve Parkin criticised McEvilly's fitness level {{to play and}} had described him as [...] "too heavy", and that he needed [...] "to get his physique down to an acceptable weight where he can get around the pitch". Conference National club Accrington Stanley signed McEvilly on a one-month loan in January 2004, making his debut in their 3–0 home win against Tamworth on 20 January. Despite playing out of position in wide right, McEvilly commented; [...] "I was playing out of position but it was okay". He went on to describe the drop in level he said; [...] "I have never played in the Conference <b>but,</b> <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have seen, it is no different to Division Three." [...] After a month at Accrington and making three appearances scoring one goal, his loan was extended in February for a further month, with manager John Coleman praising him as [...] "a great acquisition to the squad". McEvilly went on to make a further three appearances, scoring once more before returning to Rochdale. On his return to Rochdale, he scored a further one goal in 14 appearances. At {{the end of the}} season, McEvilly was released by Rochdale on 10 May, signing a dater for Accrington Stanley on a permanent basis after a previous loan spell. On 13 November 2004, McEvilly scored a hat-trick in Accrington's 5–0 home victory over Northwich Victoria. During the 2004–05 season he made 39 appearances in the Conference National, scoring 15 goals.|$|E

5000|$|I won’t {{apologize}} to Mr. Silver for predicting an outcome that I {{had also been}} predicting for a year.

For those sins (and a multitude of others that I’m sure I don’t even know about), I am sorry.Politics is a messy sport.

In every city and county hospital for poor people in the United States, or in similar institutions in other countries, sights as terrible as those in Molokai can be witnessed, and the sum total of these sights is vastly more terrible. For that matter, if it were given me to choose between being compelled to live in Molokai for the rest of my life, or in the East End of London, the East Side of New York, or the Stockyards of Chicago, I would select Molokai without debate. I would prefer one year of life in Molokai to five years of life in the above- mentioned cesspools of human degradation and misery.|$|R

6000|$|One of {{the most}} curious things {{connected}} with the arts in France, is that of transferring old pictures from wood to canvass. A {{large proportion of the}} paintings of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were done on wood or copper, and many of the former are, or have been, in danger of being lost, from decay. In order to meet the evil, a process has been invented by which the painting is transferred to canvass, where it remains, to all appearance, as good as ever. I have taken some pains to ascertain in what manner this nice operation is performed. I have seen pictures in various stages of the process, though I have never watched any one through it all; and, in one instance, I saw a small Wouvermans stripped to the shirt, if it may be so expressed, or, in other words, when it was nothing <b>but</b> paint. <b>From</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have seen and been told, I understand the mode of effecting this delicate and almost incredible operation to be as follows:-- ...|$|R
