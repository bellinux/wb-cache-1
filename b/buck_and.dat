5|$|If the {{selectors}} are right, Egar is wrong, {{and if he}} {{is incapable}} of interpreting the laws correctly, he should not stand in first-class cricket.

5|$|The Phillies' postseason radio duties {{were split}} between the TV crew and the regular radio crew, while the {{television}} broadcasts on TBS were covered by Brian Anderson, Joe Simpson, and David Aldridge for the Division Series, and Chip Caray, Ron Darling, and Buck Martinez for the League Championship Series.

5|$|The Snow Queen character, neutral but cold-hearted in the {{original}} fairytale and villain in numerous adaptations of the character, proved difficult to adapt to film due to her transparent depiction. Several film executives, including Walt Disney, attempted {{to build on the}} character, and a number of scheduled film adaptions were shelved when they could not work out the character. <b>Buck</b> <b>and</b> his co-director, Jennifer Lee, were ultimately able to solve the dilemma by depicting Elsa and Anna as sisters. As much as Anna’s struggle is external, Elsa’s is internal. This led to Elsa being gradually rewritten as a sympathetic, misunderstood character.|$|E

5|$|They {{encountered}} Native Americans, {{who would}} sometimes demand provisions for passage, but none were given {{and none of}} the incidents ended with violence. The travelers' stores were supplemented by shooting bison, which roamed the Great Plains in huge numbers. Despite being a source of food, the bison were a danger as their stampedes could destroy property and kill irreplaceable stock.

5|$|In 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a {{reported}} US$80million, {{at the time}} the most expensive recording contract in history. Its 1996 release, New Adventures in Hi-Fi, though critically acclaimed, fared worse commercially than its predecessors. The following year, Bill Berry left the band, while Stipe, <b>Buck,</b> <b>and</b> Mills continued the group as a trio. Through some changes in musical style, the band continued its career into the next decade with mixed critical and commercial success, despite having sold more than 85 million records worldwide and becoming one of the world's best-selling music artists of all time. In 2007, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, in their first year of eligibility. R.E.M. disbanded amicably in September 2011, announcing the split on its website.|$|E

5|$|The reformers were {{especially}} active at the Byberry Hospital in Philadelphia where four Friends initiated The Attendant magazine {{as a way}} to communicate ideas and promote reform. This periodical later became The Psychiatric Aide, a professional journal for mental health workers. On May 6, 1946 Life Magazine printed an exposé of the mental healthcare system based on the reports of COs. Another effort of CPS, Mental Hygiene Project became the National Mental Health Foundation. Initially skeptical about the value of Civilian Public Service, Eleanor Roosevelt, impressed by the changes introduced by COs in the mental health system, became a sponsor of the National Mental Health Foundation and actively inspired other prominent citizens including Owen J. Roberts, Pearl <b>Buck</b> <b>and</b> Harry Emerson Fosdick to join her in advancing the organization's objectives of reform and humane treatment of patients.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} {{was also}} recorded {{in some areas}} of Pennsylvania. In Bradford County, the worst of the flooding occurred in the western side of the county, especially in areas adjacent to <b>Buck</b> <b>and</b> Bentley creeks. At Wells Township, State Route 549 was washed out and flooding damaged 8 businesses and 17 homes. In Waverly, the basement of the Village Hall and annex building were both flooded, damaging village archives and police equipment. Throughout the county, about 30 roads, including U.S. Route 6 and state routes 14 and 4028, were closed because of high water or debris, while a bridge in Smithfield Township was washed out. A total of 35 people evacuated from their homes due to flooding. In Lycoming County, the Lycoming Creek crested at heights exceeding records set during Hurricane Agnes in 1972. Nearly all roads in the central and western portions of the county were shutdown due to water inundation.

5|$|The {{motorcycle}} {{technology of}} the late 1970s featured engines with power in excess of what the frames and tires of the day could accommodate. Roberts' riding style, bred on the dirt tracks of America, revolutionized road racing. Prior to his arrival in Europe, riders focused on attaining high entry speeds into corners, leaving braking until the last possible moment then, carving graceful arcs through the corners with both wheels in line. Roberts did just the opposite, braking early then, quickly applying the throttle {{which resulted in the}} rear tire breaking traction and spinning. The resulting tire spin caused the motorcycle to <b>buck</b> <b>and</b> shake as it continually lost then regained traction, creating a brutal, violent riding style that no one had ever seen before on the racetracks of Europe. His riding style was reminiscent of dirt track riding, where sliding the rear tire to one side is used as a method to steer the motorcycle around a corner. Because of his early application of the throttle, he was able to attain top speed faster than his competitors.|$|E
