5|$|Laforey's {{success was}} {{considered}} impressive by historian William James, as his ship carried only 28 nine-pounder cannon {{in contrast with}} L'Huillier's 32 twelve-pounder guns and four 24-pounder carronades. Castor was also a larger ship with a slightly larger crew, and although L'Huillier and his men had only been aboard for ten days, the crew of Carysfort had only come together immediately before the cruise and had not had much longer to <b>become</b> <b>acquainted</b> <b>with</b> their vessel than the French crew.|$|E
5|$|First on the {{schedule}} were the scenes on the Madagascar building site, shot in the Bahamas {{on the site of}} a derelict hotel which Michael G. Wilson had <b>become</b> <b>acquainted</b> <b>with</b> in 1977 during the filming of The Spy Who Loved Me. In the scene, Bond drives a digger toward the building, slamming into the concrete plinth on which Mollaka is running. The stunt team built a model and put forward several ways in which the digger could conceivably take out the concrete, including taking out the pillar underneath. A section of the concrete wall was removed to fit the digger and reinforced with steel.|$|E

5|$|In Evansville, Hinde had <b>become</b> <b>acquainted</b> <b>with</b> the Reid Brothers, who {{designed}} many notable structures there, including the Willard Library. When Hinde and Babcock left Evansville and relocated to Coronado, {{they took the}} Reid Brothers with them, and hired them to design many structures including the Hotel del Coronado. Hinde also used the Reid brothers for personal projects, such as his home in Coronado and the church and rectory he built in the town. All three structures still stand today. Hinde may have used his friendship with the Reid Brothers {{to get them to}} design the Grand Rapids Hotel, which was owned by his nephew, Frederick Hinde Zimmerman.

5|$|Handel {{then spent}} time in Rome, where the {{performance}} of opera was forbidden by Papal decree, and in Naples. He applied himself to the composition of cantatas and oratorios; at that time there was little difference (apart from increasing length) between cantata, oratorio and opera, all based on the alternation of secco recitative and aria da capo. Works from this period include Dixit Dominus and the dramatic cantata Aci, Galatea e Polifemo, written in Naples. While in Rome, probably through Alessandro Scarlatti, Handel had <b>become</b> <b>acquainted</b> <b>with</b> Cardinal Grimani, a distinguished diplomat who wrote libretti in his spare time, and acted as an unofficial theatrical agent for the Italian royal courts. He was evidently impressed by Handel {{and asked him to}} set his new libretto, Agrippina. Grimani intended to present this opera at his family-owned theatre in Venice, the Teatro San Giovanni Grisostomo, as part of the 1709–10 Carnevale season.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately Chongju was {{the furthest}} north that the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade was to penetrate, and on 1 November, {{while still in}} divisional reserve, the brigade was ordered to pull back to Pakchon {{in an attempt to}} {{consolidate}} the western flank. Immediately following their success at Unsan, the Chinese 117th Division of the 39th Army—under the overall command of Zhang Jiecheng—attacked southward, intending to cut off the retreating UN forces and in so doing eliminate the remnants of the ROK 1st Infantry Division and US 1st Cavalry Division by cutting the road junction at Pakchon. Meanwhile, the Chinese 38th and 40th Armies approached along the Chongchon River from the east. 3 RAR remained at Chongju, however, {{due to a lack of}} transport, while the remainder of the brigade moved south; now the most forward element on the US Eighth Army's left flank, the battalion soon became isolated without communications or armour and artillery support. Finally, on 2 November, US Army trucks became available, and the battalion completed its move south without incident, harbouring in the bed of the Taeryong River that evening. Meanwhile, it was announced that Green would be temporarily replaced by Walsh, who he had himself replaced in Japan several months before. Walsh, by then an observer at US Eighth Army headquarters, was urgently posted back to 3 RAR to resume command, despite his lack of operational experience as an infantry commander. Taking over amid difficult circumstances following Green's death, and with little time to <b>become</b> <b>acquainted</b> <b>with</b> the battalion, Walsh's inexperience soon told as the local situation deteriorated.|$|E

Fortunately, Scott's father had <b>become</b> <b>acquainted</b> <b>with</b> Howard Hughes and provided a letter of introduction for his son to present to the eccentric millionaire filmmaker. Hughes responded by getting Scott a small part in a George O'Brien film called Sharp Shooters (1928). Despite its title and the presence of O'Brien, Sharp Shooters is not a western, as some film historians claimed. Rather, it's a romantic comedy. A print of the film survives in the UCLA Film and Television Archive.|$|E

25|$|Ivanov's career, {{in terms}} of his {{background}} and rise through Russia's state structures, has often been compared to Putin's, fueling speculation that Ivanov might run for president in 2008.

Both completed postgraduate studies in counterintelligence; and both joined the foreign intelligence service shortly afterward. However, according to Ivanov's recollections, he did not <b>become</b> <b>acquainted</b> <b>with</b> Putin during their years as students, but rather when both were assigned to work in the same foreign intelligence division in Leningrad.|$|E
