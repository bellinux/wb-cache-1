5|$|A new wooden {{northern}} jetty {{was added}} in 1872 which allowed {{the removal of}} the original western landing place. Another jetty was built on the south west corner in 1898 which reached deep water even at low tide, thus allowing steamers to use the pier at all states of the tide. This was damaged in a gale in 1903, and although it was rebuilt in 1909, it closed in 1916 and was dismantled in 1923. The northern jetty had also been damaged in the 1903 storm but was replaced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> steel structure in 1905.|$|E

5|$|After {{acquiring}} {{the site in}} 1142, they began building a new castle to replace the former Kurdish fortification. This work lasted until 1170, when an earthquake damaged the castle.

In 1163 the Crusaders emerged victorious over Nur ad-Din in the Battle of al-Buqaia near Krak des Chevaliers.|$|E
5|$|Archives {{show the}} village's All Saints' Church dates to around 1350. In the early 15th century, Quex Park manor house—named after the park's second owner, John Quek—was built {{just south of}} the village. The {{ownership}} of the manor passed to various families until 1770 when it was acquired <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> owners, the Powell family. In the late 17th century, the house was visited by King William III. In 1565, a report on the coast of Thanet by the commissioners of Queen Elizabeth I stated that Birchington had 42 houses and did not have an active port. Before the 19th century, the village coastline was frequented by smugglers, leading to skirmishes between them and excise officers. Several of the older houses in the village contain cellars and bricked up tunnels, once used for storing contraband.|$|E
5|$|Beverley, an Anglican, {{had a close}} {{relationship}} with Anglican minister and parson Robert Rose of Saint Anne's Parish. Blandfield was in the parish, and his family attended Anglican (and later Episcopal) services at a church near the estate.

5|$|Chiswick's Roman Catholic church, Our Lady of Grace and St Edward (the Confessor) in the Diocese of Westminster, lies on {{the corner}} of Dukes Avenue and the High Road. It is a red brick building; the parish was founded in 1848, a school began c. 1855, and a church was opened by Cardinal Wiseman on the present site in 1864. It was {{replaced}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> building in 1886, opened by Cardinal Manning. The heavy debts incurred were paid off and the church consecrated in 1904. The square tower was added after the First World War by Canon Egan as a war memorial.|$|E
5|$|Life in the Middle Ages {{centred on}} the {{families}} who owned the manor {{in what was then}} an isolated rural community. Agriculture, hand loom weaving, quarrying and mining occupied the few inhabitants until the middle of the 19th century. A chapel built before 1541 was replaced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> church in 1666 and by 1703 Nonconformism led to the building of a Presbyterian church, now a Unitarian Chapel.

5|$|Many {{visitors}} {{arriving on}} the steamers {{never left the}} pier and Birnbeck Island which between them housed the cafe, pavilion, amusements and funfair. These were destroyed by fire on 26 December 1897 and replaced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> buildings, although these have been altered over the years. The attractions included Mutoscopes, a shooting gallery, merry-go-round, park swings, a theatre of wonders and a licensed bar. In 1891 a telephone was installed only {{six months after the}} first one was installed in the town. In 1909, the amusement area was expanded by an extension on iron supports along {{the south side of the}} island. However, this was not built to the proper specifications so was demolished in 1912; a larger concrete platform was added in its place in 1932.|$|E
5|$|Parish {{churches have}} been built {{in each of the}} former townships. The first St Thomas's Church in Bedford was consecrated in 1840 and {{replaced}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> church in 1909. It is built of Accrington red brick with Runcorn red sandstone facings, to designs by J. S. Crowther. Christ Church, Pennington, designed by architect E.H.Shellard, was built in Yorkshire stone and was consecrated in 1854. The site to the south of the canal was a rapidly growing area at this time. It is Grade II listed. Westleigh St Paul, founded in 1847 is on Westleigh Lane. Westleigh St Peter, a Grade II* listed building by Paley and Austin, built in brick with red sandstone dressings, was founded 1881 is on Firs Lane.|$|E
5|$|Situated in {{the town}} centre {{on the site of}} a former market is the Grade II* listed town hall, an {{imposing}} neoclassical building designed by William Hill and opened in June 1873 by Albert Edward, Prince of Wales. In the 1930s the building was extended by Bradshaw Gass & Hope. Within the Town Hall are the Albert Halls and several function rooms. The original, single Albert Hall was destroyed by fire on 14 November 1981. After rebuilding work, it was replaced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> Albert Halls, which were opened in 1985.|$|E

The profile of self-sustained electrode current oscillations predicted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>presented</b> theory qualitatively agrees with the experimental measurements. For instance, the experimentally observed saw-tooth shaped electrode current pulses are reproduced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>presented</b> theory.

40|$|Self-reports in {{surveys are}} often {{influenced}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>presented</b> question format and question context. Much less {{is known about}} how these effects influence the answers of younger survey respondents. <b>The</b> <b>present</b> study investigated how variations in response format, answer scale frequency, and question order influence self-reports of two age groups: younger (11 – 13 years old) and older (16 – 18 years old) adolescents. In addition, {{the impact of the}} respondents’ level of familiarity with the question content was taken into account. Results indicated that younger adolescents are more strongly influenced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>presented</b> question format and context than older adolescents. This, however, was dependent on the particular question content, implying that response effects are more pronounced when questions deal with issues that lie outside of the respondents’ field of experience. Implications of these findings in survey research with younger respondents are discussed...|$|R
5|$|St Mary the Virgin's Church {{has been}} in {{existence}} since the 12th century and probably much earlier. It was once known as the Church of St Peter at Westleigh in Leigh, and straddles {{the boundary between the}} old townships of Westleigh and Pennington, the nave and churchyard, in Westleigh and the chancel in Pennington. Its early history is connected with the Westleigh and Urmston families. Its dedication changed to St Mary the Virgin in the 14th century. The church tower, said to have been built in 1516, is all that remains of the medieval structure, which was replaced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> church after becoming unsafe. Paley and Austin of Lancaster designed the present church, the foundation stone was laid in 1871 and the church consecrated in 1873. The church is built in red sandstone it is a Grade II listed building.|$|E
5|$|The {{club was}} {{originally}} formed in 1913 by local businessmen, who built a wooden clubhouse at 33 Queen's Road which opened on 2 December {{of the same}} year.

The Clark family took on the club's license in 1992 and began to put on gigs after {{a shift in the}} makeup of Hyde Park's population caused by more students moving into the area. Initial shows were focused around the local DIY music scene.|$|E
