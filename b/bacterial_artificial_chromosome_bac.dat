5000|$|A <b>bacterial</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>chromosome</b> (<b>BAC)</b> is a DNA construct, {{based on}} a {{functional}} fertility plasmid (or F-plasmid), used for transforming and cloning in bacteria, usually E. coli. [...] F-plasmids {{play a crucial role}} because they contain partition genes that promote the even distribution of plasmids after bacterial cell division. The bacterial artificial chromosome's usual insert size is 150-350 kbp. A similar cloning vector called a PAC has also been produced from the DNA of P1 bacteriophage.|$|E

In simulations, Velvet can produce contigs up to 50-kb N50 length using prokaryotic data and 3-kb N50 in mammalian <b>bacterial</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>chromosomes</b> (<b>BACs).</b> These preliminary transcripts are transferred to Oases, which uses paired end read and long read information to build transcript isoforms.|$|R
50|$|Before {{analyzing}} target genome {{structural aberration}} and copy number variation (CNV) with ESP, the target genome is usually amplified and conserved with artificial chromosome construction. The classic strategy {{to construct an}} artificial chromosome is <b>bacterial</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>chromosome</b> (<b>BAC).</b> Basically, the target chromosome is randomly digested and inserted into plasmids which are transformed and cloned in bacteria. The size of fragments inserted is 150-350 kb. Another commonly used artificial chromosome is fosmid. The difference between BAC and fosmids {{is the size of}} the DNA inserted. Fosmids can only hold 40 kb DNA fragments, which allows a more accurate breakpoint determination.|$|E
5000|$|Gaps often remain {{after initial}} BAC contig construction. These gaps occur if the <b>Bacterial</b> <b>Artificial</b> <b>Chromosome</b> (<b>BAC)</b> library {{screened}} has low complexity, meaning {{it does not}} contain {{a high number of}} STS or restriction sites, or if certain regions were less stable in cloning hosts and thus underrepresented in the library. [...] If gaps between contigs remain after STS landmark mapping and restriction fingerprinting have been performed, the sequencing of contig ends can be used to close these gaps. This end-sequencing strategy essentially creates a novel STS with which to screen the other contigs. Alternatively, the end sequence of a contig {{can be used as a}} primer to primer walk across the gap.|$|E
50|$|Recent {{advances}} in biotechnology {{gave rise to}} many important techniques that are of extremely high genomic resolution and as a result, {{an increasing number of}} copy number variations in the genome have been reported. One of these {{advances in}}volve using <b>bacterial</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>chromosome</b> (<b>BAC)</b> array with around 1 megabase of intervals throughout the entire gene, BACs can also detect copy number variations in rearrangement hotspots allowing for the detection of 119 novel copy number variations. Throughout the past decade or so, high throughput genomic sequencing has revolutionized the field of human genomics and in silico studies have been performed to detect copy number variations in the genome. Reference sequences have been compared to other sequences of interest using fosmids by strictly controlling the fosmid clones to be 40kb. Sequencing end reads would provide adequate information to align the reference sequence to the sequence of interest, and any misalignments are easily noticeable thus concluded to be copy number variations within that region of the clone. This type of detection technique offers a high genomic resolution and precise location of the repeat in the genome, and it can also detect other types of structural variation such as inversions.In addition, another way of detecting copy number variation that can ensure high genomic resolution is using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). Since the International HapMap project had begun, common SNPs that occur between four different populations from different continents have been sequenced and located. Due to the abundance of the human SNP data, the direction of detecting copy number variation has changed to utilize these SNPs. Relying on the fact that human recombination is relatively rare and that many recombination events occur in specific regions of the genome known as recombination hotspots, linkage disequilibrium can be used to identify copy number variations. Efforts have been made in associating copy number variations with specific haplotype SNPs by analyzing the linkage disequilibrium, using these associations, one is able to recognize copy number variations in the genome using SNPs as markers. One drawback of this method is that because SNPs in the International HapMap are not optimized for detecting copy number variations, therefore the data is biased towards large copy number variations. Next-generation sequencing has also been used recently to detect copy number variations with high genomic resolutions. Using whole-genome shot-gun sequencing data, assays have been developed to accurately detect and identify regions of duplications. On the other hand, it is very challenging to detect CNAs in targeted sequencing because it is extremely unlikely that breakpoints will occur inside the scant number of regions captured by a gene panel. Thus, soft-clipped reads and discordant reads are unlikely to be found in targeted sequencing. On average, there is about 1 SNP per 800 bit/s, so over a long enough region, B-allele frequencies (BAF) can be used to detect copy number changes. However, in targeted sequencing, there are not enough heterozygous variants within a short region to detect deviations from the expected 50% BAF. Lastly, high resolution microarrays that have copy number probes as well as SNP probes are the gold standard for detecting copy number changes down to 50 kbs with whole genome coverage.Accurately detecting, identifying, and categorizing copy number variations is extremely important because of the complications they bring to DNA sequencing. Traditionally, DNA sequencing relied heavily on sequencing short reads from a large genome and using any overlapping regions of the reads to combine the short reads to form longer reads. This will eventually be mapped together to give the sequence of the entire genome. However, the issues related to copy number variations arise in linking the overlapping regions together. By definition, copy number variation is a region of the genome duplicated a variable number of times in the population and due to the large variation between the number of times portions of the genome are duplicated, when mapping overlapping sequences, it becomes unclear whether or not a region is an overlap or a duplicated region. With all the challenges faced by sequencing to detect copy number variations, high resolution microarrays are the technology of choice.|$|E
