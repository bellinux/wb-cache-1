2500|$|There {{are many}} {{examples}} of electrostatic phenomena, from those as simple as the attraction of the plastic wrap to your hand after you remove it from a package to the apparently spontaneous explosion of grain silos, the damage of electronic components during manufacturing, and photocopier & laser printer operation. Electrostatics involves the buildup of charge {{on the surface of}} objects due to contact with other surfaces. Although charge exchange happens whenever any two surfaces contact and separate, the effects of charge exchange are usually only noticed when {{at least one of the}} surfaces has a high resistance to electrical flow. [...] This is because the charges that transfer are trapped there for a time long enough for their effects to be observed. [...] These charges then remain on the object until they either <b>bleed</b> <b>off</b> to ground or are quickly neutralized by a discharge: e.g., the familiar phenomenon of a static 'shock' is caused by the neutralization of charge built up in the body from contact with insulated surfaces.|$|E
2500|$|The saignée (French for [...] "bleed") {{method is}} the {{practice}} of removing ("bleeding off") some of the juice from the must in order to more deeply concentrate the phenolics, colour and flavour the red wine. It {{has a long history}} of use in the French wine regions of Bordeaux and Burgundy but wasn't always used for rosé production. For some red winemakers, the juice <b>bleed</b> <b>off</b> is simply poured down the drain or used as [...] "topping wine" [...] to fill the ullage (the headspace of barrels and tanks) during storage. Its use in rosé production is sometimes considered an afterthought, as a way to increase cash-flow by producing a second wine to a primary red wine that can be released much sooner and available to market. While many wineries have been able to produce critically acclaimed rosé using the saignée method, its use has provoked criticism from wine personalities such as François Millo, president of the Provence Wine Council (CIVP) who claim that saignée method rosés are “not true rosés" [...] because the bleeding process (which is not pressed with the must) is more of an afterthought.|$|E

50|$|This is {{the most}} time {{consuming}} form of well kill. It involves repeatedly pumping in small quantities of kill mud into the well bore and then <b>bleeding</b> <b>off</b> excess pressure. It works {{on the principle that}} the heavier kill mud will sink below the lighter well bore fluids and so <b>bleeding</b> <b>off</b> the pressure will remove the latter leaving an increasing quantity of kill mud in the well bore with successive steps.|$|R
50|$|Patent {{lawsuits}} {{were still}} hampering both companies and <b>bleeding</b> <b>off</b> cash, so in 1896, J. P. Morgan engineered a patent sharing {{agreement between the}} two companies that remained in force for 11 years.|$|R
50|$|The tip {{must never}} be wiped off or blotted in any way, {{even from the}} exterior, while liquid is in the tip. These actions tend to attract and thus <b>bleed</b> <b>off</b> some of the liquid, {{resulting}} in decreased accuracy and repeatability.|$|E

50|$|A related {{issue is}} drag. If the near light speed space craft is {{interacting}} with matter or energy that is moving {{slowly in the}} planetary reference frame—solar wind, magnetic fields, cosmic microwave background radiation—this will cause drag which will <b>bleed</b> <b>off</b> {{a portion of the}} engine's acceleration.|$|E
50|$|Dive brakes were {{employed}} on many designs to create drag which slowed the aircraft in its dive and increased accuracy. Air brakes on modern aircraft {{function in a}} similar manner in <b>bleeding</b> <b>off</b> excessive speed.|$|R
5000|$|Essentially, these rockets {{would place}} the vehicle onto an [...] {{intercontinental}} ballistic missile-like trajectory and then fall away. When the vehicle reentered the atmosphere, instead of fully reentering, <b>bleeding</b> <b>off</b> its speed and landing, the vehicle {{would use the}} lift from its wings to redirect its glide angle upward while <b>bleeding</b> <b>off</b> speed in the process. In this way, the vehicle would be [...] "bounced" [...] back into space again. This skip-glide method would repeat until the speed was low enough that the pilot of the vehicle would need to pick a landing spot and glide the vehicle to a landing. This use of hypersonic atmospheric lift meant that the vehicle could greatly extend its range over a ballistic trajectory using the same engines.|$|R

5000|$|Text or {{graphics}} {{that are}} intended to <b>bleed</b> <b>off</b> the page of the final printed piece should be extended off the document boundary in the digital file. The amount varies depending on location, but is usually 1/8 inch in the US, and 3mm in metric systems.|$|E
50|$|Pump-in subs (also {{known as}} a flow T) allow for the {{injection}} of fluid into the pressure control string. Normally these are used for wellsite pressure testing, which is typically performed between every run into the well. They {{can also be used}} to <b>bleed</b> <b>off</b> pressure from the string after a run in the well, or to pump in kill fluids to control a wild well.|$|E
50|$|Lubricator is {{the term}} used for {{sections}} of pressure tested pipe that act to seal in wireline tools during pressurization.As stated it {{is a series of}} pipes that connect and it is what holds the tool string so operators can make runs {{in and out of the}} well. It has valves to <b>bleed</b> <b>off</b> pressure so that you can disconnect it from the well and work on tools, etc.|$|E
50|$|Manual or {{mechanical}} harvesting with either Pinot noir or Gamay. The grapes are sometimes sorted. Two methods are used: either pressing (Rosé pressing), or placing the harvest {{in a tank}} for an early maceration: <b>bleeding</b> <b>off</b> (<b>bleeding</b> rosé), made with the juice drawn from the tank. Fermentation {{is done in the}} tank, like the white wine, and then followed by monitoring of the temperature, chaptalization, etc. Malolactic fermentation is then carried out. Maturing takes place in vats, (sometimes in barrels). Finally, the wine is filtered and bottled.|$|R
50|$|While {{the power}} supply is on, a small current {{flows through the}} bleeder {{resistor}}, wasting {{a small amount of}} power. The value of the resistor is chosen to be low enough that the charge on the capacitor <b>bleeds</b> <b>off</b> quickly, but high enough that the resistor will not consume too much power while the supply is on.|$|R

5000|$|In the 1970s Sutter Home Winery was a {{producer}} of premium Zinfandel red wine in the Napa Valley. To increase concentration in their wines, they used the saignée technique to <b>bleed</b> <b>off</b> some of the grape juice before fermentation, to increase the impact of compounds in the skins on the remaining wine. The excess juice was separately fermented into a dry, almost white wine that Sutter Home called [...] "White Zinfandel." ...|$|E
5000|$|Other series strings wired in {{parallel}} with the degraded string will now discharge through the degraded string until their voltage matches the voltage of the degraded string, potentially overcharging and leading to electrolyte boiling and outgassing from the remaining good cells in the degraded string. These parallel strings can now never be fully recharged, as the increased voltage will <b>bleed</b> <b>off</b> through the string containing the failed battery.|$|E
50|$|Further, {{great care}} must be taken when working on the primary section of a coil even when it has been {{disconnected}} from its power source for some time. The tank capacitors can remain charged for days with enough energy to deliver a fatal shock. Proper designs always include 'bleeder resistors' to <b>bleed</b> <b>off</b> stored charge from the capacitors. In addition, a safety shorting operation is performed on each capacitor before any internal work is performed.|$|E
50|$|Modern Ferin {{were used}} by the Varn Dominion as servants, pets, and power sources.

50|$|An {{air filter}} is an {{essential}} safety device in a pressure infusor, to keep {{air out of the}} patients' veins. Small bubbles could cause harm in arteries, but in the veins they pass through the heart and leave in the patients' lungs. The air filter is just a membrane that passes gas but not fluid or pathogens. When a large air bubble reaches it, it <b>bleeds</b> <b>off.</b>|$|R
50|$|The 051 {{was simply}} a Class A version of the engine, {{physically}} the same on the outside only the bore was different and the piston had a small groove in the skirt to <b>bleed</b> <b>off</b> just enough power to exactly equal an 049 so no trim changes {{would be required to}} free flight models required (this groove also visually differentiates the 051 from the 049 but this was of secondary importance). The 051 also had a RED carb body.|$|E
5000|$|Instead {{of using}} subsonic ammunition, one can lower the muzzle {{velocity}} of a supersonic bullet before {{it leaves the}} barrel. Some suppressor designs, referred to as [...] "integrals", do this by allowing gas to <b>bleed</b> <b>off</b> {{along the length of}} the barrel before the projectile exits. The MP5SD is the best example of this with holes right after the chamber of the barrel used to reduce a regular 115 or 124 gr ammunition to subsonic velocities.|$|E
50|$|Among other 7.62×51mm NATO battle rifles at the time, the FN FAL had {{relatively}} light recoil, {{due to the}} {{gas system}} {{being able to be}} tuned via regulator in fore-end of the rifle, which allowed for excess gas which would simply increase recoil to <b>bleed</b> <b>off.</b> In fully automatic mode, however, the shooter receives considerable abuse from recoil, and the weapon climbs off-target quickly, making automatic fire only of marginal effectiveness. Many military forces using the FAL eventually eliminated full-automatic firearms training in the light-barrel FAL.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: This {{premixed}} {{soft drink}} carbonation tester is constructed of tempered glass {{and stainless steel}} with a quick connect on the bottom, and a 100 psi gauge and a relief valve on the top. Used in the 1960s to check the pressure of premixed soft drinks before shipment in 5-gallon tanks, it is operated by connecting the tank to the quick connect, <b>bleeding</b> <b>off</b> gas to allow the glass to fill, then shaking it. The pressure is then read from the gauge.|$|R
50|$|With {{the primary}} turbo {{continuing}} to supply manifold {{pressure and the}} secondary turbocharger essentially <b>bleeding</b> <b>off</b> the boost it makes during the transition, the ECU will determine when to close the pressure relief valve and fully open the exhaust control valve. Once this is done, the ECU will again look at the input from the differential pressure sensor and open yet another valve - the intake control valve (which is mounted between the secondary turbo's compressor outlet and the intercooler).|$|R
50|$|The partial {{pressure}} of oxygen in diving chambers and surface supplied breathing gas mixtures {{can also be}} monitored using these cells. This can either be done by placing the cell directly in the hyperbaric environment, wired through the hull to the monitor, or indirectly, by <b>bleeding</b> <b>off</b> gas from the hyperbaric environment or diver gas supply and analysing at atmospheric pressure, then calculating the {{partial pressure}} in the hyperbaric environment. This is frequently required in saturation diving and surface oriented surface supplied mixed gas commercial diving.|$|R
50|$|Although service {{increases}} at Littleton/Route 495, a new garage at North Leominster, and {{the opening}} of Wachusett are expected to <b>bleed</b> <b>off</b> demand, insufficient parking at South Acton is considered a town concern. Although no firm plans were in place, town officials stated in January 2014 that they were considering adding parking spots to serve the station and the Assabet River Rail Trail. In February 2015, the town reported that it was considering the purchase of a property to create an additional 100-space parking lot {{on the south side of}} the station.|$|E
50|$|Because of the speed/power tradeoff, high-powered {{circuits}} may use {{two separate}} bleeder circuits. A fast bleed circuit is switched out during normal operation {{so that no}} power is wasted; when power is switched off, the fast bleeder is connected, rapidly bleeding down the voltage. The switch controlling the fast bleeder can fail, either by connecting when it shouldn't (and overheating) or by not connecting when it should (and thereby failing to <b>bleed</b> <b>off</b> the voltage quickly). To avoid the risk of not having an operational bleeder, a secondary, slower (and less lossy) bleeder is usually permanently connected {{so that there is}} always some bleed-down capability.|$|E
50|$|In 1952 Hooker {{was asked}} by the Folland company whether he could produce a 5000 lbf kN thrust engine to power their new {{lightweight}} fighter, the Gnat. For this role he produced his first completely original design, the Orpheus, which went on to power the Fiat G91 and other light fighters. Hooker then used the Orpheus as the basis of an experimental vectored-thrust engine for VTOL aircraft, at that time considered by most to be the next big thing in aircraft design. By equipping an Orpheus to <b>bleed</b> <b>off</b> air from the compressor and turbine the thrust could be directed downwards, creating the Pegasus engine and leading to the Hawker Siddeley Harrier that used it.|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation has}} been conducted {{to determine the effect}} of bleed region geometry and bleed rate on shock wave-boundary layer interactions in an axisymmetric, mixed-compression inlet at a Mach number of 2. 5. The full realizable reduction in transformed form factor is obtained by <b>bleeding</b> <b>off</b> about half the incident boundary layer mass flow. Bleeding upstream or downstream of the shock-induced pressure rise is preferable to bleeding across the shock-induced pressure rise. Slanted holes are more effective than normal holes. Two different bleed hole sizes were tested without detectable difference in performance...|$|R
5000|$|Several similar {{conversions}} of the Space Shuttle's external tank (ET) {{were also}} studied. During launch the ET accelerated to about 98% of orbital speed before being dropped and deliberately spun {{in order to}} increase its drag. A number of proposals suggested keeping the ET attached to the Shuttle all the way into orbit, <b>bleeding</b> <b>off</b> any remaining fuel through the Space Shuttle Main Engines, which would have been [...] "left open". One such test had been scheduled, but was canceled after the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster dramatically changed safety rules.|$|R
40|$|Velocity profile control {{tests were}} {{conducted}} with a short annular diffuser equipped with wall bleed capability.
