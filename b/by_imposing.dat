5|$|The Bulgarian monarch was {{satisfied}} with the results and considered that he had superiority over the Byzantine Empire to achieve his political ambitions— to assume the throne in Constantinople.

He needed his own political and ideological base and launched an ambitious construction programme in Preslav so that it could rival Constantinople. In addition, Simeon I took precautions to reduce the Byzantine influence over the Western Balkans <b>by</b> <b>imposing</b> his authority over the Principality of Serbia in return for recognizing Petar Gojniković as its ruler.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of Compton scattering by Arthur Holly Compton in 1923 convinced most physicists that light {{was composed of}} photons, and that energy and momentum were conserved in collisions between electrons and photons. In 1924, Bohr, Kramers and John C. Slater, an American physicist working at the Institute in Copenhagen, proposed the Bohr–Kramers–Slater theory (BKS). It was more a programme than a full physical theory, as the ideas it developed were not worked out quantitatively. BKS theory became the final attempt at understanding the interaction of matter and electromagnetic radiation {{on the basis of}} the old quantum theory, in which quantum phenomena were treated <b>by</b> <b>imposing</b> quantum restrictions on a classical wave description of the electromagnetic field.|$|E

5|$|In early 1946, Jorge Pasquel and {{his four}} brothers, {{owners of the}} Mexican {{baseball}} league, siphoned campaign funds from the upcoming Mexican presidential election and used them to offer large salaries and signing bonuses to American baseball players. In some cases, the offers were triple the salaries being paid in the Major Leagues. Chandler deterred players from considering Mexican League offers <b>by</b> <b>imposing</b> a five-year ban from Major League Baseball to anyone who played in the Mexican League and did not return by April 1, 1946. In all, eighteen players played for the Mexican league despite the ban, including Mickey Owen, Max Lanier, and Sal Maglie. Vern Stephens initially agreed to play in Mexico as well, but returned before Chandler's April 1 deadline. Ted Williams, Stan Musial, and Phil Rizzuto were also offered lucrative contracts and incentives, but all eventually declined to play in Mexico.|$|E
5|$|One {{avenue for}} {{non-compliance}} {{is the black}} market. FairTax supporters state that the black market is largely untaxed under the current tax system. Economists estimate the underground economy in the United States to be between one and three trillion dollars annually. <b>By</b> <b>imposing</b> a sales tax, supporters argue that black market activity would be taxed when proceeds from such activity are spent on legal consumption. For example, the sale of illegal narcotics would remain untaxed (instead of being guilty of income tax evasion, drug dealers would be guilty of failing to submit sales tax), but they would face taxation when they used drug proceeds to buy consumer goods such as food, clothing, and cars. By taxing this previously untaxed money, FairTax supporters argue that non-filers would be paying part of their share of what would otherwise be uncollected income and payroll taxes.|$|E
5|$|The NATO council {{declared}} {{the attacks on}} the United States were an attack on all NATO nations which satisfied Article 5 of the NATO charter. This marked the first invocation of Article 5, which had been written during the Cold War with an attack by the Soviet Union in mind.

The Bush administration announced a War on Terror, with the stated goals of bringing bin Laden and al-Qaeda to justice and preventing the emergence of other terrorist networks. These goals would be accomplished <b>by</b> <b>imposing</b> economic and military sanctions against states harboring terrorists, and increasing global surveillance and intelligence sharing.|$|E

5|$|Although Pytka {{fixed the}} ideas on a storyboard, he {{abandoned}} {{it as soon}} as filming began, and followed ideas based on what angles and perspectives the steadycam camera produced. One instance was the filming of the car crash, which Pytka filmed for hours from above, but realised that a steadycam shot on the ground was a much better idea. Archive footage was used <b>by</b> <b>imposing</b> it on scenes shot by Pytka, who utilised a greenscreen stage to digitally blend it into the finished film, such as Paul's Old English Sheepdog in the graveyard, and the elephant in the ballroom procession scene. The elephant was put in last, as Aspinall phoned Pytka and said that Starr liked the scene, but insisted an elephant be put in it, which Pytka later did, as he had already put a sitar in at the request of Harrison. Apart from the steadycam shots, Pytka used a Russian-made Akil-crane for sweeping overhead shots, such as the Abbey Road zebra crossing shot at the end, as well as a remote-controlled toy helicopter with a camera added to it for intricate aerial shots. To make it more interesting, two Blue Meanies make cameos.|$|E
5|$|From 1514 to 1529, Thomas Wolsey (1473–1530), a {{cardinal}} {{of the established}} Church, oversaw {{domestic and foreign policy}} for the young king from his position as Lord Chancellor. Wolsey centralised the national government and extended the jurisdiction of the conciliar courts, particularly the Star Chamber. The Star Chamber's overall structure remained unchanged, but Wolsey used it to provide for much-needed reform of the criminal law. The power of the court itself did not outlive Wolsey, however, since no serious administrative reform was undertaken and its role was eventually devolved to the localities. Wolsey helped fill the gap left by Henry's declining participation in government (particularly in comparison to his father) but did so mostly <b>by</b> <b>imposing</b> himself in the King's place. His use of these courts to pursue personal grievances, and particularly to treat delinquents as if mere examples of a whole class worthy of punishment, angered the rich, who were annoyed as well by his enormous wealth and ostentatious living. Following Wolsey's downfall, Henry took full control of his government, although at court numerous complex factions continued to try to ruin and destroy each other.|$|E
5|$|On 13 March 1985, Millwall visited Kenilworth Road for an FA Cup sixth round match. After only 14 {{minutes the}} match was halted as the visiting fans began to riot. The referee took both teams off for 25 minutes, before {{bringing}} {{them back on}} to complete the match. Following the final whistle, and a 1–0 victory for Luton, another pitch invasion and subsequent riot by away supporters caused noticeable damage {{to the ground and}} the surrounding area. Many of those arrested turned out to be supporters of teams other than Millwall. The club's chairman, David Evans, reacted <b>by</b> <b>imposing</b> a ban on all away supporters from Kenilworth Road {{from the start of the}} 1986–87 season as well as introducing a scheme that would require even home supporters to carry membership cards to be admitted to matches. The Football League insisted that Luton relax the ban for League Cup matches, but when Evans refused to allow Cardiff City fans to visit Kenilworth Road for their second round tie, the club were thrown out of the competition. The ban continued for four seasons, with exceptions for cup matches, before Luton Town repealed the ban before the 1990–91 season.|$|E
