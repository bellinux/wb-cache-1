5|$|Due to {{a school}} {{desegregation}} suit in 1972, the court required St. Louis to accept a <b>busing</b> plan in 1980. Judge William L. Hungate declared that a mandatory plan would go into effect unless other arrangements were made {{to adhere to the}} terms of the suit. In 1983, an unprecedented voluntary <b>busing</b> plan was put into place, integrating the schools without a mandated plan being required.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy had {{initially}} opposed <b>busing</b> schoolchildren across racial lines, but grew {{to support the}} practice as it became a focal point of civil rights efforts. After federal judge W. Arthur Garrity ordered the Boston School Committee in 1974 to racially integrate Boston's public schools via <b>busing,</b> Kennedy made a surprise appearance at a September 1974 anti-busing rally in City Hall Plaza to express the need for peaceful dialogue and was met with extreme hostility. The predominantly white crowd yelled insults about his children and hurled tomatoes and eggs {{at him as he}} retreated into the John F. Kennedy Federal Building and {{went so far as to}} push against one of its glass walls and break it.|$|E

5|$|Early in his career, Ford {{supported}} {{a constitutional amendment}} against desegregation <b>busing.</b> He also floated a proposal to put the federal budget on a two-year cycle, believing too much time was spent annually on budget wrangling. This idea, based on the model used in the Kentucky state budget, was never implemented. During the Ninety-fifth Congress (1977–1979), {{he was chairman of}} the Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences.|$|E
5|$|Following the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision, Manual became racially {{integrated}} without {{controversy and}} graduated {{its first two}} black students in 1958. Starting in the 1960s, Manual began to face problems associated with inner city schools in the United States as economically advantaged families moved towards Louisville's suburbs. Manual was exempt from court-ordered <b>busing</b> in the 1970s because its racial makeup already met federal guidelines.|$|E
5|$|Massachusetts {{has avoided}} {{many forms of}} racial strife seen {{elsewhere}} in the US, but examples such as the successful electoral showings of the nativist (mainly anti-Catholic) Know Nothings in the 1850s, the controversial Sacco and Vanzetti executions in the 1920s, and Boston's opposition to desegregation <b>busing</b> in the 1970s show that the ethnic history of Massachusetts was not completely harmonious.|$|E

5|$|The Nixon {{presidency}} {{witnessed the}} first large-scale integration {{of public schools}} in the South. Nixon sought a middle way between the segregationist Wallace and liberal Democrats, whose support of integration was alienating some Southern whites. Hopeful of doing well in the South in 1972, he sought to dispose of desegregation as a political issue before then. Soon after his inauguration, he appointed Vice President Agnew to lead a task force, which worked with local leaders—both white and black—to determine how to integrate local schools. Agnew had little interest in the work, and most of it was done by Labor Secretary George Shultz. Federal aid was available, and a meeting with President Nixon was a possible reward for compliant committees. By September 1970, less than ten percent of black children were attending segregated schools. By 1971, however, tensions over desegregation surfaced in Northern cities, with angry protests over the <b>busing</b> of children to schools outside their neighborhood to achieve racial balance. Nixon opposed <b>busing</b> personally but enforced court orders requiring its use.|$|E
5|$|Undaunted by {{the failure}} of the bond issue, Fields {{returned}} to the 1926 General Assembly with more proposals, including another increase in the gasoline tax to provide the funds needed to construct the state highway system. The 1926 Assembly passed more legislation than any previous legislature, including the increased gas tax and several bills to reorganize state government. The state purchasing commission and the Department of Bus Transportation were among the entities created in the reorganization. Under Fields, the state implemented the first phase of desegregation <b>busing.</b>|$|E
5|$|As a legislator, Beshear {{gained a}} {{reputation}} as a consumer advocate, and sponsored bills to increase environmental protections and end the practice of commercial bail bonding. In 1974, Beshear voted against a resolution condemning the practice of desegregation <b>busing</b> because it called for changes to the federal constitution. One of his major accomplishments in the House was spearheading legislation to improve neonatal care at the University of Kentucky Medical Center. Although he considered a 1978 bill requiring the posting of the Ten Commandments in Kentucky classrooms to be unconstitutional, he abstained from voting on it rather than voting against it, a move he later claimed he regretted.|$|E

5|$|By the 1970s, the city's {{economy had}} {{recovered}} after 30 years of economic downturn. A {{large number of}} high rises were constructed in the Financial District and in Boston's Back Bay during this time period. This boom continued into the mid-1980s and resumed after a few pauses. Hospitals such as Massachusetts General Hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and Brigham and Women's Hospital lead the nation in medical innovation and patient care. Schools such as Boston College, Boston University, the Harvard Medical School, Tufts University School of Medicine, Northeastern University, Wentworth Institute of Technology, Berklee College of Music, and Boston Conservatory attract students to the area. Nevertheless, the city experienced conflict starting in 1974 over desegregation <b>busing,</b> which resulted in unrest and violence around public schools throughout the mid-1970s.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{instructed}} Agnew {{to avoid}} personal {{attacks on the}} press and the Democratic presidential nominee, South Dakota Senator George McGovern, to stress the positives of the Nixon administration, and not to comment on what might happen in 1976. At the 1972 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach, Agnew was greeted as a hero by delegates who saw him as the party's future. After being nominated for a second term, Agnew delivered an acceptance speech focused on the administration's accomplishments, and avoided his usual slashing invective, but he condemned McGovern for supporting <b>busing,</b> and alleged that McGovern, if elected, would beg the North Vietnamese for the return of American prisoners of war. The Watergate break-in was a minor issue in the campaign; for once, Agnew's exclusion from Nixon's inner circle worked in his favor, as he knew nothing of the matter until reading of it in the press, and upon learning from Jeb Magruder that administration officials were responsible for the break-in, cut off discussion of the matter. He viewed the break-in as foolish, and felt that both major parties routinely spied on each other. Nixon had instructed Agnew not to attack McGovern's initial running mate, Missouri Senator Thomas Eagleton, and after Eagleton withdrew amid revelations concerning past mental health treatment, the president renewed those instructions for the new candidate, Sargent Shriver.|$|E
