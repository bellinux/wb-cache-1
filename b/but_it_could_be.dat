5|$|A long-standing {{mystery of}} Venus {{observations}} {{is the so-called}} ashen light—an apparent weak illumination of its dark side, seen when the planet is in the crescent phase. The first claimed observation of ashen light was made in 1643, but {{the existence of the}} illumination has never been reliably confirmed. Observers have speculated it may result from electrical activity in the Venusian atmosphere, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> illusory, resulting from the physiological effect of observing a bright, crescent-shaped object.|$|E
5|$|Meetings {{could take}} place either inside or outside of the formal {{boundary}} of the city (the pomerium), though the official meeting place, or curia was at {{the centre of the}} Roman forum. The president of the Senate was normally one of the consuls, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> called to meet by any of the praetors or tribunes, both of whom had the authority to call the Senate, though praetors rarely did so unless the consuls were away and the tribunes almost never did so. Meetings were suffused in religious ritual. Temples were a preferred meeting site and auspices would be taken before the meeting could commence.|$|E
5|$|The {{limitation}} of the argument so far is that it only shows {{the existence of a}} necessary existent, and that is different from showing the existence of God as worshipped in Islam. An atheist might agree that a necessary existent exists, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> the universe itself, or there could be many necessary existents, none of which is God. Avicenna is aware of this limitation, and his works contains numerous arguments to show the necessary existent must have the attributes associated with God identified in Islam.|$|E

5|$|The {{queen conch}} reaches sexual {{maturity}} at approximately 3 to 4 years of age, reaching a shell length of nearly 180mm and weighing up to 5 pounds. Individuals may usually {{live up to}} 7 years, though in deeper waters their lifespan may reach 20–30 years and maximum lifetime estimates reach 40 years. It is believed that the mortality rate tends to be lower in matured conchs due to their thickened shell, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> substantially higher for juveniles. Estimates have demonstrated that its mortality rate decreases as its size increases and can also vary due to habitat, season and other factors.|$|E
5|$|Æthelbert retired {{some time}} before his death, consecrating Eanbald as his successor. The exact date this {{occurred}} is unclear. Alcuin gives a date corresponding to July 778, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> 777 too. Eanbald's position may have just been as an associate bishop, with Æthelbert remaining in office until his death while sharing the office with Eanbald. During his retirement, he had constructed a new church dedicated to Alma Sophia. He {{lived long enough to}} consecrate the new church, ten days before his death on 8 November.|$|E
5|$|For use in {{a binary}} digital computer, the tube had {{to be capable of}} storing either one of two states at each of its memory locations, {{corresponding}} to the binary digits (bits) 0 and1. It exploited the positive or negative electrostatic charge generated by displaying either a dash or a dot at any position on the CRT screen, a phenomenon known as secondary emission. A dash generated a positive charge, and a dot a negative charge, either of which could be picked up by a detector plate in front of the screen; a negative charge represented 0, and a positive charge1. The charge dissipated in about 0.2seconds, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> automatically refreshed from the data picked up by the detector.|$|E

25|$|These glacial {{advances}} loosely correlate to minima in {{the level}} of Lake Turkana around 4800, 4200, 3700, 3500, 3000, 2500, 2500, 2000 and 1600-1400 ya. As glaciers would have advanced during the dry phases when the temperature was cooler, it is not known why the correlation is not better, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> due to inaccuracies in dating.|$|E
25|$|In January 1823 Captain George W. Willes took command. On 2 December 1824 she {{captured}} Jane and her cargo. On 13 February 1825 she {{captured the}} sloop Elizabeth. On 18 March 1825 {{she was at}} Bognor, having chased on shore a tub boat and galley with cargoes of gin, tea, and tobacco. Anti-smuggling patrol might not be glamorous, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> lucrative.|$|E
25|$|Apparently {{many people}} have {{experienced}} spectacular allergic reactions when they have {{come into contact with}} both live and dead tick products. Having a tick simply walk over a person's hand produces in some people an intense discomfort and itching – what particular components of the tick body cause these reactions is unknown, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> a water-soluble component that is excreted through the cuticular canals.|$|E

Kisch demonstrated his fluency in a number of European languages, and he was then asked to write the Lord's Prayer in Scottish Gaelic. He refused to participate and was deemed to have failed the test. He was then taken into custody, this time by the New South Wales police, who released him on AU£200 bail.|$|E
25|$|The crypt has {{remained}} largely untouched since its consecration in 1123. The crypt is identified by its numerous and densely built pillars. The pillars {{are very different}} in style and were built by the architect Donatus. The most famous pillar is {{the one with the}} statue of a man embracing it. Local legend tells that the figure is Finn the Giant, builder of the cathedral. Another column has a similar sculpture of a woman, the wife of Finn according to legend. It is not known who the man on the column actually represents, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> the Biblical character Samson.|$|E
25|$|Mutationes and mansiones {{were the}} key {{infrastructure}} for the cursus publicus (the imperial postal and transport system), which operated in many provinces of the Roman Empire. The cursus was {{primarily concerned with}} the carriage of government or military officers, government payload such as monies from tax collection and for military wages, and official despatches, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> made available to private individuals with special permission and for a fee. In Britain, the Vindolanda tablets, a series of letters written on wooden tablets to and {{by members of the}} garrison of Hadrian's Wall, show the operation of the cursus on the island.|$|E

25|$|The Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) {{commissioned}} “whole system” tests, {{which are}} designed to see how different cladding systems reacted in a fire. Seven combinations were tested and six deemed dangerous. It reported back in August 2017 that there are 228 buildings in the United Kingdom cladded using these methods. The seventh, a combination of aluminium composite material (ACM) cladding with a limited flammability filling and stone-wool insulation, was deemed safe. There are no existing buildings in the UK using this combination, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> used to reclad all the buildings that are currently using the other combinations. These findings will used to help revise the Building Regulations.|$|E
25|$|Pre-war {{models were}} fitted with thin dia 1.626mm. (0.064 in.) axles and the post war axles were 2.032mm. (0.08 in.). The pre-war hubs were smooth {{and after the}} war, there was a raised part {{in the center of}} the hub. Tracks on the tanks and the 162a Light Dragon Artillery Tractor were done with wire-link {{sprocket}} chain wrapped around the hubs. This gave a mechanical, but not very realistic, appearance to the tracks. With the Anti-Aircraft Gun, the side panels folded and not only did the gun swivel 360 degrees, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> moved from level to about a 50-degree angle upward. The searchlight was also adjustable in horizontal and vertical directions.|$|E
25|$|In Spain {{and in most}} Spanish-{{speaking}} countries, {{the custom}} is for people to have two surnames. Usually the first surname comes from {{the father and the}} second from the mother, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> the other way round. When speaking or in informal situations only the first one is used, although both are needed for legal purpose. A child's first surname will usually be their father's first surname, while the child's second surname will usually be the mother's first surname. For example, if José García Torres and María Acosta Gómez had a child named Pablo, then his full name would be Pablo García Acosta. One family member's relationship to another can often be identified by the various combinations and permutations of surnames.|$|E

25|$|The Bychowiec Chronicle {{provides}} {{a detailed description}} of the life of Petras Goštautas. He is not known from any other sources and details of his life cannot be reliably verified. Some of the details outright contradict facts known from other reliable contemporary sources. For example, Vilnius Voivodeship was established only in 1413 by Vytautas; therefore Goštautas could not be a voivode during the reign of Algirdas. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> a confusion with Jonas Goštautas who was the voivode in 1443–58. The chronicle also mentions that Goštautas was appointed as regent of Podolia by Algirdas; in fact it was Petras Mantigirdaitis who was appointed by Vytautas. Polish historian Kazimierz Chodynicki expressed doubts about Goštautas' marriage to a member of the House of Buczacki as the family came into prominence only after Algirdas' death. Goštautas is also not known as the founder of the Franciscan church and monastery in Vilnius. The first more sizable donation by Goštautai to the Franciscans in Vilnius is known only from 1468. The Bychowiec Chronicle also mentions that the first Bishop of Vilnius was Motiejus, a monk from a local Franciscan monastery. No such bishop is known; the first bishop was Andrzej Jastrzębiec.|$|E
500|$|The {{periscopic}} sights (the {{boxes on}} the side of the mount) allowed the trainer and pointer to see the target from inside the armored enclosure. Each sight had movable prisms that allowed its line of sight to be moved relative to the barrel's bore axis. These prisms could be controlled by the fire control system when the mount was in Automatic, or by the mount's sight setter operator when the mount was in Local. [...] Local control was not the preferred combat method, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> used if the fire control systems were damaged. The mount captain was trained in aiming and correcting the fall of shot.|$|E
500|$|Details of the {{construction}} were {{not found in the}} official histories, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> inferred that {{the construction}} conditions were made especially difficult by the long stretches of mountains and semi-desert that the Great Wall traversed, the sparse populations of these areas, and the frigid winter climate. Although the walls were rammed earth, so the bulk of the building material could be found in situ, transportation of additional supplies and labour remained difficult for the reasons named above. The sinologist Derk Bodde posits in The Cambridge History of China that [...] "for every man whom Meng Tian could put to work at the scene of actual construction, dozens must have been needed to build approaching roads and to transport supplies." [...] This is supported by the Han dynasty statesman Zhufu Yan's description of Qin Shi Huang's Ordos project in 128BC: ...|$|E
