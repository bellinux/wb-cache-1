5|$|At the beginning, {{jumping on}} every cube once {{is enough to}} advance. In later stages, each cube must <b>be</b> <b>hit</b> twice to reach the target color. Other times, cubes change color every time Q*bert lands on them, instead of {{remaining}} on the target color once they reach it. Both elements are then combined in subsequent stages. Jumping off the pyramid results in the character's death.|$|E
5|$|A comet-impact {{mission was}} first {{proposed}} to NASA in 1996, {{but at the}} time, NASA engineers were skeptical that the target could <b>be</b> <b>hit.</b> In 1999, a revised and technologically upgraded mission proposal, dubbed Deep Impact, was accepted and funded as part of NASA's Discovery Program of low-cost spacecraft. The two spacecraft (Impactor and Flyby) and the three main instruments were built and integrated by Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. in Boulder, Colorado. Developing the software for the spacecraft took 18 months and the application code consisted of 20,000 lines and 19 different application threads. The total cost of developing the spacecraft and completing its mission reached US$330million.|$|E

5|$|Both of the {{targeted}} airfields contained sector operations rooms {{from which the}} British fighters were directed into action. These airfields were selected by the Luftwaffe {{because they were the}} largest ones known to be operating RAF fighters. The German intelligence had no knowledge of the sector operations rooms there. The rooms were above ground and had little protection. If these buildings were to <b>be</b> <b>hit,</b> it would be a serious blow to the control system in the region.|$|E
5|$|During the North Sea {{flood of}} 1953, Jaywick was flooded, {{resulting}} {{in the deaths of}} 35 people. Since then, sea defences have been put in place and many precautions have been made to avoid flooding. Coastal Jaywick has benefited from 30,000 cubic metres of dredged sand as part of a £9.4million upgrade. The residential areas are categorised as having the highest risk of flooding in the country, and a council report anticipated that global warming would increase the risk to human life in Jaywick from flooding over the next 50 to 75 years. The area {{would be the first to}} <b>be</b> <b>hit</b> by floods in the event of a tidal surge over the marshes surrounding St Osyth.|$|E
5|$|Each {{level has}} the player follow a linear path through waves of enemies and culminates with a boss. In boss stages the player's craft {{does not move}} forward, but hovers {{in front of the}} boss. Each boss has a single {{vulnerability}} which flashes when hit. These areas are often heavily shielded and must <b>be</b> <b>hit</b> repeatedly to remove armor. Other bosses' vulnerabilities are hidden and appear for only short periods. Most bosses have weapons that fire upon the player or reflect the player's shots. At the end of each level, players receive bonuses for defeated enemies, lives remaining, and the energy level of the player's craft. An extra life is granted if the score reaches certain thresholds.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the standard four difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard, and Expert) for each song and instrument, a new Beginner level has been added in World Tour. This difficulty is aimed for younger and unskilled players; notes are generally simple straight lines in time with bass drum beats, and allowing any or no fret button to be held while the note is strummed (for lead and bass guitar), any drum to <b>be</b> <b>hit</b> (for drums), or any sound to be made (for vocals).|$|E
5|$|King Louis XV honored Franklin {{after seeing}} {{some of the}} {{electrical}} experiments done in the royal palace at St. Germain near Paris, France. However physicist Jean-Antoine Nollet (1700–1770), a skeptic who had published his own theory on electricity, declared Franklin's ideas were wrong. He claimed in 1753 that Franklin's lightning rod was not only dangerous but useless and would attract lightning bolts to wooden buildings, causing them to <b>be</b> <b>hit</b> more often. Franklin in time proved to the scientific community that his lightning rod invention not only was a protective device, but it {{also served as a}} preventive way to divert destructive lightning bolts away from hitting buildings.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} side, the cement {{industry}} in Iran {{is one of}} the economic sectors that will <b>be</b> <b>hit</b> the hardest in Iran following of the subsidy reform plan, because many Iranian cement factories are energy inefficient (Notwithstanding possible adjustment and/or liberalization of commodities prices by the government during implementation). Taxi, delivery and truck drivers have also been adversely affected by the recent gas price increase. Experts believe that the removal of subsidies is likely to have an adverse impact on the profitability of the automotive sector {{for at least the next}} 2–3 years.|$|E

5|$|Rostislav was {{actively}} engaged in World War I until {{the collapse of the}} Black Sea Fleet in the beginning of 1918. She was the first Russian ship to fire on enemy targets on land during World War I, the first to <b>be</b> <b>hit</b> by a German airstrike, and the first to destroy a submarine, albeit a Russian one. In April 1918 the fleeing Bolsheviks abandoned Rostislav in Sevastopol. A year later the British occupation forces permanently disabled her engines. The White forces used the ship as a towed floating battery, then scuttled her in the Strait of Kerch in November 1920.|$|E
5|$|The brawl {{began with}} 45.9seconds {{remaining}} in the game, when Indiana led 97–82. The Pistons' Ben Wallace was fouled from behind by the Pacers' Ron Artest (now known as Metta World Peace), who slapped him {{across the back of}} the head during a layup attempt. Wallace later said that Artest had warned him he would <b>be</b> <b>hit.</b> Wallace responded by shoving Artest in the face with both hands, causing players from both teams to quickly get in between them as they attempted to keep Wallace and Artest separated.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{presented}} in an isometric format. The player assumes {{the role of a}} knight who enters the plague-infested village of Nightshade to vanquish four demons who reside within. Additionally, all residents from the village have been transformed into vampires and other supernatural creatures. Contact with these monsters infects the knight, with repeated contact turning the character from white to yellow and then to green, which will lead to the character's death. The knight may <b>be</b> <b>hit</b> up to three times by an enemy, however the fourth hit will result in a life being deducted.|$|E

5|$|Akash (Ranbir Kapoor) {{lives in}} New York City; he has bankrupted his company {{and is in}} need of $12 million for paying the shareholders, but is unable to obtain a loan due to a stock market crash. He decides to jump off the George Washington Bridge. He meets Kiara (Priyanka Chopra), from San Francisco, who is also suicidal after {{catching}} her fiancé Kunal (Zayed Khan) cheating on her. Akash and Kiara attempt to kill themselves, but are prevented from doing so by the Coast Guard. Still suicidal, Akash deliberately allows himself to <b>be</b> <b>hit</b> by a car, and Kiara falls on the bridge and breaks her neck. Their suicide attempts are unsuccessful, and they end up in hospital together. When they are discharged, Kiara takes Akash to her apartment because his house has been seized by the bank.|$|E
5|$|Although Niémen {{was very}} badly damaged, Amethyst was almost {{uncontrollable}} and despite Seymour's best efforts, {{he was unable}} to close with Niémen to ensure her surrender. Dupotet meanwhile was overseeing hasty repairs in the hope of getting away before Amethyst could recover. At 03:45, however, a new ship emerged from the darkness, soon revealed to be the British frigate HMS Arethusa. Arethusa was deployed as part of the force blockading the ports of Northern Spain and her commander, Captain Robert Mends, was a successful officer who had been commended just two weeks earlier for raiding the French-held port of Lekeitio. Mends immediately pulled alongside Niémen and Dupotet fired a single shot each at Amethyst and Arethusa. The shot at Amethyst missed its target, but the one at Arethusa struck the ship and threw up splinters. Mends was struck on the forehead and badly wounded, the only man to <b>be</b> <b>hit.</b> Both Amethyst and Arethusa then opened fire, Niémen surrendering immediately.|$|E
5|$|By 17:35, Sydney {{was heading}} south and losing speed, wreathed in smoke from {{multiple}} fires. Her main armament was disabled (the two aft turrets had jammed on a port facing {{and could not}} be swung around), and her secondary guns were out of effective range. The cruiser continued to <b>be</b> <b>hit</b> by shells from Kormorans aft guns as the distance between the ships increased. The Germans reported that around 17:45, all four torpedoes from Sydneys starboard launcher were fired, but as Kormoran was manoeuvring to bring her port broadside to bear, they all missed. In fact, only two torpedoes from Sydneys port launcher were ever fired, which must have happened some time earlier. The raider's engines broke down after this turn, but she continued to fire on Sydney at a high rate despite being immobilised, although many of the shells would have missed as the distance between the two ships increased. Kormoran ceased fire at 17:50, with the range at , and launched another torpedo at 18:00, but missed Sydney.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{impending}} divorce, Farrar initially declined {{to move out}} of the family home. He was concerned that Green, who had never been a heavy drinker of alcohol, was suddenly consuming large quantities of it while supervising the children. Though Green continued her routine of ferrying the children to after-school activities, she would spend her evenings drinking at home, sometimes to the point of unconsciousness and nearly always until she lost what inhibitions she had left about her language in front of the children. On one occasion, Farrar was called home from work by the children, who had found their mother unresponsive. Green had disappeared from the home by the time Farrar arrived there, and though he eventually discovered that she had been hiding in the basement while he searched for her, she claimed at the time to have been wandering the town, hoping to <b>be</b> <b>hit</b> by a car. Farrar moved out of the family home in early autumn due to concerns about his personal safety.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the game, the player must acquire twelve Artifacts, which are prizes that are awarded after {{completing}} objectives such as winning minigames or beating bosses. Once having acquired twelve Artifacts, the player is granted access to a table called the Artifact Temple, which places six balls on the table at the same time. To complete the table, twelve different targets must <b>be</b> <b>hit</b> with the balls while they are bombarded by attacks from Meta Ridley, one of the antagonists of the Metroid Prime series. If all of the balls are lost, the table ends; the player does not lose any of the twelve Artifacts already collected but is forced to revisit another table and complete it before being allowed a second attempt at the Artifact Temple. Upon completing the Artifact Temple, access is granted to the final table, Impact Crater. After the player defeats the Metroid Prime creature on the Impact Crater table, the game unlocks a higher difficulty level, Expert mode.|$|E
5|$|HMS Colossus was {{the lead}} ship of her class of two {{dreadnought}} battleships built for the Royal Navy {{at the end of}} the first decade of the 20th century. She spent her whole career assigned to the Home and Grand Fleets, often serving as a flagship. Aside from participating in the Battle of Jutland in May 1916 and the inconclusive Action of 19 August, her service during World War I generally consisted of routine patrols and training in the North Sea. Colossus was the only dreadnought from the main body of the Grand Fleet to <b>be</b> <b>hit</b> during the Battle of Jutland, although she suffered only minor damage. The ship was deemed obsolete after the war and was reduced to reserve and then became a training ship. Colossus was hulked in 1923 and sold for scrap in 1928.|$|E
