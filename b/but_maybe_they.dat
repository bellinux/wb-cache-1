Piero takes her to his parents' apartment, which is filled with beautiful works of art and sculpture.

Piero comes to the bedroom and they make love.|$|R

If there are—if, for instance, there are possible but non-actual dogs (dogs of some non-actual but possible species, perhaps) or nonexistent beings (like Sherlock Holmes, perhaps)—then these things might also figure in the extensions of various concepts and expressions. If not, only existing, actual things can be in the extension of a concept or expression. Note that [...] "actual" [...] may not mean the same as [...] "existing". Perhaps there exist things that are merely possible, <b>but</b> not actual.

30|$|The {{mechanism}} of how mild hypothermia could reduce CMRO 2 is still unclear. Recent {{studies have shown}} that mild hypothermia and anesthesia can both reduce cerebral oxygen metabolism safely (Ouchi et al. 2006). <b>But</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> have different mechanisms. One study found that (Michenfelder 2002), constant infusion of anesthetic initially produced the expected progressive decrease in CMRO 2 until a mean decrease to about 58 %. Thereafter, despite continued administration of anesthetic, no further effect on CMRO 2 was observed. Anesthetics, mainly by reducing cerebral electrical activity to decrease CMRO 2, revealed no alteration in normal cerebral metabolic pathways, hence it would provide no cerebral protection during hypoxia. In another study, German scholars observed the effect of mild hypothermia on CMRO 2 and cerebral function through an increase in intracranial pressure (ICP), and subsequent decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) to reduce CBF (Bauer et al. 2000). This study found that mild hypothermia improved cerebral oxygen balance by reduction of brain energy demand. The brain electrical activity was less suppressed under hypothermia during severe blood flow reduction, which indicated that hypothermic neuroprotection may involve some other mechanisms. And further studies are needed to make it clear.|$|E

Mere identification of the task is not enough. Of course one could find dozens of problems where spatial sound reproduction has a practical relevance. More interesting are those which reside on a high cognitive level. Tasks that combine visual stimuli and auditive perception with movement provide a wide field of activity like for example crossing a busy road, an every day task that contains a high information density and demands fast processing by the brain. But how does hearing have an impact on this? Does spatial audio lead to better performance? Can one adjust naturalistic, spatialized hearing virtually?

Recently, several studies point {{to the importance of}} customer experience management (CEM). However, if the CEM is a strategy to focus on operations and processes of a business around the customers’ experiences with the company, it is essential to seek grants to structure it and find out its effectiveness. This study examines the issues involved in offering superior customer experiences on fashion retail stores in Brazil, identifying the relation between productivity and CEM. Through a research with managers of three important Brazilian clothing retail chains, it was possible to analyze the aspects that impact on the customer experience and their relevance. A questionnaire was applied to evaluate 23 variables that make up the experience of the customer and their impact on increasing productivity. Some statistical techniques were used for data processing and it was possible to realize that only 4 of the 23 items were not relevant for customer experience. It can be concluded that CEM is effective in increasing productivity and {{can be used as a}} guideline matrix management in decision-making to promote superior customer experiences. Specific characteristics of each segment suggest different impacts in every aspect. Therefore, it is crucial that each segment review its own variables that will structure the CEM.

40|$|Purpose and Questions: There seem {{to exist}} {{diametrically}} different views regarding Rwanda’s political sphere, whether {{the country has}} made any progress at all since the 90 s, {{and if they have}} been successful in establishing democracy or not. A field study was therefore carried out, plus additional research to get a more comprehensive view of the political sphere of Rwanda. The purpose of the field study was to experience and analyse the political ambiance and developments by personal experience and interview people on the ground, rather then just rely on books, media and other academics, in order to clarify if the country is progressing or not. These questions guided my research: Has Rwanda been successful in establishing democracy, in terms of fulfilling the criteria’s that constitutes “polyarchy”? - What are the democracy attitudes of the citizens? Has Rwanda made any progress at all the last decade (not just politically, but socio- economically as well), in other words is the country undergoing a modernization process? Method: This research took its first step in a minor field study (MFS), conducted in Rwanda in the summer of 2010, and later as field research again in February/ March of 2011. In order to fulfil the purpose this research undertook both qualitative and quantitative methods, in a two-part analysis, in which there are a total of one qualitative part and two more quantitative parts. Results and Conclusion: The analysis shows that Rwanda is progressing, not just politically, but socio-economically as well. The qualitative part shows that some political and civic rights seem to be curtailed, {{but it is important to}} remember the legacy of a genocide. The survey however shows that over half of the respondents believe (to some extent) that democratic principles are being respected, and that there exist political pluralism and political space in Rwanda. The genocaidaires could come back to power through democratic practices, therefore it is important that things develop carefully and that a strong leadership rules the country. The government has really managed to bring Rwanda back up on its feet and the country is clearly progressing. Rwanda can serve as a model for other countries to follow. Despite the war and ethnic diversity Rwanda has come a long way. The country seem to have established some form of democratic principles, not the same as we have in the West off course, <b>but</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> can’t and shouldn’t follow the models of the West since they have their own special context they have to live up to...|$|E
