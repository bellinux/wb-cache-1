5|$|A {{study of}} D. horneri skulls suggest that unlike many depictions of tyrannosaurids, this genus and likely other tyrannosaurids did not possess lips. Comparisons {{of the skull}} of this species with modern {{crocodiles}} show the same rugose <b>bone</b> <b>structure</b> that indicates the presence of large flat scales as opposed to lips. As the rough texture descends almost to the tooth line, it is theorized that Daspletosaurus teeth were not covered by lips, as {{there would have been}} no room for such soft tissue.|$|E
5|$|Histological {{examination}} {{reveals that}} pachycephalosaurid domes {{are composed of}} a unique form of fibrolamellar bone which contains fibroblasts that {{play a critical role}} in wound healing, and are capable of rapidly depositing bone during remodeling. Peterson et al. (2013) concluded that taken together, the frequency of lesion distribution and the <b>bone</b> <b>structure</b> of frontoparietal domes, lends strong support to the hypothesis that pachycephalosaurids used their unique cranial structures for agonistic behavior. CT scan comparisons of the skulls of Stegoceras validum, Prenocephale prenes, and several head-striking artiodactyls have also supported pachycephalosaurids as being well-equipped for head-butting.|$|E
5|$|Cetotheriidae {{consists}} {{of only one}} living member: the pygmy right whale (Caperea marginata). The first descriptions {{date back to the}} 1840s of bones and baleen plates resembling a smaller version of the right whale, and was named Balaena marginata. In 1864, it was moved into the genus Caperea after a skull of another specimen was discovered. Six years later, the pygmy right whale was classified under the family Neobalaenidae. Despite its name, the pygmy right whale is more genetically similar to rorquals and gray whales than to right whales. A study published in 2012, based on <b>bone</b> <b>structure,</b> moved the pygmy right whale from the family Neobalaenidae to the family Cetotheriidae, making it a living fossil; Neobalaenidae was elevated down to subfamily level as Neobalaeninae.|$|E

Knowledge of how thin <b>bone</b> <b>structures</b> can be or of what low density to be detectable in clinical CT images can increase the diagnostic competence to diagnose various diseases. Correlation between size and density of detectable <b>bone</b> <b>structures</b> is the key for many diagnosis purposes. This paper describes the use of clinical 64 detector scanner to image the skeletons of codfish and salmon species. Fish skeletons, such as codfish and salmon, have petite <b>structures</b> and lower <b>bone</b> density than humans. <b>Bone</b> <b>structures</b> were segmented out of the image data and 3 D models of their skeletons developed. Evaluation was done by means of comparing quantitative measurements of selected bones to parameters observed from the model.

5|$|Even though alpha {{radiation}} cannot penetrate the skin, ingested or inhaled plutonium does irradiate internal organs. Alpha particles generated by inhaled plutonium {{have been found}} to cause lung cancer in a cohort of European nuclear workers. The skeleton, where plutonium accumulates, and the liver, where it collects and becomes concentrated, are at risk. Plutonium is not absorbed into the body efficiently when ingested; only 0.04% of plutonium oxide is absorbed after ingestion. Plutonium absorbed by the body is excreted very slowly, with a biological half-life of 200 years. Plutonium passes only slowly through cell membranes and intestinal boundaries, so absorption by ingestion and incorporation into <b>bone</b> <b>structure</b> proceeds very slowly.|$|E
5|$|Good {{conformation}} in {{the limbs}} leads to improved movement and decreased likelihood of injuries. Large differences in <b>bone</b> <b>structure</b> and size {{can be found}} in horses used for different activities, but correct conformation remains relatively similar across the spectrum. Structural defects, as well as other problems such as injuries and infections, can cause lameness, or movement at an abnormal gait. Injuries to and problems with horse legs can be relatively minor, such as stocking up, which causes swelling without lameness, or quite serious. Even non-fatal leg injuries can be fatal to horses, as their bodies are designed to bear weight on all four legs and serious problems can result if this is not possible.|$|E
5|$|Velociraptor was warm-blooded to some degree, as it {{required}} {{a significant amount}} of energy to hunt. Modern animals that possess feathery or furry coats, like Velociraptor did, tend to be warm-blooded, since these coverings function as insulation. However, bone growth rates in dromaeosaurids and some early birds suggest a more moderate metabolism, compared with most modern warm-blooded mammals and birds. The kiwi is similar to dromaeosaurids in anatomy, feather type, <b>bone</b> <b>structure</b> and even the narrow anatomy of the nasal passages (usually a key indicator of metabolism). The kiwi is a highly active, if specialized, flightless bird, with a stable body temperature and a fairly low resting metabolic rate, making it a good model for the metabolism of primitive birds and dromaeosaurids.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Rib cage {{structure}} and morphology {{is important for}} anatomical analysis of chest CT scans. A fundamental challenge in rib cage extraction is varying intensity levels and connection with adjacent <b>bone</b> <b>structures</b> including shoulder blade and sternum. In this study, we present a fully automated 3 -D algorithm to segment the rib cage by detection and separa-tion of other <b>bone</b> <b>structures.</b> The proposed approach consists of four steps. First, all high-intensity <b>bone</b> <b>structures</b> are segmented. Second, multi-scale Hessian analysis is performed to capture plateness and vesselness information. Third, with the plate/vessel features, <b>bone</b> <b>structures</b> other than rib cage are detected. Last, the detected bones are separated from rib cage with iterative relative fuzzy connectedness method. The algorithm was evaluated using 400 human CT scans and 100 small animal images with various resolution. The results suggested that the percent accuracy of rib cage extraction is over 95 % with the proposed algorithm.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{establish}} a three–dimensional {{model of the}} temporal bone using CT scan images for study of temporal <b>bone</b> <b>structures</b> and simulation of mastoidectomy procedures. MethodsCT scan images from 6 individuals (12 temporal bones) were used to reconstruct the Fallopian canal, internal auditory canal, cochlea, semicircular canals, sigmoid sinus, posterior fossa floor and jugular bulb on a computer platform. Their anatomical relations within the temporal bone were restored in the computed model. The same model was used to simulate mastoidectomy procedures. ResultsThe reconstructed computer model provided accurate and clear three–dimensional images of temporal <b>bone</b> <b>structures.</b> Simulation of mastoidectomy using these images provided procedural experiences closely mimicking the real surgical procedure. ConclusionComputer–aided three dimensional reconstruction of temporal <b>bone</b> <b>structures</b> using CT scan images is a useful tool in surgical simulation and can aid surgical procedure planning.

5|$|Hieronymus, in 2009, {{concluded}} that the nasal and supraorbital bosses were used for butting or ramming the head or the flank of a rival. The <b>bone</b> <b>structure</b> indicates that the bosses were covered by cornified pads as in modern muskoxen, suggesting dominance fights {{similar to those of}} members of the Caprinae subfamily. In the latter group, an evolutionary transition can be observed, where the originally straight horns become more robust, padded, and increasingly curved downwards. The evolution from horncores into bosses in Centrosaurinae would likewise have reflected a change in fighting technique, from clashing to high-energy head-butting. Head-butting would have been an expensive and risky behavior. Opponents would only have engaged this way after assessing each other's strengths visually. For this reason, Hieronymus considered it unlikely that the bosses served for species recognition as this was already guaranteed by the innate species-specific display rituals preceding a real – instead of a ritual – fight. The bosses would have evolved for actual combat, part of a social selection in which individuals competed for scarce resources such as mates, food and breeding grounds.|$|E
5|$|The Heck {{brothers}} bred together several European small {{horse and}} pony breeds hypothesized to be {{descended from the}} tarpan. They eventually integrated mares of the Konik, Icelandic horse, and Gotland breeds. These mares were bred to stallions of a wild horse type known as Przewalski's horse. The Hecks believed the wild Przewalski blood would help to draw out the wild characteristics they felt lay dormant in the domesticated pony breed mares. The initial crosses were made between Gotland and Icelandic mares (who visually closely resembled the tarpan, especially {{in the shape of}} the head) and Przewalski's horse stallions (who provided the desired dun coloration and upright mane), and the offspring were then bred to each other. The first foal born from the program who had the desired coloration was a colt born on May 22, 1933 at the Tierpark Hellabrunn. The breeding program continued, using only those horses who showed the desired skull shape, <b>bone</b> <b>structure</b> and coloration. Relatively quickly, the breed's conformation and coloration became set, with parents reliably passing their characteristics onto their offspring.|$|E
5|$|The ages of {{individual}} aetosaurs {{can be determined}} by examining their osteoderms. Some isolated osteoderms have been claimed to belong to juvenile aetosaurs based on their size and shape but these hypotheses have often been questioned. For example, juvenile osteoderms of Calyptosuchus were later identified {{as those of the}} small-bodied pseudosuchian Revueltosaurus (which is not an aetosaur), and juvenile osteoderms of Desmatosuchus have been reinterpreted as those of aetosaur Acaenasuchus, which had a relatively small body size at maturity. Studies of the <b>bone</b> <b>structure</b> of paramedian osteoderms indicate that new bone was deposited along the edges of each plate over the course of an aetosaur's lifetime. This means that lines of arrested growth on the undersides of paramedian osteoderms can be used to determine an individual's age. Comparing the ages {{of individual}} specimens with their total body lengths indicates that aetosaurs increased in length at relatively constant rates, but increased in body mass at different rates depending on whether they had wide bodies like Typothorax or narrow bodies like Aetobarbakinoides. Aetosaurs also seem to have grown more slowly than modern crocodilians. Analysis of the limb bones of aetosaurs indicates that they grew quickly when young and more slowly when adults. This pattern of growth is seen in most other pseudosuchians.|$|E

25|$|The growth speed {{relevant}} to this question can be independently measured by researching the <b>bone</b> <b>structure.</b> In 1998 Zhang determined that growth was fast, leading to fibrolamellar bone.

The growth speed of Confuciusornis would have been similar to that of Beipiaosaurus. A study by Armand de Ricqlès in 2003 indicated that growth was essentially modern, Confuciusornis reaching its maximum size in at most twenty weeks, perhaps as few as thirteen. Basal birds would have limited their size, not by slowing growth but by limiting the period of growth. A 2013 study found medullary bone in a short tailed specimen, confirming that it was female.|$|E
