25|$|One of the best-recognized {{theories}} {{that leads to}} copy number variations as well as deletions and inversions is non-allelic homologous recombinations. During meiotic recombination, homologous chromosomes pair up and form two ended double-stranded breaks leading to Holliday junctions. However, in the aberrant mechanism, during the formation of Holliday junctions, the double-stranded breaks are misaligned and the crossover lands in non-allelic positions on the same chromosome. When the Holliday junction is resolved, the unequal crossing over event allows transfer of genetic material between the two homologous chromosomes, and as a result, {{a portion of the}} DNA on both the homologues is repeated. Since the repeated regions are no longer segregating independently, the duplicated region of the chromosome is inherited. Another type of homologous recombination based mechanism that can lead to copy number variation is known as break induced replication. When a double stranded break occurs in the genome unexpectedly the cell activates pathways that mediate the repair of the break. Errors in repairing the break, similar to non-allelic homologous recombination, can lead to an increase in copy number of a particular region of the genome. During the repair of a double stranded break, the <b>broken</b> <b>end</b> can invade its homologous chromosome instead of rejoin the original strand. As in the non-allelic homologous recombination mechanism, an extra copy of a particular region is transferred to another chromosome, leading to a duplication event. Furthermore, cohesin proteins are found to aid in the repair system of double stranded breaks through clamping the two ends in close proximity which prevents interchromosomal invasion of the ends. If for any reason, such as activation of ribosomal RNA, cohesin activity is affected then there may be local increase in double stranded break repair errors.|$|E

2500|$|A pair of [...] long {{self-acting}} mules with 1320 spindles {{each would}} be tended by three employees: the minder or operative spinner, the big piecer, {{and the little}} piecer. The little piecer would start in the mulegate on his fourteenth birthday, and rise {{to the status of}} a minder. All these men worked barefoot, wearing white light cotton trousers. There were four basic tasks: creeling, doffing, cleaning and piecing. Creeling and piecing would both be done while the mule was in motion. Creeling was about replacing the bobbins in the creel while piecing the old disappearing thread with the new; it was done from behind the mule. Piecing was about joining any ends that had broken.The piecer would catch the snarled fuzzy <b>broken</b> <b>end</b> {{at the top of the}} spindle in his right hand and pull out some clean thread and wrap it around the left forefinger. This would be pressed into clean roving emerging from the attenuating rollers, pulling the hand away when the two had twisted together. All this was done while walking back and forth with the carriage, contact being made using the three of four seconds when the piecer was close enough to lean over the frame and reach the rollers. At this moment, left arm and leg forward, his crotch was adjacent to the base of the spindles.|$|E

30|$|DNA {{double strand}} break repair (DSBR) pathways are {{generally}} classified {{based on whether}} sequence homology is used to join the <b>broken</b> DNA <b>ends.</b> Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which does not depend upon sequence homology, is the key repair pathway during the G 0 /G 1 stages of the cell cycle [10]. During NHEJ, once a DSB is formed the <b>broken</b> <b>ends</b> are bound by Ku proteins (ku 70 and ku 80), which form a heterodimer and insulate the DNA ends from nucleolytic erosion [11, 12]. The Ku proteins foster direct ligation of the <b>broken</b> DNA <b>ends</b> by the specialized ligase complex Dnl 4 –Lif 1 [12]. This complex can execute a blunt end ligation reaction on clean DNA ends, i.e. 3 ′-OH and 5 ′-phosphate groups. If the <b>broken</b> DNA <b>ends</b> are not clean, then further processing by nucleases and polymerases are necessary to ligate the loose ends [12]. However, {{in the midst of}} this process of genome editing, small deletions and insertions might be introduced at the junction site. This is why this pathway if often regarded to be an error-prone recovery mechanism [2, 13, 14].|$|R
40|$|HeT-A {{elements}} {{are a new}} family of transposable elements in Drosophila that are found exclusively in telomeric regions and in the pericentric heterochromatin. Transposition of these elements onto <b>broken</b> chromosome <b>ends</b> has been implicated in chromosome healing. To monitor the fate of HeT-A elements that had attached to <b>broken</b> <b>ends</b> of the X chromosome, we examined individual X chromosomes from a defined population {{over a period of}} 17 generations. The ends of the X chromosomes with new HeT-A additions receded {{at the same rate as}} the <b>broken</b> <b>ends</b> before the HeT-A elements attached. In addition, some chromosomes, approximately 1 % per generation, had acquired new HeT-A sequences of an average of 6 kb at their ends with oligo(A) tails at the junctions. Thus, the rate of addition of new material per generation matches the observed rate of terminal loss (70 - 75 bp) caused by incomplete replication at the end of the DNA molecule. One such recently transposed HeT-A element which is at least 12 kb in length has been examined in detail. It contains a single open reading frame of 2. 8 kb which codes for a gag-like protein...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The {{effect of}} a TiO 2 {{nanoparticle}} suspension (4 mg in 5 ml distilled water) doped or not with gold or iron, complexed or not with α- or β-cyclodextrin, on the mitotic division was studied. The treatment was performed in the M cellular mitotic cycle phase, in the meristematic tissue of Nigella damascena radicels, being analyzed the cytogenetic modifications. The cyclodextrin type and the ratio between cyclodextrin and titanium dioxide affect the percentage of normal cells and the chromosome aberration type. The TiO 2 complexed with α-cyclodextrin did not facilitate the reunion of the chromosome <b>broken</b> <b>ends</b> (absence of bridges in anaphase and in telophase). The titanium dioxide doped with iron, complexed with α- or β-cyclodextrin, also reduced the percentage of reunion of the <b>broken</b> <b>ends</b> of the chromosomes.

6000|$|Broken Bones.--It is {{extremely}} improbable {{that a man}} should die, in consequence of a broken leg or arm, if the skin be uninjured' but, if the <b>broken</b> <b>end</b> forces {{its way through the}} flesh, the injury is a very serious one.

40|$|Oxidative DNA {{damage is}} {{produced}} by reactive oxygen species (ROS) which are generated by exogenous and endogenous sources and continuously challenge the cell. One of the most severe DNA lesions is the double-strand break (DSB), which is mainly repaired by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway in mammals. NHEJ directly joins the <b>broken</b> <b>ends,</b> without using the homologous template. Ku 70 / 86 heterodimer, also known as Ku, is the first component of NHEJ as it directly binds DNA and recruits other NHEJ factors to promote the repair of the <b>broken</b> <b>ends.</b> Neurons are particularly metabolically active, displaying high rates of transcription and translation, which are associated with high metabolic and mitochondrial activity as well as oxygen consumption. In such a way, excessive oxygen radicals can be generated and constantly attack DNA, thereby producing several lesions.
