50|$|Elxsi (now Tata Elxsi) was a {{minicomputer}} {{manufacturing company}} {{established in the}} late 1970s along {{with a host of}} other competitors (Trilogy Systems, Sequent, Convex Computer) in Silicon Valley, USA. The Elxsi processor was an Emitter Coupled Logic (ECL) design that featured a 50 nanosecond clock, a 25 nanosecond <b>backpanel</b> bus, IEEE floating point arithmetic and a 64-bit architecture. It allowed multiple processors to communicate over a common bus called the Gigabus, {{believed to be the first}} company to do so. The operating system was a message based operating system called EMBOS. The Elxsi CPU was a microcoded design, allowing custom instructions to be coded into microcode.|$|E
5000|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, United Video began {{encouraging}} cable systems still using either the full- or split-screen {{versions of the}} Amiga 1000-based EPG Sr. to upgrade to the Amiga 2000-based Prevue Guide. Active support for the Amiga 1000-based EPG Sr. installations was discontinued in 1993. Like the Amiga 1000-based EPG Sr., Prevue Guide also ran from bootable 3Â½ diskettes, and its locally customizable features remained configurable only from the local keyboard, subjecting viewers to the same on-screen maintenance-related interruptions by local cable company employees as before (silent remote administration of locally customizable features would not be added until the [...] "yellow grid" [...] appeared shortly after {{the beginning of the}} TV Guide Channel era, when the Amiga platform was fully abandoned). To support Prevue Guide's new, satellite-delivered video and audio, each Amiga 2000 featured a UV Corp. UVGEN video/genlock card for the satellite feed's video and a Zephyrus Electronics Ltd model 100 rev. C demodulator/switching ISA card for manipulating the feed's audio. Also included were a Zephyrus Electronics Ltd. model 101 rev. C demodulator ISA card for the WGN data stream, and a Great Valley Products Zorro II A2000 HC+8 Series II card (used only for 2 MB of Fast RAM with SCSI disabled). The 101C fed demodulated listings data at 2400 baud from a DE9 RS232 serial connector on its <b>backpanel</b> to the Amiga's stock DB25 RS232 serial port via a short cable. The 101C also featured connection terminals for contact closure triggering of external cable system video playback equipment.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a complete technology family for parallel optical interconnect systems. Key features are the two-dimensional on-chip optical access {{and the development}} of a complete optical pathway. This covers both chip-to-chip links on a single boards, chip-to-chip links over an optical <b>backpanel,</b> and even system-to-system interconnects. Therefore it is a scalable technology. The design of all parts of the link, and the integration of parallel optical interconnect systems in the design flow of electronic systems is presented in this paper...|$|E
40|$|Thin-film {{inverters}} {{based on}} high mobility microcrystalline silicon thin-film transistors (TFTs) with different channel lengths were realized. The NMOS enhancement load saturation mode (NELS) inverters were prepared by plasma-enhanced {{chemical vapor deposition}} at temperatures below 200 degrees C. The realization of microcrystalline silicon thin-film inverters facilitates the direct integration of column and row drivers and circuitry on display <b>backpanels.</b> The influence of the transistor properties and underlying contact effects {{on the performance of}} the inverters will be discussed.
