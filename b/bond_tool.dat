It {{was discovered that}} small voids exist in the photobumps. These are typically {{at the base of}} the bump and are believed to have always been present. Although the reliability test results have been positive and no failure is attributed to voids, the process development work during the last quarter has focused on understanding how these form and how to reduce them. High feed pressure, slow nozzle speed and lower viscosity reduce void formation. Nozzle design changes have been identified. One change will increase the shearing of the paste during feed, thus reducing the viscosity, a second change will allow higher feed pressures. Chip bonding process development has focused on correlating bonding results between the IBM in-house chip bonder made by Research Devices, Inc. and the Universal development <b>bond</b> <b>tool.</b> Two variables have been identified that correlate with poor bond results.

30|$|The {{ultrasonic}} {{pulse echo}} method {{is one of}} the primary methods for detection of important parameters outside the well casings (Ellis and Singer 2007). The radial measurement technique of this method reduces the effect of the microannulus (Guo et al. 2009) outside the casing pipe and is much less sensitive to tool centralization (Tubman et al. 1984). However, the method has some inherent measurement problems. Numerous studies have tried to eliminate several of these problems. Albert et al. (1988) analyzed the ability of cement bond logs (CBL), ratio <b>bond</b> <b>tool</b> (RBT), and pulse echo tool (PET) logs to detect channels in the casing circumference using a physical model. Pialucha and Cawley (1994) studied the relationship of impedances, layer thickness, and wavelength of the ultrasonic waves employed. Yao et al. (2002, 2005) carried out a quantitative inversion of the wave impedance and the thickness of the media outside the casing pipe with a composite reflection coefficient. Che and Qiao (2003) and Ding et al. (2011) analyzed the spectral properties of reflected waves and developed a semi-quantitative detection method for wave impedance and thickness of the casing pipe. Yuning and Xiaoyu (2013) studied the effect of the microannulus on acoustic amplitude. Yuhuan et al. (2014) analyzed the effect of microannulus size on sonic wave propagation. The studies described above revealed the existence of a complex multi-peak-search problem in thickness determination. The above methods overcome this problem by transformations of the objective function. However, the accuracy of the determination methods depends on accurate parameter estimation (e.g., the thickness of the casing pipe). In practice, it is difficult to measure or estimate these parameters accurately.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- The {{demand for}} {{increased}} computing power {{and more complex}} integrated circuit devices with increased functions per chip results in high lead-count integrated circuit packages. With the shrinkage in integrated circuit sizes towards smaller packages, and the decrease in pad pitch, the trend is moving from the current ultra-fine-pitch volume production of 50 µm to even lower pad pitches. However, the various concerns for 50 -µm pitch bonding, such as low production yield, reliability issues, etc, have forced many customers to re-visit the feasibility of utilising the robust fine pitch bonding to handle the high lead-count packages. This paper reports the new development of <b>bonding</b> <b>tools</b> to handle the multi-tier wire bonding requirement with a maximum loop height of 475 µm. With {{the increase in the}} loop height of the wires, the bottleneck height of the capillary needs to be increased accordingly to prevent touching the adjacent wire during bonding. The increase in bottleneck height can influence the efficient transfer of the ultrasonic energy from the <b>bonding</b> <b>tool</b> to the <b>bond</b> interface and affect bond quality. In addition, the longer bottleneck height of the capillary also increases the risk of tip breakage during bonding. In this study, the external profile of the capillary is simulated with respect to the looping profile during bonding using a customised software package. In addition, finite element simulation is also utilised to analyse the difference in stress level with different <b>bonding</b> <b>tool</b> designs. The results of the simulations are then used to correlate with the actual bonding responses...|$|R

40|$|Thermosonic {{flip-chip}} bonding is a wire bonding technology modified for flip-chip assembly. Compared with the soldering technology, it is simpler, {{faster and more}} costeffective. Unfortunately, the yield of thermosonic bonding is low and unreliable because {{it is difficult to}} control the ultrasonic energy transmission. A small planarity angle between the <b>bonding</b> <b>tool</b> and stage can result in a nonuniform ultrasonic energy distribution. A self-planarization concept was proposed to solve this problem. A layer of polymer was placed between the <b>bonding</b> <b>tool</b> and the chip to smooth the non-planar contact. Experimental measurements and finite element modeling were used to study the effect of the polymer layer. Results showed that the polymer layer could assure a uniform ultrasonic energy distribution; however, it also reduced the energy transmission efficiency.

For a 1000 -I/O flip chip assembly with a 250 μm pitch using a bonder with a 0. 01 ° planarity angle, polymer thickness of 350 μm and a Young’s modulus of 2 GPa were selected. 1...|$|R
5000|$|An {{important}} {{application for}} compliant bonding {{arose in the}} early 1960s, when techniques were developed for fabricating a “beam leaded silicon integrated circuit “chip” consisting of pre-attached electroformed 0.005-inch thick gold leads or “beams” extending from the silicon chip (Figure 5). Thus the beam leaded “chip” eliminated the need to thermosonically bond wires directly onto metallized pads of the fragile silicon chip (as shown in Figure 6) The extended ends of the electroformed beams could then be permanently solid-state bonded to a matching metallized sunburst circuit which has been pre-deposted on a ceramic substrate appropriately packaged in a computer in the making. Figure 7. shows a preshaped hard faced <b>tool</b> thermocompression <b>bonding</b> all of the beam leads of a chip in one bonding cycle. In order to avoid excessively deforming the fine beam leads with the hard <b>bonding</b> <b>tool</b> and putting them at risk of mechanical failure, the applied bonding forces have to be carefully monitored.The invention of compliant bonding eliminated {{the problems associated with}} a hard faced <b>bonding</b> <b>tool</b> and therefore was ideally suited to simultaneously bond all of the extended electroplated gold beam leads to a matching gold metallized sunburst patterned ceramic substrate packaged in a computer (Figure 8). For example, compliant bonding eliminated the problems of using a hard faced <b>bonding</b> <b>tool</b> such as: attempting to uniformly deform the nominally 0.005-inch thick beams leads having slight variations in their thickness; excessive lead deformation that could cause mechanical damage and an ultimate [...] "costly" [...] failure of these fine beam leaded silicon chips which are the [...] "brains" [...] of our computers. The compliant bonding tape media offered the additional advantage of carrying the [...] "beam leaded silicon chip" [...] to the bonding site thus facilitating production. Figures 9. and 10 show that the compliant tape offers the advantage of carrying the beam leaded chip to the bonding site as discussed above. Figure 11 shows a beam leaded silicon integrated circuit compliantly bonded to a gold metallized sunburst pattern deposited on an alumina ceramic substrate which will be encapsulated and packaged in a computer-type device. Figure 12 shows the spent compliant member used to bond the chip in Figure 11 which clearly shows a mirror image of the uniformly bonded beam leads.|$|R
