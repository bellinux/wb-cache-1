That's the newest boom around Marco. But Hardman has <b>big</b> <b>interests</b> here in town. It's rumored he's {{back of the}} Yellow Mine, the biggest saloon an' gamblin' hell in town." ...|$|E

One thing is certain, Dewey's victory at Manila isn't going {{to be such a}} smooth thing out there, for the Filipinos {{are in a state of}} revolt and won't want us to govern them any more than they want the Spanish; and besides, Germany, France, and other nations have <b>big</b> <b>interests</b> there." ...|$|E
60|$|Belding {{was not so}} busy as he {{had been}} formerly. As he lost {{ambition}} he began to find less work to do. His wrath at the usurping Chases increased as he slowly realized his powerlessness to cope with such men. They were promoters, men of <b>big</b> <b>interests</b> and wide influence in the Southwest. The more they did for Forlorn River the less reason there seemed to be for his own grievance. He had to admit that it was personal; that he and Gale and the rangers would never have been able to develop the resources of the valley as these men were doing it.|$|E
6000|$|... "It didn't," [...] Mr. Dunster admitted, [...] "partly {{owing to}} you. There {{were only two}} things needed: France to {{consider}} her own <b>big</b> <b>interests</b> and to ignore an entente from which she gains nothing that was not assured to her under the new agreement, and the money. Strange," [...] Mr. Dunster continued, [...] "how people forget that factor, and yet {{the man who was}} responsible for The Hague Conference knew it. We in the States are right outside all these little jealousies and wrangles that bring Europe, every now and then, right up to the gates of war, but I'm hanged if there is one of you dare pass through those gates without a hand on our money markets. It's a new word in history, that little document, news of which Mr. Gerald here took to The Hague, the word of the money kings of the world. There is something that almost nips your breath in the idea that a dozen men, descended from the Lord knows whom, stopped a war which would have altered the whole face of history." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "What {{is there}} for us if we keep on and go away?" [...] she went on. [...] "All the <b>big</b> <b>interests</b> in our lives will vanish--everything. We shall become {{specialised}} people--people overshadowed by a situation. We shall be an elopement, a romance--all our breadth and meaning gone! People will always think of it first when they think of us; all our work and aims will be warped by it and subordinated to it. Is it good enough, dear? Just to specialise.... I think of you. We've got a case, a passionate case, the best of cases, but {{do we want to}} spend all our lives defending it and justifying it? And there's that other life. I know now you care for Margaret--you care more than you think you do. You have said fine things of her. I've watched you about her. Little things have dropped from you. She's given her life for you; she's nothing without you. You feel that to your marrow all the time you are thinking about these things. Oh, I'm not jealous, dear. I love you for loving her. I love you in relation to her. But there it is, an added weight against us, another thing worth saving." ...|$|E
6000|$|Yet it {{is curious}} {{that it never}} {{occurred}} to me for a year or so that this was likely to be a matter of passion between us. I have told how definitely I put my imagination into harness in those matters at my marriage, and I was living now in a world of <b>big</b> <b>interests,</b> where there is neither much time nor inclination for deliberate love-making. I suppose there is a large class of men who never meet a girl or a woman without thinking of sex, who meet a friend's daughter and decide: [...] "Mustn't get friendly with her--wouldn't DO," [...] and set invisible bars between themselves and all the wives in the world. Perhaps that is the way to live. Perhaps there is no other method than this effectual annihilation of half--and the most sympathetic and attractive half--of the human beings in the world, so far as any frank intercourse is concerned. I am quite convinced anyhow that such a qualified intimacy as ours, such a drifting into the sense of possession, such untrammeled conversation with an invisible, implacable limit set just where the intimacy glows, it is no kind of tolerable compromise. If men and women are to go so far together, they must be free to go as far as they may want to go, without the vindictive destruction that has come upon us. On the basis of the accepted codes the jealous people are right, and the liberal-minded ones are playing with fire. If people are not to love, then they must be kept apart. If they are not to be kept apart, then we must prepare for an unprecedented toleration of lovers.|$|E

50|$|Deregulation {{is deemed}} to have {{increased}} the choice menu of viewers, but also to have promoted ownership concentration of press, TV and radio outlets {{in the hands of}} few large organisations. At the same time, law in Grek has been ineffective, e.g. in license regulation, leaving the market be dominated by few <b>big</b> <b>interests,</b> which regulatory authorities have proved only superficial and ambivalent in the work.|$|E
5000|$|Authorities accused Mollohuanca {{of using}} public funds {{to support the}} protests as well as inciting violence, and a judge ordered him to serve five months of [...] "preventative" [...] {{detention}} while the accusations against him were investigated. Mollohuanca described his detention as [...] "surely handed down because of pressure from above, because {{what we have here}} at play are <b>big</b> <b>interests</b> from, for example, mining companies".|$|E

Progressive Dane believes that the social, economic, and political progress of the United States requires a democratic revolution. The party is democratically run by its members. The general membership makes decisions based on common values and principles. PD's funding is membership-based, so it is independent of corporations and powerful <b>big</b> <b>interests.</b>|$|E
5000|$|His {{career as}} a painter was self-educated. Different {{painters}} of the region exchanged their experiences in painting. Pümpin discovered his passion for impressionism. Already during his youth he went painting outdoor in nature with his cousin Fritz Pümpin. While Fritz learned the occupation of an art-painter, Karl kept it as a hobby. He exposed his paintings in the barn of the farm where his works got <b>big</b> <b>interests.</b> He as well showed them at the [...] "Province Basel Promotion Of Art" [...] ("Basellandschaftliche Kunstförderung") and sold some pieces. This is why he got known as “The Painting Farmer”.|$|E
50|$|Johnsson {{was born}} in Gothenburg, Sweden to Rolph Johnsson and Carina G. but later moved to Sunne, a village in the {{province}} of Värmland. The parents - both architects - contributed to her <b>big</b> <b>interests</b> in design, she has studied economics and multimedia, and had the dream of being a graphic designer, but in the end music became her main focus. As a teenager she moved to Karlstad and later, as an exchange student in Minneapolis, USA. She took up skiing as a hobby and was a semi-professional snowboarder for a while. Back in Sweden she combined studies with jobs in a record shop and as nightclub croupier.|$|E

5000|$|We see in {{this act}} that Sir Philip is a French admiring fop. He has very <b>big</b> <b>interests</b> in Fashion and is made to believe the Colonel is a higher figure than who he really is to appeal Sir Philip's senses. The Colonel plays every card he knows to mirror Sir Philip's {{personality}} {{to make it seem}} to [...] "…appear to have but one soul, for our ideas and conceptions are the same."(Act 2, Scene 1, 83-85).In the next scene, we see how Lovely disapproves of the Quaker styles to be forced upon her by covering up any and all tempting features on her body. Mr. and Mrs. Prim's characteristics are revealed even more when the point about romance between Quakers is accepted even with temptation being involved, but if they are not Quakers it is evil and is looked down upon.It is reconfirmed that the disapproval of the other guardians is unanimous, as each fail to see the Colonel as one of their own kind.|$|E
30|$|Run {{by a few}} <b>big</b> <b>interests</b> {{refers to}} the question: “Generally speaking, {{would you say that}} this country is run by a few <b>big</b> <b>interests</b> looking out for themselves, or that it is run for the benefit of all the people? 1. Run by a few <b>big</b> <b>interests,</b> 2. Run for all the people”. Group 1 is that {{answering}} option 1, while Group 2 is that answering option 2.|$|E
30|$|As another illustration, Table  2 {{considers}} the question “Generally speaking, {{would you say}} that this country is run by a few <b>big</b> <b>interests</b> looking out for themselves, or that it is run for the benefit of all the people?” with answers “ 1. Run by a few <b>big</b> <b>interests,</b> and 2. Run for all the people”. Again, we find that the two groups in Argentina (Peronists and non-Peronists) tend to give the answer that is presumably on the left of the political spectrum (Run by a few <b>big</b> <b>interests),</b> but the relative position of Peronists in Argentina is more like the relative position of Republicans than of democrats.|$|E
