Factors which interrupt succession include: human intervention (plagioclimax), change in relief of land (topoclimax), change in animal species (<b>biotic</b> <b>climax)</b> or change in soil such as an increase in acidity (edaphic climax) [...] In most cases, should the area be left to regenerate as normal when the limiting factor is removed, the area eventually becomes a climax community again (secondary succession).|$|E

The {{objectives}} of the research is to study population and its key habitat component.    The observation had been done in March-April 201 5. Population of javan langur was estimated using Concentration Count Method. The result showed that there were 93 individuals (6 groups) with average size 15, 5 ± 5, 381. The existence of javan langur in Balanan Resort was supported by biotic factor, including the vegetation for their feeds and cover, such as Walikukun (Schoutenia ovata) dan Pilang (Acacia leucophloea), abiotic factor including altitude, slope, distance from river and distance from disturbance (road and villages).   With regard with the habitat component, there are 4 factors of the characteristic habitat that influence, namely  biotic factors of regeneration vegetations, abiotic factors, physics factors of vegetations,  and <b>biotic</b> factors of <b>climax</b> vegetations.   Keyword: abiotic, biotic, habitat, Javan Langur, population </p...|$|R
