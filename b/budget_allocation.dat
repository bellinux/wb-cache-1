40|$|We {{present a}} unified {{framework}} for designing and analyzing algorithms for online <b>budgeted</b> <b>allocation</b> problems (including online matching) and their generalization, the Online Generalized Assignment Problem (OnGAP). These {{problems have been}} intensively studied as models of how to allocate impressions for online advertising. In contrast to previous analyses of online <b>budgeted</b> <b>allocation</b> algorithms (the so-called "balance" or "water-filling" family of algorithms) our analysis {{is based on the}} method of randomized dual fitting, analogous to the recent analysis of the RANKING algorithm for online matching due to Devanur et al. Our main contribution is thus to provide a unified method of proof that simultaneously derives the optimal competitive ratio bounds for online matching and online fractional <b>budgeted</b> <b>allocation.</b> The same method of proof also supplies $(1 - 1 /e) $ competitive ratio bounds for greedy algorithms for both problems, in the random order arrival model; this simplifies existing analyses of greedy online allocation algorithms with random order of arrivals, while also strengthening them to apply to a larger family of greedy algorithms. Finally, for the more general OnGAP problem, we show that no algorithm can be constant-competitive; instead we present an algorithm whose competitive ratio depends logarithmically on a certain parameter of the problem instance, and we show that this dependence cannot be improved.

25|$|Officially the {{government}} of Pakistan is committed to provide every citizen an access to education, but critics say that its <b>budget</b> <b>allocation</b> towards education does not correspond with its former commitment. The expenditure on education {{as a percentage of}} GDP was 1.82% in 2000–2001, while it has been raised slightly in 2006–2007 to 2.42%, and it is still relatively lower than most neighboring countries. Feminist economists argue that {{the government}} of Pakistan needs to fully address and resolve the gender concerns that exist in the educational sector. They suggest that one of the ways to improve this situation is by increasing funding for women's education, encourage and financially incentivize people in the rural areas to send their girls to schools. In the apprentice of gender studies, the gender division of labor is considered patriarchal, and feminists argue that it can be consciously neutralized by the public policies, i.e. encouraging girls to study mathematics, science, computers, and business administration etc. This way, girls will specialize in higher paying fields (jobs) instead of solely focusing on care work.|$|E

This vote had 90.6% of the members supporting the move. However, the IMF remains dominated by Europe, the United States and Japan. China has less power in the IMF, although its economy is larger than Belgium and Netherlands combined. The IMF and World Bank have been criticised by Brazil, Argentina, Asian and African nations for prescribing severe belt-tightening measures during their economic crisis. The American government sees the reform of the IMF to redress global economic imbalances, which were cited as one of the biggest menaces to world growth. The IMF is stepping up in its financial surveillance through multilateral consultations to make it more effective and relevant. The World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz said that the poor should not be abandoned because their governments are weak, otherwise the people would be penalised twice. The IMF and World Bank see the need to combat corruption in developing countries. The World Bank will work with developing countries by working with countries or offered through projects on the countries itself. Wolfowitz said that the issue of governance is being addressed, and the most important thing is to take the principles in the paper, applying it in terms of <b>budget</b> <b>allocation.</b> Matters may be complicated due to lack of political will. He added that working with developing countries is a starting point and must work with banks, global organisations and other governments to stop corruption in their nations.
