40|$|In {{order for}} the meat {{industry}} to move towards a carcase payment system that is more consumer-focused, {{there is a need}} to identify carcases that have a higher yield of superior eating quality meat. Through a series of experiments, this thesis investigates the relationships between video image analysis (VIA) variables and saleable meat yield (SMY%) of high-value cuts in <b>beef</b> <b>carcases,</b> and also the relationships between visible-near infrared (NIR) spectra and instrumental meat quality parameters in beef, lamb and venison of various breeds and genders. Results showed that VIA could effectively replace the visual classifier for classifying <b>beef</b> <b>carcases</b> according to the EUROP carcase classification system, and that both visual and VIA systems showed some promise for predicting the yield of high-value sirloin yield through the EUROP-grid information. Both VIA and visual systems could only account for approximately 57 % of the variation in sirloin SMY%, but the relationship between SMY% and other possible VIA outputs such as lengths, widths and volumes remains largely uncharacterized. Instrumental measures of meat quality (shear force, pH and colour) of M. longissimus thoracis et lumborum (LTL) from 234 <b>beef</b> <b>carcases</b> and 208 Texel lambs showed that gender had a larger effect on meat quality than breed. Data from these two experiments was used to determine the relationship between NIR spectra and instrumental meat quality parameters in beef and lamb LTL. NIR showed promise for identifying beef with high ultimate pH values and lamb with high intramuscular fat percentages, but the prediction of shear force using NIR spectra in both beef and lamb was less accurate. The effects on meat quality of sex, breed, chilled aging and location within venison M. Longissimus lumborum, for samples from 79 farmed deer showed that all factors influenced venison meat quality, with aging time and gender having the largest effects. The relationships between NIR spectra and venison meat quality indicated that NIR spectra could be used to identify samples with high ultimate pH and high shear force values...|$|E

40|$|A {{survey of}} <b>beef</b> <b>carcases</b> in abattoirs in the UK {{was carried out}} in order to {{estimate}} the prevalence of contamination with verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) serogroup O 157. Contamination with verocytotoxin-producing E. coli (VTEC) O 157 was confirmed in 0. 47 % of the 4067 (95 % confidence limits 0. 22 - 1. 00 %) of neck muscle samples. A significant tendency for carcases present in the same abattoir on the same day to have similar results was found, thus suggesting cross contamination. VTEC O 157 was found in 0. 83 % of 6495 bovine faeces samples routinely submitted for diagnostic purposes to Veterinary Investigation Centres in England and Wales. Of the samples from cattle less than 6 months old, 3. 7 % of 68 samples from animals without gastrointestinal disease were positive for E. coli O 157, in contrast to 0. 75 % of 2321 samples from cases of gastrointestinal disease. No association with season or herd type (beef or dairy) was found...|$|E
40|$|Dark {{cutting in}} <b>beef</b> <b>carcases</b> can {{represent}} a significant financial loss to processors and producers involved in direct marketing. In our study we valued dark–cutting downgrades {{to a loss}} of $ 100 to $ 150 per carcase since all such bodies had to be diverted away from their primary export market, and additional cattle had to be killed in their place. A supplier survey conducted in November 2000 documented the on-farm histories of 937 market-specific yearling cattle killed at the one meat plant over an 18 months period. This enabled the examination of on-farm records pertaining to the handling, treatments, grazing history and preparation for sale of turnoff lots that were then correlated to the number and percentage of dark cutters. By association we pinpointed a number of social and behavioural background factors that applied to the circumstances, such as handling issues, long pick-ups, purchased stock, mixed mobs and limited weaner training. Although not commonly observed, improving pasture conditions were a possible nutritional influence associated with less dark-cutting. In conclusion, we suggest that animal behavioural influences reported in this paper are worth managing in the lead up to processing. However the number of dark cutters was not considered to be high by industry standards for pasture fed cattl...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 523 chilled beef and lamb {{carcases}} were sampled from four abattoirs and 13 very small plants (VSPs) in South Australia during March 2002 {{in order to}} develop a microbiological profile of meat produced for domestic consumption within the State. Aerobic viable counts (AVCs) and Escherichia coli counts were obtained from samples taken by sponge-sampling the muscle-adipose tissue at sites designated for each species in the Microbiological Guidelines to the Australian Standard for Hygienic Production of Meat for Human Consumption (identical with those of the USA Pathogen Reduction: hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP) systems: final rule). On <b>beef</b> <b>carcases</b> (n = 159) mean log AVC/cm 2 was 1. 82 and E. coli was detected on 18. 8 % of carcases (area sampled 200 cm 2) for which the mean log of the positives was 0. 34; for lamb carcases, on which 75 cm 2 was sampled (n = 364), corresponding values were 2. 59, 36. 2 % and log 10 0. 27, respectively. There was little difference in mean log AVC/cm 2 of carcases produced at abattoirs and VSPs, 1. 72 versus 1. 81, respectively, for beef, and 2. 80 versus 2. 44, respectively, for sheep. Prevalence of E. coli was lower at VSPs, however, with abattoirs having 28. 4 % for beef and 61. 5 % for sheep, compared with corresponding values of 4. 7 % and 18. 5 % at VSPs. In VSPs, the range of mean log AVC/cm 2 was 0. 47 – 3. 16 for beef and 1. 63 – 3. 65 for sheep carcases, data which will allow the Controlling Authority to assist plants to improve performance of slaughter and dressing techniques.

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{a method}} for assessing trait economic impacts, {{at the level of}} the individual animals considered in selection, for traits where the economic value changes across the range of the trait. Results are compared with those from linear methods for price patterns that are common for traits, such as <b>beef</b> <b>carcase</b> fat depth, weight and marbling score, which affect market acceptability and preference. Some important deviations from linearity were seen in the change in index that occurs with change in estimated breeding value (EBV) for these traits. The deviations were most evident at the extremes of the EBV range, which could affect the animals selected. Simple extensions of the method are also suited for use in mate selection and other important areas where non-linearity is encountered...|$|R
40|$|Ninety-five steers {{were used}} to develop a method of {{estimating}} the weights or percentages of the four carcass tissues-muscle, bone, fat and connective tissue-while the carcasses {{were still on the}} slaughter floor. From an investigation of a number of non-carcass parts it was found that three measurements could be used to estimate all four carcass components. The measurements were (a) short-cut tongue weight; (b) foreshanks weight; (c) hot side weight. Simple and multiple regression equations were developed to estimate the weights of muscle, bone and connective tissue in the chilled side, and the accuracy of the estimates was compared with that of recorded prediction methods. The most useful equations employed short-cut tongue weight and hot side weight to estimate total side muscle weight, and foreshanks weight to estimate both total side bone weight and total side connective tissue weight. Fat weight was estimated from hot side weight and the estimates of the weights of the other three carcass components. This technique was more accurate than the Australian <b>Beef</b> <b>Carcase</b> Appraisal System and Butterfield’s equation, both of which use fat thickness measurement at the 10 th rib. When fat thickness measurement was included in regression equations, the estimates of muscle weight and fat weight were slightly improved. Advantages of using the ŉon-carcass parts’ technique are as follows. All four major carcass components are predicted; the carcass components can be recorded as absolute weights or percentages of chilled side weight; chilled side components are predicted whilst the hot side is still on the slaughter floor no commercial loss occurs in carcass, offals or by-products; all measurements used in prediction are weights; and fat thickness measurements may be included in the prediction. The additional information enables producers to make a more critical assessment of the nutritive performance and genetic progress of their herds...|$|R
40|$|The Meat Standards Australia (MSA) beef grading scheme {{can predict}} the eating quality grade of 40 muscles by 5 cooking methods. The quality grades, namely, {{unsatisfactory}} (2 *), good every day (3 *), better than eve 1 y day (4 *) and premium (5 *), represent the predicted rating of untrained consumers. This voluntary scheme {{has been operating}} for I 0 years in Australia and in 2009 the number of carcases graded reached 1 million with price premiums for farmers, wholesalers and retailers. Despite this success most product in Australia is sold as MSA beef {{with only a few}} supply chains marketing higher quality grades. The true potential of the MSA system will be discussed in a scenario where by yearling <b>beef</b> <b>carcases</b> (18 mo, Bos taurus), which is optimally processed (tenderstretch hanging), are then deboned such that all muscles are allocated to an optimal quality grade by cooking method. Accordingly traditional cut nomenclature would no longer be used and instead beef would be sold as 4 * steaks, 4 * roasts, 3 * stir fry etc. For example 4 * grilling steak would be selected from 4 - 5 different muscles which conventionally retail at widely different prices (e. g. oyster blade at $AUS 10 /kg and striploin at $AUS 25 /kg). Based on both willingness to pay data gathered from 5 different countries (n= 9, 840 consumers) and actual prices received in an Australian retail business, the value of the new system can be estimated. Thus if 3 * beef has a retail value of 100 % then 4 * and 5 * star beef can be sold at 150 % and 200 % of the 3 * price respectively. The final scenario is to then overlay muscle yield with eating quality grade as a system that would deliver transparent value based payment back to beef farmers. The differences {{in the value of the}} carcases, corrected to constant weight, can range up to $AUS 700 /carcase at retail, which is variably apportioned to differences in eating quality and yield...|$|E
40|$|The {{accuracy}} {{of a single}} fat thickness measurement at each of five carcass sites and at the 10 th and 12 th ribs in estimating side fat weight and side fat percentage was determined in 36 steer carcasses. Three sites {{were associated with the}} fat layers of the split brisket, one was located at the caudodorsal angle of M. biceps femoris and one was situated 3. 0 cm lateral to the highest point of the sacral crest. All three brisket sites were poor predictors of side fat weight and side fat percentage. The other four sites were of approximately equal accuracy in predicting side fat percentage, with residual standard deviations of: M. biceps femoris, 2. 81 %; sacral crest, 3. 07 %; 10 th rib, 3. 12 %; and 12 th rib, 2. 81 %. Side fat weight was predicted less accurately by M. biceps femoris (5. 42 kg) than by sacral crest (4. 50 kg), 10 th rib (4. 98 kg) or 12 th rib (4. 94 kg). Chilled side weight was a valuable addition in multiple regression analyses, significantly improving the residual standard deviations of all four sites, especially M, biceps femoris, in predicting side fat weight (M. biceps femoris, 1. 56 kg; sacral crest, 3. 54 kg; 10 th rib, 3. 31 kg; 12 th rib, 2. 84 kg). Only in the case of M. biceps femoris did the addition of chilled side weight improve the {{accuracy of}} prediction of side fat percentage (residual standard devation = 1. 75 %). The reliability of the seven sites in accurately measuring fat thickness was determined in 3215 dressed carcasses in six abattoirs. Sacral crest was clearly the most useful site. In addition to being an accurate predictor of carcass fat, it could be measured accurately in 98. 3 % of carcasses (or 94. 3 % of sides), compared with 10 th rib (83. 9 % and 71. 6 % respectively) and 12 th rib (82. 9 % and 68. 5 % respectively). If the measurement of fat thickness at the 12 th rib is used in the Australian <b>Beef</b> <b>Carcase</b> Classification Scheme, up to 21 % of carcasses (or up to 44 % of sides) in some abattoirs will require alternative procedures to describe their fat status. Sacral crest fat thickness accurately estimated side fat weight and side fat percentage, and it provided reliable measurement in all but 1. 7 % of carcasses; it is conveniently located if an alternative site to the 12 th rib is required...|$|R
