40|$|Wood pellet storage {{safety is}} an {{important}} aspect for implementing woody biomass as a renewable energy source. When wood pellets are stored indoors in large quantities (tons) in poorly ventilated spaces in buildings, such as in basements, off-gassing of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can significantly affect indoor air quality. To determine the emission rates and potential impact of VOC emissions, a series of laboratory and field measurements were conducted using softwood, hardwood, and blended wood pellets manufactured in New York. Evacuated canisters were used to collect air samples from the headspace of drums containing pellets and then in basements and pellet storage areas of homes and small businesses. Multiple peaks were identified during GC/MS and GC/FID analysis, and four primary VOCs were characterized and quantified: methanol, pentane, pentanal, and hexanal. Laboratory results show that total VOCs (TVOCs) concentrations for softwood (SW) were statistically (p < 0. 02) higher than blended or hardwood (HW) (SW: 412 21 25; blended: 203 21 4; HW: 99 21 8, ppb). The emission rate from HW was the fastest, followed by blended and SW, respectively. Emissions rates were found to range from 10 (- 1) to 10 (- 5) units, depending upon environmental factors. Field measurements resulted in airborne concentrations ranging from 67 21 8 to 5000 21 3000 ppb of TVOCs and 12 to 1500 ppb of aldehydes, with higher concentrations found in a basement with a large fabric <b>bag</b> <b>storage</b> unit after fresh pellet delivery and lower concentrations for aged pellets. These results suggest that large fabric <b>bag</b> <b>storage</b> units resulted in a substantial release of VOCs into the building air. Occupants of the buildings tested discussed concerns about odor and sensory irritation when new pellets were delivered. The sensory response was likely due to the aldehydes.

The experiment was conducted with eight treatments and four replications. The data were analyzed by adopting Completely Randomized Design. The study revealed that the fruits in refrigeration storage with ventilated polythene bags showed good shelf life compared to fruits stored in ambient condition with ventilated polythene bags. The maximum shelf life, delayed rotting and optimum fruit quality of wax apple were observed in 1. 00 and 0. 50 % ventilation at refrigeration storage followed by 1. 00 % ventilation at ambient storage. The fruits stored without polythene bags both at ambient and refrigeration had lowest shelf life and shrunk compared to ventilated polythene <b>bag</b> <b>storage.</b> The fruits stored with no ventilation in polythene bags both at ambient and refrigeration rotted early and was unacceptable due to poor fruit quality and strong aldehydic flavour when compared to ventilated storage bag.

Cell-free miRNAs measured in blood plasma {{have emerged as}} specific and sensitive markers of physiological processes and disease. In this study, we investigated whether circulating miRNAs can serve as biomarkers {{for the detection of}} autologous blood transfusion, a major doping technique that is still undetectable. Plasma miRNA levels were analyzed using high-throughput quantitative real-time PCR. Plasma samples were obtained before and at several time points after autologous blood transfusion (blood <b>bag</b> <b>storage</b> time 42 days) in 10 healthy subjects and 10 controls without transfusion. Other serum markers of erythropoiesis were determined in the same samples. Our results revealed a distinct change in the pattern of circulating miRNAs.

RFID technology is a feasible solution for this kind of issues. It provides both tracking and identification methods to ensure the quality of the blood products during the storage and transportation as well as the patient safety in the transfusion. In this research, we adopted the design science and experiment testing methodologies to create four different experiments in order to evaluate the performance of RFID technology in the blood <b>bag</b> <b>storage</b> phase. Some fundamental properties of the proposed RFID system has been tested in a simulated hospital blood bank situation, including the maximum detection range of tags and the maximum readable number of tags. Moreover, the best location for attaching the tag has been defined as well as the impact of the liquid on RFID has been measured. In addition, two different storage methods have been applied to the experiment so as to figure out a better one for the blood bag identification. The positive results of the experiment results indicate that RIFD technology can monitor the blood location during the fridge storage in the blood bank. Besides, some of the factors which may affect the performance of RFID system have been mentioned in this study.

Rambutan was harvested from Amphur Ban Na San, Surat Thani Province, {{at the stage}} when its skin was turning into a combination of red, green and yellow. After harvesting, the fruits were size-graded to 27 - 30 fruits/kg, hydrocooled to 14 oC, packed with ice in Styrofoam boxes and transported to the laboratory at Prince of Songkla University within 6 h. The respiration rate of fresh rambutan fruits was monitored. For minimal processing, the fruits were soaked in warm solution (55 oC) of 100 ppm sodium hypochlorite for one min and immediately cooled in cold water until their internal temperature reached 14 oC. The minimal process included peeling, with and without coring. The peeled and peeled and cored rambutan samples were immersed in a solution of 0. 5 % citric acid + 0. 5 % CaCl 2 at 4 oC for 2 min. The average respiration rates (within 6 h) at 4 oC of whole fruit, peeled, and peeled and cored rambutan samples were measured and found to be 122, 134 and 143 mg CO 2 /kg/h, respectively.

40|$|The {{closed system}} of enteral feeding {{involves}} the use of a sterile feeding container that is spiked with a feeding set. Formula is infused to the patient without further manipulation of the system. Closed systems were preceded by open systems that are administered via the decanting of canned liquids or reconstituted powders into empty plastic feeding containers. These containers are reopened periodi-cally to add more formula. Closed-system feedings may be another way to improve efficiencies and patient outcomes via nutrition practice. Enteral Feeding Contamination Enteral feeding solutions support the growth {{of a wide variety of}} microorganisms, creating an under-appreciated risk factor for many patients. The microorganisms in contaminated feeding containers are those commonly isolated from the hospital or home environment. Food contamination is defined in Table 1, based on the 1995 Food and Drug Admin-istration guidelines for medical foods. ' Formulas become contaminated with microorgan-isms due to faulty handling during mixing, trans-port to the patient floor, transfer to the feeding <b>bag,</b> <b>storage,</b> or administration. Water used to dilute or reconstitute formula may also contain significant amounts of gram negative organisms such as Esch-erichia coli, Pseiidomonas, and Enterobacter. Most open-system feeding containers are filled with enough formula to hang for 4 to 12 hours and are refilled with formula as needed. Some facilities man-date the rinsing of formula containers before refill-ing. Rinsing has not been found to be effective for eliminating bacteria: allowing for a continuous cul-ture to reside in the feeding reservoir.

40|$|Tedlar™ {{bags are}} a {{promising}} medium for remote breath collection and later analysis using SIFT-MS for disease diagnosis. It {{is important to}} understand the changes in integrity of samples stored in Tedlar™ bags. However, there is little work into this problem completed to date, and thus little known about these issues. Therefore, a study into the integrity of samples stored in Tedlar™ bags and analysed using SIFT-MS was undertaken. The sample integrity of ammonia, acetone, ethanol, isoprene and pentane, all initially at 3 ppm in breath and nitrogen substrates, and stored in Tedlar™ bags was investigated. Experiments tested the effect of storage size (0. 5, 1, 3 L), storage time (6 - 48 hours), storage temperature (23 ℃ - 25 ℃, 37 ℃), humidity (0. 4 - 4. 5 % absolute) and inter-bag variation using triplicate bags. The SIFT-MS instrument used was LDI 2 located at Christchurch Hospital. The repeatability and precision of LDI 2 was established using prepared cylinder samples (0. 05 % absolute humidity) of acetone, pentane and ethanol tested at seven times over a 250 min time period. A generalised Cauchy distribution was used to give a combined distribution from multiple bags for the sample humidity and compound concentration. A combined measure of the repeatability and precision, T s, ranged between 217 - 349 ppb for ethanol, acetone and pentane. The factors affecting the repeatability and precision were both machine and compound dependant. The effect of the factors differed over time, with different precursors and compounds. No obvious effects of <b>bag</b> <b>storage</b> size on the sample integrity of pentane, isoprene, ethanol and acetone were observed. The absolute humidity change within bag samples was linked to the volume to surface area ratio because it was more affected by permeation and condensation. All compounds in the nitrogen substrate (except for 37 ℃ stored acetone (NO+)) displayed decreases in sample integrity with time. All compounds in the breath substrate displayed regular losses of sample integrity, except for the 37 ℃ and 23 ℃ - 25 ℃ stored ethanol (NO+) and 37 ℃ stored ethanol (H 3 O+), pentane (O 2 +) and ammonia (H 3 O+, O 2 +). The average change of sample integrity for pentane, isoprene, ethanol and acetone ranged from 0. 2 to 3. 6 times the maximum T s, while ammonia ranged from 0. 9 - 10 times. All observed behaviour was reproducible. Absolute humidity and storage temperature affected the sample integrity of acetone, ethanol and ammonia. Generally, the intra-bag variance was comparable between all storage temperatures and substrates while the inter-bag variation was affected by the absolute humidity. Only the initial and final concentrations between precursors for the 23 ℃ - 25 ℃ stored breath and nitrogen substrates agreed. The breath substrate samples gave erroneous values for ammonia. Permeation of compounds into the bags from the atmosphere was not significant. The overall issues surrounding storing breath in Tedlar™ bags for analysis using SIFTMS is not the loss of sample integrity, but the kinetics, precision and repeatability of the SIFT-MS instrument. The current kinetics are not adequate to accurately monitor acetone, isoprene, pentane, ammonia and ethanol in breath and stored in Tedlar™ bags at breath absolute humidity levels greater than 3 %. Generally, the loss of sample integrity was only marginally outside the repeatability and precision of the machine...|$|E
