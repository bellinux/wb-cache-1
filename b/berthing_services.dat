40|$|Simulation of the {{logistics}} {{activities related to}} the arrival, <b>berthing,</b> <b>service</b> and departure processes of ships in container ports {{can be carried out}} for different goals such as design of ship-berth link, increase productivity and efficiency of quay cranes, analysis and planning of operations at the ship-berth link, etc. These logistics activities are particularly complex and very costly since they require the combined use of expensive infrastructure capacities especially berths and quay cranes. Ship-berth link as a main port link is required to serve ships as quickly as possible. Thus, in order to successfully design and develop ship-berth link in a container port and utilise it as efficiently as possible, it is necessary to develop a simulation model that will support decision-making processes of terminal managers. The results, analysis and conclusions given in this paper are intended to provide guidance on achieving time efficiency and accuracy in the modelling of ship-berth link and calibration of ship-berth link simulation models for Pusan East Container Terminal (PECT).

40|$|Fishing vessels {{arriving}} at a port have a considerable waiting cost. They consider the <b>berth</b> <b>service</b> time {{to be the main}} determinant {{of the quality of the}} service provided. This quality, measured by the delay, is determined by the capacity of the port and by the demand. In this context, operations research methods and especially queuing theory are usually applied. Here, we adopt a strategic approach for the demand as well as the supply side of the model. We assume the demand comes from a small number of big fishing vessels with strategic behaviour. More precisely, each vessel chooses ex ante a strategy based on its expected utility, taking into account the strategies of the other users. On the supply side, the producers cannot directly control the quality of the port services but can control them indirectly, through two strategic variables, the capacity and the service price. We compare two models of organization:- a monopoly model in which one actor chooses a capacity in the first place and a price in the second place,- a decentralized model in which a capacity producer supplies a service producer who fixes the sale price. It appears that the nature of the strategic demand has an important influence on the producer's strategies. On the other hand total profits do not depend on the organization of the production. Hence, the efficiency of the port facility seems to depend more on the nature of the demand than on organisational structure of the port...|$|R

It is speculated that Lothal engineers studied tidal movements, and their effects on brick-built structures, since the walls are of kiln-burnt bricks. This knowledge also enabled them to select Lothal's location in the first place, as the Gulf of Khambhat has the highest tidal amplitude and ships can be sluiced through flow tides in the river estuary. The engineers built a trapezoidal structure, with north-south arms of average 21.8 metres (71.5 ft), and east-west arms of 37 metres (121 ft).|$|R
