5|$|The {{skirmish}} {{itself had}} no notable effect on relations <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> and the occupying Americans, which were already deteriorating as the siege dragged on.

5|$|This {{movement}} is {{prompted by the}} feeling that pervades {{the citizens of this}} State that in the present emergency the arms and munitions of war in the Arsenal should be {{under the control of the}} State authorities, in order to their security.

I therefore demand in the name of the State the delivery of the possession of the Arsenal and munitions of war under your charge to the State authorities, to be held subject to the action of the convention to be held on the 4th of March next.|$|E

5|$|The Independent State of Croatia (NDH) {{was founded}} on 10 April 1941, during the {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia by the Axis powers. The NDH consisted of most of modern-day Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, together with some parts of modern-day Serbia. It was essentially an Italo-German quasi-protectorate, as it owed its existence to the Axis powers, who maintained occupation forces within the puppet state throughout its existence. In {{the immediate aftermath of}} the Yugoslav surrender on 17 April, former Royal Yugoslav Army troops returned to their homes in eastern Herzegovina with their weapons. This was a significant security concern for the fledgling NDH government due to the proximity of the border with Montenegro, the close relationship <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> of eastern Herzegovina and Montenegro, and widespread banditry in the region. On the day after the surrender, the commander of the NDH armed forces, Vojskovođa (Marshal) Slavko Kvaternik issued a proclamation demanding the surrender of all weapons to NDH authorities by 24 April.|$|E
