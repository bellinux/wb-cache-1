Fentanyl, d-propoxyphene, profadol, <b>bromadoline,</b> bu-prenorphine and nalbuphine produced only a decrease in unne output, which was antagonised by pretreatment with $-FNA, 40 mg/kg s. c., 24 hr beforehand. These drugs were thus character-ized as selective mu receptor agonists. U- 50, 488, tifluadom, Mr 2034, proxorphan, ethylketocydazocine and butOrphanOl aN produced an initial decrease in unne output, which was antago-nized by f 3 -FNA, and therefore probably mu receptor mediated, followed by a 13 -FNA insensitive diuretic effect, which was prob-aty kappa receptor mediated.
