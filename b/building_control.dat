40|$|Building designs {{regularly}} fail {{to achieve}} the anticipated levels of in-use energy consumption. The interaction of occupants with <b>building</b> <b>controls</b> is often cited as a key factor behind this discrepancy. This paper examines whether one factor in inadvertent energy consumption might be the appearance of post-completion errors (when an intended action is not taken because a primary goal has already been accomplished) in occupants’ interactions with <b>building</b> <b>controls.</b> Post-completion errors have been widely studied in human-computer interaction but the concept has not previously been applied to the interaction of occupants with <b>building</b> <b>controls.</b> Two experiments were carried out to {{examine the effect of}} incorporating two different types of simple prompt to reduce post-completion error in the use of light switches in office meeting rooms. Results showed that the prompts were effective and that occupants switched off lights when leaving the room more often when presented with a normative prompt than with a standard injunction. Additionally, an over reliance on PIR sensors to turn off lights after meetings was observed, which reduced their intended energy savings. We conclude that achieving low carbon buildings in practice is not solely a technological issue and that application of user-models from human-computer interaction will encourage appropriate occupant interaction with <b>building</b> <b>controls</b> and help reduce inadvertent energy consumption...|$|R

25|$|There {{are also}} {{concerns}} about enforcement, with a Building Research Establishment study in 2004 indicating that 60% {{of new homes}} {{do not conform to}} existing regulations. A 2006 survey for the Energy Saving Trust revealed that <b>Building</b> <b>Control</b> Officers considered energy efficiency 'a low priority' and that few would take any action over failure to comply with the Building Regulations because the matter 'seemed trivial'.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of energy efficiency innovation, including efficient water heaters; improved refrigerators and freezers; advanced <b>building</b> <b>control</b> technologies and advances in heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC); smart windows that adapt to maintain a comfortable interior environment; new building codes to reduce needless energy use; and compact fluorescent lights.

The use of these controls has a cooling effect on the occupant through increasing the air movement or the ventilation.

25|$|It was a {{political}} decision to deprive local authorities of the resources needed to provide an adequate service. Local authority budgets have been cut by 40% {{as a result of}} the 2010 austerity budget of the Conservative Coalition Government, and the fire service cuts have resulted in 11,000 fewer firefighters. The building inspection regime is under pressure as mandatory competition between Local Authority <b>Building</b> <b>Control</b> and private approved inspectors was introduced to drive down costs. This impacts on quality. Local authority budget cuts have led to fewer <b>building</b> <b>control</b> inspectors and fewer planning inspectors and also the recommendations of a coroner’s report into the Lakanal House tower block fire in Southwark in 2009 has not been acted on nor have building regulations been overhauled. The responsibility for fire safety checks had been switched from the fire brigade onto building owners for similar cost cutting reasons, by the previous Blair government. Southwark council was fined £570,000 for fire safety offences following the 2009 Lakanal House fire, where six people died. Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn brought this to the attention of the House. He said these “terrible consequences of deregulation and cutting corners” stemmed from a “disregard for working-class communities”.|$|E
