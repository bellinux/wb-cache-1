40|$|New <b>biomass</b> <b>fuels</b> are {{constantly}} being developed from renewable resources {{in an effort to}} counter global warming and to create a sustainable society based on recycling. Among these, <b>biomass</b> <b>fuels</b> manufactured from waste are prone to microbial fermentation, and are likely to cause fires and explosions if safety measures, including sufficient risk assessments and long-term storage, are not considered. In this study, we conducted a series of experiments on several types of newly developed <b>biomass</b> <b>fuels,</b> using combinations of various thermal- and gas-analysers, to identify the risks related to heat- and gas-generation. Since a method for the evaluation of the relative risks of <b>biomass</b> <b>fuels</b> is not yet established in Japan, we also such a method based on our experimental results. The present study found that in cases where safety measures are not thoroughly observed, <b>biomass</b> <b>fuels</b> manufactured from waste materials have a higher possibility of combusting spontaneously at the storage site due to microbial fermentation and heat generation. biomass fuels; heat generation; fermentation; thermal and gas analysers; risk evaluation metho...|$|R

The characteristic values of flame radicals (OH*, CN*, CH* and C 2 *), including the intensity ratio, intensity contour, mean intensity, area and eccentricity, are computed to reconstruct two types of RBF NN, that is, accurate and probabilistic RBF networks.

25|$|Finland classifies peat as a slowly {{renewing}} <b>biomass</b> <b>fuel.</b> Peat {{producers in}} Finland often claim that peat {{is a special}} form of biofuel because of the relatively fast retake rate of released CO2 if the bog is not forested for the following 100years. Also, agricultural and forestry-drained peat bogs actively release more CO2 annually than is released in peat energy production in Finland. The average regrowth rate of a single peat bog, however, is indeed slow, from 1,000 up to 5,000years. Furthermore, {{it is a common}} practice to forest used peat bogs instead of giving them a chance to renew. This leads to lower levels of CO2 storage than the original peat bog.|$|E

These vehicles could operate on either gasoline or methanol with only one fuel system. Legislation was passed to encourage the US auto industry to begin production, which started in 1993 for the M85 FFVs at Ford. In 1996, a new FFV Ford Taurus was developed, with models fully capable of running on either methanol or ethanol blended with gasoline. This ethanol version of the Taurus became the first commercial production of an E85 FFV. The momentum of the FFV production programs at the American car companies continued, although {{by the end of the}} 1990s, the emphasis shifted to the FFV E85 version, as it is today. Ethanol was preferred over methanol because there is a large support from the farming community, and thanks to the government's incentive programs and corn-based ethanol subsidies.

40|$|The {{primary goal}} {{of this paper was}} to {{increase}} profitability in Nebraska greenhouses by using <b>biomass</b> <b>fuels</b> for heating instead of propane. Several different fuels were tested, including whole shelled corn, dry distiller’s grains pelletized, wood pellets and blends between each <b>biomass.</b> The main <b>fuel</b> focus was on whole shelled corn. Bomb calorimetry tests were performed on <b>biomass</b> <b>fuels</b> and their respective ashes. Several furnace and heat exchanger efficiency tests were performed, with cost effectiveness analysis for each fuel type. Emissions data was also collected for each fuel on carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxides, sulfuric oxides, and particulate matter. The project used a biomass furnace donated to a greenhouse at Firth, Nebraska and an existing propane furnace. Although the biomass furnace generally had a lower efficiency than the 81 percent advertised for the propane furnace, the <b>biomass</b> <b>fuels</b> were more cost effective than propane. The biomass efficiencies typically ranged between 50 and 80 percent. Over a four year period (2008 - 2011) the cost savings of <b>biomass</b> <b>fuels</b> ranged between 30 and 60 percent and totaled a little over $ 15, 000.

40|$|The ambitious {{targets of}} the European Union in {{increasing}} the use of renewable energies to 20 % of Europe’s energy needs, call for urgent changes, including in the biomass sector. The share of solid biomass for heating purposes could be further increased by replacing oil- and gas-fired furnaces with biomass boilers and by expanding the spectrum of biomass raw materials for small-scale combustion systems. The interest in using non-woody <b>biomass</b> <b>fuels</b> for heat production has been increasing in Europe due to two main factors. First, the market for fossil fuels is unstable and their prices are continuously rising. Second, the increase competition for woody biomass between the heating sector and other industries, have increased the price of wood. As a result, the interest for alternative <b>biomass</b> <b>fuels</b> is growing rapidly, covering woody materials of low quality, energy crops and forest residues. The present work aims at investigating the technical feasibility of using non-woody <b>biomass</b> <b>fuels</b> in existing small-scale combustion appliances developed for burning wood. Therefore, combustion tests with different non-woody <b>biomass</b> <b>fuels</b> and in different combustion appliances were performed in standard laboratory conditions and in households under real life conditions (field tests). The laboratory tests were performed using eight different fuels (straw, Miscanthus, maize, vineyard pruning, hay, wheat bran and Sorghum) while in the field tests straw, Miscanthus and maize were burned. The gaseous and particle emissions, the slag tendency and {{the efficiency of the}} combustion systems operated with non-woody <b>biomass</b> <b>fuels</b> were analysed and when possible compared with the legal requirements defined in FPrEN 303 - 5. The limitations of the investigated combustion appliances when operated with non-woody <b>biomass</b> <b>fuels</b> were analysed and discussed. Non-woody <b>biomass</b> <b>fuels</b> could be used for heat production in existing combustion appliances as long as the systems are adapted for burning high ash content fuels. Among the investigated fuels, Miscanthus, vineyard pruning and hay could be burnt in most of the tested combustion appliances while fulfilling the legal European requirements (defined in FprEN 303 - 5) in terms of emissions and efficiency. The non-woody <b>biomass</b> <b>fuels</b> showed problems with ash accumulation and slag formation and could only be burned without unwanted shutdowns in combustion appliances adapted to manage high ash content fuels. Straw, wheat bran and maize were the most problematic fuels regarding slagging. The combustion appliances require appropriate technological developments to manage the strong variability in terms of chemical and thermal properties of the non-woody <b>biomass</b> <b>fuels.</b> The results of the laboratory tests were generally in agreement with the field test results.

40|$|<b>Biomass</b> <b>fuels</b> {{represent}} a renewable energy source, they are CO 2 neutral fuels, {{and their use}} reduces the consumption of fossil fuels and limits the emissions of SOx, NOx, and heavy metals. They are used in pyrolysis, gasification, combustion, and co-combustion. The devolatilization is a fundamental mechanism in all these processes, especially for high volatile matter fuels. In this work, the devolatilization of <b>biomass</b> <b>fuels</b> (of different origin, properties, and composition) and biomass components is studied coupling thermogravimetric (TG) analysis with infrared spectroscopy. The characteristic temperatures are determined for the main devolatilization steps and compared for all fuels. A bituminous coal and a paper sludge are also studied for comparison. Light gases released (CO, CO 2, H 2 O, CH 4, CH 3 OH, HCOOH) are detected, whereas more complex organic (hydrocarbon and oxygenated) compounds are grouped {{because of the large}} variety of volatile species released in a narrow range of temperature. The weight loss of <b>biomass</b> <b>fuels</b> is related to their chemical composition (i. e., considering the devolatilization behavior of cellulose, hemicellulose (xylan), and lignin in the same operating conditions). The aim of the work is to apply a summative law for the TG results (validated in previous experimental and literature works) to obtain the chemical composition of <b>biomass</b> <b>fuels</b> and to validate and extend a summative law for the FTIR profiles of volatile species released. Calculated values obtained using this method are in good agreement with the experimental results.
