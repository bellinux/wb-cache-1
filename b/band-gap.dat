25|$|A {{laser diode}} is {{electrically}} a PIN diode. The active {{region of the}} laser diode is in the intrinsic (I) region, and the carriers (electrons and holes) are pumped into that region from the N and P regions respectively. While initial diode laser research was conducted on simple P-N diodes, all modern lasers use the double-hetero-structure implementation, where the carriers and the photons are confined {{in order to maximize}} their chances for recombination and light generation. Unlike a regular diode, the goal for a laser diode is to recombine all carriers in the I region, and produce light. Thus, laser diodes are fabricated using direct <b>band-gap</b> semiconductors. The laser diode epitaxial structure is grown using one of the crystal growth techniques, usually starting from an N doped substrate, and growing the I doped active layer, followed by the P doped cladding, and a contact layer. The active layer most often consists of quantum wells, which provide lower threshold current and higher efficiency.|$|E

The effect of the skew angle of the underlying grid structure is also explored, as are mathematical refinements of the modelling of the beam elements and the rotational inertia of the added masses.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the relaxed micromorphic model {{proposed}} in [49, 26] {{has been used}} to study wave propagation in unbounded continua with microstructure. By studying dispersion relations for the considered relaxed medium, we are able to disclose precise frequency ranges (<b>band-gaps)</b> for which propagation of waves cannot occur.
