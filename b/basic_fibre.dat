Kenaf {{is known as the}} most economical crop. The present exist of feminine hygiene product are produced by high cost chemicals. This may cause to increase the price. Lots of women in the developing countries still do not have enough supply of cheap feminine hygiene product and this force them use unhygienic materials such as rags, barks and even mud. So there is a need in invention and manufacturing of low cost sanitary product. This research is to analyse the best method for the production of low cost feminine hygiene from kenaf by using suitable mechanical and chemical method. Application of acidic, alkaline and hypochlorite treatment in the pulping process will increase the quality of fluff pulp without affect its <b>basic</b> <b>fibre</b> properties. The raw material of kenaf is supply by National Kenaf and Tobacco Board, Kuantan Branch. Mechanical separation was done to remove the outer bast fiber of kenaf manually. In this study, Sodium Sulphite, Glacial Acetic acid and sodium hypochlorite was used in the production of pulp as it is low cost and suitable for treating core fibres. All the samples were sent for FESEM and SEM scanning to investigate the morphological condition of the pores of the fibres for the sample. Absorbency test was carried out for each sample. The absorbency of each sample includes untreated and treated samples are higher than 1. 00 g of ink/g of ink/g of sample as shown in table 1. Samples treated with 20 % Glacier Acidic acid show lowest absorbency with 1. 08 g of ink/g of sample. Samples treated with 1 g of sodium sulphite showed quite high absorbency at 1. 836 g of ink/g of sample. The treated sodium sulphite kenaf core pores are porous and there is increasing in the absorbency characteristics. Furthermore, EDS FESEM analysis shown elementary composition contains inside samples without any sulphur remained in sodium sulphite treated sampl...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} the {{exploitation}} of the cladding pumping technique to scale the output power of rare-earth (Er 3 +, Er 3 +/Yb 3 +, Yb 3 +, and Nd 3 +) doped fibre amplifiers and lasers, and {{on the study of}} alternative pumping schemes and applications. In the first three chapters, the introduction of the cladding pumping scheme, its <b>basic</b> <b>fibre</b> geometries and fundamental analyses of double-clad fibres and their devices are presented. Chapter 4 describes an investigation of various Er 3 +-doped and Yb 3 + co-doped fibre devices. An Er 3 +/Yb 3 +-doped SM fibre amplifier pumped in the 820 nm band can not only avoid the excited state absorption (ESA) peaks of Er 3 + at 800 and 840 nm, but also have a higher ratio of ground state absorption to ESA than that of Er 3 + fibres. This enables a high gain amplifier with a much shorter fibre length. An experimental study of cladding pumped Er 3 +/Yb 3 + fibres in amplifier and laser forms shows the simplicity of power scaling and brightness conversion from high-power large-area multimode laser diodes into a single diffraction-limited fibre mode, and thus scales the output powers. Efficient operation of a three-level Er 3 +-doped double-clad fibre in both laser and amplifier forms is described. The fibre design of a low area ratio of the inner cladding to the core reduces the threshold to an acceptable level. The study of bending effects in large area ratio double-clad fibres indicates that a fibre having a concentric geometry can have nearly as high an efficiency as an eccentric core geometry if periodic bending is employed to promote mode scrambling. In contrast, double-clad fibres with eccentric cores and rectangular inner claddings were found to be relatively insensitive to bending. In order to obtain high-peak-power pulsed sources, various kinds of novel pulsed fibre lasers have been investigated. These include a cladding pumped Nd 3 + Q-switched fibre laser, an enhanced Q-switched double-clad fibre laser, a Q-switched Er 3 + fibre laser double-clad fibre with a large mode-area core, and a picosecond mode-locked Yb 3 +fibre laser. Cladding pumped amplification of short pulses can extract high energy stored in doped fibres, thus obtain pulses with high peak power and energy...|$|E

Simulated core samples were removed at six fixed heights easily accessible from the ground (0. 5, 0. 7, [...] . 1. 5 m) and at seven percentage heights (0, 20, 30, [...] . 70 %). Whole-tree values, calculated from percentage height data, were correlated with the core data to determine the optimal sampling height. Core samples were found to be good predictors of whole-tree pulp yield for E. globulus, with simulated cores taken from the recommended sampling height (1. 1 [*]m) explaining more than 50 % of {{variation in}} whole-tree pulp yield. Results for E. nitens were variable with large site differences apparent. On high quality sites, core samples from the recommended sampling height (0. 9 [*]m) were good predictors of whole-tree pulp yield, explaining around 60 % of the variation. On poor quality sites, cores were poor predictors of whole-tree pulp yield. Radial orientation of cores was not important and predicted pulp yield was not related to tree size, <b>basic</b> density or <b>fibre</b> length. To estimate stand mean pulp yield to an accuracy of ± 1 % would require sampling 6 trees of E. globulus and 4 trees for E. nitens using either multiple discs or core samples.

From each provenance and trial 10 trees were sampled from a 1. 25 metre spacing and I 0 trees from a 2. 0 metre spacing whenever possible. Assessments were made at growth rings five and ten respectively from the bark for basic density and at growth ring five from the bark for tracheid length. Provenance variation was significant for basic density and tracheid length in 50 % of the trials. A narrow spacing increased basic density but tracheid length was not changed. Basic density was low in trees with large diameter or wide growth rings and in assessments made close to the pith. Tracheid length was short in short trees and assessments made close to the pith. Contour plots of basic density and tracheid length indicate that low values are obtained for northern latitudes and high altitudes. Tracheid length was also reduced at coastal sites.

On the two drier sites, application of both N and P, alone or in combination, resulted in changes in density, shorter fibres, and slightly lower predicted pulp yield. Addition of both N and P increased the levels of these nutrients in the wood at the three Victorian sites.

40|$|Three {{pairs of}} {{sites in the}} Oberon area of NSW were sampled to {{determine}} the effect of prior land-use (pasture or plantation) on a range of wood properties for Pinus radiata D. Don. Paired sites were matched as closely as possible for climate and soil type. Ten trees at each site were sampled at ages 19 or 20, and outerwood <b>basic</b> density, <b>fibre</b> length, fibre coarseness, and wood pH were determined using breast-height cores. In addition, pith-to-bark profiles for air-dry density and microfibril angle were mapped for each sample. Consistent differences in wood and fibre properties were found between the paired ex-pasture and second-rotation sites. Overall, the ex-pasture sites produced lower-density wood with shorter fibres, lower fibre coarseness, higher pH, and higher microfibril angle leading to a decrease in calculated modulus of elasticity. However, when results were examined across all pairs of sites, large differences were also apparent within forest areas, with some ex-pasture sites producing better-quality wood than some second-rotation sites. Despite differences in growth patterns with prior land-use, the age of change from juvenile to mature-type wood was the same for the two site types. In the growth rings closest to the pith, wood density was similar for the ex-pasture and second-rotation sites. However, from Ring 6 onwards density was consistently higher for the second-rotation sites. There was little effect of site type on patterns of change for microfibril angle. The major effect of site type would appear to come from an increase in the volume of juvenile corewood on the ex-pasture sites...|$|R

Fibre laser has gained importance in the laser material processing market as it presents an advanced technology. It is compact, reliable and more efficient than CO 2 and Nd:YAG lasers. The high quality laser beam generated is currently in the kilowatt power level suitable for cutting operations. Furthermore, this laser system needs low maintenance and it has very long working life. It also presents the flexibility of fibre delivery, up to 200 meters from the laser source. Three major experiments were performed: laser cutting of dry pine wood with multiple passes of the laser beam; the laser cutting of wet and dry pine wood; analysing the effect of single and dual assisting gas jet(s) in the fibre laser cutting process. In each experiment, the main process parameters and their interactions affecting the process were discussed. Furthermore, the application of a desirability equation provided the optimal combination of the parameters involved (within the experimental window tested) to maximise the yield and the quality of the laser cutting operation. The effect of the assistant gas jet(s) was further analysed with a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model, which information clarified its/their action in ejecting fumes and combusted materials in the process.

The selection of high performance wood based on wood properties and their vegetative reproduction represents the best option {{for the establishment of}} plantations with the aim of promoting the restoration of degraded natural resources. However, measurements of these characters are lengthy, time consuming and destructive, and difficult to perform in Togo {{because of the lack of}} equipment. An alternative to those methods is near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. The aim of this study was to assess the efficiency and feasibility of near infrared spectroscopy for predicting the physical and mechanical properties and the colour parameters of P. erinaceus wood from Burkina Faso, Niger and Togo. The properties were determined by conventional method and correlated with near infrared spectra using partial least square regression. The partial least square regression models were tested by cross-validation and by external validation. The results of this study showed the possible use of near infrared spectroscopy to estimate the physical and mechanical properties and the colour parameters of P. erinaceus wood. In fact, when validating prediction models for radial and tangential shrinkage, the fibre saturation point (FSP) showed R 2 values of 0. 70, 0. 71, and 0. 92, respectively, with ratio performance deviation values of 1. 84, 1. 87 and 3. 57. For the colour parameters L*, a* and b*, the R 2 values were 0. 83, 0. 74 and 0. 67, respectively, with ratio performance deviation values of 2. 40, 2 and 1. 70. The results showed that the <b>basic</b> density and <b>fibre</b> saturation point models were classed as good to very good, respectively.

First, a brief overview is given about the photosensitivity in optical <b>fibre,</b> <b>basic</b> FBG fabrication techniques, the popular coupled-mode theory for describing fundamental characteristics of FBGs and the Transfer Matrix method for the numerical simulations of complex-structured FBGs. An advanced FBG fabrication system based on the technique of multiple printing in fibre (with a continuous-wave source) has been used to write complex FBGs incorporating phase shifts, apodization and chirp.       A single double-peaked superimposed grating working in reflection can be employed as a direct optical filter for millimetre-wave signals. Bit error rate measurements confirmed that the filter exhibited nearly on-off behaviour in the passband with a 3 -dB bandwidth of 2 GHz for a central frequency of 20 GHz, as expected from the optical spectrum reflection. The presented technique can be used in radio-over-fibre systems or simultaneous up-conversion of ultra-wide band signals and filtering. This thesis focused mostly on the research of two 4 -cm long Hamming-apodized gratings written in side-hole fibres with internal electrodes. The temperature dependence measurements showed that the birefringence of the component increased with the temperature. Dynamic measurement has shown nanosecond full off-on and on-off switching. During the electrical pulse action, the grating wavelength was blue-shifted for the x-polarization and red-shifted for the y-polarization due to the mechanical stress. Both peaks subsequently experienced a red-shift due to the relaxation of mechanical stress and the increasing core temperature transferred from the metal in many microseconds. All the wavelength shifts of the two polarizations depend quadratically on the electrical pulse voltage and linearly on the pulse duration. Numerical simulations gave accurate description of the experimental results and were useful to understand the physics behind the birefringence switching. Finally, two switchable dual-wavelength erbium-doped fibre lasers based on FBG feedback were proposed. In one method, an overlapping cavity for the two lasing wavelengths and hybrid gain medium in the fibre laser were introduced. Dual-wavelength switching was achieved by controlling the Raman pump power. The other method employed an injection technique and the dual-wavelength switching was controlled by the power of the injection laser. The switching time was measured to be ~ 50 ms. Detailed characteristics of the dual-wavelength switching in the two fibre lasers were experimentally studied and corresponding principles were physically explained. QC 2010092...|$|R
40|$|Salinity, the {{presence}} of soluble salts in soils or waters, can be separated into naturally occurring primary salinity, and secondary salinity resulting from human activities such as land development and agriculture. Secondary salinity involving high, saline water-tables affects large areas, estimated between 4. 7 and 6. 1 'ha (Williamson 1990, Robertson 1996), of agricultural land in Australia, and tree planting is one approach to lower saline watertables. Such plantations could become a significant fibre source for the pulp and paper industry, {{but it is not}} known whether growth in salt-affected environments influences key fibre properties important in paper production. This work therefore examined the wood and fibre properties of Tasmanian blue gum, Eucalyptus globulus ssp. globulus, and river red gum, E. camaldulensis, grown under various conditions of soil salinity. Eucalyptus globulus was studied in trial plantations in the Shepparton region of north-central Victoria. The plantations were established in 1993, and field sampling was carried out from 1995 to 1997. Salinity in the top 20 cm of soil over the period of study (1994 to 1997), according to the soil salinity classes set lutin Marcar et al. (1995), ranged from non-saline at the fresh-channel water-irrigated plot to slightly saline for the saline groundwater-irrigated plots. Tree size generally did not differ significantly between plots at any age. Differences in foliar [Na±], {K±] and [Cl-] occurred between the field plots but were not consistent between years. The highest concentrations of foliar ions were also not always associated with the plot receiving the highest salinity irrigation water, suggesting that in only some years was the soil salt level sufficient to cause a plant response. Wood basic density differed between the plots, but it could not be attributed to salinity, and may have reflected other site-specific effects. Fibre morphology parameters did not differ significantly between the plots. There were some differences between the plots in the increase in fibre length from year to year but the differences were not consistent over the entire survey period and could not conclusively be attributed to differences in soil salinity. A pilot salinity pot trial was conducted on E. camaldulensis plants, as a precursor to a more elaborate experiment planned for potted E. globulus plants. The E. camaldulensis pot trial comprised a single concentration salt (NaCl) treatment and a control (freshwater) treatment applied over a 60 day period. A marked reduction of growth occurred with salt-treated seedlings relative to control seedlings. Concomitant with the reduction in growth, salt-treated seedlings produced significantly shorter, thicker-walled fibres than the control seedlings. The pot-trial on 18 -month-old Eucalyptus globulus ssp. globulus trees applied different concentration salt (lRlaCi) solutions over a 10 -week period. The salinity of the potting mixture increased markedly in the salt-treated trees relative to the controls. Foliar chloride and sodium were also significantly greater in trees on the higher salt treatments than in the control trees. Diameter growth decreased with the higher salt treatments, and five trees under high salt treatments had to be harvested prior to the planned completion of the experiment, due to their poor state of health. These results indicated the salt treatments had influenced some aspects of tree physiology. A wound made to the cambium allowed pre-treatment fibres (fibres formed {{prior to the start of}} the experiment) to be distinguished from post-treatment fibres (fibres formed during the experiment) in the E. globulus pot trial. Trees on higher salt treatments produced significantly longer, thinner-walled fibres compared to controls, but this pattern also occurred in fibres formed before treatments were imposed, implying that these differences were due to preexisting differences in the trees unrelated to the salt treatment. Statistical analysis of fibres formed during treatments, taking account of pre-existing differences, found that there was no significant effect of salt treatment on fibre length or wall thickness, although this was possibly because of the low sample size relative to the variation of the experimental material. The controlled application of salt for 10 weeks during the E. globulus pot trial thus had some effect on tree physiology, but no significant effects on fibre dimensions or wood formation. This was consistent with the observation in the field trial that fibre dimensions and wood formation were not influenced by factors that did not also reduce tree growth, at least in trees up to 4 years old. Higher levels of salt could cause rapid tree decline due to the inability of the trees to exclude the salt, and processes associated with fibre formation would then also cease. The combined results from the field and pot trials indicated that E. globulus, a slightly to moderately salt-tolerant species, suffered negligible or minor growth reductions on soils irrigated to a slightly saline level, and produced fibres of similar morphology to trees grown under non-saline conditions. If soil salinity increased above the moderate level, the trees would continue to grow provided sufficient water is still available, but internal salt levels would increase to the point where tree death would result. Based on the pot trial, where such internal salt levels were achieved, the decline and death of the trees would occur before the salt affects fibre morphology. Eucalyptus camaldulensis adopted a different strategy to cope with salt stress than E. globulus. Eucalyptus globulus continued to grow provided it was supplied with water, despite its saline nature. Finally, when salt levels within the plant reached a critical level, plant health rapidly declined. When E. camaldulensis was watered with solution of a similar salinity to the highest salt treatments in the E. globulus pot trial, there was a rapid cessation in extension growth, but there was no other sign of a deterioration in plant health. The mechanism by which E. camaldulensis was able to quickly cease shoot growth, which presumably allowed it to tolerate saline conditions by restricting salt uptake, was not investigated here. Material from Eucalyptus camaldulensis that had been growing for 14 years on a dryland plantation site in southwest Western Australia was also investigated. Trees from the high salinity area did not differ significantly in average height, diameter and volume from those from the low salinity area. Basic density were significantly greater in the high salinity group of trees than in the low salinity group, but no relationship with tree growth was established. The absence of a relationship between growth and basic density was not unusual, as natural variation in basic density makes it difficult to establish environmental or experimental effects (Downes and Raymond 1997). Fibre fractional wall coverage was greater in the high salinity group of trees than in the low salinity group, as was also the case for the E. camaldulensis pot trial. In the pot trial, however, a significant growth reduction due to salinity was recorded. There were no other differences in fibre morphology between the high and low salinity groups of the Western Australian plantation. Eucalyptus globulus is less salt and waterlogging tolerant than E. camaldulensis (Bennett and George 1995 a; Bennett and George 1995 b) but in the field studies the growth and wood and fibre properties for each species was similar across the range of salinities encountered. The exception was <b>basic</b> density and <b>fibre</b> fractional wall coverage in the 14 -year-old E. camaldulensis, both of which were greater in the high salinity group of trees. It was expected that the growth of E. globulus would be adversely affected if irrigation with the saline groundwater continued for several more years, allowing a build up in soil salinity. Based on the results from the E. globulus pot trial, once soil salinity levels exceed the tolerance limits of this species, a rapid decline in tree health will occur, and fibre formation will cease. Eucalyptus camaldulensis, with its greater salt and waterlogging tolerance, will grow in areas where other commercial species, such s E. globulus, would not thrive. However, E. camaldulensis has disadvantages for farm forestry in Australia, due to low percentage pulp yields by comparison with E. globulus (Arnold et al. 1999), and poor growth rates and tree form (Mazanec 1999). In the USA, E. camaldulensis has equalled the pulp yield of the commercially proven E. globulus (Arnold et al. 1999). Further research into improving pulp yields, growth rates and tree form of E. camaldulensis in Australia, would allow expansion of eucalypt plantations for pulp and wood production, as well as land and water care, onto previously unsuitable land.
