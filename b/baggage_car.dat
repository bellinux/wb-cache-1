5|$|On {{the second}} anniversary of the train's famous dash, the {{original}} Zephyr was rechristened the Pioneer Zephyr to distinguish it as the first of the Burlington's growing Zephyr fleet. In 1938, car 525 was replaced by car number 500, a 40-seat buffet/lounge car, to provide light meals. Car number 505, the baggage-coach combine, was rebuilt at this time into a full <b>baggage</b> <b>car,</b> but it kept its original windows.|$|E
5|$|Marceau splits {{her time}} between seeing to {{the duties of}} the train (such as helping to fix the heat in the engine), {{interviewing}} passengers about the murder, and examining the train and surrounding area for clues. She travels to several additional locations that Poirot does not travel to in the book, such as the engine, the <b>baggage</b> <b>car,</b> and an old shack outside of the snowed in train. Additionally, a sabotaged ham radio is in one of the compartments which, when repaired, allows Antoinette to contact Poirot's nephew and ask him to research the passengers.|$|E

25|$|The current California Zephyr uses Superliner equipment. A typical train {{consists}} of two P42 locomotives, a <b>baggage</b> <b>car,</b> a transition sleeper, two sleeping cars, a dining car, a sightseer lounge car, {{and two or three}} coaches.|$|E
25|$|On the train, Hunt {{remotely}} directs Max to the list. Max verifies it {{and gives}} Hunt the code to a briefcase containing the payment along with Job in the <b>baggage</b> <b>car.</b> Ethan calls Claire and tells her {{to meet him}} there. Meanwhile, Stickell uses a jamming device to prevent Max from uploading the data to her servers. Claire reaches the <b>baggage</b> <b>car,</b> finds Phelps and tells him Ethan will arrive shortly. She questions the idea of killing Ethan, since they will need a fall guy for the money, when Phelps reveals himself to be Ethan in disguise, exposing her as a co-conspirator. When the real Phelps arrives and takes the money at gunpoint, Hunt dons a pair of video glasses that relays Phelps to Kittridge, blowing Phelps' cover as the mole.|$|E
25|$|During winter months, a Ski Train serving Wachusett Mountain {{runs on the}} Fitchburg Line, using a coach car {{which is}} {{equipped}} for carrying bicycles or skis. During summer months, some Newburyport/Rockport Line trains to Rockport include one of two cars equipped to carry bicycles. The CapeFLYER uses car 224, which has been modified as a cafe and <b>baggage</b> <b>car.</b>|$|E
25|$|Express cars carried high-value freight in {{passenger}} consists. These <b>cars</b> resembled <b>baggage</b> <b>cars,</b> {{although in}} some cases specially-equipped box cars or refrigerator cars were used.|$|R
5000|$|The Viewliner is a single-level car type used by Amtrak on most long-distance routes {{operating}} east of Chicago. Amtrak began placing 130 additional cars {{into service}} on March 23, 2015, and took {{possession of the}} final 12 <b>baggage</b> <b>cars</b> on November 17, 2015. The 70 new bag cars are used on all Amtrak trains, single-level and bi-level. They replaced {{almost all of the}} [...] "Heritage" [...] <b>baggage</b> <b>cars</b> that Amtrak inherited from the freight railroads when it was created in 1971. Other single-level cars still to be delivered include diners, baggage-dorms, and sleepers.|$|R

25|$|Another work, Jim Beam - J.B. Turner Engine (1986) {{is based}} on a commemorative, {{collectible}} in bottle {{in the form of a}} locomotive that was created by Jim Beam; however, Koons appropriated this model and had it cast in gleaming stainless-steel. The train model cast in steel titled Jim Beam - <b>Baggage</b> <b>Car</b> (1986) even contains Jim Beam bourbon.|$|E
25|$|Madero's {{father used}} his {{influence}} {{with the state}} governor and posted bond to give Madero the right to move about the city on horseback during the day. On 7 October 1910, Madero galloped away from his guards and took refuge with sympathizers in a nearby village. He was then smuggled across the U.S. border, hidden in a <b>baggage</b> <b>car</b> by sympathetic railway workers.|$|E
25|$|Built as the Portland & Ogdensburg Railroad before {{acquisition}} by the Maine Central Railroad (MEC), {{the line}} initially provided transportation for summer visitors to grand Victorian hotels, including the Bay of Naples Inn in Naples (reached by connection with Sebago Lake steamboats), the Crawford House in Crawford Notch, and the Mount Washington Hotel in Bretton Woods. Cool, clean air at Sebago Lake and the White Mountains provided a refreshing {{escape from the}} heat, humidity and smoke of 19th-century cities. Autumn foliage and winter skiing extended the tourist season. The Flying Yankee train-set operated as the Mountaineer from Boston to Crawford Notch via Intervale Junction during World War II, but passenger service {{had been reduced to}} a single daily round-trip between Portland and St. Johnsbury by the 1930s. The train between Portland and St. Johnsbury usually consisted of a RPO-express car, a <b>baggage</b> <b>car</b> and a single coach after the 1920s; and substitution of a stainless steel combination for the coach and <b>baggage</b> <b>car</b> reduced the train to two cars {{for the last several years}} before the end of passenger service in 1958.|$|E
50|$|The Tidewater and Western Locomotive {{had from}} {{seven to eight}} engines. There were nine {{passenger}} <b>cars</b> and 2 <b>baggage</b> <b>cars.</b> The train hauled mostly freight and there were 143 freight cars.|$|R
50|$|Four {{types of}} rolling stock run on PNR's lines: the locomotives, the Commex express <b>cars,</b> <b>baggage</b> <b>cars</b> and DRC railcars. All {{services}} were operated by GE Universal Series locomotives and Hyundai Rotem DMUs. There were 14 locomotives, 18 (3 car trains, 6 sets total) Diesel Multiple Units, 2 <b>baggage</b> <b>cars</b> and 8 DRC railcars currently operating. Surplus sleeper coaches from Japan Railways were recently acquired by PNR, and were delivered on November 2010. More used rolling stock from Japan Railways was recently acquired by PNR, and arrived in 2011 which included some 203 series EMU, KiHa 52 and Kogane Train (Kiha 59).|$|R
50|$|The {{completion}} of the Northern Central Railway after 1850 further escalated Elmira's contribution to the Underground Railroad. The new railway allowed slaves to hide in <b>baggage</b> <b>cars,</b> making their journey quicker and easier.|$|R
25|$|The gang's later train robberies had {{a lighter}} touch. The gang held up {{passengers}} only twice, choosing {{in all other}} incidents to take only {{the contents of the}} express safe in the <b>baggage</b> <b>car.</b> John Newman Edwards made sure to highlight such techniques when creating an image of James as a kind of Robin Hood. Despite public sentiment toward the gang's crimes, {{there is no evidence that}} the James gang ever shared any of the robbery money outside their personal circle.|$|E
25|$|A Siemens ICE 1 {{trainset}} and a Kalmar Verkstad X2000 trainset {{were tested}} on the Northeast Corridor {{and several other}} routes in 1992 and 1993. The X2000 retained its Statens Järnvägar livery of silver with blue stripes, although it did receive Amtrak lettering; it was pulled by Amtrak diesels on non-electrified routes. The ICE 1 retained its Deutsche Bahn livery of white with a two-tone red stripe, again with Amtrak lettering. On non-electrified routes, it was pulled by two Siemens F69PHAC diesel locomotives and a <b>baggage</b> <b>car,</b> all painted in the same red-on-white scheme.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Gulf Coast Rebel used {{a heavyweight}} consist which received some streamlining and other cosmetic enhancements. Two consists {{were necessary to}} protect the service. Each had a mail car, <b>baggage</b> <b>car,</b> coach, buffet-coach, and sleeping car (Tower-series 8-section 1-drawing room 3-double bedroom cars Show Me and Deep South). As mentioned above American Car and Foundry delivered new lightweight cars to the GM in 1947–1948 which were used throughout the system. These included 68-seat coaches, 31-seat parlor cars, and four 4-section 8-roomette 1-compartment 3-double bedroom sleeping cars. Originally ALCO DL-105s (styled by Otto Kuhler) handled the Gulf Coast Rebel. Later motive power included the ALCO PA-1 and the uncommon Baldwin DR-6.|$|E
5000|$|April 5, 1964: Train No. 123 {{with five}} diesel units and 16 cars hits a rockslide at 81 miles-per-hour near Doublea, Arizona, which derails the five diesels, a {{passenger}} <b>car</b> and ten <b>baggage</b> <b>cars.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Gull {{carried a}} diverse {{assortment}} of <b>baggage</b> <b>cars,</b> express cars, and mail cars {{from the five}} railroads offering through service. These were often conventional heavyweight cars, but included Bangor & Aroostook open-platform, steel-underframe wood <b>baggage</b> <b>cars</b> {{in the years before}} World War II, and Boston & Maine converted troop sleeper <b>baggage</b> <b>cars</b> after the war. Boston received fish from the Maritimes in express reefers and milk from Newport, Maine, in Pfaudler milk cars leased to HP Hood. The train often included Boston & Maine lightweight American Flyer coaches built in the 1930s by the Pullman Company's Osgood Bradley Car Company plant in Worcester, Massachusetts. Stainless steel coaches started appearing in the train after a joint order by Maine Central and Boston & Maine in 1947. Stainless steel sleeping cars were delivered to the Bangor & Aroostook and Boston & Maine in 1954. [...] The train was typically pulled by 4-6-2 steam locomotives, although Maine Central and Boston & Maine EMD E7s were used in the United States after World War II.|$|R
25|$|Because of this crash, {{rear-end}} buffer <b>cars</b> (<b>baggage</b> car,power <b>car,</b> or {{an empty}} passengers coach) were mandatory for every locomotive-drawn passenger trains in Indonesia.|$|R
25|$|Festival Express {{was staged}} in three Canadian cities: Toronto, Winnipeg and Calgary, {{during the summer}} of 1970. Rather than flying into each city, the musicians {{traveled}} by chartered Canadian National Railways train, in a total of 14 cars (two engines, one diner, five sleepers, two lounge cars, two flat cars, one <b>baggage</b> <b>car,</b> and one staff car). The train journey between cities ultimately became a combination of non-stop jam sessions and partying fueled by alcohol. One highlight of the documentary is a drunken jam session featuring The Band's Rick Danko, the Grateful Dead's Jerry Garcia and Bob Weir, New Riders of the Purple Sage's John Dawson, as well as Janis Joplin.|$|E
25|$|The Cascades {{paint scheme}} was created {{specifically}} for Amtrak's Cascades trains, operated in Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. On the locomotives, the Cascades scheme {{is very similar}} to the Pacific Surfliner paint scheme, though the colors themselves are different on the Cascades. Instead of the large blue streaks {{on the side of the}} engine, it is colored green. The black mask across the cab windows is colored brown. On the Cascades Talgo equipment, the green streak slides down the <b>baggage</b> <b>car</b> & power car, and then runs down the bottom of the rest of the cars. This inverts the colors from the order on the locomotive making the middle part of the cars brown.|$|E
25|$|Following {{withdrawal}} from service a number of RM class were stored around the country. Several units along with Vulcan RMs were sold to the abortive Southern Rail preservation project at Christchurch where they were scrapped; the cab and <b>baggage</b> <b>car</b> section of the No.1 end of RM 119 on the leading bogie together with some engines and gearboxes were kept at this time. After the project was wound up, the partial section of RM 119 was moved to Linwood Locomotive Depot where it remained in storage for several years. Subsequently the further abbreviated RM 119 consisting of just the cab {{and part of the}} baggage compartment was stored in a Bromley scrapyard, where it was found and purchased by the RM 133 Trust Board.|$|E
5000|$|In 1938-1940 the Budd Company {{constructed}} {{a fleet of}} lightweight cars for the CB&Q for use on various routes. This fleet included <b>baggage</b> <b>cars,</b> dining cars (48 seats), dining-parlor-observation cars, and coaches. Each of these carried a name starting with [...] "Silver", as had become the custom with the CB&Q's Zephyrs. The lightweight equipment for the 1940 Ak-Sar-Ben Zephyr came from this pool.|$|R
25|$|The 40th Anniversary Exhibit Train {{consisted}} of P40DC locomotive #822, NPCU #406, modified heritage sleeper Pacific Bend, three heritage <b>baggage</b> <b>cars</b> used as exhibit cars, and reconfigured Amfleet cafe car #85999. The whole train was painted in Phase III.|$|R
50|$|In {{its early}} year the railway was also {{essential}} for communication. In addition to mail transported in <b>baggage</b> <b>cars,</b> telephone wires would typically parallel railway lines, which relayed voice communication and telegraphs between railway stations and nearby post offices.|$|R
