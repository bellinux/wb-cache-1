5|$|Up till now, the Muslim {{army had}} adopted a largely {{defensive}} strategy, <b>but</b> <b>knowing</b> that the Byzantines were apparently no longer eager for battle, Khalid now {{decided to take}} the offensive and reorganized his troops accordingly. All the cavalry regiments were grouped together into one powerful mounted force with the mobile guard acting as its core. The total strength of this cavalry group was now about 8,000 mounted warriors, an effective mounted corps for an offensive attack the next day. The rest of the day passed uneventfully. Khalid planned to trap Byzantine troops, cutting off their every route of escape. There were three natural barriers, the three gorges in the battlefield with their steep ravines, Wadi-ur-Ruqqad at west, Wadi al Yarmouk in south and Wadi al Allah in east. The northern route was to be blocked by Muslim cavalry.|$|E

5|$|Having had two frigates {{confirm that}} the French fleet was still at Brest, and {{realising}} that it would leave to protect the imminent convoy, Howe attempted an interception in advance by placing his ships where he thought an encounter likely. After thirteen days of searching, the British fleet returned on 19May, to find the fleet in Brest gone. On the same day, Howe's fleet fell in with the fifth-rate , which had been attached to Rear-Admiral Sir George Montagu's squadron. Also searching for the convoy, Montagu had been cruising between Cape Ortugal and Belle-Isle, <b>but</b> <b>knowing</b> he would be hopelessly outnumbered, he had sent Venus to locate Howe and ask for reinforcements. At 04:00 the next morning, Howe ordered all sail {{in an attempt to}} reach Montagu before the French. A Dutch convoy, bound for Lisbon, had been captured by the French on 19 May and some of these ships were intercepted by the British on 21 May. The crews were able to provide information regarding the whereabouts of the French fleet and Howe set off in pursuit, realising that Montagu was no longer in danger. Not wishing to reduce his numbers by allocating prize crews, Howe ordered the convoy destroyed.|$|E

25|$|The {{nomenclature}} of the {{basal ganglia}} {{system and its}} components has always been problematic. Early anatomists, seeing the macroscopic anatomical structure <b>but</b> <b>knowing</b> nothing of the cellular architecture or neurochemistry, grouped together components that are now believed to have distinct functions (such as {{the internal and external}} segments of the globus pallidus), and gave distinct names to components that are now thought to be functionally parts of a single structure (such as the caudate nucleus and putamen).|$|E
25|$|According to one tradition, {{before meeting}} his patron Hajji Zayn al-Attar, Hafez {{had been working}} in a bakery, {{delivering}} bread to a wealthy quarter of the town. There, he first saw Shakh-e Nabat, a woman of great beauty, to whom some of his poems are addressed. Ravished by her beauty <b>but</b> <b>knowing</b> that his love for her would not be requited, he allegedly held his first mystic vigil in his desire to realize this union. Still, he encountered a being of surpassing beauty who identified himself as an angel, and his further attempts at union became mystic; a pursuit of spiritual union with the divine. A Western parallel is that of Dante and Beatrice.|$|E

25|$|The {{fifteen years}} of Mughal–Maratha joint rule {{was a time of}} almost unceasing disturbance. Within the city Momin Khan, till his death in 1743, held without dispute the chief place among the Muslims. For a short time after Momin Khan's death, power (1743) passed into the hands of Fida-ud-din Khan. It was then usurped by Jawan Mard Khan, and he, in spite of the {{attempts}} of Muftakhir Khan, afterwards Momin Khan II. (1743), and Fakhrud-daulah (1744-48) the nominal Viceroys, held it during the ten remaining years. Meanwhile, the cunning and greed of the Marathas caused unceasing trouble and disorder. Driven out in 1738, before a year was over they forced themselves back. Again in 1742 the Muslims rose against them, kept them out of power for about two years, and for a time held their leader Rangoji a prisoner. Escaping from confinement, Rangoji next year (1744) returned and forced Jawan to give him his share of power. Acknowledging their claims for some years, Jawan, in 1750, when Damaji Gaekwad was in the Deccan, again drove the Marathas out of the city. For two years Jawan remained in sole power, till in 1752 the Peshwa, owning now the one-half of the Gaekwad's revenues, sent Pandurang Pandit to collect his dues. Shutting the gates Jawan succeeded in keeping the Marathas at bay. <b>But</b> <b>knowing</b> his weakness he admitted their claim to share the revenue and allowed their deputies to stay in his town. Next year (1753) when Jawan was in Palanpur collecting revenue, the Peshwa and Gaekwad with from 30,000 to 40,000 horse, suddenly appearing in Gujarat, pressed north to Ahmedabad. The people, leaving the suburbs, fled within the walls. And the Marathas unopposed invested the city with their 30,000 horse, the Gaekwad blockading the north, Gopal Hari the east, and the Peshwa's deputy Raghunath Rao watching the south and west. Message after message sent to Jawan as he moved about the country, failed to reach him. One at last found him and starting with 200 picked horsemen he passed during the night through the Maratha lines and safely entered the city. Cheering the garrison they defended the city with vigour, foiling an attempt to surprise and driving back an open attack. Their deputies turned out of the city and Jawan's garrison gradually strengthened from outside, the Maratha chances of success seemed small. But Jawan was badly off for money, and, in spite of levies on the townspeople, he could not find enough to pay his troops. Terms were agreed on, and, giving Jawan a sum of £10,000 (Rs. 1,00,000), the Marathas in April 1753 entered Ahmedabad.|$|E

500|$|... "Porcelain" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Moby for his fifth studio album Play (1999) and recorded in his Little Italy, Manhattan apartment. He found the inspiration to compose the song from his experiences with an unidentified woman; speaking to Billboard, he explained: [...] "I {{was involved with}} this really, really wonderful woman, and I loved her very much. But I knew deep in my heart of hearts that we had no business being romantically involved. So, it's sort of about being {{in love with someone}} <b>but</b> <b>knowing</b> you shouldn't be with them." [...] Moby initially disliked the track, criticizing his production as [...] "mushy" [...] and his vocals as [...] "really weak". He had dismissed [...] "Porcelain" [...] as [...] "average" [...] and later recalled that he [...] "couldn't imagine anyone else wanting to listen to it" [...] – however, he was eventually talked into including it on Play.|$|E

500|$|The song's bleak lyrics were {{explained}} by Marker as {{a mockery of}} the angsty [...] " [...] thing" [...] themes prevalent in mid-1990s alternative rock songs, as well as a self-deprecating reference to Garbage's own dark lyrics, with Manson explaining that the song was [...] "a dig at ourselves because we like records that don't make us feel very happy, and at this so-called 'alternative' scene of 'we're so weird and more wonderful than everybody else'". Vig added that [...] "'Only Happy When It Rains' was about what happened with grunge and the angst-filled thing which has dominated the American alternative rock scene. With us there's self-deprecation, we have to poke fun at ourselves because we're so incredibly obsessive about the songs and the lyrics, which makes us filled with self-loathing, hurhur." [...] Garbage said they referenced both the title of The Jesus and Mary Chain song [...] "Happy When It Rains" [...] (1987) and Manson's own Scottish psyche. Lyrically, Manson described [...] "Only Happy When It Rains" [...] as [...] "about wanting love <b>but</b> <b>knowing</b> life will always get in the way.... yet not being obliterated by that. It's a song for people that know {{what it is like to}} live on the dark side of life. It's about devotion but a different kind. A devotion to the truth and to freedom... and to hell with the consequences." ...|$|E
500|$|When the American {{actress who}} had been hired to play Anne dropped out just {{before the start of}} {{principal}} photography, Argento convinced Nicolodi to take on this larger role. Nicolodi found Anne to have a different personality than her own, and much preferred the characters she had played for Argento previously, who she said had much more personality than Anne. She said the role required little energy or imagination, but liked the novelty of playing neither killer nor victim. Newman and Alan Jones agreed that Nicolodi had very little character to play, as written. Newman added that this lack of character stretched to all the Italians in the film, and that only the American characters had discernible personalities. Nicolodi later claimed that although filming began well enough, Argento became angry when she and Franciosa bonded over playwright Tennessee Williams and their experience in theatre, leading the director to make sure their shared scenes [...] "were an ordeal to endure". The charged atmosphere culminated with Argento reportedly telling Franciosa, [...] "leave my woman alone!" [...] Nicolodi said she channelled her frustrations with the situation into her character's last scene in the film, where Anne stands in the rain and screams repeatedly, continuing over the film's end credits. She had been directed to scream only a little, <b>but</b> <b>knowing</b> it was the last day of filming and her last scene to complete, Nicolodi screamed loudly and for a long time, much to Argento's and the crew's surprise. Nicolodi said the scene was her [...] "cathartic release from the whole nightmare".|$|E
