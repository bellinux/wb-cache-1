Compared to the 100 % cereal <b>biscuits,</b> sorghum-soy and bread wheat-soy 1 : 1 ratio composite <b>biscuits</b> {{had at least}} double the protein content and the lysine content increased by 500 – 700 %. For the sorghum-soy <b>biscuits,</b> in vitro protein digestibility increased by 170 %. Two such <b>biscuits</b> of 28 g each could provide 50 % of the recommended daily protein intake for 3 - to 10 - year-olds. Descriptive sensory evaluation revealed that sorghum-soy composite <b>biscuits</b> had crispy and dry texture characteristics associated with <b>biscuits.</b> Sensory evaluation by school children showed that the composite <b>biscuits</b> were rated as acceptable as the cereal only <b>biscuits,</b> and this was maintained over 4 days of evaluation.

40|$|Protein-energy {{malnutrition}} (PEM) {{among children}} remains a huge burden in Africa. Due to poverty, such children {{rely on the}} same starchy staples, such as sorghum, consumed in the household, as both their source of energy and protein. However, sorghum has a low protein quality, {{particularly with respect to}} the indispensable amino acid lysine and also protein digestibility. Local pulses such as cowpea are important vehicles to address PEM. <b>Biscuits</b> are favoured as means of fortification because they are palatable, nutrient-dense, in ready-to-eat form and have a long shelf-life. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to develop and evaluate the effect of fortifying whole grain sorghum with whole grain cowpea on the nutritional quality, instrumental, sensory characteristics and consumer evaluation of the <b>biscuits.</b> Composite <b>biscuits</b> were produced from two types of whole grain sorghums, white tan-plant, non-tannin (WTP) and red non-tannin (RNT) composited with whole grain cowpea at 60 : 40 ratio. These were compared with commercial economic wheat <b>biscuits.</b> Sorghum-cowpea <b>biscuits</b> had 50 - 60 % higher protein content than 100 % sorghum <b>biscuits</b> but were {{the same as that of}} wheat <b>biscuits.</b> The mineral content of sorghum-cowpea <b>biscuits</b> was 27 - 29 % and 37 % higher than that of 100 % sorghum and wheat <b>biscuits,</b> respectively. The pepsin in-vitro protein digestibility (IVPD) of the sorghum-cowpea <b>biscuits</b> was 71 - 81 % higher than that of 100 % <b>biscuits</b> due to inclusion of the more digestible cowpea globulin proteins. However, the average pepsin IVPD of the sorghum and sorghum-cowpea <b>biscuits</b> was 211 % and 76 % lower than that of wheat <b>biscuits,</b> respectively. There was no trypsin inhibitor activity in the sorghum-cowpea <b>biscuits</b> due to the dilution of the trypsin inhibitors in cowpea. The total phenolic content of the sorghum-cowpea <b>biscuits</b> was 30 - 45 % and 70 % higher than that of 100 % sorghum and wheat <b>biscuits,</b> respectively. Sorghum-cowpea <b>biscuits</b> were stronger than 100 % sorghum <b>biscuits</b> due to water soluble-globulin proteins from cowpea. Correspondence analysis (CA) revealed that 64 % of the variation in terms of texture and flavour of the <b>biscuits</b> was due to type of cereal (sorghum or wheat) and 23 % was due to the presence of cowpea in <b>biscuits,</b> respectively. Standard wheat <b>biscuits</b> were the most liked. However, using cluster analysis, individual overall liking of consumers varied and four different clusters of consumers with similar liking of the <b>biscuits</b> were identified. Two clusters with substantial percentage of consumers (41 %) liked the sorghum-cowpea <b>biscuits.</b> These findings suggest that sorghum-cowpea composite <b>biscuits</b> could well serve as an acceptable high quality protein-rich complementary food to alleviate PEM, and generate income for smallholder farmers in rural areas of Africa where sorghum and cowpea are produced and consumed as staples.

5|$|Sexuality {{played an}} {{important}} role in Crowley's ideas about magick and his practice of it, and has been described as being central to Thelema. He outlined three forms of sex magick—the autoerotic, homosexual, and heterosexual—and argued that such acts could be used to focus the magician's will onto a specific goal such as financial gain or personal creative success. For Crowley, sex was treated as a sacrament, with the consumption of sexual fluids interpreted as a Eucharist. This was often manifested as the Cakes of Light, a <b>biscuit</b> containing either menstrual blood or a mixture of semen and vaginal fluids. The Gnostic Mass is the central religious ceremony within Thelema.|$|E
