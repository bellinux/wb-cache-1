2500|$|At 2125 hrs on 9 November 1942 Wandle was {{in ballast}} heading northwards off Lowestoft when a {{flotilla}} of E-boats attacked her convoy. A torpedo struck her starboard side about [...] forward of her bridge. It almost completely blew off her bow, and flung débris {{so far that}} it killed a Royal Artillery Maritime Regiment DEMS gunner in the after part of the ship. After 20 minutes her crew launched both lifeboats and abandoned ship. A rescue tug recovered the survivors {{and then went to}} recover survivors from another ship that had been sunk. After this Wandle was still afloat but she was on fire, her <b>below</b> <b>decks</b> <b>accommodation</b> was flooded, her fore part awash and her no. 2 hold taking water.|$|R
50|$|In {{designing}} the Denis Sullivan, architects Timothy Graul Marine Services looked to several nineteenth century Great Lakes schooners for inspiration, including the Rouse Simmons, Clipper City, and Alvin Clark. Above the waterline, the Sullivan closely resembles these earlier vessels. Her shape {{is that of}} an efficient cargo carrier, and her rigging and deck arrangement are likewise authentic. She differs from her predecessors, however, below the waterline. Traditionally, Great Lakes cargo schooners were built with a fairly flat bottom to minimize draft and permit sailing in shallow waters. They carried a centerboard to compensate for this when sailing to windward. The Denis Sullivan strayed from this tradition to meet both modern Coast Guard safety requirements and the practical considerations of a passenger vessel. She has a relatively deep hull and weighted keel, which provide greater stability to the vessel and allow for 6 ft of head clearance in the <b>below</b> <b>decks</b> <b>accommodations.</b> An additional concession to safety regulations was {{the division of the}} traditional cargo hold into watertight bulkheads.|$|R

However, in 1907-1908, the North Company {{reduced the number of}} the ship's cruises, and entirely withdrew from the market at the end of August 1908. It was subsequently decided to convert the ship into a ferry and to that end the lower <b>deck</b> <b>accommodation</b> was removed and cargo holds created. The main <b>deck</b> <b>accommodation</b> was also completely remodelled and the superstructure was extended.|$|R
