5|$|Silver {{was among}} the most {{influential}} jazz musicians of his lifetime. Grove Music Online describes his legacy as at least fourfold: as a pioneer of hard bop; as a user of what became the archetypal quintet instrumentation of tenor saxophone, trumpet, piano, bass, and drums; as a developer of young musicians who went on to <b>become</b> <b>important</b> players and bandleaders; and for his skill as a composer and arranger.|$|E
5|$|The Bend {{remained}} an agricultural settlement for nearly 80 more years. Even by 1836, {{there were only}} 20 households in the community. At this time, the Westmorland Road became open to year-round travel and a regular mail coach service was established between Saint John and Halifax. The Bend became an important transfer and rest station along the route. Over the next decade, lumbering and then shipbuilding would <b>become</b> <b>important</b> industries in the area.|$|E

5|$|The {{speed of}} light has <b>become</b> <b>important</b> in {{high-frequency}} trading, where traders seek to gain minute advantages by delivering their trades to exchanges fractions of a second ahead of other traders. For example, traders have been switching to microwave communications between trading hubs, because of the advantage which microwaves travelling at near to the {{speed of light}} in air, have over fibre optic signals which travel 30–40% slower at {{the speed of light}} through glass.|$|E
5|$|Building 28 (Structure 5D-28) is {{an unusual}} {{building}} {{at the top of}} an access stairway {{on the east side of}} the basal platform. It appears to have been a guardroom controlling access from the east terrace. The chamber originally contained curtained doorways and benches against the walls. The width of the building completely blocked access from the stairway; this forced visitors to pass through the chamber, where their presence could be scrutinised and passage beyond blocked if necessary. This route may have <b>become</b> <b>important</b> when Temple 33 was built, blocking the main access stairway from the Great Plaza. Structure 5D-28 was built very late in the Early Classic period (around the 6th century).|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1600s, the Sihanaka {{had already}} {{established}} themselves {{as one of}} the island's most important trading groups. Their location on the main trade route between the coast and the Merina capital of Antananarivo enabled them to <b>become</b> <b>important</b> trading partners beginning in the 18th century; slave trading was a major source of income until outlawed under Radama I in the 1810s. The Sihanaka women also produced pottery, which was baked using wood collected by men in the surrounding forests.|$|E

5|$|Copper is biostatic, meaning {{bacteria}} {{and many other}} forms of life will not grow on it. For this reason {{it has long been}} used to line parts of ships to protect against barnacles and mussels. It was originally used pure, but has since been superseded by Muntz metal and copper-based paint. Similarly, as discussed in copper alloys in aquaculture, copper alloys have <b>become</b> <b>important</b> netting materials in the aquaculture industry because they are antimicrobial and prevent biofouling, even in extreme conditions and have strong structural and corrosion-resistant properties in marine environments.|$|E
5|$|Mollusc {{species can}} also {{represent}} hazards or pests for human activities. The {{bite of the}} blue-ringed octopus is often fatal, and that of Octopus apollyon causes inflammation that can last for over a month. Stings from a few species of large tropical cone shells can also kill, but their sophisticated, though easily produced, venoms have <b>become</b> <b>important</b> tools in neurological research. Schistosomiasis (also known as bilharzia, bilharziosis or snail fever) is transmitted to humans via water snail hosts, and affects about 200million people. Snails and slugs can also be serious agricultural pests, and accidental or deliberate introduction of some snail species into new environments has seriously damaged some ecosystems.|$|E
5|$|The estuary stingray's diminished {{population}} and susceptibility to multiple threats {{have led the}} International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to assess it as Vulnerable. Demographic modelling has shown that {{it is likely to}} become Endangered without intervention. Several Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are located within its range, but at present they lack adequate protection from fishing. As this ray remains locally abundant in Hervey Bay and parts of Moreton Bay, these areas may <b>become</b> <b>important</b> centers for preserving the species. The Queensland government has listed the estuary stingray on the Back on Track species prioritisation framework, to facilitate the development of conservation measures.|$|E

Players who move recklessly will make more noise and attract more attention.|$|E
5|$|While in Egypt, Antony {{had been}} engaged in an affair with Cleopatra and had fathered three {{children}} with her. Aware of his deteriorating relationship with Octavian, Antony left Cleopatra; he sailed to Italy in 40BC with a large force to oppose Octavian, laying siege to Brundisium. This new conflict proved untenable for both Octavian and Antony, however. Their centurions, who had <b>become</b> <b>important</b> figures politically, refused to fight due to their Caesarian cause, while the legions under their command followed suit. Meanwhile, in Sicyon, Antony's wife Fulvia died of a sudden illness while Antony was en route to meet her. Fulvia's death and the mutiny of their centurions allowed the two remaining triumvirs to effect a reconciliation.|$|E
5|$|In {{engineering}} or household applications, {{current is}} often described as being either direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC). These terms refer to how the current varies in time. Direct current, as produced by example from a battery and required by most electronic devices, is a unidirectional flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative. If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. Alternating current is any current that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always this {{takes the form of a}} sine wave. Alternating current thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time. The time-averaged value of an alternating current is zero, but it delivers energy in first one direction, and then the reverse. Alternating current is affected by electrical properties that are not observed under steady state direct current, such as inductance and capacitance. These properties however can <b>become</b> <b>important</b> when circuitry is subjected to transients, such as when first energised.|$|E

5|$|Love, sex {{and desire}} <b>become</b> <b>important</b> {{elements}} of the plot in Sant Singh Sekhon's Punjabi play Kalakar (1945), which places the epic drama in the modern age. It depicts Ahalya as a free-spirited woman, who dares to be painted nude by Inder (Indra), a pupil of the art professor, Gautama, and defends her decision against her husband's criticisms. N. S. Madhavan's Malayalam story (April 2006) also retells Ahalya's tale in a modern setting, wherein Ahalya, accused of adultery, is beaten by her husband, leaving her in a coma from which the neurologist, Rama, revives her. The 2015 film Ahalya gives a feminist twist to the tale where the policeman Indra turns into a stone doll, after visiting Ahalya. The tale was also parodied in the Telugu film Attarintiki Daredi. However, the practice of retelling the classical Ahalya–Indra tale in a contemporary setting is not new. The Yoga Vasistha (1001–1400) narrates {{a tale of two}} adulterous lovers, Queen Ahalya and the Brahmin Indra. Here, Ahalya and Indra fall in love and continue their affair, despite being punished by Ahalya's jealous husband. After death, they reunite in their next birth.|$|E
5|$|The islands {{were first}} taken into {{use as a}} whaling base in the 17th and 18th centuries, after which they were abandoned. Coal mining started at the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, and several permanent communities were established. The Svalbard Treaty of 1920 recognizes Norwegian sovereignty, and the 1925 Svalbard Act made Svalbard a full part of the Kingdom of Norway. They also established Svalbard as a free economic zone and a demilitarized zone. The Norwegian Store Norske and the Russian Arktikugol remain the only mining companies in place. Research and tourism have <b>become</b> <b>important</b> supplementary industries, with the University Centre in Svalbard (UNIS) and the Svalbard Global Seed Vault playing critical roles. No roads connect the settlements; instead snowmobiles, aircraft and boats serve inter-community transport. Svalbard Airport, Longyear serves as the main gateway.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sixteenth}} century, {{parliament}} usually met in Stirling Castle or the Old Tolbooth, Edinburgh, which was rebuilt on {{the orders of}} Mary Queen of Scots from 1561. Charles I ordered the construction of Parliament Hall, which was built between 1633 and 1639 and remained the parliament's home until it was dissolved in 1707. By {{the end of the}} Middle Ages the Parliament had evolved from the King's Council of Bishops and Earls into a 'colloquium' with a political and judicial role. The attendance of knights and freeholders had <b>become</b> <b>important,</b> and burgh commissioners joined them to form the Three Estates. It acquired significant powers over taxation, but it also had a strong influence over justice, foreign policy, war, and other legislation. Much of the legislative business of the Scottish parliament was carried out by a parliamentary committee known as the 'Lords of the Articles', which drafted legislation which was then presented to the full assembly to be confirmed. Like many continental assemblies the Scottish Parliament was being called less frequently by the early sixteenth century and might have been dispensed with by the crown {{had it not been for}} the series of minorities and regencies that dominated from 1513.|$|E
