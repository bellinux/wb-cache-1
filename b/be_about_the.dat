5|$|Eclogue 4, {{also known}} as the Fourth Eclogue is the name of a Latin poem by the Roman poet Virgil. Part of his first major work, the Eclogues, the piece was written around 40 BC, during a time of {{temporary}} stability following the Treaty of Brundisium; it was later published in and around the years 39–38 BC. The work describes the birth of a boy, a supposed savior, who once of age will become divine and eventually rule over the world. During late antiquity and the Middle Ages, a desire emerged to view Virgil as a virtuous pagan, and as such, early Christians, such as Roman Emperor Constantine, early Christian theologian Lactantius, and St. Augustineto varying degreesreinterpreted the poem to <b>be</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> birth of Jesus Christ.|$|E
5|$|Two {{locations}} on the Moon were given primary consideration for exploration by the Apollo 16 expedition: the Descartes Highlands region west of Mare Nectaris and the crater Alphonsus. At Descartes, the Cayley and Descartes formations {{were the primary}} areas of interest in that scientists suspected, based on telescopic and orbital imagery, that the terrain found there was formed by magma more viscous than that which formed the lunar maria. The Cayley Formation's age was approximated to <b>be</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> same as Mare Imbrium based on the local frequency of impact craters. The considerable distance between the Descartes site and previous Apollo landing sites would be beneficial for the network of geophysical instruments, portions of which were deployed on each Apollo expedition beginning with Apollo 12.|$|E

5|$|Writer Robert L. Forward {{described}} being {{inspired by}} astronomer Frank Drake's suggestion in 1973 that intelligent life could inhabit neutron stars. Physical models in 1973 implied that Drake's creatures would be microscopic. By the time Forward was outlining the book, newer models {{indicated that the}} cheela would <b>be</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> size of sesame seeds. Later Forward found an earlier letter in which he discussed the idea of high-gravity life in the Sun with science fiction novelist Hal Clement.|$|E
25|$|In a 2008 study, complex engine {{controls}} and increased {{exhaust gas recirculation}} allowed a compression ratio of 19.5 with fuels ranging from neat ethanol to E50.

25|$|Proponents {{argue that}} Interlingua's source {{languages}} {{include not only}} Romance languages but English, German, and Russian as well. Moreover, the source languages are widely spoken internationally, and large numbers of their words also appear in other languages – still more when derivative forms and loan translations are included. Tests had shown that if {{a larger number of}} source languages were used, the results would <b>be</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> same. So, IALA selected a much simpler extraction procedure for Interlingua with little adverse effect on its internationality.|$|E
25|$|Cypriniformes {{include the}} most {{primitive}} of the Ostariophysi {{in the narrow}} sense (i.e. excluding Gonorynchiformes). This is evidenced not only by physiological details, but their great distribution, which indicates they had the longest time to spread. The earliest that Cypriniformes might have diverged from Characiphysi (Characiformes and relatives) is thought to <b>be</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Early Triassic, about 250 million years ago (mya). However, their divergence probably occurred only with the splitting-up of Pangaea in the Jurassic, maybe 160 million years ago. By 110 mya, the plate tectonics evidence indicates that the Laurasian Cypriniformes must have been distinct from their Gondwanan relatives.|$|E

25|$|At around , R136a1 is {{the most}} {{luminous}} star known, radiating more energy in five seconds than the Sun does in a year. If it replaced the Sun in the Solar System, it would outshine the Sun by 94,000 times (MV = 7.6) and would appear from Earth at magnitude -39. Its brightness {{at a distance of}} 10 parsecs, the absolute visual magnitude, is -7.6, three magnitudes brighter than Venus ever appears from Earth. Its brightness at the distance of the nearest star to Earth, Proxima Centauri (just over a parsec), would <b>be</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> same as the full Moon.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, south facing {{solar panels}} were {{installed}} {{on the roof of}} the parking garage, but they caused so much glare for the nearby control tower for 45 minutes each morning that they were removed, and later replaced with 2,210 panels (460kW AC) that were reoriented to the east to eliminate the glare. The airport expects to save $100,000 each year on electricity by having the solar panels. The efficiency of east or west facing panels is reduced by about 10% so more panels were added so the total generation would <b>be</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> same, and the array is expected to generate about 585,000 kWh each year.|$|E
25|$|While {{this was}} taking place, the {{original}} ZETA II proposal {{had been growing}} ever-larger, eventually specifying currents as powerful as the Joint European Torus that was built years later. As it seemed this was beyond the state-of-the-art, the project was eventually cancelled in February 1959. A new proposal soon took its place, the Intermediate-Current Stability Experiment (ICSE). ICSE was designed {{to take advantage of}} further stabilising effects noticed in M-theory, which suggested that very fast pinches would cause the current to flow only in the outer layer of the plasma, which should be much more stable. Over time, this machine grew to <b>be</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> same size as ZETA; ICSE had a 6m major diameter and 1m minor diameter, powered by bank of capacitors storing 10MJ at 100kV.|$|E

25|$|The {{first two}} {{elements}} of period 8 {{are expected to}} be ununennium and unbinilium, elements 119 and 120. Their electron configurations should have the 8s orbital being filled. This orbital is relativistically stabilized and contracted and thus, elements 119 and 120 should be more like rubidium and strontium than their immediate neighbours above, francium and radium. Another effect of the relativistic contraction of the 8s orbital is that the atomic radii of these two elements should <b>be</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> same of those of francium and radium. They should behave like normal alkali and alkaline earth metals, normally forming +1 and +2 oxidation states respectively, but the relativistic destabilization of the 7p3/2 subshell and the relatively low ionization energies of the 7p3/2 electrons should make higher oxidation states like +3 and +4 (respectively) possible as well.|$|E
25|$|A Monmouth University/Asbury Park Press poll, {{published}} February 24, 2014, showed Christie's {{job approval}} ratings in New Jersey at 50%, which was down 9% since January and 20% from 12 months prior. Other results showed 61% believed {{the governor was}} not completely honest about what {{he knew about the}} toll lane closures, and 50% (up from 34% in January) thought Christie was personally involved in the decision to close the toll lanes. A similar poll, released on April 2, showed his approval ratings to <b>be</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> same, remaining 14 points lower than December, before the Bridgegate scandal broke. It reported that 62% said that Bridgegate and Hoboken's Sandy relief aid issues hurt his presidential prospects for 2016, up from 51% in January.|$|E
25|$|In Kathak, abhinaya is in {{the form}} of {{expressive}} gestures and pantomime set to music that usually outline a legend or the plot of a well known story. The gestures and facial expressions convey the ras (sentiment, emotional taste) and bhava (mood) of the underlying story. In the Hindu texts on dance, the guru and the artists successfully express the spiritual ideas by paying attention to four aspects of a performance: Angik (gestures and body language), Vachik (song, recitation, music and rhythm), Aharya (costume, make up, jewelry), and Satvik (artist's mental disposition and emotional connection with the story and audience, wherein the artist's inner and outer state resonates). A Kathak nritya performance, however grants flexibility to the artists and invites improvisation, and it may not be accompanied with a song or recital about the legend. The stories in Kathak performance generally tend to <b>be</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Hindu god Krishna (or in some cases Shiva or Devi), and the stories come from sources such as the Bhagavata Purana, or the Indian Epics. This form of expressiveness is also found in thumri and Persian ghazals.|$|E

Cain and Abel also appear {{in a number of other}} texts, and the story is the subject of various interpretations. Abel, the first murder victim, is sometimes seen as the first martyr; while Cain, the first murderer, is sometimes seen as an ancestor of evil. Some scholars suggest the pericope may have been based on a Sumerian story representing the conflict between nomadic shepherds and settled farmers. Modern scholars typically view the stories of Adam and Eve and Cain and Abel to <b>be</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> development of civilization during the age of agriculture; not the beginnings of man, but when people first learned agriculture, replacing the ways of the hunter-gatherer.|$|E
