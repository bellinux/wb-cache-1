40|$|There was a {{time when}} the answer-phone was thought too alienating for patients; now there is the {{question}} of whether therapists feel OK being paid <b>by</b> electronic <b>bank</b> <b>transfer.</b> Since the start of modern psychotherapy, new communications technology—the telephone, radio, TV, and now electronic messaging—have become universally accessible. The question arises: do email, texts and the mobile (cell-phone) enhance and enable communication or do they merely offer the fantasy of doing so? Equally, can computer simulations and software diagnostic and treatment programmes offer anything to mental health practice? Furthermore, since the mid-nineteenth century, the technology of visual communication, in particular, paralleled the development of psychodynamic theory and practice. Nowadays, photographic images have become so prevalent and available that clients can bring pictures in many forms. They also bring movies, movie-scenes and characters, either in description or to show, and these may constitute the images and material of analysis in some cases just as dreams always have done. How are we to respond to these unconventional communications of our clients' emotional lives? Are they legitimate expressions of their inner worlds? This paper discusses the influence of the new technologies of communication with a special focus on the place of film themes and images in psychotherapy and analytic sessions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a three-period model to analyze why banks need bank reserves for interbank payments despite {{the availability of}} other liquid assets like Treasury securities. The model shows that banks need extra liquidity if they settle <b>bank</b> <b>transfers</b> without the central bank. In this case, each pair of banks sending and receiving <b>bank</b> <b>transfers</b> must determine the terms of settlement between them bilaterally in an over- the-counter transaction. As a result, a receiving bank can charge a sending bank a premium for the settlement of <b>bank</b> <b>transfers,</b> because depositors'demand for timely payments causes a hold-up problem for a sending bank. In light of this result, the large value payment system operated <b>by</b> the central <b>bank</b> {{can be regarded as}} an interbank settlement contract to save liquidity. A third party like the central bank must operate this system because a custodian of collateral is necessary to implement the contract. This result implies that bank reserves are not independent liquid assets, but the balances of collateral submitted <b>by</b> <b>banks</b> to participate into a liquidity-saving contract. The optimal contract is the floor system. Whether a private clearing house can replace the central bank depends on the range of collateral it can accept. 2012 ～ 2016 年度科学研究費補助金[基盤研究(S) ]「長期デフレの解明」(研究代表者 東京大学経済学研究科・渡辺努, 課題番号： 24223003...|$|R

40|$|Since state {{institutions}} began using account screening, {{in the bank}} sector, not only in cases of suspicion, but as a standard procedure for monitoring account and invest-ment data, much of the illegal transfer of funds has shifted towards cash payments. In order to hinder, or even do away with such illegal monetary transactions, the EU is considering two possible courses of action; one moderate and one more radical. The moderate solution would see the introduction of legislation restricting the amount of cash used in payments. Several countries already have such legislation. It is possible that this limit could be adjusted by governments ad hoc, and could even be set at zero. This would be the radical course of action; doing away completely with cash payments. The consequence {{would be that the}} transfer of money would only be possible <b>by</b> <b>bank</b> <b>transfer</b> from account to account. Representatives of the banking sector are in favour of the campaign to eliminate the use of cash transactions, as this would lead to advantages within the banking indus-try. However, there would be many disadvantages for the general public. In the world of commerce, contractual liberty is a fundamental principle. All contracting parties have the right, within the law, to negotiate the terms of a contract to be signed, laying down goods or payment (cash included) to be made, {{as a part of the}} contract. Thus, legislation restricting the use of cash would be a breach of the free-dom of rights as laid down in the constitution of any EU country. The question as to whether or not to do away with the use of 500, - Euro bank notes is of little interest to legal and private monetary transactions, as these are seldom used in such cases. Since these notes are a simple way of transporting large sums of money unnoticed, their use is mainly limited to the world of illegal transactions where large sums of money need to be moved, as in the case of money launderin...|$|E
