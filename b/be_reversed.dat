5|$|Brady v. Maryland (1963) {{is another}} significant, {{specific}} criminal procedural right {{guaranteed by the}} due process clauses. Brady requires a criminal conviction to <b>be</b> <b>reversed</b> if the government withholds exculpatory (or impeachment) material, within the government's possession, from the defendant, {{and there is a}} reasonable probability that, if such material had been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would have been different ("materiality"). Brady is a holistic, rather than piece-by-piece, inquiry.|$|E
5|$|In most appeals, {{the parties}} argue {{opposing}} positions. In this case, both the appellee (the Menominee) and the appellant (the United States) {{argued that the}} decision of the Court of Claims should be affirmed. The State of Wisconsin, as amicus curiae, argued that the Court of Claims ruling should <b>be</b> <b>reversed.</b>|$|E
5|$|Louis XVIII {{signed the}} Treaty of Paris on 30 May 1814. The treaty gave France her 1792 borders, which {{extended}} {{east of the}} Rhine. She had to pay no war indemnity, and the occupying armies of the Sixth Coalition withdrew instantly from French soil. These generous terms would <b>be</b> <b>reversed</b> in the next Treaty of Paris after the Hundred Days (Napoleon's return to France in 1815).|$|E

5|$|The {{resulting}} 0.021572 is positive, so {{one would}} say that the euro is trading at a 0.021572 or 2.16% premium against the dollar for delivery in 30 days. Conversely, if one were to work this example in euro terms rather than dollar terms, the perspective would <b>be</b> <b>reversed</b> and one {{would say that}} the dollar is trading at a discount against the Euro.|$|E
5|$|Feeling a {{sense of}} debt to Pit, Dark Pit takes him to the Rewind Spring so time can <b>be</b> <b>reversed</b> for Pit's body. On his journey there, he, Palutena, and Viridi learn that Hades has been {{profiting}} off the wars against the Underworld Army, Forces of Nature, Aurum, and Chaos Kin by using the souls of slaughtered humans to add numbers to his forces. Upon arrival at the Rewind Spring, Pandora is revived due to the Spring's effects on her stolen powers within Dark Pit. Pandora then uses the Spring to restore her health and ultimately her physical body, but is still defeated by Dark Pit.|$|E
5|$|For {{people who}} need rapid {{reversal}} of warfarin such as due to serious bleeding or need emergency surgery, the effects of warfarin can <b>be</b> <b>reversed</b> with vitamin K, prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), or fresh frozen plasma (FFP) in addition to intravenous vitamin K. Blood products should not be routinely used to reverse warfarin overdose when vitamin K could work alone. PCC {{has been found to}} be better than FFP when rapid reversal is needed.|$|E
30|$|The {{next four}} {{transition}} rules say that s+t can reverse both branches, only by executing the same histories of atomic actions. When one branch s or t <b>is</b> <b>reversed</b> successfully, we define s+t <b>is</b> <b>reversed</b> successfully.|$|R

5|$|Irreversible inhibitors usually covalently modify an enzyme, and {{inhibition}} {{can therefore}} not <b>be</b> <b>reversed.</b> Irreversible inhibitors often contain reactive functional {{groups such as}} nitrogen mustards, aldehydes, haloalkanes, alkenes, Michael acceptors, phenyl sulfonates, or fluorophosphonates. These electrophilic groups react with amino acid side chains to form covalent adducts. The residues modified are those with side chains containing nucleophiles such as hydroxyl or sulfhydryl groups; these include the amino acids serine (as in DFP, right), cysteine, threonine, or tyrosine.|$|E
5|$|The Douglas Aircraft Company {{designed}} {{a system that}} would prevent the accidental reversal of propeller blades in-flight. During development of the DC-6, the company installed a system that cut electrical power to the mechanisms which rotated the blades while the airplane was in the air. When there was enough weight on the landing gear (which would only be the case when the aircraft was on the ground), a switch which supplied electrical power to the mechanisms was closedmeaning that when the aircraft touched down the blades could <b>be</b> <b>reversed</b> and thus the airplane could be slowed. When the switch was closed, a red flag would swing into view in the cockpit of the aircraft, warning the crew that the blades could <b>be</b> <b>reversed.</b> Should the switch fail to close upon landing, the flag could be raised manually and electrical power to the mechanisms would be restored. When the aircraft took off, electrical power would be cut to the mechanisms so that the propeller blades could not be inadvertently reversed, and the red flag swung out of sight. Reverse thrust warning lamps, which would have warned the crew if the propellers were reversed, were not fitted on Mainliner Idaho.|$|E
5|$|The Romulans had {{attempted}} to travel {{back in time and}} destroy the Federation, but they instead created a Federation dominated by Vulcans. They shielded a ship from the changes and compare the differences, realising that it needs to <b>be</b> <b>reversed.</b> Meanwhile, Captain Spock begins to act protectively of Ensign Kirk, but the Captain is injured on an away mission. After Doctor McCoy conducts a series of mental scans, the crew of the ShiKahr realise that history has been altered. The Romulans plot to use Kirk to force Spock to impersonate their leader. Spock mindmelds with Kirk, each realising their personas from the main timeline.|$|E

5|$|The {{common side}} effect is bleeding. Less common side effects may include areas of tissue damage and purple toes syndrome. Use is not {{generally}} recommended during pregnancy. It {{is recommended that}} the effects of warfarin typically be monitored by checking prothrombin time (INR) every one to four weeks. Many other medications and dietary factors can interact with warfarin, either increasing or decreasing its effectiveness. The effects of warfarin may <b>be</b> <b>reversed</b> with phytonadione (vitamin K1), fresh frozen plasma, or prothrombin complex concentrate.|$|E
5|$|As Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) {{attempts}} {{to negotiate with}} the Aldeans, they briefly allow Dr. Crusher to reunite with her son on the planet. Wesley hints about the Custodian to her, while she secretly passes him a tricorder to scan the Aldeans. After Picard fails to get the Aldeans to agree to the children's return, they fire an energy weapon that sends the Enterprise three days away from Aldea at maximum warp. The Aldeans warn that they can send the Enterprise an impossibly far distance if they refuse to cooperate. During the return trip, Dr. Crusher reviews the scanner results and finds the Aldeans are suffering from radiation poisoning, which has harmed their reproductive capabilities but can <b>be</b> <b>reversed</b> if the source is discovered. On arrival back at the planet, Picard orders the crew {{to try to find a}} way through the planet's shield while he restarts negotiations.|$|E
5|$|Dialogue {{heard in}} the dream {{sequence}} uses a distinctive reversed manner of speech. This was achieved by recording the actors' line phonetically reversed, and playing this audio backwards. David Lynch had begun experimenting with the technique in 1971, and had originally planned {{to use it in}} his 1977 debut feature, Eraserhead, before it finally found use in this episode. Describing the process of learning his lines backwards, Anderson notes that he first worked out the phonemes of each word rather than simply reading it back to front, and disregarded the inflection of any given word as this helped bolster the discordant effect of the end result. The reversed audio was also altered with a slight reverb effect. The actors were required to perform their movements backwards, as elements of the scene would <b>be</b> <b>reversed</b> entirely.|$|E

5|$|Goebel lost a close {{election}} to Republican William S. Taylor. When the General Assembly's session opened on January 2, 1900, {{the election results}} were immediately challenged. With Democrats in control of both houses of the Assembly, the results seemed sure to <b>be</b> <b>reversed.</b> The Assembly was still deliberating on January 30, 1900, when Goebel was shot by an unknown assailant {{as he entered the}} state capitol building. The following day, as Goebel was being treated for his wounds at a local hotel, the General Assembly invalidated enough votes to give him the election. He was sworn into office from his bed the same day. Three days later Goebel died, never having risen from the bed.|$|E
5|$|On April 25, 1968, {{the case}} was reargued. The tribe was again {{represented}} by Hobbs, who made the same basic argument that the hunting and fishing rights were not extinguished. The state of Wisconsin was represented by Bronson La Follette, the Attorney General of Wisconsin. La Follette argued that the plain language of the termination act not only ended federal supervision of the tribe, but extinguished the tribe and with it all treaty rights. He argued that the Court of Claims ruling was incorrect and should <b>be</b> <b>reversed,</b> and that the tribe was due compensation from the federal government. The United States was again represented by Claiborne, who reiterated his earlier argument.|$|E
5|$|Peroxiredoxins are peroxidases that {{catalyze}} {{the reduction}} of hydrogen peroxide, organic hydroperoxides, as well as peroxynitrite. They are divided into three classes: typical 2-cysteine peroxiredoxins; atypical 2-cysteine peroxiredoxins; and 1-cysteine peroxiredoxins. These enzymes share the same basic catalytic mechanism, in which a redox-active cysteine (the peroxidatic cysteine) in the active site is oxidized to a sulfenic acid by the peroxide substrate. Over-oxidation of this cysteine residue in peroxiredoxins inactivates these enzymes, but this can <b>be</b> <b>reversed</b> {{by the action of}} sulfiredoxin. Peroxiredoxins seem to be important in antioxidant metabolism, as mice lacking peroxiredoxin 1 or 2 have shortened lifespan and suffer from hemolytic anaemia, while plants use peroxiredoxins to remove hydrogen peroxide generated in chloroplasts.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} northern terminus of M-26 was in Laurium at M-15 (now US41); it {{was extended}} by 1927 along US41 to Mohawk and then replacing M-83 to Gay. This extension would <b>be</b> <b>reversed</b> in 1933 when the Mohawk to Gay routing {{was turned over}} to Keweenaw County control. A second extension in 1935 along US41 to Phoenix replaced M-129 between Phoenix and Eagle Harbor. At this time, M-206 was designated from M-26 to the Eagle Harbor light house. A rerouting of M-26 in November 1940 moved it between Phoenix and Eagle River, replacing M-111. The segment between Phoenix and Eagle River along Copper Falls Mine Road {{was turned over to}} Keweenaw County at this time.|$|E
5|$|While the {{wreckage}} was being examined, investigators {{found that all}} four engines were producing thrust {{at the time of}} impact. There were only two ways that the propeller could <b>be</b> <b>reversed</b> during the take-off sequence. Investigators ruled out electrical malfunction since, after detailed examination of the engine hub, there was no evidence found of this happening. Therefore, it was concluded that the only way the propeller could have been reversed was through an unintentional crew action. Although there was no formal evidence that a simulated engine failure was being performed, statements submitted by witnesses suggested that it was likely this was the case. United Airlines procedure calls for No. 4 engine to be shut down in a simulated engine failurethe same engine which was found at the crash site with its propellers reversed.|$|E
5|$|At Royal Rumble on January 23, 2000, The Rock {{entered the}} Royal Rumble match {{and was one}} of the final two remaining, along with Big Show; Show {{seemingly}} intended to throw The Rock over the top rope in a running powerslam-like position, but Rock countered the move on the ring apron, sending Big Show to the floor before re-entering the ring as the winner. However, The Rock's feet hit the floor first, although those watching the event on TV did not see that, until Big Show proved this with additional video footage, and claimed to be the rightful winner. Despite this proof, the original decision could not <b>be</b> <b>reversed,</b> so a number one contender's match for the WWF Championship was held at No Way Out, which Big Show won after Shane McMahon interfered and hit The Rock in the head with a steel chair as he attempted to execute a People's Elbow. The Rock defeated Big Show on March 13 episode of Raw Is War to regain the right to face the WWF Champion, Triple H, at WrestleMania 2000 in a fatal four-way elimination match, also including Big Show and Mick Foley. Each wrestler had a McMahon in his corner: Triple H had his wife, Stephanie, Foley had Linda, The Rock had Vince and Big Show had Shane. Triple H retained the title after Vince betrayed The Rock by hitting him with a chair.|$|E
