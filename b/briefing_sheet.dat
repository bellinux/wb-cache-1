It will also look at how learning providers interpret the connection between self-esteem, confidence and adult learning, and how that interpretation is translated into provision and support.

In the Portland region, foreclosure {{activity is}} comparable to {{many areas of the}} United States, with significant segments of the population struggling to make their mortgage payments. The foreclosure crisis continues to unfold in the United States. In 2009, RealtyTrac reported 3. 9 million foreclosure filings on 2. 8 million properties in the U. S., up 21 percent from the previous year. Foreclosure filings include default notices, scheduled foreclosure auctions and bank reversions. About two percent of all U. S. housing units received at least one foreclosure notice in 2009. California, Florida, Arizona and Illinois accounted for more than 50 percent of the 2009 foreclosure filings. In 2009, Oregon had the 11 th highest rate of foreclosures, with one foreclosure filing for every 47 housing units. Between 2008 and 2009, Oregon filings increased 89 percent. Compared with 2007, foreclosure filings in 2009 increased by 303 percent. While still high, monthly counts of pre-foreclosure notices in the Portland Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) have been steadily declining since late 2008.

40|$|Description: The role of pharmacists in General Practice has {{received}} increasing attention, with the RPS, RCGP and the NHS Alliance all {{coming out in}} support and promoting the role that pharmacists can play. However, in order for pharmacists to fulfil this role, {{it is important that}} they understand the general practice environment and the needs and opportunities for pharmacists. It is equally important that pharmacists practising in community pharmacy and hospital pharmacy also understand the general practice setting in order that they can optimise how they work with GPs to support transfer of care and enable patients to understand and effectively manage their long term conditions and medication. By understanding the processes and priorities of general practice, pharmacy students entering any sector of practice should be able to better work with general practice as part of a multidisciplinary and cross-care boundary team. At the University of Sunderland, an Academic Practitioner post was created in collaboration with Sunderland CCG, enabling an opportunity for undergraduate professional placements to be delivered in general practice. It was decided that the placement would fit best at Stage 3 of the MPharm programme at the University of Sunderland, linking with clinical topics such as diabetes which are introduced at this stage, and using a clinical topic which had been covered previously, COPD (covered in Stage 2) to introduce the new concept of the Quality and Outcomes Framework and to also contribute to spiral learning. There had been previously been success in using a rotational ‘station’ based model of placement delivery as part of the MPharm programme with other providers and a similar model was adopted for the general practice placements. Students rotated around four ‘stations’ which included: •	Exploring the role of a general practice administrator •	Observing a practice nurse clinic for chronic conditions •	A diabetes case study utilising a general practice clinical system •	An introduction to the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) Process or Method of Implementation: Requests for general practices to deliver placements were presented at local training events and via email using SCCG networks. A <b>briefing</b> <b>sheet</b> which included the requirements of the practice to deliver the placements was created and distributed to ensure that practices could deliver the placements as designed. The format and materials for placement delivery were designed by the link post, general practices and a primary care medicines optimisation service provider which was procured to support placement delivery. GP practice support pharmacists facilitated the placements. Challenges faced and learning points: Learning points •	Protocols can be used to build patient profiles in EMIS Web for case studies •	Utilising a medicines optimisation provider enabled smoother and more authentic delivery of placements •	Students valued the opportunity to see patients in practice nurse clinics •	The opportunity to use a GP clinical system was noted by students as being a useful exercise •	Spending time with general practice administration staff provided insight into repeat prescription processes and appointments which they could reconcile with their community pharmacy placement experiences Challenges •	Practice nurse clinics did sometimes not often run for long enough to accommodate all rotations of the placement •	Accommodating 2 students within a consultation room for observation was sometimes difficult due to space restrictions in rooms •	Students were often more proficient than anticipated at working through case studies, so these will be expanded for the next iteration of placements Summary of perceived benefits to patients, pharmacy and the NHS: Pharmacy undergraduates have had an introduction to the general practice environment which will support future multidisciplinary and cross-boundary working regardless of future setting. The placement may increase the number of pharmacists entering general practice based roles following registration...|$|E

40|$|It {{seems like}} {{everyone}} has a great idea for a research study.

The goal of this <b>brief</b> fact <b>sheet</b> is to provide guidance {{on how to get}} through this important first step in completing a research study. A well-written research question is very focused and specific. If you make the analogy that a research study is much like the human skeleton, you will understand the importance of linking all the parts together for a successful study. The research question is the “spine ” of the study since it supports the study design (arms) and methods (rib cage), which then directs the statistical methods (legs). If your research question (spine) is not well constructed, then the entire study (skeleton) collapses. Think of the review of the literature as the “head ” of the skeleton since it leads to the spine and must have a strong connection! A well-written research question contains the key variables, the relationship between the variables, and the population to be studied (Norwood, 2000; Polit & Beck, 2004).

40|$|Graduation date: 1976 This {{investigation}} {{was designed to}} determine the relationship of student teachers' commitment to the set of values, attitudes, and behaviors that are characteristically fostered and rewarded by bureaucratic organizations and their verbal classroom behavior under actual teaching conditions, The {{purpose of the study}} was expressed by the formulation of an experimental hypothesis and ten specific null hypotheses. The instrument used to measure the degree of bureaucratic orientation of student teachers was Gordon's (1973) Work Environment Preference Schedule (WEPS). The verbal classroom behavior of student teachers under actual teaching conditions was assessed by means of the Flanders' Interaction Analysis System (FIAS, 1960). In addition, a <b>brief</b> demographic data <b>sheet</b> was given to the sample to collect personal data about each subject such as age, sex, undergraduate gradepoint average, size of school, subject taught, and number of professional affiliations. The scores of the WEPS were analyzed and the student teachers were assigned to either the high or low group of bureaucratic orientation. These results were then used in combination with the ten dependent variables of the verbal interaction behavior delineated by the FIAS. The relationships were tested for significance at the. 05 level of confidence using Student's t-test. The findings of the study were: Under actual teaching conditions, there is no difference in the verbal classroom behavior of student teachers who profess to be unexposed to Flanders' Interaction Analysis System and who score high and low in bureaucratic orientation; this is also true of the verbal classroom behavior of their students. The verbal classroom behavior of student teachers, as measured by the FIAS, can not be predicted from bureaucratic orientation alone, as measured by the WEPS. It is recommended that supervisors of student teachers in teacher education programs employ the FIAS as a tool to aid the student teacher in the adjustment of his verbal classroom behavior. A follow-up study of the verbal and non-verbal classroom behavior of the subjects involved in this study who have become teachers is recommended. Additional recommendations for further research were offered in Chapter V of the study...|$|R
