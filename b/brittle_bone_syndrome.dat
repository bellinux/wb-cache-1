40|$|SUMMARY The use of x ray fibre {{diffraction}} {{to study}} the molecular architecture of healthy and diseased human tendon is described. The three dimensional structure of human (finger) tendon is derived to high resolution and is shown to be {{very similar to that}} reported for rat tail tendon. In particular the presence of the 38 A row line in the diffraction pattern suggests that a high degree of lateral order within the collagen fibrils is a more widespread feature of tendon tissue than was formerly realised. Axially projected electron density maps of the 670 A unit repeat of the collagen fibrils of this tissue, and of tendon tissue from three cases of osteogenesis imperfecta (01), are calculated and compared. The results are in agreement with recent biochemical studies in suggesting that type I (Sillence) 01 is principally a quantitative, rather than a qualitative, defect of type I collagen biosynthesis. The features by which a molecular lesion may be recognised and characterised from diffraction data are discussed. Key words: <b>brittle</b> <b>bone</b> <b>syndrome,</b> collagen, synchrotron.

40|$|Temporary <b>brittle</b> <b>bone</b> {{disease is}} a {{recently}} described phenotype of increased fracture susceptibility {{in the first year}} of life in which there are multiple unexplained fractures without evidence of other internal or external injury. Most child abuse experts do not accept the existence of temporary <b>brittle</b> <b>bone</b> disease and presume these cases are child abuse. The author reviewed 26 cases of infants with multiple unexplained fractures that fit the criteria of temporary <b>brittle</b> <b>bone</b> disease and studied nine of them with either computed tomography or radiographic bone density measurements. The results show a striking association between temporary <b>brittle</b> <b>bone</b> disease and decreased fetal movement, usually from intrauterine confinement, and low bone density measurements in eight of the nine infants. The association with decreased fetal movement and intrauterine confinement is in keeping with the mechanostat-mechanical load theory of bone formation. The author feels that temporary <b>brittle</b> <b>bone</b> {{disease is a}} real entity and that historical information related to decreased fetal movement or intrauterine confinement and the use of bone density measurements can be helpful in making this diagnosis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background There is {{no clear}} {{definition}} of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). The most widely used classification of OI divides the disease in four types, {{although it has been}} suggested that there may be at least 12 forms of OI. These forms have been named with numbers, eponyms or descriptive names. Some of these syndromes can actually be considered congenital forms of <b>brittle</b> <b>bones</b> resembling OI (SROI). Discussion A review of different <b>syndromes</b> with congenital <b>brittle</b> <b>bones</b> published in the literature is presented. Syndromes are classified in "OI" (those secondary to mutations in the type I pro-collagen genes), and "syndromes resembling OI" (those secondary to mutations other that the type I pro-collagen genes, identified or not). A definition for OI is proposed as a <b>syndrome</b> of congenital <b>brittle</b> <b>bones</b> secondary to mutations in the genes codifying for pro-collagen genes (COL 1 A 1 and COL 1 A 2). Summary A debate about the definition of OI and a possible clinical and prognostic classification are warranted. </p...|$|R

One controversial postulated cause is temporary <b>brittle</b> <b>bone</b> disease, first described in 1990. Methods: Eighty-five patients with fractures showing clinical and radiological features of temporary <b>brittle</b> <b>bone</b> disease were the subject of judicial hearings {{to determine whether it}} was appropriate for them to return home. Sixty-three patients did, and follow-up information was available for 61 of these. The mean follow-up period was 6. 9 years (range 1 &ndash; 17, median 6). Results: We found that none of the children had sustained any further injuries that were thought to represent nonaccidental injury; no child was re-removed from home. Three children had fractures. In each case there was general agreement that the fractures were accidental. Had the original fractures in these children been the result of nonaccidental injury, it would have been severe and repeated; the average number of fractures was 9. 1. Conclusion: The fact that no subsequent suspicious injuries took place after return home is consistent with the view that the fractures were unlikely to have been caused by nonaccidental injury, and that temporary <b>brittle</b> <b>bone</b> disease is a distinctive and identifiable disorder.

30|$|The {{atypical}} fractures {{are thought}} to be due to abnormally <b>brittle</b> <b>bone.</b> <b>Brittle</b> <b>bone</b> is thought to be susceptible to fracture because of high tensile forces on the lateral femoral cortex affecting the lateral aspect of the femoral shaft. This theory is supported by biomechanical analysis and the distribution of the atypical fractures along the femoral shaft, which correlates with the angulation of the femur against the tibia; higher angulation results in a more caudal position of the fracture along the femoral shaft [10, 28]. The cortical medial bone spike that may be seen in atypical femoral fractures is a focal bone response to the developing fracture. It is very focal and dense; a periosteal reaction is not typically seen.|$|R
40|$|Background: Hungry <b>bone</b> <b>syndrome</b> is {{a common}} {{complication}} of surgery for primary hyperparathyroidism in India which often leads to prolonged hospitalization. There are varying reports on the use and efficacy of bisphosphonates {{in the prevention of}} hungry <b>bone</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the effect of preoperative bisphosphonate therapy on rates of hungry <b>bone</b> <b>syndrome</b> in our patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. A total of 19 patients underwent surgery for primary hyperparathyroidism at our institute between January 2013 and June 2015 among whom eight did not receive preoperative bisphosphonates and 11 received intravenous zoledronic acid 4 mg, 24 – 48 h preoperatively. Results: There {{was no significant difference between}} the two groups with respect to age, gender, duration of symptoms, preoperative serum calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, alkaline phosphatase, and the presence of radiological evidence of hyperparathyroid bone disease also did not differ between the groups. Three out of the eight patients who did not receive preoperative zoledronic acid therapy had hungry <b>bone</b> <b>syndrome</b> but none in the zoledronic acid group. The prevalence of hungry <b>bone</b> <b>syndrome</b> tended to be lower in the zoledronic acid group (P = 0. 058). The need for intravenous calcium and duration of postoperative hospital stay were significantly lesser in the zoledronic acid group. Conclusion: Preoperative intravenous zoledronic acid significantly reduces the need for intravenous calcium therapy and duration of postoperative hospital stay and seems a promising option to reduce the rate of hungry <b>bone</b> <b>syndrome</b> in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism...|$|R
