500|$|Spears' {{cover of}} [...] "My Prerogative" [...] is musically {{different}} {{from its original}} version, with the bass and new jack swing sound replaced with a synthpop sound, synthesizers and elements typical of Bloodshy & Avant productions. It was noted by Christy Lemire of msnbc.com that the cover also contains elements of Bollywood music. At {{the beginning of the}} song, Spears says in a breathy voice the lines [...] "People can take everything away from you / But they can never take away your truth / <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is,</b> can you handle mine?". The rest of the lyrics do not deviate much from the original version, instead they are changed to fit a woman's perspective. Jennifer Vineyard of MTV commented the cover could be interpreted as a statement on Spears's life and the media reaction to some of her decisions at the time, including her engagement to American dancer Kevin Federline.|$|E
500|$|Early legal {{precedents}} {{striking down}} State laws that conflicted with federally negotiated international treaties {{arose from the}} peace treaty with Britain, but subsequent treaties were found to trump city ordinances, state laws on escheat of land owned by foreigners and, in the 20th Century, state laws regarding tort claims. [...] Subsequently, in a case involving a treaty concluded with the Cherokee Indians, the Supreme Court declared [...] "It need hardly be said that a treaty cannot change the Constitution or be held valid if it be in violation of that instrument. This results from the nature and fundamental principles of our government. The effect of treaties and acts of Congress, when in conflict, is not settled by the Constitution. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> not involved in any doubt as to its proper solution.

500|$|Ballo {{committed}} suicide, {{hours after}} hearing {{the results of the}} personality test conducted by Scientology. She jumped from the fourth floor of her dorm room in Nice, France, two hours after getting the results of the test. She left behind a note, along with the results of the Scientology personality test. The results of the personality test were found among her belongings by her family. In April 2008, Aftenposten noted that the French police were investigating connections between Scientology and Ballo's death. The investigation was being headed by a judge in France. In April 2008 the French police interviewed two leaders of Scientology in France. Prosecutor Eric de Montgolfier opened an investigation into the incident in France, in April 2008. A French investigating prosecutor told Dagbladet, [...] "We are almost convinced that it is a suicide. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> whether something encouraged her to this." [...] Prosecutors stated in December 2008 that they could not determine a direct link between the Scientology personality test and Ballo's death.|$|E

He stated that it {{is in the interest of}} Americans to remain in Iraq and be involved in the [...] "Middle East issue" [...] because if not, America is [...] "going to end up with a major war". Later in the interview when Gilmore was asked if he believed Attorney General Alberto Gonzales was credible, he stated, [...] "No, I donâ€™t think he is particularly credible". On May 27, Gilmore {{appeared on}} ABC's This Week and continued the strategy of attacking his opponents in the race for president. On the show, he criticized the credentials of former Senator and potential candidate Fred Thompson of Tennessee. He reminded the audience that Thompson is [...] "a one-term senator" [...] and that [...] "he's well known because of his Law & Order appearance. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is,</b> is there a solid, consistent record there of supporting conservative principles?" ...|$|E
