40|$|As U.

For example, it is thought that atmospheric turbulence effects are often much less severe over water than over land. Another important aspect of the overwater flight problems is the penetration of the sonic <b>boom</b> <b>noise</b> into the ocean, where there could be an environmental impact on sea life. This talk will present a brief review on the penetration of sonic <b>boom</b> <b>noise</b> into a large body of water with a flat surface. It has been determined recently that faster supersonic speeds imply greater penetration of sonic <b>boom</b> <b>noise</b> into the ocean. The new theory is derived from the original Sawyers paper and from the knowledge that for level flight a boom's duration is proportional to the quantity M/(M(exp 2) - 1) (exp 3 / 8) where M is the Mach number. It is found that for depths of 10 m or less, the peak SPL varies less than 6 dB over a wide range of M. For greater depths, 100 m for example, increased Mach numbers may increase the SPL by 15 dB or more...|$|R

60|$|Then an {{elephant}} trumpeted, {{and they all}} took it up for five or ten terrible seconds. The dew from the trees above spattered down like rain on the unseen backs, and a dull <b>booming</b> <b>noise</b> began, not very loud at first, and Little Toomai could not tell what it was. But it grew and grew, and Kala Nag lifted up one forefoot and then the other, and brought them down on the ground--one-two, one-two, as steadily as trip-hammers. The elephants were stamping all together now, and {{it sounded like a}} war drum beaten at the mouth of a cave. The dew fell from the trees till there was no more left to fall, and the booming went on, and the ground rocked and shivered, and Little Toomai put his hands up to his ears to shut out the sound. But it was all one gigantic jar that ran through him--this stamp of hundreds of heavy feet on the raw earth. Once or twice he could feel Kala Nag and all the others surge forward a few strides, and the thumping would change to the crushing sound of juicy green things being bruised, but in a minute or two the boom of feet on hard earth began again. A tree was creaking and groaning somewhere near him. He put out his arm and felt the bark, but Kala Nag moved forward, still tramping, and he could not tell where he was in the clearing. There was no sound from the elephants, except once, when two or three little calves squeaked together. Then he heard a thump and a shuffle, and the booming went on. It must have lasted fully two hours, and Little Toomai ached in every nerve, but he knew by the smell of the night air that the dawn was coming.|$|E
40|$|Reducing {{the very}} {{annoying}} <b>boom</b> <b>noise</b> which is heard inside the cabin of a moving vehicle is the motivation {{and the subject}} of this research thesis. The attraction of a vehicle to a potential consumer is significantly influenced by its interior noise characteristics. Thus the prediction of vehicle interior noise is a significant challenge for vehicle manufacturers at the early concept design phase. Vehicular interior noise mainly stems from structural vibration such as the power train, driveline vibration or wheel vibration which is induced by road roughness. Among numerous vehicular noise problems, structural-borne <b>noise</b> such as <b>boom</b> <b>noise</b> is considered to have the most annoying acoustic features. The <b>boom</b> <b>noise</b> influences the acoustic quality, and thus the customer&rsquo;s perception of the car for the value and quality. The <b>boom</b> <b>noise</b> generated from structural vibration is mainly due to the strong modal coupling between the flexible structure and the acoustic cavity. Therefore, studying the vibro-acoustic coupling characteristics &ndash; the subject of this research &ndash; is important for car manufacturers. In this research, the first step was to perform experimental modal analysis to identify the plate-cavity resonance problem. Following this, the Finite Element Method (ANSYS) was applied to simulate the plate and cavity system and the simulation results were compared with experimental results; these new results have formed the basis for later analytical formulations and assumptions. Secondly, the deterministic method, based on an Impedance Mobility Compact Matrix, was implemented in the analytical solution to calculate the sound pressure level inside the acoustic cavity and the flexible plate vibration velocity. The analytical results were verified by the results of the VAOne vibro-acoustic simulation model and experimental results. A statistical energy analysis (SEA) was then applied to simulate the plate and cavity system. All SEA parameters were calibrated with analytical formulae and the coupling quotient calculated. The coupling quotient indicated the coupling strength of the plate-cavity system in the mid-high frequency ranges. Then the two methods were combined. The use of the combined method produced results which explained how the air cavity and the flexible structure were coupled in the low-mid frequency ranges. The acoustic pressure calculated by the Impedance Mobility method was used to predict the mean energies of the flexible plate and the cavity. The predicted mean energy curves were verified by the SEA simulation results using the AutoSEA software and experimental data from speaker-microphone experiments. The results from the combined methods have revealed that the coupling between the structure and the acoustic cavity depends on the plate thickness and the cavity size. This study provides a better insight into the coupling strength of the plate structure and the cavity. It is this insight which can be used to understand and solve the <b>boom</b> <b>noise</b> problem. The effect of interior trim materials on the sound quality of the plate-cavity system was also investigated. The sound pressure results calculated by the impedance mobility method were used to calculate the psychoacoustic metrics using the psychoacoustic analysis method. Experiments were carried out on a simply supported aluminium plate which covered an open ended square box, and the box was excited by a shaker. A good agreement between the analytical and experimental results was obtained, and the proposed model was validated and confirmed for feasibility. The results indicated that the interior trim has an influence on the distribution of the sound loudness and sharpness inside the cavity in the middle and high frequency ranges. Finally, the application of the hybrid deterministic-SEA method to predict the sound pressure level and mean energy level responses of the stiffened plate-cavity system was demonstrated. The mean square sound pressure inside the acoustic cavity for nine observation points was averaged and used as an input to calculate the cavity mean energy. A good agreement between analytical and experimental results was obtained, and the proposed method was validated and confirmed for feasibility. The results of the proposed method were also validated by practical engineering applications. It was found that there was a strong coupling between the stiffened bare plate and cavity. This can be demonstrated by the first resonant frequency peak overlap of the stiffened plate and the acoustic cavity. The strength of coupling was found to be reduced by adding the stiffener onto the plate, or increasing the thickness of the plate. A strong coupling of the plate and cavity would induce a high level of <b>boom</b> <b>noise.</b> Overall, the results of this research have shed new insights onto the <b>boom</b> <b>noise</b> and its solution which helps to eliminate this most annoying noise phenomenon. Much more research, however, still needs to be undertaken in order to fully resolve this noise issue...|$|R

6000|$|We have as yet spoken {{only of the}} voice, but {{the males}} of various birds practise, during their courtship, what may be called {{instrumental}} music. Peacocks and Birds of Paradise rattle their quills together. Turkey-cocks scrape their wings against the ground, and some kinds of grouse thus produce a buzzing sound. Another North American grouse, the Tetrao umbellus, when with his tail erect, his ruffs displayed, [...] "he shows off his finery to the females, who lie hid in the neighbourhood," [...] drums by rapidly striking his wings together above his back, according to Mr. R. Haymond, and not, as Audubon thought, by striking them against his sides. The sound thus produced is compared by some to distant thunder, and by others to the quick roll of a drum. The female never drums, [...] "but flies directly {{to the place where}} the male is thus engaged." [...] The male of the Kalij-pheasant, in the Himalayas, often makes a singular drumming noise with his wings, not unlike the sound produced by shaking a stiff piece of cloth." [...] On the west coast of Africa the little black-weavers (Ploceus?) congregate in a small party on the bushes round a small open space, and sing and glide through the air with quivering wings, [...] "which make a rapid whirring sound like a child's rattle." [...] One bird after another thus performs for hours together, but only during the courting-season. At this season, and at no other time, the males of certain night-jars (Caprimulgus) make a strange <b>booming</b> <b>noise</b> with their wings. The various species of woodpeckers strike a sonorous branch with their beaks, with so rapid a vibratory movement that [...] "the head appears to be in two places at once." [...] The sound thus produced is audible at a considerable distance but cannot be described; and I feel sure that its source would never be conjectured by any one hearing it for the first time. As this jarring sound is made chiefly during the breeding-season, it has been considered as a love-song; but it is perhaps more strictly a love- call. The female, when driven from her nest, has been observed thus to call her mate, who answered in the same manner and soon appeared. Lastly, the male hoopoe (Upupa epops) combines vocal and instrumental music; for during the breeding-season this bird, as Mr. Swinhoe observed, first draws in air, and then taps the end of its beak perpendicularly down against a stone or the trunk of a tree, [...] "when the breath being forced down the tubular bill produces the correct sound." [...] If the beak is not thus struck against some object, the sound is quite different. Air {{is at the same time}} swallowed, and the oesophagus thus becomes much swollen; and this probably acts as a resonator, not only with the hoopoe, but with pigeons and other birds. (52.

5000|$|Corvettes {{have a very}} {{characteristic}} and noticeable exhaust noise, as {{has been}} mentioned earlier in the Design section. Due to the low and shallow angle of the exhaust pipe from the turbocharger plus very limited space, conventional marine silencers are not used on Corvettes, despite attempts by the latest company.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{research}} is to determine the impact by sonic <b>boom</b> <b>noise</b> penetration into the ocean. Since the 1994 LaRC High Speed Research Program Sonic Boom Workshop several new results have been obtained. This talk reviews these results, and emphasizes the two most important findings. The first major result is an improved understanding of the noise spectra of the penetrating sonic boom. It was determined that weighted sound exposure levels decrease with deeper ocean depths significantly faster than unweighted sound exposure levels. This is because low frequencies penetrate the ocean deeper than high frequencies. Several noise metrics were used including peak, SEL, C-SEL, A-SEL, and PLdB, and results are given for all. These results are important because they show that the sonic <b>boom</b> <b>noise</b> impact on marine life a few meters below the ocean surface may be significantly lower using weighted sound levels than if one were to measure the impact using unweighted levels. The other major finding is the first estimate of the worst case peak levels produced by a penetrating sonic boom being focused by a sinusoidal ocean surface. The method of analysis chosen was computational, a time domain finite difference algorithm. The method is outlined and then example results are presented. For rounded sonic boom waveforms incident on a sinusoidal ocean surface, it is shown that the percentage increase or decrease in pressure is only occasionally larger than 10 %, rarely 25 %. These fluctuations indicate, under the assumptions already given, that any increase or decrease in sound level underwater due to focusing or defocusing should be small, less than 3 dB...|$|R

Males display at regularly used sites, each male utilizing several dispersed leks or display areas. These displays usually {{take place in the}} mornings and evenings. The courtship displays of the males are impressive and elaborate, successfully advertising their presence to potential mates. The males hold their heads backwards, with cheeks bulging, the crest is held erect, the bill open and they inflate their gular pouches, forming a white throat [...] "balloon". During this display the oesophagus inflates to as much as four times its normal size and resembles a balloon. They also puff out their frontal neck feathers which are splayed upwards showing their white underside. The white may be visible up to 1 km away during display. Their wings are drooped and their tails are raised upwards and forwards onto their backs like a turkey, the retrices being held vertically and their undertail coverts fluffed out. They enhance their performance with an exaggerated bouncing gait. When displaying they stride about with their necks puffed out, their tail fanned and their wings planed and pointed downward. They also emit a low-pitched <b>booming</b> <b>noise</b> when the neck is at maximum inflation and snap their bills open and shut. Several males dispersed over a wide area gather to display but usually one is dominant and the others do not display in his presence and move away. The displaying males are visited by the females who presumably select the male with the most impressive display. Occasionally fights between males can be serious during the mating season when display areas are being contested, with the two competitors smashing into each other's bodies and stabbing each other with their bills. They may stand chest-to-chest, tails erect, bills locked and 'push' one another for up to 30 minutes.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. Vehicle Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH) {{is now a}} more {{important}} component of the vehicle design process than ever. Road noise {{is one of the key}} criteria used by potential buyers (albeit subconsciously) to choose what they perceive as the best vehicle. Road rumble is a key concern for vehicle manufacturers. Light Utility Vehicles (LUVs) are especially sensitive to a low frequency <b>booming</b> <b>noise</b> due to the fundamental acoustic mode that exists in the vehicle cabin. An investigation into this <b>booming</b> <b>noise</b> in an LUV is documented. The noise is identified and quantified after which the source of the noise in the vehicle cabin is identified using NVH techniques such as Acoustic Modal Analysis (AMA), Experimental Modal Analysis (EMA) and Transfer Path Analysis (TPA). The cabin’s fundamental acoustic mode lay at 100 Hz. Finally the source of the vibrations in the vehicle leading to the <b>booming</b> <b>noise</b> in the cabin is identified, along with its transfer path to the cabin.

Potential industrial applications of the system vibro-acoustic analysis would be in acoustic modelling of vehicle body panels such as the cabin roof panel, and door panels for the <b>boom</b> <b>noise</b> analysis. A new deterministic-statistical analysis approach is proposed from a combination or hybrid of deterministic analysis and statistical energy analysis (SEA) approaches. General theory of the new deterministic-statistical analysis approach is introduced. The main advantage of the new deterministic-statistical analysis approach is its possibility in place of the time consuming Monte Carlo simulation. In order to illustrate and validate the new deterministic-statistical analysis approach, three approaches of the deterministic analysis, the statistical energy analysis and the new deterministicstatistical analysis are then applied to conduct the plate-acoustic system modelling, and their results will be compared. The vibro-acoustic energy coupling characteristic of the plate-acoustic system will be studied. The most suitable frequency range for the new approach will be identified in consideration of computational accuracy, information and speed...|$|R
40|$|Sonic boom {{wave form}} {{parameters}} {{as related to}} loudness were investigated analytically. The parameters studied include rise time, duration, maximum overpressure and initial overpressure. The design criteria of a 72 dBA for corridors and 65 dBA for unconstrained flight were chosen based on a review of human response testing. The 72 dBA criterion suggests that 1. 0 psf shock waves may be acceptable. On that basis, acceptable low sonic boom wave forms were explored with respect to cruise conditions, aerodynamic lifting length requirements and configuration design at M 1. 5 and M 2. 4. An M 2. 4 baseline arrow wing configuration was studied as a possible vehicle for M 1. 5 cruise overland. Modifications made to approach the low boom wave form included a slightly longer forebody, staggered nacelles, a lifting arrow wing horizontal tail, and carefully tailored lift and volume elements. The same wave form criteria applied for M 2. 4 cruise results in a low boom configuration that has significant weight, length and balance penalties. Further detailed design work is required to reach the target wave form and resultant loudness level for overland cruise at M 1. 5. These results so far suggest that a properly designed M 2. 4 overwater configuration may be capable of M 1. 5 overland operation with sonic <b>boom</b> <b>noise</b> characteristcs that meet the criterion...|$|R
