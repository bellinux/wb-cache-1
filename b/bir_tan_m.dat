First, sectoral level environmental efficiency indexes for the Kyoto countries are computed by using a hyperbolic measure of technical efficiency in a non-parametric piece-wise linear technology. Second, {{the role of the}} Kyoto Protocol on environmental efficiency is empirically examined. The results showed that, sectoral level environmental efficiency is significantly improved, especially in dirty sectors, during the years following the Kyoto Protocol’s entry into force. by Betim Melis <b>Tan.</b> <b>M.</b> S...|$|R

50|$|The Greninger chart is {{a simple}} {{trigonometric}} tool to determine g and d for a fixed sample-to-film distance. (If one uses a 2-d detector the problem of determining g and d could be solved mathematically using the equations which generate the Greninger chart) A new chart must be generated for different sample to detector distances. (2s is 2q for the diffraction peak and <b>tan</b> <b>m</b> is x/y for the Cartesian coordinates of the diffraction peak.) The Greninger chart gives directly the two angles needed to plot poles on the Wulff net. It is critical {{to keep track of}} the relative arrangement of the sample to the film, if photographic film is used then this is achieved by cutting the corner of the film. For Polaroid film one must make a note of the arrangement of the face of the film in the camera.|$|R

40|$|From the τ-lepton {{analysis}} of the charged Higgs decay of the top quark at the Tevatron, t → H + b → τ + ντ b, {{it is possible to}} set rather stringent bounds on the (<b>tan</b> β, <b>M</b> H ±) -plane, if one assumes that H ± is a charged member of a generic two-Higgs-doublet model. However, if we consider the possibility that H ± is supersymmetric, then we find that the allowed region in the (<b>tan</b> β, <b>M</b> H ±) -plane can be significantly modified by the MSSM quantum corrections. Throughout our analysis we correlate the top quark results with the limits imposed by radiative and semileptonic B-meson decays. Remarkably, one can envision situations in the MSSM parameter space where H ± completely eludes those bounds, i. e. a charged Higgs with a mass below the top quark mass could coexist with essentially any value of tan β. The Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) [1] is a most tantalizing candidate to extend the quantum field theoretical structure of the Standard Model (SM) of the strong and electroweak interactions while keeping all the necessary ingredients insuring internal consistency, such as gauge invariance and renormalizability. Furthermore, supersymmetri...|$|R
