25|$|The 1940 manning of the ouvrage {{under the}} command of Captain <b>Broché</b> {{comprised}} 161 men and 2 officers of the 156th Fortress Infantry Regiment. The units were under the umbrella of both the 3rd and 4th Armies, Army Group 2. The Casernement de Zimming provided peacetime above-ground barracks and support services to Kerfent and other positions in the area.|$|E
500|$|On 27 July 1890, aged 37, Van Gogh {{shot himself}} in the chest with a 7mm Lefaucheux à <b>broche</b> revolver. There were no {{witnesses}} and he died 30 hours after the incident. The shooting may have taken place in the wheat field in which he had been painting, or a local barn. The bullet was deflected by a rib and passed through his chest without doing apparent damage to internal organs – probably stopped by his spine. He was able to walk back to the Auberge Ravoux, where he was attended to by two doctors, but without a surgeon present the bullet could not be removed. The doctors tended to him as best they could, then left him alone in his room, smoking his pipe. The following morning Theo rushed to his brother's side, finding him in good spirits. But within hours Vincent began to fail, suffering from an untreated infection resulting from the wound. He died {{in the early hours of}} 29 July. According to Theo, Vincent's last words were: [...] "The sadness will last forever".|$|E

[...] As Mrs. Girder here entered, and joined her mother's exclamations, {{screaming}} into one ear while the old lady deafened the other, they succeeded in so utterly confounding the unhappy urchin, that he could not for some time tell his story at all, and it was only when the elder boy returned that the truth began to dawn on their minds.|$|E

"Cauld be my cast," [...] thought he, [...] "if either Bide-the-Bent or Girder {{taste that}} broach of wild-fowl this evening"; and then {{addressing}} the eldest turnspit, {{a boy of}} about eleven years old, and putting a penny into his hand, he said, [...] "Here is twal pennies, my man; carry that ower to Mrs. Sma'trash, and bid her fill my mill wi' snishing, and I'll turn the <b>broche</b> for ye in the mean time; and she will gie ye a ginge-bread snap for your pains." ...|$|E

But sakes alive! it's time I tidied myself a little," [...] she continued, lifting one hand to her hair, while with the other she {{endeavored}} to fasten a buttonless collar; [...] "leavin' alone the vanities o' dress, it's ez much as one {{can do to keep}} a clean rag on with the children climbin' over ye. Sit by, and I'll be back in a minit." [...] She retired to the back room, and in a few moments returned with smoothed hair and a palm-leaf <b>broche</b> shawl thrown over her shoulders, which not only concealed the ravages made by time and maternity on the gown beneath, but to some extent gave her the suggestion of being a casual visitor in her own household. It must be confessed that {{for the rest of the}} evening Sister Hiler rather lent herself to this idea, possibly from the fact that it temporarily obliterated the children, and quite removed her from any responsibility in the unpicturesque household. This effect was only marred by the absence of any impression upon Gideon, who scarcely appeared to notice the change, and whose soft eyes seemed rather to identify the miserable woman under her forced disguise. He prefaced the meal with a fervent grace, to which the widow listened with something of the conscious attitude she had adopted at church during her late husband's ministration, and during the meal she ate with a like consciousness of [...] "company manners." ...|$|E
