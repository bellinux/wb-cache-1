In the used car market, BA Falcons tend to suffer from poor depreciation rates, due to influxes of ex-fleet models entering the second-hand market {{and because of the}} cost of fuel.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{priorities}} of the regeneration was {{the restoration of the}} dock system, which had deteriorated rapidly since the Brunswick Dock gates had been left open. Contaminated silt was removed from the dock basin, dock gates were replaced & bridges restored, whilst the dock walls were repaired. The Albert Dock company appointed Tarmac to renovate the dock's vast warehouses and repair war time bomb damage. Structural surveys carried out by the MDC found the brickwork and foundations to be in very good condition and it was considered a testament to the strict <b>build</b> <b>quality</b> of Hartley's design that a building almost 150 years old was still in such good condition.|$|E
5|$|The LS 400 {{was praised}} for its quietness, {{well-appointed}} and ergonomic interior, engine performance, <b>build</b> <b>quality,</b> aerodynamics, fuel economy and value. However, it was criticized by some automobile columnists for derivative styling and a suspension regarded as too compromising of handling for ride comfort. In some markets it was priced against mid-size, six-cylinder Mercedes-Benz and BMW models. It was rated by Car and Driver magazine as {{better than the}} higher-priced Mercedes-Benz 420 SEL and BMW 735i in terms of ride, handling and performance. The LS 400 also won motoring awards from automotive publications including Automobile Magazine and Wheels Magazine. Lexus quickly established customer loyalty and its debut was generally regarded {{as a shock to}} existing luxury marques. BMW's and Mercedes-Benz's U.S. sales figures dropped 29 percent and 19 percent, respectively, with BMW executives accusing Lexus of dumping in that market, while 35 percent of Lexus buyers traded in a Lincoln or Cadillac.|$|E

50|$|Within {{all these}} cases {{there was only}} one song and one type of {{movement}} available, but this mechanism (closely modelled on the Bontems pattern) was offered in three <b>build</b> <b>qualities</b> which were first introduced between 1922 and 1925. According to a list price of 1930 it was available in: 1 Finely finished and polished with steel springs. 2 Solid finish, unpolished, with brass springs. 3 Lightly made an unpolished (special construction). There was no audible difference between these three versions, so most of Griesbaum boxes were fitted with the cheapest movement.|$|R

The proposed algorithm considers the trade-off between the predicted environment information gain available from a sensing viewpoint and the ma-nipulator joint angle changes required to position a sensor at that viewpoint, and then obtains collision-free paths through safe, previously explored regions. Information gathered from multiple viewpoints is fused to achieve a detailed 3 D map.

During normal crush-to-failure tests done by automakers to evaluate body rigidity, the Aurora's unibody construction broke GM's testing machine. A frame-crusher otherwise used to test stronger truck frames had to be used instead, with the car exceeding federal standards for passenger cars by two times.|$|E

40|$|A stereo-based dense {{disparity}} estimation {{algorithm is}} proposed to <b>build</b> high <b>quality</b> dense disparity map of lunar surface under special illumination, weak texture and occlusion condition.

Mean-Shift segmentation algorithm and adaptive threshold optimization are utilized to improve the precision of initial dense disparity map of weak and high similarity texture region in stereo images. Experimental results of the images of standard test library and the stereo images of simulated lunar surface validate that our algorithm is robust to <b>build</b> high <b>quality</b> stereo dense disparity map for Lunar surface...|$|R

25|$|However most railway historians now {{regard it}} as a costly failure and a missed opportunity; {{an attempt was made}} to simply update the {{railways}} as they already stood rather than reacting to changes in the way goods and people were travelling in the post-war years.

25|$|During {{the life}} of the XY model, the uniquely Australian uprated 200, 250-1V and 250-2V {{variants}} of the seven-main-bearing six cylinder were introduced. Cleveland V8s were imported initially, until the Geelong Foundry began to produce these motors for automatic Falcons in mid-1972. The transmissions included both Ford and Borg-Warner, as did rear axles. The XY is now widely regarded as the best Falcon made in Australia, not just with its Bathurst dominance, but also in its performance, <b>build</b> <b>quality,</b> and refinement, which was superior to competitors at the time. Current values for XYs compared to other Aussie Falcons, and their competitors, attest to this.|$|E
