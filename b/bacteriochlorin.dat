Tetrapyrroles (e. g. porphyrins, chlorins, <b>bacteriochlorins)</b> are a class of photosensitizers that exhibit promising characteristics to serve as broad-spectrum antimicrobials. In order to bind to and efficiently penetrate into all classes of microbial cells, tetrapyrroles should have structures that contain (i) one or more cationic charge(s) or (ii) a basic group. In this report, we investigate the use of new stable synthetic <b>bacteriochlorins</b> that have a strong absorption band in the range 720 to 740 nm, {{which is in the}} near-infrared spectral region. Four <b>bacteriochlorins</b> with 2, 4, or 6 quaternized ammonium groups or 2 basic amine groups were compared for light-mediated killing against a gram-positive bacterium (Staphylococcus aureus), a gram-negative bacterium (Escherichia coli), and a dimorphic fungal yeast (Candida albicans). Selectivity was assessed by determining phototoxicity against human HeLa cancer cells under the same conditions. All four compounds were highly active (6 logs of killing at 1 microM or less) against S. aureus and showed selectivity for bacteria over human cells. Increasing the cationic charge increased activity against E. coli. Only the compound with basic groups was highly active against C. albicans. Supporting photochemical and theoretical characterization studies indicate that (i) the four <b>bacteriochlorins</b> have comparable photophysical features in homogeneous solution and (ii) the anticipated redox characteristics do not correlate with cell-killing ability. These results support the interpretation that the disparate biological activities observed stem from cellular binding and localization effects rather than intrinsic electronic properties.

This protein presents unique opportunities for studying biological electron transfer, as Zn-containing chlorins can exist in 4 -, 5 -, and (theoretically) 6 -coordinate states within the RC. In this paper, the electron transfer perturbations attributed exclusively to coordination state effects are separated from those attributed to the presence, absence, or type of metal in the <b>bacteriochlorin</b> at the HA pocket of the RC. The presence of a 4 -coordinate Zn 2 + ion in the HA <b>bacteriochlorin</b> instead of BPhe results in a small decrease in the rates of the P*→P+HA−→P+QA− electron transfer, and the charge separation yield is not greatly perturbed; however coordination of the Zn 2 + by a fifth ligand provided by a histidine residue results in a larger rate decrease and yield loss. We also report the first crystal structure of a Zn-BChl-containing RC, confirming that the HA Zn-BChl was either 4 - or 5 -coordinate in {{the two types of}} Zn-BChl-containing RCs studied here.

40|$|Abstract: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) was {{discovered}} more than 100 years ago, {{and has since}} become a well-studied therapy for cancer and various non-malignant diseases including infections. PDT uses photosensitizers (PSs, non-toxic dyes) that are activated by absorption of visible light to initially form the excited singlet state, followed by transition to the long-lived excited triplet state. This triplet state can undergo photochemical reactions {{in the presence of}} oxygen to form reactive oxygen species (including singlet oxygen) that can destroy cancer cells, pathogenic microbes and unwanted tissue. The dual-specificity of PDT relies on accumulation of the PS in diseased tissue and also on localized light delivery. Tetrapyrrole structures such as porphyrins, chlorins, <b>bacteriochlorins</b> and phthalocyanines with appropriate functionalization have been widely investigated in PDT, and several compounds have received clinical approval. Other molecular structures including the synthetic dyes classes as phenothiazinium, squaraine and BODIPY (boron-dipyrromethene), transition metal complexes, and natural products such as hypericin, riboflavin and curcumin have been investigated. Targeted PDT uses PSs conjugated to antibodies, peptides, proteins and other ligands with specific cellular receptors. Nanotechnology has made a significant contribution to PDT, giving rise to approaches such as nanoparticle delivery, fullerene-based PSs, titania photocatalysis, and the use of upconverting nanoparticles to increase light penetration into tissue. Future directions include photochemical internalization, genetically encoded protein PSs, theranostics, two-photon absorption PDT, and sonodynamic therapy using ultrasound...|$|R
40|$|The {{aromatic}} pathways of free-base porphins, chlorins and <b>bacteriochlorins</b> {{have been}} studied by calculating the nuclear magnetic shieldings at selected points outside the molecules. The strengths of the induced ring currents for a given magnetic Ðeld have been obtained by using the aromatic ring current shieldings (ARCS) method. We found that pyrrolic rings with an inner hydrogen have a local ring current of the same magnitude as the ring current for the pyrrole molecule. The local ring current for pyrrolic rings without an inner hydrogen is between half and one fourth of the pyrrole value depending on the porphyrin. The C H units of 2 2 the pyrrolic rings in free-base porphin have recently been suggested to function as exocyclic bridges, but the present study indicates {{that this is not}} the case. The suggested 18 p-[16]annulene inner cross aromatic pathway does not exist until all pyrrolic rings are saturated in the b-positions. Free-base trans-porphin was found to have the largest ring-current susceptibility among the molecules studied. Porphyrins for which the aromatic pathway has to pass the nitrogen of a pyrrolic unit with an inner hydrogen have signiÐcantly smaller ring currents than free-base trans-porphin. We also show that the 1 H NMR shielding of the inner hydrogens is a sensitive measure of the strength of the ring current for the studied molecules...|$|R
