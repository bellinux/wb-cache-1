5|$|Prior to the 1990s the {{function}} of the cerebellum was almost universally believed to be purely motor-related, but newer findings have <b>brought</b> <b>that</b> view into question. Functional imaging studies have shown cerebellar activation in relation to language, attention, and mental imagery; correlation studies have shown interactions between the cerebellum and non-motor areas of the cerebral cortex; and a variety of non-motor symptoms have been recognized in people with damage that appears to be confined to the cerebellum. In particular, the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome or Schmahmann's syndrome has been described in adults and children. Estimates based on functional mapping of the cerebellum using functional MRI suggest {{that more than half of}} the cerebellar cortex is interconnected with association zones of the cerebral cortex.|$|E
5|$|This growth would {{continue}} due to transportation {{improvements in the}} 1820s. Troy's businessmen had already built a turnpike to Schenectady, the path followed today by Route 2 from Troy to Colonie. These trade routes were enhanced by the Erie and Champlain canals, which opened new markets {{to the north and}} west, while the Troy Steamboat Company's debut did likewise for the south. The access to iron ore mines in the Adirondack Mountains also got some local businessmen into iron refining. In 1835 the Rensselaer and Saratoga Railroad <b>brought</b> <b>that</b> technology to the city, and in 1842 the completion of the Schenectady and Troy Railroad linked Troy to the vast network that reached as far west as Buffalo.|$|E

5|$|On the way home, Peter and Brian argue until Brian {{gets out}} of the car. A police officer gives Brian a ticket, for which Peter has to pay $10, for violating the local leash law, which only widens the rift between Peter and Brian. Another {{argument}} ensues and Peter mentions that he found Brian on the road as a stray dog. Angry that Peter <b>brought</b> <b>that</b> up and becoming more angry when Peter then demands that Brian stop being a bad dog, Brian leaves the house, whereupon he is treated cruelly by the community, and is (ultimately) forced to sleep at the bus shelter. Peter buys a new cat which turns out to be mischievous and abusive; the family gets rid of it and searches for Brian. By the time Peter decides to apologize to Brian, Brian has been kicked out of a restaurant and a public store and chased by the police when he was found drinking from a water fountain. Brian becomes homeless, having actually attacked a man on the street for treating him as a drunken hobo and for not believing that he was not a good dog but a crazy animal. He is subsequently taken away by the police.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} {{electric}} potential is {{closely linked to}} that of the electric field. A small charge placed within an electric field experiences a force, and to have <b>brought</b> <b>that</b> charge to that point against the force requires work. The electric potential at any point is defined as the energy required to bring a unit test charge from an infinite distance slowly to that point. It is usually measured in volts, and one volt is the potential for which one joule of work must be expended to bring a charge of one coulomb from infinity. This definition of potential, while formal, has little practical application, and a more useful concept is that of electric potential difference, and is the energy required to move a unit charge between two specified points. An electric field has the special property that it is conservative, which means that the path taken by the test charge is irrelevant: all paths between two specified points expend the same energy, and thus a unique value for potential difference may be stated. The volt is so strongly identified as the unit of choice for measurement and description of electric potential difference that the term voltage sees greater everyday usage.|$|E

25|$|The British regained {{control in}} 1749 through the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle.

25|$|In late 1883, Daimler and Maybach {{patented}} {{the first}} of their engines fueled by ligroin. This engine was patented on December 16, 1883. It achieved Daimler's goal of being small and running fast enough to be useful at 750 rpm. Improved designs {{in the next four}} years <b>brought</b> <b>that</b> up to 900 rpm. Daimler had three engines built to this design early in 1884, and a flywheel was included in one of the engines. This design was smaller and lighter than engines by other inventors of the time. Daimler relied on hot tube ignition, until 1897, when he adopted the electrical ignition designed by Bosch.|$|E

Blockbuster's move to follow the business pattern with its online rentals as was established by Netflix prompted Netflix to sue Blockbuster for patent infringement. Blockbuster counter sued with a counterclaim alleging deceptive practices with its patent which it alleged was designed to maintain an illegal monopoly. The suits were eventually settled, and while the terms were not disclosed it was later reported that Netflix recorded a settlement payment from Blockbuster of $4.1 million in the second quarter of 2007.|$|E
25|$|The early 2000s brought {{substantial}} funding increases. High {{energy prices}} drove Alberta's energy boom resulting in multibillion-dollar government surpluses {{and the subsequent}} creation of a $4.5 billion provincial post-secondary educational endowment. In 2005, the university hired Indira Samarasekera as its 12th president, embarking on an ambitious plan to establish itself {{as one of the}} world's top public research universities. These plans were hampered by the 2008 economic downturn, and by late March 2008, the university's endowment had shrunk by more than $100 million, almost 14 per cent of its value. The university predicted a $59-million budget shortfall in 2009 before provincial cuts <b>brought</b> <b>that</b> figure to $79 million. To close the budgetary gap, the university increased non-instructional fees by $290 per year laid off teaching and support staff, and even eliminated phones in some departments (such as English and Film Studies).|$|E

25|$|Anti-Catholicism in United States is {{historically}} {{deeply rooted in}} the anti-Catholic attitudes of Protestants in Great Britain and Germany after the Reformation. Immigrants <b>brought</b> <b>that</b> hostility with them to the American colonies. Two types of anti-Catholic rhetoric existed in colonial society and continued into the following centuries. The first, derived from the theological heritage of the Protestant Reformation and the religious wars of the sixteenth century, consisted of the Biblical Anti-Christ and the Whore of Babylon variety and dominated anti-Catholic thought until the late seventeenth century. The second type was a secular variety which derived in part from xenophobic and ethnocentric Nativist sentiments and distrust towards increasing waves of Catholic immigrants, particularly from Ireland, Italy and non-Northwestern European countries, and often focused on the alleged intrigues of Catholic states or Catholic peoples against the majority Protestant United States.|$|E
25|$|Samuel {{taught that}} the {{interpretation}} that Aaron {{should not have}} eaten the offering agreed with Rabbi Nehemiah while the other interpretation that Aaron should have eaten the offering agreed with Rabbi Judah and Rabbi Simeon. Rabbi Nehemiah argued that they burned the offering because the priests were in the first stages of mourning. Rabbi Judah and Rabbi Simeon maintained that they burned it because the offering had become defiled during the day, not because of bereavement. Rabbi Judah and Rabbi Simeon argued {{that if it was}} because of bereavement, they should have burned all three sin offerings <b>brought</b> <b>that</b> day. Alternatively, Rabbi Judah and Rabbi Simeon argued that the priest would have been fit to eat the sacrifices after sunset. Alternatively, Rabbi Judah and Rabbi Simeon argued that Phinehas was then alive and not restricted by the law of mourning.|$|E
25|$|As the Waterpump mission continued, it was {{attached}} to the 606th Air Commando Squadron in 1966. General Vang Pao agitated for his own Hmong pilots to support his Clandestine Army. He pointed out that the other four military regions of Laos had an RLAF squadron; that they did not share their air assets with him, and that he had need of the same. CIA case agent James William Lair began a pilot training program for him in Thailand, using scrounged light aircraft and instructor pilots scrounged from the Thai Police Aerial Reinforcement Unit, Continental Air Services, Inc, and the Royal Thai Air Force. By Summer 1967, the improvised program had graduated dozens of neophyte pilots in its three classes. Two of them were the first of 19 Hmong pilots accepted for Waterpump training. The Hmong were unlikely pilot candidates. They were unfamiliar with modern machinery, possessed little English, and were of small stature. However, wood blocks wired to the rudder pedals <b>brought</b> <b>that</b> control within reach of the short-legged cadets. Seat cushions in the T-28s boosted the Hmong high enough they could see out of the cockpit to fly.|$|E
