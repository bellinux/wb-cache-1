40|$|Tapped-inductor {{variations}} of single-switch, single-diode, dc-to-dc converters are categorized {{based on a}} new unified sequential circuit topology and mathematical transformation approach, all seeded from a <b>basic</b> buck-boost <b>converter</b> and its transfer function. Classification focuses on identifying two different ac circuit coupled inductor arrangements of the <b>basic</b> buck-boost dc-to-dc <b>converter.</b> Subsequent dc circuit sequential manipulation yields all 11 known, documented, in theory, in simulation and practically, tapped-inductor dc-to-dc converter topologies. The procedure not only generates sequences of topologies, but also generates the voltage transfer functions without recourse to analysis of the circuit internal operating mechanisms. Consequently, two converter classes group the 11 known tapped-inductor topologies, which {{is at least one}} fewer topology classes than universally accepted. The methodology yields two new classes of three and ten coupled inductor converter topologies, all with new transfer functions.

After on-chip or off-chip measurements, the more linear transfer characteristic can be selected. In this way, chip yield is improved and the design requirements can be relaxed.

Despite not having a broadcast reception television antenna, a strong local television station can cause interference with the TV's reception of the cable converter's signal, resulting in undesired static or ghosting.|$|R

40|$|A {{modification}} of the series resonant converter topology is presented which extends converter operation from no-load to full-load. This result is accomplished by adding two switches at the secondary-side bridge rectifier, thus improving output voltage control. The resonant inverter can be operated either at constant switching frequency, even for the half-bridge topology, or at variable switching frequency. With constant switching frequency, the output voltage is regulated by controlling the switches of the rectifier stage. Soft-switching commutations of all switches are maintained in any operating condition, thus optimizing overall efficiency. The secondary-side control of the output voltage adds another interesting feature to the <b>basic</b> <b>converter,</b> i. e. the step-up and step-down regulation capability which allows {{the use of this}} topology in high power factor rectification, too.

40|$|Abstract—A {{variable-frequency}} predictive {{digital control}} method for the inductor current in switched-mode converters is introduced in this letter. This method is predictive in nature because the transistor off-time required for achieving the target current is calculated ahead of time.

The control laws for continuous and discontinuous modes of operation of the three <b>basic</b> <b>converters</b> are derived. Stability and robustness criteria are presented. The variable-frequency predictive control obviates the need for current-loop compensation and has the advantages of single-cycle response and relatively simple implementation. The control method is demonstrated in a digital signal processor (DSP) for a boost power factor corrector (PFC), which shows excellent current tracking and a very low harmonic distortion of the line current.
