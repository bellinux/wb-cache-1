As Woo had not mastered the English language yet, it took time for {{the cast and crew}} to get used to working with him. When Woo could not explain what he wanted with a shot to cinematographer Russell Carpenter, he would resort to simple statements such as [...] "this will be the Sam Peckinpah shot" [...] to get his message across to Carpenter. Actor Lance Henriksen recalled that it was a gradual process that led everyone involved to start seeing the film as a John Woo film rather than a Jean-Claude Van Damme film. Producer James Jacks recalled that Woo was not [...] "the most powerful person on the set <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was concerned, he was certainly the most respected".|$|E

2500|$|In late 1959, Shindo's album [...] "Brass and Bamboo" [...] was {{released}} by Capitol Records. [...] The album featured 10 standards and two original compositions by Shindo, combining the sounds of traditional Japanese instruments, including koto, samisen, and bamboo flutes, with Western brass with [...] "orchestration in tempos and moods that range from ballads to swing." [...] The fanfare drums used in the recording were borrowed from the Tenrikyo Church in Los Angeles, and musicians from the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra contributed a Chinese gong acquired {{on a trip to}} Hong Kong. [...] At the time of the album's release, Shindo said: [...] "It [...] [...] [...] introduces a foreign sound to the American ear. Oriental instruments have been used for solo passages in record before, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> know {{this is the first time}} they have ever been an integral part of the arrangements." [...] One reviewer rated it as the [...] "Album of the Month" [...] for April 1960, calling it a [...] "sparkling debut" [...] with [...] "a new, refreshing blend of music of the East and West, big band dance arrangements spiced with exotic instrumental sounds of the orient." [...] Esquire magazine in 1960 wrote: [...] "Tak mixes ancient Eastern and modern Western instruments in a steamy dance sukiyaki." [...] Another reviewer wrote that [...] "the music is neither Oriental nor jazz, but a delightful, different sound" [...] providing [...] "nothing but fun for stereo fanciers." [...] Writing for allmusic.com, Richard Pierson wrote that Shindo's [...] "skillful arrangements of big band chestnuts and Hollywood theme tunes achieved a blend that was witty, cosmopolitan, and almost immediately outmoded as the ascendancy of rock and its youth market turned American pop music into an arena of generational identity politics." ...|$|E
