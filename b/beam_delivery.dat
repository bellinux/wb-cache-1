The first set of experiments involved translating the position of the phantom both laterally and in a superior/inferior direction a distance of 1, 2, 5 and 10 mm. The phantom was also rotated 1 and 28. For the second set of measurements the phantom position was kept fixed and delivery errors were introduced to the <b>beam.</b> The <b>delivery</b> errors took the form of leaf position and segment intensity errors.

40|$|Radiation {{therapy is}} an {{established}} cancer treatment which exploits ionizing radiation to harm tumourous cells. As radiation can pass through healthy tissue {{to reach the}} tumour, this treatment is particularly useful {{in the case of}} deep-seated tumours.

One can limit this exposure through the design of the treatment plan, i. e., the choice of beam location, <b>beam</b> intensities, <b>delivery</b> duration, <b>beam</b> collimation, and many more degrees of freedom. The treatment plan needs to be designed {{in such a way that}} the tumour receives a therapeutic dose, while limiting the dose to the surrounding healthy organs.

40|$|Multimode {{optical fibers}} enable {{efficient}} flexible laser <b>beam</b> <b>delivery</b> {{but at a}} loss {{in the quality of}} the delivered beam. The fiber-optic <b>beam</b> <b>delivery</b> system effectiveness is strengthened by the optimal selection of its components not only for minimizing beam quality degradation but also for robustness. Smaller fibers tend to produce less degradation to beam quality but the minimum usable fiber size is limited by the quality of the laser beam, focusing optic, and the numerical aperture of the fiber. Selection of appropriate fiber type is important because the characteristics of the output beam enhance or degrade the utility of the fiber-optic-delivered beam for different applications. The other components of the <b>beam</b> <b>delivery</b> system also impact performance. High-power handling requires high- quality fiber end-face finish and special connectors that can withstand back-reflections.

40|$|The {{clinical}} {{advantage for}} protons over conventional high-energy x-rays stems from their unique depth-dose distribution, which delivers essentially no dose beyond {{the end of}} range. In order to achieve it, accurate localization of the tumor volume relative to the proton beam is necessary. For cases where the tumor moves with respiration, the resultant dose distribution is sensitive to such motion. One way to reduce uncertainty caused by respiratory motion is to use gated <b>beam</b> <b>delivery.</b> The main goal of this dissertation is to evaluate the respiratory gating technique in both passive scattering and scanning delivery mode. Our hypothesis for the study was that optimization of the parameters of synchrotron operation and respiratory gating can lead to greater efficiency and accuracy of respiratory gating for all modes of synchrotron-based proton treatment delivery. The hypothesis is tested in two specific aims. The specific aim # 1 is to assess the efficiency of respiratory-gated proton <b>beam</b> <b>delivery</b> and optimize the synchrotron operations for the gated proton therapy. A simulation study was performed and introduced an efficient synchrotron operation pattern, called variable Tcyc. In addition, the simulation study estimated the efficiency in the respiratory gated scanning <b>beam</b> <b>delivery</b> mode as well. The specific aim # 2 is to assess the accuracy of <b>beam</b> <b>delivery</b> in respiratory-gated proton therapy. The simulation study was extended to the passive scattering mode to estimate the quality of pulsed <b>beam</b> <b>delivery</b> to the residual motion for several synchrotron operation patterns with the gating technique. The results showed that variable Tcyc operation can offer good reproducible <b>beam</b> <b>delivery</b> to the residual motion at a certain phase of the motion. For respiratory gated scanning <b>beam</b> <b>delivery,</b> the impact of motion on the dose distributions by scanned beams was investigated by measurement. The results showed the threshold for motion {{for a variety of}} scan patterns and the proper number of paintings for normal and respiratory gated beam deliveries. The results of specific aims 1 and 2 provided supporting data for implementation of the respiratory gating <b>beam</b> <b>delivery</b> technique into both passive and scanning modes and the validation of the hypothesis...|$|E

40|$|One of the {{advantages}} offered by visible and NIR lasers over CO and CO{sub 2 } lasers {{is that they can}} be delivered through optical fibers. Fiber-optic <b>beam</b> <b>delivery</b> is ideal when the beam must be delivered along a complex path or processing requires complicated manipulation of the <b>beam</b> <b>delivery</b> optics. Harnessing the power of a high-power laser requires that knowledgeable and prudent choices be made when selecting the laser and its <b>beam</b> <b>delivery</b> system. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to discuss a variety of issues important when designing a <b>beam</b> <b>delivery</b> system-data obtained with high power Nd:YAG lasers will be used as illustrative examples. (1) Multimode optical fibers are used for high-power applications. The fiber imposes, to varying degrees, a structure on the beam that is different from the laser output. Fibers degrade the beam quality, although the degree of degradation is dependent on the fiber length, diameter and type. Smaller fibers tend to produce less degradation to beam quality, but the minimum usable fiber size is limited by the quality of the laser beam, focusing optic and the numerical aperture of the fiber. (2) The performance of the <b>beam</b> <b>delivery</b> system is ultimately determined by the quality of the optics. Therefore, well-corrected optics are required to realize the best possible performance. Tests with both homogeneous and GRADIUM{trademark} lenses provide insights into evaluating the benefits offered by improvements in the output optics from gradient-index, aspheric and multi-element lens systems. Additionally, these tests illustrate the origins of variable focused spot size and position with increasing laser power.

40|$|This study {{reports the}} {{investigation}} of different GEANT 4 settings for proton therapy applications {{in the context of}} Treatment Planning System comparisons. The GEANT 4. 9. 2 release was used through the GATE platform. We focused on the Pencil <b>Beam</b> Scanning <b>delivery</b> technique, which allows for intensity modulated proton therapy applications. The most relevant options and parameters (range cut, step size, database binning) for the simulation that influence the dose deposition were investigated, in order to determine a robust, accurate and efficient simulation environment. In this perspective, simulations of depth-dose profiles and transverse profiles at different depths and energies between 100 and 230 MeV have been assessed against reference measurements in water and PMMA. These measurements were performed in Essen, Germany, with the IBA dedicated Pencil Beam Scanning system, using Bragg-peak chambers and radiochromic films. GEANT 4 simulations were also compared to the PHITS. 2. 14 and MCNPX. 2. 5. 0 Monte Carlo codes. Depth-dose simulations reached 0. 3 mm range accuracy compared to NIST CSDA ranges, with a dose agreement of about 1 % over a set of five different energies. The transverse profiles simulated using the different Monte Carlo codes showed discrepancies, with up to 15 % difference in beam widening between GEANT 4 and MCNPX in water. A 8 % difference between the GEANT 4 multiple scattering and single scattering algorithms was observed. The simulations showed the inability of reproducing the measured transverse dose spreading with depth in PMMA, corroborating the fact that GEANT 4 underestimates the lateral dose spreading. GATE was found to be a very convenient simulation environment to perform this study. A reference physics-list and an optimized parameters-list have been proposed. Satisfactory agreement against depth-dose profiles measurements was obtained. The simulation of transverse profiles using different Monte Carlo codes showed significant deviations. This point is crucial for Pencil <b>Beam</b> Scanning <b>delivery</b> simulations and suggests that the GEANT 4 multiple scattering algorithm should be revised. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.

For dosimetry testing, linearity of dose response with MU, imager lag, and effectiveness of backscatter shielding were investigated. Then, an image-based model was developed to convert images to planar dose onto a virtual water phantom. The model parameters were identified using energy fluence of the Acuros treatment planning system (TPS) and, reference dose profiles and output factors measured at depths of 5, 10, 15, and 20 cm in water phantom for square fields. To validate the model, its calculated dose was compared to measured dose from MapCHECK 2 diode arrays for 36 IMRT fields at 10 cm depth delivered with 6 X, 6 XFFF, 10 X, and 10 XFFF energies. An in-house gamma function {{was used to compare}} planar doses pixel-by-pixel. Finally, the method was applied to the same IMRT fields to verify their pretreatment delivery dose compared with Eclipse TPS dose. For the EPID commissioning, dose linearity was within 0. 4 % above 5 MU and ~ 1 % above 2 MU, measured lag was smaller than the previous EPIDs, and profile symmetry was improved. The model was validated with mean gamma pass rates (standard deviation) of 99. 0 % (0. 4 %), 99. 5 % (0. 6 %), 99. 3 % (0. 4 %), and 98. 0 % (0. 8 %) at 3 %/ 3 mm for respectively 6 X, 6 XFFF, 10 X, and 10 XFFF beams.

40|$|AbstractLaser ribbon bonding is a {{new field}} of {{application}} for laser micro welding in the electronics industry especially {{in the area of}} power electronics. Traditional ribbon bonding is conducted by using ultrasonic welding to create the bond between the aluminum or copper ribbon and a conductive surface. By adapting an ultrasonic ribbon bonder and equipping it with a fiber laser, a galvanometric scanner and a <b>beam</b> focusing and <b>delivery</b> system, a new technology for ribbon bonding is created. The presented work includes test results of the welding of copper ribbons with a thickness of 300 μm to DCB-substrates and the system design of the “laser bonder”. For the laser welding of the ribbons spatial power modulation is being used and the effect of this approach on the welded ribbons is presented. The work concludes with advantages and limits of the technology especially concerning the applications compared to ultrasonic bonding...|$|R
