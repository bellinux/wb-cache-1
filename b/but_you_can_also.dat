When a belief is true, we said, there is a corresponding fact, in which the several objects of the belief form a single complex.

But in regard to any fact, besides the knowledge constituted by belief, we may also {{have the kind of}} knowledge constituted by perception (taking this word in its widest possible sense). For example, if you know the hour of the sunset, you can at that hour know the fact that the sun is setting: this is knowledge of the fact by way of knowledge of truths; <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>also,</b> if the weather is fine, look to the west and actually see the setting sun: you then know the same fact by the way of knowledge of things.|$|E

In this paper we will restrict our attention on one concrete world, which represents the game Tick-Tack-Toe. This world is a very simple one but it is sufficiently complicated for our task because most people cannot manage with it. The main difficulty in this world is that the player cannot see the entire internal state of the world so he has to build a model {{in order to understand the}} world. The model which we will offer will consist of final automata and first order formulas. 1 The world of the Tick-Tack-Toe game In this paper we will observe a concrete artificial world. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> find this world and test it in the examples of the compiler Strawberry Prolog [1].

40|$|The {{zero energy house}} project {{talks about}} sustainability. In general terms the house is {{designed}} to produce {{as much energy as}} it consume. If you take a look to the house its possible to find several systems that takes as much profit as possible to the renewable energies like photovoltaic electricity production, geothermal energy used to run a heat pump or a well thought isolated house. First of all it’s possible to find general information about the topics in house, to make people understand how our project is working. Later on we will explain the main topics to discuss it and try to work with them. The first topic of the project consists of the study of the heat transfer between the house and the external environment and the heat transfer between the rooms of the house as well. The walls of the house will be studied. Every wall hasn’t the same seriousness inside the house, so, we will try to study and find the best options to improve the insulation system of the house in Kollum. The house in Kollum has a roof full of solar panels (photovoltaic panels). As it is said in the beginning, the house is supposed to produce the whole amount of energy consumed <b>but,</b> if <b>you</b> take a look into the energy produced by the solar panels, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> realize that it’s possible {{to take advantage of the}} solar panels to produce more energy or simply waste less money. The heat pump uses the heat from the ground to provide the heating system and to supply some heat to the sanitary water. It is necessary to study how the heat pump works, to realize what are the inputs and outputs. After make the study it’s possible to see that the heat pump works, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>also</b> <b>can</b> realize that the house could use a smaller heat pump. So, we will try to find a better solution for the heat production. The house uses a solar boiler to preheat the sanitary water. Depending on the period of the year the solar boiler will have different productions. Our goal is to improve the efficiency of the solar boiler to try to get the water as warm as possible without using the heat pump supply...|$|R
