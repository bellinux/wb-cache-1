5|$|De Ferran {{gained the}} lead and {{maintained}} it at the lap-104 restart. <b>Bräck</b> attempted to pass de Ferran around {{the outside of the}} first turn for first place but was unable to get ahead. De Ferran pulled away {{from the rest of the}} field. Dixon drove into the pit lane and became the race's fifth (and final) retirement on the 106th lap. His pit crew claimed his car was damaged following contact with Servià during the caution period. Kanaan was closely following Andretti but was held up by the driver which allowed Paul Tracy to pass him. The move caused Kannan's car to develop understeer and Vasser got ahead of him. Carpentier set the race's fastest lap during the 134th lap, completing a circuit in 25.521 seconds. On lap 138, <b>Bräck</b> drafted off slower cars while de Ferran was slowed by Papis in turn four. <b>Bräck</b> got ahead of de Ferran around the outside driving into the first turn to take over the lead on the same lap. On the final lap, <b>Bräck</b> led de Ferran by two-tenths of a second. As the two drivers went onto the backstraight, De Ferran drafted up to the outside of <b>Bräck</b> and closed up to him in the second and third corners. De Ferran steered right and overtook <b>Bräck</b> for the lead in the fourth turn's entrance. Both drivers avoided making contact at the corner's edge and de Ferran drove defensively causing <b>Bräck</b> to reduce his speed to avoid colliding with him.|$|E
5|$|With his victory, <b>Bräck</b> {{claimed the}} lead in the points competition; with five races left in the season, he had 131 points. De Ferran was in second, 11 points behind <b>Bräck,</b> and Andretti was five points further back.|$|E
5|$|Drainage {{problems}} with the circuit caused {{the first two days}} of the event to be cancelled. <b>Bräck</b> — the season points leader heading into the race — was awarded the pole position. The original distance of the race was reduced from 210 laps to 168. <b>Bräck</b> lost the lead on the first lap to de Ferran who held the first position for the next 44 laps. <b>Bräck</b> passed de Ferran to reclaim the lead on the 45th lap and remained the leader until the second round of pit stops. The race distance was further reduced by series race director Chris Kneifel from 168 to 140 laps because of a danger from fading daylight. Gil de Ferran held the first position until he was held up by a slower car on the race's penultimate lap which allowed <b>Bräck</b> to retake the lead. He held it until de Ferran overtook him on the final lap winning the race. It was de Ferran's first victory of the season, his second on an oval track, and the sixth of his career. There were three cautions and five lead changes {{during the course of the}} race.|$|E

5|$|On race day, a 30-minute warm-up {{session was}} held {{before the event}} began; Kanaan again posted the fastest time (35.288), {{followed}} by Zanardi and Paul Tracy. The 154-lap race began at 1:56p.m. local time; <b>Bräck</b> immediately took the lead, and Andretti went into second {{coming out of the}} first turn. They remained the top two in lap 20, with Dario Franchitti in third. Six laps later, Andretti passed Franchitti to reclaim second when the latter was unable to pass a slower car. Drivers near the lead begin making their first round of pit stops on lap 35, and continued doing so through lap 40. By lap 60, <b>Bräck</b> had built a lead of more than seven seconds. Carpentier had moved into second place, and Andretti, Tagliani, and Franchitti rounded out the top five. <b>Bräck</b> relinquished his lead on lap 64, when he went off course while attempting to lap Junqueira. The first caution flag of the day came out, but not before Carpentier took the lead as <b>Bräck</b> regained control of his car and re-entered the track in second place. Pit stops took place during the caution, with Carpentier, <b>Bräck,</b> and Andretti still in the top three positions.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bräck</b> {{closed the}} gap with de Ferran over the next fifteen laps as they moved towards slower cars. <b>Bräck</b> got a run on de Ferran and overtook him {{at the bottom of}} the first turn to take over the lead on lap 46, while Andretti lost fourth place to Franchitti on the same lap. Jourdain spun leaving turn four because of his car {{generating}} oversteer, and slid down the frontstretch triggering the second caution on the 50th lap. Franchitti drove to the outside of the track in avoidance. Castroneves avoided hitting Jourdain's car, which remained {{at the bottom of the}} first turn and, though his vehicle lost one of its shock covers, he regained control of his car and continued. Fittipaldi reported to his team that he had a problem with either his gearbox or drivetrain and drove slowly into the pit lane on lap 53 becoming the race's second retirement. The leaders elected to make pit stops on the same lap under caution. Da Matta gained the most positions, moving from sixth to third, and <b>Bräck</b> remained the leader at the lap-57 restart. <b>Bräck</b> pulled away from the rest of the field, until de Ferran {{closed the gap}} between them by the start of the 80th lap.|$|E

5|$|Nakano lost grip in {{the front}} of his vehicle and went {{straight}} into the turn four wall on the same lap. He heavily damaged his car's right-hand side prompting a third caution. Nakano slid through the infield and stopped unhurt on the frontstretch. <b>Bräck</b> led the field back up to speed at the lap-70 restart, with Takagi in second. Green-flag pit stops began on lap 94, with <b>Bräck</b> stopping on the same lap and Franchitti became the leader. It was part of Franchitti's strategy, devised by his team manager Kyle Moyer, to drive in clean air. Andretti was required to serve a stop-and-go penalty, which he took on the 103rd lap, after he was observed speeding in the pit lane. Franchitti made his pit stop four laps later and Manning took over first place. Manning made his pit stop on lap 114 and <b>Bräck</b> reclaimed the lead. After starting from 16th, Dixon was running in sixth place by the 126th lap. He served two stop-and-go penalties because he was twice observed exceeding the pit lane speed limit, while Domínguez was similarly penalised.|$|E
5|$|Some drivers {{elected to}} make pit stops under caution. Fittipaldi had his {{engine control unit}} and spark box changed on lap 17 after he {{reported}} a problem with his car. <b>Bräck</b> remained the leader at the lap-21 restart and {{pulled away from the}} rest of the field. Andretti began to reduce the gap between <b>Bräck</b> and himself between laps 31 and 33. Tagliani reduced his pace between the second and third turns on lap 42, and was ordered by his engineer to enter the pit lane. His crew removed his car's left sidepod and retired on the next lap with a battery problem. A second caution was necessitated on the 46th lap when debris was located in turn two. The leaders made their pit stops because of the mandatory pit stop window. Fittipaldi's car problem re-emerged on the 44th lap despite having his vehicle's coils and springs changed; he drove to the pit lane to retire because his team's mechanics could not rectify the issue. Franchitti stalled his car because of a clutch issue. <b>Bräck</b> maintained the first position at the lap-52 restart, followed by Takagi. Nine laps later, Takagi attempted to pass <b>Bräck</b> around the outside for the first position but was unable to complete the manoeuvre because of the presence of slower cars.|$|E

5|$|Kenny <b>Bräck</b> won {{the pole}} {{position}} and maintained his advantage {{heading into the}} first lap. He led {{for a total of}} 134 laps, more than any other competitor. Franchitti employed a strategy that enabled him to drive in clean air while other drivers made pit stops. <b>Bräck</b> reclaimed the lead for the lap-163 restart, but lost it six laps later when a crew member dropped a wheel nut which cost him time. Franchitti took over the lead and held it {{for the remainder of the}} event to clinch the victory. It was Franchitti's third win of the season, his first on an oval track, and the tenth (and final) of his CART career. There were five cautions and nine lead changes during the course of the race.|$|E
5|$|The third caution {{was given}} on lap ten; Tracy glanced the rear-right wheel of Servià's car heading into turn three which caused both drivers to spin and stall. De Ferran led at the lap-12 restart, ahead of <b>Bräck</b> and Franchitti. <b>Bräck</b> was {{overtaken}} by Franchitti {{for second place}} around {{the outside of the}} third turn on lap 18, while Tagliani passed Kanaan at the same corner one lap later. De Ferran continued to pull away {{from the rest of the}} field and held a 7.5 second lead over Franchitti by the 30th lap. The fourth caution came out two laps later when Takagi made contact with the side of Wilson at the entrance of turn three. Both cars spun with Takagi going into the outside tire barrier and Wilson went off into the run-off area with a broken suspension. Franchitti drove into the turn six run-off area to retire with an oil pressure problem on the same lap caused by a lack of oil in his car. During the caution, most of the field made pit stops. Dixon moved from 17th to fifth and Junqueira went from 18th to seventh position because they made pit stops before the caution was displayed. Andretti moved up from 15th to tenth place.

5|$|The {{third round}} of green-flag pit stops {{commenced}} fifteen laps later when <b>Bräck</b> became the first driver to stop. Franchitti inherited the first position until he made his pit stop on lap 143, handing it to Manning. This meant Manning became the first driver to lead his début CART race twice. The fourth caution was necessitated on the 155th lap when Manning's right-hand rear wing endplate became detached and landed on the track {{between the first and}} second turns. Manning made a pit stop but his crew elected not to make repairs to his rear wing. It assisted in making his car develop less understeer and slightly improved its balance. Racing resumed on lap 163 with <b>Bräck</b> leading a single-file restart. The left side of Kanaan's car collided heavily with the wall on the backstraight six laps later, triggering the fifth (and final) caution. All drivers (including <b>Bräck)</b> made pit stops under caution. A crew member on Bräck's team dropped a left-rear wheel nut dropping him to ninth place. Fernández was observed speeding and was required to move to the rear of the field. Da Matta's team were slow to fit his right-rear tyre preventing him from taking the first position and he emerged in second place.|$|E
5|$|Castroneves led {{the field}} {{back up to}} speed at the lap-51 restart; he was {{followed}} by Fernández, <b>Bräck</b> and Dixon. Carpentier broke his rear wing after he collided with the turn one tire barrier when he locked his brakes and retired after {{it was discovered that}} his gearbox had sustained damage. Having restarted in seventh place, Andretti moved up into fourth position by lap 54. By the 60th lap, Castroneves had a 4.8 second lead over Fernández, who in turn was 3.5 seconds ahead of <b>Bräck.</b> Andretti was a further three seconds behind the Swedish driver, and was holding a two-second lead over Kanaan. <b>Bräck</b> went off at turn nine to retire with a mechanical issue that drained his car's battery on lap 63. Castroneves made a scheduled pit stop on lap 65, handing the lead to Fernández, and rejoined in tenth place. His car started to billow smoke after leaving turn one two laps later and pulled {{off to the side of}} the track at turn eight to retire. The seventh caution period was on the 68th lap to allow safety officials to remove Castroneves' car from the track. Most of the leaders (including Fernández) made pit stops to ensure they could reach the end of the race. Kanaan gained the lead and relinquished it to Andretti when he made a pit stop; Andretti led the field back up to speed at the lap-72 restart, followed by Tagliani.|$|E
5|$|De Ferran {{ended the}} season with 199 points in the Drivers' Championship, 36 ahead of <b>Bräck</b> in second.

5|$|On the 39th lap, Castroneves overtook <b>Bräck</b> {{around the}} outside at turn three and moved into third place, and Fernández got ahead of <b>Bräck</b> {{around the outside}} at the same corner two laps later. Takagi drove {{to the inside of}} the third turn {{underneath}} Servià, and both drivers made contact with the side of their cars; Servià became briefly airborne and heavily damaged the left side of his car when he hit the outside wall which caused the fifth caution. Servià was unhurt but Takagi managed to continue without any apparent damage. The race resumed on lap 45 with de Ferran leading Tagliani. Castroneves hit the rear-end of Tagliani's car on the following lap but both drivers continued without damage. The sixth caution was shown on the 49th lap when Takagi hit the right-rear wheel of Moreno's car in the turn three right-hand corner. Moreno was sent into a spin while Takagi's suspension had broke and retired from the event. de Ferran and Tagliani made pit stops for fuel and tires during the caution and could reach the end of the race without a second pit stop. De Ferran and Tagliani rejoined in 14th and 15th places.|$|E
5|$|The {{first day}} of {{practice}} for the American Memorial was scheduled on September 13, but was cancelled because of rain.

Bruno Junqueira and Memo Gidley spun in avoidance; the latter regained control of his car while Junqueira collided with the outside wall, causing him to become the race's first retirement. Max Wilson spun while gaining optimum tyre temperature {{and fell to the}} rear of the field. The race restarted on the ninth lap with de Ferran leading <b>Bräck</b> and Andretti. <b>Bräck</b> was held up by Wilson on the 23rd lap allowing de Ferran to establish a two-second lead over him. Wilson received a warning from the series' race control. Castroneves was passed by Franchitti for the fourth position seven laps later. Christian Fittipaldi attempted to lap Gidley on lap 37, but the latter drove defensively causing Fittipaldi to reduce his speed, and he was overtaken by Vasser, Adrián Fernández, and Carpentier.|$|E

40|$|Radicalism is {{just not}} {{in the nature of}} <b>Bracks</b> or his government, says Nick Economou LABOR governments have been a rare thing in Victorian {{political}} history, and Labor governments controlling both the Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council are almost unheard of. Steve <b>Bracks</b> now enjoys the same parliamentary advantage that the man he defeated in 1999, Jeff Kennett, had when he was elected in his landslide in 1992. Kennett’s victory marked the beginning of a period of massive reform, all of which earned him a reputation as a dynamic leader and, in the end, earned the wrath of regional voters. In contrast, <b>Bracks</b> won his landslide after three years of cautious and incremental government. The caution was partly due to his government’s minority status. But it also reflected the <b>Bracks</b> persona. Where Kennett was brash, arrogant and authoritarian, <b>Bracks</b> has been consultative, approachable and conservative. The next <b>Bracks</b> government will face a political environment quite different from that it grappled with after the 1999 election. As a result of the landslide, the Premier will have a greatly expanded caucus made up not only of a host of new MLAs, but also enough Legislative Councillors to control a chamber that has been beyond Labor for over 150 years. Yet, save for a promise to undertake long overdue reform of the Legislative Council, the agenda <b>Bracks</b> has set is nowhere near as radical as that of John Cain or Kennett. The difficulty for <b>Bracks</b> will be to ensure that his authority is maintained over this enhanced caucus. Clearly the triumphant Premier will have little problem in stamping his imprimatur on the Labor government in the short-term. The real quest for <b>Bracks</b> will be in being able to manage as complex a beast as the Labor caucus over the medium to long term. There is a view around that Labor will inevitably trend towards fractiousness in ways reminiscent of the dying days of the Cain-Kirner governments. While any political party’s capacity for self-destruction should never be totally discounted and Labor is notorious for the way its rigid factionalism has sometimes led to terminal internecine fighting, there are some mitigating factors. <b>Bracks</b> is now the most electorally successful Labor premier in Victorian history, and his authority is beyond question. His backbench may be greatly expanded, but should there be restive MPs they will be reminded that it was <b>Bracks</b> who got them there. Victorian Labor’s factional system has become much more fluid than it was during the Cain and Kirner years, with both the left and right groupings experiencing some fragmentation. Labor 2 ̆ 7 s leadership group is a coherent and authoritative body and will be able to give direction to caucus. There is no doubt there have been some expressions of dissatisfaction with the nature and content of the <b>Bracks</b> style within the broader labour movement and among sections of Labor’s voting constituency. The departure of some union leaders to the Greens, and the subsequent Green performance in inner city electorates in particular has been an expression of some impatience with <b>Bracks.</b> But such critics do not contribute to landslide results particularly in outer-suburban electorates, however. <b>Bracks</b> and his leadership group now have the authority of a clear endorsement from the electorate to maintain the course set after 1999. Mindful of the way the last Labor government came to grief, both the Labor leadership and the caucus will be anxious to avoid the sort of problems that beset Cain in the early 1990 s. For all the temptation that controlling the Parliament offers for those seeking to maximise policy output, such radicalism {{is just not}} in the nature of <b>Bracks</b> or his government. For the foreseeable future in Victorian politics, then, it will be a case of "steady as she goes".

50|$|One {{consequence}} of <b>Bracks</b> leaving politics {{may have been}} the introduction of abortion law reform in Victoria. It has been suggested that the resignation of Premier <b>Bracks</b> sowed the seeds for abortion law reform by legislation that parliamentarians previously had refused to support, fearing a backlash from anti-abortion groups led by veteran campaigner Margaret Tighe. <b>Bracks,</b> as a Catholic of Lebanese descent, almost certainly would not have allowed abortion legislation into the parliament, but his successor John Brumby did not share this view, and the Abortion Law Reform Bill introduced by upper house member Candy Broad was passed by the Parliament in 2008.|$|R
