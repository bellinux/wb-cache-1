Compared to the well-known multiple internal reflection (MIR) method, the distinctive advantage of multiple transmission-reflection infrared spectroscopy (MTR-IR) is the convenient measurement using standard silicon wafers as samples, {{while in the}} MIR setup special fabrication of geometric shapes such as 45 Â° <b>bevel</b> <b>cuts</b> on an attenuated total reflection silicon crystal is needed.

The curved {{shape of the}} proposed cut totally eliminates the sharp edges and angles present in Vlasov antennas with step and <b>bevel</b> <b>cuts.</b> Furthermore, with the proposed reflector configuration, the wave is radiated {{in the direction of}} the axis of the waveguide. A Vlasov antenna, designed for operation at 3 [*]GHz, is used to compare the three cut types. An additional comparison is conducted to validate the concept of the enhanced reflector position, using the bevel-cut antenna and the improved cut. The proposed antenna results in increased antenna gain and in good performance in terms of sidelobe level and half-power beamwidth, with maximum radiation directed toward the axis of the waveguide center...|$|R

In this paper, we aimed at investigating the relationship between the insertion forces and cutting edge geometry and general mathematical models of included and inclination angles for two different needle configurations. Two new geometries, one with parabolic cut and other with parabolic surface, <b>cut</b> with two <b>bevel</b> planes have been proposed along with the corresponding mathematical models to improve the cutting edge properties. Results show that parabolic needles after cutting with bevel planes have significantly improved cutting edge properties and are better than the other common needle configurations such as <b>bevel</b> <b>cut.</b> Simulation studies predicted that the deformation and stresses are slightly higher for proposed needle tip geometries than currently available topologies. However, the advantage of included and inclination angles reduce insertion forces thus optimization of medical needle design for the selected tip geometries is a trade-off between insertion forces and deflection in needle...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe sawing {{of silicon}} wafers with diamond coated wires still {{requires}} further development for a widespread application in the photovoltaic industry. The technique {{has the potential}} for a cost reduction due to higher cutting rates and the use of water as a low-cost cooling fluid, but it is also necessary to integrate the technique into the established processing chains particularly for sawing multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si). One of the requirements is an increasing industrial demand on the wafer surface quality, such as the optical appearance, the total thickness variations (TTV), the etching behavior and the sub-surface and surface damage, which determines the mechanical wafer stability. The goal of this work is to analyze the impact of different wire velocities on the surface damage of multicrystalline silicon wafers. First, the distribution of amorphous regions was measured using Raman microscopy. The results reveal slightly higher local fractions of the amorphous phase with increasing wire velocity. This also correlates with more scattering and higher inhomogeneity in the surface roughness values. Furthermore, the microcrack depths were analyzed on polished and etched <b>bevel</b> <b>cut</b> samples of wafers using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Additionally, the present study investigates the impact of cleaning procedures and different grain orientations on the sawing damage characteristics...|$|R
5000|$|The most {{striking}} {{feature of the}} stone building is its lithic block facade decorated with reliefs representing [...] "warrior-priests" [...] and mutilated bodies. The etched bas-reliefs number approximately 300, from axe-wielding warriors, to body parts, and victims, who are decapitated and mutilated. The characters are of two types: the warrior-priests (wearing a weapon or scepter) and dismembered victims or their offal (mainly heads, limbs, eyes skewered, intestines, vertebrae and viscera). These figures represent humans and demigods, without the presence of animals. In {{the interior of the}} adobe building, the main decoration is the best preserved. It depicts two mythological fish. Another figure depicts a man bleeding. These depictions closely relate to the sea, rain and human sacrifices. Carving methods include <b>bevelled</b> <b>cuts,</b> such as those found on body contours, and shallow incisions, such as noted in eyelids and lips. There have been various interpretations of the stone carvings. One interpretation is that of battle scenes, carved to commemorate a great battle, with foreign victorious warriors and defeated Casma people. An alternate theory is that the site was a laboratory for anatomical studies, which explains the explicit exposure of different parts of the human body, such as organs and bones. Yet another theory is that it represents a popular bloody rebellion, crushed by the ruling elite.|$|R

40|$|Understanding screech is {{especially}} important for the design of advanced aircraft because screech can cause sonic fatigue failure of aircraft structures. Although the connection between shock-cell spacing and screech frequency is well understood, the relation between non-uniformities in the shock-cell structures and the resulting amplitude, mode, and steadiness of screech have remained unexplored. This paper addresses the above issues by intentionally producing spanwise (larger nozzle dimension) variations in the shock-cell structures and studying the resulting spanwise screech mode. The spanwise oblique shock-cell structures were produced using imperfectly expanded convergent-divergent rectangular nozzles (aspect ratio = 5) with nonuniform exit geometries. Three geometries were studied: (a) a nozzle with a spanwise uniform edge, (b) a nozzle with a spanwise oblique (single bevelled) edge, and (c) a nozzle that had two spanwise oblique (double <b>bevelled)</b> <b>cuts</b> to form an arrowhead-shaped nozzle. For all nozzles considered, the screech mode was antisymmetric in the transverse (smaller nozzle dimension) direction allowing focus on changes in the spanwise direction. Three types of spanwise modes were observed: symmetric (1), antisymmetric (2), and oblique (3). The following significant results emerged: (1) for all cases the screech mode corresponds with the spanwise shock-cell structure, (2) when multiple screech modes are present, the technique presented here makes it possible to distinguish between coexisting and mutually exclusive modes, (3) the strength of shocks 3 and 4 influences the screech source amplitude and determines whether screech is unsteady. The results presented here offer hope for a better understanding of screech and for tailoring shock-containing jets to minimize fatigue failure of aircraft components...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Drimys brasiliensis Miers is an Angiosperm {{native to}} the Atlantic Rainforest, {{commonly}} known as cataia. Because of dormancy of its seeds, due to embryonic immaturity, production of cataia seedlings presents challenges regarding propagation of the species. Thus, cuttings emerged as a possible technique to be applied, diminishing plants production time and ensuring uniformity of rooting. Stem cuttings from current year shoots were collected in autumn/ 2012, prepared with 10 - 12 cm in length, a <b>bevel</b> <b>cut</b> on base and straight on top, keeping two leaves, one leaf or no leaves in the apical portion. After disinfestation, bases of cuttings were submitted to the following treatments with indole- 3 -butyric acid (IBA) in 50 % hydro-alcoholic solution: 100 % water, 0, 500, 1500, 3000, 4500 and 6000 mg L- 1 IBA. A completely randomized experimental design was used, with 3 types of cutting x 7 IBA concentrations, with four replicates of 10 cuttings per experimental unit. After 120 days, the variables percentage of rooted cuttings, number of roots per cutting, length of the three longest roots per cutting, percentage of cuttings with callus, alive and dead, with new shoots and the cuttings maintaining the original leaves were assessed. The application of IBA had no influence {{on any of the}} assessed variables. Cuttings with two leaves presented the best rooting percentage (51. 1 %) and the lowest mortality (5. 4 %), when compared to cuttings with one leaf (35. 0 %) or without leaves (0. 4 %).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the experimental properties of zirconia-based ceramics. METHODS: Zirconia bars were veneered to 2 mm total thickness. Veneering-method groups included: 1. Hand-layered feldsparthic porcelain (VM=VitaVM 9,Vident) and fluorapatite glass-ceramic (CR=IPSe. maxCeram,IvoclarVivadent); 2. Pressed feldspathic porcelain (PM=VitaPM 9,Vident) and fluorapatite glass-ceramic (ZP=IPSe. maxZirPress,IvoclarVivadent); 3. CAD/CAM milled feldspathic ceramic (TF=VitablocsTriluxeForte,Vident) and lithium-disilicate glass-ceramic (CAD=IPSe. maxCAD,IvoclarVivadent). CAD/CAM veneers were either cemented with resin cements (P=Panavia 21,KurarayDental), (R=RelyXUltimate, 3 M ESPE), (M=MultilinkAutomix,IvoclarVivadent) or fused with fusion glass-ceramic (C=CrystalConnect,IvoclarVivadent). A Three-point-bending test was performed. For group VM,PM,TF-M,TF-C,CAD-M,CAD-C, ten more bars were prepared and aged with cyclic loading and thermocycling before testing. Zirconia bars (PrettauZirconia,Zirkonzahn;inCorisTZI,Sirona;ZirluxFC,PentronCeramics) specimens were prepared and polished. The specimens were divided into 3 groups: control, self-glaze fired, and glazed groups. A Three-point bending test was performed. Veneered zirconia crowns were made. Feldspathic porcelain was applied to zirconia coping. <b>Bevel</b> <b>cut</b> on porcelain was made to simulate porcelain chipping. The crowns were then divided into 4 different groups according to repair materials including: 1. Conventional-resin composite (TetricEvoCeram,IvoclarVivadent) 2. Flowable-resin composite (G-aenialUniversalFlo,GCamerica) 3. Cemented CAD/CAM milled feldspathic ceramic (VitaTriluxForte,Vident) 4. Cemented CAD/CAM milled lithium-disilicate glass-ceramic (IPSe. maxCAD,IvoclarVivadent). Each crown underwent thermocycling. The test was performed by loading force on the center of repaired part to record load-to-failure. RESULTS: There were significant differences in the failure loads of non-aged bilayered veneer-zirconia bars. Aging experiment revealed a significant difference in failure load between non-aged and aged bars in groups VM and PM, but not in the groups with CAD/CAM milled veneers. There was significant influence of surface treatments on flexural strength of zirconia specimens. Post-hoc test showed that glazed group had significant lower flexural strength than other groups. Crowns repaired with CAD/CAM ceramics showed significant higher failure load than resin composite. Repairing with lithium-disilicate glass ceramic yielded the highest load-to-failure of the specimens. CONCLUSIONS: -	Veneer materials, veneering methods, and cement materials have a significant effect on the failure load of bilayered veneer- zirconia. CAD/CAM veneer-zirconia is not susceptible to aging performed in this study. -	Glazing decreased the flexural strength of high translucent zirconia. -	Veneered zirconia crowns repaired with CAD/CAM ceramic materials have significantly higher load-to-failure than veneered crowns repaired with resin composite. 2018 - 09 - 28 T 00 : 00 : 00...|$|R
