She warns the Abbot, while Skor and Rake find their way there. When they arrive, the Wearat is defeated by Jum Gurdy, the otter cellardog, and Posybud, a young hedgehog. The vermin crew are slain.|$|R
5000|$|Oval BA {{should not}} be {{confused}} with another major storm on Jupiter, the South Tropical Little Red Spot (LRS) (nicknamed [...] "the Baby Red Spot" [...] by NASA), which was destroyed by the GRS. The new storm, previously a white spot in Hubble images, turned red in May 2008. The observations were led by Imke de Pater of the University of California, at Berkeley, US. The <b>Baby</b> Red <b>Spot</b> encountered the GRS in late June to early July 2008, and in the course of a collision, the smaller red spot was shredded into pieces. The remnants of the <b>Baby</b> Red <b>Spot</b> first orbited, then were later consumed by the GRS. The last of the remnants with a reddish color to have been identified by astronomers had disappeared by mid-July, and the remaining pieces again collided with the GRS, then finally merged with the bigger storm. The remaining pieces of the <b>Baby</b> Red <b>Spot</b> had completely disappeared by August 2008. During this encounter Oval BA was present nearby, but played no apparent role in destruction of the <b>Baby</b> Red <b>Spot.</b>|$|R
60|$|The kindest {{little man}} as never growed! Spirited, but not proud. When he {{travelled}} with the Spotted Baby--though he knowed {{himself to be}} a nat'ral Dwarf, and knowed the <b>Baby's</b> <b>spots</b> to be put upon him artificial, he nursed that Baby like a mother. You never heerd him give a ill-name to a Giant. He did allow himself to break out into strong language respectin the Fat Lady from Norfolk; but that was an affair of the 'art; and when a man's 'art has been trifled with by a lady, and the preference giv to a Indian, he ain't master of his actions.|$|R

30|$|Presumably, {{this early}} {{ability to pay}} special {{attention}} to living things, and especially to human beings, might have an undeniable adaptive value and is considered {{as a consequence of the}} fact that even <b>babies</b> can <b>spot</b> some crucial features related to movement patterns and physical characteristics linked to animate entities (Sanefuji, Wada, Yamamoto, Shizawa, Matsuzaki, Mohri, Ozone & Taniike, 2011).|$|R
50|$|Ossification {{is started}} by the {{formation}} of layers of undifferentiated connective tissue that hold {{the area where the}} flat bone is to come. On a <b>baby,</b> those <b>spots</b> are known as fontanelles. The fontanelles contain connective tissue stem cells, which form into osteoblasts, which secrete calcium phosphate into a matrix of canals. They form a ring in between the membranes, and begin to expand outwards. As they expand they make a bony matrix.|$|R
50|$|ShineBright {{are from}} Orrville, Ohio, which Emily and Nathan started by leading youth worship {{services}} at their church, and {{that happened in}} 2007. The band solidified in 2009 with their current membership. At this time, Shine Bright <b>Baby</b> was <b>spotted</b> at the Alive Festival by the Tooth & Nail Records label, which they continued their interest, {{but it was not}} until 2012 when they were introduced to BEC Recordings by Tooth & Nail. Lastly, Emily stated that they did not get serious in making music until 2010.|$|R
25|$|They {{occur in}} about 90-95% of Asian and 80-85% Native American infants. Approximately 90% of Polynesians and Micronesians {{are born with}} Mongolian spots, as are about 46% of {{children}} in Latin America, where they are associated with non-European descent. These spots also appear on 5-10% of babies of full Caucasian descent; Coria del Río in Spain has a high incidence due {{to the presence of}} descendants of Hasekura Tsunenaga, the first Japanese official envoy to Spain in the early 17th century. Black <b>babies</b> have Mongolian <b>spots</b> at a frequency of 96%.|$|R
25|$|Baby Doe met Horace Tabor in a {{restaurant}} in Leadville one evening in 1880. She told him her story {{and that she had}} arrived in Leadville because of Jake Sandelowsky's generosity. Tabor gave her $5000 on the <b>spot.</b> <b>Baby</b> Doe then had a message, and $1000, delivered to Sandelowsky, in which she declared that she would not marry him. Instead, Tabor moved her to the Clarendon Hotel, next to the opera house and Sandelowsky's store, Sands, Pelton & Company. Sandelowsky later moved to Aspen, where he opened another store, married, and built a house.|$|R
5000|$|A study {{performed}} in hospitals of Mexico City {{reported that in}} average 51.8% of Mexican newborns presented the congenital skin birthmark known as the mongolian spot whilst it was absent in 48.2% of the analized <b>babies.</b> The mongolian <b>spot</b> appears with a very high frequency (85-95%) in Asian, Native American and African children. The skin lession reportedly almost always appears on South American and Mexican children who are racially Mestizoswhile having a very low frequency (5-10%) in Caucasian children. According to the Mexican Social Security Institute (shortened as IMSS) nationwide, around half of Mexican babies have the mongolian spot.|$|R
5000|$|LeRoy {{is perhaps}} best remembered for a dinner table {{sequence}} in the W.C. Fields comedy The Old Fashioned Way (1934) in which he throws a handful of custard into the comedian's face, yanks on his nose, and destroys his pocket watch by tossing it into a bowl of molasses. Fields initially endures each of these indignities, but the scene ends with Fields <b>spotting</b> <b>Baby</b> LeRoy standing in a doorway and giving the toddler a kick to the rear end. The film's director, William Beaudine, reported that the kick got [...] "the biggest laugh in the picture." ...|$|R
50|$|The spot is {{prevalent}} among East, South, Southeast, North and Central Asian peoples, Indigenous Oceanians (chiefly Micronesians and Polynesians), Sub-Saharan Africans, Amerindians, non-European Latin Americans, Caribbeans of mixed-race descent, and Turkish people. They occur in about 90-95% of Asian and 80-85% Native American infants. Approximately 90% of Polynesians and Micronesians {{are born with}} Mongolian spots, as are about 46% of children in Latin America, where they are associated with non-European descent.

6000|$|... "There is no fiercer looking {{animal in}} all the Green Forest than Tufty the Lynx, but despite this he is, like most Cats, cowardly. Only when cornered will he fight. He is possessed of a lively curiosity, and often he will stealthily follow a hunter or trapper for miles. The fur of his coat is very long and handsome, and he is hunted and trapped for this. As he lives {{for the most part}} far from the homes of men, he does less damage to man than does his cousin, Yowler the Bob Cat. Tufty must depend wholly for his living on the little people of the Green Forest. Sometimes he will attack a Fox. The pretty little <b>spotted</b> <b>babies</b> of Lightfoot the Deer are victims {{whenever}} he can find them.|$|R
50|$|The English {{officers}} General Dyer (Kamal Kapoor) and Inspector Simon (Bob Christo) conspire with a snivelling, weak-willed local doctor Harry (Prem Chopra) {{to capture}} Raja.

5000|$|A sleepy infant {{finds himself}} transported from his cradle to the [...] "Lullaby Land of Nowhere", a dreamland where pacifiers grow on trees; diapers, bottles, and potty chairs march on parade; and Baby's stuffed gingham dog comes to life. He wanders into the [...] "forbidden garden", {{containing}} {{such things as}} scissors, knives, and fountain pens that Baby [...] "mustn't touch." [...] He callously smashes watches with hammers and plays with giant matches. The burning matches chase after him. Baby and his dog escape across a pond, using a huge bar of soap as a raft, but {{the smoke from the}} matches turns into boogey-men, who chase Baby before vanishing. The benevolent Sandman, dressed as a wizard, <b>spots</b> <b>Baby</b> hiding and works his magic, sending Baby to sleep in his own cradle at home.|$|R
5000|$|On 4 February, after Rosie {{agrees to}} go to a [...] "mother and baby" [...] photo shoot, which [...] "pays a fortune", they {{convince}} Kevin to let them have Jack for the day but disaster strikes when they accidentally bring home a <b>baby</b> girl. Jason <b>spots</b> this, and just as they are about to swap the babies back, Kevin walks in and demands the truth. Jason admits what happened and Kevin goes looking for his son. He finds Jack but warns Rosie to stay away, expressing his disappointment in her. Despite this, Jason is good friends with Kevin and supports him when he wins £200,000 on a scratchcard.
