Alceste and Active now concentrated their full broadsides on Pomone, which soon lost both masts and was forced to surrender to prevent total destruction. Pauline escaped, later reaching Ancona safely but having suffered severe damage in the engagement.|$|E

50|$|At any time, {{the proper}} <b>batter</b> {{is simply the}} player whose name follows the {{previous}} actual <b>batter</b> in the written batting order (at {{the start of the}} game, the #1 hitter is the proper <b>batter,</b> and in subsequent innings, the leadoff proper <b>batter</b> is the one who follows the last <b>batter</b> to complete a plate appearance in the last previous inning). Any <b>batter's</b> out-of-turn but completed plate appearance is legalized when a pitch is thrown to any subsequent <b>batter</b> on either team. Thus, in order to determine who is the proper <b>batter</b> at any given time, it is necessary only to consider the last two <b>batters</b> who have received a pitch—the last proper or legalized <b>batter</b> and the <b>batter</b> whose action will be nullified if found improper.|$|R
50|$|There are two <b>batter's</b> boxes, one on {{each side}} of home plate. The <b>batter's</b> boxes are 4 feet wide (1.2 m) and 6 feet long (1.8 m). The <b>batter's</b> boxes are {{centered}} lengthwise at the center of home plate with the inside line of each <b>batter's</b> box 6 inches (15.24 cm) from the near edge of home plate. A right-handed <b>batter</b> would stand in the <b>batter's</b> box {{on the left side of}} home plate from the perspective of the catcher and umpire. A left-handed <b>batter</b> would stand in the <b>batter's</b> box to their right. A <b>batter</b> may only occupy one <b>batter's</b> box at a time and may not legally leave the <b>batter's</b> box after the pitcher has come set or has started his windup. Should the <b>batter</b> wish to leave the <b>batter's</b> box once the pitcher has engaged the rubber, he must first ask the umpire for time-out. Time will not be granted if the pitcher has already started his pitching motion. For playing rules relating to the <b>batter's</b> box, see Rules 6.05 and 6.06 of the Official Baseball Rules.|$|R
50|$|If the infraction is {{discovered}} during a plate appearance (that is, a pitch has been {{thrown to the}} current <b>batter),</b> then the umpire considers the current <b>batter</b> and the previous one. If the current <b>batter's</b> name does not follow the previous actual <b>batter's</b> name in the written order, the current <b>batter</b> is improper. There is no penalty, but the situation is rectified — the proper <b>batter</b> comes to bat and assumes the improper <b>batter's</b> current count. In this situation, if the proper <b>batter</b> is on base, then he is simply skipped in the order, and the next <b>batter</b> in the order is now the proper <b>batter.</b> In this situation under high school (NFHS) rules, the proper <b>batter</b> is brought in off the bases, assumes his proper at bat, and a courtesy runner (the last batted out) takes his place on the bases.|$|R

5000|$|On {{the fourth}} ball, {{it is called}} a walk, and the <b>batter</b> becomes a runner, and is {{entitled}} to advance to first base without risk of being put out, called a base on balls or a walk (abbreviated BB). If a pitch touches the <b>batter</b> (or the <b>batter's</b> clothes), the umpire declares a hit by pitch (abbreviated HBP) and the <b>batter</b> is awarded first base, unless the umpire determines that the ball was in the strike zone when it hit the <b>batter,</b> or that the <b>batter</b> {{did not attempt to}} avoid being hit. In practice, neither exception is ever called unless the <b>batter</b> obviously tries to get hit by the pitch; even standing still in the box will virtually always be overlooked, and the <b>batter</b> awarded first. In addition, if the <b>batter</b> swings at a pitch that hits him, it counts as a strike. If the catcher's mitt, catcher's mask, or any part of the catcher comes in contact with the <b>batter</b> and/or the <b>batter's</b> bat as the <b>batter</b> is attempting to hit a pitch, the <b>batter</b> is awarded first base, ruled [...] "catcher's interference".|$|R

5|$|En {{route to}} Cadiz, Linois {{had learned from}} {{the crew of the}} {{captured}} brig HMS Speedy that a powerful British squadron of seven ships of the line under Rear-Admiral Sir James Saumarez lay off Cadiz, blockading the port. Concerned that this squadron could overwhelm his own, Linois took shelter in the small but well-defended harbour of Algeciras, just across Algeciras Bay from the heavily fortified British naval base at Gibraltar. Saumarez was informed of Linois's arrival, and turned eastwards to confront him, discovering the French ships anchored in a well prepared position on the morning of 6 July. Saumarez attacked immediately, but found that his ships were hampered by a lack of wind. Becalmed under heavy fire, the British squadron inflicted severe damage on the French ships which withdrew into shallower water, two grounding. However, when Saumarez ordered his ships to follow, HMS Hannibal grounded as well, trapped under a heavy barrage from the shore. With no wind with which to manoeuvre and the squadron's boats all either sunk or engaged in towing the <b>battered</b> HMS Pompée back to Gibraltar, Saumarez called off the attack at 13:35. The <b>battered</b> British squadron retired to Gibraltar, except for Hannibal, which was trapped, <b>battered</b> and swiftly forced to surrender, having lost two masts and more than 140 men.|$|E

50|$|When an {{improper}} <b>batter</b> is legalized by a pitch to a subsequent <b>batter,</b> the written order does not change. The proper <b>batter</b> is {{then the next}} <b>batter</b> in the written order just after the newly legalized improper <b>batter,</b> even if this causes one or more <b>batters</b> to be skipped. (If the proper <b>batter</b> is on base—a situation that can happen due to his being a previous improper <b>batter,</b> now legalized—he is skipped and the batting order goes to the next name on it.) Because the umpire and official scorer are not {{to comment on the}} batting order (outside of ruling on an appeal), the teams need to be vigilant about following the written order.|$|R
5000|$|In baseball, a {{right-handed}} pitcher's curve {{ball will}} {{break away from}} a right-handed <b>batter</b> and towards a left-handed <b>batter.</b> Historical batting averages show that left-handed <b>batters</b> have a slight advantage over right-handed <b>batters</b> when facing right-handed pitchers. Because there are fewer left-handed pitchers than right-handed pitchers, left-handed <b>batters</b> have more opportunities to face right-handed pitchers than their right-handed counterparts have against left-handed pitchers. Fourteen of the top twenty career batting averages in Major League Baseball history have been posted by left-handed <b>batters.</b> Left-handed <b>batters</b> have a slightly shorter run from the <b>batter's</b> box to first base than right-handers. This gives left-handers a slight advantage in beating throws to first base on infield ground balls.|$|R
40|$|This {{pilot study}} {{integrated}} sport expertise and biomechanics methodologies within a baseball batting task. Purpose {{was to examine}} differences within a highly skilled group of baseball <b>batters</b> to use visual information to guide weight transfer and bat movements. One <b>batter</b> who played at Major League Baseball (MLB) level was compared to five <b>batters</b> who played at Australian Baseball League (ABL) level in a case-control design. <b>Batters</b> faced pitchers in a simulated competition and attempted to hit pitches, while vision was temporally occluded during ball flight or not occluded. Time of weight transfer (kinetics), as well as bat downswing initiation and duration (kinematics) {{from the point of}} ball release, were compared between the MLB <b>batter</b> and ABL <b>batters.</b> Results indicated that the MLB <b>batter</b> coordinated his striking pattern by completing his weight transfer earlier than the ABL <b>batters.</b> His bat downswing was also initiated earlier than some ABL <b>batters,</b> but {{there was no difference in}} duration of bat downswing between <b>batters.</b> All <b>batters</b> initiated bat downswing prior to completion of weight transfer. Understanding of motor expertise is furthered using a novel methodology...|$|R
