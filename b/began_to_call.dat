5|$|During Hamilton's {{tenure as}} Treasury Secretary, {{political}} factions began to emerge. A Congressional caucus, led by James Madison and William Branch Giles, {{began as an}} opposition group to Hamilton's financial programs, and Thomas Jefferson joined this group {{when he returned from}} France. Hamilton and his allies <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> themselves Federalists. The opposition group, now called the Democratic-Republican Party by political scientists, was at the time known as Republicans.|$|E
5|$|Following Mark Warner's {{withdrawal}} from the race in October, Bayh looked to gain {{the most in the}} field of candidates. He immediately <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> former Warner supporters, hoping they would support his campaign. During a visit to New Albany, Indiana, the candidate called for the 9/11 Commission's recommendations to be enacted. Later in the month, he made a stop in Nevada to discuss senior issues with Nevada's gubernatorial candidate Dina Titus.|$|E

5|$|The 42nd Infantry Division Murska and Detachment Ormozki {{were cut}} off north of Zagreb, and those {{elements}} that did not disperse to their homes withdrew into the Ivanšćica and Kalnik mountains. Leaders of a Slovene nationalist movement announced {{that they no longer}} recognised the Yugoslav government, and <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> for Slovene soldiers to cease fighting and return home, compounding the effect of Ustaše propaganda on Croat military personnel and accelerating the disintegration of Yugoslav forces.|$|E
5|$|Truth (satya) implies love, and {{firmness}} (agraha) engenders {{and therefore}} {{serves as a}} synonym for force. I thus <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> the Indian movement Satyagraha, that is to say, the Force which is born of Truth and Love or nonviolence, and gave up {{the use of the}} phrase “passive resistance”, in connection with it, so much so that even in English writing we often avoided it and used instead the word “satyagraha”....|$|E
5|$|Following the sacking of Graeme Souness as Newcastle {{manager in}} February 2006, Bruce was again {{linked with the}} job, which {{ultimately}} went to Glenn Roeder. By {{this stage of the}} 2005–06 season, Birmingham were struggling in the league, and on 21 March 2006 were beaten 7–0 at home by Liverpool in the FA Cup quarter-finals. Some supporters of the club <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> for his resignation, but Bruce insisted that he would fight on as manager. The team managed to climb out of the relegation zone {{for the first time in}} nearly six months after a win over Bolton Wanderers in early April 2006. However, they were soon overtaken by Portsmouth, whose victory over Wigan Athletic on 29 April left Birmingham mathematically unable to match their points total and therefore relegated.|$|E

5|$|On 2 October 1997, the {{prosecution}} <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> more witnesses. Although attendance did not abate, most observers were police officers or paid spectators. One witness, {{who claimed to}} have participated in a sting operation to arrest Sumaji, was arrested for perjury. An officer who investigated Sumaji reported that he had pursued the driver based on instinct, not evidence. Wuryanto, while presenting his account, was contemptuous towards the defence and ordered by the judge several times to answer truthfully. On 3 November, {{the prosecution}} withdrew its case. Under Indonesian law, the judges had the right to find the subject guilty despite the prosecution's withdrawal; after further consideration, on 27 November, the tribunal acquitted Sumaji. Following the acquittal, Bantual police refused to investigate Udin's murder further; several of Yogyakarta's police chiefs stated that the department had fulfilled its duty by arresting a suspect and sending him to trial.|$|E
5|$|The early {{light was}} {{obscured}} {{by a black}} cloud through which shone flashes, which Pliny likens to sheet lightning, but more extensive. The cloud obscured Point Misenum near at hand and the island of Capraia (Capri) across the bay. Fearing for their lives, the population <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> {{to each other and}} move back from the coast along the road. A rain of ash fell, causing Pliny to shake it off periodically to avoid being buried. Later that same day the pumice and ash stopped falling and the sun shone weakly through the cloud, encouraging Pliny and his mother to return to their home and wait for news of Pliny the Elder.|$|E
5|$|The Reactionary Party (the former {{dissident}} conservative {{elements within}} the Moderate Party) began by passing the Interpretation of the Additional Act, which {{was followed by the}} reform of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Both laws, built upon the 1834 Additional Act, would allow the national government to reassert its control over provincial police and courts. They would provide the means to deal effectively with provincial rebellions and inevitably grant the national government greater sway over the provincial governments. In turn, the party in power would gain greater ascendancy in national politics through patronage and office appointments. Fearful that their adversaries would stay in power indefinitely, the Liberals <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> for PedroII to attain majority at a younger age. They hoped to regain their influence by doing away with the regency and dealing directly with a pliable young emperor. Towards that end, the Liberals allied themselves with the Facção Áulica (Courtier Faction), led by Aureliano Coutinho (Feijó's ally in the 1832 coup attempt).|$|E

5|$|Dakota tribes, {{mostly the}} Mdewakanton, {{as early as}} the 16th century were known as {{permanent}} settlers near their sacred site of St. Anthony Falls. New settlers arrived during the 1850s and 1860s in Minneapolis from New England, New York, and Canada, and during the mid-1860s, immigrants from Finland and Scandinavians (from Sweden, Norway and Denmark) <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> the city home. Migrant workers from Mexico and Latin America also interspersed. Later, immigrants came from Germany, Italy, Greece, Poland, and Southern and Eastern Europe. These immigrants tended to settle in the Northeast neighborhood, which still retains an ethnic flavor and is particularly known for its Polish community. Jews from Russia and Eastern Europe began arriving in the 1880s and settled primarily {{on the north side of}} the city before moving in large numbers to the western suburbs in the 1950s and 1960s. Asians came from China, the Philippines, Japan, and Korea. Two groups came for a short while during U.S. government relocations: Japanese during the 1940s, and Native Americans during the 1950s. From 1970 onward, Asians arrived from Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand. Beginning in the 1990s, a large Latino population arrived, along with immigrants from the Horn of Africa, especially Somalia. The metropolitan area is an immigrant gateway which had a 127% increase in foreign-born residents between 1990 and 2000.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after their}} accession, William and Mary rewarded John Churchill by {{granting}} him the Earldom of Marlborough and Prince George was made Duke of Cumberland. Anne requested {{the use of}} Richmond Palace and a parliamentary allowance. William and Mary refused the first, and unsuccessfully opposed the latter, both of which caused {{tension between the two}} sisters. Anne's resentment grew worse when William refused to allow Prince George to serve in the military in an active capacity. The new king and queen feared that Anne's financial independence would weaken their influence over her and allow her to organise a rival political faction. From around this time, at Anne's request she and Sarah Churchill, Lady Marlborough, <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> each other the pet names Mrs. Morley and Mrs. Freeman respectively, to facilitate a relationship of greater equality between the two when they were alone. In January 1692, suspecting that Marlborough was secretly conspiring with James's followers, the Jacobites, William and Mary dismissed him from all his offices. In a public show of support for the Marlboroughs, Anne took Sarah to a social event at the palace, and refused her sister's request to dismiss Sarah from her household. Lady Marlborough was subsequently removed from the royal household by the Lord Chamberlain, and Anne angrily left her royal lodgings and took up residence at Syon House, the home of the Duke of Somerset. Anne was stripped of her guard of honour; courtiers were forbidden to visit her, and civic authorities were instructed to ignore her. In April, Anne gave birth to a son who died within minutes. Mary visited her, but instead of offering comfort took the opportunity to berate Anne once again for her friendship with Sarah. The sisters never saw each other again. Later that year, Anne moved to Berkeley House in Piccadilly, London, where she had a stillborn daughter in March 1693.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{relaxation}} of authoritarian political controls in 1946, {{large numbers of}} people <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> openly for a return to traditional religious practice.

25|$|This {{cultural}} {{revival of}} the Interbellum years served to give the Livonian people {{for the first time}} a clear consciousness of their ethnic identity. Before, they had always referred to themselves as rāndalist ("coast dwellers") or kalāmīed ("fishermen"). From the 1920s and 1930s on, though, they <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> themselves līvõd, līvnikad, or līvlist ("Livonians").|$|E
25|$|On 17 June, the Third Estate, {{led by the}} comte de Mirabeau, <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> {{themselves}} the National Assembly.
