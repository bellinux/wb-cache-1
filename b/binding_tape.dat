50|$|The washi paper {{used most}} {{predominantly}} {{across the world}} today for paper cutting, book <b>binding,</b> <b>tapes</b> and multiple other uses is not Tesuki washi but actually Japanese Sekishu washi, a paper developed around 800 AD in the Sekishu region (modern day Iwami in Japan) and designated a UNESCO Intangible Cultural asset in 2009. Paper cutting continues today in Japan in contemporary forms such as framed art, installations and paper cut sculpture.|$|R
25|$|<b>Tape</b> <b>binding</b> {{refers to}} a system that wraps and glues a piece of tape {{around the base of the}} document. A tape-binding machine such as the Powis Parker Fastback or Standard Accubind system will usually be used to {{complete}} the binding process and to activate the thermal adhesive on the glue strip. However, some users also refer to <b>tape</b> <b>binding</b> as the process of adding a colored tape to the edge of a mechanically fastened (stapled or stitched) document.|$|R

He indicated that fiber analysis {{is not as good}} as DNA evidence.|$|R
5000|$|Eleventh Law: Documents {{shall be}} held together, in the {{absolute}} {{discretion of the}} solicitor assembling them, by: a steel pin sharp enough to injure the reader; a staple too short to penetrate the full thickness of the bundle; <b>tape</b> <b>binding</b> so stitched that the bundle cannot be fully opened; or a ring or arch-binder, so damaged that the 2 arches do not meet.|$|R
50|$|The tools {{traditionally}} {{used for}} the part preparation process are very elementary: writing utensils (pencils of various graphite hardness, colored pencils, ink pens, felt tipped pens, electric and manual erasers, correction fluid and tape), office supplies (pencil sharpeners, staplers, staple removers, scissors, rulers, drafting templates, straight-edges, non-yellowing permanent and removable adhesive tapes, paper clips, packing tape, shipping materials, and property stamps). Typical office equipment found in an ensemble library includes a high quality photocopier capable of copying and printing paper of various sizes in duplex; papers of different sizes, colors and weights; <b>binding</b> machines (<b>tape,</b> coil, wire or comb); paper cutters; and computer(s) with word processing, spreadsheet, database and music notation software.|$|R
40|$|Work {{under this}} two-year {{cooperative}} agreement addresses improved removal {{of light and}} sticky contaminants from waste paper. Such contaminants occur in ever-increasing amounts, resulting from glues, labels, book <b>bindings,</b> packaging <b>tapes,</b> etc., all associated with the waste paper stream. Despite various cleaning steps in the paper mill recycling systems, residual contamination remains, causing big problems with the product quality and with paper machine and converting operations. Some grades cannot be recycled at all. Stickies are truly a barrier against increased paper recycling. The stickies problem was attacked in four project segments [...] three of those have yielded tangible results. One segment has been outstanding in its success; namely, {{the development of a}} centrifugal reverse cleaning system consisting of primary and secondary stages, which have unparalleled high efficiency in the removal of light and sticky contaminants. This cleaning system, consists of primary XTREME and secondary XX-Clone units. Another segment of this work, washing wax contaminated old corrugated wastepaper (OCC), also has resulted in the new Xtrax process which was released for sale...|$|R

5000|$|Following {{the dream}} episode written by Chad Michael Murray, Brooke is {{approached}} by Julian {{to design the}} costumes for Lucas' movie, which she initially declines, but decides to think about it. Brooke briefly clashed with Sam over a boy named Jack spent the night. She later reveals to Sam that she was attacked. As Jack and Sam begin talking about Brooke, they talk about how Sam once said that Brooke needed to be [...] "put in her place". A smitten Jack listened to Sam, and had someone attack Brooke for Sam's pleasure. Sam realizes this and gets the stolen sketches back, and when she shows them to Brooke, Brooke begins breaking down and seeing this, Sam leaves again. Brooke begins searching for Sam and gets into a fight with Owen along the way. She goes to the cafe Sam frequents and bumps into Julian, who walks out. The waitress tells Brooke that Julian inquired about Sam, and she begins considering him as a decent guy (possibly romantically). At {{the conclusion of the}} episode, a heartbroken Sam gets into a car with Jack and his brother, and it is revealed that Jack's brother was actually the one who attacked Brooke. It is also revealed that this is the same guy who murdered Quentin. Brooke Goes in search for Sam with Peyton by her side. After searching all over Tree Hill and finding little help from a police officer (due to Sam not being missing long enough), she realizes Sam must be at her friend Jack Daniels' house, and gets the address from Haley. She tells Peyton she wants to confront Sam alone because they have a lot to talk about, and goes to Jack's house by herself. She doesn't find Jack or Sam there, but she does meet with Jack's older brother, X, who has Sam bound and gagged in a closet. X denies knowing where Sam is, and he talks in a sexually suggestive manner to Brooke, who thinks he is weird but is unfazed. As Brooke walks down the sidewalk after the visit, he says [...] "Have a nice night" [...] which is the same line her attacker uttered as she lay bleeding on the floor of her store after the attack. Brooke realizes that X is the one who beat her, and that he must have Sam. She bangs on the door and when he opens it, she sprays mace in his face and beats him until he's incapacitated, then rushes through the house looking for Sam. As she finds her, Sam begs her to leave, but Brooke refuses. She starts to undo the <b>tape</b> <b>binding</b> her, but X sneaks up behind Brooke and drags her away as Sam screams. X tries to strangle Brooke, but she spits in his face and knocks him away. Brooke runs, but X chases her and knocks her to the floor. The pair struggle and X indicates {{that he is going to}} kill Brooke and enjoy it and that she is just a weak little rich girl. But Brooke finds her purse, grabs her gun and stands with it pointed at X's head, telling him the rich little girl is going to stay awhile as Julian and Jack rush into the house and Sam breaks free of the last of the tape. Brooke cocks the gun, tells Rex she hates him and that she isn't the same girl that he attacked, and is about to shoot him, but Sam begs her not to, calling Brooke [...] "Mom" [...] and saying she needs her. Brooke knocks her attacker unconscious with the gun instead and kicks him over, telling him to [...] "Have a nice night." [...] After the police arrive, they find Quentin's wallet and Brooke realizes X is Q's murderer and cries on Julian's shoulder.|$|R
