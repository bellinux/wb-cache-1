5|$|The {{house sparrow}} is {{strongly}} associated with human habitations, and can live in urban or rural settings.

25|$|Sex is not {{considered}} acceptable outside marriage, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> {{important part of the}} love and care shown between partners. Sexual relations are forbidden {{during the time of the}} woman's period. After her period has ended, she will go to the mikveh (the ritual immersion pool) where she will fully immerse herself and become ritually clean again. Sexual relations may then resume. Married couples need to find other ways of expressing their love for each other during these times, and some say that the time of abstention enhances the relationship.|$|E
25|$|The entire {{capitalist}} system thus {{appears as a}} hierarchical structure of different levels of productivity, and as {{the outcome of the}} uneven and combined development of states, regions, branches of industry and firms, unleashed by the quest for surplus-profit. It forms an integrated unity, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> integrated unity of non-homogeneous parts, and it is precisely the unity that here determines the lack of homogeneity. In this whole system development and underdevelopment reciprocally determine each other, for while the quest for surplus-profits constitutes the prime motive power behind the mechanisms of growth, surplus-profit can only be achieved at the expense of less productive regions and branches of production.|$|E

25|$|Hinduism has {{an ancient}} and {{extensive}} iconography tradition, {{particularly in the}} form of Murti (Sanskrit: मूर्ति, IAST: Mūrti), or Vigraha or Pratima. A Murti is itself not the god in Hinduism, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> image of god and represents emotional and religious value. A literal translation of Murti as idol is incorrect, states Jeaneane Fowler, when idol is understood as superstitious end in itself. Just like the photograph of a person is not the real person, a Murti is an image in Hinduism but not the real thing, but in both cases the image reminds of something of emotional and real value to the viewer. When a person worships a Murti, it is assumed to be a manifestation of the essence or spirit of the deity, the worshipper's spiritual ideas and needs are meditated through it, yet the idea of ultimate reality or Brahman is not confined in it.|$|E
25|$|Weta can bite with {{powerful}} mandibles. Tree weta bites are painful but not particularly common. Weta can inflict painful scratches, {{with the potential}} of infection, but their defence displays consist of looking large and spiky, and they will retreat if given a chance. Tree weta arc their hind legs into the air in warning to foes, and then strike downwards, so the spines could scratch {{the eyes of a}} predator. Pegs or ridges {{at the base of the}} abdomen are struck by a patch of fine pegs at the base (inner surface) of the legs and this action makes a distinctive sound. These actions are also used in defence of a gallery by competing males. The female weta looks as if she has a stinger, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> ovipositor, which enables her to lay eggs inside rotting wood or mossy wood or soil. Some species of Hemiandrus have very short ovipositors, related perhaps to their burrowing into soil and laying their eggs in a special chamber at the end of the burrow.|$|E
500|$|The Greek text of this codex is a {{representative}} of the Byzantine text-type, but with a number of singular readings. According to Bruce M. Metzger it is typical Byzantine text. According to Kurt and Barbara Aland it agrees with the Byzantine standard text 156 times, and 78 times with the Byzantine when it has the same reading as the original text. It does not support the [...] "original" [...] text against the Byzantine. It has 11 independent or distinctive readings. Alands placed it in Category V of New Testament manuscripts. It is not a very important codex, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> important witness of the Byzantine text-type. Hermann von Soden classified it as Ki (now it is known as textual family E). According to the Claremont Profile Method it has mixed Byzantine text in Luke 1; in Luke 10 and Luke the manuscript is defective.|$|E

500|$|Justice Sonia Sotomayor {{delivered}} {{the opinion of}} the Court. [...] Sotomayor first noted {{that this was not a}} case of first impression, and that the court had ruled on a similar issue only seven years previously. [...] Sotomayor stated that Cherokee Nation of Okla. v. Leavitt held that when the government makes a contractual promise to pay in return for services, the government is bound to pay for those services. [...] This was a long-standing principle of contract law, dating back to Ferris, and the [...] "principle safeguards both the expectations of Government contractors and the long-term fiscal interests of the United States." [...] If the appropriation exceeds the amount of the individual contract, then the government is bound to honor the contract. [...] Sotomayor stated that although the situation that Congress placed the BIA in is frustrating, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> issue for Congress to resolve. [...] The Court affirmed the decision of the Tenth Circuit Court. [...] Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, and Elena Kagan joined Justice Sotomayor's opinion.|$|E
500|$|The {{critical}} {{response to}} The Turn of the Screw was mixed. The film was praised by Matt Baylis, writing in The Express, {{as one of}} the better adaptations of James's story. The Timess David Chater, although he did not consider the film [...] "terrifying" [...] or [...] "suppurate in evil", found it [...] "never less than absorbing", suspecting this would be particularly so for viewers unfamiliar with the story. The Daily Telegraphs Simon Horsford felt that The Turn of the Screw [...] "might not work on all levels <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> unsettling interpretation nonetheless". By contrast, Tom Sutcliffe, writing in The Independent, was unimpressed with the film, considering James's novel to have been [...] "comprehensively vandalised", while Richard Whittaker, writing in The Austin Chronicle, felt that the film was [...] "a particular and peculiar misfire" [...] from Welch. The Turn of the Screw was chosen as [...] "pick of the day" [...] in The Sunday Times, despite the reviewer, Victoria Segal, expressing her view that the film was [...] "far from perfect". But she added that the flaws could be overlooked, and although there are times [...] "when it grinds through the gears with a clunk and clatter", the [...] "spirit" [...] of James's story is retained.|$|E
500|$|My French Coach and My Spanish Coach have {{received}} generally favorable reviews from several video game publications. On Metacritic, a website that compiles scores from various video game reviews, My Spanish Coach received a 73/100, based on seven reviews. In {{a review of}} the DS versions of both games, IGN called them a [...] "great learning experience" [...] and a more entertaining alternative to traditional methods of learning French and Spanish such as [...] "ours of boring exercises and outdated videos". Eurogamer claimed the games were not substitutes for proper language lessons, but admitted that [...] "as tools for improving your language skills, whether you're starting from scratch or have some basic knowledge, they're great". In {{a review of the}} DS version of My French Coach, Nintendo World Report called the game [...] "not be the hottest game to ever sit in your DS, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> unusually polished product that achieves the edutainment holy grail – it makes learning easy and fun". During the 2007 Christmas holiday season, video game retailer GameStop recommended My Spanish Coach for [...] "The Academic Gamer".

500|$|Upon the film's {{theatrical}} release, Richard Roeper wrote, [...] "This is a {{very tough}} film to watch, especially for Beatles fans that worshipped Lennon, but it does provide a thought-provoking take on {{the inner workings of}} Mark David Chapman's twisted mind." [...] San Francisco Chronicles Joel Selvin praised Schaefer's direction writing, [...] "The film is impressively mounted and Schaefer has made a directorial debut of distinction, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> uncomfortable ride from the opening scenes of Chapman arriving in New York to the inevitable, inexorable final scene." [...] He also called Leto's performance utterly convincing. Rex Reed gave the film a positive review writing, [...] "Even if you are only moderately curious about the events that led up to the pointless death of a musical icon, I think you'll find it a film of arm-twisting fascination." [...] He praised Leto calling him unforgettable and writing, [...] "it is the pulverizing concentration and almost somnambulistic intensity of Jared Leto that gives the film its life and pulse." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B saying, [...] "Chapter 27 is far from flawless, but Leto disappears inside this angry, mouth-breathing psycho geek with a conviction that had me hanging on his every delusion." [...] Joe Neumaier of the New York Daily News described Chapter 27 as [...] "a claustrophobic drama that gets uncomfortably into the head of Mark David Chapman," [...] and praised Leto saying, [...] "Leto's drawling, blotchy, creepy performance sets it apart." ...|$|E
500|$|McVeigh was {{represented}} by a defense counsel team of six principal attorneys led by Stephen Jones. According to law professor Douglas O. Linder, McVeigh wanted Jones to present a [...] "necessity defense"—which would argue {{that he was in}} [...] "imminent danger" [...] from the government (that his bombing was intended to prevent future crimes by the government, such as the Waco and Ruby Ridge incidents). McVeigh argued that [...] "imminent" [...] does not mean [...] "immediate": [...] "If a comet is hurtling toward the earth, and it's out past the orbit of Pluto, it's not an immediate threat to Earth, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> imminent threat." [...] Despite McVeigh's wishes, Jones attempted to discredit the prosecution's case in an attempt to instill reasonable doubt. Jones also believed that McVeigh {{was part of a larger}} conspiracy, and sought to present him as [...] "the designated patsy", but McVeigh disagreed with Jones arguing that rationale for his defense. After a hearing, Judge Matsch independently ruled the evidence concerning a larger conspiracy to be too insubstantial to be admissible. In addition to arguing that the bombing could not have been carried out by two men alone, Jones also attempted to create reasonable doubt by arguing that no one had seen McVeigh near the scene of the crime, and that the investigation into the bombing had lasted only two weeks. Jones presented 25witnesses over a one-week period, including Dr. Frederic Whitehurst. Although Whitehurst described the FBI's sloppy investigation of the bombing site and its handling of other key evidence, he was unable to point to any direct evidence that he knew to be contaminated.|$|E
500|$|As cricket {{correspondent}} for the Yorkshire Post, Kilburn wrote primarily about Yorkshire County Cricket Club. His obituary in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack described his writing style: he wrote [...] "with a fountain pen on press telegram forms at 60 or 80 words a shilling. At the close of play he immediately concluded his essay; he hardly ever crossed anything out. His cricketing judgments were assured and rigorous, his style exact but sometimes elegant: Leyland's bowling is a joke <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> extremely practical joke." [...] The Times stated that his reports were [...] "always precise, frequently elegant, sometimes stern and invariably fair and accurate. He never wrote an unpolished piece or an unidentifiable one, although he was only occasionally analytical." [...] The speed and ease with which he produced his reports, and his refusal to use a typewriter—which he described as [...] "the devil's own invention"—were envied by other journalists. Kilburn's writing was printed exactly as he wrote it; sub-editors did not touch anything, {{even if he had}} made a mistake, as his employers valued his style so greatly. He refused to write about off-field events which caused consternation for his editors as Yorkshire cricket was turbulent behind the scenes at the time he wrote. Nor would he write about the wider aspects of cricket, confident that his reputation made it impossible to sack him. This attitude made him popular with the players, and he became particularly close to Len Hutton and Donald Bradman. His position at the Yorkshire Post gave him freedom to write about whatever he chose, and he refused several offers to move to national newspapers. But his obituary in The Times suggested that, had he worked for a London publication, he would have been as well-known and respected as Cardus, E. W. Swanton and R. C. Robertson-Glasgow.|$|E
