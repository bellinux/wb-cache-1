40|$|Following {{a request}} from the Commission, the Panel on Food additives, Flavourings, Processing aids and Materials in Contact with Food (AFC), was asked to update {{the opinion of the}} Scientific Committee on Food of the European Commission (SCF) on the safety in use of beeswax and to {{consider}} also in its opinion the additional use of beeswax as a carrier of flavours. Beeswax was evaluated by the SCF in 1990, which concluded that because of the paucity of experimental toxicological data it was unable to establish the full safety of this compound but considered that its use as glazing agent was temporarily acceptable. Beeswax is an authorised food additive in the European Union, permitted as a glazing agent on confectionery (excluding chocolate), small products of fine <b>bakery</b> <b>wares</b> coated with chocolate, snacks, nuts and coffee beans and for the surface treatment only of certain fruits (fresh citrus fruits, melons, apples, pears, peaches and pineapples). It is also permitted in food supplements and as a carrier for colours.

40|$|International audienceA {{method has}} been {{developed}} for estimating the content in foods of the emulsifying additive E 473, sucrose esters of fatty acids. The analytical approach taken to estimate the complex mixtures that comprise this additive involved, selective solvent extraction of the intact esters using a mixture of tetrahydrofuran and ethyl acetate, alkaline hydrolysis of the esters to liberate sucrose, and then GC-MS measurement of the liberated sucrose using GC-MS after acidic hydrolysis to glucose and fructose and then silylation. The method was developed to aid future estimates of intake of this food additive. The method determines the total sucrose esters content of a food sample and does not attempt to discrimination between individual sucrose esters when present as a mixture in a food sample. A single (average) factor is used to convert the liberated sucrose content into sucrose ester content. The method was applied to analysis of 8 different food types (including <b>bakery</b> <b>wares,</b> sugar confectionery, dairy product, margarine, meat pies and a sauce) spiked with 0. 5 to 1 % of a mixture of 3 sucrose esters that spanned the hydrophilic/lipophilic balance (HLB) range 1 - 16. The limit of quantification was around 50 mg/kg, {{which is more than}} adequate for these additives. The analytical recovery was 73 - 106 % with an average of 91 %. The precision of the method (RSD) was 6 - 18 % (n= 3 to 20 for each food type) with an average RSD of 11 %. The main analytical uncertainty is the conversion factor used to express sucrose ester content from the amount of sucrose liberated. The method is also applicable to sucroglycerides (E 474) ...|$|E
40|$|Titanium dioxide (TiO 2) is {{commonly}} applied {{to enhance the}} white colour and brightness of food products. TiO 2 is also used as white pigment in other products such as toothpaste. A {{small fraction of the}} pigment is known to be present as nanoparticles (NPs). Recent studies with TiO 2 NPs indicate that these particles can have toxic effects. In this paper, we aimed to estimate the oral intake of TiO 2 and its NPs from food, food supplements and toothpaste in the Dutch population aged 2 to over 70 years by combining data on food consumption and supplement intake with concentrations of Ti and TiO 2 NPs in food products and supplements. For children aged 2 – 6 years, additional intake via ingestion of toothpaste was estimated. The mean long-term intake to TiO 2 ranges from 0. 06 [*]mg/kg bw/day in elderly (70 +), 0. 17 [*]mg/kg bw/day for 7 – 69 -year-old people, to 0. 67 [*]mg/kg bw/day in children (2 – 6 year old). The estimated mean intake of TiO 2 NPs ranges from 0. 19 [*]μg/kg bw/day in elderly, 0. 55 [*]μg/kg bw/day for 7 – 69 -year-old people, to 2. 16 [*]μg/kg bw/day in young children. Ninety-fifth percentile (P 95) values are 0. 74, 1. 61 and 4. 16 [*]μg/kg bw/day, respectively. The products contributing most to the TiO 2 intake are toothpaste (in young children only), candy, coffee creamer, fine <b>bakery</b> <b>wares</b> and sauces. In a separate publication, the results are used to evaluate whether the presence of TiO 2 NPs in these products can pose a human health risk. </p...|$|E
40|$|Nivalenol is a {{mycotoxin}} {{produced by}} various Fusarium species. The European Commission (EC) asked the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) for a scientific {{opinion on the}} risk to human and animal health related {{to the presence of}} nivalenol in food and feed. A total of 13 164 results for nivalenol in food, feed and unprocessed grains, collected in 2001 - 2011 from 18 European countries, were available for the evaluation. The highest mean concentrations for nivalenol were observed in oats, maize, barley and wheat and products thereof. Grains and grain-based foods, in particular bread and rolls, grain milling products, pasta, fine <b>bakery</b> <b>wares</b> and breakfast cereals, made the largest contribution to nivalenol exposure for humans. Animal exposure to nivalenol is primarily from consuming cereal grains and cereal by-products. The available information on the toxicokinetics of nivalenol is incomplete. Evidence exists for metabolic de-epoxidation in some species. Based on the data available, the Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM Panel) concluded that the overall weight of evidence is that nivalenol is unlikely to be genotoxic. Toxic effects of nivalenol include immunotoxicity and haematotoxicity. A reduction in white blood cell (WBC) counts in a 90 -day rat study was identified as the critical effect for human risk assessment. Using these data and a benchmark dose analysis the CONTAM Panel established a tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 1. 2 µg/kg b. w. per day. All chronic human dietary exposures to nivalenol estimated, based on the available occurrence data in food, are below the TDI, and are therefore not a health concern. No toxicity data were identified for ruminants, rabbits, fish and companion animals but lowest-observed-adverse-effect levels were identified in pigs and poultry. Based on estimates of exposure the risk of adverse health effects of feed containing nivalenol is low for both these species...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFatty {{acid esters}} of 3 -monochloro- 1, 2 -propanediol (3 -MCPDEs), of 2 -monochloro- 1, 3 -propanediol (2 -MCPDEs) and of 2, 3 -epoxy- 1 -propanol or glycidol (GEs), which are {{considered}} to be deleterious to human health, may occur in a broad variety of food samples. A proper risk assessment of those substances requires the availability of robust occurrence data; in this respect concerns have been raised regarding the reliability of results obtained with the currently available methods to determine those substances in processed food. This article presents an indirect analytical procedure for the simultaneous determination of 3 -MCPDEs, 2 -MCPDEs and GEs {{in a wide variety of}} food products after extraction by pressurised liquid extraction (PLE) and determination by gas chromatography mass-spectrometry (GC–MS). For the differentiation of MCPDEs and GEs, the latter were first converted to monobromopropanediol esters (MBPDEs) in acid aqueous solution of sodium bromide. MCPDEs and MBPDEs were then hydrolysed under acidic conditions followed by derivatisation of the released free (non-esterified) form in ethyl acetate with phenyl boronic acid (PBA). Quantification of the analytes was carried out using the isotopic labelled analogues of both MCPDEs and GEs. Limits of detection (LODs) and limits of quantitation (LOQs) were in the range of 7 – 17 mgkg− 1 and 13 – 31 mgkg− 1 respectively, while the working range of the method was between LOQ and 1850 mgkg− 1 expressed on fat basis. The developed method was successfully applied for the analysis of the target compounds in more than 650 different food samples covering the following commodities: bread and rolls, fine <b>bakery</b> <b>wares,</b> smoked fish products, fried and roasted meat, potato based snacks and fried potato products, cereal-based snacks and margarines...|$|E
40|$|Following {{a request}} by the European Commission, the Panel of Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food (ANS) was asked to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion on the safety of sodium stearoyl- 2 -lactylate (E 481, SSL) and calcium stearoyl- 2 -lactylate (E 482, CSL) when used as food additives. SSL and CSL are used as emulsifiers and stabilizers. An Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of 20 mg/kg bw/day for SSL and CSL (either singly or in combination) was established in 1974 by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA). The Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) endorsed this ADI of 20 mg/kg bw/day in 1978. The biological fate of CSL is comparable in rodent and non-rodent species. The acute oral toxicity in rats is low. Subacute and subchronic oral toxicity studies with SSL and CSL in rats and dogs revealed a NOAEL of 5 % in the diet. Neither SSL and CSL nor their breakdown products stearic and lactic acid raise concern for genotoxicity. The NOAEL in a one-year oral toxicity study with SSL in rats was 2214 mg/kg bw/day for males and 2641 mg/kg bw/day for females. No data on reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity were available. However, no reproductive or carcinogenic effects are expected since the products of hydrolysis, stearic and lactic acid are constituents of natural food and part of endogenous metabolism in mammals. The Panel concluded that based on the NOAEL of 2200 mg/kg bw/day derived from the one-year toxicity study in rats and an uncertainty factor of 100, an ADI of 22 mg/kg bw/day for sodium stearoyl- 2 -lactylate (E 481) and calcium stearoyl- 2 -lactylate (E 482) either singly or in combination can be established. The estimated exposure to SSL and CSL occurs mainly via the consumption of flavoured fermented milk products including heat treated products, bread and rolls and fine <b>bakery</b> <b>wares</b> and is below the ADI of 22 mg/kg bw/day for all the adult population including the elderly, but exceeds the ADI for other groups of the population at mean level and for all groups of the population at high level...|$|E
40|$|In 2014, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) {{requested}} the Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM) of the Joint Research Centre (JRC) {{to develop a}} reliable analytical method for the determination of fatty acid esters of 3 -monochloropropanediol (3 -MCPDEs), of 2 -monochloropropanediol (2 -MCPDEs) and of glycidol (GEs) in a broad variety of food samples, and to test its applicability in routine on about 500 different food samples.
