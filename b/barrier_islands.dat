5|$|Offshore, several oil {{and natural}} gas rigs were {{evacuated}} due to the proximity of Earl. An estimated 10,000 workers were evacuated from both onshore and offshore rigs. The storm forced many Florida residences to evacuate, especially people living in the <b>barrier</b> <b>islands</b> along the Florida Gulf Coast. About 30 Air Force jets from Eglin Air Force Base were sent to Oklahoma to protect them from the storm. A mandatory evacuation was issued for 20,000 residents in Leon County as well as all <b>barrier</b> <b>islands</b> along the Florida coast due to the risk of substantial flooding. Franklin County was briefly under a mandatory evacuation order on September2, the reasons for the lifting of the order are unknown. State parks along the Florida Panhandle were also closed and highways became congested with thousands of residents and tourists evacuating the <b>barrier</b> <b>islands.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Lili caused great {{environmental}} {{damage to the}} marshes and <b>barrier</b> <b>islands</b> in Louisiana. Huge fish kills were observed in marshes near the landfall point, and in the Atchafalaya Swamp. The <b>barrier</b> <b>islands</b> {{to the east of}} the landfall point, those subjected to the highest surge, were severely eroded. Sand was also deposited behind them into the brackish marshes, burying vegetation. The freshwater marshes were severely damaged by the wind and surge, some of them completely destroyed. The severe erosion created new waterways connecting inland bodies of water with the Gulf of Mexico, which eventually led to further erosion of inland lagoons.|$|E

5|$|Hog Island was colonized in the 17th century. The sheep that colonists {{would have}} been using at the time {{would have been}} the {{contemporary}} English breeds, but Merinos were known to roam the <b>barrier</b> <b>islands,</b> taken there by Spanish ships that wrecked and let the sheep loose. The colonists would have used some combination of these sheep in their flocks.|$|E
5|$|In 1776, Indians at the Bahia {{missions}} {{told the}} soldiers that the Karankawas had massacred {{a group of}} Europeans who had been shipwrecked {{near the mouth of}} the Guadalupe River. After finding the remains of an English commercial frigate, the soldiers warned the Karankawa to refrain from attacking seamen. The soldiers continued to explore the coast, and reported that foreign powers could easily build a small settlement on the <b>barrier</b> <b>islands,</b> which were difficult to access from the mainland, and then ascend the Trinity or San Jacinto Rivers into the heart of Texas. Captain Luis Cazorla, the commander of the La Bahía presidio, recommended that Spain build a small fort on the <b>barrier</b> <b>islands</b> and provide a shallow-draft vessel to continually reconnoiter the coast. The fort would be both a deterrent to the more bloodthirsty tribes and to the English. The Spanish government, fearful of smuggling, declined to give permission for a port or a boat on the Texas coast.|$|E

5|$|Hilton Head Island is {{sometimes}} referred to as the second largest <b>barrier</b> <b>island</b> on the Eastern Seaboard after Long Island (which is not actually a <b>barrier</b> <b>island</b> but two glacial moraines). Technically, however, Hilton Head Island is only a half <b>barrier</b> <b>island.</b> The north end of the island is a sea island dating to the Pleistocene epoch, and the south end is a <b>barrier</b> <b>island</b> that appeared as recently as the Holocene epoch. Broad Creek, which is actually a land-locked tidal marsh, separates the two halves of the island.|$|R
5|$|It is {{also found}} in brackish-water {{habitats}} and is sometimes seen swimming in salt water. It has been much more successful at colonizing Atlantic and Gulf coast <b>barrier</b> <b>islands</b> than the copperhead. However, even on these islands, it tends to favor freshwater marshes. A study by Dunson and Freda (1985) describes it as not being particularly salt-tolerant.|$|E
5|$|June 11, 2005– Tropical Storm Arlene strikes {{just west}} of Pensacola, {{bringing}} moderate precipitation throughout the state and causing breaches on <b>barrier</b> <b>islands</b> on the Florida Panhandle.

5|$|Damage was {{minor in}} {{southeast}} North Carolina. Moderate winds inflicted isolated shingle and siding damage along <b>barrier</b> <b>islands.</b> The winds downed several trees, some onto cars and houses. Brief power outages were also reported. Beach erosion damaged a bridge in Bald Head Island, as well. In Chowan County, a business {{parking lot was}} under several feet of water due to flash flooding. One person was indirectly killed in Carteret County when trying to restore electricity.|$|E
5|$|Lili caused {{extensive}} damage through the Caribbean, particularly to crops and poorly built homes. Mudslides were common {{on the more}} mountainous islands, particularly Haiti and Jamaica. In the United States, the storm cut off the production of oil within the Gulf of Mexico, and caused severe damage in parts of Louisiana. Lili was also responsible for severe damage to the <b>barrier</b> <b>islands</b> and marshes in the southern portion of the state. Total damage amounted to $925million (2002USD), and the storm killed 15people during its existence.|$|E
5|$|Governor Mark Sanford {{declared}} a state of emergency as Charley approached landfall and issued a mandatory evacuation for residents on <b>barrier</b> <b>islands</b> and in coastal locations in Georgetown and Horry Counties. In Georgetown County, this order was focused on residents and tourists east of U.S. Route 17, likewise for Horry County. 180,000people evacuated the Grand Strand. Drawbridges in Beaufort and Charleston Counties were shut down, and bridges in Georgetown and Horry Counties were locked down. Hampton County requested 2,000sandbags, that were provided by the Department of Corrections. The Wateree Correctional Institution also filled 30,000sandbags for potential floods. State troopers directed traffic inland from Myrtle Beach. U.S. Route 501 used a lane reversal to allow for evacuations.|$|E

50|$|Cook’s petrel breeds only in New Zealand {{on three}} small islands: Little <b>Barrier</b> <b>Island,</b> Great <b>Barrier</b> <b>Island,</b> and Codfish Island. The {{breeding}} season is the southern summer, October-May. It nests in burrows and rock crevices, preferring sites on thickly forested ridges. The species was formerly more numerous; the current population estimate is 1,258,000 and declining. It {{is classified as}} vulnerable because it breeds on only three small <b>islands.</b> While Little <b>Barrier</b> <b>Island's</b> population remains stable, the other two populations are decreasing. On Great <b>Barrier</b> <b>Island,</b> introduced pigs, dogs, rats and cats attack nests and burrows, as do native weka (a flightless rail), preying on eggs and nestlings and reducing the population from an estimated 20,000 to 100.|$|R

5|$|Lying {{within a}} coastal plain, the St. Johns River passes through {{an area that}} was at one time <b>barrier</b> <b>islands,</b> coastal dunes, and estuary marshes. The Florida Peninsula was created {{primarily}} by forces and minerals from the ocean. It lies so low that minor fluctuations in sea levels can have a dramatic effect on its geomorphology. Florida was once part of the supercontinent Gondwana. Lying underneath the visible rock formations is a basement of igneous granite and volcanic composition under a sedimentary layer formed during the Paleozoic era 542 to 251 million years ago. During the Cretaceous period (145 to 66 million years ago), the basement and its sedimentary overlay were further covered by calcium carbonate and formations left by the evaporation of water called evaporites. What covers the peninsula {{is the result of}} simultaneous processes of deposits of sands, shells, and coral, and erosion from water and weather. As ocean water has retreated and progressed, the peninsula has been covered with sea water at least seven times. Waves compressed sands, calcium carbonate, and shells into limestone; at the ocean's edge, beach ridges were created by this depositional forming. North-south axis rivers, such as the St. Johns, were created by past beach ridges which were often divided by swales. As ocean water retreated, lagoons formed in the swales, which were further eroded by acidic water. <b>Barrier</b> <b>islands,</b> furthermore, formed along the Atlantic Coast, surrounding the lagoon with land and forming a freshwater river.|$|E
5|$|The Banker {{horse is}} a breed of feral horse (Equus ferus caballus) living on <b>barrier</b> <b>islands</b> in North Carolina's Outer Banks. It is small, hardy, {{and has a}} docile temperament. Descended from domesticated Spanish horses and {{possibly}} brought to the Americas in the 16th century, the ancestral foundation bloodstock may have become feral after surviving shipwrecks or being abandoned on the islands {{by one of the}} exploratory expeditions led by Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón or Sir Richard Grenville. Populations are found on Ocracoke Island, Shackleford Banks, Currituck Banks, and in the Rachel Carson Estuarine Sanctuary.|$|E
5|$|The National Park Service (NPS) {{acquired}} {{the island in}} 1972 and declared it the Cumberland Island National Seashore. Since then, few new horses have been introduced to the island, though four Arabians were introduced in the early 1990s {{in the hopes of}} diversifying and bettering the existing population. Since 1981, the NPS has been monitoring the horses and tracking their impact on the environment. In 1991, an outbreak of eastern equine encephalitis killed about 40 horses, or approximately 18% of the herd. The population on Cumberland Island is one of seven feral horse herds on US <b>barrier</b> <b>islands.</b>|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} storm warning was issued {{at some point}} during the existence of the cyclone for the west coast of Florida from Key West to Apalachicola. Additionally, a {{tropical storm}} warning was put in place for the east coast from Vero Beach northward to Fernandina Beach. Before the arrival of Marco, elementary schools were closed on the three <b>barrier</b> <b>islands</b> in Lee County. Florida governor Bob Martinez ordered the closure of state offices in the Tampa Bay area, and also decided not to open the University of South Florida and nearby community colleges. Public schools were not opened on the day of the storm's passage in Manatee and Sarasota counties, though most other schools remained open. As the storm tracked northward, the National Weather Service issued a flood watch for much of Georgia. A flood watch was later issued for western portions of the Carolinas and for high elevations in Virginia and West Virginia.|$|E
5|$|About 19hours before landfall, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm warning from Apalachicola to Venice, Florida, which was preceded by {{a tropical storm}} watch six hours prior. As the storm intensified further, the NHC issued a hurricane warning from Apalachicola to Anclote Key, and extended the tropical storm warning westward to Fort Walton Beach. The agency later issued a tropical storm warning for the Atlantic coast from Cape Canaveral to Little River Inlet in South Carolina. Officials ordered evacuations for <b>barrier</b> <b>islands</b> in nine Florida counties along the gulf coast, and about 3,000people stayed in shelters. Government offices closed along the storm's projected path in the state. Later, the storm forced the cancellation of part of Bob Dole's bus tour through New York, and postponed {{a search for the}} wreck of TWA Flight 800. Game one of the 1996 World Series was postponed by one day due to the storm.|$|E
5|$|Advisories, {{along with}} {{coordination}} between the National Observatory at Havana and U.S. Weather Bureau, were credited for the reduced deaths in Cuba.

On October 25, the cyclone's hurricane force winds {{were expected to}} remain off the Florida east coast, although gale-force winds were anticipated from the Florida Keys to Palm Beach, Florida. Accordingly, storm warnings were issued from Key West, Florida to Vero Beach, Florida. Military aircraft were transported to safer locations, while watercraft were stored in harbors and rivers. Hotels and resorts were boarded up on the <b>barrier</b> <b>islands.</b> The Bahamas received warnings {{well in advance of}} the hurricane.
