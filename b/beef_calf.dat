Choose the calf from the best cow, and raise it with purpose in view that {{it is to be a}} better cow than its mother. The young cow that is not better than its mother has not been raised right. Naturally, all calves of a herd are treated about the same, the dairy calf gets the same care as the <b>beef</b> <b>calf,</b> or on the other hand, the <b>beef</b> <b>calf</b> is treated just like the dairy calf. This is a mistake. In raising a <b>beef</b> <b>calf,</b> meat is the object, and the quicker that a pound of meat can be put on, the cheaper it will be. In raising the dairy calf, she must be kept in a good growing condition. There must not be an accumulation of fat; for muscle, bone, and a good constitution, coupled with strong digestion are what is wanted in the dairy cow. The difference in treatment should be more marked at the age of 12 to 18 months than before, as flesh is more rapidly accumulated at that time, and is more likely to injure her as a dairy heifer. As has been shown at the Iowa Experiment Station, and elsewhere, the heifer shows a little greater tendency to easy fattening and early maturity than the steer under the same conditions, therefore, the treatment of the two must be different. Excessive development of the flesh-forming function almost always takes place at the expense of the milk production. A liberal amount of bulky feed should be given to the heifer, to stimulate the growth of a roomy digestive tract. The good dairy cow must be able to digest a large amount of food, that she may produce accordingly. She must have plenty of lung capacity, in order to purify the large amount of blood that is necessary in the digestion of her food and in the secretion of milk. She may be considered as a machine into which we can safely feed our corn and alfalfa, and have them converted into milk and butter...|$|E

In broad terms, farmers have two options for finishing these animals; as bulls or steers. In either case, Irish beef cattle systems are based on maximising lifetime live-weight gain from grass-based diets. Managing the relationship between the supply and demand for grazed grass is complicated in these pasture-based systems due to the seasonal variability in grass growth. The Grange Dairy Beef Systems Model (GDBSM) was used to simulate the relationship between grazed grass supply and demand and then determine the profitability of Holstein-Friesian male animals finished as bulls at 16 (B 16), 19 (B 19) and 22 (B 22) months of age and steers at 24 (S 24) months of age. Combinations of these cattle finishing options were also evaluated. The most profitable system was S 24.

Furthermore, no research has examined the effect of weaning stress on leukocyte immunophenotypes expressing selected differentiation antigens and the functional activity of neutrophils in calves. A series of studies were conducted to investigate i) the effect of weaning strategy (at pasture or housing) on the extended physiological and immunological responses of calves, ii) the effect of weaning and subsequent housing on physiological and immunological responses of cows and iii) the effect of weaning on leukocyte immunophenotypes and neutrophil activity of calves. Results indicate that weaning in combination with immediate housing decreased total leukocyte numbers, reduced in vitro production of interferon-gamma and increased concentrations of acute phase proteins compared with deferring housing for 35 days post weaning. In cows, transitory neutrophilia (increase in neutrophil number) and lymphopenia (decrease in lymphocyte number), reduced interferon-γ production, and increased concentrations of acute phase proteins were evident post weaning, whereas post-housing, changes were less marked. Weaning caused neutrophilia and impaired the functionality of these cells to traffic and efficiently phagocytise bacteria up to 7 days post weaning. Altered lymphocyte subsets and MHC Class II+ cell percentage were evident in weaned and non-weaned calves on day 2 post-weaning, however the magnitude of change was greater in weaned calves. Thus, there is a greater transitory reduction in immune function biomarkers in calves immediately post weaning. These immune biomarkers may be used in the future to help identify animals susceptible to weaning stress and that are more likely to succumb to respiratory infection...|$|E

Lactating crossbred cows with calves and non-pregnant, non-lactating Boer-cross nannies were {{used to evaluate the}} effects of co-grazing on herbivory patterns and animal performance while grazing native tallgrass rangeland infested heavily by sericea lespedeza (SL). The proportion of individual SL plants that had been grazed {{at the end of the}} trial was greater (P < 0. 01) in co-grazed pastures than in single-species pastures. Grazing cows and goats in combination increased (P < 0. 01) grazing pressure on SL without negatively affecting beef cow performance, <b>beef</b> <b>calf</b> performance, or residual forage biomass. Angus × cows and heifers grazing native range were used to evaluate the effects of pre-partum corn steep liquor supplementation on postpartum beef cow and calf performance. Under the conditions of our study, CSL supplementation did not generally promote beef cow and calf performance that was equivalent to supplementation with an isonitrogenous, dry, corn-soy alternative. Cow calf pairs were used to evaluate the effects of grazing system (GS) and stocking rate (SR) on cow and calf performance. Late season rest-rotation (LSRR) was compared with continuous (CONT) grazing at low, moderate, and high SR. Under the conditions of our study, CONT produced consistently better (P < 0. 01) late-season cow and calf performance than LSRR. Season-long effects of SR on animal performance were minimal; moreover, GS and SR treatments produced equivalent pregnancy rates...|$|E
40|$|If {{the object}} of the game is to do what one enjoys while making {{outstanding}} margin, we in the cow business have enjoyed one of the greatest opportunities in decades. Even though drought has made it an unequal distribution, and disease and politics have added considerable confusion, turning grass and other feed stuffs into marketable calves has been good. We have had challenges to enhance value for specific markets with new technologies. We have seen our aged cow and bull markets influenced heavily by border issues as well as premium meat markets disrupted by embargos and restrictions. Feed price has begun to make a major sort of production systems. However “good” calves produced in economically viable systems have been highly profitable. We have been asked to discuss how we endeavor to create and capture value in <b>beef</b> <b>calf</b> production. In summary, we attempt to maximize revenue by creating measurable or perceived value to the grow out and finishing segments, while knowing what input costs produce the greatest margin potential and reducing those costs which are not contributors. We will try to share with you some of our thoughts in these areas, while openly admitting we are learning every year and have much to do to stay competitive with this dynamic industry. I should mention that, as every production system, we operate within certain constraints and enjoy some specific opportunities in the southeast corner of Wyoming. Our diversification with both dry land and irrigated crop production puts labor constraints on the April through August time frame and summer pastures are five to two hundred miles from the headquarters. We calve heifers by the barn in January and calve cows February 1 to March 15, run the cows on cropland aftermath fall and spring, with pairs on summer pasture from April 15 to October sometime. We have high per head transportation costs but utilize trucks necessary in our crop production...|$|E
40|$|Beef Cattle Research, 2011 {{is known}} as Cattlemen’s Day, 2011 The use of {{artificial}} insemination (AI) in the dairy industry grew tremendously in the 1940 s and has since become the industry norm. Adoption of AI in the beef industry has been much slower {{largely due to the}} more extensive nature of beef production systems. Improvements in protocols to synchronize estrus and ovulation now allow beef producers to achieve high pregnancy rates to AI with no heat detection and value-driven marketing programs have provided more incentive for use of high-accuracy genetics. The 2007 USDA National Animal Health Monitoring Surveillance survey reports the proportion of beef operations that use AI is only 7. 6 %. However, adoption of AI in herds of 200 head or greater was 19. 8 % compared to 5. 6 % and 8. 4 % for herd sizes of 1 to 49 and 50 to 99 head, respectively, indicating larger operations are more likely to adopt this technology. Little information is available concerning changes in semen use over time in the beef industry and what this may reflect about the adoption of AI by beef producers. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine trends in domestic, custom frozen, and export sales of semen over time and how these trends relate to <b>beef</b> feeder <b>calf</b> prices and cow inventories...|$|R
40|$|A {{large number}} of cycloSal-nucleotide triesters 1 - 49 have been studied {{concerning}} their ability to inhibit cholinesterases of different origins {{as well as to}} inhibit HIV replication in cell culture. It was shown that none of the triesters showed inhibitory effects against human acetylcholinesterase (AChE; isolated enzyme) as well as against AChE from <b>beef</b> erythrocytes and <b>calf</b> serum. In contrast, inhibition of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) has been observed for some triesters in human and mouse serum. cycloSal pronucleotides showed strong competitive inhibition with respect to the substrate acetylcholine chloride (K(i) /K(m) : approximately 2 x 10 (- 5)) and acted by time-dependent irreversible inhibition of the human serum BChE. Detailed studies demonstrated that the inhibitory effect against BChE is dependent on the nucleoside analogue, the substitution pattern of the cycloSal-moiety, and particularly on the stereochemistry at the phosphorus atom. Structural requirements to avoid the inhibition of BChE by cycloSal-nucleotide triesters have been elucidated in the reported study. status: publishe...|$|R
