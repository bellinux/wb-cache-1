40|$|In fusion reactors, the <b>blanket</b> {{design and}} its {{characteristics}} {{have a major}} impact on the reactor performance, size, and economics. The selection and arrangement of the <b>blanket</b> materials, dimensions of the different <b>blanket</b> zones, and different requirements of the selected materials for a satisfactory performance are the main parameters, which define the <b>blanket</b> performance. These parameters translate to a large number of variables and design constraints, which need to be simultaneously considered in the <b>blanket</b> design process. This represents a major design challenge because of the lack of a comprehensive design tool capable of considering all these variables to define the optimum <b>blanket</b> design and satisfying all the design constraints for the adopted figure of merit and the <b>blanket</b> design criteria. The <b>blanket</b> design techniques of the First Wall/Blanket/Shield Design and Optimization System (BSDOS) have been developed to overcome this difficulty and to provide the state-of-the-art techniques and tools for performing <b>blanket</b> design and analysis. This report describes some of the BSDOS techniques and demonstrates its use. In addition, the use of the optimization technique of the BSDOS can result in a significant <b>blanket</b> performance enhancement and cost saving for the reactor design under consideration. In this report, examples are presented, which utilize an earlier version of the ITER solid breeder <b>blanket</b> design and a high power density self-cooled lithium <b>blanket</b> design for demonstrating some of the BSDOS <b>blanket</b> design techniques...|$|R

40|$|A laboratory-scale reactor {{was used}} to {{simulate}} a water treatment process sequence of rapid mix, hydraulic flocculation, upflow clarification with a floc <b>blanket,</b> and lamellar sedimentation to accomplish removal of colloidal particles. This process sequence, followed by chlorination, has been employed to create affordable designs for water treatment in the Global South. This study focused on variables affecting performance of the floc <b>blanket</b> including: condition of hydraulic flocculation, raw water turbidity, coagulant dose, upflow velocity through the floc <b>blanket,</b> floc <b>blanket</b> height, and bulk density and solids concentration of the floc <b>blanket.</b> An upflow clarifier velocity between 90 - 110 m/day produced the best floc <b>blanket</b> performance for most influent turbidities studied. The results show that particle removal efficiency in lamellar sedimentation improved linearly with respect to floc <b>blanket</b> heights up to 45 cm. Improved performance is also correlated with increased hydraulic flocculator residence time and energy dissipation rate. At floc <b>blanket</b> heights above 45 cm, there is still improvement in performance for most cases, but improved performance and <b>blanket</b> height no longer follow a linear relationship. Lamellar sedimentation with a capture velocity of 10 m/day is a key component in improving clarifier performance when utilizing a floc <b>blanket.</b> Future {{studies are needed to}} determine mechanisms of particle removal in a floc <b>blanket.</b> ii...|$|R

Cat pelts have been used for superstitious purposes as part of the practise of witchcraft, and are still made into <b>blankets</b> in Switzerland as folk remedies believed to help rheumatism.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{movement}} of material which accumulates on the image printing <b>blanket</b> of a web offset press printing newsprint. A theory is advanced to explain this movement. It {{is based on the}} differences in velocities of the paper and <b>blanket</b> surfaces entering and exiting the printing nip. The designed experiment run uses three factors to test the changes in direction and rate of movement. These are: (1) the compressibility of <b>blanket</b> sets, (2) the relative image printing and impression <b>blanket</b> diameters, and (3) the printing squeeze. No other factors involved in the nip area are tested. The movement of material on the <b>blanket</b> surface is recorded using stroboscopic photography on 35 mm transparency film. The photographs record the positions of material on the <b>blanket</b> every 150 impressions. Analysis of the recorded movement is made by projection of the successive images. Results of statistical tests indicate that the relative diameters of the image printing and impression cylinders can influence the direction of movement. Movement is forward when the image printing <b>blanket</b> is less than the impression <b>blanket</b> and backwards when the image printing <b>blanket</b> is greater than the impression <b>blanket.</b> When printing with unequal diameters, the compressible <b>blanket</b> set produces less movement than the non-compressible set. These results support the theory advanced...|$|R

5|$|Navajo {{textiles}} {{were originally}} utilitarian <b>blankets</b> {{for use as}} cloaks, dresses, saddle <b>blankets,</b> and similar purposes. Toward {{the end of the}} 19th century, weavers began to make rugs for tourism and export. Typical Navajo textiles have strong geometric patterns. They are a flat tapestry-woven textile produced in a fashion similar to kilims of Eastern Europe and Western Asia, but with some notable differences. In Navajo weaving, the slit weave technique common in kilims is not used, and the warp is one continuous length of yarn, not extending beyond the weaving as fringe. Traders from the late 19th and early 20th century encouraged adoption of some kilim motifs into Navajo designs.|$|E
5|$|Soyuz TM-9 {{launched}} EO-6 {{crew members}} Anatoly Solovyev and Aleksandr Balandin on 11 February 1990. While docking, the EO-5 crew noted that three thermal <b>blankets</b> on the ferry were loose, potentially creating problems on reentry, {{but it was}} decided that they would be manageable. Their stay on board Mir saw the addition of the Kristall module, launched 31 May 1990. The first docking attempt on 6 June was aborted due to an attitude control thruster failure. Kristall arrived at the front port on 10 June and was relocated to the lateral port opposite Kvant-2 the next day, restoring the equilibrium of the complex. Due to the delay in the docking of Kristall, EO-6 was extended by 10 days to permit the activation of the module‚Äôs systems and to accommodate an EVA to repair the loose thermal <b>blankets</b> on Soyuz TM-9.|$|E

5|$|The army sent about 800soldiers to Toronto {{to assist}} with the cleanup, {{providing}} <b>blankets</b> and mattresses. Toronto residents helped out with the relief effort: the Salvation Army received so many donations of clothes, footwear, <b>blankets,</b> food, and money that its storage facilities were overfilled, forcing it to advise against further donations until they were needed. A Hurricane Relief Fund was established to coordinate financial donations, ultimately raising about $5.3million (CAD). The fund received donations from organisations, companies, and individuals including Pope Pius XII, the Ford Motor Company of Canada, the United Church of Canada, Laura Secord Candy Shops, and the British-American Oil Company. A portion of the fund was set aside as a contingency reserve in the event of unresolved claims and also toward administrative expenses.|$|E

50|$|A space <b>blanket</b> (depending on the function, {{also known}} as a Mylar <b>blanket,</b> first aid <b>blanket,</b> safety <b>blanket,</b> thermal <b>blanket,</b> weather <b>blanket,</b> or heat sheet) is an {{especially}} low-weight, low-bulk <b>blanket</b> made of heat-reflective thin plastic sheeting. They are used on the exterior surfaces of spacecraft for thermal control as well as by people. Their design reduces the heat loss in a person's body which would otherwise occur due to thermal radiation, water evaporation, or convection. Their compact size before unfurling and light weight makes them ideal when space is at a premium. They may be included in first aid kits and also in camping equipment. Lost campers and hikers have an additional possible benefit: the metallic surface appearance flashes in the sun, allowing use as an improvised distress beacon for searchers.|$|R
