25|$|In principle, the Life {{field is}} infinite, but {{computers}} have finite memory. This leads to problems when the active area encroaches {{on the border}} of the array. Programmers have used several strategies to address these problems. The simplest strategy is simply to assume that every cell outside the array is dead. This is easy to program, but leads to inaccurate results when the active area crosses the boundary. A more sophisticated trick is to consider the left and right edges of the field to be stitched together, and the top and bottom edges also, yielding a toroidal array. The result is that active areas that move across a field edge reappear at the opposite edge. Inaccuracy can still result if the pattern grows too large, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>there</b> are no pathological edge effects. Techniques of dynamic storage allocation may also be used, creating ever-larger arrays to hold growing patterns.|$|E

He praised the character development, specifically for Coulson and Skye, {{and the introduction}} of Hall/Graviton, but criticized Quinn as [...] "barely a step above a generic Miami Vice villain and whose motives would be totally uninteresting if they were ever made clear to us". He also found Dalton to be [...] "the latest in a line of dull Whedon hunks with just a glimmer of personality." [...] The Guardians Graeme Virtue felt that [...] "If Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. hasn't been levitating your boat so far, this breezy episode probably didn't do that much to change your mind.

40|$|The {{main subject}} of this {{bachelor}} thesis is the change of Portugal during the years 1974 - 1986. In the beginning there was the transition from authoritarian to democratic regime. Major political and economical reforms were started. There was also a change of direction in the foreign policy. Portugal resigned on keeping colonial empire, which had been very expensive, and started to focus on Europe - and especially the European Communities. This thesis examines the influence of political and economical transition on the running integration process {{and the influence of}} European Communities on the process of democratization and economical reforms (in Portugal). The last point of the main subject of the thesis is Portugal's entry to the European Communities.

40|$|Abstract In {{the early}} 2000 ’s the idea about digital {{pervasive}} gaming was somewhat limited, {{as there was}} a lot of technological obstacles, which made implementing pervasive elements into practical use either difficult or expensive. Pervasive games could mean, that if you wanted to play them you would have to have a plethora of different devices with you, depending of if you needed a GPS for navigation, laptop for data search or just some contraption for virtual reality or just a camera to take photos with. And on the top of that, accessing the internet on the go was, if not impossible, potentially very expensive and not necessarily easy, depending on your location. Gradually the technology has begun to evolve in more versatile direction. Today a good cellphone can replace most of the devices that were cumbersome to lug around ten years ago. 3 G and 4 G internet connections can provide an access to the internet so, that it is possible to access the data sources almost anywhere, were you in the city or in a forest. Of course there’s still gaps in the networks, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>there’s</b> lesser need to find a phone outlet. Pervasive gaming is not just for location based outdoors activity anymore. Thanks to the advancements of technology elements enabling pervasive gaming have also found their way to home game consoles, MMO games and many kinds of social platform games. Pervasive games come in many different shapes and forms. The elements used can be simple social interaction, where the player informs the social network when the game is played or what kind of achievements is done in the game, thus trying to lure in more gamers or they can be more massive style of a games, where not only social activity is a must, but also where and when the game is played has an effect as well. The game can use specialized controllers, such as motion or voice or the player can just simply stream the gameplay to the web, enabling others to spectate and comment the gameplay. The designers need to ask themselves what kind of features they want to use and what kind of devices the players need in order to use these kind of pervasive features. There are also questions of the player security, be it actual physical wellbeing of the player on the real life location of the game or information security of the data gathered during the game. This thesis tries to provide some theoretical insight on what pervasive gaming has been, is now and where it is heading. There are some speculation about how pervasive elements should be designed and used as well points the designers should take a note of...|$|R

40|$|Fortified {{farms and}} other {{fortified}} sites were {{a key component}} of the Late Antique landscapes of North Africa. Their presence has been noted in all the Roman provinces in North Africa and in areas beyond the frontier such as the Garamantian heartlands of Fazzan (south-west Libya). Eight broad morphological types are proposed and are the basis for a review of the distribution of rural fortifications from all major archaeological surveys. There are strong regional preferences (e. g. fortified villages in Numidia, temples and mausolea converted into block houses in the Tunisian steppe and fortified churches in Cyrenaica). However, in almost all areas fortified sites were important elements in the settlement hierarchy and in Tripolitania and Fazzan, for instance, they were the dominant settlement form. The earliest constructions have been dated to the 2 nd century AD and their development continued into the Islamic period, <b>but.</b> In Libya <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>there</b> was a peak in construction in the 4 th century.

40|$|The {{election}} campaign {{has once again}} exposed flaws in state-federal relations, writes DAVID BURCHELL WHEN someone else’s child runs around at our kid’s birthday party, trashing the decorations, we’re inclined to accuse them of “attention-seeking behaviour’. If cities could be accused of attention-seeking behaviour, Sydney would be chief suspect. Every NSW {{election campaign}} becomes dominated by what you could call “Sydney problems. ” Sydney’s public transport is inadequate and antiquated, roads are too narrow and the traffic too slow, property taxes are exorbitant and house values unaffordable, lawns are brown and parched, and so on ad infinitum. Since Sydney is the richest city in the country, and its citizens are blessed {{with some of the}} most robust property-values in the developed world, this endless litany of complaint can become tiring. In point of fact, Sydney’s snuffles often feel more like the flu elsewhere. The trains may run late in Sydney, but across parts of western NSW they’re tearing up the rail lines. Sydney lawns may be browning, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>there’s</b> drinkable water to be had. Yet in this NSW election <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> Sydney has no good reason to be centre-stage. Perhaps its citizens should stop throwing around pieces of birthday-cake, and settle down for a stint at “pin the tail on the donkey” or the three-legged race. NSW Labor has an eight-seat buffer between government and a hung parliament. And yet, as ABC election analyst Antony Green points out, five of Labor’s eight most marginal seats - Tweed, Monaro, Port Stephens, Kiama and Gosford - are far distant from the Emerald City. The remaining three are all on the city’s southern and western fringes. There’s not a grid-locked inner-city burgh among them. If a single theme connects most of these eight seats, it’s that they are places of refuge for people who’ve moved from Sydney itself, either seeking the proverbial “seachange” (Port Stephens, Gosford), or else moving into blissful retirement (Tweed, Kiama), or just looking for some land on the city fringe they can afford to buy (Penrith, Wollondilly, Camden). In short, it’s the gap between the services people are used to in the Big Smoke, and what they find when they move elsewhere, that makes for that potent and appealing swinging-voter aroma. In any case, most of the key neglected areas in NSW policy-making are genuine state-wide problems, and not particular to Sydney. The prison population has doubled in NSW over the last decade or so. Yet NSW lags in new ideas about alternative forms of custody, and it’s hard to trial new initiatives in a policy area colonised by talkback radio callers. According to many who work in the area, a key cause of the state’s bulging prisons is the still-unresolved disaster-area of mental health policy. Ever since the populations of the state’s mental hospitals were shown the street in the name of “deinstitutionalisation,” the state has seen an increasing coincidence between violent crime and mental illness. Some suggest that as many as half of all those imprisoned in NSW may have a pre-existing mental health condition of some sort. Others claim that - in lieu of anything better - the jails have become the new asylums. New premier Morris Iemma has spoken of mental health as one of his priority policies, and has dedicated new money to treatment and diagnosis. But it’s a malaise that may take decades to turn around. Time and again NSW lags in measures of public schooling outcomes. Yet the Carr government’s answer to disenchanted middle-class parents was more places for their kids in resource-hogging selective schools - which only serves to worsen the plight of struggling comprehensives. It’s still not clear how, if at all, Iemma plans to deal with this legacy. State opposition leader Peter Debnam has rumbled on at length about the supposed crisis of the NSW economy, offering confidently if vaguely to “fix the mess”. Yet many of the problems that afflict the NSW economy are out of the control of state government. State revenues have been mortgaged to property values, which themselves have danced to the tune of federal macroeconomic policy. On the evidence of the last few decades, federal governments make better economic managers, yet services are often better delivered at local and regional levels. The resulting imbalance between resources and delivery tends to stymie much useful policy debate - particularly in NSW. New models of school management and funding, new health and “wellness” strategies, innovative approaches to mental health - all languish in a kind of policy purgatory. And this in turn makes for tedious, frustrating election campaigns, where all the sound and fury is directed towards problems that are often insoluble at the state level, while genuine state priorities are neglected. No wonder both the NSW premier and opposition leader seem almost continuously to wear puzzled expressions on their faces. It’s as if governing NSW is a joke to which they’re yet to hear the punch-line. • David Burchell teaches in Humanities at the University of Western Sydney, and is associate editor of APO.

Whether it were the monarch himself, or some famous British admiral or general, or the governor of the province, or perchance the favorite daughter of the ship-owner, there the image stood above the prow, decked out in gorgeous colors, magnificently gilded, and staring the whole world out of countenance, as if from an innate consciousness of its own superiority. These specimens of native sculpture had crossed the sea in all directions, and been not ignobly noticed among the crowded shipping of the Thames and wherever else the hardy mariners of New England had pushed their adventures. It must be confessed that a family likeness pervaded these respectable progeny of Drowne's skill; that the benign countenance of the king resembled those of his subjects, and that Miss Peggy Hobart, the merchant's daughter, bore a remarkable similitude to Britannia, Victory, and other ladies of the allegoric sisterhood; and, finally, that they all had a kind of wooden aspect which proved an intimate relationship with the unshaped blocks of timber in the carver's workshop. <b>But</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>there</b> was no inconsiderable skill of hand, nor a deficiency of any attribute to render them really works of art, except that deep quality, be it of soul or intellect, which bestows life upon the lifeless and warmth upon the cold, and which, had it been present, would have made Drowne's wooden image instinct with spirit.|$|E

It is, in all but name, indistinguishable from operations research (usually referred to as OR), which has been defined as “ (1) the application of scientific method (2) by interdisciplinary teams (3) to problems involving the control of organized (man-machine) systems so as to provide solutions which best serve the purpose of the organization as a whole. ”l In this process {{it may be necessary to}} collect vast masses of data on the operations being considered, to establish unit costs or times, and to use the various other techniques of work-study; it will probably be necessary to devise some kind of model or simulation of various processes which are integral to the operation; but the one inescapable task in every OR study is to try to define, in quantifiable terms, the objectives of the organization as a whole. It may not be possible to light upon one final, all-embracing objective; <b>but</b> <b>at</b> the very <b>least</b> <b>there</b> must be intermediate objectives which, taken together, will meet a large part of this need.
