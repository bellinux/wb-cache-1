40|$|Conjunctival graft {{has been}} {{frequently}} {{used in the}} field of ophthalmology. The frequently used methods to attach a conjunctival graft are suture technique and the use of fibrin glue. This study was to investigate <b>albumin</b> <b>glue</b> as an alternative to suture technique in attaching conjunctival grafts in rabbits. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the conjunctival wound healing between <b>albumin</b> <b>glue</b> and suture technique in rabbit eye as a model. This was an experimental animal study that included 32 eyes (16 rabbits) conducted at PT. Bio Farma (Persero) and the Histology Laboratory, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Padjadjaran from March 2014 to July 2104. The subjects in this study were divided into <b>albumin</b> <b>glue</b> group and suture technique group. The examinations were comparison of conjunctival graft attachment and histologic microscopic examination to assess the wound gap. Data analysis was performed statistically using Mann-Whitney test for small sample. The statistical analysis results showed that the graft attachment was significantly better when using <b>albumin</b> <b>glue</b> (grade 4) compared to suture (grade 2 – 3) on day- 1 after surgery (p= 0. 000). The wound gap was smaller using <b>albumin</b> <b>glue</b> (0 - 0, 33 µm versus 5, 33 - 14 µm; p 0. 0005) 10 minutes after surgery and 0 µm versus 0. 33 – 4 µm, p 0, 0005, on day- 7 after surgery. In conclusion, graft attachment using albumi n glue is better and the wound gap is smaller when using <b>albumin</b> <b>glue</b> compared to the suture technique. [MKB. 2016; 48 (4) : 241 – 8...|$|R

Using {{data from a}} national cohort, we investigated outcomes with different preservation methods after adult lung transplantation. MethodsEarly (30 -day), late (30 -day to 3 -year), and overall (3 -year) mortalities, adjusted for differences in donor and recipient characteristics, were compared by using Cox regression. Intensive care unit length of stay {{and the number of}} rejection episodes were secondary outcomes. ResultsSix hundred eighty-one eligible lung transplantations between July 1995 and June 2003 were preserved with Euro–Collins solution (n = 284), <b>blood</b> <b>albumin</b> (n = 139), core cooling (n = 107), or low potassium dextran solution (n = 151). There was significantly increased use of low potassium dextran solution over time (P <. 001). Unadjusted 3 -year survival was similar across the groups (P =. 72), with the highest 3 -year survival in the low potassium dextran group (62 %; 95 % confidence interval, 51 %– 72 %) and the lowest in the <b>blood</b> <b>albumin</b> group (49 %; 95 % confidence interval, 39 %– 58 %). Risk-adjusted early (P =. 70), late (P =. 27), and overall (P =. 72) survival was similar across the groups and was not affected by ischemic time. Freedom from death caused by primary graft dysfunction was again highest in the low potassium dextran group (95 %; 95 % confidence interval, 90 %– 98 %) and lowest in the <b>blood</b> <b>albumin</b> group (91 %; 95 % confidence interval, 85 %– 95 %). There was no difference in intensive care unit length of stay. An increased incidence of rejection was apparent with increasing ischemic time (P =. 067).

A corn-soybean meal based diet containing levels of TRP (0. 00, 0. 25, 0. 50 and 0. 75 %) in a completely randomized design with 4 treatments and 5 replicates of 10 birds each were fed to 200 day-old Ross male broiler chickens from 0 - 49 days of age. For measuring <b>blood</b> parameters (<b>albumin,</b> total protein, total cholesterol, HDL and LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride) at 21, 35, and 42 and red blood cells, hemoglobin and hematocrit value at 21 and 42 days of age, serum blood samples from each replicate of treatments were collected. Inclusion of TRP into the diets significantly increased total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and haemoglobin and decreased LDL-cholesterol, VLDL-cholesterol and red blood cells at 42 days of age (p< 0. 05).

40|$|A Hepatocellular (HCC) Aggressiveness Index was {{recently}} constructed, {{consisting of the}} sum of the scores for the 4 clinical parameters of maximum tumor size, multifocality, presence of portal vein thrombus and blood alphafetoprotein levels. It was observed that there was an association with several liver function tests. We have now formed a Liver Index from the 4 liver parameters with the highest hazard ratios with respect to HCC aggressiveness, namely: blood total bilirubin, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP), albumin and platelet levels (cirrhosis surrogate). We found that the scores for the Liver Index related significantly to survival, but also to the Aggressiveness Index and to its individual HCC components as well as showing significant trends with the components. These results support the hypothesis that liver function is not only an important prognostic factor in HCC patients, but may also be involved in HCC biology and aggressiveness. <b>Blood</b> <b>albumin,</b> GGTP, albumin and platelet levels were used to create a Liver Index that related significantly to parameters of HCC aggressiveness...|$|R

30|$|Photonic sensing {{technology}} is a new and accurate measurement technology for bio-sensing applications. In this paper, a two-dimensional photonic crystal ring resonator based sensor is proposed and designed to detect the glucose concentration in urine over the range of 0 gm/dl- 15 gm/dl. The proposed sensor is consisted of two inverted “L” waveguides and a ring resonator. If the glucose concentration in urine is varied, the refractive index of the urine is varied, which in turn the output response of sensor will be varied. By having the aforementioned principle, the glucose concentration in urine, glucose concentration in <b>blood,</b> <b>albumin,</b> urea, and bilirubin concentration in urine are predicted. The size of the proposed sensor is about 11.4 µm× 11.4 µm, and the sensor can predict the result very accurately without any delay, hence, this attempt could be implemented for medical applications.|$|R

It is also known as calcific uremic arteriolopathy; however, the disease is not limited to patients with kidney failure. The current belief is that in end-stage kidney disease, abnormal calcium and phosphate homeostasis result in the deposition of calcium in the vessels, also known as metastatic calcification. Once the calcium has been deposited, a thrombotic event occurs within the lumen of these vessels, resulting in tissue infarction. It is unknown what the triggers are that cause the thrombotic and ischemic event.
