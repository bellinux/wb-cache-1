The <b>bonding</b> <b>capability</b> between the stiffener and skin is a primary criterion to assess the co-curing quality. In this paper, two reinforcement technologies of filling filler in the triangle region and adding split-stopping tape between the stiffener and skin were employed to improve the <b>bonding</b> <b>capability.</b> Effect of filler and split-stopping tape on the interface strength was analyzed, and the optimal size range of the filler and split-stopping tape were obtained. To improve the universality of application for the two reinforcement techniques, the filling coefficient of 0. 62 ~ 0. 77 and the split-stopping tape width coefficient of 0. 56 ~ 0. 67 were obtained by calculation.

Here, a novel approach for solvent filtration is proposed based on localized geometric constraints and <b>bonding</b> <b>capabilities</b> through the use of mixed monolayer ligand coated nanoparticles. Gold nanoparticles were synthesized and coated with octane thiol and mercaptoproprionic acid in a 3 : 1 ratio. Such nanoparticles have been reported to form an interesting grooved surface morphology, and {{it has been shown that}} their solubility varies according to the ability for individual solvent molecules to penetrate these grooves. Here, a system of filtration was designed, aimed at using these nanoparticles to remove a small quantity of ethanol from a solution of methanol. Solubility tests were performed on the synthesized nanoparticles and additional possible contaminants were isolated for testing including toluene, chloroform, and trihydrofuran. Titration columns were run to test the ability of the synthesized nanoparticles to separate the candidate contaminants above from a methanol solution. NMR spectroscopy of both the filtered and unfiltered solutions was performed and the results compared. Although far from conclusive, the evidence presented in this paper indicates that it very may well be possible to remove specific solute molecules from solution by flowing them through a group of nanoparticles with very clearly defined surface morphologies. by John Rogosic.

40|$|In animal models, {{devices such}} as {{indwelling}} catheters and intracranial cannulae are often fixed on the skull to allow sampling or injection in the freely moving animal. The most commonly used method to fixate these devices is by embedding them in a 'helmet' of cement which is fixed to the skull with screws. Methylmethacrylate cement is commonly used for this purpose. The disadvantages of this cement are the high polymerization temperature, poor bonding to the bone and long hardening time. We have evaluated the use of glass ionomer cement, carboxylat cement and cyanoacrylic glue as alternative for methylmethacrylate cement. Temperature increase during polymerization of methylmethacrylate cement and glass ionomer cement was measured in the cement on the skull and in the brain of 14 rats in an acute model. In a chronic model, 52 rats and 91 mice were equipped with a 'helmet' {{of one of the}} cements. The glass ionomer 'helmets' were applied without or with pretreatment of the skull. The attachment of the cement to the skull was checked every day. After four weeks the bonding strengths of the cements were measured. The glass ionomer cement had less temperature increase during polymerization and good <b>bonding</b> <b>capabilities</b> when compared with methylmethacrylate cement. Mechanical pretreatment of the skull resulted in a significant increase in bonding strength of glass ionomer cement in mice and rats as compared with chemical pretreatment. Furthermore, glass ionomer cement had a shorter hardening time than methylmethacrylate cement, and when the glass ionomer cement was used in prepacked capsules, it was possible to apply the cement sterilely and easily.

40|$|The {{electrostatic}} {{theory for}} ligand discrimination in myoglobin {{is based on}} the physiological importance of hydrogen bonding between the distal histidine and bound ligands in myoglobin. A quantitative estimation of this theory in hemoglobin had not been established. A series of 'electrostatic' mutations was created to examine for the existence of electrostatic stabilization of bound O 2 in both the alpha and beta subunit of R-state recombinant human hemoglobin. A set of HisE 7 to Ala, Leu, and Gln replacements was used to investigate the role of the distal histidine. The aliphatic mutations, AlaE 7 and LeuE 7, abolish all hydrogen <b>bonding</b> <b>capabilities</b> near bound ligands and cause dramatic increases in ligand association rate constants, particularly for O 2. The GlnE 7 substitution retains hydrogen <b>bonding</b> <b>capabilities</b> and results in wild-type-like ligand binding behavior. A second set of mutations were created to alter and examine the electrostatic potential in the distal pocket: PheCD 4 → Val, ValE 11 → Asn, and the double mutant HisE 7 → Leu/ValE 11 → Asn. The ValCD 4 mutation increases the flexibility of the distal histidine side chain, weakening hydrogen bonding interactions with bound ligands. The addition of an asparagine into the distal pocket at position E 11 provides a second hydrogen bonding donor in both subunits. The LeuE 7 /AsnE 11 double mutation maintains 'wild-type' electrostatic behavior, due to the compensatory effects of the addition of a hydrogen bond donor at position E 11 and removal of one at position E 7. Finally, the O 2 and CO properties of the double mutant HisE 7 → Gln/LeuB 10 → Trp were examined as a blood substitute prototype with reduced rates of ligand capture but normal or increased rates of ligand dissociation. This combination of amino acid replacements causes marked decreases in O 2 affinity in both subunits and maintains high rates of dissociation, both of which are favorable for efficient O 2 transport. The rate of association is decreased by the large size of the Tip side chain and the weakening of hydrogen bonding by the GlnE 7 replacement markedly enhances O 2 dissociation compared to that measured for the single TrpB 10 mutants...|$|R
