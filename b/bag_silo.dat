40|$|ABSTRACT. A grain combine was {{equipped}} with a whole-plant corn head and modified to produce single-pass, whole-plant corn harvesting with two crop streams: grain and stover. Capture of potential stover DM varied from 48 % to 89 % for leaves, from 49 % to 92 % for stalks, and was greater than 90 % for husks and cobs, depending on corn head height. Stover aggregate moisture varied between 36 % and 50 % (w. b.), and area capacity ranged between 1. 6 and 2. 6 ha h − 1, depending on corn head height. Whole-plant harvesting reduced area capacity by nearly 50 % compared to harvesting with a conventional ear-snapping head. Single-pass stover had an average particle size of 69 mm and bulk densities of 51 and 110 kg DM m − 3 in the wagon and <b>bag</b> <b>silo,</b> respectively. Estimated ethanol yield ranged between 2600 and 3945 L ha − 1, depending on corn head height. Fermentation of single-pass stover in a <b>bag</b> <b>silo</b> was adequate, with average losses of 6 % of total DM...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Decompressive {{laparotomy}} {{followed by}} temporary abdominal closure (TAC) is an established prophylaxis and treatment for abdominal compartment syndrome. The herein presented study {{aimed at the}} comparison of volume reserve capacity and development of intra-abdominal hypertension after forced primary abdominal closure and different TAC techniques in a porcine model. METHODS: Eight anesthesized and mechanically ventilated domestic pigs underwent a standardized midline laparotomy. A bag was placed into the abdominal cavity. Before abdominal closure, the bag was prefilled with 3, 000 mL water to simulate increased intra-abdominal volume. The intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) was then increased in 2 mm Hg steps up to 30 mm Hg by adding volume (volume reserve capacity) to the intra-abdominal bag. Volume reserve capacity with the corresponding IAP were analyzed and compared for primary abdominal closure, <b>bag</b> <b>silo</b> closure, a zipper system, and vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) with different negative pressures (- 50, - 100, and - 150 mm Hg). Hemodynamic and pulmonary parameters were monitored throughout the experiment. RESULTS: Volume reserve capacity was the highest for <b>bag</b> <b>silo</b> closure followed by the zipper system and VAC with primary abdominal closure providing the least volume reserve capacity in the whole IAP range. Of interest, VAC - 50 mm Hg resulted in a lower volume reserve capacity when compared with VAC - 100 and - 150 mm Hg. Pulmonary and hemodynamic parameters demonstrated {{no significant differences between}} primary abdominal closure and the evaluated TAC techniques at all IAP levels. CONCLUSIONS: The present experimental in vivo study indicates that <b>bag</b> <b>silo</b> closure and zipper systems may be favorable TAC techniques after decompressive laparotomy. In contrast, the VAC techniques resulted in lower volume reserve capacity and therefore may bear an increased risk for recurrent intra-abdominal hypertension in the initial phase after decompressive laparotomy...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: To compare volume reserve {{capacity}} (VRC) {{and development of}} intra-abdominal hypertension after different in vitro temporary abdominal closure (TAC) techniques. METHODS: A model of the abdomen was designed. The abdominal wall was simulated with polychloroprene, a synthetic rubber compound. A lentil-shaped defect of 150 cm(2) was cut into the anterior aspect of the abdominal wall. TAC of this defect was performed by a zipper system (ZS), a <b>bag</b> <b>silo</b> closure (BSC), or a vacuum assisted closure (VAC) with subatmospheric pressures ranging from 0 - to 200 mmHg. The model with intact abdominal wall served as reference. The model was filled with water to baseline level. The intra-abdominal pressure was increased in 2 mmHg steps from baseline level (6 mmHg) to 40 mmHg by adding volume to the system according to a standardized protocol. VRC with corresponding intra-abdominal pressure were analyzed and compared for the different TAC techniques. RESULTS: VRC was the highest after BSC at all pressure levels studied (P < 0. 05). VAC and ZS resulted in significantly lower VRC compared with BSC and reference (P < 0. 05). The magnitude of negative pressure on the VAC did not significantly influence the VRC. CONCLUSIONS: In the present in vitro model, BSC demonstrated the highest VRC of all evaluated TAC techniques. Different levels of subatmospheric pressures applied to the VAC did not affect VRC. The results for ZS and VAC indicate that these TAC techniques may increase the risk for recurrent intra-abdominal hypertension and should therefore {{not be used in}} high-risk patients during the initial phase after abdominal decompression...|$|E

40|$|Silage is {{a common}} way of storing and feeding forage in the United States. There are 4 phases (aerobic, anaerobic, stable, and feedout) that silage undergoes. The most {{critical}} phases to manage to minimize nutritive losses are when the silage is going from an aerobic to an anaerobic environment and at feedout. The first important step in achieving silage of high nutritive value is to harvest at the proper maturity and moisture level. Alfalfa should be harvested between mid bud and one-tenth bloom, and corn should be harvested between one-half and two-thirds milkline. The type of <b>silo</b> (pile, bunker, <b>bag,</b> or upright) {{has an impact on}} silage DM lost during storage. Bunker silos and piles usually have higher silage DM loss than <b>bag</b> and upright <b>silos</b> primarily because there is a greater amount of surface area exposed to oxygen. Limited research suggests that the nutritive value of high DM corn silage (~ 38 %) can be preserved better (increased milk production) in a <b>bagged</b> <b>silo</b> system compared to a bunker silo. Filling bunker silos rapidly using the progressive wedge technique has been shown to improve the nutritive value of silage. Covering bunker silos with polyethylene plastic also improves the amount of silage DM recovered and the nutritive value of both hay crop and corn silage. During the feedout phase it is important to feed approximately 5 inches or more from the silo face each day to minimize losses in quality that occur when silage is exposed to oxygen...|$|R
50|$|The {{method is}} heavily used in central, {{southern}} parts of Africa (i.e. Botswana) and South America. Small scale farmers {{have found the}} process to be more beneficial in their regions. Botswana is an arid area, it can go {{for longer periods of}} time without rain and therefore hermetic storage has helped in times without rain i.e. draught. Seeds are well stored for the next season of plowing even though at times seeds are purchase. Usually seeds purchase is done in supplementary measures. In Botswana, traditional people usually use the hermetic storage placed inside a jute bag to increase efficiency and effectiveness in eradicating living organisms within few days. Also, hermetic is crucial in Africa as most of the seeds are produced and stored in the farm. Experimental results proved that hermetic storage of seeds for twelve months can retain germination and viability characteristics, whilst extremely harsh conditions can render an opposite effect.Brazilian grain producers are starting to use hermetic bags on site to store grains as an alternative to bins. They claim that the cost is accessible and the quality of the grain remains the same for a period of 18 months. The bags are made of polyethylene that are capable of reflect sunlight and avoid the heating of the product as well as degradation by light.Argentina has to, frequently, deal with a storage shortage of 20 to 35 million tonnes of grain. This led to quality and quantity loss since the grain has to be transported directly from the farms to elevators, and from elevators to terminal ports. Hermetically sealed plastic <b>bags</b> (<b>silo</b> <b>bags)</b> has gained popularity among producers to overcome this issue. In 2008 harvest season, more than 33 million tonnes of grain were stored using the <b>silo</b> <b>bags</b> in the country for several grains and oilseeds, and, now, this technology is being adopted by other South American countries.Sealed bag has been used to store mostly silage in North America, however, the use of this storage system started to grown since the early 2000s. Still, instead using hermetic choices, the most common option when dealing with storage shortage is piling the grain on the ground.|$|R

A total of 47 bags (23 alfalfa, 1 red clover, 23 whole−plant corn) were made, and losses were calculated on 39 of the silos. Dry matter (DM) density ranged from 160 to 270 kg/m 3. Dry matter density increased with DM content in hay crop silages on average 2. 9 kg/m 3 − % DM, whereas the effect in corn silage varied by bagging machine. Density decreased with increasing particle size at 4. 1 kg DM/m 3 per mm. The operator and the bagging machine setup both affected density. A wide range (0 % to 40 %) of DM losses was observed.

40|$|The {{problems}} encountered with {{storage of}} agricultural products has warranted studies related to finding alternative methods of grain storage, thereby avoiding unnecessary losses. Stored grain deteriorates quickly at high temperatures. The moisture {{content of the}} grain influences the respiratory process; therefore, when at the recommended humidity of between 11 and 13 %, this rate remains low, it prolongs maintenance of the product quality.

Whole-corn plants were harvested at 350 g/kg dry matter (DM) and packed in nine <b>bag</b> <b>silos</b> (13 t/silo). At ensiling, two treatments were applied: control (no additive; six silos) and L. buchneri inoculation with 1 × 105 cfu/g (three silos). Feeding started after 247 days of storage; one L. buchneri and two control silos were opened in each experimental period. Twenty-one multiparous Holstein cows (~ 33 kg/day of milk) were allocated to seven balanced 3 × 3 Latin squares with 21 -day periods (14 days of adaptation). The experimental diets contained (DM basis) : 80 g/kg cottonseed, 95 g/kg citrus pulp, 180 g/kg soybean meal, 90 g/kg corn grain (ground), 25 g/kg minerals and vitamins premix, and 530 g/kg of corn silage. Source of corn silage was {{the only difference between}} experimental treatments: control, L. buchneri, or control silage supplemented with 1 -propanol (10 g/kg of diet DM). The 1 -propanol was dissolved in water (1 : 1) and sprinkled onto the ration during mixing, immediately before each feeding. Dry matter intake, nutrient digestibility, milk yield, and composition were not affected by treatments. Cows fed 1 -propanol had greater concentrations of 1 -propanol in the rumen fluid, higher concentration of glucose, and lower concentration of non-esterified fatty acids in blood plasma. Corn silage inoculated with L. buchneri at 1 × 105 cfu/g does not affect silage fermentation, ruminal fermentation profile, or milk production.

Treated silages had higher concentrations of acetic acid and lower concentrations of ethanol. Total mixed rations (TMR) containing inoculated silages exhibited significantly lower neutral detergent fiber (NDF) concentration and, consequently, higher in vitro DM digestibility (IVDMD). Thus, animals fed TMR containing treated silages spent less time chewing per day and per kilogram of DM intake (DMI), even at higher DMI levels. Nonetheless, the intake of NDF was similar across treatments (0. 77 to 0. 79 kg/ 100 kg BW) but markedly lower than the value reported for traditional forages. Average daily gain was significantly greater for animals fed TMR based on inoculated silages due to the higher DMI (14 % on average) and the higher energy content of the diets, {{as indicated by the}} higher feed efficiency (12 % on average).

Laboratory-scale <b>bag</b> <b>silos</b> were randomly opened after 1, 3, 7, 14, 28, and 56 days of ensiling and subjected to analyses of fermentation quality, carbohydrates loss, microbial amylase and hemicellulase activities, succession of dominant amylolytic or hemicellulolytic microbes, and their microbial and enzymatic properties. Results Both ATMR and LTMR silages were well preserved, with low pH and high lactic acid concentrations. In addition to the substantial loss of water soluble carbohydrates, loss of starch and hemicellulose was also observed in both TMR silages with prolonged ensiling. The microbial amylase activity remained detectable throughout the ensiling in both TMR silages, whereas the microbial hemicellulase activity progressively decreased until it was inactive at day 14 post-ensiling in both TMR silages. During the early stage of fermentation, the main amylase-producing microbes were Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (B. amyloliquefaciens), B. cereus, B. licheniformis, and B. subtilis in ATMR silage and B. flexus, B. licheniformis, and Paenibacillus xylanexedens (P. xylanexedens) in LTMR silage, whereas Enterococcus faecium was closely associated with starch hydrolysis at the later stage of fermentation in both TMR silages. B. amyloliquefaciens, B. licheniformis, and B. subtilis and B. licheniformis, B. pumilus, and P. xylanexedens were the main source of microbial hemicellulase during the early stage of fermentation in ATMR and LTMR silages, respectively.

Effects on animal performance of feeding treated or untreated forage were determined in a completely randomized design, using 30 lactating cows (178 +/- 55 days in milk) fed total mixed ration (50 : 50 forage: concentrate) with the major forage portion consisting of untreated or treated forage. The feeding study started one day post-ensiling. Results showed that Solution Foin reduced (P < 0. 05) yeast and mold populations between d 5 and 14 post-ensiling. The highest differences (P < 0. 002) were observed on d 10, at which point yeast and mold populations for untreated silage were 7. 86 and 2. 51 log cfu g- 1, respectively. The corresponding values for treated silage were 4. 35 and 0. 00 log cfu g- 1, respectively. Aerobic stability of treated ensiled forage was also improved (P < 0. 01) from day 0 (by 159 h) to day 10 (by 33 h) post-ensiling. Solution Foin also increased (P < 0. 05) the overall lactic acid and WSC content, and lowered the temperature of the treated ensiled forage in the field. No treatment differences were detected in the forage pH and acetic acid concentration. Dairy cows fed treated forage had similar feed intake (average 23 kg d- 1) and milk yield (average 29 kg d- 1) to cows fed the untreated forage.

They were packed in <b>bag</b> type <b>silos</b> (3 kg), PET bottles (1. 5 L), and glass containers (3 L), covered with organza fabric (control), and stored at 25 ºC and 70 ± 5 % relative humidity, for 120 days. The evaluated characteristics included moisture content, apparent density, electrical conductivity, germination percentage, cooking time, and bean classification, every 30 days. Except for the electrical conductivity and cooking time, the other characteristics were kept for 120 days in the stored product with moisture contents of 12. 3 % and 15. 7 % in hermetic conditions. Beans with 17. 8 % of the moisture content, electrical conductivity and cooking time increased, and apparent density and germination were reduced. Beans stored in the control, with any of the moisture contents, showed high quality loss during the long storage.

40|$|The {{effects of}} temperature, aerobic and {{anaerobic}} {{conditions in the}} silo and plant characteristics [water-soluble carbohydrate (WSC) contents, growing season] on the fermentation characteristics of a tropical forage species, Sorghum bicolor cv. sugar-drip, were investigated. Silages fermented in oxygen-impermeable bags were well preserved and had low pH (3. 7), high lactic acid [72 g kg- 1 dry matter (DM) ≡ 80 % of total acids], and low butyric acid (0. 12 g kg- 1 DM) and ammonia nitrogen (NH 3 -N) (57 g kg- 1 total nitrogen contents. Conversely, the use of oxygen-permeable <b>bags</b> as <b>silos</b> allowed aerobic decomposition of the ensiled forages. Increasing the incubation temperature lowered the population of lactic acid bacteria, reduced lactic acid production and caused the pH to rise. The heterofermentative Leuconostoc spp. predominated on fresh forages but homofermentative Lactobacillus plantarum began to dominate after 5 and 8 days of fermentation. Heterofermentative lactobacilli, notably Lactobacillus brevis, were dominant among the isolates obtained from 100 -day silages. Varying the WSC contents, by crushing and/or chopping the forage, and growing season did not significantly affect the fermentation quality of the resulting silages. It was concluded that the maintenance of anaerobic conditions is essential if good quality silage is to be produced from tropical forage species...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. The aim of {{this study}} was to assess {{alternatives}} for viable corn storage for small rural properties in two annual storage experiments. A 4 × 5 factorial design was used with four types of storage (conventional bags, hermetic <b>bags,</b> metal <b>silos</b> and corncobs) and five periods of storage (0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months). We used corn hybrids 2 B 688 RR and 30 K 73 Hx cultivated in winter 2012 and summer 2012 / 2013 in the city of Dois Vizinhos, Paraná, Brazil. The moisture contents, counts of Aspergillus sp. and Fusarium sp., and the occurrence of aflatoxins (B 1, B 2, G 1 and G 2) were assessed. The kernels stored in hermetic bags had lower moisture contents. Aspergillus sp. and Fusarium sp. were observed in 20. 37 and 86. 11 % of winter storage samples, respectively, and in 83. 3 and 91. 6 % of summer storage samples, respectively. The storage system and time of storage had no influence on the occurrence of Aspergillus sp. and aflatoxins in the winter crop samples. The corncobs from the summer crop samples had the lowest counts of Aspergillus sp. and did not have aflatoxins. We detected aflatoxins at concentrations of 2. 8 - 14. 5 and 3 - 197. 5 µg kg- 1 in the winter and summer crop samples, respectively...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} we {{investigated}} the in vivo and in vitro ecological conditions that can favour the fumonisin production, both free and hidden forms, in the maize-Fusarium verticillioides pathosystem. Samples of different maize hybrids {{have been collected}} from dough to the harvest maturity to follow the trend of fungal incidence and both fumonisin forms contamination, but also the changes in chemical composition. Differences {{in the level of}} contamination have been found among hybrids during the growing season. Furthermore, the production of fumonisins has been found correlated to the total lipids content, another parameter that changed during the growing season. This finding underlined the existence of a relationship between toxin contamination and fatty acids composition of the hybrids. Recently the existence of a cross talk between plant and pathogen has been demonstrated, based on some oxidized signal molecules (oxylipins) produced from fatty acid precursors. This result was also confirmed by the molecular analysis on the in vitro pathosystem that showed differences in the activation of the genes involved in plant and fungal oxylipins production during the incubation time. Also post-harvest contamination of maize was investigated in this study, with particular attention to the effects of the drying treatment, a common post-harvest practice aimed at decreasing the water availability, and to the storage capacity of a new low cost storage system, <b>silo</b> <b>bag.</b> The drying treatment was showed to affect fumonisins content, in particular an increased fumonisins contamination was detected after heat treatments. This increment seemed to be produced by chemical changes of matrix components, caused by high temperature, that produced the release of hidden fumonisin in free form. <b>Silo</b> <b>bags</b> were shown to be an effective system to store cereals because no significant change occurred in fungi or toxins contamination during a 9 -month storage. Therefore, being more flexible and less expensive than traditional store houses, they should be very useful for farmers...|$|R
40|$|Preface. This {{report is}} a product of the Cornell “open burning group, ” which formed in Winter 2002 to assess the extent and {{environmental}} health significance of open burning of household wastes and agricultural plastics in New York State (NYS), and begin work towards reducing these practices in order to protect public health and the environment. The report focuses on disposal of agricultural plastics—rather than on the household waste stream—for reasons that include the importance of agriculture in NY and the role of Cornell’s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences in working with NYS agriculture and the environment. Background and rationale. Plastics (LDPE, HDPE, polystyrene resins) have become ubiquitous in agriculture: In dairy farming they are used as silage <b>bags,</b> bunker <b>silo</b> covers, bale wraps and twines; in nurseries and ornamental horticulture they are used as hoophouse covers, trays and containers; in fruit and vegetable production, as row covers and mulch films. Plastic pesticide containers are used in all sectors of agriculture. Increasingly, plastics are substituted for the longer lasting materials previously used in agriculture (e. g., silage bags in place of concrete silos, plastic hoop houses in place of glass green houses) because of production efficiency and economics. More than half the plastics are disposed by burning onfarm, with most of the remainder buried or dumped on-farm. Due to inefficiencies of open combustion, emissions from open burning are much greater per mass of material burned than emissions from controlled incineration (e. g., 20 times as much dioxin, 40 times as much particulate matter). These emissions pose risks to human health...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Wheat {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} cultivated cereals in Uruguay for human consumption; however, when harvest yields are low, wheat is usually used in ensiling for animal feeding. Ensiling is a forage preservation method that allows for storage during extended periods of time while maintaining nutritional values comparable to fresh pastures. Silage is vulnerable to contamination by spoilage molds and mycotoxins because ensilage materials are excellent substrates for fungal growth. The aim of the study was to identify the mycobiota composition and occurrence of aflatoxins and DON from wheat silage. A total of 220 samples of wheat were collected from four farms in the southwest region of Uruguay were silage practices are developed. The main fungi isolated were Fusarium (43 %) and Aspergillus (36 %), with Fusarium graminearum sensu lato and Aspergillus section Flavi being the most prevalent species. Aflatoxin concentrations in <b>silo</b> <b>bags</b> ranged from 6. 1 to 23. 3 µg/kg, whereas DON levels ranged between 3000 µg/kg and 12, 400 µg/kg. When evaluating aflatoxigenic capacity, 27. 5 % of Aspergillus section Flavi strains produced AFB 1, 5 % AFB 2, 10 % AFG 1 and 17. 5 % AFG 2. All isolates of F. graminearum sensu lato produced DON and 15 -AcDON. The results from this study contribute to the knowledge of mycobiota and mycotoxins present in wheat silage...|$|R
40|$|The {{knowledge}} of the physical characteristics of the coffee bean allows {{the transition from the}} conventional storage model in <b>bags</b> to the <b>silo</b> storage, and as an indirect measure of the improvement and conservation {{of the quality of the}} stored grain. The elastic modulus allows comparisons on the strength of material. The variations of this occur due to its chemical composition, microstructures and material defects, being able to be used as indicator of the physical integrity of the grain. The ultrasonic pulse technique is an alternative to obtain the elastic modulus in a simple and non-destructive way. In this context, it was proposed the development of a non-destructive methodology that will perform the quality evaluation by determining the elastic modulus of the coffee beans. For this purpose, a reference silo was constructed, reproducing the storage conditions, and the elastic modulus values were determined. The values obtained by the Stress Wave Timer apparatus are between 2. 54 and 4. 23 MPa, with a maximum load of 8. 32 kN, and a calculated vertical pressure of 1, 526 kPa. To evaluate the impact of the storage conditions and the loads applied during the non-destructive test, laboratory tests applied in seeds were performed, and the tetrazolium test was the only one able to differentiate the samples. It was concluded that Stress Wave Timer was able to determine the elastic modulus values for the coffee bean mass and could be used as an indicative of the quality...|$|R
40|$|Fodder beets (Beta vulgaris L.) are {{especially}} respected for their high feeding value and high netto-energy yield per hectare. The price per nutritive value is lowest {{as compared to}} other forages. Preservation of fodders beets demands thorough cleaning without damaging and regularly occurs as a whole in well closed piles. In addition, feeding them to the animals is labour demanding. These disadvantages enforce the research towards other preservation methods which {{may be able to}} valorise this valuable type of roughage. The preservation of fodder beets in silages using <b>silo</b> <b>bags,</b> either separately or in combination with maize was investigated. Fodder beets were harvested and ensilaged at the ideal moment of maize harvest (October) or fodder beets were harvested at the ideal moment for fodder beet harvest (November) and consequently ensilaged with previously ensilaged maize. Highest energy yields of the silages were recorded at optimal harvest time for fodder beets. Ensilaging fodder beets separately resulted in large energy losses due to effluent and dry matter losses. Using lab scale silage, possible solutions for these large losses were investigated. Addition of 10 % maize did reduce the effluent losses but dry matter losses remained at a high level. Addition of 4, 5 l propionic acid per ton beets reduced effluent and dry matter losses sufficiently. Ensilaging foliage was another point of interest. This appeared to result in a lowered energy yield at organic and dry matter basis, an increased amount of ashes and doubling of the iron (Fe) concentration. status: publishe...|$|R
