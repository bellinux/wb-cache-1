25|$|Very small lamps {{may have}} the {{filament}} support wires extended through {{the base of the}} lamp, and can be directly soldered to a printed circuit board for connections. Some reflector-type lamps include screw terminals for connection of wires. Most lamps have metal bases that fit in a socket to support the lamp and conduct current to the filament wires. In the late 19th century, manufacturers introduced a multitude of incompatible lamp bases. General Electric introduced standard base sizes for tungsten incandescent lamps under the Mazda trademark in 1909. This standard was soon adopted across the US, and the Mazda name was used by many manufacturers under license through 1945. Today most incandescent lamps for general lighting service use an Edison screw in candelabra, intermediate, or standard or mogul sizes, or double contact <b>bayonet</b> <b>base.</b> Technical standards for lamp bases include ANSI standard C81.67 and IEC standard 60061-1 for common commercial lamp sizes, to ensure interchangeablitity between different manufacturer's products. <b>Bayonet</b> <b>base</b> lamps are frequently used in automotive lamps to resist loosening due to vibration. A bipin base is often used for halogen or reflector lamps.|$|E
25|$|Many {{arrangements}} of electrical contacts are used. Large lamps {{may have a}} screw base (one or more contacts at the tip, one at the shell) or a <b>bayonet</b> <b>base</b> (one or more contacts on the base, shell used as a contact or used only as a mechanical support). Some tubular lamps have an electrical contact at either end. Miniature lamps may have a wedge base and wire contacts, and some automotive and special purpose lamps have screw terminals for connection to wires. Contacts in the lamp socket allow the electric current {{to pass through the}} base to the filament. Power ratings for incandescent light bulbs range from about 0.1 watt to about 10,000 watts.|$|E
5000|$|The first hot-cathode CRT, the Western Electric 224-B, had a {{standard}} four-pin <b>bayonet</b> <b>base,</b> and the bayonet pin was a live connection. (Five effective pins: It was an electrostatic-deflection gas-focused type, with a diode gun and single-ended deflection. The anode {{and the other}} two plates were common.) ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Bayonet</b> <b>bases</b> or caps {{are often}} {{abbreviated}} to BA, {{often with a}} number after. The number refers to {{the diameter of the}} base (e.g., BA22 is a 22 mm diameter bayonet cap lamp). BA15, a 15 mm base, can also be referred to as SBC standing for small bayonet cap. The lower-case letter s or d specifies whether the bulb has single or double contacts.|$|R
5000|$|Like its predecessor, the M5 bayonet for the M1 Garand rifle, the M6 was {{intended}} to serve additional roles as a combat knife and utility knife. The basic blade design was like the M4, M5, and later M7 <b>bayonets,</b> <b>based</b> on the World War II designed M3 Trench Knife. The overall length of the M6 is 11 3/8 inches, with a blade 6 5/8 inches long. Contractors who manufactured the M6 included Aerial Cutlery Co., Columbus Milpar and Mfg. Co. and Imperial Knife Co.The first of these contracts was fulfilled in 1961, the last in 1969.|$|R
50|$|An early {{exception}} to {{these types of}} bases is the Peanut 215, which instead of using prongs had a tiny <b>bayonet</b> <b>base</b> with four drop-like contacts. Another exception is the European Side Contact series commonly known as P, which instead of using a prong, relied on side contacts at 90 degrees from the tube axis with four to twelve contacts.|$|E

50|$|The current British L3A1 socket <b>bayonet</b> is <b>based</b> on the FN FAL Type C socket bayonet with a clip-point blade. It has {{a hollow}} handle that fits over the SA80/L85 rifles muzzle and slots that {{lined up with}} those on the flash eliminator. The blade is offset {{to the side of}} the handle to allow the bullet to pass beside the blade. It can also be used as a {{multi-purpose}} knife and wire-cutter when combined with its scabbard. The scabbard also has a sharpening stone and folding saw blade.|$|R
50|$|The M16 is 44.25 inches (1124mm) {{long with}} an M7 bayonet attached. The M7 <b>bayonet</b> is <b>based</b> on earlier designs {{such as the}} M4, M5, & M6 bayonets, {{all of which are}} direct {{descendants}} of the M3 Fighting Knife and have spear-point blade with a half sharpened secondary edge. The newer M9 bayonet has a clip-point blade with saw teeth along the spine, and {{can be used as a}} multi-purpose knife and wire-cutter when combined with its scabbard. The current USMC OKC-3S bayonet bears a resemblance to the Marines' iconic Ka-Bar fighting knife with serrations near the handle.|$|R

50|$|Flashbulbs {{took longer}} to reach full {{brightness}} and burned {{for longer than}} electronic flashes. Slower shutter speeds (typically from 1/10 to 1/50 of a second) were used on cameras to ensure proper synchronization. Cameras with flash sync triggered the flashbulb {{a fraction of a}} second before opening the shutter, allowing faster shutter speeds. A flashbulb widely used during the 1960s was the Press 25, the (about 1 inch (25 mm) in diameter) flashbulb often used by newspapermen in period movies, usually attached to a press camera or a twin-lens reflex camera. Its peak light output was around a million lumens. Other flashbulbs in common use were the M-series, M-2, M-3 etc., which had a small ("miniature") metal <b>bayonet</b> <b>base</b> fused to the glass bulb. The largest flashbulb ever produced was the GE Mazda No. 75, initially developed for nighttime aerial photography during World War II.|$|E
5000|$|The M1917 bayonet {{was used}} first during World War I by American {{soldiers}} on the Western Front. A sword bayonet design, the M1917 <b>bayonet</b> design was <b>based</b> on the British P1907 bayonet, which incorporated a long 17-inch blade. While designed primarily for the M1917 rifle the bayonet was fitted for use on all the [...] "trench" [...] shotguns at the time.|$|R
50|$|New Guard America {{was founded}} in 1997 by Constantine H. Wilson. This is the world's only internationally touring {{civilian}} drill team. They use Springfield M1903 rifles with fixed 10 in <b>bayonets.</b> They are <b>based</b> out of the Washington, DC metropolitan area. They perform mainly in four man-blocks. In June 2008 they performed at the Norwegian Military Tattoo in Oslo, Norway, making them the first civilian drill team to perform at an international tattoo.|$|R
50|$|Most A19 {{light bulbs}} come with an one-inch long Edison screw base, either of type E26 (i.e. 26 {{millimeters}} in diameter) {{in countries with}} a mains voltage of 100 - 120 volts, or of type E27 (i.e. 27 millimeters in diameter) in countries with 220 - 240 volts AC. A-series light bulbs using the older B22 <b>Bayonet</b> twist type <b>base</b> are less common these days; they {{can be found in}} the UK and many British Commonwealth countries.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{requests}} from the field, the carbine was modified to incorporate a bayonet lug starting in 1945. However, very few carbines with bayonet lugs reached {{the front lines}} {{before the end of}} World War II. By the start of the Korean War, the bayonet lug-equipped M1 was standard issue. It is now rare to find an original M1 carbine without the bayonet lug. The M1 carbine mounts the standard M4 <b>bayonet,</b> which was <b>based</b> on the earlier M3 fighting knife and formed the basis for the later M5, M6 and M7 bayonet-knives.|$|R
5000|$|A Silver color {{metal and}} enamel device 1+1/4 in in height {{consisting}} of a shield blazoned: Parti per fess Argent and Azure, in chief a sea lion holding in dexter paw a musket with <b>bayonet</b> Gules, in <b>base</b> a mullet within a wreath both of the first; on a canton of the second a rock of the first charged with a shoulder strap of a second lieutenant of Infantry of 1863 Proper. Attached below and {{to the sides of}} the shield a Silver scroll inscribed [...] "ANYWHERE-ANYTIME" [...] in Blue letters.|$|R
50|$|The American M16 rifle {{used the}} M7 <b>bayonet</b> which is <b>based</b> on earlier designs {{such as the}} M4, M5 and M6 models, {{all of which are}} direct {{descendants}} of the M3 Fighting Knife and have a spear-point blade with a half sharpened secondary edge. The newer M9 has a clip-point blade with saw-teeth along the spine, and {{can be used as a}} multi-purpose knife and wire-cutter when combined with its scabbard. It can even be used by troops to cut their way free through the relatively thin metal skin of a crashed helicopter or airplane. The current USMC OKC-3S bayonet bears a resemblance to the Marines' iconic Ka-Bar fighting knife with serrations near the handle.|$|R
