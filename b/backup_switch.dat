40|$|International audienceWith {{the advent}} of MPLS, the {{restoration}} times of communications is decreased down to 50 ms {{by the use of}} preconfigured <b>backup</b> Label <b>Switching</b> Paths (LSPs). To ensure there are enough resources after a failure, the backup LSPs must reserve the resources they need beforehand.

Hence, to optimize and maximize resource availability in the network, backup LSPs may share their resource reservation. Indeed, under the hypothesis of single failures in the network, some backup paths are not active at the same time since they protect against the failure of different components. In this article, we propose an efficient Distributed Bandwidth Sharing (DBS) heuristic capable to protect the primary LSPs against all types of failure risks (link, node and SRLG risks) with the transmission of a very small amount of bandwidth information.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the engine's failure, several related systems failed. The number one hydraulic system, powered by the number one engine, failed but continued to operate via motor pumps that mechanically connected it to hydraulic system three. Hydraulic system three was also damaged and began leaking fluid but maintained pressure and operation up until impact. Hydraulic system two was undamaged. The number one electrical bus, whose generator {{was attached to the}} number one engine, failed, causing several electrical systems to go offline, most notably the captain's instruments, his stick shaker, and the slat disagreement sensors. While a switch in the overhead panel would have allowed the captain to restore power to his instruments, it was not used. It might have been possible for the flight engineer to reach the <b>backup</b> power <b>switch</b> (as part of an abnormal situation checklist – not as part of their take-off emergency procedure) in an effort to restore electrical power to the number one electrical bus. That would have worked only if electrical faults were no longer present in the number one electrical system. Furthermore, to reach the switch the flight engineer would have had to rotate his seat, release his safety belt, and stand up. Since the aircraft never got higher than 350 feet (110 m) above ground and was in the air for only 50 seconds between when the engine separated and when it crashed, there was not sufficient time to take such an action. In any event, the first officer was flying the airplane and his instruments continued to function normally. As the wings and engines were not visible from the cockpit, the crew likely had no idea that an engine had fallen off, only that one had failed.|$|R
30|$|As an {{artificial}} network, the main task {{of a power}} system is to deliver electrical energy to customers, which means connecting the power sources and loads through power lines. Hence the connectivity is a key feature of power system topologies. Reviewing the history of power systems, we find the power system topologies in the past can only meet the requirement of connectivity. From {{the point of view}} of graph theory, the earliest power system topology is a tree-like structure. We can easily define the power source and the loads as the root node and the leaf nodes, respectively. There is only one path between the root node and each leaf node. As power system technology was developed, and customers required more reliable electricity, the topology of power systems began to change. Transmission systems are designed as reticular structures. A number of tie lines or tie switches are installed in distribution systems, which are implemented as <b>backup</b> lines or <b>switches</b> to transfer loads when faults occur. Through the above analysis, we design an algorithm to obtain connected random topologies for simulating real-world power grids. Firstly, we stochastically generate a spanning tree that contains all the nodes in the power grid, and then add a certain number of lines to meet the requirement of the average degree of the power grid topology.|$|R

Attention has focused on the cementing procedure and the blowout preventer, which failed to fully engage. A number of significant problems were identified with the blowout preventer: There was a leak in the hydraulic system that provides power to the shear rams. The underwater control panel had been disconnected from the pipe ram, and instead connected to a test ram. The blowout preventer schematic drawings, provided by Transocean to BP, did not correspond to the structure that was on the ocean bottom. The shear rams were not designed to function on the joints where the drill pipes were screwed together or on tools that were passed through the blowout preventer during well construction. The explosion may have severed the communication line between the rig and the sub-surface blowout preventer control unit such that the blowout preventer would have never received the instruction to engage. Before the <b>backup</b> dead man's <b>switch</b> could engage, communications, power and hydraulic lines must all be severed, but it is possible hydraulic lines were intact after the explosion.

40|$|Zusammenfassung (dt.) Abstract: Wireless ad hoc {{networks}} {{are becoming more}} ubiquitous in terms of devices, application areas, etc. due to their low cost and minimal deployment effort. Since all these networks operate in the unlicensed band, the problems of congestion and spectrum scarcity have arisen. On the other hand, {{a recent study by}} Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has revealed that swathes of licensed bands, measured by 70 %, are unutilized. This highlights that the actual problem is not the scarcity of spectrum but inefficient allocation policies and usage. Therefore, this dissertation is focused on improving spectrum utilization and efficiency to tackle the spectrum scarcity problem and support further wireless ad hoc networks. This thesis proposes a new spectrum management concept called opportunistic spectrum access with backup channel (OSAB). The proposed concept provides secondary users (SUs) (e. g. ad hoc users) with the ability to adaptively and dynamically exploit channels from both licensed and unlicensed bands without interfering the legacy users of licensed bands, i. e. the so called primary users (PUs). Since existing radio systems offer very limited flexibility, cognitive radios (CR), which can sense and adapt to radio environments, are exploited to support such a dynamic concept. For the development of OSAB, the channels' characteristics from each band are taken into consideration. The main advantage of licensed channels is their availability in significant numbers, whereas, the main advantage of unlicensed channels is that all users have the same rights to channel access and thus no preemption occurs once a user obtains a channel. In addition, OSAB uses a backup channel (BC) to handle the appearance of PUs and thus facilitates SU communication. The proposed concept is extensively evaluated using a Markov chain model and compared to existing spectrum management approaches such as opportunistic spectrum access (OSA). The results indicate that OSAB decreases the dropping probability and the expected number of spectrum handoffs for SUs compared to OSA by 60 % and 17 % respectively. In order to apply OSAB practically, we develop a MAC protocol that reacts efficiently to sudden appearance of PUs. The new protocol is named opportunistic Spectrum access WITh <b>backup</b> CHannel (<b>SWITCH)</b> protocol. SWITCH is a decentralized, asynchronous, and contention-based MAC protocol. The BC's concept makes SWITCH extremely robust to the appearance of PUs. Each SU is equipped with two transceivers, one is tuned to a common control channel for the negotiation purpose with other SUs while the other is designed specifically to periodically sense and dynamically use the identified unused channels. To obtain the channel state accurately, we propose an efficient spectrum sensing strategy. This strategy is based on cooperative spectrum sensing among SUs. The performance of proposed protocol is evaluated through simulations. The results show that SWITCH accomplishes a remarkable 91. 7 % throughput gain over other CR-MAC protocolsTo conclude, the proposed contributions are a step forward towards efficient use of available radio resources and improve the spectrum capacity for wireless ad hoc networks...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Computer and Electronical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007 The {{increasing}} {{availability of}} wireless technology, {{both at home}} and in the workplace, offers many advantages in terms of mobility and freedom of connectivity. However, switching from a wired to a wireless transmission medium also presents unique research challenges, especially in the field of Quality of Service (QoS). There are many difficulties associated with meeting user expectations in a wireless environment, due to the unreliable nature of wireless communications. This study focuses on QoS provision in an infrastructure-mode 802. 1 1 wireless LAN (WLAN), simulated in the OPNET Modeler network simulation package. The topology consists of 802. 1 1 b access networks that send data to each other via a wired core network. The core is designed to include some of the unreliable characteristics of a wireless network. Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) is deployed in the network backbone as a means to manage the allocation of available resources. We then study the effect MPLS has on the QoS of voice, video, and File Transfer Protocol (FTP) application traffic, {{as well as on the}} performance of the wireless access networks. Two experiments are performed, the first with limited core bandwidth, and the second to investigate the effect of a link failure on the level of QoS. For each experiment, the MPLS scenario is compared to two identical networks, one without any QoS present, and the other with Differentiated Services (DiffServ) scheduling. The results from Experiment 1 show that MPLS traffic engineering is able to effectively manage available resources to provide for all application types. The baseline scenario is unable to guarantee acceptable QoS, while DiffServ favours real-time applications at the cost of FTP traffic. In Experiment 2, the use of <b>backup</b> MPLS Label <b>Switched</b> Paths (LSPs) ensures that application QoS remains relatively unaffected despite the link failure, while notable QoS degradation occurs in the other scenarios. In addition, the use of MPLS in the network core achieves the highest WLAN throughput in both experiments. Our approach offers potential benefits for office or campus networks, both for ensuring adequate QoS for application traffic, and to increase the reliability of the network backbone. Our research on MPLS traffic engineering should also be applicable in a wireless-only environment. Master...|$|R
40|$|Climate change {{caused by}} green house gas emissions, mainly carbon dioxide, is today’s most debated {{environmental}} issue. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, with the legally binding Kyoto protocol, is the emission regulatory framework. Tanzania has ratified both the conventions supporting carbon reductions. Tanzania {{has a very}} varied climate with two rainfall regimes dominating the country, bimodal and unimodal. Scientific literature predicts a 2, 2 - 4 °C average increase in temperature for Tanzania, all studies also predict a higher increase in the cooler period and lower in the warm period. Rainfall predictions are less certain but in general a 10 % average increase is expected but the distribution uneven, both between rain periods and geographically. Tanzanian reports estimate a 5 - 45 % increase in rainfall in bimodal regions and a 5 - 15 % decrease in unimodal regions. The distribution of increase in bimodal regions will be uneven, {{with an increase in}} the long rain period and a decrease in the short rain period. Agriculture is indisputably the most important source of income in Tanzania standing for 80 % of employment and 50 % of GNP. Climate change will therefore inevitably affect the economy and livelihood of people. Developing countries are also more vulnerable due to lower adaptation capacity. Effects on Tanzania are predicted to be both positive and negative. Maize production, the major staple, is predicted an average 33 % decline while cash crops like coffee and cotton are predicted to increase. To be able to adapt there first has to be a perception of need to adapt, adaption strategies then have to be developed and barriers worked through. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate the level of awareness, strategies and barriers existing for adaption to climate change on national, regional and local level, Tanzania nationally and Babati regionally and locally. The research questions are; How do people perceive climate change? What are the strategies for adapting to climate change? What are the barriers for adaption to climate change? At national level policy framework and strategies were used to answer the research questions. At regional and local level a field study was conducted in Babati to answer the research questions at these levels. The study showed that Tanzania nationally has declared their conviction in climate change and state that the issue has to be addressed. Agriculture is identified {{as one of the most}} vulnerable areas however climate change is not mainstreamed into agricultural and environmental policy framework. In Babati district no policy was found on climate change and official perception varied. Concerns were related to timing and amount of rainfall, the results were the same for farmers. Global climate change was also known for both studied groups and existed as a parallel truth with the local reason for changes. A number of adaption strategies are also identified nationally, both used and potential, where small scale irrigation is the primary adaptive step. Switching to draught resistant crops is also prioritized in the North eastern region. In Babati adaption strategies were promoted, even though there was not a general policy or perception, by officials to switch to short-term crops and planting of trees. Switching cops was also the most commonly used strategy by farmers along with traditional diversification. Nationally a large number of barriers are also identified including, lack of funding, poverty, HIV, lack of infrastructure and analytic capacity. Officials in Babati also mentioned the lack of money, deforestation, lack of clouds, education, irrigation and seeds. The farmers in Babati were not so clear about what they needed to adapt, irrigation, livestock <b>backup,</b> diversification and <b>switching</b> crops were mentioned, not differing much from used strategies...|$|R
