50|$|Die Kandidaat is a 1968 South African drama film {{directed}} <b>by</b> <b>Jans</b> Rautenbach and starring Gert Van den Bergh, Marie Du Toit and Regardt van den Bergh. The {{film was}} regarded as critical of the apartheid system, and it faced some censorship from the authorities.|$|R
50|$|The film {{provoked}} a backlash in South Africa {{because it was}} bilingual and featured black actors in leading roles. It was also felt that it portrayed a negative, stereotypical portrayal of Afrikaners.

5|$|Attempts to date it have {{undergone}} similar shifts of opinion. In the 19th century the panel {{was believed to}} be an early work <b>by</b> <b>Jan</b> completed as early as c. 1410, although this view changed as scholarship progressed. In the early 20th century, Ludwig von Baldass placed it around 1424–29, then for a long period it was seen as originating from the early 1430s. Erwin Panofsky provided the first detailed treatise on the work and placed it around 1432–34. However, following research from Meyer Schapiro, he revised his opinion to the late 1430s in the 1953 edition of his Early Netherlandish Painting. A 1970s comparative study of van Eyck's 1437 Saint Barbara concluded that Madonna in the Church was completed after c. 1437. In the 1990s, Otto Pächt judged the work as probably a late van Eyck, given the similar treatment of an interior in the 1434 Arnolfini Portrait. In the early 21st century, Jeffrey Chipps Smith and John Oliver Hand placed it between 1426 and 1428, claiming it as perhaps the earliest extant signed work confirmed as <b>by</b> <b>Jan.</b>|$|E
5|$|Critics {{have been}} mostly positive, {{although}} one initial poor review <b>by</b> <b>Jan</b> Moir {{was picked up}} by the mainstream media. The concept of the cool boxes was also praised.

5|$|However records {{indicate}} that Lochner's talent was recognised {{from an early}} age. He may have been of Netherlandish origin or worked there for a master, possibly Robert Campin. Lochner's work seems influenced <b>by</b> <b>Jan</b> van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden; elements of their styles can be detected in the structure and colourisation of Lochner's mature works, especially in his Last Judgment, although neither {{is thought to be}} the master with whom he studied.|$|E
