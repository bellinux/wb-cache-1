5|$|And Yet It Moves {{received}} generally favorable reviews. The PC version gained aggregate {{scores of}} 71.50% and 75 on GameRankings and Metacritic, respectively, while the WiiWare version gained aggregate scores of 85.30% and 83. Critics applauded the game's unique {{take on the}} platforming genre and the game's paper collage visual style, <b>but</b> <b>felt</b> the game was too short. Some critics noted {{the absence of any}} narrative or backstory, <b>but</b> <b>felt</b> that the game ultimately didn't need one, though GameSpot noted it as one of the game's weaknesses.|$|E
5|$|Paul Winfield plays Reliant captain Clark Terrell; Meyer {{had seen}} Winfield's work in {{films such as}} Sounder and wanted to direct him. Meyer thought in retrospect that the Ceti eel scenes might have been corny, <b>but</b> <b>felt</b> that Winfield's {{performance}} helped add gravity.|$|E
5|$|Christopher Huynh of Game Music Online {{generally}} {{praised the}} soundtrack's quality, <b>but</b> <b>felt</b> {{there was too}} little variety. RPGFans Patrick Gann was generally positive, although he had little commentary on individual tracks, and recommended the album to people who had enjoyed the soundtrack of Nier. The album reached #18 in the Oricon charts and remained in the charts for four weeks.|$|E

50|$|He {{is married}} to the former Loretta Stanfield. Two {{children}} resulted from the marriage, <b>but</b> <b>Felts</b> lost his only son, Narvel Jr. (known as Bub) in 1995. At one time, Bub played drums for his father. One of his albums is dedicated to his son.He currently resides in Malden, Mo. where he continues to perform on occasion.|$|R

5|$|His {{frustration}} {{turned to}} depression, and in 1971 Drake was persuaded {{by his family}} to visit a psychiatrist at St Thomas's Hospital, London. He was prescribed a course of antidepressants, <b>but</b> <b>felt</b> uncomfortable and embarrassed about taking them, and tried {{to hide the fact}} from his friends. He knew enough about drugs to worry about their side effects, and was concerned about how they would react with his regular cannabis use.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, Selfe became vice {{president}} of the School of Arts. He supported the school's Working Men's College, <b>but</b> <b>felt</b> a more thorough focus on practical skills was needed. He rejected the non-technical, non-practical approach of the school's model and campaigned instead {{for the establishment of a}} proper institute of technical education, where instructors would be skilled tradesmen with practical industrial experience. He also pushed for the expansion of technical education facilities into the suburban and regional districts.|$|E
5|$|It was {{initially}} decided to first sign an A-list actor for Superman before Richard Donner {{was hired as}} director. Robert Redford was offered a large sum, <b>but</b> <b>felt</b> he was too famous. Burt Reynolds also turned down the role, while Sylvester Stallone was interested, but nothing ever came of it. Paul Newman was offered his choice of roles as Superman, Lex Luthor or Jor-El for $4million, turning down all three roles.|$|E

5|$|Kei Iwasaki of {{the band}} Sekaiichi, writing for Musica, felt that Ichiro Yamaguchi's dual love of 1990s pop music and {{electronic}} musicians such as Daft Punk and Cornelius strongly expressed itself throughout the album. He lauded Sakanaction's efforts to mix electronica and pop, <b>but</b> <b>felt</b> that mixing these two genres was a double-edged sword that invariably influenced the composition of songs. Because of this, he felt that Night Fishing might be more successful musically if the songs were re-recorded.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of 27 October Thomas {{attended}} his 39th birthday party <b>but</b> <b>felt</b> unwell {{and returned to his}} hotel after an hour. The next day he took part in Poetry and the Film, a recorded symposium at Cinema 16, with panellists Amos Vogel, Arthur Miller, Maya Deren, Parker Tyler, and Willard Maas.|$|E
5|$|Rasmussen {{considered}} in a 2005 paper whether the revised taxonomy of the book, with its many species splits, had significant conservation implications, <b>but</b> <b>felt</b> {{that the effect}} on species richness in South Asia was limited, and would have only a moderate conservation impact, {{increasing the number of}} potentially threatened species in the region from 6% of the total avifauna to about 7%.|$|E

5|$|Written by David Banks, {{the story}} {{involved}} the Sixth Doctor and Peri encountering the Master in Ancient Crete, {{as well as}} a contingent of Cybermen. David Banks, who had played the Cyber Leader in three serials in the early 1980s, submitted this storyline around the time that ‘Attack Of The Cybermen’ entered production in 1984. Script editor Eric Saward liked the idea, <b>but</b> <b>felt</b> that it would prove too expensive to film.|$|E
5|$|Annalee Call was {{originally}} written for Angelina Jolie; although Jolie auditioned, she {{turned down the}} role and Winona Ryder was cast in December 1996. Call had a generally negative critical reception, largely due to a perceived lack of synergy with the film and the franchise. Roger Ebert praised Ryder's acting, <b>but</b> <b>felt</b> {{that she did not}} bring a strong presence or purpose to the film except as a familiar face to younger viewers. Nordling agreed in a 2012 Ain't It Cool News analysis, saying that Call's synthetic origin is unnecessary and her only role is that of a surrogate audience.|$|E
5|$|At 7:30am {{the next}} morning, the Duke of Wellington {{wrote to the}} Mayor of Liverpool from his lodgings in nearby Roby. He had been due to receive the Freedom of the City, <b>but</b> <b>felt</b> that under the {{circumstances}} any kind of celebration would be inappropriate, {{and said that he}} would not be attending any of the planned events in the city that day. The planned parades and ceremonial dinner were cancelled, but in the absence of rapid transit or mass communication there was no way to notify most of the city's population. While some shops had heard the news and remained shuttered, the ships in Liverpool's docks remained festooned with brightly coloured streamers, and sounded their horns at the time the Duke was expected to be passing.|$|E

5|$|BMC {{was active}} at {{two of the}} {{traditional}} season-opening races, attaining seventh place with Ballan in the Italian opener Trofeo Laigueglia, and eighth with Quinziato in the Belgian opener, Omloop Het Nieuwsblad. Ballan narrowly missed victory a week later at Montepaschi Strade Bianche, finishing second at the line behind Philippe Gilbert. Ballan acknowledged that Gilbert and not he had used the optimal tactics in the final sprint, <b>but</b> <b>felt</b> nonetheless pleased with his early-season form. The two {{had been part of}} a 19-rider group that made all the selections through the sectors of unpaved roads before the finish on cobblestones in Siena.|$|E
5|$|Bradley Meek, {{writing for}} THEM Anime, gave the series 3/5 stars. He praised {{the way the}} series {{maintained}} its horror-based atmosphere in between the action sequences. He greatly enjoyed the horror and action aspects, <b>but</b> <b>felt</b> that the character-driven segments in early episodes threatened to drag down the whole experience due to mundane content and poor characters. Talking about the anime's second half, {{he said that it}} drastically altered the pace and content to the point that viewers might be put off with its conscious bending of the rules of handling characters and viewers alike—Meek was ultimately angry at the series' brutal ending, but it also left him eager to see its movie conclusion.|$|E
5|$|Brashear has {{represented}} the United States on two separate occasions. He made his international debut at the 1997 World Championship, where he registered two goals and five points in eight games, helping the Americans to a sixth-place finish. He later {{noted that he}} {{was surprised by the}} invitation, <b>but</b> <b>felt</b> that it gave him an opportunity to show he could play other roles besides being an enforcer. He played for the U.S. again the following year at the World Championship, playing in six games and accumulating ten penalty minutes as the Americans finished in 12th place.|$|E

5|$|By {{this time}} Pierre Christin was {{dividing}} {{his time between}} Paris and Bordeaux, where {{he was working on}} founding the school of journalism at the Institut Universitaire de Technologie (IUT). Meeting up with Mézières one day, Christin suggested that they work on creating a comic strip together. Both had their experiences in the American West to draw upon <b>but</b> <b>felt,</b> thanks to Lucky Luke, Jerry Spring and Blueberry, that the market for Westerns was already crowded. Instead, Christin suggested that they turn their hands to science fiction, a genre that, at that time, was not prevalent in French comics. Although Goscinny was not a science fiction fan, he wanted to promote innovation and originality in Pilote and so commissioned them to produce a strip.|$|E
5|$|Candaules {{depicts a}} scene from the first book of the Histories by Herodotus. Candaules, king of the ancient kingdom of Lydia, {{believed}} his wife Nyssia to be the world's most beautiful woman. He discussed his wife's beauty with his favourite bodyguard Gyges, <b>but</b> <b>felt</b> Gyges was lying when he told him that he agreed about her beauty. Candaules arranged, over the protests of Gyges, for Gyges to hide behind his bedroom door and secretly watch Nyssia undressing without her knowledge. Although he was unhappy at being forced to take part, Gyges reluctantly hid behind the door and watched Nyssia undress. Nyssia noticed Gyges as he slipped out of the room afterwards, but remained silent.|$|E
5|$|Chase invited {{musician}} Steven Van Zandt, a guitarist in Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band {{to audition}} for a part in his series after seeing him live at the 1997 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame ceremony and being impressed with his appearance and presence. Van Zandt, who had never acted before, originally auditioned {{for the role of}} Tony Soprano <b>but</b> <b>felt</b> the role should go to an experienced actor. Van Zandt eventually agreed to star on the show as mob consigliere Silvio Dante and his real-life spouse Maureen was cast as his on-screen wife, Gabriella.|$|E
50|$|While {{writing for}} IGN in Italy, Di Claudio Chianese {{described}} Sons of Abraham as {{building on the}} solid foundation formed by the original game. <b>But</b> he <b>felt</b> like it didn't go far enough in {{the expansion of the}} religions, and missed out on the chance to play as the Pope. <b>But</b> he <b>felt</b> that it would be well received by experienced gamers of Crusader Kings II.|$|R
