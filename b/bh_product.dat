40|$|The {{mechanism}} of TiCl(4) -prornoted Baylis-Hillman reaction between {{methyl vinyl ketone}} (MVK) and acetaldehyde, {{in the absence of}} any base, is studied using the mPW 1 K density functional theory. The study focuses on several mechanistic intricacies as well as selectivity issues at each step of the reaction. The minimum energy pathway for this reaction involves three major steps such as a chloride transfer resulting in a chloro-enolate, titanium-mediated aldol reaction, and elimination of HCl or HOTiCl(3). Both s-cis and s-trans conformers of MVK are considered along with various modes of chloride transfer involving different complexes between TiCl(4), aldehyde, and MVK. Chloride transfer is found to be kinetically more favored For s-cis-WK than for s-trans-MVK. The diastereoselectivity in the next step, i. e., Ti-mediated aldol reaction between the enolate and aldehyde, is found to be dependent on the geometry of the enolate, wherein anti and syn BH products are predicted for Z and E enolates, respectively. An interesting secondary orbital iriteraction between the oxygen atoms of the enolate and aldehyde moieties in the transition states for the C-C bond formation is identified as one of the contributing factors toward the predicted diastercoselectivity in the formation of the alpha-chloromethyl aldol product (P 2). It has earlier been reported that Under different experimental conditions, any of the three products such as (i) a normal <b>BH</b> <b>product</b> (P 1), (ii) 2 -(chloromethyl) vinyl ketones (M), and (iii) alpha-chloro methyl aldol could be generated (Scheme 1). The present study offers valuable insights toward rationalizing the observed product distribution as well as diastereoselectivity in TiCl(4) -promoted BH reaction under base-free conditions. The computed energetics indicate that when MVK is employed as the Michael acceptor, the formation of 2 -(choromethyl) vinyl ketone is the preferred product rather than the corresponding normal <b>BH</b> <b>product,</b> consistent with the known experimental reports...|$|E
40|$|Cobalt ferrite {{nanoparticles}} {{have been}} synthesized using a co-precipitation approach. Co:Fe precursor ratio is varied over a certain window (1. 05 to 1. 2). It is {{observed that the}} 1. 15 : 2 precursor ratio gives better phase control but poor coercivity. On the other hand, 1. 05 : 2 precursor ratio results in substantially better coercivity values (274 kA/m; almost 300 % the value reported for co-precipitated cobalt ferrite by Praveena et al.), but moderate <b>BH</b> <b>product</b> maximum (2. 25 kJ/m 3; ~ comparable to many reports on cobalt ferrite nanoparticles so far). The nanoparticles with best coercivity are annealed at 873 K for varying durations (2, 4, 6, 12 hrs). It is observed that the coercivity drops drastically (almost by 80 %) after annealing for 2 hours. However thereafter coercivity and saturation magnetization improves marginally with increasing duration of annealing. These studies, along with thermogravimetric analysis, and infrared spectroscopic results indicate that a hydroxide nanophase based flux pinning mechanism at the grain boundary {{plays an important role}} in explaining the observed magnetic property trends. It is believed that this result will be generically helpful in developing soft chemically derived ferrites with higher coercivity and moderate (BH) max. However to develop plausible applications using the reported ferrites that use nanophase flux pinning, soft materials and device processing methods will need to be explored.

We use the fact that the C*-algebra generated by integrating pi to L^ 1 (G) is unital exactly when pi is norm continuous to show that Gamma_pi(L^ 1 (G)) ⊂ B(H) ⊗^ehB(H) exactly when pi is norm continuous. For the case that G is abelian, we study Gamma_pi(M(G)) as a subset of the Varopoulos algebra. We also characterise positive definite elements of the Varopoulos algebra in terms of completely positive operators. Comment: 29 pages. Accepted in Indiana Univ. math...|$|R
40|$|A {{systematic}} {{investigation of}} structure and intrinsic magnetic {{properties of the}} compounds Sm 3 Fe 29 -xTx (T = V and Cr) and their nitrides has been performed. Nitrogenation resulted in remarkable improvements in the saturation magnetization and anisotropy fields at 4. 2 K and room temperature. First order magnetization processes are observed at around 5. 7 T for Sm 3 Fe 26. 7 V 2. 3 and around 2. 8 T for Sm 3 Fe 24. 0 Cr 5. 0 and Sm 3 Fe 24. 0 Cr 5. 0 N 4, respectively. The spin reorientation of the easy magnetization direction of Sm 3 Fe 26. 7 V 2. 3 is observed at around 230 K. As a preliminary result, the maximum remanence B-r of 0. 94 T, the coercivity mu(0) H(C) of 0. 75 T, and the maximum energy <b>product</b> (<b>BH)</b> of 108. 5 kJ/m(3) for the nitride magnet Sm 3 Fe 26. 7 V 2. 3 N 4 are achieved by ball-milling at 293 K...|$|R
