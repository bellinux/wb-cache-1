Application of iodoform in a hybrid fermentation system was investigated to determine the potential for increased lactic acid production by inhibiting undesirable microbes which can metabolize lactic acid. Iodoform treatment rates of 0, 0. 03, 0. 06, 0. 11, and 0. 23 g/kg dry matter (DM) were applied to a swine manure-corn stover substrate, containing 60 % manure, adjusted to 65 % moisture on a wet basis and ensiled for 0, 1, 7, and 21 days. A hemicellulase-cellulase enzyme mixture was also applied to all samples at a rate of 5 and 12. 5 IU/g DM of hemicellulase and cellulase activity, respectively. Samples were analyzed for pH, water soluble carbohydrates, and organic acids. A substantial decrease in pH was observed in all treatments, but none of the treatments reached a pH of 4. 5, which is sufficient for stable storage of corn stover biomass at 65 % moisture. Lactic and acetic acid production was increased with application of iodoform at 0. 23 g/kg DM. Iodoform was also found to inhibit <b>butyric</b> <b>fermentation,</b> with a rate of 0. 23 g/kg DM determined to be appropriate.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between C. tyrobutyricum, C. sporogenes and C. beijerinckii in experimental cheese conditions, and their influences on late-blowing and <b>butyric</b> <b>fermentation,</b> have been investigated. A molecular approach using a PCR-TTGE method {{in combination with}} conventional methods, such as microbiological and physico-chemical analysis, was performed to monitor the evolution of these clostridial species, simultaneously with the occurrence of cheese defects. Sixteen Emmental type cheeses were produced from milk inoculated with different clostridial spore associations. In all cheeses inoculated with C. tyrobutyricum, obvious signs of late blowing were detected. In cheeses inoculated with C. beijerinckii or C. sporogenes, a formation of holes in cheese body was observed, with a concomitant slight amount of butyric acid production. Even though C. beijerinckii and C. sporogenes were less metabolically active and less numerically important than C. tyrobutyricum cheese as shown by TTGE profiles, the association of these species to C. tyrobutyricum enhanced the <b>butyric</b> <b>fermentation</b> and the cheese defects. The level of butyric content in ripened cheese increased to 268 mg 100 g(- 1) in presence of C. tyrobutyricum, and reached a maximum of 414 mg 100 g(- 1) in presence of the C. beijerinckii-C. tyrobutyricum (1 : 10) association. The propionic fermentation was also higher in cheese inoculated with C. tyrobutyricum, and was slowed down in presence of C. beijerinckii and C. sporogenes. From 30 days of ripening, {{a strong correlation between}} the chemical contents and the intensity of cheese defects was demonstrated.

40|$|In {{a closed}} ecologic niche in {{organism}} hydrogen-producing fermentation reactor, non-organism factors to influence organism fermentation rate and fermentation product ingredient normally contain temperature, pH and organic elements, etc. Physiological ecology {{is about how}} organism adapts the change of ecological factors in the ecologic niche through physiological reaction and adjustment. This adjustment {{is very important for}} acid-producing phase fermentation bacteria to adapt the change of ecological factors and influences terminal fermentation product ingredient. Each kind of fermentation bacteria has special fermentation types, such as propionic acid <b>fermentation,</b> <b>butyric</b> acid <b>fermentation,</b> ethanol fermentation or lactic acid fermentation, etc. When ecological factors change, fermentation bacteria will also change conversion rate of all terminal fermentation products through normal physiological regulation of organism even if fermentation-type does not change. <b>Butyric</b> acid-type <b>fermentation</b> type in acid-producing phase often occurs during two-phase anaerobic biological treatment. Terminal <b>fermentation</b> products of <b>butyric</b> acid-type <b>fermentation</b> usually contain a lot of propionic acid product. As a matter of fact, this is a consequence to adjust physiological metabolism equilibrium of fermentation bacteria. If ethanol is terminal product of liquid phase, effect of terminal product on normal metabolic process not only can be avoided, but also orderly fermentation can be obtained for oxidation–reduction. Hydrogen partial pressure in the reactor greatly influences ethanol conversion rate. It is known that ethanol can be accumulated only when hydrogen partial pressure is more than 104 Pa.

To demonstrate the causative relationship between Clostridium tyrobutyricum and late blowing in cheese, many cheesemaking experiments were performed to provoke this defect by using spores from several strains of the major dairy-related clostridia. A method of PCR amplification of a part of the 16 S rRNA gene in combination with hybridization with species-specific DNA probes was developed to allow the specific detection of clostridial sequences in DNAs extracted from cheeses. The sensitivity was increased by using nested PCR. Late blowing was provoked in experimental cheeses with 28 of the 32 C. tyrobutyricum strains tested, whereas experimental cheeses made with spores from C. beijerinckii, C. butyricum, and C. sporogenes showed no signs of <b>butyric</b> acid <b>fermentation.</b> In all experimental and commercial cheeses with obvious signs of late blowing, DNA from C. tyrobutyricum was detected; in some cheeses, signals for C. beijerinckii were also found.

30|$|Mariano et al. [81] {{proposed}} {{a mathematical model}} for a continuous flash fermentation and used this model to optimize the process using response surface techniques. In other work, Mariano et al. [82] used the same model proposed by Mariano et al. [81], but the process was optimized using the method of particle swarm optimization to obtain the best operating conditions for butanol production. The same authors proposed the utilization of a servo control in flash fermentation [18]. This work was carried out because in previous studies it has been proved that this process {{can be used to}} improve <b>butyric</b> <b>fermentation.</b> So it becomes necessary to control the removal of butanol, since natural oscillations can occur during the dynamic process. The mathematical modeling is similar to the one used in [17] with some minor changes in the differential equations due to the alteration of the reaction volume. The objective of the control was to keep sugar and butanol concentrations constant in the fermentor. The controller was shown to efficiently regulate the operating conditions. Thus, the use of a controller in flash fermentation is able to enlarge the process, and suit this to an industrial application.|$|E
30|$|In {{tropical}} and subtropical regions, the ensiling process often yields only {{poor quality}} silage. Two {{of the reasons}} are <b>butyric</b> <b>fermentation</b> by butyric acid bacteria and consumption of the nutrients in the silage by coliform bacteria (Tanaka et al. 1994). Butyric acid is usually produced at high temperatures (30 - 50 °C) by butyric acid bacteria, which {{have the ability to}} grow under those conditions. Therefore, to prevent proliferation of butyric acid bacteria and coliform bacteria, silage-making LAB must be capable of rapid growth and high production of lactic acid at high temperatures. Much effort has gone into improving the quality of silage (Weinberg et al. 2007; Lindsey and Kung Jr. 2010; Parvin et al. 2010). In those studies, LABs grown at room temperature showed great ability {{to improve the quality of}} silage. However, it was unclear whether strains showing high lactic acid production could grow ahead of butyric acid bacteria or coliform bacteria at higher temperatures (> 37 °C), which will be necessary for potentially useful candidates to adapt to tropical and subtropical regions. To prepare potential inoculants for ensilage at high temperature, we isolated LABs from silage prepared in southwestern Japan, where the weather can be hot and humid.|$|E
40|$|In {{the current}} context of waste recovering, {{production}} {{of renewable energy}} and reduction of greenhouse gases emission, anaerobic digestion (AD) is a technology receiving increasing interest. AD is a biological process, which allows the degradation of organic waste, related to human activity, producing a biogas storable and recoverable {{in the form of}} energy. Substrates are often selected according to their biodegradability and availability. Therefore, crop residues, such as wheat straws, are interesting because of their high abundance and low cost. However the low biodegradability of such lignocellulosic materials must to be considered. Similarly, agroindustrial organic waste are interesting due to their fast degradation, but the preservation of this seasonal waste might become problematic when considering the feeding of continuous AD reactors throughout the year. Silage represents an interesting storage technology but, difficult to be applied on agroindustrial organic waste because of their high water content. The use of a co-substrate having high solid contents, such as wheat straw, could be an innovative solution by reducing the water content of the waste mixture. Indeed, silage or anaerobic fermentation might be a way to maintain the methane potential of agroindustrial organic waste while pre-treating lignocellulosic materials due to the acidification of the silage process. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the potential of ensiling a mixture of fresh seasonal agroindustrial waste with wheat straw for long term storage prior to AD process. Furthermore, the effect of the initial substrate mixtures on the metabolic pathways followed was investigated. Anaerobic fermentation was performed at laboratory-scale in batch tests. A mixture of beet leaves and wheat straw was carried out to obtain a Total Solid (TS) of 35 %. This mixture was introduced in 50 plastic vacuum-packed bags and stored in a dark room at ambient temperature. Three bags were analysed periodically in triplicates at 10 different storage times from 0 to 180 days. Different analyses were performed: biogas production and composition, concentrations of nitrogen, carbon, soluble sugars and metabolites, as well as a monitoring of the microbial communities by 16 S rRNA sequencing (MiSeq). Finally, the methane potential was assessed in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the storage. As results, beet leaves contained initially soluble sugars (25. 5 g Glucose/gTS; 45 g Xylose/gTS) and microbial metabolites (30. 9 g Lactate/gTS; 27 g Acetate/gTS). The presence of lactic acid indicates that the fermentation process partially occurred before the start of the experiment. During the storage step, sugars were consumed and a succession of metabolic pathways was clearly observed. Interestingly, a lactic fermentation pathway was followed by <b>butyric</b> <b>fermentation,</b> homoacetogenesis and then methanogenesis. Microbial community characterization by New Generation Sequencing is under progress. These results will provide better understanding of the fermentation process with the succession of metabolic pathways. These different pathways did not affect the methane potential during the storage. Even though no improvement of the biodegradability of wheat straw was observed, mixing wheat straw with beet leaves was successful to store fresh waste. To determine the effect of more specifics substrate characteristics (e. g. sugar content) on the metabolic pathways followed, experiments are currently in progress. Moreover, inoculation with lactic acid bacteria is also investigated to redirect the process towards lactic acid fermentation. To conclude, this study has shown that anaerobic storage is a relevant solution to long term storage of fresh biodegradable biomass prior to anaerobic digestion...|$|E

40|$|Plant {{proteins}} in vegetable meals (VM) and oils {{are used in}} an increasing percentage in diets for carnivorous fish to replace fish meal (FM) and fish oil (FO) {{in order to reduce}} production costs and to face the limitation of marine resources and to be sustainable in respect to the protection of oceanic biodiversity. However, several studies report that fish respond to such replacements by reducing growth rate, feed conversion and fillet quality. It may be due to a deficiency or poor availability in VM ingredients of some essential amino acids, but also to the occurrence of anti-nutritionals and inflammatory compounds acting on the fish intestine. This can lead to economic losses for fish farmers, increased fish diseases occurrence, and negative environmental impact. This study focuses on European sea bass and Rainbow trout, as two among the most commercially important fish species in Italy. Aims of the study are to improve feed formulation and optimize feed additives such taurine, as well as butyrate, salt of a short chain fatty acid (SCFA), to protect fish intestine and evaluate the effects on fish fillet quality of the modern commercial diets where FM is partially substitute with VM. In that context, our experimental study investigated butyrate and taurine in the diet, as nutraceutics able to reduce or minimize the negative effects of VM inclusion in fish performances and health. After improvement of analytical methods for butyrate titration in fecal samples, the possibility that a <b>butyric</b> <b>fermentation</b> occurs in fish intestine has been experimentally evaluated. The protective effect of butyrate on fish intestine has been studied by following approaches including histology with light and electronic microscopy, then a molecular approach to study inflammatory cytokines, as well as the epigenetic action of this SCFA. In spite, dietary butyrate showed no significant differences in weight gain or SGR (specific growth rate) of sea bass, the protective effect on the intestine walls was highlighted, together with its epigenetic effects on hiperacetylation histone H 4 at lysine 8, while no effects has been found on the histone H 3 at Lys 9. A butyrate effect on the liver, as an increased transcriptional expression of the genes Dicer 1, ehmt 2, and hdac 11 and il- 10 have been assessed, suggesting an anti-inflammatory as well as an antiviral role of butyrate in seabass receiving a 2 % of Na-butyrate as diet supplement. The effect of a dietary supplementation of the sulphonic aminoacid taurine, almost absent in the VM, was studied on seabass growth performances and on its potential role as antioxidant. Seabass fed with 1. 5 % taurine addition showed an increase of the fish growth performance and a marked reduction of the ROS production under resting conditions that was enhanced following forced swimming performances. The synergistic effect of butyrate and taurine as feed additives was also explored in seabass feeding diet containing an elevate concentration of a soy protein. Different cytological protective mechanisms have been observed, indicating the existence of a synergistic action of the two nutraceutical compounds. The quality of fish fillet in trout fed with 6 different commercial feed where FM was differently substituted by VM, has been studied by assessing the fillet lipidograms. Trout was utilized in this study as is know for the capacity to elongate and desaturate the n- 3 long chain fatty acid EPA in DHA. The EPA/DHA ratio in feed and in fillet were expected to be modified by the fish, with an increased restitution of DHA as consequence of a reduction in EPA. Actually, such a dynamic was observed in fish fed with only 4 of the challenged commercial feed and {{that was supposed to be}} due to an effect on the fatty acids metabolism, following an unbalancement of the essential aminoacids in the diets where higher substitution of FM with VM was operated. In conclusion, a number of the expected negative effects due the FM substitution with VM have been actually assessed. On the same time, the possibility to mitigate such negative performances with diet manipulation have been documented as well. Beside some practical results immediately applicable by the fish farming industry, indications for further researches are emerging from this study...|$|E
30|$|In-situ {{removal of}} the acids from the {{fermentation}} broth {{could be one of}} the solutions to reduce product inhibition (Zigova and Sturdik 2000). Using simultaneous solvent extraction, this technique was applied on <b>butyric</b> acid <b>fermentation</b> by Clostridium butyricum (Zigova et al. 1999). The problem with this technique is that an immiscible or partially immiscible organic solvent can be toxic to the bacteria. To minimize the toxic effect of the organic solvent, a fibrous bed bioreactor was developed successfully and used for <b>butyric</b> acid <b>fermentation</b> by Clostridium tyrobutyricum (Wu and Yang 2003). Application of in situ electrodialysis is an alternative method where no organic solvents are used and toxic effects are thus eliminated. This technique was tested for lactic (Boniardi et al. 1997), acetic, propionic (Zhang et al. 1993) and even for butyric acid extraction (Du et al. 2012 a) and higher productivity was reported in all cases. Electrodialysis includes an anion exchange membrane (for acid–anion separation) and is subject to limitations by fouling effects. A relatively new technique, Reverse Electro Enhanced Dialysis, REED, (Rype and Jonsson 2002; Prado-Rubio et al. 2011) has been reported to be superior in that respect and it has so far been successfully applied to lactic acid extraction (Garde 2002) and recombinant protein production (Madsen et al. 2006). The REED system continuously removes acid anions from the fermentation broth by replacing them with hydroxide ions. This ion exchange also provides stabilization of the pH in the reactor. Thus, the usual practice of regulating the pH by adding a base (NaOH, KOH or NH 4 OH) can be avoided and inhibition from cations, especially when high amounts of acids are produced, is consequently prevented.|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: An {{investigation}} {{was made of}} the processes occurring during the ensiling of sugar-beet pulp. Pulp was enclosed in rubber bags buried in a silo to obtain the same conditions of pressure and temperature as prevail in the silo itself. An outlet from the bags was provided for the measurement of evolved gases and seepage. Pulp alone was compared with pulp + 4 yo molasses. The process was followed by withdrawing bags at short intervals, and making bacteriological and chemical examinations of the contents. The addition of molasses resulted in a pure lactic acid fermentation of the sucrose with very small losses in dry matter. Few butyric acid bacteria were found. Where molasses was not added a vigorous <b>butyric</b> acid <b>fermentation</b> of hexosans and pentosans occurred, resulting in 12 - 15 yo loss of dry matter due to seepage and formation of CO,, the number of butyric acid bacteria rising to 10 g-lOIO/g. silage. The initial flora of lactic bacteria consisted of Betacoccus arabinosaceus Orla Jensen, which was soon displaced by Streptobacterium plantarum and 8. cmei Orla Jensen.

Under mesophilic conditions (370 C) and an initial pH value of 6. 0, higher H 2 ̆ 082 yields were observed for the 02 occulated cultures {{when compared to}} the granular cultures. The maximum yield for granular cultures treated acid, BESA or LA were statistically the same. <b>Butyric</b> acid <b>fermentation</b> was dominant in a majority of the treated cultures. The maximum hydrogenase evolution speci 01 c activity (ESA) (124 1 8 Ue mg VSS 2 ̆ 07 b 9) at 370 C correlated with the maximum H 2 ̆ 082 yield for the LA treated 02 occulated cultures (1. 69 1 0. 18 mol mol 2 ̆ 07 b 9 glucose). The microbial diversity data clearly showed that the low H 2 ̆ 082 yield in the granular cultures was due to the lower proportion of H 2 ̆ 082 producers. A principle component analysis (PCA) revealed that the LA treated 02 occulated and granular cultures were grouped together and showed more diversity in comparison to other pretreatment methods.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of different silage additives on different mixtures of white lupin and spring wheat {{was investigated in}} four separate trials. The bicrop was harvested 96 days (trials 1 and 2) and 110 days (trials 3 and 4) after sowing. For each maturity stage, two mixtures of white lupin and spring wheat were reformed in the ratios of 1 : 2 and 2 : 1 on fresh matter (FM) basis respectively. The crops were treated with formic acid (FA), sodium nitrite–hexamine mixture (NaHe) or homofermentative lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The control silage was made without additive. Additives {{were not able to}} improve the quality of white lupin–wheat silage in all trials, compared with untreated silage. The treatment with LAB showed good results only at the first stage of crop maturity with sufficient amounts of water-soluble carbohydrate in the pre-ensiling crops. The FA treatment showed elevated butyric acid levels in all trials, which suggests that the FA application level used (4 L t 1 FM, 100 % FA) was insufficient to decrease pH enough for preventing the growth of clostridia and <b>butyric</b> acid <b>fermentation.</b> NaHe was the only additive that was able to inhibit the activity of clostridia in all trials...|$|R

40|$|The aim was {{to study}} the {{influence}} {{of the quality of the}} agricultural waste materials to the process of producing hydrogen group of microorganisms. Researches were conducted by microbiological and chromatographic methods of analysis. The process of producing hydrogen passes using agricultural waste in anaerobic mesophilic regime for the use of groups of microorganisms. On all types of waste found production of hydrogen. The pretreatment of raw material increases access of microorganisms to nutrients, destruction of lignino-cellulosic frame and decontamination of methanegenic bacterias. The aging of culture leads to transition the <b>butyric</b> type of <b>fermentation</b> to acetone-butyric type, which causes decreasing the yield of hydrogen. The maximum yield of hydrogen was 128 g H 2 per kg of cellulose. It was obtained by using barley straw as raw material, which contains great amount of hemicelluloses...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – Split and {{secondary}} fermentation defects in Swiss-type cheese varieties are manifested as undesirable slits or cracks {{that may lead}} to downgrading of the cheese. Split defect is associated with an excessive production of gas or an unsuitable cheese body that cannot accommodate gas produced, or a combination of both factors. Secondary fermentation is the apparent production of gas after the desired propionic fermentation of the warm room has taken place. No consensus exists as to the definitive causes of the defects, but possible causes are reviewed under factors that are associated with rheological behaviour (including cheese manufacture, acidification, intact protein content and proteolysis, seasonality of milk supply and ripening or storage temperature and duration) or with overproduction of gas (including milk microflora, propionic acid bacteria (PAB) – in particular strains with high aspartase activity and ability to grow at low temperatures, lactic acid bacteria, interactions between starter bacteria, facultatively heterofermentative lactobacilli (FHL) and other sources of gas including <b>butyric</b> acid <b>fermentation).</b> The influence of other parameters such as copper concentration, air incorporation, salt content, rind formation and cheese wrapping materials is also considered. Methods to reduce the prevalence of the split defect {{and secondary}} fermentation include addition of water to improve elastic properties by the removal of unfermented carbohydrate and the use of FHL to control PAB activity to prevent the production of excessive gas...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} pH (between 5. 0 and 6. 3) on <b>butyric</b> acid <b>{{fermentation}}</b> of xylose by Clostridium tyrobutyricum was studied. At pH 6. 3, the fermentation gave a high butyrate production of 57. 9 g l− 1 with a yield of 0. 38 – 0. 59 g g− 1 xylose and a reactor productivity up to 3. 19 g l− 1 h− 1. However, at low pHs (< 5. 7), the fermentation produced more acetate and lactate {{as the main}} products, with {{only a small amount}} of butyric acid. The metabolic shift from butyrate formation to lactate and acetate formation in the fermentation was found to be associated with changes in the activities of several key enzymes. The activities of phospho-transbutyrylase (PTB), which is the key enzyme controlling butyrate formation, and NAD-independent lactate dehydrogenase (iLDH), which catalyzes the conversion of lactate to pyruvate, were higher in cells producing mainly butyrate at pH 6. 3. In contrast, cells at pH 5. 0 had higher activities of phosphotransacetylase (PTA), which is the key enzyme controlling acetate for-mation, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), which catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to lactate. Also, PTA was very sensitive to the inhibition by butyric acid. Difference in the specific metabolic rate of xylose at different pHs suggests that the balance in NADH is a key in controlling the metabolic pathway used by the cells in the fermentation...|$|R
