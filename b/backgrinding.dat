5000|$|After BEOL {{there is}} a [...] "back-end process" [...] (also called post-fab), which is done not in the cleanroom, often by a {{different}} company.It includes wafer test, wafer <b>backgrinding,</b> die separation, die tests, IC packaging and final test.|$|E
40|$|With {{shrinking}} technologies evolving, {{new products}} are launched in fine pitches, {{not only from}} a pad pitch standpoint but also from a reduction in distance between line widths, narrower scribe widths with e-test patterns built on the scribes, after a straight shrink in dimensions. The need for <b>backgrind</b> wafers has become critical with package thickness reducing to as low as 0. 7 mm. Thinner wafers {{are more prone to}} cracks even before saw because of the stress management during the <b>backgrind</b> process. This paper focuses mainly on backside chipping issues as a result of crack propagation during saw. With the critical parameters like saw blade and cutting speed, one can control this process to some extent for these thin and narrow saw streets between dies on a wafer. The maximum stress analysis effectively indicates the location of maximum bending stress on the die during dicing process while the principle of fracture mechanics subsequently predicts the theoretical critical crack length for which the presence of micro-void or crack will propagate, thus leading to a brittle fracture on the backside of the die. This paper begins with the material aspects of the bare wafer and goes on to explain a simpl...|$|R
5000|$|As an {{alternative}} to immersion, single wafer machines use the Bernoulli principle to employ a gas (usually, pure nitrogen) to cushion and protect {{one side of the}} wafer while etchant is applied to the other side. It can be done to either the front side or back side. The etch chemistry is dispensed on the top side when in the machine and the bottom side is not affected. This etch method is particularly effective just before [...] "backend" [...] processing (BEOL), where wafers are normally very much thinner after wafer <b>backgrinding,</b> and very sensitive to thermal or mechanical stress. Etching a thin layer of even a few micrometres will remove microcracks produced during <b>backgrinding</b> resulting in the wafer having dramatically increased strength and flexibility without breaking.|$|E
50|$|After {{preparing}} {{a large number}} of MEMS devices on a silicon wafer, individual dies have to be separated, which is called die preparation in semiconductor technology. For some applications, the separation is preceded by wafer <b>backgrinding</b> {{in order to reduce the}} wafer thickness. Wafer dicing may then be performed either by sawing using a cooling liquid or a dry laser process called stealth dicing.|$|E
40|$|We {{proposed}} the wet-chemical Si wafer-thinning process and evaluated {{the damage caused}} by this process. For the damage evaluation, we measured the die fracture stress and fracture energy, and compared various wafer-thinning processes (<b>backgrinding,</b> wet-chemical Si wafer-thinning, <b>backgrinding</b> + chemical mechanical polishing, <b>backgrinding</b> + wet etching). The result of comparative study shows that wet-chemical wafer-thinning processing has very high fracture stress/energy demonstrating that the damage of wet-chemical Si wafer-thinning process is very small...|$|E
40|$|Edge {{chipping}} during <b>backgrinding</b> {{is one of}} {{the main}} challenges of processing temporarily bonded wafers. The edge chipping may propagate during subsequent process steps and eventually result in yield loss. We conducted a study to compare different methodologies for wafer edge protection during <b>backgrinding,</b> including using pre-thinned carrier wafers, large carrier wafers, edge-trimmed device wafers, and material edge modification. This paper will introduce the metrology developed to quantify edge chipping and compare the results from different protection methods...|$|E
40|$|The {{trend in}} die size {{decrease}} of the microelectronics circuits {{has been driven}} by modern IC manufacturing technology. Due to its brittle nature, high stresses induced in the die due to packaging, assembly and reliability test could result in detrimental fracture in the die. Due to its large diameter and thin layer, determination of the fracture strength of a silicon wafer would be difficult. Thus it is more applicable for silicon strength to be characterized at die level. This paper discusses the approach for the characterization of silicon die failure strength employing a simple three-point bending test, thereby providing {{a better understanding of the}} stress accumulated in the die before failure. The effects of die thickness, die size and <b>backgrinding</b> patterns on the die stress have been investigated. The results showed that the die strength is largely dependent on its geometry and damages due to wafer processes (surface/edge defects and <b>backgrinding</b> pattern). A set of thickness dependent threshold stress values for die failure has been obtained for wafers that have undergone mechanical grinding. The determined failure stress values would be useful for solving future die failure problems encountered in new packaging and process development work...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the warpage on {{the backside of}} silicon wafer after thinning process. The thinning process includes after <b>backgrinding</b> (BG) and after wet etching (WE). The results on wafer warpage were linked to transmission electron microscopy analysis. This is purposely to explain the correlation between warpage and depth of damage. Results showed that deep backside damage would induce high wafer warpage, hence reduced wafer strength and create difficulty during handling. Further study on surface roughness and topography of each surface finish is obtained by atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy techniques. They indicated that low surface roughness {{is determined by the}} smooth surface condition, which goes to after wet etching process...|$|E
40|$|A {{new process}} scheme is {{proposed}} that allows manufacturing of 20 µm thin fully processed wafers.

Well established <b>backgrinding</b> and etching techniques are used for wafer thinning. To avoid mechanical damage of thin ICs the "Dicing-by-Thinning" (DbyT) concept is introduced to process flow. Best results are obtained when preparing dry etched chip grooves at front side of device wafer and opening these trenches during backside thinning. The new process scheme was also applied to wafers with highly topographic surfaces. Results of 40 µm thin wafers with 15 µm high Nickel bumps are presented. The "DbyT"-concept {{is supposed to be}} a technological basis for an economical manufacturing process for new ultra thin microelectronic products like "Smart Labels"...|$|E
40|$|Ultra thin ICs {{will play}} an {{important}} role in future packaging applications for smart and flexible systems. Thinned silicon gets more and more mechanically flexible with thickness below 50 µm and can be bended with a low radius of curvature. But it still remains a brittle material and therefore the applied thinning and dicing technology has to be analyzed. The influence of the thinning techniques, grinding, wet-chemical etching and polishing on the material properties of thinned silicon was investigated by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), carrier lifetime measurements and X-ray inspection. Experimental results are correlated to mechanical fracture tests. The investigations prove the suitability of the stress-relief processes etching and polishing for the restoration of crystalline quality. However, for silicon wafers in the thickness range of 100 µm to 50 µm <b>backgrinding</b> process causes an increasing depth of damage. This will lead to important consequences for the choice of appropriate wafer thinning techniques if ultra thin ICs are fabricated...|$|E
40|$|Ultra thin chips with a {{thickness}} below 30 µm offer low system height, low topography {{and show}} enhanced mechanical flexibility. These properties enable diverse use possibilities and new applications. However, advanced wafer thinning, adapted assembly and interconnec-tion methods {{are required for}} this technology.

40|$|WL-CSP {{is a low}} profile, true {{chip size}} package that is entirely built on a wafer using {{front-end}} and back end processing. The wafers can be batch-processed in a fab, which reduces the number of materials and packaging steps, reduces inventory, and allows for wafer level burn in and test. This technology is driven by cost, size, and ease of testing and is ideal for low to mid I/O devices. Peripheral bondpads from the die are redistributed into an area array using a photodielectric and a redistribution metal, {{eliminating the need for}} a substrate or interposer. Solder balls are placed onto the redistributed metal bondpads and reflowed, creating a large standoff which improves reliability. The bump structure and pad geometry of the test vehicle was optimized using simulation and validated by experimentation. This WL-CSP technology was evaluated using a 5 x 5 mm 2 die with a 0. 5 mm pitch 8 x 8 array of solder bumps. Board level reliability was performed using 1. 2 mm thick, 2 -layer FR- 4 boards with 0. 25 mm non-soldermask defined copper pads coated with OSP. Standard thickness WL-CSP wafers are 27 -mils. An evaluation was performed to evaluate the potential reliability improvement of WL-CSPs by thinning the wafers. Wafers were thinned down to 4 -mils thickness using two techniques. The first method is standard wafer <b>backgrinding.</b> The second is the novel approach of plasma etching, which results in a damage-free surface and improves wafer and die strength. Board level reliability will be presented comparing standard WL-CSPs to those thinned using the aforementioned techniques...|$|E
40|$|Wafers warp. It is {{important}} to minimize warpage {{in order to achieve}} optimal die yield and potentially prevent future device failure. Although the word warpage is widely used in the literature to represent wafer bow (convex or concave shape), in the real world wafers are often seen into warp into saddle shapes. This complicates the characterization of both the sources of and solutions to warpage, because (as will be discussed) Stoney’s formula (relating intrinsic stress and curvature) does not apply for structures warped with compound curvature, and standard wafer warpage measurements are not designed to measure compound curvature. During thin film deposition, wafer warpage occurs due to the intrinsic stresses and the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch of the different thin films and the substrate. Unfortunately, whereas the introduction of the thermal stresses due to CTE mismatch into a finite element model is easily understood, the introduction of intrinsic stress is not. Further, although a saddle shape is clearly a physically realizable (indeed, often preferred) equilibrium configuration for a circular disk (consistent with an appropriate state of stress), obtaining a saddle shape in a finite element solution turns out to be extremely difficult, as convex or concave shapes may also be stable and numerically preferred. In this paper, a finite element technique (using ANSYS software) to model wafer warpage is presented. Simulations have been done for silicon wafers with aluminum or standard UBM films on top. Saddle-shaped warpage has been successfully modeled, and the aggravating effects of thinning (back side grinding) have been reproduced.

40|$|Continuous {{increase}} {{in demand for}} product miniaturization, high package density, high performance and integration of different functional chips has {{lead to the development}} of three dimensional packaging technologies. Face-to-face silicon (Si) dies stacking is one of the three dimensional (3 D) packaging technologies to form a high density module. In this work, a chip level stacked module was demonstrated for medical application and assessed its package level reliability. The chip level stack module is achieved by stacking two thin dies of different size and thickness together using flip chip technology with micro bump interconnects. Electrical simulations are carried out to obtain RLC parameters of micro bump interconnect and complete interconnection from daughter die to substrate. Mechanical simulations are also carried out to study the stress analysis on micro bumps and CSP bumps in the package and parametric study of stacked module package to study the effect of substrate material, underfill material die thicknesses on package reliability and warpage. Test chips are designed and fabricated with daisy chain test structures to access the reliability of the stack module. Pb-free (SnAg) micro bumps of 40 μm on daughter die wafers and Eutectic SnPb solder CSP bumps of 200 μm height on Mother die wafers are fabricated. Mother die and daughter die bumped wafers were thinned to 300 μm and 60 μm respectively using mechanical <b>backgrinding</b> method. These thin dies are stacked using chip to wafer flip chip bonding and underfill process is established for the micro bump interconnects. The assembled Si die stacked modules are subjected to JEDEC package level reliability tests in terms of temperature cycle test (TC), high temperature storage test (HTS), moisture sensitivity test level 1 (MST L 1) and MST L 3, and un-biased High accelerated stress test (uHAST) and results are presented. © 2009 IEEE...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents {{original work}} {{in the development of}} multi-strata subsurface infrared (1. 342 [mu]m) nanosecond pulsed laser die singulation (stealth dicing) to enable defect-free ultra-thin stacked memory dies. The over-arching contribution is the first comprehensive and systematic experimental study of stealth dicing, encompassing process physics and simulation, characterization, optimization, and integration, as well as operations management, including statistical process control, sensitivities, interactions, and risk analysis. This work exploits the multi-strata interactions between generated thermal shockwaves and the preceding dislocation layers formed to initiate controlled crack fractures that separate the individual dies from within the interior of the wafer as a method for significant singulation-related defect reduction and die strength enhancement. A new partial-stealth dicing before grinding (p-SDBG) integration based upon the tandem use of three-strata stealth dicing followed by static loading from <b>backgrinding</b> to complete full kerf separation has successfully demonstrated defect-free eight die stacks of 25 and 46 [mu]m thick 2 D NAND memory dies on high backside reflectance wafers for the first time. This work resulted in a 3. 5 % mean increase in memory/system test yield and has been used to realize production-worthy 64 GB retail memory products after passing reliability tests. Based on unit loadings at SanDisk Shanghai for 2014, this translates to annual cost savings averaging $ 12.
