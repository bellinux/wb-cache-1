This paper argues that this consideration should be explicit and consistent across policy areas. The most conceptually valid approach to the valuation of benefits from reduced risk is to base estimates on the required compensation for exposure to risk. An empirical estimate of required compensation is generated by measuring the statistical value of life based on data from the Canadian labor market. The estimated value of life is $ 5. 2 million in 1983 dollars. This is recommended as a useful lower bound estimate for a variety of public policy applications in Canada. In some applications, we argue that substantially higher values are required. ...|$|E

The UK’s approach to social insurance is “basic security”, with modest, typically flat-rate, benefits; insurance-based benefits are relatively unimportant.

Global Renewable energy policies, arising from increasing environmental concerns have set very ambitious targets for wind power penetration in electric power systems all over the world. Modern power system aims to provide reliable as well as cost effective power supply to its consumers. Reliability benefits, environmental benefits and operating cost savings from wind power integration should be compared with the associated investment costs in order to determine optimum transmission facility for wind power delivery. In this paper an analytical & probabilistic approach for reliability/cost analysis is presented for determining cost-effective transmission line size for wind power delivery. It describes the reliability/cost techniques for determining appropriate transmission line capacity to connect a wind farm to a power grid. The effects of site-specific wind regime, system load, transmission line unavailability, and redundancy on system reliability were studied using a basic system model. The methodology and results shown in this paper should be subsidiary in transmission system planning for delivering wind power to a power system...|$|E

In order to achieve this aim, an extensive literature review upon the concepts of equity and sustainable tourism was implemented. In addition, this study provides findings from a three-month fieldwork undertaken in a touristic area in Malawi.

40|$|Although {{major events}} can have 'spillover' effects on {{surrounding}} areas, their benefits are normally spatially concentrated. This automatically privileges certain neighbourhoods. Such outcomes {{may be difficult}} to justify politically, as resources to stage events are usually obtained from different public and private agencies that may be reluctant to favour a confined geographical area. This paper analyses opportunities for more diffuse spatial dissemination. Recognition of 'intangible' <b>benefits</b> <b>means</b> that event initiatives can be pursued even where there is no permanent physical legacy from an event, or where that legacy is concentrated elsewhere. In this paper, existing literature is reviewed and framed within a conceptual structure that highlights the three main ways peripheral areas can benefit from events for which they are not the principal host. These are: through 'incidental' effects, via the 'partial dislocation' of an event and by deploying various forms of 'leverage'. The paper then discusses three UK cases to illustrate this framework: the 2012 Olympic Games, the 2007 Tour de France and the 2002 Commonwealth Games. The paper concludes that the potential for considerable benefits for both core hosts and peripheral areas means stakeholders at both scales should be encouraged to make policy interventions to disperse event effects...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a central problem {{relating}} to bicycle promotion in Western Australia. Very few people currently ride {{to work in the}} Perth central buisness district. Australian Bureau of Statistics “journey to work ” data from 1996 revealed that 801 people were riding to work compared to 85, 000 people travelling by car. The major question then, is how can we motivate more people to use the bicycle mode to get to work and reduce our reliance on cars? Using the physical incentive of a free bike together with intensive health monitoring was predicted to {{be a good way to}} motivate individual car drivers to switch to bike riding for a minimum of four trips per week over a one year period.

40|$|Disability vs. {{retirement}} benefits: An {{important component}} of Social Security is its provision of disability benefits—not just retirement benefits. However, {{almost all of the}} discussion to date of reforming Social Security has focused on retiree benefits. While reforms that include an individual account may {{do a better job of}} providing retiree benefits, individual accounts are not as well suited to provide a disability benefit, due to the lost years of compounding and contributions to an account because a disabled worker is unable to work until reaching retirement age. As a result, many account proponents say disability benefits should be protected from any benefit cuts. Protecting disability <b>benefits</b> <b>means</b> deeper cuts elsewhere: If disability benefits are to be preserved at current-law levels, retiree benefits could be faced with cuts of an additional 25 percent to 40 percent (or an equivalent increase in revenue) above what would be needed to close the funding gap in the program. Length of receiving benefits: For those who begin to take Social Security benefits, the overwhelming majority receive these benefits for a considerable time; in fact, 85 percent or more will receive them for 10 or more years.

40|$|Excellent {{glycaemic}} {{control is}} essential in pregnancy to optimise maternal and foetal outcomes. The aim of this review is to assess the efficacy and safety of insulin analogues in pregnancy. Insulin lispro and insulin aspart are safe in pregnancy and may improve post-prandial glycaemic control in women with type 1 diabetes. However, a lack of data indicating improved foetal outcomes would {{suggest that there is}} no imperative to switch to a short-acting analogue where the woman's diabetes is well controlled with human insulin. There are no reports of the use of insulin glulisine in pregnancy and so its use cannot be recommended. Most studies of insulin glargine in pregnancy are small, retrospective and include women with pre-existing diabetes and gestational diabetes. There appear to be no major safety concerns and so it seems reasonable to continue insulin glargine if required to achieve excellent glycaemic control. A head-to-head comparison between insulin detemir and NPH insulin in women with type 1 diabetes showed that while foetal outcomes did not differ, fasting plasma glucose improved with insulin detemir without an increased incidence of hypoglycaemia. The greater evidence base supports the use of insulin detemir as the first line long-acting analogue in pregnancy but the lack of definitive foetal <b>benefits</b> <b>means</b> that there is no strong need to switch a woman who is well controlled on NPH insulin.

40|$|Health {{research}} always poses new challenges. Nursing staff constantly {{deal with}} such activities, either as researchers or research team members. The interaction between healthcare and research activities creates situations that are not found in other fields. Research always stems from a researcher’s idea, which materializes in a project. Once the project is approved by a Research Ethics Committee (REC), it is presented to potential participants. Such possibility is offered to participants {{in the form of}} an invitation, which may be accepted or not. This informed consent process is based on sharing essential information for people to understand what will be taking place in the course of research, ensuring their voluntary participation, and recognizing each person’s self-determination. On the other hand, healthcare primarily stems from patients’ needs as they seek a health professional or institution to see them. The relationship is established in order to offer help to those asking for it. The professional evaluates the different therapeuticalternatives available and their respective outcomes, whether they are risks or benefits, and shares the decision with the patient. As a result of such need, which may be an illness, for instance, the patienthas a vulnerability that must also be taken into account during the decision-making process. By combining healthcare and research, clinical research couples possibilities and needs, the role of participant andthat of a patient, a researcher’s activity and that of a healthcare professional. Such combination creates very special research situations that must be seen as healthcare also by all those involved. Therefore,nursing staff may interact with research participants even though they are not research team members. The new proposal to amend Resolution 196 / 96, approved in December 2012 by the Brazilian HealthCouncil (CNS), carries a few issues that should have been further discussed and thought through. One such issue is the possibility to compensate research project participants. Item II. 10 of the new resolution 196 / 96, 2012 version, brings the possibility to pay participants in phase I or bioequivalence clinical research. That regulatory change is quite worrisome as it opens up a possibility not previously providedfor or discussed. The version approved by the National Conference of Research Ethics Committees (ENCEP) held in 2012 to evaluate this new document did not contain such possibility. That version, whichis still available on the National Research Ethics Committee (CONEP) website, is the one meant to be discussed by the CNS. The 1996 version barred any form of compensation for participating in researchprojects under its item II. 10, which characterized what a “research subject” was. The resolution by the Brazilian Health Control Agency (RDC ANVISA 34 of July 3, 2008), specific for bioequivalence studies,also bars compensating participants. The new resolution 196 / 96, 2012 version, changes the text and proposes that “participation must be gratuitous, except for Phase I or bioequivalence clinical research. ”Gratuitous participation means not paying to participate, being gratuitous is characterized by the lack of payment. Not compensating means not paying someone for their specific participation in a research project, while holding on to the possibility of paying in the form of reimbursing the expenses deriving from their participation. This new wording may end up carrying multiple implications. The first and most evident one is that participants in these specific types of pharmacological research – phase I and bioequivalence studies – may be compensated for their participation. Most people participating in these studies, except for a few specific fields like Oncology and Psychiatry, are perfectly healthy people who do not have an associated healthcare need. They are merely research participants, not patients. Paying a healthy person to use a new drug from which that person will derive no <b>benefits</b> <b>means</b> expanding the individual’s vulnerability. It means adding an economic coercion factor that may compromise the voluntary nature of their consent. This new proposal may lead to an array of other consequences. Who will be considered the payer of these participants: the researcher, the sponsor, the proposing institution, a supporting foundation, or an organization hired for such purpose? Is such payment going to be made for services provided? What about studies involving patients, as in the case of some specialties, will they be given this same type of compensation? Another potentially puzzling issue regarding the replacement of no compensation with gratuitous participation is that projects may no longer be able to reimburse research participants for the expenses deriving from their acceptance, such as transportation and meals. A patient participating in a pharmacological study may have the benefit of continuing to receive a given medication, considering such patient will be having their need, which is prior to the research, met. A new vulnerability is not created in that case. Researchers are simply trying to allay a previously existingvulnerability. The change approved to resolution 196 / 96, 2012 version, may worsen the participants’ vulnerability and impact both research and healthcare. This is an extremely important issue to be discussedand thought through by CONEP and RECs across Brazil...|$|E
