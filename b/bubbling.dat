40|$|Abstract. This paper takes <b>bubbles</b> of <b>bubble</b> shell as {{research}} object, mainly studies two <b>bubbles</b> {{arranged in a}} vertical position. Applying VOF (volume of fluid) method to simulate interaction between two <b>bubbles,</b> analyses the effect of center distances and diameters on deformation and coalescence of <b>bubbles.</b> Results show that coalescence time of two <b>bubbles</b> with same diameters increases as the center distance increases. To two <b>bubbles</b> with different diameters, when the bigger <b>bubble</b> located beneath at the initial time, the smaller <b>bubble</b> moves upward first and then moves downward before two <b>bubbles</b> coalesce. When the smaller <b>bubble</b> located beneath at the initial time, <b>bubble</b> coalescence cannot happen. This paper {{is the basis of}} <b>bubble</b> group research, it is of positive significance to the <b>bubble</b> group research and performance improvement of <b>bubble</b> shell...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{motion and}} {{interactions}} of three equal-interval parallel <b>bubbles</b> in non-Newtonian fluids were numerically simulated by {{volume of fluid}} method (VOF), in which the continuous surface tension model and the power-law model were adopted to represent surface tension and rheological properties of non-Newtonian fluids, respectively. The computational method was validated by the comparison of the processes of coalescence of two in-line <b>bubbles</b> and rising of two parallel <b>bubbles</b> between experiment and simulation. This method was then applied to study the effect of initial <b>bubble</b> diameter, initial horizontal <b>bubble</b> interval and rheological properties of non-Newtonian fluids on lateral coalescence and rising of three parallel <b>bubbles.</b> The dimensionless critical horizontal interval of <b>bubble</b> coalescence was obtained under different physical property conditions. The critical horizontal interval of <b>bubble</b> coalescence decreases {{with the increase of}} initial <b>bubble</b> diameter and flow index of non-Newtonian fluids. When the initial horizontal <b>bubble</b> interval is less than the critical horizontal interval of <b>bubble</b> coalescence, three <b>bubbles</b> will coalesce into a bigger <b>bubble.</b> The coalescing <b>bubble</b> could breakup into two identical daughter <b>bubbles</b> when the initial <b>bubble</b> diameter was increased or the flow index of non-Newtonian fluids was decreased. Three parallel <b>bubbles</b> rising in non-Newtonian fluids will experience repulsive interactions once the initial horizontal <b>bubble</b> interval is greater than the critical horizontal interval of <b>bubble</b> coalescence, the horizontal <b>bubble</b> interval increased gradually owing to the repulsive effect, while the vertical distance between <b>bubbles</b> varied dramatically for spherical <b>bubble</b> and ellipsoidal <b>bubble</b> due to the differences of their flow field structures...|$|R

40|$|The <b>bubble</b> rise {{phenomena}} in different low concentration polymer solutions for higher Reynolds number {{are presented in}} this paper. The main characteristics, namely, the <b>bubble</b> velocity, the <b>bubble</b> trajectory and the drag relationship are investigated. The experiments were conducted in two different cylindrical columns at various liquid heights by introducing different <b>bubble</b> volumes (from 0. 1 mL to 20. 0 mL) corresponding to each height. The <b>bubble</b> rise velocity, <b>bubble</b> size and <b>bubble</b> trajectory were measured {{using a combination of}} non-intrusive-high speed photographic method and digital image processing. The parameters that significantly affect the rise of air <b>bubble</b> are identified. The <b>bubble</b> rise velocity of different volumes and the effect of liquid heights on the <b>bubble</b> rise velocity are analysed and discussed. The results show that the average <b>bubble</b> rise velocity increases with the increase in <b>bubble</b> volume for different low concentration polymer solutions and the <b>bubble</b> velocity is not dependant {{on the size of the}} test rig.

40|$|Time-evolutions of <b>bubble</b> vesiculation in {{viscous liquid}} are {{characterized}} by two stages, i. e., the <b>bubble</b> formation stage and the <b>bubble</b> coalescence stage. We {{have focused on the}} former stage of <b>bubble</b> vesiculation and investigated numerically <b>bubble</b> formation in decompressed viscous liquid. <b>Bubble</b> formation consists of nucleation and growth of <b>bubbles</b> due to the exsolution of volatile elements from liquid. In order to describe the <b>bubble</b> formation processes, we have developed a theoretical model, taking into account the <b>bubble</b> size distribution and the viscosity of liquid, on the base of the model proposed by Toramaru (J.

In low viscosity cases, the growth of <b>bubbles</b> is mainly controlled by the diffusive flux of volatile molecules to <b>bubbles.</b> The number density of <b>bubbles</b> is sensitive to the diffusivity of volatile element in liquid. On the other hand, <b>bubbles</b> hardly grow {{in the case of the}} extremely high viscosity. Therefore, <b>bubbles</b> continue to be formed in order to reduce the volatile oversaturation of liquid. In the case of the intermediate viscosity, <b>bubbles</b> grow to the large size slowly by the viscous resistance.

40|$|The present work is {{concerned}} with direct numerical simulations for the shock-bubble and bubble-bubble interactions using the improved ghost fluid method in which the Riemann solutions are utilized to diminish numerical oscillations near interfaces. The influence of <b>bubble</b> size and bubble-bubble distance on the collapse of in-line two <b>bubbles</b> and in-line three <b>bubbles</b> are investigated to understand {{the conditions under which}} the bubble-bubble interactions accelerate or decelerate the <b>bubble</b> collapse. It is shown that when the in-line <b>bubbles</b> collapse by the incident shock wave, the collapse of the downstream <b>bubble</b> can be accelerated by the shock waves due to the collapse of upstream <b>bubbles,</b> while the collapse of the upstream <b>bubbles</b> is decelerated by the expansion wave cased by the reflection of the incident shock wave at the surface of the downstream <b>bubbles.</b> Also, there exists the bubble-bubble distance in which the collapse of the downstream <b>bubble</b> is most accelerated. When the downstream <b>bubble</b> is smaller than the upstream <b>bubble,</b> the downstream <b>bubble</b> collapses more violently than the single <b>bubble</b> at any distance between the <b>bubbles.</b> The phase of the downstream <b>bubble</b> at the impact of the shock waves generated from the upstream <b>bubbles</b> is important in determining the acceleration of the collapse of the downstream <b>bubble.</b> It is also shown that the pressure increase in liquid near the axis of symmetry around the downstream <b>bubble</b> increases with the increase of number of <b>bubbles</b> and with the decrease of the bubble-bubble distance because the pressure increase in liquid is caused by the superposition of the shock waves generated from all <b>bubbles...</b>|$|R

We {{have focused on the}} former stage of <b>bubble</b> vesiculation and investigated numerically <b>bubble</b> formation in decompressed viscous liquid. <b>Bubble</b> formation consists of nucleation and growth of <b>bubbles</b> due to the exsolution of volatile elements from liquid. In order to describe the <b>bubble</b> formation processes, we have developed a theoretical model, taking into account the <b>bubble</b> size distribution and the viscosity of liquid, on the base of the model proposed by Toramaru (J.

In the case of the low and extreme high viscosity, the <b>bubble</b> size distribution evolves as an unimodal size distribution. In the case of the moderate viscosity, the size distribution of <b>bubbles</b> shows the distribution with a wider dispersion. These characteristic time-evolutions of the number density and size distribution of <b>bubbles</b> would be useful in evaluating material quantities such as the diffusivity, the viscosity, and the surface tension of liquid from experimental results.

40|$|A {{technique}} {{was developed to}} study the effect of surfactant (frother) on individual <b>bubble</b> motion in swarms. The {{technique was}} based on high speed cinematography and tracking of multiple moving objects. Image processing algorithms were implemented in Matlab to isolate and measure geometric properties of the <b>bubbles</b> in image sequences recorded at 1 ms interval; and these properties were compiled into a data structure. To track a <b>bubble,</b> the geometric properties and a matching criterion were applied on consecutive pictures to identify the <b>bubble.</b> The <b>bubble</b> trajectory was reconstructed from the data structure for the matched objects. To maximize the number of <b>bubbles</b> identified from an image, de-clustering algorithms were developed and validated. A new shape factor model for ellipsoidal objects and a correction model for pixelation effect were developed. To characterize the level of <b>bubble</b> interaction in a swarm, a technique for measuring average dimensionless <b>bubble</b> inter-distance was developed. To characterize the effect of frother type on <b>bubble</b> surface a new technique for measuring surface flows (Marangoni effect) on a <b>bubble</b> blown in air was developed. The results provided experimental evidence of the mechanisms by which surfactants dampen <b>bubble</b> oscillation and reduce <b>bubble</b> terminal rise velocity and helped to interpret the frother type effect. Experiments {{to determine the effect}} of surfactant (concentration and type), <b>bubble</b> interactions and <b>bubble</b> size distribution type on <b>bubble</b> velocity in swarms were conducted using the <b>bubble</b> tracking technique in a rectangular transparent column (12 x 5 x 140 cm) with an inclined top section (15 °). A flat <b>bubble</b> swarm was generated combining a slot (60 mm x 60 microm) and porous-slot (60 x 1. 1 mm) spargers. These combinations allowed the generation of <b>bubble</b> size distributions similar to those in industrial flotation machines. <b>Bubble</b> images were collected at three locations (near the point of generation, the top of the straight section and in the inclined section) to track the impact of surfactant accumulation. The results showed that the presence of surfactant reduced <b>bubble</b> coalescence and breakage and stabilized the <b>bubble</b> surface. As a consequence, the <b>bubble</b> size distribution remained stable as the swarm rose. Experimental measurements of <b>bubble</b> motion in the presence of surfactants showed for both single <b>bubbles</b> and swarms, that surfactant accumulation occurs as the <b>bubbles</b> detach from the generating point, and the impact occurs gradually, determined by the subsequent evolution of <b>bubble</b> aspect ratio. The <b>bubble</b> tracking measurements revealed a velocity-size profile, which was determined by: the predominant <b>bubble</b> size class, <b>bubble</b> interactions (dimensionless <b>bubble</b> inter-distance), and the surfactant type and concentration. The surfactant type seems to be a factor in determining <b>bubble</b> rise velocity for <b>bubbles</b> below 0. 8 mm, despite the theory that surface mobility for such small <b>bubbles</b> in unaffected by surfactants. It is thus proposed that surface viscosity plays a role on <b>bubble</b> motion. The new techniques for <b>bubble</b> motion and surface characterization were tested for <b>bubble</b> swarms in presence of Polyglycol and Pentanol. Two contributions to the knowledge emerging from this phase of the work are: (a) <b>bubble</b> motion in swarm describes a <b>bubble</b> velocity-size profile with a high dependency on the <b>bubble</b> distribution type, and (b) surfactant type influences <b>bubble</b> rise velocity for <b>bubbles</b> in range 0. 1 to 4 mm...|$|R
