6000|$|... 157. The best {{examples}} {{of the results of}} wise normal evidence in Art will be found in whatever evidence remains respecting the lives of great Italian painters, though, unhappily, in eras of progress, but just in proportion to the admirableness and efficiency of the life, will be usually the scantiness of its history. The individualities and liberties which are causes of destruction may be recorded; but the loyal conditions of daily breath are never told. Because Leonardo made models of machines, dug canals, built fortifications, and dissipated half his art-power in capricious ingenuities, we have many anecdotes of him;--but no picture of importance on canvas, and only a few withered stains of one upon a wall. But because his pupil, or reputed pupil, Luini, labored in constant and successful simplicity, we have no anecdotes of him;--only hundreds of noble works. Luini is, perhaps, the best central type of the highly-trained Italian painter. He is the only man who entirely united the religious temper which was the spirit-life of art, with the physical power which was its bodily life. He joins the purity and passion of Angelico to the strength of Veronese: the two elements, poised in perfect balance, are so calmed and restrained, each by the other, that most of us lose the sense of both. The artist does not see the strength, by reason of the chastened spirit in which it is used: and the religious visionary does not recognize the passion, by reason of the frank human truth with which it is rendered. He is a man ten times greater than Leonardo;--a mighty colorist, while Leonardo was only a fine draughtsman in <b>black,</b> <b>staining</b> the chiaroscuro drawing, like a colored print: he perceived and rendered the delicatest types of human beauty that have been painted {{since the days of the}} Greeks, while Leonardo depraved his finer instincts by caricature, and remained to the end of his days the slave of an archaic smile: and he is a designer as frank, instinctive, and exhaustless as Tintoret, while Leonardo's design is only an agony of science, admired chiefly because it is painful, and capable of analysis in its best accomplishment. Luini has left nothing behind him that is not lovely; but of his life I believe hardly anything is known beyond remnants of tradition which murmur about Lugano and Saronno, and which remain ungleaned. This only is certain, that he was born in the loveliest district of North Italy, where hills, and streams, and air meet in softest harmonies. Child of the Alps, and of their divinest lake, he is taught, without doubt or dismay, a lofty religious creed, and a sufficient law of life, and of its mechanical arts. Whether lessoned by Leonardo himself, or merely one of many disciplined in the system of the Milanese school, he learns unerringly to draw, unerringly and enduringly to paint. His tasks are set him without question day by day, by men who are justly satisfied with his work, and who accept it without any harmful praise, or senseless blame. Place, scale, and subject are determined for him on the cloister wall or the church dome; as he is required, and for sufficient daily bread, and little more, he paints what he has been taught to design wisely, and has passion to realize gloriously: every touch he lays is eternal, every thought he conceives is beautiful and pure: his hand moves always in radiance of blessing; from day to day his life enlarges in power and peace; it passes away cloudlessly, the starry twilight remaining arched far against the night.|$|E

OBJECTIVES: This {{study was conducted to}} assess the prevalence of <b>black</b> <b>stain</b> on teeth of Filipino children and to determine a possible association between <b>black</b> <b>stain</b> and caries levels. The study was designed to test the following hypotheses: (i) the prevalence of <b>black</b> <b>stain</b> does not differ between children from schools with oral health intervention programs and those from schools without an intervention program, (ii) the prevalence of <b>black</b> <b>stain</b> does not differ in children attending easily accessible and remote schools, (iii) caries prevalence and caries experience do not differ in children with and without <b>black</b> <b>stain</b> and (iv) the caries distribution at the surface level does not differ in children with and without <b>black</b> <b>stain.</b> Methods: In total, 32 elementary schools were included. 19 schools with a comprehensive school-based preventive oral health program, seven schools with a basic preventive program and six control schools. All sixth graders of these schools (n= 1748) aged 11. 7 +/- 1. 1 years were clinically examined for <b>black</b> <b>stain.</b> DMFT was assessed in 1121 children by seven calibrated dentists using WHO criteria. DMFS was scored in 627 children by two calibrated dentists. Results: <b>Black</b> <b>stain</b> was found in 16 % of this population. The prevalence of <b>black</b> <b>stain</b> did not differ significantly between children attending schools with different oral health intervention programs. Thus, hypothesis 1 was accepted. The prevalence of <b>black</b> <b>stain</b> was significantly higher (P< 0. 05) in remote than in more accessible schools. Thus, hypothesis 2 was rejected. Children with <b>black</b> <b>stain</b> had significantly lower (P< 0. 05) caries prevalence and caries experience than children without <b>black</b> <b>stain.</b> Thus, hypothesis 3 was rejected. No difference was found in the DMFS pattern of occlusal, smooth and proximal surfaces between children with and without <b>black</b> <b>stain.</b> Thus hypothesis 4 was accepted. Conclusions: The presence of <b>black</b> <b>stain</b> is associated with lower levels of caries, but a difference in the distribution of caries in <b>black</b> <b>stain</b> children was not noticed. The interplay between <b>black</b> <b>stain,</b> caries, oral microflora and diet remains unclear and urges further research...|$|R

40|$|<b>Black</b> <b>stain</b> is {{characterized}} as a dark line or an incomplete coalescence of dark dots localized on the cervical third of the tooth. Over the last century, the etiology of <b>black</b> <b>stain</b> {{has been the subject}} of much debate. Most of the studies concerning this issue were conducted in pediatric population. According to the reviewed articles published between 2001 and 2014, the prevalence of <b>black</b> <b>stain</b> varies from 2. 4 % to 18 % with equal sex distribution. The majority of the authors confirm the correlation between the presence of <b>black</b> <b>stain</b> and lower caries experience. The microflora of this deposit is dominated by Actinomyces spp. and has lower cariogenic potential than nondiscolored dental plaque. Iron/copper and sulfur complexes are thought to be responsible for the dark color. In patients with <b>black</b> <b>stain</b> saliva has higher calcium concentrations and higher buffering capacity. Factors such as dietary habits, socioeconomic status, and iron supplementation may be contributing to the formation of <b>black</b> <b>stain...</b>|$|R

This study assessed the prevalence of <b>black</b> <b>stains</b> at the age of 5 in a population-based birth cohort from Pelotas, Brazil and investigated the association between <b>black</b> <b>stains</b> and dental caries. A total of 1, 129 children from the 2004 Pelotas birth cohort were examined at age 5, and their mothers were interviewed at their households. Dental examinations included a search for <b>black</b> <b>stains</b> and dental caries on the primary dentition through the dmf-s index. The mothersâ€™ questionnaire comprised data on demographic, social, and behavior aspects. Prevalence of <b>black</b> <b>stains</b> was 3. 5 % (95 % CI 2. 5 â€“ 4. 7) and the prevalence of dental caries was 48. 4 % (95 % CI 45. 4 â€“ 51. 4). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the association between <b>black</b> <b>stains</b> and dental caries. Adjusted analysis revealed that the presence of <b>black</b> <b>stains</b> was associated with lower levels of dental caries (OR = 0. 51; 95 % CI 0. 26 â€“ 0. 99).

40|$|Lascaux Cave in France was {{discovered}} in 1940. Since being opened to visitors the cave has suffered three major microbial outbreaks. The current problem is the fast dissemination of <b>black</b> <b>stains</b> which are threatening the Palaeolithic paintings. Previous data pointed to the involvement of new fungal species {{in the formation of}} <b>black</b> <b>stains</b> on the rock walls and ceiling. However, it appears that there could be other reasons for the formation of different and extensive <b>black</b> <b>stains</b> coating the surface of the clayey sediments. Our analyses reveal that <b>black</b> <b>stains</b> on clayey sediments are mainly produced by Acremonium nepalense, a manganese oxide-depositing fungus, widely distributed in the cave.
