500|$|Future {{directions}} for AAC focus on improving device interfaces, reducing {{the cognitive and}} linguistic demands of AAC, and the barriers to effective social interaction. AAC researchers have challenged manufacturers to develop communication devices that are more appealing aesthetically, with greater options for leisure and play and that are easier to use. The rapid advances in smartphone and tablet computer technologies {{has the potential to}} radically change the availability of economical, accessible, flexible communication devices; [...] however, the user interfaces are needed that meet the various physical and cognitive challenges of AAC users. Android and other open source operating systems, provide opportunities for small communities, such as AAC, to develop the accessibility features and software required. Other promising areas of development include the access of communication devices using signals from movement recognition technologies that interpret <b>body</b> <b>motions,</b> or electrodes measuring brain activity, and the automatic transcription of dysarthric speech using speech recognition systems. Utterance-based systems, in which frequent utterances are organized in sets to improve the speed of communication exchange, are also in development. Similarly, research has focussed on the provision of timely access to vocabulary and conversation appropriate for specific interactions. Natural language generation techniques have been investigated, including the use of logs of past conversations with conversational partners, data from a user's schedule and from real-time Internet vocabulary searches, as well as information about location from global positioning systems and other sensors. However, despite the frequent focus on technological advances in AAC, practitioners are urged to retain the focus on the communication needs of the AAC users: [...] "The future for AAC will not be driven by advances in technology, but rather by how well we can take advantage of those advancements for the enhancement of communicative opportunities for individuals who have complex communication needs".|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{algorithm}} for automatic inference of human upper <b>body</b> <b>motion</b> {{in a natural}} scene. The initial motion cues are first detected from the captured video. A graph model is proposed for human upper <b>body</b> <b>motion,</b> and motion inference is posed as a mapping problem between state nodes in the graph model and the motion cues in images. Belief Propagation and dynamic programming algorithms are utilized for Bayesian inference of upper <b>body</b> <b>motion</b> in this graph model, which captures constraint of human body configuration under specific view angles. A multi-frame inference algorithm is proposed to combine temporal smoothness constraints in human upper <b>body</b> <b>motion.</b> The algorithm is applied in a prototype system that can automatically detect and track human upper <b>body</b> <b>motion</b> from captured videos, without manual initialization of human body parts. We present evaluation results of our algorithm on this system and some further considerations for refine the model in the future. 1...|$|R
30|$|In addition, motion {{artifacts}} strongly affect NIRS data {{when analyzing}} brain activity that accompanies <b>body</b> <b>motion.</b> As such, consideration of <b>body</b> <b>motion</b> is inevitable because natural <b>body</b> <b>motion</b> {{is required to}} combine the visual and haptic senses {{that are involved in}} BS. Importantly, ill-conditioned data arising from motion artifact contamination cannot satisfy the requirements of the GLM–SPM because well-conditioned data are implicitly required for comparison with the canonical waveform. For this reason, most previous studies of NIRS–SPM have utilized experimental paradigms that prohibit <b>body</b> <b>motion</b> (as in fMRI and MEG studies). As such, these methods cannot be directly used to analyze BS modification accompanying motion artifacts. Overall, the brain areas associated with BS modification induced by spontaneous <b>body</b> <b>motion</b> have not yet been comprehensively examined in humans, although these mechanisms have been identified in the monkey brain [7], and fragmentary human evidence has been reported [9, 11].|$|R

40|$|Visual {{perception}} of <b>body</b> <b>motion</b> {{is vital for}} everyday activities such as social interaction, motor learning or car driving. Tumors to the left lateral cerebellum impair visual {{perception of}} <b>body</b> <b>motion.</b> However, compensatory potential after cerebellar damage and underlying neural mechanisms remain unknown. In the present study, visual sensitivity to point-light <b>body</b> <b>motion</b> was psychophysically assessed in patient SL with dysplastic gangliocytoma (Lhermitte-Duclos disease) to the left cerebellum before and after neurosurgery, and {{in a group of}} healthy matched controls. Brain activity during processing of <b>body</b> <b>motion</b> was assessed by functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Alterations in underlying cerebro-cerebellar circuitry were studied by psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis. Visual sensitivity to <b>body</b> <b>motion</b> in patient SL before neurosurgery was substantially lower than in controls, with significant improvement after neurosurgery. Functional MRI in patient SL revealed a similar pattern of cerebellar activation during biological motion processing as in healthy participants, but located more medially, in the left cerebellar lobules III and IX. As in normalcy, PPI analysis showed cerebellar communication with a region in the superior temporal sulcus, but located more anteriorly. The findings demonstrate a potential for recovery of visual <b>body</b> <b>motion</b> processing after cerebellar damage, likely mediated by topographic shifts within the corresponding cerebro-cerebellar circuitry induced by cerebellar reorganization. The outcome is of importance for further understanding of cerebellar plasticity and neural circuits underpinning visual social cognition...|$|R
