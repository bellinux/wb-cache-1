40|$|Abstract—Twelve {{species of}} deep-sea fishes {{collected}} in 2005 {{from the western}} North Pacific, off-Tohoku, Japan were analyzed for persistent organochlorine compounds (OCs) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs). PCBs and DDTs were the predominant contaminants, followed by CHLs> HCB ≈ HCHs ≈ HBCDs> PBDEs. Concentrations of DDTs and CHLs were lower than those reported in 1994 – 95 from the same area. PCBs, however, did not show a decreasing trend, suggesting its recent input from the nearby land areas. BFRs were detected in all the specimens, evidencing that the contamination by these compounds reached even the deep-sea environment. Significant positive correlations between δ 15 N and concentrations of PCBs, DDTs and PBDEs were observed indicating that these compounds are <b>biomagnified</b> in higher trophic level fish. On the other hand, correlations between δ 15 N and concentrations of HCHs and HCB were not significant. As PCBs, DDTs and PBDEs have higher logKow values than those of HCHs and HCB, our findings confirm the fact that lipophilic compounds are bioaccumulated and <b>biomagnified</b> more easily...|$|R
40|$|Extensive {{damage to}} organisms and declines in {{wildlife}} populations {{have been observed}} together with long-term bioaccumulation and biomagnification of persistent xenobiotic chemicals. Heavy metals, especially organic or biomethylated mercury, lead, cadmium and organic tin compounds have caused environmental damage through bioaccumulation on a local scale. Effects on wildife caused by bioaccumulation of persistent organochlorine com-pounds are more widespread. However, the causal relationship between a <b>biomagnified</b> com-pound and the long-term effects have been established {{in only a few}} cases. Metabolic trans-formations, and occurrence of several toxic contaminants together in many cases, complicate evaluations of the sources of long-term effects. Environmental fate, exposure of biota and bio-magnification of a chemical can be predicted by modelling from its properties and from eco-logical, geological and climatic conditions of the recipient environment. Model predictions can be refined by experimental factors obtained from results of the field studies. Empirical estimates of hazardous bioaccumulation or biomagnification are obtained from field analy-ses of different trophic levels. Trend analyses of <b>biomagnified</b> contaminants and their effects can be utilized in prognosis of future development and in evaluation of the need for furthe...|$|R

40|$|International audienceFish {{are often}} exposed to various {{molecules}} like pesticides. Some of these compounds get <b>biomagnified</b> within aquatic food web, inducing health hazards of consumers. However, behaviors of many pesticides are still unknown. This work aims {{to study the}} uptake {{and the elimination of}} some of them in muscle tissue of edible fish (azoxystrobin, clomazone, diflufenican, dimethachlor, carbendazim, iprodion, isoproturon, mesosulfuron-methyl, metazachlor, napropamid, quizalofop, and thifensulfuron-methyl). Two freshwater fish species (Perca fluviatilis and Cyprinus carpio) were exposed to a mixture of these 13 pesticides, via multi-contaminated pellets, and then, eliminated. Compounds were measured in food, water and muscle tissue using multi-residues methods. Kinetics, biomagnification factors (BMFs) and half-lives (t 1 / 2) were estimated and they did not show a large difference between the species. Muscular BMFs ranged from 2 x 10 (- 6) (mesosulfuron-methyl in perch) to 1 x 10 (- 3) (isoproturon and napropamid in perch) and t 1 / 2 ranged from 0. 8 (mesosulfuronmethyl in perch) to 40. 3 d (napropamid in carp). BMFs were also modeled as a function of K-ow value. All BMF values were explained by the model, except for diflufenican which had a BMF lower than that expected by our modeling work, probably due to an efficient metabolism. Results led to the conclusion that none of these chemicals would probably be <b>biomagnified</b> within aquatic food webs...|$|R
