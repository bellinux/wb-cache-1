40|$|Abstract — Collection of {{wastewater}} {{is considered}} one of the major environmental problems in Egypt. More than 50 % of Egypt villages have no facilities of wastewater collection. Small <b>bore</b> sewer <b>system</b> is a good alternative for wastewater collection system especially in rural areas because the construction cost of small <b>bore</b> sewer <b>system</b> is cheaper than that of conventional sewer system. However, detailed analysis is required to determine the optimum conditions at which small <b>bore</b> sewer <b>system</b> will be a better choice. This paper aims to provide an estimation of total costs for both small <b>bore</b> sewer <b>systems</b> and conventional sewer systems using data of eight different villages in rural areas in Egypt. The villages were chosen in Menofyia and Assuit governorates. Two equations were obtained that can be used to obtain the total costs of both small <b>bore</b> sewer <b>systems</b> and conventional sewer systems for rural areas of similar characteristics to those studied. The optimum population values, at which the small <b>bore</b> sewer <b>system</b> will be the best alternative, were obtained. Index Terms — Collection systems; Conventional sewer system...|$|R

The paper set up the fine boring squeezed liquid film damped system of multi degree of freedom vibration simulation model and solve mathematical model by transfer matrix theory. The damping coefficient for the fine <b>boring</b> <b>system</b> can be obtained. The mechanical device of liquid film damping system is established. 20 # machine oil, 40 # machine oil, and cutting fluid are used to the system. The tests indicate that the effect of liquid film formed by cutting fluid is better than oil film formed by machine oil in the static test, but oil film formed by machine oil is better than liquid film formed by cutting fluid in the effect of dynamic test. The simulation model has high accuracy to reliability. The simulation model can directly obtain the optimal parameters, so as to provide effective way to guide field processing.|$|E
40|$|The Cigar Lake {{ore body}} is a {{high-grade}} uranium deposit situated within water-saturated sandstone. In order to extract the uranium ore remotely, ensuring minimal radiation dose to workers, and also to access the ore from stable ground, the Jet <b>Boring</b> <b>System</b> (JBS) was developed. This method of mining involves drilling a pilot hole up through a frozen ore body and utilizing a high-powered water jet to mine out cavities. During the mining process an ultrasonic sensor {{will be used to}} provide feedback to the operator, who is located beneath the ore body, as to the dimensions of the cavity. However, more precise data is required to determine final shape, volume, and location of the cavity for mine planning purposes. Selecting a device that will provide sufficient range data in the challenging environment will be vital to optimizing the mining process. Major issues include fog build up and flying debris during mining, and an environment that is wet, dark, and cold. A test cavity has been designed and constructed at the Saskatchewan Research Council (SRC) so that a study comparing three different technologies, as prospective candidates for the survey system, can be conducted. The devices being evaluated include a Senix ultrasonic sensor, an MDL Cavity Auto-Scanning Laser System (C-ALS), and a MESA Time of Flight (ToF) camera. The ultrasonic sensor is known t...|$|E

40|$|Some microbes, {{among them}} a few species of cyanobacteria, are able to {{excavate}} carbonate minerals, from limestone to biogenic carbonates, including coral reefs, in a bioerosive activity that directly links biological and geological parts of the global carbon cycle. The physiological mechanisms that enable such endolithic cyanobacteria to bore, however, remain unknown. In fact, their boring constitutes a geochemical paradox, in that photoautotrophic metabolism will tend to precipitate carbonates, not dissolve them. We developed a stable microbe/mineral <b>boring</b> <b>system</b> based on a cyanobacterial isolate, strain BC 008, with which to study the process of microbial excavation directly in the laboratory. Measurements of boring into calcite under different light regimes, and an analysis of photopigment content and photosynthetic rates along boring filaments, helped us reject mechanisms based on the spatial or temporal separation of alkali versus Acid-generating metabolism (i. e., photosynthesis and respiration). Instead, extracellular Ca 2 + imaging of boring cultures in vivo showed that BC 008 {{was able to take}} up Ca 2 + at the excavation front, decreasing the local extracellular ion activity product of calcium carbonate enough to promote spontaneous dissolution there. Intracellular Ca 2 + was then transported away along the multicellular cyanobacterial trichomes and excreted at the distal borehole opening into the external medium. Inhibition assays and gene expression analyses indicate that the uptake and transport was driven by P-type Ca 2 +-ATPases. We believe such a chemically simple and biologically sophisticated mechanism for boring to be unparalleled among bacteria...|$|E
40|$|February 2012 RAAP Archeologisch Adviesbureau {{undertook}} a preliminary archaeological {{study in the}} form of a field survey conducted for inventory purposes (exploratory phase) in relation to the soil interventions that would result from the proposed construction/reconstruction operations at the project location in the municipality of Rijswijk. During the field survey a total of 60 boreholes were drilled distributed over rows at roughly 25 m intervals. The general structure of the subsurface at the project location is as follows, from top to bottom: a stratum exhibiting (anthropogenic) fill and disturbance; the original surface level (topsoil); Gantel deposits; peat; lagoon deposits; dune sand; and sand. North(-west) of the line between boreholes 20 and 32, the Gantel channel has cut its way down deeply into the underlying beach deposits and lagoon deposits, and no peat and/or dune sand was found within the boreholes here. Layers with good archaeological prospects: Iron Age and Roman period - Gantel deposits The survey indicates that the project location harbours a possibly intact cultural landscape that was presumably conducive to habitation in the Roman period. Soil interventions extending to depths greater than about 1 m -NAP may reach the archaeological level and thus could constitute a threat. Neolithic - dune deposits The potential archaeological level of the dune landscape (Neolithic) has been encountered at about 4. 2 and 4. 4 m -NAP in a few isolated locations. No significantly developed dunes constituting an attractive location for habitation or use (agriculture) seem to have formed upon the naturally undulating lagoon or beach landscape. The probability of finding dunes in which remains of (largescale) settlement sites from the Neolithic period might be present should be adjusted downwards (to “low”) for the southern part of the project location (car park level), for the area with high-rise buildings and for the area north(-west) of the line between boreholes 20 and 32, within reach of the deeply incised Gantel channel. Dunes may well be present in the non-built-up parts of the project location, particularly underneath the tennis courts. The <b>boring</b> <b>system</b> used (rows of boreholes) does not provide enough certainty to conclusively rule out the presence of dunes here or to systematically map them. The “moderately high” probability of encountering (large-scale) settlement sites should be upheld here...|$|E

With the small reaction bar, it was difficult for an operator to absorb the strong reaction force, and as we discuss later, it was even dangerous. Other previous devices use frames to absorb the reaction force, which are fastened either to the tree stem/ground or onto a carriage [8, 10, 11]. Frames can absorb the reaction force more effectively than arms. However, mounting/unmounting the frames at each coring is time consuming.|$|R

An analysis of the ultimate resolution and voxel size dependent signal‐to‐noise ratio (SNR) in NMR microscopy is presented and experimentally verified. For microscopic scale objects (< 1 ‐mm diameter), the SNR based on the geometrical scale factor (s) is found to be proportional to s n where n< 2, rather than n= 3 as previously supposed. This comes about because of a drastic reduction in sample noise coupled with a significant sensitivity gain realized in small diameter radio-frequency coils. A new pulse sequence which reduces both diffusion dependent resolution degradation and signal attenuation is presented. The selection of optimal bandwidth and acquisition time for maximal SNR is discussed.

40|$|Need for {{increased}} productivity has motivated interest in drilling equipment for high speed and high precision drilling. However, long drills exhibit aggressive and self-excited vibrations known as whirling motions. These vibrations deteriorate the outcome drilled surface qualities, i. e., finish, geometrical dimensioning and tolerances. Deep hole boring {{is the most}} complex and expensive drilling operation in terms of expertise needed, operating conditions and size. The present research is to study the whirling vibrations of the <b>boring</b> bar workpiece <b>system</b> in the BTA deep hole boring process. After {{a review of the}} literature, a set of objectives is outlined for the thesis. The objectives are to formulate an analytical model, which will include the self-excited motion caused by the internal cutting forces in the Z and Y directions and the active suppression forces used to counteract the cutting forces. This model will be used to carry out simulation studies on the whirling vibrations of the <b>boring</b> bar-workpiece <b>system</b> and to carry out some experiments in order to validate the analytical model. In view of the large number of machining parameters that influence the system dynamics and the resulting surface finish, geometrical dimensioning and tolerancing on the workpiece, a fuzzy logic model is proposed for off line modeling. Such a model will be used to examine the results obtained in the experiments and to predict the best parametric combinations that will provide the required surface finish. This will constitute an open loop control of the vibrations. An active vibration suppression is carried out to reduce the whirling motion of the <b>boring</b> bar-workpiece <b>system,</b> which in turn will improve the surface finish. Two electrodynamic shakers are used in Z-Y plane to overcome the displacement of the boring bar while drilling. The experimental investigations are carried out in the deep hole boring laboratory.
