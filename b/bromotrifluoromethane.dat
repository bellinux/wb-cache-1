CASE PRESENTATION: We studied 117 exposed residents who came into one hospital for physical examinations. We also selected age- and sex-matched referents for comparison from residents {{who came to the}} same hospital for health examinations. Nine months after the exposure to mixed fire extinguishants, 91 of the exposed residents came back for a second physical examination. In the first examination of the exposed residents, we found a significant reduction in red blood cell count and hemoglobin and a relationship between dose and response. DISCUSSION: After excluding iron-deficiency anemia, thalassemia, and other possible agents, we suspected that the hematologic effects might have resulted from pyrolytic products of CFC- 12 and Halon 1211, which may contain phosgene, among other products. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The acute transient hematologic effects observed in the exposed residents were associated with the incident of leakage of mixed fire-extinguisher gases and were most likely caused by a small amount of pyrolytic products, probably phosgene.

In the tests, the studied agent was introduced into a propane flame in a diffusion flame burner. The combustion products were analysed using both conventional IR-techniques and FTIR. It could {{be concluded that}} for all four extinguishing agents that the extinguishing agent takes part in the combustion process resulting in production of CO and CO 2, which was also confirmed by the increase in smoke production with increasing amounts of agent introduced into the flame. Production of HF and COF 2 was found in experiments with all four extinguishing agents. In experiments with Halon 1301, the production of HBr was also determined.

In this study, the chemical effects of aircraft-released CF 3 I on atmospheric ozone were examined with the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign two-dimensional chemical-radiative-transport (UIUC 2 -D CRT) model. Using an earlier estimate of the aircraft emission profile for tank inerting in military aircraft, the resulting equivalent Ozone Depletion Potentials (ODPs) for CF 3 I were in the range of 0. 07 to 0. 25. As a sensitivity study, we also analyzed CF 3 I emissions associated with fuel inerting if it were to occur at lower altitudes using an alternative estimate. The model calculations of resulting effects on ozone for this case gave ODPs≤ 0. 05. Furthermore, through interactions with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), we analyzed the potential effects on ozone resulting from using CF 3 I in fire fighting connected with engine nacelle and auxiliary power unit applications. The scenarios evaluated using the NIST estimate suggested that the ODPs obtained by assuming aircraft flights occurring in several different latitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere are extremely low. According to the model calculation, the altitude where CF 3 I is released from aircraft is a dominant factor in its ozone depletion effects. On the assumption that the CF 3 I emission profile is representative of actual release characteristics, aircraft-released CF 3 I has much lower impacts on the ozone layer and can be a qualified substitute of CF 3 Br in engine nacelles...|$|E

It is found that hydrogen can accelerate the decomposition of halon 1301 and that conversion levels of CBrF 3 and H 2 increase with temperature and residence time. CBrF 3 conversion increases with decreasing input volume ratio of CBrF 3 to H 2. The species produced are a complex mixture of halogenated hydrocarbons including CHF 3, CH 2 F 2, C 2 HF 3, C 2 F 6, C 2 H 2 F 4, C 2 HF 5, CHBrF 2, CH 3 Br, CH 2 Br 2, CHBr 2 F, and CH 2 BrF in addition to HBr and HF. The production yield of CHF 3, the major product, increases with temperature to 1023 K, after which CHF 3 levels decrease with increasing temperature. Conversely, CHF 3 selectivity decreases with increasing temperature, residence time, or input ratio of CBrF 3 to H 2. The initiation reaction {{is believed to be}} the rupture of the C-Br bond in CBrF 3, and the radical species CF 3 then reacts with H 2 to produce H and CHF 3. The key step in the process is the attack of H radical on CBrF 3 to produce CF 3 and HBr. Experimental data are compared with the model predictions, and good agreement between experimental and modeling prediction is obtained for CHF 3 production. However, the existing mechanism does not predict the formation of CHBrF 2, which is detected during the experimental study, and the concentrations of CH 2 F 2 and C 2 F 6 measured experimentally are significantly different from those predicted.

40|$|The {{concept of}} Ozone Depletion Potentials (ODPs) is {{extensively}} used in policy considerations related to {{concerns about the}} effects of various halocarbons and other gases on stratospheric ozone. Many of the recent candidate replacement compounds have atmospheric lifetimes shorter than one year in order to limit their environmental effects, especially on stratospheric ozone. Using a three-dimensional global chemistry-transport model (CTM) of the troposphere and the stratosphere, {{the purpose of this study}} is to evaluate the potential effects of several very short-lived iodinated substances, namely iodotrifluoromethane (CF 3 I) and methyl iodide (CH 3 I), on atmospheric ozone. Like other chemicals with extremely short lifetimes, the stratospheric halogen loading and resulting ozone effects from these compounds are strongly dependent on the location of emissions. For CF 3 I, a possible replacement candidate for <b>bromotrifluoromethane</b> (CF 3 Br), ODPs derived by the three-dimensional model are 0. 008 with chemical lifetime of 5. 03 days and 0. 016 with a lifetime of 1. 13 days for emissions assumed to be evenly distributed over land surfaces at mid-latitudes and the tropics, respectively. While this is the first time the ODPs have been evaluated with a three-dimensional model, these values are in good agreement with those derived previously. The model calculations suggest that tropical convection could deliver a larger portion of the gas and their breakdown products to the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere if emission source is located in the tropics. The resulting ODP for CH 3 I, emitted from mid-latitudes, is 0. 017 with lifetime of 13. 59 days. The validity of our model iodine chemistry to evaluate ODPs of the iodine species is guaranteed with good qualitative agreement between the model derived distribution of background CH 3 I, based on global source emission fluxes from previous studies, and available observations especially in vertical profiles...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{ban on the}} {{production}} of <b>bromotrifluoromethane</b> (CF 3 Br) because of its high stratospheric ozone depletion potential has led to interest in finding alternative agents for fire extinguishing applications. Some of the promising alternatives are fluorinated hydrocarbons. A {{clear understanding of the}} effects of CF 3 Br and alternative chemical suppressants on diffusion flames is therefore necessary in the selection of alternative suppressants for use in normal and microgravity. The flame inhibition effects of halogen compounds have been studied extensively in premixed systems. The effect of addition of halocarbons (carbon-halogen compounds) to diffusion flames has been studied experimentally in coflow configurations and in counterflow gaseous and liquid-pool flames. Halogenated compounds are believed to inhibit combustion by scavenging hydrogen radicals to form the relatively unreactive compound HF, or through a catalytic recombination cycle involving HBr to form H 2. Comparisons between halogens show that bromine inhibition is significantly more effective than chlorine or fluorine. Although fluorinated compounds are only slightly more effective inhibitors on a mass basis than nitrogen, they are more effective on a volume basis and are easily stored in liquid form. The objectives of this study are (a) to determine the stability limits of laminar jet diffusion flames with respect to inhibitor concentration in both normal and microgravity, and (b) to investigate the structure of halocarbon-inhibited flames. In the initial phase of this project, visual diagnostics were used to observe the structure and behavior of normal and microgravity flames. The initial observations showed significant changes {{in the structure of the}} flames with the addition of halocarbons to the surrounding environment, as discussed below. Furthermore, the study established that the flames are more stable relative to the addition of halocarbons in microgravity than in normal gravity. Visual diagnostics of flames are, however, necessarily limited to detection of radiative emission in the visible range, and offer only qualitative information about the nature of the processes in the flame. In particular, the study sought to understand the structure of the inhibitor-perturbed flames with regard to temperature and species concentration in the outer region of the flame. Whereas thermocouple measurements can be used in ground based studies, their implementation in drop-tower rigs is limited. A possible approach to determine the temperature field around the flame is to use interferometric techniques. The implementation and testing of a shear-plate interferometry technique is described below...|$|E

A consistent set of reference parameters for the van der Waals and Platteeuw model, [...] . and [...] ., were developed for Structure II hydrates and are not dependent on any fitted parameters. Our previous methane-water ab initio energy surface has been recast onto a site-site potential model that predicts guest occupancy experiments with improved accuracy compared to previous studies. This methane-water potential is verified via ab initio many-body calculations and thus should be generally applicable to dense methane-water systems. New reference parameters, [...] . and [...] ., for Structure I hydrates using the van der Waals and Platteeuw model were also determined. Equilibrium predictions with an average absolute deviation of 3. 4 % for the mixed hydrate of argon and methane were made. These accurate predictions of the mixed hydrate system provide an independent test of the accuracy of the intermolecular potentials. (cont.) Finally, for the mixed argon-methane hydrate, conditions for structural changes from the Structure I hydrate of methane to the Structure II hydrate of argon were predicted and await experimental confirmation. We present the application of a mathematical method reported earlier' by which the van der Waals-Platteeuw statistical mechanical model with the Lennard-Jones and Devonshire approximation can be posed as an integral equation with the unknown function being the intermolecular potential between the guest molecules and the host molecules. This method allows us to solve for the potential directly for hydrates for which the Langmuir constants are computed, either from experimental data or from ab initio data. Given the assumptions made in the van der Waals-Platteeuw model with the spherical-cell approximation, there are an infinite number of solutions; however, the only solution without cusps is a unique central-well solution in which the potential is at a finite minimum at the center to the cage. (cont.) From this central-well solution, we have found the potential well depths and volumes of negative energy for sixteen single-component hydrate systems: ethane (C₂H₆), cyclopropane (C₃H₆), methane (CH₄), argon (Ar), and chlorodifluoromethane (R- 22) in structure I; and ethane (C₂H₆), cyclopropane (C₃H₆), propane (C₃H₈), isobutane (C₄H₁₀), methane (CH₄), argon (Ar), trichlorofluoromethane (R- 1 1), dichlorodifluoromethane (R- 12), <b>bromotrifluoromethane</b> (R- 1 3 B 1), chloroform (CHC 1 ₃), and 1, 1, 1, 2 -Tetrafluoroethane (R- 134 a) in structure II. This method and the calculated cell potentials were validated by predicting existing mixed hydrate phase equilibrium data without any fitting parameters and calculating mixture phase diagrams for methane, ethane, isobutane, and cyclopropane mixtures. Several structural transitions that have been determined experimentally as well as some structural transitions that have not been examined experimentally were also predicted. In the methane-cyclopropane hydrate system, a structural transition from structure I to structure II and back to structure I is predicted to occur outside of the known structure II range for the cyclopropane hydrate. (cont.) Quintuple (Lw-SI-SII-Lho-V) points have been predicted for the ethane-propane-water (277. 3 K, 12. 28 bar, and Xeth,waterfree = 0. 676) and ethane-isobutane-water (274. 7 K, 7. 18 bar, and Xeth,waterfree = 0. 81) systems. A two-fold mechanism for hydrate inhibition has been proposed and tested using molecular dynamic simulations for PEO, PVP, PVCap, and VIMA. This mechanism hypothesizes that (1) as potential guest molecules become coordinated by water, form nuclei, and begin to grow, nearby inhibitor molecules disrupt the organization of the forming clathrate and (2) inhibitor molecules bind {{to the surface of the}} hydrate crystal precursor and retards further growth along the bound growth plane resulting in a modified planar morphology. This mechanism is supported by the results of our molecular dynamic simulations for the four inhibitor molecules studied. PVCap and VIMA, the more effective inhibitors, shows strong interactions with the liquid water phase under hydrate forming conditions, while PVP and PEO appear relatively neutral to the surrounding water. by Brian Anderson.
