40|$|The {{technical}} report {{is based on}} an earlier research on material properties of the M 5 structural material. Complementing this research with new M 5 data found in open literature, a set of correlations has been developed for the implementation to the TRANSURANUS code. This includes thermal, mechanical, and chemical (corrosion) properties of M 5. As an example, thermal capacity or <b>burst</b> <b>stress</b> correlations have been proposed using the available experimental data. The open literature provides a wide range of experimental data on M 5, but for some quantities they are not complete enough to be suitable for the implementation to the TRANSURANUS code. A balanced consideration of similarity of M 5 characteristics to those of Zircaloy- 4 (Zry- 4) or E 110 have therefore led to the recommendation to use some of these data selectively also for M 5. As such, creep anisotropy coefficients of E 110 are recommended to be used also for M 5. JRC. G. I. 4 -Nuclear Reactor Safety and Emergency Preparednes...|$|E
40|$|Damage {{caused by}} {{reactive}} oxygen species (ROS) contributes to many aging processes and accompanying diseases. ROS are toxic side products of cellular respiration, but also function as signal, e. g. in the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. The protein p 66 Shc, which has been implicated in life-span regulation and aging-related diseases, is a central player in stress-induced apoptosis and the associated ROS <b>burst.</b> <b>Stress</b> signals, such as UV radiation or ROS themselves, activate p 66 Shc, which was proposed to stimulate its H 2 O 2 forming activity, ultimately triggering mitochondrial disintegration. However, mechanistic details of H 2 O 2 formation and apoptosis induction by p 66 Shc and regulation of these activities remain to be revealed. Here, we describe the effects of Ser 36 phosphorylation and Pin 1 binding on p 66 Shc activity, and the identification of Peroxiredoxin 1 (Prx 1) as a novel interaction partner for the unique p 66 Shc N-terminal domain. Prx 1 was identified in affinity experiments as dominant interaction partner. Complex formation leads to disassembly of Prx 1 decamers, which is known to increase its peroxidase activity. The interaction leads to reduction of the p 66 CH 2 CB tetramer, which reduces its ability to induce mitochondrial rupture. Our results indicate that p 66 CH 2 CB and Prx 1 form a stress-sensing complex that keeps p 66 Shc inactive at moderate stress levels...|$|E
40|$|Papayas have a {{very short}} green life {{as a result of}} their rapid pulp {{softening}} as well as their susceptibility to physical injury and mold growth. The ripening-related changes take place very quickly, and there is a continued interest in the reduction of postharvest losses. Proteins have a central role in biological processes, and differential proteomics enables the discrimination of proteins affected during papaya ripening. A comparative analysis of the proteomes of climacteric and pre-climacteric papayas was performed using 2 DE-DIGE. Third seven proteins corresponding to spots with significant differences in abundance during ripening were submitted to MS analysis, and 27 proteins were identified and classified into six main categories related to the metabolic changes occurring during ripening. Proteins from the cell wall (alpha-galactosidase and invertase), ethylene biosynthesis (methionine synthase), climacteric respiratory <b>burst,</b> <b>stress</b> response, synthesis of carotenoid precursors (hydroxymethylbutenyl 4 -diphosphate synthase, GcpE), and chromoplast differentiation (fibrillin) were identified. There was some correspondence between the identified proteins and the data from previous transcript profiling of papaya fruit, but new, accumulated proteins were identified, which reinforces the importance of differential proteomics as a tool to investigate ripening and provides potentially useful information for maintaining fruit quality and minimizing postharvest losses.

40|$|Fuel {{performance}} {{models have}} been developed to assess the performance of ThO[subscript 2]-UO[subscript 2] fuels that can be operated to a high burnup up to 80 - 100 MWd/kgHM in current and future Light Water Reactors (LWRs). Among the various issues raised in high burnup fuel applications, the pellet rim effect, fission gas release (FGR), and response to reactivity initiated accidents (RIA) were of special interest in this work. These phenomena were modeled by modifying the NRC licensing codes FRAPCON- 3 for normal operation and FRAP-T 6 for transient conditions. These models were verified and compared to the results of previous thorium fuel studies and high burnup uranium fuel evaluations. The buildup of plutonium in the outer rim of LWR UO[subscript 2] pellets has been observed to create a region of high fuel burnup, fission gas buildup and high porosity at the fuel rim. The power distribution of the thoria and urania fuel was calculated using a neutronics code MOCUP. Due to the lower build-up of Pu- 239 (less U- 238 in ThO[subscript 2]-UO[subscript 2] fuel) and flatter distribution of U- 233 (less resonance capture in Th- 232), thoria fuel experiences a much flatter power distribution and thus has a less severe rim effect than UO[subscript 2] fuel. To model this effect properly, a new model, THUPS (Thoria-Urania Power Shape), was developed, benchmarked with MOCUP and adapted into FRAPCON- 3. Additionally a porosity model for the rim region was introduced at high burnup to account for the larger fuel swelling and degradation of the thermal conductivity. The mechanisms of fission gas release in ThO[subscript 2]-UO[subscript 2] fuel have been found similar to those of UO[subscript 2] fuel. Therefore, the general formulations of the existing fission gas release models in FRAPCON- 3 were retained. However, the gas diffusion coefficient in thoria was adjusted to a lower level to account for the smaller observed gas release fraction in the thoria-based fuel. To model accelerated fission gas release at high burnup properly, a new athermal fission gas release model was developed. Other modifications include the thoria fuel properties, fission gas production rate, and the corrosion model to treat advanced cladding materials. The modified version of FRAPCON- 3 was calibrated using the measured fission gas release data from the Light Water Breeder Reactor (LWBR) program. Using the new model to calculate the gas release in typical PWR hot pins gives data that indicate that the ThO[subscript 2]-UO[subscript 2] fuel will have considerably lower fission gas release beyond a burnup of 50 MWd/kgHM. Investigation of the fuel response to an RIA included: (1) reviewing industry simulation tests to understand the mechanisms involved, (2) modifying FRAP-T 6 code to simulate the RIA tests and investigate the key contributors to fuel failure (thermal expansion, gaseous swelling, cladding <b>burst</b> <b>stress),</b> and (3) assessing thoria and urania performance during RIA event in typical LWR situations. ThO[subscript 2]-UO[subscript 2] fuel has been found to have better performance than UO[subscript 2] fuel under RIA event conditions due to its lower thermal expansion and a flatter power distribution in the fuel pellet (less power and less fission gas in the rim region). Overall, thoria has been found to have better performance than urania in both normal and off-normal conditions. However, calculations using the modified FRAPCON- 3 showed that the internal pressure and cladding corrosion at the required high burnup of 80 - 100 MWd/kgHM are not acceptable with the current fuel design. Therefore, advanced fuel designs (including larger gas plenum, larger fuel grains, advanced cladding materials), and carefully designed operating strategy (i. e. decreasing power history) were assessed and the results showed that the targeted high burnup can be achieved. Further investigation of burnup issues is needed, such as the distribution of hydrogen in the cladding for heterogeneous fuels, and response of high pressure fuel pins to a loss of coolant accident, in order to assure satisfactory high burnup behavior.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{puncture}} {{and burst}} properties of short-fiber reinforced polychloroprene rubber {{under various conditions}} were investigated to yield the best mechanical properties. In addition to five types of interphase conditions, four types of fiber aspect ratios (AR: length of fiber/diameter of fiber) and three different fiber contents were studied for their roles in the puncture and burst properties of rubber products. Certain interphase conditions and higher fiber ARs were shown to provide higher puncture and <b>burst</b> <b>stresses</b> at a given fiber content. Since both testing methods measure biaxial properties of reinforced rubber, {{the relation between the}} two properties is studied. The discrepancy between regressed puncture and burst force is explained based upon the rubber stiffness due to reinforcing parameters and the stress concentration upon sharp edge. Overall, {{it was found that the}} interphase condition, fiber AR, and fiber content have an important effect upon puncture and burst properties...|$|R

In addition, due to the demand of compatibility, the combined effect of TBM high-concentrated loads determines tensile spalling stresses in the area far from the loads. Therefore, local rebars or fiber reinforcement are required in the aforementioned areas. In this context, the present paper focuses {{on the study of}} the effects generated by high-concentrated loads exerted by TBM hydraulic jacks, mainly in terms of both spalling and splitting phenomena.

Optical tweezers combined with microfluidics {{have been used}} to study the fate of individual Escherichia coli cells lacking such channels when subjected to a <b>bursting</b> <b>stress</b> caused by increased turgor. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting and electron microscopy complement these studies. These analyses show that lysis occurs with a high probability, but the precise path differs between individual cells. By monitoring the loss of cytoplasmic green fluorescent protein, we have determined that some cells release this protein but remain phase dark (granular) consistent with the retention of the majority of large proteins. By contrast, most cells suffer cataclysmic wall failure leading to loss of granularity but with the retention of DNA and overall cell shape (protein-depleted ghosts). The time span of these events induced by hypo-osmotic shock varies but is of the order of milliseconds. The data are interpreted in terms of the timing of mechanosensitive channel gating relative to osmotically induced water influx...|$|R

These loads generate in the precast segments a disturbed region under the thrust jacks, in which significant tensile stresses (defined as splitting or <b>bursting</b> <b>stresses)</b> occur perpendicular to the load direction. In addition, due to the compatibility requirement, the combined effect of TBM high concentrated loads may determine high tensile stresses in the area between loads, which lead to cracks defined as spalling cracks. Therefore, rebars or fibre reinforcement are required in these areas. Traditionally, steel fibres were used as fibre reinforcement, although now some types of structural macro-synthetic fibres are used that impart significant toughness and ductility to concrete. In the present study, eight plane specimens were tested under two loads applied on a small area to evaluate {{the effect of this}} loading configuration and the contribution of polypropylene (PP) fibre reinforcement in controlling both spalling and splitting phenomena.

40|$|To {{generate}} enough thrust for a Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) to excavate a soil and advance, several jacks are typically used to apply {{force to the}} last installed ring {{that acts as a}} reaction frame.

Many studies dedicated to evaluate this phenomenon focus mainly on elements with similar height-to-length ratios. To cover the wide variety of dimensions and load application patterns, additional experimental assessments are required. The objectives of the present paper are to extend the study of with different height-to-length ratios subjected to concentrated loads and to validate analytical formulations for the verification of concrete segments in SLS and ULS. To accomplish this, an experimental program was carried out using small-scale specimens with and without fibre reinforcement. The results obtained were used to validate the formulations derived from a struts-and-ties model.

40|$|The {{transverse}} {{coefficient of}} thermal expansion of FRP (fibre reinforced plastics) reinforcing or prestressing elements can be 5 to 8 {{times higher than}} the corresponding value for concrete. This may create significant <b>bursting</b> <b>stresses</b> within the concrete under uniform temperature increase. It is the authors' experience that this aspect is not duly considered by most designers. Therefore, a research programme was set up to prove the importance of the transverse thermal expansion of FRP elements and its influence on the critical concrete cover of concrete elements reinforced or prestressed with FRP. To study the influence of the transverse thermal expansion of FRP reinforcement, a finite element analysis has been performed, using DIANA. Two different shapes were investigated numerically : FRP bars and strips. A two-dimensional non-linear analysis with smeared cracking was elaborated. From the FEM analysis {{it is clear that the}} transverse thermal expansion has a considerable influence on the critical concrete cover. The critical concrete cover (Hoyer effect and temperature rise of 60 degrees C) for Arapree equals 3. 5 to 5 times the bar diameter depending on the concrete strength and the shape of the prestressing element. For higher concrete strengths a smaller concrete cover can be allowed. The behaviour of the strip under transverse thermal expansion is more critical compared to the AFRP bar. Also the crack pattern looks less favourable (the rectangular shape initiates a cracking direction). By means of FEM modelling also a simulation was made of the crack formation in noise barrier posts pretensioned with AFRP, as used in the Netherlands. A good indication has been found why these barrier posts show some longitudinal cracking...|$|R

The overlying column of rock creates severe stresses in rocks.

Using an analytic model, we also show that this frequency modulation of bursts ensures proportional expression of multiple target genes across a wide dynamic range of expression levels, independent of promoter characteristics. We experimentally confirm this theory with natural and synthetic Crz 1 target promoters. Another stress-response transcription factor, Msn 2, exhibits similar, but largely uncorrelated, localization <b>bursts</b> under calcium <b>stress</b> suggesting that frequency-modulation regulation of localization bursts may be a general control strategy used by the cell to coordinate multi-gene responses to external signals...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of preventing rockburst through deep-hole precracking blasting was studied based on experimental test, numerical simulation, and field testing. The study {{results indicate that}} the deep-hole precracking could change the <b>bursting</b> proneness and <b>stress</b> state of coal-rock mass, thereby preventing the occurrence of rockburst. The bursting proneness of the whole composite structure could be weakened by the deep-hole precracking blasting. The change of stress state in the process of precracking blasting is achieved in two ways: (1) artificially break the roof apart, thus weakening the continuity of the roof strata, effectively inducing the roof caving while reducing its impact strength; and (2) the dynamic shattering and air pressure generated by the blasting can structurally change the properties of the coal-rock mass by mitigating the high stress generation and high elastic energy accumulation, thus breaking the conditions of energy transfer and rock burst occurrence...|$|R
40|$|Hypoosmotic stress {{activates}} a phosphorylation-dependent oxidative burst. In-gel kinase assays {{were performed}} to characterize the protein kinases that could be implicated in osmoregulation and in the activation of the oxidative <b>burst.</b> Hypoosmotic <b>stress</b> activated several kinases among which 50 and 46 kDa proteins displayed mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) properties. They phosphorylated myelin basic protein {{in the absence of}} calcium, were recognized by antibodies directed against human MAP kinases, and were phosphorylated on tyrosine. Immunoprecipitation with an antibody directed against the tobacco MAP kinase Ntf 4 showed {{that at least one of}} the activated kinases would be Ntf 4 -like. Apigenin, a MAP kinase and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor which prevents the hypoosmotically induced oxidative burst (Cazale et al. 1998; Plant Physiol. 116, 659 - 669), inhibited these kinases in vitro suggesting that they may play a role in the activation of the oxidative burst. Like the oxidative response, activation of the kinases depended on extracellular calcium influx and protein kinases sensitive to staurosporine and 6 -DMAP. However, kinase activation did not depend on effluxes through anion channels or on the oxidative burst. Two-dimensional in-gel kinase assays revealed the presence of three protein kinases with an apparent molecular mass of 50 kDa and one of 46 kDa, all four being activated by hypoosmotic stress. The same kinases were also activated by oligogalacturonides and salicylic acid, underlying the importance of these MAP kinases as common components of different signaling pathways triggered by different extracellular stimuli...|$|R

40|$|Friction stir welding (FSW) is a welding {{technology}} used to join materials considered {{difficult to be}} welded. Mechanical properties of FSW joints are generally evaluated by means of tensile tests that might provide insufficient information because maximum strain obtained before necking is small and that cannot be used when the joint path is not linear or when the welds are executed on curved surfaces. The present work investigates the mechanical properties of FSW tubes by means of tube bulge tests. An experimental campaign was performed on tubular specimens (thickness equal to 3 mm, external diameter equal to 40 mm). In particular, bent plates in AA 6060 alloy were longitudinally friction stir welded {{by means of a}} CNC machine tools varying the welding parameters. The <b>burst</b> pressure, the <b>stress</b> state and the wall thickness were measured for each tested tube. Finally, macro and micro analyses were carried out on the joints.

40|$|Earlier {{compression}} {{experiments on}} micrometre-sized aluminium pillars, fabricated by focused-ion beam milling, using a flat-punch nanoindenter revealed that post-yield deformation during constant-rate loading was jerky with interspersing strain bursts and linear elastic segments. Under load hold, the pillars crept mainly {{by means of}} sporadic strain bursts. In this work, a Monte Carlo simulation model is developed, with two statistics gathered from the load-ramp experiments as input, {{to account for the}} jerky deformation during the load ramp as well as load hold. Under load-ramp conditions, the simulations successfully captured other experimental observations made independently from the two inputs, namely, the diverging behaviour of the jerky stress-strain response at higher stresses, the increase in burst frequency and <b>burst</b> size with <b>stress</b> and the overall power-law distribution of the burst size. The model also predicts creep behaviour agreeable with the experimental observations, namely, the occurrence of sporadic bursts with frequency depending on stress, creep time and pillar dimensions. © 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Mechanical {{deformation}} of nanopillars displays {{features that are}} distinctly different from the bulk behavior of single crystals: Yield strength increases with decreasing size and plas- tic deformation comes together with strain <b>bursts</b> or/and <b>stress</b> drops (depending on load- ing conditions) with a very strong sensitivity of the stochasticity character on material preparation and conditions. The character of the phenomenon is standing as a paradox: While these bursts resemble the universal, widely independent of material conditions, noise heard in bulk crystals using acoustic emission techniques, they emerge primarily with decreasing size and increasing strength in nanopillars. In this paper, we present a re- alistic but minimal discrete dislocation plasticity model for the elasto-plastic {{deformation of}} nanopillars {{that is consistent with}} the main experimental observations of nano pillar compression experiments and provides a clear insight to this paradox. With increasing sample size, the model naturally transitions between the typical progressive behavior of nanopillars to a behavior that resembles evidence for bulk mesoscale plasticity. The com- bination of consistent strengthening, large flow stress fluctuations and critical avalanches is only observed in the depinning regime where obstacles are much stronger than disloca- tion sources; in contrast, when dislocation source strength becomes comparable to obsta- cle barriers, then yield strength size effects are absent but plasticity avalanche dynamics is strongly universal, across sample width and aspect-ratio scales. Finally, we elucidate the mechanism that leads to the connection between depinning and size effects in our model dislocation dynamics. In this way, our model builds a way towards unifying statistical as- pects of mechanical deformation across scales...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method {{to identify the}} danger of rock burst from the response of drill pipe torque during drilling process to overcome many defects of the conventional volume of drilled coal rubble method. It {{is based on the}} relationship of rock <b>burst</b> with coal <b>stress</b> and coal strength. Through theoretic analysis, the change mechanism of drill pipe torque and the relationship of drill pipe torque with coal stress, coal strength, and drilling speed are investigated. In light of the analysis, a new device for testing drill pipe torque is developed and a series of experiments is performed under different conditions; the results show that drill pipe torque linearly increases with the increase of coal stress and coal strength; the faster the drilling speed, the larger the drill pipe torque, and vice versa. When monitoring rock burst by drill pipe torque method, the index of rock burst is regarded as a function in which coal stress index and coal strength index are principal variables. The results are important for the forecast of rock burst in coal mine...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the welding of various glasses with ultrashort laser pulses. Femtosecond laser pulses at {{repetition}} rates in the MHz range are focused at the interface between two substrates, resulting in multiphoton absorption and heat accumulation from successive pulses. This leads to local melting and subsequent resolidification {{which can be used}} to weld the glasses. The fundamental interaction process was studied using an in-situ micro Raman setup to measure the laser induced temperature distribution and its temporal decay. The induced network changes were analyzed by Raman spectrocopy identifying an increase of three and four membered silicon rings within the laser irradiated area. In order to determine the stability of the laser welded samples a three point bending test was used. Thereby, we identified that the maximal achievable breaking strength is limited by laser induced stress surrounding the modified material. To minimize the amount of <b>stress</b> <b>bursts</b> of laser pulses or an post processing annealing step can be applied. Besides fused silica, we welded borosilicate glasses and glasses with a low thermal expansion coefficient. Even the welding of different glass combinations is possible demonstrating the versatility of ultrashort pulse induced laser welding...|$|R
40|$|The aim was {{to measure}} changes in the oxygen tension within the human {{placenta}} associated with onset of the maternal arterial circulation {{at the end of}} the first trimester of pregnancy, and the impact on placental tissues. Using a multiparameter probe we established that the oxygen tension rises steeply from 50 mmHg at 12 weeks. This rise coincides with morphological changes in the uterine arteries that allow free flow of maternal blood into the placenta, and is associated with increases in the mRNA concentrations and activities of the antioxidant enzymes catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and manganese and copper/zinc superoxide dismutase within placental tissues. Between 8 to 9 weeks there is a sharp peak of expression of the inducible form of heat shock protein 70, formation of nitrotyrosine residues, and derangement of the mitochondrial cristae within the syncytiotrophoblast. We conclude that a <b>burst</b> of oxidative <b>stress</b> occurs in the normal placenta as the maternal circulation is established. We speculate that this may serve a physiological role in stimulating normal placental differentiation, but may also be a factor in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia and early pregnancy failure if antioxidant defenses are depleted...|$|R
40|$|Oxidative stress kills neurons by {{stimulating}} FOXO 3, a {{transcription factor}} whose activity is inhibited by insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), a wide-spectrum neurotrophic signal. Because recent evidence {{has shown that}} oxidative stress blocks neuroprotection by IGF-I, we examined whether attenuation of IGF-I signaling is linked to neuronal death by oxidative stress, as both events may contribute to neurodegeneration. We observed that in neurons, activation of FOXO 3 by a <b>burst</b> of oxidative <b>stress</b> elicited by 50 �M hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) recruited a two-pronged pathway. A first, rapid arm attenuated AKT inhibition of FOXO 3 through p 38 MAPK-mediated blockade of IGF-I stimulation of AKT. A second delayed arm involved activation of FOXO 3 by Jun-kinase 2 (JNK 2). Notably, blockade of IGF-I signaling through p 38 MAPK was necessary for JNK 2 to activate FOXO 3, unveiling a competitive regulatory interplay between the two arms onto FOXO 3 activity. Therefore, an abrupt rise in oxidative stress activates p 38 MAPK to tilt the balance in a competitive AKT/JNK 2 regulation of FOXO 3 toward its activation, eventually leading to neuronal death. In view of previous observations linking attenuation of IGF-I signaling to other causes of neuronal death, {{these findings suggest that}} blockade of trophic input is a common step in neuronal death...|$|R
40|$|While the {{transport}} of sediment by unidirectional currents or by oscillatory (wave-induced) currents has been investigated, very {{little attention has been}} paid to the problem of the threshold of transport under the two mechanisms combined. Studies were carried out using cohesionless sand-sized (mean diameters: 142, 363, 771 and 1134 ?m) quartz grains in a unidirectional flume, within which an oscillatory carriage had been installed. The experiments were carried out under unidirectional velocities ranging between 0 and 27 cm s- 1, combined with simulated wave-induced currents (at periods of 5 and 15 s) ranging from 0 to 35 cm s- 1. The threshold of transport was assessed, by visual observation, using the Yalin Criterion for unidirectional flow. This criterion permitted critical conditions to be estimated subjectively by observation of incipient transport from the flat beds. The results indicated the dependence of the critical threshold velocity combination on grain size and wave period. Thresholds tend to increase with increasing grain size or decreasing period. The grain-size dependence is predictable from existing empirical relationships for the separate mechanisms; statistical fluctuations in near-bed <b>stress</b> (<b>bursting)</b> however, are invoked to explain the wave period dependence. The latter effect acts in a reverse manner for wave and current combinations than for waves alone. Graphs are presented, relating grain size to critical threshold velocity combinations, to aid in the sedimentological interpretation of field data...|$|R
40|$|Repeated high fat {{and high}} {{carbohydrate}} meals (HFHCM) generate atherosclerosis, isolated systolic hypertension (ISH), autonomic and endothelial dysfunction. Consequently, old people are particularly susceptible to both flowmediated dilation (FMD) impairment and postprandial hypotension. Despite the mounting evidence that free radicals substantially alter {{blood pressure and}} endothelial function, the mechanisms that outline these phenomena are unclear. We have reviewed {{the effects of the}} free radicals generated by post-prandial oxidative burst on vascular contractility. Postprandial endotoxemia seems to {{play a crucial role in}} both oxidative burst and inflammatory response after meal. Oxidative burst produces both reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). The reviewed results do not support the hypothesis that a sparing NO• effect is the primary cause of the early alteration of vascular contractility induced by oxidative burst. The contrasting results of various ROS seem to be due to the differentiated effect or toxicity to endothelium or vascular smooth muscle, while lypopolisaccaride, peroxinitrite and peroxyl radicals induce hypotension. On the other hand, immune activation improves sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity and the compensatory adrenergic response to postprandial hypotension has anti-inflammatory activity. Besides, insulin inhibits post-prandial oxidative <b>burst,</b> post-prandial oxidative <b>stress</b> and inflammation activate the xanthine oxidase and induce the antioxidant enzymes. In conclusion, repeated HFHCM meal ingestion could induce hyper-insulinaemia, chronic SNS and antioxidant enzymes activation. These defensive mechanisms, to both post-prandial hypotension and inflammation, generate autonomic dysfunction and FMD impairment, whereas the chronic oxidative stress induces structural changes in the arteries leading to ISH...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Plant Receptor-like/Pelle kinases (RLK) are a {{group of}} conserved {{signalling}} components that regulate developmental programs and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. One of the largest RLK groups is formed by the Domain of Unknown Function 26 (DUF 26) RLKs, also called Cysteine-rich Receptor-like Kinases (CRKs), which have been suggested to play important roles in the regulation of pathogen defence and programmed cell death. Despite the vast number of RLKs present in plants, however, {{only a few of}} them have been functionally characterized. Results We examined the transcriptional regulation of all Arabidopsis CRKs by ozone (O 3), high light and pathogen/elicitor treatment - conditions known to induce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in various subcellular compartments. Several CRKs were transcriptionally induced by exposure to O 3 but not by light stress. O 3 induces an extracellular oxidative <b>burst,</b> whilst light <b>stress</b> leads to ROS production in chloroplasts. Analysis of publicly available microarray data revealed that the transcriptional responses of the CRKs to O 3 were very similar to responses to microbes or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Several mutants altered in hormone biosynthesis or signalling showed changes in basal and O 3 -induced transcriptional responses. Conclusions Combining expression analysis from multiple treatments with mutants altered in hormone biosynthesis or signalling suggest a model in which O 3 and salicylic acid (SA) activate separate signaling pathways that exhibit negative crosstalk. Although O 3 is classified as an abiotic stress to plants, transcriptional profiling of CRKs showed strong similarities between the O 3 and biotic stress responses. </p...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT In plants, {{nitric oxide}} (NO) has {{multiple}} roles in defence reactions under abiotic stresses, including heavy metal load. Literature {{data suggest that}} there is a causal relationship between NO and iron metabolism but the effects of essential micronutrients/toxic heavy met-als on NO production have not been investigated. In this study our aim is to demonstrate the possible role of NO in the plant response to heavy metals in the metal accumulator Brassica juncea and the crop plant Pisum sativum grown in the presence of either 100 μM cadmium, copper or zinc. NO production was measured in the root tips with fluorescent method, using 4, 5 -diaminofluorescein diacetate (DAF- 2 DA), a specific dye to nitric oxide. We obtained differ-ent NO levels with the different heavy metal load: the most effective metal were copper and cadmium, in this case the NO production became double after one week treatment. In case of copper load, two-phase kinetics was found: a fast NO burst in the first six hours was followed by a slower, gradual increase. The fast appearance of NO in the presence of cupric ions suggest that it can be a novel reaction hitherto not studied in plants under heavy metal stress. After long-term treatment, NO levels were inversely related to the nitrite concentrations originated from nitrate reductase activity suggesting the conversion of nitrite to nitric oxide by the known enzymatic ways.
