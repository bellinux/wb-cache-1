The strepsirrhine uterus has two distinct chambers (bicornuate). Despite having similar gestation periods to comparably sized haplorhines, fetal growth rates are generally slower in strepsirrhines, which results in newborn offspring that are as little as one-third the size of haplorhine newborns. Extant strepsirrhines also have a lower <b>basal</b> <b>metabolic</b> <b>rate,</b> which elevates in females during gestation, putting greater demands on the mother.|$|E
40|$|Patients with COPD and {{bronchial}} asthma {{have been reported}} to have an increase in the energy cost of breathing which is reflected by changes in their <b>basal</b> <b>metabolic</b> <b>rates</b> (BMR). Aim: To assess the changes that may occur in <b>basal</b> <b>metabolic</b> <b>rates</b> in patients with {{bronchial asthma}} and those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Patients and methods: We used indirect calorimetry using oro-nasal mask to assess the BMR in 35 patients with COPD, 20 patients with bronchial asthma and 10 healthy volunteers (control group). Results: There was marked increase in <b>basal</b> <b>metabolic</b> <b>rates</b> in patients with COPD compared to patients with bronchial asthma (p value ⩽ 0. 001) and to the control group (p value ⩽ 0. 001), also between asthmatic patients and control group (p value ⩽ 0. 05). The BMR also showed a highly significant negative correlation (p value ⩽ 0. 001) with the level of hypoxemia and pulmonary functions (the severity of the disease) in both COPD and asthmatic patients. Conclusion: Patients with COPD and bronchial asthma have increased <b>metabolic</b> <b>rates.</b> These increased rates are directly correlated to the severity of the diseases and the impairment in the respiratory function...|$|R
50|$|Common ravens {{occupy a}} {{widespread}} geographical range and {{are found in}} many different habitats, including tundra, seacoasts, cliffs, mountainous forests, plains, deserts, and woodlands. Due to such a diverse habitat, this species is exposed to various temperatures and amounts of precipitation. Individuals that exist in warmer, drier environments have lower <b>basal</b> <b>metabolic</b> <b>rates</b> than organisms inhabiting non-arid areas. Physiologically, a reduced <b>metabolic</b> <b>rate</b> decreases endogenous heat production to prevent evaporative water loss, or more simply evaporation, and conserve energy in an environment with limited resources. A reduction of total evaporative water loss consists of decreases of both respiratory and cutaneous evaporation. In contrast, common ravens living at higher latitudes in temperate regions experience high <b>basal</b> <b>metabolic</b> <b>rates.</b> A higher metabolism is related to increased thermogenesis and cold tolerance.|$|R

For example, slow lorises can feed on Gluta bark, which may be fatal to humans.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{adapted to}} live in deserts are called xerocoles. There is no {{evidence}} that body temperature of mammals and birds is adaptive to the different climates, either of great heat or cold. In fact, with a very few exceptions, their <b>basal</b> <b>metabolic</b> <b>rate</b> is determined by body size, irrespective of the climate in which they live. Many desert animals (and plants) show especially clear evolutionary adaptations for water conservation or heat tolerance and so are often studied in comparative physiology, ecophysiology, and evolutionary physiology. One well-studied example is the specializations of mammalian kidneys shown by desert-inhabiting species. Many examples of convergent evolution have been identified in desert organisms, including between cacti and Euphorbia, kangaroo rats and jerboas, Phrynosoma and Moloch lizards.|$|E
5|$|The Inaccessible Island rail {{has a low}} <b>basal</b> <b>metabolic</b> <b>rate</b> (BMR), {{measured}} in 1989 at around 60–68% the rate expected for a bird of its weight. The scientists responsible for the study speculated that the low BMR was not {{as a result of}} flightlessness, which does not have this effect in other bird species, but was instead the result of the rail's island lifestyle. The island lacks predators and other competitors, and as such can be expected to be at full carrying capacity for rails. This in turn would favour energy conservation by the rails, resulting in small body size, low BMR and flightlessness. A comparison of flighted and flightless rails, including the Inaccessible Island rail, found that rails that lose the ability to fly also have low BMRs.|$|E

40|$|The {{costs of}} {{exploiting}} an organism's immune function {{are expected to}} {{form the basis of}} many life-history trade-offs. However, there has been debate about whether such costs can be paid in energetic and nutritional terms. We addressed this question in a study of wintering, free-living, male great tits by injecting them with a novel, non-pathogenic antigen (sheep red blood cells) and measuring the changes in their <b>basal</b> <b>metabolic</b> <b>rates</b> and various condition indices subsequent to immune challenge. The experiment showed that activation of the immune system altered the metabolic activity and profile of immune cells in birds during the week subsequent to antigen injection: individuals mounting an immune response had nearly 9 % higher <b>basal</b> <b>metabolic</b> <b>rates,</b> 8 % lower plasma albumin levels and 37 % higher heterophile-to-lymphocyte ratios (leucocytic stress indices) than sham-injected control birds. They also lost nearly 3 % (0. 5 g) of their body mass subsequent to the immune challenge. Individuals that mounted stronger antibody responses lost more mass during the immune challenge. These results suggest that energetic expenditures to immune response may have a non-trivial impact upon an individual's condition...|$|R
5|$|It has finely blotched yellow-green plumage, a {{distinct}} facial disc of sensory, vibrissa-like feathers, a large grey beak, short legs, large feet, and wings and a tail of relatively short length. A combination of traits make it unique among its kind; {{it is the}} world's only flightless parrot, the heaviest parrot, nocturnal, herbivorous, visibly sexually dimorphic in body size, has a low <b>basal</b> <b>metabolic</b> <b>rate</b> and no male parental care, {{and is the only}} parrot to have a polygynous lek breeding system. It is also possibly one of the world's longest-living birds. Its anatomy typifies the tendency of bird evolution on oceanic islands, with few predators and abundant food: a generally robust physique, with accretion of thermodynamic efficiency at the expense of flight abilities, reduced wing muscles, and a diminished keel on the sternum. Like many other New Zealand bird species, the kakapo was historically important to the Māori, the indigenous people of New Zealand, appearing in many of their traditional legends and folklore; however it was also heavily hunted and used as a resource by Māori, both for its meat as a food source and for its feathers, which were used to make highly valued pieces of clothing. Kakapos were also occasionally kept as pets.|$|E

40|$|Consuming a high-fat (HF) diet {{produces}} excessive weight gain, adiposity, and metabolic complications {{associated with}} {{risk for developing}} type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease. This study evaluated the influence of whey protein isolate (WPI) on systemic energy balance and metabolic changes in mice fed a HF diet. Female C 57 BL/ 6 J mice received for 11 wk a HF diet, with or without 100 g WPI/L drinking water. Energy consumption and glucose and lipid metabolism were examined. WPI mice had lower rates of body weight gain and percent body fat and greater lean body mass, although energy consumption was unchanged. These results were consistent with WPI mice having higher <b>basal</b> <b>metabolic</b> <b>rates,</b> respiratory quotients, and hepatic mitochondrial respiration. Health implications for WPI were reflected in early biomarkers for fatty liver disease and type 2 diabetes. Livers from WPI mice had significantly fewer hepatic lipid droplet numbers and less deposition of nonpolar lipids. Furthermore, WPI improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. We conclude that in mice receiving a HF diet, consumption of WPI results in higher <b>basal</b> <b>metabolic</b> <b>rates</b> and altered metabolism of dietary lipids. Because WPI mice had less hepatosteatosis and insulin resistance, WPI dietary supplements may be effective in slowing the development of fatty liver disease and type 2 diabetes...|$|R

25|$|Glycogen {{functions}} {{as one of}} two forms of long-term energy reserves, with the other form being triglyceride stores in adipose tissue (i.e., body fat). In humans, glycogen is made and stored primarily in {{the cells of the}} liver and skeletal muscle. In the liver, glycogen can make up from 5–6% of the organ's fresh weight and the liver of an adult weighing 70kg can store roughly 100–120grams of glycogen. In skeletal muscle, Glycogen is found in a low concentration (1–2% of the muscle mass) and the skeletal muscle of an adult weighing 70kg can store roughly 400grams of glycogen. The amount of glycogen stored in the body—particularly within the muscles and liver—mostly depends on physical training, <b>basal</b> <b>metabolic</b> <b>rate,</b> and eating habits.

25|$|As with birds, {{the main}} rule for mammals (with certain exceptions, see below) {{is that they}} have two {{essentially}} different stages of sleep: REM and NREM sleep (see above). Mammals' feeding habits are associated with their sleep length. The daily need for sleep is highest in carnivores, lower in omnivores and lowest in herbivores. Humans sleep less than many other omnivores but otherwise not unusually much or unusually little in comparison with other mammals. Many herbivores, like Ruminantia (such as cattle), spend much of their wake time in a state of drowsiness, which perhaps could partly explain their relatively low need for sleep. In herbivores, an inverse correlation is apparent between body mass and sleep length; big mammals sleep less than smaller ones. This correlation is thought to explain about 25% of the difference in sleep amount between different mammals. Also, the length of a particular sleep cycle is associated with the size of the animal; on average, bigger animals will have sleep cycles of longer durations than smaller animals. Sleep amount is also coupled to factors like basal metabolism, brain mass, and relative brain mass. The duration of sleep among species is also directly related to <b>basal</b> <b>metabolic</b> <b>rate</b> (BMR). Rats, which have a high BMR, sleep for up to 14 hours a day, whereas elephants and giraffes, which have lower BMRs, sleep only 3–4 hours per day.|$|E
