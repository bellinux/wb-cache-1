5|$|The {{top floor}} of the mill is the dust floor. It could be used for storage of grain and gives {{internal}} access to the cap. The cast-iron wallower, which is driven by the <b>brake</b> <b>wheel</b> is carried {{at the top of the}} upright shaft, in the centre of the mill.|$|E
5|$|The fantail and {{associated}} gearing was fitted to the mill. At {{the end of}} the second work-in, the cap could be turned by means of the hand crank. The fantail itself, with the blades painted red, white and blue was installed shortly afterwards. The clasp arm <b>brake</b> <b>wheel</b> was assembled around the windshaft. It was found that the wallower was eccentric on the upright shaft by ½ inch (13mm). When this was corrected the <b>brake</b> <b>wheel</b> was within 1/16 th of an inch (less than 1mm) of true. The clamps for the stocks were sawn from a baulk of pitch pine ready for completion later in the year. Other work included a new frame for one of the ground floor doors, cleaning and painting ironwork and further repointing on the brickwork. The four sails were fitted to the mill with the aid of a mobile crane at {{the end of the}} second work-in. The stock, with one sail attached was carefully inserted through the poll end of the windshaft and when wedged in position and the clamps had been attached the second sail was fitted to the stock. The process was repeated for the second pair of sails. The mill turned by wind again on the last day of the second work-in.|$|E
25|$|The Windshaft {{carries the}} Sails {{and also the}} <b>Brake</b> <b>Wheel</b> (Smock and Tower mills, and in some Post mills) or the Head Wheel and Tail Wheel in a Post Mill.

25|$|New Mill is a four-storey smock mill on a two-storey brick {{base with}} an {{attached}} miller's cottage. It has four patent sails {{carried on a}} cast-iron windshaft. It drives four pairs of millstones by wind, with a fifth pair powered by an auxiliary engine. This was a steam engine until 1911, then an oil engine and latterly an electric motor. The <b>Brake</b> <b>Wheel</b> is of composite construction, with an iron centre and wooden rim. This drives a cast-iron Wallower on the Upright Shaft, which carries a cast-iron Great Spur Wheel, which drives the millstones overdrift.|$|E
25|$|Drum brakes provide {{consistent}} braking in wet or dirty conditions {{since the}} mechanism is fully enclosed. They are usually heavier, more complicated, and often weaker than rim brakes, but they require less maintenance. Drum brakes do not adapt well to quick release axle fastening, and removing a drum <b>brake</b> <b>wheel</b> requires the operator to disconnect the brake cable {{as well as}} the axle. They also require a torque arm which must be anchored to the frame or fork of the bicycle, and not all bicycles are constructed to accommodate such fastenings or tolerate their applied forces.|$|E
25|$|Holton Windmill {{was built}} as an open trestle post mill. A {{roundhouse}} was added by 1835. The mill was originally winded by a tailpole. A Fantail was added and the mill was also worked by a steam engine. The mill {{has been extended}} at the head and the tail. The mill has one pair of Common sails and one pair of Spring sails. Only the cast iron windshaft and <b>Brake</b> <b>Wheel</b> remain of the internal machinery. The roundhouse appears from the outside to have only one storey, {{but it has been}} excavated internally to provide two storeys, cellar and ground floor.|$|E
30|$|For {{differential}} braking control: (1) In general, to prevent rollover or oversteer accidents, <b>braking</b> on outside <b>wheels</b> on axles {{in front of}} the CG point can generate a larger extra yaw moment than on rear axles. (2) To prevent understeering, braking on the inside wheels on axles after the CG point can generate better effects than braking on the front axles. (3) The largest yaw moment changes generated by <b>braking</b> on each <b>wheel</b> are limited not only by initial forces of the tires, ability of air braking system, and steering angle but also by distances between the axles and CG position. (4) In terms of <b>braking</b> <b>wheel,</b> when the root of the quadratic sum of braking force and lateral force is equal to the radius of Kamm’s Circle, <b>braking</b> <b>wheels</b> on the rear axle need a complex control logic. When the truck is in the danger of drifting, braking on front axles is a better choice.|$|R
40|$|The {{advantages}} {{to be gained}} from braking have not been ignored, and in the search for a suitable method many schemes have been suggested and tried. Some of the methods discussed in this paper include: 1) increasing the height of the landing gear; 2) air brakes of various forms; 3) sprags on tail skid and axle; and 4) <b>wheel</b> <b>brakes.</b> This report focuses on the design of <b>wheel</b> <b>brakes</b> and <b>wheel</b> <b>brake</b> controls...|$|R
50|$|Different from cars, planes or trains, {{motorcycle}} {{rear and}} front wheels are controlled separately. If the rider only <b>brakes</b> with one <b>wheel,</b> this <b>braked</b> <b>wheel</b> tends {{to lock up}} faster than if both brakes had been applied. A Combined Braking System therefore distributes the brake force also to the non-braked wheel to lower {{the possibility of a}} lock up, increase deceleration and reduce suspension pitch.|$|R
25|$|Upthorpe Mill is a {{post mill}} on a {{single-storey}} roundhouse. It has {{two pairs of}} Double Patent sails carried on a wooden windshaft with a cast-iron poll end. This carries a wooden <b>brake</b> <b>wheel</b> with iron segment teeth, driving a cast-iron wallower mounted on a wooden upright shaft. The cast iron great spur wheel drives two pairs of underdrift millstones. The tail stones were driven by belt. The tail of the mill has been extended to provide room for a wire machine. The eight bladed Fantail is mounted on the rear ladder in the Suffolk style and drove both wheels by means of gears and shafts. The main post carries the inscription R Rix 1807.|$|E
25|$|Gears {{inside a}} {{windmill}} convey {{power from the}} rotary motion of the sails to a mechanical device. The sails are carried on the horizontal windshaft. Windshafts can be wholly made of wood, or wood with a cast iron poll end (where the sails are mounted) or entirely of cast iron. The <b>brake</b> <b>wheel</b> is fitted onto the windshaft between {{the front and rear}} bearing. It has the brake around the outside of the rim and teeth {{in the side of the}} rim which drive the horizontal gearwheel called wallower on the top end of the vertical upright shaft. In grist mills, the great spur wheel, lower down the upright shaft, drives one or more stone nuts on the shafts driving each millstone. Post mills sometimes have a head and/or tail wheel driving the stone nuts directly, instead of the spur gear arrangement. Additional gear wheels drive a sack hoist or other machinery.|$|E
25|$|Shiremark Mill slowly became derelict, an {{inspection}} by Rex Wailes in 1933 {{resulted in an}} estimated repair cost of £100. The cap boarding was repaired but the mill was again left to deteriorate. In 1950, Capel Parish Council approached the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings {{and the owner of}} the mill with a view to securing the mill's preservation. The mill had been listed as an antiquity by Surrey County Council by 1951. In 1952, a detailed inspection of the mill found that the sills and lower part of the cant posts were rotten. Thompson's, the Alford millwrights estimated that the mill would cose £2,500 to restore. The main beams of the first floor were supported by brick piers, but no other work was done. Although the mill had all four sails in 1928, the sails fell off one by one, with the last falling in 1956. Photographs show that the cap was intact in August 1958, but by May 1966 the roof had gone, exposing the <b>brake</b> <b>wheel</b> to the weather.|$|E

500|$|Off-site, the new <b>brake</b> <b>wheel</b> and fantail were made. The {{original}} <b>brake</b> <b>wheel</b> was too rotten to repair, {{and showed}} {{evidence that it}} had been altered from the original one installed in 1819. The original <b>brake</b> <b>wheel</b> was [...] diameter to allow the Common sails to run at their optimum speed. When the mill was modernised in 1832 it was necessary to alter the gear ratios within the mill, as Patent sails run at a slower speed than Common sails. The great spur wheel was increased in diameter and the stone nuts reduced in diameter. The <b>brake</b> <b>wheel</b> was also rebuilt, with a cast iron segment ring fitted in place of the original cogs, resulting in a wheel [...] in diameter. The opinion of professional millwrights was sought, and it was decided that a scaled-up version of the original <b>brake</b> <b>wheel</b> would be made, but retaining the cast iron teeth segments. The remains of the original <b>brake</b> <b>wheel</b> were retained as an exhibit in the mill. The original iron segments were all broken, so a pattern was made and new segments were cast in heat-treated malleable cast iron. When the <b>brake</b> <b>wheel</b> was completed it was dismantled and transported to the mill ready for reassembly.|$|E

500|$|Stembridge Mill is a tower mill, {{a type of}} {{windmill}} {{which consists}} of a brick or stone tower, on top of which sits a roof or cap which can be turned to bring the sails into the wind. The advantage of the tower mill over the earlier post mill {{is that it is}} not necessary to turn the whole mill ("body", [...] "buck") with all its machinery into the wind; this allows more space for the machinery and storage. In the earliest tower mills the cap was turned into the wind with a long tail-pole which stretched to the ground at the back of the mill. Later, a looping chain was used which turned the cap with gears, as is used at Stembridge. It is [...] by a wheel and chain. The windshaft is of wood, with a cast iron cross, which carries four common sails. The <b>brake</b> <b>wheel</b> is of clasp arm construction.
