40|$|We have {{developed}} a simple method for identifying dielectric breakdown spots in gate oxides by using high selectiv-ity Cl radical etching. This method {{is based on the}} phenomenon that Cl radicals do not penetrate 5 i 02. They can etch the Si substrate through the <b>breakdown</b> <b>spot</b> which acts as the etching path, namely, the current leakage path. During over-etching of the poly-Si gate electrode, a cavelike etched region in the Si substrate appeared under the <b>breakdown</b> <b>spot</b> of the gate oxide. This <b>breakdown</b> <b>spot</b> could be found by focusing the optics on the gate oxide located at a center on the etched region. We confirmed the local structure of the gate oxide which converted to crystallized Si due to intrinsic dielec-tric breakdown using transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy.

By means of our model, we can estimate the number and the time evolution of those damaged regions produced by ion hits that generate <b>breakdown</b> <b>spots</b> during high field stresses after irradiation, including the dependence on the oxide field. Also, by using the proposed model, we have studied the wear-out dependence on the stress voltage, gate area, and ion fluence.

The spots are created at a low generation rate by applying an appropriate constant voltage stress to the devices. Because of the important thermal effects involved during degradation, the breakdown events leave their fingerprints on the top metal electrode {{in the form of}} two-dimensional point patterns. Contrary to what is expected, thermal mappings reveal that many of these failure sites do not longer conduct after their creation, which is consistent with a self-healing behavior. In order to investigate whether the local heat dissipation and thermal propagation induce spatial correlation among the failure events or not, the final <b>breakdown</b> <b>spot</b> spatial distributions are compared with simulations of homogeneous Poisson point processes in the plane and the results are validated against the smoothed residual field and quantile-quantile plots...|$|E

40|$|The spatial {{distribution}} of failure sites in large area (104 – 105 μm 2) metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitors with high-K dielectric (HfO 2) is investigated using angular wavelets. The failure sites are the consequence of constant or ramped electrical stress applied on the capacitors. Because of the important local thermal effects that take place during stress, the failure sites become visible as a point pattern on the top metal electrode. In case of less damaged devices, the results obtained with the wavelet variance method are consistent with an isotropic distribution of <b>breakdown</b> <b>spots</b> as expected for a Poisson point process (complete spatial randomness). On the contrary, for severely damaged devices, the method shows signs of preferred directions of degradation related to the voltage probe location.

For the first time, spatial and temporal stochastic and deterministic reliability effects are handled toghether in an efficient framework. The paper first introduces an equivalent transistor SPICE model, comprising the currently most important aging effects (i. e NBTI, hot carriers and soft breakdown). A simulation framework then uses this SPICE model to minimize the number of circuit factors and to build a circuit model. The latter allows for example very fast circuit yield analysis. Using experimental design techniques the proposed method is very efficient and also proves to be very flexible.

40|$|The {{time-dependent}} {{dielectric breakdown}} (TDDB) mechanism in Cu/ultra-low-k (ULK) on-chip interconnect structures has been raising serious reliability concerns for state-of-the-art microelectronic devices in recent years. An advanced experimental methodology, which combines {{transmission electron microscopy}} (TEM) imaging and an in-situ electrical test using a Hysitron PI 95 TEM holder, was used to study TDDB-induced damage mechanisms and degradation kinetics in Cu/ULK interconnect structures. In flawless Cu/ULK interconnect structures with locally very thin Ta-based barriers, slow but massive Cu migration into the SiO 2 layer was observed at the bottom corner of the M 1 metal after the TaN/Ta barrier had been firstly ruptured by the Ta migration, driven by the high electrical field. More importantly, {{it was found that}} both the high electric field and the massive metal migration into the SiO 2 can contribute to the final breakdown of the Cu/ULK interconnect structures. The final <b>breakdown</b> <b>spot</b> could be located either at the interface of the SiCN layer and the ULK material or in the SiO 2 layer, which depends on the geometry, the kind of dielectric materials (particularly ULK) and the driving force (the high electric field).

40|$|This {{study is}} focused on {{exploring}} the feasibility of an all-optic surface scanning method in determining the size and position of a submerged, laser generated, optoacoustic source. The optoacoustic effect was here generated when the absorption of a short electromagnetic pulse in matter caused a dielectric breakdown, a plasma emission flash and a subsequent acoustic wave. In the experiment, a laser pulse with l = 1064 nm and 12 ns pulse length was aimed at a volume of deionized water. When the laser beam was focused by a f = 16 mm lens, a single dielectric <b>breakdown</b> <b>spot</b> occurred. When a f = 40 mm was used several breakdowns in a row were induced. The breakdowns were photographed using a double shutter camera. The acoustic wave generated by the dielectric breakdowns were detected at a point on the water surface using a laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV). First, the LDV signal was {{used to calculate the}} speed of sound with an accuracy of 10 m/s. Secondly, the location and length of the dielectric breakdown was calculated with an accuracy of 1 mm. The calculated position matched the breakdown location recorded by a camera. The results show {{that it is possible to}} use LDV surface measurements from a single spot to determine both the position and length of the OA source as well as the speed of sound in the medium. Furthermore, the LDV measurements also show a secondary peak that originates from the OA source.

40|$|Transition to {{turbulence}} in {{boundary layer}} flows {{is a process}} involving several steps: receptivity to ambient disturbances, linear and non-linear disturbance growth, non-linear <b>breakdown</b> and turbulent <b>spot</b> or wedge formation and growth, and finally {{the establishment of the}} fully turbulent boundary layer. Ambient disturbances may be in the form of free stream turbulence or sound, but also vibrations of the surface as well as surface roughness may have a distinct role in setting up the initial conditions for further disturbance development. The details of the transition process depend on if the base flow is two- or three- dimensional, whether the flow is subjected to a pressure gradient (favorable or adverse) or not, and if the surface has a curvature (convex or concave) or is flat. Although many steps in the process of these different cases are fairly well understood, the receptivity is in all cases the least researched as well as least understood mechanism, {{despite the fact that it}} defines the starting point for the further development of the disturbance field...|$|R
40|$|With {{an insight}} that {{turbulence}} is caused and then sustained by {{a sequence of}} flow insta-bilities, {{we have been working}} on the transition to wall turbulence. In wall-bounded shear flows, transition depends on disturbance environments and therefore has various paths to wall turbulence even for the same flow geometry. In any transition path, however, prerequi-site for the onset of wall turbulence is development of low-speed streaks near the wall. Under low background turbulence, low-speed streaks appear at the later stage after the secondary high-frequency instability. With increasing background turbulence, low-speed streaks ap-pear at the initial stage of transition. When the low-speed streaks are intensified, they undergo oscillatory motions leading to subsequent streak <b>breakdown</b> into turbulent <b>spots</b> or patches. The oscillatory motion of streaks is due to the so-called streak instability, in-stability of inflectional velocity profiles across each low-speed streak. The present study concerns the instability and transition of low-speed streaks, which are also closely related to the regeneration mechanism of coherent near-wall vortices in wall turbulence [1, 2]. In order to examine how the streak instability leads to wall turbulence experimentally, it is important to realize laminar low-speed streaks as well as to introduce well-controlle...|$|R

40|$|Both optimal {{disturbances}} and {{optimal control}} are studied {{by means of}} numerical simulations for {{the case of the}} flat-plate boundary-layer flow. The optimisation method is the Lagrange multiplier technique where the objective function is the kinetic energy of the flow perturbations and the constraints involve the linearised Navier–Stokes equations. We consider both the optimal initial condition leading to the largest growth at finite times and the optimal time-periodic forcing leading to the largest asymptotic response. The optimal disturbances for spanwise wavelengths of the order of the boundary layer thickness are streamwise vortices exploiting the lift-up mechanism to create streaks. For long spanwise wavelengths it is the Orr mechanism combined with the amplification of oblique wave packets that is responsible for the disturbance growth. Control is applied to the bypass-transition scenario with high levels of free-stream turbulence. In this scenario low frequency perturbations enter the boundary layer and streamwise elongated disturbances emerge due to the non-modal growth. These so-called streaks are growing in amplitude until they reach high enough energy levels and <b>breakdown</b> into turbulent <b>spots</b> via their secondary instability. When control is applied in the form of wall blowing and suction, within the region that it is active, the growth of the streaks is delayed, which implies a delay of the whole transition process.

40|$|The {{interconnect}} module {{is one of}} {{the most}} important processing modules in a ULSI CMOS technology. It takes care of the transmission of the signals between the active devices in semiconductor chips. In the past, aluminum was used as metal interconnection material, whereas SiO 2 -based dielectrics were used as insulators between the metal lines. By the continuous scaling of the critical dimensions (CD) the RC-time constants of these interconnects were becoming higher than those of the active devices. In order to decrease these delay times, copper has been introduced as interconnect metal (to reduce R), whereas lowdielectric constant (low-k) materialswere introduced as insulator (to reduce C). One of the important aspects of this introduction which needs investigation is the potentially reduced inter-metal dielectric reliability, which is caused by the soft low-k materials and the shrinking line-spacings, and thus higher electrical field, in the copper interconnect system. In this PhD work, the reliability of inter-metal low-k dielectrics in copper damascene structures was studied. First of all, the leakage mechanisms and the properties of the metal/dielectric interfaces were investigated. It is found that the leakage current is caused by Frenkel-Poole emission for low-k dielectricswith sealing diffusion barriers, and the possibility of Schottky emission can be excluded based on the metal/dielectric interface characterization. During a bias stress, the defect distribution within a low-k changes, by which the leakagemechanism changes to a so-calledmodified Frenkel-Poole mechanism. Next, the time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) of low-k dielectrics was investigated. It is demonstrated that the TDDB lifetime margins of low-k dielectrics are shrinking with CD scaling and the introduction of new low-k materials. For inter-metal dielectrics, the Poisson area scaling which is commonly observed in gate oxides, is not valid in low-k dielectrics due to a strong layout dependence of the <b>breakdown</b> <b>spots.</b> Moreover, it was found that there exists an interaction between electromigration tests under high stress current densities, and the low-k degradation. In a third part the influence of a number of critical processing steps on the low-k reliability was investigated. Three steps were identified as being critical: 1) CMP and post CMP clean; 2) metal diffusion barrier integrity; 3) low-k plasma etch/ash. The major degradation factors include copper contamination and moisture uptake. By annealing the samples with moisture, the low-k reliability can be partly restored, but not to a level which is possible to be comparable to an optimized integration scheme.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{reports a}} study of. certain acidity changes occuring in Grimes and Jonathan under various storage conditions. Measurements {{were made of}} the total titratable acid, the H-ion concentration and, in some instances, the specific gravity of the juice. Altho total acidity values declined rapidly in the Grimes variety during two weeks of delay at the orchard, its H-ion concentration remained quite uniform. Prolonging the delayed storage period to three weeks, however, resulted in a rather abrupt lowering of the active acidity of the fruit in cold storage. The appearance of soggy breakdown in the stored fruit occurred almost coincidently with a rather marked diminution in the H-ion concentration. This relationship suggests {{the possibility of an}} intimate balance between the active acidity and the carbohydrate reserves of the Grimes apple at low temperatures. The H-ion concentration during delayed storage at the orchard, was decidedly more constant in Jonathan. This fact suggests a difference in buffer stability between the two varieties of fruit. The data for the active acidity changes in Jonathan were not of a similar nature during the two storage seasons. Soft scald and Jonathan spot formation also differed for the two years. There appears to be an inverse relationship between the percentage of total acid loss during storage and the susceptibility toward Jonathan spot. A low acid loss during storage usually produced a high percentage of spotted tissue. The total acidity decreased gradually during cold storage in both Grimes and Jonathan. Decrease was more rapid at the higher temperatures. Total acidity decreased more in Grimes during delayed storage at the orchard than thruout the entire cold storage period. The delayed fruit was stored with considerably less total acid than that receiving no such treatment. During storage two conditions appear to influence the total amount of acid lost: (1) The initial acid content when stored, and (2) the storage temperature. Delayed storage lots with low initial acidity lose their total acid in smaller quantities at 30 ° and 32 °F. than similar lots at 34 ° and 36 °F. The amount of acid loss, then, appears to be regulated largely by a certain minimum temperature level, below which the loss will be relatively little regardless of acid content, above which the loss will be considerably higher even tho the acid content is relatively low {{at the beginning of the}} storage period. The amount of breakdown tends to occur in an inverse proportion to the losses in total acidity during cold storage. A large amount of soggy breakdown is usually accompanied by a smaller amount of acid loss, and, conversely, a low amount of breakdown is associated with a higher acid loss. In order to avoid soggy breakdown, it follows, then, that the rate of acid loss must be fairly constant. This may be accomplished by storing the fruit before the acid content becomes low (directly after picking), or by storing at a temperature sufficiently high to permit acid losses to continue at a more favorable and a more rapid rate. Altho acid changes appear to be rather definitely associated with <b>breakdown</b> and Jonathan <b>spot</b> susceptibility, other physiological changes occur which may influence these storage disorders. A decided increase in the specific gravity of the juice from Grimes, during delayed storage at the orchard, indicates definite changes in the metabolism of the fruit. Apples delayed for one week showed similar increases in this constant thruout the cold storage period. Little or no increase in specific gravity, however, occurred in the stored fruit which had been delayed at the orchard for two or three weeks. The juice of Jonathan maintained a very uniform constant, irrespective of the delayed storage at the orchard or treatment at the lower temperatures. This different response toward specific gravity and acidity changes in the two varieties may aid in the explanation of the differences in the storage capacity of Grimes and Jonathan. It would appear that the storage capacity of some varieties of apples could be forecast by changes appearing in the specific gravity of their juices...|$|R
