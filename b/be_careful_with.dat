John Fleck (Gecko) spent over ten hours in makeup each day to transform {{into and out of}} his character. The skin, which needed to look like alligator hide, consisted of seven or eight separate pieces and needed to be glued to Fleck's face. Patrick Bauchau (Lodz) had several contact lenses pairs of different opaqueness. While one pair enabled him to see shapes, another pair made him basically blind and he had to be led around the set. Debra Christofferson (Lila) had a fake beard applied to her chin; the beard was custom-made by hand-tying human hair onto lace that would disappear when the beard was glued onto the skin. The beard of the early episodes was so heavy that the chemicals caused Christofferson's skin to be raw {{at the end of the}} shooting day, and was later split into three pieces. Christofferson still needed to <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>with</b> mouth movements. According to the actress, [...] "the beard actually determined Lila's voice." ...|$|E

His wretched life conditions worsened with his brother's marriage to Memia Saheb Ettabaâ, daughter of a former minister.

Despite his strictness and rigidity, the headmaster permitted him to remake the sixth and last year of high school in the 1919–1920 school year. But the cold of winter and junk food caused by deprivation on the initiative of the school headmaster who supported a War effort, worsened the boy's health. In addition, Bourguiba was hospitalized because of a primary infection, which led him to abandon high school and remain at the hospital.

After marginal sales from her debut album, Velasquez {{signed a contract}} with Vicor Music Corporation, who was {{at the helm of the}} production of her sophomore release. For the project, Velasquez worked with Louie Ocampo, who provided the musical arrangement for the album’s lead single [...] "Narito Ako", a song originally recorded and performed by Maricris Belmont and written by Nonong Pedero for the 1978 Metro Manila Popular Music Festival. Nineteen 90 was released and accepted by critics as a more mature album than its predecessor. The album, though being all original recordings in content, was largely driven by its lead single cover and managed sales of over 80,000 units. In July 1990, Velasquez headlined her first major venue concert as a solo artist in support of the album at the Folk Arts Theater. That 1990, Velasquez recorded a duet with Jose Mari Chan, [...] "Please <b>Be</b> <b>Careful</b> <b>With</b> My Heart", for his sixth studio album, Constant Change and contributed backing vocals for Gary Valenciano's [...] "Each Passing Night", a single featured on his sixth album, Faces of Love. By the end of 1990, Velasquez made her North American concert debut at the Isaac Stern Auditorium of the Carnegie Hall in Manhattan, New York City, a first for any other Asian solo artist. Soon after, British theatrical producer Sir Cameron Mackintosh, invited Velasquez to audition for the West End production of the musical Miss Saigon. Velasquez later received a letter from the production company offering intensive musical theater training in London, United Kingdom, she ultimately declined the offer citing inadequate theatrical experience: [...] "I’ve never done theater before. That was a big break but I said no. I’m more familiar with concerts, not theater. I was also scared." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sackville-West {{loved to}} travel, {{frequently}} going to France, Spain and to visit Nicolson in Persia, and these trips were emotionally draining for Woolf, who missed Sackville-West intensely. Woolf's novel To the Lighthouse with its theme of longing {{for someone who}} is not there was inspired partly by the frequent absences of Sackville-West. Woolf was inspired by Sackville-West to write one of her most famous novels, , featuring a protagonist who changes sex over the centuries. This work was described by Sackville-West's son Nigel Nicolson as [...] "the longest and most charming love-letter in literature." [...] Unusually, Woolf documented the moment of the conception of Orlando: she wrote in her diary on 5 October 1927: [...] "And instantly the usual exciting devices enter my mind: a biography beginning in the year 1500 and continuing to the present day, called Orlando: Vita; only with a change about from one sex to the other" [...] (excerpt from her diary published posthumously by her husband Leonard Woolf). Woolf felt she needed Sackville-West's permission to write Orlando, asking in a letter: [...] "But listen, suppose Orlando turns out to be Vita and its all about you and the lusts of your flesh and the lure of your mind...Do you mind, say Yes or No?" [...] Reflecting Sackville-West's interest in the Romany, when Orlando goes to bed as a man and mysteriously wakes up as a woman in Constantinople (which is implied might have been the result of a spell cast by a Romany witch whom he married), it is at a Romany camp in the Balkans that Orlando is first welcomed and accepted as a woman, as the Romany in the novel make no distinctions between the sexes. [...] Ultimately Woolf satirizes Sackville-West's Romany fetish, as Orlando, an English aristocrat, prefers not to live in poverty as part of wandering Romany caravan in the Balkans, because the call of a settled life of the aristocracy at a country house in England proves to too strong for her, just as in real life Sackville-West fantasised about living the nomadic life of a Romany, but in reality preferred the settled life in the English countryside. [...] Orlando, which was intended as a fantasy where the character of Orlando (a stand-in for Sackville-West) inherits an estate not unlike Knole (which Sackville-West would have inherited as the eldest child if she had been a man) ironically marked the beginning of a tension between the two women. Sackville-West often complained in her letters that Woolf was more interested in writing a fantasy about her than in returning her gestures of affection in the real world. After finishing Orlando, Woolf wrote a letter to Sackville-West saying: [...] "For Promiscuous you are and that is all to be said about it. Look in the Index of Orlando-after Pippin and see what comes next-Promiscuity passim". In another letter, Woolf warned Sackville-West: [...] "Yes, you are an agile animal-no doubt about it-but as to your gambols being diverting...I'm not so sure...I'm a fair-minded woman. You only <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>with</b> your gamboling or you'll find Virginia's soft crevices lined with hooks".|$|E
