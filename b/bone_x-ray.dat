40|$|Contrast {{enhancement}} plays {{a fundamental}} role in image processing. Many histogram-based techniques {{are widely used}} for contrast enhancement of given images, due to their simple function and effectiveness. However, the conventional histogram equalization (HE) methods result in excessive contrast enhancement, which causes natural looking and satisfactory results for a variety of low contrast images. To solve such problems, a novel multi-histogram equalization technique is proposed to enhance the contrast of the palm <b>bone</b> <b>X-ray</b> radiographs in this paper. For images, the mean-variance analysis method is employed to partition the histogram of the original grey scale image into multiple sub-histograms. These histograms are independently equalized. By using this mean-variance partition method, a proposed multi-histogram equalization technique is employed to achieve the contrast enhancement of the palm <b>bone</b> <b>X-ray</b> radiographs. Experimental results show that the multi-histogram equalization technique achieves a lower average absolute mean brightness error (AMBE) value. The multi-histogram equalization technique simultaneously preserved the mean brightness and enhanced the local contrast of the original image...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This {{present report}} {{concerns}} an infantile patient with mucolipidosis II, who showed transient cortical bone hyperostosis followed by severe osteopenia. The diagnosis of mucolipidosis II was made {{based on the}} leakage of lysosomal enzymes in serum and conditioned media of the patient’s skin fibroblasts, low activity of lysosomal enzymes of the fibroblasts and mutation of c. 2086 _ 2089 insC (p. L 697 fs) and c. 3565 C>T (p. R 1189 X) in the GNPTAB gene. <b>Bone</b> <b>X-ray</b> analysis demonstrated a periosteal reaction and elevated bone resorption {{at the age of}} 2 mo. Bone markers, including alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin and urine deoxypyridinoline, also indicated a high turnover of bone metabolism; however, no apparent rickets-like changes and no increased levels of PTH were observed. Elevated bone resorption is possibly associated with the leakage of lysosomal enzyme from osteoclasts into bone matrices. Bone formation gradually reduced, and increased bone resorption persisted. This led to severe osteopenia at the age of 6 mo. Characteristic bone findings may contribute to early diagnosis of mucolipidosis II, but their pathogenesis remains to be clarified...|$|E

The patient never passed hematuria due to tumor of the kidney. Metastatic tumor of the cervical spine, however, progressively increased and the patient became paraplegic. For the purpose of relieving the pressure upon the cord, the tumor was approached anteriorly but could not be resected because of profuse hemorrhage from the tumor.

40|$|Problem statement: Currently {{doctors in}} {{orthopedic}} wards inspect the <b>bone</b> <b>x-ray</b> images {{according to their}} experience and knowledge in bone fracture analysis. Manual examination of x-rays has multitude drawbacks. The process is time-consuming and subjective. Approach: Since detection of fractures is an important orthopedics and radiologic problem and therefore a Computer Aided Detection(CAD) system should be developed to improve the scenario. In this study, a fracture detection CAD based on GLCM recognition could improve the current manual inspection of x-ray images system. The GLCM for fracture and non-fracture bone is computed and analysis is made. Features of Homogeneity, contrast, energy, correlation are calculated to classify the fractured bone. Results: 30 images of femur fractures have been tested, the result shows that the CAD system can differentiate the x-ray bone into fractured and nonfractured femur. The accuracy obtained from the system is 86. 67. Conclusion: The CAD system is proved {{to be effective in}} classifying the digital radiograph of bone fracture.

40|$|Paget’s {{disease of}} bone (PDB) is a chronic {{localized}} skeletal disease {{that belongs to}} a group of metabolic osteopathies and is characterized by impaired bone remodeling to form foci of increased bone resorption followed by replacement with an excessive amount of defective, less durable bone that is prone to deformities and pathologic fractures. The course of PDB shows three stages: rarefaction, compaction, and coarse-trabecular remodeling – each of which is characterized by certain clinical, biochemical, and radiological manifestations. The majority of the clinical manifestations of the disease are associated with skeletal injury. The disease is characterized by the appearance of bone and joint pain in case of secondary osteoarthritis, bone deformities, pathological fractures, hearing loss due to damage to the skull bones, etc. In many patients, the disease is asymptomatic and detected incidentally after finding a high serum alkaline phosphatase activity or during <b>bone</b> <b>X-ray</b> for any pathological processes, but it can be diagnosed fairly late in the development of complications, as shown in the clinical examples.

The elcation test was evaluated in 87 patients with multiple myeloma and 15 with osteopor-osis. The maximum value of hypocalcemia induced by elcatonin was ≧ 0. 25 mmol/L which was considered as an abnormal response compared with the mormal response. The elcationin test is related to the prevailing rate of osteoclastic bone resorption. Myeloma patients with advanced bone disease (multiple lytic lesion, Mixed type) had a higher abnormal response such as hypercalcemia, hyper ALP, hot of the bone status, urine hydroxproline and decrease in the bone mineral then myeloma patients with slight bone disease (diffuse proliferation type).

Reconstruction of large bone defects after resection of malignant musculoskeletal tumors is a significant challenge in orthopedic surgery.

40|$|International audienceIt {{has been}} shown that the {{analysis}} of two dimensional (2 D) <b>bone</b> <b>X-ray</b> images based on the fractional Brownian motion (fBm) model is a good indicator for quantifying alterations in the three dimensional (3 D) bone micro-architecture. However, this 2 D measurement is not a direct assessment of the 3 D bone properties. In this paper, we first show that S 3 D, the self-similarity parameter of 3 D fBm, is linked to S 2 D, that of its 2 D projection, by S 3 D = S 2 D 0. 5. In the light of this theoretical result, we have experimentally examined whether this relation holds for trabecular bone. Twenty one specimens of trabecular bone were derived from frozen human femoral heads. They were digitized using a high resolution l-CT. Their projections were simulated numerically by summing the data in the three orthogonal directions and both 3 D and 2 D self-similarity parameters were measured. Results show that the self-similarity of the 3 D bone volumes and that of their projections are linked by the previous equation. This demonstrates that a simple projection provides 3 D information about the bone structure.

40|$|Now-a-days X-rays {{are playing}} very {{important}} role in medicine. One {{of the most important}} applications of Xray is detecting fractures in <b>bones.</b> <b>X-ray</b> provides important information about the type and location of the fracture.

To detect minute fractures, in this paper various edge feature extraction methods are analyzed which helps medical practitioners to study the bone structure, detects the bone fracture, measurement of fracture treatment, and treatment planning prior to surgery. The classical derivative edge detection operators such as Roberts, Prewitt, sobel, Laplacian of Gaussian can be used as edge detectors, but a lot of false edge information will be extracted. Therefore a technique based on orthogonal wavelet transforms like Haar, daubechies, coiflet, symlets are applied to detect the edges and are compared.
