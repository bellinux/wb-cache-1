And I can sum up that difference in one word: none.|$|E
500|$|After leaving The Hills, Conrad {{appeared}} on The View in June 2009, {{where she was}} asked how she felt about her apology from Pratt involving the sex tape rumors. She replied, [...] "To be perfectly honest, I wasn't on the other line of that call [...] I didn't even know about it until , so no, I didn't get an apology, he's lying". At Montag and Pratt's wedding, it was depicted on the series as if Conrad and Cavallari were displeased with each other's presence, though the latter commented that they gave each other [...] "a big hug, and that's it". She also stated that when she joined The Hills, [...] "It's work! And drama sells. I think that's why they're bringing me in, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> works".|$|E
2500|$|On May 22, 2009, a video went viral of Hamilton freestyling, {{and then}} getting {{assaulted}} by his former girlfriend/fellow rapper Briana Latrise, the stepdaughter of Mary J. Blige, due to Hamilton rapping, [...] "OK, call me irresponsible and immature, but you're beautiful, {{what the hell}} else would I hit it for? Now I can say that I hit it raw, but {{that would mean that}} you will have to get an abor, or I just not need to go there", clarifying at some point at that past time that Hamilton had got Latrise pregnant but for undisclosed reasons Latrise would have an abortion. On May 25, 2009, during an interview, they both publicly apologized to each other, with Hamilton stating, [...] "I apologize honestly for putting some things out there that shouldn't have been out there. I understand it; it was the heat of the moment, and I didn't get the chance to really talk to you about it. I {{just wanted to tell you}} I apologize <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> I shouldn't have said", and with Latrise remarking, [...] "I'm going to thank you for your apology. I'm going to apologize for acting outside of the norm. We're going to talk about our personal business, on our personal time." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sima Yi's {{subordinates}} feared {{losing the}} wheat, but Sima Yi said, [...] "Zhuge Liang thinks {{too much and}} makes too little decisions. He'll definitely fortify his camp and defences first before coming to harvest the wheat. Two days is sufficient for me (to reach Shanggui County)." [...] He then led his troops and travelled overnight to Shanggui County. Zhuge Liang retreated after seeing Sima Yi's approach. Sima Yi commented, [...] "I'm weary from traveling day and night. This is <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> militarists covet. Zhuge Liang does not dare to remain near the Wei River. This is easy for me." [...] Initially, the Wei emperor Cao Rui wanted to supply Sima Yi's army with the wheat in Shanggui County and had rejected a proposal to transport grain from Guanzhong to the frontline. However, Zhuge Liang's movements {{turned out to be}} quicker than Cao Rui anticipated; only a portion of the wheat produce in Shanggui County was left after the Shu army's harvesting. The Wei general Guo Huai then asserted his influence over local nomadic tribes and forced them to produce food supplies for the Wei army. The Wei army was thus able to gain access to food supplies without assistance from the central government in Luoyang.|$|E

5000|$|Jordan has {{suggested}} {{that many of the}} rows featured on-screen between Alfie and his love-interest Kat were word-for-word arguments he had with his wife, Tracy. He commented, [...] "Wed be watching EastEnders at home, then an Alfie and Kat scene would start and Id think, Oh shit, <b>because</b> <b>Id</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> was coming.

[...] Barbara made more than one attempt to renew the conversation before the evening came, but Phineas thought that he had had enough of it.

However Nilsson claims her [...] "explosive" [...] high notes that were her biggest asset on-stage [...] "have not been recorded like they should have been" [...] in the studio. She later lamented: [...] "It always made me a little bit sad when I heard my own recordings. And many people told me that I sang much better in person than I do on the recordings! That didn't flatter me at all, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what's</b> going to be left when I am no longer singing".

6000|$|Then Suleiman-bin-Daoud rose up {{from his}} seat under the camphor-tree, and {{stretched}} his arms and rejoiced and said, 'O my Lady and Sweetener of my Days, know that if I had made a magic against my Queens {{for the sake of}} pride or anger, as I made that feast for all the animals, I should certainly have been put to shame.

Tell me, therefore, O my Lady and Heart of my Heart, how did you come to be so wise?' And Balkis the Queen, beautiful and tall, looked up into Suleiman-bin-Daoud's eyes and put her head a little on one side, just like the Butterfly, and said, 'First, O my Lord, because I loved you; and secondly, O my Lord, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> women-folk are.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't think I {{was crying}} because I was really so {{very fond of}} him," [...] {{reflected}} Anne. [...] "I just cried because all the others did. It was Ruby Gillis started it. Ruby Gillis has always declared she hated Mr. Phillips, but {{just as soon as}} he got up to make his farewell speech she burst into tears. Then all the girls began to cry, one after the other. I tried to hold out, Marilla. I tried to remember the time Mr. Phillips made me sit with Gil--with a, boy; and the time he spelled my name without an e on the blackboard; and how he said I was the worst dunce he ever saw at geometry and laughed at my spelling; and all the times he had been so horrid and sarcastic; but somehow I couldn't, Marilla, and I just had to cry too. Jane Andrews has been talking for a month about how glad she'd be when Mr. Phillips went away and she declared she'd never shed a tear. Well, she was worse than any of us and had to borrow a handkerchief from her brother--of course the boys didn't cry--because she hadn't brought one of her own, not expecting to need it. Oh, Marilla, it was heartrending. Mr. Phillips made such a beautiful farewell speech beginning, 'The time has come for us to part.' It was very affecting. And he had tears in his eyes too, Marilla. Oh, I felt dreadfully sorry and remorseful for all the times I'd talked in school and drawn pictures of him on my slate and made fun of him and Prissy. I can tell you I wished I'd been a model pupil like Minnie Andrews. She hadn't anything on her conscience. The girls cried all the way home from school. Carrie Sloane kept saying every few minutes, 'The time has come for us to part,' and that would start us off again whenever we were in any danger of cheering up. I do feel dreadfully sad, Marilla. But one can't feel quite in the depths of despair with two months' vacation before them, can they, Marilla? And besides, we met the new minister and his wife coming from the station. For all I was feeling so bad about Mr. Phillips going away I couldn't help taking a little interest in a new minister, could I? His wife is very pretty. Not exactly regally lovely, of course--it wouldn't do, I suppose, for a minister to have a regally lovely wife, because it might set a bad example. Mrs. Lynde says the minister's wife over at Newbridge sets a very bad example because she dresses so fashionably. Our new minister's wife was dressed in blue muslin with lovely puffed sleeves and a hat trimmed with roses. Jane Andrews said she thought puffed sleeves were too worldly for a minister's wife, but I didn't make any such uncharitable remark, Marilla, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> it is to long for puffed sleeves. Besides, she's only been a minister's wife for a little while, so one should make allowances, shouldn't they? They are going to board with Mrs. Lynde until the manse is ready." ...|$|E

500|$|While officially {{the matter}} was {{considered}} closed, many individual MPs had doubts, although none openly expressed disbelief at this stage. Wigg later said that he left the House that morning [...] "with black rage in my heart <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> the facts were. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> the truth." [...] Most newspapers were editorially non-committal; only The Guardian, under the headline [...] "Mr Profumo clears the air", stated openly that the statement should be taken at its face value. Within a few days press attention was distracted by the re-emergence of Keeler, in Madrid. She expressed astonishment at the fuss her absence had caused, adding that her friendship with Profumo and his wife was entirely innocent {{and that she had}} many friends in important positions. She claimed that she had not deliberately missed the Edgecombe trial but had been confused about the date. She was required to forfeit her recognizance of £40, but no other action was taken against her.|$|R
6000|$|The other {{sight of}} the evening was a horror. The little tragedy played itself out at a {{neighboring}} table where two very young men and two very young women were sitting. It did not strike me till far into the evening that the pimply young reprobates were making the girls drunk. They gave them red wine and then white, and the voices rose slightly with the maidens' cheek flushes. I watched, wishing to stay, and the youths drank till their speech thickened and their eye-balls grew watery. It was sickening to see, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> was going to happen. My friend eyed the group, and said:--"Maybe they're children of respectable people. I hardly think, though, they'd be allowed out without any better escort than these boys. And yet {{the place is a}} place where every one comes, as you see. They may be Little Immoralities--in which case they wouldn't be so hopelessly overcome with two glasses of wine. They may be--" ...|$|R
