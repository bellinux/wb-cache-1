5|$|At first, the two fighters seem equally matched, but Miura soon {{finds himself}} unable to {{penetrate}} Ip's impeccable defense and is overwhelmed by his relentless and direct blows.

5|$|Until 1805, Dürenstein was {{probably}} {{best known as}} the village in which crusader Richard the Lionheart was held by LeopoldV, Duke of Austria. In 1741, during the War of the Austrian Succession, several hundred local villagers had held off the French and Bavarian armies, intent on capturing Vienna, by painting drain pipes to look like cannons, and <b>beating</b> <b>on</b> drums, thus suggesting the presence of a large force.|$|E
5|$|Bart {{explains}} that he knew Homer would probably change his mind, and decided to send the letter before that could happen. Homer desperately tries to prevent the letter from reaching Mr. Burns, but fails. Mr. Burns becomes furious and demands that Homer be beaten. However, Smithers calls off the <b>beating</b> <b>on</b> the grounds that {{is no way to}} thank the man who saved Mr. Burns' life, and instead convinces Mr. Burns to instead reward the Simpson family. The Simpsons receive an antique Xtapolapocetl, an Olmec head (a massive, Tiki-god-like affair) that Bart, the blood donor, likes, and which Homer hates.|$|E

5|$|In {{the next}} match, John Cena faced Randy Orton for the WWE Championship. Cena raging entered {{the ring and}} started <b>beating</b> <b>on</b> Orton until Orton struck Cena down. Orton covered Cena, but Cena kicked out at two. Cena angrily lost control and began beating Orton. The referee Mike Chioda tried to stop Cena from {{continuously}} punching Orton, but Cena continued and was disqualified. Therefore, Orton won the match, but not the title, because titles can't change hands by disqualification. In result, John Cena retained the WWE Championship. Outside the ring, Cena put Orton in the STFU while Cena's father kicked Orton in the head the same way Orton had kicked in his head on a previous episode of Raw. After the match, Jonathan Coachman booked Cena in a Last Man Standing match against Orton for the WWE Title at No Mercy.|$|E

25|$|Perceived {{failure or}} {{insufficient}} {{devotion to the}} Emperor would attract punishment, frequently of the physical kind.

25|$|Tony and McGee {{are both}} later {{captured}} by Saleem on purpose {{as part of}} the operation to take down the terrorist prison camp. They suffer an initial <b>beating</b> <b>on</b> being taken hostage, but neither are shown being subjected to torture for information. As the entire premiere is set during Tony's interrogation, NCIS writers opted to script Saleem as injecting Tony with truth serum as a means of obtaining information from him. Glue, which tightens the skin, was put on the actors' lips to effectively make all three characters look sunburned and dehydrated.|$|E
25|$|As a child, he was {{described}} as hyperactive, and after neighbors complained of hearing seven-year-old Puente <b>beating</b> <b>on</b> pots and window frames, his mother sent him to 25-cent piano lessons. By the age of 10, he switched to percussion, drawing influence from jazz drummer Gene Krupa. He later created a song-and-dance duo with his sister Anna in the 1930s and intended to become a dancer, but an ankle tendon injury prevented him pursuing dance as a career. When the drummer in Machito's band was drafted to the army, Puente subsequently took his place.|$|E
25|$|The Tamil people practiced a very {{systematic}} {{method of}} cultivation during the Sangam age. It was known that ploughing, manuring, weeding, irrigation and crop protection {{need to be}} followed in a proper way for the yield to be rich. Tiruvalluvar, in his Tirukkural, emphasizes the need {{for all of these}} steps to be undertaken in a careful manner {{in order to get a}} good yield. A paddy field was also known as Kalam and was ploughed with the help of oxen. Ploughed lands were leveled by the peasants using their feet, followed by the planting of the paddy seeds. Once the seeds grew into saplings, they were transplanted and when the crop was mature, it was harvested. Weeds were removed periodically. Paddy was removed from the harvested stalks by <b>beating</b> <b>on</b> the ground or by getting bullocks to tread on them. Cleared paddy was collected, measured and stored in proper containers. Millets were grown on the Pinpulam or the dry lands and in the Kurinji region. Crop rotation was followed – for instance, cotton and millets were grown simultaneously on the same plot and after that, beans were cultivated on it.|$|E

25|$|On March 3, 1995, Hug {{entered the}} 1995 Grand Prix at {{the round of}} sixteen {{qualifier}} where his rivalry with Mike Bernardo began. Both fighters traded heavy shots with Bernardo seemingly getting the better until Hug dropped him with a high kick {{towards the end of}} the first round. The South African boxer continued to pile on the pressure, however, and in the third, knocked Hug down with a left hook shortly followed by a standing eight count. Finally, he forced Hug into a corner and delivered a relentless <b>beating</b> <b>on</b> the Swiss karateka until referee Nobuaki Kakuda finally stopped the bout after a prolonged barrage of unanswered punches. Hug had a quick turnaround, as he was back in the ring on May 4, 1995, scoring a forty-five second knockout over Peter Kramer in a K-1 World Grand Prix 1995 non-tournament affair. On June 10, 1995, Hug made the first defence of his UKF title against Dennis Lane at K-1 Fight Night in Zurich, the first K-1 event held in Switzerland. In a rather one-sided fight, Andy Hug knocked Lane down twice in the first two rounds before the American quit on his stool.|$|E

500|$|Kellie Loder {{was born}} to Christina and Bob Loder in 1988, and was raised in Badger, a town in the Canadian {{province}} of Newfoundland and Labrador. She considers her first introduction to music {{to have taken place}} before she was born; her mother frequently played Michael W.

Loder claims to have [...] "natural rhythm" [...] and that she began emulating the drummer at her Pentecostal church by <b>beating</b> <b>on</b> a pew with pencils at the age of two. At age 10, Loder was placed in her church's drumming ensemble.|$|E
500|$|The rhythm {{section is}} more {{pronounced}} in the mix on Achtung Baby, and hip hop-inspired electronic dance beats are featured {{on many of the}} album's tracks, most prominently [...] "The Fly".

[...] "Mysterious Ways" [...] combines a funky guitar riff with a danceable, conga-laden beat, for what Bono called [...] "U2 at our funkiest... Sly and The Family Stone meets Madchester baggy." [...] Amidst layers of distorted guitars, [...] "The Fly" [...] and [...] "Zoo Station" [...] feature industrial-influenced percussion—the timbre of Mullen's drums exhibits a [...] "cold, processed sound, something like <b>beating</b> <b>on</b> a tin can", according to author Albin Zak.|$|E

500|$|The call {{is a low}} drumming, {{accompanied}} by a tuk, tuk, tuk made with the wings. The nature of the vocalisation led to a local legend that the sound is made by the bird <b>beating</b> <b>on</b> a hollow tree or branch with its feet. Gerd Heinrich noted the local name [...] "soisa", meaning drum, and described the call as being a subdued drumming purre – purre – purre – purre – purre which sometimes ends in a loud shrill scream. The bird also produced a dull hum similar {{to the voice of}} the banded pig (Sus scrofa vittatus) and reminiscent of the call of the snoring rail (Aramidopsis plateni). Calling is most frequent in the early morning or late evening, and a human tapping a sago stem with a machete may elicit a response from the bird. A quieter version of the call is given at the nest.|$|E
500|$|There {{were two}} wounds {{to his right}} side, and two {{to the top of}} his head, which would {{probably}} have resulted in unconsciousness. The left side of his lip was wounded, his jaw was fractured, and his teeth, neck and larynx were damaged. The pathologist said he [...] "would {{not have been able to}} engage in purposeful talk", according to the Court of Appeal. There were gunshot wounds to his left shoulder and left elbow. The court heard that he had [...] "black eyes and a broken nose, linear bruising to the cheeks, lacerations to the head, linear type bruising to the right forearm, bruising to the left wrist and forearm and three circular burn type marks to the back. The linear marks were consistent with Mr Bamber having been struck with a long blunt object, possibly a gun."

500|$|Taylor {{withstood}} {{a tremendous}} amount of punishment throughout the game. At one point in the first quarter, he bit his tongue while being tackled by Huff, causing him to swallow blood {{for the rest of the}} game. He also required six stitches at halftime to close a gash on his elbow. Some players wondered if he could even play in the second half. [...] "Taylor isn't human," [...] said Huff. [...] "No human being could have taken the punishment he got today." [...] Taylor described the contest in the locker room after the game, saying, [...] "I never took a worse <b>beating</b> <b>on</b> a football field. The Giants hit me hard, and then I hit the ground hard. I got it both ways. This was the toughest game I've ever played ... I just rammed it down their throats by letting my running do my talking. They couldn't rattle me ... I think Huff hit me with his elbow after a tackle. Anyway, I cut my tongue of all things." [...] Additionally, Taylor was playing while sick; two weeks later, he learned he had hepatitis, which contributed to his 15-pound weight loss prior to the game.|$|E
