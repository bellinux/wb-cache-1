And the manager harangued the {{servants}}, and the servants harangued one another, and everybody talked at the same time; and father and I promised not to tell a soul; so Lady Julia doesn't know a word about it to this day. And I don't see why she ever should--though, one of these days, I've a good mind to tell Lord Dreever. Think what a hold he would have over them! They'd never be able to bully him again." ...|$|E
60|$|Few {{would have}} thought that the death of a quiet lad of {{seventeen}} would have been so widely felt, so sincerely mourned; but virtue, like sunshine, works its own sweet miracles, and when it was known that never again would the bright face be seen in the village streets, the cheery voice heard, the loving heart felt in any of the little acts which so endeared Ed Devlin to those about him, it seemed as if young and old grieved alike for so much promise cut off in its spring-time. This was proved at the funeral, for, though it took place at the <b>busy</b> <b>hour</b> of a busy day, men left their affairs, women their households, young people their studies and their play, and gave an hour to show their affection, respect, and sympathy for those who had lost so much.|$|E

He rose from the pile of morning's letters to which he had but just sat down; he placed them the easiest chairs; he made a feint of its not being a <b>busy</b> <b>hour</b> with him, and would have had them look upon his office, which was still damp and odorous from the porter's broom, as a kind of down-town parlor; but after they had briefly accounted to his amazement for their appearance then and there, and Isabel had boasted of the original fashion in which they had that morning seen New York, they took pity on him, and bade him adieu till evening.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>busy</b> <b>hour</b> is {{determined}} by fitting a horizontal line segment equivalent to one hour under the traffic load curve about the peak load point. If the service time interval is less than 60 minutes, the <b>busy</b> <b>hour</b> is the 60-minute interval that contains the service timer interval. In cases where more than one <b>busy</b> <b>hour</b> occurs in a 24-hour period, i.e., when [...] occurs, the <b>busy</b> <b>hour</b> or hours most applicable to the particular situation are used.|$|E
50|$|The {{practical}} {{measurement of}} traffic is typically based on continuous observations over several days or weeks, {{during which the}} instantaneous traffic is recorded at regular, short intervals (such as every few seconds). These measurements are then used to calculate a single result, most commonly the <b>busy</b> <b>hour</b> traffic (in erlangs). This is {{the average number of}} concurrent calls during a given one-hour period of the day, where that period is selected to give the highest result. (This result is called the time-consistent <b>busy</b> <b>hour</b> traffic). An alternative is to calculate a <b>busy</b> <b>hour</b> traffic value separately for each day (which may correspond to slightly different times each day) and take the average of these values. This generally gives a slightly higher value than the time-consistent <b>busy</b> <b>hour</b> value.|$|E

30|$|The {{proposed}} {{method has}} been validated {{in a live}} LTE network. The considered urban area is {{a section of the}} whole network, consisting of 120 LTE cells that are located in the same area as all the 3 G cells of a particular Radio Network Controller (RNC); thus, LTE and 3 G coverage areas are overlapped. The trial was carried out during the <b>busy</b> <b>hours</b> to analyze the coverage of the network. In particular, the cell-level indicators were stored at hourly bases while the user-level indicators were stored every 15 min during the <b>busy</b> <b>hours</b> and subsequently aggregated at hour level. Given that this method aims to identify coverage problems which are permanent over time, cells can be monitoring at any time period. However, the ATOL average metric is estimated based on the group of users that actually performed an IRAT HO, which may be small. Thus, in order to ensure a good diagnosis, the tracing period should be long enough. This can be also achieved tracing the users during the <b>busy</b> <b>hours,</b> which provide more sample in a shorter time.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{statistical}} analysis of traffic in a deployed circuit-switched, trunked cellular wireless network used by public safety agencies. Prior analysis considered traffic from three <b>busy</b> <b>hours</b> during two days in 2001. Traffic data in this study span various time periods in 2001, 2002, and 2003. We examine the statistical distribution and autocorrelation function of call inter-arrival and call holding times during several <b>busy</b> <b>hours.</b> We find that call interarrival times are long-range dependent and may be modeled by both Weibull and gamma distributions. Call holding times follow the lognormal distribution and are uncorrelated. These findings indicate that traditional Erlang models for voice traffic may not be suitable for evaluating the performance of trunked radio networks. 1...|$|R
