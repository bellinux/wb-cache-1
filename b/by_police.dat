Arizona that an individual who was being held <b>by</b> <b>police</b> and was not free to leave had to be told of his/her right to remain silent. After Berghuis, a subsequent case, Salinas v.

It extended Berghuis by ruling that in such a situation and prior to any arrest, the individual was not required to be explicitly told about his/her right to remain silent under the Fifth Amendment.|$|E
