500|$|Jeff Kaplan has {{commented on}} her harassing {{gameplay}} style, noting that: [...] characters like Tracer and Genji ... {{who are really}} unique in how Overwatch is played, and sometimes the absolute right thing for Tracer to <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>is</b> to be off on her own, completely away from the objective or completely away from the team, harassing other players who are running back from the spawn. And she {{might not even be}} killing those players [...] She's a distracting, ambushing skirmisher. And that doesn't really fit in necessarily with objective time. [...] You can be the absolute MVP of the match when you're doing some of those things, and there's no way to really score it accurately.|$|E

We realize that {{we know a lot}} more today than we did 25 or 30 years ago. The NRC is saying that the dry cask storage at current sites would be safe for many decades, so that gives us time to figure out what we should do for a long-term strategy. We will be assembling a blue-ribbon panel to look at the issue. We're looking at reactors that have a high-energy neutron spectrum that can actually allow you to burn down the long-lived actinide waste. These are fast-neutron reactors. There's others: a resurgence of hybrid solutions of fusion fission where the fusion would impart not only energy, but again creates high-energy neutrons that can burn down the long-lived actinides. ...|$|E

"I {{think the}} fall in bank lending would have been worse had we not {{conducted}} our asset purchases because what we <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> injecting money into the economy and what the banking system has <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>is</b> destroying money. As they {{reduce the size of}} their balance sheet and deleverage, they are reducing not just the size of their assets but the size of their liabilities. Most of the money in our economy—broad money—comprises liabilities of banks in the form of bank deposits.

500|$|... "The War of the Simpsons" [...] is {{the twentieth}} episode of The Simpsons second season. It {{originally}} aired on the Fox {{network in the}} United States on May 2, 1991. In the episode, Homer gets drunk at a party and embarrasses his wife Marge, so she decides to sign them up for a marriage counseling retreat. Homer finds out that the retreat will be held near a lake and packs his fishing equipment, despite Marge telling him that all they will <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>is</b> resolving their differences. At the lake the next morning, Homer tries to sneak away to go fishing, but Marge catches him and he takes a walk instead. On the dock, Homer grabs hold of a fishing pole only to be yanked onto a small rowboat by the fish. When he notices an upset Marge is looking at him, he immediately lets the fish go to prove his love for her.|$|E
2500|$|Other reviewers {{found little}} to praise in the miniseries, however. [...] "Rose Red is a {{rambling}} wreck of a film...about as scary as a hangnail," [...] said the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. [...] "...It is made-for-TV pablum, meant to satisfy unsophisticated palates the way restaurants make ordinary food seem appetizing with highfalutin menus." [...] USA Today {{focused on what}} it felt was a poor story and slow pacing: [...] "...a numbingly predictable series of seen-it-before jolts...played at exceedingly slow speed." [...] Many critics were unimpressed with the special visual effects which others had found praiseworthy. [...] "Rose Red," [...] said the New York Daily News, [...] "...is a haunted-house story that's told so slowly, it's almost inert. The climactic special effects are even worse, guaranteeing that—should you last to the end—the only screaming you'll <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>is</b> with laughter." [...] Critic and academician Tony Magistrale felt the miniseries over-relied on special effects {{so much that it}} felt [...] "oppressive", concluding: ...|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "teach the controversy" [...] {{originated}} with Gerald Graff, {{a professor of}} English and education at the University of Illinois at Chicago, as an admonition to teach that established knowledge is not simply given as a settled matter, {{but that it is}} created in a crucible of debate and controversy. To the chagrin of Graff, who describes himself as a liberal secularist, the idea was later appropriated by Phillip E. Johnson, Discovery Institute program advisor and father of the ID movement. Discussing the 1999-2000 Kansas State Board of Education controversy over the teaching of intelligent design in public school classrooms, Johnson wrote [...] "What educators in Kansas and elsewhere should <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>is</b> to 'teach the controversy'." [...] In his book Johnson proposed casting the conflicting points of view and agendas as a scholarly controversy. Johnson's usage differs somewhat from Graff's original concept. While Graff advocated that a comprehensive understanding of what are considered to be [...] "established" [...] concepts must include teaching the debates and conflicts by which they were established, Johnson appropriated the phrase to cast doubt upon the very concept of established knowledge.|$|E
