40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{valuation}} of Internet-based businesses. In particular {{the influence of}} the implementation of an e-business strategy on the value of a business by focussing on its financial performance, will be determined. Although the valuation of businesses in general has been researched extensively, research on the valuation of Internet-based businesses produced contradictory findings. No consensus could be reached regarding the most appropriate valuation approach to be used. Some research findings indicated that the discounted cash flow approach was the most appropriate while others stipulated that a new valuation approach should be developed. Many authors state that the move to include an e-business strategy is natural, and that businesses cannot afford not to include some form of e-business strategy. Previous research has also shown that by including an e-business strategy, it is possible to improve efficiency of the business and ultimately increase profitability. However, there was no emphasis on how the e-business strategy will influence the business valuation. In order to establish whether an e-business strategy will create value for a business, an empirical investigation was undertaken. Based on the literature review, the primary objective of the study was formulated to determine and analyse the value of Internet-based businesses at the various stages of Internet presence, with the purpose of establishing whether value creation by implementing an e-business strategy took place. A positivistic research paradigm was adopted in the study to test 10 statistical relationships. A judgement sample of four businesses was drawn to be investigated. Based on the importance of the food retail industry, the food and drug retail industry (retailers and wholesalers subsector) as classified by the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) was selected. The businesses selected were Shoprite Holdings Limited, The SPAR Group Ltd, and Pick n Pay Stores Ltd. The well-known click-only business, Kalahari. net, is a subsidiary of Naspers and therefore Naspers Ltd (media industry, broadcasting and entertainment subsector) was included in the study. Based on a proposed e-business model as developed by the researcher, Shoprite was classified as a <b>brick-and-mortar</b> <b>business</b> with limited online presence, SPAR as a brick-and-click business with interactive online presence, PnP as a brick-and-click in the e-commerce stage, and Naspers as an online business in the e-commerce stage. To ensure reliability and validity of the data sources, method triangulation was used to calculate the FCFs that were required for the various valuations. Five valuations per year for each business from 2004 to 2011 were calculated. For the study, ten research hypotheses were formulated. Four research hypotheses focused on whether relationships exist between the changes in valuations of businesses at various stages of the e-business model over an eight-year period. Six research hypotheses were formulated to establish whether relationships exist between the valuations of businesses at different e-business model stages. The empirical results revealed that positive relationships exist between at least three of the five valuations of each business, except for Naspers (online business in the e-commerce stage). None of the relationships tested for Naspers (online business in the e-commerce stage) were statistically significant. It was also found that relationships do exist between the valuations of Shoprite (<b>brick-and-mortar</b> <b>business</b> with limited online presence) and SPAR (brick-and-click business with interactive online presence), Shoprite (<b>brick-and-mortar</b> <b>business</b> with limited online presence) and PnP (brick-and-click business in the e-commerce stage), and SPAR (brick-and-click business with interactive online presence) and PnP (brick-and-click business in the e-commerce stage). None of the relationships investigated between the valuations of Shoprite (<b>brick-and-mortar</b> <b>business</b> with limited online presence) and Naspers (online business in the e-commerce stage), SPAR (brick-and-click business with interactive online presence) and Naspers (online business in the e-commerce stage), and PnP (brick-and-click business in the e-commerce stage) and Naspers (online business in the e-commerce stage), existed. It was concluded that if a physical business (“brick”) adds an e-business strategy, it is possible to create value for the business over time, but only to a limited extent. Evidence also showed that converting to an online business in the e-commerce stage will not necessarily add value to the business. The research findings also showed that various valuation approaches should be used depending on the purpose of the valuation and the recipients of the valuation report. Based on the results, it was recommended that a new valuation approach should be developed for the exclusive use of online businesses valuation. To conclude, it may not be viable for brick-and-mortar or brick-and-click businesses to convert to online businesses in the e-commerce stage. Such conversions may not increase the value of the business when using the discounted cash flow approach in the valuation process. It might be viable for brick-and-mortar businesses and brick-and-click businesses to move up one stage in the e-business model, but such conversion decisions should be made after careful analysis. To conclude, the implementation of an e-business strategy only increase the value of some businesses and business managers should be mindful of this...|$|E

50|$|This term {{is usually}} used to {{contrast}} with a transitory business or an Internet-only presence, such as fully online shops, which have no physical presence for shoppers to visit, talk with staff in person, touch and handle products and buy {{from the firm}} in person.

Concerns such as foot traffic, storefront visibility, and appealing interior design apply to <b>brick-and-mortar</b> <b>businesses</b> rather than online ones.

40|$|Abstract: With the {{continued}} growing investment in WWW technologies by e-Commerce businesses {{the measurement of}} Information Systems (IS) effectiveness in this business sector has become increasingly important over the last decade.

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] This dissertation investigates network effects and the strategic reactions of firms in international markets. In particular, the reason of cross-country differences in software piracy rate and the strategic reaction of software producers are theoretically and empirically investigated. Five independent but interrelated research topics are included. First, income effect on critical mass and sustainable prices in the presence of network effects is studied theoretically. Second, how piracy changes critical mass and sustainable prices is investigated. Third, the existence of the direct income effect on the software piracy rate is empirically tested. Fourth, the nonlinear income inequality effect on software piracy is examined empirically. Fifth, the indirect network of the Internet effect on the software piracy rate is investigated theoretically. Our results imply that software producers can use online service as a piracy controlling tool.

40|$|Smart {{services}} have been proliferating {{over the last}} years, especially {{in the form of}} apps that help users to achieve a certain goal like increasing one's fitness. Smart services are delivered via an intelligent object that is able to collect and provide data about its surroundings, allowing for a continuous communication and interactive feedback with the customer without service employee intervention. As such, a possible drawback of these services is the lack of human¾human interactions, which are a potential source of trust and satisfaction in <b>brick-and-mortar</b> <b>businesses.</b> Hence, this research examines whether there is value in using an anthropomorphized helper (i. e., a digital assistant with human-like features) in a smart service. Drawing on the concept of anthropomorphism and on the warmth and competence model, we hypothesize that humanlike features in an app (visual presence of a digital helper, emotional support by a digital helper) induce perceived anthropomorphism, which in turn, fosters positive customer outcomes, mediated by perceptions of warmth. Two studies are conducted. Study 1 explores the role of other humans for goal achievement like maintaining or increasing one's fitness. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 37 people who engage regularly in fitness activities. Results show that other humans play important roles, through providing company (i. e., physical presence) and encouragement (i. e., emotional support). These findings justify that human-like helpers may be beneficial when using a smart fitness app. ¬¬¬Study 2 tests our hypotheses with a scenario-based experiment simulating the use of a step count app through photographic slides. We used a 2 x 2 x 2 design manipulating visual presence of a digital helper (depicting vs. not depicting a human-like digital fitness coach), emotional support by a digital helper (expressing or not expressing empathy and encouragement), and success¾failure (recommended 10, 000 steps per day achieved vs. not achieved). Results of mediation analyses support the proposed effects: visual presence of a human-like helper, emotional support by the helper  perceived anthropomorphism  perceived warmth  satisfaction with the app, persistence in goal achievement. These results hold both in the success and in the failure condition. This research makes three contributions to the service literature. First, we show that anthropomorphized helpers in smart services can possibly compensate for the lack of a real human in smart service usage. Second, we show that the different facets of anthropomorphism independently exert positive effects, with emotional support by the helper being more powerful than its human-like portrayal. Third, we explain perceived warmth as the theoretical anchor for these effects. Service practitioners learn how to add a human touch to smart services that originally rely on human¾machine interactions. ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MTech (Information Technology)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2007 With growing invesbnent in WWW {{technologies}} bye-Commerce businesses {{the measurement}} of Information Systems (IS) effectiveness in this area has become increasingly important over the last decade. As business users have become reliant on outsourced IS service providers {{for a wide range}} of services, the quality of service rendered by the latter is an important issue which impacts on IS effectiveness. Researchers have for many years recognised the importance of service quality as a measure of IS performance. Service quality measurement tools such as SERVQUAL from the marketing field, have been proven to be applicable to the IS domain. However, empirical studies in this regard are concentrated in the context of large, non- eCommerce organisations only. In South Africa, e-Commerce has been recognised as an important driver for growth in SMMEs. The literature suggests that IS service delivery to eCommerce businesses needs to be evaluated differently to that of traditional <b>brick-and-mortar</b> <b>businesses.</b> There is however a paucity of research regarding IS evaluation in e-Commerce environments, including that of the application of service quality principles. It is thus difficult for managers of IS service providers in this context to develop a complete picture of the effectiveness of the IS they deliver. Furthermore, because e-Commerce SMMEs are almost wholly reliant on these service providers for the supply of IS and support, their service expectations could be different from those in traditional businesses. The primary objective of this research was to investigate whether IS service quality criteria applied in large traditional businesses, are also applicable to SMME e-Commerce businesses. The applicability of a service quality measurement instrument, based on SERVQUAL, was tested in an ev Commerce SMME context. Specifically, this instrument measures the service quality expectations that e-Commerce SMMEs have of IS service providers. A SERVQUAL measurement scale from a recent MISQ paper was adapted and used to collect data concerning service quality expectations of e· Commerce SMMEs. Using a structured survey method, the research was delineated to e-Commerce enabled bed-and-breakfast and self-catering accommodation businesses in the Western Cape, South Africa. The research results indicate that, although SERVQUAL principles were applicable to the e-Commerce SMME context, the service quality dimensionality was different. There are four derived dimensions for service quality expectations of e-Commerce SMMEs in this research, viz., Credibility, Expertise, Availability and Supportiveness. A fifth dimension is the Tangibles dimension, which is retained from SERVQUAL. Furthermore the results indicate that the Credibility was the most important dimension in this research context, while the Tangibles dimension was the least important...|$|R
