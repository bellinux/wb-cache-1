2500|$|According to Doris Warner, {{who was in}} attendance, {{about halfway}} through the film {{she began to feel}} that {{something}} exceptional was taking place. Suddenly, Jolson's face appeared in <b>big</b> <b>close-up,</b> and said [...] "Wait a minute, wait a minute, you ain't heard nothing yet!" [...] Jolson's [...] "Wait a minute" [...] line prompted a loud, positive response from the audience, who were dumbfounded by seeing, hearing, someone speak on a film for the first time. So much so that the double-entendre was missed at first. Applause followed each of his songs. Excitement built, and when Jolson and Eugenie Besserer began their dialogue scene, [...] "the audience became hysterical." [...] After the show, the audience turned into a [...] "milling, battling, mob", in one journalist's description, chanting [...] "Jolson, Jolson, Jolson!" [...] Among those who reviewed the film, the critic who foresaw most clearly what it presaged for the future of cinema was Life magazine's Robert E. Sherwood. He described the spoken dialogue scene between Jolson and Besserer as [...] "fraught with tremendous significance.... I for one suddenly realized {{that the end of the}} silent drama is in sight".|$|E
50|$|In the 1970s, Dimitrijevic gained {{attention}} {{when he began}} his Casual Passer-by series. The work features very <b>big</b> <b>close-up</b> photographic portraits of everyday people that were hung on buildings and billboard in different cities in Europe and America. He {{then went on to}} produce memorial plaques in honour of other people that he met.|$|E
40|$|To train our {{probabilistic}} model, we {{have collected}} a data set comprising 80 manga pages from three chapters {{of three different}} series: “Bakuman”, “Vampire Knight ” and “Fruit Basket”. These manga series have distinctive composition complexities and patterns, in order for our dataset {{to be able to}} capture a wide range of composition styles used by manga artists. Annotation. We manually segmented and annotated all the pages in our dataset. Each page was segmented into a set of panels. For each panel, we first manually label its shot type (i. e., long, medium, close-up, or <b>big</b> <b>close-up)</b> and segmented the foreground subjects and their corresponding balloons. Given a set of segmented panels across all the pages, we then partitioned the panels into three groups with similar geometric features, which include aspect ratio (i. e., width/height) and size (i. e., area). The clustering was done using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM), initialized by k-means clustering. Grouping geometrically similar panels allows the probabilistic model to learn composition patterns that vary with the panel shape. Eye-tracking Data from Multiple Viewers. To understand how manga artists control viewer attention via composition of subjects and balloons, we have conducted a visual perception study to track the participants ’ eye movements as they read the manga pages in our dataset...|$|E
5000|$|About {{the look}} of the show {{director}} Don Coutts said [...] "We used <b>big</b> <b>close-ups,</b> pulled focus or used a panning system. The camera work was radical...The idea was to use very low light conditions, and an atmosphere {{that was supposed to be}} dark and moody". Coutts is still pleased with the way viewers could turn the television on and within seconds know that what they were watching couldn't be anything other than After Dark." ...|$|R
50|$|Don Coutts {{left school}} in 1967, and began {{work with the}} Simon Community before moving to London. Soon {{afterwards}} he was employed by Columbia Pictures as a clerk. Following work in Columbia's laboratories, {{he got a job}} in the studio's cutting rooms and worked on several films as an assistant film editor. Subsequently Coutts was employed by Anglia TV and BBC East as an assistant film editor. As director of After Dark, Coutts developed an innovative televisual language of <b>big</b> <b>close-ups,</b> pulled focus and a panning system that was new to British talk show programming.|$|R
5000|$|Rendered with {{computer}} animation in Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones and Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith, Yoda appeared in ways not previously possible, including {{his participation in}} elaborate fight scenes. In Revenge of the Sith, his face appears in several <b>big</b> <b>close-ups,</b> demanding highly detailed CGI work. His performance was deliberately designed {{to be consistent with}} the limitations of the puppet version, with some [...] "mistakes" [...] made such as the occasional ear-jiggling. Rob Coleman was responsible for the character's new incarnation to the series.|$|R
5000|$|Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel {{gave the}} film 2.5 out of 4 stars, stating, [...] "The {{dullness}} of the performances really stands out when somebody like Bryce Dallas Howard, or Anna Kendrick turn up and liven up their scenes." [...] While calling the film [...] "too chatty and too long", he did compliment David Slades directing {{and noted that}} the movie will please the fans. Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave the film 2 out of 5 stars, stating that David Slades pacing is [...] "everything like molasses running uphill". He also criticized the characters, the actors portraying them, the <b>big</b> <b>close-ups</b> of hand-held devices, and called Howard Shores score [...] "gunk". Wesley Morris from the Boston Globe stated, [...] "If the first two movies were [...] "get a room," [...] part three is [...] "get a therapist". He said {{the second and third}} film [...] "repeat that discovery Twilight without truly deepening it...the movies are interesting without ever being good." ...|$|R
50|$|This unique {{cartridge}} {{originated in}} Africa, accommodating harsh African conditions, and less efficient South African rifle powders. It has {{a broad spectrum}} of reloading options and is capable of long-range, flat trajectory shooting, or <b>close-up</b> <b>Big</b> Five hunting shots, using the heaviest of bullets available in this caliber.|$|R
5000|$|Andre Senwald of The New York Times {{writes in}} his movie review: [...] "Convinced that Hollywood is {{suffering}} from a drought rather than a plague of baby Bernhardts, Warner Brothers have imported a new one, Miss Sybil Jason, from South Africa. She performs all the triple-threat functions in [...] "Little Big Shot", including a couple of impersonations and a song and dance. An engaging infant, she suffers just now from a studied quality {{that may be the}} result of overdirection. In some of her <b>big</b> emotional <b>close-ups,</b> the bewildered little girl seems to be making a valiant effort to take advice from half a dozen assistant directors all at once. Then, too, there is the additional difficulty that her British accent makes many of her lines unintelligible." ...|$|R
