40|$|Abstract: The size, location, and {{topography}} of British Columbia encourage incursions of taxa {{that are more}} widespread and abundant elsewhere. The periphery {{of the range of}} at least 1400 taxa extends into British Columbia. Over 900 of these appear on the Red and <b>Blue</b> <b>Lists</b> prepared by the Conservation Data Centre. Conversely, less than half of British Columbia’s endemic taxa or taxa for which the province has significant global stewardship responsibility appear on the Red and <b>Blue</b> <b>Lists.</b> We examine why we conserve and list species, concluding that a primary scientific or practical reason is to sustain genetic variability. We consider two broad kinds of peripheral species—disjunct (geographically marginal) populations and politically peripheral (often ecological marginal) populations that straggle irregularly across provincial boundaries. We document the degree to which each enters provincial Red and <b>Blue</b> <b>Lists.</b> The Conservation Data Centre generates the Red and <b>Blue</b> <b>Lists</b> using seven ranking factors. These factors are correlated in a fashion that biases politically peripheral populations towards rankings of artificially high risk. Thus, the lists have little utility in guiding conservation priorities. Recovery plans for most politically peripheral species appear doomed to failure for sound biological reasons. We note alternative approaches to evaluating species for conservation action and recommend that conservation efforts for peripheral species be focused on disjunct populations, rather than politically peripheral populations...|$|R

40|$|Burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia) {{are declining}} {{throughout}} much of their range. They {{were placed on the}} Audubon Society 2 ̆ 7 s <b>Blue</b> <b>List</b> in 1971 and were listed as a Species of Special Concern in 1986. Little information exists on burrowing owl population sizes and causes of population declines appear to be mostly speculation. Although considerable research has been done on burrowing owls in the Western United States, relatively little is known of the burrowing owl population in the Great Plains. In the Great Plains, burrowing owls will nest in abandoned badger (Taxidea taxus) burrows but are most commonly associated with black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) towns. The burrowing owl-prairie dog association has not been well studied, and active prairie dog towns appear to be an important component of burrowing owl nesting ecology. Burrowing owls are present in the Great Plains from April through October of each year. In the Nebraska Panhandle, burrowing owls typically initiate nests in May. During this period, owls are extremely secretive and difficult to detect. Burrowing owls will often conspicuously line their nest chamber, tunnel, and burrow entrance with shredded cow dung, horse dung, and other material such as badger and coyote scat and corn cobs. This material, however, is not always obviously present and should not be used as a means of identifying all nests in an area. Once the chicks emerge from the nest burrow they will spread out and utilize several burrows in the area; during this period they are extremely vulnerable to fumigation. It is therefore, recommended that fumigation not be used as a means of prairie dog control during the months of May, June, and July. In prairie dog communities burrowing owls often nest in aggregations but appear to prefer a distance of 100 to 160 m between nest burrows. Abandoned prairie dog towns do not support as many nesting pairs of burrowing owls as active towns due to burrow deterioration. Over time abandoned towns will be of no use to burrowing owls. Lastly, preliminary data suggests birds nesting in larger prairie dog towns (3 ̆e 20 ha) have higher fledgling success...|$|E

40|$|Since {{research}} got underway at the German Maritime Museum in 1971, {{this institution}} has been publishing the research results (including numerous dissertations), primarily of external scientists, in its series Schriften des Deutschen Schiffahrtsmuseums. A closely interlocked relationship with external research was thus achieved and further intensified in 1975 by {{the establishment of}} the scientific editorial department and the publishing of the Deutsches Schiffahrtsarchiv. Written material concerning the exhibitions and the general museum work are conveyed to a broader public in the form of museum guides, brochures and the semi-annual journal Deutsche Schiffahrt, published by the endowment association. The series of scientific treatises, which has grown to comprise nearly sixty volumes, is produced according to high standards of quality. This circumstance and the annual publication of the scientific journal {{in the form of a}} yearbook since 1980 were essential factors leading to the inscription of the German Maritime Museum on the <b>Blue</b> <b>List</b> of institutions receiving joint federal and state funding, as well as to its status as a national museum and its excellent international reputation. In the 1990 s the museum’s publication programme was enhanced by a documentary series, in which above all first-hand reports from the realm of navigation are published at varying intervals. The editorial department, which now has a staff of three, also oversees publications appearing independently of the various museum series. All in all, the editorial activities have become continually more complex - with regard to contents and conception alike - in the course of the past thirty years, while being compelled to respond to increasingly rapid technical developments. Audio books are already being produced, for example, and the first online publications are presently in the preparation stage. The increasing technicalisation of production processes has led, however, to an enormous rise in production costs, taking place at a rate which cannot easily be compensated. In view of the fact that, in this day and age, the value of scientific work is often measured primarily according to its cost/benefit ratio, the editorial department has thus come under considerable financial pressure. What is more, it is confronted with new tasks, tasks of a kind that could never have been foreseen in 1971, when Detlev Ellmers provided the impulse for the publication of a regularly appearing scientific monograph series...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION The Niobrara Valley Preserve {{is located}} in north-central Nebraska and {{includes}} a variety of relatively undisturbed grassland, woodland, and wetland habitats. The diversity of habitats, {{in conjunction with the}} area 2 ̆ 7 s central geographic location near the 100 th meridian, results in a diverse avifauna with many species and subspecies occurring at or near the western, eastern, southern, or northern edge of their breeding ranges. Several pairs of sibling species and subspecies are found here within their narrow band of sympatry. The breeding list of the Preserve and environs includes at least 105 species (Brogie and Mossman 1983), several of which are rare or declining in Nebraska or nationwide. This paper describes the evidence of breeding for those species and subspecies considered significant {{on the basis of their}} rarity, critical population status, or marginal geographic occurrence. A few other species are discussed that are conspicuous in their absence or scarcity. Unless otherwise indicated, information on statewide and regional distribution and abundance is from Johnsgard (1979 a, 1979 b, 1980). The designations of statewide endangered, threatened, or special concern status are from the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission (1977) and Ross Lock (Neb. Game and Parks Comm., pers. comm. 1982). Additional information on national and regional status is indicated by reference to the American Birds <b>Blue</b> <b>List</b> for 1982 (Tate and Tate 1982). STUDY AREA AND METHODS The study area includes the 22, 000 ha Niobrara Valley Preserve, owned by The Nature Conservancy, and an additional 20, 000 ha of adjacent, privately owned land. The area extends 50 km along the Niobrara River in Cherry, Brown, and Keya Paha counties. Study area boundaries are described in Brogie and Mossman (1983). The river valley contains exposed sandbars, floodplain forest dominated by cottonwood (Populus deltoides) and green ash (Fraxinus pensylvanica), scattered oxbow marshes with species such as cattail (Typha latijolia), bulrush (Scirpus actus), and sandbar willow (Salix discolor), and eastern deciduous forest dominated by bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa), basswood (Tilia americana), green ash, and ironwood (Ostrya virginiana). White birch (Betula papyrijera) occurs in several spring branch canyons and north-facing slopes. Grazed sandhill prairie covers the flat to hilly uplands south of the river. The Crookston Table lies north of the river and supports grazed mixed grass prairie and cropland. Uplands on both sides of the river are dissected by canyons containing ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) - bur oak woodland and eastern deciduous forest. We surveyed for birds almost daily by foot, truck, and canoe during the period 4 April- 10 July 1982, and less frequently during the remainder of the summer. Records were also collected from other Preserve personnel and local residents. A complete summary of breeding records for all species is maintained at the Preserve headquarters. Common names of birds follow the recent supplement to the AOU checklist (American Ornithologists 2 ̆ 7 Union 1982) ...|$|E
50|$|Botanie Valley has a rich {{diversity}} of plant life owing {{in part to}} its location between the rainy Coastal Mountain Range and the dryer Interior Plateau. Occurrence of wildfires also turns forest lands into diverse flower meadows in the higher sub-alpine elevations. In 1978, {{in an attempt to}} preserve this diversity, the Province of British Columbia created the Skwaha Lake Ecological Reserve. The reserve contains four <b>blue</b> <b>listed</b> species, and two redlisted species, Nuttall's Sunflower and Oniongrass. Invasive species and climate change are named as threats to these species.|$|R
