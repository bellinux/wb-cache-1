5|$|The Rhodesian {{pursued the}} He111 over the Saltdal valley and, with three attacks from astern, set the bomber ablaze, forcing it to crash. Hull then downed a Junkers Ju52 {{transport}} plane and, after unsuccessfully chasing another He111, destroyed two more Ju52s. The transports had <b>been</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> {{the aid of}} the hard-pressed German forces fighting around Narvik; one was loaded with supplies, while the other two were carrying Fallschirmjäger paratroops. One of the latter aircraft successfully landed in German-held territory before burning out, allowing the crew and paratroopers aboard to exit safely, but the second spiralled out of control and crashed, killing eight German paratroopers. Hull then attacked another He111, which soon retreated, giving off smoke. Having used up all his ammunition, Hull returned to Bodø. In the space of about an hour, in a technologically-outdated aircraft and without assistance, he had destroyed four German planes and damaged a fifth.|$|E

This Isleño material relates {{not only to the}} Canary Islands, but also to several other regions of Spain and perhaps Portugal, as immigrants from these places have <b>been</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> Louisiana since the 19th century and mixing with the Isleño communities.|$|E
25|$|With his {{experience}} with the MCC, and his county success behind the stumps, Taylor had <b>been</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> the notice of England captain Ray Illingworth. Though Knott was incumbent, Illingworth rewarded Taylor's patience with a Test cap. Taylor made his Test debut against New Zealand at Christchurch on 25 February 1971. In an eight-wicket England victory, he took two catches and a stumping, but scored only four runs before being stumped by his opposite number. His quiet debut escaped any reference in Wisdens match report. He did not play another match on the tour, and would not play another Test for six more years.|$|E

25|$|Almost a {{third of}} all {{immigrants}} in the U.S. were born in Mexico, being the source of the greatest number of both authorized (20%) and unauthorized (56%) migrants who come to the U.S. every year. Since the early 1990s, Mexican immigrants are no longer concentrated in California, the Southwest, and Illinois, but have <b>been</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> new gateway states, including New York, North Carolina, Georgia, Nevada, and Washington, D.C., in increasing numbers. This phenomenon can be mainly attributed to poverty in Mexico, the growing demand for unskilled labor in the U.S., the existence of established family and community networks that allow migrants to arrive in the U.S. with people known to them.|$|E
25|$|During this period, Stieglitz became {{increasingly}} intrigued {{with a more}} modern visual aesthetics for photography. He became aware {{of what was going}} on in avant-garde painting and sculpture and found that pictorialism no longer represented the future – it was the past. He was influenced in part by painter Charles Sheeler and by photographer Paul Strand. In 1915, Strand, who had <b>been</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> see shows at 291 for many years, introduced Stieglitz to a new photographic vision that was embodied by the bold lines of everyday forms. Stieglitz was one of the first to see the beauty and grace of Strand's style, and he gave Strand a major exhibit at 291. He also devoted almost the entire last issue of Camera Work to his photographs.|$|E

Shortly after the request for more public funding, District asked Marriott to cut the cost of the {{facility}} by reducing the number of rooms to about 1,000. Marriott agreed to build only 1,150 rooms, and to scrap the underground ballroom and meeting space (saving an estimated $100 million). Marriott and the city also resolved their dispute over the room set-aside for convention business. This issue had <b>been</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> a conclusion since early 2007, when Mayor Fenty gave Marriott a take-it-or-leave-it offer to reserve 80 percent of the rooms for the convention center, so long as convention center business was booked three years in advance. Marriott agreed to the 80 percent set-aside in September.|$|E

He decided to pre-empt the broadcast, called a sudden news conference, and made a personal statement {{that over the past}} eighteen months he had <b>been</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> terms with a drinking problem, but had sought professional help. He told reporters that recent questions among his colleagues about his suitability as leader were {{partly as a result of}} the drinking problem but stated that he had been dry for the past two months and would be calling a leadership contest, in which he would stand, to resolve the issues surrounding his authority once and for all. It was later claimed that the source for ITN's story was his former press secretary turned ITV News correspondent, Daisy McAndrew.|$|E
500|$|Dunn {{trained and}} rode his first World Grand Championship {{on the bay}} {{stallion}} Dark Spirit's Rebel. In 1991, the horse placed third in the competition. In 1992, the horse and rider pair won at most of the shows they had entered, including the World Grand Championship at that year's Celebration. Dunn had been training for 42 years at the time, and was 74 years old, making him the oldest trainer ever to win the class. The competition was held {{in front of a}} record crowd of 28,000. [...] "Rebel" [...] was the favorite horse going into the competition, out of a field of 13, and the team of Dunn and the stallion was described by the Florence TimesDaily as the [...] "most popular team in Celebration history". Dunn said after the win, [...] "I've <b>been</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> the Celebration since 1950 and I've never seen anything like it. That made it twice as good. It's nice to know that I've got that many friends and supporters." [...] The following year, Dark Spirit's Rebel was retired from competition in a formal ceremony at the Celebration. Dunn's riding number, 1865, was also retired.|$|E

2500|$|Robert E. Kennedy explains, however, {{that the}} common {{argument}} of the mass emigration from Ireland being a [...] "flight from famine" [...] is not entirely correct: firstly, the Irish had <b>been</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> build canals in Great Britain since the 18th century, and once conditions were better emigration did not slow down. After the famine was over the four following years produced more emigrants than during the four years of the blight.

2500|$|On Williamburg's Southside, {{also known}} in Spanish as [...] "Los Sures", {{which is the}} area south of Grand Street, there exists a sizable Puerto Ricans and Dominican population. Puerto Ricans have <b>been</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> the area since the 1940s and the 1950s, and Dominicans came in the '70s and '80s. Many Puerto Ricans flocked to the area after World War II due to the {{proximity}} to jobs at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The neighborhood continues to have 27% Hispanic or Latino population, and Broadway near Graham Avenue is known as [...] "Avenue of Puerto Rico". Havemeyer Street is lined with Hispanic-owned 'bodegas' and barber shops. However, even though the Southside has the highest concentration of Hispanics in the neighborhood, this population is dispersed throughout all of Williamsburg even as north as the Williamsburg-Greenpoint border.|$|E
