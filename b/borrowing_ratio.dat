40|$|This {{research}} {{examined the}} borrowing behavior of unlisted private stand-alone manufacturing firms in India {{over the period}} 2006 - 07 to 2009 - 10 using balance sheet data. Findings suggest that total indebtedness is lower in unlisted manufacturing firms compared to their listed counterparts, and the difference is more pronounced in long-term <b>borrowing</b> <b>ratio</b> compared to short-term <b>borrowing</b> <b>ratio.</b> Unlisted manufacturing firms depend predominantly on banks for financing purposes in order to circumvent their inability to tap financial resources from capital markets, and they borrow predominantly on a secured basis. It seems collateralized borrowings enables these firms to overcome the problem of information opacity; asset tangibility enhances debt capacity in general and secured debt capacity in particular as the agency theory would suggest. This research does not provide any {{evidence to suggest that}} a close bank-firm relationship ease collateral requirements for unlisted firms, nor is there any evidence of the monitoring role of secured debt enhancing firm performance and hence profits. The ‘pecking order’ of financing as the asymmetric information theory of capital structure suggests, does not seem valid for unlisted firms; internal resource generating capacity only influences reliance on short-term funding, with no bearing on long term fund need. ...|$|E

A widely-held view—but one which has not found much support in previous studies of inventories— is that a key channel for monetary policy is through influencing inventory accumulation.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to analyze the factors determining the capital structure of Spanish small and medium-sized enterprises. This analysis is grounded on agency theory, pecking order theory, and the signaling approach. The following elements were taken into consideration: i) the quantitative variables of the enterprises, and ii) qualitative or strategic variables, finally providing an analysis of the explanatory power of the firms ’ reputation, the ownership and control structure, and the relationship between the SMEs and the finance company. A definition of the relationships which might be expected between the proposed variables and the total <b>borrowing</b> <b>ratio,</b> according to the conceptual framework under consideration was given as well. A survey of 410 Spanish SMEs was considered in the empirical analysis. Firstly, we divided the survey into groups, according to the debt-equity ratio, and the application of an ANOVA test, then we tested for significant differences in the variables for each group. Next, we established a model of hierarchical regression for an overall comparison of the hypotheses that the theoretical model provided. Among the most relevant results, we should highlight that the only proposed hypotheses to be tested were those referring to the variables: ‘number of finance companies’ and ‘existence of real covenants unrelated to the business’.

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} non linear impact of {{external}} debt on growth using a large panel data set of 93 developing countries over 1969 – 98. Results are generally robust across different econometric methodologies, regression specifications, and different debt indicators. For {{a country with}} average indebtedness, doubling the debt ratio would reduce annual per capita growth by between half and a full percentage point. The differential in per capita growth between countries with external indebtedness (in net present value) below 100 percent of exports and above 300 percent of exports {{seems to be in}} excess of 2 percent per annum. For countries that are to benefit from debt reduction under the current HIPC initiative, per capita growth might increase by 1 percentage point, unless constrained by other macroeconomic and structural economic distortions. Our findings also suggest that the average impact of debt becomes negative at about 160 – 170 percent of exports or 35 – 40 percent of GDP. The marginal impact of debt starts being negative at about half of these values. High debt appears to reduce growth mainly by lowering the efficiency of investment rather than its volume.

40|$|We {{study the}} size of fiscal {{multipliers}} {{in response to a}} government spending shock under different household leverage conditions in a general equilibrium setting with search and matching frictions. We allow for different levels of household indebtedness by changing the intensive margin of <b>borrowing</b> (loan-to-value <b>ratio),</b> as well as the extensive margin, defined as the number of borrowers over total population. The interaction between the consumption decisions of agents with limited access to credit and the process of wage bargaining and vacancy posting delivers two main results: (a) higher initial leverage makes it more likely to find output multipliers higher than one; and (b) a positive government expenditure shock always produces a positive multiplier for vacancies and employment. The latter result is in sharp contrast with models in which some households {{do not have access to}} the financial market (RoT consumers), in which the implied labor market responses to fiscal shocks are inconsistent with the empirical evidence. We also find that the impact on GDP of consolidations is lower when consumers have a more limited capacity to borrow, and that increasing government spending in an episode of intense private deleveraging can still generate positive and significant effects on consumption and output, although the fiscal output (employment) multiplier decreases (increases) with the intensity of the credit crunch. In the model with indebted impatient households we also observe that output (employment) multipliers decrease (increase) markedly with the degree of shock persistence and increase with the degree of price stickiness. fiscal multipliers, private leverage, labour market search...|$|R

40|$|Tax-effect {{accounting}} {{has been}} controversy since its origin in allocation {{has generally been}} adopted the subject in the 1940 s. Tax across the English speaking world, even though underlying basic issues have not been resolved. A {{review of the literature}} shows that issues such as: whether income tax is an expense; whether the provision for deferred income tax is a liability and whether the provision for future income tax benefit is an asset have not been resolved because of differing opinions as to what is an expense, liability or an asset. The development of a conceptual framework in Australia, which provides definitions of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, has provided an opportunity to reexamine some of the unresolved issues mentioned above. Since the conceptual framework, in SAC 4, defines an expense in terms of whether it increases a liability or reduces an asset the re-examination was directed at ascertaining whether the provision for deferred income tax satisfies the definition and recognition criteria for a liability. The results were inconclusive. However, it was possible to conclude that the provision for deferred income tax does not readily satisfy the criteria in SAC 4. An empirical investigation was then undertaken to ascertain whether selected user groups treat the provision for deferred income tax as a liability. The investigation surveyed investment houses, company secretaries, auditors and the parties to trust deeds. Evidence gathered suggest that investment houses and company secretaries treat the provision for deferred income tax all a liability. Auditors appear to regard the provision for income tax as a deferred credit; not a liability. No evidence was found that the parties to trust deeds treat the provision for deferred income tax In a systematic way.

40|$|Background Recent policy {{announcements}} in Canada and the United States may potentially {{affect the}} risk environment for HIV transmission among incarcerated {{injection drug users}} (IDU). We sought to evaluate {{the potential impact of}} incarceration on HIV risk behaviour among the IDU enrolled in a prospective cohort study. Methods We examined patterns of incarceration among 1247 IDU participants enrolled in a 6 -year prospective cohort study in Vancouver, Canada, and tested for potential associations between HIV risk behaviour and incarceration. Correlates of incarceration were identified using generalized estimating equations (GEE). Results At baseline, factors significantly associated with incarceration included daily injection heroin and injection cocaine use and inconsistent condom use with casual sexual partners. In a GEE analysis, factors independently associated with incarceration included: used syringe <b>borrowing</b> (adjusted odds <b>ratio</b> [AOR] 1. 36; [95 % CI: 1. 16 – 1. 60]), used syringe lending (AOR 1. 31; [95 % CI: 1. 12 – 1. 55]) and inconsistent condom use with casual sexual partners (AOR 1. 16; [1. 02 – 1. 33]). All variables P, 0. 05. Conclusion In our study, incarceration was independently associated with HIV transmission and acquisition behaviours. These findings suggest that increased rates of incarceration of IDU may be associated with increased HIV transmission among this group...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact on}} dividend payouts of internal and external monitoring measures instituted by companies to improve their corporate governance structures.   The study involves 120 selected Malaysian listed companies over a four-year period from 1996 to 1999. This period encompassed the 1997 / 98 Asian financial crisis which affected most countries in the Southeast Asian region including Malaysia. Due to the combination of cross-sectional and time-series data, panel data regression techniques were used to analyse performance of the firms using both fixed effects and random effects models. Using dividend payout as the dependent variable, it was established {{that the size of}} firm, gearing <b>ratio</b> (<b>borrowing)</b> and the proportion of non-executive directors on a company board significantly influenced the dividend payout of firms. The impact of size on dividend payout of firms followed a quadratic fashion with payout increasing with the size of the firm up to the optimal size of around 11, 321 million ringgit, in terms of turnover. Beyond that, firm’s dividend payout declined with increasing size. The study also found that company borrowing had a negative effect on dividend payout. Finally, increasing the proportion of non-executive directors in a firm could lead to a decrease in dividend payout...|$|R
40|$|It {{is common}} {{knowledge}} that any two #rms in the economy are correlated. Even #rms belonging to di#erent sectors of an industry may be correlated because of "indirect" correlations. How can we analyze and understand these correlations? This article reviews recent results regarding cross-correlations between stocks. Speci#cally, we use methods of random matrix theory (RMT), which originated from the {{need to understand the}} interactions between the constituent elements of complex interacting systems, to analyze the cross-correlation matrix C of returns. We analyze 30 -min returns of the largest 1000 US stocks for the 2 -year period 1994 [...] 1995. We #nd that the statistics of approximately 20 of the largest eigenvalues (2 %) show deviations from the predictions of RMT. To test {{that the rest of the}} eigenvalues are genuinely random, we test for universal properties such as eigenvalue spacings and eigenvalue correlations, and demonstrate that C shares universal properties with the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble of random matrices. The statistics of the eigenvectors of C con#rm the deviations of the largest few eigenvalues from the RMT prediction. We also #nd that these deviating eigenvectors are stable in time. In addition, we quantify the number of #rms that participate signi#cantly to an eigenvector using the concept of inverse participation <b>ratio,</b> <b>borrowed</b> from localization theory. c 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.

40|$|This is {{the first}} of the 4 {{discussion}} papers that, together with the Introduction and Summary paper (Miwa, 2010 c), comprise the report of my recent investigation: "A Study of Financing Behavior of Japanese Firms with Firm-Level Data from the Corporate Enterprise Quarterly Statistics - 1994 ~ 2009 ". A basic premise to most studies of Japanese financial phenomena has been the dominant role played by banks. Hoshi and Kashyap [2001, p. 310] wrote that banks "were the only game in town". Observers argue that this bank dominance continued even after the "financial liberalization" of the 1980 s, through which the largest firms obtained access to international capital market. Using firm-level financial data from the Hojin Kigyo Tokei Kiho (Corporate Enterprise Quarterly Statistics) of the Ministry of Finance, I find that the ratio of zero-short-term-borrowing firms is highest, 50 % in 1998 and two-thirds in 2008, among the smallest firms. I also find the average (short-term bank <b>borrowing)</b> /(total asset) <b>ratio</b> was lowest among these firms. Much the same phenomena characterize the patterns of long-term-borrowing ratio. Under the "zero-interest-rate, quantity easing" monetary policy, the low "bank dependence ratio" among firms fell further. Using annual financial data from Corporate Enterprise Annual Statistics since the 1960 s, I also show that even in the 1960 s the bank-dependence ratio was lower than commonly perceived. Since then, it has declined consistently. Those findings constitute a fundamental challenge to the conventional wisdom about the financial market and financial regulation in Japan. ...|$|R

As in 2001, growth was not only supported by robust consumer spending, reflecting large wage increases, but also by an increase in net external demand. Consumer price inflation fell to near zero in 2002, reflecting primarily the good harvests in 2001 / 02 and the resulting sharp drop in food prices. Low inflation was also supported by a tightening of fiscal policy and delays in increasing administered prices.

Therefore, it is an urgent that calculation method is a scientific, accurate and easy to operate. Based on the existing estimation methods, improvements used car residue ratio have been made. It considers the various factors that affect the second-hand cars residue <b>ratio,</b> <b>borrowed</b> ideas of AHP, and the use of MATLAB software for weight analysis, simplify complex the calculation process, so calculation of residue ratio is both scientific and simple, so that it is widely used. Determining Method of Used Car Residue Ratio Residue ratio is used to reflect index of degree of old and new vehicle, In other words, it indicates that the function of the used car or use the value of the ratio of new vehicle function or use value, therefore should consider the various factors influencing the price of a used car appraisal, so as to determine the scientific and reasonable used the new rate. The main factors influencing residue ratio vehicle technical performance, use fixed number of year, the vehicle's shape, mileage, resale value, use purposes, working conditions, maintenance condition, the original car manufacturing quality, accident experience and other factors. The purpose is to determine the scientific and reasonable used car residue ratio. The Determination of Based Residue Ratio. When calculating the base residue ratio to use fixed number of year as the basic parameters, through the use fixed number of year and provided coefficient of use fixed number of year to calculate the change of decreasing year by year. And the coefficients summation, then take a calculation formula to determine the based residue ratio of used car. Calculating formula for: % 10...|$|R
40|$|Fossil {{lacustrine}} sediments {{were found}} at about 15 m above sea level, directly above beach deposits dating from Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 11 on a tectonically stable coastline in Eleuthera (Bahamas). This new discovery brings further support to the hypothesis suggesting that a major collapse of polar ice sheets occurred during this interglacial period. Two stratigraphic sections (GW 1 /GW 2), including several carbonate units separated by paleosols, were logged near Glass Window (northern Eleuthera). Both sections comprise a basal unit made of cross-bedded, bio-peloidal limestone, including an early generation of fibrous rim cement of marine origin and a late phase of drusy calcite mosaic. A second unit displays well-defined planar bedding at both sites, whereas faint trough cross-stratifications are also visible at GW 1. It consists of a bio-peloidal grainstone containing Halimeda fragments and lithoclasts derived from the underlying unit, and is further characterized by an early generation of isopachous fibrous cement. The upper part of this second unit shows one thick laminated crust with desiccation polygons and numerous spherulites of cyanobacterial origin, and is capped by a paleosol. The top of the GW 2 section is represented by a karstified oolitic/peloidal grainstone, not found at GW 1, whereas {{the upper part of}} GW 1 includes one bioclastic and one oolitic limestone unit separated by a paleosol. Based on sedimentary structures, petrographic composition, and amino-acid <b>ratios</b> <b>borrowed</b> from previous authors, the basal and upper units exposed at both sections can be identified as eolianites dating from MIS 11, 9, 7 and 5 e, respectively. Occurring between + 12 and + 14. 5 m, the basal part of the second unit can be interpreted as beach deposit, whereas its upper part, at + 15 m, likely corresponds to lacustrine or pond sediments, both dating from MIS 11. Considering the subsidence rate affecting Eleuthera, these beach and pond deposits, and the phreatic cements in the basal eolian units unavoidably imply a sea-level highstand at ca. 20 m during MIS 11. This exceptional event was probably caused by the collapse and melting of polar ice-sheets during this very warm climatic period. In the context of present-day global warming, a similar scenario could be repeated in the near future...|$|R
