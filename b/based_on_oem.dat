5000|$|Any LCD {{panel is}} by nature [...] "see through," [...] though {{conventional}} LCDs have relatively low transmission efficiency {{so that they}} tend to appear somewhat dark against natural light. Unlike LED see-through displays, LCD see-throughs do not produce their own light but only modulate ambient light. LCDs intended specifically for see-through displays are usually designed to have improved transmission efficiency. Small scale see-through LCDs have been commercially available for some time, but only recently have vendors begun to offer units with sizes comparable to LCD televisions and displays. Samsung released a specifically see-through designed 22-inch panel in 2011. As of 2016, they were being produced by Samsung, LG, and MMT, with a number of vendors offering products <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>OEM</b> systems from these manufacturers. An alternative approach to commercializing this technology is to offer conventional back-lit display systems without the back light system. LCD displays often also require removing a diffuser layer to adapt them for use as transparent displays.|$|E

30|$|Most {{widely used}} timing {{recovery}} schemes are Gardner algorithm [2] and band-edge algorithm, or known as Godard algorihtm, [3]. The band-edge algorithms has originated from the output energy maximization (OEM) of sampled received signals, i.e., finding timing phase maximizing {{the energy of}} the sampled signals. Since the sampled signals is mixed with inter-symbol-interference terms, the timing phase <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>OEM</b> is optimized for infinite length equalizers but not for a finite length equalizer. As we will show in this article, Gardner algorithm also belongs to this OEM category and, consequently, cannot produce optimized timing offset for a finite length equalizer. In general, it is difficult and costly task to optimize timing phase for a given finite length equalizer: joint optimization of timing and equalization has inherent latency problem and often requires frequent training signals.|$|E
40|$|The Circular Pathfinder tool, which {{provides}} guidance to companies looking for appropriate circular design strategies, was developed <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>OEM</b> (original equipment manufacturer) case studies. Ease of use {{was one of the}} main requirements during development of the tool, resulting in a software-based guide that asks a maximum of ten product-related questions, after which it gives a recommendation for one or more specific circular design strategies. The advantage of a practice-based tool is that the practical relevance is, in all likelihood, high. The disadvantage, however, is the lack of scientific validation. This paper presents a literature review of the decision variables and heuristics of the Circular Pathfinder, with the aim to uncover any discrepancies between practice and literature. The main finding is that the focus on practical usefulness of the tool has led to excessive reduction of the complexity inherent in strategic circular design decisions. Recommendations for improving the Circular Pathfinder tool are given. Circular Product Desig...|$|E

It offers a data model and a common query language {{that are designed to}} support the combining of information from many different sources. It also offers tools for generating automatically the components that are needed to build systems for integrating information. In this paper we shall discuss the principal architectural features and their rationale. 1. Introduction In this first section we introduce the core concept of mediators, which the Tsimmis system implements. Section 2 discusses the components of Tsimmis, and Section 3 discusses the OEM data model used by Tsimmis. Section 4 introduces the mediator-specification language MSL, while in Section 5 we learn how it is used to generate mediators and other components automatically. Finally, in Section 6 we consider another language, LOREL, <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the <b>OEM</b> data model. It is the Tsimmis end-user's query language as well as [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Applications have an {{increasing}} need to manage semistructured data (such as data encoded in XML) along with conventional structured data. We extend the structured object database model ODMG and its query language OQL {{with the ability}} to handle semistructured data <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the <b>OEM</b> model and Lorel language, and we implement our extensions in a system called Ozone. In our approach, structured data may contain entry points to semistructured data, and vice-versa. The uni ed representation and querying of such &quot; data is the main contribution of our work. We retain strong typing and access to all properties of structured portions of the data while allowing exible navigation of semistructured data without requiring full knowledge of structure. Ozone also enhances both ODMG/OQL and OEM/Lorel by virtue of their combination. For instance, Ozone allows OEM semantics to be applied to ODMG data, thus supporting semistructured-style navigation of structured data. Ozone also enables ODMG views of OEM data, allowing standard ODMG applications to access semistructured data without losing the bene ts of structure. Ozone is implemented on top of the ODMGcompliant O 2 database system, and it fully supports our extensions to the ODMG model and OQL. ...|$|R
40|$|The SPS {{accelerator}} {{will be used}} as injector for the LHC and has to {{be adapted}} to the LHC requirements. The tight specification on beam blow-up and bunch spacing in the SPS has required an upgrade program of the SPS injection kicker in order to obtain a reduction of the magnetic field ripple to less than ± 0. 5 % and of the magnet current rise time to less than 145 ns. In this context, the slow control part has been entirely rebuilt on the basis of off-the-shelf industrial components. A hierarchical architecture <b>based</b> <b>on</b> a SIEMENS S 7 - 400 master programmable logic controller interconnected through PROFIBUS-DP to S 7 - 300 deported and decentralised I/Os has been implemented. Integration of in-house specific G- 64 hardware systems inside this industrial environment has been done through a PROFIBUS-DP to G- 64 intelligent interface <b>based</b> <b>on</b> an <b>OEM</b> fieldbus mezzanine board on one side and an FPGA implementing the required functionality on the other. Simultaneously, the fast timing system has been completely reshuffled in order to provide the required SPS multi-cycling functionality and a synchronisation of the 16 magnets to 5 ns. This modular architecture has been successfully integrated inside the new SPS accelerator control infrastructure and will be duplicated in the future for the control of the different SPS extraction channels. ...|$|R

5000|$|Microsoft {{historically}} {{engaged in}} licensing practices that discouraged {{the installation of}} non-Microsoft operating systems. Microsoft once assessed license fees <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the number of computers an OEM sold, regardless of whether a Windows license was included. Beginning in 1983, Microsoft sold MS-DOS licenses to <b>OEMs</b> <b>on</b> an individually-negotiated basis. The contracts required OEMs to purchase a number of MS-DOS licenses {{equal to or greater}} than the number of computers sold, with the result of zero marginal cost for OEMs to include MS-DOS. Installing an operating system other than MS-DOS would effectively require double payment of operating system royalties. Also, Microsoft penalized OEMs that installed alternative operating systems by making their license terms less favorable. Microsoft entered into a consent decree in 1994 that barred Microsoft from conditioning the availability of Windows licenses or varying their prices <b>based</b> <b>on</b> whether <b>OEMs</b> distributed other operating systems. [...] Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith said that the decree was effective in allowing Dell and HP to offer Linux computers, and Jeremy Reimer of Ars Technica stated that the decree made it [...] "fiscally realistic to sell computers with alternative operating systems". [...] In 1999, a Microsoft representative stated that their contracts with OEMs did not [...] "stop any OEM from shipping any operating system on their PCs". In 2010, Microsoft stated that its agreements with OEMs to distribute Windows are nonexclusive, and OEMs are free to distribute computers with a different operating system or without any operating system. [...] In a 2001 article in Byte, it was reported that license agreements between OEMs and Microsoft forbade OEMs from including Windows alongside another operating system on the same computer.

40|$|As {{aerospace}} Original Equipment Manufacturer's (OEM's) {{order backlogs}} soar to between six {{to ten years}} and growing, the community sees automation as vital to increasing throughput. Yet the community seems divided on the quantifiable financial benefits. While automation in aerospace assembly dates back to 1937, there is little substantive research on quantifying its business case. This thesis develops a financial model that predicts the benefit of introducing automation into an OEM's manual assembly line. The hypothesis of this project is that there is, in fact, a quantifiable benefit to implementing assembly automation into a current manual assembly process. <b>Based</b> <b>on</b> an initial automation capital investment, the financial model calculates the Net Present Value (NPV) of an aerospace automation project given various OEM production inputs such as: the annual production schedule, learning curve metrics, labor hour savings through automation, rework, health & safety metrics, and automation operating and downtime costs. A current program {{was used as a}} case study against the financial model. One significant finding is the effect production learning has on the labor hours saved from automation introduced in this thesis as the 'Efficiency Factor'. <b>Based</b> <b>on</b> the <b>OEM's</b> conservative production data and an initial automation investment of $ 12 M the NPV for the project is about $ 16 M for the firm order (600 ship sets) and about $ 27 M for the entire program (2000 ship sets). by Sean Michael Caetano.

During the 1990s, Orion was the exclusive supplier for Wal-Mart of discounted televisions, combos, and VHS VCRs under Orion and World brand names. In 2001, Orion teamed up with Toshiba for manufacturing smaller CRT/LCD televisions and DVD/VCR combos for the North American market for eight years until 2009. In 2011, Orion licensed the JVC name for televisions, and all JVC televisions are now designed, produced, and supported by Orion. Currently, Orion manufactures LCD/LED televisions and combo TVs for Hitachi and JVC, <b>based</b> <b>on</b> each company's <b>OEM</b> orders.
