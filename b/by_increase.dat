A {{delegation}} of New Englanders led <b>by</b> <b>Increase</b> Mather went to England {{to negotiate a}} return of the colonial charters that had been nullified during the Dominion years. The situation was particularly problematic for Plymouth Colony, as it had existed without a formal charter since its founding. Plymouth did not get their wish for a formal charter; instead, a new charter was issued, combining Plymouth Colony, Massachusetts Bay Colony, and other territories. The official date of the proclamation was October 17, 1691, ending the existence of Plymouth Colony, {{though it was not}} put into force until the arrival of the charter of the Province of Massachusetts Bay on May 14, 1692, carried by the new royal governor Sir William Phips. The last official meeting of the Plymouth General Court occurred on June 8, 1692.|$|E

After the defeat in the finals, club administration failed to operate on a higher level, and Partizan entered a long organizational crisis. All main players signed contracts with biggest Western clubs, and the promising generation was scattered. Milutin Šoškić went to 1. FC Köln, Milan Galić to Standard Liège, Vladica Kovačević to Nantes, Fahrudin Jusufi to Eintracht Frankfurt and Velibor Vasović, who had scored in the final, was transferred to Ajax where {{he would come to}} feature again in the European Cup. Thus followed a period of mediocre results, and for a decade not a single trophy was won. Few players remained from the previous generation, including Milan Damjanović, Blagoje Paunović and Borivoje Đorđević. In a short period of time, numerous managers were in position. The arrival of the talented young players Momčilo Vukotić, who came through Partizan's youth ranks, and Nenad Bjeković from Proleter Zrenjanin, announced better days for the Black & Whites.|$|E

2500|$|These {{changes were}} {{strongly}} opposed <b>by</b> <b>Increase</b> Mather, president of Harvard. The {{result was that}} Thomas Brattle and his associates built a new church in Boston in 1698. They invited Benjamin Colman, then in England, to become the pastor. Coleman was ordained by Presbyterians in England before leaving for America because {{it was assumed that}} the conservative churches of Boston would have opposed his ordination in New England. After arriving in November 1699, his manner of ordination was controversial given that it had not been done by the congregation he was to serve, as was Congregational practice. Brattle Street Church was organized on December 12, 1699, but without the support of the other churches in the colony. Despite the opposition of Mather and other conservatives, however, the church gained recognition and in time it became indistinguishable from other Congregational churches. By the 1730s, Colman was the leading evangelical pastor in Boston.|$|E

Whence, of two nations who have equal store, the more numerous is to be considered the richer, provided the type of the inhabitant be as high (for, though the relative bulk of their store be less, its relative efficiency, or the amount of effectual wealth, must be greater). But if the type of the population be deteriorated <b>by</b> <b>increase</b> of its numbers, we have evidence of poverty in its worst influence; and then, to determine whether the nation in its total may still be justifiably esteemed rich, we must set or weigh, the number of the poor against that of the rich.|$|E

For instance, it being one of the commonest advantages of being rich to entertain a number of servants, we have to inquire, on the one side, what economical process produced the riches of the master; and on the other, what economical process produced the poverty of the persons who serve him; and what advantages each, on his own side, derives from the result.|$|E

60|$|If {{all persons}} were to expend in {{personal}} indulgences {{all that they}} produce, and all the income that they receive from what is produced by others, capital could not increase.

If it were said, for instance, {{that the only way to}} accelerate the increase of capital is <b>by</b> <b>increase</b> of saving, the idea would probably be suggested of greater abstinence and increased privation. But it is obvious that whatever increases the productive power of labor, creates an additional fund to make savings from, and enables capital to be enlarged, not only without additional privation, but concurrently with an increase of personal consumption. Nevertheless, there is here an increase of saving, in the scientific sense. Though there is more consumed, there is also more spared. There is a greater excess of production over consumption. To consume less than is produced is saving; and that is the process by which capital is increased; not necessarily by consuming less, absolutely.|$|E
