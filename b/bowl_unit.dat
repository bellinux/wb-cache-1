50|$|A typical conical-cylindrical {{solid bowl}} {{centrifuge}} design contains a rotating <b>bowl</b> <b>unit</b> {{connected to a}} conveyor with a gear system. The gear system allows the rotating bowl and the conveyor to rotate at different speeds {{but in the same}} direction. Commonly, the conveyor operates at the speed between 1900 and 2400 rotation per minute, while the <b>bowl</b> <b>unit</b> operates at 100 rotation per minute higher.|$|E

2500|$|Pin Elevator – [...] brings pins upwards {{out of the}} lane's pit {{to the top of}} {{the unit}} for re-racking for {{successive}} frames, usually in the form of a vertically-oriented toroid-shape system at the extreme rear of the pinspotter for tenpin <b>bowling</b> <b>units,</b> to deliver pins upwards from the pit into the pin storage system.|$|R
25|$|Rahane {{played in}} the 2014–15 Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia. In the third Test match at Melbourne, Rahane made his third Test hundred. He made 399 runs in four, {{including}} a century and three half-centuries against the opposition attack of Mitchell Johnson and Ryan Harris, {{the core of a}} <b>bowling</b> <b>unit</b> that famously won 2013–14 Ashes series 5–0.|$|R

2500|$|In 1938, Sutcliffe scored 1,790 runs in all {{first-class}} matches at 41.62 with 5 {{centuries and}} a highest score of 142. [...] Despite several players {{taking part in}} the Test series, Yorkshire won a second successive County Championship title. [...] Sutcliffe, Leyland, Barber and Mitchell all scored more than 1,000 runs in the championship and Sellers made 999. [...] Verity, Bowes, Robinson and Smailes were a formidable <b>bowling</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|R
50|$|Success {{was based}} on a disciplined <b>bowling</b> <b>unit</b> of Miles Buesst, Nadeem Ahmed, Javed Iqbal, Tony Sanford and Dinesh Ekanayake, taking {{advantage}} of the low bounce of the wickets, and a large, slow outfield, backed up by good fielding, to starve batsmen of runs and force them into errors. Runs were at a premium on the two pitches used, and so batsmen had to be patient and correct to weather the initial storm of the opposition’s top bowlers, before making hay against the lesser bowlers. This approach was typified by Mike Soulsby’s masterly half century, off 63 balls, against Chile, that won him the Man of the Match award.|$|R
50|$|Mooney, a {{survivor}} of Ireland's disastrous 2001 ICC Trophy campaign in Canada (where his 4-17 against Bermuda emerged as a rare highlight of a catastrophic tour), featured in all six matches at the 2005 event, which Ireland hosted. An integral member of the formidable <b>bowling</b> <b>unit</b> which served Ireland so well, Mooney took eight wickets at 25.12 (including 3-10 against Uganda) as Ireland claimed the runners-up position and consequent qualification for the 2007 Cricket World Cup. Mooney has been named in the Irish squad which will challenge Pakistan, Zimbabwe, and the West Indian hosts in Group D of the competition. As of September 2006, he has appeared in one ODI against England.|$|R
2500|$|On {{the second}} day, Collingwood {{completed}} his century, falling for 129 when Durham were 229 for 4. The last six Durham wickets then added 57 {{to leave them}} with a lead of 115. Liam Plunkett, who had taken eight wickets {{in the first game}} but conceded 55 runs for no wicket in the first innings in this second game, then returned to knock out three top-order wickets. The rest of the <b>bowling</b> <b>unit</b> performed well, and Steve Harmison took a hat-trick on his way to five for 61. Harmison later said, [...] "The way I was feeling, my tail was up and I felt I could go through them. The position they were in I don’t think they were too keen to hang around. Before the last ball , I felt confident. It was a decent ball in a decent area and I was glad when he [...] chopped it on." ...|$|R

2500|$|A {{separate}} elevator {{next to the}} turntable transports {{the balls}} to the ball return system, which has a near-vertical ramp that the balls roll down to gain enough momentum to roll through either an above-lane or submerged trough back up the alley, entering the ball return rack next to the approach area where players can grab them. Bowl Mor pinsetters are stocked with 24 to 27 pins, and are deemed substantially more reliable than typical Ten-pin bowling pinsetters. Due to the playing rules of candlepin bowling allowing fallen [...] "dead wood" [...] pins {{to remain on the}} lane between each ball's roll, no provision has ever been made for [...] "spotting cells" [...] in a candlepin pinsetter's spotting table, simplifiying the machines' design. Most parts of the machine are driven by chains – especially the sweep board's drive system, on two L-shaped tracks {{on either side of the}} unit – or belts. A <b>Bowl</b> Mor <b>unit</b> weighs approximate , and draws 24 amperes at 110 volts from three-wire 110-220 volt service mains. The ICBA lists the cost of a refurbished <b>Bowl</b> Mor <b>unit</b> at approximately $5000.|$|R
5|$|Verity {{was born}} in Leeds and, from an early age, wished to play cricket for Yorkshire. After {{establishing}} a good reputation in local cricket, he signed a contract as a professional cricketer playing in the Lancashire League. His first season was not a success but, after moving clubs, he began {{to make a name}} for himself. Initially a medium-paced bowler, he switched to bowling spin in an attempt to secure a place in the Yorkshire team. When Wilfred Rhodes, the incumbent Yorkshire left-arm spinner, announced his retirement, Verity had a successful trial in the team in 1930, and led the national bowling averages. In 1931, his first full season, he achieved the rare feat of taking all 10 wickets in an innings, against Warwickshire County Cricket Club; the following year, he again took all 10 wickets, against Nottinghamshire, while conceding just 10 runs. The latter bowling figures remain a record in first-class cricket for the fewest runs conceded while taking all 10 wickets. He established himself as part of a strong <b>bowling</b> <b>unit,</b> which assisted Yorkshire to the County Championship seven times in his ten seasons with the club. In that time, Verity was never lower than fifth in the bowling averages and took over 150wickets in every year except his first.|$|R
25|$|England again changed opener {{for their}} series against South Africa, with Alex Hales opening and Moeen Ali moving {{back down the}} order. Nick Compton also {{returned}} to the side. England won the first game by 241 runs, after passing 300 in both innings, before a fit again Steven Finn helped bowl South Africa out for 174 in their second innings. After a high scoring second match, in which Ben Stokes and Jonny Bairstow both hit centuries, England won the third game of the series thanks to a superb bowling display from Stuart Broad. The victory gave England an unassailable 2–0 series lead with one game left to play. England lost {{the final game of}} the series after a batting collapse in the second innings. Despite winning the first two ODIs in convincing fashion, England lost the final three games of the series to lose the ODI series 3–2. However, Alex Hales' form with the bat was a major positive for England as was the emergence of Reece Topley in the <b>bowling</b> <b>unit.</b> England lost both of the T20 games they played to mean they ended the tour with five straight defeats. They were thrashed by nine wickets in the final game of the series, and their last game before the T20 World Cup, with England's seam bowlers being unable to cope with AB de Villiers, Quintin de Kock or Hashim Amla.|$|R

5000|$|On May 15, 2008 in {{the early}} evening, three youth broke into the vacant <b>bowling</b> alley <b>unit</b> at the mall. They started a fire, which led to police and fire {{evacuated}} the mall. An investigation was scheduled {{two to three days}} while engineers and city officials looked at the structural damage. The fire created $1 million worth of damage, particularly to Movie Experts, Shoppers Drug Mart and Brampton Home Furnishing. Eight stores were affected, and an underground delivery corridor's concrete ceiling dropped 6 to 8 inches. Firefighters had to search a [...] "maze of corridors" [...] in the basement, to ensure no one remained in the building. One of the youths involved was 17-year-old Richard Sloppick who was subsequently charged with arson. Power was turned off to all units except A&P and Coffee Time, and shut down traffic on Main Street. Shoppers Drug Mart set up a temporary facility for prescriptions, during the closure.|$|R

40|$|The {{traditional}} design methods normally demands long throughput times, {{more effort}} and high cost. Hence implementation of new efficient design strategies along with application to robotic assembly has become highly necessary. Hence an automated {{system should be}} designed that holds much greater promise for productivity improvement and cost reduction. Vibratory Feeders are extensively used for Automatic Feeding and Orienting. It {{is one of the}} most widely used feeding devices. This paper includes some literature collection on Automatic Assembly Transfer Systems along with the vibratory bowl feeder and its functioning. It also describes the mechanics of vibratory conveying and the design of a “vibratory bowl feeder feeding ball bearings”. The paper includes the individual part analysis of the vibratory bowl feeder such as the vibratory <b>bowl,</b> electromagnet, control <b>unit,</b> leaf spring, and base along with their design. Finally the assembled figure of vibratory bowl feeder is achieved along with some analysis. ...|$|R
50|$|On {{the field}} as either a player or coach during all 240 games of Dick Vermeil's career, Hairston first joined the legendary coach for a memorable run with the Rams. In Hairston's first year with the Rams, 1997, he {{assisted}} Leslie O'Neal to a ten-sack performance. He also coached a pair of players, Kevin Carter and Grant Wistrom, reach double digits in sacks (2000). One year earlier, when the Rams won Super <b>Bowl</b> XXXIV, his <b>unit</b> provided most of St. Louis' 57 sacks, which tied for the league lead. Carter's NFL-leading 17 sacks that year powered him to the Pro Bowl, where he joined his neighbor on the Rams line, D'Marco Farr.Under Hairston, Chiefs defensive end Jared Allen accumulated 20 sacks from 2004-2005, tied for tenth in the NFL during that period but first among players drafted in 2004, including 23 defensive linemen taken before him. Led by Allen's nine sacks as a rookie, the Chiefs finished 2004 with 41 sacks, seventh in the league.|$|R
50|$|Mushikamado, or movable Kamado-style cookers are {{now made}} {{from a variety of}} {{materials}} including high fire ceramics, refractory materials, double wall insulated steel, traditional terra cotta, and a mix of Portland cement and crushed lava rock. Outer surfaces also vary from a high gloss ceramic glaze, paint, a textured stucco-like surface and ceramic tiles. Modern ceramic and refractory materials decrease cracking - a common fault in the original Japanese design. Portland cement is still associated with cracking problems. In addition to the outer ceramic shell there is also a ceramic or stainless steel <b>bowl</b> inside the <b>unit</b> to hold charcoal. There is a draft opening in the lower side of the unit to provide air to the charcoal, as well as a controllable vent {{in the top of the}} dome lid for air to exit the cooker. Temperature is controlled by adjusting these two vents. One or more grids are suspended over the fire to provide the cooking surface(s) for the food. Finally, most Kamado-style cookers have a hole drilled in the lid to allow the insertion of the stem of a dial-type thermometer for monitoring the cooking temperature of the cooker. The high end kamados have layers of insulation which create low-airflow cooking conditions and are self-opening. Digital temperature control devices can be installed using a small blower to regulate airflow.|$|R
