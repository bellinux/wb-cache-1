50|$|Spicara maena, the <b>blotched</b> <b>picarel,</b> is {{a species}} of ray-finned fish native to the eastern Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea. The male grows to a maximum length of about 25 cm, and the female reaches 21 cm. This fish is fished commercially in some areas.|$|E
50|$|Spicara smaris {{grows to}} a maximum length of 20 cm but a more common maximum size is 15 cm. It is a more slender fish than the closely related <b>blotched</b> <b>picarel</b> (Spicara maena) and can be {{distinguished}} from that species by having 75-81 scales along the lateral line rather than 68-70. Its back is grey-brown and it has silvery flanks with a large black spot located above {{the tip of the}} pectoral fin. Male fish are usually larger than females and have small blue spots scattered across the dorsal and anal fins.|$|E
40|$|Determining bait type {{might be}} one of the most {{important}} factors that influence the amount and size of the fish catch in marine recreational fishery. To this end, the relationships between two types of natural bait and catch per unit effort (CPUE), yield per unit effort (YPUE), fish size and condition (K=W/TL 3) were evaluated in recreational fishery İzmir Bay (Middle Eastern Aegean Sea, Turkey). The most abundant angling species in Turkish coasts; annular sea bream (Diplodus annularis), <b>blotched</b> <b>picarel</b> (Spicara flexuosa), two banded sea bream (Diplodus vulgaris) and bogue (Boops boops) were collected by anglers between September 2006 – February 2007 with using baits; onyx (Solen vagina), and sardine (Sardina pilchardus). The average CPUE and YPUE of hooks baited with onyx were significantly higher than the bait sardine. Eventhough the averages of specimens caught with bait sardine were bigger than onyx except for bogue but, total length-frequency distributions were revealed some differences only for annular sea bream and <b>blotched</b> <b>picarel</b> between two baits. High conditioned individuals of bogue were caught with bait sardine and the rest of the other species with onyx...|$|E
40|$|The {{recognition}} and {{identification of the}} two species of Spicara genus (Spicara flexuosa, picarel and Spicara maena, <b>blotched</b> <b>picarel)</b> is difficult, due to a systematic confusion until now. In the present work a number of external morphometric features (ten body ratios) are evaluated for their diagnostic possibilities. According to Principal Component Analysis results, the body ratios head length to standard length, head height to head length and the ratios of two body heights, indicated that these characters were {{not related to the}} maturity stage of the species. The discriminant analysis based on the above body ratios, indicated rather high level of discrimination (83. 2 %) of the examined samples in two species. The results are discussed, and possibilities of improvement in the identification methodology for the two species are proposed...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out between May 1999 to April 2000 in Babadillimani Bight. A total of 1380 {{specimens}} were trawled by monthly sampling and examined. It was found that, age composition of <b>blotched</b> <b>picarel</b> varied from I to IV and they were composed of 78. 12 % females and 21. 88 % males. The measured mean total length and mean weight values for females, males and combined sexes were 9. 682. 36 cm- 11. 42 ± 8. 61 g, 13. 641. 40 cm- 29. 20 ± 9. 54 g and 10. 552. 74 cm- 15. 31 ± 11. 48 g respectively. In addition to this, the calculated length-weight relationships were W= 0. 0075 *L 3. 1397 for females, W= 0. 0093 *L 3. 0654 for males and W= 0. 0076 *L 3. 1374 for pooled data. The von Bertalanffy growth parameters were estimated for combined sexes were: L∞= 21. 72 cm, K= 0. 385 yr- 1 and to=- 0. 135 yr. According to monthly changes of Gonadosomatic Index and Fultons Condition Factor values spawning were occurred between March and May...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Growth and {{reproduction}} of the <b>blotched</b> <b>picarel,</b> Spicara maena (Linnaeus, 1758), were determined based on specimens (n = 2547) collected from the central Aegean Sea between July 2004 and June 2007. The samples consisted of 71. 9 % females, 16. 2 % males, and 11. 9 % immature individuals. The sex ratio of females to males was 1 : 0. 23. The length-weight relationship was W = 0. 011 L 3. 02, W = 0. 011 L 3. 00, and W = 0. 011 L 2. 99 for the combined sexes, females, and males, respectively. For all samples and both sexes the length-weight relationship showed isometric growth. The von Bertalanffy growth equation was fitted {{on the basis of}} mean length-at-age data, resulting in parameter values of L ∞ = 21. 99 cm, k = 0. 255 year- 1, and to =- 1. 165 year, and weight at infinity (W∞) was calculated as 123. 35 g. Length at first maturity was 8. 1 cm in males and 8. 5 cm in females. On the other hand, first reproduction length was 11. 51 cm and 13. 12 cm for females and males, respectively, both corresponding to 2 years of age. It was observed that spawning occurred between March and June...|$|E
40|$|Fishing {{trials were}} carried out with gill nets and trammel nets in the {{northern}} Aegean Sea from March 2004 to February 2005. Four different mesh sizes for the gill nets and the inner panel of trammel nets (16, 18, 20 and 22 mm bar length) were used. Selectivity parameters for the five most economically important species, bogue (Boops boops), annular sea bream (Diplodus annularis), striped red mullet (Mullus surmuletus), axillary sea bream (Pagellus acarne) and <b>blotched</b> <b>picarel</b> (Spicara maena), caught by the two gears were estimated. The SELECT method was used to estimate the selectivity parameters {{of a variety of}} models. Catch composition and catch proportion of several species were different in gill and trammel nets. The length frequency distributions of the species caught by the two gears were significantly different. The bi-modal model selectivity curve gave the best fit for gill net and trammel net data, and there was little difference between the modal lengths of these nets. However, a clear difference was found in catching efficiency. The highest catch rates were obtained with the trammel net. Given that many discard species and small fish are caught by gill nets and trammel nets with a mesh size of 16 mm, it is clear that these nets are not appropriate for fisheries. Consequently, the best mesh size for multispecies fisheries is 18 mm. This mesh size will considerably reduce the numbers of small sized individuals and discard species in the catch...|$|E
