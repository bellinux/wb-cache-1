5|$|Pescara {{was elected}} {{as the host}} city for the 2009 Mediterranean Games on 18 October 2003 in Almeria, Spain, {{defeating}} bids from Rijeka and Patras. The decision for the host city was made after the voting {{by members of the}} International Committee of Mediterranean Games, held in Almeria, host of the 2005 Mediterranean Games. Croatia's bidding city, Rijeka, was the first city to be eliminated, followed by Patras, Greece's <b>biding</b> city. This was the third time that any Italian city hosted this multi-sport event.|$|E
5|$|Local labour was {{supplied}} by an Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit (ANGAU) detachment, initially consisting of eight Australian Army officers and eleven native police. A {{week after the}} landing, 199 native labourers were brought in from Lae. Initially, the ANGAU detachment {{found it difficult to}} lure the frightened local people in from the bush, but as the word spread that there was food and safety to be had within the American perimeter, large numbers began to walk in. ANGAU established a native settlement in the <b>Biding</b> River area. By 13 February, 680 native labourers were at work. They constructed camps for the Americans, carried supplies to units in the mountains and brought back the wounded, and worked in the hospital. ANGAU also carried out patrols, providing intelligence on the Japanese positions.|$|E
5|$|The public stage ban 1642–60 {{imposed by}} the Puritan regime {{represents}} a long and sharp break in dramatic tradition, but was still never completely successful in suppressing the ideologically hateful make-believe of play-acting. Performances in grand private houses were not unusual, and could have quite elaborate sets, {{as can be seen}} from the extant drawings for the original performance of Davenant's opera The Siege of Rhodes (1656) at his home Rutland House. This was public theatre in all but name, as Davenant charged 5 shillings for admission. Some professional actors also managed to scrape a living and evade the authorities in stealth acting companies in London, such as that of Michael Mohun at the Red Bull Theatre. Professional writers from the previous era were growing middle-aged, <b>biding</b> their time, and hoping for the monarchy to be restored. By the later 1650s, it was becoming obvious that that time was at hand, and William Davenant, for example, stepped up his theatrical activities.|$|E

25|$|The Cold War {{emerged from}} a {{conflict}} between Stalin and U.S. President Harry Truman {{over the future of}} Eastern Europe during the Potsdam Conference in the summer of 1945. Russia had suffered three devastating Western onslaughts in the previous 150 years during the Napoleonic Wars, the First World War, and the Second World War, and Stalin's goal was to establish a buffer zone of states between Germany and the Soviet Union. Truman charged that Stalin had betrayed the Yalta agreement. With Eastern Europe under Red Army occupation, Stalin was also <b>biding</b> his time, as his own atomic bomb project was steadily and secretly progressing.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{official}} {{disapproval of}} Codrington {{had to be}} restrained because of the admiral's huge popularity with the public. The Admiralty's revenge took petty form, such as its refusal, despite repeated requests by Codrington, to pay his crews their traditional prize-money {{from the sale of}} captured Ottoman treasure and goods. Meanwhile, Wellington was <b>biding</b> his time until he felt it was politically safe to remove Codrington from the Mediterranean theatre. Finally, in June 1828, the Admiralty announced that Codrington was being relieved of his command (although he remained in acting-command until his replacement arrived in August). Although the King felt obliged by public opinion to grant Codrington the high honour of the Grand Cross of the Bath, the Admiralty's failure to give him another operational command in his remaining decade of service was eloquent testimony to his fall from favour.|$|E

25|$|There was no {{military}} {{resistance to the}} putsch; the regular troops in Berlin, Sicherheitspolizei, navy, the army commands of East-Prussia, Pomerania, Brandenburg and Silesia, formally accepted the new minister of defence and Reichskanzler. Admiral Adolf von Trotha, the navy commander, came out {{in support of the}} coup as soon as he learned of it. In Bavaria, the Reichswehr toppled the Social Democratic state government and replaced it with the right-wing regime of Gustav Ritter von Kahr. In the rest of the Reich, the commanders of the Wehrkreise did not declare for or against Kapp but were not neutral and most sympathised more or less openly with the putschists. The upper echelons of the bureaucracy were still dominated by those who had risen to their positions under the Empire and most were sympathetic to the coup, whilst remaining outwardly neutral and <b>biding</b> their time. In the eastern provinces, the bureaucracy fell in line behind Kapp and Lüttwitz.|$|E
25|$|This {{majority}} {{was furious}} {{with the new}} Governor. Besides despising him for switching parties and supporting the hated abolitionists, they thought he had virtually won {{his office at the}} point of a bayonet. The State House refused to allow Cannon the use of its facilities for his inauguration, and a joint committee of the General Assembly said his inaugural message was not only impertinent, but insolent in the extreme, entirely unbecoming a State Executive, especially one elected by “fraud and violence against the known wish of a majority of the citizens of Delaware.” Then the whole affair was repeated a year later, when federal troops supervised a special election to fill the seat of deceased U.S. Representative William Temple. This time the Democrats boycotted the election, but they were just <b>biding</b> their time. Finally, once again the elections of 1864 were supervised by federal troops, but this time the Democrats voted and swept the election. Without the veto, Cannon was powerless to accomplish anything with the General Assembly. As if to emphasize the point the General Assembly even rejected Cannon’s request to approve the Thirteenth Amendment, prohibiting slavery. This act had been approved by neighboring border state Maryland, but Delaware’s Democrats would refuse to pass this measure for another generation.|$|E

500|$|The {{council of}} the Grand Master decided that Poincy could {{continue}} to serve as governor, but they also made {{the former governor of}} New France, Charles de Montmagny, the [...] "proconsul general," [...] sending him to represent their interests on Saint Christopher.

[...] However, Poincy again resisted any outside interference; once Montmagny had returned to France, Poincy sent away the man left in his place.

500|$|After the French {{retreat from}} the Hegau into the Black Forest, Nauendorf took his force across the Rhine between Constance and Stein am Rhein on 22 May, and {{positioned}} himself at Steinegg. [...] After Friedrich, Freiherr von Hotze's column successfully pushed the French out of Winterthur on 26 May, Archduke Charles instructed Nauendorf to secure the village of Neftenbach, which effectively closed a semicircle around the French force at Zürich. [...] Once the Austrian main army united with its left wing, under Nauendorf, and its far left, under Hotze, Charles ordered the assault on Zürich. On 4June, Nauendorf helped to rout the French force at Battle of Zürich, commanding the Coalition's right wing; with sustained pressure on Andre Massena's force, Massena pulled his army across the Limmat river, and dug into positions on the low ring of hills there, <b>biding</b> his time until the propitious moment to retake the city, which he did in September, 1799, at the Second Battle of Zürich; Nauendorf was not present for this action, being with Archduke Charles on a march north, toward Mainz. In 1800, Nauendorf fought in the Austrian losses at Stockach and Engen on 3May, Mösskirch on 5May, and Biberach on 9May.|$|E
500|$|The {{international}} media reported that expectations {{for a successful}} summit were deliberately set low, because NATO leaders wanted to avoid a flare-up over the Iraq War. Therefore, they agreed to meet the modest goals the Alliance had already set for itself in trying to stabilize Afghanistan, and endorsed a tepid version of the Bush administration’s initiative to promote modernization and democracy in the Arab world. The newspaper further commented that the summit had [...] "a sort of [...] "Waiting for Godot" [...] quality about it — European leaders <b>biding</b> time, neither creating a crisis nor mending fences, {{in the hope that}} the American election in November will somehow spare them from the choice between having to deal with Bush and letting Iraq, and NATO, slide into further disarray." [...] Other analysis were even more critical: [...] "There have been NATO summits at which neither a special occasion was acknowledged nor decisions of particular relevance made. One example is the NATO summit in Istanbul in 2004, where the concluded measures hardly required a meeting of the heads of state and government, and the media presence was not justified by the agreed-upon resolutions." [...] US and other government officials however emphasized that the summit was significant in terms of the alliance's unprecedented outreach beyond its traditional North Atlantic focus and its aggressive emphasis on force planning to tackle new challenges worldwide.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} the direct numerical evaluation of singular integrals arising in Boundary Integral Equations for displacement (BIE) and displacement gradients (<b>BIDE),</b> and {{the formulation of}} a Traction Boundary Integral Equation (TBIE) for solving general elastostatic crack problems. Subject to certain continuity conditions concerning displacements and tractions at the source point, singular integrals in the BIE and the <b>BIDE</b> corresponding to coe¦cients of displacement and displacement gradients at the source point are shown to be of a form that allows application of StokesÕ theorem. All the singular integrals in 3 -D BIE and <b>BIDE</b> are reduced to non-singular line integrals, and those in 2 -D BIE and <b>BIDE</b> are evaluated in closed form. Remaining terms involve regular integrals, and no references to Cauchy or Hadamard principal values are required. Continuous isoparametric interpolations used on continuous elements local to the source point are modiÞed to include unique displacement gradients at the source point which are compatible with all local tractions. The resulting numerical <b>BIDE</b> is valid for source points located arbitrarily on the boundary, including corners, and a procedure is given for constructing a TBIE from the <b>BIDE.</b> Some example solutions obtained using the present numerical method for the TBIE in 2 -D and 3 -D are presented...|$|R

After 24 hours, Stewie asks for the money owed, but Brian {{says he does not}} have it and to give him until next Friday.
