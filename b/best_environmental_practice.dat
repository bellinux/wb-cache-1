50|$|In {{industrial}} countries, voluntary {{environmental agreements}} often provide {{a platform for}} companies to be recognized for moving beyond the minimum regulatory standards and thus support the development of <b>best</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>practice.</b> For instance, in India, Environment Improvement Trust (EIT) has been working for environment & forest protection since 1998. A group of Green Volunteers get a goal of Green India Clean India concept. CA Gajendra Kumar Jain a Chartered Accountant, {{is the founder of}} Environment Improvement Trust in Sojat city a small village of State of Rajasthan in India. In developing countries, such as throughout Latin America, these agreements are more commonly used to remedy significant levels of non-compliance with mandatory regulation.The challenges that exist with these agreements lie in establishing baseline data, targets, monitoring and reporting. Due to the difficulties inherent in evaluating effectiveness, their use is often questioned and, indeed, the whole environment may well be adversely affected as a result. The key advantage of their use in developing countries is that their use helps to build environmental management capacity.|$|E

30|$|Effective {{regulatory}} frameworks {{are needed}} to protect soils from further pollution input of POPs and other pollutants. Such a framework needs to regulate air emissions from industries and incinerators and should {{require the use of}} best available techniques and <b>best</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>practice</b> (BAT/BEP) for such facilities as stipulated by Article 5 of the Stockholm Convention. In addition, the amendment of soils with contaminated sludge, ashes or sediment needs to be avoided and restricted. To achieve such a protection, regulatory frames such as a regulation for fertilizer and other materials used for soil amendment is needed. The German fertilizer regulation includes limits for some POPs including PCDD/Fs, PCBs and PFOS. The limit for applying fertilizer to pasture land is 8  ng TEQ/kg dm for the sum of PCDD/Fs and PCBs [283].|$|E
30|$|The {{situation}} {{in developing countries}} is different. While PCDD/Fs are considered {{within the framework of}} the Stockholm Convention and PCDD/F inventories have been developed in most developing countries, the release of PCDD/Fs has not been reduced due to the lack of improved waste management measures as well as the lack of capacity and funding to implement best available techniques and <b>best</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>practice</b> (BAT/BEP) in industries. A range of updated PCDD/F inventories in developing countries even show an increase in PCDD/F release due to increased consumption and release in uncontrolled incineration processes such as open waste burning [291, 296]. In addition to landfill fires, waste is often burned in backyards and along streets where chicken, goats and cattle forage for food, leading to exposures. Large areas are at risk of becoming contaminated over time leading to exposure, similar to the Campania region in Italy [239].|$|E

A sample of cereal farms located in Apulia Region, in Southern Italy, was investigated through a survey questionnaire. Straw incorporation in the soil, straw burning and baling, were the three practices considered. In the light of the ever-growing demand of straw for energy feedstock production, we discussed two scenarios, namely the status quo and the demand pulled scenarios, each one with a different mix of the three straw end-practices. Following farmer's intentions, in the demand pulled scenario a high percentage of straw was baled while reducing straw incorporation; straw burning practice was not eliminated because it allows farmers to prepare the soil for cultivation. Sensitivity analysis tested different wheat and straw allocation methods (economic vs mass and cereal unit allocation). The environmental impact of alternative straw end-practices and scenarios was assessed by means of an attributional Life Cycle Assessment. Straw incorporation resulted the <b>best</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>practice.</b> Scenarios had quite similar impacts for 8 out of 11 impact categories, but the demand pulled scenario was less impacting than the status quo on global warming, human toxicity, and photochemical oxidation impact categories. These results allow us to conclude that the perspective of selling the straw on the local market for energy production is a better solution compared to the current situation...|$|E

The thesis shows how EIA principles and techniques are employed through the use of checklists and Leopold's matrices in the identification and analysis of impacts caused by underground railways in both their construction and operational phases. The results of the data collected during this research are analyzed and discussed. Recommendations are made for the use of EIA techniques in assessing and possibly mitigating the adverse environmental effects of underground railways...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe UK Water Industry {{currently}} generates approximately 800 GWh pa {{of electrical}} energy from sewage sludge. Traditionally energy recovery from sewage sludge features Anaerobic Digestion (AD) with biogas utilisation in {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) systems. However, {{the industry is}} evolving and a number of developments that extract more energy from sludge are either being implemented or are nearing full scale demonstration. This study compared five technology configurations: 1 – conventional AD with CHP, 2 – Thermal Hydrolysis Process (THP) AD with CHP, 3 – THP AD with bio-methane grid injection, 4 – THP AD with CHP followed by drying of digested sludge for solid fuel production, 5 – THP AD followed by drying, pyrolysis of the digested sludge and use of the both the biogas and the pyrolysis gas in a CHP. The economic and environmental Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) found that both the post AD drying options performed well but the option used to create a solid fuel to displace coal (configuration 4) was the most sustainable solution economically and environmentally, closely followed by the pyrolysis configuration (5). Application of THP improves the financial and environmental performance compared with conventional AD. Producing bio-methane for grid injection (configuration 3) is attractive financially but has the worst environmental impact of all the scenarios, suggesting that the current UK financial incentive policy for bio-methane is not driving <b>best</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>practice.</b> It is clear that new and improving processes and technologies are enabling significant opportunities for further energy recovery from sludge; LCA provides tools for determining the best overall options for particular situations and allows innovation resources and investment to be focused accordingly...|$|E
40|$|This {{series of}} {{technical}} papers arose {{out of the}} action by a private entrepreneur to initiate a process beyond mere regulatory compliance {{in order to achieve}} <b>best</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>practice</b> at proposed large new visitor gateways to Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. Because of the complexity of issues involved at such urbanized downstream sites, the range of topics covered is wide – though still only those considered at this juncture to be of management priority. Included on this platform is one introductory paper reviewing the history of environmental management in the field in Queensland, and three papers which seek to appreciate the main techniques by which government contributes to the solutions viz. through the national park, threatened species list, and environmental impact assessment. The history paper was designed to allow the present series to be considered in broad context as well as performance to date. The work emphasizes that much of the fertile land that must be sustained nowadays lies in the province of the private sector, and that the initiative to create any new cost-effective paradigm in ecologically-sustainable practices lies mostly in their hands. In all instances, this strategic approach to large-scale property planning is through ecological design – using field case studies around the immediate biophysical catchment of the development, with attendant focus on the associated legal catchment (the actual development site) and the social catchment (the effective land managers). The first of these has given rise to a document termed a Regional Landscape Strategy, its implementation planned in concert with an Environmental Impact Assessment of the site and with a Strategic Regional Initiative (still being tested in the field) for community engagement. The first document takes into account the aspirations of government as expressed in its broad-scale regional plans...|$|E

40|$|Focused {{fluid flow}} in marine sediments affects the {{evolution}} of sedimentary basins by altering the integrity of sealing caprocks and by transferring fluids as well as pressure. The formation of focused fluid conduits initiates, when the pore pressure within a reservoir exceeds the seal’s resistance against fracture or capillary failure. In seismic data, focused fluid conduits manifest as vertical zones of anomalous seismic amplitudes, which are known as seismic chimneys or pipes. The understanding of focused fluid flow manifestations is of great importance for hydrocarbon exploration because these structures may act as indicators for hydrocarbon reservoirs and sub-seafloor operations, as they may pose a hazard to drilling operations and influence the long-term efficiency sub-seabed storage of CO 2. The geological storage of CO 2 known as {{carbon capture and storage}} (CCS) is a key technology for the mitiga¬tion of climate sensitive greenhouse gas emissions recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Marine saline aquifers are a favorable storage option, because such systems have virtually infinite capacity, no influence on ground water production and bear the least conflict potential with the public. Howe¬ver, the success of CCS as a climate change mitigation technology depends on its public acceptance and builds on a reliable and transparent risk assessment, which is studied by the interdisciplinary, international ECO 2 project. The project’s main aims are to investigate the likelihood of leakage from marine CO 2 storage sites and its potential effect on marine ecosystems, to develop monitoring strategies, and to define <b>best</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>practice</b> guidelines for implementing and managing storage sites. Within this framework, my PhD thesis concentrates on the investigation of focused fluid conduits in the Sou¬thern Viking Graben and their implications for the Sleipner CO 2 storage project, where CO 2 is injected into a ~ 850 meter deep saline aquifer known as the Utsira Formation. My studies are based on the interpretation of 3 D and time-lapse 4 D seismic data covering more than 2000 km 2 of the Southern Viking Graben, numerical fluid flow simulation, and field geological observations. My thesis builds on {{a detailed description of the}} fluid flow system in the Sleipner area, which is characterized by the interplay between deep hydrocarbon reservoirs, the Utsira Formation and the overlying strata hosting various fluid flow features. The key elements of seal-bypassing fluid flow in the strata overlying the Utsira Formation are several hundreds of meters-wide chimney structures. The study area hosts at least 46 of these focused fluid conduits, which are categorized based on their seismic appearance into three types (A, B and C). Type-A-chimney shows similarities to “blowout pipes”, which are known from different sedimentary basins around the world and generally associated with rapid expulsion of fluids. Type B is very similar to large “gas chimney” structures, which have been identified above several leaking hydrocarbon reservoirs and which are interpreted as gas filled fracture networks crosscutting a low permeable seal. Type-C-chimneys cause seismic disturbances in bands of up to 6 km length and correlate with overlying tunnel valleys. The formation of focused fluid conduits requires high pore overpressure. The analysis of the Sleipner palaeo fluid flow system indicates that there may be a link between chimney formation and the last glacial cycle. Building on this, we present a novel hypothesis, which predicts that undrained fluid flow systems could pro¬duce significant overpressure as a result of the interplay between loading and unloading during a glacial cycle and resulting gas compression and sediment compaction. The closest chimney structures with a probable connection to the Utsira Formation are 7 km away from the Sleipner CO 2 injection point. We have evaluated the propensity of leakage along these structures by perfor¬ming numerical modeling of the CO 2 plume evolution with the multiphase fluid flow simulator DuMux. The simulations revealed that it is not likely that the modeled CO 2 plume will ever reach the chimney structures. Additionally, it is unlikely that the injection of CO 2 itself may cause the formation of chimney structures at Sleipner. Although seismic pipes and chimneys are very common features in seismic data and their interpretation as focused fluid flow conduits is well-established, only little is known about the underlying geological processes and how these link up with their seismic image. The comparison of field analogues of focused fluid conduits from the Colorado Plateau (USA) and seismic chimneys revealed that specific seismic signatures correlate well with certain field-based examples. The integration of field geological observations may help to improve seismic interpretations of chimney structures and fluid flow systems in general. The importance of focused fluid flow conduits for {{the evolution of}} sedimentary basins is not sufficiently addressed yet. The results of this thesis highlight the relevance of focused fluid flow conduits for long-term integrity of sub-seabed storage of CO 2 operations and that focused fluid flow conduits have to be considered for site selection of storage projects. A deeper understanding of focused fluid flow will help to understand the flux of fluids from the geosphere into the hydro- and atmosphere as well as geological and climatic processes of the past and future...|$|E
