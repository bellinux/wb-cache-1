25|$|On 20 September 2001, President <b>Bush</b> <b>told</b> a {{televised}} {{joint session of}} Congress and the American people that Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda network {{were responsible for the}} recent terrorist attacks on the United States. The refusal of the Taliban to comply resulted in the United States taking military action to achieve the president's demands, the action given the name Operation Enduring Freedom.|$|E

60|$|The bullet whistled so near Jim's {{nose that}} the young gentleman leaped back with a howl, and this outcry was {{sufficient}} to show Sam where to send another.

60|$|During {{the last}} {{portion of the}} journey, Jet dozed as he rode along, forcing himself to open his eyes {{now and then to}} make certain he was on the right course, and it was while he was thus in a semi-conscious {{condition}} that a shout from a clump of <b>bushes</b> <b>told</b> the tramp was nearly at an end.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ugh!" [...] exclaimed {{one of the}} savages, {{pointing}} {{across the}} open space. A slight swaying of the <b>bushes</b> <b>told</b> that some living thing was moving among them, and an instant later the huge frame of the leader came into view. The other outlaw, and Case, followed closely. Farther down {{the margin of the}} thicket the Indians appeared; but without the slightest noise or disturbance of the shrubbery.|$|R
500|$|Nine months later, on April 18, 2014, Bush {{spoke to}} Inquisitr {{regarding}} income inequality where she said next regarding Michelle Obama's income: [...] "I {{want to make}} sure that when she's working she's getting paid the same as men.

Shortly afterward, <b>Bush</b> <b>told</b> The Washington Post that she believed Obama was ready to leave the White House.|$|E
500|$|The {{length of}} time between album {{releases}} has led to rumours in the media concerning her health or appearance. In 2011 <b>Bush</b> <b>told</b> BBC Radio 4 {{that the amount of}} time between album releases is extremely stressful, noting: [...] "It's very frustrating the albums take as long as they do... I wish there weren't such big gaps between them". In the same interview Bush denied she was a perfectionist in the studio, saying: [...] "I think it's important that things are flawed... That's what makes a piece of art interesting sometimes – the bit that's wrong or the mistake you've made that's led onto an idea you wouldn't have had otherwise", and reiterated her prioritisation of her family life.|$|E
500|$|The {{opportunity}} for an equal partnership no longer existed, however, {{as shown in}} August 1942 when the British unsuccessfully demanded substantial control over the project while paying none of the costs. By 1943 {{the roles of the}} two countries had reversed from late 1941; in January Conant notified the British that they would no longer receive atomic information except in certain areas. While the British were shocked by the abrogation of the Churchill-Roosevelt agreement, head of the Canadian National Research Council C. J. Mackenzie was less surprised, writing [...] "I can't help feeling that the United Kingdom group [...] emphasizes the importance of their contribution as compared with the Americans." [...] As Conant and <b>Bush</b> <b>told</b> the British, the order came [...] "from the top".|$|E

60|$|Helen, {{pressing}} onward and upward, forgot {{time and}} danger, while she {{reveled in the}} wonder of the forestland. Birds and squirrels fled before her; whistling and wheezing of alarm, or heavy crashings in the <b>bushes,</b> <b>told</b> of frightened wild beasts. A dull, faint roar, like a distant wind, suggested tumbling waters. A single birch tree, gleaming white among the black trees, enlivened the gloomy forest. Patches of sunlight brightened the shade. Giant ferns, just tinging with autumn colors, waved tips of sculptured perfection. Most wonderful of all were the colored leaves, as they floated downward with a sad, gentle rustle.|$|R

[...] Bush went on to praise McElwain, saying [...] "Our country was captivated by an amazing story on the {{basketball}} court.

No one knows when Fidel Castro will move on. In my judgment, that's the work of the Almighty." [...] On August 2, Senator Robert Bennett (R-Utah) said President <b>Bush</b> <b>told</b> him the administration was surprised by the announcement of Castro's illness, [...] "The president's comment was that everybody was caught by surprise, and we'll {{have to wait and see}} what U.S. action is necessary.

50|$|In Midian, while Moses {{was keeping}} the flock {{of his father}} in law Jethro, the angel of the Lord {{appeared}} to Moses in a bush that burned but was not consumed (Exod 3:1-2).

2500|$|It {{expressed}} Bush's optimism towards {{winning the}} War on Terrorism, ushering in an ownership society and building an innovative economy {{to compete in}} the world. Bush was re-elected by a larger margin than in 2000, but won the smallest share ever of the popular vote for a reelected incumbent president.

50|$|The week Ingeborg {{spent in}} Manam {{was as close}} to a life in a {{tropical}} paradise as one can imagine. The natives killed a pig for her, took her heavy sail canoe to sea so that she could photograph, brought carvings and made new ones for her. She went with women to the <b>bush,</b> they <b>told</b> her about their love call devices, she bathed with them in one of their grass skirts.

25|$|By {{his second}} year in office, <b>Bush</b> was <b>told</b> by his {{economic}} advisors to stop dealing with the economy, as they believed {{that he had done}} everything necessary to ensure his reelection.

In September 1992, the Census Bureau reported that 14.2% of all Americans lived in poverty.

2500|$|Some Post–Cold War millenarians still {{identify}} Gog with Russia, {{but they}} now tend to stress its allies among Islamic nations, especially Iran. For the most fervent, the countdown to Armageddon {{began with the}} return of the Jews to Israel, followed quickly by further signs pointing to the nearness of the final battle—nuclear weapons, European integration, Israel's seizure of Jerusalem, and America's wars in Afghanistan and the Gulf. In the prelude to the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, President George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>told</b> Jacques Chirac, [...] "Gog and Magog are at work in the Middle East". [...] "This confrontation", he urged the French leader, [...] "is willed by God, who wants to use this conflict to erase His people's enemies before a new age begins". Chirac consulted a professor at the Faculty of Theology of the University of Lausanne to explain Bush's reference.|$|E

2500|$|On July 12, 2007, President Bush held a {{press conference}} and was asked about his {{commutation}} of Libby's prison sentence. <b>Bush</b> <b>told</b> reporters: First of all, the Scooter Libby decision was, I thought, a fair and balanced decision. Secondly, I haven't {{spent a lot of time}} talking about the testimony that people throughout my administration were forced to give as a result of the special prosecutor. I didn't ask them during the time and I haven't asked them since. I'm aware of the fact that perhaps somebody in the administration did disclose the name of that person, and I've often thought about what would have happened had that person come forth and said, I did it. Would we have had this, you know, endless hours of investigation and a lot of money being spent on this matter? But it's been a tough issue for a lot of people in the White House, and it's run its course and now we're going to move on." ...|$|E
