The presence of counter-rotating propeller improves total thrust and cancels out the torque. The aim {{of this paper is}} to employ a sensitivity study for the total thrust of a counterrotating propeller for UAV applications using computational fluid dynamics in hover condition. Two factors were investigated: propellers spacing and the difference between <b>blades</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>angle.</b> A counter-rotating propeller system was modeled in SolidWorks.

40|$|Discussed is Static Rotor Testing of the SR- 7 L Large Scale Advanced Prop-Fan (LAP). The LAP is an {{advanced}} 9 foot diameter, 8 bladed propeller {{designed and built}} by Hamilton Standard under contract to the NASA Lewis Research Center. The Prop-Fan employs thin swept blades to provide efficient propulsion at flight speeds up to Mach. 85. Static Testing was conducted on a 10, 000 HP whirl rig at Wright Patterson Air Force Base. The test objectives were to investigate the Prop-Fan static aerodynamic and structural dynamic performance, determine the blade steady state stressers and deflections and to measure steady and unsteady pressures on the SR- 7 L blade surface. The measured performance of the LAP correlated well with analytical predictions at <b>blade</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>angles</b> below 30 deg. A stall buffet phenomenon was observed at <b>blade</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>angles</b> above 30 deg.

50|$|In some aircraft, {{such as the}} C-130 Hercules, {{the pilot}} can {{manually}} override the constant-speed mechanism to reverse the <b>blade</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>angle,</b> and thus reverse {{the thrust of the}} engine (although the rotation of the engine itself does not reverse). This is used to help slow the plane down after landing in order to save wear on the brakes and tires, but in some cases also allows the aircraft to back up on its own - this is particularly useful for getting floatplanes out of confined docks. See also Thrust reversal.|$|E
50|$|A well-designed {{propeller}} typically has {{an efficiency}} of around 80% when {{operating in the}} best regime. The efficiency of the propeller {{is influenced by the}} angle of attack (α). This is defined as α = Φ - θ, where θ is the helix angle (the angle between the resultant relative velocity and the blade rotation direction) and Φ is the <b>blade</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>angle.</b> Very small pitch and helix angles give a good performance against resistance but provide little thrust, while larger angles have the opposite effect. The best helix angle is when the blade is acting as a wing producing much more lift than drag. Angle of attack is similar to advance ratio, for propellers.|$|E
5000|$|During {{testing the}} aircraft's {{cross-linked}} driveshaft {{proved to be}} its Achilles heel. The shaft resulted in excessive vibration and noise, resulting in a high pilot workload. Additionally, it proved susceptible to problems due to wing flexing. Shaft problems, along with operator errors, resulted {{in a number of}} hard landings causing damage. One crash occurred {{as a result of a}} failure of the driveshaft to the tail rotor, causing three fatalities. One of the limitations found in the aircraft was an instability between wing angles of 35 and 80 degrees, encountered at extremely low altitudes. There were also high side forces which resulted from yaw and weak propeller <b>blade</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>angle</b> controls.

The aim {{of this paper is}} to employ a sensitivity study for the total thrust of a ducted twin counter-rotating propeller system design for UAV applications using computational fluid dynamics. Two factors were investigated: propeller spacing and difference between <b>blades</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>angle.</b> Using 4 discrete values for both factors, 16 designs were analyzed and evaluated. The same approach was used for an equivalent unducted propeller system to assess the influence of the duct. A ducted twin counter-rotating propeller system was modeled in ANSYS CFX. Shear Stress Transport (SST) turbulence model was used for steady state simulations. An unstructured mesh with prism boundary layers was generated for the computational domains. It was found that the total thrust of both open and ducted counter-rotating propeller is highly dependent on the difference between <b>blade</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>angles</b> and propeller spacing.

40|$|The {{cycloidal}} blades {{system is}} a thrust propulsion system that consists of several blades rotating about a horizontal axis perpendicular to the direction of normal flight. In order to generate the thrust required, the <b>pitch</b> <b>angles</b> of the individual blades to the tangent of the circle of the blade’s path are varied by a pitch control mechanism installed in the cycloidal blades system so designed that the periodic oscillation of the blades about their span axis may be changed both in amplitude and in phase angle. Therefore, the cycloidal blades {{system is a}}ble to vector its high thrust anywhere within a 360 ° arc parallel to the propellers plane of rotation.

5000|$|In forward flight, {{there is}} no upward flow (upflow) of air in the hub area. As forward {{airspeed}} decreases and vertical descent rates increase, an upflow begins {{because there are no}} airfoil surfaces in the mast and blade grip area. As volume of upflow increases, the induced flow (air pulled or [...] "induced" [...] down through the rotor system) of the inner blade sections is overcome and the blades begin to stall near the hub. As the inner blade sections stall, a second set of vortices, similar to the rotor tip vortices, form {{in the center of the}} rotor system. The inner set of vortices decreases the amount of lift being produced and causes an increase in sink rate. In an accelerated condition, the inner and outer vortices begin to feed each other to the point where any increase in rotor <b>blade</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>angle</b> increases the interaction between the vortices and increases the rate of descent. In this state, the helicopter is operating in its own downwash, descending through descending air. The failure of a helicopter pilot to recognize and react to the condition can lead to high descent rates and impact with terrain.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTidal stream {{turbines}} offer {{a promising}} means of producing renewable energy at foreseeable times and of predictable quantity. However, the turbines {{may have to}} operate under wave-current conditions that cause high velocity fluctuations in the flow, leading to unsteady power output and structural loading and, potentially, to premature structural failure. Consequently, {{it is important to}} understand the effects that wave-induced velocities may have on tidal devices and how their design could be optimised to reduce the additional unsteady loading. This paper describes an experimental investigation into the performance of a scale-model three-bladed HATT (horizontal axis tidal stream turbine) operating under different wave-current combinations and it shows how changes in the <b>blade</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>angle</b> can reduce wave loading. Tests were carried out in the recirculating water channel at the University of Liverpool, with a paddle wavemaker installed upstream of the working section to induce surface waves travelling in the same direction as the current. Three wave conditions were employed in a current-dominated flow. The wave kinematics were measured using an acoustic Doppler velocimeter and there was generally good agreement with Stokes' second-order wave theory. Power and thrust measurements were taken under both current-alone and wave-current conditions for different blade pitch angles. It was observed that, as the <b>blade</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>angle</b> was increased from optimum, both the mean power and thrust on the turbine decreased and the reductions in thrust were always greater than in power. The fluctuations in power and thrust also decreased with an increase in the <b>blade</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>angle.</b> Therefore, changes in <b>blade</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>angle</b> can be used as a mechanism for reducing the loading on a HATT when operating with excessive wave-induced loads, while still enabling a significant amount of the available power in the unsteady tidal stream to be extracted...|$|E

The two-bladed, untwisted rotor was tested on a rigid test stand at tip speeds up to 101 m/sec. The rotor mode of interest is the lightly damped lead-lag mode. The dimensionless lead-lag frequency of the mode is approximately 1. 5 at the highest tip speed. The hub was designed to allow variation in precone, blade droop, pitch control stiffness, and <b>blade</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>angle.</b> Measurements of modal frequency and damping were obtained for several combinations of these hub parameters at several values of rotor speed. Steady blade bending moments were also measured.

The correlation between theory and experiment {{was found to be}} poor for the mid-to-high range of pitch angles where the theory substantially overpredicted the experimental lead-lag damping. The poor correlation in the mid-to-high <b>blade</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>angle</b> range is attributed to low Reynolds number nonlinear aerodynamics effects not included in the theory.

Flutter was observed at all blade pitch angles from small to large angles-of-attack of the blades. A strong blade response occurred, for four blades at the two-per-revolution (2 P) frequency, when the rotor speed was near the crossing of the flutter mode frequency and the 2 P order line.
