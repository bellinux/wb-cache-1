5000|$|Various {{segments}} {{appeared in}} episodes, usually {{just as a}} way to thread featured videos of a similar nature. One feature that appeared often was [...] "Quick Clips", which featured a number of quick video highlights of some amazing footage. Each episode of Daly's version had the [...] "Real TV Quiz", which generally featured video footage of a celebrity before they became famous, challenging the viewer to guess who they were during the commercial <b>break.</b> <b>Announcer</b> Beau Weaver announced the quiz {{at the start of the}} show's run before the quiz was taken over by Daly. During season 1, the quiz was before the second half of the show. The quiz moved to the end of the show at the start of season 2.|$|E
50|$|During the 1970s, WCVB-TV was {{the first}} {{television}} station in southern New England to run a 24-hour program schedule. The station ran a programming block from 1:00 to 5:00 a.m., branded as 5 All Night, which featured a library of older black-and-white movies and a few recent syndicated programs. During station <b>breaks,</b> <b>announcer</b> George Fennel (who never made an on-camera appearance during the block) would make live announcements and read fan mail from the viewing audience, as various 5 All Night logo backdrops were displayed on-screen. His actual first on-air portrait was displayed {{as part of a}} donation pledge drive for the Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon. The portrait had been covered from view and as the tally had reached a certain amount, a piece of the portrait would be revealed to the viewers until it was completely uncovered, revealing what Fennel looked like.|$|R
50|$|The 2010 season {{featured}} the rivalry between the Yankees and Red Sox being revived {{to start and}} end the season. The Yankees and the Red Sox started and finished the season against each other at Fenway Park. This {{was the first time}} since 1950 this had happened. In June, Joe Torre's Dodgers played games against the Yankees {{for the first time since}} he became manager of the Dodgers, with the Yankees taking two out of three games in the series. During the 2010 All-Star <b>break,</b> Pennsylvania <b>announcer</b> Bob Sheppard and principal owner George Steinbrenner died. Eight days later, another longtime Yankee icon, former player and manager Ralph Houk, died. The Yankees won the American League Wild Card. They swept the Minnesota Twins in the 2010 American League Division Series, but lost to the Texas Rangers in the 2010 American League Championship Series 4 games to 2.|$|R
2500|$|Another on-air mishap had Thomas {{reading a}} story about President Eisenhower's visit to Hershey, Pennsylvania [...] "where he was greeted by the folks who make {{chocolate}} bars, with and without nuts." [...] ("Nuts" [...] is a euphemism for [...] "testicles.") [...] As Thomas read the next story, {{he could hear the}} <b>announcer</b> <b>breaking</b> up with laughter in the New York City studio, which caused Thomas to break up, as well. [...] Air checks of some of Thomas' gaffes (as well as recreations of his [...] "bloopers") are available to collectors.|$|R
50|$|Just {{before the}} show took its final {{commercial}} <b>break,</b> the show's <b>announcer</b> would inform the audience of something related to the case, usually the opening date on which the perpetrator's trial would {{take place in the}} Los Angeles County Superior Court (this would be accompanied by an onscreen card so the viewer could read along). After the break the camera faded in for what was presumably the perpetrator's mug shot, consisting of him/her standing uncomfortably against the wall, while the results of the trial were announced. The perpetrator's name and fate were then superimposed over the screen, specifically regarding in what prison he/she was incarcerated, or, in the case of perpetrators deemed unfit to stand trial, to what state facility he/she was committed.|$|R
5000|$|A 1943 {{article in}} Radio Mirror {{magazine}} summarized Sharbutt's progress from local station WBAP to his then-current role at CBS:WBAP Del was a one-man radio station, singing, acting and announcing at $25 per week. After {{several years of}} working stations all over the Southwest, he ended up at $19 a week. Not satisfied with this progress in reverse, he went to Chicago and, after starving for two weeks, took a job singing in a Presbyterian Church. There he met a man who steered him into his first <b>break</b> as an <b>announcer</b> on Chicago's station WJJD. Del stuck at that {{for a year and}} a half, then came to New York. He arrived without a single contact and, three days later, beat out 50 competitors for an important job at CBS.|$|R
5000|$|To {{accompany}} the single the band released a music video {{which can be}} viewed as a parody of US participation in the Second World War. The video opens with a milk float approaching a row of British terraced houses. A man, dressed in suit and a cowboy hat, with a briefcase, walks down the path from the front door gesticulating and hollering. A paperboy and other working men approach along the pavement. A news <b>announcer</b> <b>breaks</b> in with an [...] "important announcement," [...] and the video cuts to a toy battleship sailing on a map table in an upper room of one of the houses. The man operating the ship is dressed in a military uniform, wearing a World War II type steel helmet and a French Foreign Legion jacket with large epaulettes. His uniform includes the 1st Foreign Regiment and 2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment wings insignia. The music begins.|$|R
5000|$|After an {{unsuccessful}} attempt {{to hire the}} German conductor, Wilhelm Furtwängler, the English conductor John Barbirolli and the Polish conductor Artur Rodziński were joint replacements for Toscanini in 1936. The following year Barbirolli was given the full conductorship, a post he held until the spring of 1941. In December, 1942, Bruno Walter was offered the music directorship, but declined, citing his age (he was 67 years old). In 1943, Rodziński, who had conducted the orchestra's centennial concert at Carnegie Hall in the preceding year, was appointed Musical Director. He had also conducted the Sunday afternoon radio broadcast when CBS listeners around the country heard the <b>announcer</b> <b>break</b> in on Arthur Rubinstein's performance of Brahms's Second Piano Concerto to update them about the attack on Pearl Harbor. (The initial word of the attack was forwarded by CBS News Correspondent John Charles Daly on his own show before the Philharmonic broadcast.) Soon after the United States entered World War II, Aaron Copland wrote A Lincoln Portrait for the Philharmonic {{at the request of}} conductor Andre Kostelanetz as a tribute to and expression of the [...] "magnificent spirit of our country." ...|$|R
