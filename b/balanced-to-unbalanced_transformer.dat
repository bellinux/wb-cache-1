40|$|Discrete {{solid-state}} high-power amplifiers {{are among}} the important circuit components in todayâ€™s wireless communications and remote-sensing applications. As the device technologies continue to improve, there are new opportunities and new challenges presented to power amplifier designers. This thesis presents novel techniques {{in the design and}} the analysis of L-band high-efficiency power amplifiers, which may be used in many communications and radar applications. In this work, high-efficiency power amplifier topologies are discussed and implemented. The goal is to push the boundary of output power, operating frequency, efficiency and bandwidth. Also, the design of a key passive component, a <b>balanced-to-unbalanced</b> <b>transformer</b> (balun) is discussed in detail. Some new designs of the baluns are shown, and the results show advantages of these baluns over some of the traditional work at L-band. The stability analysis of power amplifiers {{is one of the most}} critical and the most challenging aspects of power amplifier design. This work shows an analysis technique, which accurately predicts the oscillations in power amplifiers. Using the technique, different stabilization techniques and circuits are designed and implemented...|$|E
