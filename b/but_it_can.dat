5|$|Beagles may {{exhibit a}} {{behaviour}} known as reverse sneezing, {{in which they}} sound {{as if they are}} choking or gasping for breath, but are actually drawing air in through the mouth and nose. The exact cause of this behaviour is not known, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be a common occurrence and is not harmful to the dog.|$|E
5|$|Boron is {{necessary}} for plant growth, but an excess of boron is toxic to plants, and occurs particularly in acidic soil. It presents as a yellowing from the tip inwards of the oldest leaves and black spots in barley leaves, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be confused with other stresses such as magnesium deficiency in other plants.|$|E
5|$|Germanium is {{normally}} absent in diamond, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be introduced during the growth or by subsequent ion implantation. Germanium in diamond {{can be detected}} optically via the germanium-vacancy center, which has similar properties {{to those of the}} Si-vacancy center.|$|E

Magicka enables and is depleted {{by the use of}} spells; it is rejuvenated naturally over time, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> {{be restored}} similarly to health. Fatigue affects the character's effectiveness in combat and general efficiency, and can be alleviated by resting, potions, and spells.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, Amanita ceciliae is {{widespread}} everywhere, though infrequently encountered. It often inhabits deciduous forests with hornbeam (Carpinus), oak (Quercus), beech (Fagus) and birch (Betula), <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> also rarely occur with conifers: pine (Pinus), fir (Abies), spruce (Picea) and cedar (Cedrus). It has {{a preference for}} neutral to calcareous soils.|$|E
5|$|More recently, on the International Space Station, the Zvezda module {{includes}} a humidity control system. The water it collects is usually used {{to supply the}} Elektron system that electrolyses water into hydrogen and oxygen, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be used for drinking in an emergency.|$|E

5|$|Neutrons have no {{electrical}} charge {{and have a}} free mass of 1,839 times {{the mass of the}} electron, or , the heaviest of the three constituent particles, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be reduced by the nuclear binding energy. Neutrons and protons (collectively known as nucleons) have comparable dimensions—on the order of —although the 'surface' of these particles is not sharply defined. The neutron was discovered in 1932 by the English physicist James Chadwick.|$|E
5|$|Pain {{typically}} {{occurs when}} the stomach is empty, between meals {{and in the early}} morning hours, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> also occur at other times. Less common ulcer symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Bleeding can also occur; prolonged bleeding may cause anemia leading to weakness and fatigue. If bleeding is heavy, hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena may occur.|$|E
5|$|The Indian Princess {{certainly}} began a long American {{tradition of}} romanticizing and sexualizing Pocahontas, {{who was only}} a child in Smith’s original accounts. Therefore, it deserves recognition for inaugurating a genre, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be criticized for diminishing the potential richness of the subject matter.|$|E

5|$|Their diet {{consists}} {{primarily of}} small aquatic prey, such as insects and small fishes. Crayfish are its preferred food in most regions, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> adjust its diet {{according to the}} habitat and prey abundance. Its main foraging behavior is probing with its beak {{at the bottom of}} shallow water to feel for and capture its prey. It does not see the prey.|$|E
5|$|A {{complete}} explanation of mercury's extreme volatility delves {{deep into the}} realm of quantum physics, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be summarized as follows: mercury has a unique electron configuration where electrons fill up all the available 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 3d, 4s, 4p, 4d, 4f, 5s, 5p, 5d, and 6s subshells. Because this configuration strongly resists removal of an electron, mercury behaves similarly to noble gases, which form weak bonds and hence melt at low temperatures.|$|E
5|$|All of the Peano axioms {{except the}} ninth axiom (the {{induction}} axiom) are statements in first-order logic. The arithmetical operations of addition and multiplication {{and the order}} relation can also be defined using first-order axioms. The axiom of induction is in second-order, since it quantifies over predicates (equivalently, sets of natural numbers rather than natural numbers), <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> {{be transformed into a}} first-order axiom schema of induction. Such a schema includes one axiom per predicate definable in the first-order language of Peano arithmetic, making it weaker than the second-order axiom.|$|E

5|$|Athletes {{performances}} are timed or measured at virtually all {{track and field}} competitions. Doing so can not only serve {{as a way of}} determining the winner in an event, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> also be used for historical comparison (i.e. a record). A large variety of record types exist and men's and women's {{performances are}} recorded separately. The foremost types of records organise athlete's performances by the region they represent—beginning with national records, then continental records, up to the global or world record level. National governing bodies control the national record lists, the area associations organise their respective continental lists, and the IAAF ratifies world records.|$|E
5|$|B.brownii usually grows as {{an upright}} bush {{between one and}} three metres (3–10ft) high, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> also grow as an openly {{branched}} small tree to six metres (20ft) in sheltered gullies, or as a low, spreading shrub in exposed locations such as the peaks of the Stirling Range. The bark is a grey-brown colour, smooth and thin, with lenticels. The leaves are long and thin, from three to ten centimetres (1–5in) long, and five to ten millimetres (–in) wide. Dark green and hairless above but with a hairy white underside, they are easily recognised by their feather-like appearance, caused {{by the fact that}} they are finely divided almost back to the midrib, into as many as 70 thin tapered lobes.|$|E
5|$|Because {{its feet}} are located so far {{back on its}} body, the red-throated loon is quite clumsy walking on land, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> use its feet to shove itself forward on its breast. Young use this method of {{covering}} ground when moving from their breeding pools to larger bodies of water, including rivers and the sea. It is the only species of loon able to take off directly from land. If frightened, it may submerge until only its head or bill shows above {{the surface of the}} water.|$|E

5|$|Characteristic {{diagnostic}} {{features of}} Entoloma murrayi include the bright yellow coloring, the conical cap, cube-shaped spores, and club-shaped cheilocystidia. Entoloma quadratum {{is similar in}} size and morphology, but is colored salmon-orange. E.murrayi has the habit and form of some similarly colored mushrooms in the genus Hygrocybe (such as Hygrocybe marginata var. concolor), <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be readily distinguished from those by its salmon-pink spore print, non-waxy gills, and the angular shape of its spores. Entoloma luteum is a duller yellow color, with a less distinctly pointed umbo. The South American species E.dennisii, originally misidentified as E.murrayi, can be distinguished from the latter by its less conical cap and considerably smaller spores that measure 5.5–7μm.|$|E
5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} {{arc welding}} is {{most commonly used}} to weld stainless steel and nonferrous materials, such as aluminum and magnesium, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be applied to nearly all metals, with a notable exception being zinc and its alloys. Its applications involving carbon steels are limited not because of process restrictions, {{but because of the}} existence of more economical steel welding techniques, such as gas metal arc welding and shielded metal arc welding. Furthermore, GTAW can be performed in a variety of other-than-flat positions, depending on the skill of the welder and the materials being welded.|$|E
5|$|Inocybe maculata {{is similar}} to the {{variable}} Inocybe lacera, the split fibrecap, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> be differentiated by the darker colouration of the cap, and the white remains of the veil in the centre of the cap. The species is also similar in appearance to Inocybe lanatodisca, but can be readily distinguished by odour (I.lanatodisca has a characteristic sweet, green-corn smell) and the colour of the cap (I.lanatodisca has a fulvous cap). It is closely related to Inocybe fastigiata, but can again be distinguished by colour; I.fastigiata has lighter coloured fibrils.|$|E
