5|$|Christchurch, Turnham Green is {{an early}} Victorian Gothic {{building}} of flint with stone dressings. The {{main part of the}} <b>building,</b> <b>by</b> George Gilbert Scott and W. B. Moffat, is from 1843; the chancel and northeast chapel were added in 1887 by J. Brooks.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, the Old Maltings was {{categorised}} as a Grade II listed <b>building.</b> <b>By</b> 1990, {{most of the}} Fountain Head Brewery {{was dedicated}} to brewing Webster's and Wilsons ales. The brewery's bottling line was closed in 1991, resulting {{in the loss of}} 54 jobs.|$|E

5|$|The Abbey survived {{until the}} {{dissolution}} of the monasteries in 1539, and a house was subsequently built on the site. The remains have been designated as a Grade I listed <b>building</b> <b>by</b> English Heritage.|$|E
5|$|A {{library was}} {{operating}} from the wooden church <b>building</b> <b>by</b> 1860. Patronage {{of the library}} had declined markedly by the 20th century and by the 1930s it was virtually unused. A mobile library began calling in the 1960s {{and for a time}} called once per month. The bookmobile service was finally ended, for all places not only Whitemore, in 1998.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of McCreary's election, his wife Kate was the {{youngest}} first lady in the Commonwealth's history. Due to the near completion of an annex to the state capitol <b>building</b> <b>by</b> {{the time of}} McCreary's inauguration, {{he was able to}} move the official governor's office out of the governor's mansion, freeing his family from the intrusion of public business into their private quarters. McCreary's receipt of the executive journal and Great Seal of the Commonwealth from outgoing Governor Leslie in the mansion's office {{is believed to be the}} last official act performed by a governor there.|$|E
5|$|By 1508, {{construction}} work was completed {{at the north}} of the Loggia, which contained the staircase to access the upper level of the public building. The construction is designed as a body in itself, separated from the main <b>building</b> <b>by</b> a path and connected to it by a covered overpass, a configuration that has come down to us intact. The contribution of Cairano, who at that point returned to the Loggia after at least five years of a stellar career elsewhere, is the portal to the ground floor of the annex and in some ornamentation on the overpass.|$|E
5|$|El-Qantarah {{also saw}} heavy {{fighting}} as {{troops from the}} 18th Division engaged Israeli forces within and around the town. By early morning the division commander, Brigadier General Fuad 'Aziz Ghali, was able to set up his command post there. Close quarter combat and even hand-to-hand fighting took place as the Egyptians cleared the ghost town <b>building</b> <b>by</b> building. Fighting was intense, {{and by the end}} of October 7, the town and its outskirts as well as two nearby fortifications of the Bar Lev Line were under Egyptian control.|$|E

5|$|In the 17th century, {{the castle}} {{was no longer}} used as a {{defensive}} <b>building</b> <b>by</b> the Swedes who now ruled the Swedish Estonian Province. In {{the course of the}} Great Northern War in 1710, Estonia fell under Russian rule and the walls were partially demolished at the command of the Peter I of Russia, turning the castle in effect into ruins.|$|E
5|$|One {{method is}} to use the ground as a heat sink by drawing air through {{underground}} pipes. This is often done to provide a source of cool air for a <b>building</b> <b>by</b> means of a ground-coupled heat exchanger (also known as Earth tubes), wherein condensation is typically regarded as a significant problem. A major problem with such designs is that the underground tubes are subject to contamination and difficult to keep clean. Designs of this type require air to be drawn through the pipes by a fan, but the power required may be provided (or supplemented) by a wind turbine.|$|E
5|$|Other {{buildings}} of note in Caversham include the suburb's churches. The Presbyterian church {{is located on}} Thorn Street, roughly halfway between the South Road retail area and Forbury Corner. It was built in 1883 following {{the destruction of the}} previous <b>building</b> <b>by</b> fire. The current building, built in Port Chalmers bluestone with Oamaru stone facings, was designed by T. B. Cameron.|$|E

5|$|Paddy and Jacky Snowdon {{bought the}} {{property}} in 1988. They increased occupancy to seven flats, carried out alterations and achieved compliance with fire regulations. The Snowdons undertook renovations that were long overdue, and that were sympathetic to the historic significance of the <b>building.</b> <b>By</b> 2002, a conservation report had been completed.|$|E
5|$|St Chad's Church, the Anglican parish church, is in {{the centre}} of town, {{bordering}} the market place. It has been designated a Grade II* listed <b>building</b> <b>by</b> English Heritage. The current structure dates largely from the mid-18thcentury when the previous church was demolished, although the tower is from the 17thcentury. The church is constructed of stone and has a slate roof. A round Norman-style apse was added in 1868. The churchyard, mainly {{to the south and}} east of the building, is noted for its display of crocuses in the spring.|$|E
5|$|St. Lawrence's is a Palladian-style <b>building</b> <b>by</b> {{an unknown}} architect. Colen Campbell {{worked in a}} similar style, {{although}} he died in 1722, so the design may have been executed {{by one of his}} followers. The second-generation Palladian architect Henry Flitcroft has been suggested; by 1746 he was the master carpenter at three London palaces, and his St Giles in the Fields at Holborn was London's first Palladian-style church. James Gibbs has also been suggested, as the spire of St Lawrence's {{is similar to that of}} St Martin-in-the-Fields in the City of Westminster, London. Sir Howard Colvin tentatively attributes the church to Roger Morris.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} mural {{was completed}} on the Red Fox Vintage <b>building</b> <b>by</b> Heidi Schultz in November 2013. However, shortly after its completion, New Seasons announced {{the construction of}} a new grocery store next to the mural. The company offered to reproduce the painting on the east side of an adjacent building or the west side of the planned building. Dan Cohen and his assistant were hired to reproduce the mural, which was completed in October 2015.|$|E
5|$|With nearly 3,000telephone poles {{damaged or}} snapped and 32,000service outages, Southern Bell and AT quickly {{began work on}} {{restoring}} telephone service, sending workers from their centers in Atlanta and Jacksonville, respectively. The companies shipped about 225tons of copper wire and 20rail cars full of poles and switchboards. The Southern Bell office in Delray Beach was nearly destroyed, causing workers to move the service center to a nearby <b>building.</b> <b>By</b> the morning of September18, water service was restored in the central sections of West Palm Beach and was expected to expand {{to other areas of}} the city quickly.|$|E
5|$|A pair of towers {{stand on}} the river's edge a short {{distance}} on either side from the main building. They were originally two-storyed open-backed structures with gun platforms situated on their first floors, providing flanking fire down {{the line of the}} ditch around the castle's perimeter. They were later adapted for use as accommodation, with their backs closed with bricks and the towers increased in height to provide a third storey. Traces of the gun embrasures can still be seen {{at the point where the}} original roofline was. The South Tower was said to have been for the use of the castle's governor, though their lack of comfort meant that successive governors declined to live there. The two towers are linked to the main <b>building</b> <b>by</b> a crenallated curtain wall where additional cannon were emplaced in two embrasures on the north parapet and one on the south.|$|E
