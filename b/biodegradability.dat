5|$|Cyathus stercoreus {{has been}} {{investigated}} {{for its ability to}} break down lignin and cellulose in agricultural byproducts, like wheat straw or grasses. It selectively breaks down lignin, leaving much of the cellulose intact, which increases the amount of digestible carbohydrate for ruminant mammals, and enhances both its value as a food source and its <b>biodegradability.</b> The enzymes responsible, laccase and manganese peroxidase, also have industrial applications for lignin degradation and removal in the pulp and paper industry. Liquid cultures of C.stercoreus have also been shown to biodegrade the explosive compound 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT).|$|E
5|$|Maya stone {{sculpture}} {{emerged into}} {{the archaeological record}} as a fully developed tradition, suggesting {{that it may have}} evolved from a tradition of sculpting wood. Because of the <b>biodegradability</b> of wood, the corpus of Maya woodwork has almost entirely disappeared. The few wooden artefacts that have survived include three-dimensional sculptures, and hieroglyphic panels. Stone Maya stelae are widespread in city sites, often paired with low, circular stones referred to as altars in the literature. Stone sculpture also took other forms, such as the limestone relief panels at Palenque and Piedras Negras. At Yaxchilan, Dos Pilas, Copán, and other sites, stone stairways were decorated with sculpture. The hieroglyphic stairway at Copán comprises the longest surviving Maya hieroglyphic text, and consists of 2,200 individual glyphs.|$|E
25|$|Interest in {{environmental}} safety has brought up concerns about <b>biodegradability</b> in aminopolycarboxylates such as EDTA. For example, under the 28-day EN ISO 7827 test Austrian paper and pulp industries must use chelating agents that have biodegradation levels over 70% or 80% (after 28 days). An {{increased interest in}} safety {{has led to the}} development and research of alternative chelating ligands which can still bind strongly to metal ions but also have a higher <b>biodegradability</b> and a lower content of nitrogen.|$|E
25|$|Materials {{that have}} been used to make {{biologic}} tubes include blood vessels and skeletal muscles, while nonabsorbable and bioabsorbable synthetic tubes have been made from silicone and polyglycolide respectively. Tissue-engineered nerve guidance conduits are a combination of many elements: scaffold structure, scaffold material, cellular therapies, neurotrophic factors and biomimetic materials. The choice of which physical, chemical and biological cues to use is based on the properties of the nerve environment, which is critical in creating the most desirable environment for axon regeneration. The factors that control material selection include biocompatibility, <b>biodegradability,</b> mechanical integrity, controllability during nerve growth, implantation and sterilization.|$|E
25|$|<b>Biodegradability</b> (also {{known as}} biodegradation)--the {{ability to be}} {{disintegrated}} by biological approaches, including bacteria, fungi, and cells—is another significant property of biomaterials today. Biodegradable materials can minimize the pain of patients from surgeries, especially in tissue engineering, {{there is no need}} of surgery in order to remove the scaffold implanted. Wang et al. showed the in vivo degradation of silk via aqueous 3-D scaffolds implanted into Lewis rats. Enzymes are the means used to achieve degradation of silk in vitro. Protease XIV from Streptomyces griseus and α-chymotrypsin from bovine pancreases are the two popular enzymes for silk degradation. In addition, gamma-radiation, as well as cell metabolism, can also regulate the degradation of silk.|$|E
25|$|To {{achieve the}} goal of tissue reconstruction, {{scaffolds}} must meet some specific requirements. A high porosity and an adequate pore size are necessary to facilitate cell seeding and diffusion throughout the whole structure of both cells and nutrients. <b>Biodegradability</b> is often an essential factor since scaffolds should preferably be absorbed by the surrounding tissues without {{the necessity of a}} surgical removal. The rate at which degradation occurs has to coincide as much as possible with the rate of tissue formation: this means that while cells are fabricating their own natural matrix structure around themselves, the scaffold is able to provide structural integrity within the body and eventually it will break down leaving the newly formed tissue which will take over the mechanical load. Injectability is also important for clinical uses.|$|E
25|$|With 80–90% of {{oil spill}} costs {{invested}} in shoreline cleanup, {{there is a}} search for more efficient and cost-effective methods to extract oil spills from the shorelines. Biodiesel has displayed its capacity to significantly dissolve crude oil, depending on {{the source of the}} fatty acids. In a laboratory setting, oiled sediments that simulated polluted shorelines were sprayed with a single coat of biodiesel and exposed to simulated tides. Biodiesel is an effective solvent to oil due to its methyl ester component, which considerably lowers the viscosity of the crude oil. Additionally, it has a higher buoyancy than crude oil, which later aids in its removal. As a result, 80% of oil was removed from cobble and fine sand, 50% in coarse sand, and 30% in gravel. Once the oil is liberated from the shoreline, the oil-biodiesel mixture is manually removed from the water surface with skimmers. Any remaining mixture is easily broken down due to the high <b>biodegradability</b> of biodiesel, and the increased surface area exposure of the mixture.|$|E
2500|$|Alkanes also pose {{a threat}} to the environment. Branched alkanes have a lower <b>biodegradability</b> than {{unbranched}} alkanes. However, methane is ranked as the most dangerous greenhouse gas. Although the amount of methane in the atmosphere is low, it does {{pose a threat}} to the environment.|$|E

50|$|<b>Biodegradability</b> can be {{measured}} in a number of ways. Respirometry tests can be used for aerobic microbes. First one places a solid waste sample in a container with microorganisms and soil, and then aerate the mixture. Over the course of several days, microorganisms digest the sample bit by bit and produce carbon dioxide - the resulting amount of CO2 serves as an indicator of degradation. <b>Biodegradability</b> can also {{be measured}} by anaerobic microbes and the amount of methane or alloy that they are able to produce.
