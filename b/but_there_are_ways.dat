2500|$|In May 2016, it was {{reported}} that the outgoing executive producer of EastEnders, Dominic Treadwell-Collins, had tried to get Tully to return to the show, saying [...] " [...] emailed back and forth, but she's a director now. I briefly considered a recast, but it just didn't sit right. And you never know, maybe someone else can woo Sue Tully to come back." [...] He added, [...] "Michelle carries the one unexploded secret—the child. <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>ways</b> around that! So, yes, it was one of my original ideas—bringing Michelle in and the secrets she brings. I love secrets." [...] Instead, Treadwell-Collins introduced Michelle's son with Grant, Mark Fowler, played by Ned Porteous.|$|E

When she finds that {{everything}} will smile with her if she accepts him, and that her life will be made a burden to her if she still sticks to her Harry Annesley, she'll come round, if she be like other girls. Of course a girl can't be made to marry a man, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>ways</b> and means." [...] By this Lady Mountjoy meant that the utmost cruelty should be used which would be compatible with a good breakfast, dinner, and bedroom. Now, Mrs. Mountjoy knew herself to be incapable of this, and knew also, or thought that she knew, {{that it would not}} be efficacious.|$|E

6000|$|I {{may as well}} explain here what a blind baggage is. Some mail-cars {{are built}} without doors in the ends; hence, such a car is [...] "blind." [...] The mail-cars that possess end doors, have those doors always locked. Suppose, after the train has started, that a tramp gets on to the {{platform}} {{of one of these}} blind cars. There is no door, or the door is locked. No conductor or brakeman can get to him to collect fare or throw him off. It is clear that the tramp is safe until the next time the train stops. Then he must get off, run ahead in the darkness, and when the train pulls by, jump on to the blind again. <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>ways</b> and ways, as you shall see.|$|E

It {{has not been}} in the family before; and I am nearly sure that I know when I took the infection, four or five years ago, from a poor man in Smoke-jack Alley, who would let no one lift him but me. They are healthy young things, all but dear little Cherry, and I hope they have spirits to keep care from making them otherwise. You will say a kind word to my little Cherry sometimes, Audley. Poor little woman, I am afraid it may fall sorely on her, she is of rather too highly strung a composition, and perhaps I have not acted so much for her good as my own pleasure, in the {{companionship}} we have had together.' ...|$|E
60|$|There {{are some}} {{exceedingly}} useful words in this language. SCHLAG, for example; and ZUG. There are {{three-quarters of a}} column of SCHLAGS in the dictonary, and a column {{and a half of}} ZUGS. The word SCHLAG means Blow, Stroke, Dash, Hit, Shock, Clap, Slap, Time, Bar, Coin, Stamp, Kind, Sort, Manner, Way, Apoplexy, Wood-cutting, Enclosure, Field, Forest-clearing. This is its simple and EXACT meaning--that is to say, its restricted, its fettered meaning; <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>ways</b> by which you can set it free, so that it can soar away, as on the wings of the morning, and never be at rest. You can hang any word you please to its tail, and make it mean anything you want to. You can begin with SCHLAG-ADER, which means artery, and you can hang on the whole dictionary, word by word, clear through the alphabet to SCHLAG-WASSER, which means bilge-water--and including SCHLAG-MUTTER, which means mother-in-law.|$|E

Then the young man, taking off his own shoes, said: [...] "First, you shall use these shoes till you have taken the Terrible Head, and then you must give them back to me. And with these shoes you will fly as fleet as a bird, or a thought, over the land or over the waves of the sea, wherever the shoes know the way. <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>ways</b> which they do not know, roads {{beyond the borders of}} the world. And these roads have you to travel. Now first you must go to the Three Gray Sisters, who live far off in the north, and are so very cold that they have only one eye and one tooth among the three. You must creep up close to them, and as one of them passes the eye to the other you must seize it, and refuse to give it up till they have told you the way to the Three Fairies of the Garden, and they will give you the Cap of Darkness and the Sword of Sharpness, and show you how to wing beyond this world {{to the land of the}} Terrible Head." ...|$|E
60|$|I doubt not, nevertheless, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>ways</b> to {{be found}} to assist our reason in this most useful part; and this the judicious Hooker {{encourages}} me to say, who in his Eccl. Pol. 1. i. Section 6, speaks thus: 'If there might be added the right helps of true art and learning, (which helps, I must plainly confess, this age of the world, carrying {{the name of a}} learned age, doth neither much know nor generally regard,) there would undoubtedly be almost as much difference in maturity of judgment between men therewith inured, and that which men now are, as between men that are now, and innocents.' I do not pretend to have found or discovered here any of those 'right helps of art,' this great man of deep thought mentions: but that is plain, that syllogism, and the logic now in use, which were as well known in his days, can be none of those he means. It is sufficient for me, if by a Discourse, perhaps something out of the way, I am sure, as to me, wholly new and unborrowed, I shall have given occasion to others to cast about for new discoveries, and to seek in their own thoughts for those right helps of art, which will scarce be found, I fear, by those who servilely confine themselves to the rules and dictates of others. For beaten tracks lead this sort of cattle, (as an observing Roman calls them,) whose thoughts reach only to imitation, NON QUO EUNDUM EST, SED QUO ITUR. But I can be bold to say, that this age is adorned with some men of that strength of judgment and largeness of comprehension, that, if they would employ their thoughts on this subject, could open new and undiscovered ways to the advancement of knowledge.|$|E
