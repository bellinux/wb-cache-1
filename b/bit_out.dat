500|$|Much like Yankovic's {{previous}} album, Bad Hair Day {{features a}} polka medley of then-current hit songs, [...] "The Alternative Polka". [...] "The Alternative Polka" [...] originally contained {{the chorus of}} Weezer's song [...] "Buddy Holly" [...] performed by Yankovic, but the song's writer, Weezer front man Rivers Cuomo, requested its removal just before the album's release. Yankovic was forced to physically cut the <b>bit</b> <b>out</b> of the master tape, but Weezer was still given credit in the liner notes because the notes were already printed. On June 25, 2010, over fourteen years after the album's release, Yankovic released the un-mixed and un-mastered [...] "Buddy Holly" [...] clip on his official YouTube channel.|$|E
500|$|In contrast, Doug Buel of The Tampa Tribune {{considered}} Rufus {{a character}} the game {{could have done}} without, describing him as [...] "an obnoxious, overweight fighter with a big mouth", additionally citing the character as the game's worst feature. GameSpot described him as [...] "a bit of a sight gag", though noting his speed as [...] "deceptive". A reviewer for the New Straits Times felt that though the character stood out from the other newcomers, his play was too [...] "lethargic". Giant Bomb's Jeff Gerstmann noted that the character was [...] "a <b>bit</b> <b>out</b> of place" [...] {{with the rest of}} the cast, describing him as a [...] "big, bobbing belly with appendages", though he added that Rufus was feasible as a playable character.|$|E

[...] Critics have also commented on the occasional misstep in a performance; Rohan Preston noted in his review of Grimm that [...] "there are moments– just a few stand out– {{when you realize that}} these are students, after all, in a celebrated after-school program. You want them to succeed, even if they do not always." [...] Similarly, writing for BroadwayWorld, Elaina Lenertz stated, [...] "Sometimes their silks routines are a <b>bit</b> <b>out</b> of sync and sometimes the show features dance routines from younger kids who are still mastering stunts.

500|$|A vocal {{coach was}} enlisted {{to help the}} cast. Music {{director}} Chris Horvath was recruited to arrange the selected songs for the cast. The arrangements took around two months, with vocals recorded over four days in February 2011. Horvath praised the cast's response to the episode, noting that only four performers had [...] "serious vocal talent," [...] while some had [...] "barely sung in the shower" [...] before. Those with professional singing experience include Ramirez, who won a Tony Award {{for her role in}} the musical Spamalot, and Wilson, who appeared in the Broadway production of Caroline, or Change. Cast members's reactions toward the episode varied. Pompeo initially deemed the idea [...] "crazy," [...] but rescinded her stance following the first read-through. Recurring cast member Sunjata stated that singing was [...] "a <b>bit</b> <b>out</b> of [...] comfort zone," [...] but found it an [...] "interesting challenge," [...] and McKidd deemed it [...] "very exciting to do something that's completely out on a limb for the show." ...|$|E
500|$|Complications in Mercedes' {{relationship}} with Malachy occurred when she begins {{an affair with}} Calvin Valentine (Ricky Whittle) while working with him at The Loft. Metcalfe expressed that she had initial [...] "reservations" [...] about the storyline which she felt was [...] "far-fetched", adding that once she had begun filming the scenes she thought the plot was [...] "brilliant" [...] even though she felt Mercedes would {{be perceived as a}} [...] "bitch". Whittle expressed similar doubts, saying he felt it was [...] "a <b>bit</b> <b>out</b> of character" [...] for Calvin, although he felt the plot was [...] "exciting". At first the pair did not like each other, but after spending time together, they realised that there was more to their personalities than they initially thought. Whittle explained that the attraction between Mercedes and Calvin began [...] "building", to the point that she and Malachy have [...] "a massive row" [...] and Calvin comforts her; Whittle stated that [...] "the next thing you know they’re tearing each other’s clothes off".|$|E
500|$|Mark's {{departure}} {{was shown}} during a special real-time episode, {{which focused on}} a 30-minute timeframe. Executive producer Susan Bower revealed that the team wanted Mark [...] "to {{go out with a}} bang" [...] and commented that while the episode features about half a dozen people, it is mostly about Mark and Kate. The show's script producer, Emma Gordon, agreed that the real-time episode was [...] "the best way to do justice" [...] to the character and his exit. McGregor explained that while the producers were planning his character's exit, they took inspiration from the US drama 24. Gordon admitted to Tiffany Fox from The West Australian that the technique was a real challenge for Neighbours. She said [...] "It is a bit different and a <b>bit</b> <b>out</b> of our normal storytelling process but it gives such a sense of tension which is exactly the feeling we wanted to create. When you have half an hour to make a decision that will affect the rest of your life, every excruciating minute counts." ...|$|E

500|$|Azeem Ahmad of MusicOMH {{positively}} reviewed Good Girl Gone Bad Live {{giving it}} four stars and wrote that [...] "it isn't {{going to win}} over any new fans, but buying it won't disappoint the many that already exist". According to him the songs are different from their recorded versions and sound [...] "infectiously upbeat but in a more grown-up way than the album". Ahmad concluded that even the [...] "cringey" [...] American pronunciation of [...] "Manchester" [...] and associated drivel can't take away the vocal strength of [...] "Rehab". He further praised the interlude [...] "Scratch" [...] calling it [...] "impressive". Ahmad concluded that [...] "If anyone was still wondering, Rihanna isn't miming during this show but the DVD's audio might be little <b>bit</b> <b>out</b> of sync with the video." [...] A reviewer of Blu-ray.com was more critical stating {{that even though the}} transfer does not has serious technical flaws, the video can not pair to Live from the Royal Albert Hall (2009) by American rock band The Killers. According to the reviewer there are few close-ups that look soft and also a lot of motion-judder that ranges from mild to strong. He stated that the camera positioning during a lot of acts in not [...] "overly convincing" [...] and some close-ups are too dark. However, according to him contrast levels are good. The reviewer concluded that [...] "all in all, consistency is definitely an issue with Good Girl Gone Bad; parts of the show look great in high-definition, but there are also certain parts of it that are far from convincing." [...] At the 2009 Grammy Awards, Good Girl Gone Bad Live received a nomination for Best Long Form Music Video, but lost to Runnin' Down a Dream (2007).|$|E
500|$|Schwartz {{wrote in}} August 1980 that [...] "...the pilot episode manages to stuff nearly every imaginable aspect of low life into its first hour: prostitution, panhandling, pickpocketing, hostage taking, drug {{addiction}} and, finally, {{the murder of}} two policemen." [...] William Beamon of The Evening Independent noted that the opening episode introduces the audience to {{a vast array of}} characters masterfully intertwined in the storyline in a way that gives the series a [...] "powerful start". A review in the Spartanburg Herald-Journal commented that public defender Davenport's role adds professional intrigue that heightens the provocative nature of their illicit romance. However, The Miami News Jicha speculates that the romance was contrived to make the police show enticing to audiences. Jicha notes that the attack upon the police depicts the uncertainty of the daily life in law enforcement, but that the introduction of Belker's persona shows the writers are a <b>bit</b> <b>out</b> of touch with reality. Buckley's review in The New York Times claimed the episode [...] "veers back and forth between comic situations that aren't funny, serious matters that aren't that convincing and a romance that is merely silly" [...] and stated that various lighting and acting techniques were unsuccessful. The Boston Globe Henry III wrote that [...] "The redeeming virtue is a visual style reminiscent of documentaries — hand-held camera, saturated color, deliberately ragged editing." [...] He also described the show as [...] "a wacky, black-comic and frequently scary portrait of life in a big city police station". Buckley claimed that the show attempts to present an entire force of police officers with foibles that make them unfit for duty. Henry describes the shooting of the officers as an [...] "appallingly realistic random shooting", but since they were not found for hours, he describes their survival and recovery in the next episode, [...] "Presidential Fever", as miraculous.|$|E

2500|$|Rising or Posting: The rider {{makes an}} up-and-down {{movement}} each stride, {{rising out of}} the saddle for one beat and lowering (sits) for the second beat. When the rising trot is performed correctly, it is comfortable for the rider and easy on the horse. This is preferred for show jumping, hunt seat, eventing (the jumping phases), saddle seat, lower-level dressage, and most other English-type riding as well as endurance riding. Although this does not provide as much control as sitting, it frees the horse's back. In the rising trot, the rider allows the horse's movement to throw his or her seat a <b>bit</b> <b>out</b> of the saddle. When coming back down, the seat touches down lightly rather than slamming down on the horse's back. [...] Except in saddle seat riding, rider's shoulders maintain a slight forward incline throughout the rising trot, instead of the upright, vertical position seen in sitting trot. The shoulders and lower legs remain in relatively the same position when the rider is both rising and sitting and the hands also stay in the same position as the rider rises and sits.|$|E
