50|$|Rožna Dolina was {{originally}} {{part of the}} village of Glince in the former Municipality of Vič. The area was largely undeveloped until after the 1895 Ljubljana earthquake, when developers started looking for cheap land near industry to build housing for workers. The low-lying meadows {{in what is now}} Rožna Dolina were purchased in the 1890s by the Slovene Workers Building Association (Slovensko delavsko stavbno društvo), founded by Janez Evangelist Krek, and the first house was built in 1898 below the railroad line, where the ground was somewhat higher. Its owner, Matevž Perne, became the first head of the Rožna Dolina Beautification Society (Olepševalno društvo Rožna dolina), founded in 1905. The society members largely developed Rožna Dolina at their own initiative, <b>building</b> <b>drainage</b> canals, streets, and roads, because the new settlement and its residents were viewed with some distrust by the original farming population of Vič. The village developed as a suburb of Ljubljana and never had a farming population. Rožna Dolina was separated from Glince and made an independent village in 1924. In the 1931 census, Rožna Dolina had a population of 3,431 living in 352 houses. Along with the entire former Municipality of Vič, Rožna Dolina was annexed by the City of Ljubljana in 1935, ending its existence as an independent settlement.|$|E

40|$|A <b>building</b> <b>drainage</b> {{network is}} an {{essential}} provision of each developed city all over the world. The terminal velocity at discharging drainage stack is a crucial issue as it provides the permitted flow rate of a <b>building</b> <b>drainage</b> system. The National Plumbing Code (NPC) of the US has specified the permitted flow rate for drainage systems. Mathematical expressions for terminal velocity were reported in research studies since the 1920 s but discrepancies among calculations remained. This study proposes an empirical approach in determining the terminal velocity in a drainage stack using the air pressure distribution mechanism. New experimental observations of the stack terminal velocity using a digital high-speed video camera were presented as a validation database. The proposed model was validated {{in terms of the}} measured terminal velocities and the locations of the maximum air pressure in a discharging stack at a steady water flow rate (1. 0, 2. 0, 3. 0 and 4. 0 L/s). This article offers an empirical approach and validation for terminal velocity instead of using the existing deductive approach. Practical applications: This article proposes an empirical approach with experimental validation for terminal velocity at a drainage stack. New evidence presented would lead to a review of the terminal velocity in drainage stacks in future drainage network designs. Due to the importance of terminal velocity, it is anticipated that this result would be used to lead the new technical development of <b>building</b> <b>drainage</b> system.

However, an accurate estimation of the flow attenuation within <b>building</b> <b>drainage</b> pipes is of great importance to prevent solid eposition and subsequent blockage. The research is focused on the field of subcritical flow in partially-filled pipes. Experimental and numerical investigations have been carried out to study the wave attenuation in the following configurations encountered in drainage pipe systems: i) A simple pipe, ii) A pipe subject to one concentrated lateral inflow, iii) A pipe with gate fixed at the downstream section, generating an interaction between wave and backwater profiles. In the present study the Saint-Venant equations are derived in their general and characteristic forms. A number of numerical procedures for solution of the Saint-Venant equations are reviewed, and the rectangular grid characteristics method, diffusing scheme and Strelkoff's implicit method are chosen to solve the equations. The stability of the finite-difference methods used is investigated for free-outfall and controlled outfall boundary conditions. An experimental installation consisting of 0. 105 m diameter uPVC pipe is used to investigate the characteristics of the flow and to form test cases for the numerical methods. Comparisons between computed and observed depth hydrographs, peak depths and depth variations along the pipe are made for subcritical flow in a pipe of slope 1 / 300. The rectangular-grid characteristics method and the diffusing scheme are also applied to supercritical flow. Flow tests are undertaken for supercritical flow in a pipe of slope 1 / 200 to validate the use of these methods. The investigation revealed that the attenuation rate of peak depths is affected by the volume of the waves. The implicit method is the most suitable method, dealing efficiently with most problems encountered in drainage pipe systems of flat slope. The diffusing scheme can model the attenuation of supercritical flow within <b>building</b> <b>drainage</b> pipes.

40|$|The {{appliance}} {{trap seal}} remains the primary defence against cross-contamination from the foul air present within the <b>building</b> <b>drainage</b> system. As an identified vector {{in the spread}} of {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} (SARS) in Hong Kong in 2003, trap seal failure has been confirmed as a significant, and potentially fatal, risk to public health. Prevention of trap seal failure depends upon both good design, to limit the air pressure transients propagated within the system, and good maintenance. However, current maintenance regimes rely solely on visual inspections which is time consuming and often impractical to implement in large complex buildings. This thesis documents the development of a novel approach to system maintenance whereby the threat of cross-contamination of disease is minimised by the remote monitoring of trap seal status. This was approached through the application and development of the reflected wave technique which is fundamentally based upon the characteristic reflection coefficients of system boundary conditions. An extensive programme of laboratory experiments and field trials were carried out to collect transient pressure data which, together with results from an existing mathematical model (AIRNET), developed by the Drainage Research Group at Heriot- Watt University, have been used to validate the proposed technique and to formulate a practical methodology which may be applied to any <b>building</b> <b>drainage</b> system. Automatic system diagnosis, which would in the future allow the proposed technique to be integrated as an automated system test, was provided by the development of the trap condition evaluator (TRACER) program by this author. Incorporating a time series change detection algorithm, the TRACER program accurately detects and locates a depleted trap seal by automatically identifying the return time of the trap’s reflection. The reflected wave technique has been demonstrated as a successful approach to depleted trap identification provided that the wave propagation speed is known and the dampening influence of the junction effect (which can delay the observed reflection return time) are taken into account. The reflected wave technique offers a remote and non-invasive approach to maintaining the <b>building</b> <b>drainage</b> system and provides, for the first time, a diagnostic tool to help prevent cross-contamination.

In particular, the outbreak {{that occurred in the}} high-rise residential blocks in the Amoy Gardens housing estate, sounded an alarm to the local practice of design, installation, commissioning, operation and maintenance of building services systems. Virus transmission through the vertical drainage stack {{is believed to have been}} one of the causes of disease transmission in Amoy Gardens. In this paper, the authors share their experiences and research findings on the <b>building</b> <b>drainage</b> system. The paper includes a review of the {{outbreak in}}cident in Amoy Gardens; and of the observations and site measurements of foul air and water back flow in the drainage system of another vacant high-rise residential housing estate. In addition, tracer gas measurements were studied in order to verify the upwards flow of air in the vertical stack. These field studies allow comparisons between the gas flow from the drainage system to the living accommodation, and confirm the hypothesized infection route. Finally, the authors make recommendations on the proper design and operation of high-rise <b>building</b> <b>drainage</b> systems. Practical application: Sanitary drainage systems form a critic al engineering component in maintaining hygienic conditions in buildings. In fact the issue has been addressed over several hundreds of years, for example during the Black Death outbreak worldwide.
