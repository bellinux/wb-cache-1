50|$|Bronchospasm or a <b>bronchial</b> <b>spasm</b> is {{a sudden}} {{constriction}} {{of the muscles}} in {{the walls of the}} bronchioles. It is caused by the release (degranulation) of substances from mast cells or basophils under the influence of anaphylatoxins. It causes difficulty in breathing which can be very mild to severe.|$|E

30|$|A {{bronchoscopy}} is {{an adequate}} technique for physicians and scientists to obtain airway cells (e.g., bronchial brushings) or tissues from a patient’s lower airway to diagnose diseases and perform basic and translational research. However, {{there are risks}} following a bronchoscopy including <b>bronchial</b> <b>spasms,</b> bleeding and infection [1]. A minimally invasive approach such as nasal brushings is urgently needed to study lower airway diseases such as asthma. Though previous efforts {{have been taken to}} determine the surrogacy of nasal epithelial cells, there is no solid conclusion as to whether they can be ideal surrogates for bronchial epithelial cells.|$|R

The unilateral headache generally responds well to indomethacin; however, continuous indomethacin intake is often not tolerated due to severe adverse effects, like hypertension, gastrointestinal discomfort (especially if combined with aspirin), slightly increased risk of vascular events, and <b>bronchial</b> <b>spasms.</b> Therefore, alternative treatment options are desperately needed.

40|$|Mucus {{hypersecretion}} accompanies such pulmonary diseases as asthma, bronchitis, and pneumonia. While some of {{the factors}} capable of influencing mucus secretion have been identified (1 - 9), no investigations into the possible interaction of activated complement products with mucus secretion have been reported. During the course of complement activation by either the alternative or the classical pathway, anaphylatoxins are generated {{that are capable of}} causing mast cell and basophil degranulation, inducing <b>bronchial</b> smooth muscle <b>spasm</b> and attracting polymorphonuclear leukocytes. It is possible that immunologic pulmonary inflammatory reactions are accompanied by anaphylatoxin generation, particularly during the course of fungal or bacterial infections (10), and perhaps in association with other airway diseases as well. Thus, we were interested in determining whether the anaphylatoxin C 3 a was capable of influencing mucous glycoprotein (MGP) 1 secretion in vitro...|$|R

When, however, he began to practice Kundalini Yoga with a strong focus on breathing exercises, his vulnerability to lung problems ended. (Khalsa and Stauth, p. 214.) ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>bronchial</b> <b>spasm</b> {{is due to}} the {{activation}} of parasympathetic nervous system. Postganglionic parasympathetic fibers will release acetylcholine causing the constriction of the smooth muscle layer surrounding the bronchi. These smooth muscle cells have muscarinic M3 receptors on their membrane. The activation of these receptors by acetylcholine will activate an intracellular G protein, that in turn will activate the phospholipase C pathway, that will end in an increase of intracellular calcium concentrations and therefore contraction of the smooth muscle cell. The muscle contraction will cause the diameter of the bronchus to decrease, therefore increasing its resistance to airflow.|$|E

30|$|The study {{protocol}} {{instructed the}} anesthesiologist to start treatment with bronchodilators {{as soon as}} bronchospasm was confirmed. The protocol also suggested avoiding airway irritation due to extensive manipulation, light anesthesia, endotracheal tube misplacement, aspiration or other stimuli {{that could lead to}} <b>bronchial</b> irritation and <b>spasm.</b> In cases where bronchospasm was suspected, the anesthesiologist was instructed to (a) check the endotracheal tube for narrowing/obstruction by kinking or secretions, (b) look for rashes that could be manifestation of allergic reaction, (c) check for cyanosis or desaturation to ensure that oximetry signals are valid, and (d) attempt to ventilate manually while listening for breath sounds and observing airway pressures. Peak and plateau pressures were measured together to help detect what the problem was: elevation of both peak and plateau pressures is more likely caused by intrathoracic cause (bronchospasm), whereas isolated peak airway pressure increase without change in plateau pressure could indicate a problem at or proximal to the ETT, such as mechanical tube narrowing (Stenqvist et al. 1979). If bronchospasm was detected, treatment options included increasing FiO 2 to 100  % to improve oxygenation, b 2 -receptor agonists or b 1, b 2 mixed agonists, corticosteroids and methyl xanthenes in order to achieve bronchodilation.|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{study the}} {{functional}} mechanism of Pingchuanning Decoction in treatment of airway remodeling in asthmatic rats. MethodsEighty healthy Wistar male rats were randomized into eight groups (n= 10 rats each) : Normal group, Asthma model group, Dexamethasone group, Guilong Kechuanning group, Xiaoqinglong Decoction group, and Pingchuanning Decoction low-, middle-, and high-dose groups. The rats {{of all but}} the Normal group were made into asthma models through intraperitoneal injection and aerosol inhalation of ovalbumin. All treatments were administered at the first stimulation of asthma onset (third week of modeling), and the rats were killed after stimulating asthma attacks for 4 weeks. The general conditions of rats and pathomorphological changes of the lung tissues were observed. The expression of nerve growth factor (NGF) of the lung tissues was measured with immunohistochemical methods, {{and the content of}} Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP) mRNA was determined with RT-PCR. ResultsCompared with the Normal group, the contents of NGF and CCSP mRNA in the lung tissues of the Model group were significantly changed (P< 0. 01). Compared with the Model group, the indices of Pingchuanning Decoction and other treatment groups were improved to some extent (P< 0. 05 or P< 0. 01). ConclusionSPathological changes of airway inflammation and remodeling were present in these rat asthma models. Pingchuanning Decoction had an intervention effect on these experimental models. Its functional mechanism may be related to multiple factors, including alleviation of airway inflammation, relief of <b>bronchial</b> smooth muscle <b>spasm,</b> and inhibition of airway remodeling...|$|R
5000|$|Aside {{from the}} {{challenges}} {{presented by the}} primitive studio, various incidents plagued Wings' Lagos stay. While out walking one night against advice, Paul and Linda were robbed at knifepoint. The assailants made away with all of their valuables and even stole a bag containing a notebook full of handwritten lyrics and songs, and cassettes containing demos for songs to be recorded. On another occasion, Paul was laying down a vocal track when he began gasping for air. According to Emerick: [...] "Within seconds, Paul turned as white as a sheet, explaining to us in a croaking voice that he couldn't catch his breath. We decided to take him outside for some fresh air ... but once he was exposed to the blazing heat he felt even worse and began keeling over, finally fainting dead away at our feet. Linda began screaming hysterically; she was convinced {{that he was having}} a heart attack ... The official diagnosis was that he had suffered a <b>bronchial</b> <b>spasm</b> brought on by too much smoking." [...] Another incident was the confrontation with local Afrobeat pioneer and political activist Fela Kuti, who publicly accused the band of being in Africa to exploit and steal African music after their visit to his club. Kuti even went to the studio to confront McCartney, who played their songs for him proving that they contained no local influence whatsoever. Later on, drummer and former Cream member Ginger Baker invited Wings to record their entire album at his place, ARC Studio in Ikeja. Though not wanting the invitation, Paul agreed to go there for one day. The song [...] "Picasso's Last Words (Drink to Me)" [...] was recorded at ARC, with Baker contributing a percussive tin of gravel.|$|E

40|$|Anaphylaxis is a multisystem {{reaction}} {{to the release of}} histamine and other inflammation mediators by the mastocyte and basophile cells follow-ing stimulation of the body by an antigen (such as a chemical, an insect bite, or a food item). This reaction might occur from a few minutes to a few hours after the cells come into contact with the antigen.

40|$|It {{is presumed}} that drugs {{able to prevent}} <b>bronchial</b> <b>spasm</b> and/or {{inflammation}} may have therapeutic potential to control asthma symptoms. The local anaesthetic lidocaine has recently received increased attention as an alter-native form of treatment for asthmatic patients. This paper reviews the major findings on the topic and summarizes the putative mechanisms underlying the airway effects of local anaesthetic agents. We think that lidocaine extends the spectrum of options in asthma therapy, probably by counteracting both spasmogenic and inflammatory stimuli in the bronchial airways. The possibility of development of new anti-asthma compounds based on the synthesis of lidocaine derivatives {{is also on the}} horizon. Key words: local anaesthetic- lidocaine- inflammation- asthma Asthma is a chronic inflammation of the lung airways caused by environmental factors in genetically predis-posed individuals.

40|$|BRONCHOSTENOSIS is a {{much more}} common {{complication}} of either al-lergic or infectious asthma than is generally believed. By bronchostenosis is meant a definite, localized, stricture-like narrowing of a bronchus. The lesion is felt to be primarily inflammatory in nature, and not referable to allergic edema or <b>bronchial</b> <b>spasm.</b> Two outstanding disturbances of func-tion result when a bronchus becomes stenosed; first, the movement of air entering or leaving the segment of pulmonary tissue beyond the region of the stenosis is inhibited, and second, bronchial secretions which usually are excessive in asthma, are retained below the stenotic region so that a region of partial or complete atelectasis results. During the past few years, a group of 140 patients suffering from asthma were specially selected for bronchoscopy, among whom we observed and treated 60 patients who were found to have definite stenosis of one or more bronchi. A study of this latter group revealed the fact that bronchostenosis complicating asthma generally produces characteristic symptoms and fre...|$|E
40|$|Rocuronium is the {{anesthetic}} agent {{most likely}} to cause anaphylaxis. Immediately after intravenous rocuronium administration, the authors experienced ventilatory impairment due to unilateral bronchospasm (left lung), which was relieved by emergency treatment. However, 80 minutes after beginning laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer, the left lung suddenly re-collapsed under pneumoperitoneum in the Trendelenburg position. A postoperative intradermal test revealed that rocuronium, vecuronium, atracurium, succinylcholine, or thiopental could induce anaphylaxis in this patient, {{but it was not}} established whether the second incident during surgery was due to endobronchial intubation or anaphylactic bronchospasm. This case cautions that under pneumoperitoneum in the Trendelenburg position, patients suspected of being prone to anaphylactic bronchospasm should also be considered at risk of endobronchial intubation.

40|$|MANY papers {{describing}} the anaesthesia for endo-tracheal intubation {{have been published}} {{during the past few}} years: they indicate that there are considerable differences of opinions as to the safest and best anaesthetic technique for this procedure; and no technique appears to have been consistently satisfactory. The commonest diffi-culty encountered is laryngo-bronchial spasm which may occur before, during, or immediately after the insertion of the tube; this complication has had tragic consequences (Wylie, 1950). Burstein et al. (1950) have observed that cardiac disturbances, often of a serious degree, may be precipitated by intubation and are particularly liable to occur if <b>bronchial</b> <b>spasm</b> follows intubation or attempts at intubation. The object of the present investigation was to attempt to develop a technique of intubation which could be performed with safety and rapidity on every patient; and which would also be free from respiratory and cardiac complications, particularly in patients with cardiac disease. The primary reason for administering an anaesthetic prior to intubation is to diminish the activity of the res-piratory vago-vagal reflexes and thereby to prevent the occurrence of laryngo-bronchial spasm. An adequate depth of anaesthesia will facilitate the insertion of the endotracheal tube and will prevent traumatization of the larynx.

40|$|Asthma is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} disorder of the airways, which is diagnosed by periodic symptoms of inflammation, <b>bronchial</b> <b>spasm,</b> and increased mucosal secretions. It has higher incidence among the preschool children. There are many contradictory reports {{based on the}} effect of asthma on oral health, however it has been hypothesized that asthma could lead to poor oral health. The objective {{of the present study was}} to investigate oral health indices in 44 preschool children of three to six years old with mild to moderate asthma and 46 matched healthy children in Tehran Children's Respiratory Center. Dental plaque, gingival inflammation, mouth breathing, and dental caries were evaluated by one trained examiner according to World Health Organization [WHO] criteria. Culture and colony counting of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus species were carried out in saliva specimens of the patients. The effects of different factors on the colony counts were statistically analyzed using linear regression analysis. The level of mother’s education and preexisting asthma disease in children had significant effect on the colony counts of streptococcus species whereas no factor was found to influence the number of lactobacillus counts significantly. The results indicated no significant differences between the children with asthma and those without asthma regarding (decayed, missing, filled, teeth) dmft index (mean of 3. 34 in asthmatic children and 3. 0 in the control group).

40|$|Under our {{observation}} {{there were}} 59 patients with pollinosis – 39 females and 20 males {{at the age}} from 18 to 68 years. All patients were in the phase of disease exacerbation. General clinical symptoms were: rhinitis, conjunctivitis and <b>bronchial</b> <b>spasm.</b> The results showed that first clinical manifestations appear in persons of young age. Half of the patients had aggravated allergologic anamnesis. Taking into account that pollinosis is a typical representative of diseases having mechanism of immunoglobulin E (IgE) -dependent allergic reactions of the first type, the authors have studied in detail level of IgE and its link with other factors. Practically in all patients with pollinosis level of total IgE exceeded the norm. As a result of studies performed, it was established that high IgE level, presence of phagocytosis defect and prolong duration of illness are the criteria which affect disease progress, aggravation of patients’ state, less efficacy of treatment. Due {{to the fact that}} development of bronchial obstruction and transformation of pollinosis into bronchial asthma is the most topical issue nowadays, the authors studied its link with other factors and findings. It was established that risk of pollinosis transformation into pollen bronchial asthma increases in the presence of high level of total IgE, aggravation of allergologic anamnesis, decrease of forced expiration volume (FEV), significant duration of disease course. In the course of investigation it was revealed that the highest efficacy of treatment is noted in patients receiving allergen-specific therapy; this confirms data of world scientific literature.
