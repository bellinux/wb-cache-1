5|$|Big Painting No. 6 (sometimes Big Painting or Big Painting VI) is a 1965 oil and Magna {{on canvas}} {{painting}} by Roy Lichtenstein. Measuring 235cm × 330cm (92.5 in × 129 in), {{it is part}} of the Brushstrokes series of artworks that includes several paintings and sculptures whose subject is the actions made with a house-painter's <b>brush.</b> <b>It</b> set a record auction price for a painting by a living American artist when it sold for $60,000 in 1970. The painting is in the Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen collection.|$|E
5|$|It {{is usually}} a {{permanent}} resident throughout its range, although birds at the extreme north of its range may migrate short distances, and others across their range may undergo local movements in unfavourable conditions. In South America, its range stretches to central Chile and Argentina. It also is found as a vagrant on the islands of the Caribbean. It prefers open land interspersed with areas of woods or <b>brush.</b> <b>It</b> {{is also found in}} moist lowland forests, shrublands and grasslands, wetlands and swamps, pastures, and heavily degraded former forests. Preferring lowlands, it is rarely seen in mountainous areas. It is usually seen soaring or perched on fence posts or dead trees.|$|E
25|$|Both the teepee and the oval-shaped {{house were}} used when I was a boy. The oval hut {{was covered with}} hide and was the best house. The more well-to-do had this kind. The tepee type was just made of <b>brush.</b> <b>It</b> had a place for {{a fire in the}} center. It was just thrown together. Both types were common even before my time....|$|E

I was endeavouring to lay it on for the third time, when he moved aside and desired, with a certain petulance, to be {{informed}} if I thought I was a ruddy osteopath.|$|R

25|$|Soon {{after it}} was {{discovered}} and recognized as the principle of meat smoking, wood-tar creosote became used {{as a replacement for}} the process. Several methods were used to apply the creosote. One was to dip the meat in pyroligneous acid or a water of diluted creosote, as Reichenbach did, or <b>brush</b> <b>it</b> over with them, and within one hour the meat would have the same quality of that of traditionally smoked preparations. Sometimes the creosote was diluted in vinegar rather than water, as vinegar was also used as a preservative. Another was to place the meat in a closed box, and place with it a few drops of creosote in a small bottle. Because of the volatility of the creosote, the atmosphere was filled with a vapour containing it, and it would cover the flesh.|$|E
25|$|On March 26, 2007, Patrick and Robin {{argue over}} her {{decision}} to not move back into their apartment with him. She then goes over to Wyndemere to see Nikolas and asks if she can stay with him. Nikolas is not home at the time, and as she searches through his desk to find a paper to leave a note, she is stopped by Mr. Craig (Sebastian Roche), the head gunman from the Metro Court hostage crisis, and finds out he is blackmailing Nikolas for a new identity. When Nikolas returns home, he finds Robin tending to Craig's wound and finds out that Craig had decided Robin might be useful in his blackmail plot. Craig instructs Robin to go about her normal life and not {{to draw attention to}} herself. Also, she cannot not tell anybody—especially Patrick—and he makes numerous threats against Patrick to keep her in line. Robin goes about his instructions and gets into a fight with Patrick. On March 29, 2007, Patrick goes over to Wyndemere and demands that Nikolas tell him what is going on. Nikolas hesitates and Robin walks in. She can see Craig {{out of the corner of}} her eye, holding a gun. She fears for Patrick's safety, so she lies to him and tells him they are over. Later, Craig decides that a good cover story for Robin living at Wyndemere will be to have Robin and Nikolas play out a very public love affair. They agreed, fearing for their loved ones' lives. At the end of the day, Alexis (Nancy Lee Grahn) walks into Wyndemere, stopping dead in her tracks when she sees Robin and Nikolas in a very delicate position on the couch. The two <b>brush</b> <b>it</b> off as though it is nothing, but Alexis is clearly suspicious. Robin and Patrick are reunited following an almost deadly confrontation with Mr Craig. Once Nik is in the clear for good, Robin and Patrick go home together.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the closure}} of the base, a small force of Marines {{remained}} around Hill 689 carrying out mopping up operations. Further fighting followed after this, resulting in the loss of another 11 Marines and 89 NVA soldiers, before the Marines finally withdrew from the area on 11 July. According to <b>Brush,</b> <b>it</b> was [...] "the only occasion in which Americans abandoned a major combat base due to enemy pressure" [...] and in the aftermath, the North Vietnamese began a strong propaganda campaign, seeking to exploit the US withdrawal and to promote the message that the withdrawal had not been by choice.|$|E

500|$|In {{the fourth}} season opener, Rita and Dexter are living happily {{together}} in a suburban neighborhood with Astor, Cody, and new baby Harrison. In [...] "Remains to be Seen" [...] Dexter is in a terrible car accident, and Rita demands that he give her his keys {{so that she can}} drive him. In [...] "If I Had a Hammer," [...] friction begins to develop in the couple's relationship, and Dexter seeks guidance from Arthur Mitchell (John Lithgow), a family man who appears to balance his responsibilities with his secret life as the [...] "Trinity Killer". In [...] "Hungry Man," [...] Rita works hard to prepare Thanksgiving dinner. She shares a kiss with the next door neighbor, Elliot Larson (Rick Peters), when she asks if she can use his stove. Dexter arrives for an appointment with Rita for marriage counseling, but gets called to a crime scene as soon as he arrives. Soon after, Rita confesses that she and Elliot kissed, although Dexter tries to <b>brush</b> <b>it</b> off. Rita later admits that she felt hurt that he did not seem to care about her indiscretion. Dexter then punches Elliot and warns him to stay away from Rita, which reassures her that Dexter loves her. In the fourth season finale, Dexter asks her to go out of town so they can have a belated honeymoon; in reality, Dexter wants to keep her safe from Mitchell, who has learned his real identity and threatened to kill him and his family. After killing Mitchell, Dexter returns home and finds a message from Rita that she returned to pick up her identification for the flight. Dexter finds her dead in the bathtub [...] Mitchell's last victim. In the fifth season premiere [...] "My Bad", Dexter realizes, much to his own surprise, that he genuinely loved Rita and is devastated by her death. Julie Benz reprised her role as Rita as a special guest star in a flashback to her and Dexter's first date, and as a corpse.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{writers on}} Homer's work have seen {{evidence}} of the artist's self-disclosure in The Fox Hunt. Seeing the picture in Freudian terms, Thomas B. Hess believed the fox, [...] "dapper, small, inquisitive, shrewd", was a self-portrait. [...] Cikovsky noted that the artist's signature is [...] "sinking like the fox into the deep snow and exactly mimicking its form and action", and adds that the fox's tail, repeated by the 'R' in the signature, is called a <b>brush.</b> <b>It</b> is possible that Homer identified with slyness and social aloofness, qualities attributed to the fox. As well, the crows {{have been seen as}} omens of death, and for Hess, basing his interpretation on Freud's study of Leonardo da Vinci's work, they represent [...] "the nightmare of the flying 'penis'".|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to verbally needling batters to distract them, he developed {{skills such as}} blocking the plate to prevent base runners from scoring and faking {{the sound of a}} foul tip. (He was probably responsible for the 1891 rule change requiring that a batter must have two strikes against him in order to be called out if the catcher caught a foul tip.) [...] Besides tipping bats to fake the sound of a foul tip, Mack became adept at tipping bats to throw off the hitter's swing. ("Tipping" [...] a bat is to <b>brush</b> <b>it</b> with the catcher's mitt as the batter swings, either delaying the swing or putting it off course, so that the batter misses the ball or doesn't hit it solidly. [...] If the umpire is aware that a bat has been tipped, whether intentionally or unintentionally, he calls catcher's interference.) Mack never denied such tricks: ...|$|E
2500|$|A subtle running joke {{throughout}} {{the series is}} Dwight's surprising success with attractive women, with Michael often failing to [...] "hook up" [...] at the same time. Despite Dwight's unusual appearance and mannerisms, he manages to attract women, who usually develop stronger feelings for him than vice versa. Michael has even pointed out how socially weird Dwight is acting, only for the woman to <b>brush</b> <b>it</b> off. In [...] "Night Out", Dwight hooks up with a women's basketball player, while Michael fails in his attempts with other women. As Michael and Dwight leave the club, the woman calls out for Dwight to call her, which he says to Michael {{that he will not}} do. In [...] "Niagara", Michael and Dwight compete for the attention of Pam's best friend, Isabel. When Dwight starts talking about his farm, Michael tries to explain that no one can connect with his experiences as farmer, only for Isabel to become interested in Dwight's horses. Dwight ultimately manages to have sex with her, and she begins to develop deeper feelings for him which he does not return, although it is finally hinted in [...] "The Delivery" [...] that Dwight might have more intimate feelings for her than he originally let on. They meet again at the bar in [...] "Happy Hour", and bond further, kissing {{at the end of the}} episode. In a chat at OfficeTally.com, Mindy Kaling noted that Dwight is not a typical [...] "nerd" [...] character, that he is a [...] "farmer and kind of strapping and tall", and it generally makes sense that he does well with the opposite sex. In season 9, he begins to date an attractive neighboring farmer named Esther (Nora Kirkpatrick). He ultimately ends his relationship with her in [...] "A.A.R.M.". In the final episode, Dwight marries Angela Martin.|$|E
