At its debut, the country sent seven athletes to the games, all of whom competed in athletics. The largest number of <b>Burundian</b> athletes participating in the summer games is seven in 1996 and 2004. The only <b>Burundian</b> competitor to win a medal at the Olympics was Vénuste Niyongabo, who won gold in the men's 5000 metres in 1996. Three athletes from Burundi were selected {{to compete in the}} 2008 Olympics: Joachim Nshimirimana in the men's marathon, Francine Niyonizigiye in the women's track and field 5000 metres and Elsie Uwamahoro in the women's 50 metre freestyle swimming.|$|E

By late 2010 the FDLR's strength however was estimated at 2,500. The other groups are smaller: the Ugandan Lord's Resistance Army, the Ugandan rebel group the Allied Democratic Forces in the remote area of Mt Rwenzori, and the <b>Burundian</b> Parti pour la Libération du Peuple Hutu—Forces Nationales de Liberation (PALIPEHUTU-FNL).|$|E

40|$|Background: Recent {{cross-cultural}} {{comparisons between}} Asian and Western cultures {{have shown that}} ageism arises more {{from the lack of}} availability of social and economic resources for older adults than from the culture itself. We tested this assumption by conducting a survey among people living in a least-developed country compared with a developed country. Methods: Twenty-seven Belgians living in Belgium, 29 <b>Burundians</b> living in Belgium and 32 <b>Burundians</b> living in Burundi were included in this study. Their attitudes toward older adults were assessed using several self-reported measures. Results: Statistical analyses confirmed that older people are more negatively perceived by <b>Burundians</b> living in Burundi than by <b>Burundians</b> and Belgians living in Belgium, whose attitudes did not differ from each other. Conclusion: Consistent with our hypothesis, our results suggest that the level of development of a country and more particularly the lack of government spending on older people (pension and healthcare systems) may contribute to their younger counterparts perceiving them more negatively.

25|$|Most Christian {{holidays}} are celebrated, with Christmas being the largest. <b>Burundian</b> Independence Day is celebrated annually on 1 July. In 2005, the <b>Burundian</b> government declared Eid al-Fitr, an Islamic holiday, to {{be a public}} holiday.|$|E
25|$|February 23–March 4, 2011 – 53–82 AU {{troops were}} killed in clashes with al-Shabab fighters during an {{offensive}} in Mogadishu, 190 other AMISOM troops were also wounded. In addition, a <b>Burundian</b> soldier was captured alive by militants. These were, at the time, the heaviest losses since AMISOM deployed. 43 of those killed were confirmed as <b>Burundian</b> soldiers and 10 as Ugandans. Also, 110 of the wounded were Burundians. Beside the 43 killed in action, four <b>Burundian</b> soldiers were declared missing in action.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Burundian</b> {{troops were}} {{technically}} {{ready to go}} in early August 2007, but equipment promised by the United States and France had not yet arrived. On December 23, 2007, an advance force of 100 Burundians was deployed and another 100 soldiers arrived on 2007-12-24. By late 2008, 1,700 <b>Burundian</b> soldiers were deployed to Mogadishu.|$|E
30|$|The Arusha Peace Agreement {{was signed}} in August 2000 {{and led to the}} end of the {{conflict}} a few years later. In 2005, <b>Burundians</b> elected Pierre Nkurunziza, a Hutu, as President of the country, reinforcing the conditions of the peace agreement. Following the end of the conflict, Burundi experienced a large wave of return of its displaced population. Estimates suggest that over 500, 000 <b>Burundians</b> returned from Tanzania between 2000 and 2015 (Fransen 2015). This is a considerable number for a country that had a population of only 6.7 million in 2000. Moreover, during this period, Tanzania stopped the provision of education for <b>Burundians</b> in order to encourage refugees to return home (Dryden-Peterson 2015 b).|$|R

5000|$|Ngara District {{received}} {{several hundred thousand}} refugees from Burundi beginning in 1993, and Rwanda in 1994 during the Great Lakes Refugee Crisis. The refugees were fled {{the aftermath of the}} 1994 Rwandan genocide and Civil War. In this context, Ngara District received attention from around the world, including the funding of a large refugee relief operation funded by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, World Food Program, and International donors. The crisis brought coverage from CNN, Time Magazine, and many other press outlets covering the refugee crisis.Starting in October 1993 civil unrest in Burundi led also to refugee flight into Ngara District, where they were resettled at Lukole Refugee Camp. A number of refugee camps were established to accommodate the Rwandan refugees, the largest camp which was Benaco, which was opened to accommodate over 200,000 refugees from Rwanda in early May 1994. Other camps were opened in Ngara District in 1994 at Lumasi for Rwandans, and Lukole for <b>Burundians.</b> [...] Other small camps for <b>Burundians</b> were opened in 1996. Benaco and the other camps for Rwandans were closed in late 1996, when the Tanzanian military, in cooperation with the governments of Rwanda, and the international donors supporting the camps, forcibly repatriated several hundred thousand. However, smaller numbers of refugees have remained in the district since that time, particularly <b>Burundians.</b> Lukole camp for <b>Burundians</b> is the best known of these camps. Ngara District {{has a long history of}} receiving refugees. The first of the refugee arrivals was in the early 1960s when Tutsi refugees fled from Rwanda following that country's independence. They were resettled in Ngara for over twenty years, before returning to Rwanda after 1994.https://www.academia.edu/32596550/Assessing_the_Impact_of_the_Rwandan_Refugee_Crisis_on_Western_Tanzania_1994-1996 ...|$|R

25|$|The {{situation}} worsened {{when the}} first elected <b>Burundian</b> president, Melchior Ndadaye, a Hutu, was assassinated by the <b>Burundian</b> Tutsi-dominated army in October 1993. In Burundi, a fierce civil war then erupted between Tutsi and Hutu following the army's massacre. This conflict spilled over the border into Rwanda and destabilized the fragile Rwandan accords. Tutsi-Hutu tensions rapidly intensified. Although the UN sent a peacekeeping force named the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR), it was underfunded, under-staffed, and largely ineffective {{in the face of}} a two country civil-war.
