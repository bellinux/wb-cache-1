5|$|As the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska narodna armija – JNA) {{withdrew from}} Croatia {{following}} {{the implementation of}} the Vance plan, it was reorganised into a new Bosnian Serb army. This reorganisation followed the declaration of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 9 January 1992, ahead of the 29 February – 1 March 1992 referendum on the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This declaration was later cited by the <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serbs</b> as a pretext for the Bosnian War. <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serbs</b> began fortifying the capital, Sarajevo, and other areas on 1 March. On the following day, the first fatalities of the war were recorded in Sarajevo and Doboj. On 27 March, Bosnian Serb forces bombarded Bosanski Brod with artillery, drawing a border crossing by the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska – HV) 108th Brigade in response.|$|E
5|$|According to the 1991 census, the {{municipality}} of Bijeljina had approximately 97,000 inhabitants. The demographic proportions were approximately 59% <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serbs,</b> 31% Bosniaks and 10% belonged to other ethnicities. The town of Bijeljina itself had 36,414 inhabitants, 19,024 {{of whom were}} Bosniaks (or 52% of the town's population), while the Serbs were the second largest ethnic group in the town.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the extreme}} {{position}} taken by the <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serb</b> government, the Yugoslav Federation (Serbia and Montenegro) itself {{had to take a}} strong stance against the <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serb</b> entity. This led to the quasi-complete diplomatic isolation of the <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serb</b> entity.|$|R
50|$|On 15 October 1991, the {{parliament}} of SR Bosnia and Herzegovina {{passed a resolution}} on the sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in spite of strong opposition from <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serb</b> deputies. Ten days later, the Serb Democratic Party (SDS) formed a <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serb</b> Assembly, with Momčilo Krajišnik acting as its president. The <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serb</b> Assembly began establishing parallel government structures.|$|R
50|$|These <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serb</b> {{assembly}} members {{invited the}} <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serb</b> population {{to boycott the}} referendum held on 29 February and 1 March 1992. The turnout in the referendum was 64-67% and the vote was 98% in favor of independence. Independence was declared on 5 March 1992 by the parliament. The referendum and the murder of two <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serb</b> members of a wedding procession in Sarajevo the day prior to the referendum was utilized by the <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serb</b> political leadership {{as a reason to}} start road blockades in protest. Further political and social deterioration, leading to the Bosnian War followed.|$|R
5|$|As the JNA {{disengaged}} in Croatia, its personnel {{prepared to}} set up a new Bosnian Serb army, as <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serbs</b> declared the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 9 January 1992, ahead of the 29 February – 1 March 1992 referendum on independence of Bosnia and Herzegovinawhich would later be cited as a pretext for the Bosnian War. <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serbs</b> set up barricades in the capital, Sarajevo and elsewhere on 1 March, and the next day the first fatalities of the war were recorded in Sarajevo and Doboj. In the final days of March, the Bosnian Serb army started artillery attacks on Bosanski Brod, and the HV 108th Brigade crossed the border adjacent to the town in reply. On 4 April, Serb artillery began shelling Sarajevo. Even though the war originally pitted <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serbs</b> against non-Serbs in the country, it evolved into a three-sided conflict {{by the end of the}} year, as the Croat–Bosniak War started. By that time, the Bosnian Serb army—renamed Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) after the Republika Srpska state proclaimed in the Bosnian Serb-held territory—controlled about 70% of Bosnia and Herzegovina. That proportion would not change significantly over the next two years. Republika Srpska was involved in the Croatian War of Independence in a limited capacity, through military and other aid to the RSK, occasional air raids launched from Banja Luka, and most significantly through artillery attacks against urban centres.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} Graz agreement, {{negotiated}} by <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serbs</b> and Bosnian Croats aiming to partition Bosnia and Herzegovina in early May, proclaimed {{cessation of hostilities}} between the two groups, heavy fighting broke out between the HVO and the VRS in June, in eastern Herzegovina (Operation Jackal), and in the Sava River basin (Operation Corridor 92), {{in the north of}} Bosnia and Herzegovina.|$|E
5|$|In April, the <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serbs</b> {{were able}} to deploy 200,000 troops, {{hundreds}} of tanks, armoured personnel carriers (APCs) and artillery pieces. The Bosnian Croats could field approximately 25,000 soldiers {{and a handful of}} heavy weapons, while the Bosniaks were largely unprepared for combat with nearly 100,000 troops, but small arms for less than half of their number and virtually no heavy weapons.|$|E
5000|$|A {{temporary}} {{absence of}} <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serb</b> leader Ratko Mladic, {{at a time}} in 1995 when <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serb</b> forces were withdrawing near Sarajevo under an agreement with NATO, was ascribed by some sources to [...] "diplomatic illness".|$|R

5|$|In September 1991, <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serbs</b> proclaimed a Serbian Autonomous Oblast with Bijeljina as its capital. In March 1992, the Bosnian {{referendum}} on independence was passed with overwhelming support from Bosniaks and Bosnian Croats, although <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serbs</b> either boycotted it or were prevented from voting by Bosnian Serb authorities. A poorly organized, local Bosniak Patriotic League paramilitary group {{had been established}} {{in response to the}} Bosnian Serb proclamation. On 31 March, the Patriotic League in Bijeljina was provoked into fighting by local Serbs and the SDG. On 1–2 April, the SDG and the JNA took over Bijeljina with little resistance; murders, rapes, house searches, and pillaging followed. These actions were described as genocidal by the historian Professor Eric D. Weitz of the City College of New York. Professor Michael Sells of the University of Chicago concluded that they were carried out to erase the cultural history of the Bosniak people of Bijeljina.|$|E
5|$|As the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska narodna armija – JNA) {{withdrew from}} Croatia {{following}} the acceptance and start of {{implementation of the}} Vance plan, its 55,000 officers and soldiers born in Bosnia and Herzegovina were transferred to a new Bosnian Serb army, which was later renamed the Army of Republika Srpska (Vojska Republike Srpske – VRS). This reorganisation followed the declaration of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 9 January 1992, ahead of the 29 February – 1 March 1992 referendum on the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

5|$|While {{incurring}} significant casualties {{fighting the}} Black Legion, the Chetnik movement in eastern Bosnia {{benefited from the}} mass desertion of Partisans and the many pro-Chetnik coups in Partisan and volunteer detachments. Despite their lack of unity, the Chetnik movement thrived in eastern Bosnia for the reminder of 1942 because some Chetnik leaders made accommodations with the Ustaše regime and as many Chetniks and Partisans were unwilling to kill fellow <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serbs</b> of the opposing faction.|$|E

On 4 April 1992, JNA artillery began shelling Sarajevo. There were other examples of the JNA directly supported the VRS, such as during the capture of Zvornik in early April 1992, when the JNA provided artillery support from Serbia, firing across the Drina River. At the same time, the JNA attempted to defuse the situation and arrange negotiations elsewhere in the country.|$|E
5|$|The Mittal Steel company {{purchased}} the Omarska mining complex {{and planned to}} resume extraction of iron ore from the site. Mittal Steel announced in Banja Luka on 1 December 2005 that the company would build and finance a memorial in the 'White House' but the project was later abandoned. Many <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serbs</b> believe {{there should not be}} a memorial, while many Bosniaks believe that construction should be postponed until all the victims are found and only if the entire mine—which is in use—be allocated for the memorial site.|$|E
5|$|U.S. Air Force A-10 {{aircraft}} fired approximately 10,000 30mm {{rounds in}} Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1994–95. Following {{the seizure of}} some heavy weapons by <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serbs</b> from a warehouse in Ilidža, a series of sorties were launched to locate and destroy the captured equipment. On 5 August 1994, two A-10s located and strafed an anti-tank vehicle. Afterward, the Serbs agreed to return remaining heavy weapons. In August 1995, NATO launched an offensive called Operation Deliberate Force. A-10s flew close air support missions, attacking Bosnian Serb artillery and positions. In late September, A-10s began flying patrols again.|$|E
5000|$|The US Department of State {{reported}} that Muslim and Mujahedin irregular troops [...] "had routinely performed crude, disfiguring, nonmedical circumcisions on <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serb</b> soldiers." [...] One 18-year-old <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serb</b> soldier [...] "was so brutally circumcised that eventually the entire organ required amputation." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{offensive}} {{resulted in}} 178 dead, 588 wounded and 41 captured ARBiH troops. <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serb</b> losses were 900 killed {{and more than}} 1,000 wounded. In September and October, 6,500 Bosniak and Croat civilians living {{in the area of}} Banja Luka or Prijedor were expelled from their homes by <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serb</b> forces. Changes of control of territory also allowed access to two mass graves near Sanski Most, believed to contain the bodies of 300 civilians killed by <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serb</b> forces in April 1992.|$|R
50|$|On 1 September, NATO and the UN {{demanded the}} lifting of the siege, removal of heavy weapons from the heavy weapons {{exclusion}} zone around Sarajevo, and complete security of other UN safe areas. The <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serb</b> leaders were given a deadline of 4 September, and the Operation Deliberate Force bombing campaign was suspended. Heavy weapons had not been removed when the deadline passed. On 5 September, air strikes resumed on <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serb</b> positions around Sarajevo and near the <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serb</b> headquarters at Pale.|$|R
5|$|Following its {{successful}} defence of Bosanski Brod in March, the HVO, {{reinforced by}} HV troops, pushed the JNA and the VRS south {{from the town}} and captured the towns of Modriča and Derventa {{by the end of}} May. The capture of Derventa also severed the last road available to the <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serbs</b> spanning VRS-controlled western Bosnia around Banja Luka and the VRS-held territory in the east of the country, adjacent to Serbia. That prevented the supply of Banja Luka as well as the bulk of the territory gained by the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK) and Croatian Serbs in Croatia since the initial phase of the Croatian War of Independence.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{disagree}} {{on the number of}} Bosnian Croat and HV casualties. Their number is variously reported as 160 or 177 killed. The <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serbs</b> and the JNA sustained losses of 85 killed and 154 taken prisoner of war. The JNA also captured 23 Bosnian Croat TO troops. The figures are reported to include 19 civilian deaths on each side. Even though the Serbian media initially reported that the villages of Gornji Malovan and Donji Malovan had been torched and razed to the ground, the information proved to be incorrect—the settlements sustained relatively minor damage. Conversely, Croat- or Bosniak-inhabited villages were looted and torched. Zlosela suffered extensive damage—the village school was the only structure with a roof left in place.|$|E
5|$|After O'Grady {{was shot}} down, {{tensions}} increased greatly between NATO and the <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serbs.</b> A number of US commanders called for immediate retaliatory air strikes; however, the Serbs still held {{the majority of}} the hostages seized after the bombing of Pale. The threat to the hostages prevented NATO from acting more forcefully, and the Serbs released 121 hostages immediately after the incident in an effort to cool tensions. Nonetheless, the situation remained explosive for the next six days until O'Grady was rescued on 8 June by the 3rd Battalion 8th Marines 2nd Marine Division, ending the calls for immediate offensive action. Shortly thereafter, the Serbs released the remaining hostages. As a result of the incident, NATO ordered that all further sorties be accompanied by aircraft designed for suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD).|$|E

At the same time, the JNA and the Bosnian Serb forces clashed with the HVO at the Kupres Plateau, capturing Kupres by 7 April.|$|E
5|$|Ethnic {{cleansing}} in Bosnia and Herzegovina {{happened on}} a larger scale than in the RSK, and all the major ethnic groups became victims of ethnically motivated violence. The conflict produced a vast number of displaced persons. It is estimated that there were over a million refugees in areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina outside VRS control at the end of 1994, while the area's total population was about 2.2 million. About 720,000 Bosniaks, 460,000 Serbs and 150,000 Croats fled the country. Croatia hosted {{a large proportion of the}} Bosniak and Croat refugees; by November 1992 there were around 333,000 registered, and an estimated 100,000 unregistered, refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina in Croatia. The refugees left their homes under varied circumstances. The ethnic violence committed by <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serbs</b> against civilians resulted in the greatest number of civilian victims in the Bosnian war, culminating in the 1995 Srebrenica massacre.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, the Croat-Bosniak {{conflict}} {{erupted in}} Bosnia and Herzegovina, just as each was {{fighting with the}} <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serbs.</b> The war was originally fought between the Croatian Defence Council and Croatian volunteer troops {{on one side and}} the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) on the other, but by 1994, the Croatian Army had an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 troops involved in the fighting. Under pressure from the United States, the belligerents agreed on a truce in late February, followed by a meeting of Croatian, Bosnian, and Bosnian Croat representatives with US Secretary of State Warren Christopher in Washington, D.C. on February 26, 1994. On March 4, Franjo Tuđman endorsed the agreement providing for the creation of Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and an alliance between Bosnian and Croatian armies against the Serb forces.|$|E
50|$|In a BBC documentary, called The Death of Yugoslavia, {{and later}} in his {{testimony}} before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia during the trial of Slobodan Milošević, Yugoslav official Borisav Jović revealed that the <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serb</b> army arose from the Yugoslav army forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina. He claimed that he had realized that Bosnia and Herzegovina {{was about to be}} recognized by the international community, and since Yugoslav People's Army troops were still located there at that point, their presence on Bosnian territory could have led to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia being accused of aggression. To avoid this, he and Milošević decided to move all JNA soldiers originating from Serbia and Montenegro back into Serbia and Montenegro, and to move all JNA soldiers of <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serb</b> descent to Bosnia and Herzegovina. In this way, every <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serb</b> was transferred from the Yugoslav army to what became the newly created <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serb</b> Army. Through this, the <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serb</b> army also received extensive military equipment and full funding from the FRY, as the <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serb</b> faction alone could not pay for the costs. Furthermore, Serbian Radical Party founder and paramilitary Vojislav Šešelj claimed that President Milošević personally asked him to send paramilitaries into Bosnia and Herzegovina.|$|R
5000|$|Ethnic {{cleansing}} {{was carried}} out on orders from the <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serb</b> leader Radovan Karadžić and the military commander General Ratko Mladić and as elsewhere in Bosnia, persecution and mass murder was overseen by a local <b>Bosnian</b> <b>Serb</b> [...] "Crisis Committee", under the presidency of Branimir Savović.|$|R
