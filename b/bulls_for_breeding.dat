This information can then be used to select superior bulls for a larger number of females, which thereby improves the efficiency of production. A breeding soundness evalua-tion (BSE) provides an opportunity to select against low fertility as well as to improve fertility in both males and females. It has been shown that bulls with large testicles at an early age tend to have male offspring with larger testicles and female offspring that are more fertile than progeny from bulls with small testicles.

Farm sizes were 9. 3 ± 6. 7 acres in tethering system and 4. 3 ± 2. 6 acres in zero-grazing. Fifty-four percent of the zero-grazing herds had animal housing facilities. All farmers in tethering system kept cows on earthen floors and calves without bedding. Hygiene level in existing farms was low. Majority of calves were fed once a day by restricted suckling (77 %). Seventy-four percent of tethered cows were only fed on natural grass, while cows under zero-grazing system had a more diversified diet but with 82 % feeding mainly Napier grass. Most farms (87 %) used <b>bulls</b> <b>for</b> <b>breeding.</b> Milk production was higher (P < 0. 05) in zero-grazing (6. 5 L/cow/day) than tethering system, and higher (P < 0. 05) for Holstein-Friesian crossbred cows (5. 2 L/cow/day) than local breed cows (2. 6 L/cow/day).

40|$|A {{socio-economic}} {{survey was conducted}} in three districts;- Kirinyaga, Rachuonyo and Nakuru within the Kenya highlands in February to May 2004. The objective {{of the study was}} to assess demand for breeding services of smallholder dairy farmers. The major constraints experienced by the respondents in this study were lack of adequate improved breeding facilities and the relatively high prices charged by the inseminators for the local and imported semen. Other constraints included the long distance to inseminators and service centres. Cost and availability of AI services were rated as major constraints by 51 % and 47 % respectively of the respondents. If resource-poor households are to continue to benefit from dairy production, a better understanding is required of the population, herd structures and dynamics in the smallholder sub-sector including the breeding (reproductive management and replacement) strategies of the smallholders. The majority of the smallholder dairy farms has few hectares and rear a small herd of less than ten heads of cattle. This calls for the need to intensify the farming system so as to obtain maximum yields. Before liberalization, the government of Kenya was solely involved in the management of Artificial Insemination (AI) services. However operational inefficiencies and budgetary constraints undermined service provision and AI services began to decline. In 1992, the sector was liberalized and the private sector stepped in to boost the AI service provision. However, with continued government involvement, tne - private sectors' performance has shown a downward trend in the past decade that needs to be studied to suggest policy recommendations. Investigations into what factors smallholder farmers put into consideration when choosing breeding bulls were also carried out.

LarsonThe {{selection}} of young replacement animals {{can have a}} significant impact on beef herd reproductive performance. Replacement heifers can be utilized to improve reproductive performance by replacing mature animals that failed to meet the production with young, cycling heifers that can have the potential of improving the reproductive momentum of a herd. The use of yearling bulls in natural breeding herds has the advantage of shortening the generational interval of the herd and has the potential of reducing the cost per cow exposed as additions to the bull battery. This thesis involves two studies that investigated methods used for the {{selection of}} peripubertal replacement animals in beef herds. The first study evaluated the ability of the novel Ready-Intermediate-Problem (RIP) replacement heifer evaluation matrix to classify heifers into groups that allow producers to select for replacements that meet production goals. Beef heifers (n= 341) were classified according to the RIP matrix guidelines and then exposed to AI breeding, bull breeding, or a combination of both as per the management plans for each participating herd. Following breeding season the heifers were evaluated to determine pregnancy status, pregnancy status to single AI exposure, days bred, and the number of 21 day cycles needed during breeding season to become pregnant. After breeding season, 298 (87 %) of the heifers were pregnant, 204 (68 %) of which became pregnant in the first 21 days of the breeding season. Probability of overall pregnancy and pregnancy after single AI exposure was not significantly associated with RIP classification. There was a significant interaction in RIP classification by 21 day cycle. The second study was a retrospective study using BSE result data to determine the proportion of yearling beef bulls that are classified as satisfactory potential breeders when reevaluated after failing their initial breeding soundness evaluation (BSE) and to identify any predictive factors at initial BSE for satisfactory performance at revaluation. The study included 2, 805 beef bulls between 11 and 14 months of age at first BSE evaluated at KABSU from 2006 to 2014. Generalized linear mixed models were created to assess potential associations among breed, age, and interaction between breed and age and passing the initial evaluation and identify predictive factors for risk of passing BSE after initial failure. The majority (93 %) of the study bulls passed one of up to three BSEs. There was a significant interaction between age and breed of bull at initial BSE. Identification of suitable peripubertal replacement animals that will improve herd reproductive performance remains a challenge for producers. There are several factors that can affect replacement animals’ ability to perform according to expectations at the beginning of the breeding season. Classification of heifers into categories that can predict performance during breeding season with reasonable confidence can assist producers in identifying heifers that complement the reproductive performance goals of the herd. Utilizing BSE to identify bulls that have adequate semen quality as well as other traits important for breeding soundness is similarly important in reducing the risks of using young <b>bulls</b> <b>for</b> <b>breeding...</b>|$|E

40|$|Background BVD and IBR are {{contagious}} viral diseases highly {{prevalent in}} Irish cattle. Despite their significant reproductive and economic impact {{very little is}} known about the BVD and IBR status of stock bulls (a <b>bull</b> used <b>for</b> <b>breeding</b> purposes). There are still a high proportion of dairy farms in Ireland that rely on the use of a <b>bull</b> <b>for</b> <b>breeding</b> cattle and ensuring the fertility of the bulls is of paramount importance for the efficiency of the farms. The prevalence of BoHV- 1 and BVD in stock bulls in Irish dairy herds has never been investigated. The objectives of this study therefore were: (i) to provide descriptive, observational data on the use of stock bulls on Irish dairy farms; (ii) to investigate the BVD and BoHV 1 status of a sub-set of stock bulls; (iii) to investigate factors associated with BVD and BoHV 1 status of stock bulls and (iv) to investigate factors associated with dairy herd status for BVD and BoHV 1, including any associations with the use of stock bull. A total of 529 blood samples from bulls involved in the dairy breeding process were analysed for BVD virus using RT-PCR, and BoHV- 1 antibodies by ELISA test. A total of 305 different dairy herds took part in the study and the overall BVD and BoHV- 1 herd status was determined by ELISA using four bulk tank milk samples over the 2009 lactation. Logistic regression was used to investigate the associations between the stock bulls and BVD and BoHV- 1 herd and individual status. Results Of the 305 total participating farms, 235 farms (77  %) had at least one bull and 167 farms had purchased bulls. Two bulls (0. 4  %) out of 529 tested were found positive for BVD virus and 87 (16. 7  %) tested seropositive for BoHV- 1. Some significant associations were identified between the purchase of bulls and both viral diseases. Purchased bulls were three times more likely to be seropositive for BoHV- 1 than homebred bulls. In the same way, herds with purchased bulls were three times more likely to be classified as seropositive for BVD and four times more likely to have evidence of recent BoHV- 1 circulation than farms where all the bulls were homebred. Conclusions The prevalence of BoHV- 1 and BVD in stock bulls in Irish dairy herds has never been investigated. This study highlights the widespread use of stock bulls in Irish dairy herds, as well as the high rate of exchange of bulls between farms. Significant associations were found between the origin of the bull and their serological BoHV- 1 status.

40|$|Coccidiosis is a {{protozoan}} {{infection that}} affects most domestic species: canine, feline, equine, porcine, bovine, ovine, lagomorphs and avian. The overall {{objective of this}} study was to determine the prevalence and spatial distribution of coccidia infection in cattle, and associated factors in different production systems in Busia, Bungoma and Siaya Counties Kenya. Specific objectives were to determine the prevalence and spatial distribution of coccidia infection in cattle as well as assess the factors associated with the infection in these Counties Kenya. The three Counties covered by the study were purposively selected for this study on prevalence of coccidia infection in cattle and associated factors in ‘unorganised’ production systems given that studies done in Kenya have concentrated on zero grazing and dairy production units. Also, being that this was part of a larger project in these areas (People Animals and their Zoonoses – PAZ); the three Counties were logistically favourable. The non-animal factors considered included: season, rainfall, housing, geographical location hygiene, nutrition, activity of the animals, and keeping of various species and veterinary attention. Animal related factors considered were: breed, age, gender, and physiological status (pregnant/lactating), body condition, and other infections. Households were then selected randomly using ArcMap 2. 0 software to generate random points (and a back-up for each random point) within the study area. From the random point, the closest homestead within 300 m was selected for sampling. Spatial distribution of coccidian infection in these Counties was done using QGIS 2. 0. 1 software for mapping. Data on nutrition, seasons, housing, disease occurrence, veterinary attention, herd profile and use of the animals were obtained using questionnaire interviews. From the clinical examination, physiological status (lactating, pregnant), concurrent infections and presence of other endoparasites and ectoparasites were ruled in or out. Faecal samples (at least 5 gm) were collected directly from the rectum via digital extraction using lubricated gloves. Samples were analysed using McMaster and Kato Katz techniques. R Statistical software was used for univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis of prevalence of coccidiosis in relation to various factors at p= 0. 1 and p= 0. 05 respectively. A total of 983 cattle were sampled from 416 households in all 3 Counties. Of this study population, 66 % were female; about 273 cows had calved before in their life time at the time of study, 42. 6 % of these had calved within one year from the time of study. Prevalence of coccidia infection obtained using McMaster technique was 32. 76 % while Kato Katz technique indicted a prevalence of 8. 75 %. Given that these tests used different principles, the agreement was very weak with a calculated Kappa of 0. 272 and a standard error of 0. 029 (p= 0. 05). All significant variables at p= 0. 1 were then modelled in logistic regression model at p= 0. 05 with a backward elimination approach. These variables included: age, sex/gender, prophylactic treatment, regular vet visits, ploughing, treatment, lice and tick infestation. Only age was found to be statistically significant in explaining coccidia infection in cattle. Older animals were 0. 71 times less likely to suffer from coccidiosis relative to younger animals. Clustering of bovine coccidia infection in space was evident with the resulting heat map indicating hotspots in South of Busia and North of Busia. Relationship between these clusters and geographical features revealed increased disease occurrence observed along river basins. This study showed that coccidia infection in cattle is prevalent in Busia, Bungoma and Siaya Counties at 32. 76 %. However coccidiosis in these three Counties presents in the subclinical form and thus no characteristic /overt clinical signs. Age was negatively associated with disease, a higher prevalence Oocysts per Gram count (OPGs) was observed in younger animals. Breed, level of activity, use of <b>bulls</b> <b>for</b> <b>breeding,</b> physiological status and concurrent infections were not significantly associated with infection at p= 0. 05. Good medical attention should be given to the calves and animals less than 30 months of age. Since the husbandry methods currently practised do not predispose cattle to coccidia infection, introduction of more intense farming methods may be accommodated only if high levels of hygiene are observed. Clustering of coccidia infection in cattle in Busia, Bungoma and Siaya Counties around wet lands and rivers indicated that common watering points pose a risk as disease foci and therefore farmers should be advised to water their animals from the homesteads or use clean water for their animals...|$|E
40|$|ICTs can now {{be found}} in the most {{unlikely}} places. In Botswana´s southern Kweneng and Kgatleng districts, they are even to {{be found in the}} stomachs of more than 135, 000 cattle. The cattle are participants in an initiative of the Ministry of Agriculture called the Livestock Identification Trace-back System (LITS), which aims to ensure that cattle in Botswana can be individually identified and traced throughout their lives. The system has been introduced to enable Botswana to comply with new regulatory procedures required by the European Union, which accounts for 80 to 90 % of Botswana´s beef exports. The regulations, imposed following the outbreaks of foot and mouth disease in Europe, stipulate that all imports of deboned beef must be traceable from the packing plant back to the individual farms in the country of origin. Thus, exporting countries must set up and maintain a database on the production, distribution, processing and sale of meat products. LITS employs radio frequency identification (RFID) technology to capture data on individual cattle, which is transmitted directly, error-free, to a central database. The database enables Botswana´s meat export agency to obtain EU certification for its beef exports (see elsewhere in this issue), and is a key repository of information for livestock farmers, as well as for state veterinary services and health authorities. LITS is being implemented by AST Botswana and Inala Identification and Control (South Africa). The first phase, completed in 2001, involved the development of the database and the identification of all cattle in two pilot districts. In the second phase the system is being extended, and will eventually be the world´s largest livestock tracking, monitoring and management system using RFID technology, involving an estimated 3 million head of cattle. RFID technology At the core of the system is a bolus containing a transponder that is, with the aid of an applicator, inserted into each animal´s rumen. Each bolus carries a unique ID number and other data that can be read by fixed or portable readers and relayed to the database. Fixed readers, placed at over 300 strategic locations, scan the ID numbers and relay information on, for example, new registrations and disease treatments to 46 district offices. Extension officers are equipped with hand-held readers that allow them to collect data on cattle in their ´crushes´ or kraals. The convenience, speed and accuracy of the LITS system have brought many benefits for Botswana´s livestock farmers, veterinary officers and health authorities. It can be used to locate lost or stolen cattle, and to monitor and manage disease outbreaks. The stomach bolus is safe for the animals, there are few field losses, criminal tampering is not possible, and it is easy to read because it is always in the same place. Also, the bolus is retrieved at the slaughterhouse and can be recycled, keeping costs low. It is a vast improvement on passive livestock identification systems such as ear tags, which require animals to be checked manually until the correct one is found. Locating a dozen cattle that require treatment from a herd of 200 used to be very time consuming. Now, all the animals simply file between two RFID readers, and a control gate automatically guides the required cattle into an isolation pen. New ways of working LITS has encouraged everyone involved in livestock management to be more thorough and to be creative in finding new ways of working and monitoring performance. Veterinary officers, for example, can now: rapidly isolate animals for treatment; update health records at the point of treatment; track weight gain in selected animals; correlate feeding programmes with yield; select specific <b>bulls</b> <b>for</b> <b>breeding</b> programmes; and track animal family trees. Livestock are not only valuable assets, they are also the start of a food supply chain with serious consequences in terms of health and profitability if the risks are not properly managed. RFID technology can make a significant contribution to the auditing of livestock lifecycles for many purposes, ranging from improving yield and optimizing feeding regimes, to ensuring conformance with EU regulations. The LITS initiative has demonstrated the direct and immediate benefits that can be achieved through the application of established and emerging technologies. In Botswana the system is helping to ensure the long-term security of its beef export market and offers an additional marketing edge, enabling the country to compete worldwide for new export orders. The same principles are now being used to assist sheep and ostrich farmers in South Africa. mailto:tinus@inala. co. za Tinus Burger is a member of the LITS implementation team.

40|$|A closed herd of 765 Holstein-Friesian {{dairy cattle}} {{with a history}} of {{multiple}} cases of leukosis was tested for antibodies to bovine leukemia virus by the bovine leukemia-glycoprotein immunodiffusion test. A total of 355 animals (46. 4 %) were antibody positive. Prevalence was 60 % in the 373 milking cows and 100 % in the breeding bulls. Antibodies were present in 59 % of newborn calves. Prevalence of antibodies was higher in older animals and cows in second lactation had a higher prevalence than cows in first lactation (72 % vs 43 %). Proposed control measures in this herd aim at preventing infection of calves, heifers and lactating cows by: 1) separating them into groups negative and positive for bovine leukemia virus antibodies, 2) not allowing calves to receive colstrum or milk from infected cows and 3) by using seronegative <b>bulls</b> <b>for</b> natural <b>breeding</b> tested at three month intervals. Calves should be tested after six months of age. Before this time calves of positive mothers should be treated as being positive...|$|R
40|$|Overabundant {{populations of}} elk (Cervus elaphus) are a {{significant}} concern {{in some areas of}} the western United States because of potential ecologic damage and spread of brucellosis to domestic livestock. Brucella abortus is transmitted among elk through direct contact with aborted fetuses, placentas and associated fluids, or postpartum discharge of infected animals. Because transmission of brucellosis is dependent on pregnancy, contraception of cows could be used for both disease and population management. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the contraceptive efficacy of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone vaccine (GonaConTM) in female elk. In September 2004, cows were given a single immunization of either 1, 000 μg (n = 12) or 2, 000 μg (n = 10) of GonaConTM and compared with a group of adjuvant-treated controls (n = 15). In November 2004, 2005, and 2006, cows were grouped with <b>bulls</b> <b>for</b> the <b>breeding</b> season. Blood samples were taken in February 2005 and March 2006 and 2007 for pregnancy testing, progesterone assays, and antibody titers.

2500|$|Cow is {{in general}} {{use as a}} {{singular}} for the collective cattle, despite the objections by those who insist {{it to be a}} female-specific term. Although the phrase [...] "that cow is a bull" [...] is absurd from a lexicographic standpoint, the word cow is easy to use when a singular is needed and the sex is unknown or irrelevant – when [...] "there is a cow in the road", for example. Further, any herd of fully mature cattle in or near a pasture is statistically likely to consist mostly of cows, so the term is probably accurate even in the restrictive sense. [...] Other than the few <b>bulls</b> needed <b>for</b> <b>breeding,</b> the vast majority of male cattle are castrated as calves and slaughtered for meat before the age of three years. [...] Thus, in a pastured herd, any calves or herd bulls usually are clearly distinguishable from the cows due to distinctively different sizes and clear anatomical differences. Merriam-Webster, a US dictionary, recognizes the sex-nonspecific use of cow as an alternate definition, whereas Collins and the OED, UK dictionaries, do not.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{stillborn}} premature Holstein calf was necropsied. The calf had severely reduced {{body weight}} and shortening of the vertebral column. The limbs appeared long and thin. Radiography and computer tomography scanning were performed, demonstrating malformation of the vertebral column. In addition, malformation of the kidneys, testicles, and heart {{was found at}} necropsy. Histologically, absence or incomplete development of intervertebral discs and complete or partial fusion of the epiphyses of adjacent vertebrae were found. In some areas, diaphyses of adjacent vertebrae were fused due to absence of epiphyses and intervertebral discs. Disturbed ossification of epiphyses in the appendicular skeleton was also present. The etiology of this syndrome was not identified. An inherited cause is possible due to a close relationship between the parents. Key words: Brachyspina; cattle; malformation; short spine lethal syndrome. A stillborn male Holstein calf weighing 6. 4 kg was delivered after a gestation period of 270 days by a 6 K-year-old cow. The sire was a purebred Holstein <b>bull</b> used <b>for</b> <b>breeding</b> by artificial insemination. The cow had previously been bred to other sires and given birth to four unaffected calves. In 2004, 96 calvings occurred in the herd. The stillborn calf was severely growth-retarded, with shortening of the cervical and thoracic parts of the spina...|$|R

Even if these Belgian and French Blue breeds are related because of their common {{ancestors}} in the former Mid and High Belgium cattle, these breeds diverged slightly under differentiated selection objectives in both countries. Within the BLUESEL project, a first aim consists to create a working group cross-border which will develop common guidelines <b>for</b> selection of <b>bull</b> dams and elite-matings for this dual-purpose Blue Breeds. This working group will create and help to conserve a common pool of <b>bulls</b> available <b>for</b> <b>breeding</b> in both countries. The project will also develop tools to harmonize the collection of phenotypic data (milk production and morphology). A joint genetic evaluation for production traits will be developed, adapted to the specifities of these breeds and integrating data provided by both countries. Others objectives of BLUESEL are the implementation of a technical and economical guidance of these farms and the improvement of profitability of farms through advice on management and on improvement of livestock. The valorisation of these breeds through the development of new and specific products (e. g. cheese products) is another objective. In summary, the whole project should contribute maintaining biodiversity in this cross-border region through conservation and use of animals naturally adapted. The BLUESEL project was launched in July 2008. It is conceived for four years and is supported by the European Union, the Walloon Region, the Nord-Pas-de Calais Region and the General Council of Department of Nord...|$|R
40|$|Plasma {{progesterone}} profiles {{were used}} to monitor post-partum reproductive activity in 12 Small East African Zebu (Bos indicus) cows allocated to either supplementary or no supplementary feeding (control) with continious or restricted (twice daily) suckling regimes. Intact <b>bulls</b> were used <b>for</b> <b>breeding.</b> Blood samples were collected 3 {{times a week for}} 33 weeks to determine blood metabolite concentrations. Plasma progesterone levels remained below 1 ng/ml until week 12 post-partum. Only 5 cows showed ovarian activity over the 33 week period. Cows that cycled expressed irregular and short-lived progesterone rises lasting 8 to 12 days prior to establishment of normal patterns of progesterone secretion where progesterone levels ranged from 8 to 10 ng/ml in cows with normal cycles. Plasma total protein, albumin, globulin, blood urea nitrogen and glucose levels varied over time without consistent trends, and were not influenced by either supplementary feeding of suckling regimes, nor differed between cyclic and acyclic cows. It was concluded that extended post-partum anoestrus, conception failure and early embryonic mortality were responsible for lowered reproductive efficiency in zebu cows. Blood metabolite concentrations were not good indicators of nutritional status and were not related to post-partum ovarian activity...|$|R
