5|$|The Prussian army {{marched in}} two columns toward Kay, {{one on the}} road {{directly}} to Kay, {{and the other on}} the road to Mosau. <b>Barely</b> <b>had</b> they emerged from the ravines surrounding the town when they fell into combat with some Russian skirmishers. The Prussians repulsed the initial group, but the arrival of reinforcement meant the onset of generalized action. The Russians subsequently fired on the Prussians from the heights surrounding Kay. General Heinrich von Manteuffel took six battalions and attacked on the artillery; initially they threw him back. A contemporary participant maintained that Manteuffel succeeded in over-running the positions and took 40 pieces of cannon, but there is no official evidence to support his statement. There were three assaults at Kay in that afternoon, and each was thrown back.|$|E
5|$|When the 20-year-old Sue Ellen Shepard {{wins the}} title of Miss Texas in 1967, she meets her future husband, J.R. Ewing, who is a judge for the pageant. After a courtship, they marry on February 15, 1970, but after several years, their {{marriage}} deteriorates, {{due in large part}} to J.R.'s numerous extramarital affairs and his disinterest in her. In 1978, a lonely Sue Ellen begins an affair with J.R.'s nemesis, Cliff Barnes. Shortly thereafter, Sue Ellen finds herself pregnant and believes that Cliff is the father because she and J.R. had been married for years without conceiving, and by this point, they <b>barely</b> <b>had</b> marital relations. Sue Ellen believes she loves Cliff, but is unable to leave J.R. To console herself, she starts drinking heavily during her pregnancy. Worried about the safety of her unborn child, J.R. has Sue Ellen committed to a sanitarium in 1979, to gain sobriety. However, Sue Ellen manages to continue drinking and escapes from the sanitarium drunk and crashes a car. While in the hospital, she gives birth to a son, John Ross Ewing III. After her son's birth, Sue Ellen becomes severely depressed and shows no interest in the child.|$|E

At the same time, Ogawa was completing his dive with his Zero through the AA fire, aiming for the flight deck near the bridge of the ship to cause the most damage, as kamikaze pilots were trained to do. At nearly a vertical dive, Ogawa dropped his 550-lb bomb just before impact with the flight deck, crashing near the island at about 10:05 hours.|$|E
25|$|The Ottoman {{squadron}} had set anchor at the Gulf of Girolata {{to distribute}} the booty from the recent raid. Dragut had chosen the place because it was deserted and far from the common sailing routes. As such, he left no ship to guard {{the entrance of the}} gulf. On arriving in the waters nearby, Gianettino Doria sent his relative Giorgio Doria into the gulf with 6 galleys and a small rowing frigate in order to identify the anchored galleys. Accounts of the battle's course differ. According to Cesáreo Fernández Duro and Julien de la Gravière, the Ottoman seamen and soldiers were ashore, sleeping under the trees or having a meal, when the arrival of the Spanish galleys took them by surprise. According to De La Gravière, 600 Ottomans fled to the surrounding mountains before the battle actually started and Dragut <b>barely</b> <b>had</b> time to embark and fire a single volley before the Genoese and Spanish boarded his flagship and his other galleys. At the first shots, many of his men, whether Turks, Moors or European renegades, jumped overboard to escape inland.|$|E

500|$|... "A New Day in the Old Town" [...] was co-written by {{consulting}} producer Akiva Goldsman and co-creator J.J. Abrams, with Goldsman also {{serving as}} director. In the DVD special features, actor Joshua Jackson explained {{the second season}} begins {{less than a day}} after the previous season's finale, [...] "so the characters have only just <b>barely</b> <b>had</b> a chance to catch their breath from all the madness in the first season, and launch right back into the second one". Co-executive producer Jeff Pinkner considered beginning the second season directly after first season's final scene between Olivia and William Bell, but changed his mind because {{he thought it would be}} more interesting to show how Olivia's disappearance and reappearance affected the Fringe team, as well as the rest of the season. The scene between Olivia and Bell is consequently not shown until the season's fourth episode, [...] "Momentum Deferred". The premiere began the [...] "gun arc" [...] storyline, which commenced with Olivia hurtling out of her SUV and becoming too weak to control her gun during her physical recovery, and ended with the killing of the shapeshifter posing as Charlie Francis in [...] "Momentum Deferred".|$|E
500|$|Reviewer James Berardinelli {{found the}} {{production}} of Doomsday to be a mess, complaining, [...] "The action sequences might be more tense if they weren't obfuscated by rapid-fire editing, and the backstory is muddled and not all that interesting." [...] Berardinelli also believed the attempted development of parallel storylines {{to be too much}} for the film, weakening the eventual payoff. Dennis Harvey of Variety said Neil Marshall's [...] "flair for visceral action" [...] made up for Doomsdays lack of originality and that the film <b>barely</b> <b>had</b> a dull moment. He added, [...] "There's no question that Doomsday does what it does with vigor, high technical prowess and just enough humor to avoid turning ridiculous." [...] Harvey considered the conclusion relatively weak, and found the quality of the acting satisfactory for the genre, while reserving praise for the [...] "stellar" [...] work of the stunt personnel. Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle also praised the film's stunts, noting that it was reminiscent of [...] "the beauty of the exploitation film era". Hartlaub said of the effect, [...] "Hire a couple of great stuntmen and a halfway sober cinematographer, and you didn't even need a screenwriter." ...|$|E

500|$|Mick Taylor, who had by {{this time}} {{obtained}} a reputation for himself by playing with John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers, was invited to work on Let It Bleed. The band enjoyed his contributions and decided to make him an offer to join full-time. After considering this for a few days, he accepted, and his position was officially announced {{at a press conference}} in the park's bandstand on 13 June. The single [...] "Honky Tonk Women," [...] recorded on 1 June with Taylor, was rush-released to tie in with the festival date. The Hyde Park concert would be Taylor's first gig with the band, and as they had <b>barely</b> <b>had</b> any time to rehearse with him he was understandably nervous, though he later stated that he felt the others, who were far closer to Jones than him, would feel more emotionally drained. Jagger, too, was nervous, unsure whether Jones's fans would take to Taylor and indeed whether they would boycott the concert; he did not expect the crowd to match the 150,000 who had come to the Blind Faith gig. In addition, the hot summer had sent the pollen levels soaring and Jagger suffered from hay-fever and laryngitis {{in the days leading up}} to the concert.|$|E

[...] Speaking of the Mister Freeze mission, Carter called the exploration of Freeze's relationship with his wife Nora [...] "compelling" [...] and enjoyed the fact it was the only [...] "Season of Infamy" [...] mission to feature a predator challenge. Additionally, he added that the Batmobile sequence had [...] "more of a reason to exist than most of the ones in the campaign." [...] Finally, Carter called the Ra's al Ghul mission [...] "the other highlight of the pack" [...] and felt the choice the mission gave players at the end was [...] "pretty interesting". He also added the setting of Elliot General Hospital was a good way to highlight Hush's family legacy since his [...] "part in [...] was extremely disappointing".|$|E
500|$|Modern Life Is Rubbish was {{released}} in the United States by Blur's American record label SBK in December 1993—seven months after the album's UK release. This delay was because SBK's alternative-music department had closed down; Blur manager Chris Morrison later quipped, [...] "When I asked [...] why, {{they said it was}} because the girl had left." [...] Despite fears that Modern Lifes overt Englishness would be lost on the American market, SBK insisted on marketing the album to MOR stations and aimed for Top 40 airplay. The label largely ignored Morrison's arguments that Blur's best chance of exposure in America would be to court college radio-stations. SBK's strategy was to list the album at a developing-artist price (around three dollars less than standard), send the band on an intensive tour in 1994 and to target modern rock airplay with debut single [...] "Chemical World". The record company believed this would help expand on the base audience who bought Leisure, and eventually open Blur to Top 40 radio. Further, to lessen the anglocentric feel of the record, SBK added additional songs to the track-listing—including [...] "Popscene". The plan fared rather poorly, as Modern Life <b>barely</b> <b>had</b> any impact in the US; the album didn't chart on the US Billboard 200 and sold only 19,000 copies, a sharp decline compared to the 87,000 units that Leisure shifted.|$|E
