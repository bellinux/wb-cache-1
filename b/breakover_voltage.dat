40|$|Polymethyl {{methacrylate}} (PMMA) -BN nanotube (BNNT) composites were fabricated {{and their}} mechanical and thermal properties were analyzed. Using a 1 [*]wt. % BNNTs fraction in a polymer, {{the elastic modulus}} of PMMA was increased up to 19 %. In addition, thermal stability and glass transition temperature of PMMA were also positively affected. The thermal conductivity of PMMA with BNNT additions increased three times. The resultant BNNT-PMMA composites possess the high electrical <b>breakover</b> <b>voltages.</b> Thus our studies clearly indicate that BNNTs are promising nanofillers for improvement of mechanical and thermal conductivity of dielectric polymers under preservation of their electrical insulation...|$|R
40|$|The {{electrical}} properties of multi p-n junction devices are analyzed. It is {{found that this}} type of device possesses bistable characteristics similar to that of a Shockley diode and thus provides an alternative realization of devices for switching applications. The inherently greater current gains involved in the operations of such a device yield in principle higher <b>breakover</b> <b>voltages</b> and higher holding currents. Furthermore, the incorporation of heterostructures in this device introduces a new degree of freedom in tailoring their switching characteristics. Multi p-n heterojunction devices operating as SCR lasers were fabricated, and the experimental results are presented...|$|R
50|$|A Silicon Diode for Alternating Current (SIDAC) {{is a less}} {{commonly}} used device, electrically similar to the DIAC, but having, in general, a higher <b>breakover</b> <b>voltage</b> and greater current handling capacity.|$|E
50|$|In {{this mode}} of operation, the anode is given a {{positive}} voltage while the cathode is given a negative voltage, keeping the gate at zero potential i.e. disconnected. In this case junction J1 and J3 are forward-biased, while J2 is reverse-biased, due to which only a small leakage current exists from the anode to the cathode until the applied voltage reaches its breakover value, at which J2 undergoes avalanche breakdown, and at this <b>breakover</b> <b>voltage</b> it starts conducting, but below <b>breakover</b> <b>voltage</b> it offers very high resistance to the current and {{is said to be}} in the off state.|$|E
50|$|Most DIACs have a three-layer {{structure}} with <b>breakover</b> <b>voltage</b> of approximately 30 V. Their behavior {{is similar to}} that of a neon lamp, but it can be more precisely controlled and takes place at a lower voltage.|$|E
50|$|The SIDAC {{is another}} member of the {{thyristor}} family. Also referred to as a SYDAC (Silicon thYristor for Alternating Current), bi-directional thyristor breakover diode, or more simply a bi-directional thyristor diode, it is technically specified as a bilateral voltage triggered switch. Its operation {{is similar to that of}} the DIAC, but SIDAC is always a five-layer device with low-voltage drop in latched conducting state, more like a voltage triggered TRIAC without a gate. In general, SIDACs have higher <b>breakover</b> <b>voltages</b> and current handling capacities than DIACs, so they can be directly used for switching and not just for triggering of another switching device.|$|R
50|$|Lightning arresters {{are rated}} by the peak current they can withstand, {{the amount of}} energy they can absorb, and the <b>breakover</b> <b>voltage</b> that they require to begin conduction. They are applied as part of a {{lightning}} protection system, in combination with air terminals and bonding.|$|E
50|$|Trisil is a {{trade name}} for a {{thyristor}} surge protection device, an electronic component designed to protect electronic circuits against overvoltage. Unlike a transient voltage suppression diodes, such as Transil, a Trisil acts as a crowbar device, switching ON when the voltage on it exceeds its <b>breakover</b> <b>voltage.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{operation}} of the SIDAC is functionally {{similar to that of}} a spark gap, but is unable to reach its higher temperature ratings. The SIDAC remains nonconducting until the applied voltage meets or exceeds its rated <b>breakover</b> <b>voltage.</b> Once entering this conductive state going through the negative dynamic resistance region, the SIDAC continues to conduct, regardless of voltage, until the applied current falls below its rated holding current. At this point, the SIDAC returns to its initial nonconductive state to begin the cycle once again.|$|E
50|$|SCR can {{be brought}} from {{blocking}} mode to conduction mode in two ways: either by increasing the voltage across anode to cathode beyond <b>breakover</b> <b>voltage</b> or by applying positive pulse at gate. Once SCR starts conducting, no more gate voltage is required to maintain it in the on state. There {{are two ways to}} turn it off: 1. Reduce the current through it below a minimum value called the holding current and 2. With the gate turned off, short out the anode and cathode momentarily with a push-button switch or transistor across the junction.|$|E
5000|$|Quadracs are {{a special}} type of {{thyristor}} which combines a [...] "diac" [...] and a [...] "triac" [...] {{in a single}} package. The diac is the triggering device for the triac. Thyristors are four-layer (PNPN) semiconductor devices that act as switches, rectifiers or voltage regulators {{in a variety of}} applications. When triggered, thyristors turn on and become low-resistance current paths. They remain so even after the trigger is removed, and until the current is reduced to a certain level (or until they are triggered off). Diacs are bi-directional diodes that switch AC voltages and trigger triacs or silicon-controlled rectifiers (SCRs). Except for a small leakage current, diacs do not conduct until the <b>breakover</b> <b>voltage</b> is reached. Triacs are three-terminal, silicon devices that function as two SCRs configured in an inverse, parallel arrangement. They provide load current during both halves of the AC supply voltage. By combining the functions of diacs and triacs, quadracs eliminate the need to buy and assemble discrete parts.|$|E

These switches exhibit the lowest ever reported values of rise and fall times, {{for this kind of}} switches, of about 3 ns. They also exhibit a temperature and light reversibly controlled forward <b>breakover</b> <b>voltage</b> (VBF), together with high values of light triggering sensitivity...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In high current, high voltage, high {{temperature}} (T> 125 °C) power applications, commercially available conventional silicon thyristors are not suited because they present high leakage current. In this context, {{this paper presents}} a high symmetrical (voltage) thyristor structure that presents a lower leakage current and higher <b>breakover</b> <b>voltage</b> {{as compared to the}} conventional thyristor at T> 125 °C. It is shown through 2 D physical simulations that the replacement of the P emitter of a standard symmetrical thyristor by a judicious association of P diffusions and Schottky contacts at the anode side contributes to the reduction of the leakage current in the forward blocking state at {{high temperature}}. A fine-tune of the anode side configuration will improve the forward off-state behaviour with only a negligible on-state voltage drop degradation. Moreover, the comparison with the conventional anode short thyristor shows that the insertion of Schottky contacts leads to the same improvements in terms of off-state forward <b>breakover</b> <b>voltage</b> and leakage current and also presents a high reverse blocking voltage.

40|$|A {{monolithic}} 10 x 10 {{two-dimensional array}} of 'optical neuron' optoelectronic threshold elements for neural network applications has been designed, fabricated, and tested. Overall array dimensions are 5 x 5 mm, while the individual neurons, composed of an LED that {{is driven by}} a double-heterojunction bipolar transistor, are 250 x 250 microns. The overall integrated structure exhibited semiconductor-controlled rectifier characteristics, with a <b>breakover</b> <b>voltage</b> of 75 V and a reverse-breakdown voltage of 60 V; this is attributable to the parasitic p-n-p transistor which exists {{as a result of}} the sharing of the same n-AlGaAs collector between the transistors and the LED...|$|E
40|$|Transient surge {{voltages}} are a {{major cause}} of poor reliability in telecom applications. Designers face the importance of having to protect the circuitry while maintaining overall performance and cost. With many different manufacturers and naming conventions of protection devices the task of choosing the proper solution can become challenging. One of the most common misunderstandings is a Sidactor; also know as a Thyristor Surge Protection Device (TSPD) versus Sidac. Both Sidactors and Sidacs are voltage triggered switches but the Sidactor or TSPD is used to protect telecom lines from high current levels and a Sidac is mainly intended to be used more as a triggering device. TSPD {{is one of the most}} reliable semiconductor devices used for reducing telecom infrastructure overvoltage issues. The TSPD is a silicon structure device typically manufactured on a n-type substrate. TSPD is equivalent of two SCR's “connected ” in anti-parallel, which allows the flow of the electric current in both directions. The TSPD is capable of draining a surge current pulse to ground when transient voltage appears in between its two terminals, this occurs when the maximum <b>breakover</b> <b>voltage</b> of the device is reached. The device typically operates symmetrically, protecting in the positive and negative direction. The TSPD turns from the off-state to the on-state based on the breakdown and <b>breakover</b> <b>voltage</b> levels that appear between the two main terminals. The devices have a current and voltage curve that has “snap back ” affect, where the breakover is high, while the clamping voltage is low, basically a short, after the device turns-on giving it high surge abilities. Figure 1 shows the symbol for a TSPD or SIDAC: The TSPD is a crowbar device, meaning it has two states of functionality: Open Circuit and Short Circuit. Open Circuit: TSPD remain transparent during normal circuit operation. The device looks like an open across the two wire lines...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{investigated}} {{a methodology}} to design light-triggered thyristors thanks to TCAD. The simulation model accuracy, especially the holding current and the minimum incident light intensity to turn-ON, {{were compared with}} experimental results. The influence of SiC epitaxial layer lifetime and the incident light properties (wavelength and intensity) on the optically triggered 4 H-SiC thyristor characteristics have been studied by simulation. We considered the wavelength dependence of quantum efficiency, penetration depth, and photon energy. The holding current and turn-ON time depends on the lifetime. The minimum intensity to turn-ON the device significantly depends on the wavelength. This intensity becomes less than 0. 003 times when the wavelength changed from 380 to 325 nm. In addition, the <b>breakover</b> <b>voltage</b> {{is affected by the}} constant incident light even if the intensity is tiny...|$|E

40|$|Three {{subjects}} {{related to}} epitaxial GaAs-GaAlAs optoelectronic devices {{are discussed in}} this thesis. They are: 1. Embedded Epitaxy This is a technique of selective multilayer growth of GaAs- Ga 1 -x Al x As single crystal structures through stripe openings in masking layers on GaAs substrates. This technique results in prismatic layers of GaAs and Ga 1 -x Al x As "embedded" in each other and leads to controllable uniform structures terminated by crystal faces. The dependence of the growth habit on {{the orientation of the}} stripe openings has been studied. Room temperature embedded double heterostructure lasers have been fabricated using this technique. Threshold current densities as low as 1. 5 KA/cm 2 have been achieved. 2. Barrier Controlled PNPN Laser Diode It is found that the I-V characteristics of a PNPN device can be controlled by using potential barriers in the base regions. Based on this principle, GaAs-GaAlAs heterostructure PNPN laser diodes have been fabricated. GaAlAs potential barriers in the bases control not only the electrical but also the optical properties of the device. PNPN lasers with low threshold currents and high <b>breakover</b> <b>voltage</b> have been achieved. Numerical calculations of this barrier controlled structure are presented in the ranges where the total current is below the holding point and near the lasing threshold. 3. Injection Lasers on Semi-Insulating Substrates GaAs-GaAlAs heterostructure lasers fabricated on semi-insulating substrates have been studied. Two different laser structures achieved are: (1) Crowding effect lasers, (2) Lateral injection lasers. Experimental results and the working principles underlying the operation of these lasers are presented. The gain induced guiding mechanism is used to explain the lasers' far field radiation patterns. It is found that Zn diffusion in Ga 1 -x Al x As depends on the Al content x, and that GaAs can be used as the diffusion mask for Zn diffusion in Ga 1 -x Al x As. Lasers having very low threshold currents and operating in a stable single mode have been achieved. Because these lasers are fabricated on semi-insulating substrates, it is possible to integrate them with other electronic devices on the same substrate. An integrated device, which consists of a crowding effect laser and a Gunn oscillator on a common semi-insulating GaAs substrate, has been achieved. </p...|$|E
