5|$|No. There’s {{always going}} to be two sides to {{everything}}. For me, everything that I did with the Harajuku Girls was just a pure compliment and being a fan. You can’t be a fan of somebody else? Or another culture? Of course you can. Of course you can celebrate other cultures. That’s what Japanese culture and American culture have done. It’s like I say in the song: it’s a ping-pong match. We do something American, they take it and they flip it and make it so Japanese and so cool. And we take it back and go, “Whoa, that’s so cool!” That’s so beautiful. It’s a <b>beautiful</b> <b>thing</b> in the world, how our cultures come together. I don’t feel like I did anything but share that love. You can look at it from a negative point of view if you want to, but get off my cloud. Because, seriously, that was all meant out of love.|$|E

To answer this by saying that he was a great architect is not to answer at all…what is more important is that he was a most kindhearted, most considerate, gentle and manly man, who could no more have done the things attributed to him than he could have roasted a baby on a spit. Big in mind and in body, he was incapable of little meanness. He admired a beautiful woman as he admired every other <b>beautiful</b> <b>thing</b> God has given us; and his delight over one was as keen, as boyish, as grateful over any others.|$|E

The game's controls {{were one of the}} main concerns during development. The idea was to retain a character-based game, where players could see the character they were playing, while keeping the tightness and accuracy of first-person shooters. Rare initially attempted to automate the change of view and targeting mode based on the context of the action, but this idea was eventually replaced with a manual system.

500|$|The poem {{is one of}} five {{surviving}} {{poems by}} Sappho which is about [...] "the power of love". [...] It expresses the speaker's desire for the absent Anactoria, praising her beauty. This encomium follows the poet making the broader point that the most <b>beautiful</b> <b>thing</b> to any person is whatever they love the most; an argument that Sappho supports with the mythological example of Helen's love for Paris. [...] Some commentators have argued that the poem deliberately adopts this position as a rejection of typical Greek male values. [...] The poem follows a chiastic structure, beginning with a preamble, moving through to the mythical exemplum of the story of Paris and Helen, and returning to the subject of the preamble for the concluding stanza.|$|E

Candide buys their freedom and further passage at steep prices. The baron and Pangloss relate how they survived, but despite the horrors he has been through, Pangloss's optimism remains unshaken: [...] "I still hold to my original opinions, because, after all, I'm a philosopher, and it wouldn't be proper for me to recant, since Leibniz cannot be wrong, and since pre-established harmony is the most <b>beautiful</b> <b>thing</b> in the world, along with the plenum and subtle matter." ...|$|E
500|$|Lynch has {{mentioned}} {{that he tried to}} avoid thinking about the morality of the narrative, or how it would be received by censors or critics, feeling that if he allowed that worry to affect him it would ultimately drive him to create something that made him uncomfortable, preferring instead to simply produce the episode he wanted to and be prepared to defend it if necessary. He has also compared the search for Laura's killer to the central narrative of the 1960s television series The Fugitive, which featured an ongoing search for a one-armed man. Contrasting the two, Lynch stated [...] "each week, you know, they [...] hardly ever dealt with that. And that's the <b>beautiful</b> <b>thing.</b> You keep wondering, 'When will he find this guy and set everything straight?' But then you knew it would be the end".|$|E

500|$|Sappho 16 is a {{fragment}} of a poem by the archaic Greek lyric poet Sappho. [...] It is from Book I of the Alexandrian edition of Sappho's poetry, and is known from a second-century papyrus discovered at Oxyrhynchus in Egypt {{at the beginning of}} the twentieth century. [...] Sappho 16 is a love poem – the genre for which Sappho was best known – which praises the beauty of the narrator's beloved, Anactoria, and expresses the speaker's desire for her now that she is absent. [...] It makes the case that the most <b>beautiful</b> <b>thing</b> in the world is whatever one desires, using Helen of Troy's elopement with Paris as a mythological exemplum to support this argument. [...] The poem is at least 20 lines long, though it is uncertain whether the poem ends at line 20 or continues for another stanza.|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly ranked Blue Velvet's soundtrack [...] on {{its list}} of the 100 Greatest Film Soundtracks, at the 100th position. Critic John Alexander wrote, [...] "the {{haunting}} soundtrack accompanies the title credits, then weaves through the narrative, accentuating the noir mood of the film."

[...] Badalamenti's success with Blue Velvet would lead him to contribute to all of Lynch's future full-length films until Inland Empire and the cult television program Twin Peaks. Also included in the sound team was long time Lynch collaborator Alan Splet, a sound editor and designer who had won an Academy Award for his work on The Black Stallion (1979), and been nominated for Never Cry Wolf (1983).|$|E
500|$|In The Sun Also Rises, Hemingway {{contrasts}} Paris with Pamplona, and {{the frenzy}} of the fiesta with the tranquillity of the Spanish countryside. [...] Spain was Hemingway's favorite European country; he considered it a healthy place, and the only country [...] "that hasn't been shot to pieces." [...] He was profoundly affected by the spectacle of bullfighting, writing, It isn't just brutal like they always told us. It's a great tragedy—and the most <b>beautiful</b> <b>thing</b> I've ever seen and takes more guts and skill and guts again than anything possibly could. It's just like having a ringside seat at the war with nothing {{going to happen to}} you. He demonstrated what he considered the purity in the culture of bullfighting—called afición—and presented it as an authentic way of life, contrasted against the inauthenticity of the Parisian bohemians. To be accepted as an [...] aficionado was rare for a non-Spaniard; Jake goes through a difficult process to gain acceptance by the [...] "fellowship of afición." ...|$|E

[...] This struggle was confirmed by the author John le Carré, who met Hoffman during the adaptation of his novel A Most Wanted Man.

500|$|The artwork for Follow the Leader {{was done}} by Todd McFarlane Entertainment, with McFarlane and fellow Image Comics artists Greg Capullo (penciller) and Brian Hagelin (colorist) doing the album cover, and {{designer}} Brent Ashe handling the graphics work. According to drummer David Silveria, the band got interested in McFarlane after hearing that [...] "Todd had actually referred to us as 'the Doors of the 90's'", leading to them recording a song for Spawn, a film based on a comic book by McFarlane, and eventually approaching the artist to make an album cover for them. The cover art depicts a child hopscotching off a cliff and a gathering of kids waiting to follow, a concept that begun with bassist Reginald [...] "Fieldy" [...] Arvizu and sketched by a friend of Jonathan Davis before being submitted to McFarlane. It marked the third straight Korn cover featuring children in a disturbing context, which Davis explained by saying that [...] "Children are always scared when they're all happy and stuff.

[...] Beinhorn encouraged the band to expand their musical horizons on the album, and although the band were initially uncomfortable stepping out of their comfort zone, the members began to feel that Beinhorn was helping them produce their best work. [...] Slovak helped Kiedis record his vocals on the album.

[...] Slovak reflected on his deep connection to the album in his diary; [...] "It was so fun. [...] I'm so extremely proud of everybody's workit is at times genius." [...] During a jam session, the guitarist created a melodic riff which differed greatly in style from the band's previous work. [...] While Slovak nearly abandoned the riff {{out of fear that}} it {{was too much of a}} departure stylistically, Beinhorn saw potential in the new melody-based style and encouraged Slovak to turn the short tune into a full song. [...] While the band was skeptical at first, each member began writing their own musical parts and the song became one of the album's three singles, [...] "Behind the Sun".|$|E
