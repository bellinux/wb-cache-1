5|$|Darwin {{observed}} that the males of some species, such as <b>birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise,</b> were {{very different from the}} females.|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{explained}} such male-female {{differences in}} {{his theory of}} sexual selection in his book The Descent of Man. Once the females begin to select males according to any particular characteristic, such as a long tail or a coloured crest, that characteristic is emphasized {{more and more in}} the males. Eventually all the males will have the characteristics that the females are sexually selecting for, as only those males can reproduce. This mechanism is powerful enough to create features that are strongly disadvantageous to the males in other ways. For example, some male <b>birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise</b> have wing or tail streamers that are so long that they impede flight, while their brilliant colours may make the males more vulnerable to predators. In the extreme, sexual selection may drive species to extinction, as has been argued for the enormous horns of the male Irish elk, which may have made it difficult for mature males to move and feed.|$|E
5|$|On 20 February, Kroonland, {{continuing}} to sail for the American Line, returned to New York – Liverpool service after {{an absence of}} 18 months. As a ship of the still-neutral United States sailing in a war zone, Kroonland had her name painted in large letters {{on each side of}} her hull. The name was flanked on either side by large American flags and kept illuminated at night. In June, she carried US$1,500,000 of Argentine gold from London for deposit with the Guaranty Trust Company of New York. On late 1916, a cook aboard Kroonland was arrested for smuggling feathers, wings, and heads of <b>birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise</b> and crowned pigeons. The man, who was paid $300 for each load of feathers, smuggled in at least three loads of the avian contraband before his arrest. In January 1917, a jumble sale held in the saloon on Kroonland raised £73 15s 11d for The Times Fund, {{for the benefit of the}} British Red Cross and the Order of St. John.|$|E
50|$|Maria's <b>bird</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise,</b> {{also known}} as Frau Reichenow's <b>bird</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise</b> or Mrs Reichenow's <b>bird</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise,</b> is a <b>bird</b> in the family Paradisaeidae that is a {{presumptive}} hybrid between an emperor <b>bird</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise</b> and raggiana <b>bird</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise.</b> It was named for {{the wife of the}} describer, German ornithologist Anton Reichenow.|$|R
50|$|The King <b>of</b> Holland's <b>bird</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise,</b> {{also known}} as King William III's <b>bird</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise</b> or the {{exquisite}} little king, is a bird in the family Paradisaeidae that is a hybrid between a magnificent <b>bird</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise</b> and king <b>bird</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the wild, the Empress <b>of</b> Germany's <b>bird</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise</b> is hybridized {{with the}} emperor <b>bird</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise,</b> {{with at least}} six {{specimens}} known. Thought {{to be a new}} species, the hybrid was named Maria's <b>bird</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise,</b> Paradisaea maria or Frau Reichenow's <b>bird</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise.</b>|$|R
25|$|Closely {{related to}} the <b>birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise</b> are the bowerbirds, a group of twenty rather drab, stocky and short-plumed birds found in New Guinea and Australia. They lack the bright and {{iridescent}} color and ornamental plumes found in the <b>birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise,</b> but the lack is compensated for with the male's architectural skill. The male builds and decorates an elaborate bower, ranging from mats, stick towers, avenued chambers to tipi-roofed huts and displays it to the females.|$|E
25|$|More recently, the {{grouping}} {{has been}} refined somewhat {{as the original}} concept of Corvida has proven paraphyletic. The narrower 'Core corvine' group now comprises the crows and ravens, shrikes, <b>birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise,</b> fantails, monarchs, drongos and mudnest builders.|$|E
25|$|The passerines of Australia, {{also known}} as songbirds or {{perching}} birds, include wrens, robins, the magpie group, thornbills, pardalotes, the huge honeyeater family, treecreepers, lyrebirds, <b>birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise</b> and bowerbirds. The satin bowerbird has attracted the interest of evolutionary psychologists; it has a complex courtship ritual in which the male creates a bower filled with blue, shiny items to woo mates.|$|E
50|$|Blood's <b>bird</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise,</b> {{also known}} as Captain Blood's <b>bird</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise,</b> is a <b>bird</b> in the family Paradisaeidae that is a hybrid between a raggiana <b>bird</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise</b> and blue <b>bird</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise.</b> It is named after Captain N.B.

50|$|Ruys' <b>bird</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise</b> is a <b>bird</b> in {{the family}} Paradisaeidae that is presumed to be an {{intergeneric}} hybrid between a magnificent <b>bird</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise</b> and lesser <b>bird</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise.</b>|$|R
25|$|The family Corvidae was {{introduced}} by the English zoologist William Elford Leach in {{a guide to the}} contents of the British Museum published in 1820. Over the years, much disagreement has arisen on the exact evolutionary relationships of the corvid family and their relatives. What eventually seemed clear was that corvids are derived from Australasian ancestors and from there spread throughout the world. Other lineages derived from these ancestors evolved into ecologically diverse, but often Australasian groups. In the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s, Sibley and Ahlquist united the corvids with other taxa in the Corvida, based on DNA–DNA hybridization. The presumed corvid relatives included currawongs, <b>birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise,</b> whipbirds, quail-thrushes, whistlers, monarch flycatchers and drongos, shrikes, vireos, and vangas, but current research favors the theory that this grouping is partly artificial. The corvids constitute the core group of the Corvoidea, together with their closest relatives (the <b>birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise,</b> Australian mud-nesters, and shrikes). They are also the core group of the Corvida, which includes the related groups, such as Old World orioles and vireos.|$|E
25|$|Aviaries and vivaria are {{arranged}} around {{the sides of}} the building; those on the upper level were originally designed for <b>birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise</b> and the hornbill aviaries were originally made for gorillas. The aviaries currently house birds such as great Indian hornbills, rhinoceros hornbills, two pairs of tarictic hornbill (one pure-bred and one hybrid), writhed-billed hornbills, red-crested turacos, Palawan peacock-pheasants, Congo peafowl, Bali starlings, blue-crowned pigeons, fairy-bluebirds, white-rumped shama, white-crested turacos, snowy-crowned robin chats, Mindanao bleeding-hearts Green Aracari and Luzon Scops Owls. At the entrance is an aviary for Sumatran laughingthrushes and grey-winged blackbird.|$|E
25|$|Influential {{evolutionary}} biologist Ernst Mayr came to New Guinea in 1928 to make collections for the American Museum of Natural History and {{banker and}} naturalist Walter Rothschild. Mayr collected several thousand bird skins (he named 26 new bird species during his lifetime) and, in the process, also named 38 new orchid species. He determined that New Guinea's rarest <b>birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise</b> were, in fact, hybrid species. During his stay in New Guinea, {{he was invited}} to accompany the Whitney South Seas Expedition to the Solomon Islands. Mayr's experience of the fauna of New Guinea informed many of his conclusions about evolution {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E

25|$|The passerines {{display the}} {{greatest}} amount of diversity with over 33 families within New Guinea. The passerines of New Guinea are mostly small, often colourful birds which mostly inhabit the forested regions. The best-known family in New Guinea is the Paradisaeidae, one of three families there known collectively as <b>birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise.</b> Many species show extravagant sexual dimorphism. The males can be ornamented with bright, iridescent colours, and modified, ornamental feathers such as tufts and wattles. They also display mating rituals, in which they undergo elaborate movements and calling, to attract females. Some species do not show sexual dimorphism; both male and female can have or lack ornamentation.|$|E
25|$|David Attenborough's work as {{an author}} has strong {{parallels}} with his broadcasting career. In the 1950s and 1960s, his published work included accounts of his animal collecting expeditions around the world, which became the Zoo Quest series. He wrote an accompanying volume to each of his nine Life documentaries, along with books on tribal art and <b>birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise.</b> His autobiography, Life on Air, was published in 2002, revised in 2009 {{and is one of}} a number of his works which is available as a self-narrated audiobook. Attenborough has also contributed forewords and introductions to many other works, notably those accompanying Planet Earth, Frozen Planet, Africa and other BBC series he has narrated.|$|E
25|$|Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) signed Healy and his Stooges {{to a movie}} {{contract}} in 1933. They appeared in feature films and short subjects, either together, individually, or with various combinations of actors. The trio was featured {{in a series of}} musical comedy shorts, beginning with Nertsery Rhymes. The short was one of a few shorts to be made with an early two-strip Technicolor process, including one featuring Curly without Healy or the other Stooges, Roast Beef and Movies (1934). The shorts themselves were built around recycled film footage of production numbers cut from MGM musicals, such as Children of Pleasure, Lord Byron of Broadway and the unfinished March of Time (all 1930), which had been filmed in early Technicolor. Soon, additional shorts followed (sans the experimental Technicolor), including Beer and Pretzels (1933), Plane Nuts (1933), Jail <b>Birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>Paradise</b> (1934) and The Big Idea (1934).|$|E

500|$|Based on the {{analysis}} of DNA–DNA hybridization data the genus was placed with the Paradisaeidae <b>birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise</b> by Sibley and Ahlquist. [...] Frith and Frith felt these conclusions were not supported by aspects of the behaviour and biology (although they argued {{it may have been}} related to the recently split Cnemophilidae <b>birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise).</b> More recent studies have refuted the relationship with the whipbirds and jewel-babblers, and instead consistently shown a relationship as the sister taxa to a group of families including the drongos, fantails, monarch flycatchers, Corcoracidae (the white-winged chough and apostlebird of Australia) and the <b>birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise</b> again. The fact that the melampittas do not closely resemble these families (except the Corcoracidae {{and to a lesser extent}} the <b>birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise)</b> may be due to adaptations to terrestrial living, compared to the other families which are mostly arboreal. Given the distinctiveness of the two melampittas it was suggested that the genus be placed its own family, and a new family, Melampittidae, was formally erected in 2014 by Richard Schodde and Leslie Christidis.|$|E

500|$|Three {{subspecies}} are recognised; [...] Rhipidura leucophrys leucophrys {{from central}} and southern Australia, the smaller R. l. picata from northern Australia, and the larger R. l. melaleuca from New Guinea and islands in its vicinity.

500|$|The willie wagtail is {{unrelated}} to the Eurasian wagtails of the family Motacillidae. It is one of 47 members of the fantail genus Rhipidura; some authorities classify this group of birds as a subfamily Rhipidurinae within the drongo family Dicruridae, together with the monarch flycatchers, while others consider them distinct enough to warrant their own family Rhipiduridae. Early molecular research in the late 1980s and early 1990s revealed that the fantails belong to {{a large group of}} mainly Australasian birds known as the parvorder Corvida comprising many tropical and Australian passerines. More recently, the grouping has been refined somewhat and the fantails have been classified in a [...] "core corvine" [...] group with the crows and ravens, shrikes, <b>birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>paradise,</b> monarch flycatchers, drongos and mudnest builders.|$|E
