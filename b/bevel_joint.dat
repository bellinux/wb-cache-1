50|$|Single {{butt welds}} {{are similar to}} a <b>bevel</b> <b>joint,</b> but instead of only one side having the beveled edge, {{both sides of the}} weld joint are beveled. In thick metals, and when welding can be {{performed}} {{from both sides of the}} work piece, a double-V joint is used. When welding thicker metals, a double-V joint requires less filler material because there are two narrower V-joints compared to a wider single-V joint. Also the double-V joint helps compensate for warping forces. With a single-V joint, stress tends to warp the piece in one direction when the V-joint is filled, but with a double-V-joint, there are welds on both sides of the material, having opposing stresses, straightening the material.|$|E

On the stress analysis of cylinder drum the bending theory of beam of finite length on elastic foundation is applied and the bending theory of thin plate for the circular plate. Experimental values of cylinder drum gives a good agreement to theoretical solution, but circular plate gives unsatisfactory results. After experiment within elastic limit performed test of breaking strength. The experimental results prove {{the criterion of}} yielding of Von Mises...|$|E
40|$|Background/purposeIn this study, we {{investigated}} the relative contributions of design factors to the fracture strength of provisional materials after repair. Materials and methodsThe Taguchi method {{was used to}} investigate the optimal design with respect to four different design factors: subject material, repair material, repair design, and connector thickness. Each factor was assigned three levels. Using the Taguchi L 9 orthogonal array, nine rectangular bar-shaped experimental specimens with different parameter combinations were fabricated (n= 5) and tested with a three-point bending test. The fracture load (in newtons) of each specimen group was recorded. The Taguchi method was employed to identify the significance of each design factor in controlling the fracture strength. The sensitivity of each design parameter was determined using an analysis of variance. Fractographic analysis was performed to identify the adhesive or cohesive failure mode for each specimen. ResultsThe mean effect of the design factors at each level was determined. The subject material, with a contribution percentage of as high as 33. 48 %, had the most dominant effect on the fracture strength of the repaired provisional restorations, followed by the repair material (31. 88 %), connector thickness (19. 70 %), and joint design (14. 94 %). The strongest subject material was bis-acryl Protemp 3 Garant. The polymethyl methacry late material, Tempron, was the preferred repair material. A 4 -mm connector thickness was the best level. A 45 ยบ <b>bevel</b> <b>joint</b> was superior to the butt or fiber joint. The predicted fracture strength of the optimum parameter combination (Protemp 3 Garant/ 45 ยบ bevel joint/Tempron/ 4 mm connector thickness) was 173. 34 N. From the fractographic analysis, different bonding abilities between the same and different resin materials were investigated. Fiber joint groups were nearly all in the cohesive mode without complete catastrophic fracture. ConclusionWithin the limitations of this study, these four design factors had different contributions to the fracture strength of repaired provisional restorations. Clinicians {{must be aware of}} the sequence of importance in determining better problem-solving methods...|$|E

The columns are carried beneath the floor line to rest on {{concrete}} block foundation walls. 2 x 8 in floor joists on 16 in centers carry the rough floor.The full-height exterior bay walls are of plate glass. The glass was shipped from Pittsburgh, on special order, by rail and delivered to the contractor at the site for erection. One of the panels, on the screen porch or {{south side of the}} living room wall, is capable of sliding open to a full door of 8 x 9 ft, by means of a continuous steel slide and steel barn door hangers.As stated above, the exterior materials used in the Horner House include naturally bleached heart redwood, <b>bevelled</b> <b>joint</b> cladding, always used vertically, and plate glass. The two-story core of the main house contains manufactured casement windows, transite spandrels and heads with redwood corners and facias. The doors are solid lumber core, stained and varnished.The screened porch is constructed of four built-up columns, suspended from the cantilevered ceiling joists. The floors are pine varnished. The copper screen has been attached with copper-headed nails to the uprights in 36" [...] horizontal bands and then hand-sewn with copper wire at the selvage edges to form a floor-to ceiling screen [...] "wall", in four bays, along its 32 ft length. The screens presently in place on the porch are original.|$|R
40|$|Objective: This {{randomized}} double-blind {{clinical trial}} compared {{the performance of}} posterior composite restorations with or without bevel, after 1 -year follow-up. Material and Methods: Thirteen volunteers requiring at least two posterior composite restorations were selected. Twenty-nine cavities were performed, comprising 14 without <b>bevel</b> (butt <b>joint)</b> and 15 with bevel preparation of the enamel cavosurface angle. All cavities were P 60). A halogen light curing unit was used through the study. Restorations were polished immediately. Analysis was carried out at baseline, after 6 months and after 1 year by a calibrated evaluator (Kappa), according to the FDI criteria. Data were statistically analyzedby Mann-Whitney test (p< 0. 05). Results: Beveled and non-beveled cavities performed similarly after 1 year follow-up, regarding to fractures and retention, marginal adaptation,postoperative hypersensitivity, recurrence of caries, surface luster and anatomic form performance (p< 0. 05) than butt joint restorations. Conclusions: It was concluded that the restorations were acceptable after 1 year, but restorations placed in cavities with marginal beveling showed less marginal staining than those placed in non-beveled cavities...|$|R
40|$|Duplex {{stainless}} steels (DSS) as alternatives to conventional austenitic {{stainless steels}} {{for the construction of}} pipelines is becoming more wide-spread, particularly for sour service applications where corrosion resistance / stress corrosion cracking resistance is required in aggressive chloride / sulphide environments. While these steels show many superior characteristics, limitations are associated with the welding of these steels, particularly controlling the weld structure and properties and understanding how the weld metallurgy may influence the susceptibility to intergranular corrosion (IGC). The focus {{of this paper is to}} report on the findings from a detailed study of the various weld sections within a DSS pipeline, as a function of heat input and type of weld, in terms of the metallurgical structure, composition and mechanical properties and to assess the susceptibility to IGC. Welding was performed using the manual Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) technique at both high and low heat input conditions. Two different join configurations (double bevel single V bevel and double <b>bevel</b> single U <b>joint</b> configuration) were adopted. Structural analysis consisted of (i) optical microscopy of welded specimens; (ii) ferrite content determination; (iii) Vickers hardness measurements; (iv) Charpy impact studies and (v) transverse tensile testing. Two test methods namely a modified ASTM A 262 and a modified Double Loop Electrochemical Potentiokinetic Reactivation (DL-ERP) test was used to determine susceptibility to IGC. The electrolyte solution used was 0. 5 M H 2 SO 4 + 0. 001 M TA (thioacetamide). The test was conducted at 60 ยบC. The potential was scanned from - 500 mV (SCE) to + 200 mV (SCE) and back to - 500 mV (SCE) at a rate of 1. 67 mV/s. The ratio of the reactivation charge to the passivation charge was calculated. From the results obtained it can be shown that the fill region was most susceptible to IGC for all weld conditions...|$|R
