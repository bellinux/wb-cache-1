5|$|Six {{years after}} the {{creation}} of the Sheffield Rules the Football Association rules were created.

5|$|Although {{built and}} {{initially}} operated as two separate stations {{by the two}} companies, the C and the CCE platforms were sufficiently close together that a deep level interchange was constructed between the passages of the two stations with a small ticket office for passengers changing between the lines. Another passage led to lifts that surfaced within the main line station itself. With the entrance within the main line station able to serve <b>both</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> platforms satisfactorily, the separate station buildings were considered unnecessary, and they both closed on 30 September 1914. The CCE building remains (converted for use as an electrical substation), but the C's building was demolished in 1934 to enable the construction of Euston House for the London, Midland and Scottish Railway.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 2008, {{a bridge}} {{replacement}} and expansion project got underway on Illinois 22 at the interchange with Interstate 94.

The old bridge, which was five lanes wide, was rebuilt with one that is eight lanes and includes full length dual left turn lanes in both directions. Other benefits are the improved entrances and exits {{to and from the}} interstate, modernized traffic signals, and the use of concrete pavement. The bulk of the work was completed by December 2009, however <b>both</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> dual left turn lanes were not in operation until the following spring.|$|E

5|$|In the League Cup, {{the clubs}} {{met in the}} quarter-final stage at Old Trafford in December and even though both sides fielded {{weakened}} teams, the match was not short of drama. David Bellion gave Manchester United the lead in just 19 seconds {{but it was not}} until the start of the second half that tempers began to flare. A fracas between Robin van Persie and Kieran Richardson, following a late tackle on Richardson by Van Persie, resulted in clashes from <b>both</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> players, which concluded with both protagonists getting booked by match official Mark Halsey. The game finished 1–0.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, {{owing to the}} success both {{domestically}} and in Europe of Aberdeen and Dundee United, the pair were known as the New Firm. However, Dundee United have their city neighbours Dundee as close rivals, and the antagonism was not always reciprocated to the same degree. The same situation applies to Aberdeen's rivalry with Rangers, in that Rangers have their own much older and well-known Old Firm rivalry with Celtic. Aberdeen's rivalry with Rangers arose {{after a number of}} incidents in matches between the two clubs in the 1980s, namely Willie Johnston's stamp on John McMaster's neck in the Scottish League Cup and Neil Simpson's tackle on Ian Durrant in 1988, as well as Aberdeen's dominance in Scottish football throughout the decade. There are still often violent clashes between <b>both</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> supporters within and outwith the stadium to this day.|$|E

He was educated at Fettes College, a boarding school in Edinburgh, making it into the school cricket team for four consecutive years.

Willie McKay commented that Brown was excited about playing for such a successful club and the chance to play in the UEFA Champions League. Brown was transferred for £4.4 million, the largest transfer fee exchanged between two Scottish clubs. The previous record was the £4 million transfer of Duncan Ferguson from Dundee United to Rangers.
