5|$|After {{decades of}} upheavals and rebellions mounted <b>by</b> <b>Arab</b> tribes in the Middle East, the Ottomans {{attempted}} to reassert centralized {{control over the}} Arab vilayets. In 1657, they sent an expeditionary force led mostly <b>by</b> <b>Arab</b> sipahi officers from central Syria to reassert Ottoman authority in Nablus and its hinterland, {{as part of a}} broader attempt to established centralized rule throughout the empire at that time. In return for their services, the officers were granted agricultural lands around the villages of Jabal Nablus. The Ottomans, fearing that the new Arab land holders would establish independent bases of power, dispersed the land plots to separate and distant locations within Jabal Nablus to avoid creating contiguous territory controlled by individual clans. Contrary to its centralization purpose, the 1657 campaign allowed the Arab sipahi officers to establish their own increasingly autonomous foothold in Nablus. The officers raised their families there and intermarried with the local notables of the area, namely the ulama and merchant families. Without abandoning their nominal military service, they acquired diverse properties to consolidate their presence and income such as soap and pottery factories, bathhouses, agricultural lands, grain mills and, olive and sesame oil presses.|$|E
5|$|Ashdod {{is home to}} the Israeli Andalusian Orchestra, which {{performs}} Andalusian classical music. It is an Arabic music {{style that}} originates from Moorish Iberia or Al-Andalus, has been jealously preserved in its original form <b>by</b> <b>Arab</b> and Jewish musicians of the Maghreb over the centuries, and has left its mark on the cante flamenco, the flamenco singing style, perhaps better known in the West. The orchestra was awarded the Israel Prize in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, serious {{divisions}} {{emerged in}} the Jordanian state over reactions to the Eisenhower Doctrine, which ostensibly aimed to stem Soviet expansion in the Middle East, but was viewed <b>by</b> <b>Arab</b> nationalists as a neo-colonialist ploy to control the region. Nabulsi and Foreign Minister Abdullah Rimawi, a Baathist, led the camp opposing the doctrine {{as a threat to}} Arab sovereignty and as means to control the region's oil assets and support Israel, while Hussein publicly embraced the doctrine as a preventive measure against growing communist influence in the country. Prior to these disagreements, Nabulsi had been clamping down on communist literature and influence in the press (the communists were generally opposed <b>by</b> <b>Arab</b> nationalists), whilst attempting to establish diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union (USSR) without Hussein's knowledge. To that end, he dispatched Abu Nuwar to Moscow in February 1957 to serve as an initial contact with the Soviets. Later, Nabulsi publicly declared his intention to establish relations with the USSR and pursue a political union with Egypt and Syria, and requested from Hussein a confirmation of his dismissal of several royalist officials. Hussein responded by forcing Nabulsi to resign on 10 April 1957.|$|E

5|$|The growing hardships in {{the country}} {{during the early years}} of World War I pushed Quwatli to join the secret society of al-Fatat, which was {{facilitated}} by his childhood friend and co-founder, Nasib al-Bakri. Al-Fatat was an underground organization established in Paris in 1911 <b>by</b> <b>Arab</b> nationalists with the aim of gaining independence and unity of the various Arab territories in the Ottoman Empire. In 1913, the society established its main branch in Damascus, and was successful in attracting the Syrian elite into its ranks.|$|E
5|$|Al-Kharrat {{was born}} to a Sunni Muslim family in Damascus in 1861, during Ottoman rule in Syria. He served as the night {{watchman}} of the city's al-Shaghour quarter and as a guard for the neighborhood's orchards. Damascus was captured <b>by</b> <b>Arab</b> rebels during World War I in October 1918. Afterward, the Arab Club, an Arab nationalist organization, emerged {{in the city to}} raise support for the rebels. The club assisted the rebels' leader, Emir Faisal, who formed a rudimentary government. Al-Kharrat became an affiliate of the Arab Club and raised support for Faisal in al-Shaghour. In July 1920, Faisal's government collapsed after its motley forces were defeated by the French at the Battle of Maysalun. Afterward, the French ruled Syria under the aegis of their League of Nations mandate.|$|E
5|$|Distressed by the {{occupation}} of Khafji, Saudi commander General Khaled bin Sultan appealed to American General Norman Schwarzkopf for an immediate air campaign against Iraqi forces {{in and around the}} city. However this was turned down because the buildings would make it difficult for aircraft to spot targets without getting too close. It was instead decided that the city would be retaken <b>by</b> <b>Arab</b> ground forces. The task fell to the 2nd Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigade's 7th Battalion, composed of Saudi infantry and two Kuwaiti tank companies attached to the task force. These were supported by U.S. Army Special Forces and Marine Reconnaissance personnel.|$|E

5|$|Hananu's revolt {{coincided with}} Turkish revolts against the French {{military}} presence in the Anatolian cities of Urfa, Gaziantep and Mar'ash. It also was related to Barakat's revolt in Antioch, which was captured and held <b>by</b> <b>Arab</b> guerrillas for a week starting on 13 March 1920. The French Air Force bombarded Antioch for 17 days until the rebels withdrew to Narlija. On 18 April, taking advantage of the diversion of French forces to Gaziantep where a major battle between French and Turkish forces was taking place, Hananu decided to attack the French garrison at Harim. With fifty of his irregulars, Hananu stormed the town. As word of his attack spread to nearby villages, his forces subsequently swelled to 400.|$|E
5|$|In {{front of}} the total failure of the attack, Shlomo Shamir ordered the retreat at 11.30 am. But this {{occurred}} on open ground under a heavy sun and the soldiers had no water. Numerous men were killed or injured <b>by</b> <b>Arab</b> fire. It was only at 2 pm that the first injured men reached the transport they had left in the morning. However, the Arab Legion didn't {{take advantage of this}} victory while, according to Benny Morris, it could easily have performed a counter-attack up to the Israeli headquarters located at Hulda.|$|E
5|$|In {{the center}} of Bethlehem is its old city. The old city {{consists}} of eight quarters, {{laid out in a}} mosaic style, forming the area around the Manger Square. The quarters include the Christian an-Najajreh, al-Farahiyeh, al-Anatreh, al-Tarajmeh, al-Qawawsa and Hreizat quarters and al-Fawaghreh — the only Muslim quarter. Most of the Christian quarters are named after the Arab Ghassanid clans that settled there. Al-Qawawsa Quarter was formed <b>by</b> <b>Arab</b> Christian emigrants from the nearby town of Tuqu' in the 18th century. There is also a Syriac quarter outside of the old city, whose inhabitants originate from Midyat and Ma'asarte in Turkey. The total population of the old city is about 5,000.|$|E

5|$|On the Byzantine side, Emperor Michael III had {{assembled}} his army {{to counter the}} Arab raid, and met them at a battle in an area called Marj al-Usquf ("Bishop's Meadow") <b>by</b> <b>Arab</b> sources, a highland near Malakopeia, north of Nazianzus. The battle was bloody with many casualties on both sides; according to the Persian historian al-Tabari, only a thousand of Umar's army survived. Nevertheless, the Arabs managed to escape the Byzantines and continue their raid north into the Armeniac Theme, eventually reaching the Black Sea and sacking {{the port city of}} Amisos. The Byzantine historians report that Umar, enraged at the sea blocking his advance, ordered it to be lashed, but this is most likely inspired by the similar account of Xerxes during the Persian Wars.|$|E

The division responded by immediately sending a troop of armoured cars from the 17th/21st Lancers to each village. By the afternoon the 1st Parachute Battalion had joined the battle and air support from the Royal Air Force was called in. The battle ended with the Arabs withdrawing; their casualties are not known. Nine Jews were killed or wounded by the Arabs, the British troops uninjured.|$|E
5|$|Though Mauritius had {{previously}} been visited <b>by</b> <b>Arab</b> vessels in the Middle Ages and Portuguese ships between 1507 and 1513, they did not settle on the island. The Dutch Empire acquired the island in 1598, renaming it after Maurice of Nassau, and it was used from then on for the provisioning of trade vessels of the Dutch East India Company. To the Dutch sailors who visited Mauritius from 1598 and onwards, the fauna was mainly interesting from a culinary standpoint. Of the eight or so parrot species endemic to the Mascarenes, only the echo parakeet (Psittacula echo) of Mauritius has survived. The others were likely all made extinct {{by a combination of}} excessive hunting and deforestation.|$|E

5|$|As the 1948 Arab-Israeli War commenced, the neighbourhood's {{location}} between Israeli and Jordanian forces made it {{a combat}} zone, leading to the flight of both Jewish and Arab residents. On May 22, 1948 the US Consul, Thomas C. Wasson, was assassinated shortly after leaving the French Consulate in the Mamilla district. After {{the signing of the}} 1949 Armistice Agreements and division of Jerusalem, the western three-quarters of Mamilla were held by Israel and the eastern quarter became a no man's land of barbed-wire and concrete barricades between Israeli and Jordanian lines. The active and hostile border subjected Mamilla to Jordanian sniper and guerilla attacks, and even stones thrown <b>by</b> <b>Arab</b> Legionnaires from the Old City walls above. The neighbourhood was one of several border areas in the city to experience a sharp decline, and subsequently became home to families of new immigrants with many children and of weak financial abilities, as well as dirty light industry like auto repair. In Mamilla in this period, the residents were primarily Kurdish immigrants and their Israeli children.|$|E
5|$|Hieroglyphs {{retained}} their pictorial appearance, {{and classical}} authors emphasised this aspect, {{in sharp contrast}} to the Greek and Roman alphabets. In the 5th century, the priest Horapollo wrote Hieroglyphica, an explanation of almost 200 glyphs. His work was believed to be authoritative, yet it was misleading in many ways, and this and other works were a lasting impediment to the understanding of Egyptian writing. Later attempts at decipherment were made <b>by</b> <b>Arab</b> historians in medieval Egypt during the 9th and 10th centuries. Dhul-Nun al-Misri and Ibn Wahshiyya were the first historians to study hieroglyphs, by comparing them to the contemporary Coptic language used by Coptic priests in their time. The study of hieroglyphs continued with fruitless attempts at decipherment by European scholars, notably Johannes Goropius Becanus in the 16th century, Athanasius Kircher in the 17th, and Georg Zoëga in the 18th. The discovery of the Rosetta Stone in 1799 provided critical missing information, gradually revealed by a succession of scholars, that eventually allowed Jean-François Champollion to solve the puzzle that Kircher had called the riddle of the Sphinx.|$|E
5|$|Hinduism is {{the major}} {{religion}} with about 80% of the population adhering to it. About 11% of the population follow Islam and 8% follow Christianity. Evidence of prehistoric religion in South India comes from scattered Mesolithic rock paintings depicting dances and rituals in Stone Age sites such as the Kupgal petroglyphs of eastern Karnataka. Hinduism, often regarded as the oldest religion in the world, traces its roots to prehistoric times in India. The main spiritual traditions of South India include both Shaivite and Vaishnavite branches of Hinduism, although Buddhist and Jain philosophies had been influential several centuries earlier. Ayyavazhi is spread significantly across the southern parts of South India. Islam was introduced to South India in the early 7th century <b>by</b> <b>Arab</b> traders in Malabar Coast of Kerala and spread during the rule of Deccan Sultanates from 17th to 18th century and the Muslims in Kerala of Arab descent are called Jonaka Mappila. Christianity was introduced to South India by Thomas the Apostle, who visited Muziris in Kerala in 52 CE and baptised Kerala's Jewish settlements. Kerala {{is also home to}} one of the oldest Jewish communities in the world who are supposed to have arrived in the Malabar coast during the reign of King Solomon.|$|E

5|$|His {{campaign}} against Ferghana {{was under way}} when news reached the army of Caliph Walid's death and the accession of his brother Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik to the throne. The new Caliph was a bitter enemy of Qutayba, for the latter had argued in favour of excluding him from the succession. Although Sulayman re-confirmed him in his position as governor, Qutayba feared that he would soon be removed. At the last, after negotiations with the new regime in Damascus failed, Qutayba resolved to rebel. The Khurasani Arabs refused to support him, and the native auxiliaries, although favourably disposed towards him, were prevented from declaring their support by Hayyan al-Nabati. Only his family, his fellow Bahili tribesmen and his bodyguard, the Archers, remained faithful. The opposition, led by the Tamim tribe, coalesced around their leader Waki ibn Abi Sud al-Tamimi. In August 715 (according to al-Tabari) or early 716 (according to Ibn Qutaybah), Qutayba {{and other members of}} his family were killed at Ferghana <b>by</b> <b>Arab</b> soldiers. Waki ibn Abi Sud succeeded him as governor, and ordered the army to return to Merv, where it was disbanded.|$|E
5|$|His {{loyalty to}} the Ottomans eroded, however, due {{to the impact of}} the new governments's Turkification {{policies}} which he viewed as repressive against his ideals. Because of his dissatisfaction with the Young Turks, Darwaza was driven to support Arab independence from the empire. In 1908, he joined the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), but withdrew soon after because of its Turkish nationalist political agenda. He played an active role in establishing a branch for the Party of Harmony and Freedom in Nablus in 1911. The party was founded in Istanbul and joined <b>by</b> <b>Arab</b> members to counter the policies of the CUP. In 1913, he joined a anti-Zionist group based in Nablus that sought to prevent the sale of Arab-owned land to Jews by submitting petitions to the Ottoman sultan, or by buying land for sale to preempt its purchase by Jews. In June 1913, he helped to prepare and became secretary of the First Palestinian Congress (also known as the Arab Congress of 1913) in Paris. In congress, he was also the delegate for the Jamma'in subdistrict of the District of Nablus. Meanwhile, Darwaza was still working in the DTPS.|$|E
5|$|Islam is also practiced on the island. Islam {{was first}} brought to Madagascar in the Middle Ages <b>by</b> <b>Arab</b> and Somali Muslim traders, who {{established}} several Islamic schools {{along the eastern}} coast. While the use of Arabic script and loan words and the adoption of Islamic astrology would spread across the island, the Islamic religion failed to take hold in {{all but a handful}} of southeastern coastal communities. Today, Muslims constitute 7–3percent of the population of Madagascar and are largely concentrated in the northwestern provinces of Mahajanga and Antsiranana. The vast majority of Muslims are Sunni. Muslims are divided between those of Malagasy ethnicity, Indians, Pakistanis and Comorians. More recently, Hinduism was introduced to Madagascar through Gujarati people immigrating from the Saurashtra region of India in the late 19th century. Most Hindus in Madagascar speak Gujarati or Hindi at home.|$|E
