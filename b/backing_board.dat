He takes an image from popular culture, uses a computer program to work out the precise disposition of the six colours for each image. He then manipulates nine pixels for each Rubik's Cube to give the required pattern, constructing a full image by stacking them, after which the cubes are glued to a <b>backing</b> <b>board.</b> A piece typically composed of approximately 300 cubes, measures about , and weighs approximately , but the exact size depends on the subject and its level of detail.|$|E

40|$|Fluorescent {{retroreflective}} materials {{increase the}} brightness of traffic signs. In construction work zones a benefit is expected from the increased conspicuity of fluorescent retroreflective signs. Fluorescent material can be used instead of non-fluorescent materials both for the advance warning signs that indicate {{the configuration of the}} upcoming work zone and for additional <b>backing</b> <b>boards</b> behind traffic signs, e. g. to attract attention to a posted speed limit sign. In a field experiment at a construction work zone on a motorway, conspicuity measurements during daytime showed that fluorescent retroreflective material doubled the conspicuity with respect to non-fluorescent material, corresponding to a daytime luminance which was twice as high. Driver behaviour in the approach area of a construction work zone was observed via video recordings during dusk, daylight and nighttime conditions. On consecutive days, three types of signing were installed in the approach area of the work zone: non-fluorescent signing (High Intensity Grade (HIG)), fluorescent signing (Diamond Grade (DG)) and the combination of fluorescent signing and <b>backing</b> <b>boards</b> (DG+BB). Driver behaviour was analysed in terms of speed (average speeds and percentage of vehicles entering the work zone at excessive speeds), Time-To-Collision (TTC), and lane changes. Results showed that fluorescent retroreflective material reduced the (very high) speeds during dusk conditions (especially during low ambient light conditions, fluorescent materials have a very bright appearance). At night, speeds increased with fluorescent signing. <b>Backing</b> <b>boards</b> behind the posted speed signs reduced average speeds and excessive speeds at the entry of the work zone during daytime. Without fluorescent <b>backing</b> <b>boards</b> more than 25 % of the cars drove faster than 100 km/h during daylight at the work zone entry, while with fluorescent <b>backing</b> <b>boards</b> only 10 % drove that fast. With respect to the interaction between vehicles, a decrease of the proportion of small TTCs during night showed that DG and DG+BB signing caused a shift into a safer direction, even though a speed increase was recorded at night in the condition with DG signing. Furthermore, during dusk and night, fluorescent <b>backing</b> <b>boards</b> reduced last minute lane changes. In daylight the opposite was found...|$|R

5000|$|When {{handling}} cased photographs such as daguerreotypes, albumen prints, and tintypes, especially {{ones that}} have been hand-coloured, caution is required. They are fragile and even minimal efforts to clean them can irreparably damage the image. Hand-coloured cased photographs should be stored horizontally, in a single layer, preferably faced down. Cases can be wrapped with alkaline or buffered tissue paper. If the photograph has become separated from its case, a mat and <b>backing</b> <b>board</b> can be cut from alkaline buffered museum board. The mat is placed between the image and a newly cut glass plate while the <b>backing</b> <b>board</b> supports the image from behind. This [...] "sandwich" [...] is then sealed with Filmoplast tape. Commercial glass cleaners {{should not be used}} on new glass plates. Loose hand-coloured tintypes can be placed between mat boards. If bent, no attempt should be made to straighten them as this could cause the emulsion to crack and/or lift.|$|E

50|$|Using good {{protective}} {{measures such as}} attaching a rigid backing to a painting on canvas provides several protections. It reduces the effects of rapid changes in relative humidity around the painting, provides some protection from pressure or direct contact against the canvas back, and protects from vibrations caused by handling or moving. <b>Backing</b> <b>boards</b> also serve to protect from dust and dirt, cracks and deformations from handling, and insect activity.

50|$|As a tile <b>backing</b> <b>board,</b> {{cement board}} has better {{long-term}} performance than paper-faced gypsum core products {{because it will}} not mildew or physically break down in the continued presence of moisture or leaks. Cement board is not actually waterproof, but it is highly resistant to absorbing moisture and has excellent drying properties. In areas continually exposed to water spray (i.e. showers) a waterproofing barrier is usually recommended behind the boards or as a trowel-applied product to {{the face of the}} boards behind the finish system.|$|E

It can be used on the exterior of buildings as a base for exterior plaster (stucco) systems and sometimes as the finish system itself.|$|E

50|$|Cement {{board is}} hung with {{corrosion}} resistant screws or ring-shank nails. Cement board {{has very little}} movement under thermal stress, but the boards are usually installed with a slight gap at joints in shower pans, bathtubs, and each other. These joints are then filled with silicone sealant or the manufacturer's taping compounds before applying a finish. The filled joints are taped like conventional gypsum board, but with fiberglass tapes that provide additional water resistance. Combined with a water impermeable finish, cement board is a stable, durable <b>backing</b> <b>board.</b>|$|E

50|$|Fuzzy-Felt is {{a simple}} fabric toy {{intended}} for young children. It was created in 1950 by Lois Allan of the United Kingdom. The toys consist of a flocked <b>backing</b> <b>board</b> onto which a number of felt shapes are placed to create different pictures. Felt pieces can be simple silhouettes or more detailed printed shapes. For a farmyard scene, for example, auxiliary pieces would typically be cows, sheep, chickens, horses, cats, dogs, a farmer, and a tractor. Other scenes might include hospital, pets, vehicles. Fuzzy-Felt is for children {{over the age of}} three years, as the pieces may present a choking hazard.|$|E
