40|$|The thermo-acoustic {{behaviour}} {{of multiple}} premixed laminar flames is analysed. The idea {{is used to}} (de) compose the flame Transfer Function (TF) of composite multiple flame configurations to/from the TF of constituent sub-systems of the flame. The TF superposition approach {{is based on the}} additive nature of the flame heat release rate. It is shown that the cumulative (total) flame TF can be represented as a weighted sum of elemental TF’s of the flame sub-systems where the weighting factors are related to the thermal power of the particular flames. On the basis of this approach, the thermo-acoustic TF’s of the burner decks with regular round hole perforation are experimentally studied. It is found that, the perforation hole diameter and the perforation pattern porosity are the governing parameters of the constituent TF’s. For burner decks with square patterns of unisize round holes the TF was studied {{as a function of the}} hole diameter, inter-hole spacing and mean flow rate. The TF composed via the superposition of TF’s measured for unisize perforations gives a good indication of the TF of the composite (multi-size) pattern if the elemental (unisize) TF’s are measured for the <b>burner</b> <b>deck</b> with the same porosity as the composite one. Possible simplifications and extensions of the proposed TF (de) composition principle are discussed. The practical perspective of this research is to offer an opportunity for the design of <b>burner</b> <b>deck</b> patterns with desirable acoustic characteristics...|$|E
40|$|A {{simplified}} burner-heat exchanger {{system is}} numerically modeled {{in order to}} investigate the effects of different elements on {{the response of the}} whole system to velocity excitation. We model the system in a 2 D CFD code, considering a linear array of multiple Bunsen-type flames with heat exchanger tubes downstream the flames. Thermoacoustic instability {{is one of the main}} issues in lean premixed combustion systems, especially domestic boilers. In com-pact condensing boilers the close distance between the burner surface and the heat exchanger has increased the importance of studying the interactions between the flames and the heat exchanger. The elements corresponding to the heat balance in the system are the flame as heat source and <b>burner</b> <b>deck</b> and heat exchanger as heat sinks. We use both transfer function and transfer matrix approaches to identify the response of these elements to a step function excitation of velocity at the inlet of the domain. Steady-state simulations show that the contribution of the <b>burner</b> <b>deck</b> to the heat balance of the whole system is negligible, leaving the flame and heat exchanger as main contributors to the response of the system. We separately investigate the behavior of these two elements by modeling cases with flame only and heat exchanger only. Then we calculate the behavior of the combined system and compare it to the results of modeling a case with flame and heat exchanger together. These results show that, assuming linear behavior of the elements, it is possible to predict the system behavior via its constructing elements. Further investigations of the effects of other parameters and the limits, within which the assumptions are valid, are currently in progress...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{the present}} work is to {{simulate}} the response of a burner-heat exchanger system to inlet velocity excitations. The system has been simplified to a slit burner with heat exchanger in a 2 D CFD model. The inlet of the system was excited with a step velocity profile and the heat release from the flame and heat absorption by heat exchanger and <b>burner</b> <b>deck</b> have been calculated. Then the transfer function approach {{has been used to}} describe the response of each of these elements to inlet velocity excitations. Results show that each of the elements can potentially be a source of thermoacoustic noise. Therefore it is important to investigate the effects of each of them on the whole system separately. The methods to decouple these effects are currently under investigation...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Master) [...] İzmir Institute of Technology, Mechanical Engineering, İzmir, 2007 Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves: 90 - 92) Text in English; Abstract: Turkish and Englishxv, 92 leavesLamella burner {{is a low}} NOx burner {{patented by}} BOSCH Thermotechnologies. In this study, different designs of fin deck, {{which is one of}} the major components of the lamella burner, are experimentally analyzed and optimized. After the optimization process, a numerical analysis was used for verification. Emissions are the most important properties for the gas fired boilers and directly related with the design of the burner parts where the combustion occurs. In the lamella <b>burner,</b> fin <b>deck</b> is the most related part with combustion. Combustion occurs on the fin deck surface hence, current fin deck design analysis and optimization is based on the emission rates in order to keep the lamella burner as low-emission (both NOx and CO) burner. This study mainly consists: summary of main parameters regarding combustion and fin deck, experimental analysis, and verification of optimized fin deck model with numerical simulation. Firstly, gas combustion and lamella burner are investigated. Physical conditions and combustion characteristics for fin deck are analyzed and layout parameters for fin deck are deducted. Afterwards, four new fin deck designs are introduced as alternatives for the current design. In the experimental part, emission, light back, flame lift, temperature and pressure drop tests are performed for serial and each new sample in the BOSCH Product Development Laboratories, Manisa. According to the test results, the most preferred sample is defined as optimized one. Test results are discussed to explain whether the fin deck samples are preferable or not. In the combustion curve performance test, CO values are measured. The comparison between the combustion curve test results show that CO formation is related to the fin deck geometry. Geometry affects flame stability because of the differences in mixture velocity distributions. The unburned gas in exhaust is one of the causes of the CO formation and influenced from the flame stability. Therefore,unburned gas mass fractions in exhaust are different for the samples with different geometries. This result is also numerically verified in combustion simulations of two different fin deck models, which one of them is considered as optimized sample...|$|R
40|$|Preparations for {{conducting}} large-scale combustion tests with caking bituminous coal continued during {{the start of}} this quarter. Major project accomplishments related to bituminous coal testing included: a CFD preheat model and evaluation, an update of the process flow diagram and a detailed preheat burner mechanical design (suitable for construction) for firing bituminous coal. Installation and testing of the 85 MMBtu/h bituminous coal preheating system was planned to take place before the end of December. Based on the inability to conduct testing in Riley's Commercial Burner Test Facility (CBTF) during freezing weather, a schedule review indicated required site work for testing bituminous coal at the CBTF could not be completed before freezing weather set in at the site. Further bituminous preheat modification work was put on hold and efforts turned to securing the test facility over the winter season. Bituminous coal tests are therefore delayed; April-May 2005 is earliest estimate of when testing can resume. A request for a time extension was submitted to DOE to extend the project through September 2005 to allow time to secure additional funding and complete the bituminous coal testing. Removal of the PRB PC Preheater from the CBTF <b>burner</b> <b>deck</b> was completed. Decommissioning of the CBTF for the winter was also completed...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{central heating}} systems use low NO$_x$ {{premixed}} burners with a largemodulation range. This {{can lead to}} noise problems which cannot be solved viatrial and error, but need accurate modelling. An acoustical analysis as part ofthe design phase can reduce the time-to-market considerably, but the acousticalresponse of the flame is an unknown and complex key-factor. A large class of burners currently used in boiler equipment is formed byradiant surface burners. These burners are generally made of a porous materialon which a (nearly) flat flame can be stabilized. This willlead to heat transfer from the flame to the burner, and consequently a coolerflame and reduced NO$_x$ emissions. However, the heat loss towards the burnerhas a significant influence {{on the behavior of}} the flame when the flow velocityis acoustically disturbed. In that case at certain frequencies a feedback loopcan occur and the velocity fluctuations are amplified. In this paper, a detailed model for the heat transfer between the gas and theburner is used to numerically study the influence of several different material properties on the acoustical transfer coefficient. The model is tested withmeasurements of the transfer function for four different <b>burner</b> <b>deck</b> types withknown material properties. It is found that an accurate description of the heattransfer in the porous material is essential for a good modeling of the acousticaltransfer function...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{the present}} work {{is to develop a}} model to {{investigate}} the interactions between a burner and a heat exchanger, looking from a hydrodynamic and thermoacoustic point of view. Thermoacoustics of laminar premixed flames in open air have been studied by some re-searchers in the past decades. However, a burner in open air may behave differently com-pared to if situated in a combustion chamber enclosure. This could be related to the effect of temperature, the effect of flame shape (e. g. flames impinging on the heat exchanger walls in compact boilers), distribution of the flame on the <b>burner</b> <b>deck,</b> etc. The behavior of a linear array of a multiple Bunsen-type flames is studied on a 2 D geometry in a CFD code to simulate the effects of heat exchanger addition on the flames thermoacoustics. The location of the heat exchanger surface is varied for different conditions of power. A step profile velocity perturbation is used for obtaining the response of the flame represented within the flame transfer function approach. The calculated gain and phase of the flame transfer function are compared for different cases as the indicator of the thermoacoustic behavior. Results show that the main parameter having considerable influence is the burner load and flame shape. The setup to experimentally investigate these effects will be constructed in near future...|$|E
40|$|One {{promising}} {{approach to}} eliminate thermoacoustic instabilities in combustion appliances {{is the use}} of adaptive control of the flame/burner acoustic transfer function (TF). Application of a DC electric field (EF) as a spatially distributed, easily and quickly adjustable and low-energy method to affect the flame behaviour may be considered as a possible actuation method to control the flame TF. Experimental evaluation of such a possibility is the main goal of the present study. The effect of a DC EF on the acoustic TF of premixed flat burner-surface stabilized flames is studied systematically {{as a function of the}} following parameters: flow velocity, equivalence ratio, applied voltage and burner geometry. It is established that the response of the flame TF on the DC EF can be characterized as a TF shift towards higher frequencies. The mechanism of TF alteration is related to the decrease of the flame stand-off distance and the related increase of the <b>burner</b> <b>deck</b> surface temperature. From a practical point of view, the efficiency of the EF control of the flat flame TF is restricted to a relatively narrow frequency range around the position of the TF resonance peak. To get insight into the physics of the EF-flame interaction, the method of [1] to measure the EF effect on the adiabatic flame speed is improved and the measurement range is extended. The new measurements allow a revision of previous results and allow an explanation for the ambiguity in the old measurements. (C) 2012 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.
