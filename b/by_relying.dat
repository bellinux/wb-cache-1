5|$|It was {{the first}} time the court had {{considered}} an entrapment case from outside the realm of controlled-substance enforcement, or one involving conduct that had only recently been criminalized. <b>By</b> <b>relying</b> exclusively on whether the defendant had a predisposition to commit the crime, the court appeared to have finally resolved a lingering issue in its previous decisions on the subject.|$|E
5|$|<b>By</b> <b>relying</b> on {{the written}} works of both Christian and Muslim authors, oral traditions, and modern methods of anthropology, archaeology, and linguistics, Mohammed Hassen, Associate Professor of History at Georgia State University, {{asserts that the}} largely non-Christian Oromo people have interacted and lived among the Semitic-speaking Christian Amhara people {{since at least the}} 14th century, not the 16th century as is {{commonly}} accepted in both traditional and recent Ethiopian historiography. His work also stresses Ethiopia's need to properly integrate its Oromo population {{and the fact that the}} Cushitic-speaking Oromo, despite their traditional reputation as invaders, were significantly involved in maintaining the cultural, political, and military institutions of the Christian state.|$|E
5|$|If {{a device}} {{key is to}} be revoked, the media key blocks on all discs {{manufactured}} after the time of revocation are encrypted {{in a way which}} does not enable the revoked device to obtain a valid processing key. Users trying to view new content on a revoked player would be forced to upgrade their player software to a more secure version, thereby limiting the scope of the compromise each time an exploit is discovered. While a compromised device or processing key could be used to decrypt a large number of discs, BackupHDDVD does not use these keys because they can be revoked by AACS LA. Because the AACS revocation system works by preventing a given device or player from calculating a valid volume unique key, BackupHDDVD circumvents the system entirely <b>by</b> <b>relying</b> on volume or title keys leaked from authorized players. With these keys BackupHDDVD is not subject to device revocation and is able to decrypt the content directly, bypassing the key exchange and verification process.|$|E

5|$|Maxinquaye was {{released}} on 20 February 1995 and reached number three on the United Kingdom's albums chart while selling over 100,000 copies in its first few months. 4th & B'way marketed the album <b>by</b> <b>relying</b> on independent record promoters and Tricky's appearances in media, including publicity photographs and music videos that portrayed him and Topley-Bird in gender-bending fashion. A widespread critical success, Maxinquaye was cited by many journalists as the year's best record and the key release of a musical style known as trip hop. Since then, it has sold 500,000 copies worldwide and ranked frequently on all-time lists of the greatest albums, being viewed as a significant influence on electronica, underground, and British hip hop.|$|E
5|$|The {{radicals}} refused, however, {{to recognize}} {{themselves in the}} novel's pages (Dimitri Pisarev ridiculed the notion that Raskolnikov's ideas could be identified {{with those of the}} radicals of his time), since Dostoyevsky pursued nihilistic ideas to their most extreme consequences. The aim of these ideas was altruistic and humanitarian, but these aims were to be achieved <b>by</b> <b>relying</b> on reason and suppressing entirely the spontaneous outflow of Christian pity and compassion. Chernyshevsky's utilitarian ethic proposed that thought and will in Man were subject to the laws of physical science.* Hudspith (2003), 95 Dostoyevsky believed that such ideas limited man to a product of physics, chemistry and biology, negating spontaneous emotional responses. In its latest variety of Bazarovism, Russian nihilism encouraged the creation of an élite of superior individuals to whom the hopes of the future were to be entrusted.|$|E
5|$|This revival did {{not last}} long. Following the death of Charles of Anjou in 1285 {{and the end of}} the threat of an {{invasion}} from Italy, Michael's successor Andronikos II Palaiologos (1282–1328) assumed that, <b>by</b> <b>relying</b> on the naval strength of his Genoese allies, he could do without the maintenance of a fleet, whose particularly heavy expenditure the increasingly cash-strapped treasury could no longer afford. At the same time, Andronikos was less concerned with the West and more with affairs in Asia Minor and his—eventually futile—attempt to stop the Turkish advance there, a policy where the fleet lacked a role. Consequently, the entire fleet was disbanded, its crews dismissed and the ships broken up or left to rot. The results were quick to follow: during Andronikos' long reign, the Turks gradually took permanent possession of the Aegean coasts of Anatolia, with the Empire unable to reverse the situation, while the Venetian fleet was able to attack Constantinople and raid its suburbs at will during the 1296–1302 war.|$|E

5|$|For {{at least}} six months, the Mexican Armed Forces were trying to hunt down Antonio Ezequiel, nearly {{capturing}} him in two occasions. The drug lord managed to avoid capture in several occasions <b>by</b> <b>relying</b> on the armed squadron known as Los Escorpiones (The Scorpions), which served as his private army. Among the first operations to capture the drug lord occurred on 31 March 2010, when the Mexican military confronted Antonio Ezequiel's bodyguards at Tres Culturas neighborhood in Matamoros. On 7 April 2010, there were two shootouts in Matamoros between Mexican marines {{and members of the}} Gulf Cartel. The intelligence information collected in these shootouts allowed the Mexican Armed Forces to locate the domicile of Antonio Ezequiel on 14 September 2010 at Fraccionamiento Río in Matamoros. But heavily armed gunmen of the Gulf Cartel intercepted the raid and protected their leader, who escaped in an armored vehicle. Two military men were killed in the operation, but the government managed to gain more information on the logistics of the inner circle of Antonio Ezequiel. On 1 November 2010, the Mexican authorities learned once again that Antonio Ezequiel was spending the night in a safe house at the Expo Fiesta Oriente neighborhood in Matamoros. But before the authorities got to the location, the drug lord left and avoided his capture.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that an opportunity was lost on 5 August to encircle and capture the invading Austrian, German and Ottoman force when it was allowed to withdraw to Katia. The infantry's difficulties regarding the supply of water and camel transport combined with their lack of desert training, together with Lawrence's confusing orders for infantry in the 52nd (Lowland) Division to move south and east, stopped them from promptly advancing to cut off the retreating force {{in the early hours of}} the second day's battle. General Lawrence was criticised for taking a grave and unnecessary risk <b>by</b> <b>relying</b> on just one entrenched infantry division and two light horse brigades to defend Romani. That the strong enemy attack on the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades during the first night's battle pushed them so far back that the planned flanking attack by the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade became almost a frontal attack. Lawrence was also faulted for remaining at his headquarters at Kantara, which was considered to be too far from the battlefield, and that this contributed to his loss of control of the battle during the first day, when the telephone line was cut and he was out of contact with Romani. Lawrence was also criticised for not going forward to supervise the execution of his orders on 5 August, when there was a failure to coordinate the movements of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade and the Mobile Column.|$|E
5|$|Stace {{was praised}} for his clarity and ambitious aims in Time and Eternity by Abraham Kaplan who {{believed}} {{the book was}} one of the best on the subject for many many years. He pointed out that the book’s distinction between the orders of time and eternity owed much to Kant (which Stace himself acknowledged). Kaplan reflected that it was the book’s emphasis placed on mysticism and a universal religious intuition that would be of particular interest to students of “Oriental and comparative philosophy”. The central idea upon which Stace’s thought stands or falls, for Kaplan, is that religious language is evocative rather than descriptive. In this both religionists and naturalists will find problems. For the former, Stace can only account for the appropriateness of religious language <b>by</b> <b>relying</b> on ‘nearness’ to the divine rather than on resemblance, and this relies on ‘a vague panpsychism’ and levels of being in the manner of Samuel Alexander. While for the naturalist, Stace’s system of religious symbolism is doomed to remain mysterious, because it does not allow religious metaphors to be translated literally and neither can it be said how they evoke the experience to which they refer.|$|E
