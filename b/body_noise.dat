40|$|Fully implantable hearing devices (FIHDs) {{have been}} {{developed}} as a new technology to overcome the disadvantages of conventional acoustic hearing aids. The implantable microphones currently used in FIHDs, however, have difficulty achieving high sensitivity to environmental sounds, low sensitivity to <b>body</b> <b>noise,</b> and ease of implantation. In general, implantable microphones may be placed under the skin in the temporal bone region of the skull. In this situation, <b>body</b> <b>noise</b> picked up during mastication and touching can be significant, and the layer of skin and hair can both attenuate and distort sounds. The new approach presently proposed is a microphone implanted at the tympanic membrane. This method increases the microphone’s sensitivity by utilizing the pinna’s directionally dependent sound collection capabilities and the natural resonances of the ear canal. The sensitivity and insertion loss of this microphone were measured in human cadaveric specimens in the 0. 1 to 16 kHz frequency range. In addition, the maximum stable gain due to feedback between the trans-tympanic microphone and a round-window-drive transducer, was measured.

To unravel this multifaceted discourse the paper will describe the French quest for the silent car body and differentiate three different meanings of silence: mechanical silence, comfortable silence, and aristocratic silence.

The <b>noise</b> variance of an RF coil depends on the body resistance and, thus, is also modulated by respiration.

The performance of the noise sensor was compared with the respiratory bellow and with the diaphragm displacement visible on MR images. Several breathing patterns were tested. Results: The noise variance demonstrated a periodic, temporal modulation that was synchronized with the respiratory bellow signal. The modulation depth of the noise variance resulting from the respiration varied between the channels of the array and depended on the channel's location {{with respect to the}} <b>body.</b> The <b>noise</b> sensor combined with MR acquisition was able to detect the respiratory motion for every k-space read-out line.

Permission to deposit the paper has been {{granted by the}} University of Sussex, {{publishers}} of {{the proceedings of the}} International Symposium on the Computational Modelling and Analysis of Vehicle <b>Body</b> <b>Noise</b> and Vibration, University of Sussex, Brighton, UK, March 2012. Numerical predictions are becoming ever more important in automotive development when analysing the Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH) performances of vehicles. In the low- to midfrequency range, vibro-acoustic predictions are generally performed using the finite element method (FEM) and/or boundary element method (BEM). In this paper, a numerical optimisation technique is described that aims at reducing the sound radiation from automotive-type panels over the frequency range of interest. The objective function, i. e. the radiated acoustic power, is calculated with a quadratic equation in terms of surface velocities. The genetic algorithm (GA) based optimisation aims to minimise the value of the objective function by modifying the normaldirection (Z-direction in an X-Y plane) of a few nodes of the finite element model of the panel, thereby imposing a geometrical change in the panel. The equation of an ellipsoid is used to smooth out the discontinuity after the change in the nodal coordinates and, hence, dome-shaped indentations are obtained. The resulting panel designs are analysed, both numerically and experimentally to support the approach presented...|$|E
40|$|Abstract]: The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{highlight}} the inability of many existing digital stethoscopes to properly integrate with a specific telehealth setting. A simulation was conducted to determine the problems that may be associated with existing digital stethoscopes when used in this specific telehealth environment. In assessing existing models of stethoscopes a number of practical issues were encountered. This assessment used three existing models of digital stethoscope, through the usage of a point-to-point video conferencing system, in a laboratory setting. It became evident, through this simulated test, that an ‘echo’ was prominent in the sound received from the digital stethoscope. A delay in the transmission of the heart beat sound across the telehealth network was also prevalent in the simulated test. Both <b>body</b> <b>noise</b> and friction were heard through the existing model of stethoscope in accordance with the background noise from where the sample heart beat was obtained. It was determined through the simulation that a combination of the previously described aspects associated with existing digital stethoscope models compounded the quality of the sound received from the devices. In conclusion, through examining the practical issues in using existing digital stethoscopes in a telehealth environment the quality of the sound transmitted by the device was determined to be very poor. This proved to be of concern due to the importance associated with sound quality and the diagnosis provided by physicians. We report and demonstrate these concerns through this paper to highlight the practical difficulties that can be encountered while integrating an existing market product with a proprietary telehealth setting. ...|$|E

40|$|The closed {{body was}} an {{expression}} of the civilizing of the car in the interwar period (Mom, Schot, Staal 2009). The change from adventure machine to the utilitarian car made the closing of the body a prerequisite: only if the driver and the passengers were reliably protected against all weather and road conditions, the everyday use of the economical machine could take off. The closing of the body raised new problems for automotive engineers: airflow and <b>body</b> <b>noise</b> needed to be kept under control. As a technical paradox the closed body was solution and source of these problems. The silencing of the body coincided with the discourse about noise as a sign of inefficiency. And the popularization of this discourse urged the modern motorists to demand a noiseless cars. Thus the silent car became a status symbol during the 1920 ’s. The closed body protected the driver not only against different physical conditions but also against the social conditions of the time. With Georg Simmel (2006 : 11), one can say that the automobile was a technical protecting organ (Schutzorgan) for the new urban citizen. In short, distancing from other people and social distinction by the means of the noiseless car went hand in hand (Wetterauer 2007). As early as the 1930 ’s, the car became a privatized and intimate space of sonic reception. Whereas the silencing of the car was a presupposition of its sonic aesthetisation, only just the use of the radio transformed the capsule of the closed body into a sonic cocoon: because car-cocooning is not only about (social) isolation but also about (sonic) control...|$|E
40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} noise reduction techniques for bluff <b>body</b> <b>noise.</b> Three methods were investigated, using a splitter plate on a fairing- strut configuration, applying flow control to the surface of a fairing and fitting a splitter plate behind a isolated bluff body. Aerodynamic tests were performed in wind tunnel facilities using particle image velocimetry (PIV), hotwire anemometry, pressure sensors and a force balance. Acoustic tests using a microphone array, on-surface microphones and freefield mi- crophones were performed to investigate the noise generated by the models. The splitter plate fitted to the fairing-strut configuration was found to be dominated by large scale vortex shedding. The addition of the splitter plate blocked the interaction between the two opposing shear layers aft of the shell's trailing edge thereby reducing their interaction with the downstream strut. Broadband noise reductions were observed as well as reduction in the noise levels of the peaks asso- ciated with the shedding. Applying flow control showed noise reductions for both cases when suction and blowing were applied. These reductions were observed at the lower tested Reynolds numbers (ReDshell = 1. 75 x 105), at higher Reynolds numbers (ReDshell = 3. 5 x 105) the noise reductions decreased when compared to the baseline case. The splitter plate fitted behind an isolated bluff body modified the wake, decreasing shedding frequency and drag with an increase in the splitter plate length. Broadband noise reductions were observed with all three splitter plate lengths and the tonal peak of the vortex shedding noise was suppressed. The study shed light on the possibility of achieving noise reductions using the three methods. However more research is required to apply these findings on a landing gear.
