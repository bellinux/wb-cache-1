40|$|The {{theory of}} thermally-activated slip {{is used to}} derive a crystal-plasticity {{materials}} constitutive model for deformation of OFHC copper single crystals. The mechanical response of the polycrystalline material is next determined from the single-crystalline materials constitutive relations using the classical Taylor approximation for apportionment of the deformation gradient between grains. Simulations of the deep drawing of cylindrical cups from as-rolled OFHC-copper blanks are next carried out using an explicit finite element formulation. The results obtained show that the crystallographic texture in as-rolled sheets, which can be accounted for {{through the use of}} crystal-plasticity, gives rise to rim-earing in fully-drawn cups. It is further shown that the extent of rim-earing can be greatly reduced by properly modifying the shape of the blank.

40|$|We report {{here that}} cells present in {{embryonic}} chick retinal monolayer cultures express differentiated properties characteristic of chick cones developing in vivo. Cell suspensions from 8 -d chick embryo retina (a stage when photoreceptor differentiation {{has not yet}} started) were cultured for up to 7 d in low density, glial-free monolayers. Under these conditions, monopolar cells represent approximately 40 % {{of the total number}} of process-bearing neurons. After 6 d in vitro, most of these monopolar cells showed morphological features reminiscent of developing chick cones. These features could be detected with phase- contrast microscopy, lectin cytochemistry, and transmission and scanning electron microscopy. Characteristic cone traits expressed by cultured monopolar cells included the following: (a) a highly polarized organization; (b) a single, short, usually unbranched neurite; (c) the polarized position of the nucleus close to the origin of the neurite; (d) characteristic cone inner segment features such as abundant free ribosomes, a polarized Golgi apparatus, a cluster of mitochondria distal to the nucleus, a big, membrane-bound, pigment-containing vacuole reminiscent of the "lipid droplet" characteristic of chick cones, and at least in some cases, a well-developed paraboloid; (e) the presence of a complex of apical differentiations including abundant microvilli and in some cases also a cilium-like process; and (f) the staining of the apical region of the cell with peanut lectin, which has been shown to be selective for chick embryo cones (<b>Blanks,</b> J. <b>C.,</b> and L.

Outer segments are not present at this stage of development either in vivo or in vitro.
