50|$|Cone meters are a newer {{differential}} pressure metering device first launched in 1985 by McCrometer in Hemet, CA. While {{working with the}} same basic principles as Venturi and orifice type DP meters, cone meters don’t require the same upstream and downstream piping. The cone acts as a conditioning device {{as well as a}} {{differential pressure}} producer. Upstream requirements are between 0-5 diameters compared to up to 44 diameters for an orifice plate or 22 diameters for a Venturi. Because cone meters are generally of welded construction, it is recommended they are always calibrated prior to service. Inevitably heat effects of welding cause distortions and other effects that prevent tabular data on discharge coefficients with respect to line size, <b>beta</b> <b>ratio</b> and operating Reynolds numbers from being collected and published. Calibrated cone meters have an uncertainty up to +/-0.5%. Un-calibrated cone meters have an uncertainty of +/-5.0%.|$|E

We then investigate whether the beta {{in the conventional}} CAPM is the weighted average of the jump beta and diffusion beta in the jump-diffusion model and how these different betas behave across different banks. Our empirical findings indicate that jump betas are cross-sectionally more dispersed than diffusion and standard betas. We find that the relationship(s) between the three betas are non-linear. We also find that standard betas are influenced more by diffusion betas than the jump betas, although the actual magnitude of the weights differ significantly across the quantile. This relationship holds for both individual stocks and portfolios. Empirical {{studies have shown that}} betas vary systematically across large and small firm equities. For large equity portfolios, the jump beta-diffusion <b>beta</b> <b>ratios</b> are lower that the jump <b>beta</b> diffusion <b>beta</b> <b>ratios</b> of the small equity portfolios.

The minimum upstream distances required to get a fully developed flow for these disturbances vary with type of upstream disturbance, <b>beta</b> <b>ratio</b> (beta) and half cone angle (alpha) of the wafer cone flowmeter.

This study defines conditions at which ER alpha/ER beta ratios in T 47 D-ER beta cells best mimic ER alpha/ER beta ratios in breast and other estrogen-sensitive tissues in vivo in rat as well as in human. Protein and mRNA levels of ER alpha and ER beta were analyzed in T 47 D-ER beta cells exposed to a range of tetracycline concentrations and compared to ER alpha and ER beta levels found in breast, prostate, and uterus from rat and human origin. The ER alpha/ER <b>beta</b> <b>ratio</b> in T 47 D-ER beta cells exposed to > 150 ng/ml tetracycline is comparable to the ratio found in rat mammary gland and in human breast tissue. The ER alpha/ER <b>beta</b> <b>ratio</b> of other estrogen-sensitive rat and human tissues can also be mimicked in T 47 D-ER beta cells. The ER alpha/ER <b>beta</b> <b>ratio</b> found in MCF- 7 and native T 47 D breast cancer cell lines did not reflect ratios in analyzed rat and human tissues, which further supports the use of T 47 D-ER beta cells as model for estrogen-responsive tissues.

AIM: To validate the gut lavage technique {{for the assessment of}} mucosal inflammation, by measuring intestinal IgG and interleukin 1 beta (IL- 1 beta) in the fluid obtained. PATIENTS: Sixteen children with Crohn's disease (CD), 14 with ulcerative colitis (UC), and 22 age matched controls. METHODS: Isotonic, non-absorbable polyethylene glycol based lavage solution was given orally or by nasogastric tube. Clear fluid was collected, filtered, and treated with protease inhibitors. IgG, IL- 1 beta and IL- 1 -receptor antagonist (IL- 1 -ra) were measured by sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: In patients with UC and CD, IgG and IL- 1 beta levels were significantly (p < 0. 001) higher than in controls. A positive correlation (p < 0. 05) was found with disease activity scores. IL- 1 -ra levels were not significantly different in UC and CD, when compared with controls, but the IL- 1 -ra:IL- 1 <b>beta</b> <b>ratio</b> was significantly (p < 0. 01) lower in patients with UC and CD, and negatively (p < 0. 001) correlated with IgG levels in lavage fluid.

40|$|It is {{demonstrated}} that the surviving fraction of a population of cells with heterogeneous radio sensitivity, like that composing most malignant tumors, conforms to a different linear quadratic survival relation for dose less than about 3 – 5  Gy and dose greater than about 7 – 9  Gy. In the intermediate range of dose the survival relation for the population, as a whole, is not linear quadratic. Consequently, {{the value of the}} alpha <b>beta</b> <b>ratio</b> and the associated biologically effective dose calculation are different for the low and high dose range for most malignant tumors. Normal tissue cell populations responsible for organ function also have heterogeneous radio sensitivity, though to less degree than most malignant tumors. Consequently, the alpha <b>beta</b> <b>ratio</b> and associated biologically effective dose calculation related to the development of some acute early and chronic late developing radiation injuries are not the same in the low and high dose range. Variance of the distribution of α of a heterogeneous cell population lowers the effective value of the quadratic survival constant β of the population, as a whole, and increases the α/β ratio in the low dose range. Heterogeneous appearance of tumor cells (pleomorphism) and necrosis on biopsy or imaging studies reflect heterogeneity of the radio sensitivity of the cells. Greater heterogeneity implies a tendency to higher α/β ratio. This may furnish a clinically accessible way to estimate a value of the α/β ratio specific to an individual patient and tumor...|$|E

Clinical {{presentation of the}} small-vessel subcortical subtype may be insidious, and differential difficulties can arise with mild cognitive impairment. We investigated EEG parameters in subcortical vCIND in comparison with amnestic multidomain mild cognitive impairment to determine the additional diagnostic value of quantitative EEG in this setting. Methods:Fifty-seven community-residing patients with an uneventful central neurologic history and first presentation of cognitive decline without dementia were included. Neuropsychological test results were correlated with EEG parameters. Predictive values for vCIND and amnestic multidomain mild cognitive impairment were calculated using receiver operating characteristic curves and logistic regression modeling. Results:Vascular cognitive impairment, no dementia and amnestic multidomain mild cognitive impairment differed {{with regard to the}} EEG (delta + theta) /(alpha + <b>beta)</b> <b>ratio</b> (DTABR) and pairwise derived brain symmetry index. We found statistically significant correlations between pairwise derived brain symmetry index and immediate verbal memory, immediate global memory, verbal recognition, working memory, and mean memory score in vCIND.

It {{is known that}} a higher cellular gamma-globin level, e. g., higher ratio of cellular gamma-globin to beta(S) -globin (gamma/beta(S) ratio), inhibits sickle hemoglobin (HbS) polymerization tendency. Hence, therapeutic treatment of sickle cell anemia {{has been focused on}} introducing gamma-globin gene into red blood cells to increase the cellular gamma/beta(S) ratio. Here, we have introduced ribozymes and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against beta(S) -globin mRNA into blood cells as a means to increase the gamma/beta(S) ratio. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Single and multiribozymes against beta(S) -globin mRNA have been tested in vitro and in human erythroleukemia K 562 beta(S) cells that stably express exogenous beta(S) -globin gene. Primary human hematopoietic progenitor cells were also transfected with multiribozyme and the gamma/(gamma + <b>beta)</b> <b>ratio</b> determined and compared with cells transfected with long hairpin beta-globin cDNA and synthetic siRNA genes. RESULTS: We have found that the multiribozyme zb 21 A containing two ribozyme units effectively reduces beta(S) -globin mRNA both in vitro and in K 562 beta(S) cells. The gamma-globin mRNA to beta(S) -globin mRNA ratio in the multiribozyme transfected cells is about a factor of 2 more than that in the control cells. We have also found that the gamma/(gamma + <b>beta)</b> <b>ratio</b> in the transfected hematopoietic progenitor cells is increased by more than twofold in cells treated with multiribozyme zb 21 A or siRNA ib 5. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that introducing multiribozymes or siRNAs into red blood cells is comparable in their effectiveness to increase the ratio of cellular gamma-globin mRNA to beta- or beta(S) -globin mRNA, providing possible strategies to increase the effectiveness of gamma-globin gene transfer as gene therapy for treatment of patients with sickle cell anemia...|$|E
