5|$|A Junkers F.13 {{called at}} Lympne on 10 January 1923 {{to clear customs}} and then flew to Croydon where it was {{inspected}} by Secretary of State for Air Sir Samuel Hoare. In February, {{it was reported that}} Lympne had taken part in a test of the newly introduced Mayday radio signal used by aircraft to indicate that they were in distress. Georges Barbot won a prize of F.25,000 from Le Matin when he made a flight from St Inglevert to Lympne and back again on the same day, 6 May. He flew the route in a Dewoitine aircraft fitted with a Clerget engine. On landing a <b>bracing</b> <b>wire</b> in the undercarriage of the aircraft broke, but repairs were effected within half an hour. Problems starting the engine then delayed his departure slightly. On 28 October the Light Aircraft Trials were held (see below). In 1923, Air Union started a service flying newspapers to Lympne using a Farman F.60 Goliath.|$|E
2500|$|It was an {{all-metal}} single bay sesquiplane, fabric covered {{except for}} the fuselage ahead of the cockpit. The gap between the wings was small and the stagger marked. [...] The lower wing was conventionally mounted {{at the bottom of}} the fuselage and the upper planes, built in separate pieces, braced close to the upper fuselage on short, faired extensions. In section the wings were aerodynamically thick and strongly cambered. [...] There were ailerons only on the upper plane, the plan, structure and bracing of which was greatly altered during 1923. [...] When the H.26 made its first public appearance, at the Paris Aero Show in December 1922, the still uncovered upper wing of the unflown fighter had long, gently curved tips outboard of a straight edged, constant chord central section and had a single main spar. Sixteen months later, after the aircraft had flown, the wings had become rectangular and were built around two spars. [...] The short span lower wing retained its single spar structure throughout but it, too, had curved tips replaced with square. The wing bracing had also changed: originally a <b>bracing</b> <b>wire</b> ran from the rear undercarriage structure upwards and outwards, via the lower to the upper wing. [...] This was replaced by a single, wide chord rigid strut with an aerofoil section and widened at its roots.|$|E
50|$|Newsreels {{as well as}} the map of {{the landing}} {{approach}} show the Hindenburg made several sharp turns, first towards port and then starboard, just before the accident. Proponents posit that either of these turns could have weakened the structure near the vertical fins, causing a <b>bracing</b> <b>wire</b> to snap and puncture {{at least one of the}} internal gas cells. Additionally, some of the bracing wires may have even been substandard. One <b>bracing</b> <b>wire</b> tested after the crash broke at a mere 70% of its rated load. A punctured cell would have freed hydrogen into the air and could have been ignited by a static discharge (see above), or it is also possible that the broken <b>bracing</b> <b>wire</b> struck a girder causing sparks to ignite hydrogen. When the fire started, people on board the airship reported hearing a muffled detonation, but outside a ground crew member on the starboard side reported hearing a crack. Some speculate the sound was from a <b>bracing</b> <b>wire</b> snapping.|$|E

50|$|<b>Bracing</b> <b>wires</b> {{primarily}} {{divide into}} flying wires which hold the wings down when flying and landing wires which hold the wings {{up when they}} are not generating lift. (The wires connecting a basket or gondola to a balloon are also called flying wires.) Thinner incidence wires are sometimes run diagonally between fore and aft interplane struts to stop the wing twisting and changing its angle of incidence to the fuselage. In some pioneer aircraft, wing <b>bracing</b> <b>wires</b> were also run diagonally fore and aft to prevent distortion under side loads such as when turning. Besides the basic loads imposed by lift and gravity, <b>bracing</b> <b>wires</b> must also carry powerful inertial loads generated during manoeuvres, such as the increased load on the landing wires at the moment of touchdown.|$|R
50|$|Santos-Dumont's final flight as a {{pilot was}} made in a Demoiselle on 4 January 1910. The flight ended when a <b>bracing</b> <b>wire</b> snapped at an {{altitude}} of about 25 m (80 ft), causing a wing to collapse. Santo-Dumont suffered only bruises.|$|E
50|$|After Lehmann's death, Eckener blamed Pruss's {{handling}} of the landing but also suggested that Lehmann was responsible for pressuring Pruss to land the ship. Although Eckener did not rule out other causes, after investigating the disaster himself, he testified to the inquiry that a sharp S-turn during the landing procedure might have caused a <b>bracing</b> <b>wire</b> to break and tear a gasbag, and resulted in mixture of hydrogen with air, which then likely was ignited by an electrostatic discharge.|$|E
5000|$|A {{major public}} event {{was held at}} the aerodrome on 20 June 1914, when it was the turning point for a Hendon-Birmingham-Manchester and return air race. A crowd of 100,000 persons {{witnessed}} the flying. [...] Louis Strange arrived first in his Bl√©riot monoplane, being greeted by the Lord Mayor of Manchester, who stepped on a <b>bracing</b> <b>wire,</b> which broke on takeoff, and put Strange out of the race, which was won by a French airman. Other competitors included John Alcock in his Farman biplane.|$|E
50|$|Typically, {{the ends}} of bracing struts are joined to the main {{internal}} structural components such as a wing spar or a fuselage bulkhead, and <b>bracing</b> <b>wires</b> are attached close by.|$|R

Three types of bracing schemes were analyzed and fully cantilevered strut <b>bracing</b> and <b>wire</b> <b>bracing</b> and scaling rules were determined.

5000|$|His posting to {{the sixth}} course of {{instruction}} at the RFC's Central Flying School at Upavon, Wiltshire, came in May 1914. There he was retrained to fly B.E.2b and B.E.8 military aircraft. On 20 June he {{took part in a}} Hendon-Birmingham-Manchester and return air race at the controls of an [...] Gnome powered Bleriot monoplane, being first to arrive at Trafford Park Aerodrome, Manchester, where the Lord Mayor greeted him. To reach Strange's hand, the man stood on a <b>bracing</b> <b>wire</b> to the landing gear, damaging it. On take-off to return south, the wire snapped, smashing the Bleriot's propellor and the machine was damaged, putting him out of the race.|$|E
5000|$|Two main {{theories}} have been postulated {{as to how}} gas could have leaked. Dr. Eckener believed a snapped <b>bracing</b> <b>wire</b> had torn a gas cell open (see below), while others suggest that a maneuvering or automatic gas valve was stuck open and gas from cell 4 leaked through. During the airship's first flight to Rio, a gas cell was nearly emptied when an automatic valve was stuck open, and gas had to be transferred from other cells to maintain an even keel. However, no other valve failures were reported during the ship's flight history, and on the final approach {{there was no indication}} in instruments that a valve had stuck open.|$|E
5000|$|Hugo Eckener {{had always}} made safety his {{absolute}} priority during his many years managing airship operations. With Eckener's management, the Zeppelin company {{had a perfect}} safety record with no passenger ever sustaining a serious injury {{on any of the}} more than 1 million air miles that the rigid airships flew, until the Hindenburg disaster of 1937[...] Eckener was in Graz, Austria when he heard news of the Hindenburg disaster on 6 May 1937. In the official inquiry he concluded that a static spark ignited leaking hydrogen in the aft section of the ship. The leak would have been caused by a sharp turn, which he believed overstrained a <b>bracing</b> <b>wire,</b> causing it to snap and rip open an adjacent gas cell.|$|E

5000|$|The Fokker Spin was {{the first}} {{airplane}} built by Dutch aviation pioneer Anthony Fokker. The many <b>bracing</b> <b>wires</b> used to strengthen the aircraft made it resemble a giant spider, hence its name Spin (Dutch for [...] "spider").|$|R

50|$|The sole prototype, {{given the}} serial 'No.219', was first flown at Larkhill on 8 May 1914 with a {{temporary}} aluminium spinner due to vibration with the steel assembly. The S.S.A. Also flew at Farnborough but was damaged {{in a heavy}} landing. After repairs the S.S.A. Was flown again on 25 June 1914 at Filton, by Harry Busteed, but broke an undercarriage <b>bracing</b> <b>wire</b> on landing. Despite the damage and without being repaired, the S.S.A. was delivered to the French customer at the Douai works of Breguet for repair on 3 July 1914. When the Douai factory was forced to be evacuated to Villacoublay by the German invasion of France {{at the start of}} the First World War, the S.S.A. was not taken along, and no further records of the S.S.A. exists.|$|E
50|$|The {{extremely}} simple {{wing of the}} BS.7 {{was built}} around two spars, one close to the leading edge and the other near mid-chord. The upper ends of the bracing struts were attached to {{the underside of the}} spars at about 40% span and to the upper fuselage, at a position directly beneath the forward spar. There was only one <b>bracing</b> <b>wire</b> on each side, running {{from the top of the}} forward wing strut to the centre of the upper fuselage just aft of the trailing edge. The fabric covered wing was rectangular in plan apart from the aileron tips, which were obliquely cropped. It was mounted above the fuselage on a trapezoidal frame formed from three struts in a distorted, inverted N shaped arrangement, the rear member sloping shallowly aft.|$|E
50|$|Corner posts are 6 to 8 in in {{diameter}} or larger, and a minimum 8 ft in length may consist of treated wood or from durable on-site trees such as osage orange, black locust, red cedar, or red mulberry, also railroad ties, telephone, and power poles are salvaged {{to be used}} as corner posts (poles and railroad ties were often treated with chemicals determined to be an environmental hazard and cannot be reused in some jurisdictions). In Canada spruce posts are sold for this purpose. Posts are 4 in {{in diameter}} driven at least 4 ft and may be anchored in a concrete base 20 in square and 42 in deep. Iron posts, if used, are a minimum 2.5 in in diameter. <b>Bracing</b> <b>wire</b> is typically smooth 9-gauge. Line posts are set to a depth of about 30 in. Conversely, steel posts are not as stiff as wood, and wires are fastened with slips along fixed teeth, which means variations in driving height affect wire spacing.|$|E
50|$|A copy of Hannover CL.II, named CWL SK-1 S≈Çowik, was {{the first}} {{aircraft}} built in independent Poland, in CWL in Warsaw in 1919. It however crashed during a public flight on August 23, 1919 in Warsaw, due to faulty <b>bracing</b> <b>wires,</b> killing its constructor Karol S≈Çowik.|$|R
50|$|When {{the barbed}} wire span exceeds 650 ft, a braced line {{assembly}} is added in-line. This has the function of a corner post and brace assembly but handles tension from opposite sides. It uses diagonal <b>brace</b> <b>wire</b> that connects the tops to the bottoms of all adjacent posts.|$|R
50|$|In general, bracing {{allows a}} stronger, lighter {{structure}} than {{one which is}} unbraced, but external bracing in particular adds drag which slows down the aircraft and raises considerably more design issues than internal bracing. Another disadvantage of <b>bracing</b> <b>wires</b> is that they require routine checking and adjustment, or rigging, even when located internally.|$|R

5000|$|The 94th and 95th had {{the task}} {{of dealing with the}} type's {{teething}} troubles. Initially undercarriages failed on landing - this was corrected by using heavier <b>bracing</b> <b>wire.</b> The Nieuport 28's 160 hp Gnome Monosoupape rotary engine and fuel system proved unreliable and prone to fires. Field improvements to fuel lines, and increased familiarity of the American pilots (and their ground crews) with the requirements of monosoupape engines reduced these problems, but the definitive solution adopted was simply not completely filling the reserve fuel tank, at the expense of range. More seriously, a structural problem emerged - during a sharp pull out from a steep dive, the plywood leading edge of the top wing could break away, taking the fabric with it. [...] On the whole, although the pilots of the 94th and the 95th appreciated the manoeverability and good handling of the Nieuport, and were reasonably happy with its general performance, they regarded the type as fragile and dangerous.|$|E
50|$|To avoid {{weakening}} the frame by {{mortise and tenon}} joints between the longitudinal members and the struts, the latter abutted against the former and were {{held in place by}} right-angled steel brackets, which were bound to the wooden members by strips of Irish linen tape soaked in glue, the glue still being wet when the tape was bound, setting in situ. The corners of the angle brackets were indented at the apex to provide room for a steel pin and also provided with a horizontal slot across the corner, so that a <b>bracing</b> <b>wire</b> could pass through the slot and around the pin, enabling a simple, secure and easily replaceable mounting for the bracing wires which kept the frame in shape. Each of the corners of each triangular set of struts was braced to the diagonally opposite corner of the adjacent set. This method of construction avoided the use of wood-screws, which could eventually become difficult to fix and were often found in other aircraft to damage the members they were intended to strengthen.|$|E
25|$|In February 1917, 25 {{aircraft}} were ordered, {{and before}} the end of April 1917, examples were delivered to the Royal Naval Air Service in Italy. Two accidents with the aircraft, when the fuselage collapsed after the torpedo was released, delayed its use on operations. The cause was later found to be the method of securing the fuselage <b>bracing</b> <b>wires.</b>|$|R
50|$|It was {{a single}} bay biplane, with {{rectangular}} plan wings mounted without stagger and braced by two pairs of parallel, vertical interplane struts and <b>bracing</b> <b>wires,</b> with a large interplane gap of 1.90 m. The wings were wooden, two-spar, two-part structures, with spruce leading edges. Broad, full-span ailerons on upper and lower wings were externally connected.|$|R
5|$|The I-6 had an oval-section {{semi-monocoque}} fuselage {{covered with}} 'shpon', molded birch plywood, {{with a small}} headrest faired into the fuselage, although the engine was enclosed in a metal cowling that left the cylinder heads exposed for better cooling. The two-spar wings were covered in plywood and fabric and had a Clark Y profile. Internal <b>bracing</b> <b>wires</b> were fitted to reinforce the wings. The control surfaces were framed in duralumin, but covered in fabric. The duralumin N-type struts that separated the wings, and attached the upper wing to the fuselage, had a teardrop profile. They were reinforced with steel <b>bracing</b> <b>wires.</b> The conventional undercarriage was fixed with rubber shock absorbers. The wooden propeller was given a spinner. The lighter weight of the air-cooled Jupiter engine, which required neither a heavy radiator nor coolant, meant that the I-6 had an empty weight only 62% of that of the I-3.|$|R
