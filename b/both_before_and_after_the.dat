30|$|The {{immigrant}} age is {{very stable}} at around 29 – 30  years on average, <b>both</b> <b>before</b> <b>and</b> <b>after</b> 1994. Immigrants are roughly balanced by gender from “Other developed regions” <b>both</b> <b>before</b> <b>and</b> <b>after</b> 1994.

Critics faulted the industry and the NRC for their poor performance <b>both</b> <b>before</b> <b>and</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> accident. The international attention garnered by the crisis redoubled the determination of, and enhanced the credibility of, the anti-nuclear movement.

Berger pitted at the end of lap 15 for his first of two scheduled stops, before retiring a lap later with handling problems. Häkkinen led his first ever laps of a Formula One World Championship race, before pitting at the end of lap 18. Following the first series of pit stops, Schumacher resumed the race lead.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} deals with basic {{information}} for fostering creativity in Technology Education. The creativity diagnosis tests in an experimental lesson curriculum were conducted <b>before</b> <b>and</b> <b>after</b> the practices in "Woodworking area" at {{a junior high}} school. (1) The values of "creativity" as a whole tend to increase after productive practices though slightly. Among the three structures constituting "creativity", the structure "creative attitude" has higher values than other two structures <b>both</b> <b>before</b> <b>and</b> <b>after</b> productive practices. (2) When the components for fostering creativity are classified {{in accordance with their}} average scores, the components (A) which have high values of average scores <b>both</b> <b>before</b> <b>and</b> <b>after</b> productive practices are "memory", "divergent thinking", "self-evaluation", "observation", "persistence", "openness" and "impulsiveness", the components (B) which show almost the same values as the mean value <b>both</b> <b>before</b> <b>and</b> <b>after</b> productive practices are "cognition of problems", "expression", "planning", "information collection" and "curiosity" and the component (C) which has low values <b>both</b> <b>before</b> <b>and</b> <b>after</b> productive practices is "convergent thinking"...|$|R

5|$|This theory {{states that}} Nakagawa was {{unaware that the}} vessel he was attacking was a {{hospital}} ship, and that the sinking was an unfortunate accident. This view was supported by several Japanese officers, <b>both</b> <b>before</b> <b>and</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> revelation that Nakagawa was responsible. Amongst them was Lieutenant Commander Zenji Orita, who took command of I-177 after Nakagawa. Orita did not hear anything from the crew about having sunk a hospital ship, not even rumours, and believed that if I-177 had knowingly attacked Centaur, he would have learned this from the crew's gossip.|$|E
5|$|A 2010 study {{compared}} mDNA {{sequences of}} modern wolves {{with those from}} 24 ancient wolf specimens from western Europe dated between 44,000 and 1,200 years before present (YBP). The {{study found that the}} sequences could be allocated into two haplogroups. Haplogroups 1 and 2 could be found among wolves across Eurasia but only haplogroup1 could be found in North America. The ancient wolf samples from western Europe differed from modern wolves by 1 to 10 mutations, and all belonged to haplogroup2, indicating its predominance in this region for over 40,000 years, <b>both</b> <b>before</b> <b>and</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> Last Glacial Maximum. A comparison of current and past frequencies indicates that in Europe haplogroup2 became outnumbered by haplogroup1 over the past several thousand years, but in North America haplogroup2including the Beringian wolfbecame extinct and was replaced by haplogroup1 after the Last Glacial Maximum. However, a 2016 study did not support the existence of two wolf haplogroups.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, {{science fiction}} (sf) {{magazines}} {{had been published}} successfully in North America for over twenty years, but little progress {{had been made in}} establishing British equivalents. The bulk of British sf was published as paperback books, rather than magazines; a situation opposite of that in the US. Several short-lived magazines had come and gone, <b>both</b> <b>before</b> <b>and</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> war. John Spencer launched four very poor quality juvenile magazines in 1950, which continued into the mid-1950s, while one magazine, New Worlds, had survived since 1946. Since 1939, Atlas, a British publisher, had been producing a reprint edition of Astounding Science Fiction, one of the most well-regarded American sf magazines. During the war the contents had often been cut severely, and the schedule had not been regular, but it was reputed to sell 40,000 copies a month. This was enough {{to attract the attention of}} Hamilton & Co., a British publisher looking for new markets.|$|E

Tipu made a number of accusations against the Christians, including that they had invited the British to invade Canara in 1781–82, furnished supplies to and otherwise assisted General Matthews' army when it landed and took possession of Onore, accompanied the British detachment to Mangalore, provided it with supplies <b>both</b> <b>before</b> <b>and</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> march, aided the British in repairing breaches made when the fort was besieged by Tipu and plundered the state treasury at Nuggur when that fortress fell to General Matthews.|$|E

Many awards were presented in Britain for service in the Adriatic, Hoste, Maxwell and Fremantle among those knighted in the 1815 reforms to the knightly orders, as well as the recipients of a large amount of prize money for their captures in the theatre.

5|$|On 13 December 1981, {{claiming}} {{that the country was}} on the verge of economic and civil breakdown, and alleging a danger of Soviet intervention, General Wojciech Jaruzelski began a crack-down on Solidarity. Martial law was declared, the free labor union was suspended and most of its leaders detained. Several thousand citizens were interned or imprisoned and much larger numbers were subjected to various forms of harassment. Polish state militia (Milicja Obywatelska, the police) and paramilitary riot police ZOMO suppressed the strike action and demonstrations. Military forces entered industrial enterprises to clamp down on the independent union movement. A series of violent attacks included the pacification of Wujek Coal Mine during which 9 people were killed. The martial law offensive was directed primarily against workers and their Union; they, rather than intelligentsia activists, were the object of the most brutal treatment. The authorities succeeded in imposing on members of Solidarity an individual and collective trauma, from which the broken mass movement would not be able to recover. The Catholic Church strove to exert on Solidarity a moderating influence <b>both</b> <b>before</b> <b>and</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> martial law.|$|E
