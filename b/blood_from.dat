5|$|Cerebral veins drain deoxygenated <b>blood</b> <b>from</b> the brain. The {{brain has}} two main {{networks}} of veins: an exterior or superficial network, {{on the surface}} of the cerebrum that has three branches, and an interior network. These two networks communicate via anastomosing (joining) veins. The veins of the brain drain into larger cavities the dural venous sinuses usually situated between the dura mater and the covering of the skull. <b>Blood</b> <b>from</b> the cerebellum and midbrain drains into the great cerebral vein. <b>Blood</b> <b>from</b> the medulla and pons of the brainstem have a variable pattern of drainage, either into the spinal veins or into adjacent cerebral veins.|$|E
5|$|Frogs have three-chambered hearts, {{a feature}} they share with lizards. Oxygenated <b>blood</b> <b>from</b> the lungs and de-oxygenated <b>blood</b> <b>from</b> the respiring tissues enter the heart through {{separate}} atria. When these chambers contract, the two blood streams pass into a common ventricle before being pumped via a spiral valve {{to the appropriate}} vessel, the aorta for oxygenated blood and pulmonary artery for deoxygenated blood. The ventricle is partially divided into narrow cavities which minimizes the mixing of {{the two types of}} blood. These features enable frogs to have a higher metabolic rate and be more active than would otherwise be possible.|$|E

25|$|Bleeding, {{also known}} as hemorrhaging or haemorrhaging, is <b>blood</b> {{escaping}} <b>from</b> the circulatory system. Bleeding can occur internally, where <b>blood</b> leaks <b>from</b> <b>blood</b> vessels inside the body, or externally, either through a natural opening such as the mouth, nose, ear, urethra, vagina or anus, or through {{a break in the}} skin.|$|R
5|$|The right heart {{collects}} deoxygenated <b>blood</b> <b>from</b> {{two large}} veins, the superior and inferior venae cavae. Blood collects {{in the right}} and left atrium continuously. The superior vena cava drains <b>blood</b> <b>from</b> above the diaphragm and empties into the upper back part of the right atrium. The inferior vena cava drains the <b>blood</b> <b>from</b> below the diaphragm and empties into the back part of the atrium below the opening for the superior vena cava. Immediately above and {{to the middle of the}} opening of the inferior vena cava is the opening of the thin-walled coronary sinus. Additionally, the coronary sinus returns deoxygenated <b>blood</b> <b>from</b> the myocardium to the right atrium. The blood collects in the right atrium. When the right atrium contracts, the blood is pumped through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. As the right ventricle contracts, the tricuspid valve closes and the blood is pumped into the pulmonary trunk through the pulmonary valve. The pulmonary trunk divides into pulmonary arteries and progressively smaller arteries throughout the lungs, until it reaches capillaries. As these pass by alveoli carbon dioxide is exchanged for oxygen. This happens through the passive process of diffusion.|$|E
5|$|An {{examination}} of the blood stains found inside 46Lower Belgrave Street demonstrated that Rivett had been attacked in the basement kitchen, while Lady Lucan had been attacked {{at the top of}} the basement stairs. The blood stains found inside the Ford Corsair were of the AB blood group; the report concluded that this might have been a mixture of <b>blood</b> <b>from</b> both women. Hair similar to Lady Lucan's was also found inside the car.|$|E

5|$|Besides English {{translation}} and localization, the international version of Kingdom Hearts II {{differs from the}} original Japanese version {{in the content of}} gameplay and several scenes. The Hydra boss in the Hercules-themed world Olympus Coliseum had its green <b>blood</b> <b>from</b> the original Japanese version (which was taken from the film) changed into black and purple smoke in the English version. In one cutscene, Hercules fights the Hydra and uses his sword on its head, which eventually releases green <b>blood</b> <b>from</b> its mouth in the Japanese version; this was later changed into drool in the English version. There is also a scene in Disney Castle where, after chasing Donald around for missing a date, Daisy Duck pounds him on the backside in the Japanese version, whereas she merely tells him off inaudibly in the English version.|$|E
5|$|Bivalves {{have an open}} {{circulatory system}} that bathes the organs in hemolymph. The heart has three chambers: two {{auricles}} receiving <b>blood</b> <b>from</b> the gills, and a single ventricle. The ventricle is muscular and pumps hemolymph into the aorta, {{and then to the}} rest of the body. Some bivalves have a single aorta, but most also have a second, usually smaller, aorta serving the hind parts of the animal.|$|E

40|$|In the study, novel blood {{pressure}} estimation method was {{proposed to improve}} the accuracy of oscillometric method. The proposed algorithm estimated the {{blood pressure}} by comparing and analyzing the point variation aspect of dicrotic notch on pulsating waveform during each cardiac cycle. The waveforms of each cardiac cycle were extracted by maximum points. The extracted pulsating waveforms were applied by re-sampling, end-matching, and normalization. The systolic and diastolic blood pressures were estimated by point variation aspect of dicrotic notch. The blood pressures, which were estimated from proposed algorithm, were compared and analyzed by <b>blood</b> pressures <b>from</b> oscillometric methods and auscultation. The systolic <b>blood</b> pressure <b>from</b> oscillometric methods were + 0. 88 mmHg more than proposed algorithm, and 1. 875 less than the diastolic <b>blood</b> pressures <b>from</b> proposed algorithm.

5|$|In 1981, a breed registry, {{called the}} American Welara Pony Registry, {{was created in}} the US in order to develop and promote the breed. A {{studbook}} also began to be published, and pedigrees of Welaras were collected and preserved. Only Welsh and Arabian blood is allowed for purebreds, and all registered ponies must have at least 1/8 and no more than 7/8 <b>blood</b> <b>from</b> each breed. As of 2005, the registry claimed slightly over 1,500 ponies registered in North America, with around 100 new foals registered annually. Welara Sport Ponies may also be registered – these are ponies at least 50 percent Welara but with <b>blood</b> <b>from</b> other breeds, often the Thoroughbred.

5|$|Many {{blood vessels}} serve the {{esophagus}}, with blood supply varying along its course. The upper {{parts of the}} esophagus and the upper esophageal sphincter receive <b>blood</b> <b>from</b> the inferior thyroid artery, {{the parts of the}} esophagus in the thorax from the bronchial arteries and branches directly from the thoracic aorta, and the lower parts of the esophagus and the lower esophageal sphincter receive <b>blood</b> <b>from</b> the left gastric artery and the left inferior phrenic artery. The venous drainage also differs along the course of the esophagus. The upper and middle parts of the esophagus drain into the azygos and hemiazygos veins, and <b>blood</b> <b>from</b> the lower part drains into the left gastric vein. All these veins drain into the superior vena cava, {{with the exception of the}} left gastric vein, which is a branch of the portal vein. Lymphatically, the upper third of the esophagus drains into the deep cervical lymph nodes, the middle into the superior and posterior mediastinal lymph nodes, and the lower esophagus into the gastric and celiac lymph nodes. This is similar to the lymphatic drainage of the abdominal structures that arise from the foregut, which all drain into the celiac nodes.|$|E
