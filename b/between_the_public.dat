5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the wars, tragedy struck Gifu once again. On September 12, 1976, Typhoon 17 (Super Typhoon Fran) struck the city, killing five people and affecting over 40,000 families. Gifu recovered, however, through the establishment of various local industries. The city's growth reached such a point that it was designated a core city by the national government in 1996. As its fashion industry has declined, however, {{the city has been}} looking towards manufacturing to revive the economy. A recent construction boom, much of which has occurred around JR Gifu Station, has improved the city's economy. Both public construction projects (station area renovations and elevated walkways) and private efforts are revitalizing the city of Gifu. Gifu City Tower 43 is an example of cooperation <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> and private sectors, with part of the building belonging to the city and the remainder privately owned. Gifu expanded its size in 2006 by merging with the neighboring town of Yanaizu (from Hashima District) during the great Heisei merger.|$|E

25|$|A {{multitude}} of different practical situations of good SSG exist according to development actors. For example, in a security sector lead by good governance, {{the use of}} force is defined by a legal framework. This subsequently requires, among others, that publicly transparent laws are in place; oversight and separation of powers mechanisms are established and working; and the state's legitimate use of force is regulated through strategies and policies. An operational level example would be improved interaction <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> and the security sector, including freedom of information and complaint institutes.|$|E
25|$|Casa Salazar-Candal {{is one of}} a {{group of}} stylistically eclectic houses built in Ponce between 1900 and 1915. Designed by {{architect}} Blas C.

The facade is distinctly rendered in roccoco and moorish detailing to emphasize its bifunctional character as a home and an office respectively. The portion of the structure designed to shelter the family is refined, delicately ornamented and asymmetrical. It utilizes a balcony, raised and detached from the street as a transitional zone <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> and the private sphere.|$|E

25|$|After {{the first}} revolutionary years, Congress in 1814 elected José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia {{to be the}} supreme {{dictator}} (Supremo) of Paraguay. Under dictatorships of Francia (1814–1840), Carlos Antonio López (1841–1862) and Francisco Solano López (1862–1870) Paraguay developed quite differently from other South American countries. They encouraged self-sufficient economic development, state ownership of most industries and imposed {{a high level of}} isolation from neighboring countries. The regime of the López family was characterized by a harsh centralism in the production and distribution of goods. There was no distinction <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> and the private sphere, and the López family ruled the country as it would a large estate.|$|E

40|$|Teachers are {{the pillars}} of the society, who help {{students}} to grow to shoulder the responsibility of taking their nation ahead of others. Teachersâ€™ satisfaction with workplace {{is the heart of}} the study. If a teacher is satisfied with his/her job, then he/she will deliver his/her contributions in appropriate way. The major objectives of the study were: (1) to know difference <b>between</b> <b>the</b> views of <b>public</b> and private university teachers regarding their job satisfaction; (2) to differentiate <b>the</b> perceptions of <b>public</b> and private university teachers by academic qualification on their job satisfaction; (3) to explore difference <b>between</b> <b>the</b> opinions of <b>public</b> and private university teachers by age about job satisfaction; (4) to find out difference <b>between</b> <b>the</b> views of <b>public</b> and private university teachers by experience regarding job satisfaction; and (5) to explore <b>the</b> difference <b>between</b> <b>the</b> perceptions of <b>public</b> and private university teachers by gender about job satisfaction. The population of the study consisted of all teachers of public and private universities in Khyber Pakhtun Khwa. The researcher randomly selected 14 (7 public and 7 private) out of 25 universities in Khyber Pakthunkhwa. The sample size was 420 respondents. Questionnaire was used for data collection. Mean Independent Sample t-test was employed for data analysis. No significant difference was found <b>between</b> <b>the</b> perceptions of <b>public</b> and private universitiesâ€™ teachers on majority 20 dimensions of job satisfaction. However, significant difference was observed <b>between</b> <b>the</b> views of <b>public</b> and private universitiesâ€™ teachers on some job satisfaction facets.

25|$|The {{requirements}} of natural justice or {{a duty to}} act fairly depend on the context. In Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1999), the Supreme Court of Canada set out a list of non-exhaustive factors that would influence {{the content of the}} duty of fairness, including the nature of the decision being made and the process followed in making it, the statutory scheme under which the decision-maker operates, the importance of the decision to the person challenging it, the person's legitimate expectations, and the choice of procedure made by the decision-maker. Earlier, in Knight v. Indian Head School Division No. 19 (1990), the Supreme Court held that public authorities which make decisions of a legislative and general nature do not have a duty to act fairly, while those that carry out acts of a more administrative and specific nature do. Furthermore, preliminary decisions will generally not trigger the duty to act fairly, but decisions of a more final nature may have such an effect. In addition, whether a duty to act fairly applies depends on the relationship <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> authority and the individual. No duty exists where the relationship is one of master and servant, or where the individual holds office at the pleasure of the authority. On the other hand, a duty to act fairly exists where the individual cannot be removed from office except for cause. Finally, a right to procedural fairness only exists when an authority's decision is significant and has an important impact on the individual.|$|E
