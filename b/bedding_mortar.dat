50|$|The thick <b>bed</b> <b>mortar</b> {{method has}} been around for hundreds, if not {{thousands}} of years. Historically, a sand/cement mixture was mixed with water to a fairly dry consistency and was spread on either a portland cement water paste (neat cement), or over cement powder spread on the surface which is then sprayed with water to create a slurry coat and spread over the surface. The thick <b>bed</b> <b>mortar</b> would then be compacted and screeded (made flat and/or level) prior to installation of tile or stone. As the slurry coat dried it would bond the <b>mortar</b> <b>bed</b> to the concrete surface on which it was installed. <b>Mortar</b> <b>beds</b> were used underneath almost every tile or stone installation until the late 1950s when a chemical engineer, Henry M.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the mechanical behavior of <b>bedding</b> <b>mortar</b> samples under triaxial compression tests. When masonry is subjected to vertical loads, mechanical interactions between blocks and <b>bedding</b> <b>mortar</b> at the joints induce lateral tension and compression stresses. Thus, the mortar layer is submitted to a triaxial stress state that modifies its mechanical properties and behavior under confinement effects. This phenomenon may affect the failure mode of masonry and almost no information about this subject is found in literature. Here, test procedures are detailed and results are discussed. In addition to the compressive strength test results, also elastic modulus and Poisson ratio values are addressed. Significant differences were observed among triaxial and uniaxial standard test results. The obtained mortar behavior under different levels of lateral pressure is compared with test results done by other researchers in order to produce relevant conclusions for different mortar compositions.

40|$|When {{a mortar}} {{is applied to}} a porous {{substrate}} like brick or stone, water is exchanged between both materials. The early water transport {{is important for the}} workability of the mortar and for the final properties in the hardened state. It determines how long a mortar can be shaped, be it <b>bedding</b> <b>mortar,</b> plaster or render. The equilibrium water content of the mortar will influence the extent of the hydration reaction and the shrinkage. Also bond and water permeability of the hardened masonry are affected by this water flow. The aim {{of this paper is to}} understand the phenomena, to identify the important parameters and governing mechanisms. Water transport between mortar and brick was monitored during the first two hours after contact, by using microfocus X-ray imaging. This technique presents a practical and quick alternative for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and neutron radiography. The hygric properties of a lime hydrate mortar were determined experimentally. The essential concept is that the mortar is considered as a compacting material, of which the properties change when water is desorbed from it. Data were obtained in suction tests, pressure filtration tests and permeameter tests. A model for calculation of water transport between mortar and brick is proposed by coupling a generalised Darcy equation for both materials. For the mortar the spatial units are defined in (Lagrangian) material coordinates, which follow the material while compacting. Diffusivity and potential curves are derived from the experiments, using simple empirical equations from filtration theory. The differences between the simulation and the observations from X-ray experiments are analysed in the context of the interface resistance. status: publishe...|$|E

For his extraordinary state of preservation, its size and the internal organization of individual buildings, it is notable for being one of the finest and rare examples of fortified farm in the context of Italian and European Middle Ages. At present a plan of restoration is under preparation, for whose completion many studies have been performed. The architectural survey, thanks to the accuracy of laser scanner technology added to a critical interpretation and data processing, represented the first knowledge of spatial and geometrical information and also gave a model useful to identify structural instabilities and deformations in order to direct the diagnostic phase. The stratigraphic investigations extended over the entire architectural complex made it possible to distinguish the historical constructive phases of the farm.

40|$|Student Number : 0100677 A - PhD thesis - School of Civil and Environmental Engineering - Faculty of Engineering and the Built EnvironmentThis thesis {{presents}} the findings on empirical study of dry-stack masonry. Dry-stack masonry {{refers to a}} method of building masonry walls, {{where most of the}} masonry units are laid without mortar in the joints. Of late (since mid eighties) in modern construction, dry-stacking or mortarless technology is increasingly becoming popular because of its advantages. The construction industry is acknowledging the need to accelerate the masonry construction process, as the traditional method is labour intensive and hence slower due to the presence {{of a large number of}} mortar joints. Early attempts were made to increase the size of masonry units (block instead of brick), thereby reducing the number of mortar joints, wherein the use of <b>bedding</b> <b>mortar</b> imposed constraints on the number of courses to be constructed in a day. Elimination of <b>bedding</b> <b>mortar</b> accelerates construction; thereby reducing cost, variation due to workmanship and generally small pool of skilled labour is required in dry stacking. Dry-stack masonry is a relatively new technology not yet regulated in the code of practice and therefore very limited information on the structural behaviour of the masonry is available. This project is based on the investigation of the HYDRAFORM dry-stack system, which utilises compressed soil-cement interlocking, blocks. The system is now widely used in Africa, Asia and South America. The main objective of the project was to establish through physical testing the capacity of the system to resist lateral load (e. g. wind load), vertical load and dynamic load such as earthquake loading. In the first phase of the project investigations were conducted under static loading where series of full-scale wall panels were constructed in the laboratory and tested under lateral loading, and others were tested under vertical loading to establish the mode of failure and load capacity of the system. Series of control tests were also conducted by testing series of wallettes to establish failure mechanism of the units and to establish the flexural strength of the system. Finally the test results were used for modelling, where load prediction models for the system under vertical loading and under lateral loading were developed. The theoretical load prediction models were tested against the test results and show good agreement. After the load capacity was established the next step in the study was to further improve the system for increased capacity particularly under dynamic loading. The normal Hydraform system was modified by introducing a conduit, which allows introduction of reinforcements. Series of dry-stack seismic systems were constructed and initially tested under static lateral loading to establish the lateral load capacity. The second Phase of the project was to investigate the structural behaviour and performance of the Hydraform system under seismic loading. A shaking table of 20 tonnes payload, (4 m x 4 m) in plan was designed and fabricated. A full-scale plain dry-stack masonry house was constructed on the shaking table and subjected to seismic base motions. The shaking table test was performed using sine wave signals excitations starting from low to very severe intensity. A conventional masonry test structure of similar parameters was also constructed on the table and tested in a similar manner for comparison. The tests were conducted using a frequency range of 1 Hz to 12 Hz and the specimens were monitored for peak accelerations and displacements. For both specimens the initial base motion was 0. 05 g. The study established the mode of failure of the system; the structural weak points of unreinforced dry-stack masonry, the general structural response of the system under seismic condition and the failure load. The plain dry-stack masonry failed at 0. 3 g and the conventional masonry failed at 0. 6 g. Finally recommendations for further strengthening of system to improve its lateral capacity were proposed...|$|E

An important issue in Brazil nowadays {{is the lack of}} appropriate low-cost housing however, construction and demolition residues present appropriated physical and chemical properties in case of employment as construction material. With regard to the quality and performance of dwellings, this paper shows the results of structural and thermal performance evaluation of a building prototype of approximately 40 m 2 made of concrete blocks which were produced with recycled construction and demolition aggregates, according to government exigencies in Maceió, a tropical humid city in Northeastern Brazil. The blocks were developed in the Federal University of Alagoas Technological Research Center and made in a precast concrete factory called INDARC and their strucktural performance was analyzed after experimental tests. The <b>bedding</b> <b>mortar</b> was produced with recycled aggregates and its influence in the masonry was analyzed. The thermal performance monitoring period was summer time in Maceió. Outdoor and indoor measurements were carried out with HOBO data-loggers and superficial temperatures with infrared thermometers. Final results were compared to outdoor conditions, with regard to daily temperature swings and comfort levels. Some improvements were suggested regarding the thermal performance. Experiments indicate the application viability of that construction system in order to obtain improvement of low-cost housing politics, emphasizing the importance of aspects to be considered in building design, such as user’s well fare and comfort and energy savings.
