50|$|To {{understand}} how a <b>balanced</b> <b>modulator</b> works {{it is necessary to}} understand amplitude modulation and how it works. Most people describe amplitude modulation as a method of changing the strength of the carrier (amplitude) in sync with the modulating audio. This is true, the power output does change with modulation, but it changes because any AM modulator generates two sidebands, one above and one below the carrier. As power goes into these sidebands, the power output increases. The amplitude modulated signal, then, consists of a constant strength carrier and two sidebands. The sidebands carry the information and the carrier just goes along for the ride. The carrier can be removed at the transmitter and reinserted at the receiver to allow the transmitter to put all the power in the sidebands.|$|E

40|$|Although many {{descriptions}} of modulation {{describe it as}} a multiplication process, the truth {{is a bit more}} complex. First, to be quite clear, if the two inputs of a perfect multiplier were fed with a signal, Acos(ωt), and an unmodulated carrier, cos(ωt), we would have a modulator. This happens because the two periodic waveforms, A scos(ω st) and A ccos(ω ct), applied to the inputs of a multiplier (with a scale factor of 1 V for simplicity of analysis), produce an output given by: V o(t) = A sA c[cos((ω s + ω c) t) + cos(ω s – ω c) t)) ] If the carrier, A ccos(ω ct), has 1 V amplitude (A c = 1), this further simplifies to: V o(t) = A s[cos((ω s + ω c) t) + cos((ω s – ω c) t) ] But, in most cases, a modulator is a better circuit to perform this function. A modulator (also called a mixer when it is used as a frequency changer) is closely related to a multiplier. The output of a multiplier is the instantaneous product of its inputs. The output of a modulator is the instantaneous product of the signal on one of its inputs (known as the signal input) and the sign of the signal on the other input (known as the carrier input). Figure 1 shows two ways of modeling the modulation function: as an amplifier whose gain is switched positive and negative by the output of a comparator on its carrier input, or as a multiplier with a high-gain limiting amplifier between the carrier input and one of its ports. Both architectures have been used to produce modulators, but the switched amplifier version (used in the AD 630 <b>balanced</b> <b>modulator)</b> tends to be slower. Most high-speed integrated circuit modulators consist of a translinear multiplier (based on the Gilbert cell) with a limiting amplifier in the carrier path overdriving one of the inputs. This limiting amplifier may provide high gain, allowing a low-level carrier input—or low gain and clean limiting characteristics, thus requiring a comparatively large carrier input for correct operation.

40|$|Brain {{tumors are}} among the most common and most chemoresistant tumors. Despite {{treatment}} with aggressive treatment strategies, the prognosis for patients harboring malignant gliomas remains dismal. The kynurenine pathway (KP) is the principal route of L-tryptophan catabolism leading to the formation of the essential pyridine nucleotide, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD +), and important neuroactive metabolites, including the neurotoxin, quinolinic acid (QUIN), the neuroprotective agent, picolinic acid (PIC), the TH 17 /Treg <b>balance</b> <b>modulator,</b> 3 -hydroxyanthranilic acid (3 -HAA), and the immunosuppressive agent, L-Kynurenine (KYN). This review provides a new perspective on KP dysregulation in defeating antitumor immune responses, specifically bringing light to the lower segment of the KP, particularly QUIN-induced neurotoxicity and downregulation of the enzyme α-amino- β-carboxymuconate-ε-semialdehyde decarboxylase (ACMSD) as a potential mechanism of tumor progression. Given its immunosuppressive effects, 3 -HAA produced from the KP may also play a role in suppressing antitumor immunity in human tumors. The enzyme indoleamine 2, 3 -dioxygenase (IDO- 1) initiates and regulates the first step of the KP in most cells. Mounting evidence directly implicates that the induction and overexpression of IDO- 1 in various tumors is a crucial mechanism facilitating tumor immune evasion and persistence. Tryptophan 2, 3 -dioxygenase (TDO- 2), which initiates the same first step of the KP as IDO- 1, has likewise recently been shown to be a mechanism of tumoral immune resistance. Further, it was also recently shown that TDO- 2 -dependent production of KYN by brain tumors might be a novel mechanism for suppressing antitumor immunity and supporting tumor growth through the activation of the Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). This newly identified TDO- 2 -KYN-AhR signaling pathway opens up exciting future research opportunities and may represent a novel therapeutic target in cancer therapy. Our discussion points to a number of KP components, namely TDO- 2, IDO- 1, and ACMSD, as important therapeutic targets for the treatment of brain cancer. Targeting the KP in brain tumors may represent a viable strategy likely to prevent QUIN-induced neurotoxicity and KYN and 3 -HAA-mediated immune suppression. 9 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Invasion of the {{trophoblast}} {{into the}} maternal decidua is regulated {{by both the}} trophoectoderm and the endometrial stroma, and entails the action of tissue remodeling enzymes. Trophoblast invasion requires the action of metalloproteinases (MMPs) to degrade extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and in turn, decidual cells express tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs). The balance between these promoting and restraining factors is a key event for the successful outcome of pregnancy. Gene expression is post-transcriptionally regulated by histone deacetylases (HDACs) that unpacks condensed chromatin activating gene expression. In this study we analyze the effect of histone acetylation on the expression of tissue remodeling enzymes and activity of human endometrial stromal cells (hESCs) related to trophoblast invasion control. Treatment of hESCs with the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) increased the expression of TIMP- 1 and TIMP- 3 while decreased MMP- 2, MMP- 9 and uPA and have an inhibitory effect on trophoblast invasion. Moreover, histone acetylation is detected at the promoters of TIMP- 1 and TIMP- 3 genes in TSA-treated. In addition, in an in vitro decidualized hESCs model, the increase of TIMP- 1 and TIMP- 3 expression is associated with histone acetylation at the promoters of these genes.

Increased cytokinin activity leads to higher grain number, whereas GAs negatively affect meristem activity. The GA biosynthesis genes GA 20 oxs are negatively regulated by KNOX proteins. KNOX proteins function as <b>modulators,</b> <b>balancing</b> cytokinin and GA activity in the meristem. However, {{little is known about}} the crosstalk among cytokinin and GA regulators together with KNOX proteins and how KNOX-mediated dynamic balancing of hormonal activity functions. Through map-based cloning of QTLs, we cloned a GA biosynthesis gene, Grain Number per Panicle 1 (GNP 1), which encodes rice GA 20 ox 1. The grain number and yield of NIL-GNP 1 TQ were significantly higher than those of isogenic control (Lemont). Sequence variations in its promoter region increased the levels of GNP 1 transcripts, which were enriched in the apical regions of inflorescence meristems in NIL-GNP 1 TQ. We propose that cytokinin activity increased due to a KNOX-mediated transcriptional feedback loop resulting from the higher GNP 1 transcript levels, in turn leading to increased expression of the GA catabolism genes GA 2 oxs and reduced GA 1 and GA 3 accumulation. This rebalancing process increased cytokinin activity, thereby increasing grain number and grain yield in rice.

In the present paper we propose a compact planar hybrid with UWB behaviour. The configuration of the proposed UWB hybrid is illustrated in Fig. 1. The device uses two substrates supported by a common ground plane and various parallel strip-microstrip and microstrip-slot transitions. Its H port is formed by a slot-to-microstrip transition. In turn, the E port is created by a parallel strip t...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} {{autoimmune}} and chronic inflammatory diseases {{are related to}} environmental stress. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is regarded as an environmental sensor integrating immune responses with environmental stress and thereby influencing the extent of host immune response. The physiological role of AHR, particularly, in the immune response remains a key question after the discovery that AHR can modulate Th 17 /Treg axis in a ligand specific manner. However, discovery of a non-DRE mediated AHR activation {{in addition to its}} canonical DRE-mediated pathway further adds to this complexity thereby necessitating a more critical approach in delineating the role of AHR in the context of Th 17 /Treg <b>balance.</b> Selective AHR <b>modulators</b> (SAHRMs) are a recently identified class of compounds that are capable of binding to AHR and repress cytokine- driven gene expression without activating DRE-driven responses We have used three classes of AHR ligands namely agonist, antagonist and partial antagonist (SAHRM) to delineate the role of AHR in the context of Th 17 /Treg regulation both in vitro and in vivo. Here, we show that inhibition of the DRE-driven response is sufficient to suppress the Th 17 differentiation. Also, we show that the suppression of Treg differentiation is dependent on the inhibition of the non-DRE mediated pathway. We have also delineated the role of DRE vs non-DRE driven responses of Th 17 regulation in both an acute vs a chronic Th 17 mediated diseases. In an acute inflammation using C. rodentium model of IBD (Inflammatory Bowel Disease) AHR agonist enhanced Th 17 production and thereby promoted resolution of infection. On the other hand, using S. rectivirgula in a chronic mouse model of Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis we show that inhibition of DRE and /or non-DRE mediated response had minimal effect on IL- 17 A production but precludes Th 17 plasticity by enabling secretion of alternate lineage antiinflammatory cytokines. This work has profound implication in pharmacological intervention in autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases by developing AHR compounds which can modulate DRE and non-DRE driven responses. 2019 - 01 - 2...|$|R
40|$|EN] Angiogenesis or {{the growth}} of new blood vessels, is the {{so-called}} ‘common denominator’ shared by many diseases, affecting {{more than a billion}} people worldwide. These are all malignant diseases, heart disease, blindness, arthritis, complications of AIDS, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and more than 70 other health problems affecting adults and children in both developed and developing countries. In his landmark publication in 1971, Folkman J, develops the idea, that tumor growth is angiogenesis-dependent and describes {{for the first time the}} possible prospects of anti-angiogenic therapy in cancer. It took 13 years since then for the identification of the first heparin-binding growth factor, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) - 2 and 18 years for the detection of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). However, in spite of more than 40 years of research, no tumor marker useful for patients with gliomas is established yet. Many reported circulating biomarkers have the potential but none has proven to be introduced into clinical practice, despite the urgency and the need to standardize the measurement of the effect of treatment in daily clinical practice and research. Healthy body controls the process of angiogenesis through a number of "on" - "off" switches. The main "on" elements are known as - angiogenesis- stimulating growth factors. The main "off" elements are known as - angiogenesis inhibitors. The healthy individuals maintain a perfect <b>balance</b> of angiogenic <b>modulators.</b> There are at least 20 known angiogenic growth factors. Five are tested on people for stimulating growth of new blood vessels in wound healing and restoration of blood flow to the heart, brain and limbs. The first angiogenesis inhibitor is detected in 1975 by Dr. Judah Folkman and Henry Brem. Today about 30 angiogenic inhibitors are to be found in the human body and generally more than 300 in natural sources - fungi, bark, muscle and shark cartilage, coral, green tea, garlic, ginseng, herbs and more. VEGF and its receptors 1 and 2 are the main units in tumor angiogenesis and bFGF was first isolated pro-angiogenic molecule. VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), VPF (vascular permeability factor) or vasculotropin. Glycoprotein found in a number of tumor cells in rodents and humans - carcinoma of the lung and bladder, fibrosarcoma, promyelocytic leukemia, lymphomas and gliomas. In healthy tissue it is found in activated macrophages, keratinocytes, hepatocytes, smooth muscle cells, the epithelium of bronchi and choroid plexus. It is a specific mitogen for endothelial cells; it is not a mitogen for the other cell types. Mediated secretion and activation of the enzymes involved in the degradation of the extracellular matrix, anti-apoptotic factor for endothelial and tumor cells. VEGF is essential for organizing and recruitment of endothelial progenitor cells from bone marrow and organization of vascularization, modulates migration of endothelial cells. Its expression is stimulated by hypoxia, which is the primary ‘stimulus’. In vivo induced angiogenesis processes simultaneously microvascular permeability. bFGF is the first pro-angiogenic molecule isolated in 1984 by Shing from chondrosarcoma. FGF modulate normal processes such as angiogenesis, wound healing, learning, memory, and embryonic development of the heart, bones and brain, its inadequate expression or other members of the FGF family results in tumor progression. These phenomena lead to the conclusion that the FGF family can be actively involved in a number of pathological conditions as a result of uncontrolled cell proliferation and uncontrolled angiogenesis. FGF-induced neuronal differentiation, survival, regeneration and protects neurons against so-called ‘lesion-induced death’. It stimulates non-mitogenic functions of glial cells such as migration and is established in the areas of hippocampus, brainstem and peripheral ganglia. MATERIALS and METHODS: Subject to research and analyses in the present study are 109 patients whose treatment was conducted by craniotomy and resection of the brain neoplasm within a period of six years. Patients are divided into two main groups - 25 patients tested plasma concentrations of VEGF and bFGF, in 64 of the patients CSF levels of VEGF are investigated. Included are malignant primary brain neoplasms of various nosological units and form two groups: low grade and high grade glioma. Control groups- 20 patients, clinically healthy without evidence of chronic diseases and a group of 11 patients with Meningioma. In dynamics 14 patients are analyzed pre- and postoperatively (in the early postoperative period - 7 days). All patients are histologically diagnosed. Those with gliomas are lethally registered before the end of the analyzed period (December, 2013), in contrast to control groups, in which the mortality is 0...|$|R
