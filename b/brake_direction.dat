Computer-programmable speed controls generally have user-specified options which allow setting low voltage cut-off limits, timing, acceleration, <b>braking</b> and <b>direction</b> of rotation. Reversing the motor's direction may also be accomplished by switching any two of the three leads from the ESC to the motor.|$|R

The risk of skidding increases if the motorcyclist is <b>braking</b> or changing <b>direction.</b> This {{is due to the}} fact that most of the braking and steering control are through the front wheel, while power is delivered through the rear wheel.|$|R

40|$|The {{combination}} of computer vision for lateral guidance and a digital map for navigation {{has been previously}} explored by us on various private premises for the autonomous driving of road vehicles. The experiences gathered thereby has matured {{to the point where}} experiments on public roads, in particular at highway exits and roundabouts, have become feasible and have actually been performed recently. Our experimental platform consists of a van MB 609 D equipped with computer controlled steering, gas, <b>brakes,</b> and <b>direction</b> indicators as well as with trinocular videocamera setup. Image sequences recorded by one - computer selectable - camera from this trinocular setup are evaluated in parallel for lateral guidance {{as well as for the}} detection of intersections. Automatic longitudinal control was performed by evaluating the advance knowledge of road curvature from the digital road map in the navigation system Travelpilot of Robert Bosch GmbH, Stuttgart/Germany. The ability to select automatic ally that video camera which is expected to provide the optimum field of view for the actual phase of an automatic driving maneuvre turns out to provide significant advantages...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Most of radar {{apparatus}} equipped from the 1980 s {{to the early}} part of this century were mainly manual and hydraulic leveling which were time-consuming and of low leveling precision. Thus, to avoid these problems, this paper attempts to design a leveling mechanism, which is driven by AC servo motor and supported by ball screw with high transmission efficiency and carrying capacity. Meanwhile, a new method of braking and self-locking composed of motor <b>braking</b> and single <b>direction</b> non-return bearing is introduced in the paper. This leveling mechanism with the characteristics of small volume, simple structure and high efficiency is of universality and portability...|$|R
50|$|The decision, taken {{only after}} the new model had been {{prepared}} for production, not to build the Ford Cardinal in North America {{was the result of}} a review of “marketing opportunities” in the US market. In 1960 a prototype was delivered to Ford in Cologne. The form of the model that emerged from the production line at Koeln-Niehl two years later would be unchanged. The single all-red rear light cluster was seen as a tell-tale sign of the car’s US provenance at a time when independent (from <b>brake</b> lights) amber <b>direction</b> indicators were increasingly common on European cars. The dished steering wheel was another feature not normally found in European designs of the time.|$|R
60|$|When {{he looked}} up it was to find the night strangely {{luminous}} with fires. There was a bonfire on the extreme end of the bluff, another a hundred paces beyond. A great flare extended over the <b>brake</b> in that <b>direction.</b> Duane heard a roaring on the wind, and he knew his pursuers had fired the willows. He {{did not believe that}} would help them much. The brake was dry enough, but too green to burn readily. And as for the bonfires he discovered that the men, probably having run out of wood, were keeping up the light with oil and stuff from the village. A dozen men kept watch on the bluff scarcely fifty paces from where Duane lay concealed by the willows. They talked, cracked jokes, sang songs, and manifestly considered this outlaw-hunting a great lark. As long as the bright light lasted Duane dared not move. He had the patience and the endurance to wait for the breaking of the storm, and if that did not come, then the early hour before dawn when the gray fog and gloom were over the river.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{and compare}} performance of pushrim-activated power-assisted wheelchairs (PAPAW) (iGLIDE, e-motion, Xtender) on national standards. DESIGN: Engineering performance and safety evaluation. SETTING: A Veteran Affairs and university-based research center. SPECIMENS: Nine PAPAWs. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Static, dynamic stability, brake effectiveness, maximum speed, acceleration, retardation, energy consumption, static, impact, and fatigue strength. RESULTS: There {{was no significant}} difference among the 3 models in forward stability. The iGLIDE was the most stable, whereas the e-motion was the least stable model in the rearward stability tests. All PAPAWs performed equally on the slopes of 3 degrees and 6 degrees in the forward and rearward <b>directions.</b> <b>Braking</b> distance was the highest for e-motion (5. 64 +/- 0. 28 m) and the lowest (1. 13 +/- 0. 03 m) for the iGLIDE in forward direction. The average equivalent cycles of all PAPAWs were 318, 292 +/- 112, 776. 6 cycles (n= 8) on the fatigue tests. All PAPAWs passed the impact and static strength tests. CONCLUSIONS: The standards of the American National Standards Institute and the Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Technology Society of North America could act as quality assurance tool for wheelchairs. The standards for wheelchairs were first approved in 1990; after 17 years, exceeding the minimum values in the standards would be a reasonable expectation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Winter {{sports are}} very entertaining, exciting, and pleasurable {{but they can}} be {{simultaneously}} very dangerous and hazardous with the high ratio of damages. The hostile environment, equipments, devices, and the athlete's lack of sufficient skills cause the increase in the amount of damages and dangers derived from them. One of the winter sports is tube-riding. Because the tube-rider does not have any controls on the tube with regard to the speed control, path <b>direction,</b> <b>brake,</b> and stop, it leads to the high amount of damages; therefore this study aims to investigate the life experiences of the spinal cord injured in the winter sport of tube-riding. The researcher used a quantitative approach of qualitative phenomenology in the study. The participants were the spinal cord injured who were selected among the injured of winter sport of Koohrang tube-riding piste in Chaharrmahal and Bakhtiari province. The sampling was aim based and finally through data saturation, six spinal cord injured were selected for the study. Data were collected by the interviewing the participants deeply and then were noted completely. Data analysis was based on Colaizzi approach. After analyzing the data, the life living up and down theme was elicited. The theme includes four subsets: 1) Physically living ups and down, 2) Mental, psychical, and emotional living ups and down, 3) Economical living ups and down, and 4) Social living ups and down.

40|$|The stage I zoeae ofEbalia tuberosa swam by {{sculling}} {{with the}} exopodites of the 1 st and 2 nd maxillipeds and flexed the abdomen to <b>brake</b> or change <b>direction.</b> The larvae gained depth by stopping all natatory movements and sinking passively at rates of ~ 6 mms - 1. The zoeae refused both living and dead nauplii of Artemia spp., {{as well as}} two species of diatoms, but fed readily on detritic material on the bottom which they scooped up using the endopodites of the maxillipeds and pressed against the mouthparts using the telson. The setae on the posterior border of the telson were used for grooming the maxillipeds and the anterior mouthparts. Day-old stage I zoeae were negatively geotactic, positively phototactic and responded to pressure increases by swimming upwards and by high barokinesis. By the third day some larvae had become positively geotactic but were photopositive, and the majority responded to pressure increases as in the dayold larvae. Five-day old larvae were still photopositive but the majority had become positively geotactic and fewer numbers responded to pressure. Seven-day old larvae failed to respond to any of the stimuli used and assumed a predominantly benthic lifestyle. It is suggested that this anomalous behaviour is related to the dispersal of the larvae and to the specialized habitat requirements of the adults while the rather unusual morphology of the larvae is related to their feeding behaviour and semi-benthic lifestyle. peer-reviewe...|$|R
30|$|MMS in the {{southern}} hemisphere plasma sheet detected consecutive motion of the plasma boundary: first expansion (outward motion) (events 1 – 2) and then equatorward motion (events 3 – 4) during the dipolarizations. These findings are the opposite order of motion of the magnetic disturbances reported near the equatorial flow-braking region, where the Earthward motion of the dipolarization front is followed by tailward propagation of dipolarization (Nakamura et al. 2009). It was shown that the Earthward moving front indeed can result in poleward motion of the front in the near-Earth boundary because of the successively reconnected flux tubes that produce the front (Birn et al. 2013), which may be observed as a front moving outward, with local plasma moving equatorward. Therefore, we may interpret that the two events, (1) and (2), are the near-Earth boundary signatures of flow braking, where the front is produced from successively reconnected field lines with inward plasma motion collapse and results in opposite motion leading to a flux pileup process, {{as well as to}} the outward motion of the front, as predicted in the simulation of flow <b>braking.</b> However, the <b>directions</b> of ion drift and current sheet motion were both Earthward/equatorward for the subsequent events (3) and (4), as is the case for a dipolarization front of Earthward convecting plasmas. Yet, the speeds between the plasma and the front do not agree well, particularly for event (3), which is different from the majority of the dipolarization fronts that showed signatures of a tangential discontinuity (Schmid et al. 2011).|$|R
