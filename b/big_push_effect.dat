40|$|In the introduction, I {{have stated}} the {{motivation}} for the model I will present in this thesis; trust is an important economic asset and may be vital to industrialization, {{which in turn is}} crucial for successful development and increased standards of living in the long run. In the following chapters I will present a model of industrial production and investment, where trust enters the production function and greatly influences investment decisions. In chapter 2, the basic model is presented, firstly, by introducing the economy in which the model unfolds, secondly by presenting the economic agents that enter the model, and lastly, by deducing the agents adjustment and actions. The simple model shows that when successful industrialization is contingent on trust, there are multiple equilibria; the economy may reach either of two possible solutions; one a low trust poverty trap, the other a preferred solution of sustained growth and development. Chapter 3 is an extension of the simple model. The model in this chapter concerns the same economy, and addresses the problems that may arise when there is asymmetric information, and when various types of business contacts differ with respect to trustworthiness. Again two equilibria are possible outcomes. However, it is shown that there are several qualified interpretations of the model; depending on how the population is composed, the predictions of the model will vary. In chapter 3. 3, I examine an economy that consists of producers and predators. The economy may find itself in a crime induced low-trust poverty trap, if the ratio of producers to predators is too low. Conversely, if the ratio is favourable, the economy heads towards a benign equilibrium in which the economy will experience sustained growth and development. The other interpretation is presented in chapter 3. 4; in an economy of advanced producers and cottage producers, the model predicts either coordination failure and a subsequent poverty trap, or a big push out of poverty. Chapter 4 is an extension to the model as interpreted in chapter 3. 4, but the asymmetries of information are less prominent. The predictions of this chapter are that coordination failure (or the <b>big</b> <b>push</b> <b>effect)</b> may occur even when information about business contacts trustworthiness is more readily available. Chapter 5 offers a presentation of the general conclusions, predictions and policy implications of the thesis...|$|E

Various pieces of statistical evidence {{in favor of the}} existence of regional <b>push</b> <b>effects</b> in low- and middle-income economies are marshalled. The origins of these effects in different sorts of externalities and increasing returns to agglomerative scale and scope are analyzed in theoretical terms. Further evidence for the existence of these effects is displayed in a brief review of published case studies of African, Asian, and Latin American regions. A number of observations are then offered on the possibilities of identifying viable developmental policies and practices directed to enhancing the productivity-boosting properties of regions in low- and middle-income economies.

40|$|The {{comparative}} {{history of}} a <b>Big</b> <b>Push</b> in two regions of Northern Honduras elicits that market power can play two important roles in the implementing of a <b>Big</b> <b>Push.</b> Under strong institutions, firms with strategic market power will support the State’s efforts, greatly reducing {{the cost of a}} <b>Big</b> <b>Push.</b> Conversely, when institutions are weak, the presence of market power can undermine the <b>Big</b> <b>Push,</b> as it did in Honduras. To successfully implement a <b>Big</b> <b>Push</b> policy in a weak institutional environment, the government must take costly action to develop competitive markets, and the Push may become unaffordable. The conclusions of the case history are then generalized and operationalized. A theoretical model indicates how considerations of market power can be incorporated in the existing literature, and corroborates the results of the case history. x Support from the Alfred P.

40|$|Rosenstein-Rodan {{proposed}} that if expansionary and developmental policies {{have to be}} pursued, the small changes in fiscal and monetary policy make minor changes in economic growth. So, if a meaningful economic development is the objective carrying out <b>Big</b> <b>Push</b> {{is necessary for the}} policy makers. This hypothesis is in line with Keynesian advice that 'a somewhat comprehensive socialisation of investment is the only means of approximation to the full employment', which was adopted diligently by many economies especially in the developing world. This paper is an attempt of applying the <b>Big</b> <b>Push</b> hypothesis for the policies of Botswana. It reviews the relevant literature in early sections and summarises the argument of <b>Big</b> <b>Push</b> hypothesis.

40|$|Classic <b>Big</b> <b>Push</b> {{industrialization}} envisions state planners coordinating {{economic activity}} to internalize {{a range of}} externalities that otherwise lock in a low-income equilibrium, but runs afoul of well-known government failure problems. Successful <b>Big</b> <b>Push</b> coordination may occur instead when a large business group, acting in its controlling shareholder’s self-interest, coordinates the establishment and expansion of businesses in diverse sectors.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine whether {{absorptive}} capacity can constitute sufficient justification for rejecting the proposal {{of a large}} aid increase to support the ?<b>big</b> <b>push?.</b> We argue that {{the probability of a}} poverty trap exists for many countries, in particular the least developed countries (LDCs) and that an increase in aid is relevant for them. Moreover we show that the decrease in marginal aid returns is slower in vulnerable countries, which supports the rationale to include vulnerability as one of the aid allocation criteria. We examine the main obstacles to absorptive capacity, such as disbursement constraints and short-term bottlenecks, macroeconomic problems, including loss in competitiveness and macroeconomic volatility, as well as the weakening of institutions. The general conclusion that we draw for reconciling the two approaches is that absorptive capacity strongly influenced by aid itself or by its modalities. The <b>big</b> <b>push</b> and absorptive capacity approaches cannot be reconciled without aid reform supported by an aid increase.

This paper addresses the issue of multiple thresholds characterizing the aid/growth relationship. Using a semiparametric econometric method we do find that aid become effective only above a critical level but also become detrimental to growth for higher value of aid flows. We also investigate how the quality of economic policies and vulnerability modifies the level of those two thresholds. We finally propose a dynamic explanation of the aid/growth relationship. economic growth, aid effectiveness, Threshold Models, Semiparametric Regressions...|$|R
