500|$|Roberto Luongo ( [...] ; born April 4, 1979) is a Canadian {{professional}} {{ice hockey}} goaltender for the Florida Panthers of the National Hockey League (NHL). Born in Montreal, Quebec, {{he is of}} Italian and Irish ancestry. He employs the butterfly style of goaltending and has previously played in the NHL for the New York Islanders and the Vancouver Canucks. Luongo is a two-time NHL Second All-Star (2004 and 2007) and a winner of the William M. Jennings Trophy for <b>backstopping</b> his team to the lowest goals-against average in the league (2011; with backup Cory Schneider). He has additionally been {{a finalist for the}} Vezina Trophy as the league's best goaltender (2004, 2007 and 2011), the Lester B. Pearson Award as the top player voted by his peers (2004 and 2007) and the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league's most valuable player (2007).|$|E

[...] Early in the season, he returned to New Jersey {{in a game against}} the Devils and recorded a shutout against his former team in a 4–0 Canucks win on October 20, 1988. [...] He went on to receive his first Vezina Trophy nomination as the league's best goaltender and finished third in voting, losing to Patrick Roy of the Montreal Canadiens. [...] In 1989–90, McLean appeared in his first NHL All-Star Game in Pittsburgh and was the top goaltender at the Skills Competition by allowing the fewest goals against for the Breakaway Relay and Rapid Fire events. [...] He led the league in games and minutes played with 63 and 3,738, respectively. McLean also set Canucks records with 1,797 shots against and 1,581 saves (both marks have since been surpassed). <b>Backstopping</b> the Canucks to 21 wins, 33 losses and 10 ties, he won his first Cyclone Taylor Trophy as Canucks MVP and second Molson Cup.|$|E

500|$|Having {{recovered}} from his injury, he returned for {{training camp in}} September 2007. He {{was assigned to the}} Kings' AHL affiliate, the Manchester Monarchs, after losing a roster spot to goaltenders Jason LaBarbera and Jonathan Bernier. During his stint with Manchester, Cloutier struggled to earn playing time, as younger goaltenders Jonathan Quick, Danny Taylor and Erik Ersberg were given more opportunity to play. At one point, he reported to the team's arena in preparation for a road trip, but was left in Manchester in favour of the team's other goaltenders. To Cloutier's surprise, he was recalled by Los Angeles on February 7, 2008, while Kings backup Jean-Sébastien Aubin was sent down in his place. After clearing re-entry waivers, he joined the Kings' roster to backup LaBarbera. Three days later, Cloutier started in goal against the Columbus Blue Jackets; he recorded his first NHL win in over a year, <b>backstopping</b> the Kings to a 3–2 shootout victory. After LaBarbera became sidelined with a groin injury, Cloutier began earning additional playing time with the Kings. On March 10, he played against the Canucks {{for the first time since}} being traded. He stopped 38 shots in a 2–1 overtime loss against his former teammates. Later that month, he suffered a groin injury and missed three games. Remaining with the Kings for the remainder of the 2007–08 season as backup to Ersberg, he recorded two wins in nine games with a 3.44 GAA and [...]887 save percentage.|$|E

In this paper, we provide a microfoundation for the important role of liquidity <b>backstops</b> in mitigating runs (or, conversely, the role of the lack of liquidity <b>backstops</b> in exacerbating runs) based on a dynamic model of debt runs. We focus on the municipal bond markets for variable rate demand obligations (VRDOs) and auction rate securities (ARS). The different experiences in these markets during the recent financial crisis of 2007 - 09 provide a natural experiment to identify the value of a liquidity <b>backstop</b> in mitigating runs.

40|$|The Green Paradox states that, in {{the absence}} of a tax on CO 2 emissions, subsidizing a {{renewable}} <b>backstop</b> such as solar or wind energy brings forward the date at which fossil fuels become exhausted and consequently global warming is aggravated. We shed light on this issue by solving a model of depletion of non-renewable fossil fuels followed by a switch to a renewable <b>backstop,</b> paying attention to timing of the switch and the amount of fossil fuels remaining unexploited. We show that the Green Paradox occurs for relatively expensive but clean <b>backstops</b> (such as solar or wind), but does not occur if the <b>backstop</b> is sufficiently cheap relative to marginal global warming damages (e. g., nuclear energy) as then it is attractive to leave fossil fuels unexploited and thus limit CO 2 emissions. We show that, without a CO 2 tax, subsidizing the <b>backstop</b> might enhance welfare. If the <b>backstop</b> is relatively dirty and cheap (e. g., coal), there might be a period with simultaneous use of the non-renewable and renewable fuels. If the <b>backstop</b> is very dirty compared to oil or gas (e. g., tar sands), there is no simultaneous use. The optimum policy requires an initially rising CO 2 tax followed by a gradually declining CO 2 tax once the dirty <b>backstop</b> has been introduced.

40|$|AbstractTo {{reveal the}} origin of a <b>backstop</b> and its {{influence}} {{on the evolution of}} the accretionary prism, we analyzed reflection seismic data acquired in the Nankai Trough off the Kii Peninsula. The deformation features of the forearc basin sequence show that the landward accretionary prism close to the coast was not deformed after the development of the forearc basin about 2 – 4 Ma. The surface of the landward prism can be identified as strong amplitude reflector, indicating that the landward prism has higher seismic velocity. Therefore, the landward accretionary prism inferred to be of higher strength constitutes a static <b>backstop.</b> Based on seismic and geologic observations, we interpret that the <b>backstop</b> was generated due to the large age differences of accreted material resulting from an inferred hiatus in subduction between ∼ 13 and 6 Ma. The time-dependent processes such as the igneous activity in middle Miocene further {{contribute to the development of}} the <b>backstop.</b> A ridge structure beneath the forearc basin located trenchward of this <b>backstop</b> and running roughly parallel to it appears to reflect activity on an ancient splay fault. The strike of the ancient splay fault runs parallel to the <b>backstop</b> identified in this study and oblique to the current trench.

Our results indicate a significant impact of <b>backstop</b> lateral tapering in thrust wedge architecture {{in terms of the}} outward propagation of the deformation fronts, the width and elevation of the axial zone, and the timing of thrust polarity reversal along strike.
