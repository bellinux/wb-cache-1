40|$|Abstract. A {{miniature}} display device, recently available commercially, {{is aimed at}} providing a portable, inexpensive means of visual information communication. The display is head mounted {{in front of one}} eye with the other eye's view of the environment unobstructed. Various visual phenomena are associated with this design. The consequences of these phenomena for visual safety, comfort, and efficiency of the user were evaluated: (1) The monocular, partially occluded mode ofoperation interrupts <b>binocular</b> <b>vision.</b> <b>Presenting</b> disparate images to each eye results in binocular rivalry. Most observers can use the display comfortably in this rivalrous mode. In many cases, it is easier to use the display in a peripheral position, slightly above or below the line of sight, thus permitting normal <b>binocular</b> <b>vision</b> of the environment. (2) As a head-mounted device, the displayed image is perceived to move during head movements due to the response of the vestibulo-ocular reflex. These movements affect the visibility of small letters during active head rotations and sharp accelerations...|$|R
40|$|The {{amblyopic}} {{visual system}} was once {{considered to be}} structurally monocular. However, it now evident that the capacity for <b>binocular</b> <b>vision</b> is <b>present</b> in many observers with amblyopia. This has led to new techniques for quantifying suppression that have provided insights into the relationship between suppression and the monocular and binocular visual deficits experienced by amblyopes. Furthermore, new treatments are emerging that directly target suppressive interactions within the visual cortex and, {{on the basis of}} initial data, appear to improve both binocular and monocular visual function, even in adults with amblyopia. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of recent studies that have investigated the structure, measurement and treatment of <b>binocular</b> <b>vision</b> in observers with strabismic, anisometropic and mixed amblyopia...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{perception}} of transparency in <b>binocular</b> <b>vision</b> <b>presents</b> {{a challenge for}} any model of stereopsis. We investigate here how well human observers cope with stereo transparency by comparing their efficiency between transparent and opaque depth judgments. In two experiments, the efficiency measure was computed relative to an ideal observer {{to take into account}} the larger correspondence ambiguity in the transparent condition. We found that thresholds for human and ideal observers were consistently higher in the transparent condition than in the opaque condition, across a range of dot densities (Experiment 1) and disparity ratios (Experiment 2). Efficiencies (the ratio of human to ideal performance) were approximately equivalent for the opaque and transparent conditions across all stimulus conditions. Therefore, the cost for stereoscopic transparency can be accounted for by the greater correspondence problem in that condition. Indeed, the fact that efficiencies were very low, around 1 %, and decreased with increasing dot density demonstrates that human observers use far less information than is available to perform the task. This account contrasts with previous interpretations for the cost in stereoscopic transparency in terms of inhibitory interactions specific to transparent configurations. We relate our findings to a previous and comparable study of motion efficiency, and discuss our findings in terms of a physiologically plausible model...|$|R

We propose that the human visual system contains Cyclopean long-distance comparators (i) that compare the outputs of two narrow receptive fields some distance apart while being insensitive to stimuli located between those receptive fields, and (ii) the outputs of which carry orthogonally labelled indicators of orientation difference, mean orientation, separation and mean location. In the evolutionary context, one role for the proposed mechanisms might be to encode information about the silhouettes of animals whose camouflage is broken by the <b>binocular</b> <b>vision</b> of predators...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDisconjugate (different {{in the two}} eyes) oculomotor {{adaptation}} {{is driven}} by the need to maintain <b>binocular</b> <b>vision.</b> Since <b>binocular</b> <b>vision</b> is deficient in strabismus, we wondered whether oculomotor disconjugate adaptive capabilities are deficient in such subjects. We studied eight adult subjects with constant, long-standing convergent strabismus of variable angles (4 – 30 prism D). No subject had severe amblyopia. <b>Binocular</b> <b>vision</b> was evaluated with stereoacuity tests. Two subjects had peripheral <b>binocular</b> <b>vision</b> and gross stereopsis; two other subjects had abnormal retinal correspondence and abnormal or pseudo gross stereopsis. In the other subjects <b>binocular</b> <b>vision</b> and stereopsis were absent. To stimulate disconjugate changes of saccades, subjects viewed for 20 min an image that was magnified in one eye (aniseikonia). Subjects with residual peripheral <b>binocular</b> <b>vision</b> and even subjects with pseudo or abnormal <b>binocular</b> <b>vision</b> showed disconjugate changes of the binocular coordination of their saccades; these changes reduced the disparity resulting from the aniseikonia. In contrast, for subjects without <b>binocular</b> <b>vision</b> the changes were not correlated with the disparity induced by the aniseikonia.

40|$|Septal {{perforations}} {{are difficult}} {{problems that the}} otolaryngologist has to solve. In fact, the otolaryngologist has to identify the cause, which in most cases is either iatrogenic or idiopathic, to decide upon the need for surgery, and select the most suitable surgical technique of those currently available, for the case under consideration. All surgical procedures, aimed at repair of nasal septal perforations, are based on two main principles, namely repair using mucosal, mucoperichondrial, and/or mucoperiosteal flaps from the nasal cavity, or with connective tissue autograft, to be interposed between the mucosal flaps. Surgical repair of septal perforation {{can be carried out}} using either the “closed technique” or “open technique”. The advantage of the former {{is that it does not}} leave any external scar. However, drawbacks related to difficulties due to the narrow operating field may be encountered. Many surgeons prefer the “open” technique, as it offers a wider operating field, thus allowing better access to the superior and posterior margins of the perforation (especially in large and/or posterior perforations), and offering <b>binocular</b> <b>vision.</b> The <b>present</b> report focuses on a short critical examination of the various surgical procedures described in the literature, in the attempt to identify, based also on personal experience, the most suitable techniques to repair septal perforations.

40|$|With normal <b>binocular</b> <b>vision,</b> maximal stereoacuity {{requires}} an extended viewing duration, {{but the relationship}} between the critical viewing duration for stereopsis and other variables affecting stereoacuity is unknown. The purposes of the study were to investigate the properties of normal temporal integration for stereoscopic vision with respect to the effects of contrast and spatial frequency of the stimuli and to determine whether the temporal summation of disparity is affected in deficient stereopsis caused by abnormal <b>binocular</b> <b>vision</b> during infancy. Psychophysical methods were used to measure stereothresholds in human and monkey subjects with either normal <b>binocular</b> <b>vision</b> or abnormal <b>binocular</b> <b>vision.</b> The results showed that the critical viewing duration for stereoscopic depth discrimination was independent of variations in basic stimulus parameters and/or the subjectÕs stereoacuity. A critical duration of approximately 100 ms was found for both local (narrowband Gabor and broadband line targets) and global (dynamic random dots) stimuli. Although stereothresholds increased with decreasing stimulus contrast, the properties of temporal integration did not. Stereothresholds were substantially elevated for monkeys and humans with abnormal <b>binocular</b> <b>vision,</b> but the critical durations for these subjects were not significantly different from those of subjects with normal <b>binocular</b> <b>vision.</b> Overall, the results demonstrate that the general properties of temporal integration for stereopsis are similar to other detection and discrimination tasks that do not require binocular processing. In addition, increased integration time does not account for the elevated stereothresholds of subjects with abnormal <b>binocular</b> <b>vision...</b>|$|R

Unaided near visual acuity was significantly better in &ldquo;multi&rdquo; group, while unaided distance visual acuity was almost same in both groups. Analysis of intraocular implant influence on the basic <b>binocular</b> <b>vision</b> functions, showed that 42 (84 %) patients in &ldquo;multi&rdquo; and 36 (72 %) patients in &ldquo;mono&rdquo; group had normal finding {{and there was no}} statistically significant difference between the groups.
