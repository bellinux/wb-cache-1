At {{the end of each}} bout/bullfight, the lead forcado will challenge the bull to charge, while the remainder of the team follow the leader.

25|$|Fiesta (originally called Fiesta Brava) starred Williams as Ricardo Montalbán's twin sister, Maria, who {{pretends to}} be her bullfighting brother in hopes of luring him back home. Audiences, and Williams, thought the film was silly, as Williams and Montalbán had vastly {{different}} accents. Montalbán was born in Mexico and was a native Spanish speaker while Williams had a mid-western accent picked up from her Kansas-born parents. Production was difficult with a multitude of problems. By 1947, Gage and Williams were married. Gage had traveled to Mexico for {{the making of the}} film. He got into a fight with an employee of the cast's hotel, was arrested, and subsequently thrown out of the country.The director of photography, Sidney Wagner, and one other crew member died of cholera from eating contaminated street food.

The two had known each other {{for quite a long time}} as Csizmadia served as a prison lieutenant in Puebla when Díaz was held as captive there. On one occasion Díaz refused to be taken to the bathroom by a low-rank prison guard when Csizmadia offered to personally escort him there, which was an unusual courtesy. He even invited the General for a lunch at his house, who accepted it. The lieutenant dealt with his inmate amicably and they even attended a <b>bullfight</b> together. Díaz only refused a closer friendship to evolve because he feared to having been labeled pro-Imperialist, and that would have ruined his image. On 20 September 1865 he successfully escaped from the prison using a rope and a dagger with the acquiescence and consent of the Hungarian officer. He praised Csizmadia's generous and noble attitude towards him several times in his later memoirs. This was the reason he was looking for the captured Csizmadia after the siege and allowed him and his Hungarian regiment to move to Vera Cruz and to be taken home on the board of the Austrian ship SMS Novara along with the rest of the Austrian corps. Csizmadia also helped to negotiate the same terms of surrender for the Austrians as well.|$|E
