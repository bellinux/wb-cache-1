40|$|The G imballed L imb O bserver for R adiance I maging of the A tmosphere (GLORIA) is a {{prototype}} of an imaging Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) for PREMIER, a candidate mission for ESA's Earth Explorer 7. GLORIA is deployed on board various research aircraft like the Russian M 55 Geophysica or the German HALO. The instrument provides detailed infrared images of the Upper Troposphere/Lower Stratosphere (UTLS) region, which {{plays a crucial role}} in the climate system. GLORIA uses a two-dimensional detector array for infrared limb observations in emission and therefore needs large-area <b>blackbody</b> radiation <b>sources</b> (126 mm × 126 mm) for calibration. In order to meet the highly demanding uncertainty requirements for the scientific objectives of the GLORIA missions and due to the sophisticated tomographic evaluation scheme, the spatial distribution of the radiance temperature of the <b>blackbody</b> calibration <b>sources</b> has to be determined with an uncertainty of about 0. 1 K. Since GLORIA is exposed to the hostile environment of the UTLS with mutable low temperature and pressure, an in-flight calibration system has to be carefully designed to cope with those adverse circumstances. The GLORIA in-flight calibration system consists of two identical weight-optimised high-precision <b>blackbody</b> radiation <b>sources,</b> which are independently stabilized at two different temperatures. The two point calibration is in the range of the observed atmospheric infrared radiance emissions with 10 K below and 30 K above ambient temperature, respectively. Thermo-Electric Coolers are used to control the temperature of the <b>blackbody</b> radiation <b>sources</b> offering the advantage of avoiding cryogens and mechanical coolers.

In this paper we describe an experiment using a <b>blackbody</b> <b>source</b> with the modified Martin-Puplett interferometer that is routine- ly used for bunch length measurements at the JLab FEL, as a way to estimate the shortest, measurable bunch length.

40|$|In {{practical}} radiometry, it can {{be helpful}} to consider the diffraction effects on radiation in the short-wavelength limit as well as effects on total power in the high-temperature limit. Following Focke and Blevin, one can exploit limiting behavior of diffraction effects to describe the salient features thereof in an expansion in powers of wavelength or inverse powers of temperature. The Fourier transform of the average photon number per mode for a thermal source, which may be called the “S-function,” is central to assessing the effects on total power because of arrival of radiation at a detector after transiting a variety of path lengths stemming from the Fresnel-Kirchhoff formulation of diffraction. Use of a higher-order boundary diffraction wave method {{and analysis of the}} Mellin transform of the S-function clarifies strategies helpful for treating a myriad of situations, including the following four: (1.) a radiometer viewing a source through a series of two non-limiting baffles; (2.) a radiometer viewing a source through one limiting aperture and one non-limiting baffle located in the aperture’s shadow region; (3.) a radiometer viewing a source through one limiting and one non-limiting baffle between the aperture and radiometer but located in an illuminated region; and (4.) a radiometer viewing an extended source viewed through a pinhole, when the pinhole itself views only a portion of the source because of a limiting aperture located between the pinhole and the source. These situations arise in several practical instances, including several satellite-based total-solar irradiance instruments, collimators with <b>blackbody</b> <b>sources</b> that are used to simulate remote objects, and calibration of <b>blackbody</b> <b>sources</b> used as radiation standards.
