40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that rising bubbles in dense fluids resemble an inverted dripping faucet and that they undergo analogous period-doubling bifurcations to chaos. We present experimental results demonstrating that this analogy is weak because the dominant source of instability in the <b>bubble</b> <b>train</b> is inherently different mutual interactions between spatially separated bubbles as opposed to nozzle dynamics. Unlike the dripping faucet, the initial instability in a <b>bubble</b> <b>train</b> develops at a location far from the injection nozzle and progresses toward the nozzle with increasing gas flow. From both qualitative and rigorous quantitative observations, we conclude that rising-bubble dynamics is best described as "small-box spatio-temporal chaos" with a flow instability. Such dynamics can superficially appear to be simple temporal chaos when considering spatially localized measurements. We show similarity between our experimental results and a bubbleinteraction model that accounts for drag a [...] ...|$|E

For dry liquid foams, the influence of the amount of liquid and of the bubble size is pointed out and we predict theoretically that this influence is closely related to the power law obtained for the force/velocity relation.

However, typically developing children can complete a FB task by about four years old. Previous studies have supported thought <b>bubble</b> <b>training</b> in teaching the FB task to children with ASD. Using dolls and a dollhouse made of blocks, the present study aimed to {{examine the effect of}} thought <b>bubble</b> <b>training</b> on the FB task for Japanese children with typical development. Faces, particularly eyes, are important for understanding others' mental states; therefore, using different types of toys for training, this study focused on this aspect. Our study examined the influence of detailed prints on blocks, including dolls' faces, by comparing printed and non-printed blocks used in the training session. Thus, 61 children from two age groups, namely three and four years, participated in training sessions, with (1) printed toys, (2) non-printed toys, or (3) puzzle play, serving as a control task. After training sessions, four-year-old participants in the printed toy condition exclusively showed significantly increased scores on the FB tasks comprised of memory and mentalizing factors. The results revealed the effectiveness of thought <b>bubble</b> <b>training</b> for the FB task in Japanese four-year-old children in the printed toy condition. The study suggested a significant role for the doll's eyes and other facial features for training mental concepts...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe present {{measurements}} on simple foam structures flowing {{through a narrow}} channel. Driving pressure and bubble velocity {{are found to be}} related by a power law with exponent 2 / 3, thus extending this relationship from single <b>bubble</b> <b>trains</b> (see Bretherton F. P., J. Fluid Mech., 10 (1961) 166) to more complicated foam structures. This nonlinear behaviour is due to the dominant dissipation mechanism, related to the sliding of Plateau borders over the channel walls. For the first time, we show that the prefactor in the power law strongly depends on the foam structure, through the orientation of the Plateau borders with respect to the flow direction. Our evidence suggests that the normal motion largely dominates the dissipation. We discuss implications for quasi-planar rheological experiments on foams confined between glass plates...|$|R

40|$|An {{analytical}} {{model for the}} convective heat transfer coefficient and the two-phase bubble size of a three-phase direct contact heat exchanger was developed. Until the present, there has only been a theoretical model available that deals with a single two-phase bubble and a <b>bubble</b> <b>train</b> condensation in an immiscible liquid. However, to understand the actual heat transfer process within the three-phase direct contact condenser, characteristic models are required. A quasi - steady energy equation in a spherical coordinate system with a potential flow assumption and a cell model configuration has been simplified and solved analytically. The convective heat transfer in terms of Nu number has been derived, and it {{was found to be}} a function to Pe number and a system void fraction. In addition, the two-phase bubble size relates to the system void fraction and has been developed by solving a simple energy balance equation and using the derived convective heat transfer coefficient expression. Furthermore, the model correlates well with previous experimental data and theoretical results...|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} study {{of the effects of}} individual bubbles at high gas flow-rate has shown, that the dominant influence on skin friction over a solid sphere is the bubble volume in compared to bubble frequency. Nevertheless the bubble frequency is very important in case of low gas flow-rate. Referring to bubbles produced by a gas distributor, statistical and spectral analyses were performed to study the influence of bubbling on exposure time and magnitude of fluctuations. Referring to a calibrated <b>bubble</b> <b>train,</b> the existence of critical frequency is demonstrated. A bubble with larger volume and a mobile, oscillatory surface generates larger velocity gradient. In the case of gas distribution, histograms of the velocity gradient for a 2 [*]mm glass sphere creating bubble coalescence reveal the maximum exceeds 48 [*] 000 [*]s− 1 in the front zone and 2000 [*]s− 1 in the rear zone (θ[*]=[*] 180 °).

40|$|Vesiculation of crystallising magma {{can produce}} either a mobile {{vesicular}} magma or a rigid network of crystals containing vesicular liquid. Where partially crystallized rigid mush underlies less-crystallized magma, such as {{near the base}} of a lava flow or in the cumulus pile of a magma chamber, evolved interstitial melt and/or gas may escape into the main body of magma. The consequences of this may include contamination of the overlying liquid with gas and interstitial melt, or intrusion of diapirs of vesicular evolved liquids to form vertical vesicle cylinders and other segregation features found in many basaltic lava flows and sills. Analog experiments were used to investigate some of the phenomena that can arise during vesiculation within a crystal mush, which was simulated by pumping air through a porous plate that formed the floor of a container filled with a viscous liquid floored with a layer of glass beads. Experiments used either a single liquid or two stably stratified liquids with a liquid interface either coincident with the top of the porous layer of beads or slightly above the porous layer. For a range of liquid viscosities and air flow rates (vesiculation rates), individual bubbles emerged {{from the top of the}} porous layer of beads and carried a thin trail of interstitial liquid into the overlying liquid. The number of <b>bubble</b> <b>trains</b> leaving the surface of the porous bed increased with decreasing liquid viscosity and flow rate, and with increasing bead size (and, hence, with increasing permeability). Analog vesicle cylinders, composed of diapirs of bubbly interstitial liquid, were produced only when a layer of buoyant bubbly liquid lay above the surface of the porous layer. The relative size of the bubbles and constrictions within the porous layer are argued to control whether individual bubbles (leading to <b>bubble</b> <b>trains)</b> or vesicular liquid (leading to vesicle cylinders) leaves the porous layer and hence whether vesicle cylinders can form. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{contrast}} to the seismic and infrasonic energy released from quiescent and erupting volcanoes, which have long been known to manifest episodes of highly periodic behavior, the spectral properties of volcanic gas flux time series remain poorly constrained, due to a previous lack of hightemporal resolution gas-sensing techniques. Here we report on SO 2 flux measurements, performed on Mount Etna with a novel UV imaging technique of unprecedented sampling frequency (0. 5 Hz), which reveal, for the first time, a rapid periodic structure in degassing from this target. These gas flux modulations have considerable temporal variability in their characteristics and involve two period bands: 40 – 250 and 500 – 1200 s. A notable correlation between gas flux fluctuations in the latter band and contemporaneous seismic root-mean-square values suggests that this degassing behavior may be generated by periodic bursting of rising gas <b>bubble</b> <b>trains</b> at the magma-air interface...|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} on confined <b>bubble</b> <b>trains</b> {{formed by}} cross-flowing streams {{are carried out}} with the numerical code THETIS {{which is based on}} the Volume of Fluid (VOF) method and has been developed for two phase flow studies and especially for a gas-liquid system. The surface tension force, which needs particular attention {{in order to determine the}} shape of the interface accurately, is computed using the Continuum Surface Force model (CSF). Through the coupling of a VOF-PLIC technique (Piecewise-Linear Interface Calculation) and a smoothing function of adjustable thickness, the Smooth Volume of Fluid technique (SVOF) is intended to capture accurately strong interface distortion, rupture or reconnection with large density and viscosity contrasts between phases. This approach is extended by using the regular VOF-PLIC technique, while applying a smoothing procedure affecting both physical characteristics averaging and surface tension modeling. The front-capturing strategy is extended to gas injection. We begin by introducing the main physical phenomena occurring during bubble formation in microfluidic systems. Then, an experimental study performed in a cylindrical T-junction for different wetting behaviors is presented. For the wetting configuration, Cartesian 2 D numerical simulations concerning the gas-liquid bubble production performed in a T-junction with rectangular, planar cross sections are shown and compared with experimental measurements. Finally, the results obtained of bubble break-up mechanism, shape, transport and pressure drop along the channel will be presented, discussed and compared to some experimental and numerical outcomes given in the literature...|$|R

40|$|Taylor {{bubble flow}} or {{capillary}} slug flow takes place when a low density fluid flows through another relatively high density fluid in {{a tube of}} capillary dimensions. This kind of flow pattern is observed in many engineering devices like pulsating heat pipes, gas-liquid-solid monolithic reactors, micro-two-phase heat exchangers, digital micro-fluidics, micro-scale mass transfer process etc. The flow pattern in such device is very complex and is subjected to several unresolved issues. Hence, {{the understanding of the}} local and global behavior of such flow is important. In the present work, the temperature profile of gas-liquid (a) isolated Taylor bubbles and (b) Taylor <b>bubble</b> <b>train</b> flows has been studied on the basis of varying gas and liquid Reynolds numbers and input heat flux to understand the local and global heat transfer phenomena under specified boundary condition in a horizontal square channel.

40|$|The {{fluctuating}} {{velocity field}} in an air–water bubble column (i. d. 15. 2 cm) {{at a gas}} fraction of 25 % is investigated using backscatter LDA. Since the interpretation of LDA signals in bubbly flows is not straight forward also experiments on a single <b>bubble</b> <b>train</b> are reported. It is discussed that {{in the latter case}} when using seeding the backscatter LDA measures predominantly the liquid velocity. No improvement from thresholding on the discrimina-tion between gas and liquid was found. The bubble column experiments show that the radial averaged liquid velocity profile represents the well known gross scale circulation present in the column. More interesting, it is also seen that the fluctuating velocity field can be studied in great detail. The velocity probability density functions directly indicate high turbulence intensity. Low frequency fluctuations are observed in agreement with visual observations. The data rate is an exponential function of the distance from the column wall. This limits the possibilities of spectral analysis in {{the central part of the}} flow. However, close to the wall the mean data rate is sufficient to study the frequency contents of the signal. It is shown that the power spectral density function obeys a 5 : 3 power law and that the autocorrelation function is of similar shape as reported in literature on bubbly flows. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|International audienceWe {{investigate}} experimentally {{the stability}} of bubble production in yield-stress fluids (YSF) and highly viscous silicone oil, using flow-focusing and T-junction devices. When the exit channel is initially pre-filled with the fluid and the gas is pressure-driven, the production is highly unstable, despite a regular frequency of bubble production in the junction. As observed for pressure-driven <b>bubble</b> <b>trains</b> in Newtonian fluids, we report that two mechanisms can explain these observations : (i) drastic reduction of the hydrodynamic pressure drop along the channel during the transient bubble production, which induces a rapid increase of the gas flow rate and (ii) thin film deposition resulting in a cascade of plug break-up and bubbles coalescence. While the drastic reduction of the pressure drop is inevitable in such two-phase flows, we show that modifying the surfaces of the channel can help stabilizing the system when the continuous phase is a YSF. To do so, we measure {{the thickness of the}} film deposited on the channel wall for rough and smooth channels. Our results are rationalized by introducing the inverse of the Bingham number Bi − 1 comparing the viscous stress to the yield stress. For Bi − 1 ≥ 1, a fast fluidization process associated to efficient deposition of YSF on the channel wall leads to a rapid destabilization of the bubble production. However, for Bi − 1 < 1, the deposition driven by capillarity can be hindered by the wall-slip induced by the existence of the yield stress: the thickness of the deposited film is very thin and corresponds to the equivalent roughness of the channels. It is typically 40 µm thick for rough surfaces and below the limit of resolution of our setup for smooth surfaces. In this regime of Bi − 1 and for smooth surfaces, the length of the plugs barely vanishes, thus the start-up flow is less prone to destabilization. These results therefore potentially open routes to steady production of aerated YSF on smooth channels in the regime of small Bi − 1...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the behavior of foam in porous media at the pore level. Identical, heterogeneous silicon micromodels, two dimensionally etched to replicate flow in Berea Sandstone, were used. The models, already saturated with varying concentrations of surfactant and, at times, oil were invaded with air. Visual observations were made of these air displacement events in an effort to determine foam flow characteristics with varying surfactant concentrations, and differing surfactants in the presence of oil. These displacement events were recorded on video tape. These tapes are available at the Stanford University Petroleum Research Institute, Stanford, California. The observed air flow characteristics can be broadly classified into two: continuous and discontinuous. Continuous air flow was observed in two phase runs when the micromodel contained no aqueous surfactant solution. Air followed a tortuous path to the outlet, splitting and reconnecting around grains, isolating water located in dead-end or circumvented pores, all without breaking and forming bubbles. No foam was created. Discontinuous air flow occurred in runs containing surfactant - with smaller bubble sizes appearing with higher surfactant concentrations. Air moved through the medium by way of modified <b>bubble</b> <b>train</b> flow where bubbles travel through pore throats and tend to reside more statically in larger pore bodies until enough force is applied to move them along. The lamellae were stable, and breaking and reforming events by liquid drainage and corner flow were observed in higher surfactant concentrations.

40|$|A rotating, {{acoustic}} {{gas bubble}} detector, BOB (Bubble OBservatory) module was deployed during two surveys, conducted in 2009 and 2011 respectively, {{to study the}} temporal variations of gas emissions from the Marmara seafloor, along the North Anatolian Fault zone. The echosounder mounted on the instrument insonifies an angular sector of 7 ° during a given duration (of about 1 h). Then it rotates to the next, near-by angular sector and so forth. When the full angular domain is insonified, the “pan and tilt system” rotates back to its initial position, in order {{to start a new}} cycle (of about 1 day). The acoustic data reveal that gas emission is not a steady process, with observed temporal variations ranging between a few minutes and 24 h (from one cycle to the other). Echo-integration and inversion performed on the acoustic data as described in the companion paper of Leblond et al. (Mar Geophys Res, 2014), also indicate important variations in, respectively, the target strength and the volumetric flow rates of individual sources. However, the observed temporal variations may not be related to the properties of the gas source only, but reflect possible variations in sea-bottom currents, which could deviate the <b>bubble</b> <b>train</b> towards the neighboring sector. During the 2011 survey, a 4 -component ocean bottom seismometer (OBS) was co-located at the seafloor, 59 m away from the BOB module. The acoustic data from our rotating, monitoring system support, but do not provide undisputable evidence to confirm, the hypothesis formulated by Tary et al. (2012), that the short-duration, non-seismic micro-events recorded by the OBS are likely produced by gas-related processes within the near seabed sediments. Hence, the use of a multibeam echosounder, or of several split beam echosounders should be preferred to rotating systems, for future experiments...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{the effect of}} gas {{diffusion}} between bubbles on the bubble-size distribution and capillary resistance to foam flow in a <b>bubble</b> <b>train</b> is investigated using an idealized 2 D pore model. First {{the shape of the}} model pore is discussed and how a lamella moves through it. Then the physical forces (lamella curvatures and pressure differences between bubbles) in the pores are explained and how they affect capillary resistance to foam flow. Next the parameters of the dimensionless model are related to measured fluid properties. Under certain conditions (large film permeability to gas, large surface tension, low pressure, small pores, and low velocity of flowing gas) it is possible that characteristic diffusion rate can be greater than imposed convection rate, and that all gas transport is from diffusion across lamellae, not bubble movement. We present model results for different ratios of characteristic diffusion to convection rates. If bubbles are smaller than pores, diffusion reduces the number of bubbles and increases average bubble size, whether convection is imposed on the foam or not. If convection is imposed, lamellae disappear not in pore throats but after first colliding in jumps across pore bodies. If bubbles are larger than pores, diffusion does not increase average bubble size. Diffusion increases the capillary resistance to flow; the increase is greatest when the characteristic rate of diffusion is close to the convection rate. Diffusion increases capillary resistance to flow because lamellae spend more time in positions of greater curvature than in the absence of diffusion. For characteristic diffusion rates much greater or much less than the imposed convection rate the effect of diffusion on capillary resistance to foam flow is modest. These results suggest that by itself, an increase in diffusion rate through lamellae does not make foam flow with less resistance. With diffusion lamellae spend more time in pore throats where capillary resistance to flow is greatest. Geoscience & EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|The LBL {{formaldehyde}} sampler {{consists of}} two parts: 1) a pump box and 2) a small refrigerator housing sampling bubblers. The pump box contains two pumps, a timer, a flow controller, an electrical cord, and a ten-foot piece of tubing to connect the refrigerator to the pump box. The small refrigerator contains four columns of <b>bubbler</b> sampling <b>trains</b> attached to a metal plate. Two sampling trains each are plumbed in parallel to two sampling ports {{on the back of}} the refrigerator. The two sampling lines supplied are to be attached to these ports to allow two locations to be sampled at once (usually one indoor and one outdoor). The refrigerator also contains a rack for holding bubbler tubes. In the sampling process, air is drawn through a sampling line attached to the fitting at the back of the refrigerator and into a prlmary bubbler containing a trapping solution. This trapping solution can be distilled water or an aqueous solution of some compound that reacts with formaldehyde. From this bubbler the air goes through a second bubbler containing the same trapping solution as the first bubbler. (To maintain sample integrity, all parts that the air sample contacts are made of Teflon, polypropylene, and stainless steel.) The air then goes into the third bubbler, which contains no liquid. This bubbler contains a hypodermic needle that serves as a flow-control orifice. The hypodermic needle, in conjunction with the flow controller in the pump box, ensures a constant a flow rate. The refrigerator contains four columns of these sets of three bubblers. After samples have been collected, the bubbler bottoms are detached and the contents of the first and second bubblers in each column are poured together, capped, and labeled. The use of a refrigerated primary and secondary bubbler whose contents are combined at the end of a sampling period ensures 95 % collection efficiency. After the bubbler tubes are capped and labeled, they are stored either in the rack supplied in the refrigerator or in one of the styrofoam shipping boxes with some frozen blue ice. LBL has found that formaldehyde samples collected in water degrade significantly in a matter of hours if they are not kept cool, whereas refrigerated samples remain stable for as long as a month.

40|$|Stellar {{feedback}} {{created by}} radiation and winds from massive stars plays {{a significant role}} in both physical and chemical evolution of molecular clouds. This energy and momentum leaves an identifiable signature ("bubbles") that affect the dynamics and structure of the cloud. Most bubble searches are performed "by-eye", which are usually time-consuming, subjective and difficult to calibrate. Automatic classifications based on machine learning make it possible to perform systematic, quantifiable and repeatable searches for bubbles. We employ a previously developed machine learning algorithm, Brut, and quantitatively evaluate its performance in identifying bubbles using synthetic dust observations. We adopt magneto-hydrodynamics simulations, which model stellar winds launching within turbulent molecular clouds, as an input to generate synthetic images. We use a publicly available three-dimensional dust continuum Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code, hyperion, to generate synthetic images of bubbles in three Spitzer bands (4. 5 um, 8 um and 24 um). We designate half of our synthetic <b>bubbles</b> as a <b>training</b> set, which we use to train Brut along with citizen-science data from the Milky Way Project. We then assess Brut's accuracy using the remaining synthetic observations. We find that after retraining Brut's performance increases significantly, and it is able to identify yellow bubbles, which are likely associated with B-type stars. Brut continues to perform well on previously identified high-score bubbles, and over 10 % of the Milky Way Project bubbles are reclassified as high-confidence bubbles, which were previously marginal or ambiguous detections in the Milky Way Project data. We also investigate the size of the training set, dust model, evolution stage and background noise on bubble identification. Comment: ApJ accepte...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of bubbles {{is the basis}} for injury to divers after decompression, a condition known as decompression illness. In the present study we investigated the effect of endurance training in the rat on decompression-induced bubble formation. A total of 52 adult female Sprague-Dawley rats (300 - 370 g) were {{randomly assigned to one of}} two experimental groups: training or sedentary control. Trained rats exercised on a treadmill for 1. 5 h per day for 1 day, or for 2 or 6 weeks (5 days per week) at exercise intervals that alternated between 8 min at 85 - 90 % of maximal oxygen uptake (V̇O 2,max) and 2 min at 50 - 60 % of V̇O 2,max. Rats were compressed (simulated dive) in a decompression chamber in pairs, one sedentary and one trained, at a rate of 200 kPa min− 1 to a pressure of 700 kPa, and maintained for 45 min breathing air. At the end of the exposure period, rats were decompressed linearly to the ‘surface’ (100 kPa) at a rate of 50 kPa min− 1. Immediately after reaching the ‘surface’ (100 kPa) the animals were anaesthetized and the right ventricle was insonated using Doppler ultrasound. Intensity-controlled interval training significantly increased V̇O 2,max by 12 and 60 % after 2 and 6 weeks, respectively. At 6 weeks, left and right ventricular weights were 14 and 17 % higher, respectively, in trained compared to control rats. No effect of training was observed on skeletal muscle weight. Bubble formation was significantly reduced in trained rats after both 2 and 6 weeks. However, the same effect was seen after a single bout of aerobic exercise lasting 1. 5 h on the day prior to decompression. All of the rats that exercised for 1. 5 h and 2 weeks, and most of those that trained for 6 weeks, survived the protocol, whereas most sedentary rats died within 60 min post-decompression. This study shows that aerobic exercise protects rats from severe decompression and death. This may be a result of less <b>bubbling</b> in the <b>trained</b> animals. The data showed that the increase in aerobic capacity per se was not the main mechanism, but rather an acute effect that was most notable 20 h after a single, or the last, exercise bout, with less effect after 48 h...|$|R
40|$|Condensation {{of steam}} {{in a single}} microchannel, silicon test section was {{investigated}} visually at low flow rates. The microchannel was rectangular in cross-section with a depth of 30 pm, a width of 800 mu m and a length of 5. 0 mm, covered with a Pyrex glass to allow for visualization of the bubble formation process. By varying the cooling rate during condensation of the saturated water vapor, {{it was possible to}} control the shape, size and frequency of the bubbles formed. At low cooling rates using only natural air convection from the ambient environment, the flow pattern in the microchannel consisted of a nearly stable elongated bubble attached upstream (near the inlet) that pinched off into a train of elliptical bubbles downstream of the elongated bubble. It was observed that these elliptical bubbles were emitted periodically from the tip of the elongated bubble at a high frequency, with smaller size than the channel width. The shape of the emitted bubbles underwent modifications shortly after their generation until finally becoming a stable vertical ellipse, maintaining its shape and size as it flowed downstream at a constant speed. These periodically emitted elliptical bubbles thus formed an ordered bubble sequence (train). At higher cooling rates using chilled water in a copper heat sink attached to the test section, the bubble formation frequency increased significantly while the bubble size decreased, all the while forming a perfect <b>bubble</b> <b>train</b> flowing downstream of the microchannel. The emitted bubbles in this case immediately formed into a circular shape without any further modification after their separation from the elongated bubble upstream. The present study suggests that a method for controlling the size and generation frequency of microbubbles could be so developed, which may be of interest for microfluidic applications. The breakup of the elongated bubble is caused by the large Weber number {{at the tip of the}} elongated bubble induced by the maximum vapor velocity at the centerline of the microchannel inside the elongated bubble and the smaller surface tension force of water at the tip of the elongated bubble.
