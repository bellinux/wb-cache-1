5|$|Although a honeyeater in origin, {{the striped}} honeyeater's food source is {{primarily}} insects, and its diet includes seeds and fruits {{as well as}} nectar. Its <b>bill</b> <b>has</b> evolved to a short, straight, sharply pointed shape more suited to probing crevices for insects, than to probing flower tubes. It has the honeyeater’s brush tongue and takes nectar from shallow flowers such as eucalypt blossoms.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Bills</b> <b>had</b> not {{beaten the}} Miami Dolphins {{in the entire}} decade of the 1970s, a streak of twenty {{straight}} losses, the longest in NFL history. The last time the <b>Bills</b> <b>had</b> defeated Miami was 1969.|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{multiple}} <b>bills</b> <b>have</b> {{been introduced}} in Congress to provide relief to unauthorized alien students. In most cases, these <b>bills</b> <b>have</b> proposed to repeal the 1996 provision and enable certain unauthorized alien students to adjust to legal permanent resident (LPR) status in the United States. These <b>bills</b> <b>have</b> often been entitled the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act, or the DREAM Act.

5|$|Although a honeyeater, {{the striped}} honeyeater relies on insects as its major food source, and its <b>bill</b> <b>has</b> been adapted to an insect diet. When not {{breeding}} {{it has been}} recorded feeding and travelling in small groups, but it nests singly, laying around three eggs in a deep cup-shaped nest suspended {{from the end of}} drooping branches. It is widely distributed and common within its range, thus the population is listed as being of least concern for conservation by the IUCN.|$|E

5|$|In the United States {{green was}} {{connected}} with the dollar bill. Since 1861, the reverse side of the dollar <b>bill</b> <b>has</b> been green. Green was originally chosen because it deterred counterfeiters, who tried to use early camera equipment to duplicate banknotes. Also, since the banknotes were thin, the green on the back did not show through and muddle {{the pictures on the}} front of the banknote. Green continues to be used because the public now associates it with a strong and stable currency.|$|E
50|$|Since 1973, {{a number}} of <b>bills</b> <b>have</b> been {{proposed}} to overturn US v. Enmons.

None of these <b>bills</b> <b>have</b> {{made it out of}} committee.|$|R

50|$|In certain limited circumstances, {{service members}} have their cases {{heard by the}} Supreme Court.

5|$|The {{king vulture}} has, {{relative}} to its size, the largest skull and braincase, and strongest bill of the New World vultures. This <b>bill</b> <b>has</b> a hooked tip {{and a sharp}} cutting edge. The bird has broad wings and a short, broad, and square tail. The irises of its eyes are white and bordered by bright red sclera. Unlike some New World vultures, the king vulture lacks eyelashes. It also has gray legs and long, thick claws.|$|E

50|$|On 8 February 2006, it was {{announced}} that the <b>bill</b> <b>had</b> been shelved because of insufficient time to prepare the necessary amendments, but Prime Minister Qarase denied this. The <b>bill</b> <b>had</b> not been shelved, and would not be, he insisted, but it would not be voted upon by the present session of Parliament.|$|R

5|$|As regards a bill {{mentioned}} in paragraph 1, the President, acting {{in accordance with}} the advice of the Cabinet, may refer to a Constitutional Tribunal {{the question of whether the}} bill circumvents or curtails the discretionary powers conferred on him or her by the Constitution. If the Tribunal is of the opinion that the bill does not have this effect, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day after the day when the Tribunal's opinion is pronounced in open court. On the other hand, if the Tribunal feels that the bill does have the circumventing or curtailing effect, and the President either has withheld or withholds his assent to the bill, the Prime Minister may direct that the bill be submitted to the electors for a national referendum. In that case, the bill only becomes law if it is supported by not less than two-thirds of the total number of votes cast at the referendum. If 30 days have expired after a <b>bill</b> <b>has</b> been presented to the President for assent and he or she has neither signified the withholding of assent nor referred the Bill to a Constitutional Tribunal, the bill is deemed to have been assented to on the day following the expiry of the 30-day period. The procedure is similar for a bill {{mentioned in}} paragraph 2, except that if the Constitutional Tribunal rules that the <b>bill</b> <b>has</b> a circumventing or curtailing effect, the Prime Minister has no power to put the bill to a referendum. This ensures that changes to the President's discretionary powers can only be made by way of constitutional amendments and not ordinary statutes.|$|E
5|$|Portland Bill is the {{southern}} tip of the island of Portland. The <b>Bill</b> <b>has</b> three lighthouse towers: The Higher Lighthouse is now a dwelling and holiday apartments; the Lower Lighthouse is now a bird observatory and field centre providing records of bird migration and accommodation for visitors, which opened in 1961. The white and red lighthouse on Bill Point replaced the Higher and Lower Lighthouses in 1906. It is a prominent and much photographed feature; an important landmark for ships passing the headland and its tidal race. The current lighthouse was refurbished in 1996 and became remotely controlled. It now contains a visitors' centre giving information and guided tours of the lighthouse. As of June 2009, the lighthouse uses a 1kW metal-halide US-made lamp with an operational life of about 4000 hours, or 14 months.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Bill</b> <b>has</b> {{become a}} popular drama in the United Kingdom and in many other countries, most notably in Australia. The series {{attracted}} audiences of up to six million viewers in 2008 and 2009. Ratings during 2002 peaked after the overhaul of the show which brought about the 2002 fire episode, in which six officers were killed and the 2003 live episode attracted ten million viewers- {{forty percent of the}} UK audience share. Immediately following The Bills revamping and time slot change, it was reported that the programme had attracted 4.5million viewers, 19% of the audience share, however, it lost out to the BBC's New Tricks with the Daily Mirror later reporting that ITV's schedule change was behind a two million viewer drop in ratings.|$|E

It passed the U.S. House of Representatives on July 19, 2011, but was {{rejected}} by the President and the Senate. The Senate voted to table the bill on July 22. President Obama had promised to veto the <b>bill</b> <b>had</b> it proceeded further.|$|R
50|$|In the 109th Congress (January 2005 to January 2007, {{both houses}} Republican) the Senate <b>bill</b> <b>had</b> number S 3485 {{and the house}} <b>bill</b> <b>had</b> number HR 5635.

5|$|Johnson's first {{tenure in}} the Senate {{came to a}} {{conclusion}} in March 1862 when Lincoln appointed him military governor of Tennessee. Much of the central and western portions of that seceded state had been recovered. Although some argued that civil government should simply resume once the Confederates were defeated in an area, Lincoln chose to use his power {{as commander in chief}} to appoint military governors over Union-controlled Southern regions. The Senate quickly confirmed Johnson's nomination along with the rank of brigadier general. In response, the Confederates confiscated his land and his slaves, and turned his home into a military hospital. Later in 1862, after his departure from the Senate {{and in the absence of}} most Southern legislators, the Homestead Bill was finally enacted. Along with legislation for land-grant colleges and for the transcontinental railroad, the Homestead <b>Bill</b> <b>has</b> been credited with opening the American West to settlement.|$|E
5|$|The male yellow-tailed black {{cockatoo}} has a black bill, a dull yellow patch {{behind each}} eye, and pinkish or reddish eye-rings. The female has grey eye-rings, a horn-coloured bill, and brighter and more clearly defined yellow cheek-patches. Immature birds have duller plumage overall, a horn-coloured bill, and grey eye-rings; The upper beak of the immature male darkens to black by {{two years of}} age, commencing {{at the base of}} the bill and spreading over ten weeks. The lower beak blackens later by four years of age. The elongated <b>bill</b> <b>has</b> a pointed maxilla (upper beak), suited to digging out grubs from tree branches and trunks. Records of the timing of the eye ring changing from grey to pink in male birds are sparse, but have been recorded anywhere from one to four years of age. Australian farmer and amateur ornithologist John Courtney proposed that the similarity between juvenile and female eye rings prevented adult males becoming aggressive to younger birds. He also observed the eye rings to flush brighter in aggressive males. Moulting appears to take place in stages over the course of a year, and is poorly understood.|$|E
