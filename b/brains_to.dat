40|$|ABSTRACT- Technologies of {{the current}} era provide the ability to {{interface}} and communicate directly from one human <b>brain</b> <b>to</b> another. This {{can be done by}} using Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), <b>Brain</b> <b>to</b> <b>Brain</b> Interfaces (BBIs), EEG (electroencephalograph) and the Internet. Computer commands are generated using the brain-to-computer interface (BCI) and these commands are translated <b>to</b> generate <b>brain</b> functions and a form of magnetic stimulation by using computer-to-brain interface (CBI). So a way was discovered to establish a good working link between the brains, thus creating a <b>brain</b> <b>to</b> <b>brain</b> interface. This new innovation can further be applied for people with disabilities or for emergency landing of aircrafts by controlling the hand motions...|$|R

25|$|The use of NDTs or Neutral Density Targets were {{implemented}} inside Cadavers <b>brains</b> <b>to</b> {{focus on the}} impact and separation {{of the brain and}} skull. NDTs provided detailed observations and allowed researchers to look at a specific area of the brain after the crash stimulation. It also helped to establish and develop the FE model. To measure neck injuries for three year olds, the model FE was created. A real child's neck was interpreted and incorporated into the FE model. There are only a few FE models and they were mostly utilized through sled tests.|$|E
25|$|With the {{original}} band back {{together for the}} first time in five years, Bad Brains signed to the Maverick Records label for the 1995 release God of Love. In support of the album, Bad Brains opened for the Beastie Boys on the Ill Communication tour, and headlined a U.S. tour with then-unknown Deftones. However, the reunion did not last for long, because of H.R.'s erratic behavior while performing with the band, such as verbally attacking their manager, beating a skinhead and a security guard in separate incidents throughout the tour. These incidents prompted the Bad <b>Brains</b> <b>to</b> break up once again.|$|E

25|$|Research {{in animals}} {{suggests}} that environmental enrichment aids in recovery from {{an array of}} neurological disorders and cognitive impairments. There are two mains areas of focus: neurological rehabilitation and cognitive reserve, the brain's resistance {{to the effects of}} exposure to physical, natural, and social threats. Although most of these experiments used animal subjects, mainly rodents, researchers have pointed to the affected areas of animal <b>brains</b> <b>to</b> which human brains are most similar and used their findings as evidence to show that humans would have comparable reactions to enriched environments. The tests done on animals are thus meant to represent human simulations for the following list of conditions.|$|E
25|$|Typical MRI studies scan a few {{different}} subjects. To {{integrate the}} results across subjects, one possibility {{is to use a}} common brain atlas, and adjust all the <b>brains</b> <b>to</b> align to the atlas, and then analyze them as a single group. The atlases commonly used are the Talairach one, a single brain of an elderly woman created by Jean Talairach, and the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) one. The second is a probabilistic map created by combining scans from over a hundred individuals. This normalization to a standard template is done by mathematically checking which combination of stretching, squeezing, and warping reduces the differences between the target and the reference. While this is conceptually similar to motion correction, the changes required are more complex than just translation and rotation, and hence optimization even more likely to depend on the first transformations in the chain that is checked.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the skill}} system is freeform, certain {{combinations}} {{of skills and}} equipment work well together. This combination of specialization in skill and equipment is known as an archetype. The most notable archetypes are street samurai, characters who have heavily augmented their bodies with cyberware and bioware and focus on physical combat; adepts, characters who have magical abilities that increase their physical (and sometimes mental) combat abilities; faces, highly charismatic characters who specialize in negotiations and social manipulation; hackers (deckers), experts in electronic surveillance, security, and augmented/virtual reality monitoring, combat and response; riggers, who augment their <b>brains</b> <b>to</b> achieve fine control over vehicles and drones; and magicians, who cast spells and can view emotions and call spirits from astral space. In Fourth Edition, with the setting change, deckers are replaced by hackers, who manipulate computer networks with augmented reality via ubiquitous commlinks; {{they also tend to}} take over the rigger's role.|$|E

25|$|When Lucy {{returns and}} sees the Time Lord, the Doctor reveals {{to her that the}} alien brains {{colonise}} planets by taking control of their prominent leaders, with Earth being their next target. Leaving Lucy to prepare for an interview with Grant's alter ego, the Doctor and Nardole track down the alien's ship in a low orbit and board it via the TARDIS. There, they discover that the ship's reactor is in a critical state and realise from Dr Sim that he intends to drop it on New York. Remembering an observation made by Nardole, the Doctor realises the city would be vaporised except for the Harmony Shoals building. World leaders would then take shelter in the company's other buildings within each capital city, believing Earth was under attack, effectively allowing the <b>brains</b> <b>to</b> take them over. After Dr Sim lets slip the ship is to be dropped at a designated time, the Doctor forces its descent ahead of schedule.|$|E
25|$|The {{premise of}} the game is that the three superpowers, Russia, China, and America, have each {{secretly}} constructed a vast subterranean complex of computers to wage a global war too complex for human <b>brains</b> <b>to</b> oversee. One day, the American supercomputer, better known as the Allied Mastercomputer, gains sentience and absorbs the Russian and Chinese supercomputers into itself, and redefines itself as simply AM (I think, therefore I am). Due to its immense hatred for humanity, stemming from the logistical limits set onto him by programmers, AM uses its abilities to kill off the population of the world. However, AM refrains from killing five people (four men and one woman) in order to bring them {{to the center of the}} earth and torture them. With the aid of research carried out by one of the five remaining humans, AM is able to extend their lifespans indefinitely as well as alter their bodies and minds to his liking.|$|E
25|$|The {{cable network}} {{was able to}} provide a wider library of films for Best <b>Brains</b> <b>to</b> riff from. To assure {{that they would be}} able to produce a funny episode, at least one member of the staff would watch the {{suggested}} films completely, generally assuring that the movie would be prime for jokes throughout; Conniff stated that he often would have to watch twenty films in their entirety before selecting one to use for the show. In one specific case, the second-season episode with the film Sidehackers, they had only skimmed the first part of the movie before making the decision to use it, and only later discovering that it contained a rape scene. They decided to stay committed to the film, but cut out the offending scene and had to explain the sudden absence of the affected character to the audience. After that point, they carefully scrutinized entire films, and once one was selected and assured the rights, committed to completing the episode with that film. Obtaining the rights was handled by the cable networks. Some licensing required buying film rights in packages, with the selected bad movies included in a catalog of otherwise good films, making the negotiations odd since the network was only interested in the bad film. Other times, the rights to the film were poorly documented, and the network would follow the chain of custody to locate the copyright owner as to secure broadcast rights.|$|E

In that excerpt, the author presents {{a study of}} the notion of truth using the concept of subjective fact developed earlier in the book. The author argues that mind-body materialism is compatible with certain forms of metaphysical idealism. The chapter closes with some remarks on relativism with regard to truth. (This document depends heavily upon the concept of subjective fact developed in From <b>Brain</b> <b>to</b> Cosmos. Readers unfamiliar with that concept are strongly advised to read chapters 2 and 3 of From <b>Brain</b> <b>to</b> Cosmos first.

500|$|After the episode's broadcast, Popular Mechanics {{published}} an article analyzing the science depicted.

In addition, Popular Mechanics noted that Walter's theory of the victims' deaths being caused by exhaustion is [...] "pure bunk", as there are many long-term experiments that have safely tested humans' deprivation of REM sleep.

Albert also warned his son of Ernest's endeavors to interfere with the match, commenting, [...] "Your uncle...will try his hand at this work.
