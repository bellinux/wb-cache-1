40|$|A perplexing {{phenomenon}} {{identified in}} several tissues {{is the lack}} of correlation between inhibition of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE 4) and certain functional responses such as smooth muscle relaxation, gastric acid secretion and cAMP accumulation. Interpretation of these data is complicated further by the finding that function correlates with the ability of PDE 4 inhibitors to displace [3 H]rolipram [4 -(3 -cyclopentenyloxy- 4 -methoxyphenyl) - 2 -pyrrolidone] from a high-affinity site in rat brain that is apparently distinct from the catalytic centre of the enzyme. We have investigated this discrepancy by using guinea pig macrophages as a source of PDE 4 and have confirmed that the ability of a limited range of structurally dissimilar PDE inhibitors (Org 20241, nitraquazone and the enantiomers of rolipram and <b>benafentrine)</b> to increase cAMP content did not correlate with their potency as inhibitors of partly purified PDE 4, whereas a significant linear and rank order correlation was found when cAMP accumulation was related to the displacement of [3 H]R-(-) -rolipram from a specific site identified in macrophage lysates. An explanation for these data emerged from the finding that the IC 50 values and rank order of potency of these compounds for inhibition of partly purified PDE 4 and the native (membrane-bound) form of the same enzyme were distinct. Similarly, no correlation was found when membrane-bound PDE 4 was compared with the same enzyme that had been solubilized with Triton X- 100. These unexpected results were attributable to a selective decrease in the potency of those inhibitors [nitraquazone, R-(-) - and S-(+) -rolipram] that interacted preferentially with the rolipram binding site. Indeed, if membrane-bound PDE 4 was used as the enzyme preparation, excellent linear and rank order correlations between inhibition of cAMP hydrolysis, displacement of [3 H]R-(-) -rolipram and cAMP accumulation were found, which improved further {{in the presence of the}} vanadyl (Vo) / 2. GSH complex. Moreover, using Vo/ 2. GSH-treated membranes, the IC 50 values of nitraquazone and the enantiomers of rolipram for the inhibition of PDE 4 approached their affinity for the rolipram binding site. Collectively, these data suggest that the rolipram binding site and the catalytic domain on CPPDE 4 might represent part of the same entity. In addition, these results support the concept that PDE 4 can exist in different conformational states [Barnett, Manning, Cieslinski, Burman, Christensen and Torphy (1995) J. Pharmcol. Exp. Ther. 273, 674 - 679] and provide evidence that the cAMP content in macrophages is regulated primarily by a conformer of PDE 4 for which rolipram has nanomolar affinity...|$|E
