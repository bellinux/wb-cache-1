For detection of the antigen two immunoenzyme tests for the detection of antibodies against Chlamydophila psittaci and a complement fixation test by a Kolmer and indirect immunofluorescence method (BioMerieux, France) were used. From a total of 275 samples of cloacal swabs the presence of Chlamydophila psittaci antigen was detected by ELISA (DAKO Ltd., United Kingdom) in 34. 9 % birds: 45. 5 % in intensive <b>breeding</b> <b>chickens,</b> 12. 1 % in free-living pigeons and 8. 0 % in parrots. By the same method the presence of Chlamydophila psittaci antigen in breeding pigeons was not detected. Sixty cloacal swabs from intensive <b>breeding</b> <b>chickens</b> and pigeons were tested by immunoenzyme test (Unipath Limited, England) and the presence of the pathogen was found in 6. 7 % cases. Fifty-eight sera from free-living pigeons and intensive <b>breeding</b> <b>chickens</b> were tested for the presence of specific antibodies to Chlamydophila psittaci by indirect immunofluorescence method and were found in 42. 1 % examined sera of pigeons, and in 27. 6 % pigeons from the total number of examined birds. The presence of specific antibodies was not found in sera of intensive <b>breeding</b> <b>chickens.</b> Using a complement fixation test, antibodies were not detected in the examined sera in pigeons nor in intensive <b>breeding</b> <b>chickens.</b> The results of this study show that the presence of antigens and antibodies for Chlamydophila psittaci is obvious in tested sera samples, but the clinical disease was not found in any of the examined birds...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Since {{the meat}} of chicken is {{considered}} one of the sources of the human infection, this study was undertaken to compare the prevalence of toxoplasmosis in free-ranging with semi-industrial and industrial chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) in Shiraz, Southern, Iran. 203 serum samples from free-ranging chickens of sub-urban districts, 50 serum samples of semi-industrial chickens which rearing in restricted location and 444 serum samples of industrial chickens from slaughters were collected and tested for toxoplasmosis by IFAT. Overall the rate of Toxoplasma infection in chicken was 10. 04 %. The prevalence of toxoplasmosis among free-ranging chickens was 27. 1 % but the rate in semi-industrial and industrial chickens was 12 % and 2. 02 % respectively. The rate of seropositive chickens in titers of 1 / 16, 1 / 32, 1 / 64, 1 / 128, 1 / 256 and 1 / 512 was 5. 88 %, 2. 44 %, 1 %, 0. 57 %, 0 %and 0. 14 % respectively. Considering the high prevalence of toxoplasmosis in chickens, in the regions under study, control measures should be taken to prevent transmission of the infection to the animals and humans by Health and Veterinary organizations.

40|$|International audienceSince 1998, avian {{reovirus}} (ARV) infection {{has been}} detected in broiler and <b>breeding</b> <b>chicken</b> flocks in Tunisia. The genotype of avian reoviruses was established using simple and rapid approaches. Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) on both sigma C (sigma C) and sigma B (sigma B) -encoding genes followed by {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (RFLP) analyses {{were used to}} better characterize Tunisian isolated strains. The RT-PCR amplified fragments of 738 and 540 bp for sigma C-and sigma B-encoding genes, respectively, of 15 ARV Tunisian strains. DNA fragments amplified from S 1133 vaccine and isolated strains were digested with different restrictions enzymes. RFLP on the sigma C gene indicated that the field isolates and the S 1133 vaccine strain have identical profiles when separately digested with TaqI, PstI, DdeI, and HincII. Considering the sigma B gene, RFLP profiles were identical with RsaI, BclI, DpnII, and NciI restriction enzymes for all the strains. However, using MseI and AciI enzymes, it was shown that all tested isolates could be clearly distinguished from the vaccine strain. ARV strains could be classified in groups with strong relatedness. Strain-typing based on cleavage site results are in agreement with ARV clustering based on nucleotide sequences of both the sigma C and sigma B genes. RT-PCR-RFLP provides a simple and a rapid approach for genotyping ARV isolates, especially when a large number of isolates are being studied. Additionally, this approach may also determine whether a new variant strain has been introduced into a flock or if a given virus strain is being spread from one flock to another...|$|E

40|$|Heat stress {{causes a}} {{decrease}} of fertility in roosters. Yet, the way acute heat stress affects protein expression remains poorly understood. This study investigated differential protein expression in testes of the L 2 strain of Taiwan country chickens following acute heat stress. Twelve 45 -week-old roosters were allocated into four groups, including control roosters kept at 25  °C, roosters subjected to 38  °C acute heat stress for 4  hours without recovery, with 2  hours of recovery, and with 6  hours of recovery. Testis samples were collected for morphologic assay and protein analysis. Some of the differentially expressed proteins were validated by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Abnormal and apoptotic spermatogenic cells were observed at 2  hours of recovery after acute heat stress, especially among the spermatocytes. Two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis revealed that 119 protein spots were differentially expressed in chicken testes following heat stress, and peptide mass fingerprinting revealed that these spots contained 92 distinct proteins. In the heat-stressed samples, the heat shock proteins, chaperonin containing t-complex, and proteasome subunits were downregulated, and glutathione S-transferase, transgelin, and DJ- 1 were upregulated. Our results demonstrate that acute heat stress impairs the processes of translation, protein folding, and protein degradation, and thus results in apoptosis and interferes with spermatogenesis. On the other hand, the increased expression of antioxidant enzymes, including glutathione S-transferase and DJ- 1, may attenuate heat-induced damage. These findings may have implications for <b>breeding</b> <b>chickens</b> that can tolerate more extreme conditions...|$|R

40|$|Knowledge of the {{genetics}} related to growth {{is important for}} <b>breeding</b> <b>chickens</b> with the desired traits of rapid and efficient growth. A long-term selection experiment in the domestic chicken (Gallus gallus) has resulted in two highly divergent lines selected for juvenile body weight. These lines are a great genetic resource to identify the genetic basis of phenotypic variation mainly for growth traits. The aim of this thesis was to map {{the relationship between the}} genotype and phenotype and thereby reveal the genetic architecture of growth in the chicken. To this end, high-density genotyping and whole-genome resequencing of the lines were used to explore {{the genetics}} of the body weight difference between these lines. We further fine- mapped previously identified Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) for body weight and used bioinformatics approaches to identify the most promising candidate genes, mutations and biological pathways for growth for further functional evaluations. We also studied a previously mapped radial network of interacting QTLs to reveal potential biological interactions by analyzing biological pathways. In addition, we developed new computational genetic method and tools and used them to functionally explore specific genetic variants in selected regions in the genome. To functionally evaluate the effect of identified amino acid substitutions (AAS), we developed and implemented a bioinformatics method in a tool called PASE. The predictions of PASE, using physicochemical properties of amino acids, were consistent with other widely available homology-based tools. Our mapping strategy successfully fine-mapped the QTLs, and our bioinformatic strategies were efficient in identifying the candidate mutations and biological pathways for growth. The methods we developed could be applied to the genetic dissection of other complex traits...|$|R
