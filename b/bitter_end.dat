Khánh's contended that only a full sitting of the Armed Forces Council, him included, had the power to make a leadership change. Khánh told Cao of his intention to resist what he saw as an illegal seizure of power. Having concluded that Khánh would fight to the <b>bitter</b> <b>end,</b> Cao went and saw Westmoreland in an open request for help.

They were to commence the breakout under cover of darkness at 11:00 pm that night and then muster in Anhui. Just after 5:00 pm on December 12 Tang arranged for this plan to be transmitted to all units, and then he crossed the Yangtze River, escaping through the city of Pukou on the opposite bank of the river less than twenty-four hours before it was occupied by Japan's Kunisaki Detachment.|$|E

At {{the end of the}} war, with Paraguay suffering severe shortages of weapons and supplies, Solano López reacted with draconian attempts to keep order, ordering troops to kill any of their colleagues, including officers, who talked of surrender.

If another sailor went through the bag, the odds were high the thief would tie the bag back using the more common reef knot, revealing the tampering, hence the name.

To this day the story of things that happened is remembered and spoken of with bated breath by the people of Mandell, who are cousins to the Hungry Folk who live in the west.

25|$|Some people, {{particularly}} in Britain, believe that Eliza Lynch was responsible in inducing Francisco Solano López {{to start the}} Paraguayan War.

She is considered a prominent figure of the war for her support of the troops and her willingness to remain with López until the <b>bitter</b> <b>end.</b> She also introduced the protocol dinners with the ambassadors and ordered to composed several songs as London Karape, this music endure until now. She transformed the Paraguayan woman into her way of dressing and thinking. Lynch is known as Madam or Madama Lynch in Paraguay due to her European origins, the fact that she never married López, and the implications of her past as a courtesan.|$|E
25|$|Those who are {{suffering}} most keenly, and who have lost most, either of their children by death or their possessions by fire and sword, such as those reconcentrated women in the camps, have the most conspicuous patience, and never express a wish that their men should {{be the ones to}} give way. It must be fought out now, they think, to the <b>bitter</b> <b>end.</b> It is a very costly business upon which England has embarked, and even at such a cost hardly the barest necessities can be provided, and no comforts. It is so strange to think that every tent contains a family, and every family is in trouble–loss behind, poverty in front, sickness, privation and death in the present. But they are very good, and say they have agreed to be cheerful and {{make the best of it}} all. The Mafeking camp folk were very surprised to hear that English women cared a rap about them or their suffering. It has done them a lot of good to hear that real sympathy is felt for them at home, and so I am glad I fought my way here, if only for that reason.|$|E
6000|$|... (M46) In 1866 Mr. Gladstone for {{the first}} time voted for the {{abolition}} of church rates. Later in the session he introduced his own plan, not in his capacity as minister, but with the approval of the Russell cabinet. After this cabinet had gone out, Mr. Gladstone in 1868 introduced a bill, abolishing all legal proceedings for the recovery of church rates, except in cases of rates already made, or where money had been borrowed on the security of the rates. But it permitted voluntary assessments to be made, and all agreements to make such payments on the faith of which any expense was incurred, remained enforcible {{in the same manner as}} contracts of a like character. Mr. Gladstone’s bill became law in the course of the summer, and a struggle that had been long and <b>bitter</b> <b>ended.</b>|$|R

When the proof of innocence is found after the condemned prisoner had been put to death, it is too late. (...) It is of course very rare for the proof of innocence to be found on the very next day after an innocent man was executed. Grisham's best literary feat is to create a scenario where this is plausible - due to the quirky and unpredictable personality of the real killer, whose vacillation on coming out with his confession lasts just twenty-four hours too long. (...) The <b>bitter</b> <b>ending,</b> with cynical Texas politicians deciding to go ahead with capital punishments despite such a clear and manifest evidence of their wrongness, is the kind of disappointment with which all opponents of capital punishment are all too familiar in the real world".|$|R
25|$|However, as the English forces encircled Snowdonia and {{his people}} starved he was soon moving desperately from one fort to another as {{effective}} resistance was systematically crushed. Dolwyddelan, which was at risk of becoming encircled, was first abandoned on 18 January 1283. After this Dolbadarn Castle served as his base but by March this noble site {{in the heart of}} Snowdonia was also threatened forcing his departure. Finally, Dafydd moved his headquarters south to Castell y Bere near Llanfihangel-y-pennant. As the situation deteriorated it seems most likely that Dafydd and his family hoped to remain at Y Bere just long enough to avoid the worst of the Welsh winter before they were compelled to evacuate the site at the end of March in advance of the English forces who were manoeuvering to place it under siege. From this point forwards the prince, his family and the remains of his government were fugitives sleeping outdoors, forced to keep moving from place to place to avoid capture. Castell Y Bere's starving garrison would eventually surrender on 25 April. After the fall of Y Bere, Dafydd's movements are speculative but he is recorded in May 1283 leading raids from the mountains supported to the <b>bitter</b> <b>end</b> by Goronwy ap Heilin, Hywel ap Rhys and his brother Rhys Wyndod.|$|E
25|$|The Village had a {{cutting-edge}} cabaret {{and music}} scene. The Village Gate, the Village Vanguard, and The Blue Note (since 1981), regularly hosted {{some of the}} biggest names in jazz. Greenwich Village also played a major role in the development of the folk music scene of the 1960s. Music clubs included Gerde's Folk City, The <b>Bitter</b> <b>End,</b> Cafe Au Go Go, Cafe Wha?, The Gaslight Cafe and The Bottom Line. Three of the four members of The Mamas & the Papas met there. Guitarist and folk singer Dave Van Ronk lived there for many years. Village resident and cultural icon Bob Dylan by the mid-60s had become one of the world's foremost popular songwriters, and often developments in Greenwich Village would influence the simultaneously occurring folk rock movement in San Francisco and elsewhere, and vice versa. Dozens of other cultural and popular icons got their start in the Village's nightclub, theater, and coffeehouse scene during the 1950s, 1960s, and early 1970s, including Jimi Hendrix, Barbra Streisand, Peter, Paul, and Mary, Bette Midler, The Lovin' Spoonful, Simon & Garfunkel, Liza Minnelli, Jackson Browne, James Taylor, Eric Andersen, Joan Baez, The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem, The Velvet Underground, The Kingston Trio, Carly Simon, Richie Havens, Maria Muldaur, Tom Paxton, Janis Ian, Phil Ochs, Joni Mitchell, Laura Nyro, and Nina Simone. The Greenwich Village of the 1950s and 1960s was at the center of Jane Jacobs's book The Death and Life of Great American Cities, which defended it and similar communities, while criticizing common urban renewal policies of the time.|$|E
25|$|Also {{known as}} the I-10 Rivalry since San Antonio and Houston both lie {{on the path of}} the Interstate 10 freeway. The rivalry between the San Antonio Spurs and the Houston Rockets began in 1976 when the Spurs were absorbed into the NBA from the American Basketball Association, along with the Denver Nuggets, the New York Nets, and the Indiana Pacers. The Rockets and Spurs competed for the {{division}} title, with the Rockets winning it first in 1977 and the Spurs in 1978 and 1979. In 1980, they met in the playoffs {{for the first time as}} the Rockets led by Moses Malone and Calvin Murphy beat the Spurs led by George Gervin and James Silas 2–1. The rivalry grew intense as both teams moved from the East to the West. They met again in 1981, this time in the second round. The Spurs had home-court advantage, and were heavily favored, winning the Midwest Division Title and the Rockets only 40–42. The Rockets and Spurs fought to the <b>bitter</b> <b>end</b> before the Rockets held on to win Game 7 capped by Murphy's 42 points. The Rockets would advance to the Finals in a losing cause to the Boston Celtics. The rivalry continued in 1995 when the defending champion Rockets led by Hakeem Olajuwon beat the top-seeded Spurs led by MVP David Robinson in the Western Conference Finals, despite only being the sixth seed, with Olajuwon, who had won the previous year's MVP, being widely regarded as having outplayed Robinson. In a regular season game early in the 2005 season, the Spurs were leading the Rockets very late in the fourth quarter by eight points. Houston's Tracy McGrady went on a personal 13–4 run in the final 35 seconds to miraculously steal the game away from San Antonio, including the game winning 3 pointer with one second remaining to the delight of the Toyota Center crowd.|$|E

Here were copies of letters to foreign princes asking for aid, and to the Papists in Ireland, promising all kinds of concessions if they would rise in his favor. Not only did the publication of this correspondence and of the private letters between the king and queen add to the indignation of the Commons and to their determination to fight to the <b>bitterest</b> <b>end,</b> but it disgusted and alienated a vast number of Royalists who had hitherto believed in the king and trusted to his royal word.|$|R

Leonard Maltin’s Movie Guide referred to the film as [...] "a straightforward melodrama that loses credibility towards the end". All of them, however, lauded Burton’s performance. Dragan Antulov also praised the acting of his co-stars, Connolly, Guard and Bradley. He also found the film to be unexpected and believable {{and went on to}} say, [...] "Absolution takes place in isolated yet realistic setting, and the real source of tension is within the characters. Shaffer never takes sides and until the very end the audience is left to sympathise with different characters, never quite certain who among them is a good or bad. Because of that constant uncertainty, the atmosphere of the film is very dark and unusually <b>bitter</b> <b>ending</b> comes as something quite natural".|$|R
