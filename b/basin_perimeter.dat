However, because of the disparately slow eigenspeed of the vertical mode-two Kelvin wave, the resultant particle transport associated with the vertical mode-two flow near the <b>basin</b> <b>perimeter</b> can drive transport that is comparable with that associated with the Kelvin wave of the lowest vertical mode. It is discovered that nonlinear interaction between the Kelvin-Poincaré wave pair can give birth to a solitary-like wave of large amplitude in an off-shore region.

30|$|Drainage basins, {{catchments}} and sub-catchments are {{the fundamental}} units {{for the management}} of land and water resources (Moore et al. 1994). Morphometric analysis in a drainage basin is important for hydrological investigation and development and management of drainage basin (Rekha et al. 2011). Morphometric parameters and climatic conditions are the key determinants of running water ecosystems functioning at the basin scale (Lotspeich and Platts 1982; Frissel et al. 1986). The quantitative analysis of morphometric parameters is found to have immense utility in river basin evaluation, watershed prioritization for soil and water conservation and natural resource management at watershed level (Malik et al. 2011). The morphometric characteristics of the watershed control all surface runoff, and due to this condition, the watershed is considered an ideal territorial unit (Lima et al. 2011).

Mountain streams provide {{important}} habitats for many species, but their faunas {{are especially vulnerable}} to climate change because of ectothermic physiologies and movements that are constrained to linear networks that are easily fragmented. Effectively conserving biodiversity in these systems requires accurate downscaling of climatic trends to local habitat conditions, but downscaling is difficult in complex terrains given diverse microclimates and mediation of stream heat budgets by local conditions. We compiled a stream temperature database (n = 780) for a 2, 500 km river network in central Idaho to assess possible trends in summer temperatures and thermal habitat for two native salmonid species from 1993 – 2006.

The basin is located in the north-central State of Espirito Santo, Brazil. The analyses were done with the software Spring 5. 2 and ArcGIS 10 using the 90 resolution digital elevation model of the study area obtained from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) The parameters measured were: total number of channels, total number of channels in order, total length of the drainage network (km), total length of channels in order (km), average length of the channel order (km), basin area (km²), <b>basin</b> <b>perimeter</b> (km), length of the main river (km), bifurcation ratio, sinuosity index (%), ratio of the average length of each channel orders (km), basin order, basin form factor, river density, drainage density (km/km²), altimetric amplitude (m), relief ratio (m /km), roughness index, asymmetric factor, coefficient of compactness, and circularity index.

Examples are elevation, stream length, <b>basin</b> <b>perimeter,</b> drainage area, and volume. The concept of geometric similarity can be applied to drainage basins just as it is to many systems. Most readers would be aware of model-prototype studies of aircraft, dams, and turbo machinery. Such studies involve considerations as well as dynamic similarity. In the same manner that inferences as to the operation of a prototype can sometimes be drawn from a geometrically similar model, inferences can also be drawn about the operation of one drainage area on the basis of information obtained from a similar one. Perfect similarity will never be realized if drainage systems are compared, but striking similarities have been observed which can often be put to practical use.

30|$|Fresh {{water is}} the finite entity and is {{directly}} related to population of living being. A watershed is a hydrological unit which generates runoff by itself as a result of precipitation. However, the runoff water depends upon morphology of the watershed. Quantitative analysis of the water in any catchment is very difficult rather than qualitative analysis. Morphometric analysis of streams is an important aspect for characterization of watershed. Proper planning and management of watershed is very necessary for sustainable development of living being. Geo-morphological analysis of a watershed is usually used for evolving the regional hydrological models for resolving different hydrological difficulties of the ungauged watersheds in the absence of data accessibility conditions (Gajbhiye et al. 2014). Morphometric analysis of a drainage basin and its stream channel arrangement can be well understood through the drainage network, aerial and relief aspects, and contributing ground slopes (Nag and Chakraborty 2003). For quantitative analysis of the watershed involving various components such as stream segments, <b>basin</b> <b>perimeter,</b> basin area, elevation difference, slope and profile of land has been responsible for the natural development of basin (Horton 1945). Quantitative analysis of hydrological unit and channel networks has been developed from qualitative research work and valuable contributions. However, Horton’s laws were subsequently modified and developed by several geo-morphologist, which is highly appreciable most notably by Strahler (1952), Leopold and Miller (1956), Schumm (1956), Melton (1957), Morisawa (1957), Strahler (1957, 1958), Scheidegger (1965), Shreve (1967), Gregory and Walling (1973). Morphometric parameters mainly depend upon lithology, bed rock and geological structures. Hence, the information of geomorphology, hydrology, geology and land use pattern is highly informative for reliable study of drainage pattern of the watershed (Astras and Soulankellis 1992). The major objectives of the study include morphometric analysis and prioritization of sub-watersheds is carried out for Piperiya watershed of Hasdeo river basin of Chhattisgarh state of India using remote Sensing and GIS techniques.|$|E
40|$|Field {{observations}} in lakes, where {{the effects of}} the Earth’s rotation can be neglected, suggest that the basin-scale internal wave field may be decomposed into a standing seiche, a progressive nonlinear surge and a dispersive solitary wave packet. In this study we use laboratory experiments to quantify the temporal energy distribution and flux between these three component internal wave modes. The system is subjected to a single forcing event creating available potential energy at time zero (APE). During the first horizontal mode one basin-scale wave period (Ti), as much as 10 % and 20 % of the APE may be found in the solitary waves and surge, respectively. The remainder is contained in the horizontal mode one seiche or lost to viscous dissipation. These findings suggest that linear analytical solutions, which consider only basin-scale wave motions, may significantly underestimate the total energy contained in the internal wave field. Furthermore, linear theories prohibit the development of the progressive nonlinear surge, which serves as a vital link between basin-scale and sub-basin-scale motions. The surge receives up to 20 % of the APE during a nonlinear steepening phase and, in turn, conveys this energy to the smaller-scale solitary waves as dispersion becomes significant. This temporal energy flux may be quantified in terms of the ratio of the linear and nonlinear terms in the nonlinear non-dispersive wave equation. Through estimation of the viscous energy loss, it was established that all inter-modal energy flux occurred before 2 Ti; the modes being independently damped thereafter. The solitary wave energy remained available to propagate to the <b>basin</b> <b>perimeter,</b> where although it {{is beyond the scope of}} this study, wave breaking is expected.
