40|$|Traditional optimal {{operation}} of hydropower station usually has two problems. One {{is that the}} optimal algorithm hasn’t high efficiency, {{and the other is}} that the optimal operation model pays little attention to ecology. And with the development of electric power market, the generated benefit is concerned instead of generated energy. Based on the analysis of time-varying electricity price policy, an optimal operation model of hydropower station reservoir with ecology consideration is established. The model takes the maximum annual power generation benefit, the maximum output of the minimal output stage in the year and the minimum shortage of eco-environment demand as the objectives, and reservoir water quantity <b>balance,</b> <b>reservoir</b> storage capacity, reservoir discharge flow and hydropower station output and nonnegative variable as the constraints. To solve the optimal model, a chaotic optimization genetic algorithm which combines the ergodicity of chaos and the inversion property of genetic algorithm is exploited.

40|$|AbstractThe multi-objective {{scheduling}} of {{maximizing the}} profit and minimising the emission of a Hydro -Thermal System (HTS) using Lagrangian Relaxation-Evolutionary Programming (LR-EP) technique {{has been presented}} in this paper. The various constraints of the hydro and thermal power system network considered are power <b>balance,</b> <b>reservoir</b> storage, turbine flow rate and loading limits of both thermal and hydro plants. Numerical results for a sample test system consist of four hydro and three thermal plants have been presented. The increase in demand for electricity has lead {{to the introduction of}} hydro, nuclear and tidal power stations. Under such cases, it is essential to interconnect hydro and thermal plants so that effective utilization of all the available energy resources can be carried out and demand can be met easily. Since the operational cost of hydropower plant is low, it can be integrated with thermal power plant so that most of the demand can be met by hydro power plant resulting in less usage of fossil fuel consumption for thermal power plants. Unit Commitment (UC) for thermal plants in the deregulated environment has been dealt with in the earlier works showing considerable profit. Here, in this paper a new attempt has been carried out for multiobjective scheduling of hydrothermal power plants for a Generating company (GENCO). It is observed that there is a increase in profit on the inclusion of non-renewable energy source such as hydro power plants, since it reduces the fuel consumption of thermal power plants. This proves the improved effectiveness of the proposed method...|$|E
