25|$|When King James II of England was dethroned in the Glorious Revolution of 1688/9, he is {{supposed}} to have thrown the Great Seal of the Realm into the River Thames before his flight to France {{in order to ensure that}} the machinery of government would cease to function. It is unclear how much truth there is to this story, <b>but</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> seal was recovered: James's successors, William III and Mary used the same Great Seal matrix, fairly crudely adapted – possibly quite deliberately, in order to demonstrate the continuity of government.|$|E
500|$|... {{absolutely}} had to {{have its}} own space. There are percussion elements and a few random sounds in there too, plus the nice guitar track, <b>but</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> main challenge was for all of these tracks to be well balanced and individually audible. It really is very easy to overlook something like that, which can potentially completely change the sound of a record.|$|E
500|$|... "Blame Game" [...] {{generally}} pleased contemporary critics. [...] The Village Voices Sean Fennessey {{said that}} it is [...] "not the flashiest or most forward-thinking song on the album, <b>but</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> most earthbound. And therefore the most important." [...] Chicago Sun-Times writer Thomas Conner complimented Rock's [...] "hilarious, X-rated spiel" [...] and cited the song as the best example of West's ability [...] "to contrast the light and dark pieces against each other, the profane and the sacred", writing that it utilizes [...] "Legend's soft, pretty voice to sing a smooth, troubling refrain." [...] Rolling Stone writer Rob Sheffield called it one of the funniest of West's career, a [...] "confessional" [...] song where he [...] "honestly struggles to figure out why he has to be such a douchebag." [...] Steve Jones of USA Today cited the song as the album's pièce de résistance that [...] "plays out with growing hostility over John Legend's moody piano work." [...] Nitsuh Abebe of New York mused that the song successfully showcased a [...] "gloomy and elegiac" [...] presentation.|$|E

500|$|It {{would be}} January 1997 until the band {{would be able}} to wrap up {{sessions}} for Dude Ranch, eventually amounting to five weeks of recording. For the final touches, Unwritten Law frontman Scott Russo donated a few vocal tracks to [...] "Josie", and Trombino let Blink-182 record a couple of jokes between songs using his sound-effects machine. The group contacted Fletcher Dragge of Pennywise to find someone to remix a few tracks from the album, and he suggested Donnell Cameron of Track Recording Studios. The band went in to Track and re-recorded Raynor's drum tracks for several songs. Hoppus recalled [...] "I remember when we finished Dude Ranch I was so proud. That {{was the first time we}} could take the time and whatever to make a good record." [...] Representatives from MCA dropped by on occasion and were excited by the material they heard. [...] "When we were in there mixing, the A person would come by," [...] remembered Cameron. [...] "I don't think the band really knew what they had <b>but</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> label knew they had so many good songs on the record." [...] DeLonge remembered it differently: [...] " [...] fucking hated pop-punk. They wanted nothing to do with it. They were into Pavement or whatever." [...] After production completed, the album was mastered by Brian Gardner at Bernie Grundman Mastering in Hollywood.|$|E
500|$|After the film's release, {{there was}} {{criticism}} in Uganda of {{its failure to}} state more clearly that Kony and his forces fled northern Uganda in 2006 and were dispersed across the jungles of three neighbouring countries. Fred Opolot, spokesman for the Ugandan government, said, [...] "It is totally misleading {{to suggest that the}} war is still in Uganda." [...] Arthur Larok, ActionAid's director in Uganda, said, [...] "It doesn't sound like a fair representation of Uganda. We have challenges within the country, <b>but</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> perception of a country at war is not accurate at all." [...] Dr Beatrice Mpora, director of a community health organization in Gulu, commented, [...] "There has not been a single soul from the LRA here since 2006. Now we have peace, people are back in their homes, they are planting their fields, they are starting their businesses. That is what people should help us with." [...] Prime Minister of Uganda Amama Mbabazi launched an online response on YouTube, in which he seeks to correct the [...] "false impression" [...] that Uganda is still at war, and invites everyone to visit the country, assuring that people would find it [...] "a very different place to that portrayed by Invisible Children". Meanwhile, dozens of members of Ugandan diaspora in United States protested outside the Invisible Children offices in San Diego, also criticizing the video but saying Kony represents [...] "only three percent of all the problems" [...] in their home country and lambasting the Ugandan government for its inadequate response to Kony's terror and other issues.|$|E
2500|$|Lights {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 65, based on 19 reviews. Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph praised the [...] "lush electro-dance production of Starsmith", stating it [...] "evokes a gushing, breathless rush of heady emotion {{that might have}} benefited from at least a dash of restraint and intimacy." [...] Mike Diver of BBC Music described the album as [...] "an expectations-passing collection that should see fans of the singer's material to date elevating her to superstar status—perhaps not Gaga league, <b>but</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> equal of the current solo female du jour, Florence Welch", adding that [...] "ballads like 'The Writer' and 'I'll Hold My Breath' retain the glossy attraction of singles 'Under the Sheets' and 'Starry Eyed'." [...] AllMusic's Matthew Chisling commented that the album [...] "lacks the dramatic crash and bang of Florence and the Machine's Lungs, but is certainly a more restrained, compelling listen than the debut records by Pixie Lott and Little Boots", commending Goulding for her ability to [...] "take {{the best parts of}} all of her contemporaries' styles and create pleasantly surprising records." ...|$|E

5|$|While not as {{well known}} as Mortification, fellow Australian band, Vomitorial Corpulence was widely known as the first Christian grindcore band. The band had minor success <b>but</b> <b>certainly</b> helped <b>the</b> Extreme metal side of Christian metal.|$|R
5000|$|For {{an unknown}} period, <b>but</b> <b>certainly</b> in <b>the</b> 1890s he edited (or [...] "conducted") a 1 penny {{fortnightly}} periodical entitled [...] "The Minute, illustrated" [...] A sort of Readers Digest of contemporary Victorian society. Supported by much advertising.|$|R
6000|$|We all {{burst into}} a fit of laughter, for {{undoubtedly}} it was a frog, <b>but</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> largest by far {{that any of us}} had ever seen. It was quite as large as a chicken! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me," [...] Chris said, [...] "that instead of gaining ground {{we are losing}} it. We can't see at all what is going on, <b>but</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> firing seems nearer than it was." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{certainly}} seems {{to hold out}} a prospect of success, so far, Leigh. I {{have never been able}} to understand your confidence in success, <b>but</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> first indication of your plan seems to promise well. Now, let us hear some more of it." ...|$|E
50|$|The Second Battle of Acentejo was <b>certainly</b> not <b>the</b> last {{battle on}} Tenerife between the Spaniards and <b>the</b> Guanches, <b>but</b> was <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> most decisive, {{resulting}} in the ultimate incorporation of the island into the kingdom of Castile and the final subjugation of the aborigines.|$|R
50|$|However, Emsig Law {{eventually}} {{prevailed in}} the area, probably {{as a result of}} the emergence of the tom Brok dynasty, <b>but</b> <b>certainly</b> by <b>the</b> time of Cirksena hegemony. In the early 16th century, Edzard I then based his East Frisian Law (Ostfriesisches Landrecht) on the Emsig Law.|$|R
50|$|Its {{relationship}} is confusing. Its closest relatives are probably, <b>but</b> not <b>certainly,</b> <b>the</b> Hawaiian shearwater (Puffinus newelli) {{and possibly the}} little shearwater (Puffinus assimilis).

6000|$|He had {{his good}} qualities, the general owned.

6000|$|... "Well, I {{must see}} if I can find her, Myra. If not, I must use the charcoal, <b>but</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> other {{would be much}} the safer; and, you see, thanks to my long stay with you before, I have got to speak French very fairly now." ...|$|E
6000|$|Oh! Tom's {{blood was}} rising; mind that! Perhaps the Boar's Head had {{something}} to do with it, <b>but</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> footman had. So had the sight of his pretty sister--a great deal to do with it. Tom could bear a good deal himself, but he was proud of her, and pride is a sensitive thing. He began to think, 'there are more Pecksniffs than one, perhaps,' and by all the pins and needles that run up and down in angry veins, Tom was in a most unusual tingle all at once! ...|$|E
50|$|The {{geographic}} {{definitions of}} the South Bronx have evolved and are disputed <b>but</b> <b>certainly</b> include <b>the</b> neighborhoods of Mott Haven, Melrose and Port Morris.

50|$|The tablets {{mentions}} Niqmi-Epuh votive status {{which he}} dedicated to Hadad {{and placed it}} in that Deity Temple, tablet AlT*11 informs of his return from Nishin, a place not known before <b>but</b> <b>certainly</b> inside <b>the</b> territory of Yamhad because the tablet seems to refer to travel and not a military campaign.|$|R
5000|$|Music critic Alex Henderson, {{writing for}} Allmusic, wrote the album [...] "is hardly {{the work of}} a Celtic purist. <b>But</b> it's <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> work of an artist who isn't afraid to take risks, and Baker's chance-taking spirit makes for an interesting, unorthodox project that can hardly be called generic." ...|$|R
60|$|For mine own part, I {{have seen}} many my self, and those Church- members too, so deckt and bedaubed with their Fangles and Toyes, {{and that when}} they {{have been at the}} solemn Appointments of God, {{in the way of his}} Worship, that I have wondred with what face such painted persons could sit in the place where they were without swounding. <b>But</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> holiness of God, and also the {{pollution}} of themselves by sin, must needs be very far out of the minds of such people, what profession soever they make.|$|E
60|$|Thus was Britain, after a {{struggle}} of fifty-four years, entirely bent under the yoke, and moulded into the Roman Empire. How so stubborn an opposition, {{could have been}} so long maintained against the greatest power on earth by a people ill armed, worse united, without revenues, without discipline, has justly been deemed an object of wonder. Authors are generally contented with attributing it to the extraordinary bravery of the ancient Britons. <b>But</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> Britons fought with armies as brave as the world ever saw, with superior discipline, and more plentiful resources.|$|E
60|$|On {{the other}} hand, all the real masters of {{caricature}} deserve honor in this respect, that their gift is peculiarly their own--innate and incommunicable. No teaching, no hard study, will ever enable {{other people to}} equal, in their several ways, the works of Leech or Cruikshank; whereas, the power of pure drawing is communicable, within certain limits, to every one who has good sight and industry. I do not, indeed, know how far, by devoting the attention to points of character, caricaturist skill may be laboriously attained; <b>but</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> power is, in the masters of the school, innate from their childhood.|$|E
50|$|Extreme winter maxima in the {{district}} are remarkably warm for its latitude and on January 19, 1921 Spearfish reached a remarkable 79 F, not only the hottest January temperature in South Dakota on record, <b>but</b> almost <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> hottest temperature recorded in or near mid-winter anywhere {{so far from the}} equator.|$|R
5000|$|Dom Passantino, Drowned in Sound: [...] "CSI: Ambleside {{is one of}} {{the peaks}} in an already unimpeachable back {{catalogue}} because it sticks to what makes HMHB such a great band". ...

6000|$|... "It is {{very cool}} and {{pleasant}} here," [...] Harry said, after lying without speaking {{for a few}} minutes. [...] "It was dreadfully hot in that hut, {{in the middle of}} the day; and I used to feel that I lost almost as much strength, in the day, as I picked up at night. I am wonderfully better this evening. Of course, that long sleep had something to do with it, and the pleasure of being free and with you had still more; <b>but</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> coolness, and the air blowing through that opening, have counted for something." ...|$|E
6000|$|When we {{officers}} clambered at last {{upon the}} poop, {{he seemed to}} come out of that numbed composure, and shouted to us down wind: [...] "Try the pumps." [...] Afterwards he disappeared. As to the ship, I need not say that, although she was presently swallowed up in one of the blackest nights I can remember, she did not disappear. In truth, I don't fancy that there had ever been much danger of that, <b>but</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> experience was noisy and particularly distracting-- and yet it is the memory of a very quiet silence that survives.|$|E
6000|$|... "Besides, {{where could}} we go?" [...] the Doctor asked. [...] "The {{garrison}} at Cawnpore, we know, are besieged by overwhelming numbers. We {{do not know}} much as to the position at Lucknow, <b>but</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> Europeans are immensely outnumbered there, and I think we may assume that they are also besieged. It is a very long distance either to Agra or to Allahabad; and with the whole country up in arms against us, and the cavalry here at our heels, the prospect seems absolutely hopeless. What do you think, Doolan? You and Rintoul have your wives here, and you have children. I consider that the question concerns you married men more than us." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{usage of}} storyboards, {{animatics}} or drawings {{is not exactly}} the same as throwaway prototyping, <b>but</b> <b>certainly</b> falls within <b>the</b> same family. These are non-functional implementations but show how the system will look.|$|R

40|$|The {{discussions about}} CETA, the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement between Canada and the European Union, have focused almost {{exclusively}} on two questions.
