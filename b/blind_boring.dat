40|$|Isolated {{high grade}} and low tonnage uranium ore pods are {{prevalent}} in Saskatchewan. This thesis reviews mining such a pod with both conventional and unconventional methods. The geomechanical {{characteristics of the}} overburden and the bedrock {{in the area of}} the pods must be investigated before evaluating the technical feasibility of possible mining methods. Conventional ore recovery techniques appraised include open pit and underground mining. The unconventional mining techniques considered are <b>blind</b> <b>boring</b> and jet boring from surface. These last two techniques can offer a greater degree of selectivity, although ground reinforcement techniques had to be considered due to the poor quality of the ground. Ground reinforcement techniques considered were shaft lining, grouting, and ground freezing. This mining design challenge was found to be feasible with the combination of jet boring and freezing. Recommendations are presented to define future areas of study for <b>blind</b> <b>boring,</b> jet boring, grouting, and freezing...|$|E
40|$|DE 10321253 B UPAB: 20041001 NOVELTY - The wall (1) of the {{building}} has its first side on the outside (2) of {{the building}} and the second side (3) facing the interior of a room. A <b>blind</b> <b>bore</b> oscillator drilled into the wall from this side and is filled with a heat conducting metal rod (5) with an insulating plastics sheath (6). DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The dew sensor (7) with a grid of electrical conductors is mounted flush with the inner surface of the wall, {{at the end of the}} rod. The other end of the rod is in contact with the wall masonry, near the midline of the wall. Formation of dew lowers the electrical resistance of the sensor. USE - Sensor detecting presence of moisture dew of condensation on surface of wall facing into room. ADVANTAGE - Presence of moisture may be monitored, giving warning of conditions likely to encourage growth of mould...|$|R
50|$|The first length {{standards}} {{to use this}} technique were rectangular section solid bars. A <b>blind</b> hole was <b>bored</b> at each end, to {{the depth of the}} neutral plane, and the calibration marks were made at this depth. This was inconvenient, as it was impossible to measure directly between the two marks, but only with an offset trammel down the wells.|$|R
40|$|A {{latching}} {{device is}} disclosed which is lever operated sequentially to actuate {{a set of}} collet fingers to provide a radial expansion and to actuate a force mechanism to provide a compressive gripping force for attaching first and second devices to one another. The latching device includes a body member having elongated collet fingers which, in a deactuated condition, is insertable through bores on {{the first and second}} devices so that gripping terminal portions on the collet fingers are proximate {{to the end of the}} bore of the first device while a spring assembly on the body member is located proximate to the outer surface of a second device. A lever is rotatable through 90 deg to move a latching rod to sequentially actuate and expand collet fingers and to actuate the spring assembly by compressing it. During the first 30 deg of movement of the lever, the collet fingers are actuated by the latching rod to provide a radial expansion and during the last 60 deg of movement of the lever, the spring assembly acts as a force mechanism and is actuated to develop a compressive latching force on the devices. The latching rod and lever are connected by a camming mechanism. The amount of spring force in the spring assembly can be adjusted; the body member can be permanently attached by a telescoping assembly to one of the devices; and the structure can be used as a pulling device for removing annular bearings or the like from <b>blind</b> <b>bores...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} industry generally takes a conservative attitude towards adopting innovations. Previous research {{has tended to}} focus on information technology instead of heavy construction equipment. Also, the ‘process’ of adopting of new construction technologies by companies remains unexplored until now. In the previous part of the research the initial stages of technology adoption were examined including identification of the range of options available and comparison of the options in order to determine and collect any information that is missing for any of the options. With this in mind, this paper presents the initial investigation into the next part (phase) of the technology adoption process, which is found to involve analysis of the most viable options, involving a demonstration of the technology on the user’s site and / or discussion with other technology users, and the making of the final decision. A total of 35 interviews with participants from Australia and 63 from North America were undertaken. Participants {{from both sides of the}} process (i. e. customers and vendors) were chosen in order to cross-validate the findings of each group using triangulation. A total of 96 technologies were identified ranging in cost from $ 0. 75 M to $ 45 M, including mobile / tower cranes, concrete pumps, and <b>blind</b> <b>bore</b> shaft drills. The analysis revealed that a customer passes through three stages to make the adoption decision from the point where the customer is in the position to short list the number of technology options and vendors. The outcome confirmed the original hypothesis that the adoption process has well-defined stages starting with: a) Information analysis; b) technology evaluation; and c) adoption decision. These three stages are mirrored by vendor activities which respond to potential adopters. The analysis also highlighted the importance of word of mouth, feedback from experienced technology users, and negotiation in the process...|$|R
5000|$|Single-point threading, {{where the}} {{workpiece}} is rotated, and a pointed cutting tool is {{fed into the}} workpiece {{at the same rate}} as the pitch of the internal thread. Single-pointing inside a <b>blind</b> hole, like <b>boring</b> inside one, is inherently more challenging than doing so in a through hole. This was especially true in the era when manual machining was the only method of control. Today, CNC makes these tasks less stressful, but nevertheless still more challenging than with through holes.|$|R
2500|$|On October 15, 1965, Brian went to {{the studio}} with a 43-piece {{orchestra}} to record an instrumental piece entitled [...] "Three <b>Blind</b> Mice", which <b>bore</b> no musical connection to the nursery rhyme of the same name. Another instrumental, called [...] "Trombone Dixie", was recorded. According to Brian, [...] "I was just foolin' around one day, fuckin' around with the musicians, and I took that arrangement out of my briefcase {{and we did it}} in 20 minutes. It was nothing, there was really nothing in it." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{his review}} in The New York Times, Bosley Crowther observed, [...] "a {{large part of}} this picture is curiously casual and slow, as Van Johnson, as the <b>blind</b> man, <b>bores</b> the {{mischief}} out of everybody with his hazy suspicions [...] [...] [...] [...] for that matter, he bores the audience, too. Lots of unimpressed fellows were ho-humming in the balcony at Loew's State yesterday [...] [...] [...] matters do start popping about half or {{two-thirds of the way}} along, when it is finally discovered, through various coincidences, that something has been cooking all the time. But you have to depend on Mr. Johnson — and Nigel Balchin, the screenwriter — to give you the details after they've been discovered. This is not {{a good way to get}} people interested in a mystery show [...] [...] [...] it would be a more exciting picture if it got going with a little more snap, established a more compelling mystery and built up some genuine suspense." ...|$|R
50|$|Soon {{after leaving}} college {{he went into}} the grocery {{business}} in Hartford, in which he continued till about 1816. In 1818 the firm of Hudson & Goodwin, of which his father was a member, was dissolved, and the firm of George Goodwin & Sons succeeded to the business of printing, publishing and bookselling—the leading interest then being the issue of the Connecticut Courant, a weekly paper, of which they retained control until 1836, and for which, as well as for other publications, they manufactured the paper at their mill in East Hartford. To give more attention to this manufacture, which gradually became their leading business, George Goodwin, Jr., removed, in 1821, to East Hartford, where he spent an active and useful life until 1861, when the mills passed into other hands. Soon after this his sight began to fail, and in 1868 he became totally <b>blind.</b> He <b>bore</b> this trial with Christian submission, keeping up to the last his interest in books and general affairs. He represented East Hartford three times in the Connecticut Legislature. He died at his home in Burnside, East Hartford, Conn., February 8, 1878.|$|R
60|$|After a lapse {{of fifteen}} years he rediscovered this {{interesting}} world, about {{which so many}} people go incredibly <b>blind</b> and <b>bored.</b> He went along country roads while all the birds were piping and chirruping and cheeping and singing, and looked at fresh new things, and felt as happy and irresponsible as a boy with an unexpected half-holiday. And if ever the thought of Miriam returned to him he controlled his mind. He came to country inns and sat for unmeasured hours talking of this and that to those sage carters who rest for ever in the taps of country inns, while the big sleek brass jingling horses wait patiently outside with their waggons; {{he got a job}} with some van people who were wandering about the country with swings and a steam roundabout and remained with them for three days, until one of their dogs took a violent dislike to him and made his duties unpleasant; he talked to tramps and wayside labourers, he snoozed under hedges by day and in outhouses and hayricks at night, and once, but only once, he slept in a casual ward. He felt as the etiolated grass and daisies must do when you move the garden roller away to a new place.|$|R
