5|$|A {{blast furnace}} {{converts}} raw iron ore into pig iron, {{which can be}} remelted in a cupola furnace to produce cast iron. The earliest specimens of cast iron found in China date to the 5th century BC during the late Spring and Autumn period, yet the oldest discovered <b>blast</b> <b>furnaces</b> date to the 3rd century BCE and the majority date to the period after Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141–87 BCE) established a government monopoly over the iron industry in 117 BCE (most of the discovered iron works sites built before this date were merely foundries which recast iron that had been smelt elsewhere). Iron ore smelted in <b>blast</b> <b>furnaces</b> during the Han was rarely if ever cast directly into permanent molds; instead, the pig iron scraps were remelted in the cupola furnace to make cast iron. Cupola furnaces utilized a cold blast traveling through tuyere pipes from the bottom and over the top where the charge of charcoal and pig iron was introduced. The air traveling through the tuyere pipes thus became a hot blast once it reached {{the bottom of the}} furnace.|$|E

The successful substitution of coke for charcoal is widely attributed to Abraham Darby in 1709. The efficiency of the process was further enhanced by the practice of preheating the combustion air (hot blast), patented by James Beaumont Neilson in 1828.|$|E

To derive the influence mechanism of effects of the <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> gas flow speed within the pipeline on the dust deposition laws in the butterfly valve region, a 3 D model of the butterfly valve and its regional flow field is built with Pro/E software. Based on FLUENT module of ANSYS Workbench, along with standard k-ε turbulence model and DPM model, simulation analysis of moving trajectories of dust particles in butterfly valve region under 3 <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> gas flow speeds is conducted.

40|$|The {{reduction}} behaviour of the olivine {{iron ore}} pellet MPBOwas studied in laboratory scale at KTH {{as well as}} in the LKABexperimental <b>blast</b> <b>furnace.</b> Initially, a newreduction-under-load, or so-called reduction/softening/melting,test equipment was developed. Experiments using differentreducing conditions, corresponding to different radialpositions of the <b>blast</b> <b>furnace,</b> were conducted. The experimentsincluded different temperature profiles, reducing atmospheresand mechanical loads applied on the sample bed to simulate thevarying conditions in the <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> process. The progressof reduction was investigated, as well as the processes ofsintering and contraction during reduction. A model of thecarburisation (pick-up of carbon by the reduced iron) andmelt-down process during rapid contraction was presented. Laboratory testing of MPBO pellets was compared with resultsfrom the LKAB experimental <b>blast</b> <b>furnace.</b> The reduction of ironore pellets in the experimental <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> was surveyed by adissection of the furnace after quenching. The high temperaturephenomena occurring when reducing the MPBO pellet, with limitedsoftening and a short temperature range of the melting process,resulting in a thin cohesive zone, were found to be the same inlaboratorytests and in the experimental <b>blast</b> <b>furnace.</b> Thereduction down through the burden of the experimental blastfurnace was similar, but not identical to the results of theRUL experiments. The differences were found to be due todifferent reducing conditions. Therefore, it was concluded thata simulation of the reduction occurring in the blast furnacecan be performed in laboratory scale, provided the experimentalconditions are correctly chosen. Finally, a modification to further improve the properties ofthe MPBO pellets was examined. With the aim to improve theblast furnace process, coating of <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> pellets wasinvestigated in laboratory scale, {{as well as in}} the LKABexperimental <b>blast</b> <b>furnace.</b> Olivine, dolomite and quartzitewere used as coating agents.
