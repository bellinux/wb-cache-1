Murali Kartik, a spinner who had previously played for Somerset, ran out Somerset batsman Alex Barrow who was <b>backing-up</b> at the non-striker's end. Batty declined several invitations by the umpires to withdraw the appeal leading to bad feeling between the teams and around the ground.

500|$|Brown {{returned}} to first-class cricket in 1947–48, scoring 192 runs at 38.40 {{in the first}} three matches of the season. The season saw an Indian tour of Australia. The selectors initially dropped Barnes to pair Brown with Morris to open the batting. Apart from two Tests during the 1936–37 season against England, Brown had not played Test cricket on Australian soil. He had only one opportunity with the bat in the First Test in Brisbane, making 11 as India fell to an innings defeat. It was to be his only innings and Test match on his home ground. Brown's participation in the series was overshadowed by his controversial run out by Indian left arm orthodox spinner Vinoo Mankad in the Second Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground in December 1947. Brown was run out for 18, when in the act of delivering the ball, Mankad held on to it and whipped the bails off at the non-striker's end. Brown was well out of his crease while he was <b>backing-up</b> the striker, so that he could get a head start in case he attempted a run. This was the second time during the season that Mankad had dismissed Brown in this fashion—as he had previously done so a match against an Australian XI in November. On that occasion, Mankad had warned Brown before running him out. The local press strongly accused Mankad of being unsportsmanlike, although some Australians—including Bradman—defended Mankad's actions. For his part, Brown took full blame and made light of the incident through humorous gestures in later matches, which referred to the event. After this incident, if a batsman is given out this way, he {{is said to have been}} [...] "Mankaded".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the fifth}} ODI game, England batsman Jos Buttler was {{controversially}} run out <b>backing-up</b> at the non-striker's end by Sri Lankan bowler Sachithra Senanayake, a dismissal called Mankading. Senanayake had warned Buttler twice {{before in the}} same game about moving out of his crease, before he removed his bails and appealed to umpire Michael Gough. Speaking after the game, Sri Lankan captain Angelo Mathews defended the decision by saying [...] "what we did was completely within the rules." [...] England coach Peter Moores said he was [...] "disappointed" [...] in Mathew's decision. Former England captain Michael Vaughan said it was [...] "no way to play the game", but another former captain, Michael Atherton, defended the decision saying [...] "You {{see a lot of}} batsmen wandering aimlessly out of their ground. It's a good lesson for him - don't be dozy and keep your bat in your crease". [...] Australian captain Michael Clarke said that [...] "I think as long as the player's warned, it's in the rules so you can make whatever decision you want". Buttler's dismissal by Senanayake was the first instance of Mankading in international cricket since Peter Kirsten's innings was ended by Kapil Dev during an ODI between South Africa and India in 1992.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an approach, {{based on the}} qualitative theory of nonlinear dynamical systems, for the analysis and design of control systems for autonomous articulated vehicles. In particular, <b>backing-up</b> maneuvers are considered. These maneuvers are dangerous be-cause the vehicles tend to ‘jackknife ’ when the angle between the tractor and the trailer is greater than a certain value. This danger is increased when the actuators are saturated because they can cause a lack of controllability in the state space and control becomes com-plicated. The paper proposes a two-level control system with an ori-entation controller in the lower level and a look-ahead controller in the higher. In the paper, a general orientation feedback controller is presented. This control strategy represents a wide family of differ-ent nonlinear controllers and can be applied with different particular control laws.

40|$|Abstract. Menu-hierarchy is an {{important}} mechanism for human-computer interaction. In this paper we report the design, prototyping, and experiences of an experimental system called ACOSys for automated organization of contents by menu/folder hierarchies. ACOSys is built on a similar principle of our other work, FcAWN – formal concept analysis for web navigation-menu design [32], where lattice theory [1] provides the mathematical basis for menu-structures while the user-interface remains unchanged. Implemented in Java and Perl, our experimental prototype has the following features: (a) automated generation of folder hierarchy; (b) automatic folder-name assignment; (c) pruning for global folder-depth control; (d) lattice-unfolding to obtain trees that allow for <b>backing-up.</b> An experiment study is performed for ACOSys to generate an organization of the Medlars collection, an archive of 1039 medical articles commonly used for information retrieval benchmarking. ACOSys created a hyper-link navigation hierarchy {{in a couple of}} minutes based on a ten attribute set; a desktop web-browser is used to test and validate the hierarchy. The basic idea of ACOSys comes from our recognition that menu-structures can be regarded as mathematical structures in the abstract sense and, in return, they can benefit from an order-theoretic investigation. An additional recognition is that tree-structures are important to facilitate the <b>backing-up</b> operation for folder hierarchies, but the tension between trees and lattices can be resolved by unfolding lattices to trees. ...|$|E
