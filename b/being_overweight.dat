25|$|However, {{these figures}} do not {{distinguish}} between people at a low or healthy weight who are in fact overweight, between those whose self-perception as <b>being</b> <b>overweight</b> is incorrect and those whose perception of <b>being</b> <b>overweight</b> is correct. Recent developments, such as the Body Volume Index have addressed this problem in part by measuring weight distribution, but although 3D images of ourselves help to improve body perception, an objective appraisal of our own body image remains a difficult task for us to undertake.|$|E

25|$|Tonga {{is notable}} for its high obesity rates with over 90% of the {{population}} <b>being</b> <b>overweight.</b> Consequently, many Tongan islanders have {{an increased risk of}} heart disease, diabetes and other obesity related diseases which place the nation's health service under considerable strain. Much of this is related to the nation's cultural love of food and eating as well as the modern influx of cheap and high-fat content meat, with corned beef and lamb belly remaining firm favourites in Tongan cuisine. Despite being a highly obese population, there is little stigma attached to <b>being</b> <b>overweight</b> as one might find in many Western civilizations. Like a great number of South Pacific cultures, large bodies are often revered, though there is growing acknowledgment of the health risks involved.|$|E
