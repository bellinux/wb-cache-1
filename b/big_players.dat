5|$|The 1985–86 {{series in}} the West Indies ended in another {{whitewash}} with the West Indies winning each Test comfortably, the closest match being a seven wicket victory. Like the previous series the English batsmen provided little resistance against the West Indian bowlers with only Gower averaging above 30. Poor performances from Botham and Mike Gatting's injury ensured an easy series win for the West Indies. England’s attitude also {{played a part in}} their defeat with <b>big</b> <b>players</b> such as Gower and Botham showing a certain reluctance to net training. The then chairman of selectors Peter May questioned the team's attitude and called for greater resolve, a view that seemed to be shared by the general public at the time.|$|E

500|$|Arsenal only {{managed a}} draw against West Bromwich Albion on 20 November 2004; Robert Earnshaw's goal with 11 minutes {{remaining}} of normal time cancelled out Pirès’s opener. Arsenal lost their final match of November, away to Liverpool at Anfield. Vieira finished off a one-touch move to equalise for Arsenal – who were {{behind in the}} first half – but Neil Mellor scored the winning goal of the game, shooting from long range. Football pundit Alan Hansen in his analysis on Match of the Day criticised the temperament of Arsenal’s players and questioned their desire: [...] "When you have success, sometimes it isn't there and you have to dig in with great determination and hard work, and at the moment they are not doing that. When you look at their two <b>big</b> <b>players,</b> Henry and Vieira, [...] must do better in future." [...] Arsenal ended the month in second, five points behind leaders Chelsea.|$|E
2500|$|During {{this period}} as a younger composer, {{arranger}} and producer, Curnow {{was able to}} help usher in a new, more vital concept and style for the orchestra which helped appeal to a younger music audience of the post big band/rock n' roll era. [...] Due to deteriorating business conditions with the Stan Kenton Orchestra and Creative World Records, Curnow resigned from his post in 1976. [...] Curnow is quoted as to the frustration he encountered, [...] "I was burnt out...I really didn't like the record business...it's a dirty game working with the <b>big</b> <b>players</b> and all the crap that goes on there".

It was the deference of equality, and Daylight could not escape the subtle flattery of it; for he was fully aware that in experience as well as wealth they were far and away beyond him.|$|E

5000|$|In the 1970s Ken Uston was {{the first}} to write about a tactic of card {{counting}} he called the <b>Big</b> <b>Player</b> Team. The book was based on his experiences working as a [...] "big player" [...] (BP) on Al Francesco's teams. In big-player blackjack teams a number of card counters, called [...] "spotters," [...] are dispatched to tables around a casino, where their responsibility is {{to keep track of the}} count and signal to the <b>big</b> <b>player</b> when the count indicates a <b>player</b> advantage. The <b>big</b> <b>player</b> then joins the game at that table, placing maximum bets at a player advantage. When the spotter indicates that the count has dropped, he again signals the BP to leave the table. By jumping from table to table as called in by spotters, the BP avoids all play at a disadvantage. In addition, since the BP's play appears random and irrational, he avoids detection by the casinos. The spotters, who are doing the actual counting, are not themselves changing their bet size or strategy, so they are relatively inconspicuous.|$|R
