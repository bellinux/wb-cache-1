40|$|These days blogs are {{becoming}} increasingly popular because it allows anyone to share their personal diary, opinions, and comments on the World Wide Wed. Many blogs contain valuable information, {{but it is a}} difficult task to extract this information from a high number of <b>blog</b> <b>comments.</b> The goal is to analyze a high number of <b>blog</b> <b>comments</b> by clustering all <b>blog</b> <b>comments</b> by their similarity based on keyword relevance into smaller groups. TF-IDF weight has been used in classifying documents by measuring appearance frequency of each keyword in a document, but it is not effective in differentiating semantic similarities between words. By applying fuzzy semantic to TF-IDF, TF-IDF becomes fuzzy TF-IDF and has the ability to rank semantic relevancy. Fuzzy VSM can be effective in exploring hidden relationship between <b>blog</b> <b>comments</b> by adapting fuzzy TF-IDF and fuzzy semantic for extending Vector Space Model to fuzzy VSM. Therefore, fuzzy VSM can cluster a high number of <b>blog</b> <b>comments</b> into small number of groups based on document similarity and semantic relevancy...|$|R

40|$|The ease of posting {{comments}} and links in blogs has attracted spammers {{as an alternative}} venue to conventional email. An experimental study investigates the nature and prevalence of blog spam. Using Defensio logs, the authors collected and analyzed {{more than one million}} <b>blog</b> <b>comments</b> during the last two weeks of June 2009. They used a support vector machine (SVM) classifier combined with heuristics to identify spam posters' IP addresses, autonomous system numbers (ASN), and IP blocks. Experimental results show that more than 75 percent of <b>blog</b> <b>comments</b> during the reporting period are spam. In addition, the results show that blog spammers likely operate from a few colocation facilities. © 2006 IEEE...|$|R

50|$|A <b>blog</b> <b>comment</b> {{hosting service}} is a service which {{externally}} hosts comments posted by users to blog or online newspaper posts. Many such services allow for users to log into a <b>blog</b> <b>comment</b> hosting service using social network profile credentials {{such as those of}} Facebook Connect, Yahoo!, Google, LinkedIn, Myspace, etc. Such services may also have an effect upon instances of comment spam, as prior registration with comment hosts may be the only means by which to make comments onto many blogs.|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, blogs have {{exploded}} in number, popularity and scope. However, many commentators and researchers speculate that blogs isolate readers in echo chambers, cutting them off from dissenting opinions. Our empirical paper tests this hypothesis. Using a hand-coded sample of over 1, 000 comments from 33 of the world’s top blogs, {{we find that}} agreement outnumbers disagreement in <b>blog</b> <b>comments</b> by more than 3 to 1. However, this ratio depends heavily on a blog’s genre, varying between 2 to 1 and 9 to 1. Using these hand-coded <b>blog</b> <b>comments</b> as input, we also show that natural language processing techniques can identify the linguistic markers of agreement. We conclude by applying our empirical and algorithmic findings to practical implications for blogs, and discuss the many questions raised by our work. 1...|$|R

50|$|Instead of only storing foreign keys, it {{is common}} to store actual foreign values along with the model's data. For example, each <b>blog</b> <b>comment</b> might include the {{username}} in addition to a user id, thus providing easy access to the username without requiring another lookup. When a username changes however, this will now need to be changed in many places in the database. Thus this approach works better when reads are much more common than writes.|$|E

50|$|The {{case was}} also of {{interest}} to those in personnel and employment law because {{it was one of}} the first high profile examples of someone in the UK being fired for <b>blogging</b> <b>comments.</b> On a later appeal Gordon, with representation from his union, the RBA, was successful and it was admitted that the dismissal was wrong, although the company still disapproved of the <b>blogging</b> <b>comments</b> but acknowledged it should have been dealt with in a less severe manner. However, by this point Gordon had been approached by comics and SF bookstore Forbidden Planet International; an amicable agreement was reached with Waterstone's. Gordon works for Forbidden Planet International's website and, ironically, set up and maintains their popular blog as part of his duties; he is still fielding questions from individuals, law students and the media on the subject.|$|R
