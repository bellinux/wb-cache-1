5|$|Canada golden-rod (Solidago canadensis) {{appeared}} in 2003 {{as a result}} of plant deposits. The threat proved to <b>be</b> <b>serious</b> the following year. Some stations show a significant concentration of the species, while isolated plants grow everywhere on the site. This plant is easily pulled by hand before flowering to prevent seed dispersal, and the shoots are burned.|$|E
5|$|Grasshoppers {{have had}} a long {{relationship}} with humans. Swarms of locusts can have devastating effects and cause famine, and even in smaller numbers, the insects can <b>be</b> <b>serious</b> pests. They are used as food {{in countries such as}} Mexico and Indonesia. They feature in art, symbolism and literature.|$|E

5|$|Mollusc {{species can}} also {{represent}} hazards or pests for human activities. The {{bite of the}} blue-ringed octopus is often fatal, and that of Octopus apollyon causes inflammation that can last for over a month. Stings from a few species of large tropical cone shells can also kill, but their sophisticated, though easily produced, venoms have become important tools in neurological research. Schistosomiasis (also known as bilharzia, bilharziosis or snail fever) is transmitted to humans via water snail hosts, and affects about 200million people. Snails and slugs can also <b>be</b> <b>serious</b> agricultural pests, and accidental or deliberate introduction of some snail species into new environments has seriously damaged some ecosystems.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} molluscs, {{particularly}} certain snails and slugs, can <b>be</b> <b>serious</b> crop pests, and when introduced into new environments, can unbalance local ecosystems. One such pest, the giant African snail Achatina fulica, {{has been introduced}} to many parts of Asia, {{as well as to}} many islands in the Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean. In the 1990s, this species reached the West Indies. Attempts to control it by introducing the predatory snail Euglandina rosea proved disastrous, as the predator ignored Achatina fulica and went on to extirpate several native snail species, instead.|$|E
5|$|The {{many forms}} of dance provide {{entertainment}} for all age groups and cultures. Dance can <b>be</b> <b>serious</b> in tone, such as when {{it is used to}} express a culture's history or important stories; it may be provocative; or it may put in the service of comedy. Since it combines {{many forms of}} entertainment music, movement, storytelling, theatre it provides {{a good example of the}} various ways that these forms can be combined to create entertainment for different purposes and audiences.|$|E
50|$|Modern flat Earth {{societies}} {{consist of}} individuals {{who believe that the}} Earth is flat rather than an oblate spheroid.

5|$|Tuatara {{feature in}} a number of {{indigenous}} legends, and are held as ariki (God forms). Tuatara are regarded as the messengers of Whiro, the god of death and disaster, and Māori women are forbidden to eat them. Tuatara also indicate tapu (the borders of what is sacred and restricted), beyond which there is mana, meaning there could <b>be</b> <b>serious</b> consequences if that boundary is crossed. Māori women would sometimes tattoo images of lizards, some of which may represent tuatara, near their genitals. Today, tuatara are regarded as a taonga (special treasure).|$|E
5|$|Grasshoppers eat large {{quantities}} of foliage both as adults and during their development, and can <b>be</b> <b>serious</b> pests of arid land and prairies. Pasture, grain, forage, vegetable and other crops can be affected. Grasshoppers often bask in the sun, and thrive in warm sunny conditions, so drought stimulates an increase in grasshopper populations. A single season of drought is not normally sufficient to stimulate a massive population increase, but several successive dry seasons can do so, especially if the intervening winters are mild so {{that large numbers of}} nymphs survive. Although sunny weather stimulates growth, there needs to be an adequate food supply for the increasing grasshopper population. This means that although precipitation is needed to stimulate plant growth, prolonged periods of cloudy weather will slow nymphal development.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} {{cockatoo}} can <b>be</b> <b>serious</b> agricultural pests. They are sometimes controlled by shooting, poisoning or capture followed by gassing. Non-lethal damage mitigation methods used include scaring, habitat manipulation {{and the provision}} of decoy food dumps or sacrifice crops to distract them from the main crop. They can be a nuisance in urban areas due to destruction of property. They maintain their bills in the wild by chewing on wood but, in suburbia, they may chew outdoor furniture, door and window frames; soft decorative timbers such as western red cedar are readily demolished. Birds may also target external wiring and fixtures such as solar water heaters, television antennae and satellite dishes. A business in central Melbourne suffered as sulphur-crested cockatoos repeatedly stripped the silicone sealant from the plate glass windows. Galahs and red-tailed black cockatoos have stripped electrical cabling in rural areas and tarpaulin is targeted elsewhere. Outside Australia, the Tanimbar corella is a pest on Yamdena Island where it raids maize crops.|$|E

5|$|The only damage {{she took}} that year {{occurred}} 30 April 1943, {{while she was}} changing stations on formation, Milwaukee struck Omahas starboard bow. The collision destroyed one of her paravanes and rupturing some plating, which caused some flooding. Omahas damage control party shored up one hole with two mattresses {{and were able to}} stop the leak. One compartment was completely flooded with another compartment requiring pumping out every two hours. On Milwaukee, the 6-inch guns and torpedo tubes on her port side were unserviceable. Several holes had opened up along her port side that were above the main deck, along with some leaks under the waterline from damage to plates and rivets. Milwaukee also lost her No.3 main circulation pump. The damage was determined not to <b>be</b> <b>serious</b> enough to halt their mission and the two cruisers, after completing their patrol, put into Rio de Janeiro for the needed repairs at the Brazilian Navy Yard.|$|E

25|$|Domestic {{violence}} and societal {{discrimination against women}} continue to <b>be</b> <b>serious</b> problems.

There are reports of trafficking in persons.|$|E
