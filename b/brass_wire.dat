The plaster ceiling dates from then, with its elaborate cornice supporting a deep coffered cove in each corner of which are clusters of grapes, the flat centre of the ceiling has elaborate decoration, including in the border of the central panel mermen holding and feeding a griffin. The main entrance is in the centre of the long north wall. There are chimneypieces in the centre of each end wall. These are of white marble with flanking caryatids, the jambs are of black marble, one dates from 1792 which is a copy of the other probably dating from the 1760s. Above each chimneypiece is a mirror. The bookcases are of mahogany there are over five hundred shelves on the lower walls and they have their original doors with <b>brass</b> <b>wire</b> grilles. The walls are completely covered by the shelving, and even the walls between the seven windows of the south wall. The upper two hundred and forty shelves are accessed via a gallery running around the east, north and west walls. The over 20,000 volumes that were on these shelves, largely collected by the 1st Marquess of Buckingham were sold in January 1849, at Sotheby's, the sale lasted 24 days. There is a series of three marble busts in the windows that were sold from the house in 1921 but have been repurchased. These are: 1st Duke of Buckingham and Chandos by Raimondo Trentanova, Frederick III, German Emperor and Victoria, Princess Royal both carved by Tito Angelini. Also there are small busts above the bookcases on the window wall, Homer, Francis Bacon, Isaac Newton, Horace, Demosthenes and another of Homer. These were sold in 1921 but donated to the House and returned to their original positions.|$|E

40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the development of}} a compact reactor for oxidative steam-reforming of methanol (OSRM) to produce hydrogen in autothermal mode for fuel cells. The string reactor uses catalytically active <b>brass</b> <b>wires</b> with a diameter of 500 mm placed in parallel into a tube. The micro-channels in the reactor for gases are formed between the wires presenting hydrodynamics similar to the one in multi-channel micro-reactors. Due to the high thermal conductivity of brass, the heat generated during methanol oxidation at the reactor entrance is transferred to the zone of the endothermic steam-reforming. The catalysts are prepared by Al-alloy formation {{on the surface of the}} <b>brass</b> <b>wires</b> followed by the partial leaching of Al. The catalyst presents a porous layer with the morphology of Raney metals and the chemical composition consistent with the Cu/Zn/Al-mixed oxide. The catalyst surface was additionally modified by incorporating chromium leading to Cr/Cu-spinel. This decreases the degree of the reduction of copper oxide and sintering leading to a stable catalyst. The catalyst was tested in OSRM showing high activity and selectivity to carbon dioxide and hydrogen. The string reactor presents nearly isothermal profile since the temperatures gradient within the reactor length is about 3 K. Micro-structured string reactor presents a short start-up and a fast transient behavior showing a rapid temperature change when adjusting the oxygen amount introduced into the reactor...|$|R
2500|$|Handmade {{paper is}} {{manufactured}} using a metal screen {{held in a}} wood frame which is dipped into a paper slurry, after which the frame is shaken in a particular manner to set the fibers of the paper and form a sheet, which is then removed to dry. The screen would usually have attached a design made of copper or <b>brass</b> <b>wire</b> which would leave a slight impression or watermark in the sheet of paper. In his 1952 article [...] "Watermarks are Twins", Stevenson discussed a fact that few bibliographers then understood, that handmade paper in earlier periods was ordinarily manufactured using twin moulds, the screens of which bore a near duplicate wire image producing almost identical, but nevertheless distinguishable, watermarks. Two workers would use a pair of frames acting in tandem, one using a frame to dip into the paper slurry while the second (the [...] "coucher") would shake the other frame to set the fibers and would then remove the paper to dry. He also observed that, as the screens were used repeatedly to make paper, the wire figures would suffer distortion, pieces of them sometimes breaking loose and having to be retied to the screen. A stock of paper manufactured by hand thus would contain two closely similar watermarks which define the stock for bibliographic purposes, or as Stevenson said, [...] "watermarks like wrens go in pairs." [...] A particular watermark could be uniquely identified by its position {{with respect to the}} [...] "chainlines" [...] formed by the metal screen, its state of freshness or deterioration, and the precise locations where it was tied or retied to the screen, which show up as dots in the watermark. He would later use these basic observations to date the manufacture of paper used in early printed books.|$|E
2500|$|Bassoon reeds, made of Arundo donax cane, {{are often}} {{made by the}} players themselves, {{although}} beginner bassoonists tend to buy their reeds from professional reed makers or use reeds made by their teachers. Reeds begin with a length of tube cane that is split into three or four pieces using a tool called a cane splitter. The cane is then trimmed and gouged to the desired thickness, leaving the bark attached. After soaking, the gouged cane is cut to the proper shape and milled to the desired thickness, or profiled, by removing material from the bark side. This {{can be done by}} hand with a file; more frequently it is done with a machine or tool designed for the purpose. After the profiled cane has soaked once again it is folded over in the middle. Prior to soaking, the reed maker will have lightly scored the bark with parallel lines with a knife; this ensures that the cane will assume a cylindrical shape during the forming stage. On the bark portion, the reed maker binds on one, two, or three coils or loops of <b>brass</b> <b>wire</b> to aid in the final forming process. The exact placement of these loops can vary somewhat depending on the reed maker. The bound reed blank is then wrapped with thick cotton or linen thread to protect it, and a conical steel mandrel (which sometimes has been heated in a flame) is quickly inserted in between the blades. Using a special pair of pliers, the reed maker presses down the cane, making it conform to the shape of the mandrel. (The steam generated by the heated mandrel causes the cane to permanently assume the shape of the mandrel.) The upper portion of the cavity thus created is called the [...] "throat," [...] and its shape has an influence on the final playing characteristics of the reed. The lower, mostly cylindrical portion will be reamed out with a special tool called a reamer, allowing the reed to fit on the bocal.|$|E

40|$|Novel micro-structured string-reactor {{designed}} as catalytically active wires placed in parallel into a tube was developed. The small {{diameter of the}} channels (∼ 100 �m) leads to a short radial diffusion time, a narrow residence time distribution (RTD), and a low pressure drop. This reactor was applied for the oxidative steam-reforming of methanol (OSRM) to produce hydrogen in autothermal mode for fuel cells. The heat generated during methanol oxidation at the reactor entrance is axially transferred to the reactor zone of the endothermic steam-reforming. The <b>brass</b> metal <b>wires</b> (Cu/Zn = 4 / 1) were used as precursors for the preparation of string-catalysts. The <b>brass</b> <b>wires</b> have high thermal conductivity (120 W/(m K)) and the chemical composition {{is similar to the}} active phase of the Cu/ZnO/Al 2 O 3 traditional catalyst during the steam-reforming of methanol. Brass-based string catalysts are obtained by metal/aluminium alloy formation on the outer surface of wires followed by an acid treatment leaching out aluminium. This treatment leads to an increase of the specific surface area (SSA) due to the formation of porous outer layer on the wire surface. The porous outer layer has the morphology of Raney metals. The catalysts were first tested for the steam-reforming of methanol and showed high activity together with selectivities close to 100 % towards hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Then, the optimized catalyst was tested during the methanol partial oxidation (POX) and during OSRM. Oxygen was observed to be totally converted via total oxidation and therefore, higher methanol conversion in the OSRM together with CO 2 selectivity of 99 % and H 2 selectivity of 60 % were obtained...|$|R
