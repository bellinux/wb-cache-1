5|$|In a {{retrospective}} review, Jeuxvideo.com had high {{praise for the}} level design, graphics, and animations.

5|$|The {{easiest way}} for the goalkeeper to block shots {{is for them to}} block the <b>ball</b> <b>with</b> either their hands or arms. Longer arms can help the goalkeeper to reach the ball, thus being an advantage. Sports {{involving}} quick reactions may be helpful, as these help the goalkeeper's reflexes which is a crucial skill.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Lawton (6 October 1919– 6 November 1996) was an English {{football}} player and manager. A strong centre-forward with excellent all-round attacking skills, {{he was able}} to head with the <b>ball</b> <b>with</b> tremendous power and accuracy. Despite losing much of his best years to World War II, he scored 260 goals in 433 league and cup competitions in 14 full seasons in the Football League.|$|E

5|$|A carcass was {{a hollow}} {{projectile}} usually formed either by an iron cage of ribs joining two small rings or a cast iron <b>ball</b> <b>with</b> holes. A carcass was {{so named because}} the iron cage was thought to resemble the ribs of a body. A carcass {{was filled with a}} highly flammable mixture. Carcasses were used for the first time by the French under Louis XIV in 1672.|$|E
5|$|A {{creative}} {{player on}} the <b>ball,</b> <b>with</b> excellent vision, technical skills, and an eye for goal, he is a free kick specialist and is capable of playing in several offensive positions. Due to his short stature, dynamic abilities and pace, Giovinco acquired the nickname formica atomica ("atomic ant", after the eponymous Hanna-Barbera character) in his youth. In 2015, he was {{named one of the}} 100 best footballers in the world by The Guardian, FourFourTwo, and L'Équipe.|$|E
5|$|After {{considerable}} {{debate and}} various experiments, {{the law was}} changed again in 1972. In an attempt to reduce pad-play the new version, {{which is used to}} this day, allowed batsmen to be out lbw in some circumstances if they did not attempt to hit the <b>ball</b> <b>with</b> their bat. Since the 1990s, the availability of television replays and, later, ball-tracking technology to assist umpires has increased the percentage of lbws in major matches. However, the accuracy of the technology and the consequences of its use remain controversial.|$|E

5|$|Dung beetles form spherical {{balls of}} animal excrement, which they roll with their bodies, {{generally}} by walking backwards and pushing the <b>ball</b> <b>with</b> their rear legs. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that this rolling behavior evolved independently several times. The behavior of these beetles was noted in ancient Egyptian culture, which imparted sacred significance to their activities. Although {{it is the}} dung ball that rolls rather than the beetle itself, the beetles face {{many of the same}} mechanical difficulties that rolling organisms contend with.|$|E
5|$|Each team {{consists}} of a maximum of eleven players (excluding substitutes), one of whom must be the goalkeeper. Competition rules may state a minimum number of players required to constitute a team, which is usually seven. Goalkeepers are the only players allowed to play the <b>ball</b> <b>with</b> their hands or arms, provided they do so within the penalty area {{in front of their}} own goal. Though {{there are a variety of}} positions in which the outfield (non-goalkeeper) players are strategically placed by a coach, these positions are not defined or required by the Laws.|$|E
5|$|Fender fielded mainly at slip. He possessed quick {{reactions}} and could {{move quickly to}} catch balls hit some distance from him. His technique was unorthodox; he crouched low when waiting for the <b>ball</b> <b>with</b> one leg stretched behind him, like a sprinter ready to begin a race. Good catching was vital in a Surrey side which possessed weak bowling, making his contributions even more important, and critics regarded {{him as one of}} the best slip fielders in England.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: make a {{comparative}} {{analysis of the}} target accuracy of ten-year tennis players in performing test exercises <b>with</b> <b>balls</b> <b>with</b> a pressure of 75 % of the standard and <b>balls</b> <b>with</b> standard pressure. Material & Methods: in the study participated 8 tennis players of ten years of age, the group 5 years of training. In {{the course of the}} research, the following methods were used: analysis and generalization of literature sources, analysis of documentary materials, testing, method of expert evaluations. Results: replacing <b>balls</b> <b>with</b> a pressure of 75 % of the standard for standard leads to a deterioration in the target accuracy of ten-year tennis players, which is a consequence of distortion of the technical characteristics of movements. Conclusion: results of the study indicate the need for correction of the technique of players of this age in the transition from <b>balls</b> <b>with</b> a pressure of 75 % from the standard to standard...|$|R
5|$|Handled {{the ball}} is Law 33 in the laws of cricket {{established}} by the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). A batsman can be given out for handling the ball if, while playing a delivery, the batsman intentionally touches the <b>ball</b> <b>with</b> {{one or both of}} their hands not holding the bat. A decision of not out must be reached if the batsman handles the ball to avoid incurring an injury. A bowler does not receive credit for the wicket when a batsman is dismissed in this fashion.|$|E
5|$|Hassett came to {{the crease}} to join Morris, with the new ball already due. Still using the old ball, Bedser beat Hassett second <b>ball</b> <b>with</b> a {{delivery}} that moved back in, but the appeal for lbw was turned down. However, Yardley opted to not take the ball, and Hassett managed to score a single and get off strike before the English captain called for a replacement ball. O'Reilly said the failure to take the new ball immediately after the appeal was a missed opportunity to maximise the psychological pressure on Hassett.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half, Tech's fortune turned. Late {{in the third}} quarter, the Virginia Tech defense stopped Miami's offense again, but instead of {{receiving}} the punt cleanly, the Hokies committed a roughing the kicker penalty that allowed Miami to retain possession of the <b>ball</b> <b>with</b> a first down. A few plays later, Miami scored its first touchdown of the game. In the fourth quarter Miami finally took the lead on a 10-play, 70-yard drive. The Hokies were unable to answer the Hurricanes' score, and Miami won the 1966 Liberty Bowl, 147.|$|E
