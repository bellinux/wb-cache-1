40|$|International audienceIn {{the area}} of {{building}} construction and management, the dematerial-ization of data and processes has been a global issue for the past 10 years. Go-ing beyond the geometric representation of a building, Building Information Modeling (<b>BIM)</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>approach</b> that aims at integrating into one single system heterogeneous data and processes from different actors. Such integration is a complex and fastidious task. The implementation of the related processes for data querying, retrieval or modification is not less difficult. To tackle this prob-lem, we have developed a novel approach based on Semantic Web technolo-gies. In doing so, we have defined an ontology inspired on IFC standard for rep-resenting building information. On top of this ontology, we have defined and implemented a set of SWRL rules. The paper at hand describes these rules and their application {{in the context of}} building information handling (notably by means of IFC files...|$|E
40|$|Building Information Modelling (<b>BIM)</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>approach</b> to {{improving}} {{the efficiency of the}} building process and potentially providing the key data set needed by facilities managers to operate buildings in a more sustainable manner. Whilst the design/construction phase of BIM is well advanced, the facilities management phase is not. Although attempts to develop similar facilities management models have been tried before, they have failed because of the complexity of data analysis and the inadequacies of the available computing technologies. However, the BIM concept could overcome these problems and provide the basis for a new information model for sustainable building operation and management. This paper will present the initial stages of a three-year project to develop a BIM solution to support the sustainable facilities management of a multiuse commercial building. The paper summarises the theoretical application of BIM to facilities management and presents the results of a small questionnaire survey and stakeholder workshop to ascertain facilities managers understanding of, an attitudes towards, BIM. The paper concludes that, whilst BIM isn't currently widely used by facilities managers, they are aware of its development and its potential applications in facilities management. The paper also concludes that facilities managers generally perceive BIM to be a potential facilitator to their work rather than an inhibitor...|$|E

The approach brings many advantages and has attracted many players in Malaysian Construction industry and has led the industry to develop a roadmap to strategize the implementation. The roadmap is important to coordinate many activities amongst the industry groups working with adopters of BIM in Malaysia. The aim {{of the study is}} to support the development of BIM national roadmap by providing the data of the stakeholders' Interest of BIM implementation at the industrial level. Research methodology used in this research is qualitative in nature by engaging a workshop. The workshop was organised by Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB) Malaysia. In the workshop, six groups of stakeholders were formed to provide data and information regarding to the stakeholders' interest for BIM implementation. The stakeholders were academics, vendor & BIM consultant, facilities management, contractor & quantity surveyor, design consultant and public agency. Result from the workshop shows that the stakeholders interest basically tied to the three main objectives of construction delivery which are the quality, cost and time. Combining all the interests, 47 factors of interests were identified with some of them are overlapped between one stakeholders to another. Based on the occurrence that takes place during the discussion, the most discussed factors are the accuracy of BIM data, reduction of delivery time and improve understanding of the project information...|$|E

40|$|The {{management}} of data, information and knowledge through the {{project life cycle}} of buildings and civil infrastructure projects is becoming increasingly complex. As an attempt to drive efficiencies and address this complexity, the United Kingdom Government has mandated that Building Information Modelling (BIM) methods must be adopted in all public sector construction projects in 2016. Emerging from the US Department of Defence, <b>BIM</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>approach</b> to the co-ordination of design and production data using object-oriented principles as described in ISO 29481 - 1 : 2010. The underlying philosophy of BIM is to ensure the “provision of a single environment to store shared asset data and information, accessible to all individuals who are required to produce, use and maintain it” (PAS 1192 - 2 : 2013). A key aspect of BIM lies {{in the notion of}} ‘interoperability’ between various software applications used in the design and construction process and a common data format for the efficient exchange of design information and knowledge. Protagonists of BIM argue that this interoperability provides an effective environment for collaboration between actors in the construction process and creates accurate, reliable, repeatable and high-quality information exchange. This UK government mandate presents numerous challenges to the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) professions; in particular, the characteristics of BIM Level 2 remain explicitly undefined and this created a degree of uncertainty amongst the promoters and those professionals charged with delivering projects. This research casts a critical lens on the current literature in the domains of object-oriented modelling of infrastructure and the associated implications for procurement and project management. A mixed-methods approach using questionnaire analysis and secondary case study analysis was used to enact an inductive research approach that captures a range of data on the practical issues and considerations associated with the integration of BIM in the industry...|$|E

40|$|Building Information Modeling (<b>BIM)</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{systematic}} process used {{to model}} information involving {{the use of}} computer-generated (n-dimensional) software to simulate the planning, design, construction, and operation of a building. Currently, <b>BIM</b> technology <b>is</b> <b>an</b> important <b>approach</b> used by most project clients (public and private) to boost project effectiveness in terms of time, cost and quality of construction projects to meet client demand. However, previous studies showed that BIM-based project implementation in Malaysia faces greater challenges due to project attributes that causes low demand of project clients to adopt BIM.

BIM has the potential to revolutionize the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry in terms of the positive impact it may have on information flows, working relationships between project participants from different disciplines and the resulting benefits it may achieve through improvements to conventional methods. This chapter reviews the development of BIM, the extent to which <b>BIM</b> has <b>been</b> implemented in Australia, and the factors which have affected the up-take of BIM. More specifically, the objectives of this chapter are to investigate the adoption of BIM in the Australian AEC industry and factors that contribute towards the uptake (or non uptake) of <b>BIM.</b> These objectives <b>are</b> met by <b>a</b> review of the related literature in the first instance, followed by the presentation of the results of a 2007 postal questionnaire survey and telephone interviews of a random sample of professionals in the Australian AEC industry. The responses suggest that less than 25 percent of the sample had <b>been</b> involved in <b>BIM</b> – rather less than might be expected from reading the literature. Also, of those who have <b>been</b> involved with <b>BIM,</b> there has <b>been</b> very little interdisciplinary collaboration. The main barriers impeding the implementation of BIM widely across the Australian AEC industry are also identified.

40|$|The {{world of}} Construction is changing, so too are the {{expectations}} of stakeholders regarding strategies for adapting existing resources (people, equipment and finances), processes and tools to the evolving needs of the industry. Building Information Modelling (<b>BIM)</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> data-rich, digital <b>approach</b> for representing building information required for design and construction. BIM tools {{play a crucial role}} and are instrumental to current approaches, by industry stakeholders, aimed at harnessing the power of a single information repository for improved project delivery and maintenance. Yet, building specifications - which document information on material quality, and workmanship requirements - remain distinctly separate from model information typically represented in BIM models. BIM adoption for building design, construction and maintenance <b>is</b> <b>an</b> industry-wide strategy aimed at addressing such concerns about information fragmentation. However, to effectively reduce inefficiencies due to fragmentation, BIM models require crucial building information contained in specifications. This paper profiles some specification tools which have been used in industry as a means of bridging the BIM-Specifications divide.

40|$|Having {{access to}} {{architectural}} programming information that documents the predesign {{requirements for the}} building throughout the lifecycle of a building can add value to design evaluation, facility management, renovation and extension. Building Information Modeling (<b>BIM)</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> new <b>approach</b> to manage the information that represents {{the characteristics of a}} building throughout its lifecycle. Architectural programming, although a key part of Architecture/Engineering/Construction/Operations (AECO) processes, has not been well integrated into Building Information Modeling (BIM) standards. Although research for many years has established computational data models for <b>a</b> <b>BIM,</b> there <b>is</b> not yet <b>a</b> comprehensive and standard data model to store architectural programming information that <b>is</b> compatible with <b>BIM</b> data modeling standards. This study investigated the possibility for a Universal Format for an Architectural Program Of Requirements (UFPOR) that can connect the architectural programming information to the BIM. Three well-known formats for architectural programming were analyzed to produce data models representing each format. The data models were further analyzed and compared to form a common data model that can bring together all three formats, producing a Universal Format for Architectural Program Of Requirements (UFPOR). The capabilities of UFPOR in representing PORs from the industry was further analyzed by modeling a POR excerpt using UFPOR. In the next phase, the data schema for the industry standard International Foundation Classes (IFC), which represents Building Information Models, was analyzed to explore its capabilities in supporting architectural programming information. Previous attempts to use IFC in documenting architectural programming information were reviewed and analyzed. The findings were compared with UFPOR to evaluate the capabilities of IFC in supporting a universal format for architectural programming. The result <b>was</b> <b>a</b> subset of IFC that can partially represent UFPOR (UFPOR-IFC). The limitations of IFC to fully support UFPOR are also discussed. In the next phase, a computer application prototype (Target) was developed based on the findings of the previous phase to demonstrate how a limited subset of architectural programming requirements can be represented in IFC based on UFPOR-IFC. The output of the application was tested to ensure the IFC physical files produced by the application accurately reflect the data inserted by the application?s user. UFPOR-IFC was tested by modeling two architectural programming documents to assess the external credibility of the findings. The devised system offers a blueprint for creating a link between real-world Architectural Programs and BIM models through IFC physical files. For future work, the findings of the study can be further analyzed by testing the extensibility of the UFPOR-IFC in modeling architectural programming requirements in different subdomains such as lighting, earthquake resilience, and acoustics. Enhancement of IFC to fully support UFPOR could also be investigated and devised.

Despite the considerable value that BIM can add to any project, it has <b>been</b> noted that <b>BIM</b> prevented to <b>be</b> widely implemented {{due to the lack of}} clients’ demand. The lack of BIM understanding and the initial cost of BIM implementation represent the main barriers which clients always hesitate to use BIM. To overcome these difficulties, clients have to understand their roles in the BIM implementation process and also provide the requirements that will enable them to use BIM effectively and realise the desired benefits of BIM. These requirements have been identified as competencies. The lack of using these competencies inside the UK has raised questions about why together with the suitability of using them within the UK. In addition, the lack of presenting these competencies with relation to the benefits increase clients concerns about the feasibility of having these competencies. The aim of this research was therefore set out to support client organisations in the UK to implement BIM effectively by establishing BIM maturity competencies–BIM uses benefits assessment relationship for the UK construction client. The research engaged <b>a</b> multiple-case-studies <b>approach</b> to validate the proposed BIM maturity competencies list and online questionnaire to validate the relationship between BIM maturity competencies and BIM uses benefits.

The conceptual framework was later validated through a focus group workshop to produce the final framework. As the research’s main outcome, the readiness framework consists of four elements. The first readiness element is Process which has three categories residing within it, which are, Process Change Strategy, BIM Implementation Management, and Policy. The second readiness element is Management which includes the categories of Business Strategy, Management Competency, and Leadership. The third element is Technology which also has three categories residing within it, which are Hardware, Technical Support, and Software and the fourth element is People, which has four categories and they are, Roles and Responsibilities, Skill and Attitude, Training and Education and Work Environment. Meanwhile, the 38 readiness criteria that were identified and validated, resided accordingly within each readiness category. The readiness framework as the main outcome of the research can be used to assist the design consultant to identify the readiness gap of the company.
