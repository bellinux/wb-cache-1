25|$|I {{was playing}} good golf, {{but it really}} wasn't {{that big a deal}} to me one way or the other. And then my father died and I sort of {{realized}} that he had certainly lived his life through my golf game. I really hadn't probably given him the best of that. So I sort of got myself back to work. So '70 was an emotional one for me from that standpoint.... It was a <b>big</b> <b>boost.</b>|$|E

Russia played against Canada in {{a repeat of}} the quarter-finals at the 2010 Olympics, in which Canada embarrassed the Russians 7–3.

5000|$|Arguably, the <b>biggest</b> <b>boost</b> to the Moonlite BunnyRanches' {{profile and}} Hof's, was the HBO series Cathouse, which ran from 2002 to 2014.

50|$|The {{formation}} of the Danish Folk Council to actively promote folk music {{both at home and}} abroad has helped raise the profile.

50|$|Nike {{has also}} {{sponsored}} many other successful {{track and field}} athletes over the years, such as Carl Lewis, Jackie Joyner-Kersee and Sebastian Coe.

Detroit subsequently drove to the Green Bay 11, including a 3-yard sneak by Krieg on fourth down and 1. But {{over the next three}} plays, Sanders gained two yards, Krieg threw an incomplete pass, and then he was sacked by linebacker Bryce Paup for a 6-yard loss. On fourth down and 14 from the 17-yard line, Detroit wide receiver Herman Moore caught Krieg's pass {{at the back of the}} end zone, but came out of bounds past the end line, causing a turnover on downs. Afterwards, Green Bay ran out the rest of the clock, giving up an intentional safety when punter Craig Hentrich ran out of the end zone on the last play of the contest.|$|E

50|$|In Judaism, {{the growth}} of Zionism was given its <b>biggest</b> <b>boost</b> by the Holocaust {{which led to the}} {{establishment}} of the State of Israel in 1948.

Slim was like that: the only man I've ever seen who had a force that came out of him... British soldiers don't love their commanders much less worship them; Fourteenth Army trusted Slim and thought of him as one of themselves, and perhaps his real secret was that the feeling was mutual.|$|R
2500|$|Later that year, Remington {{received}} {{a commission to}} do eighty-three illustrations for a book by Theodore Roosevelt, Ranch Life and the Hunting Trail, to be serialized in The Century Magazine before publication. The 29-year-old Roosevelt had a similar Western adventure to Remington, losing money on a ranch in North Dakota the previous year but gaining experience which made him an [...] "expert" [...] on the West. The assignment gave Remington's career a <b>big</b> <b>boost</b> and forged a lifelong connection with Roosevelt.|$|E
2500|$|The {{creation}} of the International Yacht Racing Union and the International Rule in 1907 provided a <b>big</b> <b>boost</b> to yacht building {{in the early part}} of the 20th century, and prior to World War I, the British yachting fleet had grown to around 3,900. [...] The emergence of a group of talented Clyde yacht designers such as William Fife III, George Lennox Watson, Alfred Mylne, James McGruer and David Boyd in the first half of the 20th century firmly established the pre-eminent position of Clyde yachts on the high seas. The River Clyde became, like Cowes and Kiel, a centre for yachting.|$|E

[...] "I thought he meant a school for juvenile delinquents." [...] Eventually her mother agreed and at age twelve she won a full scholarship to the Italia Conti Academy. Despite the encouragement she received from family, friends, and teachers, her <b>big</b> <b>boost</b> of confidence came from a very unlikely source: a clairvoyant who predicted that she would become famous, especially in America. Some of her earliest work included an appearance on The Tommy Steele Show when she was thirteen, and as a model for My Guy magazine.|$|E
2500|$|In 1971, the James G. Blaine Society got a <b>big</b> <b>boost</b> when Governor Tom McCall invited {{tourists}} to visit Oregon, but then added [...] "but for heaven's sake don't stay."

2500|$|In 1985 Dykstra, deemed {{ready for}} the major leagues, was {{promoted}} to the Mets when the team's starting center fielder, Mookie Wilson, {{was placed on the}} disabled list. The rookie's play and energy was a <b>big</b> <b>boost</b> to a Mets team that surged to a 98-win season and narrowly missed out on the NL East crown. The following season, Dykstra was first intended to be platooned in center field with Wilson, but when Mookie suffered a severe eye injury during spring training Dykstra took over the position as outright starter and leadoff hitter. Later that season, the Mets released left fielder George Foster and moved Wilson to left. Mets fans soon nicknamed Dykstra [...] "Nails" [...] for his hard-nosed personality and fearless play. In 1986, he even posed shirtless for a [...] "beefcake" [...] poster under the [...] "Nails" [...] nickname. Dykstra and #2 hitter Wally Backman were termed [...] "the Wild Boys" [...] for their scrappy play as spark plugs for the star-studded Met lineup.|$|E

2500|$|Dion {{organized}} and hosted the First International Conference on Federalism in Mont Tremblant in October 1999 to foster {{international support for}} the cause of federalism in Canada. Quebec sovereigntist leaders were granted a prominent role in the conference and used their floor time to denounce Canadian federalism to an international audience to the great annoyance of their federalist host. But Dion's views got a <b>big</b> <b>boost</b> during the closing speech by United States President Bill Clinton. Clinton appeared to echo the Supreme Court Reference, warning that [...] "when a people thinks it should be independent {{in order to have a}} meaningful political existence, serious questions should be asked.... Are minority rights as well as majority rights respected? How are we going to co-operate with our neighbours?". Clinton argued that federalism allows peoples seeking recognition of their identity a way to do so without isolating themselves in a nation-state. The speech laid to rest any doubts about the U.S. position on the legality and desirability of unilateral secession in Quebec.|$|E

Criterion took the series back to the high-octane formula of cops chasing racers. Unlike actual illegal street racers, Hot Pursuit fans seem happy to see the police."

Richardson said he would stay in the race and he was [...] "so fed up with the parties, both of them".

In this paper, we investigate international demand spillovers brought about by an emerging global middle class and their impact on the international structure of production. We put forth a many-industry and two-country trade model featuring international competition, non-homothetic preferences and country-specific asymmetries in income distribution, productivity and population size. Its key characteristic is the introduction of demand complementarities propagating increasing returns across industries and national boundaries, which eventually translate into a global profit-multiplier.
