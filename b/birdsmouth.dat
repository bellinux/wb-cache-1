50|$|The {{building}} {{has a wide}} surrounding two storeyed timber verandah with a convex curved corrugated iron roof. The brick walls of the building rise above the verandah at the first floor level and are decorated {{with a number of}} raised Greek crosses at the corners, long rendered sign panels and a continuous <b>birdsmouth</b> string course. The cast iron balustrade has been removed and the timber frame has been enclosed with fibre cement sheet. A small section of the cast iron balustrade survives on the southern verandah.|$|E
5000|$|A {{piercing}} saw {{is often}} used with a V-board, {{also known as a}} <b>birdsmouth</b> board, which is a wooden board with a [...] "V" [...] shaped cutout in one end. In use, the V-board is clamped to the bench so that the section with the cutout hangs over the edge. This allows the work to be held down flat whilst shapes are cut into it. Either the work or the saw frame may be rotated. The V-cutout allows the saw blade to pass through the work unimpeded. When eventually worn or damaged, the board is easily replaced.|$|E
50|$|Toenailing or skew-nailing is {{a popular}} {{technique}} that carpenters use regularly to fix two timbers together by slanted application. The fasteners (nails or screws), used in pairs, are driven in on opposing angles. This locks the timbers together, to create a stable framework, e.g. in stud walls (partitions) or roof framing. The angled nailing makes later dismantling difficult or destructive. One {{of the most common}} places to toenail a framing member is where a rafter meets the top plate of a wall at the <b>birdsmouth.</b> Alternatives to toenailing include the use of hurricane ties, joist hangers, and other engineered steel connectors that permit nails to be attached perpendicular to a member's surface.|$|E
5000|$|In light frame construction, a <b>birdsmouth</b> joint or bird's beak cut is a {{woodworking}} joint that {{is generally}} used to connect a roof rafter {{to the top}} plate of a supporting wall. It is an indentation cut into the rafter which consists of a [...] "seat cut" [...] (the face of which rests on the top plate) and a [...] "heel cut" [...] or [...] "plumb cut" [...] (the face of which lies parallel to the supporting wall), forming a shape resembling a bird's mouth. The indentation should not extend unsupported on the interior {{in order to maintain}} the structural integrity of the rafter because the unsupported section can split along the grain of the wood. The joint is generally fastened with nails by toenailing the rafter from the side into the top plate below.|$|E
40|$|Different {{strengthening}} solutions {{with metal}} elements have been experimentally evaluated with tests on full-scale connections. Attention {{has been focused}} on the <b>birdsmouth</b> joints, due to its common use in practice. Even if unstrengthened, these types of connections reveal significant moment resistance. Experimental results show that structural response of <b>birdsmouth</b> connections under cyclic loading cannot be represented by common constraint models, like perfect hinges or rigid joints, but with semi-rigid and friction based models. Thus, the rotational behaviour of the <b>birdsmouth</b> joints is analysed. Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT) - SFRH/BD/ 18515 / 2004, POCI/ECM/ 56552 / 200...|$|E
40|$|Original unstrengthened timber {{connections}} {{and the effects}} of different strengthening techniques have been evaluated experimentally with tests on full-scale <b>birdsmouth</b> joints. Experimental results show that structural response of traditional timber connections under cyclic loading cannot be represented by common constraint models, like perfect hinges or rigid joints, but should be using semi-rigid and friction based models. A research program has investigated the behaviour of old timber joints and examined strengthening criteria. The main parameters affecting the mechanical behaviour of the connection have been singled out. A synthetic model of cyclic behaviour has been adapted on the basis of experimental results...|$|E
40|$|The major task of {{this topic}} is {{evaluation}} of the <b>birdsmouth</b> carpentry joint by various approaches employing finite element method and DIC. The numerical modeling is carried out to predict mechanical performance of the joint and the DIC as reference measurement has been established. There are proposed few achievements in introducing of effective way to give sufficient comparison. (1) The model in several variations is presented whereas gluing and contact analysis in ANSYS is in research scope. (2) The DIC was viably established with the real mechanical measurement in the same time. Although there were found some differences in comparison o FEM with DIC, the results present similarities especially when the contact analysis was carried out...|$|E
40|$|Traditional timber {{construction}} {{was based on}} using plain timber elements and carpentry joints that work by contact pressure and friction, often these joints had only minor reinforcement generically intended to avoid disassembling. In current practice, interventions for the upgrading of carpentry joints are mainly based on empirical knowledge according to tradition, are not specifically conceived for the case of seismic action and often result in overstrengthening. The mechanical behavior of the carpentry joints is examined with emphasis on those most used in roof structures. The main connection type is the <b>birdsmouth</b> joint, connecting rafters to the tie beam; its behavior has been studied numerically and experimentally in monotonic and cyclic conditions. Other forms of connection are discussed as well. Some general criteria for the seismic strengthening of these joints are presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{static and}} dynamic {{behavior}} of timber structures largely {{depends on their}} connections. In traditional timber construction, elements are usually connected with carpentry joints based on contact pressure and friction, often with only minor reinforcement generically intended to avoid disassembling. In current practice, interventions for the upgrading of carpentry joints are mainly based on empirical knowledge according to tradition. Often they produce a general strengthening of the connection, but are not specific for the case of seismic action. Strengthening on heuristic bases may be only partially effective or possibly disproportioned. The behavior of the carpentry joints most used in roof structures is examined. The <b>birdsmouth</b> joint, connecting rafters to the tie beam, has been studied first, characterizing its behavior numerically and experimentally in monotonic and cyclic conditions. Other forms of the rafter-to-tie connection, the double notch joint and the case of parallel rafters, are discussed. Some general criteria for the seismic strengthening of these joints are presented...|$|E
