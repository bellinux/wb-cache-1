5|$|The two-colored bolete is an edible mushroom, {{although}} some {{may have an}} allergic reaction after ingestion that results in stomach upset. The mushroom has a very mild to no taste although {{it is said to}} have a very distinctive taste like that of the king bolete. It can be cooked several ways, and the varying color of the cap can be used to determine if the mushroom is ready to be eaten. If the cap is a lighter red, then it is less mature and is in a stage where it is often larva infested or it can be soft fleshed, in some cases both. The cap should have a dark brick red color when safe to eat. Drying the two-colored bolete is a good method for storage. It is important to note the time it takes for the two-colored bolete to <b>bruise</b> when identifying it for consumption; the mushroom should take several minutes to <b>bruise</b> compared to the instant bruising of Boletus sensibilis, which is poisonous and has many of the same visual characteristics of the two-colored bolete.|$|E

40|$|<b>Bruises</b> in cattle develop {{after the}} {{application}} of force, and they provide evidence for sub-optimal animal welfare. The {{aim of this study}} was to describe the gross characteristics of <b>bruises</b> in cows arriving at the slaughterhouse directly from farms or through the livestock market. The number of <b>bruises</b> and their distribution on the carcass as well as their severity, shape, size and colour were assessed post mortem in a slaughterhouse in Chile. A total of 258 cow carcasses were evaluated, and a total of 846 <b>bruises</b> were found on 243 of the carcasses. Cows that had passed through a livestock market (M-carcasses) had in total 563 <b>bruises</b> (mean 3. 8 bruises/carcass, s. d. 2. 0), whereas cows transported directly from farms (F-carcasses) had in total 283 <b>bruises</b> (mean 2. 5 bruises/carcass, s. d. 1. 8). The backs of F-carcasses had twice as many <b>bruises</b> as M-carcasses (32. 9 % and 16. 2 %, respectively), whereas <b>bruises</b> in the rib area were more frequently observed in M-carcasses (13. 1 %) than in F-carcasses (8. 1 %). Superficial <b>bruises</b> (grade 1) were the most frequently observed (66. 2 % of all <b>bruises).</b> Regarding the size of the <b>bruises,</b> 64 (7. 6 %) were classified as large, 271 (32. 0 %) as medium and 511 (60. 4 %) as small. Irregularly shaped <b>bruises</b> were the most frequent (91. 1 %, n = 771), followed by linear (3. 8 %, n = 32), circular (3. 1 %, n = 26) and tramline-shaped <b>bruises</b> (1. 9 %, n = 16). The latter were noticed only in M-carcasses, which may indicate that these animals were beaten more frequently with sticks or other rod-shaped objects. Fresh, bright red-coloured <b>bruises</b> were found more frequently on all the animals (69. 5 % from farms and 70. 5 % from market) compared with bluish (29. 7 % and 29. 3 %, respectively) and yellow <b>bruises</b> (0. 4 % and 0. 2 %, respectively). The method of selling was significantly associated with the number of <b>bruises</b> on the carcass (P < 0. 001) and the anatomical site (P < 0. 05), but not with the severity, shape and colour of the <b>bruises.</b> Increased fat coverage reduced the severity of <b>bruises</b> (P < 0. 001). This study shows that, in Chile, market animals have more <b>bruises</b> than those sourced directly from farms, and their distribution is different. More information about the causes of infliction may help reduce <b>bruises</b> and it may also improve their welfare. Further studies are required to elucidate whether the causes of the high <b>bruising</b> in the case of animals passing through markets are related only to extra handling (repeated loading, unloading, transportation, eventual mixing) or to the way of handling by personnel and inadequate desig...|$|R

5|$|The {{psilocybin}} {{contents of}} dried herbarium specimens of Psilocybe semilanceata {{in one study}} were shown to decrease with the increasing age of the sample: collections dated 11, 33, or 118 years old contained 0.84%, 0.67%, and 0.014% (all dry weight), respectively. Mature mycelia contain some psilocybin, while young mycelia (recently germinated from spores) lack appreciable amounts. Many species of mushrooms containing psilocybin also contain lesser amounts of the analog compounds baeocystin and norbaeocystin, chemicals thought to be biogenic precursors. Although most species of psilocybin-containing mushrooms <b>bruise</b> blue when handled or damaged due to the oxidization of phenolic compounds, this reaction is not a definitive method of identification or determining a mushroom's potency.|$|E

40|$|Background: Dogma {{has long}} prevailed {{regarding}} the ageing of <b>bruises,</b> and whether certain patterns of <b>bruising</b> are suggestive or diagnostic of child abuse. Objectives: We conducted the first Systematic Reviews addressing these two issues, {{to determine the}} scientific basis for current clinical practice. There have been seven updates since 2004. Methods: An all language literature search was performed across 13 databases, 1951 – 2004, using > 60 key words, supplemented by ‘snowballing’ techniques. Quality standards included a novel confirmation of abuse scale. Updates used expanded key words, and a higher standard for confirmation of abuse. Results: Of 1495 potential studies, only three met the inclusion criteria for ageing of <b>bruises</b> in 2004, confirming that it is inaccurate to do so with the naked eye. This was roundly rejected when first reported, generating a wave of new studies attempting to determine a scientifically valid method to age <b>bruises,</b> none of which are applicable in children yet. Regarding patterns of <b>bruising</b> that may be suggestive or diagnostic of abuse, we included 23 of 167 studies reviewed in 2004, although only 2 were comparative studies. Included studies noted that unintentional <b>bruises</b> occur predominantly {{on the front of}} the body, over bony prominences and their presence is directly correlated to the child's level of independent mobility. <b>Bruising</b> patterns in abused children, differed in location (most common site being face, neck, ear, head, trunk, buttocks, arms), and tended to be larger. Updates have included a further 14 studies, including <b>bruising</b> in disabled children, defining distinguishing patterns in severely injured abused and non-abused children, and importance of petechiae. Conclusions: Systematic Reviews of <b>bruising</b> challenged accepted wisdom regarding ageing of <b>bruises,</b> which had no scientific basis; stimulated higher quality research on patterns of <b>bruises</b> distinguishing abusive and non-abusive <b>bruising</b> patterns, and highlighted the benefits of regular updates of these reviews...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Most agronomic plant traits {{result from}} complex {{molecular}} networks involving multiple genes and from environmental factors. One such trait is the enzymatic discoloration {{of fruit and}} tuber tissues initiated by mechanical impact (<b>bruising).</b> Tuber susceptibility to <b>bruising</b> is a complex trait of the cultivated potato (Solanum tuberosum) that is crucial for crop quality. As phenotypic evaluation of <b>bruising</b> is cumbersome, the application of diagnostic molecular markers would empower the selection of low <b>bruising</b> potato varieties. The genetic factors and molecular networks underlying enzymatic tissue discoloration are sparsely known. Hitherto there is no association study dealing with tuber <b>bruising</b> and diagnostic markers for enzymatic discoloration are rare. Results The natural genetic diversity for <b>bruising</b> susceptibility was evaluated in elite middle European potato germplasm in order to elucidate its molecular basis. Association genetics using a candidate gene approach identified allelic variants in genes that function in tuber <b>bruising</b> and enzymatic browning. Two hundred and five tetraploid potato varieties and breeding clones related by descent were evaluated {{for two years in}} six environments for tuber <b>bruising</b> susceptibility, specific gravity, yield, shape and plant maturity. Correlations were found between different traits. In total 362 polymorphic DNA fragments, derived from 33 candidate genes and 29 SSR loci, were scored in the population and tested for association with the traits using a mixed model approach, which takes into account population structure and kinship. Twenty one highly significant (p Conclusions The observed trait correlations and associated marker fragments provide new insight in the molecular basis of <b>bruising</b> susceptibility and its natural variation. The markers diagnostic for increased or decreased <b>bruising</b> susceptibility will facilitate the combination of superior alleles in breeding programs. In addition, this study presents novel candidates that might control enzymatic tissue discoloration and tuber <b>bruising.</b> Their validation and characterization will increase the knowledge about the underlying biological processes. </p...|$|R
