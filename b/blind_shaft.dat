5|$|Among {{the first}} major neo-noir films—the term often applied to films that {{consciously}} refer back to the classic noir tradition—was the French Tirez sur le pianiste (1960), directed by François Truffaut from a novel {{by one of the}} gloomiest of American noir fiction writers, David Goodis. Noir crime films and melodramas have been produced in many countries in the post-classic area. Some of these are quintessentially self-aware neo-noirs—for example, Il Conformista (1969; Italy), Der Amerikanische Freund (1977; Germany), The Element of Crime (1984; Denmark), As Tears Go By (1988; Hong Kong), and El Aura (2005; Argentina). Others simply share narrative elements and a version of the hardboiled sensibility associated with classic noir, such as The Castle of Sand (1974; Japan), Insomnia (1997; Norway), Croupier (1998; UK), <b>Blind</b> <b>Shaft</b> (2003; China), and The Square (2008; Australia).|$|E

50|$|The packing (gangue {{material}} {{used for}} filling) {{from the upper}} main gangways {{was placed in the}} exhausted cavities (the so-called 'old man' or Alter Mann). This required the erection of a wooden ceiling over the active workings so that packing material did not fall into it and onto the face workers there. If the expected supply of ore or its quality did not justify sinking the main shaft deeper, or if the workings were a long way from it, draw-shafts were sunk. These <b>blind</b> <b>shafts</b> saved having to pack the 'old man'. In the Hornstatt, 1 or 2 labourers (Knechte) worked a hand winch and lifted the ore to the next highest main gallery.|$|R

50|$|From 1720 the Maaßen Hoisting Shaft (Maaßener Treibschacht) and Maaßen Water Shaft (Maaßener Kunstschacht) of the Lautenthals Glück Pit {{were used}} to hoist ore and surplus water to the surface. At that time, both shafts were {{so-called}} winzes and did not open at the surface. From 1718, the hoisting shaft had a winding engine. From 1842 to 1844 the hoisting shaft was driven to the surface. In the subsequent period, the headframe and other above-ground facilities were added. The reversible water wheel lay 29 metres down the shaft and around 70 metres to the north. It was powered by water from the Oberer Richtschachter Graben. The old water wheel of the <b>blind</b> hosting <b>shaft</b> was another 40 metres deeper in an underground wheel room. In the Maaßen Water Shaft there was a double man engine for enabling miners to journey {{to and from the}} Lautenthals Glück Pit. These and the pumping need for water management were driven by four underground water wheels, which received their water through the Maaßen Watercourse (Maaßener Wasserlauf) which is still visible today.|$|R

5000|$|Mining in Schneeberg {{continued}} until 1954 reusing many shafts from previous silver and cobalt mining. Up to that time, about 200 tonnes of uranium was extracted from Schneeberg. Oberschlema was mined to depths of over 700 m. Mining ceased in 1960 after producing more than 7,000 tonnes of uranium. A high density of veins {{near the surface}} and the 'wild' mining methods of the 1940s and 1950s caused the complete destruction of Oberschlema. Most houses were so badly damaged and the subsurface so unstable that the entire small town was removed in the 1950s. Today the former mining area hosts a radon health center reestablished in the 1990s. After a restructure of the company in the 1960s, Object 09 became Bergbaubetrieb Aue (mining division Aue). It developed into the single largest producer of uranium within SAG/SDAG Wismut with a peak production of 4,000 tonnes of uranium in 1965. In the last normal production year, 1989, it produced about 550 tonnes. This deposit {{was the first of}} all Wismut deposits to be supplied with large modern mining shafts and powerful ventilation in the mid-1950s [...] The most important shafts where Shaft 38 (Niederschlema), Shaft 366 (Aue-Alberoda) and Shaft 371 (Hartenstein). The latter went into production in 1959 and was the main shaft of the deposit up to the end of production in 1990. Shaft 371 possessed an automated sorting plant used to separate different classes of ore and to increase the overall ore grade. High grade ore was sent directly to the Soviet Union without further processing, while ore containing less than 1% uranium was shipped to the mill at Crossen near Zwickau. This was done until 1980; afterwards all ore was milled, with the sorting plant raising the average ore grade to 0.4% before it was sent to Crossen for processing. An unsuccessful attempt was also made to produce base metals, silver and selenium as by-products. Shaft 371 was connected to the -540 and -990 m level (the depth is related to the Markus Semmler adit dewatering {{the upper part of the}} deposit into the Zwickauer Mulde river). Deeper levels were connected by <b>blind</b> <b>shafts.</b> The deepest level opened in 1988 was the -1800 m level, nearly 2,000 m underground, making the mine the deepest in Europe. The mining method used was the same as in the centuries before, although with more modern equipment: galleries were driven along strike of the mineralised vein on a lower and upper level (vertical distance 30 to 45 m). These were connected by small shafts from the lower to the upper level. Then the vein was mined upward using drilling and blasting. The ore was transported to the lower level and brought to the main shafts by rail cars, while the stope was filled with waste rock, as possible. After a vein was mined out, the entrances were sealed to prevent radon from the old stopes from entering areas with active mining. This method was used in all vein type deposits of the Ore Mountains. The total production from Niederschlema-Alberoda was over 72,000 tonnes of uranium. Together with the production from Schneeberg and Oberschlema, production losses and unmined resources, the total uranium content was about 96,000 tonnes of uranium, making Schneeberg-Schlema-Alberoda the largest vein-style uranium deposit in the world.|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} industry generally takes a conservative attitude towards adopting innovations. Previous research {{has tended to}} focus on information technology instead of heavy construction equipment. Also, the ‘process’ of adopting of new construction technologies by companies remains unexplored until now. In the previous part of the research the initial stages of technology adoption were examined including identification of the range of options available and comparison of the options in order to determine and collect any information that is missing for any of the options. With this in mind, this paper presents the initial investigation into the next part (phase) of the technology adoption process, which is found to involve analysis of the most viable options, involving a demonstration of the technology on the user’s site and / or discussion with other technology users, and the making of the final decision. A total of 35 interviews with participants from Australia and 63 from North America were undertaken. Participants {{from both sides of the}} process (i. e. customers and vendors) were chosen in order to cross-validate the findings of each group using triangulation. A total of 96 technologies were identified ranging in cost from $ 0. 75 M to $ 45 M, including mobile / tower cranes, concrete pumps, and <b>blind</b> bore <b>shaft</b> drills. The analysis revealed that a customer passes through three stages to make the adoption decision from the point where the customer is in the position to short list the number of technology options and vendors. The outcome confirmed the original hypothesis that the adoption process has well-defined stages starting with: a) Information analysis; b) technology evaluation; and c) adoption decision. These three stages are mirrored by vendor activities which respond to potential adopters. The analysis also highlighted the importance of word of mouth, feedback from experienced technology users, and negotiation in the process...|$|R

The room was the last space in the building to be carved, with sculptural work only beginning in the late 1950s and continuing intermittently for the following two decades; approximately 225 blocks of varying sizes still remain uncarved. Amongst the work done are three series of stone works: The British North America Act, a set of 12 high reliefs on the east and west walls of the chamber, carved between 1978 and 1985, and illustrating through symbols and narrative themes associated with the federal and provincial responsibilities laid out in the British North America Act; Evolution of Life, a series of 14 sculptures within the spandrels of the pier-arches at the north and south ends of the House of Commons, depicting Canada's palaeontological past and the evolution of humanity through philosophy, science, and the imagination; and Speakers and Clerks, comprising four heads carved on the jambs of the two doors {{on either side of the}} Speaker's chair, depicting the speakers and clerks of the House of Commons at the time of the opening of both parliament buildings in 1867 and 1920, respectively.|$|R

40|$|Now forging parts {{papermaking}} machines uses {{many different}} designs presses. Regardless {{of the type}} of construction, the water is filtered through paper to canvas cloth in the transverse direction, filtering water from the cloth can occur in the longitudinal direction (simple presses) or in the transverse direction (<b>shaft</b> with <b>blind</b> holes, grooved <b>shaft,</b> suction shaft). Presses of the native papermaking machines provide a dry cloth when pressed, about 35 ? 40 %. That is not enough, as for drying the paper spent a huge amount of thermal energy in the form of steam, so the development of the press, providing a significant increase in dry is relevant. One way of increasing dryness is usage of shoe press, which by increasing the length of the contact area increased while pressing, so dry cloth before drying section increasing to 50 ? 55 %. Work of presses of papermaking machine is measured by the amount of water removed, and uniform moisture content across the width of fabric after the presses. Dehydration capacity of presses depends primarily on the length of the extrusion zone delighted shaft and on the number of these zones. When pressing simultaneously with dehydration of the paper web changing its structure, increases the contact area between the fibers and the coupling strength between them. In the existing literature does not sufficiently covered shoe-type presses calculation that does not allow constructing them because kinetic regularities of the process is unknown. The {{purpose of this article is}} to establish the kinetics of the compaction and main parameters shoe-type press needed to develop methods of calculation and design shoe presses.
