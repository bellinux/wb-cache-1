The CVRJ system accomplishes its primary mission by jamming each threat's transmitted RF signals. The secondary purpose of the CVRJ system is to add the capability to combine multiple internal RF signals and external RF inputs from other systems, and serve as the conduit for transmitting those RF signals while maintaining system interoperability. It accomplishes both missions via 15 waveform programmable RF channels. The system is software controlled to meet specific threats. Indicators on the CVRJ front panel and Remote Control Unit (RCU) allow the operator to observe system health and diagnostic messages. <b>Built-In-Test</b> (BIT) routines run during system initialization and operation that notify the operator of system faults by illuminating indicators referred to as “annunciators” and by displaying text messages on the RCU display.

High performance yet Low Power and EMI have made LVDS a popular choice for high-speed card-to-card serial links. A typical application is the serializer/deserializer (ser/des) function where wide TTL datastreams including clock is converted to a serial LVDS bit stream, sent over a cable, and deserialization and clock recovery performed on the receiving card. This is a powerful design technique but presents interesting challenges from a testability perspective. First, LVDS links have a much different fault spectrum than the well-established stuck-at models used for TTL logic levels. The LVDS interconnect is a transmission line model, where the signal carrying integrity of the cable, fault models and fault detection are very frequency dependent.

40|$|A patent {{disclosure}} document discusses a photonic {{method for}} connecting a spacecraft with a launch vehicle upper-stage telemetry {{system as a}} means for monitoring a spacecraft fs health and status during and right after separation and deployment. This method also provides an efficient opto-coupled capability for prelaunch <b>built-in-test</b> (BIT) on the ground to enable more efficient and timely integration, preflight checkout, and a means to obviate any local EMI (electromagnetic interference) during integration and test. Additional utility can be envisioned for BIT on other platforms, such as the International Space Station (ISS). The photonic telemetry system implements an optical free-space link with a divergent laser transmitter beam spoiled over a significant cone angle to accommodate changes in spacecraft position without having to angle track it during deployment. Since the spacecraft may lose attitude control and tumble during deployment, the transmitted laser beam interrogates any one of several low-profile meso-scale retro-reflective spatial light modulators (SLMs) deployed over the surface of the spacecraft. The return signal beam, modulated by the SLMs, contains health, status, and attitude information received back at the launch vehicle. Very compact low-power opto-coupler technology already exists for the received signal (requiring relatively low bandwidths, e. g.,. 200 kbps) to enable transfer to a forward pass RF relay from the launch vehicle to TDRSS (Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System) or another recipient.

The Self Repairing Flight Control System (SRFCS) flight development program directly addresses this issue with a flight control system design that measures the damage and immediately refines the control system commands to preserve mission potential. The system diagnostics process detects in flight the type of faults {{that are difficult to}} isolate post flight, and thus cause excessive ground maintenance time and cost. The control systems of fighter aircraft have the control power and surface displacement to maneuver the aircraft in a very large flight envelope with a wide variation in airspeed and g maneuvering conditions, with surplus force capacity available from each control surface. Digital flight control processors are designed to include built-in status of the control system components, as well as sensor information on aircraft control maneuver commands and response. In the event of failure or loss of a control surface, the SRFCS utilizes this capability to reconfigure control commands to the remaining control surfaces, thus preserving maneuvering response. Correct post-flight repair is the key to low maintainability support costs and high aircraft mission readiness. The SRFCS utilizes the large data base available with digital flight control systems to diagnose faults. <b>Built-in-test</b> data and sensor data are used as inputs to an Onboard Expert System process to accurately identify failed components for post-flight maintenance action.

40|$|Testing is an {{integral}} part of modern semiconductor industry. The necessity of test is evident, especially for low-yielding processes, to ensure Quality of Service (QoS) to the customers. Testing is a major contributing factor to the total manufacturing cost of analog/RF systems, with test cost estimated to be up to 40 % of the overall cost. Due to the lack of low-cost, high-speed testers and other test instrumentation that can be used in a production line, low-cost testing of high-frequency devices/systems is a tremendous challenge to semiconductor test community. Also, simulation times being very high for such systems, the only possible way to generate reliable tests for RF systems is by performing direct measurements on hardware. At the same time, inserting test points for such circuits while maintaining signal integrity is a difficult task to achieve. The proposed research develops a test strategy to reduce overall test cost for RF circuits. A <b>built-in-test</b> (BIT) approach using sensors is proposed for this purpose, which are designed into high-frequency circuits. The work develops algorithms for selecting optimal test access points, and the stimulus for testing the DUT. The test stimulus can be generated on-chip, through efficient design reuse or using custom built circuits. The test responses are captured and analyzed by on-chip sensors, which are custom designed to extract test response features. The sensors, which have low silicon area overhead, output either DC or low frequency test response signals and are compatible to low-speed testers; hence are low-cost. The specifications of the system are computed using a set of nonlinear models developed using the alternate test methodology. The whole approach has been applied to a RF receiver at 1 GHz, used as a test vehicle to prove the feasibility of the proposed approach. Finally, the method is verified through measurements made on a large number of devices, similar to an industrial production test situation. The proposed method using sensors estimated system-level as well as device-level specifications very accurately in the emulated production test environment with a significantly smaller test cost than existing production tests.

40|$|A radiation-hard {{transponder}} {{was developed}} utilizing submicron/nanotechnology from IBM. The device consumes low power {{and has a}} low fabrication cost. This device utilizes a Plug-and-Play concept, and can be integrated into intra-satellite networks, supporting SpaceWire and Gigabit Ethernet I/O. A space-qualified, 100 -pin package also was developed, allowing space-qualified (class K) transponders to be delivered within a six-month time frame. The novel, optical, radiation-tolerant transponder was implemented as a standalone board, containing the transponder ASIC (application specific integrated circuit) and optical module, with an FPGA (field-programmable gate array) friendly parallel interface. It features improved radiation tolerance; high-data-rate, low-power consumption; and advanced functionality. The transponder utilizes a patented current mode logic library of radiation-hardened-by-architecture cells. The transponder was developed, fabricated, and radhard tested up to 1 MRad. It was fabricated using 90 -nm CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) 9 SF process from IBM, and incorporates full BIT circuitry, allowing a loop back test. The low-speed parallel LVCMOS (lowvoltage complementary metal oxide semiconductor) bus is compatible with Actel FPGA. The output LVDS (low-voltage differential signaling) interface operates up to 1. 5 Gb/s. Built-in CDR (clock-data recovery) circuitry provides robust synchronization and incorporates two alarm signals such as synch loss and signal loss. The ultra-linear peak detector scheme allows on-line control of the amplitude of the input signal. Power consumption is less than 300 mW. The developed transponder with a 1. 25 Gb/s serial data rate incorporates a 10 -to- 1 serializer with an internal clock multiplication unit and a 10 - 1 deserializer with internal clock and data recovery block, which can operate with 8 B 10 B encoded signals. Three loop-back test modes are provided to facilitate the <b>built-in-test</b> functionality. The design {{is based on a}} proprietary library of differential current switching logic cells implemented in the standard 90 -nm CMOS 9 SF technology from IBM. The proprietary low-power LVDS physical interface is fully compatible with the SpaceWire standard, and can be directly connected to the SFP MSA (small form factor pluggable Multiple Source Agreement) optical transponder. The low-speed parallel interfaces are fully compatible with the standard 1. 8 V CMOS input/output devices. The utilized proprietary annular CMOS layout structures provide TID tolerance above 1. 2 MRad. The complete chip consumes less than 150 mW of power from a single 1. 8 -V positive supply source...|$|E
