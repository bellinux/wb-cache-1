The International {{was part}} of a triple header which also {{included}} the Melanesian Cup, between Papua New Guinea and Fiji, and the Junior Kangaroos against the Junior Kiwis. The traditional pacific rivalry between these two continued as they produced highlights from <b>big</b> <b>hits,</b> to powerful meters, and try-saving tackles when needed. However this year's test-match saw way more errors than last year's and Tonga made most of them and failed to capitalize on their 55% of possession, which therefore resulted in a 12-point defeat in the 2016 Polynesian Cup.|$|E
25|$|After Mal Loye's boundary-filled 73, {{off just}} 32 balls, Derbyshire Phantoms were {{probably}} happy that they escaped with conceding 189 runs in their game with Lancashire Lightning at Old Trafford. Lancashire tried to employ pinch hitters such as Dominic Cork and Glen Chapple {{to get the}} runs flowing quickly, but they disappointed slightly, hitting at just over a run a ball. Derbyshire's chase looked possible despite Gary Keedy taking the wickets of Michael Di Venuto and Jonathan Moss, two danger men, early on - as they were 121 for 3 - but Keedy dug out another wicket, and that spurred a collapse to 139 for 8, part-time off-spinner Andrew Crook joining in with two for 35. Derbyshire needed some <b>big</b> <b>hits</b> from the specialist bowlers in the end, and crumbled to 172 with three balls remaining, James Anderson getting the honour of taking the last wicket.|$|E
25|$|The World War I desert drama The Lost Patrol (1934), {{based on}} the book Patrol by Philip MacDonald, was a {{superior}} remake of the 1929 silent film Lost Patrol.

It was one of Ford's first <b>big</b> <b>hits</b> of the sound era—it was rated by both the National Board of Review and The New York Times as one of the Top 10 films of that year and won an Oscar nomination for its stirring Max Steiner score. It was followed later that year by The World Moves On with Madeleine Carroll and Franchot Tone, and the highly successful Judge Priest, his second film with Will Rogers, which became one of the top-grossing films of the year.|$|E

25|$|Partly due to Mal Loye's boundary-filled 73, {{off just}} 32 balls, Derbyshire Phantoms conceded 189 runs in their game with Lancashire Lightning at Old Trafford. After Loye was dismissed, Lancashire tried to employ pinch hitters such as Dominic Cork and Glen Chapple {{to get the}} runs flowing quickly, who hit at just over a run a ball – but still below the average run rate for the innings. Derbyshire made it to 121 for 3 despite Gary Keedy taking the wickets of Michael di Venuto and Jonathan Moss early on, but Keedy dug out another wicket, and that set the doors in the Old Trafford {{pavilion}} in motion. Derbyshire lost five wickets for 18 runs, part-time off-spinner Andrew Crook joining in with Keedy to grab two for 35. Derbyshire needed some <b>big</b> <b>hits</b> from the specialist bowlers in the end, and despite four boundaries and 25 from Tim Lungley they were bowled out for 172 with three balls remaining, James Anderson getting the honour of taking the last wicket.|$|E
25|$|Dev chose Guru Dutt as {{director}} for the crime thriller, Baazi (1951). The film, starring Dev Anand, Geeta Bali and Kalpana Kartik was a trendsetter, regarded as the forerunner of the spate of urban crime films that followed in Bollywood in the 1950s. The film Baazi saw the debut of Kalpana Kartik (aka Mona Singha) as the lead female actress and Guru Dutt as a director. The collaboration was a success {{at the box office}} and the duo of Dev Anand and Kalpana Kartik were offered many films to star in together. They signed all the film offers and subsequently the movies Aandhiyan (1952), Taxi Driver (1954), House No. 44 (1955) and Nau Do Gyarah (1957) went on to become <b>big</b> <b>hits</b> too. During the making of the film Taxi Driver, the couple fell in love and Dev proposed marriage to his heroine Kalpana. In 1954, Taxi Driver was declared a hit and the two decided to marry in a quiet ceremony. The couple had a son, Suneil Anand in 1956 and later a daughter, Devina, was born. After her marriage, Kalpana decided not to pursue her acting career further. Nau Do Gyarah was the couple's last movie together.|$|E
