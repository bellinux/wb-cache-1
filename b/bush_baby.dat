40|$|This {{paper is}} one of a series {{produced}} as part of an evaluation of a number of digital interactive television (DiTV) health pilots funded by the Department of Health during 2001 / 2002. This paper is concerned with two pregnancy health services produced by Channel Health and hosted on Sky television. The study aimed to discover the success or otherwise of health information on pregnancy in this form and on this medium or ‘platform’. In particular we were interested in what kinds of people on the broader national stage viewed the <b>Bush</b> <b>Babies</b> programme. Data were obtained through a telephone questionnaire of Channel Health users. More than 250 people took part. More than 175 000 households watched the programmes, a large audience for this type of programme. <b>Bush</b> <b>Babies</b> attracted a sizeable audience with over a quarter of Channel Health viewers in this study having seen it. There proved to be marked differences between the types of people using the service and in the patterns of their use – and not always in the ways one might have expected. As expected, people who were single, older or male were less likely to view <b>Bush</b> <b>Babies,</b> while younger, married or cohabitants and females were more likely to watch the programme. More unexpectedly, perhaps, the fact that the person was pregnant was not a predictor of whether they saw a <b>Bush</b> <b>Babies</b> programme or the number of the programmes watched...|$|R

After a few days, the mother carries the infant in her mouth, and leaves it on convenient branches while feeding.|$|R

The pure secretion was subjected to GC-MS analysis which revealed three major components.

Analysis of a male and a female secretion indicated that some sexual dimorphism in the relative concentrations of these components may exist. © 1979 Plenum Publishing Corporation. Articl...|$|R

50|$|Pollination in the baobab is {{achieved}} primarily by fruit bats, but <b>bush</b> <b>babies</b> and {{several kinds of}} insect also assist. Some aspects of the baobab's reproductive biology are not yet understood. It is still speculated whether fertile baobab seeds can result from pollination by the tree's own pollen. It would appear as if pollen from another tree is required for fertile seed, as isolated trees do form seed, only to abort them at a late stage. The existence of some very isolated trees, may then be due to their self-incompatibility and inability to reproduce.|$|R
500|$|Lemurs ( [...] ) are a clade of strepsirrhine {{primates}} {{endemic to}} the island of Madagascar. The word lemur derives from the word lemures (ghosts or spirits) from Roman mythology and was first used to describe a slender loris due to its nocturnal habits and slow pace, but was later applied to the primates on Madagascar. As with other strepsirrhine primates, such as lorises, pottos, and galagos (<b>bush</b> <b>babies),</b> lemurs share resemblance with basal primates. In this regard, lemurs are often confused with ancestral primates, when in actuality, lemurs did not give rise to monkeys and apes, but evolved independently.|$|R

50|$|This {{phenomenon}} {{has been observed}} in numerous vertebrate behaviors, {{one of the most}} notable being jumping. Observed in kangaroos, <b>bush</b> <b>babies,</b> birds, frogs, and various species of antelope, jumping relies on this system because the action is inherently limited in the time that is available to produce power once the body has begun to accelerate. Once the body loses contact with the ground there is no way for the organism to continue to produce force. Substantial improvement in acceleration resulting from these mechanisms have been observed in jumping fleas, accelerating turkeys, the striking of mantis shrimp, and the running of horses who’s bicep brachii power output is amplified fifty times by the use of catapult-like behavior of the tendon.|$|R
