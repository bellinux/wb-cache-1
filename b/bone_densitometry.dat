40|$|Objective: To {{verify the}} {{behavior}} of the mineral bone content and density in male adolescents according to age and secondary sexual characters. Methods: 47 healthy adolescents between 10 and 19 years old were assessed according to weight, height, body mass index, puberty stage, calcium intake, bone mineral density and content in the lumbar spine and in the proximal femur. The bone mass was measured through <b>bone</b> <b>densitometries.</b> The intake of calcium was calculated through a 3 -day diet. The BMI (body mass index) was calculated with the Quetelet Index and the puberty stage was defined according to Tanners criteria. The analysis used descriptive statistics such as average and standard deviation, and variance estimates to compare the different age groups. Moreover, the Tukey test was used to determine the significant differences. Results: It was evident that the calcium intake in the different ages assessed has not reached the minimum value of 800 mg. The bone mineral density and content showed an increase after the age of 14, as well as when the teenagers reached the sexual maturation stage G 4. The mineralization parameters showed a high level when the teenagers were in the G 3 stage, however, without statistical significance. Conclusion: The results indicate an important level of bone mineralization during adolescence. Maturation level...|$|R

40|$|Objectives : Osteoporosis is a {{systemic}} skeletal disease with a consequent {{increased risk of}} fracture, decreased {{quality of life and}} economic burdens for both the patients and health care system. While Dual energy X-Ray absorptiometry remains the gold standard for assessment of bone mineral density, it cannot be requested for all patients for obvious reasons. By determining other variables that may correlate with osteoporosis, we can identify individuals who may be at risk for osteoporosis earlier. Then, they can be treated at the earlier stages of the disease. In the present study, relationships between bone mineral density, maturity index in cervical smear, serum estradiol level and body mass index were examined. Materials & Methods : The present study performed on 128 women, who had been referred for <b>bone</b> mineral <b>densitometry.</b> Blood samples were obtained for determination of serum estradiol level. Cervical smear was taken for assessment of cell’s maturity. Cervical smears were examined by a pathologist and were sorted as atrophic or mature. Body mass index was calculated too.

Results: Maturity index had significant relationship with T Score in the spine and femoral neck (P Conclusion : Pap smear is a routine examination which is performed mainly for screening purposes in gynecology.

40|$|Background: Osteoporosis (OP) is a {{metabolic}} bone {{illness that}} may complicate celiac disease (CD). It {{can lead to}} devastating consequences because of low bone mass and fragility fractures. Purpose: To study the OP prevalence {{in a group of}} Brazilian patients with CD and the value of a gluten free diet (GFD). Methods: Retrospective study of celiac female patients from a single University Center followed with <b>bone</b> <b>densitometries.</b> Results from densitometry made at first visit were compared with a second study after a median time of 5 years. During this period, patients were submitted to a GFD according to orientations from special program training. Calcium and vitamin D were prescribed to those patients who did not reach the minimal daily requirement through diet. Results: Forty-one celiac female patients, mean age 46. 1 ± 14. 8 years, were included. The prevalence of osteopenia at first visit was 56. 1 % and that of osteoporosis 29. 2 %. Osteoporosis was associated with longer disease duration (p = 0. 01). The second densitometry was performed in a median time of 5 years (range 1 to 13 years) and disclosed 58. 9 % osteopenia and 28. 2 % osteoporosis. The GFD improved bone mass, mainly at (of) spine (comparison of T score with p = 0. 03 and of bone mass in g/cm² with p = 0. 02), but it was not sufficient {{to reduce the number of}} osteopenic (p = 0. 9) and osteoporotic patients (p = 0. 4). During the follow up period 25 % of osteoporotic patients developed low impact fractures.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveWe {{report an}} 18 -year-old patient with {{bilateral}} ovarian agenesis, rudimentary uterus and normal fallopian tubes, and with normal 46,XX karyotype (without mosaicism).

With the help of vaginoscopy, vaginal depth was measured without distorting the hymenal ring and {{was found to be}} 8 cm. The laboratory findings were as follows: follicle-stimulating hormone 85 IU/L, luteinizing hormone 40 IU/L, and estradiol 14 pg/dL. Genetic investigation revealed a 46,XX karyotype without any mosaicism. Diagnostic laparoscopy was performed.

40|$|Introduction. Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) {{is a major}} cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Proper diagnosis of osteoporosis as a systemic adverse effect of COPD is of significant importance. The present study aimed at evaluating the prevalence of osteoporosis and its risk factors in men suffering from COPD in Qazvin (2014). Methods. This descriptive-analytical study was conducted on 90 patients with COPD using random sampling. Anthropometric data and results from physical examination were collected. Pulmonary function test and <b>bone</b> mineral <b>densitometry</b> were done for all participants as well. Results. The prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis in COPD patients was 31. 5 and 52. 8 percent, respectively. Bone mineral density (BMD) at the femoral neck was associated significantly with body mass index (BMI), increased severity of COPD, and use of oral corticosteroid (P< 0. 05). Conclusion.

40|$|<b>Bone</b> mineral <b>densitometry</b> (BMD) {{is useful}} in {{predicting}} fracture risk, but, unfortunately, {{there is a significant}} degree of overlap in BMD measurements of patients who have a high risk of fracture and patients with a low risk of fracture. In this study, a method of characterizing trabecular bone structure in digitized radiographs of vertebrae is proposed and assessed. A significant correlation between bone "structure" and the compressive strength of vertebral bodies was found. The utility of the parameter for distinguishing between "weak" and "strong" bone samples was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Using this analysis, the structural parameter produced an area under the ROC of 0. 88 +/- 0. 05, while a bone density measure produced an area of 0. 79 +/- 0. 07. The results suggest that the addition of a measure of bone structure to the conventional measures of bone density may prove useful in predicting the quality of bone when considering surgical or medical intervention for osteoporotic conditions...|$|R
