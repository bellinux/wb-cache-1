25|$|Together, these {{definitions}} are broad {{enough to}} encompass physical engineering models {{used in the}} verification of a system design, as well as schematic models like a functional flow <b>block</b> <b>diagram</b> and mathematical (i.e., quantitative) models used in the trade study process. This section focuses on the last.|$|E
25|$|Extensive use {{is usually}} {{made of a}} {{diagrammatic}} style known as the <b>block</b> <b>diagram.</b> In it the transfer function, {{also known as the}} system function or network function, is a mathematical model of the relation between the input and output based on the differential equations describing the system.|$|E

40|$|Reliability <b>block</b> <b>diagrams</b> {{focus on}} {{components}} and connectors as do software architectures. However, some architectural styles possess characteristics which make traditional reliability <b>block</b> <b>diagrams</b> unusable as an analysis technique.

50|$|Next, {{the systems}} and {{subsystems}} are depicted in functional <b>block</b> <b>diagrams.</b> Reliability <b>block</b> <b>diagrams</b> or fault trees are usually constructed {{at the same}} time.

25|$|One of {{the first}} well defined {{function}} models, was the Functional Flow <b>Block</b> <b>Diagram</b> (FFBD) developed by the defense-related TRW Incorporated in the 1950s. In the 1960s it was exploited by the NASA to visualize the time sequence of events in a space systems and flight missions. It is further widely used in classical systems engineering to show the order of execution of system functions.|$|E
25|$|This <b>block</b> <b>diagram</b> depicts ModelsA, B, A+, and B+. ModelA, A+, and the PiZero {{lack the}} Ethernet and USB hub components. The Ethernet adapter is {{internally}} connected to an additional USB port. In ModelA, A+, and the PiZero, the USB port is connected {{directly to the}} {{system on a chip}} (SoC). On the Pi1 ModelB+ and later models the USB/Ethernet chip contains a five-point USB hub, of which four ports are available, while the Pi1 ModelB only provides two. On the PiZero, the USB port is also connected directly to the SoC, but it uses a micro USB (OTG) port.|$|E
25|$|A {{phase locked}} loop is a {{feedback}} control system. It compares the phases of two input signals and produces an error signal that {{is proportional to the}} difference between their phases. The error signal is then low pass filtered and used to drive a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) which creates an output frequency. The output frequency is fed through a frequency divider back to the input of the system, producing a negative feedback loop. If the output frequency drifts, the phase error signal will increase, driving the frequency in the opposite direction so as to reduce the error. Thus the output is locked to the frequency at the other input. This other input is called the reference and is usually derived from a crystal oscillator, which is very stable in frequency. The <b>block</b> <b>diagram</b> below shows the basic elements and arrangement of a PLL based frequency synthesizer.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Control {{diagrams}} {{are routinely}} used by engineers {{in the design}} of control systems. Yet, currently the formal verification of programs that implement the diagrams is a challenge. We present a strategy to translate <b>block</b> <b>diagrams</b> to Circus, a notation that combines Z, CSP, and a refinement calculus. This work is based on existing tools that produce Z and CSP specifications from discrete-time <b>block</b> <b>diagrams.</b> By using a combined notation, we provide a specification that considers both functional and behavioural aspects of the diagrams, and can cover a wider range of blocks. Moreover, the Circus refinement calculus can be used to derive or verify implementations, and reason about the <b>block</b> <b>diagrams...</b>|$|R
