The use of technology by some of organizations is purposed to increase the efficiency of operational employees. Since such efficiency of that operational is able to support the organizational succeed. Kusuma Agrowisata Batu Hotel has used the information technology at the front office, but in employee data management system still has used such manual system, especially of attendance and remuneration system. On the attendance system is employing archive system and check clock of attendance. Whereas for remunerate system, the personnel part still employs manual accounting. It's including employee's attendance accounting and employee's revenue accounting in a month. In handling those problems need such new system to repairs the current system. The design of this application programs includes the module, such as employee's application and employee's remuneration application. On the application of employee's remuneration, it is applied the use of barcode on the identity card of each employees which can be used as the attendance with medium barcode reader. The making of this application use Borland Delphi 7 and Interbase Server 5. 5 as its databases. The result of this application making is employee's attendance system with medium barcode reader and automate their accounting in the process of employee's remunerate.

40|$|This {{research}} {{presents a}} method for personalising interaction using user interface skins, using personality as a design segment, enabling design for large anonymous user populations. User interface skins represent the audio-visual elements of the user interface, for example background colour or error tone, and can provide a means for the user to quickly and easily change their own user interfaces- and therefore {{the quality of their}} own interaction. However, there is limited research available as to how user interface skins can be best used to provide a more personalised and therefore more personally relevant user experience in comparison to a typical single user interface approach, designed for the average intended user. In this research, three types of user interface element are investigated: colour, shape and meaning. The first two are thought to be operationalised by psychophysiological arousal. Meaning in user interface skins is investigated through a testing of the Similarity Attraction Hypothesis, to determine if people choose interface skins that exhibit the same high levels of certain personality traits that they themselves score highly in.

However, the bandwidth available for mobile systems is constrained <b>by</b> <b>the</b> limited air-interface bandwidth allocated to telecommunications companies operating these systems. As a result, bandwidth over a mobile system's air interface will always be more expensive than fixed line networks. Two important issues result. Firstly, operators will need to smoothen out the peaks of demand on the networks. This {{can be achieved by}} pre-fetching data at off-peak times that will be requested by a user during a peak period. Similarly, low priority requests that are initiated during peak periods can be delayed until a later time when the system is under a lighter load.

This type of self-representation and literary choice shows interesting analogies with the re-establishment of other ‘minor’ genres in a Roman key, i. e. Martial’s epigram and Apuleius’ novel.

40|$|International audienceLarge meshes or images {{cannot be}} {{rendered}} at full resolution on mobile {{devices such as}} cell phones, PDAs and laptops since these devices have limited storage, CPU, memory, display, and battery power. Wavelet-based multiresolution analysis can represent meshes and graphics input at multiple Levels of Detail (LODs). We propose UbiWave, a wavelet-based framework for scalable transmission of large meshes and graphics content to heterogeneous ubiquitous computing devices. In UbiWave, a base representation and different levels of wavelet coefﬁcients are pre-generated at the server. An optimal LOD level is transmitted to each mobile client based on its spacification and wireless channel conditions, where the corresponding LOD is reconstructed. To save scarce resources on mobile devices, we render graphics content at the lowest LOD that does not show visual artifacts, called the point of indiscernability (PoI).

40|$|Abstract Many {{boundaries}} {{impede the}} flow of authorizationinformation, forcing applications that span those boundaries into hop-by-hop approaches to autho-rization. We present a unified approach to authorization. Our approach allows applications that spanadministrative, network, abstraction, and protocol boundaries to understand the end-to-end authoritythat justifies any given request. The resulting distributed systems are more secure and easier to audit. We describe boundaries that can interfere withend-to-end authorization, and outline our unified approach. We describe the system we built and theapplications we adapted to use our unified authorization system, and measure its costs. We concludethat our system is a practical approach to the desirable goal of end-to-end authorization. 1 Introduction As systems grow more complex, they are often grownby affixing one system to another using some form of gateway to bridge boundaries between the systems.

5000|$|The {{origin of}} the {{practice}} has been traced to ancient Rome. Here relationships between the patron (patronus) and client (cliens) were seen as crucial to understanding the political process. While the obligations between these were mutual, the key point is they were hierarchical. These relationships might be best viewed not as an entity {{but rather as a}} network (clientela), with the patronus himself perhaps being obligated to someone of greater power, and <b>the</b> <b>cliens</b> perhaps having more than one patron. These extensions increase the possibilities of conflicting interests arising. While the familia was the basic unit underlying Roman society, the interlocking networks (clientela) acted as restrictions on their autonomy but allowed a more complex society to develop. Historians of the late medieval period evolved the concept into bastard feudalism. There is, as is usual, ambiguity in the use of political terminology and the terms [...] "clientelism", the [...] "patron-client relationship", [...] "patronage" [...] and the political machine are sometimes used to describe similar or related concepts.|$|R

O objectivo deste trabalho foi procurar, através da leitura da obra, a forma como Juvenal constrói a sua crítica servindo-se de tipos (o cliens, o patronus, o delator, o liberto, o efeminado, a mulher adúltera [...] .) para denunciar os vícios (avareza, luxúria, corrupção, hipocrisia, arrogância, venalidade [...] .) que povoavam a sociedade romana do século II da nossa era. Tentámos mostrar como o autor se serve dessas personagens-tipo para criticar e moralizar, como é próprio da sátira. Integrámos o autor no género literário que cultivou, não de forma isolada mas dizendo-se herdeiro de Lucílio e Horácio.

40|$|Purpose – This {{conceptual}} paper address es {{the nature}} of value creation in professional service firms (PSFs). An extensive number of scholars {{have been looking at}} PSFs within law, consulting and engineering to understand knowledge as sour ces of competitive advantage. A dominant part of this literature build on agency t heory to suggest that information asymmetry is an important characteristic and precon dition of value creation in professional services. This p aper identifies a contradiction in the notion of information asymmetry in refer ence to professional services firms. Design/methodology/approach – The paper reviews theoretical contributions explaining the value creation processes in PSFs. While the context of prof essional services might be considered marginal in reference to agency theory, knowledge ha s been identified as one of the key sources of competitive advantage in the 21 st century, and understanding how to develop and leverage such sources of advantage has gained exten sive interest. In addition, the context of knowledge intensi ve and professional services ha s been referred to as extreme and strategically relevan t to understand knowledge base d value creation. Originality/value – We argue {{that it is necessary to}} revisit the assumption of inf ormation asymmetry for two main reasons: First, any asymmetry that is pr oposed to exist is that of knowledge rather than information. Secondly, value creation in the context of PSFs is characterized by mutuality rather than asymmetry as co-producti on with clients as a core component in PSFs value creation. While PSFs might have superio r esoteric professional knowledge, buyers often have superior knowledge of their own co ntext and problem. Both of these types of knowledge are relevant in the value crea tion in PSFs due to the contextual and customized nature of the services they provide. Practical implications – Two important contributions are suggested in the paper: Firs t, the characteristics of value creat ion of PSFs should be revised and extended <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 17 inclusion of knowledge asymmetry and mutuality. This is importa nt for practitioners in that the co-operative and mutual nature of value creation needs to be recognized and nurtured, which has impact of the conduct of both suppliers and buyers of professional services. Secondly, this more complex nature of value creation needs to be recognized from an institutional perspectiv e in that the certification of professionals should incorporate and promote the mutuality and the importance of cli ent needs while at the same time emphasising esoteric professional knowledge and attit ude and the desire to deliver what is objectively best for <b>the</b> <b>clien...</b>|$|R
