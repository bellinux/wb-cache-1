40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Bovine</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>diseases</b> (BRD) affect {{production}} rates negatively {{because it}} compromise {{health and well-being}} of the affected animal. The hypothesis of this study was that the use of metaphylactic protocols based on the risk to develop BRD would reduce morbidity and pulmonary lesions. For this purpose, the aims of this study were to evaluate the effect of two metaphylactic protocols on the morbidity of feedlot cattle with a known sanitary history, occurrence of pulmonary lesions at slaughter, and the possible participation of Mannheimia haemolytica, Histophilus somni, Bovine alphaherpesvirus 1 (BoHV- 1) and <b>bovine</b> <b>respiratory</b> syncytial virus (BRSV) in the development of BRD. An experimental study was designed in which 3, 094 adult, male, cattle, were grouped according to the risk to develop BRD: a) group without metaphylaxis (n= 2, 104), low-risk animals; b) metaphylaxis group with oxytetracycline (n= 789), moderate-risk animals; c) metaphylaxis group with tildipirosin (n= 201), high-risk animals. All cattle were immunized against pathogens associated with BRD (BoHV- 1, BVDV, BRSV, PI 3). The morbidity for BRD was 8. 2 % (253 / 3, 094); cattle within the moderate-risk group for BRD had the lowest frequency (6. 1 %), followed by high-risk animals with tildipirosin metaphylaxis (6. 5 %) and low-risk without metaphylaxis (9. 1 %) (P= 0. 019). At the abattoir, 1. 2 % of lungs with lesions were found. There was a difference (P= 0. 036) in the frequency of pulmonary lesions between healthy animals (1. 1 %) and those diagnosed with BRD (2. 8 %). Two agents associated with BRD were identified by PCR assays in the lungs (n= 37) of cattle: M. haemolytica (16. 2 %) and H. somni (5. 4 %). In addition, concomitant infections involving these pathogens were identified in the lungs of two steers. These results demonstrate that the use of metaphylactic protocols, based on the risk to develop BRD, reduces morbidity and pulmonary lesions in affected cattle. Furthermore, pulmonary lesions were more frequent in animals with a history of BRD...|$|R

For cattle, the high prevalence of M. bovis in bronchopneumonia, notably in young animals, was confirmed by VIGIMYC and an associated specific survey, whereas the non-emergence of species such as M. alkalescens and M. canis was also demonstrated. The etiological agent of bovine contagious pleuropneumonia was never isolated. The principal mycoplasmosis in goats was contagious agalactia with M. mycoides subsp. capri as main agent. Ovine mycoplasmoses, most of which were associated with pneumonia in lambs, were infrequently reported. One exception was ovine contagious agalactia (due to M. agalactiae) that has recently re-emerged in the Pyrénées where it had been endemic for years and was also reported in Corsica, which was previously considered free.

The objectives {{of this study were}} to create plasmid DNA constructs encoding single or multiple N-glycosylation-site deletion BRSV fusion (F) proteins, and evaluate their expression in cell culture, and potential to induce anti-BRSV F antibody responses in BALB/ c mice. Four plasmid DNAs were constructed, each encoding 1 - 4 N-glycosylation-site deletions: Gly 4, Gly 2 / 4, Gly 1 / 2 / 4 and Gly 1 / 2 / 3 / 4. Each of the N-glycosylation-site deletion BRSV F proteins were expressed in COS- 7 cells following transfection with plasmid DNA. Inoculation of BALB/c mice with plasmid DNA, resulted in a significant anti-BRSV F IgG response to the wildtype (WT) F and glycosylation-site deletion protein Gly 2 / 4. Gly 2 / 4 elicited a higher antibody titer than the fully glycosylated WT F protein. Significant neutralizing antibody titers were detected following immunization with the Gly 2 / 4 plasmid DNA.

50|$|Bovine {{herpesvirus}} 1 (BoHV-1) is a virus of {{the family}} Herpesviridae and the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae, known to cause several diseases worldwide in cattle, including rhinotracheitis, vaginitis, balanoposthitis, abortion, conjunctivitis, and enteritis. BoHV-1 is also a contributing factor in shipping fever, also known as <b>bovine</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>disease</b> (BRD). It is spread horizontally through sexual contact, artificial insemination, and aerosol transmission and {{it may also be}} transmitted vertically across the placenta. BoHV-1 can cause both clinical and subclinical infections, depending on the virulence of the strain. Although these symptoms are mainly non-life-threatening it is an economically important disease as infection may cause a drop in production and affect trade restrictions. Like other herpesviruses, BoHV-1 causes a lifelong latent infection and sporadic shedding of the virus. The sciatic nerve and trigeminal nerve are the sites of latency. A reactivated latent carrier is normally the source of infection in a herd. The clinical signs displayed are dependent on the virulence of the strain. There is a vaccine available which reduces the severity and incidence of disease. Some countries in Europe have successfully eradicated the disease by applying a strict culling policy.|$|E
50|$|Flax (or linseed) {{is one of}} {{the most}} biologically {{available}} botanical sources of omega-3 fatty acid which is high in protein and ALA (alpha-linolenic acid). The use of flaxseed in layer mash in chicken egg production has been shown to raise omega-3 levels beyond that of pastured chicken. Recently, research has been conducted involving the use of ground flax seeds as a fat supplement in cattle rations. Being high in protein and fats, it can replace other protein-dense foods such as soy. It is believed that the inclusion of omega-3 fatty acids in the diets of beef producing cattle will bring an increase in health to the animals and to the quality of carcass upon slaughter. Some studies have found that feeding flax seeds may increase the omega-3 content and improve marbling in the carcass of the animal at slaughter while others have found no differences. Flax seeds suppress inflammatory effects from <b>bovine</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>disease</b> (BRD) often affecting stressed cattle due to production practices such as transport and processing. BRD can lead to lung tissue damage and impair the performance of the cattle leading to a low final body mass at slaughter or premature death. Another effect of feeding flax in cattle ration is an observed increase in the daily dry matter intake. This was observed in feeding a total dietary content of omega-3 fatty acids of under 10% of total feed.|$|E

P. multocida strains that cause fowl cholera in poultry typically belong to the serovars 1, 3, and 4. In the wild, fowl cholera has been shown to follow bird migration routes, especially of snow geese. The P. multocida serotype-1 is most associated with avian cholera in North America, but the bacterium does not linger in wetlands for extended periods of time.

40|$|NK-lysin is a {{cationic}} antimicrobial peptide (AMP) of {{the host}} innate immune system and active against {{a broad spectrum of}} targets, including bacteria, viruses, fungi and cancer cells. NK-lysin has been well-studied in humans and pigs, in which each genome contains a single copy of NK-lysin. However, the bovine genome has received much less attention with only one study, in which two 405 -bp Bo-lysin fragments with 94 % nucleotide identity were detected among four experimental donors. These two sequences likely represent two different bovine NK-lysin genes. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to characterize the gene number and the genomic organization of bovine NK-lysins and their roles in host resistance to pathogens, including pathogens involved in <b>bovine</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>diseases</b> (BRD). Two overlapping BAC clones (CH 240 - 372 P 1 and CH 240 - 27 G 22) covering the whole bovine NK-lysin region were sequenced by PacBio (Seattle, WA) and the assembled supercontig revealed four NK-lysin genes on cattle chromosome 11. NK 2 A, NK 2 B and NK 2 C are tandemly arrayed as three copies in 30 ~ 35 Kb segments, located 41. 8 Kb upstream of NK 1. All four genes are functional, albeit with differential tissue expression. NK 1, NK 2 A and NK 2 B exhibited the highest expression in intestine Peyer?s patch while NK 2 C was expressed almost exclusively in lung. Four peptides corresponding to the functional helices 2 & 3 of each gene product were synthesized. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy demonstrated that peptides adopted a more helical secondary structure upon binding to an anionic model membrane, and a liposome leakage assay suggested that these peptides disrupt the model membrane. To test the potential role in host response to BRD pathogens, we analyzed RNA-seq data to determine expression of each NK-lysin gene in bronchial lymph node and lung in healthy animals and animals challenged with BRD pathogens. The expression of some NK-lysins, especially NK 2 C, was significantly elevated in most of the challenged animals, indicating potential functions in BRD resistance.
