40|$|Although {{fluorescent}} lamp {{is a very}} efficient lighting device in daily life, still the high harmonic distortion and low power factor cause unnecessary energy consumption. In today’s environment demanding energy efficiency, {{it is important to}} reduce this energy loss by integrating an energy saving controller in the electromagnetic <b>ballast</b> of fluorescent <b>lamps.</b> The research presented in this thesis investigates the design and implementation of a new energy saving controller for electromagnetic {{fluorescent lamp}} network. The newly developed controller attempts to reduce power losses in both the electromagnetic <b>ballasts</b> and fluorescent <b>lamps</b> by regulating the incoming supply voltage to an optimum level. In addition, the new controller is able to adjust the illuminance level of working environment lightings under either dark or bright condition. Moreover, the function of the new controller is extended with time scheduling control capability, where the switching of lighting systems can be controlled at predetermined times based on occupancy schedule. Both simulation and practical results show that the implemented controller reduces energy consumption by at least 37. 5 %, by reducing the incoming supply voltage by 15 %. In addition, it is desirable to have variable illuminance level control to decrease the energy losses. The experimental results show that the illuminance output level of electromagnetic <b>ballast</b> fluorescent <b>lamps</b> can be decreased by 50 % using the new controller while maintaining unity power factor. Integration of the new energy saving controller into electromagnetic <b>ballast</b> fluorescent <b>lamps</b> impressively outperforms the existing electronic dimmable ballast.

40|$|A two-stage, {{two-wire}} TRIAC dimmable electronic <b>ballast</b> for fluorescent <b>lamps</b> {{is presented}} in this paper. It is constructed by using a flyback converter as the input power factor corrector to supply a half-bridge series-resonant parallel-loaded inverter to <b>ballast</b> the <b>lamp.</b> The flyback converter is operated in discontinuous conduction mode so that the filtered input current profile is same as the TRIAC-controlled voltage waveform. The switches in the inverter are switched at a constant frequency slightly higher than the resonant frequency of the resonant tank. Based on the constant average input current characteristics of the inverter, dimming operation is simply achieved by pulse-width-modulation control {{of the magnitude of}} the flyback converter output voltage. No synchronization network is required between the input and output stages. In addition, a novel power equalization scheme is developed so that the dc link voltage (and hence the lamp power) is in linear relationships with the firing angle of the TRIAC. The average output voltage of the dimmer controls the equalized flyback converter output voltage. Modeling, analysis, and design of the ballast will be described. A prototype has been implemented to verify the experimental measurements with the theoretical predictions. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Ceramic Metal Halide lamp is the latest improved version of metal halide lamp that finds its wide applications in indoor commercial lighting especially in retail shop lighting. This lamp shows better performance in terms of higher lumen per watt and colour constancy in comparison to conventional metal halide lamp. The inherent negative incremental impedance of CMH lamp demands the use of current control device in the lamp circuit and perfect matching of <b>lamp</b> <b>ballast</b> combination is required for efficient lamp operation. The electrical and photometric performance of two sets of commercial 70 watt CMH <b>lamp</b> and intregated <b>ballast</b> units were measured to investigate their compatibility for optimum lamp operation.

40|$|Two {{important}} {{subjects in}} high frequency fluorescent lighting are investigated. Part I. presents a fundamental {{understanding of the}} negative incremental impedance of flourescent lamps. Search for simple, high power factor, <b>lamp</b> <b>ballast</b> topologies, a more practical aspect of lighting electronics, is presented in Part II. Part I. Flourescent lamps have a special v-i characteristic. Their incremental or small-signal impedance is defined and studied in the frequency domain. It is found that the negative incremental impedance of a fluorescent lamp can be characterized by a right half plane zero. The existence of such a result is explained by the modified Francis equation. Two approaches are proposed in order {{to set up a}} stable operating point for the lamp. First, a resonant matching network, which provides impedance transformation, is placed between a voltage source and the lamp. Second, a feedback loop is closed from the lamp current to control the magnitude of the voltage source. Stability criteria based on the Nyquist criterion are developed for the impedance of the resonant matching network and for the loop gain in the above two cases, respectively. It is found that the input impedance of a switching dc-to-dc regulator, which is another case with the negative incremental impedance, and the fluorescent lamp impedance, are two dual cases and thus can be analyzed in a unified manner based on the stability of one-port circuit. The small-signal lamp impedance is measured in the most practical case of a sinusoidal carrier, and it is fit by a real rational function with a right half plane zero. The small signal models describing low frequency variations of sinusoidal magnitude are developed and are experimentally verified for the three major resonant matching networks. Stability analysis for resonant matching networks at parallel resonance are performed. It shows that the LCC network is the simplest resonant matching network that a fluorescent lamp needs. It is also predicted, and experimentally verified, that the resonant matching networks at series resonance are feasible as <b>ballasts</b> when the <b>lamp</b> current feedback loop is closed. Part II. Unlike conventional high power factor ballasts requiring two cascaded power conversion stages, the proposed new <b>lamp</b> <b>ballasts</b> achieve near unity input power factor and high frequency sinusoidal lamp current in a single power conversion stage. A single-stage, high power factor <b>lamp</b> <b>ballast</b> is proposed, which is derived from the Cuk converter. A new discontinuous inductor current mode of its input inductor makes this possible by separating the input current-shaping from the output high frequency inversion. The desirable mode of operation is presented with major waveforms. The high efficiency is further enhanced by the soft-switching improvement, which is provided naturally through the lagging current of the resonant matching network. Design equations are given. The performances of the proposed single-stage, high power factor <b>lamp</b> <b>ballast</b> are verified by the experimental results. Single-switch, unity power factor ac-to-ac converter topologies based on proper integrations of automatic current shapers and single-switch inverters, such as the Class E converter, are presented, which are suitable for <b>lamp</b> <b>ballast</b> applications. Descriptions of the desirable mode of operations and a first order analysis are given. The ballasts have the compact structure of single active switch, high input power factor and low crest factor lamp current as well as soft-switching.
