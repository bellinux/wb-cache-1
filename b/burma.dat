5|$|The {{governments of}} India and <b>Burma</b> have {{proposed}} building, with China's cooperation, {{a link to}} the Eurasian Land Bridge that would start in India or <b>Burma</b> and connect to the Chinese rail system in Yunnan. The route would allow freight from India and <b>Burma</b> to travel overland to Europe. The link would also give rail access for China to the Indian Ocean. One proposed starting point for the route is Kyaukpyu. The governments of Thailand and Malaysia are also studying the feasibility of establishing rail links with China.|$|E
5|$|Throughout 1282, the Mongol command made {{preparations}} for the upcoming invasions of Champa and northern <b>Burma.</b> The objective of the <b>Burma</b> campaign was to take over northern <b>Burma</b> but no further; the emperor did not sanction an attack on Pagan itself. At least one army consisted of 14,000 men of the erstwhile Persian Khwarezmid Empire {{under the command of}} Yalu Beg was sent to Yunnan to reinforce the <b>Burma</b> invasion force, which again was made up of Turks and other central Asians. On the Burmese side, the king managed to raise an army although given his low standing with his vassals, he probably could not have raised a large one. By mid-1283, a Burmese army led by generals Ananda Pyissi and Yanda Pyissi was deployed at a fort at Ngasaunggyan.|$|E

5|$|Brereton sent Haynes to Dinjan Airfield in the Indian {{state of}} Assam to {{continue}} his supply-line work under the name Assam-Burma-China Ferry Command, or ABC Ferry Command, with the mission of supplying American forces in China. This air organization was formed to carry supplies over the Hump, the air route replacement for the enemy-held <b>Burma</b> Road. At first, Haynes worked with only two C-47 transports, and was accompanied on some missions by just one P-40 Warhawk fighter flown by the outfit's executive of operations, Colonel Robert Lee Scott, Jr., who had shifted to flying a fighter once HALPRO was canceled. When <b>Burma</b> appeared to be falling to the Japanese, Haynes {{and a handful of}} other airmen of the Chinese National Aviation Corporation and the Royal Air Force flew hundreds of evacuation missions from April to mid-June, bringing some 4,500 passengers westward to safety in India. The American ferry aircraft would typically deliver supplies to China then stop in <b>Burma</b> on the way back to Assam.|$|E

5|$|During the Second Sino-Japanese War, many Chinese {{seaports}} {{were either}} captured or blockaded by the Japanese, {{in an attempt}} to prevent supplies from entering China. As a result, an alternative overland road named <b>Burma</b> Road, became China's most important supply route. Completed in 1938, supplies were sent by sea to the port in Rangoon, <b>Burma,</b> transported overland by rail to Lashio and through the <b>Burma</b> Road to Kunming in China. Due to lack of experienced drivers and mechanics in China, the Chinese government requested Tan Kah Kee, the Chairman of the China Relief Fund, to recruit volunteers from Nanyang (a term used by the Chinese when referring to Southeast Asia). Following the request, the China Relief Fund published the first recruitment notice on 7 February 1939.|$|E

He attributed his recovery to the pile of penny dreadful novels he discovered in his bungalow at Pungatong, which he then read constantly for the next few days.|$|E
