5|$|When receptive, females respond {{similarly}} to <b>both</b> <b>male</b> types: approach and settle; extend the foremost pair of legs or tap with them. <b>Both</b> <b>male</b> morphs typically end their initial display and start leg-clapping and zig-zag dancing.|$|E

5|$|A {{field study}} in Brisbane found that F. rubiginosa trees often bore <b>both</b> <b>male</b> and female phase syconia {{at the same}} time, which could be {{beneficial}} for reproduction in isolated populations. The same study found that male phase syconia development persisted through the winter, showing that its wasp pollinator tolerated cooler weather than those of more tropical fig species. F. rubiginosa itself can endure cooler climates than {{other members of the}} genus.|$|E
5|$|A {{resistance}} movement developed in Belgium {{soon after the}} German occupation. The resistance took various forms. Although some sabotages by the resistance, notably {{the destruction of the}} Brussels-Aachen railway line, were celebrated at the time, armed resistance represented a minority of their acts. Around 300 separate resistance networks existed which often included <b>both</b> <b>male</b> and female members.|$|E

5|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, {{it is not}} only males that are ousted from their pride to become nomads, {{although}} most females certainly do remain with their birth pride. However, when the pride becomes too large, the next generation of female cubs may be forced to leave to eke out their own territory. Furthermore, when a new male lion takes over the pride, adolescent lions, <b>both</b> <b>male</b> and female, may be evicted.|$|E
5|$|Despite its disappointing box-office returns, in {{what was}} then {{considered}} a risky move, Warner Home Video shipped 320,000 rental video copies throughout the United States in 1995. It went on {{to become one of the}} top rented films of the year. Positive recommendations and repeat customer viewings, and being well received by <b>both</b> <b>male</b> and female audiences, were considered key to the film's rental success.|$|E
5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, <b>both</b> <b>male</b> and female mallards can become aggressive, driving off competitors to {{themselves or their}} mate by charging at them. Males tend to fight more than females, and attack each other by repeatedly pecking at their rival's chest, ripping out feathers and even skin on rare occasions.|$|E

5|$|Pteranodon {{species are}} {{extremely}} well {{represented in the}} fossil record, allowing for detailed descriptions of their anatomy and analysis of their life history. Over 1,000 specimens have been identified, though less than half are complete enough to give researchers good information on the anatomy of the animal. Still, this is more fossil material than is known for any other pterosaur, and it includes <b>both</b> <b>male</b> and female specimens of various age groups and, possibly, species.|$|E

The marriage of IlƒÅ, a descendant of the Sun, and Budha, {{the son of the}} Moon, is the first union of the solar and lunar races recorded in the scriptures.|$|E

In this bout, <b>both</b> <b>male</b> and female wrestlers could fight each other and all weapons were legal to use. The only way to win was by pinfall or submission. Rhino won the match for his team after {{tackling}} Kip with his signature Gore maneuver at 6 minutes and 15 seconds.|$|E
5|$|A {{school was}} founded in Deir Ghassaneh in 1925. Prior to the British Mandate period, boys would {{normally}} receive education in a kuttab, an elementary-type school with Islamic law and tradition having {{a major influence on}} the curriculum. Today, there is one elementary school (Bani Zeid Elementary School) and one secondary school (Bashir al-Barghouti Secondary School) in the town of Bani Zeid, both run by the government. According to the Palestinian Ministry of Education and Higher Education, in the 2010-2011 academic year there were 26 classes occupied by 691 students, <b>both</b> <b>male</b> and female. There was 45 teaching staff. There are no kindergartens in Bani Zeid. The closest institution for higher learning is Birzeit University in the village of Bir Zeit to the southeast.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{all species}} are hermaphrodites, {{in other words}} each {{individual}} can function as <b>both</b> <b>male</b> and female. Some are simultaneous hermaphrodites, which can produce both eggs and sperm at the same time, while others are sequential hermaphrodites, in which the eggs and sperm mature at different times. The gonads {{are located in the}} parts of the internal canal network under the comb rows, and eggs and sperm are released via pores in the epidermis. Fertilization is generally external, but platyctenids use internal fertilization and keep the eggs in brood chambers until they hatch. Self-fertilization has occasionally been seen in species of the genus Mnemiopsis, and it is thought that most of the hermaphroditic species are self-fertile.|$|E

5|$|Argasid ticks, unlike ixodid ticks, may {{go through}} {{up to seven}} nymphal stages (instars), {{requiring}} a meal of blood each time. Their life cycles range from months to years. The adult female argasid tick can lay a few hundred to over a thousand eggs {{over the course of}} her lifetime. Larvae feed very quickly and detach to molt into nymphs. <b>Both</b> <b>male</b> and female adults feed on blood, and they mate off the host. During feeding, any excess fluid is excreted by the coxal glands, a process which is unique to argasid ticks.|$|E
5|$|At {{the edge}} of the Greenstead Parish {{boundary}} is Rovers Tye Farm, which has been documented as being established by 1353. A new causeway at this location had been built by 1429, by which point Ipswich Road ran on its current route. This road was turnpiked in 1725, when the road was predominantly rural in nature. In 1841, a prison, known as the House of Correction or County Gaol, was built on the road to alleviate pressure on Colchester Castle, but it only held about 25 or 30 prisoners, <b>both</b> <b>male</b> and female, at any one time.|$|E
5|$|Female {{and male}} flowers in each syconium mature at {{different}} times. Female wasps enter the syconium and lay {{eggs in the}} female flowers as they mature. These eggs later hatch and the progeny mate. The females of the new generation collect pollen from the male flowers, which have matured by this point, and leave to visit other syconia and repeat the process. A field study in Brisbane found that F. obliqua trees often bore <b>both</b> <b>male</b> and female syconia at the same time‚Äîthis could be beneficial for reproduction in isolated populations, such as those on islands. The same study found a slightly reduced number of male phase syconia in winter, thought due to increased mortality of the wasp pollinator in cooler months.|$|E
