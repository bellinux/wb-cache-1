5|$|In 1997, Morton {{returned}} to the band. Two years later, the band released its first full-length self-titled album, Burn the Priest, through Legion Records. Mikey Brosnan of Legion Records saved up $2,500 for the recording and then broke them in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania through DIY shows. The album was produced <b>by</b> <b>Today</b> Is the Day guitarist and vocalist Steve Austin. Spear left the band, leaving an open position for a guitarist. Adler's younger brother Willie became the band's second guitarist a year later, and a deal with Prosthetic Records was signed. Contrary to rumour, the band did not change their name to Lamb of God after being banned from venues; these bans occurred afterwards. They changed their name because of the altered line-up, and to avoid being mistaken for a satanic metal band.|$|E

25|$|When first discovered, Iapetus {{was among}} four Saturnian moons {{labelled}} the Sidera Lodoicea by their discoverer Giovanni Cassini after King Louis XIV (the other three were Tethys, Dione and Rhea). However, astronomers {{fell into the}} habit of referring to them using Roman numerals, with Iapetus being Saturn V. Once Mimas and Enceladus were discovered in 1789, the numbering scheme was extended and Iapetus became SaturnVII. And with the discovery of Hyperion in 1848, Iapetus became Saturn VIII, which it is still known <b>by</b> <b>today</b> (see naming of natural satellites).|$|E

25|$|With {{the growth}} of the {{distillery}} and the flour mill, Walker expanded the business in many ways. He began to build Walker Road in 1860, and hire many employees, such as salesmen, office workers or skilled trade workers. With this developed an increase in population in the area, especially in respects to it being centralized around the mill and distillery. On March 1, 1869, Walker’s Town established its first post office. This is when the government recognized the small hamlet as the name it is known <b>by</b> <b>today,</b> Walkerville.|$|E
25|$|The {{largest public}} ice rink in the world, the Sportpalast in Berlin, {{opened in the}} 1910s. The rink had an area of 2,400m2 (25,800ft2), with {{dimensions}} of 60m by 40m (197ft by 131ft). The new rink increased both the public interest in figure skating {{as well as the}} number of people who practiced the sport. Many new figure skaters came from Germany, among them Werner Rittberger and Charlotta Oelschägel. Rittberger invented another jump, at first named eponymously, but eventually changed to the name it is known <b>by</b> <b>today,</b> the loop jump. Oelschlägel won a championship in the United States at the age of 17, and had a professional career spanning ten years.|$|E

But is still served with three great schools, Riachuelo Remo, Martinelli Remo and Aldo Luz Remo, with all three being placed between Hercílio Luz Bridge, Colombo Salles Bridge and Pedro Ivo Campos Bridge.

25|$|On July 1, 1952, WBAP-TV became {{among the}} first six {{television}} stations in the country (along with fellow NBC stations KPRC-TV in Houston, WOAI-TV in San Antonio, WKY-TV (now KFOR-TV) in Oklahoma City, KOTV (now a CBS affiliate) in Tulsa and WDSU in New Orleans) to begin transmitting network programming over a live microwave feed, inaugurated with a message <b>by</b> <b>Today</b> Show host Dave Garroway welcoming the stations in commencing live network telecasts. That decade, Channel 5 also {{became one of the}} first television stations to convert its local programming to color; the station's conversion to color broadcasts on May 15, 1954 was preceded by a dedication of its new production and master control facilities—which were upgraded specifically for color telecasting—from Carter and David Sarnoff, chairman of then-NBC parent RCA, that was broadcast on the station; this was followed by a three-hour block of programs produced in color, the longest broadcast of such programs ever attempted by a television station at that time. By 1955, WBAP-TV—which had earlier ordered RCA color television equipment in the fall of 1949, and became the first television station in Texas to broadcast NBC programs in color on April 9, 1954—had greatly increased the number of programs that it broadcast in color, televising the largest amount of programming produced in the format of any U.S. television station at the time.|$|E

500|$|The early Armenian {{immigrants}} in Detroit were mostly laborers. In later decades, {{particularly since the}} 1960s Middle Eastern Armenians immigrated to Michigan. The Armenian community {{has been described as}} [...] "highly educated, professional and prospering." [...] Today, they number about 22,000. Chicago's Armenians also first settled in the city in late 19th century in small numbers, but it increased through the 20th century, reaching about 25,000 <b>by</b> <b>today.</b> As of 2003 more than 8,000 Armenian Americans lived in Washington, DC. The Armenian Genocide Museum of America is also located in the capital. Since {{the turn of the century}} there been a trend towards an increase in number of Armenians living outside of traditional settlement areas. For instance, the number of Armenians in Nevada increased from 2,880 in 2000 to 5,845 in 2010, Florida from 9,226 to 15,856, and Texas from 4,941 to 14,459.|$|E

2500|$|The show {{moved from}} the ABC News {{headquarters}} in Manhattan's Lincoln Square district to its present home at the Times Square Studios on September 13, 1999. The new location {{made it possible for}} the program to feature a live audience inside the studio, similar to the [...] "Window on the World" [...] set used <b>by</b> <b>Today.</b> Under Ross, Good Morning America became a competitive 24/7 news operation with more exclusive bookings, news and live stock market updates for West Coast viewers and new on-screen graphics that included a news ticker. Good Morning America began originating entire shows from unique locations, which, according to Nielsen Media Research, resulted in more people watching the program and for longer periods of time. GMA became the first to originate a live show from an aircraft carrier during wartime (the U.S.S. Enterprise), from The White House (after the Columbine shootings), from The Pentagon (for the reopening of the wing damaged during the September 11 attacks in 2001), from The Vatican (for the 25th anniversary of John Paul II's election as Pope), and from the Tower of London (on the 50th anniversary of Queen Elizabethʼs accession to the throne). Viewership during this time increased by nearly 1 million households, and revenue soared.|$|E
2500|$|While in {{graduate}} school in New York, Blache transitioned from the large life-size format on canvas and began working on small Masonite scraps that fellow students would discard originally as a cost cutting measure. [...] This change in format would then become smaller wood scraps that Blache would get from various lumber yards in Manhattan but he has since transitioned to painting on custom wood panels that he has specially prepared. The much smaller and intimate format suited him well. [...] Blache {{liked the idea of}} bringing the viewer closer to his smaller pocket-sized paintings versus the greater distance viewers once needed to view his large life-sized canvases. [...] This new size was first displayed at his thesis show at the Tribeca Art Club in the spring of 2000. [...] This was a period of transition for Blache, not just in scale and surface, but in subject matter too. [...] He declined doing commissioned portraits (a practice that he still abides <b>by</b> <b>today)</b> and would only work with sitters of his choosing. [...] Blache's Brooklyn loft, in the Bushwick neighborhood became the background and setting for friends and former classmates to model for him.

2500|$|NMPs are {{supposed}} to be non-partisan but after it had been announced on 7 July 2009 that Calvin Cheng {{would be one of the}} nine people nominated to be NMPs it was disclosed <b>by</b> <b>Today</b> newspaper that he was a member of Young PAP, the youth wing of the People's Action Party. The following day, Cheng wrote to the newspaper stating that he had formally resigned from Young PAP on 8 July, and that in any case he had been an inactive member, having never collected his membership card or attended any PAP branch activities. This led to a journalist commenting that his attitude had been [...] "cavalier" [...] and [...] "whimsical", and a Young PAP member writing on the Forum page of The Straits Times that his remarks had raised doubts about the Young PAP's credibility. The Constitution does not explicitly bar NMPs from being members of political parties, and Gerard Ee was also a PAP member when he was an NMP. He did not feel he had to resign, as since he was not subject to the party whip he would not be prevented from expressing independent views in Parliament. Despite these initial criticisms, The Straits Times reported that Cheng [...] "left the strongest impression on many elected Members of Parliament", following speeches he made during his maiden budget debate in Parliament in 2010. In his final speech during Budget 2011 before Parliament was dissolved for the general election that year, Cheng argued for the Government to educate the Internet generation instead of regulating the Internet to deal with threats such as [...] "misinformation and disinformation", calling it [...] "pointless". He went on to say that the Internet might be a [...] "wild card" [...] during the general election.|$|E
