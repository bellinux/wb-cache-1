Analysis of the various mechanisms of the formation of the transverse surface cracks made it possible to offer a series of recommendations to reduce the probability of fracturing: a) to optimize the chemical composition of the steel in order to obtain the lowest possible temperature end δ-γ conversion in the range of existence of the single-phase austenite region existence, b) to minimize the content of harmful impurities (sulfur phosphorus, nitrogen, non-ferrous metals) in the molten steel and alloying elements, the presence of which negatively affects the mechanical properties of the steel at high temperatures; c) to provide a stable heat removal from the crust of the ingot that does not make it possible to form coarse macrogranular structure; g) to provide the conditions for the formation of large inclusions and uniform distribution in the matrix metal; d) to prevent deformation of continuous casting at temperatures with lower plastic propertie...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The paper {{deals with}} the {{investigation}} of secondary phases evolution during quenching, quenching and tempering in the high – chromium martensitic GX 12 CrMoVNbN 9 - 1 (GP 91) <b>cast</b> <b>steel.</b> It also includes the analysis of evolution of secondary phases in the as - cast condition and after stress relief annealing at the temperature of 750 °C of the tempered GP 91 <b>cast</b> <b>steel.</b> Design/methodology/approach: Microstructure of the <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> was characterized using scanning electron microscopy JOEL JSM 6610 LV and high – resolution transmission electron microscopy JOEL JEM - 3010. Identification of the precipitates was made by means of thin foils and extraction carbon replicas. They were analyzed using {{selected area electron diffraction}} (SAD). The chemical composition of precipitations was determined by means of energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Moreover, there were measurements made with regard to mechanical properties (hardness). Findings: Performed research made it possible to determine the morphology of precipitates for the particular examined conditions of GP 91 <b>cast</b> <b>steel.</b> The sequence of precipitation process has been proposed for the investigated <b>cast</b> <b>steel.</b> Research limitations/implications: It is necessary to continue the research {{in order to determine the}} description of microstructure and the type of particles after different heat treatment parameters.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the paper is to {{characterize}} the low cycle fatigue of high - chromium martensitic GX 12 CrMoVNbN 9 - 1 <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> {{from the perspective of}} the strain and energy criterion. Design/methodology/approach: The tests of fatigue strength within the scope of small amount of cycles to failure at room temperature and elevated temperature (400, 550 and 600 °C) were carried out on GX 12 CrMoVNbN 9 - 1 <b>cast</b> <b>steel.</b> The fatigue tests were run for five assumed levels of controlled amplitude of total strain εac (0. 25; 0. 30; 0. 35; 0. 50 and 0. 60 %). The loading applied in the experiment oscillated sinusoidally with the stress ratio R = - 1 and frequency f = 0. 2 Hz. The fatigue tests were performed by means of Instron 8501 hydropulser. Tests pieces for the fatigue tests were round and threaded. Findings: The examined <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> during low cycle fatigue is subject to intense weakening. The period of stabilization was not revealed during the cyclic loading of the <b>cast</b> <b>steel,</b> neither at room temperature, nor elevated one. Moreover, it has been proved that the extent of changes in the cyclic properties is influenced by the level of strain and temperature. Practical implications: Obtained results of the tests are indispensable for the formulation of necessary characteristics of high-temperature creep resisting <b>steels</b> and <b>cast</b> <b>steels.</b> Originality/value: The paper presents the fatigue characteristics of GX 12 CrMoVNbN 9 - 1 <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> within the scope of small amount of cycles to failure. The fatigue characteristics of the examined <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> was developed for both: room temperature and elevated temperature - 400, 550 and 600 °C. Fatigue life of the investigated <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> was described using the equations of Ramberg-Osgood and Manson-Coffin-Basquin, and presented {{from the perspective of the}} energy criterion...|$|R
50|$|The {{engineers}} {{were a part}} of the renaissance of <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> for structural engineering. During the construction of the cable net roofs for the Olympic Games in Munich, this rediscovery made the construction feasible and allowed for the timely completion of the project. The <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> allows for the production of geometrically complicated pipe nodes and an optimal alignment to the load distribution. Nowadays dynamically curved <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> nodes are used for street bridges (Nesenbachtal Bridge, Stuttgart) and railroad bridges (Humboldthafen Bridge, Berlin) as well as for high rise buildings (Exhibition Hall 13, Hannover).|$|R
40|$|Two {{technologies}} of the G 17 CrMo 5 - 5 <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> melting were compared, i. e. the so far used oxygen-recovery melting technology (electricarc furnace + ladle furnace – EAF + LF) {{and a new}} recovery melting technology (electric induction furnace + ladle furnace - EIF + LF). The effect of the melting technology on the properties of <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> for turbine parts was determined. The <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> was evaluated in term of its metallurgical purity and mechanical properties. During melting of G 17 CrMo 5 - 5 steel in induction furnace, lower total content of oxygen in casting was reached, but nitrogen content was higher {{than it was in}} the <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> from arc furnace. Metal refining in LF improved the steel desulphurising degree and contributed to modification of the non-metallic inclusions...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an effect of}} stress relief annealing, applied to casts after the repair by welding, on the microstructure and mechanical properties of quenched and tempered martensitic GX 12 CrMoVNbN 9 – 1 <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> (called GP 91). The test pieces being the subject of research were taken out from a test coupon. Heat treatment of GP 91 <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> was carried out at the parameters of temperature and time appropriate {{for the treatment of}} multi-ton <b>steel</b> <b>casts,</b> while stress relief annealing was performed at the temperatures of 730 and 750 oC. After quenching and tempering GP 91 <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> was characterized by the microstructure of high-tempered martensite with numerousprecipitations of carbides of diverse size. Mechanical properties of the investigated <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> after heat treatment fulfilled the standard requirements. Stress relief annealing contributes to the processes of recovery and recrystallization of the matrix as well as the privileged precipitation of M 23 C 6 carbides on grain boundaries. Changes in the microstructure of the examined <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> cause deterioration in mechanical properties – the higher the temperature of stress relief annealing, the greater the deterioration...|$|R
