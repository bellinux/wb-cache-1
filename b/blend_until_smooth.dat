Digester D 5 was then fed with this substrate blend for 60 days when the experiment was terminated. Digester D 6 was fed with the industrial sludge (2 g VS/L) and deionized water until an active volume of 4 L was resumed. The loading rate was then allowed to increase with 0.5 kg VS/L/day every 5 days until 3 g VS/L/day was reached. This loading rate was kept for the remaining experimental period of 60 days.|$|R
50|$|The {{appellation}} {{was approved}} {{for the production}} of red varietal wines starting with the 2003 vintage. These wines must contain a minimum of 50% Merlot with Grenache, Malbec and Syrah. Carignan is permitted at a maximum of 10% of the <b>blend</b> <b>until</b> 2010 when the variety is expected to be phased out completely of Limoux production. All together there must be at least 3 grape varieties in the blend with no two single varieties exceeding 90% of the total blend. In recent years, the Limoux AOC has seen significant investment by negociants, cooperatives and larger French wine estates, like Baroness Philippine de Rothschild of Château Mouton Rothschild, who see potential in the red wines from this traditionally sparkling white wine region.|$|R

The dried chili pod must be soaked, seeded, and then drained of excess water.The lemongrass stalks {{need to be}} thinly sliced and fresh galangal should be diced. If fresh or brine-soaked turmeric is used, it must be diced as well. Kaffir lime zest must be sliced into thin strips and Kaffir lime leaves require deveining and thinly chopping. The ingredients are then added to the mortar and pounded, usually lime zest/leaves first <b>until</b> <b>smooth,</b> then chili, lemongrass, galangal, and turmeric, until a deep red color is achieved.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel method for the {{metamorphosis}} between two different images. By the approach, the transition sequence {{is generated by}} stitching two forward and backward warped sequences in a three-dimensional space along transition surface. In contrast to the traditional methods by blending two warped images at each intermediate frame, we continuously warp images on opposite direction without <b>blending</b> <b>until</b> the two warped images match in a three-dimensional space leading to a better transition in quality. Furthermore, for each pixel, we make decision of choosing a given input image best suitable so as to produce plausible in-between images to prevent from ghost and blur. By our scheme, the transition surface is computed by minimizing an energy function in terms of graph-cut optimization. Depending on the transition surface, a warp function is proposed to create a smooth and clear transformation. We demonstrate the advantage of our framework by performing transformation test to various kinds of image couples. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

50|$|In most light {{aircraft}}, as {{the stall}} is reached, the aircraft {{will start to}} descend (because the wing is no longer producing enough lift to support the aircraft's weight) and the nose will pitch down. Recovery from the stall involves lowering the aircraft nose, to decrease the angle of attack and increase the air speed, <b>until</b> <b>smooth</b> air-flow over the wing is restored. Normal flight can be resumed once recovery is complete. The maneuver is normally quite safe and if correctly handled leads to only a small loss in altitude (20-30 m/50'-100'). It is taught and practised in order for pilots to recognize, avoid, and recover from stalling the aircraft. A pilot is required to demonstrate competency in controlling an aircraft during and after a stall for certification, {{and it is a}} routine maneuver for pilots when getting to know the handling of a new aircraft type. The only dangerous aspect of a stall is a lack of altitude for recovery.|$|R
