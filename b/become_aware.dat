5|$|Sustainable seafood is seafood {{from either}} fished or farmed sources that can {{maintain}} or increase {{production in the}} future without jeopardizing the ecosystems from which it was acquired. The sustainable seafood movement has gained momentum as more people <b>become</b> <b>aware</b> about both overfishing and environmentally destructive fishing methods.|$|E

5|$|The Prana (breath, vital air) of {{the body}} is {{dispersed}} within and outside the body. The first aim of yoga is to <b>become</b> <b>aware</b> and control this vital air, to be equal to or lower than the inner fire within one's body. This inner fire resides in the middle part {{of the body}}, and he calls it the Nabhi (center) and a Chakra. This is the residence of the Jiva, and the vital air nourishes it from below while one is alive. Just above this Nabhi is the kundalini which normally is dormant. Yoga awakens her, by bringing vital air and heat to her.|$|E

Gwen feels guilty at having caused the man's death, but team leader Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) assures her that {{everybody}} makes mistakes. Gwen also learns {{that she is the}} only team member who's in a relationship, as the others are too busy working to find time. They later find where Carys lives and arrives there before she could harm a postman. When she tries to escape, Owen traps her using a portable prison cell, much to Jack's chagrin, as he forbids the removal of alien technology from Torchwood's base without his permission.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} {{noted in}} paragraph 176 that an Australian having dual citizenship must take some step to renounce {{his or her}} former citizenship before {{he or she can}} be treated under Australian law as having renounced it, and noted in paragraph 104 that Hill had on 18 November 1998 <b>become</b> <b>aware</b> of steps that could be taken to renounce her British citizenship, and had taken steps to effect the renunciation on the following day. The election, however, had taken place on 3 October 1998, on which date Hill was still a dual national.|$|E

5|$|After {{three months}} of {{inactivity}} and regrouping, Kagame decided in January 1991 that the RPF was ready to begin fighting again. The target chosen for the first attack was {{the northern city of}} Ruhengeri, which lies immediately south of the Virunga mountains. The city was the best choice from a practical point of view, being the only provincial capital that could be attacked quickly from the Virungas while maintaining an element of surprise. Kagame also favoured an attack on Ruhengeri for cultural reasons. President Habyarimana, as well as his wife and her powerful family, came from the north west of Rwanda and most Rwandans regarded the region was as the heartland of the regime. An attack there guaranteed that the population would <b>become</b> <b>aware</b> of the RPF's presence, and Kagame hoped the attack would destabilise the government.|$|E
5|$|Although no Chinese sources {{detail the}} event, Portuguese sources tell {{of how the}} Portuguese were summoned on the first and fifteenth days of each lunar month to ceremoniously {{prostrate}} themselves before a wall of the Forbidden City to seek another audience with the emperor. From Beijing, the Portuguese embassy heard reports that the emperor reached Tongzhou in January 1521 and had the rebel Prince of Ning executed there. The Portuguese embassy had also <b>become</b> <b>aware</b> that ambassadors from the exiled King of Malacca were sent to Beijing seeking assistance from the Chinese emperor in expelling the conquering Portuguese so that their king could be reinstalled there. The Portuguese also knew of two officials in the Censorate—Qiu Daolong and He Ao— who sent memorials to the throne that condemned the Portuguese conquest of Malacca and that their embassy should be rejected. There were also reports sent to Beijing by Canton officials stating that the Portuguese were bothersome foreigners who sought {{to build their own}} trading post.|$|E
5|$|Although very {{distinctive}} in appearance, the {{fly agaric}} has been mistaken for other yellow to red mushroom {{species in the}} Americas, such as Armillaria cf. mellea and the edible Amanita basii—a Mexican species similar to A.caesarea of Europe. Poison control centres in the U.S. and Canada have <b>become</b> <b>aware</b> that amarill (Spanish for 'yellow') is a common name for the A.caesarea-like species in Mexico. Amanita caesarea can be distinguished by its entirely orange to red cap which lacks the numerous white warty spots of the fly agaric. Furthermore, the stem, gills and ring of A. caesarea are bright yellow, not white. The volva is a distinct white bag, not broken into scales. In Australia, the introduced fly agaric may {{be confused with the}} native vermilion grisette (Amanita xanthocephala), which grows in association with eucalypts. The latter species generally lacks the white warts of A.muscaria and bears no ring.|$|E

5|$|As {{a student}} holidaying in coastal towns, Hesketh had <b>become</b> <b>aware</b> {{of the lack}} of resorts in Lancashire. He was {{concerned}} that the working classes of Lancashire could not afford to travel south for their holidays as wealthy people like him could. The number of railways in Great Britain steadily increased {{in the first half of}} the 19th century, and Hesketh was impressed by the arrival in 1828 of the steam locomotive in Lancashire. As High Sheriff of Lancashire, he attended the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway on 15 December 1830. The event filled him with great excitement at the idea of bringing the railway to the coast and enabling Lancashire mill workers to take day-trips to the seaside.|$|E
5|$|Bob {{has been}} fooled by Jeanie's lies {{about why they}} are not going out, and is enlightened when Sidney lets slip that Larry and Jeanie are seeing each other. Bob demands proof, and Sidney tells Bob to watch what happens in the wings during the {{upcoming}} Act 1 finale to Me and Juliet. Bob sees Larry and Jeanie kiss after she comes offstage with a tray of flowers, an action caught by Bob's spotlight. Mac enters, grasps the situation, sends Larry away, then puts the tray back in Jeanie's hands and pushes her onstage. She is pursued by Bob's spotlight, which relentlessly follows her around the stage as {{more and more of the}} dancers <b>become</b> <b>aware</b> something has gone badly wrong. Bob drops a sandbag from the light bridge; it knocks the tray Jeanie is holding to the ground. Mac orders the curtain lowered in front of a stage in panic.|$|E
5|$|He spreads poison {{and kills}} much {{livestock}} and many Frenchmen {{to prepare for}} an uprising, but is forced into exile as the French <b>become</b> <b>aware</b> of his actions and begin to search for him. He returns after four years, but is captured and tied to a post to be lashed and burned {{in front of a}} massive black audience. While tied to the post, he metamorphoses into an insect and flies overhead before landing in the crowds. During the ensuing pandemonium he is again captured by ten men and burned in the fire. The slaves are certain that he has been saved and remain in defiant and jubilant spirits. The memory of Macandal is not extinguished in the flames. Ti Noel tells his children the stories he was told by Macandal, and they await his return many years later.|$|E

5|$|Manstein {{took part}} in a conference on 22 August 1939 where Hitler {{underlined}} to his commanders the need for the physical destruction of Poland as a nation. After the war, he would state in his memoirs that he did not recognise {{at the time of this}} meeting that Hitler was going to pursue a policy of extermination against the Poles. He did <b>become</b> <b>aware</b> of the policy later on, as he and other Wehrmacht generals received reports on the activities of the Einsatzgruppen, the Schutzstaffel (SS) death squads tasked with following the army into Poland to kill intellectuals and other civilians. These squads were also assigned to round up Jews and others for relocation to ghettos and Nazi concentration camps. Manstein later faced three charges of war crimes relating to Jewish and civilian deaths in the sectors under his control, and the mistreatment and deaths of prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|Many {{people with}} TS {{may not realize}} they have tics; because tics are more {{commonly}} expressed in private, TS may go unrecognized or undetected. It {{is not uncommon for}} the parents of affected children to be unaware that they, too, may have had tics as children. Because Tourette's tends to subside with maturity, and because milder cases of Tourette's are now more likely to be recognized, the first realization that a parent had tics as a child may not come until their offspring is diagnosed. It is not uncommon for several members of a family to be diagnosed together, as parents bringing children to a physician for an evaluation of tics <b>become</b> <b>aware</b> that they, too, had tics as a child.|$|E
5|$|Not {{only does}} SCI present {{children}} and adolescents {{with many of the}} same difficulties adults face, it affects the development of their sexuality. Although substantial research exists on SCI and sexuality in adults, very little exists on the ways in which it affects development of sexuality in young people. Injured {{children and adolescents}} need ongoing, age-appropriate sex education that addresses questions of SCI as it relates to sexuality and sexual function. Very young children <b>become</b> <b>aware</b> of their disabilities before their sexuality, but as they age they become curious just as able-bodied children do, and it is appropriate to provide them with increasing amounts of information. Caregivers help the child and family prepare for transition into adulthood, including in sexuality and social interaction, beginning early and intensifying during adolescence. Parents need education about the effects of SCI on sexual function so that they can answer their children's questions.|$|E

5|$|On {{the day of}} the robbery, 26 June 1907, the 20 organizers, {{including}} Stalin, met near Yerevan Square (just 2 {{minutes from}} the seminary, bank and viceroy's palace) to finalize their plans, and after the meeting, they went to their designated places in preparation for the attack. The Russian authorities had <b>become</b> <b>aware</b> that some large action was being planned by revolutionaries in Tiflis, and had increased the security presence in the main square; just prior to the robbery, they had been tipped off and were guarding every street corner in Yerevan Square. To deal with the increased security, gang members spotted patrolling gendarmes and police prior to the robbery and lookouts were posted looking down on the square from above.|$|E
5|$|One of Frederick III's bodyguards, Statius, {{traveled}} to Scania {{to organize the}} peasants into Snapphane units and instigate anti-Swedish sentiment. In Malmö, a cabal of rich bourgeoisie, led by Bartholomaeus Mikkelsen, planned a revolt. The conspiracy tried to recruit one of Malmös two mayors, Efvert Wiltfang, {{but he would not}} commit himself to the uprising, even though he said he would support Frederick III. At the end of December, the Danes embarked on a foray into Scania, but were foiled by bad weather and poor navigation. Meanwhile, the Swedish authorities had <b>become</b> <b>aware</b> of the plot and the main leaders were arrested, among them Mikkelsen and Wildfang, and the conspirators were sentenced to death. On December 22, 1659 Mikkelsen and two others were beheaded, but in an attempt to placate the Scanian people the execution of Wiltfang and 10 others was stayed. The uprising had been averted, but rebels and insurgents continued to operate in the countryside.|$|E
5|$|Raëlism (also {{known as}} Raëlianism or the Raëlian movement) is a UFO {{religion}} that {{was founded in}} 1974 by Claude Vorilhon (b. 1946), now known as Raël. The Raëlian Movement teaches that life on Earth was scientifically created by a species of extraterrestrials, which they call the Elohim. Members of this species appeared human when having personal contacts with {{the descendants of the}} humans that they made. They purposefully misinformed early humanity that they were angels, cherubim, or gods. Raëlians believe that messengers, or prophets, of the Elohim include Buddha, Jesus, and others who informed humans of each era. The founder of Raëlism received the final message of the Elohim and that its purpose is to inform the world about Elohim and that if humans <b>become</b> <b>aware</b> and peaceful enough, they wish to be welcomed by them.|$|E
