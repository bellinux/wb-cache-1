40|$|BackgroundPulmonary metastasectomy is a {{standard}} method for treatment of selected pulmonary metastases cases. Nevertheless, because prognosis for patients with lung metastases from esophageal cancer who have undergone pulmonary metastasectomy is poor, candidates for this method of treatment are rare. Therefore, the efficacy of surgical treatment for pulmonary metastatic lesions from esophageal cancer has not been thoroughly examined. MethodsBetween March 1984 and May 2006, 57 patients underwent resection of pulmonary metastases from primary esophageal cancer. These cases were registered in the database developed by the Metastatic Lung Tumor Study Group of Japan and were retrospectively reviewed from the registry. After excluding eight cases <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>missing</b> <b>information,</b> we reviewed the remaining 49 cases and examined the prognostic factors for pulmonary metastasectomy for metastases from esophageal cancer. ResultsThere were no perioperative deaths. After pulmonary metastasectomy, disease recurred in 16 (33 %) of the 49 patients. The overall 5 -year survival was 29. 6 %. Median survival time was 18 months. The survival of patients with a disease-free interval (DFI) less than 12 months was significantly lower than patients with a DFI greater than 12 months. Through multivariate analysis, we identified DFI as a clinical factor significantly related to overall survival (p = 0. 04). ConclusionsWe identified that patients with a DFI less than 12 months who underwent pulmonary metastasectomy for metastases from esophageal cancer had a worse prognosis. Pulmonary metastasectomy for esophageal cancer should be considered for selected patients with a DFI ≥ 12 months...|$|E

ET image reconstruction can be considered an ill-posed problem <b>because</b> <b>of</b> this <b>missing</b> <b>information.</b> This results in artifacts, seen as the loss of three-dimensional (3 D) resolution in the reconstructed images. The goal {{of this study was to}} achieve isotropic resolution with a statistical reconstruction method, sequential maximum a posteriori expectation maximization (sMAP-EM), using no prior morphological knowledge about the specimen. The missing wedge effects on sMAP-EM were examined with a synthetic cell phantom to assess the effects of noise.

An ellipsoid fitting based method was developed to realize the quantitative measures elongation and contrast in an automated, objective, and reliable way.

40|$|Objectives: Due to {{the lack}} of {{paediatric}} licensed formulations, children are often treated with individualized pharmacy-compounded adult medication. An international web-based survey about the types of medication in children with adrenal insufficiency (AI) revealed that the majority of paediatric physicians are using pharmacy-compounded medication to treat children with AI. Observations of loss of therapy control in children with congenital adrenal hyperplasia with compounded hydrocortisone capsules and regained control after prescribing a new hydrocortisone batch led to this "real world" evaluation of pharmacy-compounded paediatric hydrocortisone capsules. Methods: Capsule samples were collected randomly from volunteering parents of treated children suffering from congenital adrenal hyperplasia from all over Germany. Analysis of net mass and hydrocortisone content by HPLC-UV (high performance liquid chromatography) method were performed based on the European Pharmacopeia. Results: In total 61 batches were sent in. 5 batches could not be analyzed <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>missing</b> dose <b>information,</b> insufficient number of capsules or were not possible to be evaluated. 56 batches containing 1125 capsules were evaluated. 21. 4 % of the batches revealed insufficiency in uniformity of net mass or drug content and additional 3. 6 % failed because they did not contain the labelled drug. Conclusions: Compounded medication is a possible cause of variation of steroid doses in children with adrenal insufficiency or congenital adrenal hyperplasia, putting these vulnerable patients at risk of poor disease control and adrenal crisis.

40|$|Recycling and {{recovery}} {{of materials and}} energy from waste is a key factor to mitigate virgin material demands and reduce resource consumption by utilising waste {{as a resource for}} new products. However, some critical materials, such as neodymium, are barely recycled <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>missing</b> <b>information</b> on amount and disposition of these critical materials within the waste streams. The goal of the study is to quantify recycling potentials from small and electric motors originating from end-of-life vehicles (ELV), electric bicycles and industrial machinery in Germany and the EU with focus on currently lost rare earth elements. Furthermore, innovative approaches to improve recycling of these motors shall be investigated. Therefore, a calculation model to predict current and future waste streams and the incorporated recycling potentials has been developed. The results show an increasing trend of recycling potentials from small and electric motors for all waste streams. The recycling potential of neodymium is estimated at a range of 150 t to 240 t in 2020 in Germany. However, data inaccuracy and the calculation model are likely to cause overestimation of actually available recycling potential and have to be interpreted carefully. In conclusion, disassembly of small and electric motors from ELV and electric bicycles in combination with a subsequent specific recycling process has been identified as promising to improve utilisation of the recycling potentials of rare earth elements from small and electric motors. However, in case recycling quotas are the prior goal of improvement, the application and further optimisation of post shredder technology is more relevant. ...|$|E

Methods: We examined data on 37, 352 adult pre-ART patients (ART ineligible or unknown eligibility) who enrolled in care during 2005 - 2008 with > 1 clinical visit at 23 clinics in Mozambique. We defined loss to clinic (LTC) as > 12 months since the last visit among those not known to have died/transferred. Cox proportional-hazards models were used to examine factors associated with LTC, accounting for clustering within sites. Results: Of 37, 352 pre-ART patients, 61 % had a CD 4 count within three months of enrolment (median CD 4 : 452, IQR: 345 - 611). 17, 598 (47. 1 %) were ART ineligible and 19, 754 (52. 9 %) were of unknown eligibility status at enrolment <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>missing</b> <b>information</b> on CD 4 count and/or WHO stage. Kaplan-Meier estimates for LTC at 12 months were 41 % (95 % CI: 40. 2 - 41. 8) and 48 % (95 % CI: 47. 2 - 48. 8), respectively. Factors associated with LTC among ART ineligible patients included male sex (AHRmen_vs_non-pregnant women: 1. 5; 95 % CI: 1. 4 - 1. 6) and being pregnant at enrolment (AHRpregnant_vs_non-pregnant women: 1. 3; 95 % CI: 1. 1 - 1. 5). Older age, more education, higher weight and more advanced WHO stage at enrolment were independently associated with lower risks of LTC. Similar findings were observed among patients whose ART eligibility status was unknown at enrolment. Conclusions: Substantial LTC occurred prior to ART initiation among patients not yet known {{to be eligible for}} ART, including nearly half of patients without documented ART eligibility assessment. Interventions are needed to target pre-ART patients who may be at higher risk for LTC, including pregnant women and patients with less advanced HIV disease...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} an ITT analysis in a randomized clinical trial. Due to (study) drop-outs, standard methods are not applicable and simple imputation methods like LOCF (last observation carried forward) may lead to biased results. Since a patient who drops out of the study often will also change or drop the assigned treatment, an "ignorable" analysis {{in the sense of}} Rubin (1976) assuming MAR (missing at random), as e. g. a propensity weighted analysis or a likelihood based MAR-analysis is not valid. This {{is due to the fact}} that <b>information</b> is <b>missing</b> about outcomes as well as the covariate treatment after drop-out. That is, even if the drop-out process itself is ignorable, we can not treat the problem as ignorable <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the <b>missing</b> covariate <b>information.</b> We follow the path given by Little and Yau (1996), who created multiple imputations under various assumptions about the actual treatment after drop-out, and conduct a simulation study on the alpha-error and power of simple endpoint tests. This should also shed light onto the problem whether the true treatment effect can be sensibly bracketed by assumptions like zero dose or continuing dose after drop-out. ...|$|R
40|$|Some {{individuals}} {{die before}} a trait is measured or expressed (the invisible fraction), and some relevant traits are not measured in any individual (missing traits). This paper discusses how these concepts can be cast in terms <b>of</b> <b>missing</b> data problems from statistics. Using missing data theory, I show formally {{the conditions under}} which a valid evolutionary inference is possible when the invisible fraction and/or missing traits are ignored. These conditions are restrictive and unlikely to be met in even the most comprehensive long-term studies. When these conditions are not met, many selection and quantitative genetic parameters cannot be estimated accurately unless the missing data process is explicitly modelled. Surprisingly, this {{does not seem to have}} been attempted in evolutionary biology. In the case of the invisible fraction, viability selection and the missing data process are often intimately linked. In such cases, models used in survival analysis can be extended to provide a flexible and justified model <b>of</b> the <b>missing</b> data mechanism. Although missing traits pose a more difficult problem, important biological parameters can still be estimated without bias when appropriate techniques are used. This is in contrast to current methods which have large biases and poor precision. Generally, the quantitative genetic approach is shown to be superior to phenotypic studies of selection when invisible fractions or missing traits exist <b>because</b> part <b>of</b> the <b>missing</b> <b>information</b> can be recovered from relatives...|$|R

However, up to know only grey-scale Corona satellite images from the 1960 s with a resolution of 2 x 2 m and recent multi-spectral LandSat images with a resolution of 30 x 30 m were available for this region. Both are not useable for the desired classification <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>missing</b> spectral <b>information</b> and inadequate resolution, respectively. During the Lena 2003 expedition, a survey of the island by air photography was carried out in order to obtain images for surface classification. The photographs were taken from a helicopter on 10. 07. 2002, using a Canon EOS 100 reflex camera, a Soligor 19 - 23 mm lens and colour slide film. The height from which the photographs were taken was approximately 600 meters. Due to limited flight time, not all the area of the island could be photographed and some regions could only be photographed with a slanted view. As a result, the images are of a varying quality and resolution. In Potsdam, after processing the films were scanned using a Nikon LS- 2000 scanner at maximal resolution setting. This resulted in a ground resolution of the scanned images of approximately 0. 3 x 0. 3 m. The images were subsequently geo-referenced using the ENVI software and a referenced Corona image dating from 18. 07. 1964 (Spott, 2003). Geo-referencing was only possible for the Holocene river terrace areas; the floodplain regions in the western part of the island could not be referenced due to the lack of ground reference points. In Figure 3. 7 - 1, the aerial view of Samoylov Island composed of the geo-referenced images is shown. Further work is necessary for the classification and interpretation of the images.
