5|$|In his {{biography}} of Christopher Columbus, Irving introduced the erroneous idea that Europeans believed {{the world to}} <b>be</b> <b>flat</b> prior {{to the discovery of}} the New World. Borrowed from Irving, the flat-Earth myth has been taught in schools as fact to many generations of Americans.|$|E
5|$|The {{flatness}} problem (also {{known as}} the oldness problem) is an observational problem associated with a Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric (FLRW). The universe may have positive, negative, or zero spatial curvature depending on its total energy density. Curvature is negative, if its density {{is less than the}} critical density; positive, if greater; and zero at the critical density, in which case space is said to <b>be</b> <b>flat.</b>|$|E
5|$|The curve-billed {{breeding}} season begins in February and reaches an apex between March and May; however, new fledglings {{have been recorded}} as late as August. Dates vary within its range due to temperature and rainfall. Nests are generally built at conspicuous locations, the cholla being favored. Other potential nesting sites range from mesquite, prickly pear or yucca to the occasional oak and pine trees. The nest is generally a deep cup but can <b>be</b> <b>flat</b> with a depression for the eggs. The outer layer consists of thorny twigs while the inner layer includes smooth sticks, roots, coarse and fine grasses, rootlets or hair.|$|E
5000|$|Assume that f : X &rarr; Y and g : Y &rarr; Z are morphisms of schemes. Assume {{furthermore}} that f <b>is</b> <b>flat</b> at x in X. Then g <b>is</b> <b>flat</b> at f(x) if {{and only}} if gf <b>is</b> <b>flat</b> at x. [...] In particular, if f <b>is</b> faithfully <b>flat,</b> then g <b>is</b> <b>flat</b> or faithfully flat if {{and only if}} gf <b>is</b> <b>flat</b> or faithfully flat, respectively.|$|R
5000|$|Suppose B <b>is</b> <b>flat.</b> Then the {{sequence}} is pure exact if {{and only if}} C <b>is</b> <b>flat.</b> From this one can deduce that pure submodules of <b>flat</b> modules <b>are</b> <b>flat.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{platform}} {{between the}} implant and the abutment can <b>be</b> <b>flat</b> (buttress) or conical fit. In conical fit abutments, {{the collar of}} the abutment sits inside the implant which allows a stronger junction between implant and abutment and a better seal against bacteria into the implant body. To improve the gingival seal around the abutment collar, a narrowed collar on the abutment is used, referred to as platform switching. The combination of conical fits and platform switching gives marginally better long term periodontal conditions compared to flat-top abutments.|$|E
5|$|Fruit : A capsule that {{is usually}} loculicidal (splitting along the locules) as in the Lilioideae, but {{occasionally}} septicidal (splitting between them, along the separating septa) in the Calachortoideae and wind dispersed, although the Medeoleae form berries (baccate). The seeds may <b>be</b> <b>flat,</b> oblong, angular, , ellipsoid or globose (spherical), or compressed with a well developed epidermis. The exterior may be smooth or roughened, with a wing or raphe (ridge), aril or one to two tails, rarely hairy, but may be dull or shiny {{and the lack of}} a black integument distinguishes them from related taxa such as Allioideae that were previously included in this family, and striate (parallel longitudinally ridged) in the Steptopoideae. The hilum (scar) is generally inconspicuous. The bitegmic (separate testa and tegmen) seed coat itself may be thin, suberose (like cork), or crustaceous (hard or brittle). The endosperm is abundant, cartilaginous (fleshy) or horny and contains oils and aleurone but not starch (non-farinaceous). Its cells are polyploid (triploid or pentaploid, depending on the embryo sac type). The embryo is small (usually less than one quarter of seed volume), axile (radially sectioned), linear (longer than broad) or rarely rudimentary (tiny relative to endosperm) depending on placentation type, and straight, bent, curved or curled at the upper end.|$|E
5|$|The Florida {{peninsula}} appeared {{above sea}} level between 100,000 and 150,000years ago. As sea levels rose {{at the end of}} the Wisconsin ice age, the water table appeared closer to land. Lake Okeechobee began to flood and convection thunderstorms were created. Vast peat deposits south of Lake Okeechobee indicate that regular flooding had occurred about 5,000 years ago. Plants began to migrate, subtropical ones from the northern part of Florida, and tropicals carried as seeds by birds from islands in the Caribbean. The limestone shelf appears to <b>be</b> <b>flat,</b> but there are slight rises—called pinnacles—and depressions caused by the erosion of limestone by the acidic properties of the water. The amount of time throughout the year that water is present in a location in the Everglades determines the type of soil, of which there only two in the Everglades: peat, created by many years of decomposing plant matter, and marl, the result of dried periphyton, or chunks of algae and microorganisms that create a grayish mud. Portions of the Everglades that remain flooded for more than nine months out of the year are usually covered by peat. Areas that are flooded six months or less are covered by marl. Plant communities are determined by the type of soil and amount of water present.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} {{designed}} by series creator Koichi Ishii, directed by veteran Square designer Hiromichi Tanaka, and produced by Tetsuhisa Tsuruzono. Artwork was produced by manga and anime artist Nobuteru Yūki, while the music was composed by Secret of Mana composer Hiroki Kikuta. Although the game was only published in Japan, English-speaking players {{have been able to}} play Seiken Densetsu 3 due to an unofficial English fan translation, first released in 2000. Seiken Densetsu 3 received considerable acclaim from reviewers, who praised the graphics as among the best ever made for the Super Famicom and the gameplay as an improved version of its predecessor's. The plot received mixed reviews by critics, who found the overlapping stories to be interesting and to enhance replayability, but the characters and plotlines themselves to <b>be</b> <b>flat</b> and clichéd. Overall, the game is considered by some critics to be a Super Famicom classic {{and one of the best}} role-playing games of the 16-bit era.|$|E
5|$|The {{ultimate}} {{fate of the}} Universe {{is still}} unknown, because it depends critically on the curvature index k and the cosmological constant Λ. If the Universe were sufficiently dense, k would equal +1, meaning that its average curvature throughout is positive and the Universe will eventually recollapse in a Big Crunch, possibly starting a new Universe in a Big Bounce. Conversely, if the Universe were insufficiently dense, k would equal 0 or −1 and the Universe would expand forever, cooling off and eventually reaching the Big Freeze and the heat death of the Universe. Modern data suggests {{that the rate of}} expansion of the Universe is not decreasing, as originally expected, but increasing; if this continues indefinitely, the Universe may eventually reach a Big Rip. Observationally, the Universe appears to <b>be</b> <b>flat</b> (k = 0), with an overall density that is very close to the critical value between recollapse and eternal expansion.|$|E
