50|$|There {{is still}} a room for {{discussion}} whether the rolling element excites the natural frequencies of bearing component when it passes the fault on the outer race. Hence we need to identify the <b>bearing</b> <b>outer</b> <b>race</b> natural frequency and its harmonics. The bearing faults create impulses and results in strong harmonics of the fault frequencies in the spectrum of vibration signals. These fault frequencies are sometimes masked by adjacent frequencies in the spectra due to their little energy. Hence, a very high spectral resolution is often needed to identify these frequencies during a FFT analysis. The natural frequencies of a rolling element bearing with the free boundary conditions are 3 kHz. Therefore, {{in order to use}} the bearing component resonance bandwidth method to detect the bearing fault at an initial stage a high frequency range accelerometer should be adopted, and data obtained from a long duration needs to be acquired. A fault characteristic frequency can only be identified when the fault extent is severe, such as that of a presence of a hole in the outer race. The harmonics of fault frequency is a more sensitive indicator of a <b>bearing</b> <b>outer</b> <b>race</b> fault. For a more serious detection of defected bearing faults waveform, spectrum and envelope techniques will help reveal these faults. However, if a high frequency demodulation is used in the envelope analysis in order to detect bearing fault characteristic frequencies, the maintenance professionals have to be more careful in the analysis because of resonance, as {{it may or may not}} contain fault frequency components.|$|E

40|$|The {{short time}} Fourier {{transform}} time-frequency representation (STFT-TFR) method degenerates, {{and the corresponding}} short time Fourier transform time-frequency filtering (STFT-TFF) method fails under α stable distribution noise environment. A fractional low order short time Fourier transform (FLOSTFT) which takes advantage of fractional p order moment is proposed for α stable distribution noise environment, and the corresponding FLOSTFT time-frequency representation (FLOSTFT-TFR) algorithm is presented in this paper. We study vector formulation of the FLOSTFT and inverse FLOSTFT (IFLOSTFT) methods and propose a FLOSTFT time-frequency filtering (FLOSTFT-TFF) method which takes advantage of time-frequency localized spectra of the signal in time-frequency domain. The simulation results show that, employing the FLOSTFT-TFR method and the FLOSTFT-TFF method with an adaptive weight function, time-frequency distribution of the signals can be better gotten and time-frequency localized region of the signal can be effectively extracted from α stable distribution noise, and also the original signal can be restored employing the IFLOSTFT method. Their performances are better than the STFT-TFR and STFT-TFF methods, and MSEs are smaller in different α and GSNR cases. Finally, we apply the FLOSTFT-TFR and FLOSTFT-TFF methods to extract fault features of the <b>bearing</b> <b>outer</b> <b>race</b> fault signal and restore the original fault signal from α stable distribution noise; the experimental results illustrate their performances...|$|E
40|$|An image {{dimensionality}} reduction {{method for}} rolling bearing fault diagnosis based on singular value decomposition Yi Wang 1, Dan Liu 1, Guanghua Xu 1, 2 and Kuosheng Jiang 1 The fast kurtogram, a faint signal extraction method, has {{been regarded as}} an effective approach to detect and characterize faint transient features in vibration signals. However, the fast kurtogram, a band-pass filtering method, which extracts transient signals by optimal frequency band selection and leaves the noise in the selected frequency band unprocessed. Therefore, to overcome the shortcoming of the fast kurtogram method, a method which can wipe off the noise in the whole frequency band is necessary. This paper proposes a novel faint signal extraction method by time– frequency distribution image dimensionality reduction. Since time–frequency distribution image can reveal intrinsic fea-ture of nonstationary signals and can make the weak impulses feature prominent, and besides, the transient impulse feature and the noise component lie in different dimensions, so using the dimensionality reduction method based on singular value decomposition to suppress the background noise in the raw time–frequency distribution image is moti-vated. A <b>bearing</b> <b>outer</b> <b>race</b> fault signal obtained from a test-to-failure experiment and a bearing inner race fault signal obtained from an experimental motor are employed to demonstrate the enhanced performance of the proposed method in faint signal extraction.

40|$|In view of {{the problem}} that the fault signal of the rolling bearing is weak and the fault feature is {{difficult}} to extract in the strong noise environment, a method based on minimum entropy deconvolution (MED) and local mean deconvolution (LMD) is proposed to extract the weak fault features of the rolling bearing. Through {{the analysis of the}} simulation signal, we find that LMD has many limitations for the feature extraction of weak signals under strong background noise. In order to eliminate the noise interference and extract the characteristics of the weak fault, MED is employed as the pre-filter to remove noise. This method is applied to the weak fault feature extraction of rolling bearings; that is, using MED to reduce the noise of the wind turbine gearbox test bench under strong background noise, and then using the LMD method to decompose the denoised signals into several product functions (PFs), and finally analyzing the PF components that have strong correlation by a cyclic autocorrelation function. The finding is that the failure of the wind power gearbox is generated from the micro-bending of the high-speed shaft and the pitting of the # 10 <b>bearing</b> <b>outer</b> <b>race</b> at the output end of the high-speed shaft. This method is compared with LMD, which shows the effectiveness of this method. This paper provides a new method for the extraction of multiple faults and weak features in strong background noise...|$|E

To practically test this technique, an experimental setup was designed and fabricated for testing various tapered roller bearings to obtain their vibration characteristics. For the purpose of testing, a few defect-free and defective tapered roller bearings were tested using the fabricated set up-the defective bearings tested included <b>bearings</b> with <b>outer</b> <b>race</b> defects, roller defects and combination of both.

40|$|Due to the fast-rising voltage {{pulses of}} pulse width {{modulated}} drives, the generated shaft voltage of electrical motors causes electrical discharge currents in bearings. These discharges can cause bearing failure leading to costly maintenance and unexpected production stops. To eliminate the raised shaft voltage, several techniques are used such as shaft grounding brushes, insulated bearings and conductive grease. The possibility to measure discharge activity on a PWM driven induction motor offers {{a tool for}} researchers to test different bearings in electric motors. In order to measure the shaft voltages and bearing currents, modifications of an induction motor are made firstly using 3 D software {{and then on the}} physical motor. By insulating the bearing from the frame and attaching a copper ring to the <b>bearings</b> <b>outer</b> <b>race</b> <b>bearing</b> currents can be measured. The combined measurements of shaft voltage, bearing currents and frame currents shows the bearings conductive states at low speed, and insulated state at higher speed. Electrical discharge activity (DA) is observed as shaft voltage raises, resulting in a bearing current spike and shaft voltage drops rapidly while stator current is unaffected. Experimental tests were performed with a sample bearing at different operating conditions, such as operating speed, temperature, motor load, etc., to determine the effect of the common mode voltages on bearing currents and shaft voltages. At low temperatures between 23 - 26 ˚C and motor speeds above 1000 rpm EDM currents were observed. On temperatures above 40 ˚C no major EDM currents were observed regardless of rpm due to the bearing remaining in an ohmic conductive state. The modifications of the motor have shown to give reliable bearing current and shaft voltage measurements that can help in future research in this area...|$|R
40|$|Induction motors (IMs) are {{commonly}} used in both industrial applications and household appliances. An IM online condition monitoring system is very useful to identify the IM fault at its initial stage, {{in order to prevent}} machinery malfunction, decreased productivity and even catastrophic failures. Although a series of research efforts have been conducted over decades for IM fault diagnosis using various approaches, it still remains a challenging task to accurately diagnose the IM fault due to the complex signal transmission path and environmental noise. The objective of this thesis is to develop a novel intelligent system for more reliable IM health condition monitoring. The developed intelligent monitor consists of two stages: feature extraction and decision-making. In feature extraction, a spectrum synch technique is proposed to extract representative features from collected stator current signals for fault detection in IM systems. The local bands related to IM health conditions are synchronized to enhance fault characteristic features; a central kurtosis method is suggested to extract representative information from the resulting spectrum and to formulate an index for fault diagnosis. In diagnostic pattern classification, an innovative selective boosting technique is proposed to effectively classify representative features into different IM health condition categories. On the other hand, IM health conditions can also be predicted by applying appropriate prognostic schemes. In system state forecasting, two forecasting techniques, a model-based pBoost predictor and a data-driven evolving fuzzy neural predictor, are proposed to forecast future states of the fault indices, which can be employed to further improve the accuracy of IM health condition monitoring. A novel fuzzy inference system is developed to integrate information from both the classifier and the predictor for IM health condition monitoring. The effectiveness of the proposed techniques and integrated monitor is verified through simulations and experimental tests corresponding to different IM states such as IMs with broken rotor bars and with the <b>bearing</b> <b>outer</b> <b>race</b> defect. The developed techniques, the selective boosting classifier, pBoost predictor and evolving fuzzy neural predictor, are effective tools that can be employed in a much wider range of applications. In order to select the most reliable technique in each processing module so as to provide a more positive assessment of IM health conditions, some more techniques are also proposed for each processing purpose. A conjugate Levebnerg-Marquardt method and a Laplace particle swarm technique are proposed for model parameter training, whereas a mutated particle filter technique is developed for system state prediction. These strong tools developed in this work could also be applied to fault diagnosis and other applications...|$|E

Minor {{and random}} slip between rolling {{elements}} and races in rolling element bearings makes vibration signals have periodically time-varying ensemble statistics, {{which is known}} as cyclostationarity. Two second-order cyclostationary methods, the spectral correlation density (SCD) {{and the degree of}} cyclostationarity (DCS), are talked about in this paper based on a statistical model of rolling element bearings. The SCD provides redundant information in bi-frequency plane and cyclic frequency domain embodies the majority of it, which is a series of non-zero discrete cyclic frequencies completely reflecting the fault characters of rolling element bearings.

Examination revealed damages to all {{components of}} the assembly to various extents. The starboard bearing was severely damaged and the <b>outer</b> <b>race</b> had cracked. Correspondingly, the orifice of the starboard half of the hub was also severely damaged and it got enlarged.
