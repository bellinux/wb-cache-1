Club {{gave the}} episode a B-, saying [...] "It’s {{not a very}} funny episode, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> sense that the animators enjoyed getting out of Springfield, and the score for the Iceland scenes, by indie rock group Sigur Ros, {{is at least a}} welcome change from the old-timey music that the show has been inexplicably fond of this season." ...|$|E
5000|$|No Ripcord wrote [...] "Tomorrow's World isn't a bad album but it's not a {{complete}} 'return to form' either. Its strength is having enough {{of a sense of}} songcraft to add weight to the keening, theatrical melodrama of Andy Bell's vocals. The production definitely gives their sound more currency, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> impression that Erasure are a bit late to the party - ironic when you consider how long they've been around. Aside from the choice of producer, there isn't {{much in the way of}} surprises because this is basically an updated take on how you’d expect an Erasure record to sound: accessible songs, flamboyant vocals and fizzing synths." ...|$|E

5000|$|Kramnik has {{significantly}} shaped opening theory in chess. Viswanathan Anand has said {{of him in}} 2012: [...] "I don't know exactly how many lines he's established, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> impression {{that for the last}} 10 years we've only been using his ideas. ... His stamp on opening theory is much more significant than mine." [...] Kramnik's results with the white pieces against the King's Indian Defence made Kasparov drop the opening from his repertoire, and caused the opening to disappear from top-level play for many years. Kramnik's use of the Berlin Defence in his 2000 match against Kasparov led to a massive increase in the opening's popularity. Kramnik also revived the Catalan Opening.|$|E
5000|$|... "(I Love It When You) Call Me Names" [...] {{was written}} about {{two men in}} a band who were always arguing, and {{features}} a guitar solo by Adrian Belew. It was released as a single, though it did not chart. It subsequently became a staple of Armatrading's live performances and has appeared on many of her compilation albums. Armatrading said of the song, [...] "It's come out as {{a man and a}} woman, but I was really looking at two guys. Not two gay guys, just two guys who are friends who tend to treat each other like this, always calling each other names. There's sort of this love/hate relationship between them, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> feeling that they really enjoy this thing that they're going through." ...|$|E

I {{was president of the}} Federalist Society chapter at my law school, worked on the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal and wrote speeches for President Bush—not the [...] "Read My Lips" [...] Bush, the [...] "Axis of Evil" [...] Bush.

5000|$|In 1990, Winans signed, not to {{a gospel}} {{recording}} company but to Geffen Records. Geffen was bought by Universal Records and Winans contract was shifted to sister label MCA Records. Dealing with a company that hadnt signed her, she found herself being subtly pushed to tone down the Christian message in her music. [...] "They dont tell you, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> vibe," [...] she said in 1999. [...] "I dont ever, ever, ever {{want to be in}} that predicament again. Its one thing when you just sing a song where you dont use the actual name of Jesus, but its a whole nother thing when you TRY not to use the name. For me, the name of Jesus will never be distasteful in my mouth. Hes always the answer".|$|E
50|$|Suppose two handfuls {{are taken}} from a sack {{containing}} a genetically diverse variety of corn, and each grown under carefully controlled and standardized conditions, except that one batch is lacking in certain nutrients that are supplied to the other. After several weeks, the plants are measured. There is variability of growth within each batch, due to the genetic variability of the corn. Given that the growing conditions are closely controlled, nearly all the variation in {{the height of the}} plants within a batch will be due to differences in their genes. Thus, within populations, heritabilities will be very high. Nevertheless, {{the difference between the two}} groups is due entirely to an environmental factor—differential nutrition. Lewontin didn't go so far as to have the one set of pots painted white and the other set black, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> idea. The point of the example, in any case, is that the causes of between-group differences may in principle be quite different from the causes of within-group variation.|$|E
5000|$|Dani {{finds herself}} {{drawn to the}} rebellious Kane Phillips (Sam Atwell) even though {{everyone}} knows he is [...] "bad news". Sursok commented {{that there is something}} about him that fascinates Dani and she is also aware that he comes from a troubled background, but blames his brother for his behaviour. Dani and her boyfriend Will Smith start having problems in their relationship and Dani begins flirting with Kane, eventually kissing him. She feels guilty afterwards and tries to get Kane out of her head. Sursok told Inside Soap's Jason Herbison [...] "After Dani kisses Kane, she knows it's wrong and decides not to take it any further. The problem is, Kane really wants Dani, and he won't take no for an answer." [...] One day, Kane helps Dani carry some shopping home and he comes on to her. When Dani tries to stop him, Kane pins her down and sexually assaults her. Describing the scenes, Sursok stated [...] "She tries to resist, but he gets violent and forces her. You don't see what happens next, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> idea." [...] The actress explained that the censorship laws in Australia stopped producers from using the word [...] "rape", but viewers will be left in no doubt that Dani was the victim of a serious crime. Sursok told Herbison that the assault is the worst thing that has ever happened to Dani and she feels that she is somehow to blame because she did come on to Kane.|$|E

5000|$|The film {{opened with}} mixed reviews from critics. Sharika C. of The Hindu said, [...] "Forget Adaminte Makan Abu, its many laurels, the {{director}} who {{held out a}} lot of promise and watch this one without strings attached. And you may be a little less disappointed." [...] Jisha G. Nair of Malayala Manorama rated the film 3/5 and concluded her review saying, [...] "The film lags throughout, which may bore the audience. At times, the expressions of the actors and the delivery of dialogues could have been more realistic and strong to have the originality and seriousness of the issues. The last word is that the film is not a complete entertainer." [...] Paresh C Palicha of Rediff.com rated the film 2.5/5 and said, [...] "Kunjananthante Kada is a half baked story which leaves us feeling something is amiss all the time." [...] Veeyen of Nowrunning.com rated the film 2.5/5 and said, [...] "Kunjananthante Kada is a moody, character driven drama that does have its [...] share of sparkling moments. However, it falls short of being a classic on account of a sensory overload that scatters its themes all across." [...] Sify.com gave the verdict as [...] "average" [...] and commented, [...] "Kunjananthante Kada has its moments that need to be appreciated for sure, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> feeling that the viewers have been taken for granted by the makers here. It is hard not to be disappointed by this one!" [...] Contrastingly, Aswin J. Kumar of The Times of India wrote a positive review and said that Kunjananthante Kada is [...] "a film Salim Ahamed can be proud of." ...|$|E
5000|$|Bill Zwecker of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film {{three out of}} four stars, saying [...] "Planes: Fire & Rescue is a good {{improvement}} over Planes, which Disney released last year. The story is stronger, there are some wonderful additions to the voice talent and the 3D cinematography is well-utilized." [...] James Rocchi of The Wrap gave the film {{three out of four}} stars, saying [...] "As it is in the merchandising aisle, so it is on the big screen: Planes: Fire and Rescue is precisely long, competent, and entertaining enough to be sold, and sold well." [...] David Hiltbrand of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film one and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "The animation in Planes: Fire & Rescue is considerably better, the landscapes grander, and the 3-D flight and firefighting scenes more exciting. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> same lame puns wedged into a succession of situations, rather than a story." [...] Jordan Hoffman of the New York Daily News gave the film two out of five stars, saying [...] "The meek action plays to the under-10 crowd, but the groaner puns will play only to masochists. Meanwhile, the 3-D ticket upcharge here is a big ripoff - the extra dimension is unnecessary." [...] Lisa Kennedy of The Denver Post gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "Vivid and folksy, Fire & Rescue nicely exceeds expectations dampened by last summer's stalled-out Planes." [...] Catherine Bray of Time Out gave the film one out of five stars, saying [...] "Displaying a weird lack of memorable or endearing characters, this animated effort feels more like a direct-to-video job from the 1990s than a fully fledged John Lasseter-exec-produced theatrical release." ...|$|E

That excuses everything. Let me make this clear, if a diver gets bent it is his or her fault! Not only should they suffer the pain and inconvenience and cost of the injury, they should be fined! (well, not really, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> idea). The boat owner should be able to demand compensation!
