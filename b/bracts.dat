5|$|Around {{the disc}} is an {{involucre}} of modified leaves, the <b>bracts,</b> which in Xerochrysum, {{as in most}} Gnaphalieae, are petal-like, stiff, and papery. Arranged in rows, these <b>bracts</b> curl over and enclose the florets, shielding them before flowering. They create {{the impression of a}} shiny and yellow corolla around the disc. The intermediate <b>bracts</b> are sometimes white, while the outer ones are paler and often streaked reddish or brown (a greater variety of colours are found in cultivars). These <b>bracts</b> are papery and dry, or 'scarious', with a low water content, unlike leaves or flower parts of other plants. They are made up of dead cells, which are unusual in that they have a thin primary and a thick secondary cell wall, a feature only found in sclerenchyma, or structural, cells, not cells of flowers or leaves.|$|E
5|$|Likewise, the sticky, {{modified}} <b>bracts</b> of Passiflora foetida {{have been}} investigated for their carnivorous ability. A 1995 paper published in the Journal of Biosciences detailed {{the evidence that the}} glandular <b>bracts</b> played a distinct role in defense of the flower and were also capable of digesting captured prey and absorbing the nutrients.|$|E

40|$|Narrow and {{twisting}} flower <b>bract</b> exists {{in addition to}} normal broad <b>bract</b> in cotton germplasm which has been named as frego <b>bract.</b> In this <b>bract</b> type, bracteole is reduced; hence do not provide shelter to eggs/nymphs of insects and {{has been reported to}} provide resistance against some insect pests like bollworms and boll weevil. Inheritance of this trait was studied by crossing normal and frego <b>bract</b> genotypes. In the F 2 population normal <b>bract</b> and frego <b>bract</b> plants were in the ratio of 3 : 1 showing monogenic inheritance of the trait, frego <b>bract</b> being recessive. The test cross ratio of 1 : 1 confirmed the monogenic inheritance. The F 2 population was used to study linkage relationship of frego <b>bract</b> with fibre (staple length, fibre fineness, fibre strength) and seed traits (ginning out turn, seed index and seed volume). There was positive correlation of <b>bract</b> type with fibre strength (normal <b>bract</b> allele and alleles for strong fibre seemed {{to be on the same}} chromosome). The absence of correlation of the gene for frego <b>bract</b> with the other traits, shows that it segregates independently in relation to those traits. Hence frego <b>bract</b> type plants may be tailored with good combination of agronomic traits...|$|R
40|$|Purified aqueous {{extracts}} {{of cotton}} <b>bract</b> induce acute airway constriction in healthy volunteers never before exposed to cotton <b>bract.</b> The response {{is similar to}} that of textile workers who inhale cotton dust. Approximately 60 % of volunteers respond to <b>bract</b> extract with significant decreases in lung function, and these volunteers show an increased number of lymphocytes present in their lungs. Following inhalation of <b>bract,</b> the percent of polymorphonuclear leukocytes increases. Macrophages obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage from volunteers pre-challenged with <b>bract</b> extract release increased amounts of chemotactic factor and superoxide anion. Efforts to detect release of histamine and leukotrienes in volunteers following challenge with <b>bract</b> show no increase in urinary histamine and no significant release of leukotrienes in lung lavage fluid. Purified extracts exhibit chemotactic activity in vitro. They also contract guinea pig ileal longitudinal muscle in vitro. This preparation contains mast cells but no basophils, and the H- 1 blocker, mepyramine blocks the contraction. Purified <b>bract</b> extracts contain no histamine or endotoxin but other contractors of smooth muscle may be present. The purified extract exhibits spectral, fluorescent, and radioimmune assay properties similar to a leukotriene B-like component. Cotton <b>bract</b> appears to have direct as well as cellmediated activities...|$|R

5|$|Members of {{the family}} Apiaceae bear close {{resemblance}} to each other, and have many characteristics in common. Cicuta spp. are often mistaken for edible plants such as kvanne (Angelica archangelica), wild celery (Apium graveolens), pignut (Conopodium majus), wild carrot (Daucus carota), wild parsnip (Pastinaca sativa), and water parsnip (Berula spp.). One of the more common misidentifications is between water hemlock and water parsnip; both have clusters of small white flowers shaped like umbrellas, and both have the same habitat near the shore line of lakes and rivers. Differences between water parsnip and water hemlock include the water parsnip having leaves only once compound while the water hemlock has leaves which are {{two or three times}} compound. Water hemlock also has a large swelling at the stem base which water parsnip lacks. Additionally, water hemlock has <b>bracts</b> at the base of each small flower cluster, not {{at the base of the}} main flower head, while water parsnip has both <b>bracts</b> at the base of flowers and also at the main flower head.|$|E

5|$|In the wild, X.bracteatum can be {{distinguished}} from X.bicolor in Tasmania by its broader leaves and cobwebby hairs on the stems, and from X.macranthum in Western Australia by the flower head colour; the latter species has white flower heads whereas those of X.bracteatum are golden yellow. Xerochrysum subundulatum from alpine and subalpine areas of New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania is rhizomatous, and has markedly pointed orange <b>bracts.</b> The eastern Australian species X. viscosum may {{be distinguished}} by its rough and sticky leaves.|$|E
5|$|X. bracteatum {{had been}} {{introduced}} to cultivation in England by 1791. German horticulturist Herren Ebritsch obtained material and developed it at his nursery in Arnstadt near Erfurt in Germany. He bred and sold cultivars of many colours from bronze to white to purple, which spread across Europe in the 1850s. The <b>bracts</b> of these early forms tended to remain cupped around the flower head rather than flatten out like the native Australian forms. These were also annual rather than perennial forms. Many were given cultivar names such as 'atrococcineum' (dark scarlet flower heads), 'atrosanguineum' (dark blood-red flower heads), 'aureum' (golden yellow flower heads), 'bicolor' (red-tipped yellow flower heads), 'compositum' (large multicoloured flower heads), 'macranthum' (large rose-edged white flower heads), and 'monstrosum' (flower heads with many <b>bracts),</b> although today they are generally sold in mixed seed for growing as annuals. Some coloured forms of South African Helichrysum {{are thought to have}} been introduced to the breeding program, which resulted in the huge array of colours. X. bracteatum was one of several species that became popular with European royalty and nobility from the early 19th century, yet were little noticed in Australia until the 1860s, when they became more prominent in Australian gardens.|$|E

5|$|An {{individual}} flowerhead reaches {{full size}} {{about two weeks}} after first emerging from the <b>bracts,</b> and lasts another {{two weeks before the}} flowers fade and fall. In the first phase, the individual small flowers, known as florets, remain unopened‚Äîand the flowerhead retains a compact shape‚Äîbefore they mature and split open, revealing the stigma, style, and anther. The anther is sessile, lacking a filament, and lies next to the stigma {{at the end of the}} style. The outermost florets open first, with anthesis progressing towards the centre of the flowerhead, which becomes darker and more open in appearance, and begins attracting birds and insects. The ovary lies at the base of the style and atop a stalk known as the gynophore, and it is from here that the seed pods then develop. Meanwhile, a crescent-shaped nectary lies at the base of the gynophore.|$|E
5|$|Flowers : Hermaphroditic, actinomorphic (radially symmetric) or {{slightly}} zygomorphic (bilaterally symmetric), pedicellate (on a short secondary stem), generally large and showy {{but may be}} inconspicuous : (Medeoleae). <b>Bracts</b> may (bracteate) or may not (ebracteate) be present. The perianth is undifferentiated (perigonium) and biseriate (two whorled), formed from six tepals arranged into two separate whorls of three parts (trimerous) each, although Scoliopus has only three petals, free from the other parts, but overlapping. The tepals are usually petaloid (petal like) and apotepalous (free) with lines (striate) or marks in other colors or shades. The perianth is either homochlamydeous (all tepals equal, e.g. Fritillaria) or dichlamydeous (two separate and different whorls, e.g. Calochortus) and may be united into a tube. Nectar is produced in perigonal nectaries {{at the base of}} the tepals.|$|E
5|$|Other {{plants that}} are {{considered}} to be protocarnivorous have sticky trichomes on some surface, such as the flower scape and bud of Stylidium and Plumbago, the <b>bracts</b> of Passiflora foetida, and leaves of Roridula. The trichomes of Stylidium, which appear below the flower, have been known to trap and kill small insects since their discovery several centuries ago, but their purpose remained ambiguous. In November 2006, Dr. Douglas Darnowski published a paper describing the active digestion of proteins when they come in contact with a trichome of a Stylidium species grown in aseptic tissue culture, proving that the plant, rather than the surface microbes, was the source of protease production. Darnowski asserts in that paper that given this evidence, Stylidium species are properly called carnivorous, though in order to fulfill the strict definition of carnivory it needs to be proven that they are capable of absorbing nutrients derived from prey and that this adaptation gives the plants some competitive advantage.|$|E

5|$|The {{species is}} very similar to A.barbiger. There are obvious {{differences}} in typical leaf shape, with leaves of most populations of A.barbiger being very much longer and narrower than those of A.obovatus. However, leaf shape is variable in both species, and some southern populations of A.barbiger have leaves that are indistinguishable from those of A.obovatus. The most systematically important properties by which the two may be distinguished are the shape of the perianth limb, which is rounded in A.obovatus and pointed in A.barbiger; the <b>bracts,</b> glabrous versus hirsute; and the style-ends, which are green and scarlet respectively. The species also differ slightly in range of flower colours: A.barbiger has scarlet to bright red flowers, whereas A.obovatus flowers are scarlet to orange.|$|E
5|$|Xerochrysum bracteatum, {{commonly}} known as the golden everlasting or strawflower, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae native to Australia. Described by √âtienne Pierre Ventenat in 1803, it was known as Helichrysum bracteatum for many years before being transferred to a new genus Xerochrysum in 1990. It grows as a woody or herbaceous perennial or annual shrub up to a metre (3ft) tall with green or grey leafy foliage. Golden yellow or white flower heads are produced from spring to autumn; their distinctive feature is the papery <b>bracts</b> that resemble petals. The species is widespread, growing in a variety of habitats across the country, from rainforest margins to deserts and subalpine areas. The golden everlasting serves as food for various larvae of lepidopterans (butterflies and moths), and adult butterflies, hoverflies, native bees, small beetles, and grasshoppers visit the flower heads.|$|E
5|$|Lambertia formosa grows as a {{spreading}} shrub to 2m (7ft) tall, {{with one}} or more stems arising from a woody base known as a lignotuber. The new growth is covered with a fine brownish hair. The stiff leaves are arranged in whorls of 3, or sometimes up to 4 to 6, on the stems, and are linear to narrow-oblanceolate in shape. Measuring anywhere from 1 to 8cm (0.4‚Äì3in) in length and 0.2‚Äì0.7cm wide, they have a pointed tip or apex. Flowers are seen at any time of the year, but more often over spring and summer (September to January). Their bases are covered by greenish and reddish <b>bracts.</b> The inflorescences are almost always made up of seven smaller individual flowers (less than 1% of flowerheads have either six or eight flowers), known as florets, and can be shades of red or pink in colour. The tubular perianths are 4.5cm (1.6in) long, with the styles protruding another 1‚Äì1.5cm (0.5in) beyond. Flowering is followed by the development of woody fruit which measure 2‚Äì3 by 1‚Äì2cm. They have two 1‚Äì1.5cm sharp horny protuberances, and a 0.5cm 'beak', initially pale green in colour before fading to a grey-brown. These woody follicles each have two flat, winged seeds that are retained until burnt by fire.|$|E
