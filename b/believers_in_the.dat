5|$|In {{supporting}} Calvin's {{proposals for}} reforms, {{the council of}} Geneva passed the Ordonnances ecclésiastiques (Ecclesiastical Ordinances) on 20 November 1541. The ordinances defined four orders of ministerial function: pastors to preach and to administer the sacraments; doctors to instruct <b>believers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> faith; elders to provide discipline; and deacons {{to care for the}} poor and needy. They also called for the creation of the Consistoire (Consistory), an ecclesiastical court composed of the lay elders and the ministers. The city government retained the power to summon persons before the court, and the Consistory could judge only ecclesiastical matters having no civil jurisdiction. Originally, the court had the power to mete out sentences, with excommunication as its most severe penalty. The government contested this power and on 19 March 1543 the council decided that all sentencing would be carried out by the government.|$|E

25|$|Sanctifying Grace is {{that grace}} of God which sustains the <b>believers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> journey toward Christian Perfection: a genuine love of God with heart, soul, mind, and strength, and a genuine love {{of our neighbors}} as ourselves. Sanctifying grace enables us to respond to God by leading a Spirit-filled and Christ-like life aimed toward love.|$|E
25|$|<b>Believers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{relevance}} of the supernatural gifts sometimes speak of a Baptism of the Holy Spirit or Filling of the Holy Spirit which the Christian needs to experience {{in order to receive}} those gifts. Many churches hold that the Baptism of the Holy Spirit is identical with conversion, and that all Christians are by definition baptized in the Holy Spirit.|$|E
25|$|<b>Believers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{authenticity}} of the Zohar countered {{that the lack of}} references to the work in Jewish literature were because bar Yohai did not commit his teachings to writing but transmitted them orally to his disciples over generations until finally the doctrines were embodied in the Zohar. They found it unsurprising that bar Yochai should have foretold future happenings or made references to historical events of the post-Talmudic period.|$|E

25|$|The {{method was}} an early attempt to use logical means to produce knowledge. Llull hoped to show that Christian doctrines could be {{obtained}} artificially from a fixed set of preliminary ideas. For example, the most essential table listed the attributes of God: goodness, greatness, eternity, power, wisdom, will, virtue, truth and glory. Llull knew that all <b>believers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> monotheistic religions—whether Jews, Muslims or Christians—would agree with these attributes, giving him a firm platform from which to argue.|$|E
25|$|The Ecumenical Patriarchate {{promotes}} {{the expansion of}} the Christian faith and the Orthodox doctrine, and the Ecumenical Patriarchs are involved in ecumenism and interfaith dialogue, charitable work, and the defense of Orthodox Christian traditions. Prominent issues in the Ecumenical Patriarchate's policy in the 21st century include the safety of the <b>believers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Middle East, reconciliation of the Eastern Orthodox and Catholic Churches, and the reopening of the Theological School of Halki which was closed down by the Turkish authorities in 1971.|$|E
25|$|There {{was little}} {{agreement}} among <b>believers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> story {{as to the}} exact nature or even color of the red mercury, while the supposed uses for it ranged from it being {{an essential component of}} nuclear power, to having the ability to summon jinn, extract gold, or locate buried treasure and perform other forms of magic. The official spokesman for the Riyadh police said that the rumors had been started by gangs attempting to swindle people out of their money, and denied the existence of red mercury in sewing machines.|$|E

25|$|The inquiry {{recommended}} that the grave be found, the body exhumed, and its DNA compared to relatives of Sydney personnel. A 2001 search by the RAN failed to find the grave, but they were more successful during a second search in 2006. During an autopsy, a metal fragment was found embedded in the skull, which was believed to have killed the man through brain trauma: although seized upon by <b>believers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> massacre of Sydneys sailors, the fragment {{was found to be}} German shell shrapnel. While DNA comparison testing did not produce definite results, as of September 2010 it remained on-going.|$|E
25|$|The {{two main}} but {{conflicting}} {{aspirations of the}} movement were to create a holy and pure fellowship on one hand, and to allow all Christians into fellowship on the other. <b>Believers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> movement felt that the established Church of England had abandoned or distorted many of the ancient traditions of Christendom, following decades of dissent {{and the expansion of}} Methodism and political revolutions in the United States and France. To get away from the sectarianism of dissenters, people in the movement wanted simply to meet together {{in the name of the}} Lord Jesus Christ without reference to denominational differences. Early meetings included Christians from a variety of denominations.|$|E
25|$|Orthodox Christians {{constituted}} {{a majority of}} <b>believers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union. In the late 1980s, three Orthodox churches claimed substantial memberships there: the Russian Orthodox Church, the Georgian Orthodox Church, and the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church (AOC). They {{were members of the}} major confederation of Orthodox churches in the world, generally referred to as the Eastern Orthodox Church. The first two functioned openly and were tolerated by the regime, but the Ukrainian AOC was not permitted to function openly. Parishes of the Belarusian Autocephalous Orthodox Church reappeared in Belarus only after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, but they did not receive recognition from the Belarusian Exarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church, which controls Belarusian eparchies.|$|E

25|$|Prior to forming Minor Threat in 1980, vocalist Ian MacKaye {{and drummer}} Jeff Nelson had played bass and drums {{respectively}} in the Teen Idles while attending Wilson High School. During their two-year career within the flourishing Washington D.C. hardcore punk scene, the Teen Idles had gained a following of around one hundred fans (a sizable amount at the time), and {{were seen as}} only second within the scene to the contemporary Bad Brains. MacKaye and Nelson were strong <b>believers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> DIY mentality and an independent, underground music scene. After {{the breakup of the}} Teen Idles, they used the money earned through the band to create Dischord Records, an independent record label that would host the releases of the Teen Idles, Minor Threat, and numerous other D.C. punk bands.|$|E
25|$|From 1850 on, small {{communities}} established themselves in elsewhere in Azerbaijan. Soon {{the community of}} Baku counted {{the largest number of}} <b>believers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region and in 1860 obtained official recognition from the authorities. The community recognized the newly announced position of Bahá'u'lláh. Soon there was more public awareness and some favor from leaders of the broader community {{and at the same time}} the Bahá'í community of Baku broadened its communication with other Bahá'í communities in Russia, Turkey and Ashkhabad and did much work printing materials in Turkish. The most publicly recognized member of the community approaching 1900 was Musa Nagiyev, one of Azerbaijan's richest citizens of the times though there were many public figures before and after who seem to have admired the religion or even been members of it.|$|E
25|$|The first Roman Catholic church {{established}} in Newburgh was Holy Rosary Church, founded in 1862. The {{growth of the}} Catholic community in Ohio was small at first. The first Catholic church in northern Ohio was only built in 1820, and by 1829 there were only two. The first Catholic church in Cleveland wasn't built until 1840. A significant influx of Catholic <b>believers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1840s led to the rapid construction of more churches. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Cleveland was erected on April 13, 1847, and Amadeus Rappe became the first bishop with his consecration on October 10, 1847. The influx of Irish immigrants in the 1850s greatly enlarged the Catholic population in the Union-Miles Park area. A mission, the Church of Newburgh, was founded in 1854 to serve this Irish population. The success of this mission led directly to the founding of Holy Rosary. The congregation initially worshipped {{on the second floor}} of the Newburgh Village town hall until its church home was erected at the corner of E. 93rd Street and Miles Park Avenue later that year. Holy Rosary built a new, larger structure at 8328 Broadway Avenue in 1881 (just outside the southwestern border of Union-Miles Park), and the congregation changed their name to Holy Name Church.|$|E
