30|$|We {{investigated}} {{the feasibility of}} obtaining large photoresponse in metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM)type single nanowire device where one contact can be blocking type. We showed that suitable modification of the <b>blocking</b> <b>contact</b> by deposition of a capping metal using focused electron beam (FEB) can lead to considerable enhancement of the photoresponse. The work was done in a single Cu:TCNQ nanowire device fabricated by direct growth of nanowires (NW) from pre-patterned Cu electrode which makes the contact ohmic with the other contact made from Au. Analysis of the data shows that the large photoresponse of the devices arises predominantly due to reduction of the barriers at the Au/NW <b>blocking</b> <b>contact</b> on illumination. This {{is caused by the}} diffusion of the photo generated carriers from the nanowires to the contact region. When the barrier height is further reduced by treating the contact with FEB deposited Pt, this results in a large enhancement in the device photoresponse.|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} various {{electronic}} processes {{in a class}} of solid-state diodes which function analogously to thermionic-emission vacuum tube rectifiers is made. For experimental work, such diodes were fabricated from an insulating crystal (cadmium sulfide) to which an ohmic contact (indium) and a <b>blocking</b> <b>contact</b> (gold) were affixed. The properties of the diodes that are most rigorously investigated are the equilibrium space-charge-limited current voltage characteristic, the behavior of the <b>blocking</b> <b>contact</b> under high reverse fields, and the capacitance dependence upon crystal trapping-state kinetics. Electron trapping is demonstrated to have a marked influence on most of the electronic properties of analogue diodes. Mathematical analysis based upon the premise that these traps are volume-distributed in the crystals of CdS is corroborated by the experimental results. An analytical method, which treats various trapping configurations with energy in a unified fashion, is employed to calculate the expected influence of traps on the space-charge-limited current characteristic. Correspondence of this analysis with experimental observations permits the deduction, in some cases, of trap densities and trap depths. The theoretical treatment of the influence of volume-distributed trapping states on terminal capacitance is also shown to be consistent with measurements designed to test the physical model. Use of this theory to interpret measured capacitance variation allowed the determination of some of the kinetic properties of trapping states, thus demonstrating a new technique for obtaining this information. Correspondence with the results from other methods is good. Trapping-state concentrations in actual crystals are shown to constrain practical solid-state analogue devices to very small dimensions. ...|$|E

The use of both highly and poorly efficient cathodes in combination with impedance spectroscopy allows for a clear-cut separation of the physical mechanisms occurring within the active layer bulk from those taking place at the organic blend-contact interface. The system under study uses either Ca or CaO as the efficient and <b>blocking</b> <b>contact,</b> respectively. The impedance analysis demonstrates that charge carriers (electrons) move by diffusion within extended quasi-neutral regions, so that the cell operation is governed by the kinetic competition between charge transport toward the outer contacts and loss by recombination. It is also observed that contacts contribute with an additional, non-negligible, series resistance that accounts for the electron extraction process. The comparison between active layer thickness and the carrier diffusion length allows exclusion of bulk transport losses as a highly detrimental factor for this class of solar cells. 1...|$|E

In this work we investigated on the time dependence of the electric field of an Al/CdTe/Pt detector under optical perturbation by means of Pockels effect measurements.

40|$|We {{discuss a}} liquid crystal {{composite}} approach {{to provide a}} distributed interface to vertically separate electron-donating and electron-accepting films in an organic photovoltaic device. Two different methods are used to prepare a nematic liquid crystal polymer network with a porous surface and electron-donating properties. This is infilled with an electron-accepting organic semiconductor to form a bilayer device. The interface is diffuse rather than localized so that more photogenerated excitons can reach it to generate charge before they recombine. Photoinduced absorption of a blend of the donor and acceptor materials confirms that excitons dissociate at the heterointerface. The spatial features of the diffuse interface are examined by Fourier analysis of topographic images. We find a correlation between the in-plane spatial frequencies of the interface and photovoltaic device performance. The device performance is investigated {{as a function of}} input irradiance. Any charge combination is monomolecular rather than bimolecular, and the monochromatic power conversion efficiency varies between 0. 8 % and 0. 3 % with input irradiance.
