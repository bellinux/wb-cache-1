5|$|Asteroids {{has been}} ported to {{multiple}} platforms, including much of Atari's hardware (Atari 2600 and 8-bit computers in 1981, Atari 7800 in 1987, Atari Lynx in 1994) {{and many other}} platforms. Released in 1981, the 2600 port was the first game to use <b>bank</b> <b>switching,</b> a technique developed by Carl Nielsen's group of engineers that increased available ROM space from 4 KB to 8 KB. Brad Stewart, the programmer tasked {{to work on the}} port, used <b>bank</b> <b>switching</b> to complete the game. A port for the Atari 5200, identical to the Atari 8-bit computer version, was in development in 1982, but was not published.|$|E
5|$|The Z80 {{processor}} {{used in the}} Spectrum has a 16-bit address bus, {{which means}} only 64KB of memory can be directly addressed. To facilitate the extra 80KB of RAM the designers used <b>bank</b> <b>switching</b> so the new memory would be available as eight pages of 16KB {{at the top of}} the address space. The same technique was used to page between the new 16KB editor ROM and the original 16KB BASIC ROM at the bottom of the address space.|$|E

50|$|The COS monitor was {{stored in}} either 4 KB (COS 3.4 and earlier) or 6 KB (COS 4.0 and later) of ROM; {{in the latter}} case part of the ROM was <b>bank</b> <b>switched.</b>|$|R
25|$|On most {{machines}} the bootstrap was {{a minimal}} bootloader in ROM combined with some means of minimal <b>bank</b> <b>switching</b> or {{a means of}} injecting code on the bus (since the 8080 needs to see boot code at Address 0 for start-up, while CP/M needs RAM there); for others, this bootstrap had to be entered into memory using front-panel controls each time the system was started.|$|E
25|$|Since at {{a minimum}} the {{starting}} code address vector must always be valid on reset, systems commonly included some nonvolatile memory (e.g. ROM) starting at address zero to contain the vectors and bootstrap code. However, for a general purpose system it is desirable for the operating system {{to be able to}} change the vectors at runtime. This was often accomplished by either pointing the vectors in ROM to a jump table in RAM, or through use of <b>bank</b> <b>switching</b> to allow the ROM to be replaced by RAM at runtime.|$|E
25|$|The last 8-bit {{version of}} CP/M was version 3, often called CP/M Plus, {{released}} in 1983. It incorporated the <b>bank</b> <b>switching</b> memory management of MP/M in a single-user single-task operating system compatible with CP/M 2.2 applications. CP/M 3 could therefore use more than 64 kB of memory on an 8080 or Z80 processor. The {{system could be}} configured to support date stamping of files. The operating system distribution software also included a relocating assembler and linker. CP/M 3 was available for the last generation of 8-bit computers, notably the Amstrad PCW, the ZX Spectrum +3, the Commodore 128, and the Radio Shack TRS-80 Model 4.|$|E
50|$|Citizens National <b>Bank</b> <b>switched</b> from a {{national}} to a state-chartered institution in 1890 as Citizens Commercial & Savings Bank. In 1928, the original bank building was demolished and the a new headquarters building, Citizens Bank Building, {{was built on the}} site. In 1937, the Bank began its annual Citizens' Holiday Sing.|$|R

25|$|Pirate {{cartridges}} for the NES were rare, but Famicom {{ones were}} common and widespread in Asia. Most were produced in Hong Kong or Taiwan, {{and they usually}} featured a variety of small (32k or less) games which were selected from a menu and <b>bank</b> <b>switched.</b> Some were also hacks of existing games (especially Super Mario Bros.), and a few were cartridge conversions of Famicom Disk System titles such as the Japanese SMB2.|$|R
25|$|The read/write memory between address 0100 {{hexadecimal}} and {{the lowest}} address of the BDOS was the Transient Program Area (TPA) available for CP/M application programs. Although all Z80 and 8080 processors could address 64 kilobytes of memory, the amount available for application programs could vary, depending {{on the design of}} the particular computer. Some computers used large parts of the address space for such things as BIOS ROMs, or video display memory. As a result, some systems had more TPA memory available than others. <b>Bank</b> <b>switching</b> was a common technique that allowed systems to have a large TPA while switching out ROM or video memory space as needed. CP/M 3.0 allowed parts of the BDOS to be in bank-switched memory as well.|$|E
500|$|Dragon Quest VI: Realms of Revelation is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} developed by Heartbeat {{and published by}} Enix (now Square Enix) for the Super Famicom {{as a part of}} the Dragon Quest series and as the last Dragon Quest game in the Zenithia trilogy. It was released on December 9, 1995, in Japan, developed by Heartbeat; whereas the previous Dragon Quest games were developed by Chunsoft. [...] In July 2007, Square Enix announced a series of remakes of , [...] and Dragon Quest VI: Realms of Revelation for the Nintendo DS, making this the first time the game in question got released on other consoles and overseas. Like its predecessor, Dragon Quest VI was a Japan-only release as the larger ROMs needed for English dialog were cost-prohibitive (the game was already 32 megabits in size, the limit for SNES ROMs without using <b>bank</b> <b>switching).</b> In addition, the game's release occurred very late into the SNES's lifespan, by which time Enix had dropped support for the console outside Japan. The title was finally released overseas for the Nintendo DS in North America on February 14, 2011, and in Europe on May 20, 2011. A version of the game for Android and iOS was released in Japan on June 10, 2015, and worldwide in English on June 24, 2015.|$|E
2500|$|Hitachi {{produced}} its own 6809-based machines, the MB6890 {{and later}} the S1. These were primarily for the Japanese market, but some were exported to and sold in Australia. There the MB6890 was dubbed the [...] "Peach", probably in ironic reference to {{the popularity of the}} Apple II. The S1 was notable in that it contained paging hardware extending the 6809's native 64 kilobyte (64×210 byte) addressing range to a full 1 megabyte (1×220 byte) in 4 KB pages. It was similar in this to machines produced by SWTPC, Gimix, and several other suppliers. TSC produced a Unix-like operating system uniFlex which ran only on such machines. OS-9 Level II, also took advantage of such memory management facilities. Most other computers of the time with more than 64 KB of memory addressing were limited to <b>bank</b> <b>switching</b> where much if not all the 64 KB was simply swapped for another section of memory.|$|E
50|$|Memory {{was fitted}} {{in up to}} four banks of RAM, each of either 4 KB (4 × 1024 bytes) or 16 KB, {{although}} not every permutation was permitted. Typical configurations were 16 KB for cassette-based systems and 32, 48 or 64 KB of memory on disk-based systems. Main memory was not used by the text or graphics video cards, although memory on the video cards was <b>bank</b> <b>switched</b> into a dedicated 1.5 KB address block.|$|R

2500|$|A {{larger problem}} was that the {{designers}} of the MSX standard <b>bank</b> <b>switching</b> protocol did not prescribe to hardware manufacturers in which banks the cartridges and, more importantly, the RAM should be found. Moreover, the MSX's BIOS did not provide this information either, thus requiring programmers to implement complex routines to [...] "find" [...] these resources. Often programmers assumed that the RAM and cartridges would be available at a [...] "default" [...] bank switch location; in reality some systems had their RAM or cartridge slot(s) not at the [...] "default" [...] location, but at another bank switch location (i.e. Toshiba HX-20). In those cases programs failed to run because they only [...] "saw" [...] 32KB of the available memory, instead of the full 64KB that almost all MSX-1 machines offered. All other mainstream MSX-1 machines offered at least the full 64KB of RAM, with a very few exceptions, such as some early Phillips MSX-1 models (the VG8000 offered 16 KB of RAM and the VG8010, 32 KB) or the Casio PV-7, a low budget MSX targeted for playing games, which has only 8 KB.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bank</b> <b>switching</b> {{was also}} used in some video game consoles. The Atari 2600, for instance, could only address 4 KB of ROM, so later 2600 game {{cartridges}} contained their own <b>bank</b> <b>switching</b> hardware in order to {{permit the use of}} more ROM and thus allow for more sophisticated games (via more program code and, equally important, larger amounts of game data such as graphics and different game stages). The Nintendo Entertainment System contained a modified 6502 but its cartridges sometimes contained a megabit or more of ROM, addressed via <b>bank</b> <b>switching</b> called a Multi-Memory Controller. Game Boy cartridges used a chip called MBC (Memory Bank Controller), which not only offered ROM <b>bank</b> <b>switching,</b> but also cartridge SRAM <b>bank</b> <b>switching,</b> and even access to such peripherals as infrared links or rumble motors. <b>Bank</b> <b>switching</b> was still being used on later game systems. Several Sega Mega Drive cartridges were over 4MB in size and required the use of this technique (4MB being the maximum address size).The GP2X handheld from Gamepark Holdings uses <b>bank</b> <b>switching</b> in order to control the start address (or memory offset) for the second processor.|$|E
50|$|The MOS Technology 6509, an {{enhanced}} {{version of the}} popular 6502 microprocessor, was capable of addressing up to 1 megabyte of RAM via <b>bank</b> <b>switching.</b> While numerous 6502-based processors could do <b>bank</b> <b>switching,</b> they did this via separate logic. The 6509 had this logic on-chip.|$|E

Common types of IEDs include protective relaying devices, On Load Tap Changer controllers, circuit breaker controllers, capacitor <b>bank</b> <b>switches,</b> recloser controllers, voltage regulators etc. This is generally controlled by a setting file. The testing of setting files is typically one of the most time consuming roles of a protection tester.|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} has consistently {{shown that a}} large number of firms are sufficiently dissatisfied with their bank relationship to have considered switching to an alternative bank. In practice, however, the number of firms which actually <b>switch</b> <b>banks</b> is relatively low. This paper examines empirical evidence from a postal survey of small firms in order to investigate this paradox. Binomial and multinomial logistic regression is used to identify the characteristics which discriminate between a group of firms considering <b>switching</b> <b>banks</b> and two other groups, namely those which had <b>switched</b> <b>banks</b> in the previous three years and those which had not <b>switched</b> <b>banks</b> and were not considering doing so. The paper tests the hypothesis that some small firms may be "informationally captured", in that they are tied into their current bank relationship due to difficulties in conveying accurate information about their performance. The results provide some evidence in support of the hypothesis in that rapidly changing information, particularly changing technology, was a characteristic associated with firms which were considering switching but had not switched. However, there was no significant evidence to support the hypothesis that superior performing firms are more likely to be "informationally captured"; growth and perceived business success were both associated with firms which <b>switched</b> <b>banks.</b> There was strong evidence that the main drivers of the decision to switch or consider <b>switching</b> <b>banks</b> were difficulties obtaining finance and dissatisfaction with the service provided. The results also showed that firms which were considering <b>switching</b> <b>banks</b> tended to use more alternative (non-banking) sources of finance. It is concluded that some firms will resolve difficulties obtaining finance by <b>switching</b> <b>banks,</b> whereas others will use alternative sources of finance depending on the balance between the benefits of switching, such as increased finance, and switching costs including information provision...|$|R
