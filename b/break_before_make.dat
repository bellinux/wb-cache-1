40|$|WIMAX is Wireless Interoperability for Microwave Access. It is a {{telecommunication}} {{technology that}} provides wireless data over long distances in several ways, from point-to-point links to full mobile cellular type access. The main consideration of Mobile Wimax {{is to achieve}} seamless handover such {{that there is no}} loss of data. In Wimax both mobile station (MS) and base station (BS) scans the neighbouring base stations for selecting the best base station for a potential handover. Two types of handovers in wimax are: Hard handover (<b>break</b> <b>before</b> <b>make)</b> and Soft handover (make before break). To avoid data loss during handover we have considered soft handovers in this paper. We have proposed a technique to select a base station for potential soft handover in Wimax. We have developed a base station selection procedure that will optimize the soft handover such that there is no data loss; handover decision is taken quickly and thus improving overall handover performance. We will compare the quality of service with hard handover and soft handover. We have analysed the proposed technique with an existing scheme for soft handover in Wimax with simulation results...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} handover decision instability which impacts negatively on both user {{perception and}} network performances. To this aim, {{a new technique}} called The HandOver Decision STAbility Technique (HODSTAT) is proposed for horizontal handover in Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN) based on IEEE 802. 11 standard. HODSTAT {{is based on a}} hysteresis margin analysis that, combined with a utilitybased function, evaluates the need for the handover and determines if the handover is needed or avoided. Indeed, if a Mobile Terminal (MT) only transiently hands over to a better network, the gain from using this new network may be diminished by the handover overhead and short usage duration. The approach that we adopt throughout this article aims at reducing the minimum handover occurrence that leads to the interruption of network connectivity (this is {{due to the nature of}} handover in WLAN which is a <b>break</b> <b>before</b> <b>make</b> which causes additional delay and packet loss). To this end, MT rather performs a handover only if the connectivity of the current network is threatened or if the performance of a neighboring network is really better comparing the current one with a hysteresis margin. This hysteresis should make a tradeoff between handover occurrence and the necessity to change the current network of attachment. Our extensive simulation results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms other decision stability approaches for handover decision algorithm. Comment: 13 Pages, IJWM...|$|E

Fast Base Station Switching In FBSS, the MS and BS diversity set is maintained similar as in MDHO. MS continuously monitors the base stations in the diversity set and defines an “Anchor BS”. Anchor BS is only one base station of the diversity set that MS communicates with for all uplink and downlink traffic including management messages (see fig. 3). This is the BS where MS is registered, synchronized, performs ranging and there downlink channel is monitored for control information. The anchor BS can be changed from frame to frame depending on BS selection scheme. This means every frame can be sent via different BS in diversity set...|$|E
