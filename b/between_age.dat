5|$|On October 11, 2016, a {{panel of}} conference media {{selected}} a 10-member preseason All-Big Ten Team and Derrick Walton was among the honorees. Zak Irvin and Walton represented the team at the October 13 Big Ten Basketball Media Day held in Washington, D.C.. Michigan began the season unranked, but received votes in the preseason Coaches' Poll. The team scheduled its third annual Open Practice, Selfie Promotion day for October 25. According to SB Nation Irvin (#11), Walton (#16) and Muhammad Ali Abdur Rahkman (#23) were among the 25 best players entering the season in the Big Ten Conference. On November 1, Michigan announced that the team would have an anthem buddy program for youth <b>between</b> <b>age</b> 8 and 11 to stand for the anthem with their favorite player. Walton and Irvin served as co-captains.|$|E
5|$|The {{phonology}} {{of words}} {{has proven to}} be beneficial to vocabulary development when children begin school. Once children have developed a vocabulary, they utilize the sounds that they already know to learn new words. The phonological loop encodes, maintains and manipulates speech-based information that a person encounters. This information is then stored in the phonological memory, a part of short term memory. Research shows that children's capacities in the area of phonological memory are linked to vocabulary knowledge when children first begin school at age 4–5 years old. As memory capabilities tend to increase with age (<b>between</b> <b>age</b> 4 and adolescence), so does an individual's ability to learn more complex vocabulary.|$|E
50|$|In the village, the {{population}} was spread out with 4.8% {{under the age of}} 5, 8.3% <b>between</b> the <b>ages</b> of 5 and 9, 9.5% <b>between</b> the <b>ages</b> of 10 and 14, 4.8% <b>between</b> the <b>ages</b> of 15 and 19, 6.0% <b>between</b> the <b>ages</b> of 20 and 24, 7.1% <b>between</b> the <b>ages</b> of 25 and 29, 4.8% <b>between</b> the <b>ages</b> of 30 and 34, 10.7% <b>between</b> the <b>ages</b> of 35 and 39, 7.1% <b>between</b> the <b>ages</b> of 40 and 44, 6.0% <b>between</b> the <b>ages</b> of 45 and 49, 9.5% <b>between</b> the <b>ages</b> of 50 and 54, 3.6% <b>between</b> the <b>ages</b> of 55 and 59, 9.5% <b>between</b> the <b>ages</b> of 60 and 64, 2.4% <b>between</b> the <b>ages</b> of 65 and 69, 3.6% <b>between</b> the <b>ages</b> of 70 and 74, 1.2% <b>between</b> the <b>ages</b> of 75 and 79, no one <b>between</b> the <b>ages</b> of 80 and 84, and 1.2% 85 years and older. The median age was 37.7 years. For every 100 females there were 127.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 87.8 males.|$|R
500|$|In its {{original}} American broadcast on March 17, 2010, [...] "Sexual Healing" [...] was watched by 3.7 million viewers, {{according to the}} Nielsen Media Research, making it the most watched South Park debut since the third season premiere [...] "Rainforest Shmainforest" [...] in 1999. The day it aired, [...] "Sexual Healing" [...] was the highest-rated show in all of television among men <b>between</b> <b>ages</b> 18 and 34, and was the highest rated cable show among adults <b>between</b> <b>ages</b> 18 and 49. March 17 ranked as the most-watched night {{of the year for}} Comedy Central. [...] "Sexual Healing" [...] drew a 2.6 overall rating, a 2.4 rating among adults <b>between</b> <b>ages</b> 18 and 49, a 5.2 rating among men <b>between</b> <b>ages</b> 18 and 34, and a 6.9 rating among men <b>between</b> <b>ages</b> 18 and 24. [...] "Sexual Healing" [...] aired before the series premiere of the animated comedy series Ugly Americans, which drew 2.1 million viewers. The network was also the highest-rated and most-watched overall television network among men <b>between</b> <b>ages</b> 18 and 24, and the highest-rated and most-watched cable network among adults <b>between</b> <b>ages</b> 18 and 49 and men <b>between</b> <b>ages</b> 18 and 34.|$|R
50|$|The {{median age}} of all {{residents}} is 31.2 years, with an age distribution of 26.2% {{under the age of}} 18, 43.5% <b>between</b> <b>ages</b> 18 and 44, 21.2% <b>between</b> <b>ages</b> 45 and 64, and 9.1% ages 65 and above.|$|R
5|$|While the {{national}} average for sex ratio shows an increase from 933 in 2001 to 940 in 2011, the 2011 census shows {{a sharp decline in}} child sex ratio, the number of females per thousand males in a population <b>between</b> <b>age</b> group 06 years. States such as Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Mizoram and Andaman and Nicobar Islands recorded an increase in child sex ratio. National child sex ratio has declined from 927 in 2001 to 914 in 2011. Telangana census was separated from Andhra Pradesh state census figures, after Telangana formally took birth on 2 June 2014.|$|E
5|$|The second common parasitoid, Elasmus polistis, {{also has}} {{disastrous}} {{effects on the}} P. exclamans nest. Up to 80 E. polistis will hatch out of a single cell. The males emerge first, and then will exit the nest and wait until the females emerge. Once the female moths emerge, the males will mate and reproduce, quickly destroying the P. exclamans population. In some cases the invading E. polistis will hide larvae in the nest so that the P.exclamans cannot find them. This {{is important to the}} survival of P.exclamans. The hosts will attempt to remove as many parasitoids as possible to prevent them from spreading to nearby nests. This defense mechanism has not been proven to be effective, as more often than not the E. polistis larvae go undetected by the hosts. In one experiment conducted, it was found that over 60% of all nests lost brood to the parasitoids E. polistis or C. iphitalis in 1981. It was also observed that larger satellites have a greater risk of being parasitized. This {{is due to the fact}} that the large nests are typically older. This relationship <b>between</b> <b>age</b> and parasitism can be seen with the fact that older queens’ nests tend to be parasitized more than younger queens’ nests.|$|E
25|$|In Bellinzona about 60.5% of the {{population}} (<b>between</b> <b>age</b> 25–64) have completed either non-mandatory upper secondary education or additional higher education (either university or a Fachhochschule).|$|E
50|$|According to the Snuneymuxw First Nation Language Needs Assessment {{report of}} January 2009, {{published}} by the First Peoples' Heritage Language & Culture Council (FPHLCC) of a total population of 1560 (with 550 on reserve and 1010 off-reserve) there were 25 people who spoke and understood the language fluently, 11 were <b>between</b> the <b>ages</b> of 65-74, 13 were <b>between</b> the <b>ages</b> of 75-84 and one was 85 and over. There were 35 who understood and/or spoke somewhat. 4 were <b>between</b> the <b>ages</b> of 25-44, 23 were <b>between</b> the <b>ages</b> of 45-54 and 8 were <b>between</b> the <b>ages</b> of 55-64. There were 25 people learning the language. Of that group 15 were <b>between</b> the <b>ages</b> of 15-19, 2 were <b>between</b> the <b>ages</b> of 25-44, 4 were <b>between</b> the <b>ages</b> of 45-54 and 4 were <b>between</b> the <b>ages</b> of 55-64.|$|R

25|$|One {{study showed}} the {{incidence}} of hip dysplasia increased to 6.7% for dogs neutered before 5.5 months compared to 4.7% for dogs neutered after 5.5 months, although the cases associated with early age neutering seems to be of a less severe form. There was no association <b>between</b> <b>age</b> of neutering and arthritis or long-bone fractures. Another study showed no correlation <b>between</b> <b>age</b> of neutering and musculoskeletal problems. A study of large breed dogs with cranial cruciate ligament rupture associated early-age neutering {{with the development of}} an excessive tibial plateau angle.|$|E
25|$|There was a {{definite}} association <b>between</b> <b>age</b> and acceptance/use of metric units {{but there was}} still either a majority or a large minority of younger people who habitually use imperial rather than metric units for various everyday functions.|$|E
25|$|Processing speed. Adolescents {{think more}} quickly than children. Processing speed {{improves}} sharply <b>between</b> <b>age</b> five and middle adolescence; it then begins to level off at age 15 and {{does not appear to}} change between late adolescence and adulthood.|$|E
50|$|Onset {{of adult}} GM1 is <b>between</b> <b>ages</b> 3 and 30.|$|R
50|$|Enlistment- Vegetius {{argues that}} {{enlistment}} occurs upon entering puberty, but Scheidel's sample discovered that around 50% of the tombstones showed enlistment occurring <b>between</b> <b>ages</b> 17 and 20, {{with an increase}} to 80% if ages 17 to 24 are included. There are also five examples of enlistment <b>between</b> <b>ages</b> 33 to 36 and one example at age 13.|$|R
50|$|Adult-onset Still's Disease is {{rare and}} has been {{described}} all over the world. The number of new cases per year {{is estimated to be}} 1.6 per 1,000,000 population. The number of people currently affected is estimated at 1.5 cases per 100,000-1,000,000 population. Onset is most common in two <b>age</b> ranges, <b>between</b> <b>ages</b> 15-25 and <b>between</b> <b>ages</b> of 36-46 years.|$|R
25|$|Adolescent girls become fertile {{following}} the menarche (first menstrual period), which normally occurs <b>between</b> <b>age</b> 11 to 12. After menarche, sexual intercourse (especially without contraception) {{can lead to}} pregnancy. The pregnant teenager may then miscarry, have an abortion, or carry the child to full term.|$|E
25|$|Added {{to these}} are the {{problems}} associated with implementing community health mechanisms. These problems are perceived initially as tools for fighting against unequal access to health services. However, once a comprehensive service is available to the public, new problems emerge from ethnic, cultural or religious differences, or from differences <b>between</b> <b>age</b> groups, genders or social classes.|$|E
25|$|Overall, about 45% of all {{pregnant}} women and 25% of all women postpartum suffer from PGP. During pregnancy, serious pain occurs in about 25%, and severe disability in about 8% of patients. After pregnancy, problems are serious in about 7%. There is no correlation <b>between</b> <b>age,</b> culture, nationality and numbers of pregnancies that determine {{a higher incidence of}} PGP.|$|E

30|$|In this specification, {{the role}} of self-efficacy and {{self-esteem}} is identified by exploiting changes <b>between</b> <b>ages</b> 12 and 15 that in turn lead to changes in risky behaviours <b>between</b> <b>ages</b> 15 and 19. In doing so, we implicitly assume the relevant coefficients are age-independent. This strategy has the advantage that it controls for individual unobservable characteristics that are constant over time.|$|R
25|$|In Schaffhausen about 69.8% of the {{population}} (<b>between</b> <b>age</b> 25-64) have completed either non-mandatory upper secondary education or additional higher education (either university or a Fachhochschule (university of applied sciences)). In Schaffhausen, , 1.73% of {{the population}} attend kindergarten or another pre-school, 5.65% attend a Primary School, 2.98% attend a lower level Secondary School, and 2.49% attend a higher level Secondary School.|$|E
25|$|Given Harry Evans Sr.'s {{destructive}} character, Mary Evans {{would often}} leave {{home with her}} sons to nearby Somerville, {{to stay with her}} sister Justine and the Epps family. There, Harry began piano lessons somewhere <b>between</b> <b>age</b> 5 and 7 with local teacher Helen Leland. Even though Bill was thought to be too young to receive lessons, he soon began to play what he had heard during his brother's class.|$|E
25|$|In Altstätten about 64.4% of the {{population}} (<b>between</b> <b>age</b> 25–64) have completed either non-mandatory upper secondary education or additional higher education (either university or a Fachhochschule). Out {{of the total population}} in Altstätten, , the highest education level completed by 2,532 people (24.4% of {{the population}}) was Primary, while 3,579 (34.5%) have completed Secondary, 905 (8.7%) have attended a Tertiary school, and 488 (4.7%) are not in school. The remainder did not answer this question.|$|E

25|$|A {{correlation}} <b>between</b> <b>age</b> {{and height}} in children is fairly causally transparent, but {{a correlation between}} mood and health in people is less so. Does improved mood lead to improved health, or does good health lead to good mood, or both? Or does some other factor underlie both? In other words, a correlation can be taken as evidence for a possible causal relationship, but cannot indicate what the causal relationship, if any, might be.|$|E
25|$|A 2009 U.S. study {{based on}} 2006 data {{estimated}} {{the prevalence of}} ASD in 8-year-old children to be 9.0 per 1,000 (approximate range 8.6–9.3). A 2009 report based on the 2007 Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey by the National Health Service determined that the prevalence of ASD in adults was approximately 1% of the population, with a higher prevalence in males and no significant variation <b>between</b> <b>age</b> groups; {{these results suggest that}} prevalence of ASD among adults is similar to that in children and rates of autism are not increasing.|$|E
25|$|According to the UNESCO's 2009 Global Education Digest, 6% of Pakistanis (9% {{of men and}} 3.5% of women) were {{university}} graduates as of 2007. Pakistan plans to increase this figure to 10% by 2015 and subsequently to 15% by 2020. There {{is also a great}} deal of variety <b>between</b> <b>age</b> cohorts. Less than 6% of those in the age cohort 55-64 have a degree, compared to 8% in the 45-54 age cohort, 11% in the 35-44 age cohort and 16% in the age cohort 25-34.|$|E
40|$|This {{literature}} review {{provides an overview}} of the theoretical and empirical research in several disciplines on the relation <b>between</b> <b>ageing</b> and subjective well-being, i. e., how subjective well-being evolves across the lifespan. Because of the different methodologies, data sets and samples used, comparison among disciplines and studies is difficult. However, extant studies do show either a U-shaped, inverted U-shaped or linear relation <b>between</b> <b>ageing</b> and subjective well-being...|$|R
