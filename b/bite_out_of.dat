As Lugaid has lost a hand, Conall fights him with one hand tucked into his belt, but he only beats him after his horse takes a <b>bite</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Lugaid's side. He also kills Erc, and takes his head back to Tara, where Erc's sister Achall dies of grief for her brother.|$|E
5|$|Spotted eagle rays, {{in common}} with many other rays, often fall victim to sharks such as the tiger shark, the lemon shark, the bull shark, the silver tip shark, and the great hammerhead shark. A great hammerhead shark has been {{observed}} attacking a spotted eagle ray in open water by taking a large <b>bite</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> one of its pectoral fins, thus incapacitating the ray. The shark then used its head to pin the ray {{to the bottom and}} pivoted to take the ray in its jaws, head first. Sharks have also been observed to follow female rays during the birthing season, and feed on the newborn pups.|$|E
5|$|In September 2008, Apple sent a {{cease and desist}} {{letter to}} the Victoria School of Business and Technology in Saanich, British Columbia, {{claiming}} the school's logo infringed Apple's trademark rights and that the school's logo falsely suggested Apple had authorized the school's activities. The logo in question featured the outline of an apple and a leaf, although the design incorporated a mountain, had three bumps {{on top of the}} apple instead of the two used by Apple, and had no <b>bite</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the apple, unlike Apple's logo. In April 2011, the school reported it had settled its 3-year dispute with Apple, was launching a new logo under a new name, Q College, and was expanding its operations. The settlement's full terms were undisclosed.|$|E

25|$|When {{they get}} back to the classroom, they wordlessly return to their cages, and their hats and capes come off. The Flyboat also disassembles by itself. Ming-Ming is always the first one to get back in her cage, Tuck is always the second, and Linny is always the last. A music style having to do with that day's rescue is played, as Linny takes a <b>bite</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the celery in her cage and winks towards the camera as the closing credits begin.|$|E
25|$|Other prank objects include Belch Powder, Dungbombs (which explode {{and cause}} {{a large and}} {{extremely}} smelly mess), and Ever-Bashing Boomerangs (which hit their target repeatedly after being thrown). Fanged Frisbees are quite literally normal Frisbees with fangs and are first mentioned in Goblet of Fire as one of Filch's newest restricted items during Dumbledore's start-of-term speech. However, they make their first appearance in Half-Blood Prince when Ron whirled one around the Gryffindor common room, it changed course with {{a mind of its}} own, and took a <b>bite</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a tapestry. Most of these objects are banned at Hogwarts due to the possibility of injury.|$|E
500|$|.....Bane {{managed to}} capture {{much of the}} ex-mayor's character: Her eyes are {{friendly}} and her hair as wild as ever. But Katz's signature grin is a little stiff, a little too aggressive. Leaning forward, she looks {{as if she might}} take a <b>bite</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the next passerby. Which by the way, seems appropriate when you look back on her days behind the mayoral desk. Maybe monochromatic bronze just isn't the right medium for a woman as colorful as ol' Vera. Where's the red blazer? Our suggestion: Get this lady some accessories! The right hat or scarf could make that brown pantsuit really work.|$|E

I got so frightened my heart fell in my shoe. When he finally walked away, the director yelled 'Cut' and I had to take a long breather. But I could really relate to the lion. I feel like in a past life I was a lion or a cat or something." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Comedy Central did {{not object}} to most aspects of the episode, they did require some edits to {{material}} they deemed potentially offensive. During rehearsal for a Nativity play, a baby Jesus resembling a fetus pops out of Wendy, who is playing the Virgin Mary, and is caught by Kyle, who is portraying Joseph of Nazareth. Although the scene was ultimately kept in the episode, Comedy Central executives had problems with it and Parker said they had to handle its animation [...] "very carefully". Additionally, during filming of the live-action Mr. Hankey commercial, the baby originally held the Mr. Hankey stool and took a <b>bite</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it. Comedy Central officials would not allow {{the scene in the}} episode and it was changed to portray the idea that the baby had already eaten the stool off-camera, which Parker said he felt was actually funnier.|$|E
500|$|As {{the larvae}} mature, they become {{increasingly}} aggressive. Although they have host plants surrounding them, H. zea larvae attack and eat other insects. When {{presented with a}} second-instar larva of Urbanus proteus, the corn earworm larva grasps the insect, rolls onto its side to form a semicircle, and begins feeding on the insect's posterior end. If the U. proteus begins to <b>bite</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> defense, H. zea rotates the larva 180° and uses its mandibles to puncture the head capsule, killing the insect. Then, the H. zea larva [...] rotates the U. proteus back to its original position and continues feeding until the insect is entirely consumed. Even when presented with up to five U. proteus larvae, H. zea engages in the unique behavior, as the larvae have a higher affinity for lepidopterous prey over plant material. H. zea raised in a low-moisture environment has a lower pupal weight and a longer developmental time than those raised in environments of high moisture, so a nutritional benefit exists to such aggressive feeding behavior under such conditions.|$|E

60|$|Sharks, too, came to {{get their}} share of what was going. But these savage monsters did not content {{themselves}} with what was thrown away; they were so bold as to come before our faces and take <b>bites</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the whale's body. Some of these sharks were eight and nine feet long, and when I saw them open their horrid jaws, armed with three rows of glistening white sharp teeth, I could well understand how easily they could bite off the leg of a man, as they often do when they get the chance. Sometimes they would come right up on the whale's body with a wave, <b>bite</b> <b>out</b> great pieces <b>of</b> the flesh, turn over on their bellies, and roll off.|$|R
500|$|The primary {{race was}} bitter. Miller called McEwen [...] "Pinocchio," [...] and McEwen said of Miller, [...] "His misrepresentations and falsehoods are gargantuan. I {{tried to be}} his best friend in the delegation. I am deeply {{disappointed}} at the meanness of his effort." [...] Tom Deimer of Cleveland's Plain Dealer wrote that the two candidates were largely identical on the issues: [...] "both are textbook Republican conservatives, opposed to abortion, gun control, high taxes, and costly government programs — unless located in their districts." [...] Miller noted he had no overdrafts at the House bank, saying, [...] "the score is 166 to nothing." [...] McEwen said [...] "every one of my checks was free and clear. Every month's statement had a balance." [...] McEwen ran commercials against Miller claiming the long-time congressman [...] "has fallen {{out of touch with}} Ohio" [...] and [...] "doesn't live in our district and isn't even registered to vote here." [...] Miller struck back in a live-television interview by taking a Wheat Thin, claiming it to be McEwen, and then taking a <b>bite</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it.|$|E
500|$|The Red Sox {{held their}} World Series victory parade on the {{following}} Saturday, October 30. The team was transported around on 17 duck boats equipped with loudspeakers so the players could talk to the spectators. Due to large interest in the parade, it was lengthened by officials the day before to include the Charles River, so that fans could watch from the Boston and Cambridge river banks. The parade did not however, include a staged rally. The parade began at 10a.m. local time at Fenway Park, turned east onto Boylston Street, then west onto Tremont Street and Storrow Drive before entering the river. One of the lanes on Massachusetts Avenue had to be closed to accommodate {{members of the media}} filming the parade as it passed under the Harvard Bridge. Ramírez was handed a sign by one of the spectators part of the way through the parade, which read, [...] "Jeter is playing golf today. This is better!" [...] He held on to this sign {{for the rest of the}} parade, in a similar way to what Tug McGraw said after the Philadelphia Phillies won the 1980 World Series, [...] "For once, we take a <b>bite</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Big Apple". Over three million people were estimated to have attended the parade, making it the largest gathering ever in the city of Boston.|$|E

50|$|Carnotaurus - The Charger class. Carnotaurus is a fast sprinter, easily outrunning humans. Depending on {{the speed}} the Carnotaurus is running at, enemies that are charged headfirst will be knocked away and dealt {{as much as}} 80 damage (smaller Dinosaurs will be knocked <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the way, but not receive any damage). The Charger's special ability allows it to take <b>bites</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> prey to heal itself, while doing reduced damage. Its cheetah-like speed makes these brutes almost inescapable.|$|R
5|$|Other sharks feed on squid or fish, {{which they}} swallow whole. The viper dogfish has teeth it can point {{outwards}} to strike and capture prey that it then swallows intact. The great white {{and other large}} predators either swallow small prey whole or take huge <b>bites</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> large animals. Thresher sharks use their long tails to stun shoaling fishes, and sawsharks either stir prey from the seabed or slash at swimming prey with their tooth-studded rostra.|$|R
5000|$|The {{procession}} tradition {{began in}} 1949. More recently, the straw skimmers have changed to styrofoam hats, and classmates take <b>bites</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> one another's hats.

According to eyewitness reports, the resulting fires caused cars to be set alight on the road, and took [...] "a huge <b>bite</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the southbound lane".|$|E
2500|$|Demeter {{holds the}} bizarre {{distinction}} of being the only major leaguer on record to field an apple. There was a game during his tenure with the Phillies where Demeter had missed several defensive plays at 3rd base. The fans were upset and booing loudly, even prompting one overzealous fan to throw an apple onto the field. Demeter recalled, [...] "I'd made two errors and here came an apple sailing out of the stands." [...] He continued, [...] "So I just picked it up, took a <b>bite</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it and the booing stopped." ...|$|E
2500|$|Yet {{even that}} higher level {{could still be}} {{considered}} flawed, {{as it would be}} based almost entirely on food costs and on the assumption that families still spend a third of their income on food. In fact, Americans typically spent less than one tenth of their after-tax income on food in 2000. [...] For many families, the costs of housing, health insurance and medical care, transportation, and access to basic telecommunications take a much larger <b>bite</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the family's income today than a half century ago; yet, as noted above, [...] none of these costs are considered in determining the official poverty thresholds.|$|E
5|$|Helicoverpa zea earns its {{nickname}} {{the corn}} earworm for its widely known destruction of cornfields. The corn earworm feeds on {{every part of}} corn, including the kernels. Severe feeding {{at the tip of}} kernels allows entry for diseases and mold growth. Larvae begin feeding on the kernels once they have reached third instar. Larvae penetrate 9 to 15cm into the ear, with deeper penetration occurring as the kernels harden. Larvae do not eat the hard kernels, but take <b>bites</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> many kernels, lowering the quality of the corn for processing.|$|R

2500|$|In Plants vs. Zombies, players place {{different}} types of plants and fungi, each with their own unique offensive or defensive capabilities, around a house, {{in order to stop}} a horde of zombies from reaching the house of the residents. The playing field is divided into 5 to 6 horizontal lanes, and with rare exceptions, a zombie will only move towards the player's house along one lane (the main exception is if it has taken a <b>bite</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a garlic). Planting costs [...] "sun", which can be gathered for free (albeit slowly) during daytime levels and by planting certain plants or fungi. Most plants can only attack or defend against zombies in the lane they are planted in. In later levels, players can purchase upgrades with different offensive and defensive abilities.|$|E
