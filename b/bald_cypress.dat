5|$|Pettigrew State Park {{is home to}} one of {{the last}} stands of old-growth forest in eastern North Carolina. A forest of bay trees, sweetgum, pawpaw, persimmon, <b>bald</b> <b>cypress</b> and poplar are found on the {{northern}} shore of Lake Phelps. The cypress have a trunk diameter of up to tenfeet (3m) and the poplar have a trunk diameter of sixfeet (2m). There are vines that are as wide as an average man's leg and grow up the trees in excess of 130feet (40m). In the section of the park along the Scuppernong River, the Atlantic white cedar and other rare cedar trees have grown to rather large sizes. Several of the trees at Pettigrew State Park are listed on the North Carolina and National Registries of Big Trees.|$|E
5|$|Forests cover 65% of the state, {{primarily}} with deciduous, broad leaf {{trees in the}} western part of the state and evergreens and conifers dominant the central and eastern part of Virginia. Lower altitudes are more likely to have small but dense stands of moisture-loving hemlocks and mosses in abundance, with hickory and oak in the Blue Ridge. However, since the early 1990s, Gypsy moth infestations have eroded the dominance of oak forests. In the lowland tidewater and piedmont, yellow pines tend to dominate, with <b>bald</b> <b>cypress</b> wetland forests in the Great Dismal and Nottoway swamps. Other common trees and plants include red bay, wax myrtle, dwarf palmetto, tulip poplar, mountain laurel, milkweed, daisies, and many species of ferns. The largest areas of wilderness are along the Atlantic coast and in the western mountains, where the largest populations of trillium wildflowers in North America are found. The Atlantic coast regions are host to flora commonly associated with the South Atlantic pine forests and lower Southeast Coastal Plain maritime flora, the latter found primarily in eastern and central Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Conflicting {{reports have}} been made as to its {{preferred}} habitat; two papers suggest it preferred channels to floodplains, but another suggests it preferred the opposite. The possible preference for channels {{is based on the}} relative abundance of thescelosaur fossils in sandstones, representing channel environments, in comparison to mudstones, representing floodplain environments. No bonebeds or accumulations of multiple individuals have yet been reported. Dale Russell, in a popular work, noted that Thescelosaurus was the most common small herbivore in the Hell Creek Formation of the Fort Peck area. He described the environment of the time as a flat floodplain, with a relatively dry subtropical climate that supported a variety of plants ranging from angiosperm trees, to <b>bald</b> <b>cypress,</b> to ferns and ginkgos. Although most dinosaur skeletons from this area are incomplete, possibly due to the low preservation potential of forests, Thescelosaurus skeletons are much more complete, suggesting that this genus frequented stream channels. Thus when a Thescelosaurus died, it may have been in or near a river, making it easier to bury and preserve for later fossilization. Russell tentatively compared it to the capybaras and tapirs. Other dinosaurs that shared its time and place include the ceratopsids Triceratops and Torosaurus, hadrosaurid Edmontosaurus, ankylosaurid Ankylosaurus, pachycephalosaurian Pachycephalosaurus, and the theropods Ornithomimus, Troodon, and Tyrannosaurus. Thescelosaurus was also abundant in the Lance Formation. Toe bones from this genus are the most common finds after fossils of Triceratops and Edmontosaurus, and {{it may have been the}} most common dinosaur there in life, if the Lance Formation had a preservational bias against small animals.|$|E

25|$|Dendrochronology (tree ring) studies {{conducted}} on the oldest <b>bald</b> <b>cypress</b> trees growing in Reelfoot Lake found evidence of the 1811–1812 series {{in the form of}} fractures followed by rapid growth after their inundation, whereas cores taken from old <b>bald</b> <b>cypress</b> trees in the St. Francis sunklands showed slowed growth in the half century that followed 1812. These were interpreted as clear signals of the 1811–1812 earthquake series in tree rings. Because the tree ring record in Reelfoot Lake and the St. Francis sunk lands extend back to AD 1682 and AD 1321, respectively, Van Arsdale et al. interpreted the lack of similar signals elsewhere in the chronology as evidence against large New Madrid earthquakes between those years and 1811.|$|E
25|$|An {{ecologist}} named Lionel Janes {{conducted a}} survey of Caddo Lake (called Ferry Lake at the time) in 1913 and 1914. Based on an examination of cross sections of <b>bald</b> <b>cypress</b> and hardwood trees and many dead stumps he estimated that the lake came into existence sometime between 1770 and 1780.|$|E
50|$|In the 1780s, a {{water feature}} was added, with an island bordered by <b>bald</b> <b>cypresses</b> from Louisiana at its centre - it is {{traditionally}} {{attributed to the}} painter and garden designer Hubert Robert. After the French Revolution, Louis-Justin, marquis de Talaru, bought the estate under the Consulate and carried out repairs, redesigning the park 'à l'anglaise'. Mayor of Chamarande, he lived at the Château {{until his death in}} 1850.|$|R
50|$|Fossilized Metasequoia-like {{remains were}} noted in Europe and North America {{as long ago}} as the 1800s but were {{assigned}} to a variety of other genera such as Sequoia (redwoods) and Taxodium (<b>bald</b> <b>cypresses).</b> Many remains are found in bunches near clumps of coal, almost preserving them. It was not until living Metasequoia trees (Metasequoia glyptostroboides) were discovered and described from a remote area of China during the 1940s that true affinity of most of these fossils became apparent.|$|R

25|$|Maryland {{possesses}} {{a variety of}} topography within its borders, contributing to its nickname America in Miniature. It ranges from sandy dunes dotted with seagrass in the east, to low marshlands teeming with wildlife and large <b>bald</b> <b>cypress</b> near the Chesapeake Bay, to gently rolling hills of oak forests in the Piedmont Region, and pine groves in the Maryland mountains to the west.|$|E
25|$|The {{transitional}} {{climate of}} Delaware supports {{a wide variety}} of vegetation. In the northern third of the state are found Northeastern coastal forests and mixed oak forests typical of the northeastern United States. In the southern two-thirds of the state are found Middle Atlantic coastal forests. Trap Pond State Park, along with areas in other parts of Sussex County, for example, support the northernmost stands of <b>bald</b> <b>cypress</b> trees in North America.|$|E
25|$|According to the Köppen climate classification, Marlboro Township is {{considered}} to be in the Cfa zone. Marlboro Township has a humid sub-tropical climate placing it in Zone 7B on the USDA hardiness scale. This extends from Monmouth County, NJ to Northern Georgia. Because of its sheltered location and proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, some Palm trees can survive with minimal winter protection. Also, many Southern Magnolias, Crepe Myrtles, Musa Basjoo (Hardy Japanese Banana plants), native bamboo, native opuntia cactus, and <b>bald</b> <b>cypress</b> can be seen throughout commercial and private landscapes.|$|E
50|$|The most {{prominent}} physical {{feature of the}} campus was the central parking lot which was framed by a quadrangle of buildings. In 1998 the University of Indianapolis hired Odle McGuire Shook to re-purpose the 5.2 acres into green space and later named the area Smith Mall. The mall {{is made up of}} a circular sunken lawn, a recessed long canal, water gardens and the partial arc of an amphitheater. 80 <b>bald</b> <b>cypresses</b> were planted as part of the project.|$|R
50|$|Larch shoots are dimorphic, {{with leaves}} borne singly on long shoots {{typically}} 10-50 centimetres long and bearing several buds, and in dense clusters of 20-50 needles on short shoots only 1-2 mm long {{with only a}} single bud. The leaves are needle-like, 2-5 centimetres long, slender (under 1 cm wide). Larches are among the few deciduous conifers, which are mostly evergreen. Other deciduous conifers include the golden larch Pseudolarix amabilis, the dawn redwood Metasequoia glyptostroboides, the Chinese swamp cypress Glyptostrobus pensilis and the <b>bald</b> <b>cypresses</b> in the genus Taxodium.|$|R
50|$|The park {{features}} the lakeside walkways which was completed and opened to public in 2007 {{with a total}} distance of 1.4 km. There is also a nine-turn bridge. It houses various flora as well, such as willows, <b>bald</b> <b>cypresses,</b> cajeput trees, golden showers, royal poincianas, Chinese hibiscus, azaleas and Ixora westii. The park management center houses a 45-seating capacity reading room, tennis courts, swimming pool and other recreational facilities. Visitors can also fish and hike in its six mountain trails to choose from with rest pavilions along the way.|$|R
25|$|Sugar beet is an {{important}} source of sugar. Yam roots are a source of estrogen compounds used in birth control pills. The fish poison and insecticide rotenone is obtained from roots of Lonchocarpus spp. Important medicines from roots are ginseng, aconite, ipecac, gentian and reserpine. Several legumes that have nitrogen-fixing root nodules are used as green manure crops, which provide nitrogen fertilizer for other crops when plowed under. Specialized <b>bald</b> <b>cypress</b> roots, termed knees, are sold as souvenirs, lamp bases and carved into folk art. Native Americans used the flexible roots of white spruce for basketry.|$|E
25|$|The Hell Creek Formation, as {{typified by}} {{exposures}} in the Fort Peck area of Montana, {{has been interpreted}} as a flat forested floodplain, with a relatively dry subtropical climate that supported a variety of plants ranging from angiosperm trees, to conifers such as <b>bald</b> <b>cypress,</b> to ferns and ginkgos. The coastline was hundreds of kilometers or miles to the east. Stream-dwelling turtles and tree-dwelling multituberculate mammals were diverse, and monitor lizards {{as large as the}} modern Komodo dragon hunted on the ground. Triceratops was the most abundant large dinosaur, and Thescelosaurus the most abundant small herbivorous dinosaur. Edmontosaur remains have been collected here from stream channel sands, and include fossils from individuals as young as a meter- or yard-long infant. The edmontosaur fossils probably represent accumulations from groups on the move.|$|E
25|$|Several {{other reasons}} may cause the {{environment}} to be too extreme for trees to grow. This can include geothermal exposure associated with hot springs or volcanoes, such as at Yellowstone; high soil acidity near bogs; high salinity associated with playas or salt lakes; or ground that is saturated with groundwater that excludes oxygen from the soil, which most tree roots need for growth. The margins of muskegs and bogs are common examples {{of these types of}} open area. However, no such line exists for swamps, where trees, such as <b>Bald</b> <b>cypress</b> and the many mangrove species, have adapted to growing in permanently waterlogged soil. In some colder parts of the world there are tree lines around swamps, where there are no local tree species that can develop. There are also man-made pollution tree lines in weather-exposed areas, where new tree lines have developed because of the increased stress of pollution. Examples are found around Nikel in Russia and previously in the Erzgebirge.|$|E
5000|$|Several natural {{communities}} {{exist within}} the county, including areas of freshwater wetlands (dominated by <b>bald</b> <b>cypresses</b> and ferns), coastal mangrove swamps, sporadic hardwood hammocks (dominated by laurel oaks and live oaks, cabbage palms, and southern magnolias), low-lying, poorly drained pine flatwoods (dominated by longleaf pines and saw palmettos), and well-drained, upland sandhills (dominated by longleaf pines and turkey oaks) and sand pine scrub (dominated by sand pines, saw palmettos, and various oaks). Offshore ecosystems include the Tampa Bay estuary and numerous gulf seagrass beds. The county also maintains several artificial reefs ...|$|R

500|$|Though The Big Cypress is {{the largest}} growth of cypress swamps in South Florida, cypress swamps can be found near the Atlantic Coastal Ridge and between Lake Okeechobee and the Eastern flatwoods, {{as well as in}} sawgrass marshes. Cypresses are {{deciduous}} conifers that are uniquely adapted to thrive in flooded conditions, with buttressed trunks and root projections that protrude out of the water, called [...] "knees". <b>Bald</b> <b>cypress</b> trees grow in formations with the tallest and thickest trunks in the center, rooted in the deepest peat. As the peat thins out, cypresses grow smaller and thinner, giving the small forest the appearance of a dome from the outside. They also grow in strands, slightly elevated on a ridge of limestone bordered on either side by sloughs. Other hardwood trees can be found in cypress domes, such as red maple, swamp bay, and pop ash. If cypresses are removed, the hardwoods take over, and the ecosystem is recategorized as a mixed swamp forest.|$|E

500|$|Douglas began accruing honors {{since her}} early days writing for The Miami Herald. In the 1980s, however, the awards became more prestigious, and her {{reactions}} to them mixed. The Florida Department of Natural Resources (now the Florida Department of Environmental Protection) named {{its headquarters in}} Tallahassee after her in 1980, which she considered a dubious honor. She told a friend she would have rather seen the Everglades restored than her name on a building. During her polite acceptance speech, she railed against Ronald Reagan and the then-Secretary of the Interior James Watt for their lackluster approach to environmental conservation. The National Parks Conservation Association established the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Award in 1986, that [...] "honor(s) individuals who often must {{go to great lengths}} to advocate and fight for the protection of the National Park System". Despite blindness and diminished hearing, Douglas continued to be active into her second century, and was honored with a visit from Queen Elizabeth II, to whom Douglas gave a signed copy of The Everglades: River of Grass in 1991. Instead of gifts and celebrations, Douglas asked that trees be planted on her birthday, resulting in over 100,000 planted trees across the state and a <b>bald</b> <b>cypress</b> on the lawn of the governor's mansion. The South Florida Water Management District began removing exotic plants that had taken hold in the Everglades when Douglas turned 102.|$|E
50|$|Taxodium ascendens reaches {{on average}} 15 - 18 m in height.
