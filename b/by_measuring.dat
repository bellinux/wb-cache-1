5|$|As many {{symptoms}} {{of carbon monoxide}} poisoning also occur with many other types of poisonings and infections (such as the flu), the diagnosis is often difficult. A history of potential carbon monoxide exposure, such as being exposed to a residential fire, may suggest poisoning, but the diagnosis is confirmed <b>by</b> <b>measuring</b> the levels of carbon monoxide in the blood. This can be determined <b>by</b> <b>measuring</b> the amount of carboxyhemoglobin compared {{to the amount of}} hemoglobin in the blood.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} decade, CMB anisotropies were further investigated {{by a large}} number of ground-based and balloon experiments.

5|$|Initial asymmetries {{have also}} been {{confirmed}} in TypeIa supernovae through observation.

5|$|Using {{the stellar}} spectrum, astronomers can also {{determine}} the surface temperature, surface gravity, metallicity and rotational velocity of a star. If {{the distance of}} the star is found, such as <b>by</b> <b>measuring</b> the parallax, then the luminosity of the star can be derived. The mass, radius, surface gravity, and rotation period can then be estimated based on stellar models. (Mass can be calculated for stars in binary systems <b>by</b> <b>measuring</b> their orbital velocities and distances. Gravitational microlensing has been used to measure the mass of a single star.) With these parameters, astronomers can also estimate the age of the star.|$|E

5|$|An {{alignment}} {{is calculated}} <b>by</b> <b>measuring</b> the azimuth, the angle from north, {{of the structure}} and the altitude of the horizon it faces The azimuth is usually measured using a theodolite or a compass. A compass is easier to use, though the deviation of the Earth's magnetic field from true north, known as its magnetic declination {{must be taken into}} account. Compasses are also unreliable in areas prone to magnetic interference, such as sites being supported by scaffolding. Additionally a compass can only measure the azimuth to a precision of a half a degree.|$|E

5|$|Both NAD and NADH {{strongly}} absorb {{ultraviolet light}} {{because of the}} adenine. For example, peak absorption of NAD is at a wavelength of 259nanometers (nm), with an extinction coefficient of 16,900M−1cm−1. NADH also absorbs at higher wavelengths, with a second peak in UV absorption at 339nm with an extinction coefficient of 6,220M−1cm−1. This difference in the ultraviolet absorption spectra between the oxidized and reduced forms of the coenzymes at higher wavelengths makes it simple to measure the conversion of one to another in enzyme assays– <b>by</b> <b>measuring</b> the amount of UV absorption at 340nm using a spectrophotometer.|$|E
