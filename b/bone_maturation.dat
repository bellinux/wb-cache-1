40|$|In vitro {{evidence}} presently {{favors a}} direct osteolytic effect of biologically active vitamin D metabolites. Studies {{were designed to}} evaluate the effect of 25 -hydroxycholecalciferol (25 OHD 3) on bone collagen and mineral maturation in vivo and its dependence on parathyroid hormone (PTH). After treatment of sham-operated control and parathyroidectomized (PTX) mature rats with either 25 OHD 3 or an oil vehicle for 2 wk, tibial <b>bone</b> mineral-collagen <b>maturation</b> was quantitated by bromoform-toluene density gradient fractionation techniques. Intestinal calcium absorption was measured by in vivo 45 Ca transport procedures. In contrast to the control group, the response to 25 OHD 3 of PTX rats was dramatic. Bone mineral and matrix maturation were both accelerated by 25 OHD 3 treatment without concomitant reduction in total bone mineral or collagen content or changes in the intestinal calcium absorption. These observations support the premise that biologically active vitamin D metabolites stimulate <b>bone</b> tissue <b>maturation,</b> and that PTH is not required in this regard...|$|R
40|$|URL] The {{objective}} of this review article is to gather the relevant information on bone tissue and the validation and limitations of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. To this end, national and international studies indexed on the Pubmed, Lilacs and Nuteses databases were analyzed. The features discussed were: <b>bone</b> tissue <b>maturation,</b> <b>bone</b> tissue in different populations, the impact of intervention programs on bone tissue, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and its validation and limitations. According to data found in the literature, certain observations can be made. Bone mineral density changes during the different stages of life, childhood, adolescence, adulthood and old age; {{it can also be}} influenced by race, sex, genetic factors and life style in addition to by age. The importance of monitoring bone mineral density, both to good health and to social and economic aspects of society, is evident. Studies have confirmed the efficacy of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry for measuring body composition (bone, fat and muscle). However, in recent studies, although few in number, some limitations of using this equipment have been noted, which may affect its accuracy. It is therefore understood {{that there is a need}} for further studies into this subject, with the intention of defining the accuracy of this equipment...|$|R
40|$|Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) {{produces}} the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II. The ACE protein {{is composed of}} two homologous domains, each binding zinc and each independently catalytic. To assess the physiologic significance of the two ACE catalytic domains, we used gene targeting in mice to introduce two point mutations (H 395 K and H 399 K) that selectively inactivated the ACE N-terminal catalytic site. This modification does not affect C-terminal enzymatic activity or ACE protein expression. In addition, the testis ACE isozyme is not affected by the mutations. Analysis of homozygous mutant mice (termed ACE 7 / 7) showed normal plasma levels of angiotensin II but an elevation of plasma and urine N-acetyl-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro, a peptide suggested to inhibit <b>bone</b> marrow <b>maturation.</b> Despite this, ACE 7 /...|$|R

40|$|Biophysical {{stimulation}} {{to enhance}} bone fracture repair and <b>bone</b> regenerate <b>maturation</b> to restore its structural strength {{must rely on}} both the biological and biomechanical principle according to the local tissue environment {{and the type of}} mechanical stress to be born by the skeletal joint system. This paper reviews the possible interactions between biophysical stimuli and cellular responses in healing bone fractures and proceeds to speculate the prospects and limitations of different experimental models in evaluating and optimising such non-invasive interventions. It is important to realize that bone fracture repair has several pathways with various combinations of bone formation mechanisms, but there may only be one bone remodeling principle regulated by the hypothesis proposed by Wolff. There are different mechanical and biophysical stimuli that could provide effective augmentation of fracture healing and <b>bone</b> regenerate <b>maturation.</b> The key requirements of establishing these positive interactions are to define the precise cellular response to the stimulation signal in an in vitro environment and to use well-established animal models to quantify and optimise the therapeutic regimen in a time-dependent manner. This can only be achieved through research collaboration among different disciplines using scientific methodologies. In addition, the specific forms of biophysical stimulation and its dose effect and application timing must be carefully determined and validated. Technological advances in achieving focalized stimulus delivery with adjustable signal type and intensity, in the ability to monitor healing callus mechanical property non-invasively, and in the establishment of a robust knowledgebase to develop effective and reliable treatment protocols are the essential pre-requisites to make biophysical stimulation acceptable in the main arena of health care. Finally, it is important to bear in mind that successful fracture repair or bone regeneration through callus distraction without adequate remodeling process through physiological loading would seriously undermine the value of biophysical stimulation in meeting the biomechanical demand of a long bone...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The main {{bone age}} {{assessment}} methods are the Greulich-Pyle and Tanner-Whitehouse 2 methods, {{both of which}} involve left hand and wrist radiographs. Several other bone age assessment methods have been developed, including ultrasonographic, computerized, and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging methods. The ultrasonographic method appears unreliable in children with delayed and advanced bone age. MR imaging is noninvasive; however, bone age assessment using MR imaging is relatively new, and further examinations are needed. An automated method for determining bone age, named BoneXpert, has been validated for Caucasian children with growth disorders and children of various ethnic groups. Sex hormones are necessary for <b>bone</b> growth and <b>maturation</b> in children with a bone age corresponding to normal pubertal age, and estrogen is essential for growth plate closure. Bone age is an effective indicator for diagnosing and treating various diseases. A new method for adult height prediction based on bone age has been developed using BoneXpert, {{in addition to the}} commonly used Bayley-Pinneau and Tanner-Whitehouse mark II methods. Furthermore, bone age may become a predictor for the timing of peak height velocity and menarche. Key words: <b>bone</b> age, growth, <b>maturation,</b> prediction, adult heigh...|$|R
40|$|We have {{compared}} three treatments of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) for {{their effect on}} physical development. Thirteen girls and two boys with CAH due to 21 -hydroxylase deficiency were treated with three different treatments, hydrocortisone (HC), dexamethasone (DXM) and cyproterone acetate (CA). The results showed that height growth was better with HC and CA than DXM, and <b>bone</b> excessive <b>maturation</b> was more suppressed with DXM and CA than HC. A dose-dependent relationship was revealed between body weight and dose of HC. Iatrogenic obesity was found in 42. 9 % and 38. 1 % of the patients treated with DXM and HC, {{but none of the}} patients treated with CA did became obese. Physical growth was better with CA treatment than HC or DXM treatment, but CA may have a suppressive effect on the pituitary-adrenal axis observed carefully, especially on prepubertal and pubertal cases...|$|R
25|$|Estrogens are {{responsible}} for both the pubertal growth spurt, which causes an acceleration in linear growth, and epiphyseal closure, which limits height and limb length, in both females and males. In addition, estrogens {{are responsible}} for <b>bone</b> <b>maturation</b> and maintenance of bone mineral density throughout life. Due to hypoestrogenism, the risk of osteoporosis increases during menopause.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} {{goals of}} treatment of non-classical CAH are to preserve as much growth {{as possible and}} to prevent central precocious puberty if it has not already been triggered. These are more difficult challenges than in CAH detected in infancy because moderate levels of androgens will have had several years to advance <b>bone</b> <b>maturation</b> and to trigger central puberty before the disease is detected.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} severe side effects can occur if {{adolescents}} use AAS. For example, AAS may prematurely stop the lengthening of bones (premature epiphyseal fusion through {{increased levels of}} estrogen metabolites), resulting in stunted growth. Other effects include, {{but are not limited}} to, accelerated <b>bone</b> <b>maturation,</b> increased frequency and duration of erections, and premature sexual development. AAS use in adolescence is also correlated with poorer attitudes related to health.|$|E

Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is first generation platelet concentrate. However, the short duration of cytokine release and its poor mechanical properties have resulted in search of new material. Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) is a natural fibrin-based biomaterial prepared from an anticoagulant-free blood harvest without any artificial biochemical modification (no bovine thrombin is required) that allows obtaining fibrin membranes enriched with platelets and growth factors.

50|$|Growth disturbance: Children with JIA {{may have}} reduced overall rate of growth, {{especially}} if the disease involves many joints or other body systems. Paradoxically, individually affected large joints (such as the knee) may grow faster, due to inflammation-induced increased blood supply to the bone growth plates situated near the joints. This can result in leg length discrepancy, and also deformities such as genu valgum. Asymmetrical growth can also affect other bones e.g. discrepancy in digit length. Marked differences in <b>bone</b> age (skeletal <b>maturation)</b> may be seen.|$|R
25|$|However, a {{significant}} portion of testosterone in adolescent boys is converted to estradiol. Estradiol mediates the growth spurt, <b>bone</b> <b>maturation,</b> and epiphyseal closure in boys just as in girls. Estradiol also induces at least modest development of breast tissue (gynecomastia) in a large proportion of boys. Boys who develop mild gynecomastia or even developing swellings under nipples during puberty are told the effects are temporary in some male teenagers due to high levels of estradiol.|$|E
25|$|WR is {{associated}} with abnormalities in <b>bone</b> <b>maturation,</b> and lipids and hormone metabolism.

They have physical abnormalities including a large head (macrocephaly), sparse hair, prominent scalp veins, inward-folded eyelids, widened anterior fontanelles, hollow cheeks (malar hypoplasia), general loss of fat tissues under the skin, delayed tooth eruption, abnormal hair pattern, beaked noses, mild to severe mental retardation and dysmorphism.|$|E
25|$|Even {{congenital}} GH deficiency {{does not}} usually impair length growth {{until after the}} first few months of life. From late in the first year until mid teens, poor growth and/or shortness is the hallmark of childhood GH deficiency. Growth is not as severely affected in GH deficiency as in untreated hypothyroidism, but growth at about half the usual velocity for age is typical. It tends to be accompanied by delayed physical maturation so that <b>bone</b> <b>maturation</b> and puberty may be several years delayed. When severe GH deficiency is present from birth and never treated, adult heights can be as short as 48-65inches (122–165cm).|$|E
40|$|Severe {{congenital}} neutropenia (SCN) {{is a rare}} hematological disease {{characterized by}} a selective decrease in circulating neutrophils, <b>bone</b> marrow <b>maturation</b> arrest at the promyelocyte stage, and occurrence of infections. Studies of SCN patients revealed impaired proliferative characteristics and accelerated apoptosis of bone marrow progenitor cells. Sequencing analysis indicated a heterozygous deletion or substitution mutations in the neutrophil elastase (NE gene) in many patients. Expression of NE mutants but not normal NE accelerated apoptosis of human HL- 60 progenitor cells similar to that seen with actual patient cells. Our data indicate that impaired survival of bone marrow myeloid progenitor cells arises from expression of mutant NE which contributes to neutropenia in SCN. In an unusual clinical set of studies during which SCN developed in five children from four families impregnated by the same sperm donor, we identified the responsible donor by employing genomic DNA studies...|$|R
40|$|In B-cell development, {{expression}} of immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable-region (VH) gene repertoires {{is determined by}} genetic mechanisms that favor rearrangement of the most D-proximal genes, resulting in overutilization of the VH 7183 gene family early in ontogeny and in differentiating B cells of the adult <b>bone</b> marrow. <b>Maturation</b> {{of the immune system}} is accompanied by a decreased {{expression of}} VH 7183 genes in the peripheral immunocompetent B-cell pool of adult animals. By comparing VH gene family expression in the bone marrow (emergent) and peripheral (available and actual) B-cell repertoires of germ-free and conventionally raised BALB/c mice, we found that peripheral selection of VH gene family utilization does not occur in germ-free animals. Reconstitution of germ-free mice with normal serum immunoglobulins purified from syngeneic donors reestablishes selection of VH 7183 -expressing B cells. Our results indicate that preimmune B-cell repertoires are selected in normal animals by environmental antigens and serum immunoglobulins...|$|R

25|$|In {{recent years}} some newer {{approaches}} to optimizing growth have been researched and {{are beginning to}} be used. It is possible to reduce the effects of androgens on the body by blocking the receptors with an antiandrogen such as flutamide and by reducing the conversion of testosterone to estradiol. This conversion is mediated by aromatase and can be inhibited by aromatase blockers such as testolactone. Blocking the effects and conversions of estrogens will allow use of lower doses of glucocorticoids with less risk of acceleration of <b>bone</b> <b>maturation.</b> Other proposed interventions have included bilateral adrenalectomy to remove the androgen sources, or growth hormone treatment to enhance growth.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{challenging}} aspects of long-term management is optimizing growth {{so that a}} child with CAH achieves his or her height potential because both undertreatment and overtreatment can reduce growth or the remaining time for growth. While glucocorticoids are essential for health, dosing is always a matter of approximation. In even mildly excessive amounts, glucocorticoids slow growth. On the other hand, adrenal androgens are readily converted to estradiol, which accelerates <b>bone</b> <b>maturation</b> {{and can lead to}} early epiphyseal closure. This narrow target of optimal dose is made more difficult to obtain by the imperfect replication of normal diurnal plasma cortisol levels produced by 2 or 3 oral doses of hydrocortisone. As a consequence, average height losses of about 4inches (10cm) have been reported with traditional management.|$|E
25|$|The growth {{problem is}} even worse in the simple virilizing forms of CAH which are {{detected}} when premature pubic hair appears in childhood, because the bone age is often several years advanced {{at the age of}} diagnosis. While a boy (or girl) with simple virilizing CAH is taller than peers at that point, he will have far fewer years remaining to grow, and may go from being a very tall 7-year-old to a 62-inch 13-year-old who has completed growth. Even with adrenal suppression, many of these children will have already had central precocious puberty triggered by the prolonged exposure of the hypothalamus to the adrenal androgens and estrogens. If this has begun, it may be advantageous to suppress puberty with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist such as leuprolide to slow continuing <b>bone</b> <b>maturation.</b>|$|E
40|$|Our society, already {{obsessed with}} {{physical}} appearance and sporting success, has become inundated with {{reports of the}} effects and misuse of drugs that enhance athletic performance. These substances have tarnished the health, reputations, and records of many world-class athletes.

One of the most rapidly growing markets for anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS) comprises middle and high school-aged girls who value the appearance of muscle definition and reduced subcutaneous fat. The cardiac toxicities of AAS, stimulants, and other performance-enhancing drugs are well known [1, 2] and include sudden death, thromboembolic phenomena, cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmias. These drugs have also been implicated in stroke, seizures, and such adverse psychiatric conditions as anxiety, mood changes, and autonomic hyperactivity [3]. “Steroid rage ” has been cited {{as a cause of}} aberrant behavior in some adolescent males.
