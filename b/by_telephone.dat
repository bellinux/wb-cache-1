5000|$|In the mid-20th century, {{telephone}} communication across relatively short distances could be prohibitively expensive. Northern Milan township had traditionally been served <b>by</b> the Harlan <b>telephone</b> exchange, and southern Milan township by the New Haven telephone exchange. To {{make a call}} between differing exchanges, one could incur so-called [...] "long distance" [...] surcharges. Brueggemann's store at Milan Center served as a progressive business and community center <b>by</b> having <b>telephones</b> from both exchanges. The New Haven telephone exchange was purchased <b>by</b> the Home <b>Telephone</b> company in Fort Wayne, which was itself subsequently acquired <b>by</b> General <b>Telephone</b> of Indiana. The Harlan telephone company was also eventually acquired <b>by</b> General <b>Telephone</b> of Indiana. General Telephone is now a part of Verizon.|$|R

5|$|A {{laboratory}} {{is built}} into the rear wall, on the forts southern side. This room is set into the end of the rampart and was used to prepare gunpowder charges. A guardhouse was built at the manning parade's southern end in 1885.

Up to three men appear to have been accommodated in the guard's room. When the fort was converted to use as a caravan park the guard house was converted to an ablution block. A store and ablution block were also built in 1885 between the stockade and rear defence wall.|$|E
5|$|Cameron {{returned}} to Pomona, California and {{stayed at the}} home of science fiction writer Randall Frakes, where he wrote the draft for The Terminator. Cameron's influences included 1950s science fiction films, the 1960s fantasy television series The Outer Limits, and contemporary films such as The Driver (1978) and Mad Max 2 (1981). To translate the draft into a script, Cameron enlisted his friend Bill Wisher, who had a similar approach to storytelling. Cameron gave Wisher scenes involving Sarah Connor and the police department to write. As Wisher lived far from Cameron, the two communicated ideas by recording tapes of what they wrote <b>by</b> <b>telephone.</b> Frakes and Wisher would later write the US-released novelization of the movie.|$|E
5|$|High {{rainfall}} {{can cause}} widespread flooding, {{which can lead}} to landslides and mudflows in mountainous areas. Such floods cause rivers to burst their banks and submerge homes. The Ghaggar-Hakra River, which only flows during India's monsoon season, can flood and severely damage local crops. Floods can be exacerbated by fires during the previous dry season, which cause soils which are sandy or composed of loam to become hydrophobic, or water repellent. In various ways governments may help people deal with wet season floods. Flood plain mapping identifies which areas are more prone to flooding. Instructions on controlling erosion through outreach are also provided <b>by</b> <b>telephone</b> or the internet.|$|E
