40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} manner in which facts are proven with specific emphasis on the role which the concept of ‘probabilities’ plays in achieving the ‘burden of proof. It is illustrated that the concept of ‘probabilities’ plays a central role throughout the process of determining the accountability of a litigant, including fact-finding during the evaluation <b>of</b> the <b>adduced</b> <b>evidence</b> and the application <b>of</b> the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof. This study distinguishes between the findings of individual facts, as opposed to the finding of whether the case of a party, as reflected by the cumulative effect of the individually proven facts, has been proven. It is submitted that, despite traditionally perceived views, the concept of ‘probabilities’ is applied in exactly the same manner to both these aspects of a legal dispute, the only variable being the degree of probabilities as determined by a specific stage and nature of the litigation. The research focuses on both criminal and civil cases. The dissertation is based on current South African practices as reflected in judgments in different law reports and, to some extent, on English and American legal practices.

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that sequence-selective DNA-binding antibiotics locate their preferred binding sites {{by a process}} involving migration from nonspecific sites has been tested by footprinting with DNAase I. Footprinting patterns on the tyrT DNA fragment produced by nogalamycin and actinomycin change with time after mixing the antibiotic with the DNA. Sites of protection as well as enhanced cleavage are seen to develop in a fashion which is both temperature and concentration-dependent. At certain sites cutting is transiently enhanced, then blocked. Limited evidence for slow reaction with echinomycin and mithramycin is presented, but the kinetics of footprinting with daunomycin and distamycin appear instantaneous. The feasibility <b>of</b> <b>adducing</b> direct <b>evidence</b> for shuffling by footprinting seems to be governed by slow dissociation of the antibiotic-DNA complex.

2500|$|Objectivist {{epistemology}} {{maintains that}} all knowledge is ultimately based on perception. [...] "Percepts, not sensations, are the given, the self-evident." [...] Rand considered {{the validity of}} the senses to be axiomatic, and claimed that purported arguments to the contrary all commit the fallacy of the [...] "stolen concept" [...] by presupposing the validity of concepts that, in turn, presuppose {{the validity of the}} senses. She held that perception, being physiologically determined, is incapable of error. For example, optical illusions are errors in the conceptual identification of what is seen, not errors in sight itself. The validity of sense perception, therefore, is not susceptible to proof (because it is presupposed by all proof as proof is only a matter <b>of</b> <b>adducing</b> sensory <b>evidence)</b> nor should its validity be denied (since the conceptual tools one would have to use to do this are derived from sensory data). Perceptual error, therefore, is not possible. Rand consequently rejected epistemological skepticism, as she holds that the skeptics' claim to knowledge [...] "distorted" [...] by the form or the means of perception is impossible.|$|R

40|$|We aim {{to build}} {{intelligent}} systems which can reason autonomously {{about the risk}} of carcinogenicity of chemicals, drawing on whatever theoretical or experimental evidence is available.

Because the research which underpins conclusions in this domain is usually at the leading-edge of the scientific disciplines concerned, evidence from these different sources may be inconsistent or conflicting. Consequently, carcinogen risk assessment usu-ally involves the comparison and resolution of multiple evidences and arguments for and against a particular scientific claim [23, 27].

40|$|The crux of an {{adversarial}} system as practiced in Malaysian courts is the <b>adducing</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> through the oral tradition. This usually involves examinations in three stages. A direct examination is {{conducted by the}} party that initiates the action, while a cross examination is {{carried out by the}} opposing side. In the event where a re-examination is necessary, the initiating party can re-examine his witness to ‘repair’ the damage done during the cross-examination. Institutionalized courtroom questioning involves questions posed by the lawyers with the answers to be provided for by the witnesses.

25|$|Sanity is a rebuttable {{presumption}} and the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof {{is on the}} party denying it; the standard of proof is on a balance of probabilities, {{that is to say}} that mental incapacity is more likely than not. If this burden is successfully discharged, the party relying upon it is entitled to succeed. In Lord Denning's judgement in Bratty v Attorney-General for Northern Ireland 1963 AC 386, whenever the defendant makes an issue of his state of mind, the prosecution can <b>adduce</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> insanity. However, this will normally only arise to negate the defence case when automatism or diminished responsibility is in issue. In practical terms, the defence {{will be more likely to}} raise the issue of mental incapacity to negate or minimise criminal liability. In R v Clarke 1972 1 All E R 219 a defendant charged with a shoplifting claimed she had no mens rea because she had absent-mindedly walked out of the shop without paying because she suffered from depression. When the prosecution attempted to <b>adduce</b> <b>evidence</b> that this constituted insanity within the Rules, she changed her plea to guilty, but on appeal the Court ruled that she had been merely denying mens rea rather than raising a defence under the Rules and her conviction was quashed. The general rule was stated that the Rules apply only to cases in which the defect of reason is substantial.|$|R

The court hearing such a bail application, when the offence is a Schedule 5 or 6 offence, must conduct a careful enquiry before deciding to release the accused on bail.

40|$|Nicotinic {{acetylcholine}} (nACh) and 5 -hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5 -HT 3) receptors are cation-selective ion {{channels of}} the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (pLGIC) superfamily. Multiple lines <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>adduced</b> {{over the last}} 30 years indicate that {{the lining of the}} channel of such receptors is formed by the α-helical second transmembrane (TM 2) domain and flanking sequences contributed by each of the five subunits present within the receptor complex. Specific amino acid residues within, and adjacent to, the TM 2 domain influence single channel conductance, ion selectivity, and other aspects of receptor function that include gating and desensitization. However, more recent work has revealed important structural determinants of single channel conductance and ion selectivity that are not associated with the TM 2 domain. Direct experimental evidence indicates that the intracellular domain of eukaryotic pLGICs, in particular a region of the loop linking TM 3 and TM 4 termed the membrane-associated (MA) stretch, exerts a strong influence upon ion channel biophysics. Moreover, recent computational approaches, complemented by experimentation, implicate the extracellular domain as an additional important determinant of ion conduction.

By making a rigorous distinction between 'growth cessation' and the phenomena of 'cell cycle exit' or 'G 1 -phase arrest', the evidence for the G 1 -phase-specific phosphorylation of Rb protein is reinterpreted.

Shamdasani's letter to Noll of 29 July 1992 and Princeton University Press editor Eric Rohmann's fax to Shamdasani dated 11 March 1994 in the Cummings archives document this.
