5000|$|<b>Body</b> <b>shopping</b> is the {{practice}} of consultancy firms recruiting workers (generally in information technology sector) in order to contract their services out on tactical short to mid-term basis. IT services companies that practice <b>body</b> <b>shopping</b> assert that they provide real services (such as software development) rather than the [...] "sham" [...] of merely farming out professionals to overseas companies.|$|E

They then discuss the implications of The <b>Body</b> <b>Shop's</b> reorganization, brand repositioning and the L'Oréal takeover, and what the future might hold for The <b>Body</b> <b>Shop.</b> The <b>Body</b> <b>Shop</b> has gradually professionalized its approach and has also persevered with various social projects {{in the face of}} fierce criticism. With the reorganization, brand repositioning and the L'Oréal takeover, The <b>Body</b> <b>Shop</b> appears to have averted the risk of sustained erosion of its market share. After the reorganization, The <b>Body</b> <b>Shop's</b> management attention assumed more business and commercial aspects and less of a pioneering role in corporate social responsibility (CSR). The question now is whether The <b>Body</b> <b>Shop</b> will continue in the future to be viewed by customers as distinct from competitors, who have slowly also become more active in CSR. The history of The <b>Body</b> <b>Shop</b> has gone through three phases: rise, fall and recovery. The company's recovery is not a repetition of the early period, but a transformation, in which the ideals of old have been tempered by the hard business lessons of the fall. The <b>Body</b> <b>Shop's</b> new style is a synthesis of the previous two phases...|$|R

This study aims to test this connection, when CSR is well known, by answering the following problem question: What are the opinions and attitudes among The <b>Body</b> <b>Shop</b> Umeå's visitors towards The <b>Body</b> <b>Shop</b> and CSR, {{and how do they}} perceive the company regarding CSR? Are their purchase decisions affected by these opinions and attitudes? Purpose To explore the importance of a well-known CSR; to find what attitudes consumers have towards CSR and a company with well-known CSR, and to look at these attitudes' relation to the consumers' purchase decision. Methodology A quantitative, deductive study is conducted, where the theory is tested. The data is collected by handing out self-completion questionnaires to The <b>Body</b> <b>Shop</b> visitors in Umeå. Results & Conclusion This study shows that The <b>Body</b> <b>Shop</b> visitors in Umeå think that CSR is important when buying cosmetics. The respondents have positive attitudes towards The <b>Body</b> <b>Shop</b> and these positive attitudes can be connected to The <b>Body</b> <b>Shop's</b> CSR. The positive attitudes can also be connected to positive purchase decisions. A conclusion that can be drawn from these findings is that well known CSR can be connected to positive purchase decisions, if the CSR is trustworthy. This conclusion can, however, only be generalized to the population for this study; the visitors to The <b>Body</b> <b>Shop's</b> store in Umeå. Number of Pages 57 Number of References 4...|$|R

Furthermore, it influences other companies, which are not only in the cosmetic industry, but also in industries as retail industry, transportation industry and so on. However, most of the articles and journals only consider The <b>Body</b> <b>Shop</b> as an example of ethical business model but lack of in-depth analysis of the motivation behind its CSR strategies. In addition, there are few in-depth research papers to analyse The <b>Body</b> <b>Shop</b> performance after it was acquired by LÃ�Â�Ã�Â�Ã�Â�Ã�Â¢Ã�Â�Ã�Â�Ã�Â�Ã�Â�Ã�Â�Ã�Â�Ã�Â�Ã�Â�Oreal.

40|$|This {{research}} {{is based on}} social marketing and branding theories. The aim of the {{research is}} to find out which has been the reception of The <b>Body</b> <b>Shop</b> brand in Estonia. <b>Body</b> <b>Shop</b> is the object of this research and is handled as a spirited brand. The notion “spirited brand” cues to a research of Marjorie Thompson and Hamish Pringle and their book Brand Spirit. How Cause Related Marketing Builds Brands (2003). Author of this work set up three main research-questions and during the research found out the answers. Qualitative methods were used to reach the goals of this work. Author carried out three interviews with experts and seven with consumers. Furthermore, the qualitative inner-analyses of media texts and Internet forums were carried out to reach the best results. Research questions and goals were the basis to carry out interviews. To conclude the main results originating from the research-questions one may say that <b>Body</b> <b>Shop</b> as a brand with spirit and several social values has been accepted positively in Estonia. But not only because of its social values, but mainly because of the brand itself, the atmosphere of shops and the smell of products. Social dimension comes about thirdly when one must say the queue of the reason to consume The <b>Body</b> <b>Shop.</b> Remarkable is that <b>Body</b> <b>Shop</b> values are known quite well among the consumers, although the company does not provide any commercial. And in Estonia commercial-culture is quite broad, people have used to see and hear a lot of commercial. And although social marketing in Estonia is quite new topic the research found out that the more campaigns there is and the more media and experts introduce social marketing related to business, the more people are interested of it and the more they care about community and social values provided. It is the question of public opinion and public attention. The motives of The <b>Body</b> <b>Shop</b> consuming are more related to status and trends than social values. It was said that although people would want to buy the products that support some social problems, <b>Body</b> <b>Shop</b> products are expensive enough to prefer some other companies, although they may do animal testing or not to be as planet- protecting as <b>Body</b> <b>Shop.</b> At the same time when some people say the products are too expensive, there is a group of loyal customers who say the knew <b>Body</b> <b>Shop</b> long before it came to Estonia. These people say they admire <b>Body</b> <b>Shop</b> as a cosmetic-brand as well as social-values pioneer in business. To conclude the main results originating from the research-questions one may say that <b>Body</b> <b>Shop</b> as a brand with spirit and several social values has been accepted positively in Estonia.

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore the {{organizational}} culture within the corporation The <b>Body</b> <b>Shop.</b> I have been working with two different question formulations. The first is to answer how the culture can be described. To answer this I have been using Edgar H. Scheins theory of cultural levels. I have been using the two lower levels, artifacts and espoused values. The second question formulation is to answer how the culture within The <b>Body</b> <b>Shop</b> can be reproduced. To my help to answer this I have been using John Van Maanens theory of strategies for socialization. I have been working with a qualitative approach. My data was collected through interviews, observations, printed texts and The <b>Body</b> <b>Shops</b> Swedish and global websites. My results using Scheins cultural levels points out that the culture within The <b>Body</b> <b>Shop,</b> at least outwards, is strong and distinct. The implementation of Van Maanens strategies of socialization indicates that the socialization of new members in the organization tends to have a high congruence with the organization´s culture and values.  Sammanfattning Syftet med den här studien är att undersöka kulturen inom företaget The <b>Body</b> <b>Shop.</b> Jag har arbetat utifrån två frågeställningar. Den första är att besvara hur kulturen kan beskrivas med hjälp av Edgar H. Scheins kulturnivåer. Den andra frågeställningen är att besvara hur kulturen reproduceras med hjälp av John Van Maanens socialisationsstrategier. Studien har gjorts med en kvalitativ ansats. Det insamlade datamaterialet består av två intervjuer med butikschefer inom The <b>Body</b> <b>Shop,</b> tryckta källor samt företagets svenska och globala hemsidor. Beskrivningen av kulturen inom The <b>Body</b> <b>Shop</b> är gjord utifrån Scheins två första kulturnivåer, artefakter och värderingar. Tillämpningen av Van Maanens socialisations­strategier har visat att kulturen inom The <b>Body</b> <b>Shop</b> reproduceras genom socialisationen av nyanställda butiksmedarbetare. Mina resultat tyder på att The <b>Body</b> <b>Shop</b> utåt sett har en tydlig och stark kultur. Resultaten tyder också på att de sätt man socialiserar nyanställda på medför att dessa genom socialisationen uppnår en hög överensstämmelse med företagets kultur och värderingar...|$|R
