50|$|In 1704, {{at the age}} of 36, he {{returned}} to London, and helped to obtain an act of Parliament giving a <b>bounty</b> <b>on</b> the <b>importation</b> of tar from the colonies. He carried on business for some time. During the War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1714) he commanded a merchant ship and acquired the epithet of captain. In 1712 he obtained a role in Trinity House, Deptford, a private corporation that combined public responsibilities with charitable purposes. In 1717, he unsuccessfully promoted the idea of founding a colony to be called 'Georgia' in what is today Maine as a philanthropic venture. In 1719 he was stranded off Cuxhaven, when sailing for Hamburg in the Sea Flower, and the ship was plundered by the neighbouring inhabitants.|$|R

Gabell {{was born}} at Winchester in 1764, and was elected a scholar of Winchester College in 1779, and {{subsequently}} of New College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 11 Oct. 1782; graduated B.A. on 8 July 1786; and held a fellowship from 1782 to 1790. Soon afterwards he was appointed master of Warminster School, where he had twenty boys to teach, with a salary of 30l., and liberty to take private pupils. He {{was presented to the}} rectory of St. Lawrence, Winchester, in 1788, and was appointed second master of Winchester College in 1793. He graduated M.A. at Cambridge University in 1807; succeeded Dr. Goddard as head-master of Winchester College in 1810; was presented to the rectory of Ashow, Warwickshire, in 1812, and that of Binfield, Berkshire, in 1820; resigned the head-mastership of Winchester College in December 1823, receiving a present of plate richly engraved from the scholars. He continued to hold the three livings of Binfield, Ashow, and St. Lawrence until his death, which took place at Binfield on 18 April 1831. Gabell married, on 11 Jan. 1790, Miss Gage, the daughter of a clergyman of Holton, Oxfordshire. Their third daughter, Maria, married, on 18 July 1818, the Rev. William Scott, Rector of Aldridge, Staffordshire, the second son of Sir Joseph Scott, bart., of Great Barr Hall, Staffordshire. Gabell was a friend and correspondent of Dr. Parr, in the seventh volume of whose works some letters of his on points of classical scholarship will be found. He published: 1. A pamphlet entitled ‘On the Expediency of Altering and Amending the Regulations recommended by Parliament for Reducing the High Price of Corn: and of Extending the <b>Bounty</b> <b>on</b> the <b>Importation</b> of Wheat and other Articles of Provision,’ London, 1796, 8vo. 2.

In 1785 he became the last Speaker of the Irish House of Commons.|$|R
