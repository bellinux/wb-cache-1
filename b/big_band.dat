50|$|By 1981, WNEW {{focused on}} album cuts by <b>big</b> <b>bands</b> and {{standards}} artists. The morning show focused on more hit based easy listening standards with some <b>big</b> <b>bands</b> mixed in.

Afternoons focused on a mix of deep cuts by vocalists along with some <b>big</b> <b>bands.</b> Late nights emphasised traditional jazz. WNEW continued this focus through the 1980s. On overnights, WNEW launched a jazz show in 1986, blending traditional, modern, and smooth jazz.|$|R
50|$|<b>Big</b> <b>bands</b> {{maintained}} a presence on American television, particularly through the late-night talk show, which has historically used <b>big</b> <b>bands</b> as house accompaniment.

50|$|One {{unexpected}} {{result of}} the strike was {{the decline of the}} importance in popular music of the <b>big</b> <b>bands</b> of the 1930s and early 1940s. The strike was not the only cause of this decline, but it emphasized the shift from <b>big</b> <b>bands</b> with an accompanying vocalist to an emphasis on the vocalist, with the exclusion of the band. In the 1930s and pre-strike 1940s, <b>big</b> <b>bands</b> dominated popular music; after the strike, vocalists dominated popular music.|$|R
50|$|WNEW {{remained}} an adult contemporary station throughout the 1970s, while the station opted {{to return to}} its roots as a pop standards station in 1976, reinstating Milkman's Matinee on overnights.

Later in the fall, the station was <b>big</b> <b>bands</b> and standards full-time with the exception of morning and afternoon drive times.
