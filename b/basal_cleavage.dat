25|$|As {{cleavage}} is {{a function}} of crystallography, {{there are a variety of}} cleavage types. Cleavage occurs typically in either one, two, three, four, or six directions. <b>Basal</b> <b>cleavage</b> in one direction is a distinctive property of the micas. Two-directional cleavage is described as prismatic, and occurs in minerals such as the amphiboles and pyroxenes. Minerals such as galena or halite have cubic (or isometric) cleavage in three directions, at 90°; when three directions of cleavage are present, but not at 90°, such as in calcite or rhodochrosite, it is termed rhombohedral cleavage. Octahedral cleavage (four directions) is present in fluorite and diamond, and sphalerite has six-directional dodecahedral cleavage.|$|E
25|$|Phyllosilicates {{consist of}} sheets of {{polymerized}} tetrahedra. They are bound at three oxygen sites, which gives a characteristic silicon:oxygen ratio of 2:5. Important {{examples include the}} mica, chlorite, and the kaolinite-serpentine groups. The sheets are weakly bound by van der Waals forces or hydrogen bonds, which causes a crystallographic weakness, in turn leading to a prominent <b>basal</b> <b>cleavage</b> among the phyllosilicates. In addition to the tetrahedra, phyllosilicates have a sheet of octahedra (elements in six-fold coordination by oxygen) that balanced out the basic tetrahedra, which have a negative charge (e.g. 4−) These tetrahedra (T) and octahedra (O) sheets are stacked {{in a variety of}} combinations to create phyllosilicate groups. Within an octahedral sheet, there are three octahedral sites in a unit structure; however, not all of the sites may be occupied. In that case, the mineral is termed dioctahedral, whereas in other case it is termed trioctahedral.|$|E
2500|$|By definition, {{minerals}} have {{a characteristic}} atomic arrangement. Weakness in this crystalline structure causes planes of weakness, and the breakage of a mineral along such planes is termed cleavage. The quality of cleavage {{can be described}} based on how cleanly and easily the mineral breaks; common descriptors, in order of decreasing quality, are [...] "perfect", [...] "good", [...] "distinct", and [...] "poor". In particularly transparent mineral, or in thin-section, cleavage can be seen a series of parallel lines marking the planar surfaces when viewed at a side. Cleavage is not a universal property among minerals; for example, quartz, consisting of extensively interconnected silica tetrahedra, {{does not have a}} crystallographic weakness which would allow it to cleave. In contrast, micas, which have perfect <b>basal</b> <b>cleavage,</b> consist of sheets of silica tetrahedra which are very weakly held together.|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] The microtextural {{changes in}} the kaolinization of primary phyllosilicates {{including}} biotite, sericite, clinochlore and muscovite were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and micro-chemical analysis of thin sections of weathered anorthosite. Kaolinization began at grain edges and propagated toward the interior. Grains were highly fanned out from the edges and exfoliated into several flakes along the <b>basal</b> <b>cleavages,</b> producing lenticular voids. Finally, long vermicular kaolinite pseudo-morphs were formed after primary phyllosilicates. Statistical analysis showed a ninefold increase in volume during the kaolinization of biotite, suggesting that most A 1 in the kaolinite was imported from ambient weathering solution. Weathering primary phyllosilicates supplied templates suitable for the thick epitactic overgrowth of kaolinite to form long vermicular pseudomorphs. A 1 was sufficiently available due to the intense weathering of soluble anorthosite. Although present in small amounts, primary phyl-losilicates gave high volumetric and mineralogical contributions tothe weathering profiles by facilitating kaolinite precipitation...|$|R

40|$|The <b>basal</b> plane <b>cleavage</b> energy (CE) of {{graphite}} {{is a key}} material parameter {{for understanding}} many of the unusual properties of graphite, graphene, and carbon nanotubes. The CE is equal to twice the surface energy and {{is closely related to}} the interlayer binding energy and exfoliation energy of graphite. Nonetheless, a wide range of values for these properties have been reported and no consensus has yet emerged as to their magnitude. Here, we report the first direct, accurate experimental measurement of the CE of graphite using a novel method based on the recently discovered self-retraction phenomenon in graphite. The measured value, 0. 37 +/- 0. 01 J/m 2 for the incommensurate state of bicrystal graphite, is nearly invariant with respect to temperature (from 22 C to 198 C) and bicrystal twist angle, and insensitive to impurities (from the atmosphere). The cleavage energy for the ideal ABAB graphite stacking, 0. 39 +/- 0. 02 J/m 2, is calculated based upon a combination of the measured CE and a theoretical calculation.

40|$|We present microfabrics in high-pressure, metamorphic, partly serpentinized {{peridotite}} mylonites {{from the}} Voltri Massif, in which porphyroclasts and matrix record independent deformation events. The microfabrics are analysed using polarization microscopy and electron microscopy (SEM/EBSD, EMP). The mylonites contain diopside and olivine porphyroclasts originating from the mantle protolith {{embedded in a}} fine-grained matrix consisting mainly of antigorite and minor olivine and pyroxene. The porphyroclasts record brittle and crystal-plastic deformation of the peridotite at upper-mantle conditions and differential stresses {{of a few hundred}} MPa. After the peridotites became serpentinized, deformation occurred mainly by dissolution–precipitation creep resulting in a pronounced foliation of the antigorite matrix, crenulation cleavages and newly precipitated olivine and pyroxene from the pore fluid at sites of dilation, i. e. in strain shadows next to porphyroclasts and folded fine-grained antigorite layers. Antigorite reveals a pronounced associated shape preferred orientation (SPO) and crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) with the <b>basal</b> (001) <b>cleavage</b> plane oriented in the foliation plane. In monomineralic antigorite aggregates at sites of stress concentration around porphyroclasts, a characteristically reduced grain size and deflecting CPO as well as sutured grain boundaries indicate also some contribution of crystal-plastic deformation and grain-boundary migration of antigorite. In contrast, the absence of any intragranular deformation features in newly precipitated olivine in strain shadows reveals that stresses were not sufficiently high to allow for significant dislocation creep of olivine at conditions at which antigorite is stable. The porphyroclast microstructures are not associated with the microstructures of the mylonitic matrix, but are inherited from an independent earlier deformation. The porphyroclasts record a high-stress deformation of the peridotite with dislocation creep of olivine in the upper mantle probably related to rifting processes, whereas the serpentinite matrix records dominantly dissolution–precipitation creep and low stresses during subduction and exhumation...|$|R

40|$|Preadipocyte factor 1 (Pref- 1), an {{epidermal}} {{growth factor}} repeat containing transmembrane protein found in the preadipocytes, inhibits adipocyte differentiation in vitro and in vivo. Here, we examined the processing of membrane form of Pref- 1 A to release the 50 -kDa soluble form that inhibits adipocyte differentiation. The ectodomain cleavage of Pref- 1 is markedly enhanced by phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The <b>basal</b> and stimulated <b>cleavage</b> is inhibited by the broad metalloproteinase inhibitor GM 6001, a fact that suggests that cleavage of membrane Pref- 1 A is dependent on a metalloproteinase. Next, we showed that release of soluble Pref- 1 A is inhibited by TAPI- 0 and by a tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase- 3, TIMP- 3, that can inhibit tumor necrosis factor alpha converting enzyme (TACE), but not by TIMP- 1 or TIMP- 2. On the other hand, overexpression of TACE increases Pref- 1 cleavage to produce the 50 -kDa soluble form. Furthermore, this cleavage was not detected in cells with TACE mutation or with TACE small interfering RNA. TACE-mediated shedding of Pref- 1 ectodomain inhibits adipocyte differentiation of 3 T 3 -L 1 cells and in Pref- 1 -null mouse embryo fibroblasts transduced with Pref- 1 A. Identification of TACE as the major protease responsible for conversion of membrane-bound Pref- 1 to the biologically active diffusible form provides a new insight into Pref- 1 function in adipocyte differentiation...|$|R
40|$|The fine {{structure}} of cleavage, blastula, and gastrula stages of Fundulus heteroclitus was investigated. Cleavage blastomeres arc relatively unspccialized, containing few or poorly developcd organelles. Beginning in blastula stages, signs of differentiation were noted, including {{development of the}} cndoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus and appearance of a primary nucleolus and polyribosomcs. More extensive structural specializations occur in gastrula stages, including further development of the endoplasmic reticulum and appearance of a granular component in the nucleolus. These changes are associated with cell differentiation and an increascd capacity for protein synthesis, and may bc preparatory to subsequent histogenesis. The periblast is a continuous syncytial cytoplasmic laycr located between the blastodisc and yolk and is formed during late cleavage by incomplete division of the cytoplasm of the blastodisc. Cytoplasmic projections extend from the periblast (and from the <b>basal</b> region of <b>cleavage</b> blastomercs prior to formation of the periblast) into the yolk and function in uptake of yolk material {{in the absence of}} pinocytosis.
