40|$|Choana atresia is a {{congenital}} abnormality of the posterior nasal apertures affecting the newborn. The aetiology {{is considered to}} be a persistence of the embroyological <b>bucconasal</b> <b>membrane</b> which separates the nasal cavity from the stomatodeum until it breaks down at seventh week, allowing communication through the primitive posterior nares. Bilateral choanal atresia almost always present as a respiratory emergency because newborn babies are obligate nasal breathers. The definitive surgical treatment is repair under general anaesthesia. We report our experience in doing a new technique of transnasal endoscopic repair...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of the olfactory organ in the prenatal stages of mice (Patch/normal Balb/c) was studied. Eight stages were selected for this study; they are 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16 and 18 days of gestation. At 9 days of gestation, the olfactory placodes begin to appear as two thickenings of epidermis, latero-ventral to the prosencepha-lon. At 10 days, the primary choanae appear; each lies between the lateral and medial nasal swellings. At 11 days, the epithelia of these swellings fuse (closing the primary choanae) to form the nasal fin. This fin is mostly regressed and becomes replaced by mesenchymal cells except in its most posterior part to form the <b>bucconasal</b> <b>membrane.</b> As development proceeds and at 12 days, the secondary choanae are formed. At 11 days, the epithelium of the middle septal region evaginates to form the vomeronasal organ which is kidney-shaped. At 16 days and thereafter, this organ becomes seperated from its cartilagenous envelope by {{a thick layer of}} cavernous tissue and the vomeronasal glands appear. At 12 days, the lateral nasal epithelium evanigates into the lateral nasal wall to form the middle meatus. In addition, and at 14 days, there are two evaginations from the lateral nasal epithelium; the ethmoidal recesses and the maxillary recesses. Unlike the maxillary recesses, the ethmoidal recesses possess no glandular elements in their submucosa. The different nasal glands occupy most of the respiratory area. The glands of the lateral and medial nasal walls develop in a different chronological sequence. The lateral glands progress faster and more extensive than the septal glandular system. تمت دراسة التطور الجيني لعضو الشم في المراحل الجنينية للفئران (Patch Balb/c x ‏طبيعي). واختيرت ثمانية أطوار لهذه الدراسة وهي عمر 18, 16, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9 يوما من فترة الحمل. ‏تبدأ الحرشفة الشمية في الظهور في اليوم التاسع من فترة الحمل كجزء سميك من البشرة ، وفي اليوم العاشر تظهر فتحة الأنف الداخلية الأولية حيث يتم قفلها في اليوم الحادي عشر لتكون الزعنفة الأنفية. ثم تضمحل غالبية هذه الزعنفة تدريجيا ومحل محلها خلايا ميزنشيمية فيما عدا الجزء الخلفي منها لتكون الغشاء الانفي الغمي وعنده تتكون فتحة الأنف الداخلية الثانوية في اليوم الثاني عشر. ‏تنبعج طلائية منطقة وسط الحاجز الأنفي المتوسط في اليوم الحادي عشر من فترة الحمل لتكون عضو ميكعي أنفي كلوي الشكل ثم ينفصل هذا العضو عن غطائه الغضروفي اليوم السادس عشر بواسطة طبقة سميكة من نسيج متكهف. ‏تنبعج طلائية جدار الأنف الجانبية مكونة صماخ أوسط كما يوجد انبعاجين من الجدار الأنفي الجانبي وهما الفجوة المصفوية والفجوة الفكية وتحتوي الأخيرة على عناصر غدية بينما لا تحتوي الأولي على هذه العناصر. ‏تشغل مختلف الغدد الأنفية معظم المنطقة التنفسية للجدار الأنفي وتنمو الغدد الجانبية أسرع وبطريقة مكثفة عن الغدد الوسطية للحاجز الأنفي الأوسط...|$|E
40|$|Article Outline: A 6 -month-old term infant was {{referred}} {{with a history}} of snuffly breathing and obstructive sleep-disturbed breathing unless she was postured upright. From birth she had had daily right-sided rhinorrhea, which was mostly grayish and of egg-white consistency. It had not responded to antibiotics or intranasal steroids. Feeding was slow but weight gain was normal. Perinatal history was unremarkable, with cigarette smoking 4 per week the only potential teratogen identified. Clinical examination showed a left unilateral middle ear effusion, a left preauricular sinus, a bifid tip of uvula, and ankyloglossia. Flexible transnasal endoscopy demonstrated a pale skin-covered finger-like projection, arising from the left lateral nasopharyngeal wall in close proximity to the Eustachian tube, crossing to the contralateral side. CT showed patent bony choanae bilaterally with a 9 × 7 -mm soft tissue density superior to the soft palate. MRI (T 2 weighting and T 1 fat saturation, pre- and postcontrast) showed a 7 -mm-diameter lesion projecting 12. 5 mm into the pharynx. It was separate to the left internal carotid artery, with slight contrast enhancement. The absence {{of a wide range of}} signal intensities and the ordered structure suggested teratoma unlikely. There appeared to be a cord-like extension with concentric ring structure immediately adjacent to the Eustachian tube, to the skull base postero-inferior to the Eustachian tube. Under general anesthesia a combined transnasal and retropalatal endoscopic approach was commenced. The attachment of the lesion to the mucosa of the anterior aspect of the Eustachian tube was needle-point diathermy-divided under vision and then with steady traction using non-thru-cut forceps the lesion was avulsed from its origin in the postero-inferior aspect of the lower third of the Eustachian tube, and delivered transorally. After removal the size of the left Eustachian tube orifice was seen to be 4 to 5 times that of the right (Fig 1 - Dilated Eustachian tube orifice after removal of hairy polyp). The operative procedure was uncomplicated. The left unilateral mucoid effusion was aspirated. Histopathology demonstrated a 15 × 7 × 7 -mm polypoid lesion covered by epidermis with associated adnexae (hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and eccrine glands) overlying a core of fibroadipose tissue with minor salivary glands and skeletal muscle. This was characterized as a “hairy polyp of the Eustachian tube. ” At general anesthetic for division of the ankyloglossia 5 months postexcision there was no recurrence of either the lesion or the middle ear effusion, and the orifice of the Eustachian tube had shrunk so as to be only a little larger than the contralateral side. Discussion: “Hairy polyp of the nasopharynx” is a clinico-pathological descriptive term. The clinical description derives from macroscopically visible fine hairs arising from the pale external covering of skin (Fig 2 - Hairy polyp of the Eustachian tube). At flexible or rigid transnasal or retropalatal endoscopy they typically appear as a sausage-like lesion projecting medially across the nasopharynx. Up to 2004, 114 cases of hairy polyp of the nasopharynx had been described, most arising from the lateral pharyngeal wall. Origin specifically from the Eustachian tube was thought to be excessively rare but it is quite possible that increasing use of nasal endoscopes before and after removal will show that origin from within the lower end of the Eustachian tube is more common than previously thought. It is presumably this origin that resulted in dilation of the developing cartilaginous Eustachian tube; and removal of the hairy polyp allowed remodeling towards a normal size. They most commonly present early in the first year, with a female preponderance up to 6 : 1. Presentation with nasal signs and symptoms occurs when nasopharyngeal and nasal obstruction predominate, and occurs with otologic signs and symptoms when Eustachian tube obstruction coexists. When larger, the lesions may be visible below the soft palate or acting as a ball-valve may obstruct the larynx causing positional cyanosis; indeed, fatal obstruction has been reported. Several theories of embryologic origin exist. Hairy polyps arising from the Eustachian tube may originate in the fourth postconceptual week from entrapped cells between the first pouch endoderm and first cleft ectoderm. Because they resemble the pinna, they have been postulated to be accessory auricles arising “internally” from the first branchial anlarge. Less likely would seem to be persistence of the <b>bucconasal</b> or buccopharyngeal <b>membranes,</b> or uncontrolled development from entrapped pluripotential cells...|$|R
