The group manages {{to contact the}} surface, and open and close doors to various rooms in LeMU to move the water around, allowing them to escape. After having played the game as both Takeshi and the Kid, the player accesses the final route, {{in which it is}} revealed that while the events Takeshi experienced took place in 2017, those the Kid experienced were a recreation, and took place in a rebuilt LeMU in 2034. The You of 2017, whose full first name is Yubiseiharukana, had artificially impregnated herself and given birth to Yubiseiakikana, who took the role of You during the recreation. Pipi had escaped LeMU in 2017, carrying with it the disk with Sora's memories and footage of Coco being trapped in IBF. Sara and the Kid are revealed to be Tsugumi and Takeshi's children, and the Kid's real name turns out to be Hokuto. The Kid of 2017, whose name is Ryogo Kaburaki, played the role of Takeshi during the recreation, having stopped aging due to the Cure virus.|$|E

25|$|Rogers' {{second season}} as Somerset captain, 1951, was more {{difficult}} than the first. The side was dependent for wickets on a trio of spin bowlers, Johnny Lawrence, Ellis Robinson and Horace Hazell, with the last two both past 40. In 1950, runs had come from several team members: in 1951, Maurice Tremlett made more than 2,000 and Harold Gimblett 1,400, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> apart {{from a couple of}} irregular amateurs averaged more than 20. Rogers made only 784 runs in Championship games with a top score of 58, although his season average and total was improved by an unbeaten 107 in 160 minutes against the South African touring team. This was to prove his highest score in first-class cricket. With both batting and bowling inadequacies, Somerset fell back to 14th in the Championship, with only five victories and 15 defeats.|$|E

25|$|In the {{penultimate}} First Class {{match of}} the tour Freddie Brown was still recovering from his car crash during the Fourth Test, and John Warr, Alec Bedser and Doug Wright were given a rest and Denis Compton had only Trevor Bailey (1/74), nursing his freshly healed broken finger, the young Brian Statham (1/47) and the out of form Brian Close (3/103), Eric Hollies (3/107) and Bob Berry (2/92). Lindsay Hassett took full advantage by making 232 after winning the toss – his highest First Class century – <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> did except Doug Ring who made 74 as they added 166 for the seventh wicket. Hassett batted well into the second day finishing his century, which pretty much condemned the match to a draw on such a good wicket. The MCC made 414 thanks to Len Hutton (128) and Bailey (125) as Jack Iverson was recovering from a damaged ankle and the only bowlers of quality were Bill Johnston (2/68), Doug Ring (5/134) and Ian Johnson (1/10), the last bowling the out of form Compton with a full toss for 20. Colin MacDonald (26) and Neil Harvey (56) made an opening stand of 56 as the South Australians batted out the game with an innings of 234, leaving the MCC 15 minutes to make 36/1.|$|E
25|$|A {{major part}} of the MCC tour was to fly the flag, promote cricket {{throughout}} Australia and earn revenue for the English counties. All these were fulfilled by playing upcountry games against local grade cricket teams and as these sides were roughly the equivalent to Lancashire League they provided the tourists with valuable practice before taking on the state sides and Australia. Northam was a small mining town 60 miles inland from Perth, but the mine was played out and the local economy was geared to sheep-raising. After regaining their land legs from their voyage the team travelled up. It had been 10 years since the MCC had toured Australia in 1936-37, the town was decorated as if for a fête and the players were entertained by the locals. The Northam captain won the toss and batted, but his team was soon out as big left-arm fast bowler Bill Voce of Bodyline fame took 3/11 and Peter Smith 5/55 with his leg-spin. The opener Tetlaw top-scored with 34 and added 44 for the fifth wicket with Lawrence (32). Slater made 26 batting at number 7, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> reached double figures and they were out for 123. Len Hutton (51) and Cyril Washbrook (47) added 93 for the first wicket, then Denis Compton hit 84 with 11 fours and Wally Hammond 131 with 19 fours and 4 sixes before he 'retired out' and declared the innings at 409/6 after tea the next day. This proved sufficient to bowl out the Northam team for 71, Tetlaw (29) again top-scored, but Bill Edrich added figures of 6/20 to his three first innings catches and 38 not out. Smith took 4/18 and the MCC won by an innings and 215 runs inside two days.|$|E
500|$|Prior {{to working}} on Star Trek, Gene Roddenberry had been {{developing}} {{a variety of}} television pilots for Screen Gems. One actress he auditioned was Majel Leigh Hudec, later to use the name Majel Barrett. Later when he created the drama series The Lieutenant, he cast her in the episode [...] "In the Highest Tradition". They quickly became friends, and entered into a romantic relationship although Roddenberry was married at the time. During {{the development of the}} first pilot for [...] (""), Roddenberry wrote the part of Number One (the ship’s second in command) specifically for Barrett. There was reluctance from the NBC executives to agree to an actress who was almost unknown. Roddenberry did see other actresses for the part, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> was considered.|$|E

500|$|On January 1, 1923, the Taylors' {{neighbor}} {{reported that}} she heard a scream {{while it was still}} dark, grabbed her revolver and ran next door to find Fannie bruised and beaten, with scuff marks across the white floor. Taylor was screaming that someone needed to get her baby. She said a black man was in her house; he had come through the back door and assaulted her. The neighbor found the baby, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else.</b> Taylor's initial report stated her assailant beat her about the face but did not rape her. Rumors circulated—widely believed by whites in Sumner—that she was both raped and robbed.

500|$|When he {{returned}} from Wake, MacArthur faced the challenge of turning his promises into reality. On 24 October, he ordered his principal subordinates, Lieutenant General Walton Walker, {{the commander of the}} Eighth Army, and Major General Edward Almond of X Corps, to [...] "drive forward with all speed and full utilization of all their force." [...] He also lifted the prohibition on troops other than South Koreans operating along the borders with China and the Soviet Union. Collins considered this a violation of the orders that the Joint Chiefs had issued on 27 September, but MacArthur pointed out that it was only, {{in the words of the}} original directive, [...] "a matter of policy." [...] He added that the matter had been raised at Wake Island, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> recalled this, particularly not Truman, who, unaware of these discussions, told reporters on 26 October that Koreans and not Americans would occupy the border areas.

500|$|However, {{the text}} is ambiguous, making it {{questionable}} that Henry ever matures. As critic Donald Gibson stated in The Red Badge of Courage: Redefining the Hero, [...] "the novel undercuts itself. It {{says there is no}} answer to the questions it raises; yet it says the opposite.... It says that Henry Fleming finally sees things as they are; it says he is a deluded fool. It says that Henry does not see things as they are; <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> does either." [...] Although Crane critic and biographer Stallman wrote of Henry's [...] "spiritual change" [...] {{by the end of the}} story, he also found this theme difficult to champion in light of the novel's enigmatic ending. Although Henry [...] "progresses upwards toward manhood and moral triumph", as he begins to mature by taking leave of his previous [...] "romantic notions," [...] "the education of the hero ends as it began: in self deception." [...] Critic William B. Dillingham also noted the novel's heroism paradox, especially in terms of the introspective Henry's lapse into unreasoning self-abandon in the second half of the book. Dillingham stated that [...] "in order to be courageous, a man in time of physical strife must abandon the highest of his human facilities, reason and imagination, and act instinctively, even animalistically." ...|$|E

5000|$|Underextension, {{which is}} roughly the {{opposite}} of overextension, occurs when a child acquires a word for a particular thing and fails to extend it to other objects in the same category, using the word in a highly restricted and individualistic way. For example, a child may learn the word flower {{in connection with a}} rose but fail to extend its meaning to other types of flowers. [...] Although research more commonly addresses the underextension of nouns, this error can also apply to verbs. For example, a child might underextend the verb sit and only use it with reference to the family dog’s sitting <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else’s.</b>|$|R

500|$|Stage 18 was {{extremely}} important to the race's overall standings. With [...] still {{to go before the}} finish, Andy Schleck attacked out of the group of race favorites, and no one followed him. He made the bridge up to a teammate from the morning escape, who paced him to a maximum four-minute advantage {{at the front of the}} race. From behind, Evans put in an intensive effort from about the [...] to go mark to limit his losses. Schleck easily won the stage, but Evans remained only 57 seconds down, a time gap he could easily make up in the stage 20 individual time trial. Evans had mounted the final chase all on his own, with riders near him such as Voeckler and Ivan Basso contributing no work. Fränk Schleck took a little time out of him in view of the finish line, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> did, as the field finished scattered behind Evans. His long, largely solo chase was characterized as saving his overall chances after Andy Schleck had made his bid for Tour victory beforehand. The status quo largely held the next day on Alpe d'Huez, though Voeckler at last fell from the race lead, putting Andy Schleck in the yellow jersey. Schleck was characterized as missing an important chance to pad his race lead with the time trial, where Evans was recognized as the better of the two, still to race.|$|E
500|$|The critics {{gave the}} work a {{generally}} kinder reception in London, where The Times called Puccini [...] "a master {{in the art}} of poignant expression", and praised the [...] "wonderful skill and sustained power" [...] of the music. In The Musical Times, Puccini's score was admired for its sincerity and [...] "strength of utterance." [...] After the 1903 Paris opening, the composer Paul Dukas thought the work lacked cohesion and style, while Gabriel Fauré was offended by [...] "disconcerting vulgarities". In the 1950s, the young musicologist Joseph Kerman described Tosca as a [...] "shabby little shocker."; in response the conductor Thomas Beecham remarked that anything Kerman says about Puccini [...] "can safely be ignored". Writing half a century after the premiere, the veteran critic Ernest Newman, while acknowledging the [...] "enormously difficult business of boiling [...] play down for operatic purposes", thought that the subtleties of Sardou's original plot are handled [...] "very lamely", so that [...] "much of what happens, and why, is unintelligible to the spectator". Overall, however, Newman delivered a more positive judgement: [...] " [...] operas are to some extent a mere bundle of tricks, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> has performed the same tricks nearly as well". Opera scholar Julian Budden remarks on Puccini's [...] "inept handling of the political element", but still hails the work as [...] "a triumph of pure theatre". Music critic Charles Osborne ascribes Toscas immense popularity with audiences to the taut effectiveness of its melodramatic plot, the opportunities given to its three leading characters to shine vocally and dramatically, and the presence of two great arias in [...] "Vissi d'arte" [...] and [...] "E lucevan le stelle". The work remains popular today: according to Operabase, it ranks as fifth in the world with 540 performances given in the five seasons 2009/10 to 2013/14.|$|E

Ian Johnson opened the bowling with 4/53 and Colin McCool took 6/105 (Hutton, Washbrook, Gibb, Hammond, Yardley and Bedser) and the tourists were out for 310. Queensland batted for a declaration hitting 230/6 in 177 minutes, Ken Mackay sticking in for 33 not out while Len Johnson hit 75 at the other end. Needing 321 to win in 224 minutes the MCC went for a draw. Cyril Washbrook made 124 and helped by Edrich (71) in a stand of 162 for the second wicket this was done with few problems, though McCool (3/73) took three late wickets (Washbrook, Ikin and Compton) to leave them 238/6.|$|E
