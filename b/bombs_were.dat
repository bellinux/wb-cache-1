5|$|Long {{took the}} lead in {{preparing}} the explosives, telling his followers that his experience as a fortuneteller, mystic and natural healer made him an expert. The <b>bombs</b> <b>were</b> made from cannon shot, carbon, sulphur and saltpeter, which were then wrapped together.|$|E
5|$|The march ended early {{after the}} DA {{was confronted by}} ANC {{supporters}} 40 minutes into the march. Stones and petrol <b>bombs</b> <b>were</b> thrown by ANC supporters at police trying to calm the situation.|$|E
5|$|Alsos teams {{rounded up}} German {{scientists}} including Kurt Diebner, Otto Hahn, Walther Gerlach, Werner Heisenberg, and Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, who {{were taken to}} England where they were interned at Farm Hall, a bugged house in Godmanchester. After the <b>bombs</b> <b>were</b> detonated in Japan, the Germans were forced to confront {{the fact that the}} Allies had done what they could not.|$|E
50|$|On 23 August 1973 a <b>bomb</b> <b>was</b> {{found in}} an {{abandoned}} bag in Baker Street station ticket hall. The <b>bomb</b> <b>was</b> defused.A week later another <b>bomb</b> <b>was</b> found {{by a member of}} staff at the same station and was also defused. It was planted by the Provisional IRA.|$|R
50|$|A <b>bomb</b> <b>is</b> {{placed on}} the lower path of a Mach-Zehnder {{interferometer}} with a single-photon light source. If the photon takes the lower path and the <b>bomb</b> <b>is</b> live, then the photon is absorbed and triggers the bomb; otherwise, if the <b>bomb</b> <b>is</b> a dud, the photon will pass through unaffected.|$|R
50|$|The {{effects of}} MK-77 <b>bombs</b> <b>are</b> {{similar to those}} of napalm. The {{official}} designation of Vietnam War-era napalm <b>bombs</b> <b>was</b> the Mark 47.|$|R
5|$|B-29s {{began to}} arrive over Yawata at 00:38 local {{time and the}} attack on the city lasted almost two hours. Only 15 of the American {{aircraft}} were able to aim their bombs visually as the city was blacked out and obscured by smoke or haze; the other 32 bombed by radar. Two further B-29s bombed Laoyao harbor and another five struck targets of opportunity; overall 107 tons of <b>bombs</b> <b>were</b> dropped during the raid. After the first <b>bombs</b> <b>were</b> released regular updates on the operation were transmitted to the Twentieth Air Force's headquarters in Washington, from where they were relayed to Arnold who was in London at the time. The raiders were met with heavy but inaccurate anti-aircraft fire and the searchlights stationed around Yawata were not effective. The 4th Air Regiment achieved the only kill of the night when one of its fighters shot down a B-29. The Regiment's other aircraft struggled to make contact with the bombers and achieved few interceptions.|$|E
5|$|Combat {{missions}} {{were flown}} by the 509th Composite Group on 20, 23, 26 and 29 July and 8 and 14 August 1945, using the bombs against individual targets in Japanese cities. A total of 49 <b>bombs</b> <b>were</b> dropped on 14 targets, one bomb was jettisoned into the ocean, {{and two were}} aboard aircraft that aborted their missions.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{the station}} was subject of a {{terrorist}} attack. A non-Norwegian man had called the Norwegian police 7.49 in the morning, claiming that he had planted a bomb on the station which would detonate 8.00, eleven minutes later. All traffic on the Østfold Line was stopped, and the station investigated, but no <b>bombs</b> <b>were</b> found.|$|E
25|$|In early June 2008 an SC 1000 <b>bomb</b> <b>was</b> dredged {{from the}} River Lea near Three Mills Island in London. The <b>bomb</b> <b>was</b> defused and the {{explosive}} liquefied and pumped out using steam by bomb disposal {{officers from the}} Royal Engineers before the <b>bomb</b> <b>was</b> destroyed in a controlled explosion after five days.|$|R

5|$|Nuclear {{weapons were}} {{developed}} during World War II by the Manhattan Project, which created {{a network of}} production facilities, and the weapons research and design laboratory at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Two types of <b>bombs</b> <b>were</b> developed: the Mark 1 Little Boy, a gun-type fission weapon using uranium-235, and the Mark 3 Fat Man, an implosion-type nuclear weapon using plutonium.|$|E
5|$|On 4 April 1945, 24 B-17s {{attacked}} fortified {{targets in}} Hamburg. The target was obscured by cloud so radar guidance {{was used to}} launch the bombs. A further mission in May 1945 was cancelled. A total of 158 <b>bombs</b> <b>were</b> dropped {{before the end of}} the war. No aircraft or aircrew were lost during the four Disney combat missions.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, anecdotal sources {{attribute}} {{the naming of}} the bombs to a pumpkin color: While the <b>bombs</b> <b>were</b> painted olive drab or khaki in the field, photographs show that at least the units delivered to Tinian were shipped in the same yellow zinc chromate primer color worn by Fat Man.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bombing</b> <b>is</b> {{a central}} plot feature of Hari Kunzru's 2007 novel My Revolutions, {{in which the}} <b>bomb</b> <b>is</b> the work of {{political}} radicals who are never caught.|$|R
5000|$|... 21 December 1974: A <b>bomb</b> <b>was</b> defused in Harrods {{department}} store in Knightsbridge, London. A second <b>bomb</b> <b>was</b> defused in the King's Arms public house in Warminster, Wiltshire.|$|R
50|$|The <b>bomb</b> <b>is</b> then {{loaded on}} a strike aircraft. In the pylon {{to which the}} <b>bomb</b> <b>is</b> {{attached}} there is a datalink between the aircraft's cockpit and the bomb.|$|R
5|$|Some {{passengers}} and crew members who called from the aircraft using the cabin airphone service and mobile phones provided details: several hijackers were aboard each plane; they used mace, tear gas, or pepper spray to overcome attendants; and some people aboard had been stabbed. Reports indicated hijackers stabbed and killed pilots, flight attendants, and one or more passengers. According to the 9/11 Commission's final report, the hijackers had recently purchased multi-function hand tools and assorted Leatherman-type utility knives with locking blades, which were not forbidden to passengers at the time, but were not found among the possessions {{left behind by the}} hijackers. A flight attendant on Flight 11, a passenger on Flight 175, and passengers on Flight 93 said the hijackers had bombs, but one of the passengers said he thought the <b>bombs</b> <b>were</b> fake. The FBI found no traces of explosives at the crash sites, and the 9/11 Commission concluded that the <b>bombs</b> <b>were</b> probably fake.|$|E
5|$|Two more Fat Man <b>bombs</b> <b>were</b> detonated {{during the}} Operation Crossroads nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll in 1946. Some 120 Fat Man units were {{produced}} between 1947 and 1949, {{when it was}} superseded by the Mark 4 nuclear bomb. The Fat Man was retired in 1950.|$|E
5|$|After the {{initiation}} of the strategic aerial bombardment of North Vietnam (Operation Rolling Thunder) in March 1965, Washington saw that program as its chief method of relaying signals to Hanoi to cease its support of the southern insurgency. When that failed as a strategy, the aerial effort was redirected {{to serve as an}} anti-infiltration campaign. After a million sorties were flown and more than three-quarters of a million tons of <b>bombs</b> <b>were</b> dropped, Rolling Thunder came to an end at the direction of President Lyndon B. Johnson on 11 November 1968.|$|E
50|$|The Little Boy atomic <b>bomb</b> <b>was</b> dropped over Hiroshima at 08:15 local time. Tibbets {{recalled}} {{that the city}} was covered with a tall mushroom cloud after the <b>bomb</b> <b>was</b> dropped.|$|R
50|$|A smoke <b>bomb</b> <b>is</b> a {{firework}} {{designed to}} produce smoke upon ignition. Smoke <b>bombs</b> <b>are</b> useful to airsoft games, paintball games, self-defense and pranks. They {{are also used}} in smoke tests.|$|R

5|$|At 18:18 night {{began to}} fall. The Luftwaffe sent bombers from KG 1, 2, 3, 27 and 53 to bomb targets at Sheffield, Leeds, Hull, Colchester, Canvey Island, Manningtree and Sealand. British records {{mentioned}} damage only at Sealand. Most <b>bombs</b> <b>were</b> scattered over rural districts. In one incident, a KG 27 He 111, shortly before midnight, attacked the flying and training school at Windrush, in Gloucestershire, where night flying was in progress. The bomber, piloted by Alfred Dreher, crashed into an Avro Anson piloted by Sergeant Bruce Hancock. Both aircraft crashed, killing all five men involved.|$|E
5|$|Lithium deuteride was {{the fusion}} fuel {{of choice in}} early {{versions}} of the hydrogen bomb. When bombarded by neutrons, both 6Li and 7Li produce tritium — this reaction, which was not fully understood when hydrogen <b>bombs</b> <b>were</b> first tested, {{was responsible for the}} runaway yield of the Castle Bravo nuclear test. Tritium fuses with deuterium in a fusion reaction that is relatively easy to achieve. Although details remain secret, lithium-6 deuteride apparently still plays a role in modern nuclear weapons as a fusion material.|$|E
5|$|On 28 March 1939, {{the head}} of RAF Bomber Command Air Chief Marshal Sir Edgar Ludlow-Hewitt hosted a conference {{on the state of}} Bomber Command. Among the many {{problems}} with operational readiness, he noted that that RAF <b>bombs</b> <b>were</b> much too small and that bombsight technology was obsolete. Given the problems of obtaining a modern bombsight, he pressed {{for the creation of a}} high-speed bomber design that could safely attack at low levels.|$|E
50|$|On 26 June 2013, a bomb {{exploded}} killing nine people and injuring fifteen in Karachi. The <b>bomb</b> <b>was</b> intended {{to blow up}} Sindh High Court justice Baqar Maqbool's convoy. The <b>bomb</b> <b>was</b> located on a motorbike near a mosque. Five of the people killed in the <b>bomb</b> explosion <b>were</b> police officers.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>bomb</b> <b>was</b> of home-making manufacture. The {{attorney}} {{pointed out}} that his workmanship is [...] "rustic", but said that the <b>bomb</b> <b>was</b> a galvanized pipe of 30 centimeters and a battery of 9 volts.|$|R
50|$|Food Not <b>Bombs</b> <b>is</b> often {{described}} as direct action because individuals involved directly act to solve a social problem; people are hungry {{and yet there is}} food available. Food Not <b>Bombs</b> <b>is</b> inherently dedicated to non-violence.|$|R
5|$|Pumpkin <b>bombs</b> <b>were</b> a {{means of}} {{providing}} realistic training with non-nuclear bombs for the 509th Composite Group's Boeing B-29 Superfortress crews assigned to drop the atomic bomb. The pumpkin bomb had the same weight, size, and weight distribution as the Fat Man plutonium bomb, giving it the same ballistic and handling characteristics. Specifications for the bomb required that it be carried in the forward bomb bay of a Silverplate B-29 bomber and be fuzed to be effective against actual targets.|$|E
5|$|Somerton {{was hit by}} four Luftwaffe {{bombs on}} the morning of 29 September 1942 during the Second World War. The <b>bombs</b> <b>were</b> aimed at the Cow and Gate milk factory and it was largely destroyed. Ten nearby houses were badly damaged. Nine people were killed and thirty seven injured. A {{memorial}} at the dairy site commemorates those killed. The factory later became a district council depot, and was recently bought by the town council for possible use as the site of a new town hall.|$|E
5|$|Swiss Hunters were {{operated}} as interceptors, with {{a secondary}} ground-attack role; from 1963 onwards, the outboard wing pylons were modified to carry two AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. In the ground-attack role, the Swiss Air Force maintained {{an arsenal of}} conventional iron bombs, a number of compatible napalm <b>bombs</b> <b>were</b> also maintained for intended use by the Hunters. In the interceptor role, the Hunters were supplemented by a surface-to-air missile (SAM) defence system also procured from the United Kingdom, based on the Bristol Bloodhound. In case of unservicable airstrips, Swiss Air Force Jets would take off from adjacent highways, using them as improvised runways.|$|E
500|$|The {{plutonium}} hemispheres for {{the pit of}} the Trinity {{nuclear test}} [...] "gadget" [...] (<b>bomb)</b> <b>were</b> delivered to the McDonald Ranch House on July 11, 1945. Brigadier General Thomas F. Farrell, the Deputy Director of the Manhattan Project, signed for them, and handed them over to Louis Slotin, {{the head of the}} Pit Assembly Team. The active components of the <b>bomb</b> <b>were</b> assembled in the assembly room on July 13, 1945, The <b>bomb</b> <b>was</b> winched up the test tower the following day. The Trinity test occurred on July 16, 1945. A plutonium Fat Man-type <b>bomb</b> <b>was</b> detonated, similar to the bomb later dropped on Nagasaki.|$|R
50|$|When the <b>bomb</b> <b>was</b> {{delivered}} by low-level toss <b>bombing,</b> the aircraft <b>was</b> almost always {{at a lower}} altitude than the burst height; so in effect, the <b>bomb</b> <b>was</b> not really 'dropped', but was released and 'flew' upwards in a ballistic trajectory, to detonate when it reached the required altitude.|$|R
50|$|The <b>bombing</b> <b>was</b> {{most likely}} a {{symbolic}} target, striking at what the IRA saw as British power. The <b>bomb</b> <b>was</b> purposely placed as to avoid any casualties. It was estimated to have contained 5 lbs of explosives.|$|R
