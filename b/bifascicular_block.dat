5000|$|Disorders {{affecting}} the cardiomyocytes {{that make up}} the electrical conduction system of the heart are called heart blocks. Heart blocks are separated into different categories based on the location of the cellular damage. Damage to any of the conducting cells in or below the bundle of His are collectively referred to as [...] "infra-Hisian blocks". To be specific, blocks that occur in the right or left bundle branches are called [...] "bundle branch blocks", and those that occur in either the left anterior or the left posterior fascicles are called [...] "fascicular blocks", or [...] "hemiblocks". The conditions in which both the right bundle branch and either the left anterior fascicle or the left posterior fascicle are blocked are collectively referred to as <b>bifascicular</b> <b>blocks,</b> and the condition in which the right bundle branch, the left anterior fascicle, and the left posterior fascicle are blocked is called trifascicular block. Infra-hisian blocks limit the heart's ability to coordinate the activities of the atria and ventricles, which usually results in a decrease in its efficiency in pumping blood.|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundFew {{studies have}} {{compared}} conventional testing with prolonged monitoring using an implantable loop recorder (ILR) following the first syncope episode {{in patients with}} bundle branch block (BBB) and negative workup. ObjectivesTo compare two syncope evaluation strategies–primary use of an ILR (Group 1) versus conventional testing (Group 2) –and to estimate the prevalence of significant arrhythmias in the ILR patient subset. MethodsFrom January 2005 to December 2010, 78 patients admitted after one syncope episode were randomized to ILR (n= 41) or conventional follow-up (n= 37). Mean follow-up was 27 ± 12 months. ResultsMean age was 76 ± 8 years and 30 patients were women (38. 5 %); 18 presented cardiomyopathy (23 %) and 12 {{had a history of}} atrial fibrillation (15. 4 %). Mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 56. 5 ± 11 % and mean His-to-ventricle interval was 55 ± 6 ms based on negative electrophysiological study (EPS). Electrocardiogram abnormalities involved: 34 left bundle branch blocks (BBBs); 11 right BBBs; and 33 <b>bifascicular</b> <b>blocks.</b> Overall, 21 patients (27 %) developed significant arrhythmic events: ventricular tachycardia (n= 1; 1. 3 %); sudden death (n= 2; 2. 6 %); third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block (n= 14; 18 %); sick sinus syndrome (n= 4; 5. 1 %). In 19 (24. 4 %) patients, relevant arrhythmias were detected, with {{a significant difference between the}} ILR group (n= 15 / 41; 36. 6 %) and the conventional follow-up group (n= 4 / 37; 10. 8 %) (P= 0. 02). Eighteen patients were implanted with pacemakers; one received an implantable defibrillator. No predictors of AV block were identified in the ILR group. ConclusionsIn this randomized prospective study, the ILR strategy proved largely superior to conventional follow-up in detecting recurrent events, with a potential impact on therapeutic management. This observation highlights the usefulness of early monitoring in patients with BBB and negative EPS even after the first syncope episode but an empiric pacemaker strategy remains to be validated in this selected population...|$|R
5000|$|Some authors {{consider}} left bundle branch block (LBBB) to be {{a technical}} <b>bifascicular</b> <b>block,</b> since the block occurs above the [...] {{of the left}} anterior and left posterior fascicles of the left bundle branch.|$|E

40|$|Objectives. The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{inducibility}} of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with <b>bifascicular</b> <b>block</b> both with and without a history of syncope and to relate the findings to clinical events during follow-up. Background. Patients with <b>bifascicular</b> <b>block</b> have an increased risk of sudden death that is not reduced by pacemaker treatment. This risk could be related to a high incidence of ventricular arrhythmias. Method. Programmed ventricular stimulation was performed in 101 patients with bifascicular block; 41 had a history of unexplained syncope, and 60 were asymptomatic. Results. Programmed ventricular stimulation resulted in a sustained ventricular arrhythmia in 18 patients (18 %), 8 in the syncope group and 10 in the nonsyncope group (p = NS). Three patients in each group had an inducible sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. During a mean follow-up of 21 months, 10 patients experienced a clinical event defined as sudden death (n = 4), syncope (n = 5) or appropriate discharges from an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (n = 1). Only one of these patients had an inducible ventricular arrhythmia at baseline. Conclusions. The inducibility of ventricular arrhythmias is high in patients with <b>bifascicular</b> <b>block</b> and of the same magnitude in patients with and without a history of syncope. Clinical events during follow-up were not predicted by programmed ventricular stimulation in either of the two groups. The finding of inducible ventricular arrhythmia in patients with <b>bifascicular</b> <b>block</b> should therefore be interpreted with caution...|$|E
40|$|The {{primary concern}} in {{patients}} with <b>bifascicular</b> <b>block</b> is the increased risk of progression to complete heart block. Further, an additional first-degree A-V block {{in patients with}} <b>bifascicular</b> <b>block</b> or LBBB might {{increase the risk of}} block progression. Anesthesia, monitoring and surgical techniques can induce conduction defects and bradyarrhythmias in patients with pre-existing bundle branch block. In the setting of an acute MI, several different types of conduction disturbance may become manifest and complete heart block occurs usually in patients with acute myocardial infarction more commonly if there is pre-existing or new bundle branch block. The question that arises is whether it is necessary to insert a temporary pacing catheter in patients with <b>bifascicular</b> <b>block</b> undergoing anesthesia. It is important that an anesthesiologist {{should be aware of the}} indications for temporary cardiac pacing as well as the current recommendations for permanent pacing in patients with chronic bifascicular and trifascicular block.

The progression to high degree atrioventricular block was assessed by bradycardia-detecting pacemakers or repeated 12 -lead electrocardiogram recordings, or both. PATIENTS [...] 73 patients with <b>bifascicular</b> <b>block</b> were included, of whom 25 had a history of unexplained syncope.

40|$|The {{post-operative}} {{review of}} 81 patients operated {{for a large}} interventricular communication {{before the age of}} two years reveals excellent results: the mean age at operation was 7 months, extracorporeal circulation was performed in 25 patients for a mean duration of 77 minutes and profound hypothermia to 18 degrees C was induced in 56 patients. The atrial approach was used in 30 % of cases. The mean follow-up period is 26 months. There was one case of complete bundle branch block, which was subsequently fitted with a pacemaker, 7 cases of <b>bifascicular</b> branch <b>block</b> and a right bundle branch block in the majority of cases. The pulmonary vascular resistance was virtually normal (a mean of 3. 2 U. m- 2 prior to the operation and a mean of 1. 9 U. m- 2 after the operation). The left ventricular volume, which was markedly increased in all patients preoperatively, returned to normal with maintenance of a normal ejection fraction. The neuro-psychomotor behaviour was abnormal in 13 of the 63 patients tested. These abnormalities are not related to the correction procedure, but to pre-existing pathology (small birth weight). 52 patients from a series of 63 cases operated for tetralogy of Fallot before the age of 2 years (median age 12 months) were also reviewed.

40|$|Syncopal {{attacks in}} {{patients}} with <b>bifascicular</b> <b>block</b> {{may be due to}} both ventricular tachyarrhythmias and intermittent atrioventricular block in addition to non-cardiac causes and lead to antiarrhythmic treatment with drugs or pacemaker or both. The acute electrophysiological effect of intravenous disopyramide 2 mg/kg body weight given over five minutes on the His-Purkinje system was assessed in 27 patients with chronic <b>bifascicular</b> <b>block</b> undergoing evaluation for permanent pacemaker treatment. The predictive value of this pharmacological stress test as regards the development of atrioventricular block during follow up was analysed. The HV interval increased (mean 43 %) and the QRS duration was prolonged (mean 24 %). Intrahisian or infrahisian second or third degree atrioventricular block occurred in 14 patients after disopyramide administration, requiring temporary pacing in four of them. Before the electrophysiological study 15 of the 27 patients had had at least two syncopal attacks of suspected cardiac origin but no evidence of second or third degree atrioventricular block. Second or third degree atrioventricular block was subsequently recorded in five of these 15 patients during a mean of two years follow up. The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of second or third degree atrioventricular block produced by disopyramide administration including subsequent atrial pacing [...] a positive disopyramide test [...] as regards later development of atrioventricular block were 80 %, 90 %, and 80 % respectively.

Furthermore, a positive disopyramide test seems to have a significant value in predicting the later development of atrioventricular block...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Septal {{necrosis}} + peripheral left blocks. Because of {{an extensive}} septal necrosis, {{the manifestation of}} the initial ventricular activation forces decreases in the precordial leads. With left <b>bifascicular</b> <b>block</b> (LASB + LPSB), the first ventricular activation forces become more evident and the electrical signs of septal necrosis can be concealed. In {{the presence of a}} trifascicular block, manifestation of the first ventricular electromotive forces diminishes again and the electrical signs of septal necrosis become evident once more. Small Q waves are present in leads V 1 to V 4. Extensive anterior necrosis + peripheral blocks. This necrosis is manifested by QS complexes from V 2 to V 6. An associated left <b>bifascicular</b> <b>block</b> reduces the electrical manifestation of dead tissue: QS complexes persist only in V 3 and V 4. In turn, a coexisting trifascicular block causes the presence of QS complexes from V 2 to V 5. Posteroinferior necrosis + peripheral blocks. Electromotive forces of the ventricular activation shift upward, due to a posteroinferior necrosis and QS or QR complexes are recorded in leads aVF, II and III. An associated left <b>bifascicular</b> <b>block</b> displaces the main electromotive forces downward, posteriorly and to the left, due to a delay of the posteroinferior activation fronts. The ventricular complexes become positive and wider in all leads, reflecting the potential variations of the inferior portions of the left ventricle: aVF, II, III, sometimes V 5 and V 6. Consequently, the electrical signs of necrosis are reduced or abolished. Due to a trifascicular block, wide and slurred QS complexes are recorded in aVF, II, III and sometimes in V 5 and V 6.

40|$|Because {{there is}} a paucity of {{information}} on the perioperative risk of developing complete heart block among patients with <b>bifascicular</b> <b>block</b> (either right bundle branch block and left anterior hemiblock or left bundle branch block) and a long PR interval on the surface electrocardiogram, we undertook an analysis of 76 such patients. Twenty-three patients had right bundle branch block and left axis deviation with a long PR interval and 53 had left bundle branch block with along PR interval. Thirty patients had 37 general anaesthetics, 23 had 32 spinal anaesthetics, and 50 had 64 local anaesthetics or endoscopic procedures. No patient developed complete heart block. Four patients developed sinus bradycardia during general anaesthetics, responsive to atropine or isoproterenol. Similarly, none of the 23 such patients in the literature reviewed had developed complete heart block. Because placement to temporary pacemakers is not without risk, we conclude that prophylactic pacing is not necessary in asymptomatic patients with <b>bifascicular</b> <b>block</b> even {{in the presence of a}} long PR interval.

40|$|Ninety-eight {{patients}} with ECG evidence of <b>bifascicular</b> <b>block</b> {{who had undergone}} general anesthesia and surgery have been followed up. His bundle electrogram was recorded in all patients prior to the surgery. On the basis of electrophysiologic studies, patients were classified in two groups: normal H-V group (47 patients) and prolonged H-V group (51 patients). The prolonged H-V group presented a significantly greater incidence of organic heart disease and cardiac symptoms. Correspondingly, there was a significantly higher incidence of cardiac intra- and postoperative complications in {{patients with}} prolonged H-V interval, {{but none of the}} patients developed complete heart block. Venfricular fibrillation and not the occurrence of complete heart block, was the cause of sudden cardiac death in three patients who had a prolonged H-V interval and severe organic heart disease. Patients with <b>bifascicular</b> <b>block,</b> undergoing anesthesia and surgery, even in the presence of presumable risk factors, do not require prophylactic pacing.

Thirteen of 16 patients with prolonged H-V intervals died compared to nine of 19 with normal H-V intervals (P < 0. 05). In patients with <b>bifascicular</b> <b>block,</b> 11 of 15 with prolonged H-V intervals developed complete A-V block compared to one of ten with normal H-V intervals (P < 0. 005). Twenty-five of 33 patients with normal P-R intervals died compared to eight of 12 with first degree A-V block. Seven of 15 patients with prolonged H-V intervals had normal P-R intervals and four of these seven developed complete A-V block.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. This {{study was}} {{designed}} to analyze the incidence and determinants of complications and long-term survival in sinus node disease treated with atrial pacing. Background. Knowledge of the natural history of sinus node disease treated with different pacing modes is imperfect, and controversy exists regarding the optimal pacemaker therapy. Methods. A consecutive series of 213 patients with sinus node disease initially treated with atrial pacing was studied for a median follow-up period of 60 months. The end points studied were permanent atrial fibrillation, high grade atrioventricular (AV) block, P wave undersensing, pacing mode change, reoperation and death. Several prognostic factors were evaluated statistically and the survival rate was compared with that of a matched general population. Results. The incidence rate of permanent atrial fibrillation during follow-up was 7 % (1. 4 %/year). The risk of this arrhythmia increased substantially with age ≥ 70 years at pacemaker implantation. Only 2 of the 15 patients who developed permanent atrial fibrillation required ventricular pacing. High grade AV block occurred in 8. 5 % (1. 8 %/year) and its incidence was much greater in patients with complete bundle branch block or <b>bifascicular</b> <b>block</b> (35 %) than in patients without such conduction disturbances (6 %). A change to ventricular or dual-chamber stimulation was necessary in 14 % of all patients, primarily because of early lead dislodgment or high grade AV block. Surgical intervention with maintenance of atrial pacing was required in 7 % of patients. The survival rates of 97 % at 1 year, 89 % at 5 years and 72 % at 10 years did not differ significantly from those of a matched general population. Conclusions. In sinus node disease, atrial pacing can be successfully applied during long-term follow-up. Patients with complete bundle branch or <b>bifascicular</b> <b>block</b> in addition to sinus node disease should initially receive a dual-chamber pacemaker, but routine application of dual-chamber stimulation {{does not appear to be}} warranted...|$|E

40|$|A 29 -year-old man was {{referred}} to the emergency department with a complaint of abdominal pain and dizziness. He had experienced two previous syncopal episodes. His family history revealed that {{his mother and his}} two uncles had received permanent pacemaker implantation. His initial heart rate was 49 beats per minute. The electrocardiography (ECG) showed atrial flutter and right bundle branch block (RBBB) with left anterior fascicular block (LAFB). On admission, 24 -hour Holter showed ventricular pause up to 16 seconds during syncope. Radio frequency catheter ablation (RFCA) of atrial flutter was performed. The ECG revealed <b>bifascicular</b> <b>block</b> (RBBB and LAFB) and first-degree atrioventricular block. He received a permanent pacemaker implantation. His brother’s and his sister’s ECGs also showed trifascicular block and the pedigree showed autosomal dominant inheritance. This patient was diagnosed with a progressive familial heart block (PFHB) type I. This would be the first report of a PFHB type I case documented in Korea.

40|$|Between January 1973 and July 1981, 128 {{patients}} {{less than}} 1 year of age with failure to thrive, {{congestive heart failure}} or pulmonary artery hypertension underwent primary repair of a ventricular septal defect. The hospital mortality rate was 7. 8 % (10 of 128), and the late mortality rate was 2. 3 % (3 of 128). Mortality was highest among younger infants with preexisting respiratory problems or a hemodynamically significant residual lesion postoperatively. Complications included a large residual shunt in eight (6. 2 %), transient neurologic problems in five (3. 9 %) and persistent complete heart block in three (2. 3 %). Lung biopsy specimens obtained from 49 patients showed pulmonary vascular abnormalities in all. Complete right bundle branch block developed in 74 (64 %) and <b>bifascicular</b> <b>block</b> appeared in 11 (9 %). Recatheterization in 70 patients (55 %) showed normal pulmonary artery pressures in all but 2 patients with a large residual shunt. Complete closure of the defect had been achieved in 49 (70 %), and a hemodynamically insignificant shunt remained in 19 (27 %). Patients without significant hemodynamic residua were asymptomatic and tended to accelerate in growth after surgery...|$|E
40|$|A 46 {{years old}} male patient {{presenting}} us with left sided inguinal hernia. On examination he looked ill but lying supine comfortably in bed. On auscultation {{first and second}} sounds were audible with no murmur. Blood biochemical analysis showed normal figures. Chest –X-ray showed cardiomegally with pulmonary hypertension. ECG showed <b>bifascicular</b> <b>block</b> with sinus tachycardia. Echocardiography showed global hypokinesias with moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVEF- 30 %), moderate TR with mild pulmonary hypertension, mild pericardial effusion and diastolic dysfunction(G- 1). Due to his cardiac compromised condition the plan was epidural anesthesia instead of subarachnoid block (SAB). Premedication was given at previous night of oral anxiolytic lexotanil (2. 5 mg). After proper counseling {{about the risk of}} anesthesia and surgery an informed consent was taken from the party. Upon arrival of the patient to operation theatre routine monitoring were established. The measured blood pressure was 110 / 70 mm of Hg and heart rate 100 beat/min with oxygen saturation on room air was 98 %. Then a 16 G i. v cannulation was established in left hand.

40|$|Mitochondrial {{disorders}} (MIDs) require biochemical or genetic investigations {{for being}} diagnosed. In some cases, however, the diagnosis can be suspected upon the syndromic phenotype or upon clinical presentation and family history, {{as in the}} following case. The patient was a 74 -year-old male admitted for worsening of pre-existing left-sided ptosis and ophthalmoparesis after a birthday party. The history was positive for arterial hypertension, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with systolic dysfunction, diabetes-type 2, mild renal insufficiency, thyroiditis, and polyneuropathy. Instrumental investigations additionally revealed hepatopathy, hyperlipidemia, hyperuricemia, <b>bifascicular</b> <b>block,</b> white matter lesions, and subacute stroke. Systolic dysfunction resolved upon adequate cardiac treatment. On hospital day 11 the patient suddenly developed asystole. He was successfully resuscitated but died {{a few hours later}} from acute myocardial infarction. Surprisingly, a more extensive family history was positive for myopathy (patient, brother, daughter), neuropathy (patient), hypoacusis (patient), Parkinson syndrome (mother), spasticity (son), diabetes (patient, son), renal failure (patient), and generalized atherosclerosis (patient). The individual and family history was strongly suggestive of an MID. In conclusion, individual and family history may strongly suggest MID. Phenotypic variability may be high between family members affected by an MID. MID may be associated with an increasing atherosclerotic risk lastly resulting in coronary heart disease and death. </div...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Left {{anterior}} hemiblock (LAHB) is {{the most}} frequent conduction abnormality, but {{its impact on the}} diagnostic accuracy of the exercise ECG has not been studied. The aim of our {{study was to determine the}} diagnostic accuracy of ST depression for predicting ischaemia in the presence of LAHB. PATIENTS: Consecutive patients with known or suspected coronary heart disease undergoing exercise ECG and 99 mTc-sestamibi single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) were included in the analysis. Patients with left bundle branch block, with changes in QRS morphology related to myocardial infarction, and patients who had undergone pharmacological stress testing were excluded. RESULTS: Of 1532 patients assessed, 567 patients qualified for the analysis. In 69 patients with LAHB, ECG stress testing had lower sensitivity (38 % vs 86 %) and lower negative predictive value (82 % vs 92 %) than in patients with normal baseline ECG. The reduction of sensitivity appeared to be similar in patients with isolated LAHB (n= 43), in patients with right bundle branch block (n= 39), and with <b>bifascicular</b> <b>block</b> (n= 26). In contrast, the positive predictive value of the test was excellent. CONCLUSION: The diagnostic accuracy of the exercise ECG for prediction of ischaemia is reduced in patients with LAHB...|$|E
40|$|Four of 220 {{patients}} without <b>bifascicular</b> <b>block</b> (complete right bundle branch {{block and}} left anterior hemiblock) or transient complete heart block immediately after surgery had an unexpected cardiac arrest one to 15 years after satisfactory surgical repair of tetralogy of Fallot. The postoperative electrocardiograms (ECG) revealed complete right bundle branch block in two patients and no intraventricular conduction ab-normality in two patients. Each {{of the four}} patients had premature ventricular contractions on previous postoperative ECG. The cardiac arrest occurred during normal activity in three patients and mild exercise in one. Following the cardiac arrest, three patients died and one patient survived. Eighteen months before the cardiac arrest, the survivor had a stress test which revealed multifocal premature ventricular contractions with short bursts of ventricular tachycardia after exercise. This ventricular arrhythmia was suppressed with quinidine therapy. Although complete heart block cannot be excluded in these four patients, we reasoned that the cardiac arrests were probably preceded by ventricular tachyarrhythmia. Because of this experience, we believe that any patient who has had intraventricular surgery should be evaluated for ventricular arrhythmia. If frequent premature ventricular contractions or serious ventricular arrhythmias are documented, we seriously consider antiarrhythmic therapy {{in an attempt to}} prevent ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden death...|$|E
