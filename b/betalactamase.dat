Methods: Fifty-two K. pneumoniae isolates were obtained and analyzed for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and for OmpK 35 and OmpK 36. Results: Twenty-two (42. 3 %) isolates of K. pneumoniae were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers. The OmpK 35 profile in K. pneumoniae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase showed the presence of porin protein in ceftazidime-sensitive K. pneumoniae (six isolates), and the OmpK 36 profile in K. pneumoniae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase revealed isolates sensitive to cefotaxime (n = 8) and ceftriaxone (n = 6).

Findings AP-HP MDR programme consisted in successive waves of actions: bundle measures to survey and control cross transmission of MRSA and extended-spectrum <b>betalactamase</b> producing enterobacteria (ESBL) in 1993, large campaign to promote the use of alcohol-based hand rub solution (ABHRS) in 2001, specific strategy to quickly control the spread of emerging MDR (vancomycin resistant Enterococcus, VRE; carbapenemase producing enterobacteria, CPE) in 2006, large campaign to decrease antibiotics consumption in 2006. Following this programme, the ABHRS consumption dramatically increased, the antibiotic consumption decreased by 10 %, the incidence of MRSA, including MRSA bacteraemia, decreased by 2 / 3, all VRE and CPE events were rapidly controlled. However, the incidence of ESBL, mainly Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli, that remained low and stable until 2003 increased markedly afterwards, justifying adapting our programme in the future.

40|$|K. pneumoniae is {{recognized}} as a common opportunistic pathogen. Numerous reports have been published worldwide on outbreaks in different healthcare settings. K. pneumoniae is inherently resistant to penicillins, including semisynthetic broad-spectrum penicillins. The drug of choice for empirical treatment is often a cephalosporin. However, the use of cephalosporins is known to select for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) -producing strains. The focus of this thesis is the beta-lactamase gene in K. pneumoniae, {{and its relationship to}} beta-lactamase genes present in plasmids in gram-negative bacteria. In Paper I, the intension was to identify presumed beta-lactamase SHV- 1 -encoding plasmids in fecal Klebsiella isolates from neonates in Swedish special care units. No such plasmids were detected, however. Instead, a chromosomal beta-lactamase gene was identified in all K. pneumoniae, but in none of the Klebsiella oxytoca isolates. This species-specific gene was seen in 10 allelic variants; some closely related to the prototypic plasmid-borne SHV- 1 gene, indicating that an allelic variant of the K. pneumoniae chromosomal <b>betalactamase</b> gene is the ancestor of the plasmid-borne SHV-encoding genes. In Paper II, the observed diversity of the chromosomal K. pneumoniae <b>betalactamase</b> gene was further investigated in order to study its evolution in relation to the three phylogenetic groups of K. pneumoniae. Three sequence groups, corresponding to the phylogenetic groups, were identified, blaSHV, blaLEN, and blaOKP. In Paper III, the genetic context of blaSHV in K. pneumoniae chromosomes and plasmids from various gram-negative bacteria was analyzed. Plasmid-borne blaSHV genes were found to be surrounded by DNA highly similar to the K. pneumoniae chromosome. IS 26 elements flanked the blaSHV regions. Nine distinct junctions between IS 26 and K. pneumoniae chromosomal DNA, and seven different region-lengths were identified. In contrast to a high diversity observed among chromosomal sequences, only two groups of plasmid sequences were seen. This thesis has demonstrated that only one of three ancient K. pneumoniae chromosomal beta-lactamase gene families, blaSHV, is found on plasmids. This is possibly the result from a single IS 26 mediated mobilization of blaSHV and surrounding DNA from K. pneumoniae. The two groups of plasmid blaSHV regions seen today could be the result of post-mobilization evolution involving size reductions and nucleotide substitutions. We conclude that mobilization of blaSHV from K. pneumoniae chromosomes is not a driving force in the emergence of resistance in response to beta-lactam therapy. The spread is more likely a consequence of mobilization of IS 26 flanked blaSHV regions between plasmids, and mobilization of plasmids between different bacteria...|$|E

The prevalence of Bacteroides meianinogenicus and B. intermedius (now belonging to the Prevotella group) and B. gingivalis (Porphyromonas group) in healthy and diseased sites in the oral cavity was studied. The P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia and P. gingivalis were all formerly called black pigmented bacteroides (BPB). Out of the biack pigmented bacteroides, P. intermedia and P. melaninogenica were isolated from 20 % and 62 % of fifty healthy oral cavities, respectively. No Porphyromonas gingivalis was isolated in this group of subjects. P. gingivalis (25 %) and P. intermedia (53. 4 %) were positively associated with disease in the oral cavity. Their presence in acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG) was statistically significant. They were also isolated from periodontitis, oral abscesses, infected fractures, infections superimposed on tumors, and suppurating osteomyelitis. There was a non-statistically significant association of these species with periodontitis. It was observed that the older the patient was, the more frequent the isolation rate of P. gingivalis. Some local isolates of P. gingivalis were resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline and cephalothin, produced <b>betalactamase</b> and carried cryptic plasmids whose functions were not clear...|$|E
40|$|Background and Objective: To {{evaluate}} extended spectrum <b>betalactamase</b> (ESBL) positive {{strains of}} Klebsiella pneumonia and Escherichia coli in positive bacterial cultures. Materials and Methods: In this analytical cross-sectional study, between March 2006 and March 2007, 170 bacterial isolates including 133 cases of E. coli and 37 cases of K. pneumonia were examined. All cases underwent double disk diffusion for ESBL. Demographic data were assessed and all data analyzed accordingly. Results: Patients ’ {{mean age was}} 55 ± 26. 63 yr. Ninety six cases (56. 5 %) were female and 74 cases (43. 5 %) were male. Clinical presentation of infection were 118 cases UTI (96. 4 %), 15 cases septicemia (8. 8 %), 16 cases wound infection (9. 4 %), 7 cases pneumonia (4. 1 %), 1 case meningitis (0. 6 %) and 13 cases other presentations (7. 6 %). Frequency of ESBL positive in E. coli isolates was 38 cases (28. 6 %) and in K. pneumonia isolates was 10 cases (27 %). There was no significant correlation between ESBL positivity and age, gender, ward or clinical presentation of infection. Conclusion: Incidence of ESBL positive isolates of E. coli and K. pneumonia was high. These results {{should be considered in}} administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics by clinicians...|$|E
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of ESBL was determined among isolates of Escherichia coli (n = 571) and Klebsiella spp. (n = 196) collected during a 1 -week study period in 8 university and 3 large regional laboratories {{all over the}} Netherlands. 18 isolates were positive {{for at least one}} of the screening tests used, i. e., VITEK-ES BL, E-test ESBL and MIC ratio of ceftazidime/ceftazidime-clavulanic acid, cefotaxime/cefotaxime-clavulanic acid. In 5 of these 18 putative ESBLs no <b>betalactamase</b> production was detectable. A TEM type was found in three E. coli and two Klebsiella spp. An SHV type was present in five Klebsiella spp. In one E. coli and one Klebsiella pneumoniae both enzymes were present. In one Klebsiella oxytoca neither of the two enzymes was present. Using PCR for both ESBL TEM and ESBL SHV, an SHV ESBL was found in one E. coli and four Klebsiella isolates. The mutations at position 238 and 240 were already described. In one E, coli isolate a TEM ESBL was found with three mutations, at position 21, 164 acid 265. These mutations were already described in other ESBLs but not in this combination suggesting a new TEM ESBL. The overall {{prevalence of}} ESBL producing E. coli and Klebsiella spp. was less than 1 % (6 out of 767) ...|$|E
40|$|Etiology and {{antimicrobial}} susceptibility of udder pathogens from {{cases of}} subclinical mastitis in dairy cows in Sweden Ylva Persson 1, 2 * †, Ann-Kristin J Nyman 1 † and Ulrika Grönlund-Andersson 1 † Background: A nationwide survey on the microbial etiology {{of cases of}} subclinical mastitis in dairy cows was carried out on dairy farms in Sweden. The aim {{was to investigate the}} microbial panorama and the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance. Moreover, differences between newly infected cows and chronically infected cows were investigated. Methods: In total, 583 quarter milk samples were collected from 583 dairy cows at 226 dairy farms from February 2008 to February 2009. The quarter milk samples were bacteriological investigated and scored using the California Mastitis Test. Staphylococci were tested for <b>betalactamase</b> production and presence of resistance was evaluated in all specific udder pathogens. Differences between newly infected cows and chronically infected cows were statistically investigated using logistic regression analysis. Results: The most common isolates of 590 bacteriological diagnoses were Staphylococcus (S) aureus (19 %) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS; 16 %) followed by Streptococcus (Str) dysgalactiae (9 %), Str. uberis (8 %), Escherichia (E.) coli (2. 9 %), and Streptococcus spp. (1. 9 %). Samples with no growth or contamination constituted 22 % and 18 % of the diagnoses, respectively. The distribution of the most commonly isolated bacteria considering onl...|$|E
40|$|I {{have two}} {{parallel}} projects for my Ph. D. program, one {{focused on the}} study of bimolecular interactions and the other {{on the study of}} plant metabolism. I describe the two briefly, in the following paragraphs. INTERACTION OF UVI 31 + WITH ANTIBIOTICS: UV irradiation followed by apoptosis has been extensively studied in the lab of Prof BJ Rao. This lab has identified certain candidate molecules that were either UV-regulated or involved in apoptosis. Some of these have been characterized such as apoptosis protease activating factor (APAF), a caspase- 3 like protein, a defender against apoptotic death (dad 1) and a UV inducible protein UVI 31 +. UVI 31 + has been an interesting candidate in the proteins involved in UV repair. It is shown to impart UV resistance and globular morphology to E. coli cells expressing this protein. It is shown to have <b>betalactamase</b> and DNA/RNA endonuclease activity implying its role in abiotic and biotic stress. During the last semester, part of my project dealt with the interaction of UVI 31 + with sulbactam, which has irreversible binding affinity to the protein. NMR data shows chemical shift perturbations in the long loop of 18 amino acid residues of UVI 3 +, following sulbactam binding, signifying the importance of this loop in the active site of UVI 3 +. Further, modeling assiste...|$|E

Abstract: Local {{knowledge}} of antimicrobial susceptibilities of Klebsiella pneumoniae {{is important for}} implementation of effective hospitals anti-infective policies. One hundred isolates of K. pneumoniae collected from 3 different hospitals in Iran during 2004 were screened for their susceptibilities to thirteen different antibiotics using disk diffusion test and macro broth dilution assay. Isolates were then subjected to restriction endonuclease analysis of plasmid DNA. All isolates were susceptible to imipenem. The rates of resistance to other antibiotics were in the following order: amikacin (10 %), piperacillin-tazobactam (% 2), ciprofloxacin (20 %), ceftizoxime (14 %), cefexime (31 %), ceftazidime (28 %), cefotaxime (33 %), nalidixic acid (32 %), cephalexin (32 %), gentamicin (30 %), nitrofurantoin (31 %) and piperacillin (66 %). The production of extended spectrum <b>betalactamase</b> (ESBL) hydrolyzing ceftazidime and cefotaxime was detected in 54 % of isolates. Of 100 isolates tested, 67 harbored plasmids and the remaining lacked any plasmid. Though the prevalence of ESBL phenotype in Iran is higher than western countries, it is close to figures reported from the region. Evidences for outbreaks with certain isolates of K. pneumoniae were found by restriction endonuclease analysis of plasmid DNA. This technique also showed the persistence of infections in the urinary tract of several patients...|$|E
40|$|Twenty {{years of}} {{antimicrobial}} resistance control programme in a regional multi hospital institution, with focus on emerging bacteria (VRE and CPE) Sandra Fournier 1 *, Christian Brun-Buisson 2 and Vincent Jarlier 3 Background: Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (APHP), the largest public {{health care institution}} in France (38 hospitals, 23, 000 beds, serving 11. 6 millions inhabitants) launched in 1993 a long term programme to control and survey multidrug resistant bacteria (MDR). Findings: AP-HP MDR programme consisted in successive waves of actions: bundle measures to survey and control cross transmission of MRSA and extended-spectrum <b>betalactamase</b> producing enterobacteria (ESBL) in 1993, large campaign to promote the use of alcohol-based hand rub solution (ABHRS) in 2001, specific strategy to quickly control the spread of emerging MDR (vancomycin resistant Enterococcus, VRE; carbapenemase producing enterobacteria, CPE) in 2006, large campaign to decrease antibiotics consumption in 2006. Following this programme, the ABHRS consumption dramatically increased, the antibiotic consumption decreased by 10 %, the incidence of MRSA, including MRSA bacteraemia, decreased by 2 / 3, all VRE and CPE events were rapidly controlled. However, the incidence of ESBL, mainly Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli, that remained low and stable until 2003 increased markedly afterwards, justifying adapting our programme in the future. Conclusion: A sustained and coordinated strategy can lead to control multidrug resistant bacteria {{at the level of}} a large multihospital institution...|$|E
40|$|With {{regard to}} {{antibiotic}} resistance studies in various model {{animals in the}} urban environment, the presented study focused on the rook, many behavioural and ecological aspects of which are important from an epidemiological point of view. A total of 130 Escherichia coli strains isolated from rook faeces during a two-year period (2011 – 2012) were investigated for antibiotic resistance and virulence. Resistance to ampicillin (60 %) and streptomycin (40 %) were the most frequent, followed by resistance to fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin- 22 % and enrofloxacin- 24 %), tetracycline (18 %), cotrimoxazol (17 %) and florfenicol (14 %). Ceftiofur resistance occured in 10. 7 % of strains and cefquinom resistance in 1. 5 % of strains. Twenty-five E. coli strains with {{a higher level of}} MICs of cephalosporins (over 2 mg/L of ceftazidime and ceftriaxon) and fluoroquinolones were selected for detection of <b>betalactamase</b> genes (CTX-M, CMY), plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance qnrS, integrase  1, and for APEC (avian pathogenic E. coli) virulence factors (iutA, cvaC, iss, tsh, ibeA, papC, kpsII). Genes of CTX-M 1, CMY- 2, integrase 1, papC, cvaC, iutA were detected in one strain of E. coli, and qnrS, integrase 1, iss, cvaC, tsh were detected in another E. coli. DNA microarray revealed the absence of verotoxin and enterotoxin genes and pathogenicity islands. The results show that rooks can serve as a reservoir of antibiotic-resistant E. coli with avian pathogenic virulence factors for the human population, and potentially transmit such E. coli over long distances...|$|E
