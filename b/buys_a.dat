40|$|AbstractTo better {{understand}} the reasons why households have no intention to <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> car, a sample of 980 respondents, living in Xian, China was asked to specify the reasons why they do not wish <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> car. A probit model was estimated to identify households {{who did not have}} the intention to <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> car, based on their socio-demographic profile and living conditions. Because only these respondents could give the reasons why they do not wish to <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> car, this selection model was linked with a multinomial logit model to estimate the probability that a particular reason for not <b>buying</b> <b>a</b> car mentioned. Results indicate that socio-demographic variables, type and size of the house and non-availability of parking space have significant effects on car purchase decisions. Main reasons for not <b>buying</b> <b>a</b> car are related to costs considerations, parking difficulties and congestion...|$|R

30|$|Interestingly, the {{triangular}} structure is often exploited for rhetorical reasons, {{in particular in}} advertisements. A commercial slogan (popular in the 1980 s) such as “Don’t <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> car, <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> Saab” has a real impact. Here the sentence initially understood as “Don’t <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> car 0 … ” yields a contradiction as a Saab is a car 0. Reinterpreted as “Don’t <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> car 1 …” (in which car 1 is the class of cars that are not Saab), it gets the exclusive interpretation. The cognitive effort is worthwhile in terms of effect as the hearer ends up with “buy a Saab” and “don’t <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> car {{that is not a}} Saab”.|$|R

5|$|In 2017, the European Commission began {{investigating}} Valve {{and five}} other publishers—Bandai Namco Entertainment, Capcom, Focus Home Interactive, Koch Media and ZeniMax Media—for anti-competitive practices, specifically the use of geo-blocking through the Steam storefront and Steam product keys to prevent access to software to citizens of certain countries. Such practices would be against the Digital Single Market initiative set by the European Union. The French gaming trade group, Syndicat National du Jeu Vidéo, noted that geo-blocking was a necessary feature to hinder inappropriate product key reselling, where a group <b>buys</b> <b>a</b> number of keys in regions where the cost is low, and then resells them into regions of much higher value to profit on the difference, outside of European oversight and tax laws.|$|E
