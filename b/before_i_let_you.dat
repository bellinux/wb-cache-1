We all have faults. <b>Before</b> <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> stand on your high horse and point a finger back down at me, I'm {{going to give you a}} big, stiff 'Fuck you.'" [...] On Power 105's The Breakfast Club, T.I. hinted that Trouble Man could be his last album, explaining that he wanted to quit rapping, believing that it is not how it once was: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "And <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> go I'm {{going to}} make you pay up dearly for all that I have suffered. Captain Villaire, have you had them searched?" [...] he asked, turning again to his companion.|$|E
6000|$|... "All right," [...] the mollified usurer had replied. [...] "And I want it on {{a matter}} of {{business}} <b>before</b> <b>I</b> can <b>let</b> <b>you</b> have any more money. You don't think I'm in it for my health?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir!--who was, but is so no longer. You {{will have}} to ask my pardon, at my feet, <b>before</b> <b>I</b> will <b>let</b> <b>you</b> speak to me again as my lover. Go and search. Look for your deed--and then you shall see that I will tear out my own heart rather than submit to the ill-usage of {{distrust}} from one who owes me so much faith as you do." ...|$|R
60|$|Wherefore, {{since it}} hath manifestly {{appeared}} that a religious conscience {{is the only}} true solid foundation upon which virtue can be built, give me leave, <b>before</b> <b>I</b> conclude, to <b>let</b> <b>you</b> see how necessary such a conscience is, to conduct us in every station and condition of our lives.|$|R
6000|$|THE MAN [lowering the stick]. I {{accept your}} apology; but don't do it again. And {{now tell me}} one thing <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> go home to bed. Which would you say this counthry was: hell or purgatory? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Get out wid you! You're no good, {{and never}} will be. An' it wasn't for the young woman upstairs, I'd have the coat off your back, and your face well mauled, <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> out of the shop!" [...] And so ended the interview, in which the anxious brother can hardly {{be said to have}} been triumphant, or successful.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nine, to-morrow morning? Yes, yes--your trap is laid for {{me before}} I {{can get my}} {{passport}} regulated and leave London. It is not earlier, I suppose? We will see about that presently--I can keep you hostage here, and bargain with you to send for your letter <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> go. In the meantime, be so good next as to mention your terms." ...|$|E
60|$|If {{they come}} wholly from the devil, as they seem, because thy {{conscience}} and affections are against them, {{or if they}} come from that body of death that is in thee, and be not thou curious in inquiring from whether of them they come, the safest way is to lay enough at thy own door; nothing of this should hinder thy coming, nor make thee conclude thou comest not aright. 7 And <b>before</b> <b>I</b> leave <b>thee,</b> <b>let</b> me a little query with thee about this matter.|$|R
6000|$|One thing more, <b>before</b> <b>I</b> leave <b>thee,</b> <b>let</b> me warn <b>thee</b> of. Take heed of deferring to {{fear the}} Lord. Some men, when they have had {{conviction}} upon their heart that the fear of God is not in them, have through the overpowering of their corruptions yet deferred and put off the fear of God from them, as it is said of them in Jeremiah: [...] "This people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart; they are revolted and gone. Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear the Lord" [...] (Jer 5:23,24). They saw that the judgments of God attended them {{because they did not}} yet fear God, but that conviction would not prevail with them to say, [...] "Let us now fear the Lord." [...] They were for deferring to fear him still; they were for putting off his fear from them longer. Sinner, hast thou deferred {{to fear the}} Lord? is thy heart still so stubborn as not to say yet, [...] "Let us fear the Lord?" [...] O! the Lord hath taken notice of this thy rebellion, and is preparing some dreadful judgment for thee. [...] "Shall I not visit for these things? saith the Lord; shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?" [...] (v 29). Sinner, why shouldest thou pull vengeance down upon thee? why shouldest thou pull vengeance down from heaven upon thee? Look up, perhaps thou hast already been pulling this great while, to pull it down upon thee. O! pull no longer; why shouldest thou be thine own executioner? Fall down upon thy knees, man, and up with thy heart and thy hands to the God that dwells in the heavens; cry, yea cry aloud, Lord, unite mine heart to fear thy name, and do not harden mine heart from thy fear. Thus holy men have cried before thee, and by crying have prevented judgment.|$|R

6000|$|... 180. Here {{are five}} frames, {{containing}} the best representations I can get for {{you of the}} façade of the cathedral of Orvieto. I must remind you, <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> look at them, {{of the reason why}} that cathedral was built; for I have at last got {{to the end of the}} parenthesis which began in my second lecture, on the occasion of our hearing that John of Pisa was sent for to Perugia, to carve the tomb of Pope Urban IV.; and we must now know who this Pope was.|$|E

I {{sent you}} here myself, {{at my own}} expense, both to test your {{training}} <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> into the regular game {{and for the sake}} of the little Burrows girl, whom I fell in love with when she was so friendless. I believed things would reach a climax in the Hathaway case, in this very spot, but I couldn't foresee that your cleverness would ferret out that letter, which the girl Irene intended to keep silent about, nor did I know that the Chief would send me here in person to supervise Hathaway's capture. Mighty queer things happen in this profession of ours, and circumstances lead the best of us by the nose." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, look here, Mr. Rowan. This letter {{comes from}} your man in Craven Street, as {{of course you}} know very well. You have chosen to put our {{business}} {{in the hands of}} the lawyers, and {{in the hands of the}} lawyers it shall remain. I have been very wrong in attempting to have any dealings with you. I should have known what sort of a man you were <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> put your foot in the concern. But I know enough of you now, and, if you please, you'll keep yourself on the other side of those gates for the future. D'ye hear me? Unless you wish to be turned out by the men, don't you put your feet inside the brewery premises any more." [...] And Tappitt's face as he uttered these words was a face very unpleasant to behold.|$|E

I want out. I want out, man. What the game is going to and what has evolved into from a personality standpoint, it goes against what I represent. What I embody, this game contradicts that. I want out. I'm in it because I love music and I have obligations, contractually.It was at one time, this music was about speaking to the people who felt like you feel. Now, the people I'm speaking to, they don't necessarily feel like how I feel. In my day, if you were rapping about something you weren't really living, that was a strike against you. You were held accountable. Nowadays, nobody even expects you to live up to the things you rap about. That goes against what I represent, what I stand for. So if they outsell me, then that's just all the more better for me to fade to the back and cross my legs on my desk.|$|E
