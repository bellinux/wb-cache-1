5|$|The {{rivalry with}} IFK Malmö is both {{geographical}} and historical. The two clubs {{come from the}} same city and used to play at the same stadium in the early 20thcentury. The supposed actions of board members of IFK Malmö in 1933, revealing Malmö FF's breaches of amateur football rules to the Swedish Football Association, further contribute to the competitive tensions between the two clubs.
