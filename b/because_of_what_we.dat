2500|$|The {{practice}} which monks in {{the tradition}} generally begin with are meditations on what Ajaan Mun called the five “root meditation themes”: the hair of the head, the hair of the body, the nails, the teeth, and the skin. One {{of the purposes of}} meditating on these externally visible aspects of the body is to counter the infatuation with the body, and to develop a sense of dispassion. Of the five, the skin is described as being especially significant. Ajaan Mun writes that “When we get infatuated with the human body, the skin is what we are infatuated with. When we conceive of the body as being beautiful and attractive, and develop love, desire, and longing for it, it's <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> conceive of the skin.” ...|$|E

40|$|Manipulation {{by another}} person often {{undermines}} freedom. To explain this, a distinction is drawn between {{two forms of}} manipulation: indoctrination is defined as causing another person to respond to reasons in a pattern that serves the manipulator’s ends; coercion as supplying another person with reasons that, given the pattern in which he responds to reasons, lead him to act in ways that serve the manipulator’s ends. It is argued that both forms of manipulation undermine freedom because manipulators track the compliance of their victims, while neutral causal mechanisms do not. Manipulators {{see to it that}} their victims comply {{even in the face of}} forces that threaten to derail them from the manipulator’s desired course.

That’s <b>because</b> most <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> “taste ” is actually being sensed by our olfactory system. The word olfaction is actually based on the Latin word olfacere, which means to smell. In contrast to taste, where humans can only perceive fi ve qualities (sour, bitter, sweet, salty, and umami), humans can smell thousands of odorants. Odorants can reach the olfactory epithelium by two routes. The fi rst route, orthonasal olfaction, is the detection of an odor through the nostrils by sniffi ng or inhalation. The second route, retronasal olfaction, is the detection of an odorant when it is released from food in your mouth during chewing, exhalation, or swallowing. During this process, the odorant passes through the posterior nares of the nasopharynx (or the back of the nose; retro-means backward). Once in the olfactory epithelium, odor molecules bind to olfactory receptor...|$|R

I find that, as a rule, when a thing is a wonder to us it is not <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> see in it, but because of what others have seen in it. We get almost all our wonders at second hand. We are eager to see any celebrated thing--and we never fail of our reward; just the deep privilege of gazing upon an object which has stirred the enthusiasm or evoked the reverence or affection or admiration of multitudes of our race is a thing which we value; we are profoundly glad {{that we have seen}} it, we are permanently enriched from having seen it, we would not part with the memory of that experience for a great price. And yet that very spectacle may be the Taj. You cannot keep your enthusiasms down, you cannot keep your emotions within bounds when that soaring bubble of marble breaks upon your view. But these are not your enthusiasms and emotions--they are the accumulated emotions and enthusiasms of a thousand fervid writers, who have been slowly and steadily storing them up in your heart day by day and year by year all your life; and now they burst out in a flood and overwhelm you; and you could not be a whit happier if they were your very own. By and by you sober down, and then you perceive that you have been drunk on the smell of somebody else's cork. For ever and ever the memory of my distant first glimpse of the Taj will compensate me for creeping around the globe to have that great privilege.|$|E

50|$|The very {{simplest}} shelters, tents, {{leave no}} traces. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> this, <b>what</b> little <b>we</b> {{can say about}} very early construction is mostly conjecture and based on <b>what</b> <b>we</b> know about the way nomadic hunter-gatherers and herdsmen in remote areas build shelters today. The absence of metal tools placed limitations on the materials that could be worked, {{but it was still}} possible to build quite elaborate stone structures with ingenuity using dry stone walling techniques such as at Skara Brae in Scotland, Europe's most complete Neolithic village. The first mud bricks, formed with the hands rather than wooden moulds, belong to the late Neolithic period and were found in Jericho. One of the largest structures of this period was the Neolithic long house. In all cases of timber framed and log structures in these very early cultures, only the very lowest parts of the walls and post holes are unearthed in archaeological excavations, making reconstruction of the upper parts of these buildings largely conjectural.|$|R

40|$|What {{could be}} a more fitting {{environment}} for love emblems than the bedroom walls in a Renaissance family castle? A bedroom redecorated {{on the occasion of}} a wedding in the highest circles of French nobility? Where a series of emblems was rearranged {{to tell the story of}} a love, ending in an embrace that even death cannot undo? This seems to be the case in the castle of Coulon, in Graçay (Cher) in central France. The Emblem Project Utrecht was recently contacted by the owner of the castle. On the EPU site she had found in Heinsius’s emblems a possible source for the wall paintings that had been discovered behind the nineteenth-century wallpaper of her castle. The art historians she consulted since the discovery in 1994 had not been able to identify the subjects of the paintings. If we place a short account of these wall paintings in the proceedings of the EPU conference ‘Learned Love’ (November 6 - 7, 2006), it is because it shows not only the wide influence of the Dutch love emblem in its day, but also the effects of emblem digitisation and the internet. The discovery of the wall paintings was a nice present that almost coincided with the completion of the Emblem Project Utrecht’s initial mission, the digitisation of 25 canonical works in the Dutch love emblem tradition. To tell the truth, we do not know for sure whether the room that contains the emblematic wall paintings was a bedroom. We are not sure whether the wall paintings were commissioned <b>because</b> <b>of</b> a wedding. <b>What</b> <b>we</b> do know is this: in the north room on the main floor of the Chateau de Coulon, on the upper part of the walls, someone has painted frescoes that contain the pictures of eight love emblems. The scenes are apparently taken from the picturae of Théâtre d’Amour, an anonymous early seventeenth-century adaptation of Heinsius’s collection Quaeris quid sit amor. The castle was declared a historic monument in 1994. Experts from the Administration des Monuments Historiques have estimated the wall paintings were executed somewhere between 1600 and 1610. At the time, the castle was owned by François de Bourbon, prince de Conti (1558 - 1614), who had inherited it from his first wife, Jeanne de Coeme († 1601). In 1605, the prince de Conti remarried. His second wife was Louise Marguerite de Lorraine-Guise (1574 - 1631). It is certainly tempting to speculate the prince ordered the wall paintings as a surprise for his new wife. ...|$|R
