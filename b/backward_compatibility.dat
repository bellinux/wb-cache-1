5|$|Microsoft added <b>backward</b> <b>compatibility</b> for {{the base}} game and its {{expansion}} on the company's Xbox One, {{the successor to}} the Xbox 360, in July 2016. Red Dead Redemption {{had been one of}} the most requested titles for the feature. The game's sales position on Amazon.com spiked following the announcement. The release runs at a smoother frame rate on the Xbox One.|$|E
5|$|A Wii console {{running a}} GameCube disc is {{restricted}} to GameCube functionality, and GameCube controller is required to play GameCube titles. A Nintendo GameCube Memory Card is also necessary to save game progress and content, since the Wii internal flash memory will not save GameCube games. Also, <b>backward</b> <b>compatibility</b> is limited in some areas. For example, online and LAN-enabled features for Nintendo GameCube titles are unavailable on the Wii, since the console lacks serial ports for the Nintendo GameCube Broadband Adapter and Modem Adapter.|$|E
5|$|The main {{microprocessor}} is a 16/32-bit Motorola 68000 CPU clocked at 7.6 MHz. The console uses a Zilog Z80 sub-processor, mainly used {{to control}} the sound hardware and provide <b>backward</b> <b>compatibility</b> with the Master System. The system has 72 kB of RAM, 64 kB of video RAM, and can display up to 61 colors at once from a palette of 512. The games are in ROM cartridge format and inserted in the top.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} tool for helping XML schema {{designers}} to obtain a high quality level for their specifications. The tool allows one to analyze relations between classes of XML documents and formally prove them. For instance, the tool {{can be used to}} check forward and <b>backward</b> <b>compatibilities</b> of recommendations. When such a relation does not hold, the tool allows one to identify the reasons and reports detailed counter-examples that exemplify the problem. For this purpose, the tool relies on recent advances in logic-based automated theorem proving techniques that allow for efficient reasoning on very large sets of XML documents. We believe this tool can be of great value for standardization bodies that define specifications using various XML type definition languages (such as W 3 C specifications), and are concerned with quality assurance for their normative recommendations...|$|R

5|$|The {{compilation}} was one {{of several}} ideas Rare considered to celebrate its 30th anniversary. Inspired by fans, upcoming Xbox One <b>backward</b> <b>compatibility</b> features, and a desire to link Rare's past and future, the company sorted through 120 games to choose titles that best represented its oeuvre. It prioritized games with characters and environments original to the company. Rare incorporated six hardware emulators in the package, and worked with its parent company, Microsoft, to use its unannounced Xbox 360 emulation. Rare Replay released worldwide as an Xbox One exclusive on August 4, 2015.|$|E
5|$|To ensure {{baseline}} compatibility {{between different}} HDMI sources and displays (as well as <b>backward</b> <b>compatibility</b> with the electrically compatible DVI standard) all HDMI devices must implement the sRGB color space at 8 bits per component. Ability {{to use the}} YCbCr color space and higher color depths ("deep color") is optional. HDMI permits sRGB 4:4:4 chroma subsampling (8–16 bits per component), xvYCC 4:4:4 chroma subsampling (8–16 bits per component), YCbCr 4:4:4 chroma subsampling (8–16 bits per component), or YCbCr 4:2:2 chroma subsampling (8–12 bits per component). The color spaces {{that can be used}} by HDMI are ITU-R BT.601, ITU-R BT.709-5 and IEC 61966-2-4.|$|E
5|$|Undead Nightmare {{received}} generally favorable reviews at its release. It {{was praised}} {{as a model}} for downloadable content and named among the best of the year, with top awards from the 2010 Spike Video Game Awards and Shacknews in this category. Critics praised Rockstar's production and handling of the hackneyed zombie video game motif, and noted its lightheartedness compared to the main game. Some reviewers struggled with the game's character movement controls and found the combat unvaried. The expansion sold two million copies at retail and is recalled as among the best downloadable content packs on record. Through <b>backward</b> <b>compatibility,</b> the Xbox One supports Undead Nightmare.|$|E

50|$|In a {{departure}} from the rest of Nikon's DSLR lineup, the Df does not record video, only still images; while most reviews were generally positive, this and other built-in limitations of the camera were seen as negatives. Also notable by their absence were built-in flash and a variety of automatic modes, though the <b>backward</b> lens <b>compatibility</b> extends to nearly the entirety of the Nikkor lineup since 1959.|$|R
5|$|Gold and Silver {{were first}} {{publicly}} showcased at the 1997 Nintendo SpaceWorld Expo in Japan, becoming {{the most popular}} exhibit at the program. Unlike the previous game in the series, Pokémon Yellow, the new titles were announced {{to be more than}} a small upgrade to Pokémon Red and Blue. Instead, they would feature a new storyline, a new world, and new species of Pokémon. Gold and Silver were designed for the Game Boy Color, allowing them full color support and more detailed sprites. Other additions that were shown included Pokémon breeding, held items, an in-game gadget known as the PokéGear, a real-time internal clock, and <b>backward</b> <b>compatibility</b> with the previous games in the series.|$|E
5|$|While the DSi's {{design is}} similar to that of the DS Lite, it {{features}} two digital cameras, supports internal and external content storage, and connects to an online store called the Nintendo DSi Shop. Nintendo stated that families often share DS and DS Lite consoles. Its new functionality was intended to facilitate personalization, so as to encourage each member of a household to purchase a DSi. The handheld supports exclusive physical media in addition to DS games with DSi-specific features and standard DS titles. The only exception to its <b>backward</b> <b>compatibility</b> are earlier DS games that required the GBA slot. Nintendo had sold over 41 million DSi and DSi XL units combined.|$|E
5|$|All three {{consoles}} provide titles {{from older}} consoles for download; the Xbox 360 through the Xbox Originals service, the PlayStation 3 through the PlayStation Store, and the Wii through the Virtual Console. When purchased, {{the game is}} saved to console's internal memory or, optionally on the Wii, to an inserted SD/SDHC card. Initially the Xbox 360 also provided Xbox Live support for backwards compatible games, but the service has since been discontinued for original Xbox games. No more games {{will be added to}} the list of backwards compatible games for the Xbox 360. In response to the lack of <b>backward</b> <b>compatibility</b> for most PS3s, many popular games have been released for download as PlayStation 2 Classics and other popular series have been updated with gameplay/graphics as high-definition remasters for PlayStation consoles and have been released on Blu-ray Disc or are available for download on the PlayStation Network.|$|E
50|$|Finale 2014 was {{released}} in November 2013 with new functions. As with all previous releases. a new file format was introduced, which is incompatible with older versions of Finale. However, this time easier file exchange with future versions of Finale was promised. Finale 2014's new functions include a rewritten file format for forward and <b>backward</b> file <b>compatibility,</b> improved Apple OS X support, a new audio engine, additional Garritan sounds, and a new user interface.|$|R

5|$|Batman: Arkham Origins was {{released}} worldwide on October 25, 2013 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, WiiU and Xbox 360. A week before its scheduled release in Europe, the retail Microsoft Windows and Wii U versions were delayed until November 8. A companion game, Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate, {{was released}} with Arkham Origins for Nintendo 3DS and PlayStation Vita. A spin-off beat 'em up game, also entitled , {{was developed by}} NetherRealm Studios for iOS and Android. The iOS version was released on October 16, 2013, and the Android version was scheduled for release in late 2013. NetherRealm Studios previously developed , a spin-off of Arkham City. The brawler game has players using touchscreen controls to fight enemies one-on-one (including villains such as Bane and Deathstroke). Defeating enemies earns points which can upgrade Batman's statistics or unlock gadgets and costumes; costumes unlocked in the game can unlock costumes in the console version and vice versa. In August 2017, the Xbox 360 version was made playable on Xbox One consoles through <b>backward</b> <b>compatibility.</b>|$|E
5|$|In July 2007, Sony {{announced}} {{a drop in}} the price of the console by $100. This measure only applied to the 60 GB models and was exclusive to the United States and Canada, where those models are no longer in production. On October 18, 2007, Sony {{announced a}} US$100 price drop for the 80GB model and a new US$399 40GB model to launch on November 2, 2007 with reduced features such as the removal of <b>backward</b> <b>compatibility</b> with PS2 games. Within weeks, Sony announced that sales of the 40 GB and 80 GB models by major retailers had increased 192%. In November 2008, Sony launched a $499 160 GB model, and on August 18, 2009, Sony announced the PS3 Slim. The PS3 slim sold 1 million in under a month. It was then announced that a 250GB slim model was to be released. It was released on September 1 (or 3 depending on country) and costs $299, £249 and €299. In Australia the console will cost A$499, which is A$200 less than the standard PS3. In September 2009, a $299 120 GB Slim Model was released. A $349 250 GB Model was later released later in 2009. In August 2010, the 160 GB Slim Model was released for $299. The same price for a 120 GB PS3 slim Model. In Japan, the 160GB slim model is also available in white. On September 17, 2010, Sony released the 320GB Slim Model, but it only sold with the PlayStation Move for US$399.99.|$|E
