5|$|MD7 {{is the old}} {{alignment}} of US40 in northeastern Maryland. The route was first laid out early in colonial times and later formed part of the post road between <b>Baltimore</b> <b>and</b> Philadelphia and between {{the northern and southern}} colonies. The highway in <b>Baltimore</b> <b>and</b> Harford counties became a turnpike in the 19th century. The Maryland State Roads Commission marked portions of {{what became known as the}} Philadelphia Road close to <b>Baltimore</b> <b>and</b> between Perryville and Elkton for improvement as state roads in 1909. Those sections and the highway between Aberdeen and Havre de Grace were constructed as modern roads in the early to mid-1910s. The remainder of the highway was constructed in the 1920s and designated US40 in 1927. The high volume of traffic and the required continuous expansion of the highway led the Maryland State Roads Commission to construct the modern Pulaski Highway between 1935 and 1941. Old sections of US40 became segments of MD7 between 1938 and 1941 as portions of the new four-lane divided highway opened from Baltimore to Elkton.|$|E
