A <b>basic</b> <b>design</b> <b>requirement</b> of OPALES is that it must permit and support the integration of new services throughout its life cycle. Thus, IUHM depends heavily upon the notions of extensibility and openness. Support for openness, extensibility and late binding of services is provided in the IUHM model by a single reflexive mechanism. This uniform mechanism is used for describing all relationships between arbitrary system entities, including services, data and metadata. The mechanism in question consists of a generic, computable hypertext structure with typed links, known as the Information Unit, and is the minimal structural scheme to which all encapsulated entities comply. We describe and justify the design of the Information Unit, as well as the semantics of its four link types, namely role, type, owner, relative. We further describe the minimal kernel of the runtime layer responsible for the dynamic behaviour specified by the IUHM compliant hypertext network. We discuss the mechanisms involved in the dynamic binding of services and service composition. We illustrate these notions by real-world examples of the integration of metadata services within the OPALES system.

Amongst several factors, safety and reliability of battery packs present the highest challenges to large scale electrification of public and private transportation sectors. This paper reviews mechanical design features that can address these issues. More than 75 sources including scientific and technical literature and particularly 43 US Patents are studied.

40|$|The Facility Manager of a {{laboratory}} environment continuously walks {{a fine line}} between safe and economical operation of that facility. The primary responsibility of the laboratory is to provide a safe environment for personnel while optimizing the space for experiment. Energy efficiency is not a necessary goal. Laboratories typically require HVAC systems utilizing 100 % outside air to protect the occupants. Facilities demanding the <b>basic</b> <b>design</b> <b>requirement</b> of 100 % outside air can result in annual energy costs 4 to 5 times greater than that of the typical office building requiring 20 CFM per person. With energy costs typically representing a substantial part of an organizations operating budget is it prudent for facility managers to seek opportunities to reduce these costs. The intent of this research is to show that participation of a knowledgeable Facility Manager, during the initial design phase of {{a laboratory}} facility, can result in a finished product capable of easily incorporating a variety of energy efficiency technologies. The scope of this research is limited to smaller chemical laboratories supported with less than 20, 000 CFM of comfort air. When the Facility Manager actively participates in the design process for laboratory environments there is potential for increased HVAC energy efficiency. A substantial portion of this research has been conducted from the authors daily experience and responsibility for a small chemical laboratory. Additional data was collected using personal interviews among industry experts and fellow colleagues working in the Atlanta metropolitan area with significant laboratory experience. This research focused on the mechanical systems supporting laboratories as they represent the largest percentage in first costs, energy consumption, and offer the greatest opportunity for energy reduction. The results of this research are intended to provide guidance to Facility Managers to incorporate cost effective energy recovery systems in either new construction or at a future date.

40|$|Prevention of {{adjacent}} building {{damage is}} {{recognized as one of}} the most important tasks in a deep braced excavation in urban area. However, the traditional excavation design method can’t consider the uncertainties of geotechnical engineering. As a result, engineering often face the problem of over-design or under-design and associated disputes and lawsuits. The performance-based design of a brace excavation system may offer a more rational way to prevent building damage. Nevertheless, no procedures are currently available for assessing serviceability performance of braced excavation systems, probably because of the difficulty in defining and formulating serviceability limit state. The main objective of the proposed research is to establish a framework with which the performance of geotechnical structures such as braced excavation system, in terms of the serviceability reliability, can be assessed. This proposal is serial based on previous study. To achieve the <b>basic</b> performance-based <b>design</b> <b>requirements,</b> this project will conduct a series of study including ultimate limit states and serviceability limit states. Based on the results of the analyses and the knowledge generated, guidelines and procedure for performance-based design of braced excavation will be developed.
