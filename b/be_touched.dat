5|$|There {{are several}} {{non-contact}} variants of American football, such as flag football. In flag football the ballcarrier is not tackled; instead, defenders aim {{to pull a}} flag tied around his waist. Another variant, touch football, simply requires the ballcarrier to <b>be</b> <b>touched</b> to be considered downed. A game of touch football may require that the player <b>be</b> <b>touched</b> with either one or two hands to be considered down, depending on the rules used.|$|E
5|$|The demonologist Pierre de Lancre (1553–1631) {{boasted that}} even dead French monarchs could heal; it was, indeed, still {{believed}} in the 16th century that the healing power was retained by Saint Louis IX's arm, preserved in Poblet Monastery in Catalonia. In order to <b>be</b> <b>touched</b> by the French king, people traveled from as far off as the present-day Italy and Spain already in the 13th century. The foreigners were ranked in a specific order, with the Spanish taking precedence over all others and the king's own subjects coming last.|$|E
5|$|The player {{controls}} Neku {{by performing}} touchscreen actions {{based on the}} currently equipped pins. These actions may include slashing across an enemy, tapping the screen rapidly to fire bullets, holding down on an enemy to inflict damage or shouting into the microphone to cause a full screen attack. Other pins need to <b>be</b> <b>touched</b> to activate them, such as for health restoration. Each pin has {{a limited number of}} uses before it must recharge for a certain time. Other pins may only be used a fixed number of times during a series of battles, and do not recharge until the battle sequence is over. Neku can only be equipped with a maximum of two pins at the game's start; this can eventually be upgraded to a maximum of six.|$|E

40|$|I {{introduce}} a puzzle about contact and de re temporal predication in relativistic spacetime. In particular, I describe an apparent counterexample {{to the following}} principle, roughly stated: if B is never {{in a position to}} say ‘I <b>was</b> <b>touching</b> A, I <b>am</b> <b>touching</b> A, and I will <b>be</b> <b>touching</b> A’, then (time travel aside) A is never in a position to say ‘I <b>was</b> <b>touching</b> B, I <b>am</b> <b>touching</b> B, and I will <b>be</b> <b>touching</b> B’. In the case I present, the most that A is ever in a position to say is: ‘I <b>am</b> now <b>touching</b> B, but this is the only instant at which this will ever be so’. B, on the other hand, can say: ‘I <b>was</b> formerly <b>touching</b> A, I <b>am</b> currently <b>touching</b> A, and I will in the future <b>be</b> <b>touching</b> A’.

40|$|In our research, {{we aim to}} {{construct}} the visual-haptic system which generate haptic feedback as if they <b>were</b> <b>touching</b> {{on the surface of}} various virtual objects, even though they <b>are</b> <b>touching</b> only a static shape. We focus on the cross modal effect between our vision and haptic sense, which is generally called Pseudo-Haptics, and make up a illusionary haptics only using visual feedback, without any complicated physical devices. In our system, user touches the physical object behind the LCD, and sees the virtual object through the LCD using video see-through methodology. We put two web cameras to provide the different image for each eye and maintain the optical conjugation between viewpoint and cameras using the mirror {{in the back of the}} LCD. From images captured by these cameras, we compose visual feedback as if they <b>were</b> <b>touching</b> another virtual shape, based on the detection of the point where they <b>are</b> <b>touching</b> the physical object. This makes up a haptic illusion as if they <b>were</b> <b>touching</b> the virtual shape. By our proposed system, users perceive visual and haptic sensation as if they <b>were</b> <b>touching</b> various virtual shapes, without any complicated physical devices...|$|R
5|$|The rituals {{performed}} at the statue by pregnant women involved walking round three times, reciting charms and touching one's abdomen. Women would also carry a band which would either <b>be</b> <b>touched</b> to the statue and then tied around their waist, or half of the band would be tied to the statue while the remaining half would be kept on the woman's body until the child was born. After the childbirth, the basin {{in front of the}} statue was used by women to bathe in. The rites performed in the honour of the statue were said to be similar to those performed by Phoenicians in the worship of their Venus.|$|E
5|$|Docile and slow-moving, zebra {{sharks are}} not {{dangerous}} to humans {{and can be}} easily approached underwater. However, they have bitten divers who pull on their tails or attempt to ride them. As of 2008 there is one record of an unprovoked attack in the International Shark Attack File, though no injuries resulted. They are popular attractions for ecotourist divers in the Red Sea, off the Maldives, off Thailand's Phuket and Phi Phi islands, on the Great Barrier Reef, and elsewhere. Many zebra sharks at diving sites have become accustomed {{to the presence of}} humans, taking food from divers' hands and allowing themselves to <b>be</b> <b>touched.</b> The zebra shark adapts well to captivity and is displayed by a number of public aquaria around the world. The small, attractively colored young also find their way into the hands of private hobbyists, though this species grows far too large for the home aquarium.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, Abbe {{moved to}} Kyoto {{with his mother}} and his sister Toyoka so that he could attend Busen, {{training}} in both the judo and kendo programmes. Abbe learned kendo under the direction of Busen's head sword instructor, Kinnosuke Ogawa, a master who held the rank of 10th dan. He recalled that his instructor, at the age of 75 years, was so skilled that he could not <b>be</b> <b>touched</b> by any of the students or younger instructors. Every Saturday afternoon at Busen, following tradition, judo tournaments were held. Abbe fought five opponents in succession with each contest lasting five minutes, and he won all or almost all of these matches. In his first year at Busen, he was promoted to 4th dan in judo. In the autumn of his second year there, he was promoted to 5th dan, by which time he was reported to have been fighting 20 opponents in succession.|$|E

5|$|The Doctor, River, Amy, and Rory {{suddenly}} {{find themselves}} near the TARDIS in a New York graveyard back in 2012, Rory's plan having worked. As the four prepare to depart, Rory catches {{sight of a}} tombstone with his name on it. He is then touched by a surviving, albeit weakened, Angel and sent into the past. The Doctor is unable to take the TARDIS back to get him, due to the paradox Rory and Amy created. Amy refuses to be parted from Rory and willingly allows herself to <b>be</b> <b>touched</b> by the same Angel {{in the hopes of}} being sent back to the same time as he was. Her name then appears along with Rory's on the tombstone. The Doctor is distraught, but River reminds him that while their fates are now sealed, Amy likely published the Melody Malone book in the past and may have left him a message. The Doctor races back to where they had their picnic and recovers the final page, finding the afterword written by Amy to him. Amy explains that she and Rory lived out a good and happy life for themselves, and asks the Doctor to visit her childhood self to assure her that he will come back for her to take her on amazing journeys. The episode ends with a young Amelia Pond sitting in her back garden, then looking up and smiling as the TARDIS engines are heard.|$|E

Nevertheless, if {{the ends of}} the nails or hairs <b>are</b> <b>touched,</b> ever so lightly, we feel that they <b>are</b> <b>touched,</b> and the sensation seems to be situated in the nails or hairs. Nay more, if a walking-stick a yard long is held firmly by the handle and the other end <b>is</b> <b>touched,</b> the tactile sensation, which is a state of our own consciousness, is unhesitatingly referred {{to the end of the}} stick; and yet no one will say that it is there.|$|R
