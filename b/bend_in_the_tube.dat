50|$|The {{telescope}} {{consisted of}} two tubes screwed to the central cube of the axis. The tubes were usually conical and as stiff as possible to help prevent flexure. The connection to the axis was also as firm as possible, as flexure of the tube would affect declinations deduced from observations. The flexure in the horizontal position of the tube was determined by two collimators - telescopes placed horizontally in the meridian, {{north and south of}} the transit circle, with their objective lenses towards it. These were pointed at one another (through holes in the tube of the telescope, or by removing the telescope from its mount) so that the crosshairs in their foci coincided. The collimators were often permanently mounted in these positions, with their objectives and eyepieces fixed to separate piers. The meridian telescope was pointed to one collimator and then the other, moving through exactly 180°, and by reading the circle the amount of flexure (the amount the readings differed from 180°) was found. Absolute flexure, that is, a fixed <b>bend</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tube,</b> was detected by arranging that eyepiece and objective lens could be interchanged, and the average of the two observations of the same star was free from this error.|$|E
40|$|The {{question}} whether, {{and if so}} to what extent, hemodynamic {{forces and}} mechanical stimuli do modulate the morphogenesis of the vascular system is a century-old problem. It is important especially in the outflow tract where a spiraling septum develops in and after a strong <b>bend</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tube.</b> Spiraling patterns of the flow in bends are well known. Of the mechanical stimuli that can potentially exert an effect on morphogenesis, wall shear stress {{is the most likely}} candidate; a number of genes that are expressed in the cardiovascular system have shear-stress responsive elements in their regulatory units. Recent investigations have clearly shown that the disturbance of normal hemodynamic conditions results in maldevelopment of the heart. However, an experimental model alone is necessary, but not sufficient to identify the intermediate steps of the interaction between blood flow and tissue remodeling in the developing cardiovascular system, certainly at Reynolds numbers and Dean numbers that are very small. Therefore, a model with a simple geometry has been created, using the ComFlo software: a fully 3 D computational fluid-dynamics code that solves the Navier-Stokes equations on a Cartesian grid. A first assessment of the possible influence of a strong curvature, with biological realistic dimensions, was made using steady-flow conditions. Since both the Reynolds number and the Womersley number (indicating the influence of the pulsatility on the velocity profile of the flow) are extremely low, it is likely that these flow patterns do not differ significantly from those under pulsatile conditions. A first assessment {{of the effects of the}} strong curvature on the flow under the given circumstances showed only very small secondary velocities and negligible heterogeneity of the wall shear stress, even in the presence of a strong secondary flow pattern in the inlet of the tube. ...|$|E

Some spaceframes have been designed with removable sections, joined by bolted pin joints. Such a structure had already been used around the engine of the Lotus Mark III.

40|$|A calibrator, {{referred}} to as the spider design, can be used to calibrate probes incorporating multiple acoustic sensing elements. The application is an acoustic energy density probe, although the calibrator can be used for other types of acoustic probes. The calibrator relies on the use of acoustic waveguide technology to produce the same acoustic field at each of the sensing elements. As a result, the sensing elements can be separated from each other, but still calibrated through use of the acoustic waveguides. Standard calibration techniques involve placement of an individual microphone into a small cavity with a known, uniform pressure to perform the calibration. If a cavity is manufactured with sufficient size to insert the energy density probe, it has been found that a uniform pressure field can only be created at very low frequencies, due {{to the size of the}} probe. The size of the energy density probe prevents one from having the same pressure at each microphone in a cavity, due to the wave effects. The "spider" design probe is effective in calibrating multiple microphones separated from each other. The spider design ensures that the same wave effects exist for each microphone, each with an indivdual sound path. The calibrator s speaker is mounted at one end of a 14 -cm-long and 4. 1 -cm diameter small plane-wave tube. This length was chosen so that the first evanescent cross mode of <b>the</b> plane-wave <b>tube</b> would be attenuated by about 90 dB, thus leaving just the plane wave at the termination plane of <b>the</b> <b>tube.</b> <b>The</b> <b>tube</b> terminates with a small, acrylic plate with five holes placed symmetrically about the axis of the speaker. Four ports are included for the four microphones on the probe. The fifth port is included for the pre-calibrated reference microphone. <b>The</b> ports <b>in</b> <b>the</b> acrylic plate are in turn connected to the probe sensing elements via flexible PVC tubes. These five <b>tubes</b> are <b>the</b> same length, so the acoustic wave effects are <b>the</b> same <b>in</b> each <b>tube.</b> <b>The</b> flexible nature of <b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> allows them to be positioned so that each tube terminates at one of the microphones of the energy density probe, which is mounted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> acrylic structure, or the calibrated reference microphone. Tests performed verify that the pressure did not vary due to <b>bends</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tubes.</b> <b>The</b> results of these tests indicate that the average sound pressure level <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> varied by only 0. 03 dB as <b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> were bent to various angles. The current calibrator design is effective up to a frequency of approximately 4. 5 kHz. This upper design frequency is largely due to the diameter of <b>the</b> plane-wave <b>tubes...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{thorough}} {{analysis of}} the cuticular parts of tardigrade feeding apparatuses was performed {{in order to provide}} a more complete understanding of their evolution and their potential homologies with other animal phyla (e. g. Cycloneuralia and Arthropoda). The buccal- pharyngeal apparatuses of eight species belonging to both Eutardigrada and Heterotardigrada were studied using light and scanning electron microscopy. This study supports and completes a previous study on the relationships between form and function <b>in</b> <b>the</b> buccalpharyngeal apparatus of eutardigrades. The common sclerified structures of the tardigrade buccal-pharyngeal apparatus are: a buccal ring connected to a straight buccal tube, a buccal crown, longitudinal thickenings within the pharynx, and a stylet system composed of piercing stylets within stylet coats, and stylet supports. Specifically, heterotardigrades (Echiniscoidea) have a narrow buccal tube; long piercing stylets, each with a longitudinal groove, that cross one another before exiting the mouth; pharyngeal bars and secondary longitudinal thickenings within <b>the</b> pharynx. <b>In</b> contrast, eutardigrades have stylets which are shorter than the buccal tube; Parachela have pharyngeal apophyses and placoids within the pharynx, while Apochela lack a buccal crown and cuticular thickenings within the pharynx, <b>the</b> buccal <b>tube</b> is very wide, and the short stylets are associated with triangular-shaped stylet supports. In both classes, when the piercing stylet tips emerge from the mouth to pierce food, <b>the</b> buccal <b>tube</b> opening is almost completely obstructed, which may hinder food uptake. <b>In</b> heterotardigrades, <b>the</b> crossing of the piercing stylets may further decrease food uptake, however this disadvantage may have been reduced <b>in</b> echiniscids by <b>the</b> evolution of a long buccal tube and long stylets able to run more parallel to <b>the</b> buccal <b>tube.</b> <b>In</b> contrast, eutardigrades evolved different strategies. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> order Apochela and in several Itaquasconinae (Parachela), <b>the</b> buccal <b>tube</b> is wide, <b>the</b> stylets are short and run parallel to <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> without crossing. <b>In</b> other Parachela, <b>the</b> piercing stylets do not cross one another because they are curved. Further, the development of an anterior <b>bend</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> buccal <b>tube</b> (e. g. in Doryphoribius and Macrobiotoidea) may allow the shift of the stylet sheaths to a more ventral position so that a wide portion of the mouth is free during the piercing stylet movements.

40|$|The fuel {{elements}} for the Borax-IV {{boiling water reactor}} consisted of ThO/sub 2 / [...] 6. 36 wt% U 0 /sub 2 / pellets lead-bonded in X 8001 aluminum alloy tube plates with silicon-bonded end closures. When the reactor was brought to power on February 19, 1958, after having been operated for approximately one year, over one-third of the {{fuel elements}} {{were found to have}} developed leaks, as evidenced by significant fission gas release into the process water. Since no fission breaks had been detected during the last previous operation of the reactor on December 5, 1957, it appeared that the lesks had developed during the 21 / 2 -month shutdown. A detailed metallurgical examination was made of two elements containing several failed <b>tubes</b> to determine <b>the</b> causes of failure and the amount of fission gas released from oxide pellets in unfailed tubes. lt was found that the upper portion of each tube, where a void space had been intentionally left above the pellets, had collapsed under the reactor operating pressure. The reverse <b>bending</b> which occurred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> walls caused local cracking. The most probable cause for the lesks which developed during shutdown is considered to be corrosion in cracks and crevices of the collapsed tubing.

Basal constriction is laminin-dependent, with actin enriched at the basolateral surface of the constricted cells. Wnt 5 is highly expressed specifically at the MHBC prior to and during basal constriction and is required for this process. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is activated by phosphorylation at the MHBC and is required for basal constriction. FAK activation at the MHBC is dependent upon Wnt 5 function. Loss of basal constriction in Wnt 5 and FAK loss-of-function embryos can be rescued by inhibiting Gsk 3 p. These data suggest a novel pathway in which Wnt 5 activates FAK <b>in</b> conjunction with <b>the</b> inhibition of Gsk 3 P to drive basal constriction at the MHBC.
