The {{problem of}} {{maintaining}} consistent representations of solids, in computer-aided design, and of giving rigorous proofs of error bounds for operations such as regularized <b>Boolean</b> <b>intersection,</b> {{has been widely}} studied {{for at least two}} decades. One of the major difficulties is that the representations used in practice are not only in error, they are fundamentally inconsistent. Such inconsistency {{is one of the main}} bottlenecks in downstream applications. This paper provides a framework for error analysis in the context of solid modeling, in the case where the data is represented using the standard representational method, and where the data may be uncertain. Included are discussions of ill-condition, error measurement, stability of algorithms, inconsistency of defining data, and the question of when we should invoke methods outside the scope of numerical analysis. A solution to the inconsistency problem is proposed and supported by theorems: it is based on the use of Whitney extension to define sets, called QuasiNURBS sets, which are viewed as realizations of the inconsistent data provided to the numerical method.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to model water {{reservoir}} site selection for a real world application in the administrative district of Debub, Eritrea. This is a region were scarcity of water is a fundamental problem. Erratic rainfall, drought and unfavourable hydro-geological characteristics exacerbates the region’s water supply. Consequently, the population of Debub is facing severe water shortages and building reservoirs has been promoted as a possible solution to meet the future demand of water supply. This was the most powerful motivation to identify candidate sites for locating water reservoirs. A number of conflicting qualitative and quantitative criteria exist for evaluating alternative sites. Decisions regarding criteria are often accompanied by ambiguities and vagueness. This makes fuzzy logic a more natural approach to this kind of Multi-criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) problems.

The solution of a multiple-valued problem is a subset of vk v-valued tuples of the length k, where k {{is the number of}} variables and v is the number of their possible values. This paper compares several approaches which solve such problems. These approaches are applied to the well-known Sudoku problem of 81 9 -valued variables. Hence, the search space for this finite problem has a size of 981 (approximately 1. 9 ∗ 1077). We take as an example {{one of the most difficult}} Sudoku problems where 17 entries are given, the smallest number which results in a unique solution. Additionally, we remove one of these entries to get a more difficult multiple-valued problem for which a set of solutions exists. We show how the required model can be built. Several approaches and the respective solution are explained. Utilizing XBOOLE on a GPU, all 44, 664 solutions of a 25 -clue Sudoku were found 20 times faster than by a SAT-solver.

40|$|Multi-axis milling {{operations}} {{are widely used}} in many industries such as aerospace, automotive and die-mold for machining intricate sculptured surfaces. The most important aspects in machining {{operations are}} the dimensional integrity, surface quality and productivity. Process models are employed in order to predict feasible and proper process conditions without relying on empirical methods based on trial and error cutting and adaptation of previous experiences. However, previously developed process models are often case specific where the model can only be employed for some particular milling tools or they are not applicable for multi-axis operations. In many cases, custom tools with intricate profile geometries are compatible with the surface profile to be machined. On the other hand, for more robust and stable cutting operations, tools with wavy cutting edge profiles and varying geometric edge distributions are utilized. In this thesis, a complete numerical mechanic and dynamic process model is proposed where the tool is modeled as a point cloud in the cylindrical coordinates along the tool axis. The tool geometry is extracted from CAD data enabling to form a model for any custom tool. In addition, the variation in the cutting edge geometry, where serrated and variable helix/pitch cutting edges can be adapted for any milling tool is taken into account. The cutting engagement boundaries are identified numerically using a <b>Boolean</b> <b>intersection</b> scheme. Moreover, a Z-mapping algorithm is integrated in the proposed multi-axis mechanistic force model to predict cutting forces for a continuous process.
