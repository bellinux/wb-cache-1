50|$|The {{stationary}} (stator) windings of an outrunner motor {{are excited}} by conventional DC <b>brushless</b> motor <b>controllers.</b> A direct current (switched {{on and off}} at high frequency for voltage modulation) is typically passed through three or more non-adjacent windings together, and the group so energized is alternated electronically based upon rotor position feedback. The number of permanent magnets in the rotor does not match the number of stator poles, however. This is to reduce Cogging torque and create a sinusoidal back emf. The number of magnet poles divided by 2 gives the ratio of magnetic field frequency to motor rotation frequency.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} meet higher {{performance}} demands on <b>brushless</b> motor <b>controllers,</b> motor feedback signals must meet correspondingly higher standards. <b>Brushless</b> motor <b>controllers</b> require angular feedback for motor commutation, and generally for {{one or more of}} the following: torque, velocity or position regulation. These feedback categories impose different requirements on the control system. In many brushless motor applications, sinusoidal encoders have significant advantages over square-wave encoders. Signal processing techniques for sinusoidal encoder feedback signals are considered in the context of a brushless motor positioning system. In particular, a method is presented for correcting gain and offset measurement errors based on ellipse-fitting techniques. Acknowledgments “If I have seen farther than others, it is because I have stood on the shoulders of giants. ” – Sir Isaac Newton, (1642 – 1727) I can only begin to describe the debt of gratitude that I owe to Jason Lewis. Jason went out of his way to bring me up to speed on brushless motor technology, always making sure that I saw how each component fit into the overall system. This is the sort of priceless learning that one simply cannot get from textbooks. While I worked at MCS, Worth Burruss was very understanding of my academic schedule. Between Worth and Jason, I couldn’t have asked for better managers. I also owe a big thanks to the rest of the folks at MCS who tolerated the occasional release of “magic smoke ” from lab prototypes...|$|R

40|$|In this report, simple, {{low-cost}} {{design and}} prototyping methods for custom brushless permanent magnet synchronous motors are explored. Three case-study motors {{are used to}} develop, illustrate and validate the methods. Two 500 W hub motors are implemented in a direct-drive electric scooter. The third case study, a 10 kW axial flux motor, is used to demonstrate {{the flexibility of the}} design methods. A variety of ways to predict the motor constant, which relates torque to current and speed to voltage, are presented. The predictions range from first-order DC estimates to full dynamic simulations, yielding increasingly accurate results. Ways to predict winding resistance, as well as other sources of loss in motors, are discussed {{in the context of the}} motor's overall power rating. Rapid prototyping methods for brushless motors prove to be useful in the fabrication of the case study motors. Simple no-load evaluation techniques confirm the predicted motor constants without large, expensive test equipment. Methods for <b>brushless</b> motor <b>controller</b> design and prototyping are also presented. The case study, a two channel, 1 kW per channel <b>brushless</b> motor <b>controller,</b> is fully developed and used to illustrate these methods. The electrical requirements of the controller (voltage, current, frequency) influence the selection of components, such as power transistors and bus capacitors. Mechanical requirements, such as overall dimensions, heat transfer, and vibration tolerance, also play a large role in the design. With full-system prototyping in mind, the controller integrates wireless data acquisition for debugging. Field-oriented AC control is implemented on low-cost hardware using a novel modification of the standard synchronous current regulator. The controller performance is evaluated under load on two case study systems: On the direct-drive electric scooter, it simultaneously and independently controls the two motors. On a high-performance remote-control car, a more extreme operating point is tested with one motor. by Shane W. Colton. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|ABSTRACT: Currently, many {{different}} types of dedicated PWM motor control IC’s are available in the market to control DC and brushless DC motors. Unfortunately, switching schemes of these IC’s are either fixed or limited in flexibility, resulting in higher noise and poor efficiency in many cases. In this article, more than 5 different switching schemes are presented and relative advantages and drawbacks of each mode are compared. It was found that selection of the switching scheme affects performance characteristics such as current ripples in DC link, line current harmonics, and losses in the motors and drives. Based on the motor parameters and application requirements, selection of optimal switching scheme and PWM frequency can improve operating efficiency and motor/drive sizing. In addition, a simple DSP-based programmable <b>brushless</b> motor <b>controller</b> design capable to select any one of the above 5 switching schemes or Hall sensor-based sinusoidal scheme is demonstrated.

Brushless ESC systems basically create a tri-phase AC power output of limited voltage from an onboard DC power input, to run brushless motors by sending a sequence of AC signals generated from the ESC's circuitry, employing a very low impedance for rotation.

40|$|In {{high speed}} applications, slotless {{permanent}} magnet (PM) motors appear an attractive solution, being almost insensitive to magneto-motive force harmonics and to pulsewidth modulation (PWM) current ripple and exhibiting lower stator iron losses and rotor losses (signiﬁcant with squarewave current control).

40|$|In {{order to}} meet the {{requirement}} of reliably running which is by Electric Vehicle for motor controller, the paper is focused on a sensorless <b>brushless</b> DC motor <b>controller</b> design and a commutation point method. By utilizing the saturation effect of stator iron core, six short voltage pulses are employed to estimate the initial rotor position. After that a series of voltage pulses are used to accelerate the motor. When the motor reaches a certain speed at which the back-electromotive force (EMF) method can be applied, the running state of the motor is smoothly switched at the moment determined by the relationship between the terminal voltage waveform and the commutation phases. “Lagging 90 ?-α commutation” is bring forward to overcome the shortages existing in the traditional method.

40|$|In this paper, {{a new and}} novel {{mathematical}} fuzzy hybrid {{scheme is}} proposed for the stabilization of a tri-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).

40|$|This {{invention}} is an electronically commutated <b>brushless</b> motor <b>controller</b> {{that incorporates}} Hall-array sensing in a small, 42 -gram package that provides 4096 absolute counts per motor revolution position sensing. The unit {{is the size}} of a miniature hockey puck, and is a 44 -pin male connector that provides many I/O channels, including CANbus, RS- 232 communications, general-purpose analog and digital I/O (GPIO), analog and digital Hall inputs, DC power input (18 - 90 VDC, 0 -l 0 A), three-phase motor outputs, and a strain gauge amplifier. This controller replaces air cooling with conduction cooling via a high-thermal-conductivity epoxy casting. A secondary advantage of the relatively good heat conductivity that comes with ultra-small size is that temperature differences within the controller become smaller, so that it is easier to measure the hottest temperature in the controller with fewer temperature sensors, or even one temperature sensor. Another size-sensitive design feature is in the approach to electrical noise immunity. At a very small size, where conduction paths are much shorter than in conventional designs, the ground becomes essentially isopotential, and so certain (space-consuming) electrical noise control components become unnecessary, which helps make small size possible. One winding-current sensor, applied to all of the windings in fast sequence, is smaller and wastes less power than the two or more sensors conventionally used to sense and control winding currents. An unexpected benefit of using only one current sensor is that it actually improves the precision of current control by using the "same" sensors to read each of the three phases. Folding the encoder directly into the controller electronics eliminates a great deal of redundant electronics, packaging, connectors, and hook-up wiring. The reduction of wires and connectors subtracts substantial bulk and eliminates their role in behaving as EMI (electro-magnetic interference) antennas. A shared knowledge by each motor controller of the state of all the motors in the system at 500 Hz also allows parallel processing of higher-level kinematic matrix calculations...|$|R

The main processing module utilized an 80188 processor as the master controller and was a plug-in type card for an IBM PC-AT computer, which acted as the system host. The slave board was responsible for generating the three phase voltages necessary for the commutation of an AC brushless motor. These boards were in constant communication with the resolver interface board which was used to determine motor position based on resolver feedback signals. Modelling and simulation software was developed which provided a flexible platform in which various motion control algorithms could be examined and tested. The modelling program analyzed the dynamic response of the position control system while the simulation software examined the stability and performance of the closed loop system.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to develop a telerobotic master device consisting of a 7 -axis backdrivable robotic arm, and a pressure-sensitive grip-controller integrated with a Compact Remote Console (CRC), thus creating a highly functional teleoperation station targeted to control a 6 -axis industrial robotic arm and dexterous robotic hand to be used for demolition work in a nuclear setting. We successfully completed the development of one of the world?s smallest <b>brushless</b> motor <b>controllers</b> due partially to funding through this grant. These controllers are used to drive the motors in the master robotic arm. We also completed the development of an improved model of a highly advanced 4 degree-of-freedom arm ? this same arm is the core component in the teleoperation system. The WAM arm and a 3 -axis gimbals were integrated with a commercially available CRC at our consultant?s lab at University of Tennessee. Additional support hardware and software were combined to tie the master control system to an existing industrial robot in the lab. A master controller for a dexterous hand was developed and became {{an integral part of the}} gimbals handle. Control algorithms were developed and the software was written and implemented. The entire system was then debugged and tested. Results of the prototype system are promising. The WAM Arm, gimbals, hand controller and CRC were successful integrated. Testing of the system to control the 6 -axis industrial arm and prototype dexterous hand showed great potential. Relatively simple tasks were successfully performed at slow speeds. Some of the testing was hampered by problems with the slave dexterous hand. This is a prototype hand being developed by Barrett under a different Phase II program. Potential improvements and advancements to the system include improving the control code, and integration of a 2 nd master controller arm in order to drive a 2 nd slave arm and hand. In summary, the device is a complex system with advanced features and could be used as a universal platform for efficient controlling of robotic arms performing remote tasks in unstructured and uncertain environments such as those prevalent in environmental clean up...|$|R
50|$|Spidernaut is an {{arachnid}} inspired Extra Vehicular Robot (EVR) that {{is being}} designed by a NASA for construction, maintenance, and repair projects in future space missions {{that would be too}} difficult or too dangerous for a human. The Spidernaut’s legs can move at three different points, one rotary joint in the hip and two more joints that are linear actuated. Each leg weighs 40 pounds but is capable of supporting 100 pounds and exerting upwards of 250 pounds of force. With the robots final weight of nearly 600 pounds evenly spread out across its eight legs Spidernaut will be able to climb across many surfaces including solar panels and the exterior of space craft without causing any damage. The feet of the robot are modular, meaning they can be removed and replaced for different situations that the robot may be placed in. The avionics and other electrical systems of the Spidernaut are located in what would be its thorax and are made up of <b>brushless</b> DC motor <b>controllers</b> and power and data distributors along with the power source. The robot is powered by a 72V/3600 Watt-hour lithium ion battery, which feeds a Power Conditioning and Distribution Module which down converts the 72V main bus to all the needed voltages for all the different devices on board. NASA has also begun experimenting with a “web” like cable deployment system that would allow the robot to climb and hang above structures that cannot support even light forces.|$|R
