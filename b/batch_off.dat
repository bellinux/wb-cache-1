40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work was to formulate and evaluate Mouth dissolving film of Domperidone. Domperidone is ideally suited for treatment of emesis. Mouth dissolving film of Domperidone is helpfulin the vomiting during journey. Mouth dissolving films were prepared by Solvent casting technique andit is In vitro performance was evaluated by the usual pharmacopoeial and unofficial tests. The majoradvantage of the preparation technique includes fewer operation units, better content uniformity. TheMouth dissolving film formed was additionally found to be disintegrated within 1 min. The ratio ofcomponents in the Aqueous phase affected the thickness, drug content, tensile strength, percentageelongation, folding endurance, and release profile of Mouth dissolving film and the best results wereobtained at the PVA(200 mg) and Glycerin(30 mg) The optimized formulation consists of <b>batch</b> <b>ofF</b> 2. Due to low PVA content it has optimum tensile strength and thickness. The developed mouthdissolving film of Domperidone might be clinically used for fast release of drug in mouth, for betterdrug utilization and improved patient compliance...|$|E

Unfortunately, {{in the real world}} of manufacturing, many factors combine to make each unit unique and, therefore, a need for validation exists. In the current article, the importance of validation in the pharmaceutical in-dustry is described along with four basis benchmarks for total validation success. Guidelines for measuring validation productivity are discussed. Validation payback from several areas is explained, keeping justifcation of validation activities in mind. Starting a strong validation program takes time. It has an initial cost, but the total cost of poor quality is much higher. High quality is a key indicator of product superi-ority. A systematic validation program improves product quality on one hand and enhances productivity on the other. Prevention such as validation is often not hard to do, it is just hard to sell...|$|R

500|$|The first He 111B {{made its}} maiden flight {{in the autumn}} of 1936. The first {{production}} <b>batch</b> rolled <b>off</b> the production lines that summer, at Rostock. Seven B-0 pre-production aircraft were built, bearing the Werknummern (Works numbers) 1431 to 1437. The B-0s were powered by DB 600C engines fitted with variable pitch airscrews. The screws increased output by 149kW (200hp). The B-0 had a MG 15 machine gun installed in the nose. The B-0 could also carry 1,500kg (3,310lb) in their vertical cells. The B-1 had some minor improvements, including the installation of a revolving gun-mount in the nose and a flexible Ikaria turret under the fuselage. After improvements, the RLM ordered 300 He 111B-1s; the first were delivered in January 1937. In the B-2 variant, engines were upgraded to the supercharged 634kW (850hp) DB 600C, or in some cases, the 690kW (925hp) 600G. The B-2 began to roll off the production lines at Oranienburg in 1937. The He 111B-3 was a modified trainer. Some 255 B-1s were ordered. However, the production orders were impossible to fulfill and only 28 B-1s were built. Owing to the production of the new He 111E, only a handful of He 111B-3s were produced. Due to insufficient capacity, Dornier, Arado and Junkers built the He 111B series at their plants in Wismar, Brandenburg and Dessau, respectively.

40|$|This work {{deals with}} {{parallel}} optimization of expensive objective functions which are modeled as sample realizations of Gaussian processes. The study is formalized as a Bayesian optimization problem, or continuous multi-armed bandit problem, where {{a batch of}} q > 0 arms is pulled in parallel at each iteration. Several algorithms {{have been developed for}} choosing <b>batches</b> by trading <b>off</b> exploitation and exploration. As of today, the maximum Expected Improvement (EI) and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) selection rules appear as the most prominent approaches for batch selection. Here, we build upon recent work on the multipoint Expected Improvement criterion, for which an analytic expansion relying on Tallis' formula was recently established. The computational burden of this selection rule being still an issue in application, we derive a closed-form expression for the gradient of the multipoint Expected Improvement, which aims at facilitating its maximization using gradient-based ascent algorithms. Substantial computational savings are shown in application. In addition, our algorithms are tested numerically and compared to state-of-the-art UCB-based batch-sequential algorithms. Combining starting designs relying on UCB with gradient-based EI local optimization finally appears as a sound option for batch design in distributed Gaussian Process optimization...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MscAgric (Animal Sciences)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a product using {{alternative}} red meat species, aquatic and terrestrial mammals, which would be acceptable to the consumer and suitable from a food safety aspect. Many of these alternative species are harvested seasonally. A product which is shelf stable needs to be developed to provide a supply of this meat all year round. The species used in this investigation were the Cape fur seal (Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus), the Grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) from the northern hemisphere, the Minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), horse, beef, mutton, blesbok (Damaliscus dorcas phillipsi) and springbok (Antidorcas marsupialis). Muscle (m. pectoralis) of Cape fur seal pups has a higher percentage fat (4. 2 g/ 100 g) than the bulls (2. 4 g/ 100 g), but similar levels of protein (23. 2 g/ 100 g). Bull blubber samples have a higher percentage protein (26. 6 g/ 100 g) than the pups (14. 6 g/ 100 g), but a lower fat percentage (67. 1 g/ 100 g) compared with the pups (77. 2 g/ 100 g). In the Cape fur seal bull meat, saturated fatty acids (SFA) contribute 33 mg/ 100 g, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) 29 mg/ 100 g and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) 38 mg/ 100 g of the total fatty acid content. In pups, the three fractions are 39, 30 and 31 mg/ 100 g for SFA, MUFA and PUFA, respectively. Salami,prepared using exclusively seal meat, or seal meat with beef and pork, was produced in a pilot study, using two commercially available starter cultures. The pH values of all three <b>batches</b> started <b>off</b> at ca. 5. 6, and dropped to 4. 3. Water activity readings started off at 0. 96 and dropped to 0. 91 after 21 days. Salami produced from the meat of the Grey (Havert) seal and Minke whale, using three starter cultures, had recorded pH values (in both species), which started off between 5. 68 and 5. 92, and dropped to between 4. 5 and 4. 8 over the 21 days. Water activity showed an initial value of 0. 96, which dropped to 0. 90 after 21 days. The final force (N/cm 2) that was needed to compress the salami samples was double that of the initial force required for the same species and starter culture combination. The raw seal meat contained 349. 6 (mg/ 100 g sample) SFA, 271. 6 (mg/ 100 g sample) MUFA and 175. 8 (mg/ 100 g sample) PUFA, whilst the raw whale meat contained 312. 3, 251. 9 and 179. 6 (mg/ 100 g sample) SFA, MUFA and PUFA respectively. Fifteen batches of salami were made from horse, beef, mutton, blesbok and springbok, respectively, and starter cultures of Lactobacillus curvatus DF 38 (batch I), active bacteriocin producing Lactobacillus plantarum 423 (batch II) and then a mutant variation of Lactobacillus plantarum 423 m, which did not produce the bacteriocin (batch III). Batch I had a higher final pH value (4. 66), after 23 days, whereas the values for batches II and III were similar (4. 42 and 4. 46 respectively). On day 23 the water activity value was 0. 90 for all starter cultures. Horse salami, in batch I, was the leanest in terms of fat content (34. 34 g/ 100 g salami), with mutton salami having the highest fat content (37. 52 g/ 100 g salami). Blesbok salami had the highest fat content in batch II (42. 77 g/ 100 g meat), with beef the leanest (35. 71 g/ 100 g meat). Salami made from horse and springbok proved to be the most desirable in terms of chemical composition, especially fatty acid profiles, with regard to P: S and n- 6 : n- 3 ratios. Similar growth patterns in colony forming units (cfu) were recorded for L. plantarum 423, L. plantarum 423 m and L. curvatus DF 38 in MRS broth (Merck) at 30 oC, although batch I reached asymptotic growth earlier. The percentage of L. plantarum 423 compared with the total population of microflora in mutton salami remained almost the same (80 - 95 % variety) during the entire fermentation and maturation process. In horse salami, L. plantarum 423 was present at relatively low cell numbers (55 - 50 % on day 1 and before smoking), but increased to 70 % after smoking and stabilized to 70 - 80 % for the remaining fermentation period. In beef salami, cell numbers in batch II decreased slightly during the first five days (from 95 to 70 %), followed by an increase to 90 %. In springbok salami, cell numbers in batch II remained fairly stable at 80 - 90 %. In blesbok salami, batch II slowly decreased during the first three days, from 88 % to 70 %, then increased to 92 % after 12 days and stabilized for the rest of the fermentation period. Similar results were recorded for batch I. Analytical sensory evaluation concluded that the salami prepared using starter culture I resulted in end products with lower sensory qualities. Salami prepared using blesbok and mutton also resulted in end products with lower sensory qualities and was perceived as significantly lower in salami flavour (P≤ 0. 05) and higher in venison-like and mutton-like flavour respectively. The blesbok samples were rated significantly higher (P≤ 0. 05) in sour meat aroma, sour meat flavour and venison-like flavour than the rest of the samples. The blesbok salami was rated significantly lowest for colour compared with the rest of the samples. The tastes of the springbok and horse salami were significantly (P≤ 0. 05) more acceptable than those of the beef and blesbok salami...|$|R
