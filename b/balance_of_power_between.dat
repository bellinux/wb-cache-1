5|$|Historian Wilson D. Miscamble {{argues that}} Kennan played a {{critical}} role in developing the foreign policies of the Truman administration. He also states that Kennan did not believe in either global or strongpoint containment; he simply wanted to restore the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>between</b> the United States and the Soviets. Like historian John Lewis Gaddis, Miscamble concedes that although Kennan personally preferred political containment, his recommendations ultimately resulted in a policy directed more toward strongpoint than to global containment.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, John {{undertook}} {{an expedition}} to Ireland in 1185, which was not a success. Ireland had only recently been conquered by Anglo-Norman forces, and tensions were still rife between Henry's representatives, the new settlers and the existing inhabitants. John offended the local Irish rulers, failed to make allies amongst the Anglo-Norman settlers, began to lose ground militarily against the Irish, and finally returned to England within the year. In 1186 Henry was about to return John to Ireland once again, when news came that Geoffrey {{had died in a}} tournament at Paris, leaving two young children; this event once again changed the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>between</b> Henry and his remaining sons.|$|E
5|$|The {{road to the}} Teutonic capital Marienburg now lay open, {{the city}} undefended; but for reasons the sources do not explain, Władysław hesitated to pursue his advantage. On 17 July, his army began a laboured advance, {{arriving}} at Marienburg only on 25 July, by which time the new Grand Master, Heinrich von Plauen, had organised a defence of the fortress. The apparent half-heartedness of the ensuing siege, called off by Władysław on 19 September, has been ascribed variously to the impregnability of the fortifications, to high casualty figures among the Lithuanians, to Władysław's unwillingness to risk further casualties, or to his desire to keep the Order weakened but undefeated as to not upset the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>between</b> Poland (which would most likely acquire most of the Order possessions if it was totally defeated) and Lithuania; but a lack of sources precludes a definitive explanation.|$|E

5|$|Diplomatic efforts {{between the}} Netherlands and the Republic {{continued}} throughout 1948 and 1949. Political pressures, {{both domestic and}} international, hindered Dutch attempts to decide upon objectives. Similarly, Republican leaders faced great difficulty in persuading their people to accept diplomatic concessions. By July 1948 negotiations were in deadlock and the Netherlands pushed unilaterally towards Van Mook’s federal Indonesia concept. The new federal states of South Sumatra and East Java were created, although neither had a viable support base. The Netherlands set up the Bijeenkomst voor Federaal Overleg (BFO) (or Federal Consultative Assembly), a body comprising {{the leadership of the}} federal states, and charged with the formation of a United States of Indonesia and an interim government by the end of 1948. The Dutch plans, however, had no place for the Republic unless it accepted a minor role already defined for it. Later plans included Java and Sumatra but dropped all mention of the Republic. The main sticking point in the negotiations was the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>between</b> the Netherlands High Representative and the Republican forces.|$|E

50|$|The Committee {{released}} its report {{at the next}} {{annual meeting of the}} CBA at Halifax in 1978. The Committee made wide-ranging recommendations for constitutional change, including a completely new constitution, abolishing the monarchy, changing the Senate, entrenching language rights and a bill of rights, and changing the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> <b>between</b> {{the federal government and the}} provinces.|$|R
50|$|All of Thailand's {{charters}} and constitutions {{have recognized}} a unified kingdom with a constitutional monarchy, but with widely differing <b>balances</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>between</b> the branches <b>of</b> government. Most Thai governments have stipulated parliamentary systems. Several, however, {{also called for}} dictatorships, e.g., the 1959 constitution. Both unicameral and bicameral parliaments have been used, and members of parliament have been both elected and appointed. The direct <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> the monarch have also varied considerably.|$|R
25|$|McCulloch v. Maryland (1819) was one {{of several}} {{decisions}} during the 1810s and 1820s involving the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>between</b> {{the federal government and the}} states where Marshall affirmed federal supremacy. He established in McCulloch that states could not tax federal institutions, and upheld congressional authority to create the Second Bank of the United States, even though the authority to do this was not expressly stated in the Constitution.|$|E
25|$|The Court's {{power and}} {{prestige}} grew substantially during the Marshall Court (1801–35). Under Marshall, the Court established {{the power of}} judicial review over acts of Congress, including specifying itself as the supreme expositor of the Constitution (Marbury v. Madison) and made several important constitutional rulings giving shape and substance to the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>between</b> {{the federal government and}} the states (prominently, Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, McCulloch v. Maryland and Gibbons v. Ogden).|$|E
25|$|Many Americans {{thought the}} United States had been cheated out of Texas. American land speculators {{believed}} {{they could make}} fortunes in the vast region of Texas, and American politicians believed Texas could help maintain a <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>between</b> free and slave states. In 1827, American president John Quincy Adams offered US$1 million for Texas. Mexican president Guadalupe Victoria refused. Two years later, Andrew Jackson increased the United States' offer to $5 million; President Vicente Guerrero again declined to sell.|$|E

Before Amtsakhara, the only notable opposition group had been the Aitaira movement. Amtsakhara managed {{to take over the}} leadership of the opposition, empowered by its core of veterans. In the years leading up to 2004, Amtsakhara lobbied for reform of the government, including a greater <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> <b>between</b> the branches <b>of</b> government, and in particular, an increase in the <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> Abkhazian lawmakers. They were also successful in changing the procedure for amending the Constitution.|$|R
25|$|Khalilzad {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{high-level}} Administration officials to warn that sectarian violence was overtaking the insurgency as the number one threat to Iraq's stability. After the Al Askari shrine bombing, in February 2006, he warned that spreading sectarian violence might lead to civil war – and possibly even a broader conflict involving neighboring countries. Khalilzad sought political solutions to the problem of sectarianism, in particular working to integrate the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>between</b> Iraq's three main ethnic groups in order to head off growing Sunni violence.|$|E
25|$|The <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>between</b> {{the various}} Mexican cartels {{continually}} shifts as new organizations emerge and older ones weaken and collapse. A disruption in the system, {{such as the}} arrests or deaths of cartel leaders, generates bloodshed as rivals move in to exploit the power vacuum. Leadership vacuums are sometimes created by law enforcement successes against a particular cartel, so cartels often will attempt to use law enforcement against one another, either by bribing Mexican officials {{to take action against}} a rival or by leaking intelligence about a rival's operations to the Mexican government or the US Drug Enforcement Administration.|$|E
25|$|The first {{action of}} the new {{government}} was the nationalisation of the large majority of private property in Hungary. Despite advice from Lenin and the Bolsheviks, Béla Kun's government chose not to redistribute land to the peasantry, which reduced the majority of their support in Hungary. Instead, all land was to be converted into collective farms and former estate owners, managers and bailiffs were to be retained as the new collective farm managers. This resulted in the dissolution of the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>between</b> the old elite and the peasantry which made up the majority of Kun's support.|$|E

The efficiency of the global supply chain governance cannot be commented on as a whole, each corporation will instate their own governance strategy. That being said there is a basic theoretical understanding that supports the merits of having a governance strategy in place and encourages actors to take part in one.|$|R

40|$|Reform {{proposals}} {{with regard}} to the judiciary tend to focus on improving its internal functioning and often overlook the distribution <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> <b>between</b> the centralized and decentralized government level. Nevertheless, an inefficient distribution <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> may cause conflicts of jurisdiction, judicial backlog, and legal uncertainty. As a result, the constitutional distribution <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> {{plays an important role in}} federal countries. In addition to satisfying the demands of the litigants, there is usually an ongoing quest for finding an acceptable <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> <b>between</b> the federal and state level.

25|$|The hung {{parliament}} of 1885 saw him {{hold the}} <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>between</b> William Gladstone's Liberals and Lord Salisbury's Conservatives. His power was one factor in Gladstone's adoption of Home Rule {{as the central}} tenet of the Liberal Party. His reputation peaked in 1889–90 when letters published in The Times linking him to the Phoenix Park Killings of 1882 were shown to have been forged by Richard Pigott. However, the Irish Parliamentary Party split in 1890 after the revelation of Parnell's long adulterous love affair, causing many English Liberals (many of them nonconformists) to refuse to work with him, and strong opposition from Catholic bishops. He headed a small minority faction {{until his death in}} 1891.|$|E
25|$|The {{position}} of herald in England was well defined, {{and so on}} January 5, 1420, William Bruges was appointed by King Henry V to be Garter King of Arms. No such position had been created in other countries. A succession of different titles was introduced {{over the next four}} centuries for principal governor of arms, including King of Arms. Some were members of the College of Arms, some were not. Other holders of positions included the Falcon King of Arms, a position created under King Edward III. Other positions were created for important counties, such as the Lancastrian King of Arms, but the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>between</b> them and those charged with larger regions remains unclear.|$|E
25|$|Southern slave holding {{interests}} now {{faced the}} prospects of a Republican President and the entry of new free states that would alter the nation's <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>between</b> the sections. To many Southerners, the resounding defeat of the Lecompton Constitution foreshadowed the entry of more free states into the Union. Dating back to the Missouri Compromise, the Southern region desperately sought to maintain an equal balance of slave states and free states {{so as to be}} competitive in the Senate. Since the last slave state was admitted in 1845, five more free states had entered. The tradition of maintaining a balance between North and South was abandoned in favor of the addition of more free soil states.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the implications of CJEU internal market case law for the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> <b>between</b> the EU institutions.

This book examines how the organisation of commodity markets contributed to this remarkable development. Comparing Holland to England and Flanders, the book shows that Holland’s specific history of reclamation and settlement had given rise to a favourable <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> <b>between</b> state, nobility, towns and rural communities that reduced opportunities for rent-seeking and favoured the rise of efficient markets.

Globalization has increased the number of transnational problems (protection of human environment, international traffic and communications, flows of capital, energy, migrations, etc.) that require global governance.

25|$|After World War II, the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>between</b> the Eastern and Western blocs and {{the fear}} of global {{destruction}} prevented the further military use of atomic bombs. This fear was even a central part of Cold War strategy, referred to as the doctrine of Mutually Assured Destruction. So important was this balance to international political stability that a treaty, the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (or ABM treaty), was signed by the U.S. and the USSR in 1972 to curtail the development of defenses against nuclear weapons and the ballistic missiles that carry them. This doctrine resulted in a large {{increase in the number of}} nuclear weapons, as each side sought to ensure it possessed the firepower to destroy the opposition in all possible scenarios.|$|E
25|$|The {{beginning}} of his reign was marked by the Danish defeat in the Second Schleswig War and the subsequent loss of the duchies of Schleswig, Holstein and Lauenburg which made the king immensely unpopular. The following years of his reign were dominated by political disputes as Denmark had only become a constitutional monarchy in 1849 and the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>between</b> the sovereign and parliament was still in dispute. In spite of his initial unpopularity and the many years of political strife, where the king was in conflict with {{large parts of the}} population, his popularity recovered towards the end of his reign, and he became a national icon due to the length of his reign and the high standards of personal morality with which he was identified.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} of Ferdinand III's death in 1634, the war was {{progressing}} disastrously for the Habsburgs, and his son Ferdinand IV (1637–1657) who {{had been one of}} his military commanders was faced with the task of salvaging the consequences of his father's extremism. Ferdinand IV was far more pragmatic and had been considered the leader of the peace party at court and had helped negotiate the Peace of Prague in 1635. However, with continuing losses in the war he was forced to make peace in 1648 with the Peace of Westphalia, concluding the war. One of his acts during {{the latter part of the}} war was to give further independence to the German states (ius belli ac pacis—rights in time of war and peace) which would gradually change the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>between</b> emperor and states in favour of the latter.|$|E
