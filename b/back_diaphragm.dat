30|$|In normal {{individuals}} 10 cm H 2 O of CPAP induces acute overdistention. This overdistension activates {{the accessory}} respiratory muscles {{and increases the}} work of breathing. The increased inspiratory scalene muscle activity during CPAP explains the increased RC contribution to tidal volume, whereas the expiratory transversus abdominis recruitment probably defends the lung from overinflation by pulling <b>back</b> the <b>diaphragm</b> towards the initial FRC position. We can assume that in patients with acute respiratory failure not tolerating various levels of CPAP, CPAP induces over-distension and increases the work of breathing.|$|R

50|$|The {{advantages}} of the design were its ease of transportation and use, it did not impede orthopaedic and nursing care, and could prevent lung collapse in some cases. Disadvantages were that inhalation depended upon elastic recoil of the chest and upon gravity pulling the <b>diaphragm</b> <b>back</b> down, and so breathing could be shallow and the patient could not lie down; attention was required in its use, and the action gave the patient more discomfort compared with cabinet (iron lung) respirators.|$|R

Anatomically, the core can be described as a muscular box with the abdominals in the front, paraspinals and glutes in the <b>back,</b> the <b>diaphragm</b> as the roof, and the pelvic floor and hip girdle musculature as the bottom [1]. Functionally, the core can be thought of as the kinetic link that facilitates the transfer of torques and angular momentum between the lower and upper extremities that is of vital importance for sport-specific and everyday activities in different age groups [2]. In fact, data from a cross-sectional study indicate significant relationships between variables of core muscle strength, sprint, throw, and jump performance in young health...|$|R
50|$|The {{carburetor}} typically {{contains a}} float bowl {{into which the}} expelled fuel is pumped. When the fuel level in the float bowl exceeds a certain level, the inlet valve to the carburetor will close, preventing the fuel pump from pumping more fuel into the carburetor. At this point, any remaining fuel inside the pump chamber is trapped, unable to exit through the inlet port or outlet port. The diaphragm will continue to allow pressure to the diaphragm, and during the subsequent rotation, the eccentric will pull the <b>diaphragm</b> <b>back</b> to bottom dead center, where it will remain until the inlet valve to the carburetor reopens.|$|R
5000|$|One key {{advantage}} of transmission lines is {{their ability to}} conduct the back wave behind the transducer more effectively away from it - reducing the chance for reflected energy permeating <b>back</b> through the <b>diaphragm</b> out of phase with the primary signal. Not all transmission lines designs do this effectively. Most offset transmission line speakers place a reflective wall fairly close behind the transducer within the enclosure - posing a problem for internal reflections emanating back through the transducer diaphragm. Older descriptions explained the design in terms of [...] "impedance mismatch", or pressure waves [...] "reflected" [...] back into the enclosure; these descriptions are now considered outdated and inaccurate as technically the transmission line works through selective production of standing waves and constructive and destructive interference (see below).|$|R
40|$|There are {{a variety}} of needs in room acoustics, such as the control of {{ventilation}} noise, adjustment of reverberation time and selective enhancement of echos over some frequency bands. All these call for a tunable sound absorber. This work describes an electro-acoustic method to design such an absorber, which is here described as an acoustic filter. The absorber consists of a moving-coil loudspeaker <b>diaphragm</b> <b>backed</b> by a cavity. When incident noise pushes the diaphragm, it moves and its structural damping consumes some sound energy. An RLC shunt circuit is attached to the moving coil giving an electrically induced mechanical impedance that alters the acoustic behaviour of the shunted loudspeaker. By manipulating component values of the shunt RLC circuit, the absorber drains noise at flexibly chosen frequency bands and at any assigned absorption levels, much like designing an electronic filter. The essential part of the theory is validated by experiment. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
5000|$|The {{development}} is a special case of the differential microphone topology most commonly used to achieve directionality. All such microphones {{have at least two}} ports through which sound enters; a front port normally oriented toward the desired sound and another port that's more distant. The microphone's diaphragm is placed between the two ports; sound arriving from an ambient sound field reaches both ports more or less equally. Sound that's much closer to the front port than to the rear will make more of a pressure gradient between the front and <b>back</b> of the <b>diaphragm,</b> causing it to move more. The microphone's proximity effect is adjusted so that flat frequency response is achieved for sound sources very close {{to the front of the}} mic [...] - [...] typically 1 to 3 cm. Sounds arriving from other angles are subject to steep midrange and bass rolloff. Commercially and militarily useful noise-canceling microphones have been made since at least 1935, Amelia Earhart used one on her 1935 flight from Hawaii to California [...] and have been made since the 1940s by Roanwell, Electro-Voice and others.|$|R
40|$|Pre-stressed tie <b>back</b> {{anchored}} <b>diaphragm</b> {{walls are}} {{considered one of}} the safest lateral supports which help in overall stability when there is a significant difference in land level between back and front of these walls. Permanent lateral supports to these walls are frequently represented by supporting it laterally with foundation and floor slabs of the building. In this paper a special study of one raw anchor diaphragm wall subjected to different earthquake dynamic loads will be presented. The wall retains an excavation of 9. 5  m and supports laterally a near-by 5 floor building. Five historical strong motions with different fundamental frequencies are subjected on the wall. The wall displacement, straining actions, anchor extreme force and the influence of variation of anchor stiffness are calculated using a dynamic Plaxis finite element program. The soil is considered as elasto-plastic material and represented using Mohr–Coulomb criteria, the wall and the anchor are considered to behave elastically. Prescribed displacement at the lower bottom boundary represents the earthquake motion. Far left and right absorbent boundaries are assumed to prevent dynamic wave reflection. Four static phases representing construction procedure and one dynamic loading phase are considered. It is found that the straining actions of different historical earthquakes match in shape with each other, the only change is in the amplitude which is affected by earthquake fundamental frequency and its intensity. The maximum dynamic lateral displacement of the wall is at its free top. The near-by building shows a differential settlement towards the wall which causes a change in the sign and amplitude of the straining actions. Increasing the stiffness of anchor was also studied and it was found that it reduces too much the maximum dynamic top wall lateral displacement...|$|R
50|$|For the pictured Petri 7 1.8 {{the company}} offered a kit that {{included}} a front adapter lens marked AUX TELEPHOTO which screws onto the primary lens; a similar lens for WIDE ANGLE is in the kit. The kit includes an optical view finder, TELE-WIDE FINDER, which attaches on the flash shoe and contains two optically marked frames showing telephoto and wide angle. This kit works on the Petri 7 1.9 and the Petri 7 1.8 camera. The single primary lens diaphragm works with these adapted lens mounted on the front, a lower cost design than lenses that include all the <b>back</b> glass and <b>diaphragm</b> with each lens. The camera with primary lens is 13 cm wide, 8 cm tall and 7 cm deep, All these lens have 3.5 cm screw rings. Metering {{is powered by a}} ring photocell so no battery is required. Focus is manual on primary lens/viewfinder so the photographer must match the yellow/tinted image with the clear one in the primary viewfinder, then shift the eye to the auxiliary viewfinder to frame the picture when an auxiliary lens is used. 1.8 Camera weighs 710 grams (1 lb 9 oz).|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a new single-chip MEMS {{capacitor}} microphone on a silicon wafer by minimizing {{the size and}} the reduction of mechanical strength using a circular diaphragm with a fixed center is proposed. In the proposed microphone, the diaphragm includes a number of holes to pass the air through {{the gap between the}} <b>back</b> plate and <b>diaphragm,</b> and thus reduces the damping of the sound from the microphone. Novelty of this method, creating a circular microphone with fixed center, which the diameter of diaphragm is less than the conventional condenser microphone. At first, the mechanical analysis was conducted on microphone diaphragm in order to achieve the pull-in voltage. The pull-in voltage of the proposed circular microphone is 14 volts. According to the obtained pull-in voltage, the bias voltage were applied to the microphone, and various parameters such as capacitance and sensitivity were measured. Based on the simulation results of COMSOL, the proposed microphone with diaphragm diameter of 400 μm and a thickness of 1. 5 μm, the sensitivity of - 23 dB is shown. In comparison with previous works, the proposed microphone with lower supply voltage is provided the better frequency performance, and higher sensitivity, in order to sense the sound...|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} practical recording technologies {{were entirely}} mechanical devices. These recorders typically used a large conical horn {{to collect and}} focus the physical air pressure of the sound waves produced by the human voice or musical instruments. A sensitive membrane or diaphragm, located {{at the apex of}} the cone, was connected to an articulated scriber or stylus, and as the changing air pressure moved the <b>diaphragm</b> <b>back</b> and forth, the stylus scratched or incised an analogue of the sound waves onto a moving recording medium, such as a roll of coated paper, or a cylinder or disc coated with a soft material such as wax or a soft metal. These early recordings were necessarily of low fidelity and volume, and captured only a narrow segment of the audible sound spectrum — typically only from around 250 Hz up to about 2,500 Hz — so musicians and engineers were forced to adapt to these sonic limitations. Bands of the period often favored louder instruments such as trumpet, cornet and trombone, lower-register brass instruments (such as the tuba and the euphonium) replaced the string bass, and blocks of wood stood in for bass drums; performers also had to arrange themselves strategically around the horn to balance the sound, and to play as loudly as possible. The reproduction of domestic phonographs was similarly limited in both frequency-range and volume — this period gave rise to the expression [...] "put a sock in it", which commemorates the common practice of placing a sock in the horn of the phonograph to muffle the sound for quieter listening. By the end of the acoustic era, the disc had become the standard medium for sound recording, and its dominance in the domestic audio market lasted {{until the end of the}} 20th century.|$|R
40|$|Effect of Groundwater on Stability of Excavation Abstract This paper {{presents}} {{the effects of}} groundwater on the stability of excavation in the two supporting methods on the diaphragm wall. One of the supporting methods is braced cut, {{and the other is}} with tie-back wall. The analysis of each method through the computer software PLAXIS 2 D show the Soil Structure Interaction behavior and their stabilities in different groundwater level during excavation, and the stress and deformation on the diaphragm wall will be obtained and discussed. Meanwhile the result of the maximum settlement of the ground at the <b>back</b> of the <b>diaphragm</b> wall will be analyzed, too. The analytical format of structure's safety exhibited that the user defined soil models incorporated in PLAXIS 2 D by this study were included. And the results show that the deformations of the braced wall at 8. 6 m depth vertical cut are in the range of 0. 016 to 0. 031 m. However, in the same conditions, the tie-backed supporting wall displaced to 0. 015 to 0. 116 m under the influence of adopted models and groundwater. As a result of this much deformed wall, both the performance of the entire structure and the soil-structure interaction are subject to further study, if it is utilized as foundation parts of superstructure. In addition, reviewing stability for excavation will be conducted on the basis of government regulations. 本文主要在探討開挖工程過程中，地下連續壁兩種擋土支撐工法，其受地下水影響穩定行為之研究。工法之一為水平內支撐開挖，另一為背拉式錨定工法。各工法分別以不同地下水位之情況為案例，分析土壤與結構體互制行為與穩定性，以及連續壁應力與變位情形，並對擋土壁後面因開挖而產生之地表沈陷予以評估。 結構安全分析係借助PLAXIS 2 D電腦程式，分別模擬二度空間之二種支撐工法予以分析。結果顯示連續壁內支撐之開挖(深 8. 6 m) ，於不同地下水位之連續壁側向變位量在 0. 016 至 0. 031 m之間；然而相同條件下，背拉式工法之連續壁側向變位量卻在 0. 015 至 0. 116 m之間。明顯與錨定模式以及地下水之高低有重大的關係。以該連續壁作為上部結構基礎之一部分時，整體結構性能與土壤互制效應頇另作探討。此外本文也以政府部門有關之穩定分析規則，檢核地下水對開挖之穩定性。目 錄 中文摘要 [...] . i 英文摘要 [...] ii 目 錄 [...] . iii 表 目 錄 [...] . vi 圖 目 錄 [...] . vii 符號說明 [...] . ix 第一章 緒論 [...] . 1 1. 1 研究背景 [...] . 1 1. 2 研究目的與方法 [...] 1 第二章 文獻回顧 [...] . 2 2. 1 地下水對地盤的影響 [...] 2 2. 1. 1 地下水位 [...] . 2 2. 1. 2 地下水在地盤內滲流的影響,,.,, [...] 3 2. 1. 3 孔隙水壓升降之影響 [...] . 3 2. 1. 4 水壓變化可能影響穩定之項目 [...] . 4 2. 1. 5 施工抽水對地盤沈陷影響之範圍 [...] . 5 2. 2 地下水位控制 [...] . 6 2. 3 開挖穩定分析 [...] . 7 2. 3. 1 Plaxis 2 D電腦程式 [...] . 7 2. 3. 2 規範規定之穩定分析項目 [...] 10 iv 2. 3. 3 開挖擋土設計流程簡介 [...] 15 2. 4 地表沈陷估計 [...] 16 2. 5 連續壁側向變位之經驗式 [...] 18 第三章 地下水與穩定性分析 [...] 21 3. 1 地下水與土壤有效應力 [...] . 21 3. 1. 1 降水使土壤有效應力增加 [...] . 21 3. 1. 2 地下水位升降之量測 [...] . 21 3. 2 擋土支撐側向壓力與變形 [...] . 22 3. 2. 1 擋土牆的主要側向壓力 [...] 22 3. 2. 2 影響擋土牆變形之主要因素 [...] . 23 3. 3 分析案例內容說明 [...] . 23 3. 4 開挖穩定性分析 [...] 26 3. 4. 1 貫入深度檢核 [...] 26 3. 4. 2 上舉(uplift) 穩定分析 [...] . 28 3. 4. 3 塑性隆(heaving) 分析 [...] . 28 3. 4. 4 砂湧(boiling) 安全分析 [...] . 29 第四章 Plaxis研究案例分析 [...] . 30 4. 1 研究案例 [...] 30 4. 2 分析案例 1 ~ 3 [...] . 30 4. 2. 1 工程施作內容 [...] 30 4. 2. 2 案例 1 ~ 3 分析結果之檢討 [...] . 37 4. 3 分析案例 4 ~ 6 [...] . 43 4. 3. 1 工程施作內容 [...] . 43 4. 3. 2 案例 4 ~ 6 分析結果之探討 [...] . 47 第五章 分析結果、討論與因應對策之建議 [...] 54 5. 1 案例分析結果 [...] . 54 5. 1. 1 高地下水位之穩定分析 [...] . 55 5. 1. 2 各開挖支撐工法之應力與變形量 [...] 56 5. 2 基地開挖造成周邊地表沈陷量之估計 [...] 60 5. 3 地下水處理對策 [...] 61 5. 4 綜合討論 [...] . 62 第六章 結 論 與 建 議 [...] 67 6. 1 結論 [...] 67 6. 2 建議 [...] 69 參 考 文 獻 [...] 7...|$|R
