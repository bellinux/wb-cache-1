500|$|Blane {{was amazed}} by the {{recreation}} and understanding of her designs by fans. When she first heard that people were dressing up, {{she thought it would}} be tacky, but was surprised to see the depth to which the fans went to recreate her designs. Rocky Horror fan Mina Credeur, who designs costumes and performed as Columbia for Houston’s performance group, states that [...] "the <b>best</b> <b>part</b> <b>is</b> when everyone leaves with a big smile on their face", noting that there's [...] "such a kitschiness and campiness that it seems to be winking at you". The film still plays at many theatre locations and Rocky Horror costumes are often made for Halloween, although many require much time and effort to make.|$|E
500|$|Tyler Foster of DVD Talk wrote {{highly of}} the episode, and {{highlighted}} it as a stand-out {{of the second}} season. He applauded {{the way in which}} the series reinvented the idea of the Underworld, noting that its presentation was [...] "hilarious in and of itself". In addition, he was complimentary towards Ferrer's performance as Death; in a review of the Fionna and Cake DVD, Foster referred to the actor's work as [...] "hilarious" [...] in the episode, and in a review of the second season, he wrote that [...] "if 'Miguel Ferrer as Death' isn't a perfect four-word tease pitch for the show's genius, I don't know what is." [...] Matt Fowler of IGN cited the episode as a season highlight, writing that the episode's <b>best</b> <b>part</b> <b>is</b> when [...] "Finn has a 'death metal-off' with Death". He also noted that the episode is important to the series as a whole, as it is one of the many second season entries that marks a [...] "darkening effect" [...] upon the series; he specifically cited the scene wherein Peppermint Butler demands Finn and Jake's flesh as payment.|$|E
500|$|... "Helping Hand" [...] {{received}} overwhelming positive reviews. Of the episode, Christine Orlando of TV Fanatic said, [...] "As I'm {{realizing how}} much I'm thoroughly enjoying the characters on Body of Proof, [...] "Helping Hand" [...] has Megan finally noticing how little she knows about them. The <b>best</b> <b>part</b> <b>is,</b> she does something {{to try and}} change that {{and the results are}} both comical and touching". Orlando praised the scenes between Megan and Curtis, calling them [...] "great" [...] and saying, [...] "Nothing makes you a part of the team like falling for a well-meaning office prank". On the Megan and Bud scenes she said that Megan was [...] "sweet" [...] and [...] "funny" [...] but called her attempts at consoling Bud [...] "clumsy", adding; [...] "Neither completely trusts the other but their growing professional respect has the potential to also become a personal friendship". On this, she said that Bud had some of the best lines in the episode, calling them [...] "the best". She hoped that Peter and Megan's relationship will be explored further and wanted to know [...] "just how these two became partners". Finally, she was glad it was not too [...] "gory" [...] and summarized, [...] "On Body of Proof I'm more interested in the characters than the graphic medical details. Thankfully they continue to give me plenty of what I want". TV OverMind Carissa Pavlica said she was [...] "really enjoying" [...] the relationship between Kate Murphy (Jeri Ryan) and Megan. Pavlica explained, [...] "In the Pilot, the other medical examiners seemed to hope they could somehow get rid of Megan by tattling on things to Kate. This week, as she saw Megan struggle in her connection with the living, she attempted to reach out and give advice". Of the plot of the episode, Pavlica said; ...|$|E
50|$|His {{success was}} immediate. Among his <b>best</b> <b>parts</b> <b>were</b> Herod the Great in Mariamne, Nero in Britannicus and similar tragic roles, {{in spite of}} the fact that he was short, stout, and lacking in good looks.|$|R

5000|$|Appiah {{says her}} <b>best</b> <b>part</b> <b>was</b> in Mummy’s Daughter by Venus Films. The film {{tells the story}} of the Bartels Family where she played the role of Princess, the daughter. [...] "I loved how I acted and I was happy with the role I played". Appiah now sees the local film {{industry}} as having changed for the better. She thinks that others will see its ultimate success.|$|R
500|$|Critical {{reception}} for Voliminal was mixed. The newspaper Dawn called the DVD [...] "an audible treat for thrash and speed metal fans", {{he went on}} to compliment drummer Joey Jordison, stating that he [...] "structures his beats and percussions in a very traditional thrash set-up, almost as well as (dare I say it) the great Dave Lombardo of Slayer fame". Ultimate Guitar called the DVD [...] "behind-the-scene action in an unorthodox format, complete with choppy editing and absolutely no specific chronology". They would go on to state though the DVD [...] "only gives partial attention to the music", [...] "The best moment in the 2-disc collection comes during a chat with Corey Taylor, who shares his feelings about everything from his less-than-perfect relationship with his father to the obstacles that the band faced in its early days". TuneLab wrote [...] "Slipknot takes a unique approach to their latest film, as they turn {{what could have been a}} mundane video of live footage and band antics into a rather peculiar and extremely interesting movie". The [...] "scatterbrained and choppy" [...] style of Voliminal [...] " [...] the viewer to feel like he or she is [...] "outside looking in", rather than being truly involved with the band's happenings". Reviewing for Blogcritics, Chris Beaumont wrote [...] " [...] was enthralled and bored by the documentary". He went on to state, [...] "the <b>best</b> <b>part</b> <b>is</b> watching them perform", despite the [...] "audio is near unlistenable"; [...] "these guys know their way around the stage...this shows the whole package". Reviewing for Billboard, Christa Titus criticized the DVD writing it [...] "randomly [...] footage from concerts and the usual backstage antics with images of pigeons and overflowing toilets, then tossing in whatever visual effects struck M. Shawn Crahan's fancy while he edited it." [...] She concluded [...] "Save your cash for the band's next tour...that's where you'll get your money's worth". Film School Rejects's Cole Abaius wrote of the DVD, [...] ", probably no one else will purchase or enjoy this DVD". He added that with no narration, [...] "the images are left to speak for themselves", only [...] "some just don’t speak loudly enough". Despite the mixed reviews, Voliminal was certified gold in Australia, platinum in the United States, and double platinum in Canada. The album peaked at the 5th spot on Billboards Music Video charts, and remained on the chart for 10 weeks.|$|E
2500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Milkshake" [...] was {{directed}} by Jake Nava. In the video, Kelis enters a diner called Tasty's Yard. She dances suggestively, and puts her lips around a cherry, which causes a mother to cover her child's eyes. A cook, played by rapper Nas, starts delivering milkshakes to the customers while Kelis dances. A milkshake machine then starts spurting milkshake all over the customers, {{and more and more}} people enter the [...] "yard". FHM named the music video the 73rd sexiest music video by a female performer of all time and commented: [...] "Here she's backed up by a posse of dancers wearing tiny diner uniforms. The way she sucks a milkshake and bites a cherry is just unfairly sexy", and said that the <b>best</b> <b>part</b> <b>is</b> when Kelis demonstrates a [...] "perfect bending-over-oven technique".|$|E
2500|$|Sen Sharma next {{starred in}} Zoya Akhtar's Luck by Chance, {{opposite}} Farhan Akhtar. Upon release, the film met with highly positive reviews from critics, as did her performance, but its financial income was modest. Sen Sharma's latest 2009 release was Ayan Mukerjee's romantic comedy Wake Up Sid {{in which she}} starred alongside Ranbir Kapoor. Upon release, the film received universally positive reviews, and her performance received rave reviews. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama wrote, [...] "Konkona is natural to the core and the <b>best</b> <b>part</b> <b>is,</b> she's so effortless. Here's another winning performance from this incredible performer." [...] The New York Times wrote, [...] "Ms. Sharma has made a specialty of characters like Aisha: independent urban women, whose dreams involve careers as well as love. Her Aisha is a nuanced creation— ambitious, sympathetic, believable— and Mr. Mukerji, making his directing debut, is right to let her run away with the film." ...|$|E
5000|$|Francis Aickin first {{appeared}} in London in 1765 as Dick Amlet in John Vanbrugh's The Confederacy at Drury Lane. He acted there, and at Covent Garden, until 1792. His repertory consisted of over eighty characters, and among his <b>best</b> <b>parts</b> <b>were</b> the Ghost in Hamlet and Jaques in As You Like It. His success in impassioned declamatory roles obtained for him the nickname of [...] "Tyrant".|$|R
60|$|It {{was quite}} a {{pleasant}} party, and while we were writing, we had a bird's-eye view of the public reception of the Chief Justice. The <b>best</b> <b>part</b> of it <b>were</b> some natives in war array; with blacked faces, turbans, tapa kilts, and guns, they looked very manly and purposelike. No, the <b>best</b> <b>part</b> <b>was</b> poor old drunken Joe, the Portuguese boatman, who seemed to think himself specially charged with the reception, and ended by falling on his knees before the Chief Justice {{on the end of}} the pier and in full view of the whole town and bay. The natives pelted him with rotten bananas; how the Chief Justice took it I was too far off to see; but it was highly absurd.|$|R
50|$|In {{the second}} half we see small Cinnamon trees being cut in Sri Lanka. The outer Bark is scraped by hand and the inner bark is then {{carefully}} removed with a knife. The <b>best</b> <b>parts</b> <b>are</b> used to create an outer sheaf and the other <b>parts</b> <b>are</b> placed within. These outer sheaves are joined {{to each other and}} overlap slightly to create a standard length stick or rod known as a quill. The sticks are then rolled daily as they dry and are tied into bundles for trading and transport.|$|R
2500|$|Critical {{responses}} to the characters have been positive. Time reported in July 2016 that [...] "people are thrilled about Nickelodeon's decision" [...] to include a gay couple. Kaitlyn Hayes of PinkNews wrote in her review of The Loud House that their portrayal in [...] "such a natural and accurate way still puts a huge smile on our faces." [...] Radio Times reported that the social networking site Twitter had given rise to many [...] "overwhelmingly positive" [...] tweets about the couple. Laura Bradley of Vanity Fair stated that The Loud House [...] "handles the topic [...] in exactly the right way...this kind of casual representation in children's programming is a milestone." [...] De Elizabeth of Teen Vogue wrote, [...] "The <b>best</b> <b>part</b> <b>is</b> that the show doesn’t treat these characters any differently, or even introduce them with a heavy asterisk about their marital status." [...] The Friskys Tai Gooden mentioned that [...] "kids who have two dads (or moms) {{will be more than}} thrilled to see a family they can identify with on TV." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reviewers {{were mostly}} unified {{in the overall}} fun factor in the game. [...] Levi Buchanan of IGN stated that the game was [...] "fun, fun, fun" [...] and [...] "an instant pleasure".

[...] He likened this to playing the game while waiting in line for something and stated [...] "it'll slice the time in half." [...] Jim Squires of GameZebo felt the gameplay was simple and addictive. [...] Geoff Gibson of DIYGamer stated {{that he could see}} Fruit Ninja [...] "becoming the next [...] "big thing" [...] on the App Store." [...] Several reviewers praised price and Halfbrick's commitment to continual updates to the game. [...] GameZone's James Pikover stated [...] "perhaps the <b>best</b> <b>part</b> <b>is</b> that this game isn't even complete." [...] He then spoke of the future game modes to be made available and lauded the value-to-price ratio. [...] App Spy's Andrew Nesvadba agreed that Halfbrick's commitment and updates were [...] "nothing short of spectacular." [...] He also praised the game's graphics and said they were [...] "luscious". [...] The reviewer from BuzzFocus praised the game's inexpensive price and said consumers [...] "should really be downloading this app right now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The <b>best</b> <b>part</b> <b>is</b> to come," [...] said Nick, {{giving a}} final touch to his neck-band. Followed by Benjy's adoring eyes, {{he started out}} of the door, and I {{followed}} him perforce. We came to the little church, of upright logs and plaster, with its crudely shingled, peaked roof, with its tiny belfry crowned by a cross, with its porches on each side shading the line of windows there. Beside the church, a little at the back, was the cure's modest house of stone, and at the other hand, under spreading trees, the graveyard with its rough wooden crosses. And behind these graves rose the wooded hill that stretched away towards the wilderness.|$|E
50|$|She was a {{low comedy}} actress, who without any splendid talent had such a {{complete}} knowledge of stage requirements that her services were most useful in any theatre. Her figure was neat, and she often assumed male characters. Her <b>best</b> <b>parts</b> <b>were</b> Lucy in the Rivals, the Widow Warren in the Road to Ruin, Miss Mac-Tab in the Poor Gentleman, and the old Lady Lambert in the Hypocrite. She, however, essayed the majority of Mrs. Jordan's characters, and played them with considerable success.|$|R
5000|$|The {{city walls}} were taken {{down when the}} city {{expanded}} in the early 19th century, but the street layout of the Old Town still corresponds closely {{to that of the}} former protected city, with a grid of narrow streets. Surviving fragments of the walls, some of which have been further reconstructed, can be seen on Stawna Street, Ludgardy Street, next to Chopin Park in the south of the Old Market Square and <b>best</b> <b>parts</b> <b>are</b> on Masztalarska street in the north.|$|R
5000|$|Stakhovich, {{who taught}} 'high class manners' in the MAT school, [...] "...was a gifted man who deeply {{understood}} art, but hardly a strong actor... a mere raw material, for he started too late, grasping instantly those technical methods he understood best," [...] argued Prince Sergey Volkonsky. [...] "Stakhovich {{was not an}} actor, rather a mannikin of aristocrat. His <b>best</b> <b>part</b> <b>was</b> that of Stepan Verkhovensky in Nikolai Stavrogin on Besy, where he was just himself," [...] theatre historian Vadim Shverubovich opined.|$|R
6000|$|Third. Living {{by faith}} makes a man {{exercise}} patience and quietness under all his afflictions; for faith shows {{him that his}} <b>best</b> <b>part</b> <b>is</b> safe, that his soul is in God's special care and protection, purged from sin {{in the blood of}} Christ. Faith also shows him that after a little while he shall be in the full enjoyment of that which now he believes is coming: 'We, through the Spirit, wait for the hope of righteousness by faith' (Gal 5:5). Wherefore, upon this ground it is that James exhorteth the saints to whom he wrote, to patience, because they knew the harvest would in due time come (James 5:7-11). Faith lodgeth the soul with Christ: 'I know,' saith Paul, 'on whom I have believed,' and to whom I have committed my soul, 'and am persuaded,' I believe it, 'that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day'; therefore it were no shame to him to wear a chain for his name and sake (2 Tim 1:12). O! it is a blessed thing to see, I say, by the faith of the Lord Jesus, that we are embarked in the same ship with him; this will help us greatly 'both to hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the Lord' (Psa 46:1-6; Lam 3:26).

[...] The 1998 premiere of the {{completed}} work was also well reviewed: The Opera News claimed [...] "the opera bubbles with glorious vocal writing" [...] and the <b>best</b> <b>parts</b> <b>were</b> the duets between Patience and Sarah, but that Parson Peel's music actually stole the show.|$|R
5000|$|An {{example of}} their use {{is given by}} Meha Agrawal: [...] "Starting from the center, I would add tier after tier of blocks to build my pattern — it was an {{iterative}} process, because if something didn't look aesthetically appealing or fit correctly, it would require peeling off a layer and reevaluating ways to fix it. The <b>best</b> <b>part</b> <b>was</b> the gratification I received when my creation was complete. Though individually boring, collectively these blocks produced an intricate masterpiece that brought art and math, big-picture and detail, simplicity and complexity closer together".|$|R

Reviewing a February, 2012 concert on Capitol Hill in Seattle, Andrew Matson of The Seattle Times wrote that [...] "Trance is Pollens' strong suit.
