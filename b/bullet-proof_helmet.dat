Hundreds of thousands of vests and helmets were supplied {{and some of them}} are in use today. The next generation of Russian aramid fibre was created and put into large production scale in 1989 for composite applications under the tradename of ARMOS. The main features of this fibre were long lifetime under the load (more than 15 years), high modulus (110-160 GPa) and produced without any sizing.|$|R
