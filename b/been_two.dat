5|$|As it had <b>been</b> <b>two</b> {{decades since}} much silver was {{regularly}} deposited for striking into coins, {{the fact that}} the United States had been on a bimetallic standard since 1792 was often forgotten. The gold standard was seen as the only possible choice, and many people assumed that the United States was on that standard, which had been adopted by strong nations like the United Kingdom (1816) and the German Empire (1871).|$|E

5|$|Berhtwald died on 13 January 731. An epitaph to him {{in verse}} survives, {{and may have been}} placed over his tomb, which was at Canterbury. Subsequently he was canonised with a feast day of 9 January. Little {{evidence}} of extensive cult activity exists, however, and the main evidence for his sainthood is a late medieval entry in a St Augustine's calendar. Berhtwald is the first of the continuous series of native-born archbishops in England, although there had <b>been</b> <b>two</b> previous Anglo-Saxon archbishops at Canterbury—Deusdedit and Wighard.|$|E

It featured different voice actors and music from the regular series.|$|E

5|$|Controversy {{has arisen}} since the {{creation}} of the awards; there have <b>been</b> <b>two</b> occasions when no award was given because no titles were judged to be odd enough, Bent has complained about some of the winners chosen by the public, and the 2008 winner, The 2009–2014 World Outlook for 60-milligram Containers of Fromage Frais, proved controversial because rather than being written by its listed author, Philip M.

The most recent winner, in July 2017, was The Commuter Pig Keeper: A Comprehensive Guide to Keeping Pigs when Time is your Most Precious Commodity by Michaela Giles.|$|E
5|$|Coyote {{attacks on}} humans are {{uncommon}} and rarely cause serious injuries, {{due to the}} relatively small size of the coyote, but have been increasingly frequent, especially in California. There have <b>been</b> <b>two</b> confirmed fatal attacks: one on a three-year-old named Kelly Keen in Glendale, California and another on a nineteen-year-old named Taylor Mitchell in Nova Scotia, Canada. In the 30 {{years leading up to}} March 2006, at least 160 attacks occurred in the United States, mostly in the Los Angeles County area. Data from United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Wildlife Services, the California Department of Fish and Game, and other sources show that while 41 attacks occurred during the period of 1988–1997, 48 attacks were verified from 1998 through 2003. The majority of these incidents occurred in Southern California near the suburban-wildland interface.|$|E

The club's best League Cup performance was reaching the quarter-final in the 1967–68 season.|$|E
5000|$|Another typical {{example is}} the {{statement}} that [...] "there <b>are</b> <b>two</b> different groups of order 4 up to isomorphism", or [...] "modulo isomorphism, there <b>are</b> <b>two</b> groups of order 4".
