5|$|Further, scrutinizing {{legislation}} {{to determine if}} it contravenes fundamental liberties is traditionally {{the function of the}} judiciary. Even though the PCMR can potentially prevent an unconstitutional piece of legislation from coming into force, there is doubt as to whether the Council's members have sufficient legal training to undertake the <b>burdensome</b> task.|$|E
5|$|India is tenth in {{the world}} in factory output. Manufacturing sector in {{addition}} to mining, quarrying, electricity and gas together account for 27.6% of the GDP and employ 17% of the total workforce. Economic reforms introduced after 1991 brought foreign competition, led to privatisation of certain public sector industries, opened up sectors hitherto reserved for the public sector and led to an expansion in the production of fast-moving consumer goods. In recent years, Indian cities have continued to liberalise, but excessive and <b>burdensome</b> business regulations remain a problem in some cities, like Kochi and Kolkata.|$|E
5|$|The 5.7×28mm {{cartridge}} weighs 6.0grams (93grains)—roughly {{half as much}} as {{a typical}} 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge—making extra ammunition less <b>burdensome,</b> or allowing more ammunition to be carried for the same weight. Since the 5.7×28mm cartridge also has a relatively small diameter, a relatively high number of cartridges can be contained in a magazine. The cartridge has a loud report and produces considerable muzzle flash (when fired from a pistol), but it has roughly 30 percent less recoil than the 9×19mm cartridge, improving controllability. Due to its high velocity, the 5.7×28mm also exhibits an exceptionally flat trajectory.|$|E
5|$|The group {{travelled}} north, passing present-day Chillicothe, Ohio, {{on the way}} to a Mingo {{village on}} the north side of the Mad River, somewhere near present-day Logan County, Ohio. During the trip the Indians killed and scalped Martin's child, which they found <b>burdensome.</b> Martin responded by screaming in grief; when the Indians' threats to scalp her did not quiet her screams, they whipped her until she was silent. Alder's life was spared due to his appearance. His captors thought his black hair would allow him to pass as an Indian.|$|E
5|$|During {{the presidential}} {{referendum}} in Egypt, Nasser was re-elected {{to a second}} term as UAR president and took his oath on 25 March 1965. He was the only candidate for the position, with virtually all of his political opponents forbidden by law from running for office, and his fellow party members reduced to mere followers. That same year, Nasser had the Muslim Brotherhood chief ideologue Sayyed Qutb imprisoned. Qutb was charged and found guilty by the court of plotting to assassinate Nasser, and was executed in 1966. Beginning in 1966, as Egypt's economy slowed and government debt became increasingly <b>burdensome,</b> Nasser began to ease state control over the private sector, encouraging state-owned bank loans to private business and introducing incentives to increase exports. During the 60's, the Egyptian economy went from sluggishness to the verge of collapse, the society became less free, and Nasser's appeal waned considerably.|$|E
5|$|The Importance of Being Earnest, A Trivial Comedy for Serious People is a play by Oscar Wilde. First {{performed}} on 14 February 1895 at the St James's Theatre in London, it is a farcical comedy {{in which the}} protagonists maintain fictitious personæ to escape <b>burdensome</b> social obligations. Working within the social conventions of late Victorian London, the play's major themes are the triviality with which it treats institutions as serious as marriage, and the resulting satire of Victorian ways. Contemporary reviews all praised the play's humour, though some were cautious about its explicit lack of social messages, while others foresaw the modern consensus {{that it was the}} culmination of Wilde's artistic career so far. Its high farce and witty dialogue have helped make The Importance of Being Earnest Wilde's most enduringly popular play.|$|E
5|$|The fourth part, The Shadow Side, {{looks at}} {{what happens to}} debtors and {{creditors}} when debts are not re-paid. Some debts that are a matter of honour to which the debtor must repay by an equivalent value or creditor must either forgive or exact revenge. Debts to society, after committing crimes, are paid through vengeance-based imprisonment. The United Kingdom had debtors' prison for {{those who could not}} pay, but this was abolished for economic reasons as it prevented labourers from working and had a <b>burdensome</b> cost of operation. Other societies used the services of their family members or themselves as collateral. Sometimes the debtors overthrew the creditors, like King Philip IV of France against the Knights Templar, or the Ugandans against the Asians. Atwood applies the trickle-down economics to debt and examines the psychology side through the Jungian Shadow.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{development}} of coordinated fleets of ships capable of landing an invasion force, naval warfare {{has been an important}} aspect in the defense (or conquest) of maritime states. The first naval battle in recorded history saw Suppiluliuma II of the Hittites burn a Cypriot fleet at sea in 1210 BC. Shortly after, the fleets of the Sea Peoples disrupted the entire Eastern Mediterranean: over a period of about 50 years, raids and invasions violently destroyed nearly every coastal city between Pylos and Gaza. As empires grew and their armies became too large to live off the lands through which they passed, disruption of their supply fleets also became a powerful tactic. The 480 BC Battle of Salamis largely determined the course of the Persian Wars not because of its inherent damage (however considerable) but because Themistocles's deception and superior strategy left the Athenians capable of disrupting sea-borne supplies at will and potentially striking at the pontoon bridges across the Hellespont, cutting off the Persians' line of retreat. During the age of wooden ships, however, great fleets were <b>burdensome</b> to maintain and always liable to destruction by contrary weather, most famously {{in the case of the}} two kamikaze typhoons that destroyed the Mongol invasions of Japan in AD 1274 and 1281.|$|E
5|$|When Bevin {{told the}} media {{he would have}} an {{announcement}} at his campaign headquarters on April 28, speculation raged that he would {{drop out of the}} race. Instead, Bevin announced that he would release his jobs plan later in the week and chided the local media for focusing on issues other than the economy. On May 1, Bevin released the promised jobs plan, which called for a gradual reduction of the federal corporate tax rate to 10% over five years, allowing companies to return overseas profits to the United States with a 10% tax assessment, and passage of a federal right-to-work law. Saying that <b>burdensome</b> regulations from agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency were harmful to business' ability to create jobs, he endorsed the REINS Act, which would require congressional approval of any executive regulation with an economic impact of more than $100 million. He also proposed a flat income tax and opposed an increase in the federal minimum wage.|$|E
25|$|Costs of {{continuing}} the plan have become unreasonably <b>burdensome</b> {{solely because of}} {{a decline in the}} employer's workforce.|$|E
25|$|Cyberlaw Clinic at Harvard Law School {{points out}} that the {{rulemaking}} is a complicated, ad hoc, and unduly <b>burdensome</b> process.|$|E

25|$|The game uses much of {{the same}} {{mechanisms}} as Star Fleet Battles, such as power allocation, multiple systems, and ship maneuvering. However, it gets rid of some processes which some found <b>burdensome,</b> such as atmospheric maneuvering, and Marine guards defending aboard ships.|$|E
25|$|She {{decided to}} open a child care center in Montgomery County, but she found the state {{licensing}} process to be <b>burdensome.</b> She reasoned {{that it must be}} even more <b>burdensome</b> for individuals who have limited or no English-speaking abilities, leaving them at risk of fines and closures if they decide to provide unlicensed child care services. In 1998, Navarro co-founded Centro Familia, a small local nonprofit organization that trained people so they can be licensed in child care. She volunteered for the organization at no pay until the organization received enough state and county grant money that it could pay her a salary and hire four instructors two years later. She was with the organization until 2006.|$|E
25|$|The prime-minister of Piedmont, Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour, {{was aware}} of the French {{objectives}} and was looking for an opportunity to serve these, {{while at the same time}} fulfilling his own by removing the <b>burdensome</b> yoke of Austrian repression from as many Italian citizens as possible.|$|E
25|$|These {{labeling}} practices {{place the}} burden of getting certification on the producers in the Global South, furthering inequality between the Global North and the Global South. The process of securing certification is excessively <b>burdensome</b> and expensive. Northern consumers are able to just make a simple choice without these burdens and expenses.|$|E
25|$|The {{legal system}} of the English during the late seventeenth century was built upon common law (28 Henry VIII, c. 15). This allowed circumstantial {{evidence}} to be admissible, but also forced the captured {{to be transferred to}} England where the law was enforceable. This made it <b>burdensome</b> for the colonial governments to enforce extradition.|$|E
25|$|In December 2011 the {{outgoing}} Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Donald Berwick, asserted that 20% to 30% {{of health care}} spending is waste. He listed five causes for the waste: (1) overtreatment of patients, (2) the failure to coordinate care, (3) the administrative complexity {{of the health care}} system, (4) <b>burdensome</b> rules and (5) fraud.|$|E
25|$|A {{shift in}} NCSC's {{strategy}} proved crucial {{in helping to}} build support for Medicare as well. NCSC began a major education campaign among middle-aged people, working to raise awareness of how <b>burdensome</b> hospital bills for the elderly could be. Medicare's passage in the U.S. Senate was very close, and NCSC's efforts were considered instrumental in its enactment.|$|E
25|$|In December 2011, the {{outgoing}} Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Dr. Donald Berwick, asserted that 20% to 30% {{of health care}} spending is waste.

25|$|In late 2016, Uber {{threatened}} to leave Houston {{ahead of the}} Super Bowl LI festivities, insisting various city regulations, including fingerprint background checks of drivers, were too <b>burdensome</b> and prevented drivers from working. Houston officials and Uber reached a compromise in December 2016, whereby Houston would continue to require a fingerprint check for drivers but eliminate requirements for driver drug testing and physicals through at least February 5, 2017.|$|E
25|$|Bianchi {{proposed}} {{the creation of}} four different roles for locomotives in order to specialize maintenance services more than had previously been possible. This strategy of specialization was not entirely new, {{but at that time}} the depot-system was very heterogeneous: inherited from the different railroad administrations left over after the 1905 birth of the national railway system, it had many different engines carrying out the same task, making management and maintenance <b>burdensome.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the ambitious Foro Bonaparte project, there were also plans for an important development near the Corso di Porta Ticinese. Entrusted to Cagnola in 1801, the project covered a monumental gateway in today's Piazza XXIV Maggio, straightening the Corso di Porta Ticinese, creating buildings with arcades along the road and constructing a monumental bridge over the canal. Here too the project was deemed too <b>burdensome.</b> The only outcome was a modified Porta Ticinese.|$|E
25|$|The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed in {{part and}} {{reversed}} in part, upholding {{all of the}} regulations except for the husband notification requirement. The Third Circuit concluded that the husband notification was unduly <b>burdensome</b> because it potentially exposed married women to spousal abuse, violence, and economic duress {{at the hands of}} their husbands. Then-Circuit Judge Samuel Alito sat on that three-judge appellate panel and dissented from the court's invalidation of that requirement.|$|E
25|$|Emotional {{blackmail}} and FOG, terms {{coined by}} psychotherapist Susan Forward, are about controlling people in relationships {{and the theory}} that fear, obligation and guilt ("FOG") are the transactional dynamics at play between the controller and the person being controlled. Understanding these dynamics is useful to anyone trying to extricate from the controlling behavior of another person, and deal with their own compulsions {{to do things that}} are uncomfortable, undesirable, <b>burdensome,</b> or self-sacrificing for others.|$|E
25|$|Currently, {{most modern}} {{monetary}} systems {{are based on}} fiat money. However, for most of history, almost all money was commodity money, such as gold and silver coins. As economies developed, commodity money was eventually replaced by representative money, such as the gold standard, as traders found the physical transportation of gold and silver <b>burdensome.</b> Fiat currencies gradually took over in the last hundred years, especially since {{the breakup of the}} Bretton Woods system in the early 1970s.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} non-English publications, Gaa Paa was also {{faced with the}} <b>burdensome</b> task of {{supplying}} English translations of all political articles and editorial comments during the wartime years. Efforts to soften tone and comply with statutory regulations in order to appease federal authorities proved inadequate for Postmaster General Albert S. Burleson, however, and in 1918 Gaa Paa was denied access to the United States mails. This proved a harsh blow to the financially unstable publication, threatening its survival.|$|E
25|$|In response, West Virginia filed {{a lawsuit}} to declare invalid the withdrawal-notice {{requirement}} stipulated in the Big East's bylaws. The lawsuit alleged that the Big East breached its fiduciary duty by allowing several football-playing members to depart, causing the conference to {{no longer be a}} major football conference and jeopardizing its continued existence. Because of this, West Virginia alleged, its continued performance under the contract had become unreasonably <b>burdensome</b> and its original purpose in entering into the contract had been eliminated.|$|E
25|$|Michael VIII's {{foreign policy}} {{relied heavily on}} diplomacy; nevertheless, his {{construction}} projects and military campaigns against the remaining Latins were extensive as well as expensive; the Nicaean army was modeled around the Komnenian army, and while {{it was not as}} effective, it was just as <b>burdensome</b> on the treasury. The result was that heavy taxes were levied on the peasantry, something that the Ottomans would later use to their advantage, winning over these poverty-stricken peasants with promises of lower taxes.|$|E
25|$|Honors and tributes flowed to Bell in {{increasing}} numbers as his invention became ubiquitous and his personal fame grew. Bell received numerous honorary degrees from colleges and universities {{to the point that}} the requests almost became <b>burdensome.</b> During his life, he also received dozens of major awards, medals, and other tributes. These included statuary monuments to both him and the new form of communication his telephone created, including the Bell Telephone Memorial erected in his honor in Alexander Graham Bell Gardens in Brantford, Ontario, in 1917.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, he was {{appointed}} deputy editor at a local Science Fiction magazine, where he worked until 1996. This {{was one of the}} hardest periods of Sergei's life, as his family struggled to make ends meet. He often attributes the rather grim tones of his works to those financial and personal hardships. However, by the mid-90's the situation improved drastically, but soon his growing popularity as a writer made frequent trips to Russia increasingly <b>burdensome.</b> Thus, in 1996 Lukyanenko moved to Moscow, where he currently resides.|$|E
25|$|Doing Business is a {{controversial}} study, with passionate critics and devoted fans. As {{recognized by the}} Independent Evaluation Group of the World Bank, some have questioned the reliability and objectivity of its measurements while others doubt {{the relevance of the}} issues it addresses or fear it may unduly dominate countries reform agendas at the expense of more crucial development objectives. Attention given to the indicators may inadvertently signal that the World Bank Group values less <b>burdensome</b> business regulations more highly than its other strategies for poverty reduction and sustainable development.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} ongoing {{efforts to improve}} water {{resources}} management in Honduras, many challenges continue to exist such as insufficient employment generation, unfavorable investment climate, overvalued currency, lack of credit, high commercial interest rates, deficient infrastructure (water delivery, electricity, communications, and roads), weak legal institutions, inadequate education and workforce productivity, <b>burdensome</b> bureaucratic obstacles, and an unstable political climate. As Honduras {{and the international community}} work together to address these hurdles, Honduras will improve water supplies, quality of water, efficiency in irrigation, important freshwater wildlife habitats, and reduce annual flood damage.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{attaining}} {{the age of}} 90, the Radbaz resigned {{the chief}} rabbinate and divided {{the greater part of}} his fortune among the poor, making special provision for Torah scholars. He then moved to Jerusalem. But he did not stay there long, due to the <b>burdensome</b> taxes that the Turkish government had imposed upon Jews. He settled in Safed, where he became {{an active member of the}} rabbinical court presided over by Yosef Karo, who held him in great esteem. He spent the last 20 years of his life in peace, continuing his learning and his writing.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, the {{condemned}} {{was forced to}} carry the crossbeam {{to the place of}} execution. A whole cross would weigh well over 135kg (300lb), but the crossbeam would not be quite as <b>burdensome,</b> weighing around 45kg (100lb). The Roman historian Tacitus records that the city of Rome had a specific place for carrying out executions, situated outside the Esquiline Gate, and had a specific area reserved for the execution of slaves by crucifixion. Upright posts would presumably be fixed permanently in that place, and the crossbeam, with {{the condemned}} person perhaps already nailed to it, would then be attached to the post.|$|E
25|$|He {{viewed the}} royal court of his {{predecessors}} as inefficient, corrupt, and expensive. Thousands of servants, eunuchs, and superfluous officials were therefore summarily dismissed. He set up the Chalcedon tribunal {{to deal with the}} corruption of the previous administration under the supervision of Magister Militum Arbitio. Several high-ranking officials under Constantius including the chamberlain Eusebius were found guilty and executed. (Julian was conspicuously absent from the proceedings, perhaps signaling his displeasure at their necessity.) He continually sought to reduce what he saw as a <b>burdensome</b> and corrupt bureaucracy within the Imperial administration whether it involved civic officials, the secret agents, or the imperial post service.|$|E
