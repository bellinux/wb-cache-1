50|$|The {{fuselage}} {{was constructed}} using chrome-moly steel tubing covered with doped cotton fabric and {{the wings and}} empennage were constructed of spruce and mahogany <b>plywood</b> <b>box</b> spars and <b>plywood</b> ribs and skins, also covered with fabric. The use of aluminum, which was in critically short supply and more urgently needed for other aircraft, {{was limited to the}} engine cowling, tail cone, framework for the ailerons, rudder and elevator and the landing gear fairings. The L-5 was powered by a six-cylinder 190 horsepower Lycoming O-435 engine.|$|R
40|$|This safety {{evaluation}} for packaging evaluates and documents {{the ability of}} the <b>plywood</b> <b>boxes</b> listed below to meet the packaging requirements of WHC-CM- 2 - 14, Hazardous Material Packaging and Shipping, for the onsite transfer of Type B radioactive material. Onsite transfer is the transport of hazardous materials on controlled routes confined to established limited areas and to portions of federally owned roadways to which public access is prohibited during transfer. The <b>plywood</b> <b>boxes</b> being used for this transport are PIN number PNLD- 95 - 322 and PNLD- 95 - 385. The contents being transported are wood, plastic, piping, rubber, and gloves. The source term was determined by nondestructive analysis and obtained from the solid waste storage/disposal record. Before the nondestructive analysis, the intention was to transport the boxes under WHC-SD-TP-SEP- 020, Safety Evaluation for Packaging (Onsite) <b>Plywood</b> <b>Box</b> (WHC 1994), but Type B shipments are not included...|$|R
40|$|Traditional bamboo {{basket and}} {{expanded}} polystyrene insulated <b>plywood</b> <b>box</b> (second hand tea-chest) were compared for transportation of iced marine, fresh water and brackish water fishes from Kakinada to Madras by rail.

25|$|The most {{important}} precaution {{is to remove}} and reduce trash and rubbish from your property, such as woodpiles, <b>boxes,</b> <b>plywood,</b> tires, and trash cans—especially if they are stored {{right next to the}} house. With attached garages, block off house access by sealing cracks around doors and access holes for electrical conduits or plumbing. In the Midwest, some brown recluse bites occur when a sleeping person rolls over during the night, and the trapped spider bites. In the bedroom, move the bed away from the wall, remove any skirts or ruffles and remove all items stored under it. This minimizes chances that any spider can crawl onto the bed. Do not leave clothes and shoes on the floor, or shake them before dressing if they are left out. Apparel and equipment that is only occasionally worn should be stored in tightly closed plastic bags, especially if stored in the garage or other dark storage areas. Typically, pesticide control of spiders is difficult. There are various insecticides available in retail outlets labeled for spider control. However, spiders' perched legs allow them to walk over most pesticides, making the use of chemicals to eradicate the spiders impractical and unnecessarily toxic. A 2014 study indicates that fumigation may be more effective than previously believed. Sticky traps placed along floor boards offer a non-insecticidal way to trap spiders as well as provide an idea of population levels in the structure.|$|R
50|$|In the Central Illinois Washers variant, {{the game}} uses wooden boxes with 2 × 4 sides (15 inches outside / 12 inches inside). The <b>boxes</b> have <b>plywood</b> bottoms (- innc thick - 15 inches × 15 inches square) and {{are lined with}} carpet - (12 inch × 12 inch - {{thickness}} optional, short/medium is preferable). A 4-inch PVC pipe is cut to a height that is level with {{the top of the}} side boards. The boxes are placed 30 ft apart (front of Box 1 to front of Box 2) on level ground, preferably going North and South to avoid sunlight distraction for one side/player.|$|R

50|$|The side-by-side, two-seat Joigny light cabin {{monoplane}} {{was designed}} by the Societe de Recherches et de Constructions Mecaniques (SRCM) at their Joigny Yonne factory in April 1958. The firm had previously built under licence a number of Minicabs, Supercabs and Jodels, and originally intended to manufacture the Aviamilano F.8L Falco always under license. This project did not materialize and production series of Joigny was due to start in 1960. The Joigny was of all-wood construction and employed a fully retractable nosewheel undercarriage. The wing had a single main spar and an auxiliary main spar with leading edge torsion <b>box</b> and <b>plywood</b> covering. The aircraft's cabin section was built integral with the wing, the rear fuselage being a plywood monocoque.|$|R

50|$|The Viima II is {{a single}} engined, tandem seater biplane. Viima means Gale in English. Post war, VL was {{eventually}} absorbed into Valmet, so the aircraft {{is often referred to}} as the Valmet Viima. It has unequal span, staggered single bay wings built around two <b>box</b> spars with <b>plywood</b> ribs. The interplane struts are N-shaped. The wings are fabric covered and carry four ailerons in all; the upper and lower ailerons are externally linked.|$|R
25|$|Its wings were {{trapezoidal}} in plan, {{though with}} long, rounded tips. Their thickness reduced outwards, largely from below, {{contributing to the}} significant dihedral. Structurally, the wings were wooden, each with two longerons which were joined into a <b>box</b> spar by <b>plywood</b> skin out to three-quarter span; this appears dark in the photograph above. The rest of the surfaces, including the unbalanced ailerons which occupied about half the span, were silk covered. The ailerons had frames of elektron, a recently developed magnesium alloy.|$|R

50|$|Portable urine-diversion {{dehydration}} toilets are self-contained dry toilets, {{sometimes referred}} to as mobile or stand-alone units. They are identifiable by their one-piece molded plastic shells or, in the case of DIY versions, simple <b>plywood</b> <b>box</b> construction. Most users of self-contained UDDTs rely upon a post-treatment process to ensure pathogen reduction. This post-treatment may consist of long-term storage or addition to an existing or purpose-built compost pile or some combination thereof. A post-treatment step is unnecessary in the case of very modest seasonal use.|$|R
50|$|Its {{one piece}} {{cantilever}} wing had spruce <b>plywood</b> <b>box</b> spars and ribs and was okoumé plywood covered. It {{was attached to}} the upper fuselage longerons at six points and had a 4 m centre section of constant chord and thickness. Beyond, the wing thinned from its underside, creating positive dihedral and became semi-elliptical in plan. Long (2.8 m, more than 60% of the half-span) ailerons, unusually mounted inboard and gently decreasing in chord outboard, produced an overall wing plan close to the ideal ellipse.|$|R
25|$|Other {{types of}} UDDTs exist which are {{essentially}} {{variations of the}} single-vault type, but which are more self-contained, {{sometimes referred to as}} portable, mobile or stand-alone units and identifiable by their one-piece molded plastic shells or, in the case of DIY versions, simple <b>plywood</b> <b>box</b> construction.
