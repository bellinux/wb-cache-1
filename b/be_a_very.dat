5|$|At first, {{the forests}} of the {{watershed}} were not significantly affected, but after logging operations sprung up near {{the start of the}} 20th century, most of the virgin timber in the watershed was cleared. The first sawmills were built to provide lumber for local uses, such as building houses and barns. Soon, however, the Washington, Idaho and Montana Railway extended its tracks into the area, allowing lumber to be exported out of the basin. Logging turned out to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> profitable industry but had a lasting negative effect on the ecology of the Potlatch River watershed.|$|E
5|$|Darmstadtium is {{expected}} to be a solid under normal conditions and to crystallize in the body-centered cubic structure, unlike its lighter congeners which crystallize in the face-centered cubic structure, because it {{is expected}} to have different electron charge densities from them. It should <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> heavy metal with a density of around 34.8g/cm3. In comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of only 22.61g/cm3. This results from darmstadtium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough darmstadtium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay.|$|E

5|$|Kosygin {{would prove}} to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> {{competent}} administrator, with the Soviet standard of living rising considerably due to his moderately reformist policy. Kosygin's moderate 1965 reform, as with Nikita Khrushchev's thaw, radicalised the Soviet reform movement. While Leonid Brezhnev was content to maintain the centralised structure of the Soviet planned economy, Kosygin attempted to revitalise the ailing economic system by decentralising management. Following Brezhnev's death in 1982, the reform movement was split between Yuri Andropov's path of discipline and control and Gorbachev's liberalisation of all aspects of public life.|$|E

5|$|Thus, in the {{presence}} of the inhibitor, the enzyme's effective Km and Vmax become (α/α')Km and (1/α')Vmax, respectively. However, the modified Michaelis-Menten equation assumes that binding of the inhibitor to the enzyme has reached equilibrium, which may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> slow process for inhibitors with sub-nanomolar dissociation constants. In these cases, it is usually more practical to treat the tight-binding inhibitor as an irreversible inhibitor (see below); however, it can still be possible to estimate Ki' kinetically if Ki is measured independently.|$|E

5|$|Bohrium is {{expected}} to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a hexagonal close-packed crystal structure (c/a=1.62), similar to its lighter congener rhenium. It should <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> heavy metal with a density of around 37.1g/cm3, which would be the third-highest of any of the 118 known elements, lower than only meitnerium (37.4g/cm3) and hassium (41g/cm3), the two following elements in the periodic table. In comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of only 22.61g/cm3.

5|$|Byzantine {{churches are}} not the only source of {{inspiration}} that researchers attribute to the Round Church. Some scholars link its design to an Armenian influence, perhaps brought to Bulgaria by craftsmen from the Caucasus. In general, churches with such an antiquated plan in the Balkans are associated with the migration of Cappadocian, Armenian, or Georgian monks. Another possible model for the Round Church in Preslav may well be found in Carolingian architecture from the time of Charlemagne, and particularly the Palatine Chapel in Aachen, western Germany, with which it shares some characteristics. At the time of the Round Church's construction, Bulgaria was in direct contact with the Frankish Empire. One trait of the Round Church that is claimed by scholars to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> recognisable Carolingian influence is the presence of a monumental westwork.|$|E
5|$|Copernicium should <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> {{heavy metal}} with a density of around 23.7g/cm3 in the solid state; in comparison, the most dense known element {{that has had}} its density measured, osmium, has a density of only 22.61g/cm3. This results from copernicium's high atomic weight, the {{lanthanide}} and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough copernicium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay. However, some calculations predict copernicium to be a gas at room temperature, the first gaseous metal in the periodic table (the second being flerovium), due to the closed-shell electron configurations of copernicium and flerovium. The atomic radius of copernicium {{is expected to be}} around 147pm. Due to the relativistic stabilization of the 7s orbital and destabilization of the 6d orbital, the Cn+ and Cn2+ ions are predicted to give up 6d electrons instead of 7s electrons, which is the opposite of the behavior of its lighter homologues.|$|E

5|$|During the Battle of Malvern Hill on 1 July 1862, Brandon's {{ankle joint}} {{was struck by}} a ball. As he fell, his hand hit a rolling shell which did not explode. Oblivious to his wounds, Brandon tried to rise again but he fell once more and {{remained}} on the field until men were able to pick him up and carry him to the rear. Because there was no visible bleeding, Brandon thought that his injuries were not serious but was taken on horse-back to a hospital. Initially, Brandon was offered whiskey which would have eased the pain, but he refused to drink it without water and sugar. He drank it only after being convinced it was necessary. Brandon's foot was removed after a torniquet was put in place. Brandon's arteries were then sewn in what was likely to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> painful procedure, as there was not enough choloroform to produce a full anesthesia. To replace his amputated leg, his doctors gave him a wooden prosthetic leg. Because of Brandon's age, his doctors thought his chances of survival were slight.

After his college graduation, he enlists in the US Army, where he befriends a fellow soldier named Bubba, who convinces Forrest {{to go into the}} shrimping business with him when the war is over.
