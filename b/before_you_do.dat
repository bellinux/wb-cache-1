500|$|The school {{treated the}} {{incident}} seriously and called police {{to the school}} {{in the days after}} the noose incident. The principal called an assembly on September 6, 2006. The Jena Police Department asked Parish Attorney Walters to attend and speak at the assembly. Already pressed for time due to a case under preparation, Walters felt that the students were not paying proper attention to him. He warned them, [...] "I can be your best friend or your worst enemy. With the stroke of a pen I can make life miserable for you or ruin your life. So I want you to call me <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> something stupid." [...] Though black students say Walters was looking at them when he made the comments, Walters and school board member Billy Fowler, also present, deny it. Walters said that he was irritated at [...] "two or three girls, white girls, [...] were chit-chatting on their cellphones or playing with their cellphones".|$|E
500|$|Davis proved, perhaps, to be {{the most}} pivotal instrumentalist during these sessions. [...] "If you listen to the album, every tune is led by Richard and {{everybody}} followed Richard and Van's voice," [...] says Merenstein. [...] "I knew if I brought Richard in, he would put the bottom on to support what Van wanted to do vocally, or acoustically. Then you get Jay playing those beautiful counter-lines to Van." [...] Davis was not impressed by Morrison, but not out of disdain or any preconceived notions, but rather because Morrison's professional comportment generally did not meet Davis's expectations. [...] "No prep, no meeting," [...] recalls Davis. [...] "He was remote from us, 'cause he came in and went into a booth... And that's where he stayed, isolated in a booth. I don't think he ever introduced himself to us, nor we to him... And he seemed very shy..." [...] Drummer Connie Kay later told Rolling Stone that he approached Morrison and asked [...] "what he wanted me to play, and he said to play whatever I felt like playing. We more or less sat there and jammed." [...] Morrison's impression of the sessions was [...] "The songs came together very well in the studio. Some of the tracks were first takes. [...] the musicians were really together. Those type of guys play what you're gonna do <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> it, that's how good they are." [...] He told Ritchie Yorke that only two tracks recorded during the sessions did not make it to the album. [...] "One was about Jesse James and the other about trains. They were both just basic blues numbers. That's why they didn't fit in with the album." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 209, after Cao Cao {{returned}} from the Battle of Red Cliffs, he met Zhang Fan in Chen Commandery (陳郡; around present-day Huaiyang County, Henan) and appointed him as a Consultant (議郎) and Army Adviser (參軍). Cao Cao highly regarded Zhang Fan and treated him respectfully. When he went on military campaigns against rival warlords, he often left Zhang Fan and Bing Yuan behind to guard his base together with his son and heir apparent, Cao Pi. He also once told Cao Pi, [...] "You should consult these two men <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> anything." [...] Cao Pi heeded his father's advice and treated {{them as if they}} were the elders of his family.|$|E

2500|$|On 9 March 2005, Crowe {{revealed}} to GQ magazine that Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents had approached him {{prior to the}} 73rd Academy Awards in March 2001, {{and told him that}} the terrorist group al-Qaeda wanted to kidnap him. Crowe told the magazine that {{it was the first time}} he had ever heard of al-Qaeda and was quoted as saying: [...] "You get this late-night call from the FBI when you arrive in Los Angeles, and they're, like, absolutely full-on. 'We've got to talk to you now <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> anything. We have to have a discussion with you, Mr. Crowe.'" [...] Crowe recalled that: [...] "It was something to do with some recording picked up by a French policewoman, I think, in either Libya or Algiers...it was about taking iconographic Americans out of the picture as a sort of cultural destabilisation plan." ...|$|E

50|$|These adjunct clauses {{modify the}} entire matrix clause. Thus <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> {{in the first}} example modifies the matrix clause Fred arrived.

6000|$|... 'I {{shall have}} fine honey for you, Miss, this year,' {{said the old}} nurse. 'Are you fond of honey, sir? Our honey is well known about.

And just as I had got {{to the bottom of the}} stairs, and was a-going into my poor dear mistress's room, said you (I never shall forget it), said you, [...] "Honey, honey, nurse."
