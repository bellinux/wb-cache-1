5|$|Meanwhile, {{finding a}} {{suitable}} adhesive {{was a significant}} problem. After unsuccessful experiments {{with a variety of}} candidates, somebody suggested birdlime – a viscous sticky compound used since ancient times to trap birds by spreading it on tree branches and waiting for birds to get stuck. Birdlime performed <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> previously tested, but it was still not good enough. Macrae's tin of birdlime was labelled with a large letter 'K' and an indication that tin came from Stockport but with no more clues as to the manufacturer. Macrae got on a train to Stockport and there found a helpful taxi driver who took him to Kay Brothers Ltd. The company's Chief Chemist was soon working on the problem of a suitable adhesive and within a matter of weeks the problem was solved to Macrae's satisfaction.|$|E
25|$|Crosby had {{launched}} {{the tape recorder}} revolution in America. In his 1950 film Mr. Music, Crosby is seen singing {{into one of the}} new Ampex tape recorders that reproduced his voice <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> else. Also quick to adopt tape recording was his friend Bob Hope. He gave one of the first Ampex Model 300 recorders to his friend, musician Les Paul, which led directly to Paul's invention of multitrack recording. His organization, the Crosby Research Foundation, also held various tape recording patents and developed equipment and recording techniques such as the laugh track that are still in use today.|$|E
25|$|Since Burgundy is land-locked, {{very little}} of its wine left the region in Medieval times, when wine was transported in barrels, meaning that {{waterways}} provided the only practical means of long-range transportation. The only part of Burgundy which could reach Paris in a practical way was the area around Auxerre {{by means of the}} Yonne. This area includes Chablis, but had much more extensive vineyards until the 19th century. These were the wines referred to as vin de Bourgogne in early texts. The wines from Côte d'Or would then be called (vin de) Beaune. These wines first became famous in the 14th century, during the Babylonian Captivity of the Papacy in Avignon, which was reachable by Saône and Rhône after some overland transport. In the extravagance of the papal court, Beaune was generally seen as the finest wine, and <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> available in Rome at that time.|$|E

500|$|Bowen {{then started}} looking for a {{suitable}} receiver system, and immediately had a stroke of good luck; EMI had recently constructed a prototype receiver for the experimental BBC television broadcasts on 6.7m wavelength (45MHz).

Puppets from the Thunderbirds television series were therefore expertly revamped, with new paint, wigs and costumes, while models and sets such as the Thunderbird machines were re-built from scratch with greater attention to detail. During production, the AP Films puppet wardrobe had a stock of over 700 costumes, with 150 extra costumes made mainly as spares in case of damage or loss.|$|E
500|$|The lyrics {{written by}} the band's singer Rod Evans are very {{functional}} to {{the music and the}} marketing Deep Purple's record label was building up for the American hippie audience. Evans took inspiration for the fantasy-themed [...] "Listen, Learn, Read On", which contains lyrical reference to the album's title, from the 14th-century Welsh manuscript Book of Taliesin, a collection of poems attributed to the 6th-century poet Taliesin. [...] The title and cover art of the album were also inspired by the manuscript. Instead psychedelia and its rituals play a large part in the lyrics of [...] "Shield".

500|$|MacPaint {{was first}} advertised in an 18-page {{brochure}} in December 1983, following the earlier {{announcement of the}} Macintosh 128K. The Macintosh was released on January 24, 1984 with two applications, MacPaint and MacWrite. For a special post-election edition of Newsweek in November 1984, Apple spent more than US$2.5 million to buy all 39 of the advertising pages in the issue. The Newsweek advertisement included many pages dedicated to explaining how MacWrite and MacPaint worked together. After launch, a New York Times reviewer noted how MacPaint unfolded numerous graphic possibilities for the personal computer; he went further to say [...] "it is <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> else of its kind offered on personal computers {{by a factor of}} 10." ...|$|E

SFScope writer Sarah Stegall lauded the premise of multiple universes, and called the episode's horror elements the reason she is now [...] "a devoted fan of this show". Stegall also praised Kirk Acevedo's performance {{as well as the}} parallels between Andrea Hughes and Walter; she concluded [...] "This may have been the best episode of this entire series, second perhaps to last season's finale, and certainly <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> the anemic Grey's Anatomy or the aging CSI can offer".|$|E

"Slow Life" [...] itself {{received}} generally positive reviews; Pitchfork Media {{called it}} a [...] "stunning closer" [...] to Phantom Power, while PopMatters described the song as [...] "the kind of schizophrenic fun we've come to expect from the band but ... less showy and eager to please, as they control themselves {{enough to make the}} jarring, contradicting styles much easier to digest". Stylus Magazine stated that the [...] "great" [...] track [...] "achieves symbiosis between techno and guitar-pop <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> else they've done before". The BBC agreed calling [...] "Slow Life" [...] the band's [...] "most successful mindrattling techno attempt so far".

Bain also added that it was [...] "refreshing" [...] to hear Hudson [...] "in a euphoric party mood after her more low-key offerings from her last album, I Remember Me."

500|$|Original [...] "Tribbles" [...] creator David Gerrold was {{contacted}} by The New York Times, {{who wanted to}} interview him about the anniversary and the rumored [...] "tribbles" [...] episode. When he questioned Berman about the episode, Berman initially denied it. [...] Gerrold responded that he didn't want to embarrass anyone, but {{would like to be}} able to endorse the project. [...] Berman asked what the endorsement would cost, to which Gerrold requested public acknowledgement of his work and to be cast as an extra in the episode. [...] Berman agreed. Gerrold compared inserting new footage into an existing episode to Back to the Future Part II (1989) and later said that he would have gone in a different direction had he written the story. [...] Nonetheless, he felt the final product ended up being <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> he would have created.|$|E
500|$|Other reviews were mixed. Pitchfork Media's Tom Breihan {{wrote that}} [...] "Keith himself is {{responsible}} {{for all of the}} album's good moments.

And so the album's best song is [...] "Ants," [...] where he comes off frantic but omnipotent...It's dense and fascinating stuff, a tantalizing glimpse of what might've happened if Keith hadn't treated the reemergence of his most popular persona like an easy payday." [...] PopMatters writer Michael Frauenhofer wrote that [...] "The Return of Dr. Octagon is still <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> Kool Keith's done in a little while, but apart from its best tracks, it's not close to the level of his finest work of the past, and it doesn't really build much on the legend of Dr. Octagon, which still rests most firmly on the good doctor's debut." ...|$|E
500|$|Music critics {{commented on}} the {{freestyle}} rap. Ray Roa of music website Consequence of Sound noted Eminem's obvious frustration in the song, saying that he [...] "sounds pissed off as ever on a new freestyle". He also added, [...] "The first {{minute and a half}} of the track is mellow by his standards, but when the beat switches to Banks’ track, Eminem goes apeshit." [...] Melinda Newman of HitFix gave a positive review and wrote that the freestyle sounds like a [...] "blast that sucks all the air out of room. It's <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> on Relapse, and the sheer dexterity of his rhyming skills is awe-inspiring." [...] Thaindian Newss Madhuri Dey felt that [...] "Eminem takes his usual route of taking a hit at some personality". Adam Downer of Sputnikmusic wrote positively: [...] "Eminem spits with the crazed desperation we remember from the albums." ...|$|E

500|$|Greg Kot {{was less}} {{enthusiastic}} in the Chicago Tribune, deeming The Chronic superficial, unrefined entertainment, while writing that [...] "Dre combines street potency with thuggish stupidity in equal measure." [...] Village Voice critic Robert Christgau dismissed it as [...] "sociopathic easy-listening" [...] and [...] "bad pop music" [...] whose innovation—Dre's departure from sampling—is not inspired by contemporary P-Funk, but rather blaxploitation soundtracks. He {{felt that the}} brutal lyrical threats were vague and lacked detail, although he found Snoop Dogg's rhymes [...] "" [...] and not dull, unlike Dr. Dre. Selects Adam Higginbotham opined that The Chronic was {{not as strong as}} releases from other gangster rap artists such as Ice Cube and Da Lench Mob and found it neither as [...] "musically sharp, nor as lyrically smart as the latter". His review concluded that the album sounded like [...] "all the pedestrian bits from The Predator", but that it was still <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> Eazy-E had released.|$|E
500|$|Douglas Murray of The Daily Telegraph {{said of the}} episode, [...] "I can't {{recommend}} it enough", and particularly complimented the episode scenes with Buddha snorting cocaine and the South Park townspeople hiding Muhammad. Murray said, [...] "They make the point about the absurd self-censorship and thuggish intimidation surrounding the Islamic faith <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> else I've seen." [...] Amy Duncan of Metro said it [...] "certainly was an episode to remember". Duncan praised the story, which she said [...] "develops with [...] usual rude inferences and below-the-belt remarks". Ryan Broderick of The Hofstra Chronicle said the episode [...] "came together so simply, so smoothly, and so hilariously that it forgives the last couple lame duck episodes of the season". Broderick said it avoided the pitfalls of most landmark episodes by providing an original story {{in addition to the}} throwback references. Nick Zaino of TV Squad said the episode did not offer much new, but also offer good throwbacks and celebrity spoofs, and didn't [...] "pull any punches". Zaino said the episode has [...] "a wonderful sense of the absurd", particularly through the use of Mecha-Streisand and Cartman's hand-puppet.|$|E
