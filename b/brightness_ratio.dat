[...] While it is the most eccentric of the Uranian rings, it has negligible orbital inclination. The ring's eccentricity causes its brightness to vary over the course of its orbit. The radially integrated brightness of the ε ring is highest near apoapsis and lowest near periapsis. The maximum/minimum <b>brightness</b> <b>ratio</b> is about 2.5–3.0. These variations are connected with the variations of the ring width, which is 19.7km at the periapsis and 96.4km at the apoapsis. As the ring becomes wider, the amount of shadowing between particles decreases and more of them come into view, leading to higher integrated brightness. The width variations were measured directly from Voyager 2 images, as the ε ring was one of only two rings resolved by Voyager’s cameras. Such behavior indicates that the ring is not optically thin. Indeed, occultation observations conducted from the ground and the spacecraft showed that its normal optical depth varies between 0.5 and 2.5, being highest near the periapsis. The equivalent depth of the ε ring is around 47km and is invariant around the orbit.|$|E

Although the average location of sunspot eruption moves equatorward throughout the solar cycle, the northern hemisphere shows darker umbrae located systematically closer to the equator, while brighter umbrae are found at higher latitudes. These findings confirm the results of simulations that show strong flux emerging radially while weak flux emerges nonradially, causing weak flux to emerge poleward of its original toroidal field position. The average umbral intensity decreased in the north through the solar cycle, reaching a minimum intensity around sunspot maximum, possible evidence of the toroidal field strength peaking at solar maximum.
