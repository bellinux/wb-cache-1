5000|$|Because it {{involves}} a moving <b>balanced</b> <b>surface,</b> a stabilator can allow the pilot to generate a given pitching moment with a lower control force. Due to the high forces involved in tail balancing loads, stabilators are designed to pivot about their aerodynamic center (near the tail's mean quarter-chord). This is {{the point at which}} the pitching moment is constant regardless of the angle of attack, and thus any movement of the stabilator can be made without added pilot effort. However, to be certified by the appropriate regulatory agency [...] an airplane must show an increasing resistance to an increasing pilot input (movement). To provide this resistance, stabilators on small aircraft contain an anti-servo tab (usually acting also as a trim tab) that deflects in the same direction as the stabilator, thus providing an aerodynamic force resisting the pilot's input. General aviation aircraft with stabilators include the Piper Cherokee and the Cessna 177.|$|E

In 2003 the South Aral Sea itself split into eastern and western basins, the Eastern Sea and the West Aral Sea, connected by a narrow channel (channel bed at an elevation of 29 m) that <b>balanced</b> <b>surface</b> levels but did not allow mixing, and in 2005 the North Aral Sea was dammed to prevent the collapse of its fisheries, cutting off the only remaining inflow to the southern lakes. In 2008 the Eastern Sea split again, and in May 2009 had almost completely dried out, leaving only the small permanent Barsakelmes Lake between the Northern and Western Seas and increasing the expanse of the Aralkum desert. In 2010, it was partially filled again by meltwater, and by 2014 was once again dry. The West Aral Sea has some replenishment from groundwater in the northwest, and so is likely to avoid desiccation.|$|E

Then the structural design of balanced SAW filters is formulated as a function optimization problem that aims to improve their balance characteristics and satisfy specifications for filter characteristics.

40|$|Abstract: A multi-objective optimum design {{method of}} the <b>balanced</b> <b>Surface</b> Acoustic Wave (SAW) filter is pro-posed. The {{frequency}} response {{characteristics of the}} balanced SAW filters are governed primarily by their geo-metrical structures. Besides, specifications for a balanced SAW filter is given by using several criteria. Therefore, in order to realize desirable frequency response characteristics, the structural design of the balanced SAW filter is formulated as a constrained multi-objective optimization problem. Then a recent Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization (EMO) algorithm, which is called Generalized Differential Evolution 3 (GED 3), {{is applied to the}} multi-objective optimization problem. Furthermore, in order to clarify the tradeoff relationship among the ob-jective functions of the multi-objective optimization problem, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to assess the set of the non-dominated solutions obtained by GDE 3. Finally, the proposed optimum design method is demonstrated in the three- and the two-objective optimum design problems of a practical balanced SAW filter.

40|$|Polylactide (PLA), as an {{emerging}} biodegradable thermoplastic material derived from renewable resources, has attracted increasing research interest {{due to its}} biodegradability and biocompatibility. PLA containing block copolymers further diversify its application in the biomedical field, commodity materials, and even advanced nanoporous materials. ^ This thesis focuses on the fundamental aspects of morphology and phase behaviors of PLA-containing block copolymers, {{as well as their}} stereocomplex blends formed by blending incompatible enantiomeric PLA block copolymers. The work consists of two parts. First, using living ring-opening polymerization of L- and D-lactides (PLLA and PDLA), well-defined enantiomeric PLA block copolymers were synthesized from hydroxyl-terminated hydrophilic poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and hydrophobic poly(ethylene-co- 1, 2 -butylene) (PEB) precursor polymers, respectively. Research effort was devoted to controlling the molecular weight of each block and narrow polydispersity. Quantitative stereocomplex formation was achieved by equimolar mixing of incompatible PEO- b-PLLA and PEB-b-PDLA. ^ Second, the morphology and phase behaviors of diblock copolymers and their stereocomplex blends were studied by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in both molten and crystalline states. In the stereocomplex systems, polymer brushes formed with PLLA/PDLA stereocomplex crystals as the substrate and PEO and PEB as the brushes. We were able to generate either balanced or unbalanced surface stresses on opposite sides of a stereocomplex crystal due to the crowded PEO and PEB brushes by changing the molecular weight of each block. When <b>balanced</b> <b>surface</b> stresses were generated, flat lamellar structure formed in both molten and crystalline states. Interestingly, if unbalanced surface stresses were generated, curved microstructures were found, and the detailed morphology depended on the molecular weights of PLLA/PDLA. A novel honeycomb structure with hexagonal cylinders being 2 / 3 of the volume fraction was achieved in the melt state when the PLLA/PDLA molecular weights were only 5, 000 g/mol. Onion-like morphology was obtained in both the melt and crystalline states when the PLLA/PDLA molecular weights exceeded 10, 000 g/mol. The detailed structures such as solid versus 2 ̆ 2 hollow 2 ̆ 2 onions were further controlled by the PLLA/PDLA molecular weights. Based on the SAXS and TEM results, tentative models were proposed to explain these novel structures. ...|$|E

The theoretical part summarized the findings about the diaphragm and its postural stabilizing function, about the connection between breathing and postural control as well as about the influence of body position on respiratory muscle strength.

This topic is of key importance for the optimization of the machine efficiency because it both influences the mechanical-viscous friction and the volumetric losses. In this paper the intent is to investigate {{the role of the}} elastic deformation of the bushes surfaces, to compare the analysis done with rigid and elastic surfaces and finally to correlate the results with the design of the bushes <b>balancing</b> <b>surfaces.</b> A numerical procedure for the determination of the pressure distribution inside the gap bounded by gears sides and the bushes internal surfaces is presented and applied.

It is shown that, when the design of the bushes rear surfaces determines a strong balancing thrust, the bushes themselves need to tilt strongly with respect to the gears to generate an opportune widening thrust to avoiding contact with the gears.
