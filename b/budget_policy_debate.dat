40|$|CEMAC countries, with an aim of {{coordinating}} their <b>budget</b> <b>policies,</b> established {{within their}} union some rules {{of economic policy}} which seem to be restrictive for an effective <b>budget</b> <b>policy</b> and thus sustainable in the long run. Indeed, in the economic theory, several arguments were advanced to justify the effectiveness of <b>budget</b> <b>policy</b> {{with a view to}} stabilization. For some, expansionist <b>budget</b> <b>policies</b> can have favorable effects on the economic activity, while for others, this kind of policy does not have any effect and can even be harmful for the activity; it would be then in this case more adapted to follow a contractionnist policy. Nevertheless, these two effects can coexist on the activity, thus putting forward the nonlinear character of <b>budget</b> <b>policy</b> on the activity. The objective of this study is thus to appreciate the nature of the relation between <b>budget</b> <b>policy</b> and the activity in CEMAC by taking of account the existence of possible nonlinear effects of the <b>budget</b> <b>policy.</b> For that, we initially test the stationnarity of the debt on GDP ratio of the countries in the zone over the period 1970 - 2006 and thus conclude that, <b>budget</b> <b>policies</b> of the countries in CEMAC zone were not sustainable and thus ineffective. In the second time, the methodology of endogenous thresholds of Hansen (1996, 1999) made it possible to determine a rate of debt of 79 % of the GDP, below which the expansionist policies have favorable effects on the activity, and with the top of which contractionnists policies become effective. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – Even though leaders {{often are}} seen as {{responsible}} guides, they sometimes behave in a self-serving way, for example, by spending the company’s budget on their own, frivolous needs. In this study, the authors explore an aspect of such behavior: the authors examine how an organizational <b>budget</b> <b>policy</b> makes such spending more legitimate {{in the eyes of}} followers. Specifically, the authors examine when followers will react to a leader’s self-serving behavior as a function of: the role of organizational <b>budget</b> <b>policies,</b> and whether followers are directly affected by the leader’s behavior. The authors test two particular <b>budget</b> <b>policies,</b> i. e. carry-forward vs non-carry-forward (a. k. a., “use-it-or-lose-it” <b>budget</b> <b>policies),</b> which differ on whether a department/team’s allocations not spent {{by the end of the}} fiscal year flow back to the central administration. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – Study 1 is a multi-source field study that should enhance the external validity of the results. Study 1 was analyzed with regression analyses and bootstrapping techniques. To be able to draw causal inferences, the authors also conducted an experimental study (Study 2). Findings – Followers react more negatively – by showing increased turnover intentions and decreased commitment and cooperation – to a leader’s self-serving behavior in a carry-forward policy than in a use-it-or-lose-it <b>budget</b> <b>policy.</b> Thus, organizational policies, such as the <b>budget</b> <b>policy,</b> affect how followers react to self-serving leaders. Originality/value – The authors focus on self-serving leader behavior. The authors show that followers’ reactions to self-serving leaders are not necessarily negative and are influenced by the specific organizational context in which the self-serving behavior occurs. More specifically, the authors add to the literature by introducing <b>budget</b> <b>policies</b> as influencing followers’ reactions to leaders’ behavior. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Indonesia {{is facing}} serious {{problems}} related to unsustainable land and forest governance, resulting in large scale deforestation and forest degradation. <b>Budgets</b> and <b>budget</b> <b>policies</b> are important elements of land and forest governance, critical to ensuring the implementation of development plans and addressing deforestation and degradation problems. Good <b>budget</b> <b>policy</b> requires performance targets supported by budget availability and strict controls to measure implementation, specifically related to (i) rehabilitation and preventing deforestation; (ii) controlling land exploitation; (iii) optimizing plantation productivity; (iv) preventing the clearing of more land for plantations. The Indonesian Forum for Budget Transparency (Seknas FITRA) conducted a study analyzing national <b>budget</b> and planning <b>policies</b> on land and forest governance in Indonesia. The study aimed to assess central government performance on budgeting, including commitment to <b>budget</b> <b>policies</b> and the resulting expenditure related to forest and land governance. Specifically, the study looked at two issues: the priority policies or plans by the central government related to land and forest governance as well as progress of achievements; and the orientation of national <b>budget</b> <b>policy</b> toward reducing deforestation and degradation...|$|R

5000|$|Though {{established}} {{as an alternative}} to <b>policy</b> <b>debate,</b> there has been a strong movement to embrace certain techniques that originated in <b>policy</b> <b>debate</b> (and, correspondingly, a strong backlash movement). Plans, counterplans, critical theory, postmodern theory, debate about the theoretical basis and rules of the activity itself, and critics have all reached more than occasional, if not yet universal, usage. Traditional L-D debate attempts to be free of <b>policy</b> <b>debate</b> [...] "jargon". Lincoln-Douglas speeches can range from a conversational pace to well over 300 words per minute (when trying to maximize the number of arguments and depth of each argument's development). This technique is known as spreading. There is also a growing emphasis on carded evidence, though still much less than in <b>policy</b> <b>debate.</b> These trends have created a serious rift within the activity between the debaters, judges, and coaches who advocate or accept these changes, and those who vehemently oppose them.|$|R
