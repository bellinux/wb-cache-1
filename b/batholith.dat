5|$|A major {{geological}} {{structure in}} the region is the Northern Patagonian <b>Batholith.</b> This structure, formed by plutonic rocks including granodiorite and tonalite, is crossed north-south by the Liquiñe-Ofqui fault zone and surrounded by metamorphic rocks west and volcanic rocks east of the <b>batholith.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Basin area is {{underlain}} by {{the quartz}} monzonite of the Boulder <b>Batholith.</b> The <b>batholith</b> is overlain by dacite from the Paleogene and Neogene periods (roughly 66million to 1.8million years ago) and andesite {{from the late}} Cretaceous. The andesite and monzonite are cut by dikes of dacite and rhyolite.|$|E
5|$|The {{mountains}} of Sawtooth National Forest have a varied geological history. The northern Sawtooth Mountains formed from the Eocene Sawtooth <b>batholith,</b> while south of Alturas Lake the Sawtooth, Smoky, and Soldier mountains formed from the Cretaceous granodiorite of the Idaho <b>Batholith.</b> Foothills of the Smoky Mountains {{are from the}} Pennsylvanian and Permian Dollarhide formations. The White Cloud Mountains are underlain by the gray granodiorite of the Idaho <b>batholith,</b> {{while some of the}} exposed rock is baked impure limestone from the Permian Grand Prize Formation.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{a compilation of}} recent U-Pb (zircon) ages of late Carboniferous–early Permian (LC–EP) calc-alkaline <b>batholiths</b> from Iberia, together with a petrogenetic interpretation of magma generation based on comparisons with Mesozoic and Tertiary Cordilleran <b>batholiths</b> and experimental melts. Zircon U-Pb ages distributed over the range ca. 315 – 280  Ma, indicate a linkage between calc-alkaline magmatism, Iberian orocline generation and Paleotethys subduction. It is also shown that Iberian LC–EP calc-alkaline <b>batholiths</b> present unequivocal subduction-related features comparable with typical Cordilleran <b>batholiths</b> of the Pacific Americas active margin, although geochemical features were partially obscured by local modifications of magmas {{at the level of}} emplacement by country rock assimilation. When and how LC–EP calc-alkaline <b>batholiths</b> formed in Iberia is then discussed, and a new and somewhat controversial interpretation for their sources and tectonic setting (plume-assisted relamination) is suggested. The <b>batholiths</b> are proposed to have formed during the subduction of the Paleotethys oceanic plate (Pangaea self-subduction) and, consequently, they are unrelated to Variscan collision. The origin of the Iberian <b>batholiths</b> is related to the Eurasian active margin and probably represents the inception of a Paleotethyan arc in the core of Pangaea...|$|R

About 5% of the park's landforms (mostly in its eastern margin near Mount Dana) are metamorphosed volcanic and sedimentary rocks. These rocks are called roof pendants because they were once {{the roof of the}} underlying granitic rock.|$|E

5|$|The Wabigoon subprovince is a {{formerly}} active volcanic island chain, {{made up of}} metavolcanic-metasedimentary intrusions. These metamorphosed {{rocks are}} volcanically derived greenstone belts, and are surrounded and cut by granitic plutons and <b>batholiths.</b> The subprovince's greenstone belts consist of felsic volcanics, felsic <b>batholiths</b> and felsic plutons aged from 3,000 to 2,670 million years old.|$|R
5|$|The rocks contain phenocrysts of clinopyroxene, {{hornblende}} and plagioclase. In {{terms of}} composition, the Fueguino rocks {{belong to the}} calc-alkaline series and resemble tholeiites and andesites from primitive volcanic arcs. Xenoliths from the Patagonian <b>batholith</b> are also found.|$|E
5|$|This {{model has}} Siletzia forming on the {{continental}} margin along {{what is now}} the Olympic-Wallowa Lineament (OWL; a zone of topographical features of unknown age and tectonic significance), with the southern end of Siletzia and the Klamath Mountains (joined to Siletzia) near the Idaho <b>Batholith</b> in central Idaho. Further evidence for this comes from the sand of the Tyee Formation that overlie the Roseburg Formation. Not only does this sand have the same isotopic composition of rock in the Idaho <b>Batholith</b> (and of sand now coursing down the Snake and Columbia Rivers), but it appears to have not been transported very far from its source. This implies that the Tyee Formation was much closer to the Idaho <b>Batholith</b> when it was deposited, and subsequently rotated away. Geodetic surveys show that the region continues to rotate, likely as a result of extension of the Basin and Range Province and asthenospheric flow around the southern edge of the subducting Juan de Fuca plate.|$|E
5|$|Nepenthes rajah {{has a very}} {{localised}} distribution, being {{restricted to}} Mount Kinabalu and neighbouring Mount Tambuyukon, both located in Kinabalu National Park, Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. Mount Kinabalu is a massive granitic dome structure that is geologically young and formed from the intrusion and uplift of a granitic <b>batholith.</b> At 4095.2m, it {{is by far the}} tallest mountain on the island of Borneo and one of the highest peaks in Southeast Asia. The lower slopes of the mountain are mainly composed of sandstone and shale, transformed from marine sand and mud about 35 million years ago. Intrusive ultramafic (serpentine) rock was uplifted with the core of the <b>batholith</b> and forms a collar around the mountain. It is on these ultramafic soils that the flora of Mount Kinabalu exhibits the greatest levels of endemicity and many of the area's rarest species can be found here.|$|E

50|$|The ancient {{metamorphic}} {{and more}} recent sedimentary layers above the <b>batholiths</b> eroded {{away as the}} magma pushed up through the crust. Thus, the granite <b>batholiths</b> are typically found {{at the center of}} local mountain ranges, while the much older metamorphic gneiss is usually found lower in the mountains, and limestone layers are mostly found in the foothills nearest the Jefferson River.|$|R
5000|$|In geology, a {{stock is}} a {{discordant}} igneous intrusion having a surface exposure {{of less than}} 40 mi2 km2, differing from <b>batholiths</b> only in being smaller. The term stock usually refers to individual, relatively small plutons (<20 km diameter), usually in relative isolation. Most stocks are probably the cupolas of hidden <b>batholiths.</b> Circular or elliptical stocks may have been vents feeding former volcanoes.|$|R
5|$|As Siletzia accreted it also {{jammed the}} {{existing}} subduction zone, halting subduction of the Farallon plate. This terminated the Laramide orogeny {{that had been}} uplifting the Rocky Mountains, and triggered the ignimbrite sweep, a wave of large-volume silicic magmatism that swept over much of western North America between 50 and 20 Ma. This undoubtedly affected the enigmatic and controversial Challis Arc (stretching from southeastern British Columbia to the Idaho <b>Batholith,</b> roughly parallel with the Olympic-Wallowa Lineament), but {{the details of this}} are unknown.|$|E
5|$|Basin rests {{above the}} Boulder <b>Batholith,</b> the host rock for many {{valuable}} mineral ores {{found in this}} part of Montana. After the town became a hub of gold and silver mining, Basin's population peaked at about 1,500 in first decade of the 20th century but gradually declined as the mines were depleted. Abandoned mining equipment, closed or barricaded mine portals, and the ruins of a smelter and ore concentrator remain in Basin in the 21stcentury.|$|E
5|$|Compressive forces {{built up}} along {{the entire length of}} the broad {{continental}} shelf. The Sierran Arc, also called the Cordilleran Mesozoic magmatic arc, started to form from heat and pressure generated from the subduction. Compressive forces caused thrust faults to develop and granitic blobs of magma called plutons to rise in the Death Valley region and beyond, most notably creating the Sierra Nevada <b>Batholith</b> to the west. Thrust faulting was so severe that the continental shelf was shortened and some parts of older formations were moved on top of younger rock units.|$|E
50|$|Intrusions vary widely, from mountain-range-sized <b>batholiths</b> to thin veinlike {{fracture}} fillings of aplite or pegmatite.|$|R
50|$|These {{are formed}} where magma pushes between {{existing}} rock, intrusions {{can be in}} the form of <b>batholiths,</b> dikes, sills and layered intrusions.|$|R
50|$|Intrusive rock (also called {{plutonic}} rock) {{is formed}} when magma crystallizes and solidifies underground to form intrusions, for example plutons, <b>batholiths,</b> dikes, sills, laccoliths, and volcanic necks.|$|R
5|$|Heat {{generated}} from the Farallon Plate subducting below the North American Plate {{led to the creation}} of an island arc of volcanoes on the west coast of proto-North America between the late Devonian and Permian periods. Later volcanism in the Jurassic intruded and covered these rocks in what may have been magmatic activity associated with the early stages of the creation of the Sierra Nevada <b>Batholith.</b> 95% of these rocks were eventually removed by uplifted-accelerated erosion.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{activity}} at the Marysvale volcanic field occurred during three separate intervals; ~3422mya, 2214mya and 95mya. Dacites and andesites were erupted above an evolving <b>batholith</b> in the first interval. Crystal-rich ash from the 27-million-year-old (myo) Three Creeks caldera, 24myo Big John caldera and 23myo Monroe Peak caldera hardened into tuff. The second and third intervals saw eruptions of great quantities of rhyolites. Alkali-rich rhyolite erupted in the second interval from the 19myo Mount Belknap caldera.|$|E
5|$|On the Olympic Peninsula the Blue Mountain unit at {{the base}} of the Crescent Formation {{includes}} sediments (including large boulders of quartz diorite) of continental origin, showing that the continent was close by; other sediments were eroded from the pre-Cenozoic rock of Vancouver Island and the northern Cascade Range. At the southern end are sediments derived from the Klamath Mountains, while sand of the overlying Tyee Formation has an isotopic composition corresponding to rock of the Idaho <b>Batholith.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In geology, a pluton {{is a body}} of {{intrusive}} {{igneous rock}} (called a plutonic rock) that is crystallized from magma slowly cooling {{below the surface of}} the Earth. Plutons include <b>batholiths,</b> stocks, dikes, sills, laccoliths, lopoliths, and other igneous bodies. In practice, [...] "pluton" [...] usually refers to a distinctive mass of igneous rock, typically several kilometers in dimension, without a tabular shape like those of dikes and sills. <b>Batholiths</b> commonly are aggregations of plutons. Examples of plutons include Denali, Cuillin, Cardinal Peak, Mount Kinabalu and Stone Mountain.|$|R
40|$|The {{measurement}} of the anisotropy of the magnetic susceptibility (AMS) is now routinely used since {{more than four decades}} in the analyses of rock fabrics in granitic rocks (e. g. Stacy 1960, Henry 1975, Gleizes et al. 1993). Even though the intensity of fabrics in granitoids is often weakly developed the significance of orientation and shape of crystals is the same like in other deformed rock types. By revealing the distribution of fabrics in plutonic rocks one of the still ongoing discussions in granite tectonics may be addressed: How did those sometimes voluminous <b>batholiths</b> were inflated in the middle crust? We are presenting magnetic fabric data on a series of Devonian <b>batholiths</b> that intruded the polyphase deformed metaclastites of the Sierra de San Luis (32 ° 100 – 33 ° 200 S / 65 ° 150 – 66 ° 200 W) in central Argentina. Regional considerations on the tectonic regime during the emplacement of the <b>batholiths</b> are inferred from combined field, microstructural and AMS observations [...] ...|$|R
25|$|The central cores {{of major}} {{mountain}} ranges consist of intrusive igneous rocks, usually granite. When exposed by erosion, these cores (called <b>batholiths)</b> may occupy huge {{areas of the}} Earth's surface.|$|R
5|$|The flank vents have erupted {{andesite}} and dacite, {{belonging to}} a potassium-poor calcalkaline series. Such a limited range of composition is typical for these volcanoes but might reflect {{the small amount of}} research conducted on them. Tephras of rhyolitic composition were generated by Monte Burney during the Pleistocene, according to compositional data. Holocene eruptions have near-identical composition. Minerals found in Burney rocks include amphibole, plagioclase and pyroxene; foreign components include clinopyroxene and olivine crystals as well as granite xenoliths stemming from the Patagonian <b>batholith.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{interior}} of the northern half of the island is taken up by a large granite <b>batholith</b> that was created by substantial magmatic activity around 58 million years ago in the Paleogene period. This comprises an outer ring of coarse granite and an inner core of finer grained granite, which was intruded later. This granite was intruded into the Late Proterozoic to Cambrian metasediments of the Dalradian Supergroup. Other Paleogene igneous rocks on Arran include extensive felsic and composite sills in the south of the island, and the central ring complex, an eroded caldera system surrounded by a near-continuous ring of granitic rocks.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the oldest}} rocks in Oregon, {{some of the}} {{formations}} in these terranes date to the Triassic, nearly 250million years ago. Between 165 and 170million years ago, in the Jurassic, faulting consolidated the Klamath terranes offshore during what geologists call the Siskiyou orogeny. This three- to five-million-year episode of intense tectonic activity pushed sedimentary rocks deep enough into the mantle to melt them and then forced them to the surface as granitic plutons. Belts of plutons, which contain gold and other precious metals, run through the Klamaths and include the Ashland pluton, the Grayback <b>batholith</b> east of Oregon Caves National Monument, the Grants Pass pluton, the Gold Hill pluton, the Jacksonville pluton, and others. Miners have worked rich deposits of gold, silver, copper, nickel, and other metals in several districts of the Klamaths. Placer mining in the mid-19thcentury soon led to lode mining for gold. Aside from a mine in eastern Oregon, the Greenback Mine along Grave Creek, a Rogue tributary, was the most productive gold mine in Oregon.|$|E
