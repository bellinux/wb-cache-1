25|$|Latte {{stones are}} stone pillars {{that are found}} only in the Mariana Islands; they are a recent {{development}} in Pre-Contact Chamorro society. The latte-stone {{was used as a}} foundation on which thatched huts were built. Latte stones consist of a base shaped from limestone called the haligi and with a capstone, or tåsa, made either from a large <b>brain</b> <b>coral</b> or limestone, placed on top. A possible source for these stones, the Rota Latte Stone Quarry, was discovered in 1925 on Rota.|$|E
500|$|Beyond {{the keys}} in the Atlantic Ocean the {{seafloor}} slopes gradually down before rising in an almost continuous coral reef. The reef, composed of living corals, is inhabited by more than 200 species of fish, as well as molluscs, crustaceans and worms. Every coral species in park waters is considered protected by either federal or state regulations. Coral reefs are estimated to cover about half {{the area of the}} park, with about 4000 individual patch reefs and areas of bank-barrier reef. Hundreds of species of hard and soft corals, sea anemones and sponges are found in bay and offshore waters. The coral reefs may themselves be subdivided into the outer reef {{on the edge of the}} Florida carbonate platform, the patch reefs between the outer reef and the keys, and the reefs in the shoals on either side of the keys. The offshore reefs are dominated by elkhorn coral to [...] water depth, and staghorn coral below 10 meters. The landward patch reefs are principally composed of boulder star coral and symmetrical <b>brain</b> <b>coral.</b> The island shoal reefs mainly consist of lesser starlet coral and Porites finger corals.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are many}} kinds of coral located off the shores of Gibney beach, including: <b>brain</b> <b>coral,</b> elkhorn, staghorn, boulder coral and fire coral. [...] These coral reefs are {{colorful}} and contain a variety of fish and other aquatic creatures. [...] Atop these large coral bodies sit sea fans, sea whips and sea plumes. [...] Coral animals like star coral, <b>brain</b> <b>coral,</b> coral polyps, and pillar coral can be seen extending their tentacles at night.|$|E
50|$|Open <b>brain</b> <b>corals</b> come in {{a variety}} of colors but the colors most {{commonly}} found in the aquarium industry are the fluoresce blue, green, red, and opaque. In these captive environments, open <b>brain</b> <b>corals</b> usually grow to approximately eight inches in diameter.|$|R
50|$|The open <b>brain</b> <b>corals,</b> Trachyphyllia geoffroyi, {{are just}} one of {{thousands}} of classifications of coral. They are named as such due to their resemblance to an inverted animal brain as seen by the human eye. As the name also suggests, the open <b>brain</b> <b>corals</b> are related to the many other species of <b>brain</b> <b>corals</b> found in shallow warm-water coral reefs in all the world's oceans. The different specific sub-species come in an array of colors ranging from opaque, blue, green, red, pink and brown.|$|R
50|$|Although {{specific}} {{species of}} open <b>brain</b> <b>corals</b> {{can be found}} in all of the world's oceans, they are predominantly found in the Indian Ocean including the Red Sea, and throughout the coastal waters of Australia. The sediment types that the open <b>brain</b> <b>corals</b> thrive on are sandy to silty bottoms.|$|R

50|$|Leptoria is a genus of {{stony corals}} in the Merulinidae family.

50|$|Open <b>brain</b> <b>corals</b> are nocturnal feeders {{and extend}} their {{stinging}} tentacles {{only in the}} evening and night hours. They do so to filter zooplankton, phytoplankton and any small organism that swims in the surrounding water to feed upon. Open <b>brain</b> <b>corals</b> are able to feed upon organisms such as small fish because the individual polyps work together to catch the pray with their stinging tentacles.|$|R

50|$|The park's {{coral reefs}} form the {{physical}} and biological backbone of the area. With over 150 species of hard and soft <b>corals,</b> such as <b>brain</b> <b>corals,</b> fan corals and sponges, it provides for abundant nutrients for fish. The main park has over 500 species of fish and the reserve over 1000. There are also whale sharks, manta rays, octopus and barracuda {{as some of the}} larger species in the park.|$|R
50|$|Boulder <b>brain</b> <b>corals</b> inhabit {{coral reefs}} in the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, with most occurrences off {{the coasts of}} Belize, eastern Yucatán Peninsula, {{southern}} Florida, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and Cuba.

50|$|Like other genera of <b>corals,</b> <b>brain</b> <b>corals</b> feed {{on small}} {{drifting}} animals, and also receive nutrients {{provided by the}} algae which live within their tissues.

50|$|<b>Brain</b> <b>corals</b> {{extend their}} tentacles to catch food at night. During the day, {{they use their}} tentacles for {{protection}} by wrapping them over the grooves on their surface. The surface is hard and offers good protection against fish or hurricanes. Branching corals, such as staghorn corals, grow more rapidly, but are more vulnerable to storm damage.|$|R

5000|$|Open <b>brain</b> <b>corals</b> {{are found}} in the warm, shallow waters of the tropics. Due to the {{symbiotic}} relationship corals have with zooxanthellae (for more information, see [...] "symbiotic relationship" [...] section), corals and therefore coral reefs, thrive in clear, shallow waters to allow the zooxanthellae to photosynthesize. However, this general rule does not apply to all species and there are some exceptions.|$|R

50|$|Spirobranchus giganteus is {{commonly}} found embedded in entire heads of massive corals, such as stony corals like Porites and <b>brain</b> <b>corals.</b> Like members of its family, it can secrete a calcareous tube around its body. This tube {{serves as the}} worm's home and protection. S. giganteus usually bores a hole into an existing head of living coral before secreting its tube, thereby increasing its level of protection.|$|R

50|$|At present, {{the island}} is home to over 650 {{documented}} species of fish and estimated to have over 400 species of corals. Most of the Philippines' 450 species of coral can be found here, from tiny bubble corals to huge gorgonian sea fans and <b>brain</b> <b>corals.</b> Visitors and tourists pay a fee to enter Apo Island and to snorkel or dive in the marine sanctuary there. These fees are used to keep the sanctuary clean and in good condition.|$|R
