50|$|For example, {{the most}} {{recently}} issued treasury bond in the US - {{known as the}} benchmark - will be more liquid than bonds of similar but slightly shorter maturity that were issued previously. Trading is concentrated in the <b>benchmark</b> <b>bond,</b> and transaction costs are lower for buying or selling it. As a consequence, it tends to trade more expensively than less liquid older bonds, but this expensiveness (or richness) tends to have a limited duration, because after a certain time {{there will be a}} new benchmark, and trading will shift to this security newly issued by the Treasury. One core trade in the LTCM strategies was to purchase the old benchmark - now a 29.75-year bond, and which no longer had a significant premium - and to sell short the newly issued benchmark 30-year, which traded at a premium. Over time the valuations of the two bonds would tend to converge as the richness of the benchmark faded once a new benchmark was issued. If the coupons of the two bonds were similar, then this trade would create an exposure to changes {{in the shape of the}} yield curve: a flattening would depress the yields and raise the prices of longer-dated bonds, and raise the yields and depress the prices of shorter-dated bonds. It would therefore tend to create losses by making the 30-year bond that LTCM was short more expensive (and the 29.75-year bond they owned cheaper) even if there had been no change in the true relative valuation of the securities. This exposure to the shape of the yield curve could be managed at a portfolio level, and hedged out by entering a smaller steepener in other similar securities.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} is to learn the 10 -year Government Benchmark Bond's {{behavior}} and effects on the other country's <b>benchmark</b> <b>bond.</b> For this purpose, we examined Abnormal Return and Cumulative Abnormal Return of Australia, Canada, Euro Zone, UK, Japan and the U. S. ’s 10 -year Government <b>Benchmark</b> <b>Bond</b> monthly rate from the period of January 2000 to April 2015. This study analyzed 184 nominal repurchase rates in a monthly base for each country's <b>benchmark</b> <b>bond</b> as a time series. In calculating Abnormal Return, US's Government Benchmark Bond's Rate and Euro Zone's Government Benchmark Bond's Rate have been determined as comparison parameters to the other countries. According to cumulative abnormal returns, we have detected which country has dramatically dropped against both the U. S. ’s and Euro zone's <b>benchmark</b> <b>bond</b> yield. With this evidence, we have taken into account any co-integrating relationships among the countries’ benchmark bonds. We analyzed (Johansen & Juselius, 1990) Co-integration Test to determine any long term relationship between them. In addition to the Co-integration test, we need to determine any short term effect for each series. In this study, we tested Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) to calculate the coefficient to hold balance between co-integration.

40|$|We present {{preliminary}} {{findings on the}} liquidity {{of the government and}} covered bond markets in Denmark before, during and after the 2008 financial crisis. The analysis focuses on wholesale trading in <b>benchmark</b> <b>bonds</b> in the two markets and is based on an up to now unused transaction level dataset for the period from January 2005 until May 2010. We find that even though trading continued during the crisis, both markets experienced substantial declines in liquidity and significantly increased liquidity risk. Overall, our findings suggest that Danish <b>benchmark</b> covered <b>bonds</b> by and large are as liquid as Danish government bonds during periods of market stress. The findings also suggest that before the crisis government bonds were slightly more liquid than covered bonds in both the short- and longterm market segments.

40|$|The {{first part}} of this {{dissertation}} reviews the asset pricing literature on Turkish markets. After a general literature review, it focuses on studies associated with share issuance; next, it examines literature on the relationship between macroeconomic factors and stock returns. The second part of this dissertation investigates the predictive power of share issuance on stock returns on the Borsa Istanbul and tests its significance vis-à-vis the well-known factors of market equity, book-to-market and momentum by employing multivariate Fama-MacBeth regressions. The sign of the slope coefficients on book-to-market and market equity are consistent with prior literature; however, the slope coefficient on momentum is negative. In univariate settings, share issuance is not statistically significant because of the mechanical relation between rights offerings and book value; however, when considered jointly with book-to-market, market equity and momentum, share issuance predicts cross-sectional returns, especially for longer return horizons. The analysis shows that after three-month return regressions, share issuance is more significant than market equity and momentum, and is similar to book-to-market in terms of predictive power. The third part of this dissertation analyzes stock exposure to various financial and macroeconomic risk factors through univariate and multivariate estimates of factor betas. It also investigates the performance of these factor betas in predicting the cross-sectional variation in individual stock returns quoted on the Turkish stock market over the sample period 1992 - 2011. The study contributes to the literature through its use of a two-step procedure. First, the factor betas are estimated using stock returns and macroeconomic factors; then, the sensitivities of these factor betas are calculated. The three most important findings are: (i) there exists a negative and significant relation between the interest rate beta of <b>benchmark</b> <b>bonds</b> and future individual stock returns; (ii) the addition of well-known market, book-to-market, size and momentum factors does not alter the statistical significance of the interest rate beta of benchmark bonds; and (iii) univariate portfolio analysis shows that these results are driven by debt/equity (leverage) ratio. In short, the study concludes that the sensitivity to the interest rate of <b>benchmark</b> <b>bonds</b> or leverage is a risk factor for the Turkish stock market...|$|R

40|$|Liquidity in {{government}} securities markets, despite their importance to {{both private and}} public agents, has received much attention in the literature only recently {{due to the fact that}} high-frequency data from trading in those markets were previously unavailable. This paper attempts to measure liquidity in the Electronic Secondary Market for Securities, where Greek government securities are traded, by estimating six different liquidity measures from high-frequency data. The most appropriate measures for this specific market are derived from the analysis and comparison of the obtained estimates. By any of the measures examined, the ten-year <b>benchmark</b> <b>bond</b> is the most liquid security. The bid-ask spread emerges as a good measure of liquidity for the pre euro area entry period, but looses part of its importance in the post euro area entry period of our sample. An interesting finding is that, in the Electronic Secondary Market for Securities, liquidity is only weakly related to price volatility, probably due to the specific structure of the government securities market in Greece. Therefore, trading activity is also found to be a good proxy of liquidity in this specific market. Money demand; Greek bond market, market microstructure, liquidity, order flow. ...|$|E

The first is in line with the sovereign ceiling "lite" hypothesis which states that the transfer of risk from the sovereign to the private sector is less than 1 to 1.

Using daily stock and bond returns on emerging and developed markets from 1998 to 2007, the empirical results show that {{financial crises}} are indeed alike, as all linkages are statistically important across all crises. However, the strength of these linkages does vary across crises.

40|$|Not long ago, {{financial}} markets in most poor and middle-income countries were shallow to nonexistent, and closed to foreigners. Governments {{often had to}} rely on risky borrowing abroad; the private sector had even fewer options. But between 1995 and 2005, domestic debt in the emerging markets grew from $ 1 trillion to $ 4 trillion. In Mexico, domestic debt went from just over 20 % of the total government debt stock in 1995 to nearly 80 % in 2007. Foreign and local investors are buying. Over the same period, derivative contracts to transfer emerging market credit risk surpassed the market capitalization of the <b>benchmark</b> <b>bond</b> index. The growth of domestic bonds and risk transfer technology makes the emerging markets look more mature, or mainstream. Yet a closer look at recent changes suggests that the popular rhetoric of mainstreaming and convergence obscures more than it reveals. Emerging and mainstream markets may share participants and use similar instruments, but this formal resemblance rarely stands for substantive identity. Instead, investors use the same instruments differently in different markets, which, as the examples in the text suggest, can be its own source of risk. Law scholarship has yet to engage with the shift from foreign-law, foreign-currency to local-law, local-currency bonds and the rise of credit derivatives in the emerging markets.

40|$|With the {{elimination}} of foreign exchange risk among the E. M. U. -member countries, the yield of, say, French <b>benchmark</b> government <b>bonds</b> (henceforth, the yield) should be {{equal to that of}} German bonds, plus some credit and liquidity premia. Since both premia are not likely to change substantially from one day to the other, the yield should move in tandem with the German one and the corresponding spread should remain relatively stable. Yet, the yield exhibits a small but economically and statistically significant undershooting in response to changes in the German one, as a result of which the spread tends to decline when the latter increases, and vice-versa. We propose that the undershooting is the product of lagged adjustment in the European bond portfolios that is driven by liquidity considerations and, in particular, by the possibility of excessive bond-price movements in response to changes in the German yield. The empirical results are consistent with this proposition and additionally suggest that the adjustment can last for as long as four days. <b>Benchmark</b> Government <b>Bonds,</b> E. M.

40|$|References {{to policy}} credibility, {{particularly}} with regard to fiscal policy, are ubiquitous in both economic literature and financial markets, even though it is not directly observable. The case of the EU new member states (NMS) -emerging markets joining a supranational entity that is generally considered to have higher policy credibility-provides a unique experiment to assess the effects of credibility on sovereign credit. This paper examines the impact of EU accession on three key variables that can reflect in varying degrees policy credibility: sovereign ratings, foreign currency spreads, and local currency yields. The results suggest that the NMS appear to have enjoyed higher credibility compared to their peers.

40|$|This study characterizes {{volatility}} {{dynamics in}} external emerging bond markets and examines how prices and volatility respond to news about macroeconomic fundamentals. As in mature bond markets, macroeconomic surprises in external emerging bond markets {{are found to}} aÂ¤ect both conditional returns and volatility, with the eÂ¤ects on volatility being more pronounced and longer lasting than those on prices. Yet the process of information absorption {{tends to be more}} drawn out than in mature bond markets. International and regional macroeconomic news is at least as important as local news for both asset valuations and volatility dynamics in external emerging bond markets.
