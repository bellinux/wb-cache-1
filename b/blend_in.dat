5|$|Camouflage {{is common}} and {{widespread}} among beetle families, {{especially those that}} feed on wood or vegetation, such as leaf beetles (Chrysomelidae, which are often green) and weevils. In some species, sculpturing or various coloured scales or hairs cause beetles such as the avocado weevil Heilipus apiatus to resemble bird dung or other inedible objects. Many beetles that live in sandy environments <b>blend</b> <b>in</b> with the coloration of that substrate.|$|E

5|$|Galiella rufa is a {{saprobic}} species, {{and grows}} either solitarily, but more usually in groups or in clusters on decaying hardwood branches and logs. The fungus fruits {{in late summer}} and autumn. The fungus has been noted to fruit readily on logs used for the cultivation of the shiitake mushroom. The fruit bodies are readily overlooked as they <b>blend</b> <b>in</b> with their surroundings.|$|E
5|$|In late 1999, a {{group of}} men from Hamburg, Germany arrived in Afghanistan, {{including}} Mohamed Atta, Marwan al-Shehhi, Ziad Jarrah, and Ramzi bin al-Shibh. Bin Laden selected these men because they were educated, could speak English, and had experience living in the West. New recruits were routinely screened for special skills and al-Qaeda leaders consequently discovered that Hani Hanjour already had a commercial pilot's license. Mohammed later said that he helped the hijackers <b>blend</b> <b>in</b> by teaching them how to order food in restaurants and dress in Western clothing.|$|E
5|$|Protective {{resemblance}} {{is used by}} prey {{to avoid}} predation. It includes special protective resemblance, now called mimesis, where the whole animal looks like some other object, for example when a caterpillar resembles a twig or a bird dropping. In general protective resemblance, now called crypsis, the animal's texture blends with the background, for example when a moth's colour and pattern <b>blend</b> <b>in</b> with tree bark.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} {{intended}} to make Sawyer look like less of a belligerent, as he had generally acted as the antagonist in previous episodes. It also {{set the stage for}} the love triangle between Kate, Sawyer, and Jack. The episode was first broadcast in the United States on November 10, 2004, earning 18.44 million viewers. It received mostly positive reviews, although a few reviewers discussed aspects of the episode that they felt did not <b>blend</b> <b>in</b> well with the rest of the episode and series.|$|E
5|$|A {{flexible-fuel vehicle}} (FFV) or dual-fuel vehicle (colloquially called a flex-fuel vehicle) is an {{alternative}} fuel vehicle with an internal combustion engine designed to run {{on more than one}} fuel, usually gasoline blended with either ethanol or methanol fuel, and both fuels are stored in the same common tank. Modern flex-fuel engines are capable of burning any proportion of the resulting <b>blend</b> <b>in</b> the combustion chamber as fuel injection and spark timing are adjusted automatically according to the actual blend detected by a fuel composition sensor. Flex-fuel vehicles are distinguished from bi-fuel vehicles, where two fuels are stored in separate tanks and the engine runs on one fuel at a time, for example, compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), or hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|After {{emerging}} from a manhole in the showers of the guard living quarters, Riddick uses a guard uniform to <b>blend</b> <b>in</b> {{as he makes his}} way to the space port and his chance at escape. Realizing he requires a guard to get through the retinal scanner that locks the doors to the space port, Riddick decides to go after Abbott and take his eyes. He gains access to Abbott's apartment by telling him there is a delivery for him. A fire fight ensues and after that, as Abbott bleeds out on the floor, Riddick moves in for the kill but is stopped by Johns.|$|E

5|$|Camouflage uses any {{combination}} of materials, coloration, or illumination for concealment to make the organism hard to detect by sight. It is common in both terrestrial and marine animals. Camouflage can be achieved in many different ways, such as through resemblance to surroundings, disruptive coloration, shadow elimination, self-decoration, cryptic behavior, or changeable skin patterns and color. Animals such as the flat-tail horned lizard of North America have evolved to eliminate their shadow and <b>blend</b> <b>in</b> with the ground. The bodies of these lizards are flattened, and their sides thin towards the edge. This body form, along with the white scales fringed along their sides, allows the lizards to effectively hide their shadows. Additionally, these lizards hide any remaining shadows by pressing their bodies to the ground.|$|E
5|$|Larger ships {{often had}} false bows and sterns painted in a {{different}} shade {{from the rest of}} the hull to create the impression of the ship being at greater range from the observer. German decks were a very dark gray. Smaller ships operating in the North Sea or Baltic Sea were painted white or a very pale gray to <b>blend</b> <b>in</b> with daytime mist and nighttime phosphorescent organisms. As in the First World War, the Germans again employed disguised commerce raiders, Hilfskreuzer such as Atlantis, Thor and Kormoran. These ships were able to modify their appearance to throw off the searching Allied cruisers.|$|E
5|$|Mantises are preyed on by {{vertebrates}} such as frogs, lizards, and birds, and by invertebrates such as spiders and ants. Generally, mantises {{protect themselves}} by camouflage, most species being cryptically colored to resemble foliage or other backgrounds, both to avoid predators and to better snare their prey. Those that live on uniformly colored surfaces such as bare earth or tree bark are dorsoventrally flattened {{so as to}} eliminate shadows that might reveal their presence. The species from different families called flower mantises are aggressive mimics: they resemble flowers convincingly enough to attract prey that come to collect pollen and nectar. Some species in Africa and Australia are able to turn black after a molt {{towards the end of}} the dry season; at this time of year, bush fires occur and this coloration enables them to <b>blend</b> <b>in</b> with the fire-ravaged landscape (fire melanism).|$|E

5|$|New {{memorial}} buildings {{could also}} adopt a medieval style. The Scottish National War Memorial, for example, a Scots baronial styled memorial hall complete with stained glass in Edinburgh Castle, attempts to <b>blend</b> <b>in</b> {{with the surrounding}} medieval fortress. In Germany, the totenburgen usually looked to the past for their style; Tannenberg, for example, was heavily medieval in appearance, resembling a castle, albeit combined with a huge cross and mass graves. The dolmen boulders used around the outside of many German memorials reinforced the archaic feel of the monuments. In other cases Germans chose to preserve or rebuild real medieval buildings and architecture to form war memorials, such as parts of Dorsten and Dülken.|$|E
5|$|Some females {{stay and}} defend the nest until the chicks start hatching, but most leave the nesting area {{completely}} to nest again; in a good season, a female emu may nest three times. If the parents stay together during the incubation period, they will take turns standing guard over the eggs while the other drinks and feeds within earshot. If it perceives a threat during this period, it will lie {{down on top of}} the nest and try to <b>blend</b> <b>in</b> with the similar-looking surrounds, and suddenly stand up to confront and scare the other party if it comes close.|$|E
5|$|The Soviets {{employed}} maskirovka (military deception) to mask defensive {{positions and}} troop dispositions and {{to conceal the}} movement of men and materiel. These included camouflaging gun emplacements, constructing dummy airfields and depots, generating false radio-traffic, and spreading rumours among the Soviet frontline troops and the civilian population in the German-held areas. Movement of forces and supplies {{to and from the}} salient took place at night only. Ammunition caches were carefully concealed to <b>blend</b> <b>in</b> with the landscape. Radio transmission was restricted and fires were forbidden. Command posts were hidden and motor transport in and around them forbidden.|$|E
40|$|The {{miscibility}} of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and polyethyleneglycol (PEG) <b>blends</b> <b>in</b> tetrahydrofuran (THF) {{has been}} investigated by viscosity, density, refractive index, and ultrasonic velocity studies. Various interaction parameters such as polymer–solvent and blend– solvent interaction parameters and heat of mixing have been calculated using the viscosity, density, and ultrasonic velocity data. The results indicated the existence of positive interactions <b>in</b> the <b>blend</b> polymer solutions {{and that they are}} miscible in THF in the entire composition range. The study also revealed that variation in the temperature does not affect the miscibility of PMMA and PEG <b>blends</b> <b>in</b> THF significantly.

5|$|The {{result was}} a non-hierarchical, organic {{collection}} of low-lying buildings intended to allow views of, and <b>blend</b> <b>in</b> with, the surrounding rugged scenery and symbolise the connection between nature and the Scottish people. As a consequence the building has many features connected to nature and land, such as the leaf shaped motifs of the roof in the Garden Lobby of the building, and the large windows of the debating chamber, committee rooms and the Tower Buildings which face the broad expanse of Holyrood Park, Arthur's Seat and Salisbury Crags. Inside the buildings, the connection to the land {{is reinforced by the}} use of Scottish rock such as gneiss and granite in the flooring and walls, and the use of oak and sycamore {{in the construction of the}} furniture.|$|E
5|$|The species Timema cristinae {{exhibits}} both striped and unstriped populations {{depending on}} the host plant, a form of polymorphism that clearly illustrates the camouflage function of the stripe. The earliest ancestors of this species were generalists that fed on plants belonging to both the genera Adenostoma and Ceanothus. They eventually diverged into two distinct ecotypes with a more specialist host plant preference. One ecotype prefers to feed on Adenostoma while the other ecotype prefers to feed on Ceanothus. The Adenostoma ecotype possesses a white dorsal stripe, an adaptation to <b>blend</b> <b>in</b> with the needle-like leaves of the plant, while the Ceanothus ecotype does not (Ceanothus spp. have broad leaves). The Adenostoma ecotype is also smaller, with a wider head, and shorter legs.|$|E
5|$|Gray was {{not chosen}} for camouflage, however, it did, at times, provide {{enough of a}} mask along tree lines during battle; keeping the line of Infantry hidden long enough to strike effectively. At {{the time of the}} American Civil War, the {{usefulness}} of camouflage was not generally recognized. Gray was chosen for Confederate uniforms because gray dye could be made relatively cheaply and it was the standard uniform color of the various State Militias. The gray uniforms worn by early State volunteers was normally a shade of cadet gray, which is not suitable for combat wear, as it gives away the position of the individual easily from its bright blue-gray tones, and for this reason it was preserved by some men for dress-parade functions. The gray mentioned is dull toned, often varying in color depending on the region and time during the conflict, resulting in a uniform that could <b>blend</b> <b>in</b> with the tree lines, or hide the men in the field wearing them.|$|E
