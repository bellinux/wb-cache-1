5|$|Although {{historically}} the U.S. {{state of}} Connecticut is not typically known to fall casualty to tornadoes, more than 100 of these powerful storms {{have affected the}} state in modern history, resulting in at least 48deaths, 780injuries, and more than $500million in damage. This list of tornadoes in the state is likely incomplete, as official records date <b>back</b> <b>only</b> to 1950 for tornadoes in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Another American {{tradition}} {{is that of}} an apolitical military, although this custom was of more recent origin, dating <b>back</b> <b>only</b> to the period after the American Civil War. Few officers voted in the 19th century, {{but not so much}} from a lack of interest in politics as because frequently moving from state to state and living on Federal land effectively disenfranchised them under the laws of many states. Under General of the Army William T. Sherman, the Commanding General of the United States Army from 1869 to 1883, who hated politics, this custom of an apolitical military became firmly established.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Grameen Bank {{started a}} new program, {{different}} from its traditional group-based lending, exclusively targeted to the beggars in Bangladesh. This program is focused on distributing small loans to beggars. The loans are completely interest-free, the repayment period can be arbitrarily long, and the borrower is covered under life insurance free of cost. For example, a beggar taking a small loan of around 100 taka (about US$1.50) may pay <b>back</b> <b>only</b> 2.00 taka (about 3.4 US cents) per week.|$|E

5|$|The Chumscrubber premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 25, 2005 and was {{released}} theatrically on August 26, 2005.

The film was both a critical and commercial failure, receiving mostly negative reviews and earning <b>back</b> <b>only</b> US$350,000 of its $10 million budget.|$|E
5|$|Zoe visits her {{old school}} with Sarah and Nancy Hayton (Jessica Fox), recalling her {{relationship}} with her former teacher. She and Sarah get drunk and sleep together, which they both regret and agree to keep quiet. Their one-night stand is later revealed, however, leaving Mike devastated. He throws them both out, before realising how much he loves Zoe and offering to take her <b>back,</b> <b>only</b> for her to refuse.|$|E
5|$|A {{scenario}} {{consistent with}} the phylogenetic, ice sheet size, and sea-level depth data is that during the Late Pleistocene the sea levels were at their lowest. A single wave of wolf colonization into North America commenced {{with the opening of}} the Bering land bridge 70,000YBP. It ended with the closing of the Yukon corridor that ran along the division between the Laurentide Ice Sheet and the Cordilleran Ice Sheet 23,000YBP during the Late Glacial Maximum. As wolves had been in the fossil record of North America but the genetic ancestry of modern wolves could be traced <b>back</b> <b>only</b> 80,000 years, the wolf haplotypes that were already in North America were replaced by these invaders, either through competitive displacement or through genetic admixture. The replacement in North America of a basal population of wolves by a more recent one is {{consistent with the}} findings of earlier studies.|$|E

5|$|By 1953, the First Indochina War was {{not going}} well for France. A {{succession}} of commanders— Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque, Jean Étienne Valluy, Roger Blaizot, Marcel Carpentier, Jean de Lattre de Tassigny, and Raoul Salan— had proven incapable of suppressing the insurrection of the Viet Minh fighting for independence. During their 1952–53 campaign, the Viet Minh had overrun vast swathes of Laos, a French ally and Vietnam's western neighbor, advancing as far as Luang Prabang and the Plain of Jars. The French were unable to slow the Viet Minh advance, who fell <b>back</b> <b>only</b> after outrunning their always-tenuous supply lines. In 1953, the French had begun to strengthen their defenses in the Hanoi delta region {{to prepare for a}} series of offensives against Viet Minh staging areas in northwest Vietnam. They set up fortified towns and outposts in the area, including Lai Châu near the Chinese border to the north, Nà Sản to the west of Hanoi, and the Plain of Jars in northern Laos.|$|E
5|$|Wellington quickly {{changed his}} plans after seeing his flank attack fail. He {{converted}} his holding attack with the 3rd and 6th Divisions into a head on assault. The new assault began around 11:30 am. The British commander sent every available unit against the French right flank and center. He held <b>back</b> <b>only</b> 2/95th Foot and 3/95th Foot, the Portuguese 3rd Caçadores Battalion and the 17th Line Infantry Regiment from the Light Division. The brigades of Ross and Vasconcellos were withdrawn {{and replaced by}} the 7th Division. The struggle for Saint-Boès broke out anew when Walker's division and William Anson's brigade of 4th Division attacked, supported by two British artillery batteries firing from the church knoll. Four battalions attacked in the center led by the 6th Foot. Two battalions were deployed {{to the left and}} John Milley Doyle's Portuguese brigade was on the right. Taupin's tired soldiers, who had been fighting for about four hours, were driven back behind the Plassotte knoll where they rallied.|$|E
5|$|Melish {{had been}} fielding {{inquiries}} from collectors since Roosevelt signed the legislation, but from mid-May, those who wrote received <b>back</b> <b>only</b> postcards stating the new issue was oversubscribed. The summer of 1936 was {{the peak of}} the commemorative coin boom, and Melish announced the new pieces would be sold in sets of three by mint mark for $7.75 (a high price at that time). Order blanks were sent to those who had written early, and soon these blanks were selling for $10. Yet few collectors were successful in having their orders filled, with most having their payment returned as the coins had supposedly sold out. The sets quickly jumped in price to $40. At this high level, many coins proved available. Numismatist Q. David Bowers stated that these were most likely surreptitiously sold by Melish and other insiders. Melish also allowed the issuers of the York County, Maine Tercentenary half dollar to purchase, at the original issue price, several sets—members of the public could order at most one set at that price. In return, he sought to purchase that and other commemorative coins in quantities beyond the usual order limit. Nevertheless, when the Oregon Trail Memorial Association, issuer of the long-lived half dollar honoring the trail, tried to purchase a set, Melish replied that they were sold out.|$|E

5|$|The ancestral {{species of}} the genus Cucurbita {{were present in the}} Americas before the arrival of humans, and are native to the New World. The likely center of origin is {{southern}} Mexico, spreading south through what is now known as Mesoamerica, on into South America, and north to what is now the southwestern United States. Evolutionarily speaking, the genus is relatively recent in origin, dating <b>back</b> <b>only</b> to the Holocene, whereas the family Cucurbitaceae, in the shape of seeds similar to Bryonia, dates to the Paleocene. No species within the genus is entirely genetically isolated. C.moschata can intercross with all the others, though the hybrid offspring may not themselves be fertile unless they become polyploid. The genus was part of the culture of almost every native peoples group from southern South America to southern Canada. Modern-day cultivated Cucurbita are not found in the wild. Genetic studies of the mitochondrial gene nad1 show there were at least six independent domestication events of Cucurbita separating domestic species from their wild ancestors. Species native to North America include C.digitata (calabazilla), and C.foetidissima (buffalo gourd), C.palmata (coyote melon), and C.pepo. Some species, such as C.digitata and C.ficifolia, are referred to as gourds. Gourds, also called bottle-gourds, which are used as utensils or vessels, belong to the genus Lagenaria and are native to Africa. Lagenaria are in the same family and subfamily as Cucurbita but in a different tribe.|$|E
