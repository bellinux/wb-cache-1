5|$|Washington and Rochambeau {{discussed}} {{where to}} launch a joint attack. Washington believed an attack on New York was the <b>best</b> <b>option,</b> since the Americans and French now outnumbered the British defenders 3 to 1. Rochambeau disagreed, arguing the fleet in the West Indies under Admiral de Grasse was going to sail to the American coast, where easier options than attacking New York could be attempted.|$|E
5|$|During the night, Washington {{called a}} council {{of war and}} asked his {{officers}} whether they should stand and fight, attempt to cross the river somewhere, or take the backroads to attack Princeton. Although the idea had already occurred to Washington, he learned from Arthur St. Clair and John Cadwalader that his plan to attack Princeton was indeed possible. Two intelligence collection efforts, both of which came to fruition {{at the end of}} December 1776, supported such a surprise attack. After consulting with his officers, they agreed that the <b>best</b> <b>option</b> was to attack Princeton.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea for}} a tunnel under Loveland Pass existed {{at least since the}} 1940s. Serious {{discussion}} began when the state of Colorado lobbied for the Interstate Highway System to route a transcontinental highway across Colorado. After a round of negotiations with Utah officials, it was decided the <b>best</b> <b>option</b> was to follow the U.S. Route 6 corridor. Engineers recommended to tunnel under the pass, rather than attempt to build a route across it that conformed to Interstate Highway standards.|$|E
5|$|A {{geothermal}} heat pump can extract enough heat from shallow ground {{anywhere in the}} world to provide home heating, but industrial applications need the higher temperatures of deep resources. The thermal efficiency and profitability of electricity generation is particularly sensitive to temperature. The most demanding applications receive the greatest benefit from a high natural heat flux, ideally from using a hot spring. The next <b>best</b> <b>option</b> is to drill a well into a hot aquifer. If no adequate aquifer is available, an artificial one may be built by injecting water to hydraulically fracture the bedrock. This last approach is called hot dry rock geothermal energy in Europe, or enhanced geothermal systems in North America. Much greater potential may be available from this approach than from conventional tapping of natural aquifers.|$|E
5|$|As {{the rain}} continued, Washington {{sent a letter}} instructing General William Heath, who was at Kings Bridge between Manhattan and {{what is now the}} Bronx, to send every {{flat-bottomed}} boat and sloop without delay, in case battalions of infantry from New Jersey came to reinforce their position. At 16:00, on August 29, Washington held a meeting with his generals. Mifflin advised Washington to retreat to Manhattan while Mifflin and his Pennsylvania regiments made up the rear guard, holding the line until the rest of the army had withdrawn. The generals agreed unanimously with Mifflin that retreat was the <b>best</b> <b>option</b> and Washington had orders go out by the evening.|$|E

The TV Company argued that Ecclestone and Mosley were in breach of commercial clauses in the Treaty of Rome; following the court's decision Mosley appealed the judgement and cancelled the series until further notice. On appeal, the court ruled that the series organiser should be able to sell the television rights to whoever they felt was the <b>best</b> <b>option</b> for coverage and the FIA reinstated the European Truck Racing Cup.|$|E
5|$|In late 1950, USAF Chief Scientist Louis Ridenour {{initiated}} Project Charles at MIT {{to study}} problems of air defense. The study determined that Valley's methods were the <b>best</b> <b>option.</b> In May 1951, {{the project was}} reformed as Project Lincoln to investigate unusual reconnaissance methods; this group met at Beacon Hill, Boston, and {{became known as the}} Beacon Hill Study Group. Saville expanded the group by naming 15 men to the project, all experts in their fields, including Edwin H. Land, James Gilbert Baker, Edward Mills Purcell, Richard Scott Perkin and USAF Colonel Richard S. Leghorn. The project led to the establishment of Lincoln Laboratory, a research and development project of the Defense Department.|$|E
5|$|Some {{countries}} have meteorological agencies which distribute tornado forecasts and increase levels of alert {{of a possible}} tornado (such as tornado watches and warnings in the United States and Canada). Weather radios provide an alarm when a severe weather advisory is issued for the local area, though these are mainly available only in the United States. Unless the tornado is far away and highly visible, meteorologists advise that drivers park their vehicles far {{to the side of}} the road (so as not to block emergency traffic), and find a sturdy shelter. If no sturdy shelter is nearby, getting low in a ditch is the next <b>best</b> <b>option.</b> Highway overpasses are one of the worst places to take shelter during tornadoes, as the constricted space can be subject to increased wind speed and funneling of debris underneath the overpass.|$|E

5|$|The French {{government}} negotiator Jean Sainteny flew to Saigon {{to consult}} Leclerc, who was acting as high commissioner {{in the absence}} of d'Argenlieu. Leclerc approved Sainteny's proposal to negotiate with Ho because he preferred a diplomatic solution to a larger conflict, but he still dispatched a flotilla with shiploads of French soldiers to northern Vietnam ready to attack if the talks failed. At that time, Ho felt that negotiations with the French constituted his <b>best</b> <b>option</b> because the Soviet Union had not yet endorsed the Vietminh or the Vietnamese nationalist party (VNQDD), and the French Communist Party chose to support French rule in Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|The hostility {{between rival}} Spanish factions in Trujillo continued, and Vasco de Herrera {{was unable to}} unite the colonists behind him. He decided the <b>best</b> <b>option</b> would be to found a new town, and {{possibly}} abandon Trujillo. Cerezeda opposed him at every turn, believing this {{would lead to the}} ruin of the Spanish enterprise in Honduras. Natives working the mines near Trujillo rebelled against their excessive tax burden, killing several Spaniards. Vasco de Herrera seized this opportunity as an excuse to launch a punitive expedition, but instead marched inland in an attempt to found another colony. The Nahuas of Papayeca rebelled against the excessive cruelty of Andrés de Cereceda under their leader Picecura, and fled to the wilds. In 1531, Vasco de Herrera attempted to bring them back to their settlements.|$|E
5|$|Helium {{is used as}} a {{component}} of breathing gases to replace nitrogen, due its low solubility in fluids, especially in lipids. Gases are absorbed by the blood and body tissues when under pressure like in scuba diving, which causes an anesthetic effect known as nitrogen narcosis. Due to its reduced solubility, little helium is taken into cell membranes, and when helium is used to replace part of the breathing mixtures, such as in trimix or heliox, a decrease in the narcotic effect of the gas at depth is obtained. Helium's reduced solubility offers further advantages for the condition known as decompression sickness, or the bends. The reduced amount of dissolved gas in the body means that fewer gas bubbles form during the decrease in pressure of the ascent. Another noble gas, argon, is considered the <b>best</b> <b>option</b> for use as a drysuit inflation gas for scuba diving. Helium is also used as filling gas in nuclear fuel rods for nuclear reactors.|$|E

5|$|In August 1947, Chadwick {{was killed}} in the crash of the Avro Tudor 2 {{prototype}} and was succeeded by Sir William Farren. Reductions in wing thickness made it impossible to incorporate the split bomb bays and stacked engines, thus the engines were placed side-by-side in pairs either side of a single bomb-bay, with the fuselage growing somewhat. The wingtip fins gave way to a single fin on the aircraft's centreline. Rival manufacturer Handley Page received a prototype contract for its crescent-winged HP.80 B.35/46 tender in November 1947. Though considered the <b>best</b> <b>option,</b> contract placement for Avro's design was delayed whilst its technical strength was established. Instructions to proceed with the construction of two Avro 698 prototypes was received in January 1948. As an insurance measure against both radical designs failing, Short Brothers received a contract for the prototype SA.4 to the less-stringent Specification B.14/46; the SA.4, later named Sperrin, was not required. In April 1948, Vickers also received authority to proceed with their Type 660 which, although falling short of the B.35/46 Specification, being of a more conventional design would be available sooner; this plane entered service as the Valiant.|$|E
5|$|In {{search of}} a fair trial, Carrouges {{traveled}} to Paris {{to appeal to the}} King himself. Knowing that his case depended solely on his wife's testimony and was therefore weak, Carrouges developed a plan: Instead of proceeding with a normal criminal trial, Carrouges would challenge Le Gris to a judicial duel, the survivor of which would thus have been deemed by God to have been the rightful claimant. Such trials-by-combat, once common in France, were rare by 1386 and the chance of one being permitted by the King unlikely. Nevertheless, Carrouges saw this scheme as his <b>best</b> <b>option</b> of procuring justice and redeeming his wife's reputation. A few days after his arrival in Paris, Carrouges was presented to the King at the Château de Vincennes {{in order to make the}} first official appeal in the lengthy trial process. In doing so, he captured the imagination of the French court, which later become so fascinated with the Carrouges-Le Gris trial that it would shape its schedule around watching the culminating combat.|$|E
5|$|Kilner {{began the}} 1920 season with an innings of 206 not {{out in his}} first match, against Derbyshire, and the effort {{remained}} the highest score of his career. He batted for four hours, hitting 24 fours and two sixes. He could have been caught when he had scored around fifty, but a local newspaper described the innings as brilliant, his driving and pulling being particularly effective. Kilner appeared in one representative match: at the end-of-season Scarborough Festival, he played for CI Thornton's XI against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) side which visited Australia in the winter—at the time, the MCC administered English cricket, and the England team toured under its name. In total, he scored 1,316 runs {{at an average of}} 37.09 with two more centuries, placing him second in the Yorkshire averages. With the ball, he took 27 wickets but his average of 25.33 was relatively high. The county finished fourth in the Championship as Middlesex were crowned winners. Critics believed Kilner should have bowled more frequently, an opinion shared by Wilfred Rhodes, Yorkshire's main slow left-arm spinner. Conscious of his increasing age, the 42-year-old Rhodes wanted support with the bowling workload; he considered Kilner the <b>best</b> <b>option</b> and encouraged him to improve his left-arm spin. Consequently, during the winter, Kilner practised bowling in the yard of the Wombwell hotel where his father was landlord. Around the same time he celebrated the birth of his second son, named Major after Major Booth.|$|E
