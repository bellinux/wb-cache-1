5|$|Marine mammals {{are able}} to dive {{for long periods of}} time. Both {{pinnipeds}} and cetaceans have large and complex blood vessel systems which serve to store oxygen to support deep diving. Other important reservoirs include muscles, blood, and the spleen which all have the capacity to hold a high concentration of oxygen. They are also capable of <b>bradycardia</b> (reduced heart rate), and vasoconstriction (shunting most of the oxygen to vital organs such as the brain and heart) to allow extended diving times and cope with oxygen deprivation. If oxygen is depleted, marine mammals can access substantial reservoirs of glycogen that support anaerobic glycolysis of the cells involved during conditions of systemic hypoxia associated with prolonged submersion.|$|E
5|$|Abnormalities in {{the normal}} sinus rhythm of the heart can prevent the heart from {{effectively}} pumping blood, and are generally identified by ECG. These cardiac arrhythmias can cause an abnormal but regular heart rhythm, such as a rapid heart rate (tachycardia, classified as arising from above the ventricles or from the ventricles) or a slow heart rate (bradycardia); or may result in irregular rhythms. Tachycardia is generally defined as a heart rate faster than 100 beats per minute, and <b>bradycardia</b> as a heart rate slower than 60. Asystole is the cessation of heart rhythm. A random and varying rhythm is classified as atrial or ventricular fibrillation depending if the electrical activity originates in the atria or the ventricles. Abnormal conduction can cause a delay or unusual order of contraction of the heart muscle. This can {{be a result of}} a disease process, such as heart block, or congenital, such as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Reduction in the {{activity}} of the cholinergic neurons is a well-known feature of Alzheimer's disease. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are employed to reduce the rate at which acetylcholine (ACh) is broken down, thereby increasing the concentration of ACh in the brain and combating the loss of ACh caused by the death of cholinergic neurons. There is evidence for the efficacy of these medications in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, and some evidence for their use in the advanced stage. Only donepezil is approved for treatment of advanced AD dementia. The use of these drugs in mild cognitive impairment has not shown any effect in a delay of the onset of AD. The most common side effects are nausea and vomiting, both of which are linked to cholinergic excess. These side effects arise in approximately 10–20% of users, are mild to moderate in severity, and can be managed by slowly adjusting medication doses. Less common secondary effects include muscle cramps, decreased heart rate (<b>bradycardia),</b> decreased appetite and weight, and increased gastric acid production.|$|E

25|$|<b>Bradycardia</b> {{was defined}} as a heart rate less than 60 beats per minute when {{textbooks}} asserted that the normal range for heart rates was 60–100 BPM. The normal range has since been revised in textbooks to 50–90 BPM for a human at total rest. Setting a lower threshold for <b>bradycardia</b> prevents misclassification of fit individuals as having a pathologic heart rate. The normal heart rate number can vary as children and adolescents tend to have faster heart rates than average adults. <b>Bradycardia</b> may be associated with medical conditions such as hypothyroidism.|$|E

While rigorous studies are lacking in regards to treatment of toxic <b>bradycardias,</b> there are small studies and case reports to help guide clinicians' choices in caring for the poisoned patient. Antidotes, pressor support, and extracorporeal therapy are some of the treatment options for the care of these patients.

40|$|Six preterm {{infants who}} {{developed}} disproportionate {{enlargement of the}} 4 th ventricle during the neonatal period, associated with post-haemorrhagic ventricular dilatation (PHVD), before shunt placement are reported.

In one of the three survivors an isolated 4 th ventricle was subsequently diagnosed later in infancy, requiring drainage. These data suggest that a combination of an enlarged 4 th ventricle on ultrasound and cyanotic spells and/or <b>bradycardias</b> should lead to rapid release of raised pressure in the posterior fossa.

40|$|Abstract Background Apnoea, desaturations and <b>bradycardias</b> {{are common}} {{problems}} in preterm infants {{which can be}} treated with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) and nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). It is unclear whether synchronised NIPPV (SNIPPV) would be even more effective. Objective To assess the effects of flow-SNIPPV, NIPPV and NCPAP on the rate of desaturations and <b>bradycardias</b> in preterm infants and, secondarily, to evaluate their influence on pattern of breathing and gas exchange. Patients and methods Nineteen infants (mean gestational age at study 30  weeks, 9 boys) with apnoeic spells were enrolled in a randomised controlled trial with a cross-over design. They received flow-SNIPPV, NIPPV and NCPAP for 4  h each. All modes were provided by a nasal conventional ventilator able to provide synchronisation by a pneumotachograph.

25|$|Although {{atropine}} treats <b>bradycardia</b> (slow heart rate) {{in emergency}} settings, {{it can cause}} paradoxical heart rate slowing when given at very low doses (i.e. <0.5nbsp&mg), presumably {{as a result of}} central action in the CNS. One proposed mechanism for atropine's paradoxical <b>bradycardia</b> effect at low doses involves blockade of inhibitory presynaptic muscarinic autoreceptors, thereby blocking a system that inhibits the parasympathetic response.|$|E

When the above amine injections were repeated in rats anaesthetized with chloral hydrate, sodium pentobarbitone or halothane the evoked <b>bradycardias</b> were usually smaller and the changes in arterial blood pressure more variable. The cardiovascular responses to carbachol (1 microgram) and to noradrenaline (10 micrograms) were antagonized by intrahypothalamic injection of atropine (1 microgram) and phentolamine (10 micrograms), respectively. The <b>bradycardias</b> evoked by carbachol (1 microgram) and by noradrenaline (10 micrograms) were abolished by pretreatment with intra-arterial injection of methyl atropine (100 micrograms 100 g- 1).

40|$|International audienceBackground: Late-onset sepsis in the {{premature}} infant is frequently revealed by severe, unusual and recurrent <b>bradycardias.</b> In {{view of the}} high morbidity and mortality associated with infection, reliable markers are needed. Objectives: It was {{the aim of this}} study to determine if heart rate (HR) behavior may help the diagnosis of infection in {{premature infant}}s with such cardiac decelerations. Methods: Electrocardiogram recordings were collected in 51 premature infants with a postmenstrual age < 33 weeks with frequent <b>bradycardias.</b> Newborns in the sepsis group (C-reactive protein increase and positive blood culture) were compared with a no-sepsis group (C-reactive protein < 5 mg/l before and 24 h after recording and negative blood cultures) for their HR characteristics, i. e. RR series distribution (mean, median, skewness, kurtosis, sample asymmetry), magnitude of variability in time and frequency domain, fractal exponents (alpha(1), alpha(2)) and complexity measurements (approximate and sample entropy). Results are presented as the median (25 %, 75 %). Results: Gestational, chronological and postmenstrual age and gender were similar in the sepsis (n = 10) and no-sepsis group (n = 38). Three infants had an increase in C-reactive protein but negative cultures. Low entropy measurements [approximate entropy 0. 4 (0. 3, 0. 5) vs. 0. 8 (0. 6, 1); p < 0. 001] and long-range fractal exponent [alpha(2) 0. 78 (0. 71, 0. 83) vs. 0. 92 (0. 8, 1. 1); p < 0. 05] were significantly associated with sepsis. No other HR characteristic was associated with sepsis. The decrease in 0. 1 units of approximate entropy was associated with an over 2 -fold increase in the odds of sepsis. Conclusion: Late-onset sepsis is associated with uncorrelated randomness of the HR. This abnormal HR behavior may help to monitor premature infants presenting with frequent and severe <b>bradycardias...</b>|$|R

40|$|Normal rhythms {{originate}} in the sino-atrial node, a specialized cardiac tissue consisting {{of only a few}} thousands of nodal pacemaker cells. Malfunction of pacemaker cells due to diseases or aging leads to rhythm generation disorders (for example, <b>bradycardias</b> and sick-sinus syndrome (SSS)), which often necessitate the implantation of electronic pacemakers. Although effective, electronic devices are associated with such shortcomings as limited battery life, permanent implantation of leads, lead dislodging, the lack of autonomic responses and so on.
