Better qualified wheelchairs provide more adjustment, so wheelchair components {{have been developed to}} provide that adjustment. Among the wheelchair components, a <b>backrest</b> is one of critical components of the wheelchair due to the importance of seating position and appropriate trunk support. The Lightweight Durable Adjustable Composite (LWDAC) <b>Backrest</b> Mounting project consisted of three design iterations, prototypes, durability testing, and user evaluation. The <b>backrest</b> mounting is adaptable to most ultralight manual wheelchairs. The <b>backrest</b> is designed with features including height, width and <b>backrest</b> angle adjustment. The angle adjustment adds adjustability and flexibility to a rigid <b>backrest</b> and can be operated with only one hand, without high strength or dexterous manipulation. The LWDAC was tested with ANSI/RESNA durability and fatigue test standards and passed impact test, static stability test and durability test, but not fatigue test. This study also included focus groups to gather user and clinician feedback regarding <b>backrest</b> characteristics. The <b>backrest</b> had overall positive response from participants.

(upright), 30 ?, 60 ?, and 90 ? (recumbent). Within each of these five postures, 12 subjects judged the discomfort caused by vertical sinusoidal whole-body vibration (at frequencies from 1 to 20 Hz at magnitudes from 0. 2 to 2. 0 ms- 2 r. m. s.) relative to the discomfort produced by a reference vibration (8 Hz at 0. 4 ms- 2 r. m. s.). With 8 -Hz vertical vibration, the subjects also judged vibration discomfort with each <b>backrest</b> condition relative to the vibration discomfort with no <b>backrest.</b> The locations in the body where discomfort was experienced were determined for each frequency at two vibration magnitudes. Equivalent comfort contours were determined for the five conditions of the <b>backrest</b> and show how discomfort depends on the frequency of vibration, {{the presence of the}} <b>backrest,</b> and the <b>backrest</b> inclination. At frequencies greater than about 8 Hz, the <b>backrest</b> increased vibration discomfort, especially when inclined to 30 ?, 60 ?, or 90 ?, and there was greater discomfort at the head or neck.

Subjects experienced vertical seat vibration at frequencies in the range 2. 5 to 25 Hz at vibration magnitudes in the range 0. 016 to 2. 0 ms^- 2 r. m. s. Equivalent comfort contours were determined with five <b>backrest</b> conditions: no <b>backrest,</b> and with a stationary <b>backrest</b> inclined at 0 degree (upright), 30, 60 and 90 degree. Within all conditions, the frequency of greatest sensitivity to acceleration decreased with increasing vibration magnitude.

Subjects sat in each of four sitting postures having varying foot heights, so as to produce differing thigh contact with the seat.

Objective: To evaluate {{the effect of}} <b>backrest</b> height on wheelchair propulsion kinematics and kinetics. Design: An intervention study with repeated measures. Setting: University laboratory. Participants: Convenience sample included manual wheelchair users (N= 36; 26 men and 10 women) with spinal cord injuries ranging from T 8 to L 2. Intervention: Participants propelled on a motor-driven treadmill for 2 conditions (level and slope of 3 °) at a constant speed of 0. 9 m/s while using in turn a sling <b>backrest</b> fixed at 40. 6 cm (16 in) high (high <b>backrest)</b> and a lower height set at 50 % trunk length (low <b>backrest).</b> Main Outcome Measures: Cadence, stroke angle, peak shoulder extension angle, shoulder flexion/extension range of motion, and mechanical effective force. Results: Pushing with the low <b>backrest</b> height enabled greater range of shoulder motion (P <. 01), increased stroke angle (P <. 01), push time (P <. 01), and reduced cadence (P=. 01) {{regardless of whether the}} treadmill was level or sloped. Conclusions: A lower cadence can be achieved when pushing with a lower <b>backrest,</b> which decreases the risk of developing upper-limb overuse related injuries. However, postural support, comfort, and other activities of daily living must also be considered when selecting a <b>backrest</b> height for active, long-term wheelchair users.

40|$|The {{perception}} of vehicle ride comfort {{is influenced by}} the dynamic performance of full-depth foam used in many vehicle seats. The effects of the thickness of foam on the dynamic stiffness (i. e., stiffness and damping as a function of frequency) of foam cushions with three thicknesses (60, 80, and 100 mm), and the vibration transmitted through these cushions at the seat pan and the <b>backrest</b> were measured with 12 subjects (6 males and 6 females). With increasing thickness, the stiffness and the damping of the foam decreased. With increasing thickness of foam at the seat pan, the resonance frequencies around 4 Hz in the vertical in-line and fore-and-aft cross-axis transmissibilities of the seat pan cushion and the <b>backrest</b> cushion decreased. For the conditions investigated, it is concluded that the thickness of foam at a vertical <b>backrest</b> has little effect on the vertical in-line or fore-and-aft cross-axis transmissibilities of the foam at either the seat pan or the <b>backrest.</b> The frequencies of the primary resonances around 4 Hz in the vertical in-line transmissibility and the fore-and-aft cross-axis transmissibility of foam at the seat pan were highly correlated. Compared to sitting on a rigid seat pan with a foam <b>backrest,</b> sitting with foam at both the seat pan and the <b>backrest</b> reduced the resonance frequency in the vertical in-line transmissibility of the <b>backrest</b> foam and increased the associated transmissibility at resonance, while the fore-and-aft cross-axis transmissibility of the <b>backrest</b> was little affected. Compared to sitting without a <b>backrest,</b> sitting with a rigid vertical <b>backrest</b> increased the resonance frequency of the fore-and-aft cross-axis transmissibility of the seat pan cushion and increased the transmissibility at resonance. Relevance to industry: The transmissibility of a seat is determined by the dynamic properties of the occupant of the seat and the dynamic properties of the seat. This study shows how the thicknesses of foam at a seat pan and foam at a <b>backrest</b> affect the in-line and cross-axis transmissibilities of the foams at the seat pan and the <b>backrest.</b> The findings have application to the design of vehicle seats to minimise the transmission of vibration to the body. </p...|$|R

OBJECTIVES: the aim {{of the study was to}} describe the magnitude of error during the subjective assessment of <b>backrest</b> elevation. METHODS: This prospective study was conducted in a sample of 160 subjects: 97 registered nurses, 48 undergraduate nursing students, and 15 nursing assistants. Data were collected by recording the degrees of <b>backrest</b> elevation identified by the subjects through an individual random presentation of the selected study angles of 20 degrees, 30 degrees, 35 degrees, 40 degrees, and 45 degrees. A measurement instrument was developed for determination of the angles. RESULTS: of the 800 investigated angles, 14. 9 % were estimated accurately, 61. 6 % were overestimated, and 23. 5 % were underestimated, with, an error average of 8 degrees (+/- 13. 5 degrees). It was determined that the larger the angle estimated, the greater the average error. A statically significant difference (P <=. 001) was found between the actual degree of <b>backrest</b> elevation and the estimated <b>backrest</b> elevation for 20 degrees, 40 degrees, and 45 degrees with the exception of 30 degrees and 35 degrees, which had similar averages of error. Years of critical care experience did not significantly influence the magnitude of error. CONCLUSION: the results indicate that the subjective assessment of <b>backrest</b> angle may result in errors that may potentially compromise the patient's condition and supports the need for a more objective method for determining <b>backrest</b> angle.
