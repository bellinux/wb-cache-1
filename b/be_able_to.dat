50|$|As {{children}} refine their motor skills, they <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> {{help themselves}} by completing daily activities independently. For example, {{children between the}} ages of 2 and 3 <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> put on and take off simplistic articles of clothing. They <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> manipulate clothing with zippers, use spoons, string together beads with large holes, and open doors with doorknobs. When children are between the ages of 3 and 4, they <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> manipulate clothing with larger buttons, use scissors to cut paper, and <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> copy simple lined shapes using a pencil. At 4 to 5 years of age, children <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> dress and undress themselves without assistance. They <b>are</b> also <b>able</b> <b>to</b> manipulate a fork, and have gained the dexterity to cut around shapes with a pair of scissors. And by age 6, a child <b>is</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> cut softer foods with a knife and <b>is</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> tie his or her own shoes. Because all children develop at their own rate, the ages given are not an exact timeline.|$|R

5|$|According to Herodotus, the Persian commanders were {{concerned}} {{that they would not}} <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> defeat the Ionian fleet and, therefore, would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> take Miletus. So they sent the exiled Ionian tyrants to Lade, where each tried to persuade his fellow citizens to desert to the Persians. This approach was initially unsuccessful, but in the week-long delay before the battle, divisions arose in the Ionian camp. These divisions led to the Samians secretly agreeing to the terms offered by the Persians, but remained with the other Ionians for the time being.|$|E
50|$|Research {{has also}} {{examined}} whether non-human primates <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> conserve. Chimpanzees <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> make judgements on whether two quantities of liquid {{are the same}} or different, and they <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> conserve correctly when liquids are transformed based on inferences. They <b>are</b> also <b>able</b> <b>to</b> correctly conserve for solid quantities, but they <b>are</b> not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> complete conservation of number tasks. Orangutans <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> differentiate between same and different quantities of liquid but they <b>are</b> only <b>able</b> <b>to</b> pseudoconserve, similar to children in {{the second stage of}} conservation development, and ultimately fail to correctly complete conservation of liquid tasks (see Age of conservation ability).|$|R

5|$|After Flower was {{released}} to critical praise and awards, Chen and Thatgamecompany {{moved on to}} their next game, Journey. Journey was intended by Chen {{to focus on the}} element of communication and social interaction in video games. Since in most games the communication between players is focused on specific goals, in Journey Chen intended for the player to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> either play alone or to come across other players, but not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> communicate with them directly. Instead, players have to build relationships with each other through their actions, helping each other or leaving as they choose. Journey {{was released}} on the PlayStation Network on March 13, 2012, and has received critical acclaim.|$|E
5|$|After Sebastian Vettel's {{surprise}} victory {{two weeks}} prior in Malaysia, {{eyes were on}} Ferrari whether they would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> continue their good race pace in China and challenge the Mercedes for the win. As lower track temperatures were expected for the race, a serious competitiveness of Ferrari was cast into doubt, as they had benefited from lower tyre degradation {{in the heat of}} Malaysia. All ten teams taking part in the championship participated in the race, with Marussia hoping to finally <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> run both cars continually, after Will Stevens had failed to start in Malaysia.|$|E

In addition, while he <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> effortlessly absorb the Boy of Steel's attacks, Holocaust's own punches <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> damage the Kryptonian hero. He was also depicted as being powerful enough to lift Beast Boy over his head while {{in the form of}} a rhinoceros, and <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> knock Miss Martian, a powerful member of the White Martian race, unconscious with a simple backhand.

Finally, he wanted to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> debate complex concepts with them, so he taught them rudimentary theories in physics and geography, tasking them with observing the changing of the seasons, and recording details of sunrises and sunsets.
