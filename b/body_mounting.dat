6000|$|... 'Nathaniel Pipkin's {{heart beat}} high within him, {{when he saw}} this {{enticing}} little couple some hundred yards before him one summer's evening, in the very field {{in which he had}} many a time strolled about till night-time, and pondered on the beauty of Maria Lobbs. But though he had often thought then, how briskly he would walk up to Maria Lobbs and tell her of his passion if he could only meet her, he felt, now that she was unexpectedly before him, all the blood in his <b>body</b> <b>mounting</b> to his face, manifestly to the great detriment of his legs, which, deprived of their usual portion, trembled beneath him. When they stopped to gather a hedge flower, or listen to a bird, Nathaniel Pipkin stopped too, and pretended to be absorbed in meditation, as indeed he really was; for he was thinking what on earth he should ever do, when they turned back, as they inevitably must in time, and meet him face to face. But though he was afraid to make up to them, he couldn't bear to lose sight of them; so when they walked faster he walked faster, when they lingered he lingered, and when they stopped he stopped; and so they might have gone on, until the darkness prevented them, if Kate had not looked slyly back, and encouragingly beckoned Nathaniel to advance. There was something in Kate's manner that was not to be resisted, and so Nathaniel Pipkin complied with the invitation; and after a great deal of blushing on his part, and immoderate laughter on that of the wicked little cousin, Nathaniel Pipkin went down on his knees on the dewy grass, and declared his resolution to remain there for ever, unless he were permitted to rise the accepted lover of Maria Lobbs. Upon this, the merry laughter of Miss Lobbs rang through the calm evening air--without seeming to disturb it, though; it had such a pleasant sound--and the wicked little cousin laughed more immoderately than before, and Nathaniel Pipkin blushed deeper than ever. At length, Maria Lobbs being more strenuously urged by the love-worn little man, turned away her head, and whispered her cousin to say, or at all events Kate did say, that she felt much honoured by Mr. Pipkin's addresses; that her hand and heart were at her father's disposal; but that nobody could be insensible to Mr. Pipkin's merits. As all this was said with much gravity, and as Nathaniel Pipkin walked home with Maria Lobbs, and struggled for a kiss at parting, he went to bed a happy man, and dreamed all night long, of softening old Lobbs, opening the strong box, and marrying Maria.|$|E

50|$|In late 2015, Traxxas {{introduced}} their largest monster {{truck to}} date. The X-Maxx hit the scales at almost 20 pounds. It is almost 30 {{inches long and}} almost 14 inches tall. It was given a new waterproof motor/speed control combo known as the VXL-6S brushless power system. Traxxas debuted the Self-Righting feature in the X-Maxx. This feature allows the user to press {{a button on the}} transmitter that engages the truck. The truck then rocks itself until it is back on all four tires. The X-Maxx also featured an entirely new chassis and suspension setup. Another notable feature that debuted on the X-Maxx is the clipless <b>body</b> <b>mounting</b> system that uses a latch system and not the standard body post and clip design. The X-Maxx was also equipped with Traxxas Stability Management to help users maintain control of the truck in conditions where traction is low.|$|E
50|$|The TS3 {{was used}} in the Commer Avenger Marks II, III and IV PSV chassis, and also in a number of Integral models from John C. Beadle and Thomas Harrington Ltd from 1952-63. Initially these were a sales success, as they were more {{reliable}} and economical than the then-current diesel-engined variant of the Bedford SB, however the noise produced by the TS3 was not acceptable to tours operators and the higher <b>body</b> <b>mounting</b> compared with the SB required extra work for coachbuilders and made the Avenger more expensive than the Bedford. The last straw was in 1957 when Ford announced a PSV version of its Thames Trader, which could take an identical body to the SB and had a conventional six-cylinder diesel engine (which turned out to be quieter than either the TS3 or the Perkins R6 fitted to the SBO). From 1957 Commer Avenger sales began to dwindle. It's notable that Thomas Harrington Ltd never tooled updated versions of its Crusader body for the Avenger, although that is also perhaps due to the conservatism of the combination's sole customer Southdown Motor Services.|$|E
5000|$|With the {{oil crisis}} of 1973, {{it no longer}} seemed {{economically}} viable to power the future high-speed train with fossil fuels. The requirements were changed to fully electric operation, which resulted in an extensive redesign and test program. In April 1974, the Z7001 experimental electric railcar, nicknamed [...] "Zébulon", began trials. Zébulon was rebuilt from the Z7115 which had been wrecked. Using this vehicle, the new Y226 long-wheelbase power truck (precursor of the Y230 of the production TGV) was developed and tested, with its body-mounted traction motors and tripod cardan transmission. <b>Body</b> <b>mounting</b> of the traction motors was a major innovation; it allowed a considerable (3300 kg) reduction in {{the mass of the}} power truck, giving it a very high critical speed and exceptional tracking stability. Zébulon also served to develop a two-stage high speed pantograph, which later became the AM-PSE pantograph of the TGV Sud-Est, as well as a new type of eddy current rail brake. The eddy current rail brake exerts a magnetic retention effort, without ever making contact with the rail. The promise of high efficiency and low wear was however outweighed by problems with overheating in the rail, and the design was dropped. Zébulon's suspension, of a non-pneumatic design, was completely satisfactory so it was adopted for the new high speed train, instead of the TGV 001's pneumatic suspension.|$|E

40|$|Chelating agents offer a {{versatile}} and {{effective means of}} removing toxic metal ions from the human <b>body.</b> <b>Mounting</b> evidence suggests that exposure to nickel and cobalt causes a number of adverse nasal/pulmonary health effects, skin hazards and allergies. In this context, the development of chelators {{that are able to}} bind nickel and cobalt with high stability constants is clearly crucial. Herein, the interaction of cobalt(II) and nickel(II) with a 8 -hydroxyquinoline-cyclodextrin conjugate was investigated in aqueous solution at neutral pH. This family of chelator under study is potentially relevant in the treatment of diseases related to metal dyshomeostasis. Stability constants for the cobalt(II) and nickel(II) complexes were determined by competition experiments. The data indicate the formation of stable complexes, which were characterized by spectroscopic techniques. The collected information may provide new insights and suggest further strategies for the development of hydroxyquinoline derivatives for the control of cobalt and nickel toxicity...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} testing of a portable magnetic system for human motion tracking. Three essential components comprise this system (1) 3 D source, consisting of three orthogonal coils, placed on the body; (2) a compatible 3 D sensor, which is fixed at a remote body segment and measures the fields generated by the source; (3) a processor whose function is to relate the signals from source and sensor. Given the signals from the source and sensor, the position and orientation of the sensor in {{6 degrees of freedom}} (DOF) with respect to the position of the transmitter can be estimated. Coil parameters, such as the radius are optimized for tracking the distance between the lower back and the shoulder of a person. The electronics are designed to run on battery supply, making it suitable for <b>body</b> <b>mounting</b> and ambulatory measurements. The system is tested with functional body movements such as flexion of the back, arm movement and walking. The accuracy of measurements is approximately 8 mm in position and 5 ° in orientation with 6 DOF movements. Results are less accurate during relatively high velocities of the source or sensor due to under sampling. The magnetic tracker will be used as an aiding system for fusion with inertial sensors, therefore, the update rate requirements can be relatively low...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} the force transmission from a rigid <b>body</b> <b>mounting</b> system to a flexible foundation with light and heavy fluid loading under the force and moment excitation. The analytical expression has been derived in which the flexible foundation effects are incorporated into a revised system stiffness matrix that is derived from the receptance matrix at mounting points. A typical case with a thin infinite plate as the foundation has been studied with the point and transfer receptances theoretically and numerically analysed in the case of light and heavy fluid loading. The results show that, compared with the rigid foundation, the force transmission is reduced and system natural frequencies are shifted. The detailed analysis demonstrates that the force reduction and frequency shifting are more obvious at low frequencies where the receptance value is significant. The study is also carried out to compare the transfer receptances from different waves in plate as it couples with water with the objective to simplify the calculation of receptance. It is found that, in the low frequency and after a short distance from driving point, the transfer receptance calculation for the heavy fluid loading can be simplified by only accounting the contribution from free wave which may easily be evaluated from the point receptance in air. It implies the plate response under heavy fluid loading could be directly derived from that with light fluid loading...|$|E
40|$|Manufacturing {{tasks are}} highly {{demanding}} of work, {{and there is}} an especially high prevalence of injury associated with overhead tasks which are taxing to the shoulder and upper body. To assist workers completing these tasks, and to increase overall productivity, safety and effectiveness, we introduce a novel design of Supernumerary Robotic Limb (SRL). This is a robotic arm worn on the shoulder of the technician/- worker which extends the human capability with implicit force control algorithms that allow for intuitive control and interface of the extra robot arm. Affectionately dubbed Aucto, the robotic arm can lift an object and hold it while the wearer is securing the object using a tool with both hands. The worker does not have to take a laborious posture for a long time, reducing fatigue and injuries. Furthermore, a single worker can execute the task, which would otherwise require two workers. Two technical challenges and novel solutions are presented. One is to make the wearable robot simple and lightweight with use of a new type of granular jamming gripper that can grasp diverse objects from an arbitrary direction. This eliminates the need for orienting the gripper against the object with three-axis wrist joints, reducing the number of degrees of freedom (DOF) from 6 to 3. The other is an effective control algorithm that allows the wearer to move freely while the robot on the shoulder is holding an object. Unlike a robot sitting on a floor, the SRL worn by a human is disturbed by the movement of the wearer. An admittance-based control algorithm allows the robot to hold the object stably and securely despite the human movement and changes in posture. A 3 DOF prototype robot with a new granular jamming gripper and an ergonomic <b>body</b> <b>mounting</b> gear is developed and tested. It is demonstrated that the robot can hold a large object securely in the overhead area despite the movement of the wearer while performing an assembly work. by Lawrence 'Zack' Bright. Thesis: S.
