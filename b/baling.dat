40|$|One {{problem in}} {{high-density}} environment {{such as in}} Lae Lae isle, Makassar-Indonesia is the unavailability of shared public space. Lae Lae isle, one small island in front of Makassar city is a densely populated, where 0. 22 km 2 is occupied by 1. 563 people. Common sights in this isle are many people, all generations gathering {{on a bench in}} everywhere, and the bench called <b>Bale</b> <b>bale.</b> It is used by islander for private space and further change into shared place. The aims of this study are to identify the types, characteristics, and activity people on <b>Bale</b> <b>bale.</b> Further to consider about ???sharing system of <b>Bale</b> <b>bale???</b> for shared place. This study is based on a phenomenon in field, so that empirical research study conducted in Lae Lae isle to collect the primary data, secondary data can be obtained by literature study. The field surveys were conducted three times, that is in November 2009, September 2010, and November 2011. The method of field survey included the mapping of the <b>Bale</b> <b>bale???s</b> locations, observing users behaviors, measuring of the <b>Bale</b> <b>bales,</b> documenting of users??? activities by camera, and interviewing the owners and users of the <b>Bale</b> <b>bales.</b> Seventy-two questionnaires were distributed to owners and users of the <b>Bale</b> <b>bales</b> in October 2009. The following are the main findings of this study: (1) There were 225 <b>Bale</b> <b>bales</b> scattered in Lae Lae isle, such as around the dwelling, along the roadside, along the beach, and in others public spaces. A social factor is influence on people use a <b>Bale</b> <b>bale</b> or a bench in a different place.

On 20 and 26 January, escorting bombers on attacks on the strongly defended Vunakanau Airfield and Lakunai Airfield, Aldrich destroyed four Japanese aircraft. Returning from an escort mission, Aldrich and his wingman saw five Zeroes attacking a VMF-215 pilot in the process of <b>baling</b> out, and drove the Zeroes away, enabling the pilot to make a safe landing. On 28 January 1944, he shot down four Zeroes over Tobera and was wounded. His Corsair was too damaged to repair and was written off. On 9 February he downed a Nakajima Ki-44 Tojo south of Tobera, his twentieth victory. Aldrich was the fourth and last Marine ace to reach twenty victories and the fifth highest scoring. His six probables were the highest number of probable victories in the Marine Corps. By the end of the tour, Aldrich had also been awarded the Air Medal. For his actions during the third tour, he was awarded the Navy Cross on 20 July. Aldrich returned home to Chicago on leave after the end of his tour. By May 1944 Aldrich was assigned to VMF-481, training Corsair pilots at Marine Corps Air Station El Toro. In February 1945, his son, Frederick Bruce, was born.|$|E
