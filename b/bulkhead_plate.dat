40|$|Abstract In this master thesis {{we study}} a corner detail between a deck and <b>bulkhead</b> <b>plate,</b> located inside a semi {{submersible}} platform. The platform structure {{is made from}} steel components such as plates, stiffeners, girders, and brackets. The deck is supported by paralel beams which ae supported on columns that {{are connected to the}} bulkhead. The corner detail, where the beam comes across the column, is often exposed to high stresses that can be critical for both the capacity and fatigue life of the structure. A common way of improving this detail is by using brackets, stiffeners and thicker plates. The intention of the thesis is to analyse different shapes of the corner detail, and to determine which one has the largest capacity and best fatigue resistance. Due to the complex geometry of the corner detail, analytical solutions are difficult to find and it is convenient to apply finite element method to obtain the results. Linear elastic theory is used to determine the stress concentration factor and estimate the fatigue life of the structure, for the different types of load cases. A buckling analysis is utilized to determine the first five eigen values, which are further used to introduce an initial shape deflection in the non linear analysis. Three different models of the corner detail, based on Aker Solutions standard details, are created and analyzed. For each detail, different boundary conditions and load cases are applied, in the finite element method software Abaqus. The best model is determined by comparing the results from both the linear and non linear analysis, for every load case, for all three models. Results from the non linear analysis are also compared with hand calculations, in cases where this is possible, while results from the linear analysis are verified by comparison with results for similar details found in literature. Based on the results from these three models, a modification of the corner detail is presented and analyzed in Abaqus with the same boundary conditions and load cases as earlier. The main intention of the modification is to improve the capacity of the detail. The final analysis results are compared with the former three models...|$|E

40|$|The {{nonlinear}} dynamic {{finite element}} code DYnamic Crash Analysis of STructures (DYCAST) {{was used to}} model an accident scenario that occurred at the National Transonic Facility (NTF) wind tunnel. A post mishap investigation revealed that {{a total of five}} upstream <b>bulkhead</b> fairing <b>plates</b> were missing, three in one location and two in another. These plates were drawn into the wind tunnel's composite fan blades causing extensive damage. A DYCAST model was developed to determine if one-half of a small thermal shield flange clamp, weighing approximately 2. 7 lbs., could have spun off the NTF drive shaft and impacted the <b>bulkhead</b> fairing <b>plates</b> with sufficient energy to cause failure of the attachment bolts. The clamp was presumed to have spun off at a tangent from the NTF drive shaft at a velocity of 1624 in/sec (drive shaft rotating at 580 rpm).

Some {{of the advantages}} are excellent stability, Cruise in shallow water, large wide deck areas, large load carrying capacity, faster and Motion comfort etc. In this paper work, design of main or strength deck and Bulkhead structural member calculations for Catamaran ship used for transport for the crane (Mantis ® 10010 mx 46 ton tele-boom crawler crane) to its place of work. Ship’s main deck or Strength deck hull structural scantlings or calculations play a very vital role in carrying the deck loads such as crane load safely against the external pressures which are acting on the deck. This can done by designing the suitable deck and hull plate thickness, and it’s strengthening stiffening. The design of main deck involves determination of scantlings of deck plate, deck plate stiffeners, girders, pillars, Bulkhead and its stiffeners against the wheel load. Scantlings of deck and <b>Bulkhead</b> <b>plates,</b> stiffeners and girders to meet the local strength requirements are to be determined {{in accordance with the}} general principles of the rules.

40|$|Tank {{floors of}} large storage tanks are {{regularly}} inspected for bottom side corrosion utilizing the magnetic flux exclusion (MFE) nondestructive testing technique.

40|$|The Australian Maritime Engineering Cooperative Research Centre, and its partner {{organisation}} initiated this research effort. In particular, BHP and the Defence Science and Technology Organisation held the principal interest, as this research effort {{was a part}} of the investigation into the utilisation of X- 80 steel in naval platforms. After some initial considerations, this research effort focussed on the development of X- 80 steel blast tolerant transverse bulkheads. Unfortunately, due to the Australian Maritime Engineering Cooperative Research Centre not being re-funded after June 2000 and other project factors, the planned blast tests were not conducted, hence this research effort focussed on the tools needed for the formation of optimised blast tolerant transverse bulkheads rather than on the development of a single structural arrangement. Design criteria were formed from the worst case operational requirements for a transverse bulkhead, which would experience a 150 kg equivalent blast load at 8 m from the source. Since the development of any optimised blast tolerant structure had to be carried out using finite element analysis, material constants for X- 80 steel under high strain rates were obtained. These material constants were implemented in the finite element analysis and the appropriate solid element size was evolved. The behaviour and effects of stress waves and high strain rates were considered and the literature reviewed, in particular consideration was given to joint structures and weld areas effects on the entire structural response to a blast load. Furthermore, to support the design criteria, rupture prediction and determination methodologies have been investigated and recommendations developed about their relevance. Since the response of transverse bulkheads is significantly affected by their joint and stiffener arrangements, separate investigations of these structures were undertaken. The outcomes of these investigations led to improvements in the blast tolerance behaviour of joints and stiffeners, which also improved the overall response of the transverse bulkhead to air blast loads. Finally, an optimisation procedure was developed that met all the design criteria and its relevant requirements. This optimisation procedure was implemented with the available data, to show the potential to develop optimised X- 80 steel blast tolerant transverse bulkheads. Due to the constraints mentioned above the optimisation procedure was restricted, but did show progression towards more effective blast tolerant transverse bulkhead designs. Factors, such as double skin <b>bulkheads,</b> maximising <b>plate</b> separation, and the use of higher yield steel all showed to be beneficial in the development of optimal X- 80 steel blast tolerant transverse bulkheads, when compared to the ANZACclass D- 36 steel transverse bulkheads...|$|R
40|$|The {{deck load}} {{capacity}} of new offshore platforms is increasing as these marine structures {{continue to increase}} in size. As a consequence, the structural weight has become a concern. The current investigation contributes to a solution of a more weight-effective structural design of shell-plated marine structures. The structural weight of a shell-plated structure can be reduced in various ways. In the current investigation, an alternative design is presented {{by means of a}} corrugated structure. By the introduction of corrugated panels, a structure may be constructed lighter and cheaper compared to traditional structures with stiffened panels. The welding work during manufacturing can also be reduced substantially. Even though the idea of using corrugated shell plating has been practiced in various applications for a long time, such as in corrugated <b>bulkhead</b> and deck <b>plating,</b> it is yet unexplored in shell structures. Thus, the aim with this study is to compare corrugated shell plating with conventional stiffened panels with respect to strength, weight and cost. A methodology is presented where various solutions are analyzed and compared with regard to strength characteristics, weight and cost. Here, strength characteristics include ultimate tensile strength, buckling stability and fatigue life calculations. Detailed numerical analyses are presented using a realistic and reasonable area of a panel structure of an offshore platform. The structure analyses are carried out using linear finite element analyses. A number of design criteria have been evaluated and verified by comparing predictions obtained in an extensive parametric study of basic structural strength following classification rules. Two alternative designs with corrugated shell plating are proposed with respect to corrugation symmetry. The first one had unequal flanges and the same thickness as that of the reference stiffened model. The second had equal flange lengths. The weight reduction values achieved using these designs were 38 percent and 59 percent in shell plating, respectively, compared with a reference model for traditional stiffened shell plating. The study concluded with a reduction in production costs by 35 percent and 49 percent, respectively. The investigation clearly demonstrates that corrugated panels are often favourable for lightweight design and manufacturing robustness of marine structures...|$|R
