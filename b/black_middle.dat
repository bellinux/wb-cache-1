5|$|The Chilembwe {{uprising}} was {{a rebellion}} against British colonial rule in Nyasaland (modern-day Malawi) in January 1915, led by John Chilembwe, an American-educated Baptist minister, whose radical evangelical views of racial injustice {{may also have}} been influenced by millenarian Christian. Based around his church in the village of Mbombwe in the south-east of the country, the revolt was centred on the <b>black</b> <b>middle</b> class and encouraged by grievances against the colonial system, including forced labour, discrimination and the new demands on the indigenous population caused by the outbreak of World War I.|$|E

25|$|Works by VanDerZee are artistic {{as well as}} {{technically}} proficient. His {{work was}} in high demand, {{in part due to}} his experimentation and skill in double exposures and in retouching negatives of children. One theme that recurs in his photographs was the emergent <b>black</b> <b>middle</b> class, which he captured using traditional techniques in often idealistic images. Negatives were retouched to show glamor and an aura of perfection. This affected the likeness of the person photographed, but he felt each photo should transcend the subject.|$|E

25|$|The Pullman Company {{was also}} {{noted for its}} porters. The company hired black men almost {{exclusively}} for the porter positions (Men of Filipino descent were primarily hired for club car service positions). Although a porter's occupation was menial in some respects, it offered better pay and security than most jobs open to African Americans at the time, {{as well as an}} opportunity to travel the country. Many credit Pullman porters as significantly contributing to the development of America's <b>black</b> <b>middle</b> class. In 1925, Pullman porters became unionized as the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters (BSCP), founded by A. Philip Randolph. At one time Pullman was the largest employer of African Americans in the United States.|$|E
25|$|For many years, Compton {{was a much}} sought-after suburb for the <b>black</b> <b>middle</b> {{class of}} Los Angeles. This past affluence is {{reflected}} in the area's appearance—Compton's streets are lined with relatively spacious and attractive single family houses. However, several factors have contributed to Compton's gradual decline. One of the most significant factors was a steady erosion of its tax base, something that was already sparse due to limited commercial properties. In later years, there were middle-class whites who fled to the newly incorporated cities of Artesia, Bellflower, Cerritos, Paramount and Norwalk in the late 1950s. These nearby communities remained largely white early on despite integration. This white middle class flight accelerated following the 1965 Watts Riots and the 1992 Los Angeles riots.|$|E
25|$|Haiti elected its National Assembly in May 1946. The Assembly set 16 August 1946, as {{the date}} on which it would select a president. The leading {{candidates}} for the office—all of whom were black—were Dumarsais Estimé, a former school teacher, assembly member, and cabinet minister under Vincent; Félix d'Orléans Juste Constant, leader of the Haitian Communist Party (Parti Communiste d'Haïti—PCH); and former Garde commander Démosthènes Pétrus Calixte, who stood as the candidate of a progressive coalition that included the Worker Peasant Movement (Mouvement Ouvrier Paysan—MOP). MOP chose to endorse Calixte, instead of a candidate from its own ranks, because the party's leader, Daniel Fignolé, was only twenty-six years old—too young to stand for the nation's highest office. Estimé, politically the most moderate of the three, drew support from the black population in the north, {{as well as from}} the emerging <b>black</b> <b>middle</b> class. The leaders of the military, who would not countenance the election of Juste Constant and who reacted warily to the populist Fignolé, also considered Estimé the safest candidate. After two rounds of polling, legislators gave Estimé the presidency.|$|E

500|$|Historian Glenn Eskew {{wrote that}} the {{campaign}} [...] "led to an awakening to the evils of segregation and a need for reforms in the region." [...] The <b>black</b> <b>middle</b> class generally assumed leadership in Birmingham and the SCLC, and the black underclass still struggled. According to Eskew, the riots that occurred after {{the bombing of the}} Gaston Motel foreshadowed rioting in larger cities later in the 1960s. ACMHR vice president Abraham Woods claimed that the rioting in Birmingham set a precedent for the [...] "Burn, baby, burn" [...] mindset, a cry used in later civic unrest in the Watts Riots, the 12th Street riots in Detroit, and other American cities in the 1960s. A study of the Watts riots concluded, [...] "The 'rules of the game' in race relations were permanently changed in Birmingham." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1916, Waco, Texas, was {{a prosperous}} {{city with a}} {{population}} of more than 30,000. After it became associated with crime in the 19th century, community leaders sought to change its reputation, sending delegations across the U.S. to promote it as an idyllic locale. By the 1910s, Waco's economy had become strong and the city had gained a pious reputation. A <b>black</b> <b>middle</b> class had emerged in the area, along with two black colleges. In the mid-1910s, blacks comprised about twenty percent of the Waco population. In her 2006 study of lynching, journalist Patricia Bernstein describes the city as then having a [...] "thin veneer" [...] of peace and respectability. Racial tension was present in the city: local newspapers often emphasized crimes committed by African Americans, and Sank Majors, a black man, was hanged from a bridge near downtown Waco in 1905. A small number of anti-lynching activists lived in the area, including the president of Waco's Baylor University. In 1916, several factors led to an increase in local racism, including the screening of The Birth of a Nation, a movie that promoted white supremacy and glorified the Ku Klux Klan, and the sale of photographs of a recently lynched black man in Temple, Texas.|$|E

2500|$|Duvalier's policies, {{designed}} {{to end the}} dominance of the mulatto elite over the nation's economic and political life, led to massive emigration of educated people, deepening Haiti's economic and social problems.

2500|$|Ian <b>Black,</b> <b>Middle</b> East {{editor at}} The Guardian, writes [...] "Controversy {{about the book}} flows largely from the word [...] "apartheid" [...] in the title: it is wrong if applied to Israel within its pre-1967 borders, where there is {{discrimination}} but not institutionalised racism. In the West Bank, with its confiscated land, unequal allocation of water resources, fortress-like settlements, security fence and segregated roads, it is fitting enough.

Efraim Karsh is among the few historians who still consider {{that most of the}} Arabs who fled left of their own accord or were pressured to leave by their fellow Arabs, despite Israeli attempts to convince them to stay.

40|$|Qualitative {{research}} {{on education and}} aspirations has been produced with the sole focus on the reproduction of class inequalities within a White middle class structure. There has only been {{a handful of studies}} of analytic engagement with <b>Black</b> professional <b>middle</b> class parents' expectations and aspirations regarding their children's futures in Britain. This gap creates an opportunity for new research to gain deeper insight into what decisions and choices are made by <b>Black</b> professional <b>middle</b> class parents and bring to light important knowledge of professional middle class educational attainment. The research presented here explored how <b>Black</b> professional <b>middle</b> class parents’ construct strategic approaches towards creating better futures for their children within a predominantly White middle class structure. Drawing on primary data taken from interviews with 25 Black African and <b>Black</b> Caribbean <b>middle</b> class parents’ (half from African or Caribbean heritage), this thesis analyses parents’ strategic decision making and navigation in an unequal playing field of education. Findings indicate adaptations of Bourdieu’s social, cultural and economic capitals to prepare and engage their children along certain pathways in order to create aspirational opportunities. Using Critical Race Theory (CRT) it is argued that while class is very influential in explaining educational attainment, understanding <b>Black</b> professional <b>middle</b> class parents’ aspirations for their children requires a deeper understanding of race. Evidence from in-depth narratives provided an insight into parents' own biographies that were either originally working or middle class backgrounds in shaping their orientations to, and manner of engagement with, their children's futures. Drawing from the data middle class parents were beginning to be geographically mobile, moving out of inner London areas in search of a better quality of life for their children and a preferred school choice – with a higher quality of education found around the surrounding areas of London and the South East suburbs. Parents’ subjective biographies illustrated diverse parenting practices and values such as those sets of parents using their Christian faith to help build a solid foundation for moral values, self-confidence and respectability. The research offers new insights into the choices made and strategic approaches used to nurture high aspirations for <b>Black</b> professional <b>middle</b> class children’s futures...|$|R
