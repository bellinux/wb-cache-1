50|$|Because a {{particle}} beam has a finite emittance, this effect {{was used in}} cyclotrons and early synchrotrons to prevent the growth of deviations from the desired particle orbit. Due to its definition, it also occurs in the dipole magnets of modern accelerator facilities and {{must be considered in}} beam optics calculations. In modern facilities, most of the beam focusing is usually done by quadrupole magnets, using Strong focusing to enable smaller <b>beam</b> <b>sizes</b> and vacuum chambers, thus reducing the average magnet size.|$|E
50|$|The nuclear microprobe's beam {{is usually}} {{composed}} of protons and alpha particles. Some {{of the most}} advanced nuclear microprobes have beam energies in excess of 2 MeV. This gives the device very high sensitivity to minute concentrations of elements, around 1 ppm at <b>beam</b> <b>sizes</b> smaller than 1 micrometer. This elemental sensitivity exists because when the beam interacts with the a sample it gives off characteristic X-rays of each element present in the sample. This type of detection of radiation is called PIXE. Other analysis techniques are applied to nuclear microscopy including Rutherford backscattering(RBS), STIM, etc.|$|E

50|$|Barns {{serve as}} one of the most common sources for {{reclaimed}} wood in the United States. Those constructed up through the early part of the 19th century were typically built using whatever trees were growing on or near the property. They often contain a mix of oak, chestnut, poplar, hickory and pine timber. <b>Beam</b> <b>sizes</b> were limited to what could be moved by man and horse. The wood was either hand hewn using an axe or squared with an adze. Early settlers also recognized the oak from experience with its European subspecies. Soon red, white, black, scarlet, willow, post and pin oak varieties were being cut and transformed into barns too.|$|E
50|$|A buckling-restrained brace (BRB) {{consists}} of a steel core surrounded by a hollow steel section, coated with a low-friction material, and then grouted with a specialized mortar. The encasing and mortar prohibit the steel core from buckling when in compression, while the coating prevents axial load from being transferred to the encasement, thus preventing strength loss and allowing for better and more symmetric cyclic performance. These elements most commonly brace a bay diagonally or in a chevron pattern. Because maximum tension and compression forces in a BRB are much closer than in a standard brace, there is much less imbalance of force in the chevron configuration resulting in smaller <b>beam</b> <b>sizes</b> than a standard braced frame.|$|E
50|$|Buckling-restrained braces have energy {{dissipative}} {{behavior that}} is much improved from that of Special Concentrically Braced Frames (SCBFs). Also, because their behavior factor is {{higher than that of}} most other seismic systems (R=8), and the buildings are typically designed with an increased fundamental period, the seismic loads are typically lower. This in turn can lead to a reduction in member (column and <b>beam)</b> <b>sizes,</b> smaller and simpler connections, and smaller foundation demands. Also, BRBs are usually faster to erect than SCBFs, resulting in cost savings to the contractor. Additionally, BRBs can be used in seismic retrofitting. Finally, {{in the event of an}} earthquake, since the damage is concentrated over a relatively small area (the brace's yielding core), post-earthquake investigation and replacement is relatively easy.|$|E
40|$|The Fermilab Electron Cooling Project {{requires}} a straight trajectory and constant <b>beam</b> <b>size</b> to provide maximum cooling of the antiprotons in the Recycler.

40|$|When using a commonly-used quadri-wave lateral {{shearing}} interferometer wavefront sensor (QWLSI WFS) for <b>beam</b> <b>size</b> {{measurements on}} a high power CO 2 laser, artefacts have been observed in the measured irradiance distribution. The grating in the QWLSI WFS not only generates the diffracted first orders that are required for introducing the shear, but also diffracts significantly into higher orders. Consequently, in the few millimeters of free space propagation between the QWLSI WFS grating and its imaging device, the <b>beam</b> <b>size</b> may increase significantly (particularly for infrared wavelengths). This error is typically not accounted for in the subsequent processing of measurement data. To gain insight in this undesirable behavior, physical models of the QWLSI WFS using both complex wave propagation and analytic propagation of the D 4 sigma beam diameter (and its associated M 2) throughout the system have been developed. These models show excellent agreement to experimental data, and indicate that in typical situations the sensor-induced <b>beam</b> <b>size</b> error can easily be 40 % or more. Although the QWLSI WFS may not originally be intended for <b>beam</b> <b>size</b> measurements, in most industrial applications cost- and volume limitations will often lead to multiple use of sensor data. To aid in the adequate implementation of a QWLSI WFS for determining <b>beam</b> <b>size,</b> the dependence of the sensor-induced <b>beam</b> <b>size</b> error on various system parameters has been determined (e. g. incoming <b>beam</b> <b>size,</b> grating-to-imager distance, grating geometry, wavelength).

40|$|The Optical Diffraction Radiation is {{generated}} when a charged particle bunch passes by an inhomogeneous boundaries, {{and is considered}} as the wakefield of a beam bunch. By using a tilted conducting slit, we can observe the interference pattern of the backward scattered optical diffraction radiation, which gives the transverse <b>beam</b> <b>size</b> information. Because the aperture of the slit is 10 times or more larger than the transverse <b>beam</b> <b>size,</b> this <b>beam</b> <b>size</b> monitor is non-invasive, which is essential to minimize the beam loss in <b>beam</b> <b>size</b> monitoring. The ratio of the photon intensity peak of the interference pattern of the optical diffractive radiation and that at {{the valley of the}} photon intensity gives the information of the transverse <b>beam</b> <b>size.</b> Most of the experiments on the optical diffractive radiation has been done only recently with electron beams up to around 1 GeV at TTF(Tesla), and at ATF(KEK). The γ factor of 5. 8 × 104 allows us to use larger aperture size, with the 29 GeV e-/e+ at the SLAC FFTB(Final Focus Test Beam) which contributes to reduce the background photons significantly.

40|$|The {{coordinate}} {{and energy}} distributions {{of the electron}} beam density at the Advanced Light Source have been obtained from measurements of the beam lifetime at various storage-ring apertures in the horizontal and vertical planes.

40|$|A {{non-destructive}} {{method for}} determining the electron beam transverse emittance at the Amsterdam Pulse Stret-cher (AmPS) ring and the Dortmund Electron Test Acceler-ator (DELTA) is described. The emittance is calculated by measuring the beta functions and the electron beam trans-verse profiles. Monitoring of the horizontal and vertical tune shifts by wobbeling one of the machine quadrupoles provides the beta functions. The beam profile is obtained by scanning the electron beam with a laser beam and mea-suring the Compton scattered photons downstream from the interaction point. The goal is to measure the emittance with an accuracy of better than 20 %. This method has been chosen because of the comparatively small <b>beam</b> <b>sizes</b> at DELTA and the wide range in beam size of an order of mag-nitude needed to be covered. At present estimated <b>beam</b> <b>sizes</b> at AmPS are {{of the order of}} a fraction of 1 mm.

40|$|A beam profile monitor {{utilizing}} visible {{synchrotron radiation}} (SR) from a bending magnet {{has been designed}} and installed in Cornell Electron-Positron Storage Ring (CESR). The monitor employs a double-slit interferometer to measure both the horizontal and vertical <b>beam</b> <b>sizes</b> {{over a wide range}} of beam currents. By varying the separation of the slits, <b>beam</b> <b>sizes</b> ranging from 50 to 500 um can be measured with a resolution of approximately 5 um. To measure larger beam size (> 500 um), direct imaging can be employed by rotating the double slits away from SR beam path. By imaging the pi-polarized component of SR, a small vertical beam size (~ 70 um) was measured during an undulator test run in CESR, which was consistent with the interferometer measurement. To measure the bunch length, a beam splitter is inserted to direct a fraction of light into a streak camera setup.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the new term {{apparent}} <b>beam</b> <b>size</b> of Focused Ion Beam (FIB) is introduced and an original method of its evaluation is demonstrated. Traditional methods of measuring the <b>beam</b> <b>size,</b> like the knife edge method, {{provide information about}} the quality of the beam itself but practically they do not give information on the FIB sputtering resolution. To do this, it is necessary to take into account the material dependant interaction of the beam with the specimen and the gas precursor in the vacuum chamber. The apparent <b>beam</b> <b>size</b> can be regarded as the smallest possible dot that FIB can sputter in a given specimen. The method of evaluating it, developed in this paper, is based on the analysis of a series of scanning electron images of FIB produced nanodots. Results show that the apparent <b>beam</b> <b>size</b> can be up to 5 times larger than the actual physical <b>size</b> of the <b>beam</b> and it is significantly influenced by the presence of gas precursor.
