50|$|The <b>BNC</b> (Bayonet Neill-Concelman) <b>connector</b> is a {{miniature}} quick connect/disconnect radio frequency connector used for coaxial cable. It features two bayonet lugs on the female connector; mating is fully achieved with a quarter {{turn of the}} coupling nut. <b>BNC</b> <b>connectors</b> are used with miniature-to-subminiature coaxial cable in radio, television, and other radio-frequency electronic equipment, test instruments, and video signals. The BNC was commonly used for early computer networks, including ARCnet, the IBM PC Network, and the 10BASE2 variant of Ethernet. <b>BNC</b> <b>connectors</b> are made to match the characteristic impedance of cable at either 50 ohms or 75 ohms. They are usually applied for frequencies below 4 GHz and voltages below 500 volts.|$|R
5000|$|The TNC (Threaded Neill-Concelman) {{connector}} is a threaded {{version of}} the <b>BNC</b> <b>connector.</b> The connector has a 50 Ω impedance and operates best in the 0 - 11 GHz frequency spectrum.

Invented in the late 1950s and named after Paul Neill of Bell Labs and Carl Concelman of Amphenol, the TNC connector has been employed {{in a wide range}} of radio and wired applications.|$|E

50|$|In the USSR, <b>BNC</b> <b>connectors</b> were copied as SR connectors. As {{a result}} of recalculating from {{imperial}} to metric measurements their dimensions differ slightly from those of BNC. They are however generally interchangeable with them, sometimes with force applied.|$|R
50|$|While {{working at}} Hazeltine Corporation, Dr. Salati was awarded United States patent #2,540,012 {{which was the}} basis for what is now {{commonly}} known as the <b>BNC</b> <b>connector.</b> The patent for Electrical Connector was filed May 19, 1945, and issued January 30, 1951. BNC is an acronym for Bayonet Neill-Concelman. The <b>BNC</b> <b>connector</b> is still in common use for coaxial cables that carry high frequency currents between pieces of electronics and communications equipment. Canadian patent #487446 was also awarded to Dr. Salati for this invention on October 21, 1952.|$|E
