It {{was founded in}} 2008 as a co-journal of the eLanguage {{publishing}} platform the LSA developed, but became a full journal {{in its own right}} in 2013 with the discontinuation of eLanguage. The goal of the new publication was to not only publish articles, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so with the advances in open publishing including fast turnaround times and free and open access.|$|E
5|$|By 1889, Manmohan had {{determined}} {{to pursue a}} literary career and Benoybhusan had proved himself unequal to the standards necessary for ICS entrance. This meant that only Aurobindo might fulfil his father's aspirations <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so when his father lacked money required that he studied hard for a scholarship. To become an ICS official, students were required to pass the competitive examination, {{as well as to}} study at an English university for two years under probation. Aurobindo secured a scholarship at King's College, Cambridge, under recommendation of Oscar Browning. He passed the written ICS examination after a few months, being ranked 11th out of 250 competitors. He spent the next two years at King's College. Aurobindo had no interest in the ICS and came late to the horse-riding practical exam purposefully to get himself disqualified for the service.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{the only}} other {{scenario}} writer on the project was Yūto Tonokawa of Key, who previously contributed on Key's sixth game Little Busters!. Tanaka was tasked with drawing up the entire scenario framework, and during this time, Takahiro Baba suggested that one more heroine route {{be added to the}} story to bring the total to six, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that they had to hire another writer. Ryukishi07 of 07th Expansion, the creators of the Higurashi no Naku Koro ni and Umineko no Naku Koro ni game franchises, was brought in as the third scenario writer after Baba suggested in late 2007 that Key ask him to join the staff for Rewrite. Ultimately, Tanaka wrote the story leading up to the heroine's routes, Kotori's and Akane's scanarios, the Moon and Terra routes, and the bonus Oppai route. Tonokawa wrote Chihaya's and Sizuru's routes, and Ryukishi07 wrote Lucia's story. Tanaka initially planned on the length of Rewrites story to be on about the same scale as Key's second game Air, but as it increased in size, he later attempted to keep it close to the scale of Little Busters!.|$|E

25|$|Unlike most of Australia, where {{exploration}} typically went inland {{from the}} sea, the Gippsland region was first explored and settled by Europeans who came overland from the Monaro region of New South Wales {{and headed down}} to the coastal regions. This could perhaps {{be seen as a}} natural expansion of the first settlements of Australia radiating out from Sydney, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so the settlers had to cross the not insignificant barrier of the Australian Alps.|$|E
25|$|These {{goals for}} {{structural}} change could have improved {{the efficiency of}} resource allocation while doing {{a great deal to}} lessen poverty. But the goals clearly required both time and the ability to restore expansion without worsening inflation and external deficits. The government initially emphasized such macroeconomic objectives as necessary conditions for the structural changes. The first step was to stop the built-in inflationary process, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it without adopting orthodox measures of monetary and fiscal restraint.|$|E

25|$|To not be jostled out of {{the saddle}} and to not harm the horse by {{bouncing}} on its back, riders must learn specific skills in order to sit the trot. Most riders learn to sit a slow jog trot without bouncing. A skilled rider can ride a powerfully extended trot without bouncing, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so requires well-conditioned back and abdominal muscles, and to do so for long periods is tiring for even experienced riders. A fast, uncollected, racing trot, such as that of the harness racing horse, is virtually impossible to sit.|$|E

The inventor wants to bring Coppélia to life <b>but,</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that, he needs a human sacrifice. With a magic spell, he will take Franz's spirit and transfer it to Coppélia. After Dr. Coppelius proffers him some wine laced with sleeping powder, Franz begins to fall asleep. The inventor then readies his magic spell.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} {{hoped that}} private shipyards {{would be able}} to build the ships on a fixed-cost basis. This {{turned out not to be}} the case; the shipbuilding industry was less enthusiastic than anticipated. Moreover, none of the shipyards being considered for the work had the facilities to build the fast ferries. BC Ferries had no choice <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the work itself on a cost-plus basis. It would have to act as project manager and assume the risk of the fast ferries. Catamaran Ferries International (CFI), a wholly owned subsidiary of BC Ferries, was incorporated in March 1996 to carry out the work and construction started later that year.|$|E

25|$|Two years later, astronomers Roger G. Clowes and Luis E.

In April 2003, another large-scale structure was discovered, the Sloan Great Wall. In August 2007, a possible supervoid was detected in the constellation Eridanus. It coincides with the 'CMB cold spot', a cold region in the microwave sky that is highly improbable under the currently favored cosmological model. This supervoid could cause the cold spot, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so it would have to be improbably big, possibly a billion light-years across, almost as big as the Giant Void mentioned above.|$|E
25|$|Booster is {{originally}} {{based in}} Superman's home city, Metropolis. He starts his hero career by preventing the shapeshifting assassin Chiller, an operative of The 1000, from killing the President of the United States and replacing him. With the subsequent public exposure, Booster signs {{a multitude of}} commercial and movie deals. During his career, his sister Michelle Carter, powered by a magnetic suit, follows in his footsteps as the superheroine Goldstar. Booster is devastated when she dies battling creatures from another dimension. Amassing a small fortune, Booster founds Goldstar, Inc. (later Booster Gold International) as a holding company and hires Dirk Davis to act as his agent. During the Millennium event, Davis reveals {{that he is a}} Manhunter in disguise and that he siphoned money from Booster's accounts in hopes of leaving him no choice <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the Manhunters' bidding. Although the Manhunters are ultimately defeated, Booster is left bankrupt.|$|E
25|$|Linda Sharp was {{the head}} coach, with Colleen Riley serving as the {{assistant}} coach of the team representing the USA at the World University Games held in Zagreb, Yugoslavia in July 1987. The team {{started out with a}} 35-point victory over Poland and followed that with a 41-point victory over Finland. In the third game, the USA faced the host team Yugoslavia. The USA hit a high percentage of their shots from the free throw line, 16 of 19, but the Yugoslav team earned 43 shots from the line, of which they made 34. With a home crowd behind them, the game came down to the wire, and was tied at the end of regulation. In overtime, Yugoslavia out scored the USA and won the game 93–89. The USA still had a chance {{to make it to the}} medal round, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so had to win their next game against China, and do so by at least five points. The USA fell behind, and were down 16 points at halftime. They fell behind by 20 at one point, but made up the deficit and more in the second half. They went on to win the game, but by only a single point 84–83. They won their final game against Canada, but this left them in fifth place, the first time ever the USA team did not win a medal at the World University Games.|$|E

500|$|Historical {{analysis}} of the battle has praised Barlow's conduct: his tactics of refusing to allow the French ship to come alongside and board his vessel, thereby turning the French superiority in numbers into a disadvantage was commended by William James, and historian Tom Wareham has noted that the standing British practice of firing into enemy hulls {{rather than at the}} rigging as practiced by the French gave Barlow an advantage against the crowded decks of Africaine. Saulnier too has been praised for his efforts to avoid combat with his ship so overladen and for the subsequent valour with which his crew and their passengers fought so fiercely for two hours against mounting odds and in the face of [...] "truly dreadful" [...] casualties, although he was also subject to criticism in France when it emerged that he had removed the quoins from his guns in an effort to force his men to fire at the British rigging rather than the hull: Bonaparte ordered that in future his ships intended [...] "not to dismast the enemy, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> him as much harm as possible." ...|$|E
