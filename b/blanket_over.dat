5|$|Witnesses {{reported}} {{that as the}} plane approached Detroit, Abdulmutallab went into the plane's lavatory for about 20 minutes. After returning to his seat at 19A (near the fuel tanks and wing, and against {{the skin of the}} plane), he complained that he had an upset stomach. He was seen pulling a <b>blanket</b> <b>over</b> himself.|$|E
5|$|As {{soldiers}} {{approached the}} sacristy, {{one of the}} young sons of defender Anthony Wolf stood to pull a <b>blanket</b> <b>over</b> his shoulders. In the dark, Mexican soldiers mistook him for an adult and killed him. Possibly the last Texian to die in battle was Jacob Walker, who attempted to hide behind Susannah Dickinson and was bayoneted in front of the women. Another Texian, Brigido Guerrero, also sought refuge in the sacristy. Guerrero, who had deserted from the Mexican Army in December 1835, was spared after convincing the soldiers he was a Texian prisoner.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Garridos arrived at their home in an unincorporated area in Contra Costa County, they had removed Dugard's clothing, leaving only a butterfly-shaped ring that she hid from them for the next 18 years. Taking her from their car onto their property, Garrido placed a <b>blanket</b> <b>over</b> Dugard's head and ushered her into an area of his {{backyard}} where sheds and storage units stood, placing her inside a tiny one that was soundproofed. After he finished raping {{her for the first}} time he left her naked in the structure, which he bolted shut, warning her that Doberman Pinschers were outside and trained to attack her if she tried to escape. Garrido would visit her in the structure, bringing her food and milkshakes, and talking to her.|$|E

5|$|Though {{breeding}} can {{be improved}} by supplementary feeding, the survival of young kakapo is hampered {{by the presence of}} Polynesian rats. Of 21 chicks that hatched between 1981 and 1994, nine were either killed by rats or died and were subsequently eaten by rats. Nest protection has been intensified since 1995 by using traps and poison stations as soon as a nest had been detected. A small video camera and infra-red light source watch the nest continuously, and will scare approaching rats with flashing lights and loud popping sounds. To increase the success rate of nesting, a nest watcher places a small thermostatically controlled electric <b>blanket</b> <b>over</b> the eggs or chicks, whenever the female leaves the nest for food. The survival rate of chicks has increased from 29% in unprotected nests to 75% in protected ones.|$|E
25|$|Noble often mimes actions on-stage to {{help the}} {{audience}} visualise his surreal ideas, for example, telling the audience to never put a <b>blanket</b> <b>over</b> an owl, and exactly what an owl neck detection device is ("just a stick with a pointy bit on it") or showing the audience how to serve double header ice creams properly after considering his own made-up plot of 24 in which Jack Bauer escapes a cell using a greasy goose.|$|E
25|$|During a chili cook-off he was hosting at Vortex Spring in December, Kelly {{reportedly}} {{fell down}} the stairs and hurt his head. A person present took him to his home in Ponce de Leon, where he helped Kelly shower and, afterwards, put a <b>blanket</b> <b>over</b> him and left him to rest in the bathtub. In the morning, a different person came to the house, and found his condition had worsened overnight. Emergency medical services responded to a call and took him to a hospital in Pensacola.|$|E
6000|$|The {{wind blew}} gray {{out of the}} north--a wild blast which stopped the young student's blood in his veins. He hated to give up, but {{he could no longer}} hold the <b>blankets</b> <b>over</b> his knees, so he slipped down into the corner of the box, {{with his back to the}} wind, while Mattie drew the <b>blankets</b> <b>over</b> his head, slapped the reins down on the backs of the {{snorting}} horses, and encouraged them with shouts like a man: [...] "Get out o' this, Dan! Hup there, Nellie!" ...|$|R

25|$|Wet {{chemical}} (potassium acetate, potassium carbonate, or potassium citrate) extinguishes {{the fire}} by forming an air-excluding soapy foam <b>blanket</b> <b>over</b> the burning oil through the chemical process of saponification (an alkali reacting with a fat {{to form a}} soap) and by the water content cooling the oil below its ignition temperature. Generally class A and K (F in Europe) only, although older models also achieved class B and C fire-fighting capability in the past, current models are rated A:K (Amerex, Ansul, Buckeye and Strike First) or K only (Badger/Kidde).|$|E
25|$|In some sectors brewers are {{reluctant}} to embrace new technology for fear of losing the traditional characteristics of their beer. For example, Marston's Brewery in Burton on Trent still uses open wooden Burton Union sets for fermentation {{in order to maintain}} the quality and flavour of its beers, while Belgium's lambic brewers go so far as to expose their brews to outside air in order to pick up the natural wild yeasts which ferment the wort. Traditional brewing techniques protect the beer from oxidation by maintaining a carbon dioxide <b>blanket</b> <b>over</b> the wort as it ferments into beer.|$|E
500|$|At about 02:30 on April 5, Kennedy {{discovered}} Walinsky asleep {{over his}} typewriter and Greenfield {{passed out on}} his bed. Kennedy pulled a <b>blanket</b> <b>over</b> Greenfield, who awoke and said, [...] "You aren't so ruthless after all." [...] Kennedy responded, [...] "Don't tell anyone." [...] Later in the morning, Walinsky and Greenfield inserted Sorenson's contributions and finished the speech (mostly the work of Walinsky).|$|E
50|$|The first legislature, {{along with}} several {{subsequent}} gatherings, drew criticism for a perceived lack of representation of the population south of the Platte River. Legislators from south of the Platte wore red <b>blankets</b> <b>over</b> their shoulders in the first session to indicate their hostility towards the northern legislators.|$|R
60|$|Supper {{was soon}} {{disposed}} of, and having warmed ourselves at the fire, and ventured a few rash prophecies on the probable weather of the morrow, we spread our <b>blankets</b> <b>over</b> an oiled cloth, and lay lovingly down together; Mr Carles to snore vociferously, and I {{to dream of}} home.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well--it ain't a bad riddance, after all," [...] {{said the}} man, as he rose, and, {{staggering}} {{into a corner}} where another bundle of straw was spread on the floor, flung himself down. Appropriately drawing two of the [...] "stop thief" [...] <b>blankets</b> <b>over</b> him, he went to sleep.|$|R
500|$|Humanity {{has long}} used animal skins for clothing, as the leather is durable and the fur {{provides}} extra insulation. The native people of North America made much use of beaver pelts, tanning and sewing them {{together to make}} robes. Europeans appreciated the quality of these and the North American fur trade developed and became of prime importance to early settlers. In Europe, the soft underfur known as [...] "beaver wool" [...] {{was found to be}} ideal for felting and was made into beaver hats and trimming for clothing. Later, the coypu took over as a cheaper source of fur for felting and was farmed extensively in America and Europe; however, fashions changed, new materials became available and this area of the animal fur industry declined. The chinchilla has a soft and silky coat and the demand for its fur was so high that it was nearly wiped out in the wild before farming took over as the main source of pelts. The quills and guardhairs of porcupines are used for traditional decorative clothing. For example, their guardhairs are used {{in the creation of the}} Native American [...] "porky roach" [...] headdress. The main quills may be dyed, and then applied in combination with thread to embellish leather accessories such as knife sheaths and leather bags. Lakota women would harvest the quills for quillwork by throwing a <b>blanket</b> <b>over</b> a porcupine and retrieving the quills it left stuck in the blanket.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} an opening caption that reads [...] "Womanizer". During the introduction, Spears is naked and smiling at a sauna, while {{covering}} herself with her hands. These scenes are seen throughout the video. When the first verse begins, the official version of Spears wearing a slip nightgown is making breakfast for her boyfriend (...) as he gets ready for work. When {{he is at the}} office, he sees a new secretary, which is actually Spears in disguise wearing horn-rimmed glasses and a pencil skirt. She starts dancing {{in front of him and}} sings the chorus. She makes him follow her into the photocopier, where she photocopies her buttocks. On the back, we see an awkward-looking man, the same who appears in the plane scene on [...] "Toxic". Then, Spears is disguised as a red-haired, tattooed waitress in a restaurant. She dances around him with her dancers and plays with him over the kitchen counter. After this, her boyfriend is seen getting driven home by Spears, disguised as a chauffeur. She starts to kiss him, driving the car with her heel until both get home. Once they get into the bedroom, Spears reveals that she was the three women he was [...] "womanizing" [...] all along. She then begins attacking her boyfriend. This is shown through Spears as her three alter egos, and then as the real version of herself. Spears throws a <b>blanket</b> <b>over</b> her boyfriend and makes the bed. The video ends with Spears smiling, and a repeat of the opening caption.|$|E
2500|$|Heterozygous Lp/lp horses {{with less}} white {{patterning}} are {{described by the}} size of their [...] "blanket" [...] and the presence of spots: spotted <b>blanket</b> <b>over</b> loin and hips, for example. Again, these horses may varnish with age.|$|E
60|$|After he had {{finished}} his meal, the horses were handed over by the Arabs {{to the care of}} one of their neighbours, with whom they had made acquaintance. The rough tent was pulled down in order that they might wrap the dark <b>blankets</b> <b>over</b> them to conceal their white clothing.|$|R
50|$|Originally {{there were}} no {{facilities}} designated for conjugal visits. Some prisoners used tool sheds and storage areas in the camp areas, and others took their wives and girlfriends into the prisoner barracks and placed <b>blankets</b> <b>over</b> beds to allow for privacy. In 1940 prisoners began building special houses {{to be used by}} prisoners and their families during conjugal visits.|$|R

2500|$|In {{kangaroo}} care, {{the baby}} wears {{only a small}} diaper and a hat and is placed in a flexed (fetal position) with maximal skin-to-skin contact on parent's chest. [...] The baby is secured with a wrap that goes around the naked torso of the adult, providing the baby with proper support and positioning (maintain flexion), constant containment without pressure points or creases, and protecting from air drafts (thermoregulation). If it is cold, the parent may wear a shirt or hospital gown with an opening {{to the front and}} a <b>blanket</b> <b>over</b> the wrap for the baby.|$|E
2500|$|The {{purpose of}} these traditions were to make her [...] "bright and smart". [...] Following the bathing, she would be given food and could then sit near the fire. [...] When applicable, a family member would drape a <b>blanket</b> <b>over</b> the woman's shoulders. [...] After the meal, she would be painted with red ochre. [...] She would travel to the forest and pull down cedar and spruce tree branches, rubbing the ends of these over her face and body. [...] This would to make her {{beautiful}} and charming {{in the eyes of}} men. [...] She would give offerings of fern roots to those cedar trees.|$|E

50|$|Children on the autism {{spectrum}} often enjoy a {{sense of}} firm overall pressure. This can be provided by weighted belts, weighted blankets, or being squashed by pillows and firm hugs. These can form a basis for play, interaction and showing affection. Experiences that may be claustrophobic for neurotypical children may be enjoyed, such as being squashed between mattresses, and making tunnels or tents from <b>blankets</b> <b>over</b> furniture.|$|R
2500|$|Paralleling {{the varying}} climate {{patterns}} is the precipitation. The areas nearest the Gulf of Mexico, where the atmospheric moisture is greatest, will receive {{more than forty}} inches of precipitation annually. The wastern areas of the region, such as Montana, receive less than fourteen inches annually. In the winter time, the southern region has less than an inch of snowfall, while the northern regions receive more than forty. The spring time is also a season that brings much precipitation to the Great Plains through the cold, dry air masses that interact with the air masses from the Gulf of Mexico, creating outbreaks of severe thunderstorms with heavy rainfall, high winds, hail, and tornadoes. [...] Most of the winter season in the Northern Plains actually has a snow <b>blanket</b> <b>over</b> {{a majority of the}} winter season. This shows how there is consistent precipitation over the region during the winter months, while in the heat of summer there is more chance for drought with sporadic heavy rains.|$|E
2500|$|Alpert's style {{achieved}} enormous {{popularity with}} the national exposure The Clark Gum Company gave {{to one of his}} recordings in 1964, a Sol Lake number titled [...] "The Mexican Shuffle" [...] (which was retitled [...] "The Teaberry Shuffle" [...] for the television advertisements). In 1965, Alpert released two albums, Whipped Cream & Other Delights and Going Places. Whipped Cream sold over 6 million copies in the United States. The album cover featured model Dolores Erickson wearing only what appeared to be whipped cream. In reality, Erickson was wearing a white <b>blanket</b> <b>over</b> which were scattered artfully placed daubs of shaving cream‚Äîreal whipped cream would have melted under the heat of the studio lights (although the cream on her finger was real). In concerts, when about to play the song, Alpert would tell the audience, [...] "Sorry, we can't play the cover for you." [...] The art was parodied by several groups including one-time A band Soul Asylum and by comedian Pat Cooper for his album Spaghetti Sauce and Other Delights. The singles included the title cut, [...] "Lollipops and Roses", and [...] "A Taste of Honey". The latter won a Grammy Award for Record of the Year. Going Places produced four more singles: [...] "Tijuana Taxi", [...] "Spanish Flea", [...] "Third Man Theme", and [...] "Zorba the Greek". [...] "Tijuana Taxi" [...] and [...] "Spanish Flea" [...] would be used in the 1966 Academy Award-winning animated short A Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass Double Feature.|$|E

5000|$|In 1853 he {{observed}} by chance the primitive oil-gathering industry in western Pennsylvania, although {{his interest in}} what was then known as [...] "rock oil" [...] had been piqued by seeing samples while a student at Dartmouth College. At the time, oil was gathered by such crude methods as soaking blankets in surface oil and then draining the <b>blankets</b> <b>over</b> barrels. The oil was used mainly for medicinal purposes.|$|R
