5|$|Outside of combat, Scarygirl navigates {{the game}} world by running, jumping, gliding, and using her tentacle arm to grapple onto objects. Scarygirl {{eventually}} gains {{access to a}} feather attachment that can replace the hook on her tentacle arm, allowing Scarygirl to hover and reach otherwise inaccessible locations. Stages contain deadly traps {{that have to be}} avoided, often by grappling over them, and most stages contain at least two paths through the stage, although after choosing one the option to <b>backtrack</b> and take the other route exists. Crystals, which can be used to purchase combat upgrades for both combat and exploration, and heart fragments, which increase Scarygirl's maximum health, are scattered throughout stages. In order to get all of the crystals and heart fragments, players will have to traverse both paths through stages that have more than one path.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} few months after the WDWRR opened to the public, Main Street, U.S.A. Station at the Magic Kingdom park's entrance, modeled after the former Victorian-style Saratoga Springs station in Saratoga Springs, New York, was the only stop for {{passengers}} along its route, making only complete round trips possible. On May 1, 1972, the first Frontierland Station opened just northwest of Pecos Bill Tall Tale Inn and Café in the Frontierland section on the park's western edge. It {{was one of the last}} changes made to the WDWRR prior to the retirement of Roger Broggie on October 1, 1973. Frontierland Station was demolished in November 1990 to make way for the new Splash Mountain attraction and was replaced by the current Frontierland Station, which opened in December 1991 just north of the original station site. During construction of the Splash Mountain attraction and the current Frontierland Station, the WDWRR was temporarily renamed <b>Backtrack</b> Express and operated a single train, which only traveled back and forth along the section of track between the Main Street, U.S.A. section and the Mickey's Starland section. Between 1976 and 1977, the Auto-Train Corporation sponsored the WDWRR.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} properties, meaning, and licensors of <b>backtracking</b> counterfactuals. In particular, <b>backtracking</b> {{has long been}} seen as problem for a unified account of counterfactuals as <b>backtracking</b> counterfactuals are counterfactuals whose antecedent time temporally follows the consequent time. Such a conditional {{is a problem for}} any account of counterfactuals that relies on similarity in the past and not the future to calculate which possible worlds are most similar. As such, <b>backtracking</b> counterfactuals have largely been avoided in analyses of conditionality. Recent efforts have been successfully made to include some <b>backtracking</b> data into a wider theory of counterfactuality (Arregui 2005, Schulz 2007) but even these accounts do not encompass the full range of <b>backtracking</b> data. In Chapter Two of this dissertation, I will present the background assumptions for why <b>backtracking</b> is problematic as well as present <b>backtracking</b> data that Arregui accounts for, as this data must be accounted for in any theory of <b>backtracking.</b> The focus of Chapter Three is new data. I present new instances of <b>backtracking</b> counterfactuals that challenge the current theories of <b>backtracking.</b> Furthermore, I present data from non-backtracking counterfactual conditionals that show that, contrary to the implicit assumptions of earlier theories, <b>backtracking</b> is not magically saved by an extra layer of modality. There are several strategies that make <b>backtracking</b> possible, and in each, no part of the denotation of the counterfactual is specific to a <b>backtracking</b> construction. I demonstrate this with data from forwardtracking (standard) counterfactuals, as well as non-counterfactual conditionals. Chapter Four presents the formalism of existing accounts of <b>backtracking</b> as well as accounts of counterfactuals and conditionals more broadly. I examine the shortcomings of Arregui's account of <b>backtracking</b> for the data presented in Chapter Three and explore the tools from other areas of linguistics and counterfactual research that will guide my analysis, most importantly ordering sources, focus alternatives, and aktionsart classes. Chapter Fives applies these tools to present an updated analysis of <b>backtracking</b> counterfactuals. I will also account for an adversity reading that arises in some non-backtracking counterfactual conditionals...|$|R

5|$|Donkey Kong 64 is a 3D {{platforming}} adventure game {{in which}} the player, as Donkey Kong and his friends, explores an island and collects items to progress through minigames and puzzles. The game follows a traditional storyline for the series: King K. Rool and his reptilian Kremlings invade Donkey Kong's idyllic island and kidnap his friends. After a tutorial, the player embarks as Donkey Kong to rescue them from the kidnappers. While exploring the in-game world and completing puzzle minigames, the player collects bananas; enough of these will grant the player access to boss fights, which, in turn, unlock new in-game worlds. Most of the game's puzzles are simple, and involve rearranging items, manipulating switches and tiles, or matching items as in the game Concentration. Minigames include races, minecart rides, and barrels that shoot the characters as projectiles. There are five such banana-rewarding objectives for each of five playable characters across eight themed worlds—200 goals in total, {{in addition to a}} connecting overworld. Unlike in prior Donkey Kong games, the objectives can be completed in any order. The player can fast travel between sections of the level with designated warp pads, and can swap between characters in designated swap barrels. The player also collects banana coins, which unlock new weapons and abilities, and other collectibles such as weapon ammunition and blueprint puzzle pieces. As in other games by the developer, the player often encounters an impossible situation (e.g., an indestructible object or out-of-reach area) and must eventually <b>backtrack</b> to resolve the impasse after acquiring a new ability.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} new <b>backtracking</b> method called constraint-directed <b>backtracking</b> (CDBT) for solving constraint-satisfaction {{problems}} (CSPs). CDBT and chronological <b>backtracking</b> (BT) share a similar style of instantiating variables (forward) and re-instantiating variables (backward).

40|$|Early {{artificial}} intelligence programming languages that incorporated search and <b>backtracking</b> facilities did not limit <b>backtracking</b> to previous computations when {{a portion of}} a search failed [1]. This had two unpleasant consequences: (1) the amount of data that had to be retained to allow <b>backtracking</b> limited the problems that could be handled, and (2) unexpected failure could cause <b>backtracking</b> arbitrarily far back in program execution and produce unexpected and sometimes mysterious results. In subsequent {{artificial intelligence}} languages, this problem was dealt with by allowing the search tree to be pruned — portions discarded, freeing up the associated memory and preventing <b>backtracking</b> beyond that point [2, 3].

Codirectional collisions with <b>backtracked</b> (arrested) ECs lead to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), whereas head-on collisions do not. A mechanistic model is proposed to explain backtracking-mediated DSBs. We further show that bacteria employ various strategies to avoid replisome collisions with <b>backtracked</b> RNAP, the most general of which is translation that prevents RNAP <b>backtracking.</b> If translation is abrogated, DSBs are suppressed by elongation factors that either prevent <b>backtracking</b> or reactivate <b>backtracked</b> ECs.
