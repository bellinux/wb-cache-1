50|$|Climatic maps {{generally}} {{apply to}} individual months {{and to the}} year as a whole, sometimes to the four seasons, to the growing period, and so forth. On maps compiled from the observations of ground meteorological stations, atmospheric pressure is converted to sea level. Air temperature maps are compiled both from the actual values observed {{on the surface of}} the earth and from values converted to sea level. The pressure field in free atmosphere is represented either by maps of the distribution of pressure at different standard altitudes—for example, at every kilometer above sea level—or by maps of <b>baric</b> <b>topography</b> on which altitudes (more precisely geopotentials) of the main isobaric surfaces (for example, 900, 800, and 700 millibars) counted off from sea level are plotted. The temperature, humidity, and wind on aeroclimatic maps may apply either to standard altitudes or to the main isobaric surfaces.|$|E

Dzedzeyevskiy was {{made on the basis of}} synoptic analysis of weather maps and <b>baric</b> <b>topography</b> of the Northern Hemisphere and considers the number and geographical location of the Arctic invasions (blocking processes) and outlets of southern cyclones. The presence of dynamic schemes of each elementary circulation mechanism, in short ECM, allows to determine what is the synoptic situation at each point of the Northern Hemisphere at this or another type of ECM (Dzerdzeyevskiy 1968, 1975).|$|E
40|$|This article emphasises {{that one}} of the {{conditions}} for the formation of extreme inflow events from the North into the Baltic Sea is the long-time impact of same-type atmospheric processes on the water surface. There is a need to consider the intensity and the duration of one-direction atmospheric processes. The authors focus on the features and types of large-scale atmospheric circulation over the North-East Atlantic, which determined the regional atmospheric processes over the Baltic Sea during the formation of a large inflow. The article analyses the inflows of December 22, 1975 — January 14, 1976, and the inflow of January 16 — 222003, as well as <b>baric</b> <b>topography</b> (500 hPa) and daily synoptic maps...|$|E

The horizontal dimensions of increased turbulence regions in the zones of jet fluxes in the upper troposphere and the coefficient of horizontal turbulent diffusion in them were determined. The calculated fields of V and Kd were compared with the data of the <b>baric</b> <b>topography</b> maps. Revealed were the peculiarities of the coefficient of horizontal turbulent diffusion spatial distribution in the zones of tropical cyclones in the Atlantics...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} the results of measurements of aerosol optical properties which were made between 2006 and 2008 within the framework of various international projects in different locations such as Spitsbergen, northern Norway and Crete. The investigations were made under different <b>baric</b> <b>topography</b> conditions and in various seasons of the year which facilitated the investigations of spatial and temporal dependencies between upper troposphere mass state and spectral variations of aerosol properties. The results of aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements showed significant episodes during which jet stream events (300 hPa surface) over the Arctic were present. The mean spectral characteristics of AOD from “before ” and “after ” the event differ by 0. 14 versus the “during ” phase of the episode. The macrometeorological relative topography charts shown also the relationships between the 500 hPa, close sea-level pressure SLP (1, 000 hPa) charts surfaces and the attenuation caused by aerosol scattering and absorption in vertical profiles during the afternoon hours...|$|E
40|$|The main factor {{forming the}} {{regional}} background {{of air pollution}} is long-range transport of air masses having influence for thousands kilometers with the duration to several days [1, 2]. The amount of contaminants transported {{to the site of}} observation mainly depends on powerful sources of pollution, meteorological and physico-chemical factors occurring on the way of air mass transport. Comprehensive analysis of these factors defines the accuracy of mathematic model. The investigation of long- range transport influence to the air pollution of the Preila background station has been carried out since 1978. The region of pollutant source was determined from the back trajectories of the air masses passing the background station. They were calculated from the maps of <b>baric</b> <b>topography</b> for the preceding 48 and 96 hours. Since 1997, trajectories of air masses are taken from the NOAA net. Trajectories of air masses were divided into 4 sectors, and “sector 0 ” characterizing air masses formed in the region of the observation site. Daily analysis of long-range air mass transport during 15 years showed that each year the percentile distribution of the air masses direction was different, but in each case air masses from the west were prevailing and sometimes they comprised nearly 80 % of all annua...|$|E
40|$|Radiosounding of the {{atmosphere}} is an essential component constituting the base for prognostic aviation authorities. GPR scanning data are {{the basis for the}} mapping of <b>baric</b> <b>topography</b> used in the development of aviation weather forecasts. Currently, numerical methods of weather forecast have become especially popular. This is quite justified, as these methods allow to increase the accuracy of weather forecasts and these techniques represent the future. However, the era of "numerical weather prediction" will not come soon. This is primarily due to imperfect numerical forecast models, which do not provide for timeliness and reliability of weather forecasting required for aviation. However, the quality of meteorological support of aircraft flights is largely determined by the timeliness and predictability of the aviation weather forecasts. In this regard, the network of radiosounding functions require the presentation of the theoretical foundations and providing consumers with normalized metrological characteristics of the measuring system of radio sounding, methods of measurement and a reasonable assessment of the reliability of the results of sensing. A number of these problems have been resolved nowadays, however, so far the problem of estimating dynamic measurement errors in the sounding is not solved. The metrological characteristics and the dynamic error of measurement of temperature with the new temperature sensors of foreign production (NТС MFB- 5000 - 3220), recently used in the Russian radiosondes still require the detailed studies. This article is devoted {{to one of the most}} important types of errors of radio sounding – the dynamic errors of measurement, to be precise, the dynamic error of the temperature measurement. In the article the problem of determining the value of dynamic errors of radiosondes is being solved alongside with the investigation of the role of this kind of errors when assessing the reliability of the results of {{the atmosphere}} radio sounding. </p...|$|E
