5|$|Additional subclasses of glycerolipids are {{represented}} by glycosylglycerols, which are characterized <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> {{of one or more}} sugar residues attached to glycerol via a glycosidic linkage.

5|$|In the United States, {{the cane}} toad closely resembles many bufonid species. In particular, {{it could be}} {{confused}} with the southern toad (Bufo terrestris), which can be distinguished <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of two bulbs in front of the parotoid glands.|$|E
5|$|Living mammal {{species can}} be {{identified}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of sweat glands, including those that are specialized to produce milk to nourish their young.

5|$|Native (i.e., elemental) {{selenium}} {{is a rare}} mineral, {{which does}} not usually form good crystals, but, when it does, they are steep rhombohedra or tiny acicular (hair-like) crystals.

5|$|Although {{dopamine}} {{is normally}} {{broken down by}} an oxidoreductase enzyme, it is also susceptible to oxidation by direct reaction with oxygen, yielding quinones plus various free radicals as products. The rate of oxidation can be increased <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of ferric iron or other factors. Quinones and free radicals produced by autoxidation of dopamine can poison cells, and {{there is evidence that}} this mechanism may contribute to the cell loss that occurs in Parkinson's disease and other conditions.|$|E
5|$|Another {{well-known}} artefact with {{an astronomical}} use is the Antikythera mechanism.

5|$|Ascocoryne cylichnium, {{another small}} and {{gelatinous}} violet-colored species, has apothecia {{that are more}} often cup-shaped, and has larger spores—20–24 by 5.5–6µm. Because of its resemblance to the jelly fungi, A.sarcoides has been mistaken for the basidiomycete species Auricularia auricula and Tremella foliacea. T.foliacea is larger, brown, and leafy in appearance. Auricularia auricula is also larger, typically brown, is disc- or ear-shaped, with a ribbed undersurface. Microscopically, Tremella foliacea and Auricularia auricula are easily distinguished from A.sarcoides <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of basidia (rather than asci).|$|E
5|$|Astrophysicist Alice C. Quillen and her student Stephen Thorndike {{performed}} {{computer simulations}} {{of the structure}} of the dust disk around Epsilon Eridani.

5|$|Beal was {{a friend}} of Paynter, while Murray was a West Ham trialist and played {{football}} at schoolboy level with a number of West Ham players such as Jim Barrett.

5|$|Because of {{the colored}} volva, A.atkinsoniana resembles A.onusta, which differs from A.atkinsoniana {{by the small}} to {{medium-sized}} fruit bodies with a grayish veil as dark gray to brownish gray warts and a basal bulb which is usually somewhat rooting. Sometimes the fruit bodies of A.atkinsoniana are confused with A.microlepsis which can be distinguished <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of reddish-brown to grayish-brown volval remnants and the rooting bulb of A.atkinsoniana.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the basic}} fruit body {{structure}} in all genera of the Nidulariaceae family is essentially similar, Cyathus may be readily confused with species of Nidula or Crucibulum, especially older, weathered specimens of Cyathus {{that may have}} the hairy ectoperidium worn off. It distinguished from Nidula <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of a funiculus, a cord of hyphae attaching the peridiole to the endoperidium. Cyathus differs from genus Crucibulum by having a distinct three-layered wall and a more intricate funiculus.|$|E

As a wicket-keeper, his opportunities were limited <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of Keith Piper, and he failed to make an impact as a batsman when he was given chances in the first team. He only started to play regularly for the county in 1996, but opted to move to Somerset the following year.|$|E
