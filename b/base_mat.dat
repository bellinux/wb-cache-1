The design of the theater was created by Michel Crête and that of Montreal-based team of Scéno Plus. This theater seats 1,541 audiences. The stage measures 120 feet by 70 feet deep and covers approximately 10,032 square feet. The stage floor is made of a layer of <b>Base</b> <b>Mat,</b> which is rubber made from recycled old tires and sneakers. This helps give the stage some bounce for tumbling. This is held together by polyurethane adhesive and covered with thousands of gallons of liquid that dries onto the surface. The Downstage D Lift is 36 feet in diameter and includes a 28-foot revolving stage. The revolving stage rotates up to 10 revolutions per minute. Props, equipment, and performers are elevated to stage level from the basement or trap by four moving lifts. These moving lifts were constructed in Montreal and then assembled in Las Vegas, NV.|$|E
40|$|The {{foundation}} {{might be}} separated from the supporting soil if the earthquake is big enough, which is known as <b>base</b> <b>mat</b> uplift. This paper proposed a simplified calculation model in which spring element is adopted to simulate the interaction between soil and structure. The load-deformation curve (F-D curve) of the spring element can be designated to represent the <b>base</b> <b>mat</b> uplift, in which the pressure can be applied while tensile forces are not allowed. Key factors, such as seismic wave types, seismic wave excitation directions, seismic wave amplitudes, soil shear velocities, structure stiffness, and the ratio of structure height to width (H/B), were considered in the analysis. It is shown that (1) seismic wave type has significant influence on structure response due to different frequency components it contained; (2) the vertical input of seismic wave greatly affected structure response in vertical direction, while it has little impacts in horizontal direction; (3) <b>base</b> <b>mat</b> uplift is easier to take place in soil with higher shear velocity; (4) structure H/B value has complicated influence on <b>base</b> <b>mat</b> uplift.

Two weeks later, the test pit was re-entered and the water level had returned to 3 feet. Sampling of the water indicated similar concentrations to those found 2 weeks earlier (137 Cs at 11, 400 pCi/L, 3 H at 11, 500 pCi/L, and 60 Co at 6, 000 pCi/L). Almost all of the 60 Co was associated with filterable particulates. The two other contaminants were in solution.

40|$|In {{this study}} the two {{dimensional}} dynamic response of a Multi Degree of Freedom (MDOF) sliding isolated structure permitted to uplift is studied. The MDOF superstructure {{is supported by}} two sets of sliding bearings situated at both {{the ends of the}} <b>base</b> <b>mat.</b> The foundation supporting the sliding bearings is assumed to be flexible and modeled using two sets of viscoelastic spring-dashpot systems attached below the sliding isolation bearings. The nonlinear stick-slip behavior of the friction based sliding isolation system is modeled using a hysteretic Bouc-Wen model. A nonlinear analytical model is formulated which takes into account the linear equations of motion of the superstructure and the <b>base</b> <b>mat</b> with stick-slip behavior of sliding isolators and in addition the following effects: uplift and loss of contact at the sliding bearings, and variation of coefficient of friction with velocity and bearing pressure. For comparison purposes fixed base structure with uplift is also modeled. The analytical model is solved using a two-step solution methodology and Pseudo-force method is employed for calculating the nonlinear forces acting on the structure at the interface of sliding isolation system in both the horizontal (stick-slip) direction as well as the vertical (uplift-contact direction). The analytical model developed is validated using experimental results of a 1 : 4 scaled model. Parametric study is performed with the analytical model (at full scale) by varying the periods of the superstructure, time period of the sliding isolation system, slenderness ratio of superstructure, vertical stiffness of foundation and pulse excitation parameters. The dynamical response of the MDOF structure with sliding isolation and uplift permitted is compared with sliding isolation with uplift prevented and fixed base structure with uplift respectively. The behavior of the MDOF system is studied for both near-source earthquake ground motion and their corresponding cycloidal approximations. The results of the study highlight the advantages of the combined mechanism of sliding isolation and vertical uplift for reduction of structural response of a MDOF system, as compared to the case without uplift and the case without sliding...|$|E

The descriptive information, including plans and {{sections of the}} structure, is reviewed to establish that sufficient information is provided to define the primary structural aspects and elements relied upon to perform the containment function. In particular, the type of steel containment is identified and its structural and functional characteristics are examined.

30|$|The <b>base</b> <b>mat</b> of each {{specimen}} {{was fully}} fixed, while {{the top of}} the specimen was free to move horizontally. The transverse load was applied at {{the top of the}} column through a double-action actuator (with force and displacement control system) with a load capacity of 1000  kN fixed on a reaction wall. The axial load was applied on the centroid of the free end section of the specimen through a 1000  kN hydraulic jack keeping constant throughout the test. During the test, displacements were measured by means of linear variable differential transducers (LVDTs), while strains of reinforcement were measured by means of strain gauges. The location of strain gauges can be found in Fig.  8. The axial load was first applied to the target value and maintained constant by adjusting the readings of instrument panel in the hydraulic jack during the experiment. In the tests, a force-control loading program was applied before the longitudinal reinforcement yielded. The increment of load was initially 50  kN for each step until arriving at 80 % of the predicted yielding load, and then changed the increment of 50  kN into 25  kN. The force-control loading procedure was not changed until the longitudinal reinforcement yielded. Then, the specimens were subjected to the cyclic shear force by the displacement-control loading method with the increment of each load step equals to the measured yield displacement up until the shear-resisting capacity drops by more than 20 % of the maximum shear force. In the force-control loading procedure, all cycles were carried out once, while each displacement level was repeated three times in the displacement-control loading procedure. The detailed experiment setup and loading configuration can be found in the experimental study of ECC columns by Wu et al. (2017).|$|E
