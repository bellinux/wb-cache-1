40|$|International audienceThe {{separated}} flow past the square-back model {{used in the}} experiments of Ahmed et al. [1] is controlled using flaps {{at the end of}} the top and bottom faces. A parametric study of the flow regarding the slant angle of the flaps is performed from pressure and force measurements as well as particle image velocime-try (PIV). When the <b>bottom</b> <b>flap</b> orientation is fixed, variations of the top slant angle evidence a drag versus lift quadratic dependence. This relationship presents self similarities changing the <b>bottom</b> <b>flap</b> angle. It is then observed that the lift is an affine function of both slant angles and the force a second order polynomial containing a coupling term between the two angles. These drag evolutions varying both angles are discussed and interpreted as contributions of the wake size, a drag induced by the lift and a local drag induced by the inclination of the flaps...|$|E
40|$|PIV {{measurements}} of the flow {{in the region of}} a flap side edge are presented for several blowing flap configurations. The test model is a NACA 63 (sub 2) - 215 Hicks Mod-B main-element airfoil with a half-span Fowler flap. Air is blown from small slots located along the flap side edge on either the top, bottom or side surfaces. The test set up is described and flow measurements for a baseline and three blowing flap configurations are presented. The effects that the flap tip jets have on the structure of the flap side edge flow are discussed for each of the flap configurations tested. The results indicate that blowing air from a slot located along the top surface of the flap greatly weakened the top vortex system and pushed it further off the top surface. Blowing from the <b>bottom</b> <b>flap</b> surface kept the strong side vortex further outboard while blowing from the side surface only strengthened the vortex system or accelerated the merging of the side vortex to the flap top surface. It is concluded that blowing from the top or bottom surfaces of the flap may lead to a reduction of flap side edge noise...|$|E

40|$|Concerns over {{climate change}} and energy {{security}} help motivate research into wave energy converters (WEC). Two WEC topologies have shown particular promise and many proposed devices rely on these forms, namely the heaving buoy and the <b>bottom</b> hinged surging <b>flap.</b> It can be shown that to achieve resonance a heaving point absorber requires a diameter that is much larger than practical. By contrast, <b>bottom</b> hinged <b>flaps</b> are generally smaller, hence many hinged flap devices are non resonant. This paper proposes a hybrid of these two topologies, {{in the form of}} an off-set hinged flap. The exact form is determined using a novel Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm.

As spreading wave {{has become more}} desirable, the capability of reproducing oblique planar wave train is critical for a wave basin’s performance. In this study, the oblique waves have been simulated in a numeri-cal wave basin based on the volume of fluid (VOF) method and Navier-Stokes solver. Multi-element <b>bottom</b> hinged <b>flap</b> motion using the conventional snake principle has been simulated by moving boundary dynamic mesh in OpenFOAM. Finite length of the entire wave maker and finite width of each paddle caused considerable spatial variations in wave height and wave prop-agating direction.

The generated linear oblique waves have been compared with the analytical solutions for validation in terms of uniformity and wave height.

50|$|The {{seemingly}} mysterious {{ability of}} magnets to influence motion {{at a distance}} without any apparent energy source has long appealed to inventors. One of the earliest examples of a magnetic motor was proposed by Wilkins and has been widely copied since: it consists of a ramp with a magnet at the top, which pulled a metal ball up the ramp. Near the magnet was a small hole {{that was supposed to}} allow the ball to drop under the ramp and return to the <b>bottom,</b> where a <b>flap</b> allowed it to return to the top again. The device simply could not work. Faced with this problem, more modern versions typically use a series of ramps and magnets, positioned so the ball is to be handed off from one magnet to another as it moves. The problem remains the same.|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{outbreaks}} of foodborne illness {{have been attributed}} to non-intact beef (e. g., tenderized, marinated, and enhanced) products contaminated with Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7. Organic acids are commonly utilized in the beef industry as antimicrobial interventions, which must be validated to eliminate or reduce E. coli O 157 :H 7 to an undetectable level. Rifampicin-resistant Biotype I E. coli O 157 :H 7 surrogate microorganisms (ATCC BAA- 1427, BAA- 1428, and BAA- 1430) were applied as a cocktail (7. 8 log 10 CFU/ml) to three beef products (boneless strip loins, top sirloin butts, and <b>bottom</b> sirloin <b>flaps)</b> prior to treatment with an antimicrobial intervention (2. 5 % Beefxide or 2. 9 % lactic acid). Products were then subjected to a single or multiple pass tenderization and/or marination process. Beefxide and lactic acid treatments resulted in statistically significant log reductions of the microorganisms (P < 0. 05) on the surfaces for all three products. Surrogate microorganisms were recovered from interior samples of all three products after mechanical tenderization. Additionally, surrogate concentrations recovered from flap surface and internal samples taken post-tumbling and marination were statistically similar (P < 0. 05). These data indicate that tenderization and marination processes can transfer microorganisms into the interior of whole-muscle cuts, and suggest Beefxide and lactic acid may be similar in their efficacy as an antimicrobial applied as an intervention in the production of non-intact beef products...|$|R
5000|$|The exact {{conditions}} for flapping is unknown, {{although it is}} widely understood that it occurs in an alveolar stop, [...] or , when placed between two vowels, provided the second vowel is unstressed (as in butter, writing, wedding, loader). Across word boundaries, however, it can also occur before a stressed word-initial vowel (as in get over [...] ). This extends to morphological boundaries within compound words (as in whatever [...] ). The [...] "vowel" [...] that precedes the flap {{may also be a}}n approximant, [...] (as in party), or sometimes [...] (as in faulty). The following vowel may also be a syllabic consonant, , [...] or [...] (as in bottle, <b>bottom,</b> butter), but <b>flapping</b> before [...] (button, Latin) is rare. The stress constraint applies to secondary stress as well, prohibiting words like botox, detail and latex from flapping. Word-initial stops are usually not flapped, except in the preposition/particle to and words derived from it, such as today, tonight, tomorrow and together (as in go to sleep [...] ). In Australian English, numerals thirteen, fourteen and eighteen are often flapped despite the second vowel being stressed.|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 36 - 37). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Thirty-seven selected styles of subprimals of beef were obtained from the fabrication lines of three foodservice purveyors to assist {{in the development of a}} software support program for the beef foodservice industry. They were fabricated into bone-in or boneless foodservice cuts and associated components by trained meat cutters. Once fabrication was completed, data were analyzed to determine means and standard errors on percentage yields and timing scores for each subprimal. Each style selected was used to generate mean foodservice yields and labor requirements, which were calculated from foodservice weights (kg) and processing times (s). Subprimals consisting of only one cutting style were evaluated for mean foodservice yields and processing times and, no comparisons were made within cut. These subprimals included: rib-roast ready; ribeye roll, lip-on, bone-in; boneless brisket, deckle-off; inside round; and <b>bottom</b> sirloin <b>flap.</b> Subprimals consisting of multiple cutting styles also were evaluated for mean foodservice yields and processing times, and comparisons were made within cut. These subprimals included: ribeye rolls; top sirloin caps; tenderloin butts; ribeye rolls, lepton; shorthorns; strip loins; top sirloin butts; and tenderloins. Significant variations in foodservice yields and cutting times were found within cutting styles. In general, as the target portion size decreased, the number of steaks increased, causing total foodservices yield to decrease and total processing time to increase. Furthermore, an inverse relationship tended to exist between processing times and foodservice yields.

40|$|CIVINSThe {{topic that}} was {{investigated}} was {{whether there is}} a lift and thrust benefit to flapping an underwater, biologically inspired three dimensional foil near the solid bottom surface (so that it was in ground effect). The experimental method used a dual canister device that allowed actuation in roll and pitch, with force sensors attached to the pitch shaft, in order to record the forces produced by the foil as it flapped. The dual canister was towed on a carriage at a constant speed in a large tow tank that had been configured to have a long run of constant, deep water depth, a very short transition period, and then another long run of constant, shallow water depth. Due to this configuration, in one run the foil was able to encounter freestream conditions and ground effect conditions. The results proved in all sixteen experimental cases for varying Strouhal number and maximum angle of attack that the mean lift coefficient near the bottom was larger than that in the freestream. A potentially useful data point, for which the mean thrust coefficient had a positive change from <b>flapping</b> near <b>bottom</b> as compared to the freestream, was found to have a change in maximum instantaneous lift force of 14 %. This would give a large enough change in signal strength that it {{could be used as a}} parameter on a future underwater vehicle to control altitude above the ground. The benefit to flapping in ground effect was equivalent to a larger than 1 ° pitch bias difference at a zero mean lift coefficient. Additionally, there was a thrust benefit seen to flapping in ground effect, but only under certain kinematics. Though not as dramatic as the benefit in lift, there was still an 8 % difference in the mean thrust coefficient observed between <b>flapping</b> near the <b>bottom</b> and <b>flapping</b> in the freestream, for the case where the largest change in mean thrust coefficient was observed. This could equate to a large savings in battery life, and hence a longer endurance for a vehicle taking advantage of the thrust benefit seen by flapping in ground effect. While this work remains preliminary in nature, it shows that much more useful work remains to be done to explore the benefit induced by flapping a foil close to a hard surface ground. Civilia...|$|R

Subprimals were fabricated into bone-in or boneless retail or foodservice cuts and associated components by trained retail meat cutters. After each retail cutting test, trained technicians recorded weights of all cuts, lean trim, fat trim, and bone. All retail cuts were trimmed to an eighth of an inch (0. 32 cm), unless otherwise specified. Time (s) was recorded for each-cutting test and in two major phases: opening (retrieval of the subprimal from vacuum-packaged bag) and cutting (removal of all external and seam fat, connective tissue, and separation of individual muscles, as well as producing tray ready retail cuts). In general, Select subprimals had higher saleable yields than Choice subprimals. Select subprimals had less trimmable fat than Choice subprimals, and differences in retail yields appeared to follow these factors. Few significant differences were observed for processing times between USDA quality grade groups.
