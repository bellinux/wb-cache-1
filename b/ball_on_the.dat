For example, a <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side line {{is still in the}} field of play; a <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> line of the penalty circle is in the penalty circle; a foul committed over the 23-metre (25-yard) line has occurred in the 23-metre area. A ball must completely cross a boundary line to be out of play, and a ball must wholly cross the goal line before a goal is scored.|$|E
5|$|The Panhandles' opening {{game against}} the Dayton Triangles is {{considered}} to be the first football game between two APFA teams. The Panhandles lost 14–0 to the Triangles. Despite the first two quarters resulting in ties, the crowd was excited. In the second quarter, the Triangles made a goal line stand while the Panhandles had the <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 3-yard line. Before halftime, the Triangles' Al Mahrt completed a 30-yard pass to Dutch Thiele, which resulted in the Triangles to having the <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 5-yard line. The Triangles' did not score on that possession due to the clock running out.|$|E

5|$|The {{position}} of the goalkeeper has existed since the game of water polo originated.

Three minutes later, Liverpool made another substitution, as Alonso went off with an injury {{to be replaced by}} defender Jan Kromkamp. Minutes later, West Ham captain Nigel Reo-Coker had an attempt to score, but his shot went over the Liverpool goal. West Ham subsequently made their first substitution of the match, as Ashton was replaced by fellow striker Bobby Zamora. Liverpool also replaced Crouch with midfielder Dietmar Hamann.|$|E

5|$|Apart from battling, {{capturing}} Pokémon is {{the most}} essential element of Pokémon gameplay. During battle with a wild Pokémon (other trainers' Pokémon cannot be captured), the player may use a Poké <b>Ball</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wild Pokémon. If successful, the Pokémon {{will be added to}} the player's active party (or stored if the player already has the maximum six Pokémon in his/her party). Factors in the success rate of capture include the HP (and/or status effects such as Paralysis or Sleep,) of the target Pokémon and the strength of the Poké Ball used: the lower the target's HP and the stronger the Poké Ball, the higher the success rate of capture is.|$|E
5|$|As had Virginia Tech, Air Force {{began moving}} the <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. The Falcons were aided by two offsides {{penalties}} against the Hokies and drove into Tech territory. Once there, Weiss completed a 16-yard pass to Tom Coleman {{for a first}} down. Weiss picked up another first down by running the ball, pushing the Falcons inside the Tech red zone with 10:10 remaining. The Tech defense stiffened, forcing a fourth down at the two-yard line. Rather than kick a field goal, Fisher DeBerry elected to attempt the touchdown, and Mike Brown ran the needed twoyards. The score and following extra point gave Air Force a 177 lead with 6:00 remaining in the game.|$|E

5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} five games, the absence of Adrian Peterson did not keep the Sooners from running the <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground.

5|$|Both teams {{struggled}} {{to put a}} flowing move together in the opening exchanges, but it was United who had the better chances, both falling to Ronaldo. The first came in the seventhminute: having been played the ball by Michael Carrick, Ronaldo turned away from Piqué {{on the edge of}} the centre circle, before hitting a shot just wide from almost 40yards; the second saw the ball break to Ronaldo after Anderson and Patrice Evra had linked up well down the left flank. The Portuguese winger controlled the <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> chest before hitting the ball just past the far post.|$|E

Greg McElroy struggled; he threw a pair of first-quarter interceptions on Bama's first two offensive possessions. South Carolina's C.C. Whitlock fumbled the <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> return of the second interception and possession was recovered by Darius Hanks. The Tide continued its drive to the Gamecock 8, and Leigh Tiffin kicked a field goal to put Alabama ahead 10–0.|$|E

5|$|In {{the sixth}} week of play, Vanderbilt beat the Alabama Crimson Tide 14–0 in Birmingham. The score {{reflected}} predictions, since the Commodores were favored by two touchdowns. Jess Neely {{played a role}} in each scoring drive. Early in the first quarter, Vanderbilt had the ball {{in the middle of the}} field after an Alabama punt. Two line bucks preceded Neely, who connected with Tot McCullough for a 30-yard pass play. Neely ran for an additional 17 yards, putting the <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> nine-yard line. After a run by Godchaux, Lynn Bomar bucked over the line for the touchdown.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United {{fashioned}} {{the first}} chance {{of the second half}} after just three minutes, when Rooney cut inside from the right along the face of the penalty area, but his left-footed shot was blocked away for a corner kick. Soon after, Van Nistelrooy received the <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edge of the penalty area and held it up before playing a through-ball to Keane, but the Irishman's low cross was diverted behind by Kolo Touré before it reached Rooney. United then had their third chance in the space of five minutes when Ronaldo shot just wide from 25 yards, from the left corner of the penalty area.|$|E
5|$|The first score {{came after}} Rip Reeves {{recovered}} a Georgia fumble at the 30-yard line. On the second play after this, Red Bethea ran off left tackle for a touchdown. Goof Bowyer missed the extra point. By {{the second quarter}} Georgia had failed to consistently move the <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground against Florida's line and tried to pass. Bulldogs' quarterback H. F. Johnson completed a 10-yard pass to back Frank Dudley, who ran 30 additional yards for a touchdown. Johnson missed the extra point and the score was tied. A 16-yard touchdown run by Florida's Clyde Crabtree, starting around right end, then reversing field, broke the tie. Carl Brumbaugh converted the extra point.|$|E
