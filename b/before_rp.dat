40|$|The {{likelihood}} of finding organ-confined untreated prostate cancer (PCa) by pathological examination {{at the time}} of radical prostatectomy (RP) is only 50 % in patients with clinically organ-confined disease. In addition, tumour is present at the resection margin in approximately 30 % of clinical T 2 (clinical stage B) cases. The issue of clinical "understaging" and of resection limit positivity have {{led to the development of}} novel management practices, including "neoadjuvant" hormonal therapy (NHT). The optimal duration of NHT is unknown. We undertook the present analysis to evaluate the effect of NHT on pathologic stage of PCa and resection limit status in patients with prostate cancer and treated with total androgen ablation either for three or six months <b>before</b> <b>RP.</b> Between January 1996 and February 1998, 259 men with prostate cancer underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy and bilateral pelvic node dissection in the 26 centres participating in the Italian randomised prospective PROSIT study. Whole mount sectioning of the complete RP specimens was adopted in each centre for accurately evaluating the pathologic stage and resection limit status. By February 1998, haematoxylin and eosin stained sections from 155 RP specimens had been received and evaluated by the reviewing pathologist (RM). 64 cases had not been treated with total androgen ablation (e. g. NHT) <b>before</b> <b>RP</b> was performed, whereas 58 and 33 had been treated for three and six months, respectively. 114 patients were clinical stage B whereas 41 were clinical stage C. After three months of total androgen ablation, pathological stage B was more prevalent among patients with clinical B tumours, compared with untreated patients (57 % in treated patients vs. 36 % in untreated). The percentage of cancers with negative margins was statistically significantly greater in patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy than those treated with immediate surgery alone (69 % vs. 42 %, respectively). After six months of NHT therapy the proportion of patients with pathological stage B (67 % vs. 36 %, respectively) and negative margins was greater than after 3 months (92 % vs. 42 %, respectively). For clinical C tumours, the prevalence of pathological stage B and negative margins in the patients treated for either 3 or 6 months was not as high as in the clinical B tumours, when compared with the untreated group (pathological stage B: 31 % and 33 % vs. 6 % in the clinical C cases, respectively. Negative margins: 56 % and 67 % vs. 31 %, respectively). The initial results of this study suggest that total androgen ablation <b>before</b> <b>RP</b> is beneficial in men with clinical stage B because of the significant pathological downstaging and decrease in the number of positive margins in the RP specimens. These two effects are more pronounced after six months of NHT than after three months of therapy. The same degree of beneficial effects are not observed in clinical C tumours...|$|E

Despite the high {{mortality}} associated with PCa, the only established risk factors are age, race and family history. A possible association between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and PCa was firstly described in 2004 and several subsequent studies in biopsy cohorts have shown conflicting results. Aim of our multicentre prospective study was to investigate the association between MetS and PCa in men undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP).

40|$|INTRODUCTION & OBJECTIVE: With about 144000 cases {{per year}} {{prostate}} cancer (PC) {{is the second}} important cancer of men in Europe. There are about 56000 deaths because of PC {{every year in the}} European Union. Treatment options for the localised disease are the radical prostatectomy (RP) and the brachytherapy (BT). The BT can be administered as “low dose rate brachytherapy” (LDR) or “high dose rate brachytherapy” (HDR). In the years between January 1999 and November 2004 653 patients with localised prostate cancer were treated at the department of urology at “Universitätsklinikum Aachen”. Among them there were 422 treated with RP (64. 6 %) and 231 with BT (35. 4 %). The RP-group consisted of 332 men treated with RPP (78. 7 %) and 90 treated with RRP (21. 3 %). In the BT-group there were 117 men with LDR (50. 6 %) and 114 with HDR (49. 4 %). Clinical, demographic and socioeconomic data as well as data about continence status and health related QoL were collected by a team of independent investigators in order to compare baseline data of the named treatment groups. METHODS: In a relational data base epidemiologic as well as clinical data were collected. All patients eligible for treatment got a seven-page questionnaire including 93 questions about urine (ICS male questionnaire for urinary symptoms) and stool continence (Kelly Score Questionnaire), questions concerning erectile function and the EORTC QLQ-C 30 quality of life questionnaire. We compared all groups using statistical tests. RESULTS: Clinical data of all patients could be evaluated. The questionnaire was completed by 503 men (77. 0 %) including 321 patients (76. 1 %) of the RP group and 182 of the BT-group (78. 8 %). Data of 503 men could be analyzed containing the data of 321 patients <b>before</b> undergoing <b>RP</b> (63. 8 %) - 271 of the RPP (84. 4 %) and 50 of the RRP-group – and 182 patients before BT (36. 2 %) – 87 men of the HDR-group (47. 8 %) and 95 of the LDR-group (52. 2 %). Patients <b>before</b> undergoing <b>RP</b> were statistical significantly younger than those undergoing BT (p= 0. 0001) and the rate of retired men was lower (p= 0. 0014). There were the same findings comparing the younger LDR-group with men of the HDR-group (p= 0. 0149 and p= 0. 0018 respectively). The staging parameters PSA und gleason score were better in the RP-group than in the BT-group (p< 0. 001 and p< 0. 0001) and they were better in the LDR-group than under men before undergoing HDR (p< 0, 0001 and p = 0, 0058). Erectile dysfunction was more often detected under men of the BT-group than among the RP-group (p< 0. 001) and more often under men before HDR than before LDR (p= 0. 0455). We did not find statistical significant differences in “bowel problems” Men before a treatment with HDR suffered slightly more from “lower urinary tract symptoms” (LUTS) than patients of the RP-group (p= 0. 0481). Physical function was better under men <b>before</b> undergoing <b>RP</b> compared with the BT-group (p= 0. 0002) and it was better under patients before undergoing LDR than before the group of men asked before a treatment with HDR (p= 0. 0134). CONCLUSIONS: We found statistical significant differences in age, physical function and erectile dysfunction with the patients in the RP group being the younger and fitter group with less erectile dysfunction or LUTS. Bowel symptoms were quite prevalent. The big differences between the data of the HDR- and the LDR-group prove the necessity of separated evaluation of patients who have bee treated with BT. In our study patients with a good erectile function have been treated preferentially with RP disregarding the possible side effects of an erectile dysfunction. With regard to the results of studies that analyzed patients after a treatment of PC with BT or RP the higher rates of erectile dysfunction and LUTS among our patients before undergoing BT and the quite equal rate of bowel dysfunction under all our patients should be considered. These findings underline the necessity of prospective data thoroughly checked for confounding variables when judging complications of different treatment forms for localised prostate cancer...|$|R

Although detection of CaP at early curable stage is highly desirable, actual screening methods present limitations and new molecular approaches are needed. Gene expression analysis increases our knowledge about the biology of CaP and may render novel molecular tools, but the identification of accurate biomarkers for reliable molecular diagnosis is a real challenge. We describe here the diagnostic power of a novel 8 -genes signature: ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), ornithine decarboxylase antizyme (OAZ), adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC), spermidine/spermine N(1) -acetyltransferase (SSAT), histone H 3 (H 3), growth arrest specific gene (GAS 1), glyceraldehyde 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and Clusterin (CLU) in tumour detection/classification of human CaP.

Methods: Patients treated with RP from October 2008 to March 2012 completed American Urological Association symptom index (AUAI) and continence assessments at the preoperative visit and each postoperative visit. Two co-horts were established based on {{the presence or absence of}} a median lobe intraoperatively. Results: A total of 698 validated questionnaires were completed by 175 patients with a median of 4 AUAI scores per patient. The 36 patients (21 %) with MLE required a longer time to achieve urinary continence (P. 05, log-rank test), although ultimately, no differ-ence was seen in long-term continence probability be-tween the two cohorts (P. 63). On multivariate anal-ysis, the presence of a median lobe reduced the odds of early continence recovery (P. 02). By use of a gen-eralized estimating equation, the cohort-average AUAI scores after RP are presented. Patients with MLE had faster improvement in LUTS after surgery, whereas those without MLE had temporary worsening in LUTS before improvement.

To account for varying start dates and duration of statin use during follow-up, post-RP statin use {{was treated as a}} time-dependent variable. In a secondary analysis, models were stratified by race to examine the association of post-RP statin use with BCR among black and non-black men. RESULTS: After adjusting for clinical and pathological characteristics, post-RP statin use was significantly associated with 36 % reduced risk of BCR (hazard ratio [HR] 0. 64, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 47 - 0. 87; P = 0. 004). Post-RP statin use remained associated with reduced risk of BCR after adjusting for preoperative serum cholesterol levels. In secondary analysis, after stratification by race, this protective association was significant in non-black (HR 0. 49, 95 % CI 0. 32 - 0. 75; P = 0. 001) but not black men (HR 0. 82, 95 % CI 0. 53 - 1. 28; P = 0. 384). CONCLUSION: In this retrospective cohort of men undergoing RP, post-RP statin use was significantly associated with reduced risk of BCR. Whether the association between post-RP statin use and BCR differs by race requires further study. Given these findings, coupled with other studies suggesting that statins may reduce risk of advanced prostate cancer, randomised controlled trials are warranted to formally test the hypothesis that statins slow prostate cancer progression...|$|E

AIM: To investigate determinants of patients' desire to preserve sexual activity <b>before</b> <b>RP</b> and surgeons' final decision to perform a nerve-sparing RP (NSRP). METHODS: Overall, 2, 408 prostate cancer patients, candidates to RP, from 136 urologic departments across the Italian territory were evaluated in a multicenter prospective observational study. All patients underwent RP, according to single-center indications and procedures. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Age, body mass index, previous benign prostatic hyperplasia history, preoperative tumor characteristics, quality of life through the Short Form Health Survey (SF- 12), and the University of California Los Angeles Prostate Cancer Index (UCLA-PCI), erectile function through the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF- 5), desire to preserve sexual activity, NS operative outcomes, and surgical margins status were recorded. RESULTS: Overall, 1, 667 were interested to preserve sexual activity. Age, physical component summary of SF 12 (PCS- 12), sexual function score of UCLA-PCI, and IIEF- 5 score were the main determinants of such interest. Only 1, 246 patients were suitable for a NSRP according to guidelines. Surgeons performed a non-NSRP (NNSRP) in 1, 234 patients, a unilateral NSRP in 318 and a bilateral NSRP in 856. Age, bioptical Gleason score, percentage of positive cores, PCS- 12, and patient's desire to preserve sexual activity were the main determinants of final decision for a NSRP. Surgeons performed a NSRP in 424 not suitable and in 121 not interested patients. Positive surgical margins in not suitable patients submitted to NSRP were not higher if compared to that obtained after NNSRP in the same subgroup. Limits include lack of oncological and functional follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients are interested to preserve sexual activity. Discrepancies exist among patients' preferences, guidelines' indications, and surgeon's final decision...|$|E

40|$|Purpose We {{evaluated}} whether preoperative erectile {{function is}} associated with pathologic features in the patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP). Materials and Methods We reviewed medical records of 1, 743 men who underwent RP from November 2003 through May 2012. Of these, 50 patients who had prior hormone therapy and 272 patients who had lacking data of International Index of Erectile Function- 5 (IIEF- 5) were excluded. Men whose IIEF- 5 was in the lower 25 percentile were assigned as Low Erectile Function group {{and the others were}} assigned as Control group. We compared pathologic features using univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis between two groups. Results A total of 1, 421 patients were included in the analysis. Patients&# 8217; age was 65. 8 &# 177; 6. 7 years and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was 12. 8 &# 177; 16. 1 ng/mL. Median and low 25 percentile of IIEF- 5 were 14 and 8, respectively. Low Erectile Function group (IIEF- 5 < 8) had higher risk to have high Gleason score (&# 8805; 7 (4 + 3), odds ratio (OR) 1. 642, p< 0. 001) and large tumor volume (&# 8805; 5 mL, OR 1. 292, p= 0. 042). Even after adjusting age, year of surgery, body mass index, Charlson comorbidity index, PSA, clinical stage and biopsy Gleason score, Low Erectile Function group still had higher risk of high Gleason score (OR 1. 910, p< 0. 001) and large tumor volume (OR 1. 390, p= 0. 04) by multivariable logistic regressions. Conclusions Lower erectile function <b>before</b> <b>RP</b> was associated with higher Gleason&# 8217;s score and larger tumor volume in final pathology.

40|$|To {{determine}} if there are significant differences in biochemical characteristics, biopsy variables, histopathological data, and rates of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) recurrence between African-American (AA) and white American (WA) men undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP), as AA men {{are twice as likely}} to die from prostate cancer than their white counterparts. PATIENTS AND METHODS We established a cohort of 1058 patients (402 AA, 646 WA) who had RP and were followed for PSA recurrence. Age, race, serum PSA, biopsy Gleason score, clinical stage, pathological stage, and PSA recurrence data were available for the cohort. The chi-square test of proportions and t -tests were used to assess basic associations with race, and log-rank tests and Cox regression models for time to PSA recurrence. Forward stepwise variable selection was used to assess the effect on the risk of PSA recurrence for race, adjusted by the other variables added one at a time. RESULTS The AA men had higher baseline PSA levels, more high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) in the biopsy, and more HGPIN in the pathology specimen than WA men. The AA men also had a shorter mean (sd) PSA doubling time <b>before</b> <b>RP,</b> at 4. 2 [*](4. 7) vs 5. 2 [*](5. 9) [*]years. However, race was not an independent predictor of PSA recurrence (P [*]=[*] 0. 225). Important predictors for PSA recurrence in a multivariable model were biopsy HGPIN (P [*]<[*] 0. 014), unilateral vs bilateral cancer (P [*]<[*] 0. 006), pathology Gleason score and positive margin status (both P [*]<[*] 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS This study indicates that while there are racial differences in baseline serum PSA and incidence of HGPIN, race is not an independent risk factor for PSA recurrence. Rather, other variables such as pathology Gleason score, bilateral cancers, HGPIN and margin positivity are independently associated with PSA recurrence. The PSA doubling time after recurrence may also be important, leading to the increased mortality of AA men with prostate cancer...|$|E
40|$|Prostate cancer (CaP) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{relevant}} causes of cancer death in Western Countries. Although detection of CaP at early curable stage is highly desirable, actual screening methods present limitations and new molecular approaches are needed. Gene expression analysis increases our knowledge about the biology of CaP and may render novel molecular tools, but the identification of accurate biomarkers for reliable molecular diagnosis is a real challenge. We describe here the diagnostic power of a novel 8 -genes signature: ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), ornithine decarboxylase antizyme (OAZ), adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC), spermidine/spermine N(1) -acetyltransferase (SSAT), histone H 3 (H 3), growth arrest specific gene (GAS 1), glyceraldehyde 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and Clusterin (CLU) in tumour detection/classification of human CaP. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The 8 -gene signature was detected by retrotranscription real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) in frozen prostate surgical specimens obtained from 41 patients diagnosed with CaP and recommended to undergo radical prostatectomy (RP). No therapy was given to patients at any time <b>before</b> <b>RP.</b> The bio-bank used for the study consisted of 66 specimens: 44 were benign-CaP paired from the same patient. Thirty-five were classified as benign and 31 as CaP after final pathological examination. Only molecular data were used for classification of specimens. The Nearest Neighbour (NN) classifier was used in order to discriminate CaP from benign tissue. Validation of final results was obtained with 10 -fold cross-validation procedure. CaP versus benign specimens were discriminated with (80 +/- 5) % accuracy, (81 +/- 6) % sensitivity and (78 +/- 7) % specificity. The method also correctly classified 71 % of patients with Gleason score or = 7, an important predictor of final outcome. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The method showed high sensitivity in a collection of specimens in which a significant portion of the total (13 / 31, equal to 42 %) was considered CaP on the basis of having less than 15 % of cancer cells. This result supports the notion of the "cancer field effect", in which transformed cells extend beyond morphologically evident tumour. The molecular diagnosis method here described is objective and less subjected to human error. Although further confirmations are needed, this method poses the potential to enhance conventional diagnosis...|$|E

The present study aimed at investigating cortical correlates of motor planning and production when execution and imagery of real-life gestures are performed, with an additional focus on potential specificities of meaningful transitive/intransitive gestures. Electrophysiological (Readiness Potential – RP) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) measures were analyzed to investigate the relationship between processes supporting action planning, execution and imagination. Participants were instructed to observe videos presenting various gestures and then to execute or to imagine them. We observed comparable <b>RP</b> <b>before</b> gesture execution and imagination, with a “facilitation effect” of transitive gestures in particular for imagination. Further, while the supplementary motor regions showed similar O 2 Hb profiles during both execution and imagination of transitive/intransitive gestures, premotor and posterior parietal areas showed specificities respectively for execution processes and transitive gesture execution. Finally, regression analyses showed that RP amplitude is a predictive factor of subsequent hemodynamic brain activity during action production. Such predictive role was modulated by both task and gesture type factors...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSince {{prostate-specific antigen}} (PSA) {{screening}} {{began in the}} 1980 s in Taiwan, {{there has been a}} significant increase in the detection of prostate cancers (PCs) at an earlier stage. For clinically localized PC, a radical prostatectomy (RP) remains the gold standard treatment. However, patients undergoing a RP for PC are at risk of onset or worsening of inguinal hernias (IHs). We reviewed the current status of IHs after a RP. We reviewed literature published from PubMed using the key words of “inguinal hernia”, “prostatectomy”, and “prostate cancer”. The postprostatectomy mechanism was illustrated. The incidences of various prostatectomies were recorded. The prediction and prevention of postprostatectomy IHs were analyzed. Disruption of the transversalis fascia caused by surgical procedures was proposed as contributing to postprostatectomy-related IH formation because it assaults the anatomic-physiological balance in the abdominal wall. The myopectineal orifice is traversed by the spermatic cord and femoral vessels, and its inner surface is sealed by the transversalis fascia. A body mass index of < 23  kg/m 2 and a history of previous IH repair were significant risk factors for postoperative IH. The incidence of IHs after surgery was reported to range from 12. 4 % to 23. 9 %, and most IHs occur within 6 – 24 months postprostatectomy. The incidence of IHs is greater with the extraperitoneal approach than with the transperitoneal approach. A preoperative abdominal computed tomography (CT) -scan might identify asymptomatic IHs, but the test lacks sensitivity and is inferior to a simple physical examination (PE). A PE of the groin should be performed <b>before</b> a <b>RP,</b> and careful surgical manipulation is essential to prevent postoperative IHs. The concurrent repair of any detectable IHs at the time of a prostatectomy could significantly reduce the incidence of postoperative IHs...|$|R
