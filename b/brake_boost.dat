25|$|Commercial {{versions}} {{were called}} Pro in Japan, and were available with either two or five seats (Pro T/F). The Pro {{had to make}} do without <b>brake</b> <b>boost</b> (until the 1985 facelift) and transistorized ignition (lowering power by two horsepower), and were also not available with the five speed manual transmission. The bare-bones Pro also had a manual choke.|$|E
5000|$|Brake Assist detects {{circumstances}} in which emergency braking is required by measuring {{the speed with which}} the brake pedal is depressed. Some systems additionally take into account the rapidity of which the accelerator pedal is released, pre-tensioning the brakes when a [...] "panic release" [...] of the accelerator pedal is noted. When panic braking is detected, the Brake Assist system automatically develops maximum <b>brake</b> <b>boost</b> in order to mitigate a driver's tendency to brake without enough force. In doing so, Brake Assist has been shown to reduce stopping distance by a significant margin (up to 20% in some studies).|$|E
50|$|Albert Dewandre (Liege, Belgium), an {{engineer}} and business owner, was the inventor of servo-brake or brake booster system “Dewandre” in 1927. It is a <b>brake</b> <b>boosting</b> system that uses the depression caused by the suction in the intake manifold of an internal combustion engine to reduce {{the pressure on the}} brake pedal. The advantage of the Dewandre system is twofold: a softer push on the brake pedal, but also a notably shorter braking distance. His invention was manufactured and sold through the Robert Bosch company.|$|R
50|$|In 2012 General Motors {{released}} its Chevrolet Malibu Eco model with eAssist technology, which combines start-stop technology with regenerative <b>braking</b> and electric <b>boost</b> in certain conditions.|$|R
50|$|Braking system. The V8 and V12 W140 models {{distributed}} more {{braking power}} to the rear wheels, increasing stopping effectiveness. In 1996, the W140 received Brake Assist System BAS, which engaged during emergency maneuvers to <b>boost</b> <b>braking</b> power to maximum.|$|R
25|$|The Arwing is {{the primary}} craft used by the Star Fox team. The Arwing can use its boost meter to perform four special moves to avoid {{collisions}} and get the drop on pursuers: <b>boost,</b> <b>brake,</b> the U-turn, and the aforementioned somersault.|$|R
50|$|The Su-17 was {{designed}} to closely match the theoretical TsAGI calculations for supersonic performance. The aircraft had a 50° swept wing fitted with air <b>brakes</b> and <b>boosted</b> controls. A unique feature was {{that in addition to}} an ejection seat, the entire nose section of the aircraft could separate {{from the rest of the}} airframe. The project was canceled with no flights due to problems with wing structure, ongoing difficulties with the development of the TR-3 engine, and the closure of the Sukhoi OKB. The only example was eventually used as a gunfire target.|$|R
50|$|The S1 Montecarlos and Scorpions {{suffered}} from overly <b>boosted</b> <b>brakes,</b> which caused the fronts {{to lock up}} easily in the wet. These were often criticised in reviews; for example Road & Track complained of 'severe front locking and 37% fade' and Motor that they found 'it disconcertingly easy to lock up the front wheels when approaching corners'.|$|R
5000|$|The G506 had {{a ladder}} frame with two live beam axles on semi-elliptic leaf springs. GM banjo type axles were used, these axles {{were also used}} in later GMC CCKW [...] ton (2,268kg) trucks. There were three {{wheelbase}}s, 125 in extra short wheelbase used only on the G7128 Bomb servicer, 145 in short wheelbase, and the 175 in long wheelbase. All models had hydraulic <b>brakes</b> with vacuum <b>boost,</b> 7.50-20” tires and dual rear tires.|$|R
50|$|The Dart is {{equipped}} with numerous safety features, such as: brake assist, brake-lock differential, rainy <b>brake</b> support, hydraulic <b>boost</b> compensation, electronic stability control, traction control, anti-lock braking system, electronic roll mitigation, hill-start assist, trailer-sway control, rear backup camera and rear park assist. The Dart has 10 airbags standard; {{it also has a}} reactive head-restraint system for the front seats, and other available systems are blind-spot monitoring and rear cross path detection. The Giulietta, on which the Dart is based, has achieved the highest rating for a compact car in the EuroNCAP tests.|$|R

50|$|Vacuum {{may be used}} to power, {{or provide}} {{assistance}} to mechanical devices. In hybrid and diesel engine motor vehicles, a pump fitted on the engine (usually on the camshaft) is used to produce vacuum. In petrol engines, instead, vacuum is typically obtained as a side-effect of the operation of the engine and the flow restriction created by the throttle plate, but may be also supplemented by an electrically operated vacuum pump to <b>boost</b> <b>braking</b> assistance or improve fuel consumption. This vacuum may then be used to power the following motor vehicle components: vacuum servo booster for the hydraulic brakes, motors that move dampers in the ventilation system, throttle driver in the cruise control servomechanism, door locks or trunk releases.|$|R
5000|$|BAS Plus with Cross-Traffic Assist: {{can also}} come to the driver's aid {{when there is a}} risk of a {{collision}} with cross traffic at junctions. If this anticipatory system detects a hazardous situation of this type, it prompts the driver to start emergency braking by activating visual and acoustic warnings. If the driver presses the brake pedal too tentatively, BAS PLUS will step in by automatically <b>boosting</b> <b>brake</b> pressure for effective emergency braking, even applying the brakes at full power if necessary. Applying {{just the right amount of}} braking power for the situation at hand maximises the available braking distance for traffic behind. The Cross-Traffic Assist function is operative at speeds up to approx. 72 km/h, while BAS PLUS is able to aid the driver in longitudinal situations at any speed.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the brake}} pedal is applied, the {{movement}} pushes against a small spring which pushes against an air valve thus opening it to allow atmospheric pressure air to {{flow into the}} [...] "supply" [...] chamber of the booster. Once the pedal stops advancing forward, the air valve closes again and can open further to allow more air in for continued <b>boosted</b> <b>braking.</b> Since the pressure becomes higher in one chamber (or [...] "supply" [...] chamber), the diaphragm moves toward the lower pressure chamber (or [...] "vacuum" [...] chamber) with a force created by {{the area of the}} diaphragm and the differential pressure. This force, in addition to the driver's foot force, pushes on the master cylinder piston. When the pedal is allowed to return to rest, the air from the supply chamber escapes to the vacuum chamber and can then flow towards the source of vacuum.|$|R
40|$|Iveco {{has started}} {{production}} of new advanced diesel engine Cursor 8 in 1998. In 1999 {{this was followed}} with the new Cursor 10 engine which reaches a maximum power of 316 kW with a displacement of 10, 3 dm 3 and continuous the strategy of developing high BMEP engines which Iveco began more than 10 years ago. This approach shows the benefits of reduced noise, weight and fuel consumption in trucks in comparison to engines having a larger cylinder capacity with the same power. Together with the engine, Iveco introduces an electronic control system with full authority on every operating condition, realising a true drive-by-wire mode of truck operation. The control of fuelling, <b>boosting,</b> <b>braking</b> and cold starting gives the driver full comfort and guarantees that the engine produces optimum performance under every circumstance. An advanced diagnostic system warns about deviations from acceptable operating conditions or fault occurrences. Advanced technologies have been extensively used in the new engine, like variable geometry turbocharger, high pressure unit injectors mechanically driven by an overhead camshaft, decompression brake, fibre filters and advanced casting technologies. It further features 4 valves per cylinder, wet liners and the gear train is arranged {{at the rear of}} the engine. The paper presents, besides the engine design features and performance achievements, the advanced methods employed during the development phase both in Iveco and by suppliers...|$|R
5000|$|The five {{star rating}} system for each race, {{the use of}} primary and {{secondary}} objectives introduced in Asphalt 6: Adrenaline and also used in Asphalt 7 have all been retained in Asphalt 8. Three stars are awarded for finishing in first place, two for second, and one for third. Achieving secondary objectives, such as performing a given number of stunts or knocking down opponents, awards the player with two additional stars. Obtaining stars in an event is cumulative - players who finished first in an event without completing the secondary objectives may replay the race and obtain a five-star rating even if the primary objectives aren't met. The core gameplay is slightly different, however. As the subtitle implies, the focus of Airborne is on jumping, with tracks featuring a lot more ramps than in previous games. In addition to performing standard jumps, the player can also perform flat spins (by drifting onto a ramp) and barrel rolls (by hitting curved ramps). All jumps earn nitro boost; the longer the airtime, the more boost earned. Destroying obstacles such as barriers and lamp posts or hitting traffic cars also earns nitros. Another new feature, which substitutes the [...] "Adrenaline mode" [...] in Asphalt 6 and 7, {{is the ability to}} perform a [...] "Perfect Nitro". When the player hits boost, a small red zone appears in the boost bar. If the player hits boost again when the boost meter is in the red zone, the car will accelerate even faster, with the boost lasting until the player runs out of <b>boost,</b> <b>brakes,</b> crashes or hits a ramp.|$|R
