40|$|There are {{two species}} of hakes {{distributed}} in waters off Mauritania, that {{are commonly known as}} black hakes, Merluccius senegalensis Cadenat, 1950 and Merluccius polli Cadenat, 1950. Both species overlaps their bathymetric distribution on the continental shelf and slope where they are fished by Spanish trawling and <b>bottom</b> <b>longliner</b> fleets, which implies mixed fishing statistics. During 2003 and 2004 there were conducted several scientific watching campaigns onboard of trawler ships as well as two experimental campaigns onboard in a longliner ship. Based on obtained data, in the present work there are analyzed general aspects of time-space variation of both species population. It is stated a dependence distribution on depth. M. senegalensis was found in poor quantities deeper than 500 m. The overlapping between both species took place from 150 to 500 m, and M. polli were caught by trawling in deepest waters, more than 900 m. M. polli was the predominant specie of the trawling fleet catches (88 % in weight) that fishing on deep waters, whereas M. senegalensis was the most abundant specie into the longliners fishing area, reaching 67 % of the catches. The specimens of both species increase in size with depth, being the average lengths of M. senegalensis larger than M. polli. It was found significant difference between the length frequency distributions of both species in all the strata of depth...|$|E
50|$|These {{automated}} <b>bottom</b> <b>longliners</b> fish using hooks strung on long lines. The hooks are baited automatically and {{the lines}} are released very fast. Many thousands of hooks are set each day, the retrieval and setting of these hooks is a continuous 24-hour-a-day operation. These ships go to sea for six weeks at a time. They contain factories for processing fish into fillets, which are frozen in packs, ready for market, within hours of being caught. These vessels sometimes also have fishmeal plants on board.|$|R
40|$|Poster session. A {{comparative}} multi-fleet rationale {{of socioeconomic}} indicators is described aiming a potential incorporation into fishery management advice at an ecosystem scale. A set of performance indicators, {{based on a}} survey of different industrial fishing fleets in São Paulo (SE Brazil) which investigated investment, fixed, effort, labour and sailingrelated costs and profits, allowed for inter-fleet comparison. Costs varied between fleets with fuel being the main cost. In general, indicators of profitability and economic efficiency reveal best economic performance per fishing trip for <b>bottom</b> <b>longliners</b> and both surface and bottom-gillnet fleets mainly due to their relatively low percentage of variable cost. Purse-seiners and shrimp-trawlers, targeting mainly overexploited species, showed the worst performance of both profitability and economic efficiency mainly related to their high variable costs and relatively low catches. However, in terms of jobs generated, purse-seiners had the greatest value and the sea-bob-shrimp fleet showed the lowest crew size per vessel but generated the second highest total number of direct jobs. The inter-fleet cost and socioeconomic performance analyses reveal that additional attention {{should be given to}} the poor profitability of fleets, rent drain, fishing impacts, and open-access related issues, while social indicators might be also considered. Results may calibrate predictions related to management trade-offs between ecological, economic, and social benefits {{in the context of an}} ecosystem approach to fisheries...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMarine Protected Areas (MPAs) are {{generally}} {{considered as one}} of the most important tools, among the many regulations, designed to preserve marine resources as well as enhance fisheries. In the southern Bay of Biscay, local French fishermen requested creation of a restricted area to help settle disputes between the various métiers operating there. This restricted area, which lies mainly in French waters, covers part of a deep submarine canyon off the French and Spanish coasts, known to have a large population of mature hake. This study aims to better understand the effects of a restricted area upon French fleets operating there, particularly upon three main métiers-longliners, gillnetters and trawlers. The study area includes three ICES statistical rectangles. The data, based upon reported landings and auctions sales for the period 1985 - 2008, were analyzed using multivariate analysis. The fishing activity is more important in one rectangle which includes the restricted area. <b>Bottom</b> <b>longliners</b> and gillnetters, operate mainly in this one while trawlers are less dependent. The first métier concentrates particularly on hake and the second has targeted other species and has become less dependent on hake. Trawlers target a wider range of species. Over the past ten years, the restricted area has contributed to maintain the fleets operating here. The border with Spain adds other constraints over the issue of access to regional fisheries and makes management a little more complicated. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Most of the Icelandic cod {{is caught}} in <b>bottom</b> {{trawlers}} or <b>longliners.</b> These two fishing methods are fundamentally different and have different economic, environmental, and even social effects. In this paper we present a hybrid-simulation framework {{to assess the impact}} of changing the ratio between cod quota allocated to vessels with longlines and vessels with bottom trawls. It makes use of conventional bioeconomic models and discrete event modelling and provides a framework for simulating life cycle assessment (LCA) for a cod fishery. The model consists of two submodels, a system dynamics model describing the biological aspect of the fishery and a discrete event model for fishing activities. The model was run multiple times for different quota allocation scenarios and results are presented where different scenarios are presented in the three dimensions of sustainability: environmental, social, and economic. The optimal allocation strategy depends on weighing the three different factors. The results were encouraging first-steps towards a useful modelling method but the study would benefit greatly from better data on fishing activities...|$|R
