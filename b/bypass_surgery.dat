5|$|Coronary artery <b>bypass</b> <b>surgery</b> is {{one such}} operation. In this operation, one or more arteries {{surrounding}} the heart that have become narrowed are bypassed. This is done by taking blood vessels harvested from {{another part of the}} body. Commonly harvested veins include the saphenous veins or the internal mammary artery. Because this operation involves the heart tissue, a machine is used so that blood can bypass the heart during the operation.|$|E

5|$|Homozygous FH {{is harder}} to treat. The LDL receptors are {{minimally}} functional, if at all. Only high doses of statins, often {{in combination with other}} medications, are modestly effective in improving lipid levels. If medical therapy is not successful at reducing cholesterol levels, LDL apheresis may be used; this filters LDL from the bloodstream in a process reminiscent of dialysis. Very severe cases may be considered for a liver transplant; this provides a liver with normally functional LDL receptors, and leads to rapid improvement of the cholesterol levels, but at the risk of complications from any solid organ transplant (such as rejection, infections, or side-effects of the medication required to suppress rejection). Other surgical techniques include partial ileal <b>bypass</b> <b>surgery,</b> in which part of the small bowel is bypassed to decrease the absorption of nutrients and hence cholesterol, and portacaval shunt surgery, in which the portal vein is connected to the vena cava to allow blood with nutrients from the intestine to bypass the liver.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} early results of {{combined}} coronary artery <b>bypass</b> graft <b>surgery</b> and carotid endarterectomy. DESIGN: Retrospective and ongoing analysis {{of patients who}} underwent combined coronary artery <b>bypass</b> graft <b>surgery</b> and carotid endarterectomy. SETTING: Cardiothoracic unit in a London teaching hospital. PATIENTS: From June 1987 to March 1995, 64 patients were identified. They were patients who were scheduled to have coronary artery <b>bypass</b> graft <b>surgery</b> or required urgent coronary revascularisation and who {{were found to have}} significant coexistent carotid disease. (Unilateral carotid stenosis > 70 %, bilateral carotid stenosis > 50 %, or unilateral carotid stenosis > 50 % with contralateral occlusion.) INTERVENTIONS: Both procedures were performed during one anaesthesia: the carotid endarterectomy was performed first without cardiopulmonary bypass. After completion of carotid endarterectomy, coronary artery <b>bypass</b> graft <b>surgery</b> was performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The incidence of stroke, transient ischaemic attack, and myocardial infarction in the early postoperative period was analysed. RESULTS: Myocardial revascularisation was successful in all 64 patients. There were no perioperative infarcts. In three patients (4. 7 %) a new neurological deficit developed postoperatively: two recovered fully before hospital discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Combined coronary artery <b>bypass</b> graft <b>surgery</b> and carotid endarterectomy were performed safely and with good results...|$|R
5|$|Randolph Chitwood, a cardiothoracic surgeon with East Carolina, {{performed}} the first minimally invasive robotic-assisted mitral-valve heart {{surgery in the}} United States. East Carolina researchers also developed an electronic fluency device called SpeechEasy; the device is designed to improve the fluency {{of a person who}} stutters by changing the sound of the user's voice in his or her ear. Walter Pories, a faculty member at The Brody School of Medicine developed the standard procedure for gastric <b>bypass</b> <b>surgery.</b> Researchers here also first discovered that 80% of obese/type 2 diabetic patients who underwent this surgical procedure had a reversal of the disease. The Biofeedback Lab is currently developing techniques to help service members recover from posttraumatic stress disorders and traumatic brain injuries they received in Afghanistan and Iraq. The in vitro fertilization program is ranked first in North Carolina and fourth overall in the United States. Jason Bond, a former scientist in the Department of Biology, discovered many new species of spiders, including Myrmekiaphila neilyoungi and Aptostichus stephencolberti.|$|E
5|$|While in Lexington for a {{deposition}} on May 26, 2002, Wilkinson began to experience chest pains and {{was admitted to}} St. Joseph's Hospital. Doctors diagnosed him with arterial blockages and scheduled him for arterial <b>bypass</b> <b>surgery.</b> Before the surgery could be performed, however, doctors discovered another lymphatic mass. Wilkinson began taking chemotherapy, and doctors removed the mass on June 4, 2002. Wilkinson was placed on life support on June 26, 2002. He suffered a stroke on July 4, 2002. Wilkinson had previously instructed his family not to continue life support after all hope of recovery was gone; accordingly, they decided to withdraw life support, and Wilkinson died on July 5, 2002. He was originally buried at Blue Grass Memorial Gardens in Nicholasville, Kentucky. In August 2002, his coffin was moved to a locked mausoleum at Sarasota Memorial Park in Sarasota, Florida; the family chose July 4, 2002 as the date of death for his marker.

5|$|Towson United Methodist Church has a 3-manual, 48-rank Casavant {{pipe organ}} of 2,790pipes, {{including}} seven ranks of 16ft. pipes and tubular chimes. It was dedicated {{in memory of}} S. Clayton Seitz by then-organist John Duwane Hoffman on May 11, 1958. Hoffman, the church's esteemed virtuoso organist and Minister of Music between 19571988, {{was a graduate of}} Union Theological Seminary's renowned Master of Sacred Music degree program, after having earned Bachelor of Music and Master of Music degrees at the University of Denver. At Union, Hoffman studied the organ with Clarence Dickinson and Vernon De Tar. In addition to serving as the church's organist and choral director, Hoffman was professor of organ at Towson State University. He died unexpectedly on July 4, 1988 of complications following heart <b>bypass</b> <b>surgery.</b> The church library is named in his memory. Hoffman was succeeded by Kathie Metz, a graduate of Marshall University, as Director of Music and Organist 19882012. The current Director of Music and Organist since July, 2013, is Douglas Hollida. An ordained minister, Rev. Hollida studied music at Shepherd University, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree, and then earned a Master of Divinity degree from Trinity Episcopal School for Ministry.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThis study {{explores the}} {{relative}} {{early and late}} mortality risks in women and men after coronary artery <b>bypass</b> graft <b>surgery.</b> MethodsThis was a retrospective cohort study (n = 54, 425 patients, 12, 079 women) using clinical data for all patients who underwent isolated coronary artery <b>bypass</b> graft <b>surgery</b> in Ontario between fiscal years 1991 and 1999 obtained from the Cardiac Care Network database, with outcomes of early (≤ 1 year) and late (> 1 year up to 10 years) interval mortality identified through linkage to administrative databases. ResultsFemale surgical candidates were older (65 vs 62 years, P <. 0001) and higher-risk patients. The risk-adjusted survival of female patients was worse than that of male patients {{in the first year}} after coronary artery <b>bypass</b> graft <b>surgery,</b> but their long-term mortality was similar to that of male patients. The Cox proportional hazards model for early mortality had an adjusted female hazard ratio of 1. 44 (95 % confidence interval, 1. 29 - 1. 61; P =. 02). This significantly differed from the late mortality model, which had a hazard ratio of 0. 89 (95 % confidence interval, 0. 78 - 1. 0; P =. 06). ConclusionsEarly mortality was significantly higher for women after coronary artery <b>bypass</b> graft <b>surgery,</b> despite adjustment for confounding factors. However, the long-term relative mortality risk for women appeared equivalent to or even better than that experienced by men as early as 1 year after coronary artery <b>bypass</b> graft <b>surgery.</b> This population-based study of long-term mortality supports the benefits of coronary artery <b>bypass</b> graft <b>surgery</b> for women in the current era. However, {{further research is needed to}} identify ways to reduce early postoperative mortality in women...|$|R
