40|$|The bigmouth <b>buffalofish,</b> Ictiobus cyprinellus (Valenciennes) is {{the only}} <b>buffalofish</b> {{occurring}} in Saskatchewan. The species supports at present a small and erratic commercial fishery in this province, but {{has been an important}} commercial species in the Mississippi for many years. Rather uniform catches of II to 16 million pounds were the rule in the Mississippi system from 1894 to 1922 (Sette, 1925). In Saskatchewan the species is regarded as a rough fish, and accused of detrimental effects on game fish populations. A life history study was therefore desirable to provide information on its relation to other species of fish, and its value as a commercial species in Saskatchewan waters. Knowledge of the rate of growth, preproduction, ecology, and distribution could benefit the commercial fishery for <b>buffalofish</b> on Last Mountain and Pasqua Lakes and recent years the species has been the object of revived interest in pond culture in the United States (Swingle, 1949; 1954; 1957). In the future such protein foods may have unpredicted importance even in agricultural Saskatchewan. Basic lake surveys have been carried out on Last Mountain Lake (Atton and Murray, 1952) and the six Qu'Appelle Lakes (results in preparation) over a period of six years. During these surveys the usual fishing gear captured only small numbers of <b>buffalofish,</b> although they were known to be abundant. The present investigation, carried out from 1955 to 1958, has provided additional data and the opportunity to summarize the information available concerning this species...|$|E
40|$|The {{waters of}} the Mississippi River and the Great Lakes are a {{potential}} source of several hundred million pounds of food {{in the form of}} tasty lake and river fishes. This rich resource of the inland waters is important to a nation at war. Because of the growing meat shortage, people will eat more fish than in pre-war years. In the interior of the country, people will eat more fresh-water fish than before, because fish are good and nutritious and because, in the coming months, the shipments of rosefish, halibut, shrimp, and other seafoods that come to them from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf coasts may be curtailed. Among the scores of fishes native to the Mississippi and the Great Lakes are many excellent food fishes, some of them little known even in the States that produce them in greatest quantity. These fishes, if known and properly used, will add variety to wartime meals and health-giving proteins, minerals, and vitamins to the diet. This publication has been written to acquaint the people of the Middle West with their native food fishes as individual species differing in their food qualities, their adaptability to various methods of preparation, and their seasons of availability. 3 ̆e Contents: Introduction • Fish have a high nutritive value • General guides for selecting and preparing fish • How to buy • When to buy • Common market forms • Canned fish • Salt or smoked fish • Fat content of fish • Sauces and garnishes • Available supplies of fish in midwestern waters • Seasonal variations in the market supply • Biographies of midwestern fishes • Carp • <b>Buffalofishes</b> • Suckers • Catfishes and bullheads • Sheepshead • Smelt • Burbot • Bowfin • Gars or gar pikes • Whitefish • Lake herring • Lake trout • Chubs • Yellow perch • Pike • Pike perches • Crappies • Bluegill sunfish • Bibliography iv + 44 pages; 26 illustrations.

40|$|Commercial netting {{occurred}} October through April, 1971 - 1976 on Nimrod Lake {{and from}} October through April, 1973 - 1977 on Blue Mountain Lake in west central Arkansas. Using 7. 6 cm or larger mesh gill and/or trammel nets, commercial fishermen harvested commercial fishes (<b>buffalofishes</b> [Ictiobus spp. ]; common carp [Cyprinus carpio], carpsuckers [Carpiodes spp. ]; drum [Aplodinotus grunniens]; gars [Lepisosteus spp. ]; suckers [Catostomidae); and catfishes [Ictalurus spp. and Pylodictis olivaris]). During the study period, cove rotenone samples {{were conducted on}} an annual basis. Fishes collected were placed into age classes and enumerated. Data were then grouped into general categories (black basses [Micropterus spp], crappie [Pomoxis spp. ], sunfishes [Lepomis spp], clupeid fishes [Dorosoma spp], commercial fishes and catfishes) and analyzed. Substantial reductions in standing crops of commercial fishes were noted in both reservoirs. However, in Blue Mountain Lake, reductions were temporary and commercial fish biomasses had begun to increase markedly {{by the end of}} the study period. As catfishes were the species principally sought by commercial fishermen, it was somewhat surprising that total catfish biomasses increased in Blue Mountain Lake following the start of netting. For three of the four years prior to netting, catfish spawns were not recorded from Nimrod Lake. However, following the instigation of netting, spawns were recorded for the following four years. Sport fish populations for the most part were unharmed by the commercial netting. In some instances, sport fish populations appeared to improve during the study period. Visual analysis revealed that the increases in numerical standing crops of smaller sport fishes in Blue Mountain Lake appeared to correspond to decreases in commercial fish biomasses. Significant(P ≤ 0. 05) increases in sport fish young-of-the-year numbers were recorded for crappie in Blue Mountain Lake and sunfishes in Nimrod Lake and Blue Mountain Lake. Increases in numerical standing crops were also observed among intermediate black bass and crappie populations of both study lakes. Adult black bass mean numerical standing crops were virtually unchanged in both study lakes. Adult crappie and sunfish population exhibited some variation in the study. A small increase in the adult crappie population was observed in Nimrod Lake, while a significant increase (P ≤ 0. 05) in the adult sunfish population was noted in Nimrod Lake. In Blue Mountain Lake, an expansion of the forage base occurred which included an increase in the number of both adult and intermediate clupeid fishes present. Adult shad populations decreased in Nimrod Lake, while the numbers of young-of-the-year shad were lower in both study lakes. It was felt that the netting program contributed significantly to the increases in sport fish populations in both lakes. However, other uncontrollable factors may have also influenced the sport fish populations in the two lakes (i. e. winter and spring water levels) ...|$|R
