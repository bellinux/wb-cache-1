25|$|The {{best thing}} {{was simply the}} {{privilege}} {{and the challenge of}} being able to take a shot at the first female captain, transcending stereotypes that I was very familiar with. I was able to do that in front of millions of viewers. That was a remarkable experience—and it continues to resonate. The downside of that is also that it continues to resonate, and threatens to eclipse all else in one's long career if one does not up the ante and stay at it, in a way that may not ordinarily be necessary. I have to work at changing and constantly reinventing myself in a way that probably would not have happened had Star Trek not come along. I knew that going in, and I think that all of the perks attached to this journey have <b>been</b> <b>really</b> inexpressively great. So the negatives are small.|$|E

500|$|Groening also {{expressed}} a {{wish to make}} Simpstasia, a parody of Fantasia; it was never produced, partly {{because it would have}} been too difficult to write a feature-length script.

500|$|After Hartman's {{murder in}} 1998, rather than replace {{him with a}} new voice actor, the {{production}} staff retired McClure, along with Hartman's other recurring character, Lionel Hutz, from the show.
