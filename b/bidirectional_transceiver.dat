40|$|In this dissertation, millimeter-wave {{transmitter}} {{systems and}} a <b>bidirectional</b> <b>transceiver</b> front-end circuit are presented. To reach {{high data rate}} for next generation communication systems, complex modulation schemes such as QAM are necessary {{to take advantage of}} the signal bandwidth. In a transmitter system, higher-order QAM not only requires the PA to operate in linear region, while the output power and efficiency are maintained, but also requires the calibrations for the modulator to minimize the EVM. The rst portion of the dissertation presents the dual-band (Q-band/W-band) direct-conversion transmitter in 120 -nm SiGe BiCMOS process. The dual-band feature is the use of the proposed transmission- line-based dual-band load on RF and LO amplifiers to allow the transmitter to operate at two distinct bands. Furthermore, this dual-band transmitter applies a new I/Q correction techniques, which calibrates amplitude and phase mismatch from analog baseband, and can achieve the sideband suppression ratio above 40 dBc at both Q-band and W-band. The EVM improvement can be clearly found from the constellation diagram at both bands. In addition, a high-efficiency PA must introduce nonlinear terms and degrade the EVM. Therefore, in addition to the I/Q mismatch, other errors from a transmitter such as LO leakage, AM-AM, AM-PM distortion and memory effects must be calibrated to improve the EVM. The second portion of this dissertation discusses the demonstrations of 45 -GHz and 94 -GHz transmitter systems with digital predistortion (DPD) to compromise the linearity/efficiency trade-off. The 45 -GHz transmitter system uses the second portion SiGe modulator and a two-by-two PA/antenna array, which PAs are implemented in 45 -nm SOI CMOS process. The digital signal is programmed in an FPGA-based processor, so an all silicon-based solution is verified at 45 GHz (Q-band). The 94 -GHz transmitter system uses a two-step frequency conversion architecture to send the modulated data to 94 -GHz band and a two-by-four PA/antenna array, which is implemented in 45 -nm SOI CMOS process. The nonlinearities and errors of the transmitted data are significantly predistorted/calibrated and the EVM is greatly improved by DPD. The third portion of this dissertation presents a 71 to 86 -GHz (E-band) <b>bidirectional</b> <b>transceiver</b> front-end circuit implemented in 90 -nm SiGe BiCMOS process. The time-division duplex architecture avoids transmit/receive switches through the use of transistor biasing in the signal path to minimize high-frequency loss. The low-noise amplifier (LNA) and power amplifier (PA) are combined into a novel PA/LNA circuit, which alleviates the parasitic loading of each circuit. In transmit mode, the <b>bidirectional</b> <b>transceiver</b> transmits a maximum saturated power of 11 dBm at 78 GHz with a 3 -dB bandwidth from 71 to 86 GHz. In receive mode, the maximum 30. 6 -dB conversion gain and the minimum 6. 6 -dB noise figure are measured at 73 GHz...|$|E
40|$|Software defined radio (SDR) allows {{unprecedented}} {{levels of}} flexibility by transitioning the {{radio communication system}} from a rigid hardware platform to a more user-controlled software paradigm. However, it can still be time consuming to design and implement such SDRs as they typically require thorough knowledge of the operating environment and a careful tuning of the program. In this work, our contribution is {{the design of a}} <b>bidirectional</b> <b>transceiver</b> that runs on the commonly used USRP platform and implemented in MATLAB using standard tools like MATLAB Coder and MEX to speed up the processing steps. We outline strategies on how to create a state-action based design, wherein the same node switches between transmitter and receiver functions. Our design allows optimal selection of the parameters towards meeting the timing requirements set forth by various processing blocks associated with a DBPSK physical layer and CSMA/CA/ACK MAC layer so that all operations remain functionally compliant with the IEEE 802. 11 b standard for the 1 Mbps specification. The code base of the system is enabled through the Communications System Toolbox and incorporates channel sensing and exponential random back-off for contention resolution. The current work provides an experimental testbed that enables creation of new MAC protocols starting from the fundamental IEEE 802. 11 b standard. Our design approach guarantees consistent performance of the bi-directional link, and the three node experimental results demonstrate the robustness of the system in mitigating packet collisions and enforcing fairness among nodes, making it a feasible framework in higher layer protocol design.

40|$|Passive {{packaging}} and connection at reasonable costs is feasible by manufacture in microengineering of a precise optical bench, with the mounts for the hybrid components structures to micrometer accuracy {{at the position}} needed for the beam path. As the hybrid optical components usually differ in size, the microoptical bench has {{to be given a}} three-dimensional structure to allow the components to be arranged on the optical axis. The LIGA technique is particularly suited for manufacture of this microoptical bench because X-ray lithography with synchrotron radiation is capable of satisfying extreme requirements for accuracy made on the microoptical assemblies, even for structural heights of typically several hundreds of micrometers and with the lateral geometry of the holding structures not subjected to any restrictions. In a process comprising several stages and by combination, respectively, with other microstructuring techniques precisely stepped microoptical benches may be structured in addition. To make use of the advantages of monolithic structuring in the two lateral dimensions (maximum error of lateral positioning 1 #mu#m per microbench), all structures for lateral component fixing are made in parallel by X-ray lithography. The optical function of the prestructured substrate used is restricted to vertical positioning of the components. Under the techniques examined for prestructuring - anisotropic wet-chemical Si-etching and the LIGA process - comparable tolerances have been obtained in level setting (387. 5 #+-# 0. 5 #mu#m) which satisfy the requirements for precision in applications with single-mode fibers. With a view to practical implementtion of the process engineering fundamentals two systems were built under the modular design concept for the purpose of demonstration, a <b>bidirectional</b> <b>transceiver</b> module and an optomechanical bypass switch. The performance data of the two demonstration systems support the concept of modular design. Together with knowledge gathered in the process they provide the prerequisite of manufacturing diverse microoptical and fiber-optical functional modules using the LIGA technique. (orig.)

40|$|In this dissertation, {{high-speed}} and high-frequency millimeter-wave circuit {{techniques are}} introduced for silicon integrated circuit processes. A transimpedance limit for multistage transimpedance amplifiers (TIAs) is derived {{and applied to}} a bandwidth enhancement technique using inductive-series [pi] networks. A 40 -Gb/s TIA is demonstrated in a 0. 13 [mu]m CMOS process and achieves a transimpedance gain of 50 dB[omega] with a 3 -dB bandwidth of 29 GHz. A low-power optical front-end is implemented in a 45 -nm silicon-on-insulator (SOI) CMOS process. The modulator driver uses floating body devices to generate a voltage swing of more than 2 Volts. The optical receiver exhibits a transimpedance exceeding 55 dB[omega] over 30 GHz and consumes only 9 mW from a 1 V supply. Next, a 160 - Gb/s amplifier is realized with stagger-tuned stages that are equalized for high bandwidth and low gain ripple. The staggered response is demonstrated with a Darlington feedback amplifier and a constructive wave amplifier. The broadband amplifier is implemented in a 0. 12 -[mu]m Silion- Germanium (SiGe) BiCMOS process and achieves a gain of 10 dB and 3 -dB bandwidth of 102 GHz. In contrast, a 45 -nm SOI CMOS, cascode distributed amplifier exhibits 9 -dB gain over a 3 -dB bandwidth of 92 GHz. In {{the second part of}} this dissertation, millimeter-wave circuit design techniques for wireless communication systems are presented. Constructive wave amplification is shown to amplify forward traveling waves along a single transmission line. A 0. 12 -[mu]m SiGe BiCMOS constructive wave amplifier achieves more than 37. 5 -dB gain with a 3 -dB bandwidth of 14. 6 GHz and, consequently, demonstrates a gain-bandwidth product as high as 1, 095 GHz.

40|$|Optical devices {{based on}} Planar Lightwave Circuit (PLC) {{technology}} have well been studied {{due to their}} inherited advantages from Integrated Circuits (IC), such as: small size, high reliability, mass production and potential integration with microelectronics. Among all the materials, silicon nanowire platform gains more and more interest. The large refractive index difference between core and cladding allows tremendous reduction of the component size. This thesis studies theoretically and experimentally some integrated optical devices based on silicon nanophotonic platform, including echelle grating demultiplexers and photonic crystals. Some of the numerical methods are introduced first. Scalar integral diffraction method is efficient for calculating the diffraction efficiency of gratings. Beam propagation method and finite-difference time-domain method are also introduced, for simulating the light propagation along the devices. The fabrication technology and characterization methods are described. The fabrication steps involve: plasma assisted film deposition, E-beam lithography, RIE-etching. All these steps are proceeded under cleanroom environment. The characterization is mainly based on two methods: end-fire coupling and vertical grating coupling. The grating coupler is more efficient compared with the butt-coupling between fiber and nanowires, but is worse solution for final packaging. Two types of components have been realized and characterized with the above technology. The echelle grating demultiplexer {{is one of the}} key components in WDM networks. A method for increasing the diffraction efficiency based on total internal reflection is applied, and a significant improvement of the diffraction efficiency of more than 3 dB is achieved. A novel cross-order echelle grating-based triplexer, a <b>bidirectional</b> <b>transceiver</b> for application in the Passive Optical Networks (PON), has been designed and fabricated, which can multi/demultiplex three channels located at 1310 nm, 1490 nm and 1550 nm. Polarization dependence issue of echelle grating demultiplexers has been studied. Two polarization compensation schemes have been proposed, which are for the first time polarization insensitive designs of echelle grating demultiplexers based on silicon nanowire platform. Photonic crystal devices are also addressed in the thesis. There has been little research on the photonic crystal cavity based on pillar type. A silicon pillar type photonic crystal cavity has been fabricated with the measured Q value as high as about 104, and with an extremely high sensitivity for the changing of the background material or the effective diameter of the pillars. This kind of structure has the advantage on sensing applications compared to the air-hole type structure. QC 2010082...|$|E
