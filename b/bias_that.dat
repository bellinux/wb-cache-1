5|$|Ethiopian historians such as Taddesse Tamrat (1935–2013) and Sergew Hable Sellassie {{have argued}} that modern Ethiopian studies were an {{invention}} of the 17th century and originated in Europe. Tamrat considered Carlo Conti Rossini's 1928 Storia d'Etiopia a groundbreaking work in Ethiopian studies. The philosopher Messay Kebede likewise acknowledged the genuine contributions of Western scholars {{to the understanding of}} Ethiopia's past. But he also criticized the perceived scientific and institutional <b>bias</b> <b>that</b> he found to be pervasive in Ethiopian-, African-, and Western-made historiographies on Ethiopia. Specifically, Kebede took umbrage at E. A. Wallis Budge's translation of the Kebra Nagast, arguing that Budge had assigned a South Arabian origin to the Queen of Sheba although the Kebra Nagast itself did not indicate such a provenience for this fabled ruler. According to Kebede, a South Arabian extraction was contradicted by biblical exegetes and testimonies from ancient historians, which instead indicated that the Queen was of African origin. Additionally, he chided Budge and Ullendorff for their postulation that the Aksumite civilization was founded by Semitic immigrants from South Arabia. Kebede argued that there is little physical difference between the Semitic-speaking populations in Ethiopia and neighboring Cushitic-speaking groups to validate the notion that the former groups were essentially descendants of South Arabian settlers, with a separate ancestral origin from other local Afroasiatic-speaking populations. He also observed that these Afroasiatic-speaking populations were heterogeneous, having interbred with each other and also assimilated alien elements of both uncertain extraction and negroid origin.|$|E

25|$|The {{relation}} between a probe and the mRNA {{that it is}} expected to detect is not trivial. Some mRNAs may cross-hybridize probes in the array that are supposed to detect another mRNA. In addition, mRNAs may experience amplification <b>bias</b> <b>that</b> is sequence or molecule-specific. Thirdly, probes that are designed to detect the mRNA of a particular gene may be relying on genomic EST information that is incorrectly associated with that gene.|$|E
25|$|Depending on the {{sequencing}} platform used, various biases {{may exist}} within {{the set of}} sequenced reads. For instance, strand bias can occur, {{where there is a}} highly unequal distribution of forward vs reverse directions in the reads aligned in some neighborhood. Additionally, there may occur an unusually high duplication of some reads (for instance due to bias in PCR). Such biases can result in dubious variant calls - for instance if a fragment containing a PCR error at some locus is over amplified due to PCR <b>bias,</b> <b>that</b> locus will have a high count of the false allele, and may be called as a SNV - and so analysis pipelines frequently filter calls based on these biases.|$|E

He was also fined US$10,000 and ordered to {{cooperate}} with the Internal Revenue Service and to pay money still owed for his 1998 taxes. Following his release in May 2004, he stated that his decision to take the plea bargain was motivated by the <b>bias</b> <b>that</b> he perceived in the United States federal court system and not his guilt. He said he felt the charges were contrived to derail his political career and discredit him to his followers, and that he took the safe route by pleading guilty and receiving a mitigated sentence rather than pleading not guilty and potentially receiving the full sentence.|$|E

25|$|Culminating Maier’s {{literary}} {{career was}} the long-researched The Book of Nahum. Published posthumously in 1959 from a manuscript whose text was completed before Maier’s death, The Book of Nahum was {{a return to}} Maier’s first love, Semitics. For many years, Maier had worked on this project in his leisure time, often stating his intention to fill his later years with such academic pursuits, once {{he retired from the}} limelight. This last work was an examination of the Biblical book of Nahum from the scholar’s perspective. Maier’s main interest lay in the fact that Nahum predicted the fall of the Assyrian empire at around 650 BC, some forty years before the event actually occurred. Many modern higher-critical studies have assumed that Nahum must have been written after the fall of Nineveh in 612 BC, based upon the preconceived <b>bias</b> <b>that</b> prophecy is impossible or unscientific. Maier’s work demonstrated that such predictions were in fact given many years in advance of the fulfillment. His work highlights twenty-two separate details in Nahum’s prophecies which were literally fulfilled in the fall of Nineveh. Prof. George V. Schick finished the bibliography and edited the manuscript for publication.|$|E

500|$|Confirmation bias {{is a form}} of {{cognitive}} bias, a psychological factor that contributes to belief in astrology. [...] Astrology believers tend to selectively remember predictions that turn out to be true, and do not remember those that turn out false. Another, separate, form of confirmation bias also plays a role, where believers often fail to distinguish between messages that demonstrate special ability and those that do not. Thus there are two distinct forms of confirmation <b>bias</b> <b>that</b> are under study with respect to astrological belief.|$|E
