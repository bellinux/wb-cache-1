50|$|The {{fuselage}} {{was flat}} sided and essentially rectangular, {{though there was}} decking to fair in the open cockpit, which had a small windshield, and a dorsal fairing to merge {{the rear of the}} pedestal to the tail. Under the cockpit, where the fuselage was deepest, there was a typical glider landing skid. Its conventional undercarriage had two <b>balloon</b> <b>tyre</b> mainwheels, each mounted on V-form split axles attached to the skid and with a shock absorbing strut fixed to the lower longeron. At the rear there was a tailskid. Both tail surfaces were straight tapered and straight cropped. Both rear control surfaces were much larger in area than their fixed counterparts and balanced; the rudder extended to the keel and operated in an elevator cut-out as the tailplane was mounted on the fin just above the fuselage, braced from above and below.|$|E
40|$|The major papilla of Vater {{is usually}} {{located in the}} second portion of the duodenum, to the {{posterior}} medial wall. Sometimes {{the mouth of the}} biliary duct is located in other areas. Drainage of the common bile duct into the pylorus is extremely rare. A 73 -year old man, with a history of duodenal ulcer, was admitted to hospital with the diagnosis of cholangitis. Dilatation of the extrahepatic biliary duct was observed by abdominal ultrasonography, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was performed. No area suggesting the presence of the papilla of Vater was found within the second duodenal portion. Finally the major papilla was located in the theoretical pyloric duct. Cholangiography was performed and choledocholithiasis was found in the biliary tree. The patient underwent dilatation of the papilla with a <b>balloon</b> <b>tyre</b> and removal of a 7 mm stone using a Dormia basket, which solved the problem without further complications. This anomaly increased the difficulty of performing therapeutic interventions during ERCP. This alteration in anatomy may increase the risk of complications during papillotomy, with a theoretically higher risk of perforation. Dilatation using a balloon was the chosen therapeutic technique both in our case and in the literature, due to its low rate of complications...|$|E

50|$|In the 1970s they {{produced}} the offroad motorbike Moto Zodiaco Tuareg. With large <b>balloon</b> <b>tyres</b> {{it was intended}} as a dune buggy.|$|R
50|$|The Moineau had a fixed, wide track, {{tailskid}} undercarriage, with large, {{low pressure}} <b>balloon</b> <b>tyres</b> on half-axles formed {{on each side}} by three struts, a forward pair from the lower and mid-fuselage and a drag strut to the lower fuselage further aft.|$|R
50|$|However, the RSW {{lacked the}} Moulton's suspension, which {{compensated}} for the bumpy ride that comes with small wheels. Instead, Raleigh fitted the RSW with <b>balloon</b> <b>tyres,</b> which effectively smoothed the ride but {{at the cost of}} increased rolling resistance. Nevertheless, the RSW was pleasant to ride, and Raleigh's extensive retail network ensured its success.|$|R
50|$|The Botali's {{landing gear}} was simple: {{on each side}} a wheel was mounted on the apex of three steel tubes, two from the lower {{longeron}} and a third to the nose framework about halfway up the fuselage. Dunlop <b>balloon</b> <b>tyres</b> provided shock absorbing deflections of more than 100 mm. {{there was a long}} steel spring tailskid.|$|R
50|$|It has a six speed gearbox {{and chain}} drive, <b>balloon</b> <b>tyres,</b> a dry mass of 117 kg and a seat height of 770 mm. The 'retro' styled VanVan is classed as a dual purpose bike, capable of {{cruising}} {{urban and suburban}} streets at 60 mph or riding on sandy or rough trails. It is not designed for heavy mud trails.|$|R
5000|$|In 1929, Scammell {{designed}} and manufactured the [...] "100 Tonner" [...] low loader. Only two were produced; {{the first was}} delivered to Marston Road Services, Liverpool, for the transportation of steam engines to Liverpool docks. Scammell were also looking for new markets, and diversified into four- and six-wheel rigid (nonarticulated) designs. The 'Rigid Six-wheeler' found some success and, with its <b>balloon</b> <b>tyres,</b> at last permitted sustained high-speed, long-distance road operation.|$|R
5000|$|The Nuffield Guppy {{was a small}} {{military}} vehicle {{designed by}} Sir Alec Issigonis while {{he worked for the}} Nuffield Organisation in the early 1940s. [...] The vehicle was designed to be parachute-droppable and was intended to assist paratroops to transport loads up to 500 lb at walking speeds and to be amphibious. The vehicle resembled the DUKW but was only about 8 ft long. It had large <b>balloon</b> <b>tyres</b> and an outboard motor at the rear. It was capable of carrying one person with equipment - or being used as a kind of motorized wheelbarrow by someone walking alongside the vehicle.|$|R
25|$|The E-34 had a {{rectangular}} cross-section fuselage formed from steel tubing with internal wire bracing. Its cockpits were open. The undercarriage used {{a pair of}} internally sprung mainwheels with <b>balloon</b> <b>tyres</b> and a tailskid. A split axle was mounted on a short V-strut below the fuselage. On the prototype, the undercarriage main legs were short, mounted on the lower fuselage longerons and assisted by short forward struts. The second prototype and production aircraft had longer legs fixed to the upper longerons. The prototype and production series aircraft were powered, as {{the rules of the}} competition required, by a 105hp (78kW) Walter Junior four-cylinder inverted inline engine, although the second prototype was fitted with the more powerful 130hp (97kW) de Havilland Gipsy Major of the same configuration.|$|R
5000|$|The Raleigh Bomber was {{a bicycle}} {{aimed at the}} boys/youth market which first {{appeared}} in 1981. Visually it resembled the Californian [...] "clunker" [...] bikes which were a homemade genre dating from the 1970s, primarily for use on the now legendary Repack downhill course. The Bomber had wide <b>balloon</b> <b>tyres,</b> a low slung frame and a sprung saddle with wide [...] "cowhorn" [...] style handlebars. Transmission was a choice between a single speed or 3 speed Sturmey Archer gears. Later, a Super Bomber was introduced {{in addition to the}} standard models. The Bomber was a highly unusual bicycle for its time, as it featured 559mm wheels with wide tyres, virtually unheard of in the UK until they became standard equipment on the ATB or mountain bikes which swept Britain a few years later.|$|R
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} was {{in three}} sections. Behind the engine compartment {{there was a}} simple duraluminum section containing the open, tandem cockpits, the forward one being below mid-chord. The rear fuselage was a fabric covered tube steel structure, with the wood and fabric in-flight adjustable strut braced tailplane mounted on top. The fin, of similar construction, [...] was broad and round edged, carrying the rudder which extended between the elevators to the fuselage bottom. Production machines had a new, triangular fin. The undercarriage was fixed and wide track (2.60m or 8ft6in), with near vertical main legs mounted on the forward lift struts. The tops of the legs were further braced to the upper fuselage. [...] Split axles were fixed at the bottoms of the forward lift struts; single wheels were fitted with <b>balloon</b> <b>tyres</b> and had differential brakes for ground steering. [...] The first prototype had a steerable tailskid, replaced by a tailwheel in later aircraft.|$|R
2500|$|The Vampyr had a {{fuselage}} with {{a simple}} rectangular cross-section but that of the Greif was more refined, with an elliptical section, though both were rather similar in profile. Both fuselages were completely ply skinned over wooden bulkheads and stringers. [...] The Greif's wing was mounted closer to the fuselage than on its predecessor, with the consequence that a cut-out {{had to be made}} in the leading edge for the pilot's head. This turned out to have deleterious aerodynamic effects. [...] Its undercarriage consisted of a pair of semi-recessed wheels with <b>balloon</b> <b>tyres</b> on the centreline, one under the nose and the other larger one under the wing spar. [...] The tail surfaces of the Greif were very similar to those of the Vampyr; a rectangular all-moving tailplane was hinged at the extreme rear of the fuselage with the rudder hinged at the same point. The fin was broad as required by the short fuselage; fin and rudder had straight vertical edges and a straight, rising top. The bottom of the rudder was parallel with its top, leaving room the tailplane movement.|$|R
5000|$|This {{proposal}} {{intended to}} combine {{a number of}} innovative transport options into one trip (hence 'Experience'), while still cutting the travelling time to the Sound by about one hour each way (previous hopes of longer savings seem unlikely to be realised). In Queenstown travellers would have boarded 25-m catamarans capable of carrying up to 240 people. These would cross Lake Wakatipu to the south-western shore, 20 km away. There, passengers would travel up the mountain on an existing back-country road, using specially constructed all-terrain coaches on <b>balloon</b> <b>tyres</b> (to reduce impact on the road). Arriving at the Kiwi Burn swing bridge terminal, tourists will continue on a mechanical (as opposed to maglev) monorail travelling 35 minutes through high country and native bush for a distance of 41 km, {{which would be the}} longest monorail connection in the world, before joining up with a bus park and ride facility on the existing road to Milford Sound north of Te Anau. Three passing loops along the line would allow four trains to run, at speeds of up to 90 km/h. Kiwi Burns Saddle, the highest point of the journey, is 675 m above sea level, and the higher-altitude section of the rail would be heated to prevent snow-buildup in winter. Each monorail train would seat 160 passengers, consisting of 16 articulated 2.6 m wide sections totalling 66 m in length. Only one train would be constructed initially. The proposal, which would cost up to NZ$132 million, would have to achieve around 220,000 two-way passengers per year to be viable. Compared to the Milford Dart project, the backers, Infinity Investment Group, believed that they would have an easier time achieving consents, as the proposal does not touch upon any National Parks, and the construction and operation process was considered to be very ecologically sustainable, {{such as the use of}} comparatively small piles for the monorail which will be bored and placed from a working vehicle moving forward on the rail being constructed, thus making construction roads unnecessary. Originally it was hoped that the consent process would start in mid 2007, with commercial operations beginning in 2011. That, however, did not happen. In October 2013 it was reported that the New Zealand Conservation Minister was supportive of the project." [...] On 29 May 2014, the Conservation Minister Nick Smith rejected the proposal saying the $240 million plan [...] "does not stack up either economically or environmentally." ...|$|R
40|$|An {{increase}} in pressure inside most small arteries unexpectedly results in a vasoconstriction. This phenomenon, known as the Bayliss effect, involves the stretch-induced activation of non-selective cation channels in the vascular smooth muscle cells. Recent work by Mederos y Schnitzler et al. now demonstrates that the stretch-induced channel activity originates from a fascinating interplay between a TRP cation channel and the angiotensin receptor. Intuitively, we all appreciate that increasing the intracellular pressure in an elastic container (e. g. a <b>balloon</b> or the <b>tyre</b> of your bicycle) leads to expansion of that container. However, many blood vessels, in particular small resistance arteries, behave oppositely: increasing intraluminal blood pressure makes them constrict instead of dilate (Figure 1 A). This pressure-induced myogenic vasoconstriction is generally known as the Bayliss effect, after th...|$|R
