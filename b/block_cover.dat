It looks as {{a bridge between the}} Majabat al Kondra and Aouker sand seas. It is made of two landscapes. The northern slope, with sandstones on the foreground, keeps some patches of an ancient ferrugineous Cuirasse. The southern one, a true (Cretaceous ?) cuesta is evoluting with alternate erosive systems. Moisty systems give diatomile-lakes against the lower slopes of the cuestas and arid systems - like the today one, along the slopes glacis with <b>block</b> <b>cover.</b> Torrential forms are of the same kind than these of non tropical mountains.

40|$|Fluctuation of climatic {{events in}} Central Europe with oceanic and {{continental}} influences intensified during the Pleistocene, especially above the timberline, enabled {{the analysis of}} this record on the ridge and slopes of the Ztracené kameny massif (1245 m a. s. l.), Czech Republic. Seismic refraction tomography (SRT) and electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) are geophysical methods that, that allow the comprehensive recognition of shallow geological structures in a strongly folded area of the High Jesenik Mountains. Geophysical surveys were performed to determine structure and thickness of the quartzite blockfield and its boundary with consolidated rock. The measured resistivity values were compared with the seismic wave velocities. The resistivity values of the <b>block</b> <b>cover</b> show significant differences according to its morphology, slope orientation and altitude. The data analysis indicates an occurrence of remnants of Pleistocene permafrost. The subnival traces within the blockfield demonstrate the intensity of past slope processes {{and the role of}} frost weathering even during the Holocene...|$|E
40|$|Synthesis of {{dimethyl}} carbonate (DMC) from CO 2 and methanol under milder reaction conditions was performed using reduced cerium oxide catalysts and reduced copper-promoted Ce oxide catalysts. Although {{the conversion of}} methanol was low (0. 005 – 0. 11 %) for 2 h of reaction, DMC was synthesized as low as 353 K and at total pressure of as low as 1. 3 MPa using reduced Cu–CeO 2 catalyst (0. 5 wt% of Cu). The apparent activation energy was 120 kJ mol– 1 and the DMC synthesis rates were proportional to the partial pressure of CO 2. An optimum amount of Cu addition to CeO 2 was 0. 1 wt% for DMC synthesis under the conditions at 393 K and total pressure of 1. 3 MPa for 2 h (conversion of methanol: 0. 15 %) due to the compromise of two effects of Cu: the activation of H 2 during reduction prior to the kinetic tests and the <b>block</b> (<b>cover)</b> of the surface active site. The reduction effects in H 2 were monitored through the reduction of Ce 4 + sites to Ce 3 + based on the shoulder peak intensity at 5727 eV in the Ce L 3 -edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES). The Ce 3 + content was 10 % for reduced CeO 2 catalyst whereas it increased to 15 % for reduced Cu–CeO 2 catalyst (0. 5 wt% of Cu). Moreover, the content of reduced Ce 3 + sites (10 %) associated with the surface O vacancy (defect sites) decreased to 5 % under CO 2 at 290 K for reduced Cu–CeO 2 catalyst (0. 1 wt% of Cu). The adsorption step of CO 2 on the defect sites might be the key step in DMC synthesis and thus the DMC synthesis rate dependence on the partial pressure of CO 2 was proportional. Subsequent H atom subtraction steps from methanol at the neighboring surface Lewis base sites should combine two methoxy species to the adsorbed CO 2 to form DMC, water, and restore the surface O vacancy...|$|E

40|$|The {{exit from}} nuclear and fossil-fuel energy sources quires {{alternative}} energy sources to be tapped. Concentrating solar power (CSP) {{has proven to be}} an e�cient source of renewable power. In order to operate solar power plants, it is necessary to understand its e�ciency and energy yield in detail. If the direct normal irradiance (DNI) is only known for one or a few points in the solar �eld, errors can occur in the plant simulation and the plant control. The solar collectors, that provide the heat to the power <b>block,</b> <b>cover</b> approximately one square kilometer for 50 megawatt electrical turbine power. In this area, high variations of DNI can occur. For example, in parabolic trough fields four sub fields have their individual heat transfer fluid (HTF) flow control. Hence, the power plant control requires further information about inhomogeneous irradiance. In consideration of the fact, that the power plant operator wants to maximize the profit he needs to know, how the power plant will perform within the next 0 - 15 minutes. Forecasting in this range is called "nowcasting". For nowcasting applications it is beneficial to create irradiance maps with cameras, that observe the sky, to document the current irradiance for every coordinate of the observed area, since the operator is able to preact to short term di�erences in the DNI, which lower the power plant's energy outcome. There is a shadow camera system at Plataforma Solar de Almer��a (PSA), which is used to validate the nowcasting system. The system detects the cloud's shadows on the ground. It was extended from two to six cameras, that enable a 360 � view around the installed tower power plant. Besides, the camera calibration was applied and older results were improved, so that an area of four square kilometers is evaluated. The cameras are recording series of two exposure times in 15 seconds intervals to ensure a high temporal resolution. There is also a sensor grid on the ground, measuring the global horizontal irradiance (GHI) and DNI. Its measured irradiance data was implemented to the shadow camera system. By using the shadow camera's sensor information, a relation between image information and incident irradiance was build. Therefore, it is possible to determine irradiance values for shaded regions, that are just de�ned by their image information. Plain view images (orthogonal images) are created for the evaluated area. By analyzing three time stamps, it is possible to detect shadow information. The shadow's structure is described by applying global thresholds. Also, the pixel difference is build between a shadowless and the investigated time stamp. Ultimately, these differences are used to define a DNI difference and generate irradiance maps for the evaluated area. Those resulting irradiance maps can be generated for each time stamp, if camera and irradiance data is given. It was possible to evaluate an entire day. The method's results are evaluated and its accuracy is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Authors: Noel Derecki, James Cronk & Jonathan Kipnis ### Abstract Here, we {{describe}} {{a method for}} determining phagocytic function of microglia isolated from mouse brains. ### Procedure To determine the phagocytic ability of microglial cells, we prefer to use apoptotic neural cells as targets, since they should most closely approximate natural microglial targets in vivo. 1. Dissociate neural progenitor cells in 0. 1 M PBS + 2 mg/ml papain (Worthington) at 37 º C for 30 m. - Treat dissociated neural progenitor cells (NPC) with UV light for 15 - 20 minutes; NOTE: this {{should be done in}} a thin plastic petri dish; thick plastic (eg. 15 or 50 ml conical tube) will block a significant portion of UV light, leading to suboptimal apoptosis. - Wash NPC in 50 ml conical tube with 40 ml PBS (RT), spin at 1200 RPM, 7 m, RT, low brake. Decant supernatant. - Resuspend NPC in 5 ml RT 0. 1 M PBS - Add 5 ul sta 5 (6) -TAMRA, SE (Invitrogen) to NPC, vortex immediately and let incubate at 37 º C in dark for 15 m. - Wash 3 X (as in Step 3) with 40 ml ice-cold 0. 1 M PBS. - Resuspend in 1 ml DMEM/F 12 (Invitrogen) + Anti-anti (Invitrogen); count cells using a hemacytometer. Dilute or concentrate to 5 X 10 e 6 per ml. - Feed onto microglial cells (previously allowed to adhere to glass cover slips in 24 -well plates) in 900 ul DMEM/F 12 + 10 % fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals) + Anti-anti at a ratio of 10 NPC: 1 microglial cell. NOTE: We typically perform experiments using 5 X 10 e 4 microglia per coverslip such that cells are spaced sufficiently to allow later quantification, thus 5 X 10 e 5 NPC would be fed on in 100 ul DMEM/F 12 + Anti-anti. - Place cells in incubator, at 37 º and 5 % CO 2 - At desired timepoints (eg. one, two and five h) remove plates from incubator - In a sterile hood, remove cover slips with forceps, dip 20 X briskly in warm 0. 1 M PBS (to remove non-phagocytosed NPC), then place cover slips in 1 ml 4 % PFA in a 24 -well plate. Replace remaining cover slips in incubator until next desired time-point. - Fix cells on cover slips in dark for 20 m. Wash 3 X with 0. 1 M PBS, at RT. - <b>Block</b> <b>cover</b> slips in 10 % serum in PBS containing 0. 3 % Triton X- 100 and 0. 5 % BSA, 1 h, RT in dark. - Incubate with anti-CD 11 b (eBioscience), 1 : 100) for 1 h at RT, in dark. - Wash cover slips 3 X with 0. 1 M PBS, RT. - Incubate with desired secondary antibody (1 : 1000, Invitrogen) for 1 hour at RT. - Wash cover slips 1 X with 0. 1 M PBS, RT. - Incubate in DAPI (1 : 20, 000) 5 m. - Wash cover slips 3 X with 0. 1 M PBS, RT. - Mount cover slips with Aqua-Mount (Lerner Laboratories) on slides. Let dry O/N before imaging. - Typically, a “phagocytic index” can be calculated by dividing the total area of microglial cells (CD 11 b+) by the total area of labeled NPC. Alternatively, number of phagocytosed targets/cell may be used to quantify phagocytosis. - To check validity of phagocytosed (internal) vs. adhered targets, Z-stacks may be imaged on confocal microscope. ### Timing - NPC dissociation, 30 m - NPC labeling, 45 m - Incubations, variable (1 + h) - Immunohistochemistry, 3 h ### Troubleshooting - Problem: Little or no phagocytosis observed - Solution 1 : NPC were not adequately irradiated; use stronger UV source, extend irradiation time, confirm cell death by dye or antibody-based assay (eg. annexinV, PI). - Solution 2 : Insufficient incubation time; extend incubation. ### Anticipated Results Microglia are highly phagocytic cells. Even after a short period of time, high levels of phagocytosis may be seen, as in Figure 1. ### Figures **Figure 1 : Microglial Phagocytosis** ![Fig 1]([URL] "Fig 1 ") *At left is shown a representative Z-stack indicating that UV-irradiated TAMRA-labeled NPC (red) have been phagocytosed and are situated inside of microglia. Immunolabeling for CD 11 b is shown in green and nuclei are indicated by DAPI (blue) *. *At right are shown representative images of microglia immunolabeled with CD 11 b (green) after having phagocytosed UV-irradiated TAMRA-labeled NPC (red) for 2 h*. ### Associated Publications **Wild-type microglia arrest pathology in a mouse model of Rett syndrome**.
