In <b>berry,</b> <b>F</b> 3 ′ 5 ′H gene expression has a functional impact on anthocyanin biosynthesis that persists during fruit ripening, and among red grape varieties, expansion and sub-functionalization of F 3 ′ 5 ′Hs have increased the complexity and diversification of the fruit color phenotype (Falginella et al. 2010). As well, in the grapevine lineage, higher levels of F 3 ′ 5 ′Hs transcription in dark blue cultivars than light red cultivars, even in green-peel cultivars, F 3 ′ 5 ′H transcripts are completely absent (Mattivi et al. 2006; Pomar et al. 2005).

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this paper}} is to give a {{complete}} picture of approximability for two tree consensus problems which are of particular interest in computational biology: Maximum Agreement SubTree (MAST) and Maximum Compatible Tree (MCT). Both problems take as input a label set and a collection of trees whose leaf sets are each bijectively labeled with the label set. Define the size of a tree as the number of its leaves. The well-known MAST problem consists of finding a maximum-sized tree that is topologically embedded in each input tree, under label-preserving embeddings. Its variant MCT is less stringent, as it allows the input trees to be arbitrarily refined. Our results are as follows. We show that MCT is -hard to approximate within bound n 1 − on rooted trees, where n denotes the size of each input tree; the same approximation lower bound was already known for MAST [J. Jansson, Consensus algorithms for trees and strings, Ph. D. Thesis, Lund University, 2003]. Furthermore, we prove that MCT on two rooted trees is not approximable within bound 2 log 1 −n, unless all problems in are solvable in quasi-polynomial time; the same result was previously established for MAST on three rooted trees [J. Hein, T. Jiang, L. Wang, K. Zhang, On the complexity of comparing evolutionary trees, Discrete Applied Mathematics 71 (1 - 3) (1996) 153 - 169] (note that MAST on two trees is solvable in polynomial time [M. A. Steel, T. J. Warnow, Kaikoura tree theorems: Computing the maximum agreement subtree, Information Processing Letters 48 (2) (1993) 77 - 82]). Let CMAST, resp. CMCT, denote the complement version of MAST, resp. MCT: CMAST, resp. CMCT, consists of finding a tree that is a feasible solution of MAST, resp. MCT, and whose leaf label set excludes a smallest subset of the input labels. The approximation threshold for CMAST, resp. CMCT, on rooted trees is shown to be the same as the approximation threshold for CMAST, resp. CMCT, on unrooted trees; it was already known that both CMAST and CMCT are approximable within ratio three on rooted and unrooted trees [V. <b>Berry,</b> <b>F.</b> Nicolas, Maximum agreement and compatible supertrees, in: S. C. Sahinalp, S. Muthukrishnan, U. Dogrusoz (Eds.), Proceedings of the 15 th Annual Symposium on Combinatorial Pattern Matching, CPM' 04, in: LNCS, vol. 3109, Springer-Verlag, 2004, pp. 205 - 219; G.

Vazirani (Eds.), Proceedings of the 5 th International Workshop on Approximation Algorithms for Combinatorial Optimization, APPROX' 02, in: LNCS, vol. 2462, Springer-Verlag, 2002, pp. 122 - 134]. The latter results are completed by showing that CMAST is -hard on three rooted trees and that CMCT is -hard on two rooted trees...|$|E

40|$|Orthogonal term rewrite {{systems do}} not {{currently}} have any semantics other than syntactically-based ones such as term models and event structures. For a functional language which combines lambda calculus with term rewriting, a semantics is most easily given by translating the rewrite rules into lambda calculus and then using well-understood semantics for the lambda calculus. We therefore study {{in this paper}} the question of which classes of TRS do or do not have such translations. We demonstrate by construction that forward branching orthogonal term rewrite systems are translatable into the lambda calculus. The translation satis es some strong properties concerning preservation of equality and of some inequalities. We prove that the forward branching systems are exactly the systems permitting such a translation which is, in a precise sense, uniform in the right-hand sides. Connections are drawn between translatability, sequentiality and separability properties. Simple syntactic proofs are given of the nontranslatability of a class of TRSs, including <b>Berry's</b> <b>F</b> and several variants of it...|$|R

Parts of the facade, such as cast-iron columns, which went over the property line were removed, and the building deteriorated, with rust, water damage and sagging floors. In 1925, plans were filed to rebuild the structure as an ordinary loft building of brick and stone, but were never carried out, although the ground-level storefronts were modernized in 1946. The building's future was decided when it was purchased in 1980 by Richard <b>Berry</b> and <b>F.</b> Anthony Zunino and converted into co-operative apartments after a cosmetic cleanup of the exterior, which won a commendation from the Friends of Cast Iron Architecture.
