For instance, new construction added approximately 137,000 square meters (1.5 million square feet) daily of usable floor space to satisfy demands for residential, commercial and factory space. More than 1,300 people move into the city daily, bolstering the economy <b>by</b> <b>approximately</b> 100 million Yuan.|$|E
5|$|Consistent {{condom use}} {{reduces the risk}} of HIV {{transmission}} <b>by</b> <b>approximately</b> 80% over the long term. When condoms are used consistently by a couple in which one person is infected, the rate of HIV infection is less than 1% per year. There is some evidence to suggest that female condoms may provide an equivalent level of protection. Application of a vaginal gel containing tenofovir (a reverse transcriptase inhibitor) immediately before sex seems to reduce infection rates <b>by</b> <b>approximately</b> 40% among African women. By contrast, use of the spermicide nonoxynol-9 may increase the risk of transmission due to its tendency to cause vaginal and rectal irritation.|$|E
