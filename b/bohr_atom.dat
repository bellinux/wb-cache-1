40|$|In {{the paper}} Phys. Lett. B 614 (2005) 140 - 142, F. Nasseri {{shows that the}} values of the fine {{structure}} constant reduces due to the presence of a cosmic string. In this comment I {{want to point out that}} this conclusion is not completely correct in the sense that the result obtained is valid only in a very special situation. In a recent paper F. Nasseri [1] analysed the <b>Bohr’s</b> <b>atom</b> in the cosmic string spacetime. The author claims that the fine structure constant in this system reduces by a factor of order 8. 736 × 10 − 17, consequently very small as the author says. In order to reach this conclusion the author considers separately two distinct forces acting on the electron: i) the induced electrostatic self-force on the electron due to the presence of a cosmic string [2, 3], and ii) the electrostatic one between the electron and the proton. So the total force will be given by the sum of these two forces. Although being not explicitly said, the author assumes that the proton is placed on the cosmic string considered as an ideal one. The point that I want to call attention is to the fact that the induced force on the electron, Eq. (11) of [1], is perpendicular to the cosmic string assumed along the z−axis. So the correct expression to it is: ⃗F = kπGµe 2 4 ρ 2 ˆρ. (1) ρ being the distance between the electron and the string.

40|$|Magnetic {{properties}} of cobalt clusters (20 N 200) were studied in molecular beams. The magnetization of cobalt clusters is studied at {{a broad range}} of temperatures, magnetic fields and clusters sizes. It is shown that the agnetization of ferromagnetic clusters in a cluster beam can be understood as an adiabatic process using the avoided crossing theory. Besides the ground state that bears magnetic moment of about 2 <b>Bohr</b> magneton per <b>atom,</b> an excited state that has 1 <b>Bohr</b> magneton per <b>atom</b> was discovered for every cobalt cluster observed. The energy separations between the two states was investigated by photo-ionization experiments. The ionization threshold shows that the energy gap between the two states is on the order of 0. 1 eV for small clusters (N 100) and vanishes for larger clusters. Experiments also show that the polarizability of the excited state is lower than that of the ground state, which indicates a significant electronic tructure difference between the two states. Two states are also found for iron clusters (20 N 200) for which the magnetic moments per atom are about 3 Bohr magneton for the ground state and 1 Bohr magneton for the excited states. This explains the fractional magnetic moments as well as the local magnetic order observed above the Curie temperatures for iron group ferromagnets. Further experiments show two states for manganese clusters for which the ground state has magnetic moment of 1 <b>Bohr</b> magneton per <b>atom</b> in about the same size range. This suggests that the two states are a universal phenomenon of 3 d transition metal clusters, which originate from the interaction between 3 d and 4 s electrons. Ph. D.

Bezerra de Mello’s comment [2], the conclusions presented in [1] about the fine structure constant in the spacetime of a cosmic string are not completely correct in the sence that the results presented in [1] are valid only in a special situation. As explained in [2], the conclusions presented in [1] are correct if we assume as ideal not only the proton is placed on the cosmic string but also the electron and the proton are in the plane orthogonal to the cosmic string lying along the z-axis. The purpose of this Reply is to correct calcultions presented in [1] in accordance with the observation made in [2] and also to present the correct value of the fine structure constant in the spacetime of a cosmic string. As pointed out in [2], our approach is correct only if we consider the proton and the electron placed in a plane perpendicular to the cosmic string which lies along the z-axis, with the proton on the cosmic string. It should be emphasized that the mistake concerning the value of the fine structure constant is due to the fact that we have used two different unit systems which we corrected in this Reply.

40|$|A recent {{rethinking}} {{of the early}} history of Quantum Mechanics deemed the late 1920 s agreement on the equivalence of Matrix Mechanics and Wave Mechanics, prompted by Schrödinger’s 1926 proof, a myth. Schrödinger supposedly failed to achieve the goal of proving isomorphism of the mathematical structures of the two theories, while only later developments in the early 1930 s, especially the work of mathematician John von Neumman (1932) provided sound proof of equivalence. The alleged agreement about the Copenhagen Interpretation, predicated to a large extent on this equivalence, was deemed a myth as well. If such analysis is correct, it provides considerable evidence that, in its critical moments, the foundations of scientific practice might not live up to the minimal standards of rigor, as such standards are established in the practice of logic, mathematics, and mathematical physics, thereby prompting one to question the rationality of the practice of physics. In response, I argue that Schrödinger’s proof concerned primarily a domain-specific ontological equivalence, rather than the isomorphism. It stemmed initially from the agreement of the eigenvalues of Wave Mechanics and energy-states of Bohr’s Model that was discovered and published by Schrödinger in his First and Second Communications of 1926. Schrödinger demonstrated in this proof that the laws of motion arrived at by the method of Matrix Mechanics could be derived successfully from eigenfunctions as well (while he only outlined the reversed derivation of eigenfunctions from Matrix Mechanics, which was necessary for the proof of isomorphism of the two theories). This result was intended to demonstrate the domain-specific ontological equivalence of Matrix Mechanics and Wave Mechanics, with respect to the domain of <b>Bohr’s</b> <b>atom.</b> And although the full-fledged mathematico-logical equivalence of the theories did not seem {{out of the reach of}} existing theories and methods, Schrödinger never intended to fully explore such a possibility in his proof paper. In a further development of Quantum Mechanics, Bohr’s complementarity and Copenhagen Interpretation captured a more substantial convergence of the subsequently revised (in light of the experimental results) Wave and Matrix Mechanics. I argue that both the equivalence and Copenhagen Interpretation can be deemed myths if one predicates the philosophical and historical analysis on a narrow model of physical theory which disregards its historical context, and focuses exclusively on its formal aspects and the exploration of the logical models supposedly implicit in it...|$|R
