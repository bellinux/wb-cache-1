50|$|A {{balanced}} circuit is circuitry {{for use with}} a <b>balanced</b> <b>line</b> or the <b>balanced</b> <b>line</b> itself. <b>Balanced</b> <b>lines</b> are a common method of transmitting many types of electrical communication signals between two points on two wires. In a <b>balanced</b> <b>line</b> the two signal lines are of a matched impedance to help ensure that interference induced in the line is common-mode and can be removed at the receiving end by circuitry with good common-mode rejection. To maintain the balance, circuit blocks which interface to the line, or are connected in the line, must also be balanced.|$|R

50|$|Sequent's first {{computer}} systems were the Balance 8000 (released in 1984) and Balance 21000 (released in 1986). Both models {{were based on}} 10 MHz National Semiconductor NS32032 processors, each with a small write-through cache connected to a common memory to form a shared memory system. The Balance 8000 supported up to 6 dual-processor boards for a total maximum of 12 processors. The Balance 21000 supported up to 15 dual-processor boards for a total maximum of 30 processors. The model number 21000 came from a simple calculation of the relative performance of the NS32032 (0.7MIPS) times 30 processors: 21 MIPS. Originally, Balance systems were equipped with a SCSI cartridge tape drive, Multibus for the hard drives and 6250 bpi reel tape device and Ethernet for networking. Later, {{with the introduction of}} the Balance 21000, faster Storage Module Device disks replaced the old Multibus drives. The SMD-based disk controller was called ZDC, because it was designed by a fellow by the name of Zeke. Thus, ZDC stood for Zeke's Disk Controller. In a small company such as Sequent, it was not unusual for one person to be primarily (if not solely) responsible for major component designs. The systems ran a modified version of 4.2BSD Unix the company called DYNIX, for DYNamic unIX. The machines were designed to compete with the DEC VAX-11/780, with all of their inexpensive processors available to run any process. In addition the system included a series of libraries that could be used by programmers to develop applications that could use more than one processor at a time. The Balance systems were originally intended to be sold to OEMs as computing engines, (initial super workstation designs did not support shared memory according to Ron Parsons), but that market could not be developed. When the commercial market discovered their reliability, scalable performance and cost advantages, the company re-thought its marketing strategy. The <b>Balance</b> <b>line</b> sold well for three years to banks, the aerospace industry, the government, other commercial enterprises, and universities interested in parallel computing.|$|E
40|$|Lecturepg. 88 The {{majority}} of horizontally split multistage pumps were designed when packing {{was the only}} cost effective method of sealing the pumpage from atmosphere. As a result, even modern pumps employ a stuffing box pressure equalization line (<b>balance</b> <b>line)</b> to lower stuffing box pressures. This technique of pressure equalization has a major drawback: reduced pump efficiency. The work that is done on the fluid that is throttled back to suction through the <b>balance</b> <b>line</b> is lost and acts to reduce the useful work done by the pump. While this was an acceptable compromise in the 1950 s, {{it is now a}} true waste of very expensive electrical power. The modern solution to this problem is to eliminate the <b>balance</b> <b>line</b> and apply a correctly specified mechanical seal to the high pressure side of the pump. This paper serves to show that, with careful consideration of the effects of <b>balance</b> <b>line</b> removal, pump life can be maintained and efficiency gained...|$|E

The volume of landslide deposits is a key parameter for landslide studies and disaster relief.

To improve existing models, the mechanisms and laws governing the material deposited by landslides are studied and then the mass balance principle and mass <b>balance</b> <b>line</b> are defined. Based on these ideas, a novel and improved model (Mass Balance Model, MBM) is proposed. By using a parameter called the “height adaptor”, MBM translates the volume calculation into an automatic search for the mass <b>balance</b> <b>line</b> within the scope of the landslide. Due to the use of mass balance constraints and the height adaptor, MBM is much more effective and reliable.

50|$|In {{telecommunications}} and professional audio, a <b>balanced</b> <b>line</b> or <b>balanced</b> signal pair is a transmission line {{consisting of two}} conductors of the same type, each of which have equal impedances along their lengths and equal impedances to ground and to other circuits. The chief advantage of the <b>balanced</b> <b>line</b> format is good rejection of external noise when fed to a differential amplifier. Common forms of <b>balanced</b> <b>line</b> are twin-lead, used for radio frequency signals and twisted pair, used for lower frequencies. They are to be contrasted to unbalanced lines, such as coaxial cable, {{which is designed to}} have its return conductor connected to ground, or circuits whose return conductor actually is ground.

5000|$|Most {{explanations}} of <b>balanced</b> <b>lines</b> assume symmetric (antiphase) signals {{but this is}} an unfortunate confusion—signal symmetry and <b>balanced</b> <b>lines</b> are quite independent of each other. Essential in a <b>balanced</b> <b>line</b> is matched impedances in the driver, line and receiver. These conditions ensure that external noise affects each leg of the differential line equally and thus appears as a common mode signal that is removed by the receiver. There are balanced drive circuits that have excellent common-mode impedance matching between [...] "legs" [...] but do not provide symmetric signals. [...] Symmetric differential signals exist to prevent interference to other circuits - the electromagnetic fields are canceled out by the equal and opposite currents. But they are not necessary for interference rejection from other circuits.|$|R

40|$|Manifolded {{compressors}} {{are widely}} used in existing refrigeration systems such as cold rooms, display windows and ice machines. Scroll compressors are increasingly used in refrigeration systems, hence manifolded scroll compressors are easily found in the current market. The manifolding of two, three or even four compressors provides many benefits. It can provide capacity modulation; it can offer lower starting load of the system; it also enables the change of one compressor when it is tripped without shutting down the whole system. The key success factor of design of the manifold is to ensure the right balance of the oil between compressors in different running conditions. It is vital for the compressor to maintain the proper level and quantity of oil for its reliability. Two kinds of oil management solutions are predominant. One is the active solution which includes a mechanical or electronic oil level control device (oil level regulator) to control the oil feeding {{in order to maintain}} the oil level inside of the compressor crankcase. This solution is maturely used in the market. The other is the passive solution which relies on the piping design to achieve a good oil balance. The passive one is more interesting for its cost effectiveness and robustness due to fewer components, however, it is more difficult to handle. In this paper, three different passive oil management solutions for even tandem systems are studied. The first solution is that each compressor has its own respective oil separator; oil separated in the oil separator is returned back to the corresponding compressor crankcase, and the oil <b>balance</b> <b>line</b> is installed to avoid that one compressor oil level is much higher than the other if OS(oil separator) efficiency is different or any OS is blocked. The second solution consists of two compressors sharing one common oil separator; oil separated from the OS is fed back to the common suction line, and is then led back to each compressor with refrigerant gas. The oil return has to be split equally between the running compressors; the oil state could be as spray with the gas and as droplets along the length and bend of the piping. Since the oil is returning back together with the suction gas, gas balance is critical and gas velocity in the suction line is very important. Suction header and suction branch design is described in detail in the paper to ensure the gas balance and oil return. The oil <b>balance</b> <b>line</b> is installed between two compressors in order to balance the oil level. The third solution is that two compressors share one oil separator; oil is returned back to one compressor crankcase and then through the oil <b>balance</b> <b>line</b> to feed another compressor’s crankcase. All of the above three passive solutions are working but have their own advantages and disadvantages. Test results for each solution are shown in the paper. Also, the vibration analysis and the tests are described to optimize the piping design for good acoustic result...|$|E
