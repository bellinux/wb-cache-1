Finally, we discuss the implication for design practice of using design thinking as a mode of interdisciplinary interaction and cocreation of problem-solving approaches between designers and others (rather than an activity just for designers) which represents a step beyond conventional participatory design approaches...|$|R

40|$|Information {{problems}} {{involved in}} trading differentiated goods are a priori acuter than {{those associated with}} trading more homogeneous products. The impact of export promotion activities intending to address these problems can be therefore expected to differ across goods with different degree of differentiation. Empirical evidence on this respect is virtually inexistent. This paper aims at filling this {{gap in the literature}} by providing estimates of the effect of these activities over firms trading different goods using highly disaggregated export data for the whole population of Costa Rican exporters over the period 2001 - 2006. We find that trade promotion actions favor an increase of exports along the extensive margin, in particular, in terms of destination countries, in the case of firms that are already selling differentiated goods. However, these actions do not seem to encourage exporter to start exporting these goods. Further, no significant impacts are observed for firms exporting reference-priced and homogeneous goods.

40|$|Three factors {{define the}} main {{difficulties}} faced by developing countries {{in the area of}} trade facilitation: (i) limited understanding and use by governments and business (especially SMEs) of trade facilitation and of ICT tools and techniques; (ii) developing countries' limited capacity for policy analysis and inadequate policy instruments for the implementation of trade facilitation, and (iii) inadequate policy coordination for negotiation on trade facilitation. These obstacles tend to reduce countries' development opportunities and to increase the costs of general economic development and social welfare. The United Nations, through its five regional commissions, is launching a project that seeks to disseminate the benefits of trade facilitation and the standards, tools and requirements for its successful implementation. The project will focus on trade facilitation promoted by: (a) enhanced knowledge and understanding of governments and <b>business</b> regarding trade <b>facilitation</b> and the role of ICT; (b) enhanced use of ICT by SMEs in trade facilitation, and (c) national capacity-building for trade facilitation negotiations...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{potential}} contribution of both trade and <b>business</b> <b>facilitation</b> measures to trade and export competitiveness, {{as well as}} the potential gains from adopting a more integrated and coherent approach to trade and business (investment) facilitation. The analysis confirms that measures aimed at reducing the behind and at-the-border cost of exporting, such as reduction in customs and port fees and charges and improvement in transport infrastructure and logistics services can be expected to {{have a significant impact on}} trade. However, it also reveals that improving the domestic business (investment) environment may have an impact on export competitiveness of a magnitude similar to the trade and transport facilitation measures. The study also finds evidence that achieving similar performance levels across the range of trade and <b>business</b> <b>facilitation</b> areas, i. e., having a more integrated approach to trade and <b>business</b> <b>facilitation,</b> could significantly increase trade competitiveness. Overall, the study suggests that trade officials should actively develop cooperation and communication channels with other ministries and institutions in charge of different types of business regulations - in particular, those related to credit information and contract enforcement.

Consequently, this has led to a growing air transport system in the global economy. Airports, serving as the most important link of the transport system, through creating jobs and, indirectly, through <b>business</b> and tourism <b>facilitation,</b> influence a country's economic development, encourage foreign investment and contribute to the operating efficiency of other economic sectors. However, the growing demand for air transport is fueled by growing competition not only between airlines, but also between airports themselves.

40|$|The {{stabilization}} and association process {{launched by the}} European Union {{in the aftermath of}} the Kosovo war in 1999 has created a new policy environment for five South East European countries (SEE- 5). In exchange for EU assistance, the prospect of EU accession, and the continuation of preferential access to EU markets, SEE- 5 governments have to upgrade their institutions and governance by European standards and engage in mutual regional cooperation, including stability pact member-countries. The authors examine the benefits to SEE- 5 of trade liberalization along two dimensions and suggest conditions under which these could be maximized. They argue that the process of regional trade liberalization should be extended to multilateral liberalization, aligning SEE- 5 most-favored-nation (MFN) applied tariffs on industrial products with EU MFN tariffs, and that priority be given to structural reforms and regional cooperation aimed at trade facilitation. As inter-industry trade rather than intra-industry trade dominates intra-SEE- 5 trade, the potential for expansion in intra-SEE- 5 trade is limited at least within the confines of the existing production structures and transportation infrastructure. Therefore SEE- 5 free trade agreements are unlikely to contribute to economic growth without concurrent efforts to improve infrastructure, trade <b>facilitation,</b> <b>business,</b> and investment climate, as well as to increase competition from MFN imports to external preferential suppliers through multilateral liberalization.

40|$|A {{doctoral}} programme {{has been}} described by some researchers as a time when they experience a ‘kaleidoscope pattern of thoughts and feelings typical of intellectual inquiry activities’, therefore, rendering it a deeply challenging endeavour in all ramifications. Furthermore, {{it has been argued that}} doctoral programs should prepare students for a ‘lifetime of intellectual inquiry that manifests itself in creative learning and research’. However, there is a dearth of studies about how doctoral students facilitate their CIS-R process. The main intention of this paper is to draw attention to the way the ability to create artwork influences doctoral student’s creative information seeking-research (CIS-R) process. The paper focuses on CIS-R processes, doctoral student’s individual learning needs, and behavioural patterns in this regard. In the context of four key themes – information seeking processes, creativity process, doctoral studies, and individual learning, an in-depth literature review which focuses on the four key themes was carried out. This was done in order to determine and understand the core elements of the doctoral student’s individual learning during their research program. The empirical investigation was undertaken at a Business School in the UK. A small group of doctoral business students (management and marketing) that had used their artwork as an intervention strategy to combat the negative experiences encountered during their CIS-R process were specifically selected. Scenarios from their research experience were recorded and analysed. The findings suggest that artistic ability plays a key role in the doctoral <b>business</b> student’s <b>facilitation</b> of their personal CIS-R process. Furthermore, the investigation revealed that facilitation of the process involves three main stages: Unblocking (or Deconditioning), Critical Thinking, and Risk Taking, which are governed by several individual learning fields: Knowledge, Understanding, Wisdom, Attitude, Skills, Emotions, and Perceived Self-efficacy or Faith, and together form the KUWASEP reflective learning framework. Therefore, it is possible to conclude that these learning fields form the divine connection between CIS-R and artistic ability. This being the case, such a framework could be a useful reflection tool for facilitating the CIS-R process of doctoral business students. Research Limitations: A small sample of students was selected, which although not deliberate, consisted of female students. Furthermore, broad generalisations cannot be made. Although the study focuses on artistic ability, this does not suggest that it is the only intervention factor. Finally, the investigation was confined to a small sample of students at a UK Business School...|$|R
