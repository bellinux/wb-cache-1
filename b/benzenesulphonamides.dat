40|$|The {{kinetics}} of oxidation of six p-substituted diphenylcarbinols (Y-DPC, where Y = H, Cl, Br, NO 2, CH 3 and OCH 3) by sodium-N-bromo-benzenesulphonamide or bromamine-B (BAB) in {{the presence}} of HCl and catalyzed by RuCl 3 in 30 % vol. methanol medium has been studied at 35 degrees C. The experimental rate law is, rate = -d[BAB]/dt = k'[BAB](0) [DPC](0) [RuCl 3](x) [H+](y), where x and y are fractions. Addition of reaction product, <b>benzenesulphonamide</b> (ArNH 2) retards the reaction. An increase in the dielectric constant of the medium decreases the rate. Rate studies in D 2 O medium showed that the solvent isotope effect k'(H 2 O) /k'(D 2 O) = 0. 55. Proton inventory studies have been carried out in H 2 O-D 2 O mixtures. The rates correlate satisfactorily with Hammett sigma relationship and plot is biphasic. The reaction constant rho is - 2. 33 for electron releasing substituents and - 0. 36 for electron withdrawing groups at 35 degrees C. The activation parameters Delta H*, Delta S*, Delta G* and 1 g A are calculated. Delta H* and Delta S* are linearly related and an isokinetic relationship is observed with beta = 329 K indicating enthalpy as a controlling factor...|$|R
