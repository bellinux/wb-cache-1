5|$|Rugby union team Glasgow Hawks RFC {{predominantly}} play at Old Anniesland, <b>but</b> <b>occasionally</b> play at New Anniesland.|$|E
5|$|Barkley {{played the}} power forward position, <b>but</b> <b>occasionally</b> played small forward and center. He {{was known for}} his unusual build as a {{basketball}} player, stockier than most small forwards, yet shorter than most power forwards he faced. However, Barkley was still capable of outplaying both taller and quicker opponents because of his unusual combination of strength and agility.|$|E
5|$|Caribbean {{monk seals}} {{were found in}} warm temperate, {{subtropical}} and tropical waters of the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and the west Atlantic Ocean. They probably preferred to haul out at sites (low sandy beaches above high tide) on isolated and secluded atolls and islands, <b>but</b> <b>occasionally</b> would visit the mainland coasts and deeper waters offshore. This species may have fed in shallow lagoons and reefs.|$|E
50|$|Tahanea is uninhabited, <b>but</b> visited <b>occasionally</b> by islanders from {{neighboring}} atolls.|$|R
50|$|Coates {{performed}} {{primarily as}} a pianist, <b>but</b> also <b>occasionally</b> played vibraphone and clarinet.|$|R
60|$|ERNEST (humbly). Not often; <b>but</b> just <b>occasionally</b> {{there would}} be your adoring husband.|$|R
5|$|Leaves : Simple, entire (smooth and even), linear, oval to {{filiform}} (thread-like), {{mostly with}} parallel veins, <b>but</b> <b>occasionally</b> net-veined. They are alternate (single and alternating direction) and spiral, {{but may be}} whorled (three or more attached at one node, e.g. Lilium, Fritillaria), cauline (arranged along the aerial stem) or sheathed in a basal rosette. They are rarely petiolate (stem attached before apex), and lack stipules. The aerial stem is unbranched.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1877, Trial by Jury {{was often}} given at benefit performances, usually for an actor or actress {{who had fallen}} on hard times, <b>but</b> <b>occasionally</b> for other causes. These were {{glittering}} affairs, with various celebrities appearing in principal roles {{or as part of}} the chorus. Gilbert himself played the silent role of the Associate on at least four occasions.|$|E
5|$|The {{black mamba}} is {{primarily}} terrestrial, <b>but</b> <b>occasionally</b> arboreal, especially where {{it occurs in}} forest. Typically it inhabits neglected areas of scrub, termite mounds, abandoned burrows and rock crevices. It is adapted to terrain ranging from savannah and woodland to rocky slopes and dense forests. The black mamba prefers moderately dry environments such as light woodland and scrub, rocky outcrops, and semi-arid dry savannah, to dense forest or arid desert.|$|E
50|$|Dwarf {{sperm whales}} are usually solitary, <b>but</b> have <b>occasionally</b> {{been seen in}} small pods.|$|R
5000|$|Dan Lewis - anchor (1987-2014; retired, <b>but</b> returns <b>occasionally</b> {{for special}} {{projects}} for KOMO-TV) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{males are}} diurnal, flying during the day, <b>but</b> are <b>occasionally</b> {{attracted}} to light.|$|R
5|$|The {{links between}} castles and the {{surrounding}} lands and estates was particularly important during this period. Many castles, both royal and baronial, had deer parks or chases attached to them {{for the purposes of}} hunting. These usually stretched away from the village or borough associated with the castle, <b>but</b> <b>occasionally</b> a castle was placed in the centre of a park, such as at Sandal.|$|E
5|$|In {{general the}} summers are warm-hot with {{rainfall}} erratic <b>but</b> <b>occasionally</b> heavy while in winter {{it is very}} mild with rainfall more or less uniform. There is a gradual transition from summer to winter conditions and vice versa. Winds are frequent and salt-laden being moderate easterlies {{in the summer and}} fresh to strong westerlies in the winter. July is the windiest month, and the winter months are subject to frequent gales and strong winds. The island has 67.8 clear days, annually.|$|E
5|$|In {{ordinary}} circumstances, transduction, conjugation, {{and transformation}} involve transfer of DNA between individual bacteria {{of the same}} species, <b>but</b> <b>occasionally</b> transfer may occur between individuals of different bacterial species and this may have significant consequences, such as the transfer of antibiotic resistance. In such cases, gene acquisition from other bacteria or the environment is called horizontal gene transfer and may be common under natural conditions. Gene transfer is particularly important in antibiotic resistance as it allows the rapid transfer of resistance genes between different pathogens.|$|E
50|$|It {{is seldom}} {{available}} through nurseries <b>but</b> is <b>occasionally</b> available from Oratia Native Plant Nursery.|$|R
5000|$|Victims of joke theft {{have little}} legal recourse, <b>but</b> have <b>occasionally</b> exacted their own vengeance.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is mostly}} an inland species <b>but</b> is <b>occasionally</b> seen in coastal areas, such as estuaries.|$|R
5|$|Large {{amounts of}} {{radioactive}} lanthanum were dispersed by the explosions; 254 tests were performed between 1944 and 1961. In 1948 two workers received radiation burns there. The experiments were generally performed {{when the wind}} blew to the north, <b>but</b> <b>occasionally</b> the wind would change direction in the early morning. In 1949 and 1950 the nuclear fallout from the tests was blown over parts of the housing area and a road; the radiation levels on the road occasionally reached 5-10mR/h and the road had to be closed for a while.|$|E
5|$|Leading {{up to the}} invasion, the RAF {{intensified}} {{its operations}} against German submarines and ships operating near France. Coastal Command aircraft destroyed six submarines within eleven days during May; Australian aircrew contributed to three of these sinkings. Bomber Command also expanded its program of laying naval mines from April, and No.460 Squadron as well as Australians posted to RAF light and heavy bomber units took part in several minelaying operations in the Baltic Sea and Heligoland Bight. Coastal Command's anti-shipping force, which included the RAAF's No.455 Squadron, mainly undertook training exercises from April, <b>but</b> <b>occasionally</b> attacked German convoys in the English Channel.|$|E
5|$|Murray cod {{are white}} to cream on their ventral (belly) surfaces. Their backs and flanks are usually yellowish-green to green, overlain with heavy darker green, <b>but</b> <b>occasionally</b> brown or black, mottling. The {{effect is a}} marbled {{appearance}} sometimes reminiscent of a leopard's markings. Colouration is related to water clarity; colouration is intense in fish from clear water habitats. Small to medium-sized Murray cod from clear-water habitats often have striking and very distinct colouration. Very large fish tend towards a speckled grey-green colouration.|$|E
500|$|Yellow-winged Darter {{is listed}} as a vagrant, <b>but</b> is <b>occasionally</b> subject to large influxes e.g. in 1995.|$|R
50|$|The group disbanded after 1975, <b>but</b> Humphrey <b>occasionally</b> {{revived the}} name for festival {{performances}} and other appearances.|$|R

5|$|The Magyars buried their dead, {{laying the}} {{deceased}} {{on their backs}} with the arms resting along their bodies or upon their pelvises. A deceased warrior's tomb always contained material connected with his horse. These are most frequently its skin, skull, and the lower legs; these were put into its master's grave, <b>but</b> <b>occasionally</b> only the harness was buried together with the warrior, or the horse's skin was stuffed with hay. The Magyars rolled the corpses in textiles or mats and placed silver plates on the eyes and the mouth.|$|E
5|$|The corn crake winters {{mainly in}} Africa, from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and central Tanzania south to eastern South Africa. North of this area, it is mainly seen on migration, <b>but</b> <b>occasionally</b> winters in North Africa {{and to the}} west and north of its core area in {{southeast}} Africa. Most of the South African population of about 2,000 birds occurs in KwaZulu-Natal and the former Transvaal Province, and numbers elsewhere in Africa are uncertain. There are several nineteenth-century records, when populations were much higher than now, of birds being seen in western Europe, mainly Britain and Ireland, between December and February.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} is white when fresh, but becomes more cream-coloured when dry. The smooth spores are oval to ellipsoid, hyaline (translucent), non-amyloid (meaning {{they do not}} absorb iodine from Melzer's reagent), and {{typically}} measure 6.5–7.5 by 4.5–5.5μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are thin-walled, hyaline, and lack clamp connections at their bases. They are usually four-spored <b>but</b> <b>occasionally</b> two-spored, with sterigmata (projections that attach to the spores) up to 4μm long. The cheilocystidia (cystidia that occur {{on the edge of}} a gill) are mostly club-shaped, thin-walled, hyaline, and measure 15–30 by 6–10μm.|$|E
50|$|Commands a {{price premium}} as a table grape, <b>but</b> also <b>occasionally</b> {{used to produce}} rosé single varietal wine.|$|R
5000|$|Brown was {{the nephew}} of wrestler [...] "Bulldog" [...] Bob Brown, <b>but</b> was <b>occasionally</b> billed as his son.|$|R

5|$|The {{spotted eagle}} ray (Aetobatus narinari) is a {{cartilaginous}} fish of the eagle ray family, Myliobatidae. As traditionally recognized, it is found globally in tropical regions, including the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. Recent authorities have restricted it to the Atlantic (including the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico) with other populations recognized as the ocellated eagle ray (A. ocellatus) and Pacific white-{{spotted eagle ray}} (A. laticeps). Spotted eagle rays are most commonly seen alone, <b>but</b> <b>occasionally</b> swim in groups. They are ovoviviparous, the female retaining the eggs then releasing the young as miniature versions of the parent.|$|E
5|$|Æthelred usually {{acted with}} the {{permission}} of or in association with King Alfred, <b>but</b> <b>occasionally</b> he acted independently of him. Although sometimes described as plain dux or ealdorman, his status was clearly quite different from that of other duces, for he is also accorded styles which aspire to divine grace and which appear to verge on the royal. In other words, there is no mistaking that the Mercians retained a conception of their ruler as a rightful successor to earlier kings, and a conception of their land as a kingdom with its own identity; but there is also no mistaking that Æthelred moved in an Alfredian world.|$|E
5|$|A {{catalytic}} triad {{refers to}} the three amino acid residues that function together at {{the centre of the}} active site of some hydrolase and transferase enzymes (e.g. proteases, amidases, esterases, acylases, lipases and β-lactamases). An Acid-Base-Nucleophile triad is a common motif for generating a nucleophilic residue for covalent catalysis. The residues form a charge-relay network to polarise and activate the nucleophile, which attacks the substrate, forming a covalent intermediate which is then hydrolysed to regenerate free enzyme and release the product. The nucleophile is most commonly a serine or cysteine amino acid, <b>but</b> <b>occasionally</b> threonine. Because enzymes fold into complex three-dimensional structures, the residues of a catalytic triad can be far from each other along the amino-acid sequence (primary structure), however, they are brought close together in the final fold.|$|E
50|$|The {{publication}} contained mostly satire and humorous stories, <b>but</b> also <b>occasionally</b> exposed misdeeds {{of prominent}} citizens, especially Arkansas politicians.|$|R
50|$|This plant {{grows in}} a conical shape, and {{typically}} achieves 2-10 metres in height, <b>but</b> may <b>occasionally</b> exceed this.|$|R
50|$|These damselflies {{are most}} {{typically}} found alongside lakes and ponds, <b>but</b> are <b>occasionally</b> found next to slow-moving streams, too.|$|R
