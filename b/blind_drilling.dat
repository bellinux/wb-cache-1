The propeller assembly of a turboprop engine is a highly energetic rotating assembly [...] that a catastrophic, single point failure in a propeller blade can cause catastrophic loss of aircraft is cause to question its structural integrity. To provide a useful fatigue life, the critical blade retention region is cold rolled to introduce residual compressive stresses in {{the surface of the}} appropriate magnitude and depth. <b>Blind</b> hole <b>drilling</b> has been employed for process verification, but this technique is qualitative in nature and is typically unsuitable for structures with stress gradients, such as those resulting from rolling. This tendency obviates the effectiveness of <b>blind</b> hole <b>drilling</b> as a quality control tool. In fact, there have been military and civil mishaps caused by premature blade failures attributed to inadequate rolling.

40|$|Longwall mining has {{historically}} been considered an application for only deep reserves. This {{has changed in the}} recent past as longwall has become competitive with surface mining. Many resources marked for stripping now lie in the domain of longwall. Today, the best longwall mines compete with strip mines operating in even the lowest stripping ratios. Longwall mining has become more widely applicable than it ever {{has been in the past}} and it is now generally considered the method of choice in situations where high levels of coal production are required. But the best way to use longwall mining has become less certain with the opportunities that highwall access provides. Wall-to-wall mining is the use of retreating longwall developed from and retreating toward a highwall. As a surface mine reaches its ultimate highwall, the opportunity for longwall punch mining or wall-to-wall mining is obvious. There are several clear operating advantages to operating a longwall in this way and where highwalls are available, the best economic decision will generally favor planning a direct approach. Yet wall-to-wall is not applicable in every situation even when highwalls are available. Moreover, the advantages of wall-to-wall mining do not always justify the cost of trenching or box cuts to access coal. However, many tactical advantages of operating from the highwall can be realized with the use of specially equipped <b>blind</b> <b>drilled</b> or raised bored shafts. This paper discusses novel techniques for a shaft assisted mining system which permits the addition of conveyor structure and mine systems from the surface to the face for advance and retreat mining with longwall, shortwall or room and pillar panels...|$|R

A series of finite element simulations and corresponding experiments are performed to demonstrate the technique. Thermocouple measurements are performed to verify the transient thermal analyses and <b>blind</b> hole <b>drilling</b> measurements to verify the predicted residual stresses.

40|$|One of {{the most}} common methods of {{experimentally}} determining residual stresses is <b>Blind</b> Hole <b>Drilling</b> (BHD). A new method which is a thermo-optical analog to BHD is being developed. This method uses local heating to anneal a tiny spot and uses laser speckle interferometry to measure the strain that results. This strain is used to determine the state of stress prior to heating. The peak temperatures are on the order of 200 Celsius so that for most metals, there will be no changes in phase or other material properties except for a slight reduction in yield stress. Preliminary experiments with type 304 stainless steel were performed using resistance heating. The experimental results were in excellent agreement with finite element model predictions of the process. Subsequently, the resistance heating was replaced with laser heating. The heat input (22. 5 Watt peak) from a small sealed radio frequency excited Carbon Dioxide laser was used. In order to both control the heating temperature and efficiently couple the infrared photons from the laser into the test specimen, a substance known as Liquid Temperature Indicating Paint was used. Without this substance the laser power would be so large as to make this approach impractical. Furthermore the measurement and control for the heat input would be very complicated. Using this laser heating approach was successful in obtaining similar results to those obtained in other work. Since this laser based technique is a thermo-optical analog to <b>blind</b> hole <b>drilling</b> a simple stress model is required to interpret the measured results. This simple stress model is presented. As in BHD, the simple model must be modified by empirical coefficients to be useful. These empirical coefficients are determined by experimentation and/or numerical analysi...|$|R
40|$|Abrasion of a {{metallic}} surface to improve bonding during strain gage installation is generally thought to produce negligible {{effect on the}} measurement of applied or residual stresses by <b>blind</b> hole <b>drilling.</b> However, residual stresses induced by surface abrasion may affect residual stress measurements in shallow subsurface layers of residual stress fields produced by processes such as grinding and shot peening. The residual stress and cold work distributions produced by four methods of abrasive surface preparation and etching were studied by x-ray diffraction in fully annealed AISI 1018 steel. Abrasion of the surface was found to alter the residual stresses near the sample surface. The surface residual stresses produced by abrasion ranged from tension to compression with magnitudes as high as 80 % of the yield strength. Cold work was induced to depths of 20 to 60 µm.

50|$|The biggest {{disadvantage}} of core drill or annular cutter {{is that it}} can not <b>drill</b> <b>blind</b> holes. A core drill due to its hollow geometry can only make through holes.

The cost of a core drill is high compared to twist drill, but the cost per hole made with core drill is less as compared to twist drills, this is because a single core drill makes 5 to 10 times more holes than a twist drill.|$|R
40|$|When the <b>blind</b> hole <b>drilling</b> {{method is}} used to {{evaluate}} high residual stresses in a metallic component, plastic relaxed strain can be produced in the hole region because of the stress concentration that causes the local stresses to reach yielding. By assuming a linear-elastic behaviour of the material, a significant error can result. The present paper analyses {{the phenomenon of the}} plasticity locally induced by the introduction of the hole and proposes a procedure to take into account its effects on the residual stress evaluation. The correcting procedure has been developed by elaborating a large database of elastic-plastic finite element analyses performed considering a wide range of material properties and testing parameters, including all the strain gauge rosettes commonly used. As plasticity induces non-linearity in the relationship between residual stress and relaxed strain, the superposition principle cannot be applied, so the correction is limited to uniform in-depth residual stress fields. However, four hole depths were considered and the related correcting procedures were provided. When variable through thickness residual stress is expected, and high residual stress is confined near the surface region, the correction procedure can be applied to an initial limited depth...|$|R

The {{goal was to}} measure the influence of drill bit geometry on maximum thrust forces required for drilling, and compare this relative to the known influence of feed rate and bone composition. <b>Blind</b> holes were <b>drilled</b> perpendicular to the iliac crest up to 10 mm depth in cadaveric pelvic bones of 20 pigs (adolescent) and 11 goats (full grown) with eight substantially different drill bits of empty set 3 - 3. 2 mm. Subsequently, boreholes were drilled perpendicular to the ilium with the same drill bits at three different feed rates (0. 58 mm/s, 0. 83 mm/s, 1. 08 mm/s). The mean maximum thrust force ranges from 10 to 110 N for cortical bone, and from 3 to 65 N for trabecular bone. The results show that both drill bit geometry and feed rate have a significant influence on the maximum thrust forces, with a dominant influence of drill bit geometry in terms of shape of the flutes, sharpness of cutting edges and value of point angle. The differences in thrust forces between cortical and trabecular bone are substantial for all measured conditions. The measured values {{can be used for}} drill design. (C) 2012 IPEM.

Application of the technology resulted in the development of important new exploration leads in the Frontier, Muddy, and Nugget formations. The new leads are adjacent to a major north-south trending fault, which is downdip from the crest of the major structure in the area. In a <b>blind</b> test, the <b>drilling</b> results from six new Muddy test wells were accurately predicted.

Such material is an attractive choice for many engineering applications, primarily due to its stiffness, hardness and wear resistance.

As an alternative fabrication route this project investigated the precision limits of machining such ceramics using high power, pulsed lasers operating in millisecond, and nanosecond regimes and at wavelengths of 1075 nm, 1064 nm, 532 nm and 10. 6 m. In order to establish the suitability of machined parts for biomedical implant, the use of a Raman Spectrometer was vital to establish the phases present in the final machined parts. The work focuses heavily on the use of Yttrium Oxide (Y 2 O 3) Partially Stabilized Zirconia (PSZ) as it is the prime material used in dental reconstructions to date however a comparison with Alumina is carried out. In depth investigation of the processing parameters used in millisecond Nd:YAG and nanosecond Nd:YVO 4 laser sources was conducted providing maximum material removal rates of 13 mm 3 /s and 2. 1 mm 3 /min respectively. Successful CO 2 laser processing was conducted on 8 mm thick samples however, when processing complex components, bulk failures were observed.

40|$|The {{construction}} industry generally takes a conservative attitude towards adopting innovations. Previous research {{has tended to}} focus on information technology instead of heavy construction equipment. Also, the ‘process’ of adopting of new construction technologies by companies remains unexplored until now. In the previous part of the research the initial stages of technology adoption were examined including identification of the range of options available and comparison of the options in order to determine and collect any information that is missing for any of the options. With this in mind, this paper presents the initial investigation into the next part (phase) of the technology adoption process, which is found to involve analysis of the most viable options, involving a demonstration of the technology on the user’s site and / or discussion with other technology users, and the making of the final decision.

40|$|Abstract - When surgically <b>drilling</b> <b>blind</b> {{holes in}} bone using a Water Jet (WJ), {{control over the}} {{resulting}} depth is a challenging issue of paramount concern. This thesis {{was part of a}} project aimed at replacing the awl and mallet technique used in traditional microfracture procedures with an arthroscopic high-pressure WJ instrument is capable of accurately drilling 2 – 4 mm deep holes in subchondral bone. The focus of this paper was to develop, analyze and evaluate concepts for ensuring the depthwise accuracy of a microfracturing WJ. Research was performed on both WJ systems and the microfracture procedure, and a thorough problem analysis detailing all concerning requirements and parameters was set up. It was determined that due to the strong non-uniformity of human bone, both spatially and between subjects, a WJ capable of monitoring the depth and implementing a closed-loop control system was needed to ensure safe and accurate drilling. To measure the depth of the hole and allow for feedback control, a flexible Nickel Titanium probe concept was devised and tested. The concept featured a 3 D printed nozzle with built-in WJ orifice and depth probe, which could be extended down the hole made by the WJ by an ex-vivo actuator featurimg load and displacement sensors. When the load sensor detected a sudden rise in extension resistance, bottom contact was assumed and the hole depth was calculated based on the displacement of the probe. A proof-of-concept experiment showed the viability of using a flexible probe to measure the depth. Additionally, the algorithm produced for calculating the depth was shown to be robust against the hysteresis and backlash exhibited by the setup. When probing holes with depths of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 mm and bore diameters of 1, 1. 5, and 2 mm drilled in solid PMMA, the prototype managed an error mean of 0. 00 mm with a SD of 0. 19 mm. To test the probe in holes shaped as expected during microfracture surgery, a virtual interference experiment was carried out using mCT scans of WJ-drilled bones and simulated probes of varying diameters. Seven scans were probed from 4 different angles each; the results suggested that a probe with a 0. 2 – 0. 3 mm diameter was optimal in terms of traversing the hole without blockages and without risking over-penetration. Moreover, this thesis produced recommendations on carrying the project further, towards a fully integrated system capable of <b>drilling</b> accurate <b>blind</b> holes in human bone, in a closed-loop depth-controlled manner.

40|$|Spines of {{sea urchins}} are {{appendages}} {{that are associated}} with defense, locomotion, and food gathering. Spines are repaired when damaged, and the dynamics of repair was studied in the slate-pencil sea urchin Heterocentrotus mammillatus to provide insights not only into the processes of healing. but also into the normal growth of spines and the formation of growth lines. Regeneration of spines on tubercles following complete removal of a spine was slow and depended upon the size of the original spine. The maximum amount of regeneration occurred on tubercles with spines of intermediate size (1. 6 g), which, on average, developed regenerated spines weighing 0. 1, 0. 3, and 0. 7 g after 4, 8, and 12 months, respectively. Some large tubercles, which had original spines weighing over 3 g, failed to develop a new spine even after 8 - 12 months. Regeneration of a new tip on a cut stump was more rapid than production of a new spine on a tubercle. Regeneration to original size was more rapid for small spines than for large spines, but large stumps produced more calcite per unit time. In 4 months, a small spine with a removed tip weighing 0. 15 g regenerated a new tip weighing 0. 09 g, or 63 % of its original weight. In the same time, a large spine with 2. 35 g of tip removed regenerated 0. 40 g of new tip, or 17 % of the original weight. Holes were drilled in spines to serve as bench marks to document the production of new growth lines in response to damage. <b>Blind</b> holes <b>drilled</b> in spines caused 65 % loss over 4 months, but holes drilled completely through spines caused only a 6 % loss. Cutting a spine near its base did not initiate shedding of the stump. Repair of holes drilled in spines showed that major repair originated from the spine surface, and regeneration into the hole was over obtuse angles. For a slanting hole through a spine, filling of the hole carne from the distal edge for the distal opening and from the proximal edge for the proximal opening. Spines were tagged with tetracycline, but of 46 spines examined 4 - 12 months following treatment, only 1 displayed evidence that the spine surface had been marked. This suggests that spines usually are not growing. Abrasion of spines either by wiping with a cloth or sanding with emery paper failed to induce growth lines to form. Of 57 abraded spines and 64 unabraded spines, only 2 in each treatment category developed new growth lines. Results show that some growth lines in spines develop from trauma, but these tend to be local and do not extend from the base to the tip. Spines of Heterocentrotus mammillatus usually are not growing but occasionally undergo a growth episode that produces a growth line that extends from the milled ring to the spine tip. Such an episode is not related to damage repair from abrasion or breakage and appears to be endogenous. The SPINES OF A SEA URCHIN are morphological parts that serve as the animal's first defense against assaults from the environment (e. g., Fricke 1974, Strathmann 1981), appendages for gathering and manipulating food (e. g., Ebert 1968, Leighton 1968), and braces for wedging into crevices (e. g., Regis and Thomassin 1982). Spines form an important part of an urchin's maintenance mechanisms (Ebert 1982), and it is no surprise to find that they are repaired rapidly once damaged (Ebert 1967, Heat field 1971, Mischor 1975). Spine sizes vary greatly across taxa. For example, in St rongylocentrotus purpuratus (Stimpson 1857), calcite of a large primary spine weighs only about 0. 03 g. In slate-pencil sea urchins of the genus Heterocentrotus, spines are substantially more massive. Calcite in a large H. mammillatus (Linneaus 1758) spine may weigh over 5 g, and calcite of a large primary spine of H. trigonarius (Lamarck 1816) may weigh over 11 g. Although spines from Strongylocentrotus purpuratus would be expected to be repaired rapidly (Ebert 1967, Heatfield 1971), it is less clear whether very large spines from Heterocentrotus species also would be repaired in just a few months or whether the benefits of large spines carry a potential burden of a long regeneration time. A second issue associated with damage repair focuses on growth lines in spines. In St rongylocentrotus purpuratus, lines form as a consequence of tip regeneration following breakage (Ebert 1967, Heatfield 1971), but growth lines in Heterocentrotus spp. have been interpreted as periodic (Dotan and Fishelson 1985, Weber 1969), an interpretation that has been disputed (Ebert 1985, 1987). The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present results of a 1 -year study on Heterocentrotus mammillatus (family Echinometridae), a species with massive spines. The focus is on the responses of spines to damage, spine repair and regeneration in response to trauma, and the formation of growth lines. Data are presented on (a) regeneration following total removal of spines; (b) repair rates of calcite on cut spine stubs; (c) responses of spines to small holes drilled into or through them; (d) responses of spines to abrasion; and (e) results of tagging spines with tetracycline...|$|R
