25|$|Laudrup went on {{to guide}} Real Madrid in a championship-winning season that would end the Barça stranglehold, making him the only player ever to win the Spanish league five {{times in a row}} playing for two {{different}} clubs. After the initial success at Real, a lacklustre season would <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>store</b> for the club. Despite only playing two seasons at Real Madrid, he was voted the 12th-best player in Real Madrid history in an internet survey by Spanish newspaper Marca when the club celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2002. While playing with Barcelona, he participated in the 5–0 victory over rivals Real Madrid in the 1993–94 season. The following season while playing for Real Madrid, he aided in the revenge beating Madrid gave Barça, the final score also ending 5–0.|$|E
500|$|Early on, I {{realized}} {{that what this}} particular crew needed from me was not pressure but the light touch. [...] Once informed of our objective, their enthusiasm infected everything they did, and here and there might easily have caused stress-related dysfunction. [...] Extended separation from home and family with no means of communications {{was not a problem}} — submariners are used to that — but bearing down too much on the job might be. [...] My concern was about our performance in an emergency, being at the same time unable to predict what emergencies might <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>store</b> for us. [...] It was important, I thought, to hold back on the pressure until a really tough problem came up. [...] This happened several times, as I knew it would, and I was glad I had something in reserve.|$|E
500|$|Alan Clayson {{writes of}} reviewers criticising [...] "Back Off Boogaloo" [...] for being repetitious, leading Starr {{to respond in}} a 1973 interview: [...] "Play me a pop song that isn't." [...] On release, Chris Welch wrote in Melody Maker: [...] "A Number One hit could easily <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>store</b> for the maestro of rock drums. There's {{a touch of the}} Marc Bolans in this highly playable rhythmic excursion... It's {{hypnotic}} and effective, ideal for jukeboxes and liable to send us all mad {{by the end of the}} week." [...] Woffinden described the single as [...] "every bit as ebullient" [...] as [...] "It Don't Come Easy", although [...] "slightly inferior", while Mike DeGagne of AllMusic views it as a song where [...] "he jovial spirit of Ringo Starr shines through". In a 1974 article for the NME, Charles Shaar Murray highlighted [...] "Back Off Boogaloo" [...] as a [...] "great radio and juke-box tune".|$|E

500|$|When {{predicting}} {{what would}} <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>store</b> for season four, Scott Bakula {{suggested that he}} would like to see the crew come to terms with the emotional scars of the mission they had against the Xindi in the third season. He wanted several questions to be covered, such as [...] "How do they come back into society, how do they re-adjust their behaviors? What has happened to them will always be inside of them, every time they're confronted with new situations." [...] Following the resolution of the mission in [...] "", he wanted the crew to receive [...] "a great reception" [...] on their return to Earth. He was pleased with how this was handled in the series, describing [...] "Home" [...] as [...] "a great episode". When actress Jolene Blalock revealed that her character would be getting married in [...] "Home", she joked that she wouldn't need to fight someone – a reference to the [...] episode [...] "Amok Time". Dominic Keating summed up the plot of the episode in an interview with Cult Times magazine, saying [...] "Our heroes find that their world has changed after the Xindi annihilation of Florida at the end of the second year." ...|$|E
2500|$|From Aylesbury {{she went}} on to Beaulieu, where the {{security}} training was capped with a practice mission – in the case of wireless operators, to find a place in a strange city from which they could transmit back to their instructors without being detected by an agent unknown to them who would be shadowing them. The ultimate exercise was the mock Gestapo interrogation, intended to give agents a taste of what might <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>store</b> for them if they were captured and some practice in maintaining their cover story. Noor’s escaping officer found her interrogation [...] "almost unbearable" [...] and reported that [...] "she seemed terrified… so overwhelmed she nearly lost her voice", and that afterwards [...] "she was trembling and quite blanched." [...] Her finishing report, which the official historian of F Section found in her personal file long after the war, read: [...] "Not overburdened with brains but has worked hard and shown keenness, apart from some dislike of the security side of the course. She has an unstable and temperamental personality and it is very doubtful whether she is really suited to work in the field." [...] Next to this comment Maurice Buckmaster, the head of F Section, had written in the margin [...] "Nonsense." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} stages of the war, Japanese {{authorities}} recruited prostitutes through conventional means. In urban areas, conventional advertising through middlemen was used alongside kidnapping. Middlemen advertised in newspapers circulating in Japan and the Japanese colonies of Korea, Taiwan, Manchukuo, and China. These sources soon dried up, especially from Japan.; The Ministry of Foreign Affairs resisted further issuance of travel visas for Japanese prostitutes, feeling it tarnished the image of the Japanese Empire.. The military turned to acquiring comfort women outside mainland Japan, mostly from Korea and occupied China. Many women were tricked or defrauded into joining the military brothels.;. The Japanese forced Hui Muslim girls in China to serve as sex slaves by setting up the [...] "Huimin Girls' school" [...] and enrolling Hui girls into the school for this purpose. The American historian Gerhard Weinberg wrote that a major issue that no historian has examined is whatever the soldiers of the Indian National Army [...] "...were permitted to share in the [...] "comfort" [...] provided by thousands of kidnapped Korean young women held as sex slaves by the Imperial Japanese Army at its camps. This might have provided them with some insight into the nature of Japanese, as opposed to British, colonial rule, as well what might <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>store</b> for their sisters and daughters." ...|$|E
