5|$|One {{suitable}} {{method for}} purification for the raw platinum, which contains platinum, gold, {{and the other}} platinum-group metals, is to process it with aqua regia, in which palladium, gold and platinum are dissolved, whereas osmium, iridium, ruthenium and rhodium stay unreacted. The gold is precipitated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> iron(II) chloride and after filtering off the gold, the platinum is precipitated as ammonium chloroplatinate <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> ammonium chloride. Ammonium chloroplatinate {{can be converted to}} platinum by heating. Unprecipitated hexachloroplatinate(IV) may be reduced with elemental zinc, and a similar method is suitable for small scale recovery of platinum from laboratory residues. Mining and refining platinum has environmental impacts.|$|E

Small {{amounts of}} minor {{alloying}} {{elements such as}} RE and Sr were added to Mg- 8 wt%Al- 5 wt%Zn (AZ 91 D+ 4 %Zn), and their effects on the microstructure, mechanical properties and corrosion resistance were investigated. The microstucture of the investigated alloys could be characterized by dendritic Mg, Mg 17 Al 12, a quasi-crystalline Zn-rich phase, and Al 4 RE (if RE is added).

Access on the west side was gained through a narrow round-headed entrance and a wider main doorway was incorporated in the south elevation.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemical}} {{behavior of}} ytterbium {{is similar to}} that of the rest of the lanthanides. Most ytterbium compounds are found in the +3 oxidation state, and its salts in this oxidation state are nearly colorless. Like europium, samarium, and thulium, the trihalides of ytterbium can be reduced to the dihalides by hydrogen, zinc dust, or <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> metallic ytterbium. The +2 oxidation state occurs only in solid compounds and reacts in some ways similarly to the alkaline earth metal compounds; for example, ytterbium(II) oxide (YbO) shows the same structure as calcium oxide (CaO).|$|E

5|$|The {{photostability}} of pigments can {{be enhanced}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> cerium. It provides pigments with light fastness and prevents clear polymers from darkening in sunlight. Television glass plates are subject to electron bombardment, which tends to darken them by creation of F-center color centers. This effect is suppressed by addition of cerium oxide. Cerium is also {{an essential component of}} phosphors used in TV screens and fluorescent lamps. Cerium sulfide forms a red pigment that stays stable up to 350°C. The pigment is a nontoxic alternative to cadmium sulfide pigments.|$|E
