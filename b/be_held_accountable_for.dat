5|$|Prime Minister Harper's apology {{excluded}} Newfoundland and Labrador as it {{was argued}} {{that the government should}} not <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>accountable</b> <b>for</b> pre-Confederation actions. Residential schools in Newfoundland and Labrador were located in St. Anthony, Cartwright, North West River, Nain and Makkovik. These schools were run by the International Grenfell Association and the German Monrovian Missionaries. The government argued that because these schools were not created {{under the auspices of the}} Indian Act, they were not true residential schools. More than 1000 survivors disagreed and filed a class action lawsuit against the government for compensation in 2007. By the time the suit was settled in 2016, almost a decade later, dozens of plaintiffs had died. It was expected that up to 900 former students would be compensated.|$|E
5|$|The trial {{ended with}} Lhermitte {{receiving}} the maximum sentence {{for the murder}} of her five children. The court and the jury did not take any extenuating circumstances into account. In her closing argument, Lhermitte said she would accept any punishment the court gave her and showed remorse for her actions. Earlier in the trial, psychiatrists had found that Lhermitte was not of sound mind when she committed the acts and should not <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>accountable</b> <b>for</b> her actions. They felt that she should be admitted into a psychiatric institution rather than going to prison, but the jury did not follow their opinions. Lhermitte had been battling with depression for many years. She concluded that she saw the murder of her children and committing suicide as her only way out.|$|E
5|$|With the {{accession}} of ElizabethI in November 1558, Robert Dudley {{came into}} great favour and was made Master of the Horse. Ambrose Dudley received {{the post of}} Master of the Ordnance, though he pressed his influential brother to delay the appointment somewhat, {{so that he could}} not <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>accountable</b> <b>for</b> his predecessor's embezzlement of funds. When their attainder had been lifted in 1558, the Dudley brothers had renounced any rights to their father's possessions or titles. Yet on 25 and 26December 1561 Ambrose Dudley was created Baron Lisle and Earl of Warwick, and the next year received {{a large portion of the}} lands confiscated from the Duke of Northumberland. Warwick Castlewhich the Queen visited on her 1572 summer progressbecame his seat, while the neighbouring Kenilworth Castle became that of Robert Dudley.

25|$|Various legal cases arose {{surrounding}} the dubbing of cassettes. In the UK, {{in the case}} of CBS Songs v. Amstrad (1988), the House of Lords found in favor of Amstrad that producing equipment that facilitated the dubbing of cassettes, in this case a high-speed twin cassette deck that allowed one cassette to be copied directly onto another, did not constitute the infringement of copyright. In a similar case, a shop owner who rented cassettes and sold blank tapes was not liable for copyright infringement even though it was clear that his customers likely were dubbing them at home.

25|$|In the mid-fourteenth century, {{there were}} {{restrictions}} placed on London surgeons {{as to what}} types of injuries {{they were able to}} treat and the types of medications that they could prescribe or use, because surgery was still looked at as an incredibly dangerous procedure that should only be used appropriately.
