Of the period from the 1930s to 1950s, {{when he was growing}} up, James Mosley would later write: The Monotype classics dominated the typographical landscape... in Britain, at any rate, they were so ubiquitous that, while their excellent quality was undeniable, it was possible to be bored by them and to begin to rebel against the bland good taste that they represented. In fact we were already aware by 1960 that they might not <b>be</b> <b>around</b> <b>to</b> bore us for too long. The death of metal type... seemed at last to be happening.|$|E

One scene that Schneider specifically remembers {{was at the end of}} season three's [...] "Forsaken". Here, Jonathan admits to not trusting his own instincts anymore and allowing Clark to rely on his. This [...] "admission of fallibility", but faith in his son's ability to make the right choices, is what Schneider sees as the growing of the family dynamic.|$|E
