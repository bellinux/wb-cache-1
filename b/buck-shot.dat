6000|$|... "Don't tell me that," [...] {{said the}} Captain; [...] "a Yankee will fight with muskets and <b>buck-shot,</b> rather than sit still with an affront. I should know Jonathan, I think." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I got {{a bullet}} scratch on the arm," [...] {{answered}} the captain. [...] "And Marny {{got a few}} <b>buck-shot</b> in his shoulder. But neither of the hurts amount to anything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They made {{a feeble}} attack {{this morning at}} four o'clock, but we were ready for them. They might have carried the {{barricade}} had we only had our rifles, but <b>buck-shot</b> {{was too much for}} them. Of course we brought down two with our rifles; but there must have been over a score of them, and the four barrels of <b>buck-shot</b> did heavy execution. Some of them fell, and I fancy most of the others got a dose of shot, as they were all in a close body. I will {{tell you all about it}} after we have had supper." ...|$|E
50|$|UTC {{used the}} shotgun from the Winchester Model 1912 for {{operation}} conducted and it use non-lethal ammunition, spreads and <b>buck-shots</b> supply {{to break down}} the door during conducted the raid. The submachine gun that timber used are consisted of Heckler & Koch MP5A2 and A3's versions.|$|R
6000|$|... "Here is my fowling-piece. It {{is already}} loaded with <b>buck-shot.</b> Bertie has taken down his rifle and gun, and {{will give you}} the latter as you pass. I suppose José will take no weapons?" ...|$|E
60|$|The jaguar {{fell over}} on one side, clawing the air, and then {{recovered}} himself. As {{he did so}} two charges of <b>buck-shot</b> struck him on the head, and he rolled over and remained motionless.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{the male}} ahead," [...] Dias whispered. [...] "Do {{you and your}} brother take aim. I will take the female, and José will hold his fire of <b>buck-shot</b> till she is within a length of us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They are {{beginning}} to get tired," [...] Godfrey said. [...] "We are going a good deal faster, of course, now we have got the wind astern, but I do not {{think they are going}} as fast as they did, and I expect that last dose of <b>buck-shot</b> took the heart out of them a good deal. They had reckoned that we should be only able to fire once or twice before they came up, and that I should use bullets; but that handful of <b>buck-shot</b> evidently peppered a good many of them, and they know if they come up they will have four more barrels at least among them. I think the fighting is all over now." ...|$|E
6000|$|Harry {{was at once}} on his feet. [...] "Use your rifle first, Bertie, and sling it {{over your}} {{shoulder}} before you give them the two barrels of <b>buck-shot,</b> {{so that you can}} start to run at once if we don't stop them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{might have}} been, ef you'd {{contracted}} {{to take the}} hull charge of two handfuls of <b>buck-shot</b> and slugs; but ez one eighth o' that amount would have done your business, and yet left enough to have gone round, promiskiss, and satisfied the other passengers, it wouldn't do to kalkilate upon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{have plenty}} of money, Dias, for I find two {{remittances}} from home awaiting me here. We have already bought two double-barrelled guns and a stock of ammunition, principally <b>buck-shot,</b> for we shall not be doing much big game shooting. We can always buy food at the sea-side villages." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, make up {{your mind}} soon. The old man 'll fill me with <b>buck-shot</b> if he catches sight o' me." [...] He drew her arm out of the window and laid his bearded cheek to it. [...] "Come, little one, we're made for each other; God knows it. Come! It's him 'r me." ...|$|E
60|$|Godfrey {{levelled}} his gun, {{which was}} charged with <b>buck-shot,</b> and fired both barrels. Terrific yells and howls followed, and the opening was clear in a moment, though Godfrey could see two or three dark figures on the snow. There was a sound of whimpering and snarling, and then of a fierce fight outside.|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll welcome it! give crack for crack! [...] Peril, old lad, is what I seek" [...] "O then, there's {{plenty to}} be had-- By all means on, and have our fill" [...] With that, grotesque, he writhed his neck, [...] Showing a scar by <b>buck-shot</b> made-- [...] Kind Mosby's Christmas gift, he said.|$|E
60|$|They then {{discussed}} the {{arrangements for the}} attack. Each was to carry a glowing brand, {{and when he got}} there, was to sling his gun behind him and hold twelve squibs in one hand and the brand in the other. When they approached within throwing distance of the savages, they were to lay their guns down beside them, and then Harry was to put the ends of his squibs against his brand, and hurl the whole of them among the Indians. A few seconds later Bertie was to do the same, while Harry fired one barrel of <b>buck-shot.</b> Bertie was to fire as Dias threw a dozen crackers, and then José was to throw his squibs. Then all were to throw squibs and crackers as far as they could go; and the other two barrels of <b>buck-shot</b> and José's musket were to be poured in. By this time they calculated the savages would be in full flight, and the three rifles could then be used.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have put}} in <b>buck-shot</b> this time, Luka; I don't want to kill any of the poor beggars, and the shot will spread. I {{have put in}} double charges so as {{to give them a}} good dose as they come up. Small shot would be of no use, it would not get through those thick leather coats of theirs. Now, then, let us send her along." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I don't {{think they}} will take them," [...] Harry said grimly, [...] "without paying pretty dearly for them. With your gun and our rifles, and that old fowling-piece which you got for José, which will throw a fairly heavy charge of <b>buck-shot,</b> I think {{we can make a}} very good fight against any band of eight men, or even one or two more." ...|$|E
60|$|Keeping {{close to}} the rock wall, they went along in single file until within forty or fifty yards of the fire; then, going down {{on their hands and}} knees, they crawled up a slight rise, from the top of which they could see a hundred or more natives {{gathered}} round a fire. One was addressing the others, who were seated listening attentively. Laying the guns down to be ready for instant action, and keeping themselves concealed in the herbage, Harry took his bundle of squibs from his pocket. They were but lightly tied together; slipping off the string he applied the ends to the brand. There was a sudden roar of fire, and waving them once round his head he hurled them into the midst of the assembly. There was a yell of astonishment as the missiles flew hither and thither, exploding with loud reports. The last had not exploded when Bertie's handful flew among them; then came the parcel from Dias, and at the same moment Harry poured a barrel of <b>buck-shot</b> among them, followed by a volley of crackers, while almost simultaneously Harry threw his squibs and Bertie fired a volley of <b>buck-shot.</b> For a moment the savages were paralysed, then many of them threw themselves on their faces in terror of these fiery demons, while others started in headlong flight.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{first is}} like a steel trap, and the last nimbler than a <b>buck-shot.</b> I wish it was hot noon, now, grand'ther; {{and that there was}} an acre or two of your white swans or of black {{feathered}} ducks going south, over our heads; you or Ellen, here, might set your heart on the finest in the flock, and my character against a horn of powder, that the bird would be hanging head downwards, in five minutes, and that too, with a single ball. I scorn a shot-gun! No man can say, he ever knew me carry one, a rod." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{went back}} to the embers of the fire, lighted the torches, and, {{returning}} to the barrier, threw them twenty or thirty yards up the ravine. There was a hoarse shout of anger, and then a dozen shots were fired. Bertie's rifle cracked out in return, and Harry's followed almost immediately. A dark group of some twenty or thirty men were rushing forward, and had just reached the line where the torches were burning, when four barrels of <b>buck-shot</b> were poured into them. Three or four fell, the rest fled at once, and the cries and oaths showed that many of them were wounded.|$|E
60|$|The {{infantry}} under General Taylor {{was armed}} with flint-lock muskets, and paper cartridges charged with powder, <b>buck-shot</b> and ball. At {{the distance of}} a few hundred yards a man might fire at you all day without your finding it out. The artillery was generally six-pounder brass guns throwing only solid shot; but General Taylor had with him three or four twelve-pounder howitzers throwing shell, besides his eighteen-pounders before spoken of, that had a long range. This made a powerful armament. The Mexicans were armed about as we were so far as their infantry was concerned, but their artillery only fired solid shot. We had greatly the advantage in this arm.|$|E
60|$|Talking {{occasionally}} in low tones, but keeping up a vigilant watch, they were altogether {{hidden from the}} view of anyone coming up the stream, for they exposed only their eyes {{and the top of}} their heads above the rough parapet. No attempt had been made to fill up the spaces between the stones, so that, except for the rounded shape, it would be next to impossible to make them out between the rough rocks of the crest. Harry had laid his double-barrelled gun on the parapet in front of him. He had loaded both barrels with <b>buck-shot,</b> feeling that in the darkness he was far more likely to do execution with that weapon than with a rifle.|$|E
60|$|Ere long, {{a horrible}} {{explosion}} was heard, drowning for the instant the cannonade. Two {{of the old}} eighteen-pounders--before spoken of, as having been hurriedly set up below the main deck of the Richard--burst all to pieces, killing the sailors who worked them, and shattering all {{that part of the}} hull, as if two exploded steam-boilers had shot out of its opposite sides. The effect was like the fall of the walls of a house. Little now upheld the great tower of Pisa but a few naked crow stanchions. Thenceforth, not a few balls from the Serapis must have passed straight through the Richard without grazing her. It was like firing <b>buck-shot</b> through the ribs of a skeleton.|$|E
6000|$|... "He will be careful, señor. He {{knows his}} own life will depend upon his {{crawling}} along as noiselessly as a snake. If he is seen, of course he will come at all speed back to me; and, unless he is hit by a chance arrow, he will not run much risk, for {{by the time they}} are ready to shoot he will be out of sight on such dark nights as these, and {{in the shade of the}} mountains and trees. I shall be ready to send four barrels of <b>buck-shot</b> among them when they come up. That is sure to stop them long enough to allow us to get under the cover of your rifles before they can overtake us.|$|E
6000|$|... "This," [...] said Ukridge, {{leaning against}} the door and endeavouring to button his collar at the back, [...] "reminds me of an {{afternoon}} in the Argentine. Two other cheery sportsmen and myself tried for three-quarters of {{an hour to get}} into an empty house where there looked as if there might be something to drink, and we'd just got the door open when the owner turned up from behind a tree with a shot-gun. It was a little difficult to explain. As a matter of fact, we never did what you might call really thresh the matter out thoroughly in all its aspects, and you'd be surprised what a devil of a time it takes to pick <b>buck-shot</b> out of a fellow. There was a dog, too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{intend to}} muffle the sweeps and row the {{schooner}} {{up to the}} head of the creek there, from which point we can command the pile of sandal-wood with our gun. Then I shall land with all the men except two, who shall take care of the schooner and be ready with the boat to take us off. We can creep through the woods {{to the head of}} the village, where these cannibals are always dancing round their suppers of human flesh; and if the carbines of the men are loaded with a heavy charge of <b>buck-shot,</b> we can drop forty or fifty at the first volley. After that the thing will be easy enough. The savages will take to the mountains in a body, and we shall take what we require, up anchor, and away." ...|$|E
6000|$|Harvey waked to {{find the}} [...] "first half" [...] at 'breakfast, the fo'c'sle door drawn to a crack, and {{every square inch of}} the {{schooner}} singing its own tune. The black bulk of the cook balanced behind the tiny galley over the glare of the stove, and the pots and pans in the pierced wooden board before it jarred and racketed to each plunge. Up and up the fo'c'sle climbed, yearning and surging and quivering, and then, with a clear, sickle-like swoop, came down into the seas. He could hear the flaring bows cut and squelch, and there was a pause ere the divided waters came down on the deck above, like a volley of <b>buck-shot.</b> Followed the woolly sound of the cable in the hawse-hole; a grunt and squeal of the windlass; a yaw, a punt, and a kick, and the [...] "We're Here" [...] gathered herself together to repeat the motions.|$|E
60|$|The {{work was}} hard, {{but they were}} now {{accustomed}} to it. They often had to go a considerable distance before they could find trees available for bridging the torrents, but, on the other hand, they sometimes came upon some of much smaller girth than those they had first tackled. The labour in getting these down was comparatively slight. Sometimes these stood a little way from the stream, but after they were felled two mules could easily drag them {{to the site of}} the bridge. When on the march, Harry and his brother carried their double-barrelled guns, each with one barrel charged with shot suitable for pheasants or other birds, the other with <b>buck-shot.</b> Dias carried a rifle. Very seldom did they mount their mules, the ground being so rough and broken, and the boughs of the trees so thick, that it was less trouble to walk at the heads of their animals than to ride.|$|E
60|$|Then came a {{momentary}} pause of astonishment. The weapons, instead of splintering the wood, merely made deep dents, or glided off harmlessly. Then the blows redoubled, {{and then a}} bright light suddenly lit up the whole scene. As it did so, from every loophole a stream of fire poured out, repeated again and again. The guns, heavily loaded with <b>buck-shot,</b> told with terrible effect upon the crowded mass of Indians around the windows, and the discharge of the four barrels {{from each of the}} three windows of the room {{at the back of the}} house, by Fitzgerald, Lopez, and Terence, for a while cleared the assailants from that quarter. After the first yell of astonishment and rage, a perfect quiet succeeded to the din which had raged there, broken only by the ring of the ramrods, as the three men and their assistants hastily reloaded their guns, and then hurried to the front of the house, where their presence was urgently required.|$|E
6000|$|... "As I {{fell over}} I blazed off both barrels of my gun, though, indeed, {{it was like}} attacking an {{elephant}} with a pea-shooter to imagine that any human weapon could cripple that mighty bulk. And yet I aimed better than I knew, for, with a loud report, {{one of the great}} blisters upon the creature's back exploded with the puncture of the <b>buck-shot.</b> It was very clear that my conjecture was right, and that these vast clear bladders were distended with some lifting gas, for in an instant the huge cloud- like body turned sideways, writhing desperately to find its balance, while the white beak snapped and gaped in horrible fury. But already I had shot away on the steepest glide that I dared to attempt, my engine still full on, the flying propeller and the force of gravity shooting me downwards like an aerolite. Far behind me I saw a dull, purplish smudge growing swiftly smaller and merging into the blue sky behind it. I was safe out of the deadly jungle of the outer air.|$|E
60|$|Weapons, {{to resist}} an Attack.--Unless your {{ammunition}} is so kept {{as to be}} accessible in the confusion of an attack, the fortifications I have just described would be of little service. If the guns are all, or nearly all, of the same bore, it is simple enough to have small bags filled with cartridges, and also papers with a dozen caps in each. <b>Buck-shot</b> and slugs are better than bullets, {{for the purposes of}} which we are speaking. Bows and arrows might render good service. The Chinese, in their junks, when they expect a piratical attack, bring up baskets filled with stones from the ballast of the ship, and put them on deck ready at hand. They throw them with great force and precision: the idea is not a bad one. Boiling water and hot sand, if circumstances happened to permit their use, are worth bearing in mind, as they tell well on the bodies of naked assailants. In close quarters, thrust, do not strike; and recollect {{that it is not the}} slightest use to hit a negro on the head with a stick, as it is a fact that his skull endures a blow better than any other part of his person. In picking out the chiefs, do not select the men that are the most showily ornamented, for they are not the chiefs; but the biggest and the busiest. A good horseman will find a powerful weapon at hand by unhitching his stirrup leather and attached stirrup from the saddle. I know of a case where this idea saved the rider.|$|E
6000|$|... "I chose my Paul Veroner {{monoplane}} for the job. There's {{nothing like}} a monoplane when real work is to be done. Beaumont found that out in very early days. For one thing it doesn't mind damp, and the weather looks as if we {{should be in the}} clouds all the time. It's a bonny little model and answers my hand like a tender-mouthed horse. The engine is a ten-cylinder rotary Robur working up to one hundred and seventy-five. It has all the modern improvements--enclosed fuselage, high-curved landing skids, brakes, gyroscopic steadiers, and three speeds, worked by an alteration of the angle of the planes upon the Venetian-blind principle. I took a shot-gun with me and a dozen cartridges filled with <b>buck-shot.</b> You should have seen the face of Perkins, my old mechanic, when I directed him to put them in. I was dressed like an Arctic explorer, with two jerseys under my overalls, thick socks inside my padded boots, a storm-cap with flaps, and my talc goggles. It was stifling outside the hangars, but I was going for the summit of the Himalayas, and had to dress for the part. Perkins knew there was something on and implored me to take him with me. Perhaps I should if I were using the biplane, but a monoplane is a one-man show--if {{you want to get the}} last foot of life out of it. Of course, I took an oxygen bag; the man who goes for the altitude record without one will either be frozen or smothered--or both.|$|E
6000|$|When {{at home at}} the Roost, the stout Jacob was not idle; but was {{prone to}} carry on a petty warfare of his own, for his private {{recreation}} and refreshment. Did he ever chance to espy, from his look-out place, a hostile ship or galley anchored or becalmed near shore, he would take down his long goose-gun from the hooks over the fire-place, sally out alone, and lurk along shore, dodging behind rocks and trees, and watching for hours together, like a veteran mouser intent on a rat-hole. So sure as a boat put off for shore, and came within shot, bang! went the great goose-gun; a shower of slugs and <b>buck-shot</b> whistled about the ears of the enemy, and before the boat could reach the shore, Jacob had scuttled up some woody ravine, and left no trace behind. About this time, the Roost experienced a vast accession of warlike importance, in being made one of the stations of the water-guard. This was a kind of aquatic corps of observation, composed of long, sharp, canoe-shaped boats, technically called whale-boats, that lay lightly on the water, and could be rowed with great rapidity. They were manned by resolute fellows, skilled at pulling an oar, or handling a musket. These lurked about in nooks and bays, and behind those long promontories which run out into the Tappan Sea, keeping a look-out, to give notice of the approach or movements of hostile ships. They roved about in pairs; sometimes at night, with muffled oars, gliding like spectres about frigates and guard-ships riding at anchor, cutting off any boats that made for shore, and keeping the enemy in constant uneasiness. These mosquito-cruisers generally kept aloof by day, so that their harboring places might not be discovered, but would pull quietly along, under shadow of the shore, at night, to take up their quarters at the Roost. Hither, at such time, would also repair the hard-riding lads of the hills, to hold secret councils of war with the [...] "ocean chivalry;" [...] and in these nocturnal meetings were concerted many of those daring forays, by land and water, that resounded throughout the border.|$|E
6000|$|MORE CUTTING AND SHOOTING.--The devil {{seems to}} have again broken [...] loose in our town. Pistols and guns explode and knives gleam in our [...] streets as in early times. When {{there has been a}} long season of [...] quiet, people are slow to wet their hands in blood; but once blood [...] is spilled, cutting and {{shooting}} come easy. Night before last Jack [...] Williams was assassinated, and yesterday forenoon we had more bloody [...] work, growing out of the killing of Williams, and on the same street [...] in which he met his death. It appears that Tom Reeder, a friend of [...] Williams, and George Gumbert were talking, at the meat market of the [...] latter, about the killing of Williams the previous night, when [...] Reeder said it was a most cowardly act to shoot a man in such a way, [...] giving him [...] "no show." [...] Gumbert said that Williams had [...] "as good a [...] show as he gave Billy Brown," [...] meaning the man killed by Williams [...] last March. Reeder said it was a d---d lie, that Williams had no [...] show at all. At this, Gumbert drew a knife and stabbed Reeder, [...] cutting him in two places in the back. One stroke of the knife cut [...] into the sleeve of Reeder's coat and passed downward in a slanting [...] direction through his clothing, and entered his body at the small of [...] the back; another blow struck more squarely, and made a much more [...] dangerous wound. Gumbert gave himself up to the officers of [...] justice, and was shortly after discharged by Justice Atwill, on his [...] own recognizance, to appear for trial at six o'clock in the evening. [...] In the meantime Reeder had been taken into the office of Dr. Owens, [...] where his wounds were properly dressed. One of his wounds was [...] considered quite dangerous, and it was thought by many that it would [...] prove fatal. But being considerably under the influence of liquor, [...] Reeder did not feel his wounds as he otherwise would, and he got up [...] and went into the street. He went to the meat market and renewed [...] his quarrel with Gumbert, threatening his life. Friends tried to [...] interfere {{to put a stop to}} the quarrel and get the parties away from [...] each other. In the Fashion Saloon Reeder made threats against the [...] life of Gumbert, saying he would kill him, and it is said that he [...] requested the officers not to arrest Gumbert, as he intended to kill [...] him. After these threats Gumbert went off and procured a [...] double-barreled shot gun, loaded with <b>buck-shot</b> or revolver balls, [...] and went after Reeder. Two or three persons were assisting him along [...] the street, trying to get him home, and had him just in front of the [...] store of Klopstock & Harris, when Gumbert came across toward him [...] from the opposite side of the street with his gun. He came up [...] within about ten or fifteen feet of Reeder, and called out to those [...] with him to [...] "look out! get out of the way!" [...] and they had only time [...] to heed the warning, when he fired. Reeder was at the time [...] attempting to screen himself behind a large cask, which stood [...] against the awning post of Klopstock & Harris's store, but some of [...] the balls took effect in the lower part of his breast, and he reeled [...] around forward and fell in front of the cask. Gumbert then raised [...] his gun and fired the second barrel, which missed Reeder and entered [...] the ground. At the time that this occurred, there were a great many [...] persons on the street in the vicinity, and a number of them called [...] out to Gumbert, when they saw him raise his gun, to [...] "hold on," [...] and [...] "don't shoot!" [...] The cutting took place about ten o'clock and the [...] shooting about twelve. After the shooting the street was instantly [...] crowded with the inhabitants of that part of the town, some [...] appearing much excited and laughing--declaring that it looked like [...] the [...] "good old times of '60." [...] Marshal Perry and officer Birdsall [...] were near when the shooting occurred, and Gumbert was immediately [...] arrested and his gun taken from him, when he was marched off to [...] jail. Many persons who were attracted to the spot where this bloody [...] work had just taken place, looked bewildered and seemed to be asking [...] themselves what was to happen next, appearing in doubt as to whether [...] the killing mania had reached its climax, or whether we were to turn [...] in and have a grand killing spell, shooting whoever might have given [...] us offence. It was whispered around that it was not all over yet [...] --five or six more were to be killed before night. Reeder was taken [...] to the Virginia City Hotel, and doctors called in to examine his [...] wounds. They found that two or three balls had entered his right [...] side; one of them appeared to have passed through the substance of [...] the lungs, while another passed into the liver. Two balls were also [...] found to have struck one of his legs. As some of the balls struck [...] the cask, the wounds in Reeder's leg were probably from these, [...] glancing downwards, though they might have been caused by the second [...] shot fired. After being shot, Reeder said when he got on his feet [...] --smiling as he spoke--"It will take better shooting than that to [...] kill me." [...] The doctors consider it almost impossible for him to [...] recover, but as he has an excellent constitution he may survive, [...] notwithstanding the number and dangerous character of the wounds he [...] has received. The town appears to be perfectly quiet at present, as [...] though the late stormy times had cleared our moral atmosphere; but [...] who can tell in what quarter clouds are lowering or plots ripening? ...|$|E
40|$|Detailed {{studies of}} {{preserved}} hypervelocity impact residues on spacecraft multi-layer insulation foils have yielded important {{information about the}} flux of small particles from different sources in low-Earth orbit (LEO). We have extended our earlier research on impacts occurring in LEO to design and testing of a compact capture device. MUlti-Layer Polymer EXperiment (MULPEX) is simple, cheap to build, lightweight, of no power demand, easy to deploy, and optimised for the efficient collection of impact residue for analysis on return to Earth. The capture medium is a stack of very thin (8 and 40 mu m) polyimide foils, supported on polytetrafluoroethylene sheet frames, surrounded by a protective aluminium casing. The uppermost foil has a very thin metallic coating for thermal protection and resistance to atomic oxygen and ultra-violet exposure. The casing provides a simple detachable interface for deployment on the spacecraft, facing into the desired direction for particle collection. On return to the laboratory, the stacked foils are separated for examination in a variable pressure scanning electron microscope, without need for surface coating. Analysis of impact residue is performed using energy dispersive X-ray spectrometers. Our laboratory experiments, utilising <b>buck-shot</b> firings of analogues to micrometeoroids (35 - 38 mu m olivine) and space debris (4 mu m alumina and 1 mm stainless steel) in a light gas gun, have shown that impact residue is abundant within the foil layers, and preserves {{a record of the}} impacting particle, whether of micrometer or millimetre dimensions. Penetrations of the top foil are easily recognised, and act as a proxy for dimensions of the penetrating particle. Impact may cause disruption and melting, but some residue retains sufficient crystallographic structure to show clear Raman lines, diagnostic of the original mineral.
