Its water-bottling plant survived until the early 1990s however. In January 2002, locals' interest to the hot spring, which had caught the attention of Singaporeans after the surrounding land had been cleared to begin the RSAF air <b>base</b> <b>extension.</b> Sembawang community leaders gathered signatures to petition Mindef, which was going to fence off the area, to preserve and develop the hot spring for the general public. Mindef gave the green light to the appeals and opened a small side gate pavement for the public to access the spring.|$|E

40|$|Various {{types of}} local zeta {{functions}} studied in asymptotic group theory admit two natural operations: (1) change the prime and (2) perform local <b>base</b> <b>extensions.</b> Often, {{the effects of}} both of these operations can be expressed simultaneously {{in terms of a}} single explicit formula. We show that in these cases, the behaviour of local zeta functions under variation of the prime in a set of density 1 in fact completely determines these functions for almost all primes and, moreover, it also determines their behaviour under local <b>base</b> <b>extensions.</b> We discuss applications to topological zeta functions, functional equations, and questions of uniformity.

To illustrate efficiency of the proposal, we make a simulation with the proposed framework for the international alignment of the Second World War in Europe. It is shown that the obtained results are essentially comparable to those given by the original theory. Consequently, the fuzzy-set-theoretic <b>based</b> <b>extension</b> of landscape theory can allow us to analyse a wide variety of aggregation processes that have previously been considered in a more flexible manner...|$|R

Farmers commonly seek agricultural information through extension agents and programs and more recently through the Internet. While many farmers have access to various Internet <b>based</b> <b>extension</b> tools using rural focused websites and Web 2. 0 technologies, not enough is known about the uptake and effectiveness of these tools.

The study sought {{to find out the}} extent to which the Community-Based Extension Agent has improved access to extension services to rural farmers. The study used qualitative and quantitative methods such as, Focus Group Discussions, Key Informants, In-depth interviews, Household and Institutional Questionnaires to collect and analyses data. The findings are that: there are vibrant Community <b>Based</b> <b>Extension</b> Agents established providing extension services in crop, livestock and environmental issues in the study District; farmers groups are linked to external agents and other stakeholders for access to credit facilities; the CBEAs were found to be the main link between the community and external agents; the most dominant extension services delivery carried out by the CBEAs in the entire study district were in crop production, livestock production and bushfire management; there are well established criteria for selecting Community <b>Based</b> <b>Extension</b> Agents, and community <b>Based</b> <b>Extension</b> Agents were least motivated. The study recommends among others that: motivation packages such as bicycles would facilitate the movement CBEAs to reach out to majority of the farmers. There is also the need to link CBEAs to relevant institutions/organizations for support and establishment of mechanisms to generate funds to support activities. Finally, stakeholders and organization need to intensify community sensitization and awareness creation on activities of CBEAs...|$|R

50|$|In {{a single}} <b>base</b> <b>extension</b> method, a primer is hybridized to DNA and {{extended}} by a dideoxyribonucleoside triphosphate {{that matches the}} nucleotide at a polymorphic site.
