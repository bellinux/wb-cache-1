50|$|The {{aircraft}} made further {{test flights}} during late 1954 from its base at Chilbolton airfield, Hampshire. In early 1955 {{it was taken}} by road to the Hursley Park factory for the installation of a flap <b>blowing</b> <b>system.</b> This was designed to reduce the safe landing approach speed, an obvious advantage for safe operation from aircraft carriers. It also lowered {{the speed at which}} catapult launches would be carried out.|$|E
50|$|The flap <b>blowing</b> <b>system</b> ("super-circulation") on the Type 525 used {{a device}} to project a thin jet of high {{pressure}} air, bled from an engine compressor, through a narrow slot along the wing trailing edge {{just ahead of the}} flap hinges. The Coandă effect then bent the jet of air over the flaps. The improved lift resulted in an 18 mph reduction in approach speed - most useful for carrier-based aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|Development of {{the general}} concept {{continued}} at NASA in the 1950s and 60s, leading to simplified systems with similar performance. The externally blown flap arranges the engine to blow across the flaps {{at the rear of}} the wing. Some of the jet exhaust is deflected downward directly by the flap, while additional air travels through the slots in the flap and follows the outer edge due to the Coandă effect. The similar upper-surface <b>blowing</b> <b>system</b> arranges the engines over the wing and relies completely on the Coandă effect to redirect the airflow. Although not as effective as direct blowing, these [...] "powered lift" [...] systems are nevertheless quite powerful and much simpler to build and maintain.|$|E

5000|$|The main {{ballast tank}} <b>blow</b> <b>system</b> failed to operate {{properly}} at test depth.

50|$|The Organ at Union Chapel was {{designed}} and built specially for the size and acoustics of the new Chapel building in 1877 by master organ builder Henry “Father” Willis. It is undoubtedly {{one of the finest}} in the world.Neither James Cubitt, the architect of the Chapel, nor Rev Henry Allon, the minister at the time, wanted the congregation to be distracted by the sight of an organ or organist: they wanted the music itself to be the focus during worship. So the organ is deliberately hidden away behind ornate screens under the rose window, which itself actually hints at the organ’s importance, with its depiction of eight angels all playing different musical instruments.

40|$|A <b>blowing</b> <b>system</b> for {{controlling}} the aerodynamics of a ground vehicle comprises {{a source of}} compressed air, a valve for regulating {{the flow of the}} compressed air, and a plenum for discharging the air at a rear portion of the vehicle. The air discharged through the plenum prevents flow separation and consequently reduces the drag on the vehicle. It may also increase lift, reducing effective weight and thus rolling resistance of the tires, or decrease lift to improve tire traction and handling. The <b>blowing</b> <b>system</b> may have separate plenums for the left and right sides of the vehicle whereby vortex roll-up and flow separation which occur on only one side of the vehicle may be eliminated. Asymmetrical blowing of only one plenum will produce rolling and yawing moments to restore the vehicle's lateral/directional stability when exposed to a side wind. Further, the <b>blowing</b> <b>system</b> may have a lower plenum for reattaching flow, generating a negative lift or download to increase traction, braking, and handling and for generating pitch trim. The <b>blowing</b> <b>system</b> may have a number of sensors for detecting various conditions, such as the direction and pressure of a relative wind, turbulence {{at the rear of the}} vehicle, braking, or angle of steering. The <b>blowing</b> <b>system</b> may be responsive to one or more of these conditions to selectively adjust the aerodynamics of the vehicle. Georgia Tech Research Corporatio...|$|E

This scheme, which combines favorable characteristics of both the A- 6 /CCW and QSRA, employs the flow entrainment properties of CCW to pneumatically deflect engine thrust {{in lieu of the}} mechanical USB flap system.

The conventional electrospinning process requires a grounded electrode on which highly charged electrospun ultrafine fibers are deposited.

40|$|Abstract—Silicon {{trackers}} at the SLHC {{will suffer}} high radiation damage from particles produced during the collisions, {{which leads to}} high leakage currents. Reducing these currents in the sensors requires efficient cooling to- 30 0 C. The large heat of evaporation of CO 2 and the low viscosity allows for a two-phase cooling system with thin and long cooling pipes, because the small flow of liquid needed leads to negligible temperature drops. In {{order to reduce the}} material budget a system is proposed in which a large scale tracker requiring ca. 50 kW of power is powered via 1 - 2 mm diameter aluminum cooling pipes with a length of several m. These long cooling pipes allow to have all service connections outside the tracking volume, thus reducing the material budget significantly. The whole system is designed to have negligible thermal stresses. A CO 2 <b>blow</b> <b>system</b> has been designed and first tests show the feasibility of a barrel detector with long ladders and disks at small radii leading to an optimized design with respect to material budget and simplicity in construction.

40|$|A {{preferred}} {{embodiment of the}} present invention, a <b>blowing</b> <b>system</b> for high performance vehicles, comprises a source of compressed air and a mechanism for regulating and controlling the flow of air from the source. Referring to FIG. 2, the compressed air is routed from its source through the regulating mechanism and to an aerodynamic surface (17) attached to the automobile in any appropriate manner. Although not required, the present system could be augmented by placing a plenum (21) inside the aerodynamic surface (17) for collecting the compressed air. This aerodynamic surface (17) preferably has a rounded trailing edge (19) or edges. The compressed air will be discharged from the aerodynamic surface (17) through a slot (22) in an outer surface of the aerodynamic surface (17). Preferably, the slot (22) would be on an under-side of a rear portion of the aerodynamic surface (17). However, {{the presence of a}} second slot on an upper-side of a rear portion of the aerodynamic surface (17) may also be desirable. The tangentially ejected air will then attach to the aerodynamic surface and sweep around the rounded trailing edge (19). Flow across the aerodynamic surface will be entrained, and a greater lift force will be generated, which may be directed either upward (lift) or as a download. Control of drag and aerodynamic moments will also result. In another aspect of the present invention, as in FIG. 6, the effect of the blown aerodynamic surface (62) could be enhanced through a <b>blowing</b> <b>system</b> for vertical end plates (52) {{at both ends of the}} aerodynamic surface (62). Compressed air is discharged through slots (54) in the end plates (52). The air will entrain the flow coming from the trailing edge of the aerodynamic surface (62) and enhance the down force. In a further improvement to the present invention, the compressed air discharge slots (67) may be arranged along the rear lower surface of the vehicle's body, which is curved upward to convert the lower body to an aerodynamic surface for download and control moment generation.

2500|$|Deep-sea photography, {{recovered}} artifacts, and {{an evaluation}} of her design and operational history permitted a Court of Inquiry to conclude Thresher had probably suffered {{the failure of a}} salt-water piping system joint which relied heavily on silver brazing instead of welding; earlier tests using ultrasound equipment found potential problems with about 14% of the tested brazed joints, most of which were determined not to pose a risk significant enough to require a repair. High-pressure water spraying from a broken pipe joint may have shorted out one of the many electrical panels, causing a shutdown ("scram") of the reactor, with a subsequent loss of propulsion. The inability to blow the ballast tanks was later attributed to excessive moisture in the submarine's high-pressure air flasks, moisture which froze and plugged the flasks' flowpaths while passing through the valves. This was later simulated in dock-side tests on Threshers sister sub, [...] During a test to simulate blowing ballast at or near test depth, ice formed on strainers installed in valves; the flow of air lasted only a few seconds.
