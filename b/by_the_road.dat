5|$|Garrick {{built the}} temple on land {{adjoining}} a villa {{that he had}} bought in October 1754 {{to serve as a}} country retreat. The villa's riverside garden, a plot now known as Garrick's Lawn, was separated from the main property <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> from Kingston upon Thames to Staines. Garrick commissioned the building of an elaborate grotto-tunnel under the road, illuminated by 500 lanterns, to facilitate private access to the lawn from the house.|$|E

5|$|Soviet Strike began {{development}} as a game for the 3DO under the working title of 32-bit Strike. Strike series creator Mike Posehn assisted in early programming and the design but otherwise {{did not wish to}} work as part of a large team, necessitated by the move to a more advanced console. The development team, who had already spent several months working on the 3DO version, decided to rework it instead as a PlayStation game when {{it was clear that the}} 3DO's demise was inevitable; an additional two years' labor time was the result. The team re-evaluated the basics of the 16-bit games and aimed to create more lifelike environments and enemy behaviour. The 3D engine - created <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Road</b> Rash 3DO team - used satellite images of real topography, imposed on polygonal maps. It also modified the preceding isometric viewpoint - which caused buildings to obstruct the player's view - to an overhead perspective with which the player could move and see over terrain and structures. In order to ensure proper spatial relations and unit placement, the team built three dimensional reliefs of each mission on sheets of plywood. Unlike some of its predecessors, Soviet Strike features only a helicopter - albeit with power-ups in some levels - and the team also abandoned the unpopular on-foot levels found in Urban Strike. The developers aimed to include more humour in the game, with other additions being voice-overs and full motion video.|$|E

25|$|The Smalbroke name, also spelled Smallbrook, {{is remembered}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> Smallbrook Queensway, {{formerly}} Smallbrook Street, in Birmingham City Centre.

25|$|The {{first sign}} the Americans had of the enemy's {{proximity}} was a Cuban Army soldier lying dead <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> The engagement began with shots by U.S. artillery.

The Spaniards were armed with superior 7mm 1893 model Mauser repetition rifles that fired round after round of smokeless gunpowder, making them exceedingly difficult to target in return.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from any}} {{acceleration}} that might {{occur in the}} direction of the path, the lower panel of the image above indicates the forces on the ball. There are two forces; one is the force of gravity vertically downward through the center of mass of the ball mg, where m is the mass of the ball and g is the gravitational acceleration; the second is the upward normal force exerted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> at a right angle to the road surface man. The centripetal force demanded by the curved motion is also shown above. This centripetal force is not a third force applied to the ball, but rather must be provided by the net force on the ball resulting from vector addition of the normal force and the force of gravity. The resultant or net force on the ball found by vector addition of the normal force exerted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> and vertical force due to gravity must equal the centripetal force dictated by the need to travel a circular path. The curved motion is maintained so long as this net force provides the centripetal force requisite to the motion.|$|E

25|$|A compact {{version of}} Arial Bold is {{currently}} the typeface preferred <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Road</b> Transport Department and is thus the most commonly used, but other easy-to-read typefaces are generally acceptable. Common alternative choices include Charles Wright, which has been used on Singaporean, Hong Konger, and British plates, and FE-Schrift, which is used on German plates and is thus popular among Malaysian owners of cars with European marques, especially German models. More obscure custom typefaces have also been known to be used primarily on grey import vehicles and aftermarket license plates.|$|E
