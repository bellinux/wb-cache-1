25|$|The ecdysial suture {{is made of}} the coronal, frontal, and epicranial sutures {{plus the}} ecdysial and {{cleavage}} lines, which vary among different species of insects. The ecdysial suture is longitudinally placed on the vertex and separates the epicranial halves of the head {{to the left and}} right sides. Depending on the insect, the suture may come in different shapes: like either a Y, U, or V. Those diverging lines that make up the ecdysial suture are called the frontal or frontogenal sutures. Not all species of insects have frontal sutures, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>those</b> that do, the sutures split open during ecdysis, which helps provide an opening for the new instar to emerge from the integument.|$|E
25|$|In 1925, an {{airfield}} {{was constructed}} near Rostov-on-Don. A plot of 120 {{acres of land}} was allocated {{for it in the}} fields of one of Rostov-on-Don's suburbs. A house for the airport's head and the staff, as well as fuel storage facilities, were constructed there. A paved road connected the airport with the city.

500|$|In 2010, the NWA, {{represented}} by NWA Mexico president Blue Demon Jr., {{reached out to}} CMLL {{and asked them to}} stop using the NWA-branded championships since they were not part of the NWA. Blue Demon Jr. {{was in the process of}} establishing NWA Mexico as a promotion and wanted to use the championship.

The promotion did not directly respond to the latest claim; the NWA Welterweight Champion, Mephisto, commented instead, simply stating that the championships belonged to CMLL. Finally, on August 12, 2010, CMLL debuted the new NWA World Historic Light Heavyweight Championship belt and named El Texano Jr., the final CMLL-recognized NWA World Light Heavyweight Champion, as the inaugural champion.

2500|$|A housing {{cooperative}} is normally de facto non-profit, since usually {{most of its}} income comes from the rents paid by its residents (if in a formal corporation, then shareholders), who are invariably its members. There {{is no point in}} creating a deliberate surplus—except for operational requirements such as setting aside funds for replacement of assets—since that simply means that the rents paid by members are set higher than the expenses. (Note, however, that it's quite possible for a housing co-op to own other revenue-generating assets, such as a subsidiary business which could produce surplus income to offset the cost of the housing, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>those</b> cases the housing rents are usually reduced to compensate for the additional revenue.) ...|$|E

2500|$|In An Archive of Feelings, Cvetkovich {{argues for}} a wider view of trauma that moves beyond those who {{experience}} it directly by also {{taking into consideration}} its everyday and cultural effects. She states, “I am interested not just in trauma survivors <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>those</b> whose experiences circulate {{in the vicinity of}} trauma and are marked by it. I want to place moments of extreme trauma alongside moments of everyday emotional distress that are often the only sign that trauma's effects are still being felt.” Furthermore, Cvetkovich not only sexualizes and queers trauma in her book, but she also critiques the pathologization of trauma and argues for a broader understanding of therapy. She breaks the binary “often animated in trauma studies scholarship between acting out (frequently pathologized or designated unhealthy) and working through (often viewed as psychologically positive).” Cvetkovich suggests that the public cultures formed around trauma – trauma cultures – can have therapeutic effects. Collapsing the boundary between privatized emotion and the public and political, “affective life can be seen to pervade public life.” ...|$|E
