Almost one-third of the subjects reported that the experience was the single most meaningful or spiritually significant event of their lives, and over two-thirds reported it among their five most spiritually significant events. About two-thirds indicated that the experience increased their sense of well-being or life satisfaction. Even after 14 months, those who reported mystical experiences scored on average 4 percentage points higher on the personality trait of Openness/Intellect; personality traits are normally stable across the lifespan for adults.

40|$|Sound {{evidence-based}} {{clinical and}} policy therapy recommendations {{depend on a}} process of acquiring literature, appraising it for study design and quality, and assessing its results in terms <b>of</b> relative <b>benefits</b> <b>and</b> <b>harms.</b> In this article we describe two summary metrics {{that have been developed}} to assist guideline developers to assess the importance of the quality/size of trials <b>and</b> the relative <b>benefit</b> <b>and</b> <b>harm</b> <b>of</b> treatments, <b>and</b> a related graphical method for displaying them together. To illustrate this graphic approach, we have used the evidence base for drug therapies for neuropathic pain. "Reliability" is calculated from the sample size and quality of trials, while the second metric, "Net Gain," is calculated from the relative <b>benefit</b> <b>and</b> <b>harm</b> <b>of</b> each trial. The graphical method differentiated the evidence for neuropathic pain drugs. This graphical output provides a simple and relatively easy way to understand summary of information on large amounts of trial data across a number of therapies, which may present an impression of the evidence at a glance even for a non-expert. The usefulness of this graphical approach needs to be tested in the development of future clinical guidelines...|$|R

40|$|Although {{screening}} for elevated blood pressure (BP) in adults is beneficial, evidence of its beneficial effects in children is not clear. Elevated BP in children {{is associated with}} atherosclerosis early in life and tracks across the life course. However, {{because of the high}} variability in BP, tracking is weak, and having an elevated BP in childhood has a low predictive value for having elevated BP later in life. The absolute risk of cardiovascular diseases associated with a given level of BP in childhood and the long-term effect of treatment beginning in childhood are not known. No study has experimentally evaluated the <b>benefits</b> <b>and</b> <b>harm</b> <b>of</b> BP screening in children. One modeling study indicates that BP screen-and-treat strategies in adolescents are moderately cost-effective but less cost-effective than population-wide interventions to decrease BP for the reduction of coronary heart diseases. The US National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the European Society of Hypertension recommend that children 3 years of age and older have their BP measured during every health care visit. According to the US Preventive Services Task Force, there is no sufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening, but their recommendations have to be updated. Whether the benefits of universal BP screening in children outweigh the harm has to be determined. Studies are needed to assess the absolute risk of cardiovascular diseases associated with elevated BP in childhood, to evaluate how to simplify the identification of elevated BP, to evaluate the long-term <b>benefits</b> <b>and</b> <b>harm</b> <b>of</b> treatment beginning in childhood, and to compare universal and targeted screening strategies...|$|R

40|$|To compare {{persistence}} with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) antagonists among {{rheumatoid arthritis}} patients in British Columbia. Treatment persistence {{has been suggested}} {{as a proxy for}} real-world therapeutic <b>benefit</b> <b>and</b> <b>harm</b> <b>of</b> treatments for chronic non-curable diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis. We hypothesized that the different pharmacological characteristics of infliximab, adalimumab and etanercept cause statistically and clinically significant differences in persistence. We conducted a population-based cohort study using administrative health data from the Canadian province of British Columbia. The study cohort included rheumatoid arthritis patients who initiated the first course of a TNF antagonist between 2001 and 2008. Persistence was measured as the time between first dispensing to discontinuation. Drug discontinuation was defined as a drug-free interval of 180 days or switching to another TNF antagonist, anakinra, rituximab or abatacept. Persistence was estimated and compared using survival analysis. The study cohort included 2, 923 patients, 63 % treated with etanercept. Median persistence in years (95 % confidence interval) with infliximab was 3. 7 (2. 9 - 4. 9), with adalimumab 3. 3 (2. 6 - 4. 1) and with etanercept 3. 8 (3. 3 - 4. 3). Similar risk of discontinuation was observed for the three drugs: the hazard ratio (95 % confidence interval) was 0. 98 (0. 85 - 1. 13) comparing infliximab with etanercept, 0. 95 (0. 78 - 1. 15) comparing infliximab with adalimumab and 1. 04 (0. 88 - 1. 22) comparing adalimumab with etanercept. Similar persistence was observed with infliximab, adalimumab and etanercept in rheumatoid arthritis patients during the first 9 years of use. If treatment persistence is a good proxy for the therapeutic <b>benefit</b> <b>and</b> <b>harm</b> <b>of</b> these drugs, then this finding suggests that the three drugs share an overall similar benefit-harm profile in rheumatoid arthritis patients...|$|R

40|$|Electronic {{cigarettes}} (e-cigarettes) {{are relatively}} new in South Africa and their popularity is increasing. Their appearance coincides with intensifying attempts by government and society to reduce tobacco smoking through stricter limitation on its sale, advertising and use.

Opinions among doctors regarding e-cigarettes vary, some seeing potential for good, others condemning them outright. Several professional medical societies have taken the stand that, whatever their potential as a smoking-cessation method, they cannot be encouraged since they are produced and promoted by the tobacco industry.
