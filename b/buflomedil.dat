40|$|Summary: The {{interference}} of <b>buflomedil</b> {{with the}} monoclonal and polyclonal EMIT d. a. u. amphetamine immuno-assays was investigated. Urine samples collected from 20 patients taking 600 mg of <b>buflomedil</b> daily gave false positive results with the monoclonal EMIT d. a. u. assay, as did urine specimens collected 2 {{hours after the}} first oral dose of <b>buflomedil.</b> Conversely, no false positive results occurred with the polyclonal EMIT d. a. u. amphetamine assay. Urine samples with <b>buflomedil</b> added at concentrations greater than 100 mg/ 1 gave false positive results with the monoclonal immunoassay. <b>Buflomedil</b> concentrations found in the patient urines (56 — 400 mg/ 1) failed to corre-late to EMIT assay responses: this result suggests that one or more <b>buflomedil</b> metabolites, besides the unchanged drug, probably interfere in the monoclonal EMIT d. a. u. assay...|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{designed}} {{to determine the effect}} of <b>buflomedil</b> on vascular responsiveness. Rings of canine arteries and veins were suspended for isometric tension recording at 37 ° C. <b>Buflomedil</b> caused concentration-dependent inhibition of the contractile responses to norepinephrine, methoxamine, phenylephrine, clonidine, xylazine and sympathetic nerve activation, but not of the responses to potassium, prostaglandin F(2 α), acetylcholine or 5 -hydroxytryptamine. The inhibitory effect of <b>buflomedil</b> was not afffected by endothelium removal but was reduced by chemical sympathectomy with 6 -hydroxydopamine and by inhibitors of neuronal uptake. Strips of canine saphenous veins were superfused after incubation with [3 H]norepinephrine. <b>Buflomedil</b> augmented the efflux of [3 H]norepinephrine, 3, 4 -[3 H]dihydroxyphenylglycol, 3, 4 -[3 H]dihydroxymandelic acid and [3 H]- 3 -methoxy- 4 -hydroxyphenylglycol under basal conditions and the overflow of [3 H]norepinephrine, 3, 4 -[3 H]dihydroxymandelic acid and 3, 4 -[3 H]dihydroxyphenylglycol during sympathetic nerve activation. The augmentation by <b>buflomedil</b> of the release of [3 H]norepinephrine evoked by electrical stimulation was prevented by phentolamine. In the perfused gracilis muscle of the anesthetized dog, <b>buflomedil</b> depressed the vasoconstrictor response to norepinephrine more than that evoked by angiotensin II. These experiments suggest that <b>buflomedil</b> blocks alpha adrenoceptors, but is not selective for either the alpha- 1 or alpha- 2 adrenoceptor subtype.

40|$|To {{clarify the}} mode of action of the {{vasoactive}} agent <b>buflomedil,</b> we evaluated plasma levels of adenosine and adenine nucleotides after intravenous (i. v.) infusion in humans of 50, 100, and 200 mg of the drug in 20 min. <b>Buflomedil</b> induced an increase of the same order of magnitude in plasma levels of adenosine and adenine nucleotides. Maximal adenosine increase (84 %) was observed {{at the end of}} the infusion period, whereas peak plasma levels of ATP and ADP (69 and 55 %, respectively) and of AMP (61 %) were detected 10 and 5 min after discontinuation of infusion, respectively. Although the exact mode of action of <b>buflomedil</b> at the molecular level remains unclear, some indirect findings suggest that the increase in adenosine may be due to enhanced release rather than to inhibition of cell uptake.

A blood specimen submitted to this laboratory tested positive for tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) by EMIT (Behring, Cupertino, CA) and negative by FPIA (Abbott, Wiesbaden, Germany). A number of antidepressants were screened for in blood by a high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method (1) : amineptine, amitriptyline, amoxapine, clomipramine, desipramine, dosulepine, doxepin, fluoxetine, imipramine, maprotiline, metapramine, mianserine, nomifensine, nortriptyline, opipramol, propizepine, protriptyline, quinupramine, tianeptine, trimipramine, and vilox,~ine. None of these compounds were found in this sample. Drug screening for phenothiazines (2), which are known to be a frequent cause of false-positive results with immunoassays (3), was negative. A comprehensive drug test, performed by HPLC with diode-array detection (4), identified <b>buflomedil,</b> a peripheral vasodi ator, at a concentration f 28 mg/L in this specimen.

40|$|Several oral "vasoactive" drugs {{claim to}} {{increase}} walking capacity {{in patients with}} intermittent claudication (IC). Naftidrofuryl, cilostazol, <b>buflomedil,</b> and pentoxifylline are the most studied molecules. Although spanning several decades, several studies underlying these claims were not properly designed, underpowered or showed clinically doubtful outcomes. The evidence for these "vasoactive" drugs has always been received with scepticism, creating the need for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. This brief review discusses the benefit-risk assessment of vasoactive drugs, by applying a systematic review to evaluate randomized, placebo-controlled trials. Oral naftidrofuryl and cilostazol have an acceptable safety profile as well as sustained evidence (documented by Cochrane analyses) of increased walking capacity. Subsequently, these drugs entered recommendations for peripheral arterial disease (PAD). In contrast, <b>buflomedil</b> and pentoxifylline have limited and/or doubtful evidence to increase walking capacity. Moreover, there were safety concerns about the narrow therapeutic range of <b>buflomedil.</b> Most other "vasoactive" drugs were either inappropriately or insufficiently tested or showed no significant if not negative effects on IC. "Vasoactive" drugs are no substitutes for lifestyle or exercise therapy but are adjuvant treatment to the well-appreciated triad of cardiovascular prevention (antiplatelet agents, statins and ACE-inhibitors), of which statins {{in their own right}} have documented claims to significantly increase walking capacity. "Vasoactive" drugs may have a place in the pharmacological management of symptomatic PAD in addition to the basic cardiovascular pharmacotherapy, when revascularization is not indicated, when exercise therapy is not feasible or when there is still insufficient benefit...|$|E

Global symptoms, sensorimotor disorders and vertigo were improved in all treatment groups, although improvement tended to be more pronounced with ticlopidine- pentoxifylline. None of the groups showed any change in stenosis or vessel wall rigidity although ticlopidine- pentoxifylline reduced flow irregularity. This combination therapy also normalized the direction of flow in the ophthalmic artery in 46. 2 % of patients with retrograde flow prior to treatment, compared with 30. 0 % following aspirin- dipyridamole- <b>buflomedil</b> and 28. 6 % following buflomedil- placebo administration.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{investigated}} the effects of <b>buflomedil</b> and pentoxifylline, {{both of which are}} used in reconstructive surgery of hamster skin flap microcirculation, and evaluated the skin flap survival rate by orthogonal polarization spectral imaging. METHOD: Twenty-four adult male Syrian golden hamsters were divided into three groups: a control (C, 0. 1 ml 0. 9 % saline), <b>buflomedil</b> (B, 3 mg/kg/day), and pentoxifylline group (P, 14. 5 mg/kg/day). Treatments administered intraperitoneally were initiated 1 hour before skin flap preparation and continued for 7 days post-operatively at 12 -hour intervals. Preparations (skin flaps) were divided into 12 fields, which were organized into six bands. Functional capillary density (FCD, in mm/mm²), distance from the skin flap base to blood flow cessation (Dist with flow, in cm), percentage of viable skin (VA, in%), and qualitative analysis of blood flow by orthogonal polarization spectral imaging were performed at 1 and 24 hours and on the seventh post-operative day. RESULT: Bands IV, V, and VI presented no flow independent of time. The functional capillary density group B was higher than that of groups C and P, primarily after 24 hours. All groups showed an increase in D with time but reached similar final distances (C = 2. 73, B = 2. 78 and P = 2. 70 cm). Moreover, the percentage of viable areas remained at approximately 50 %. The orthogonal polarization spectral imaging was useful to assess viability by counting fields with and without blood flow. CONCLUSIONS: Functional capillary density values were higher in the <b>buflomedil</b> group compared to the control and pentoxifylline groups in this model. Functional capillary density did not influence D or the percentage of VA, and the technique showed favorable potential to assess/predict the viability of skin flaps within 1 h after surgery...|$|E
40|$|Benefit-risk {{assessment}} {{should be}} ongoing {{during the life}} cycle of a pharmaceutical agent. New products are subjected to rigorous registration laws and rules, which attempt to assure the availability and validity of evidence. For older products, bias in benefit-risk assessment is more likely, as a number of safeguards were not in place at the time these products were registered. This issue of bias in benefit-risk assessment of older products is illustrated here with an example: <b>buflomedil</b> in intermittent claudication. Data on efficacy were retrieved from a Cochrane systematic review. Data on safety were obtained by comparing the number of reports of serious adverse events and fatalities published in the literature with those reported in postmarketing surveillance databases. In the case of efficacy, the slim basis of evidence for the benefit of <b>buflomedil</b> is undermined by documented publication bias. In the case of safety, bias in reporting to international safety databases is illustrated by the discrepancy between the number of drug-related deaths published in the literature (20), the potentially drug-related deaths in the WHO database (20) and deaths attributed to <b>buflomedil</b> in the database of the international marketing authorization holder (11). In older products, efficacy cannot be evaluated without a thorough search for publication bias. For safety, case reporting of drug-related serious events and deaths in the literature remains a necessary instrument for risk appraisal of older medicines, despite the existence of postmarketing safety databases. The enforcement of efficient communication between healthcare workers, drug companies, national centres of pharmacovigilance, national poison centers and the WHO is necessary to ensure the validity of postmarketing surveillance reporting systems.

(some col.) 29 cmPentoxifylline is a xanthine derivative chemically {{related to}} theophylline and caffeine. The drug {{is said to}} improve tissue oxygenation in chronic vascular occlusive disease by increasing RBC deformability and {{has been reported to}} improve survival in experimental hemorrhagic, septic and endotoxic shock. In the present investigation, the effects of pentoxifylline on endotoxin-induced mortality, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), hypotension, and reduction in blood cell deformability were studied in awake rats and compared with the effects produced by two other xanthine compounds, theophylline and caffeine, and by a non-xanthine compound, <b>buflomedil.</b> In control rats, endotoxin (25 mg/kg, i. v.) produced a 92 % mortality as well as clinical laboratory signs of DIC. The latter included increased serum fibrin(ogen) degradation products (FDP), prothrombin time. and partial thromboplastin time, and decreased plasma fibrinogen and blood platelet count as well as evidence of gross visceral hemorrhage. Pretreatment with pentoxifylline (25 - 50 mg/kg), caffeine sodium benzoate (25 - 200 mg/kg) and <b>buflomedil</b> hydrochloride (2. 5 - 50 mg/kg) produced a dose-dependent reduction in the endotoxin-induced mortality and inhibited most of the manifestations of DIC produced by endotoxin. Pretreatment With theophylline (given in the form of aminophylline, 5 - 125 mg/kg), did not inhibit the endotoxin-induced DIC and failed to protect against death caused by the lipopolysaccharide. The effects of drugs on blood pressure and heart rate were studied in awake rats With implanted carotid catheters. All four drugs produced a dose-dependent lowering of arterial pressure when administered as a pretreatment. The administration of endotoxin (25 mg/kg) in control animals caused an immediate fall in arterial pressure, followed by a partial recovery and a later progressive decline until death of the animal. All of the control animals in this series died Within 24 hours. Pretreatment with pentoxifylline (50 mg/kg), caffeine sodium benzoate (I 00 - 200 mg/kg) and <b>buflomedil</b> hydrochloride (30 - 50 mg/kg) significantly reduced the endotoxin-induced hypotension as well as the mortality during the 24 -hour period of observation. In contrast, pretreatment With aminophylline (50 - 100 mg/kg) not only failed to antagonize the hypotension caused by endotoxin but actually had a deleterious effect: post-endotoxin blood pressure in the aminophylline pretreated series was significantly lower than in the saline pretreated endotoxin controls throughout the period of observation. All animals in the aminophylline series died. Vasodilator agents are known to have a protective action in circulatory shock. In the present study, the hypotensive effect produced by aminophylline was comparable to that produced by protective doses of the other agents. The difference in protective efficacy therefore was not related to a difference in vasodilator efficacy. Heart rate measurements showed that there was no correlation between cardiac stimulation produced by the xanthines and protection against endotoxic shock. All three xanthines caused a dose-dependent increase in the heart rate and antagonized the bradycardia caused by endotoxin. However, only pentoxifylline and caffeine increased survival. <b>Buflomedil</b> actually slowed the heart rate but nevertheless inhibited the endotoxin-induced bradycardia and decreased the mortality, Endotoxin (25 mg/kg) was found to cause a reduction in RBC deformability. The in vivo administration of pentoxifylline, caffeine and <b>buflomedil</b> improved the deformability of both erythrocytes and leukocytes and was found to reverse the endotoxin-induced reduction in RBC deformability. In contrast. aminophylline did not {{have a significant effect on}} blood cell deformability and did not affect the rheological effect of endotoxin. The present. investigation thus showed that prevention of endotoxin-induced DIC, circulatory shock and death by pentoxifylline, <b>buflomedil</b> and caffeine was positively correlated with an ability of the drugs to improve blood cell deformability. The hypothesis is advanced that a causal relationship may exist between the latter action and the protective action of the three drugs in endotoxic shock...|$|E

Recent {{studies have shown that}} L-propionyl-carnitine (LPC) can possibly moderate the tissue damage induced by ischaemia in peripheral arteriopathic disorders, in the present study 12 patients with severe obstructive chronic arteriopathy were treated either with 2 g of LPC (plus heparin and <b>buflomedil)</b> by slow infusion b. i. d, or by placebo plus heparin and <b>buflomedil,</b> in the LPC-treated patients, one lesion was completely healed (17 %); two showed a > 50 % decrease in the surface of the ulcerative lesion (34 %) and three a reduction in such surface < 50 % (50 %). Control patients showed a reduction < 50 % of the ulcerative lesions in two cases (34 %), unaltered limits of the ulcer margin in three cases (50 %) and worsening of such a lesion in one case. in addition, the LPC-treated patients showed a progressive reduction in the evening pain symptom as monitored by the fewer requested doses of the analgesic compound ketoprofen (77 vs 125 requests for administration in treated and control patients, respectively). The long-term effect of LPC treatment evaluated after three months showed that in treated patients only one minor (digital) amputation was performed, whereas in the control group two patients underwent minor (digital and foot) and one major (above knee) amputations, in conclusion {{the results of the present}} preliminary study suggest that LPC administration can improve the healing of ulcerative lesions, can reduce the need for analgesic medication and can lessen the incidence of amputation...|$|E

40|$|Plasmodium falciparum malaria, a {{parasitic}} disease, and {{sickle cell}} anemia, a hereditary disease, are two diseases affecting erythrocyte cycle, occurring {{with a high}} prevalence in tropical Africa. They may induce microthrombosis inducing vaso-occlusion, organ dysfunction and flap necrosis. During the acute phase of Plasmodium falciparum malaria, destruction of parasitized and healthy erythrocytes, release of parasite and erythrocyte material into the circulation, and secondary host reaction occur. Plasmodium falciparum infected erythrocytes also sequester in the microcirculation of vital organs and may interfere with microcirculatory flow in the flap during the postoperative period. The lower legs of homozygous sickle cell anemia patients are areas of marginal vascularity where minor abrasions become foci of inflammation. Inflammation results in decreased local oxygen tension, sickling of erythrocytes, increased blood viscosity and thrombosis with consequent ischemia, tissue breakdown and leg ulcer. Tissue transfer has become the procedure of choice for reconstruction of the lower third of the leg although flaps may become necrotic.

40|$|Water and solute or drug {{transport}} in crosslinked {{polymeric materials}} was investigated {{to determine the}} effects of polymer morphology, composition and solute properties on transport behavior. Two crosslinked polymer systems, poly(2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate-co-methyl methacrylate) (P(HEMA-co-MMA)) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), were used in water transport and solute release experiments. Structural parameters of the polymers investigated in this work included the initial polymer molecular weight, the nominal crosslinking ratio, and the copolymer composition. Swelling rates, water diffusion coefficients and the diffusional Deborah number, De, were used to characterize the water uptake process. Swelling rates correlated well with the polymer network mesh sizes; the slowest rate of water uptake was observed in P(HEMA-co-MMA) samples containing large quantities of methyl methacrylate. Initial crosslinking ratios had a sizable effect on water uptake in crosslinked PVA samples but not in the P(HEMA-co-MMA) polymers. Drug release rates, drug diffusion coefficients and the swelling interface number, Sw, were used to characterize solute transport. Release experiments were conducted using eight solutes: theophylline, triamterene, oxprenolol HCl, <b>buflomedil</b> HCl, vitamin B 12, dextran, inulin and myoglobin.

40|$|Experiments were {{designed}} {{to determine the effect}} of CRL 41034, a <b>buflomedil</b> analogue, on the adrenergic responsiveness of canine veins. Rings of saphenous vein (without endothelium) were suspended for isometric tension recording in modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution at 37 °C. CRL 41034 produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of the contractions evoked by the alpha adrenergic agonists norepinephrine, phenylephrine and UK 14304 which was insensitive to the blockade of neuronal uptake by cocaine. CRL 41034 was more potent in inhibiting the concentration-dependent contractions evoked by UK 14304 than those by phenylephrine and the antagonism it caused against the response to UK 14304 fulfilled the criteria for competitivity. CRL 41034, at 10 - 5 M significantly depressed, and at 10 - 4 M abolished the contractions induced by electrical stimulation of the adrenergic nerves and those evoked by the indirect sympathomimetic amine tyramine. Strips of canine saphenous vein were superfused after incubation with [3 H] norepinephrine. During sympathetic nerve activation, CRL 41304 increased the stimulation-evoked overflow of [3 H] norepinephrine and 3 -methoxy- 4 -dihydroxyphenylglycol; in the presence of rauwolscine the compound only increased the stimulation-evoked overflow of 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylglycol. These experiments suggest that the major vascular effects of CRL 41304 in canine veins are blockade of alpha 2 -adrenoceptors on vascular smooth muscle, and inhibition of prejunctional alpha 2 -adrenoceptors on adrenergic nerve endings. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Pentoxifylline (PTX) is a methylxanthine {{derivative}} {{used in a}} {{wide range}} of dermatoses. As well as its hemorrheologic activity, PTX has anti-inflammatory properties. <b>Buflomedil</b> chlorhydrate (BC) is another hemorrheological drug with peripheral vasodilatory action, whose clinical uses are similar to those of PTX. Both drugs increase intracellular levels of cAMP, either secondary to phosphodiesterase inhibition (PTX) or adenyl-cyclase stimulation (BC). Long-term cultures of normal human keratinocytes were prepared in a free-serum medium, and stimulated with 1 mg/ml of phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (TPA) and PTX or BC (100 - 1000 micrograms/ml). Levels of TNF-alpha, IL- 1 alpha, IL- 1 beta, IL- 8 and TGF-beta 1 using ELISA and Northern blot or RT-PCR techniques were measured. TPA-induced TNF-alpha and IL- 8 release from keratinocytes. TPA did not induce IL- 1 alpha or IL- 1 beta release of keratinocytes. TPA increased RNA expression of the TNF-alpha, IL- 1 alpha, IL- 1 beta, IL- 8 and TGF-beta 1. BC diminished TPA-induced TNF-alpha and IL- 8 release from keratinocytes; in the case of IL- 8 it is possible that this inhibition occur to transcriptional level. Moreover PTX was unable to inhibit TNF-alpha and IL- 8 synthesis and expression. PTX and BC reduced TPA-induced IL- 1 alpha and beta expression. It is possible that BC action is specifically exerted on keratinocytes, because we did not find similar results with TNF-alpha and IL- 8 synthesis in mononuclear peripheral blood cells...|$|E
40|$|Technological {{developments}} are driving {{in vitro methods}} towards integrated "omic" strategies. However, there is still an over reliance on classical viability assays for dose range finding. Such assays are not readily suited to the investigation of subtle alterations in cell function and most require termination of the experiment, which {{makes it difficult to}} monitor temporal alterations in repeat-dose long term exposure experiments. To this end, we investigated the use of lactate production as a marker of cell stress in long term repeat dose experiments. We conducted daily exposures to eight compounds at five concentrations for 14 days on human renal proximal tubular cells (RPTEC/TERT 1), human hepatoma cells (HepaRG) and mouse fibroblasts (BALB- 3 T 3) cells. Compounds were chosen from a training set used in the 7 th EU Framework project Predict-IV and consisted of amiodarone, diclofenac, troglitazone, cadmium chloride, cephaloridine, cidofovir, cyclosporine A and <b>buflomedil.</b> At days 1, 3, 7 and 14, lactate was measured in the supernatant medium. At day 14, cells were assayed for resazurin reduction capability and subsequently lysed in methanol for ATP determination. Compound-induced loss of viability was comparable across all cell lines. For all cell types, when cell viability was compromised at day 14, lactate production was induced during the treatment period. In some situations, lactate also fell below control values, indicating cell death. Thus, temporal alterations in supernatant lactate provides information on the time and concentration of stress induction and the time and concentration where cell death becomes the dominant factor. Supernatant lactate production is a simple, cheap and non-invasive parameter. Since many molecular pathways converge on the glycolytic pathway, enhanced lactate production may be considered as a global marker of sub-lethal injury and thus an ideal marker for investigating temporal alterations in long term repeat dose testing in vitro regimes...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} drug-excipient {{interactions}} has gradually {{evolved in the}} past years, in particular concerning drug-polymer interactions. Rather than considering a detrimental occurrence during the pharmaceutical development, nowadays, polymer-polymer and drug-polymer interactions are considered a new promising tool to control drug delivery with advantages in terms of drug-sustained release, linear kinetics and reduced sensitivity to the external environment. Ionic interactions are the most investigated at the moment, whereas hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions are basically an unexplored field. However, the comprehensive understanding of the specific role of non-covalent interactions in controlled drug release is still an ongoing process. The aim of the present research work was the comprehensive investigation {{of the role of}} non covalent interactions between drugs and polymer in oral controlled drug delivery with the aim to present a more systematic approach for the prediction of desired release profile, depending on the chemical functions and the interactions involved. Non-covalent interactions between a model drug, presenting basic characteristics, such as atenolol, and polymer, carrying different functional groups, namely chondroitin sulfate, chitosan, sodium alginate and λ-carrageenan were characterized by ATR-FT-IR and H 1 -NMR. The desorption electrospray high resolution mass spectrometry was used as innovative and fast method to evaluate the interaction between the molecules selected. In vitro drug release studies, carried out on matrix tablets consisting of atenolol and each polymer selected, revealed that only the ionic interaction occurring between atenolol and λ-carrageenan was suitable for controlled drug delivery. Drug release from this system was highly influenced by the concentration of potassium dihydrogen phosphate in the dissolution medium, affording more prolonged zero-order release profiles at higher ionic strength and faster delivery rates with super Case II kinetics at lower ionic strength. The evaluation of the front position of λ-carrageenan-atenolol matrices, as well as the study of hydration properties of the polymer by DSC, showed that the overall mechanism of release was controlled by mutual interactions polymer-drug-salt. The addition of acidic potassium salt to the λ-carrageenan-atenolol mixture prior compression was effective in determining a prolonged drug release, independently of the external environmental conditions. λ-carrageenan-salt mixture were also evaluated to afford controlled release of different basic drugs, such as methyl L-dopa and <b>buflomedil</b> pyridoxal phosphate, showing distinct release behaviours, probably related to different strength of interaction.

40|$|Selection of reversed-phase liquid {{chromatography}} (RP-LC) C 18 columns with suitable selectivity {{for a given}} analysis is difficult. The European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) and other official compendia provide only a general description of the stationary phase {{to be used in}} the operating procedure of an LC method. This information is often insufficient to select a suitable column from a market offering more than 600 brands. Manufacturers provide only limited information about their columns. The need for a general test method to characterize RP-LC columns has existed since the 1970 s. A project to define a suitable procedure characterizing RP-LC C 18 columns by chromatographic tests was started earlier in the Laboratory for Pharmaceutical Analysis. Different tests were collected from the literature. A procedure to measure 36 column parameters was applied, and the repeatability and reproducibility of the parameters were examined in three different laboratories. Of these 36 parameters, 24 were found to be reproducible. Subsequently, a classification of 69 RP-LC C 18 columns, based on these 24 parameters, was obtained by principal component analysis (PCA). However, the measurement of these 24 parameters was labour-intensive and time-consuming. Through additional studies and based on the found correlation, it was possible to reduce the number of column parameters from 24 to just 4. The four selected parameters were the retention factor of amylbenzene, k’amb (i. e. hydrophobicity), the relative retention factor of benzylamine/phenol determined at pH 2. 7, rk’ba/ph pH 2. 7 (i. e. silanol activity), the retention factor of 2, 2 ’-dipyridyl, k’ 2, 2 ’-dip (i. e. silanol activity and metal impurity) and the relative retention factor of triphenylene/o-terphenyl, rk’tri/o-ter (i. e. steric selectivity). These parameters can be determined using three simple, fast, repeatable and reproducible methods. The correlation between column classification, as obtained in the PCA plot, and column selectivity, as determined by the Ph. Eur. separation of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and its impurities, has been demonstrated. It was concluded that columns belonging to the same group showed similar selectivity for the separation of ASA and its impurities. Although a correlation was found, definition of column groups based on the PCA plot was difficult. Therefore, a more practical approach has been developed. This approach begins with the selection of a reference column (e. g. the column on which a method has been developed or a column mentioned in the literature) or a virtual, ideal column. Other columns are then ranked against this reference column, based on the aforementioned four column parameters. This approach has one obvious advantage; that is, the relationship between columns can be expressed using a single value (i. e. F-value). This system has been made freely available on-line on our website: [URL] This approach gave good results for 8 separations of pharmaceuticals (ASA, clindamycin hydrochloride, <b>buflomedil</b> hydrochloride, chloramphenicol sodium succinate, nimesulide, phenoxymethylpenicillin, dihydrostreptomycin sulphate and vancomycin). To evaluate the separations, the chromatographic response factor (CRF) was used, which is a measure of the overall separation. The relationship between the ranking of the columns and their separation performance was investigated. For all separations examined, it was observed that in 7 out of 8 separations, 100 % of these high ranked columns (F 6). Next, intrabatch variability was investigated and low variability was found. During these experiments, it was found that one of the parameters, k’ 2, 2 ’-dip, could not always be properly determined. It was sometimes observed that the 2, 2 ’-dipyridyl peak showed a poor peak shape, a high retention time or that it was not eluted at all. To solve this issue, a phosphate buffer of pH 6. 5 was added to the mobile phase and the determination of the dead volume by the retention time of uracil was simplified. Next, the influence of long term storage (about 15 months) and of use in {{liquid chromatography}} analyses, applied on 55 pairs (same batch) of different RP-LC columns, was studied. After long term storage, small changes of the column characteristics occur for most of the columns, producing slightly increased F-values. A few columns differed by a greater extent and showed considerable changes in silanol activity and hydrophobicity. Most of these columns have no end-capping and/or no base-deactivation, making these stationary phases more vulnerable towards degradation. This effect is observed less with columns with polar embedded groups and/or polar end-capping, protecting the column by blocking the silanol groups and attracting a shielding water layer. Also columns with higher coverages and bulky or long chains show more resistance towards degradation. It was concluded that changes in the stationary phases do occur and these changes are more important when the columns were used for separation instead of simply stored. Two separations (erythromycin and tetracycline), which were developed on a specific column, the XTerra RP, were also examined. The same approach was used as for the 8 separations above. Good results were obtained for erythromycin, while less good for tetracycline. The described column classification system has proven to be a helpful tool to find a suitable column in several separations, but it also has shown to be of more limited value in complex situations as the tetracycline separation. Finally, a comparison of our classification system with that of Euerby et al. was performed. Euerby et al. developed a column characterisation system, based on 6 test parameters, available as Column Selector from Advanced Chemistry Development (ACD) Labs. Comparison of the parameters led to a correlation between the parameters which claimed for the same column property. Principal component analysis showed that RP-LC C 18 columns were classified in a similar way by both systems. For 7 separations (fluoxetine, gemcitabine, erythromycin, tetracycline, tetracaine, amlodipine and bisacodyl), a ranking was build based on an F-value (K. U. Leuven method) or Column Difference Factor value (CDF, Euerby method) versus a (virtual) reference column. Both methods showed similar classification patterns. The coefficient of determination values, calculated for these rankings, were in the range 0. 64 to 0. 90. Therefore, it was concluded that the classification systems are quite similar and both can be helpful in the selection of a suitable column. From a practical point of view, it must be noted that the K. U. Leuven method only includes 4 parameters and 3 chromatographic methods compared to 6 parameters and 4 methods for the Euerby method. Hence, the time needed to determine the chromatographic properties of a column is shorter with the K. U. Leuven approach.
