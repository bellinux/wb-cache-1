5|$|One {{particularly}} infamous oceanic whitetip was {{implicated in}} several bites on tourists in the Red Sea near Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, in 2010. This oceanic whitetip was recognized individually by the bite mark {{taken out of}} its upper tail lobe. Accumulating evidence revealed this shark to have been conditioned to being hand fed. Upon associating the divers with an easy supply of food, it <b>bit</b> <b>the</b> divers and snorkelers where it had seen the fish being kept; fanny packs the divers carried. This caused the shark to target the divers' buttock and thigh regions {{in the hope of}} obtaining a meal. The 2010 Sharm El Sheikh bites resulted in one death and four injuries to humans. The attacks might have been instigated by the overfishing in that area of the Red Sea, effectively forcing the shark closer to shore where the bites took place.|$|E
5|$|The sketch {{became an}} instant cult classic hit among Star Trek and science fiction fans. The 1977 book Saturday Night Live edited by Anne Beatts and John Head {{included}} {{a copy of}} a note from Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry praising the comedic <b>bit.</b> <b>The</b> sketch was released on a 1985 Saturday Night Live compilation VHS that featured The Best of John Belushi, and re-released with the same title in DVD format in 2011. In his book Metapop author Michael Dunne called the comedic bit among the most well-known of all Saturday Night Live routines. The Chicago Sun-Times referred to it as an intelligent satire of Star Trek. The Los Angeles Times placed the parody among the program's top ten sketches of all-time. On the series' 40th anniversary, Tulsa World listed the sketch as one of the television show's most iconic.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} achieve the {{objectives}} stated in Section 3, we propose to weight <b>the</b> <b>bits</b> of <b>the</b> services according to <b>the</b> <b>bit</b> rate requirements of the services, and then maximize the weighted sum of <b>the</b> <b>bits.</b> <b>The</b> weight {{is referred to as}} <b>bit</b> value in <b>the</b> rest of this article. That is, we consider significantly higher <b>bit</b> values for <b>the</b> <b>bits</b> that have to be preferentially transmitted (i.e., <b>the</b> <b>bits</b> in <b>the</b> regular services or the BLs of <b>the</b> MBMSs) than <b>bit</b> values for <b>the</b> <b>bits</b> in <b>the</b> ELs of the MBMSs so <b>the</b> former <b>bits</b> are guaranteed to be transmitted. Also, we propose to set <b>the</b> <b>bit</b> values for <b>the</b> latter <b>bits</b> according to <b>the</b> <b>bit</b> rate–PSNR behaviors of the MGS packets (see Figure 2) so the average PSNR can be maximized. Then, the proposed resource allocation algorithm maximizes the total service quality, where each service quality is quantified as <b>the</b> total <b>bit</b> value (TBV) of each service. The resource allocator operates on the basis of convex optimization which requires the objective function to be concave.|$|R
5|$|What makes Yoshi's Island DS {{different}} is {{the addition of}} five babies for Yoshi to carry, each bestowing a different ability — Baby Mario allows Yoshi to dash and makes special 'M' blocks appear, and can grab Super Stars to become Super Baby Mario, and grants ricocheting eggs; Baby Peach allows Yoshi to float and fly on wind currents and grants a more forgiving timing to use Yoshi's flutter jumping abilities effectively; Baby Donkey Kong can grab and swing on vines and ropes, grants a special dash attack, allows Yoshi's eggs to explode as per Yoshi's Story (but they do so on impact) and allows Yoshi to push objects faster; Baby Wario uses his magnet to attract metal objects and allows Yoshi's eggs to bounce; and Baby Bowser spits fireballs, but the Yoshi carrying him cannot make eggs, though the eggs Yoshi already carries can bounce. The last three babies tend to make the timing for Yoshi's flutter jumping less forgiving and slow down his movement a little <b>bit.</b> <b>The</b> need to switch babies at key points adds a puzzle element to the game.|$|E
