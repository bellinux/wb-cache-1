5|$|Poole and Donovan {{had long}} {{wanted to make}} a sequel to <b>Boys</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sand. In 1984, they finally shot <b>Boys</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sand II. Also filmed on Fire Island, the film {{featured}} Donovan, the only cast member from the original to return. The original opening sequence, Bayside, was recreated for the sequel, with Pat Allen performing the run from the water. Litigation tied up the release of <b>Boys</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sand II until 1986 and {{with the advent of the}} home video market, there was a glut of gay porn titles available. <b>Boys</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sand II did not distinguish itself from the competition and was not particularly successful.|$|E

5|$|<b>Boys</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sand had its {{theatrical}} {{debut on}} December 29, 1971, at the 55th Street Playhouse in New York City. Poole {{engaged in an}} unprecedented pre-release publicity campaign, including screening parties and full-page ads in The New York Times and Variety.|$|E
5|$|<b>Boys</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sand is a {{landmark}} American gay pornographic film released {{at the very}} beginnings of the Golden Age of Porn. The 1971 film was directed by Wakefield Poole and stars Casey Donovan. <b>Boys</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sand was the first gay porn film to include credits, to achieve crossover success, to be reviewed by Variety, {{and one of the}} earliest porn films, after 1969's Blue Movie by Andy Warhol, to gain mainstream credibility, preceding 1972's Deep Throat by nearly a year.|$|E

5|$|Produced on {{a budget}} of $8,000, the film is a loose {{collection}} of three segments depicting Donovan's sexual adventures at a gay beach resort community. Promoted by Poole with an advertising campaign unprecedented for a pornographic feature, <b>Boys</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sand premiered in New York City in 1971 and was an immediate critical and commercial success. The film brought star Donovan international recognition. A sequel, <b>Boys</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sand II, was released in 1986 {{but was unable to}} match the success of the original.|$|E
5|$|Culver first {{appeared}} as Casey Donovan in <b>Boys</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sand, directed by Wakefield Poole, in 1971. The film {{was an instant}} success and {{is considered one of}} the great classics of male erotic cinema. With the success and celebrity he garnered from the film, Donovan believed that he would be able to cross over into mainstream film. While there were meetings with directors like John Schlesinger and Raymond St. Jacques and talk of casting him in mainstream projects including adaptations of novels by Mary Renault and Patricia Nell Warren, the only film opportunities opened for him were as the star of more erotic films. These included the bisexual porn film Score, The Back Row with George Payne, L. A. Tool & Die with Bob Blount and Richard Locke, The Other Side of Aspen with Al Parker and Dick Fisk, <b>Boys</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sand II and Inevitable Love, with Jon King and Jamie Wingo. Shortly before his death he starred, heavily intoxicated, in the fisting movie Fucked Up, for Christopher Rage. He also appeared in a number of heterosexual porn films, most notably The Opening of Misty Beethoven where he had a scene with Constance Money.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps {{because of}} the large income the Abbot was sustaining, Bishop Alnwick appears to have not taken strong {{measures}} against the Abbot's indiscretions. He ordered that the number of canons should be increased to 30 and the number of <b>boys</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> almonry increased to 16. The Bishop also ordered proper accounts to be kept and forbade the abbot from granting favours without the permission of both the Bishop and the Canons.|$|E

5|$|Arthur Rose Eldred (August 16, 1895 – January 4, 1951) was an American {{agricultural}} and railroad industry executive, civic leader, {{and the first}} Eagle Scout in the Boy Scouts of America (BSA). As a 16-year-old candidate for the highest rank bestowed by the BSA, he was personally interviewed by a panel composed of the youth organization's founding luminaries, including Ernest Thompson Seton and Daniel Carter Beard. Eldred was awarded the coveted distinction of Eagle Scout on September 2, 1912, becoming the first {{of more than two}} million <b>boys</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S. since then to earn Scouting's most vaunted rank. Eldred also received the Bronze Honor Medal for lifesaving, and was the first of four generations of Eagle Scouts in his family.|$|E
5|$|As {{predicted}} {{through the}} actions of the <b>boys</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film, there were numerous news reports of underage South Park fans engaging in unsuccessful attempts to gain entrance to the film at theaters. There were reports of adolescents purchasing tickets for WB's own Wild Wild West and instead sitting in to see South Park. This came {{as a result of a}} movie-industry crackdown that would make it tougher for children to sneak into R-rated films, as proposed by President Bill Clinton at the time in response to the moral panic generated by the Columbine High School massacre, which occurred two months before the film's release. South Park was cited, along with American Pie, as an explicit film released in the summer of 1999 tempting teens to sneak into theaters. When the film was released in the United Kingdom in August 1999, there were similar reports of the film drawing an underage crowd.|$|E
5|$|Football is {{a popular}} {{participatory}} sport among youth. One of the earliest youth football organizations was founded in Philadelphia, in 1929, as the Junior Football Conference. Organizer Joe Tomlin started the league to provide activities and guidance for teenage boys who were vandalizing the factory he owned. The original four-team league expanded to sixteen teams in 1933 when Pop Warner, {{who had just been}} hired as the new coach of the Temple University football team, agreed to give a lecture to the <b>boys</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> league. In his honor, the league was renamed the Pop Warner Conference.|$|E

5|$|In 1965, Robert McSpadden and Bill Dickinson, both music {{teachers}} in the Cincinnati Public Schools, founded the Cincinnati All-City Boy Choir, where they were struck by how the discipline they established for the <b>boys</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> choir carried over into their academic studies. They conceived {{the idea of a}} school where basic education was combined with intensive attention to children with artistic talents. With the support of Waldrip and Tom Murray, director for the west-central division of Cincinnati elementary schools, they pushed for $119,000 as part of a tax levy referendum in May 1973; the measure was defeated. The school was approved with a drastically reduced budget of $27,000 plus $9,850 from the Board of Education’s general fund. They turned to private funding and won a $292,000 grant from J. Ralph Corbett, one of the city's foremost philanthropists for the arts, and $24,500 for a piano lab from the Baldwin Piano Company, which had manufactured pianos in Cincinnati since 1891.|$|E

5|$|On June 22, Allen and Seth Warner {{appeared}} before Congress in Philadelphia, where they {{argued for the}} inclusion of the Green Mountain <b>Boys</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Continental Army. After deliberation, Congress directed General Philip Schuyler, who had been appointed to lead the Army's Northern Department, to work with New York's provincial government to establish (and pay for) a regiment consisting of the Boys, and that they be paid Army rates for their service at Ticonderoga. On July 4, Allen and Warner made their case to New York's Provincial Congress, which, {{despite the fact that the}} Royal Governor had placed a price on their heads, agreed to the formation of a regiment. Following a brief visit to their families, they returned to Bennington to spread the news. Allen went to Ticonderoga to join Schuyler, while Warner and others raised the regiment.|$|E
