40|$|Measuring the {{electrical}} activity of large and defined populations of cells {{is currently a}} major technical challenge to electrophysiology, especially in the picoampere-range. For this purpose, we developed and applied a <b>bidirectional</b> <b>transducer</b> based on a chip with interdigitated gold electrodes to record {{the electrical}} response of cultured glioma cells. Recent research determined that also non-neural brain glia cells are electrically active and excitable. Their transformed counterparts, e. g. glioma cells, were suggested to partially retain these electric features. Such electrophysiological studies however are usually performed on individual cells and are limited in their predictive power for the overall electrical activity of the multicellular tumour bulk. Our extremely low-noise measuring system allowed us to detect not only prominent electrical bursts of neuronal cells but also minute, yet constantly occurring and functional, membrane capacitive current oscillations across large populations of C 6 glioma cells, which we termed electric current noise. At the same time, tumour cells of non-brain origin (HeLa) proved to be electrically quiescent in comparison. Finally, we determined that the glioma cell activity is primarily caused by the opening of voltage-gated Na+ and K+ ion channels and can be efficiently abolished using specific pharmacological inhibitors. Thus, we offer here a unique approach for studying electrophysiological properties of large cancer cell populations as an in vitro reference for tumour bulks in vivo...|$|E
50|$|<b>Bidirectional</b> <b>transducers</b> convert {{physical}} phenomena to electrical {{signals and}} also convert electrical signals into physical phenomena. Examples of inherently <b>bidirectional</b> <b>transducers</b> are antennae, which can convert conducted electrical signals {{to or from}} propagating electromagnetic waves, and voice coils, which convert electrical signals into sound (when used in a loudspeaker) or sound into electrical signals (when used in a microphone). Likewise, DC electric motors {{may be used to}} generate electrical power if the motor shaft is turned by an external torque.|$|R
40|$|Advances in {{material}} science and miniaturization of electromechanical devices are liberating {{the surface of}} the embedded device from its rigid shell. These new modes of dynamic expression have to be coupled with sensing capabilities in order to create comprehensible interactions. This thesis explores the space of augmented materials that are <b>bidirectional</b> <b>transducers,</b> called radical elements. We present currently available radical elements that facilitate embodied interactions through sensing and actuation methods on the same modality. To exemplify how a radical element can be fabricated with simple materials, we present a thin film shape-changing composite uniMorph. It is based on a flexible circuit composite that is able to actuate its own shape by combining the thermo- electric characteristics of copper with the high thermal expansion rate of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene. Finally, a taxonomy for augmented materials is presented that explores how new material capabilities can extend the perceived behavior of materials in the context of microinteractions. This thesis concludes with a survey of tangible interface projects in the design space of radical element enabled augmented materials. by Felix Heibeck. Thesis: S.

40|$|Low-frequency {{synthesizer}} {{developed to}} provide low-frequency waveform by synthesis from high-frequency power system. Waveform assembled by allowing conduction of discrete half cycles of high-frequency carrier. Frequency of synthesized wave controlled by pulse pattern. By controlling relationship between slip and stator frequencies, one operates induction motor either as motor or generator. Such <b>bidirectional</b> energy <b>transducer</b> used as starter/generator for engine, or as servo-mechanism {{for control of}} acceleration and deceleration. Other advantages include operation under controlled voltage-to-frequency ratios to maintain high-efficiency and high power factor, and no reflection of low-frequency noise into 20 -kHz distribution bus...|$|R
