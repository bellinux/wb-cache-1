5|$|Toxic <b>blue-green</b> <b>algae</b> blooms are a {{reasonably}} common occurrence in the lake. Warnings about coming {{into contact with}} the water are released when an algal bloom is detected. Attempts are being made to limit the amount of phosphates entering the lake in the hope of improving its water quality. <b>Blue-green</b> <b>algae</b> (more correctly cyanobacteria) produce toxins, which can be harmful for humans and any other animals that come in contact with the contaminated water. There have been several cases of dogs being affected after playing in and drinking the lake water.|$|E
5|$|Salinity {{differences}} between the sections of the lake separated by the railroad causeway result in significantly different biota. A phytoplankton community dominated by green algae or cyanobacteria (<b>blue-green</b> <b>algae)</b> tint the water south of the causeway a greenish color. North of the causeway, the lake is dominated by Dunaliella salina, a species of algae which releases beta-carotene, and the bacteria-like haloarchaea, which together give the water an unusual reddish or purplish color, and the bacteria converts non-toxic mercury into toxic methyl mercury, which then flows into the Southern portion of the lake in a heavy brine layer through the causeway.|$|E
5|$|It is {{estimated}} that there are about 1031 viruses on Earth. Most of them are bacteriophages, and most are in the oceans. Microorganisms constitute more than 90 per cent of the biomass in the sea, {{and it has been}} estimated that viruses kill approximately 20 per cent of this biomass each day and that there are fifteen times as many viruses in the oceans as there are bacteria and archaea. Viruses are the main agents responsible for the rapid destruction of harmful algal blooms, which often kill other marine life, and help maintain the ecological balance of different species of marine <b>blue-green</b> <b>algae,</b> and thus adequate oxygen production for life on Earth.|$|E

5|$|The {{rocks in}} Glacier National Park {{are the best}} {{preserved}} Proterozoic sedimentary rocks in the world, {{with some of the}} world's most fruitful sources for records of early life. Sedimentary rocks of similar age located in other regions have been greatly altered by mountain building and other metamorphic changes; consequently fossils are less common and more difficult to observe. The rocks in the park preserve such features as millimeter-scale lamination, ripple marks, mud cracks, salt-crystal casts, raindrop impressions, oolites, and other sedimentary bedding characteristics. Six fossilized species of Stromatolites, early organisms consisting of primarily <b>blue-green</b> <b>algae,</b> have been documented and dated at about 1billion years. The discovery of the Appekunny Formation, a well preserved rock stratum in the park, pushed back the established date for the origination of animal life a full billion years. This rock formation has bedding structures which are believed to be the remains of the earliest identified metazoan (animal) life on Earth.|$|E
25|$|Agricultural {{and urban}} runoff from the {{watershed}} or drainage basin {{is the primary}} source of excess phosphorus, which exacerbates algae blooms in Lake Champlain. The most problematic blooms have been cyanobacteria, commonly called <b>blue-green</b> <b>algae,</b> in the northeastern part of the Lake, primarily Missisquoi Bay.|$|E
25|$|A {{study done}} by Ethan I. Lan and James C. Liao {{attempted}} {{to utilize the}} ATP produced during photosynthesis in <b>blue-green</b> <b>algae</b> to work around the thermodynamically unfavorable acetyl-CoA condensation to acetoacetyl-CoA. The native system was re-engineered to have acetyl-CoA react with ATP and CO2 to form an intermediate, malonyl-CoA. Malonyl-CoA then reacts with another acetyl-CoA to form the desired acetoacetyl-CoA. The energy release from ATP hydrolysis (dG = -7.3 kcal/mol) makes this pathway significantly more favorable than standard condensation. Because <b>blue-green</b> <b>algae</b> generate NADPH during photosynthesis, it can be assumed that the cofactor environment is NADPH rich. Therefore, the native reaction pathway was further engineered to use NADPH rather than the standard NADH. All of these adjustments led to a 4-fold increase in butanol production, showing the importance of ATP and cofactor driving forces as a design principle in pathway engineering.|$|E
50|$|Years later, in 1994, {{local people}} of Hawaii, Maui and Oahu island in Hawaii were {{poisoned}} by food. The local residents of these islands often eat {{various types of}} algae including the red alga Gracilaria coronopifolia. After taking samples of this red alga {{it turned out that}} they contained two toxins which were identical with aplysiatoxin and debromoaplysiatoxin. Moreover, they observed parasitism of a <b>blue-green</b> <b>alga</b> on the surface of G. coronopifolia. In {{view of the fact that}} some <b>blue-green</b> <b>alga</b> like L. majuscula produce aplysiatoxin and debromoaplysiatoxin, itâ€™s probable that they are the true origin of this food poisoning case.|$|R
50|$|Debromoaplysiatoxin is a {{toxic agent}} {{produced}} by the <b>blue-green</b> <b>alga</b> Lyngbya majuscula. This alga lives in marine waters and causes seaweed dermatitis. Furthermore, it is a tumor promoter which has an anti-proliferative activity against various cancer cell lines in mice.|$|R
40|$|Methods are {{described}} for preparation of pulse-labeled ribonucleic acid (RNA) from the <b>blue-green</b> <b>alga</b> Anacystis nidulans. Synthesis of labeled RNA {{was found to}} be in part dependent on concurrent photosynthesis and was inhibited by the antibiotic streptolydigin. Mature 23 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) appeared before mature 16 S rRNA. Formation of either molecule was inhibited by chloramphenicol, and RNA species of lesser mobility accumulated. These species may be precursors of the mature forms. Maturation of 16 S rRNA was also inhibited by streptolydigin. (The effect of this antibiotic on 23 S rRNA maturation was not examined). In many respects, ribosomal RNA synthesis and maturation in this <b>blue-green</b> <b>alga</b> appear to follow the pattern already established for bacteria...|$|R
25|$|In January 2012, Alberta Environment and Sustainable Resource Development {{received}} a complaint about land being cleared and stripped near Fallis. An investigation revealed that trees {{adjacent to the}} lakeshore had been removed risking significant erosion of sediment into the lake. Uncontrolled erosion can {{increase the risk of}} eutrophication in lakes, which in turn can result in the formation of <b>blue-green</b> <b>algae</b> blooms.|$|E
25|$|Wastewater {{may contain}} {{high levels of}} the {{nutrients}} nitrogen and phosphorus. Excessive release to the environment {{can lead to a}} buildup of nutrients, called eutrophication, which can in turn encourage the overgrowth of weeds, algae, and cyanobacteria (<b>blue-green</b> <b>algae).</b> This may cause an algal bloom, a rapid growth in the population of algae. The algae numbers are unsustainable and eventually most of them die. The decomposition of the algae by bacteria uses up so much of the oxygen in the water that most or all of the animals die, which creates more organic matter for the bacteria to decompose. In addition to causing deoxygenation, some algal species produce toxins that contaminate drinking water supplies. Different treatment processes are required to remove nitrogen and phosphorus.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} lines of {{evidence}} that support endosymbiosis theory. Mitochondria and chloroplasts contain their own small supply of DNA, which may be remnants of the genome the organelles had when they were independent aerobic bacteria. The single most convincing evidence of the descent of organelles from bacteria is the position of mitochondria and plastid DNA sequences in phylogenetic trees of bacteria. Mitochondria have sequences that clearly indicate origin {{from a group of}} bacteria called the alphaproteobacteria. Plastids have DNA sequences that indicate origin from the cyanobacteria (<b>blue-green</b> <b>algae).</b> In addition, there are organisms alive today, called living intermediates, that are in a similar endosymbiotic condition to the prokaryotic cells and the aerobic bacteria. Living intermediates show that the evolution proposed by the endosymbiont theory is possible. For example, the giant amoeba Pelomyxa lacks mitochondria but has aerobic bacteria that carry out a similar role. A variety of corals, clams, snails, and one species of Paramecium permanently host algae in their cells. Many of the insect endosymbionts have been shown to have ancient associations with their hosts, involving strictly vertical inheritance. In addition, these insect symbionts have similar patterns of genome evolution to those found in true organelles: genome reduction, rapid rates of gene evolution, and bias in nucleotide base composition favoring adenine and thymine, at the expense of guanine and cytosine.|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} computer-based {{mathematical model}} of photophobic {{responses in the}} <b>blue-green</b> <b>alga,</b> Phormidium uncinatum, {{has been used to}} simulate the behavior of the alga under various light and dark conditions. Under high light intensities, the model predicts the induction of step-up phobic responses. This novel result could be varified exper-imentally in vivo. Appropriate features have been incorporated to simulate the effects of ionophores and the application of external electrical fields; results of the computer simulation and in vivo experiments are compared. Several parameters of the model have been varied to specify the range in which phobic responses are permitted. These para-meters allow conclusions to be drawn on the functional correlates in the living organism.

50|$|In 1980 {{there was}} a new {{outbreak}} of seaweed dermatitis on Oahu island Hawaii. Samples of L. majuscula revealed that this <b>blue-green</b> <b>alga</b> contained a mixture of aplysiatoxin, debromoaplysiatoxin and lyngbyatoxin A. These three substances appeared to be the causative toxins of seaweed dermatitis.|$|R
25|$|The {{formation}} {{begins as}} tidal flats gain elevation relative to sea level by sediment accretion, and subsequently the rate {{and duration of}} tidal flooding decreases so that vegetation can colonize on the exposed surface. The arrival of propagules of pioneer species such as seeds or rhizome portions are combined {{with the development of}} suitable conditions for their germination and establishment in the process of colonisation. When rivers and streams arrive at the low gradient of the tidal flats, the discharge rate reduces and suspended sediment settles onto the tidal flat surface, helped by the backwater effect of the rising tide. Mats of filamentous <b>blue-green</b> <b>algae</b> can fix silt and clay sized sediment particles to their sticky sheaths on contact which can also increase the erosion resistance of the sediments. This assists the process of sediment accretion to allow colonising species (e.g.,Salicornia spp.) to grow. These species retain sediment washed in from the rising tide around their stems and leaves and form low muddy mounds which eventually coalesce to form depositional terraces, whose upward growth is aided by a sub-surface root network which binds the sediment. Once vegetation is established on depositional terraces further sediment trapping and accretion can allow rapid upward growth of the marsh surface such that there is an associated rapid decrease in the depth and duration of tidal flooding. As a result, competitive species that prefer higher elevations relative to sea level can inhabit the area and often a succession of plant communities develops.|$|E
500|$|The Human Genome Project has {{revealed}} {{the presence of}} numerous viral DNA sequences scattered throughout [...] the human genome.

These pieces of DNA have firmly established themselves in human DNA. Most of this DNA is no longer functional, but some of these friendly viruses have brought with them novel genes that are important in human development. Viruses have transferred important genes to plants. About ten per cent of all photosynthesis uses the products of genes that have been transferred to plants from <b>blue-green</b> <b>algae</b> by viruses.|$|E
500|$|The United States has two {{significant}} oil-shale deposits which are suited for commercial development {{due to their}} size, grade and location. The Eocene Green River Formation covers parts of Colorado, Wyoming and Utah; the second significant deposit is Devonian oil shales in the eastern United States. In both places, there are sub-basins varying in volume {{and quality of the}} reserves. Oil shale in the Green River Formation is found in five sedimentary basins namely, Green River, Uinta, Piceance Creek, Sand Wash and Washakie. The first three have undergone some significant exploration and attempts to commercialize the oil shale reserves since the 1960s. The Green River Formation includes deposits from two large lakes which covered an area of over [...] during early to middle Eocene period. These lakes were separated by the Uinta uplift and the Axial Basin anticline. For significant periods during their 10Ma life, the lakes became closed systems allowing many changes in size, salinity and sediment deposition. Oil shale is a result of abundant <b>blue-green</b> <b>algae</b> that thrived in the lakes.|$|E

Moreover, commercial fishermen have recorded greatly reduced catches in Nodularia-affected areas and dead fish and crabs were found in regions where Nodularia was very dense.
