Semi-algebraic sets of R^k {{are defined as}} the smallest family of sets in R^k that contains the algebraic sets {{as well as the}} sets defined by polynomial inequalities, and which is also closed under the <b>boolean</b> operations (<b>complementation,</b> finite unions and finite intersections). We prove new bounds on the topological complexity of semi-algebraic sets over a real closed field R defined by quadratic polynomials, in terms of the parameters of the system of polynomials defining them, which improve the known results.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{complexity}} of sets formed by <b>boolean</b> operations (,, and <b>complementation)</b> on NP sets. These are the sets accepted by trees of hardware with NP predicates as leaves, and together form the boolean hierarchy. We present many results about the boolean hierarchy: separation and immunity results, complete languages, upward separations, connections to sparse oracles for NP, and structural asymmetries between complementary classes. Some results present new ideas and techniques. Others put previous results about NP and D^P in a richer perspective. Throughout, we emphasize {{the structure of the}} boolean hierarchy and its relations with more common classes...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBoolean {{rings and}} Boolean algebras, though {{historically}} and conceptually different, were shown by Stone to be equationally interdefinable. Indeed, in a Boolean ring, addition {{can be defined}} in terms of the ring multiplication and the successor operation (<b>Boolean</b> <b>complementation)</b> xΛ= 1 + x (= 1 − x). In this paper, it is shown that this type of equational definability of addition also holds in a much wider class of rings, namely, any ring R with unity, not necessarily commutative, which satisfies the identity xn = xn+ 1 f(x) where n is a fixed positive integer and f(x) is a fixed polynomial with integer coefficients. This class, of course, contains all finite rings with unity. As a corollary it is shown that if S ⊆ R and 1 ϵ S, and if along with a, b ϵ S, ab ϵ S and a + 1 ϵ S, then S is a subring of R...|$|E
40|$|For a {{complete}} lattice L and a relational structure X=(X,(R_i) _I), we introduce the convolution algebra L^X. This algebra {{consists of the}} lattice L^X equipped with an additional n_i-ary operation f_i for each n_i+ 1 -ary relation R_i of X. For α_ 1, [...] .,α_n_i∈ L^X and x∈ X we set f_i(α_ 1, [...] .,α_n_i) (x) ={α_ 1 (x_ 1) ∧ [...] . ∧α_n_i(x_n_i) :(x_ 1, [...] .,x_n_i,x) ∈ R_i}. For the 2 -element lattice 2, 2 ^X is the reduct of the familiar complex algebra X^+ obtained by removing <b>Boolean</b> <b>complementation</b> from the signature. It is shown that this construction is bifunctorial and behaves well with respect to one-one and onto maps and with respect to products. When L is the reduct of {{a complete}} Heyting algebra, the operations of L^X are completely additive in each coordinate and L^X is in the variety generated by 2 ^X. Extensions to the construction are made to allow for completely multiplicative operations defined through meets instead of joins, as well as modifications to allow for convolutions of relational structures with partial orderings. Several examples are given...|$|E

Semi-algebraic sets of R^k {{are defined as}} the smallest family of sets in R^k that contains the algebraic sets {{as well as the}} sets defined by polynomial inequalities, and which is also closed under the <b>boolean</b> operations (<b>complementation,</b> finite unions and finite intersections). We prove new bounds on the Betti numbers {{as well as on the}} number of different stable homotopy types of certain fibers of semi-algebraic sets over a real closed field R defined by quadratic polynomials, in terms of the parameters of the system of polynomials defining them, which improve the known results. We conclude the thesis with presenting two new algorithms along with their implementations. The first algorithm computes the number of connected components and the first Betti number of a semi-algebraic set defined by compact objects in R^k which are simply connected. This algorithm improves the well-know method using a triangulation of the semi-algebraic set. Moreover, the algorithm has been efficiently implemented which was not possible before. The second algorithm computes efficiently the real intersection of three quadratic surfaces in R^ 3 using a semi-numerical approach. Comment: PhD thesis, final version, 109 pages, 9 figure...|$|R
