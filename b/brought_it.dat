One chronicle tells of how four shoemakers <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> to Warwick, who refused to accept it, and ordered them to take it back outside his jurisdiction.

In 1823, a cross with inscription was erected at Blacklow Hill by local squire, Bertie Greathead, at the place believed to be the location of Gaveston's execution.|$|E
