500|$|The man is {{positioned}} within an undefined narrow space and {{set against a}} flat black background. Typically for vanEyck, the head is large {{in relation to the}} torso. He is dressed in typically Burgundian fashion, with a red robe and a green wool chaperon with a <b>bourrelet</b> and cornette hanging forward. The headdress is trimmed with fur, fastened with two buttons, and extends to the parapet. His right hand might be holding the end of the cornette. Neither the shape of his head nor his facial features correspond to contemporary standard types, let alone canons of ideal beauty. The sitter appears to be bald, although there are some faint traces of fair hair, leading Erwin Panofsky to conclude that his [...] "countenance is as 'Nordic' as his dress is Burgundian." [...] Though he has neither eyebrows nor stubble, he does have eyelashes that are believed to have been added by a 19th-century restorer. Van Eyck's cool observation of the man's narrow shoulders, pursed lips, and thin eyebrows extends to detailing the moisture on his blue eyes.|$|E
5000|$|The cornette now {{stretched}} {{nearly to}} the ground, and the patte had also grown slightly; both were now plain and undecorated by cutting or dagging at the edges. <b>Bourrelets</b> could be very large, or quite modest; some were clearly made round a hollow framework (a drawing survives of an Italian block for making them). The largest <b>bourrelets</b> are worn by very high ranking men around 1445-50. Sometimes {{they seem to be}} just a ring (the doughnut analogy is hard to resist) with an open centre, and sometimes the opening seems to be at least partly covered with fixed cloth. Because the <b>bourrelets</b> were usually the same shape all the way round, several different parts of it could be worn facing forward. Probably for this reason, chaperons are rarely seen adorned by badges or jewellery. There were now many ways of wearing, and indeed carrying, this most complex and adaptable of hats: ...|$|R

50|$|Fixed crescentic dunes {{that form}} on the leeward margins of playas and river valleys in arid and {{semiarid}} regions {{in response to the}} direction(s) of prevailing winds, are known as lunettes, source-bordering dunes, <b>bourrelets</b> and clay dunes. They may be composed of clay, silt, sand, or gypsum, eroded from the basin floor or shore, transported up the concave side of the dune, and deposited on the convex side. Examples in Australia are up to 6.5 km long, 1 km wide, and up to 50 metres high. They also occur in southern and West Africa, and in parts of the western United States, especially Texas.|$|R
40|$|Conclusion : the {{mechanisms}} of uplift. In the most cases (excepting northern Ghats and perhaps south african bulge), {{the mechanisms}} of uplift will be sought into light infracrustal roots, proceeding either directly from heating, either from transformation of ec/ogites into gabbros. The models {{must take into account}} the rythm of uplift, as registered by geomorphological-geological research. Some mechanisms of uplift of the bulges have been discussed. M. F. André suggests that asthenosphere is pushed beneath the continental bulge by subsidence of the dead cooling Labrador dorsal. Y. Battiau-Queney invokes the excess of lithostatic preasure in the new oceanic lithosphere respect to the continental one. P. Birot tests a model where the light roots of the bulges result from the thermal thinning of continental lithosphère «eaten» by warmer asthenosphere. But the process probably exceeds the imparted geological time. Better achievement is obtained by the model of Mlle Fleitout where the heating of the cold continental lower lithosphere proceeds from its replacing by advection of infra-oceanic matter.

40|$|Abstract. - From Namibie to Congo, {{the western}} african bulge was first uplifted before the Aptian. But major flexuration was emplaced between upper Cretaceous and Pliocene. Angola {{is well known}} for his {{wonderful}} stepped planation surface : the highest is attribued to late Cretaceous, the intermediary one to Miocene, and the lowest to Pliocene. In Congo and Namibie, the succession of events is significantly different. In Transvaal and Namibie, a giant flexure affects a volcanic serie ending with basalts of lower Jurassic age. Tentatively the Highveld planation surface cutting across kimberlite pipes is attribued to late Cretaceous or Paleocene. The lowest step (Lowveld) appears related to the neogene accumulation. An intermediary surface cuts across the crystalline northern scarp and the top of the Lebombo Ridge. The best studied area of the Western Ghats consists of subhorizontal traps of paleocene age. Neither upper post-trappean planation surface, neither important lower steps were identified. The dissymetric bulge is supported by a thickened crust. Proved post-trappean faults are restricted to the shelf. But the thickest neogene sediments are chiefly tilted oceanwards.

2500|$|By {{the middle}} of the 15th century the evolved {{chaperon}} (worn on top of the head, with <b>bourrelet)</b> had become common wear for males in the upper and middle classes, and were worn in painted portraits, including those of the Dukes of Burgundy. [...] The amount of cloth involved had become considerable, and although chaperons seem to have normally been of a single colour at this period, a silk or damask one would have been a conspicuous sign of affluence. A Florentine chaperon of 1515 is recorded as using sixteen bracchia of cloth, over ten yards (9 metres).|$|E
2500|$|F) {{when the}} {{chaperon}} {{needed to be}} removed, in warm weather, or {{in the presence of}} a person much higher in rank (and, usually, in church) it could be put over the shoulder with the patte and cornette hanging on opposite sides, or round the shoulders. [...] Which came forward and which went back varies considerably, but more often the <b>bourrelet</b> went behind. [...] Possibly the chaperon was secured to the shoulder, as the assemblage often looks rather precarious. [...] Donor figures in religious paintings always wear their chaperons in this way, as they are figuratively in the presence of the saints or the Madonna.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Just Judges" [...] {{may contain}} portraits of Jan and Hubert {{as the third}} and fourth Judges on horseback. The {{evidence}} based on the similarity of one of the figures to Jan's 1433 Portrait of a Man, generally thought to be a self-portrait. The second, closer, figure is thought to be Hubert, because of facial similarity to Jan. Although the judge in the Ghent panel appears to be younger than the sitter in the London painting, they wear similar chaperons with the cornette tightly bound around the <b>bourrelet.</b> The judges in the Ghent panel became the basis for a number of later portraits of the brothers, including that of Dominicus Lampsonius.|$|E
2500|$|By about 1480 the {{chaperon}} was ceasing to be fashionable, {{but continued}} to be worn. [...] The size of the <b>bourrelet</b> was reduced, and the patte undecorated. [...] St Joseph could, by this stage, often be seen with the evolved form. By 1500 the evolved chaperon was definitely outmoded in Northern Europe, but the original hood form still remained a useful headgear for shepherds and peasants. [...] By this time the evolved chaperon had become fixed in some forms of civilian uniforms for lawyers, academics {{and the members of}} some knightly orders. In these uses it gradually shrank in size and often became permanently attached to the clothing underneath, effectively just as an ornament. [...] In Italy it remained more current, more as a dignified form of headgear for older men, until about the 1520s.|$|E
2500|$|The only {{surviving}} manuscript miniature by Rogier van der Weyden shows Philip the Good {{wearing a}} chaperon in style B. Next to him stands Chancellor Nicolas Rolin, using a less exuberant version of style B; only he has sufficient status to wear his chaperon indoors in the Duke's presence. Apart from the Bishop of Tournai, next to Rolin, {{all the other}} men are bare-headed, even Philip's young heir, {{despite the fact that}} several of them are high-ranking intimates who, like the Duke, wear the collar of the Order of the Golden Fleece. But as far as can be seen, all have hats. [...] The man in grey seems to be carrying another sort of hat, but all the other ones visible are chaperons worn in style F, mostly with the cornettes to the front. The young Charles the Bold has his patte wrapped round the back of his neck, and the man on the extreme right has his <b>bourrelet</b> further than usual down his back, with the patte hanging down from it. Most of the chaperons are black, although the man in blue has one in salmon-pink; black was having one of its earliest periods of being the most fashionable colour at the time.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bourrelet</b> {{bearing surface}} {{generally}} has a longitudinal width of about one-sixth caliber machined {{with a smooth}} surface to reduce friction wear of the rifling lands. If the <b>bourrelet</b> diameter is not a close fit, the in-bore yaw angle will affect the stability of a projectile during flight. However, excessive pressures may be generated within an artillery barrel attempting to fire a cast steel projectile with a <b>bourrelet</b> diameter lacking clearance to pass irregularities within the artillery barrel. The distance between the <b>bourrelet</b> and the rotating or driving band is typically at least one bore diameter to prevent wobbling, and greater distances reduce perpendicular force required for equivalent alignment.|$|E

50|$|The <b>bourrelet</b> is {{the portion}} of an {{elongated}} artillery projectile having a very slightly smaller diameter than the interior diameter of the barrel through which that projectile is to be propelled. The <b>bourrelet</b> is typically precisely machined to a specified diameter after {{the remainder of the}} cast projectile body has been roughly machined to a smaller diameter. The <b>bourrelet</b> is normally forward of a rotating band or driving band near the aft end of the projectile. The rotating or driving band is customarily made of a softer metal than the remainder of the artillery projectile and of a larger diameter than the <b>bourrelet</b> to seal the barrel and be engraved by the rifling to spin-stabilize the projectile in flight. The <b>bourrelet</b> is not engraved by the rifling, but is supported by the lands between the rifling to align the long axis of the projectile with the axis of the artillery bore.|$|E
50|$|The {{shell is}} stabilised for yaw in the barrel by a <b>bourrelet</b> band nearer {{the front of}} the projectile. The <b>bourrelet</b> is {{slightly}} smaller than the driving band, it does not engage with the rifling and serves only to keep the projectile travelling straight in the bore.|$|E
