5|$|Bulgaria's {{relations}} with the Russian Federation are currently on a good or fair level. Both countries have had centuries-long interactions, sharing a common heritage. The Cyrillic alphabet originated during 9th century and it was created by Clement and Naum, who were the students of Cyril and Methodius, which later accepted the Orthodox Slavic countries as their standard letter. Relations between Russia and <b>Bulgaria</b> have dated {{back as far as}} the 19th century. Both nations had the tradition of calling monarchs tsars, a Slavic word for caesar or emperor. The Russian Empire was the first country to recognize <b>Bulgaria,</b> and greatly helped <b>Bulgaria</b> in its war of independence from Ottoman Empire in 1908. During the Cold War, <b>Bulgaria</b> became an ally of the Soviet Union as a satellite state. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, relations between <b>Bulgaria</b> and Russia still share many different opinions, such as the two World Wars when <b>Bulgaria</b> both joined German side against Russia, and the problem over the history.|$|E

5|$|Sviatoslav's {{invasion}} of <b>Bulgaria</b> {{refers to a}} conflict beginning in 967/968 and ending in 971, {{carried out in the}} eastern Balkans, and involving the Kievan Rus', <b>Bulgaria,</b> and the Byzantine Empire. The Byzantines encouraged the Rus' ruler Sviatoslav to attack <b>Bulgaria,</b> leading to the defeat of the Bulgarian forces and the occupation of the northern and north-eastern part of the country by the Rus' for the following two years. The allies then turned against each other, and the ensuing military confrontation ended with a Byzantine victory. The Rus' withdrew and eastern <b>Bulgaria</b> was incorporated into the Byzantine Empire.|$|E

5|$|A Bulgarian nobleman, Despot Jacob Svetoslav sought {{assistance}} from Stephen after his domains, which were {{situated in the}} regions south of Vidin, were overrun by Byzantine troops {{in the second half}} of 1263. Stephen sent reinforcements under the command of Ladislaus II Kán, Voivode of Transylvania to <b>Bulgaria.</b> The Voivode routed the Byzantines and drove them out of <b>Bulgaria.</b> Stephen granted Vidin to Jacob Svetoslav who accepted his suzerainty.|$|E
5|$|A great {{imperial}} expedition under Leo Phocas and Romanos I Lekapenos {{ended with}} another crushing Byzantine defeat at the Battle of Achelous in 917, {{and the following}} year the Bulgarians were free to ravage northern Greece. Adrianople was plundered again in 923, and a Bulgarian army laid siege to Constantinople in 924. Simeon died suddenly in 927, however, and Bulgarian power collapsed with him. <b>Bulgaria</b> and Byzantium entered {{a long period of}} peaceful relations, and the Empire was now free to concentrate on the eastern front against the Muslims. In 968, <b>Bulgaria</b> was overrun by the Rus' under Sviatoslav I of Kiev, but three years later, John I Tzimiskes defeated the Rus' and re-incorporated Eastern <b>Bulgaria</b> into the Byzantine Empire.|$|E

50|$|Emperor Michael III was displeased by <b>Bulgaria's</b> {{banishment}} of Byzantium's clergy. In {{a letter}} to Prince Boris, the Byzantine emperor expressed his disapproval of <b>Bulgaria's</b> religious reorientation by using offensive language against the Roman Church. This sparked the old rivalry between the two branches of Christianity. In less than two years, <b>Bulgaria's</b> name became widely known in Western Europe.|$|R
50|$|Oil {{exploration}} {{is ongoing}} offshore in the Black Sea (the Shabla block) {{and on the}} Romanian border, but <b>Bulgaria’s</b> chief oil income is likely to come as a transfer point on east-west and north-south transit lines. Burgas is <b>Bulgaria’s</b> main oil port on the Black Sea. <b>Bulgaria’s</b> largest oil refinery, Neftochim, was purchased by Russian oil giant LUKoil in 1999 and underwent modernization in 2005. <b>Bulgaria’s</b> only significant coal resource is low-quality lignite, mainly from the state-owned Maritsa-Iztok and Bobov Dol complexes and used in local thermoelectric power stations.|$|R

5|$|Between 1912 and 1918, <b>Bulgaria</b> became {{involved}} in three consecutive conflicts—two Balkan Wars and World War I. After a disastrous defeat in the Second Balkan War, <b>Bulgaria</b> again found itself fighting on the losing side {{as a result of}} its alliance with the Central Powers in World War I. Despite fielding more than a quarter of its population in a 1,200,000-strong army and achieving several decisive victories, at Doiran and Dobrich, the country capitulated in 1918. The war resulted in significant territorial losses, and a total of 87,500 soldiers killed. More than 253,000 refugees immigrated to <b>Bulgaria</b> from 1912 to 1929 due to the effects of these wars, placing additional strain on the already ruined national economy.|$|E

5|$|In 1256 <b>Bulgaria</b> {{descended into}} {{a civil war}} between Mitso Asen (r. 1256–1257), a {{relative}} of Ivan Asen II, who established himself in south-eastern <b>Bulgaria,</b> and the bolyar of Skopje Constantine Tikh (r. 1257–1277), who was proclaimed emperor by the nobility in Tarnovo. Simultaneously, the Hungarian noble of Rus' princely origin Rostislav Mikhailovich established himself in Vidin as another claimant of the title Emperor of <b>Bulgaria</b> and was recognized as such by the Kingdom of Hungary. By 1261 Constantine Tikh had emerged as victor, but his 20–year-long reign did not bring stability to Bulgaria: Vidin remained separated from the central authorities in Tarnovo, the Mongols regularly campaigned in north-eastern <b>Bulgaria,</b> looting the countryside and paralysing the economy. That same year Michael VIII Palaiologos (r. 1259–1282) seized Constantinople and restored the Byzantine Empire as a major adversary of <b>Bulgaria</b> to the south. In the 1260s Constantine Tikh broke his leg in a hunting incident and was paralysed from the waist down. This disability weakened his control over the government and he fell {{under the influence of}} his second wife Irene Doukaina Laskarina, who was constantly involved in intrigues with her relatives in the Byzantine court. Later, he left the state affairs to his third wife, Maria Palaiologina Kantakouzene— a scandalous intriguer whose actions to secure the succession of her son alienated the nobility.|$|E
