5|$|Edgar Quinet was {{converted}} into a training ship in the mid-1920s before running aground off the Algerian coast in January 1930. She could not <b>be</b> <b>pulled</b> free and sank five days later. Waldeck-Rousseau served as the flagship of the Far East fleet from 1929 to 1932 and was decommissioned after returning to France. She was hulked in 1936 and scrapped in 1941–44.|$|E
5|$|Some species, such as Gryllus assimilis, take off, fly, {{and land}} {{efficiently}} and well, while other species are clumsy fliers. In some species, the hind wings are shed, leaving wing stumps, usually after dispersal of the insect by flight. In other species, they may <b>be</b> <b>pulled</b> off and {{consumed by the}} cricket itself or by another individual, probably providing a nutritional boost.|$|E
5|$|According to the game's back-story, Necrid {{was once}} a human warrior. He sought and found the cursed sword Soul Edge, only to <b>be</b> <b>pulled</b> into the {{dimension}} that the sword's spirit inhabits. Escaping the dimension with his body drastically mutated, his memories and sanity initially lost, he now wields various forms of energy as weapons, while searching for fragments of the shattered Soul Edge that soothe the pain caused by his separation from the dimension's energies.|$|E
50|$|For every 100 meters {{the user}} walks, {{one of the}} lower beads <b>is</b> <b>pulled</b> down. When the ninth of the lower beads <b>is</b> <b>pulled,</b> the user has walked 900 meters. When the user has walked 1000 meters, one of the upper beads <b>is</b> <b>pulled</b> down, and all the lower beads <b>are</b> <b>pulled</b> back up.|$|R

50|$|On {{the first}} day, the deity {{is brought to}} Jamal by the priests. Then it <b>is</b> <b>pulled</b> to Asan, Kathmandu via Ratna Park and Bhotahity. The next day it <b>is</b> <b>pulled</b> from Asan Kathmandu to Hanumandokha. Finally it <b>is</b> <b>pulled</b> to Lagantole via Maruhity and Jaisideval. During all three days, people come and pay their respect to the God.|$|R
5|$|Adrienne's head {{is split}} open by a {{swinging}} pendulum blade in one death scene, an effect that took several hours to set up. A fake head was created from a model cast of actress Victoria Morsell's head, with pumps installed to pump fake blood into it, and strings attached {{to either side}} so it could <b>be</b> <b>pulled</b> apart. The crew only had one head model, {{so they had to}} keep putting it back together and reusing it over and over for each take. After filming was completed, the crew put the head back together and took a picture of Morsell with it.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of a tidal shock, streams of stars can <b>be</b> <b>pulled</b> away from the cluster halo, leaving only the core part of the cluster. These tidal {{interaction}} effects create tails of stars that can extend up to several degrees of arc away from the cluster. These tails typically both precede and follow the cluster along its orbit. The tails can accumulate significant portions of the original mass of the cluster, and can form clumplike features.|$|E
5|$|Before {{each game}} and single-player Conquest, players choose between Sports and Action camera views. Action view is a {{trailing}} third-person shot similar to {{looking over the}} player-character's shoulder, while Sports view is a spectator perspective similar that of a televised basketball game. Enclosed arenas are inaccessible when using Sports view. The camera view cannot be changed once single-player begins, so Conquest mode players in Sports view will not see the arenas they unlock. The Action view camera swings wildly and can <b>be</b> <b>pulled</b> back slightly in the menus.|$|E

50|$|On {{the first}} day, the chariot <b>is</b> <b>pulled</b> from Jamal, Durbar Marg through Bhotahiti to Asan where it makes an {{overnight}} halt. The next day, the chariot <b>is</b> <b>pulled</b> through Indra Chok to Kathmandu Durbar Square where it makes its second stop. On the third day, the chariot <b>is</b> <b>pulled</b> through Maru and Chikan Mugal to Lagan {{at the southern}} end of the historic section of Kathmandu.|$|R
5|$|Early {{in the wet}} stage, a {{group of}} nine riders broke away, only to <b>be</b> <b>pulled</b> back the peloton, with a second group of {{nineteen}} also failing. An unsuccessful move from Tony Martin was followed by an attack by Vincenzo Nibali over the Col de Grimone {{and the formation of}} an elite five-strong group on descent with Rui Costa, Alejandro Valverde, and Tony Gallopin. This attack reduced the main group of chasers and caused the abandonment of several riders. The advantage of the break was over three minutes as they climbed the Col de Rousset, with Nibali briefly escaping on the subsequent descent.|$|E
5|$|For females, {{short hair}} must be neat {{and may not}} extend past {{the bottom of the}} collar, while long hair must <b>be</b> <b>pulled</b> back into a tight bun, and may be {{contained}} by a hairnet. Very long hair may be braided or worn as a bun. Hair elastics, bobby pins and hairnets should be the same colour as the cadet's hair. When braided the cadets hair may be worn in either double or single French braids and in both cases the braids must fall behind the shoulders and not extend past the bottom of the armpit.|$|E
5|$|In 1863, a new {{railroad}} {{bridge was}} constructed {{adjacent to the}} Long Bridge {{as part of a}} plan to strengthen the logistics of the Army of the Potomac as it operated in northern Virginia. An extension of the Orange and Alexandria Railroad, the bridge would be used until {{the turn of the century}} before being replaced. Owing to the weight of the railroad and the weak strength of the bridge, no locomotives were allowed on the bridge. Prior to crossing the Potomac, the train would detach its locomotive and <b>be</b> <b>pulled</b> across the bridge by a team of horses.|$|E
5000|$|Gonzo {{introduces}} the next parody. In Metro-Goldwyn-Bear's The Fool of the Roman Empire, Dudley Moore portrays a jazz piano-playing Julius Caesar. Dudley plays a melody on the piano, while Gonzo, Beauregard, and Lew Zealand have a chariot race. Gonzo's chariot <b>is</b> <b>pulled</b> by a chicken, Beauregard's chariot <b>is</b> <b>pulled</b> by rats, and Lew Zealand's chariot <b>is</b> <b>pulled</b> by a shark. Statler and Waldorf {{comment on the}} parody.|$|R
5000|$|Event 2 - Hang Tough:Mandy was {{up against}} Jet and <b>was</b> <b>pulled</b> down between the red ring and the silver with 29.3 seconds to go scoring herself no points while Kay {{was up against}} Lightning and <b>was</b> <b>pulled</b> down between the red ring and the silver ring scoring herself no points. Mark was up against Wolf and <b>was</b> <b>pulled</b> down with both {{his hands on the}} one ring scoring himself no points while Murray was up against Cobra and despite holding on for thirty two seconds <b>was</b> <b>pulled</b> off by his feet scoring himself no points.|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to Hanna-Barbera's Speed Buggy (1973) and Wonder Wheels (1977–78), the three series were commonly grouped together {{due to the}} similarities in plot and characters. Reception-wise, several critics reacted negatively to the violence and portrayal of motorcycles in the series, prompting viewers to write letters to NBC in hopes that the show would <b>be</b> <b>pulled</b> off the air. Wheelie and the Chopper Bunch had a total of 13 episodes, each consisting of 3 segments, or a total of 39 segments. It has since been released on DVD as part of Warner Bros.' Archive Collection on a three disc set.|$|E
5|$|The 37mm Gun M3 was {{the first}} {{dedicated}} anti-tank gun fielded by United States forces in numbers. Introduced in 1940, it became the standard anti-tank gun of the U.S. infantry with its size enabling it to <b>be</b> <b>pulled</b> by a jeep. However, the continuing improvement of German tanks quickly rendered the 37mm ineffective and, by 1943, it was being gradually replaced in the European and Mediterranean theaters by the more powerful British-developed 57 mm Gun M1. In the Pacific, where the Japanese tank threat was less significant, the M3 remained in service {{until the end of}} the war.|$|E
5|$|The car {{appeared}} in the early 20th century to <b>be</b> <b>pulled</b> by horse again in the dirty thirties. In 1906, cars could be registered, and plates were issued as early as 1912. In the late 1920s the roads were gravelled near the larger centers such as Yorkton, Saskatoon, the Battlefords, and Lloydminster. All-weather roads were developed in the 1930s, which began to depart from the surveyed township roads connecting centres directly. Roads also were constructed to allow for rain run-off, with a rounded top surface.|$|E
50|$|For {{most of the}} museum's history, {{nearly all}} trains <b>were</b> <b>pulled</b> by steam {{locomotives}} although since February 2000, all trains have <b>been</b> <b>pulled</b> by diesel-electric locomotives pending the restoration or repair of the museum's steam locomotives.|$|R
5000|$|Sprung seam - A sprung seam is a {{condition}} where the seam <b>is</b> <b>pulled</b> {{away from the body}} wall. In extreme cases, the seam <b>is</b> <b>pulled</b> away from the body wall {{all the way around the}} can.|$|R
50|$|In 1974, Hurricanes Kirsten and Ione interacted in a Fujiwara interaction, as Ione <b>was</b> <b>pulled</b> north east, while Kirsten <b>was</b> <b>pulled</b> to {{the north}} west. In the same year,Francesca and Gretchen interacted with each other, until they merged on July 19.|$|R
5|$|The {{evolution}} of moon systems {{is driven by}} tidal forces. A moon will raise a tidal bulge in the object it orbits (the primary) due to the differential gravitational force across diameter of the primary. If a moon is revolving {{in the same direction}} as the planet's rotation and the planet is rotating faster than the orbital period of the moon, the bulge will constantly <b>be</b> <b>pulled</b> ahead of the moon. In this situation, angular momentum is transferred from the rotation of the primary to the r{{evolution of}} the satellite. The moon gains energy and gradually spirals outward, while the primary rotates more slowly over time.|$|E
5|$|While Tszyu {{celebrated in}} his corner, Judah was in disbelief of what just {{happened}} and became infuriated. Judah picked up his stool and hurled it towards center ring. While being restrained by his father and trainer, Yoel Judah, he broke loose and walked up to Nady and stuck his gloved fist into his neck and had to <b>be</b> <b>pulled</b> off by cornermen. A few minutes later, Jimmy Lennon, Jr. announced the official decision and Judah screamed out and again had to be restrained by {{a growing number of}} security guards and cornermen. Judah was fined $75,000 and suspended for six months by the Nevada State Athletic Commission.|$|E
5|$|After {{being trapped}} in the harbour {{for more than a}} year, Great Britain was at last floated out in December 1844, but not before causing more anxiety for her proprietors. After passing {{successfully}} through the first set of lock gates, she jammed on her passage through the second, which led to the River Avon. Only the seamanship of Captain Claxton (who after Naval service held the position of Quay Warden (Harbour Master) at Bristol) enabled her to <b>be</b> <b>pulled</b> back and severe structural damage avoided. The following day an army of workmen, under the direct control of Brunel, took advantage of the slightly higher tide and removed coping stones and lock gate platforms from the Junction Lock, allowing the tug Samson, again under Claxton's supervision, to tow the ship safely into the Avon that midnight.|$|E
50|$|Tom Savage {{started at}} {{quarterback for the}} Texans, but <b>was</b> <b>pulled</b> from {{the game in the}} 1st quarter due to a {{possible}} concussion. After Savage <b>was</b> <b>pulled,</b> Brock Osweiler, who had been benched 2 weeks prior, came in as quarterback.|$|R

5|$|As {{in other}} mammals, and unlike in birds, the radius {{is the main}} {{component}} of the forearm. Bats have five elongated digits, which all radiate around the wrist. The thumb points forward and supports the leading edge, and the other digits support the tension held in the wing membrane. The second and third digits go along the wing tip, allowing the wing to <b>be</b> <b>pulled</b> forward against a strong drag force, without having to be thick like they were in pterosaur wings. The fourth and fifth digits go from the wrist to the trailing edge, and repel the bending force caused by air pushing up against the stiff membrane. Due to their flexible joints, bats are more manoeuvrable and more dextrous than gliding mammals.|$|E
5|$|Baird and Jackie {{were asked}} to visit Lennon at Kenwood which was his home in Weybridge in 1964. Cynthia Lennon—Lennon's wife at the time—took them both out {{shopping}} in Knightsbridge, buying them expensive clothes. During the same visit, The Beatles played at the Finsbury Park Astoria, and the sisters asked {{to be allowed to}} stand near the front, but had to <b>be</b> <b>pulled</b> out of the audience by security guards because of the crush. In December 1965, Dykins was killed in a car crash at the bottom of Penny Lane. Lennon was not told about his death for months afterwards. Dykins had married again, but Baird acknowledges that she and Jackie had very little contact with his wife, and did not attend their father's funeral.|$|E
5|$|Haynes' car is {{believed}} to be the second gasoline-engine powered vehicle successfully road tested in the United States, according to its exhibit information at the Smithsonian Institution. It was built two years before Henry Ford's Quadricycle, and preceded only by Charles Duryea's Motorized Wagon less than a year earlier. Unlike Duryea's car, which was an adapted buckboard wagon that was designed to run under its own power but still able to <b>be</b> <b>pulled</b> by horse, Haynes' car was designed only to run on its own. Some automotive historians use this difference to determine that Haynes' car was the first true American automobile. The Sintz company continued to be intrigued by Haynes' use of their motor and sent representatives to photo his vehicle and published the images as an advertisement for one of their engine's possible uses. The publicity spurred the creation of numerous other automobiles across the American midwest.|$|E
