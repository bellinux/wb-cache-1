40|$|Effective <b>back-stitching</b> {{methods were}} {{experimentally}} sought, with No. 80 count cotton broadcloth and No. 80 count cotton sewing thread as materials and by sewing the cloth with stitches 4 mm long. The findings obtained {{are as follows}} : 1. When the cloth is sewn once and the seam thus formed is back-stitched, the most effective method is either to fill the interstitch spaces of the seam with each back-stitch (Fig. 1) or to make each back-stitch and the stitch of the seam lie one above the other by half a stitch-length (Fig. 1). 2. Two-threaded stitching differs little in its effectiveness from <b>back-stitching.</b> 3. There is not much to choose between 'hongaeshi nui' or putting in at each stitch a back-stitch of the same length (Fig. 2) and 'hangaeshi nui' or putting in at each stitch a back-stitch of half its length (Fig. 2). 4. Stitches are decidedly less effective and durable when the cloth is machine-sewed than when it is hand-sewed under the same condition. It is to be desired that means should be devised to obtain better stitching effectiveness by taking these experimental findings into consideration...|$|E
50|$|Overall {{patchwork}} {{designs are}} incrementally pieced geometric shapes stitched {{together to form}} a larger random or composed design. The colored shapes can be randomly pieced or follow a strict order to create a specific effect, e.g. value (light to dark) progressions, or checkerboard effects. Names such as Hit or Miss, Clamshell, <b>back-stitch,</b> needle weave, criss-cross and Starburst identify some overall patchwork structures.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the technological process for manufacturing a low-cut footwear product (type shoe) for women, for casual use, in an IL system. The paper {{begins with a}} general presentation of the technological process of manufacturing the product, and follows with a case study which details the characteristic operations, {{as well as the}} common ones, which take place during the process. Depending on the structure of the model and the characteristics of the raw and auxiliary materials, the technological process used in the manufacture workshops will be laid-out. Product manufacture begins with cutting the materials, in our case the parts being cut from full grain leather, and the lining from lining leather. After the pieces for {{the upper part of the}} shoe are cut according to the guides, they will be assembled using different methods such as: stitching, gluing or fastening. The guides are processed in order to thin out the edges evenly or in a slant, or to decorate them by bending, burning or painting. For stitching the parts a simple two-thread stitch is used, with one or two seams and <b>back-stitches,</b> and the gluing can be temporary or permanent. In the process the time and production quotas are presented, which are influenced by the qualification level of the workers, as well as the performance of the machines used...|$|R
