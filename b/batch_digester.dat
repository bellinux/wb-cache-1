More initial build money and a larger volume of the <b>batch</b> <b>digester</b> is needed to handle the same amount of waste as a continuous process digester. Higher heat energy is demanded in a thermophilic system compared to a mesophilic system and has a larger gas output capacity and higher methane gas content. For solids content, low will handle up to 15% solid content. Above this level is considered high solids content and can also be known as dry digestion. In a single stage process, one reactor houses the four anaerobic digestion steps. A multistage process utilizes two or more reactors for digestion to separate the methanogenesis and hydrolysis phases.|$|E

40|$|This work {{presents}} a novel meta-analysis for methane yields from anaerobically digesting dairy cattle manure. A database is compiled from 115 articles (2181 cases) by systematically assessing the academic literature. YCH 4 and secondary variables {{collected in the}} database describe performance, operation conditions of digester and manure composition. Inputs to the database are normalised to enable inter-study uni- and multi-variate analysis, according to different types of digesters. Most cases (N = 1299) are reported for <b>batch</b> <b>digesters</b> and meta-analysis results in a mean YCH 4 of 0. 230 ± 0. 016 m 3 kg- 1. CSTR (N = 241), results in mean of 0. 190 ± 0. 016 m 3 kg- 1 (random-effect model). Other continuous digesters, such as fixed-film, plug-flow and UASB require further cases {{for the application of}} meta-analysis. For non-specified semi-continuous digesters (N = 347), the mean calculated by the random-effect model is 0. 204 ± 0. 032 m 3 kg- 1 (N = 27). With respect to multi-variate analysis of operation conditions, <b>batch</b> <b>digesters</b> form four clusters, while two clusters are identified for CSTR and three for semi-continuous digesters. For variables describing manure composition, <b>batch</b> <b>digesters</b> present eight clusters, while CSTR and semi-continuous digesters have insufficient cases. The strongest correlations found for these secondary variables (Spearman's rho: - 0. 685 and - 0. 696) result for pH and YCH 4 in batch and CSTR, respectively. Maximum YCH 4 estimated by meta-analysis are proposed to replace the default IPCC values because they are based on a larger sample size and integrate updated literature.

Mathematical programming models were developed leading to Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problems. Based on the general Resource Task Network (RTN) process representation, the models use either a discrete or a continuous time representation with a common reference grid for all resource. The first case study consists of a resource constrained four <b>batch</b> <b>digester</b> system of an acid sulphite pulp mill. Two different types of models were developed: one for the scheduling operational problem, and other for the <b>batch</b> <b>digester</b> operation during the heating stage the process bottleneck. In the scheduling model, steam availability is modelled through {{the definition of a}} superstructure including the most relevant heating alternatives. The duration of the several heating tasks was estimated through the use of the process model: a distributed heterogeneous dynamic model in gPROMS validated with plant data. The second case study involved a three parallel production line polymer compounding plant, whose equipment's require cleaning between product changeovers. To address this problem a very effective user friendly scheduling tool was developed, which consists of a general scheduling model coupled with the capabilities of Microsoft Excel for data handling and analysis. As outputs the user can access the optimal schedules for a number of different objectives such us: production maximisation, cleaning times minimization and tardiness minimisation.

As {{the first part}} of the study, this article presents detailed observations of microbial biofilm architecture and structure in a 1. 25 -L <b>batch</b> <b>digester</b> where all particles are of an equal age. Microcrystalline cellulose was used as the sole carbon and energy source. The digestions were inoculated with either leachate from a 220 -Lanaerobic municipal solid waste digester or strained rumen contents from a fistulated cow. The hydrolysis rate, when normalized by the amount of cellulose remaining in the reactor, was found to reach a constant value 1 day after inoculation with rumen fluid, and 3 days after inoculating with digester leachate. A constant value of a mass specific hydrolysis rate is argued to represent full colonization of the cellulose surface and first-order kinetics only apply after this point. Additionally, the first-order hydrolysis rate constant, once surfaces were saturated with biofilm, was found to be two times higher with a rumen inoculum, compared to a digester leachate inoculum. Images generated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probing and confocal laser scanning microscopy show that the microbial communities involved in the anaerobic biodegradation process exist entirely within the biofilm.

In cattle feeding system for young bulls {{there is an}} inversion of the proportion between forage and concentrate. In other words, the animals receive a smaller amount of forage compared to the traditional system. These changes in the manure characteristics involve changes in the treatment systems. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the potential production of biogas of <b>batch</b> <b>digesters</b> fed with manure from young bulls that received two diets containing different proportions between forage and concentrate, with or without inoculums and submitted to three levels of temperature (25, 35 and 40 (0) C). The evaluated parameters were total solids (TS) and volatile solids (VS) reduction and biogas potentials production. The digesters fed with manure from animals that received the diet 2 (80 %C + 20 % R) showed the largest reductions of TS and VS. About the potentials of biogas production there was interaction between the factors diet and inoculums, but no effects of temperatures. The treatment content manure from animals fed with diet 2 without inoculums presented the greatest potential of biogas production per kg of TS added (0. 2123 m³) ...|$|R
40|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} {{has proven}} to be an efficient way for the production of a renewable fuel. The aim of this work was to study the potential use of two crop silages, yellow lupine (Lupinus luteus L.) and oilseed radish (Raphanus sativus var. oleifera cv. Pegletta), for the production of biogas through the process of anaerobic digestion. The use of yellow lupine was due to its capacity for nitrogen fixation, reducing the fertilization needs for the succeeding crop cycle and reducing also the GHG emissions due to the fertilizer production and its field application. The utilization of the oilseed radish was due to its root exudates with nematicide effect, reducing the needs for soil disinfection, working as a biological weapon and also due to the effect on soil compaction of its large roots, working as a bio-driller. The yellow lupine gave rise to 400 m 3 of CH 4. t- 1 VS and the oilseed radish silage produced approximately 300 m 3 of CH 4. t- 1 VS, proving to be good anaerobic substrates. The inoculum used for the <b>batch</b> <b>digesters</b> was sludge from an anaerobic digester of a WWTP...|$|R
40|$|Anaerobic {{fermentation}} is {{a highly}} promising technology for converting biomass waste into methane, which then may directly {{be used as an}} energy source. Attempts have been made to optimize various parameters {{in order to determine the}} most favorable recipe for maximum biogas production from fermented vegetable waste. The biogas production from many types of vegetable waste such as zucchini, orange peel, tomato, potato, and rice was studied in <b>batch</b> <b>digesters.</b> The effect of adding chicken dung and sludge to vegetable waste on the concentration of methane in the produced biogas was investigated. The experiments were conducted at room temperature (20 °C) and at 35 °C. The results revealed that methane concentration goes through maximum value with time. This maximum value is obtained faster when the rate of digestion is faster. The concentrations of methane in the biogas produced are ranked as follows: potato>rice>tomato>zucchini>orange peels. The concentrations of methane gas increased as chicken dung and sludge were mixed with the vegetables. The maximum value of methane concentration is reached faster in a mixture of chicken dung and sludge. For both chicken dung and sludge, the maximum value is reached at the same time...|$|R
