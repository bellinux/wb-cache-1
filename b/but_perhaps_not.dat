5|$|In {{his first}} {{statement}} {{he said he}} had handed the report to Rudolf Kastner on 26 April 1944 during the latter's visit to Bratislava, but Bauer writes that the report was not finished until 27 April. In another statement, Krasniansky said he had passed it to Kastner on 28 April in Bratislava, but Hansi Brand, Kastner's lover and the wife of Joel Brand, said that Kastner was not in Bratislava until August. It is clear from Kastner's post-war statements that he did have early access to the report, Bauer writes, <b>but</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>not</b> in April. According to Randolph L. Braham, Kastner had a copy by 3 May, when he paid a visit to Kolozsvár (Cluj), his home town.|$|E
5|$|Capcom's design {{philosophy}} for Marvel vs. Capcom 3 was {{to maximize}} gameplay depth and minimize complexity. According to Niitsuma, the development team sought {{to create a}} game that would reach out to longtime fans of the series, while simultaneously expanding their user base to those familiar with the characters, <b>but</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>not</b> with fighting games in general. The urge {{to reach out to}} new players also stemmed from Marvel's recent success in the Hollywood film industry. Capcom's global head of production, Keiji Inafune, expressed interest in appealing to a worldwide audience. These ideas drove the decision to retool the fighting system, which was criticized in past iterations for being too complicated for casual players. These changes include the implementation of the three-button attack system from Tatsunoko vs. Capcom and the addition of Simple Mode. Unlike previous titles in the series, Capcom had no plans for an arcade release, and focused only on console versions for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. When asked if Capcom was planning to release the game on other consoles, Niitsuma did not dismiss the possibility for a Nintendo Wii version; however, this ultimately did not come to fruition.|$|E

500|$|An 11-segment {{series of}} reports in March 2012 from ABC News brought {{widespread}} public attention to and raised consumer concerns about the product. The product was described as [...] "essentially scrap meat pieces compressed together and treated with an antibacterial agent". Lean finely textured beef (LFTB) {{was referred to as}} [...] "an unappetizing example of industrialized food production". The product has been characterized as [...] "unappetizing, <b>but</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>not</b> more so than other things that are routinely part of hamburger" [...] by Sarah Klein, an attorney for the food safety program at the Center for Science in the Public Interest. Nutritionist Andy Bellatti has referred to the product as [...] "one of many symptoms of a broken food system". Food policy writer Tom Laskawy noted that ammonium hydroxide is only one of several chemicals routinely added to industrially produced meat in the United States.|$|E

[...] In the final quarter of 1966, the Beach Boys became the strongest selling album act in the UK, ending the three-year reign of native bands such as the Beatles.

Both Galimov and Sizov were transported to Moscow for treatment. The two {{were placed in}} medically induced comas to relieve stress; however, Galimov died on 12 September at the Vishnevsky Institute of Surgery. Sizov was moved from intensive care to a ward on 12 September, and his life {{was considered to be}} out of danger.

2500|$|The British Government {{decided to}} {{undertake}} massive fortifications in the 19th century {{and to create}} a strategic harbour to deter attacks from France. These fortifications were presciently described by William Ewart Gladstone as [...] "a monument of human folly, useless to us ... <b>but</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>not</b> absolutely useless to a possible enemy, with whom we may at some period have to deal and who may possibly be able to extract some profit in the way of shelter and accommodation from the ruins." [...] An influx of English and Irish labourers, plus the sizeable British garrison stationed in the island, led to rapid Anglicisation. The harbour was never completed – the remaining breakwater (designed by James Walker) is one of the island's landmarks, and is longer than any breakwater in the UK.|$|E

2500|$|In {{terms of}} {{importance}} value, palms are highly valued by all species of capuchin. In El Tuparro National Park in Colombia, the palm Attalea regiae {{was a key}} species for this primate, the nuts being a principal food. In Manú National Park in Peru the palms Astrocaryum and Attalea {{were the most important}} palm genera, <b>but</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>not</b> at the same level as Attalea in El Tuparro. Also, at Manú various species of Ficus were very important to the white-fronted capuchin; this emphasis on Ficus was not observed in the El Tuparro study, although this study did not include an entire year. Nevertheless, research on other species suggests the importance of palms as [...] "key species" [...] and the lack of importance of Ficus in such habitats as gallery forests in the llanos of Colombia and Venezuela, contrasts with their high importance in more fertile habitats like Manú.|$|E
2500|$|The {{traditional}} view of Islam {{has also}} been criticised {{for the lack of}} supporting evidence consistent with that view, such as the lack of archaeological evidence, and discrepancies with non-Muslim literary sources. In the 1970s, what {{has been described as a}} [...] "wave of sceptical scholars" [...] challenged a great deal of the received wisdom in Islamic studies. They argued that the Islamic historical tradition had been greatly corrupted in transmission. They tried to correct or reconstruct the early history of Islam from other, presumably more reliable, sources such as coins, inscriptions, and non-Islamic sources. The oldest of this group was John Wansbrough (1928–2002). Wansbrough's works were widely noted, <b>but</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>not</b> widely read. In 1972 a cache of ancient Qur'ans in a mosque in Sana'a, Yemen was discovered – commonly known as the Sana'a manuscripts. The German scholar Gerd R. Puin has been investigating these Quran fragments for years. His research team made 35,000 microfilm photographs of the manuscripts, which he dated to early part of the 8th century. Puin has not published the entirety of his work, but noted unconventional verse orderings, minor textual variations, and rare styles of orthography. He also suggested that some of the parchments were palimpsests which had been reused. Puin believed that this implied an evolving text as opposed to a fixed one.|$|E
