The foundation of a rotating machine can contribute to the dynamics of the system, and therefore it becomes essential to include the foundation in the model to predict the correct response of the system.

40|$|The general {{bearing mode}} of failure often {{controls}} the capacity of cold-formed steel bolted connections loaded in shear. Previous {{research has shown that}} the absence of washers can significantly lower the bearing resistance of these connections. Experimental studies have also revealed that the bearing capacity can be formulated with a gradated <b>bearing</b> <b>coefficient</b> that is governed by the ratio of fastener diameter to sheet thickness. A gradated <b>bearing</b> <b>coefficient</b> method, which was based on an investigation of bolted connections composed of mild steel as well as thin high strength steel, has recently been proposed to cold-formed steel design code committees in North America, Australia and New Zealand. However, the new bearing method does not include provisions for the design of washerless bolted connections. For this reason a total of 168 bolted connection shear tests designed to fail by bearing were performed. The test program included connections with and without washers, which were divided into single and double shear, as well as high strength steel (Grade 550) and mild sheet steel (Grade 230) categories. The thickness of the sheet steel material ranged between 0. 43 mm and 1. 53 mm. In addition, data for 381 washerless bolted connection specimens from previous experimental investigations was included in an evaluation of current cold-formed steel design standards and specifications.

40|$|Abstract—We {{report the}} design, fabrication, and {{characterization}} of a rotary micromotor supported on microball bearings. This {{is the first}} demonstration of a rotary micromachine with a robust mechanical support provided by microball-bearing technology. A six-phase bottom-drive variable-capacitance micromotor (φ = 14 mm) is designed and simulated using the finite-element (FE) method. The stator and the rotor are fabricated separately on silicon substrates and assembled with the microballs. Three layers of low-k benzocyclobutene polymer, two layers of gold, and a silicon microball housing are fabricated on the stator. Microball housing and salient structures (poles) are etched in the rotor and are coated with a silicon carbide film that reduces the friction without which the operation was not possible. A top angular velocity of 517 r/min, corresponding to the linear tip velocity of 324 mm/s, is measured at ± 150 -V and 800 -Hz excitation. This is 44 {{times higher than the}} velocity previously demonstrated for linear micromotors supported on the microball bearings. A noncontact method is developed to extract the torque and the <b>bearing</b> <b>coefficient</b> of friction through dynamic response measurements. The torque is indirectly measured to be − 5. 62 ± 0. 5 µN · m at ± 150 -V excitation which is comparable with the FE simulation results predicting − 6. 75 µN · m. The maximum output mechanical power at ± 150 V and 517 r/min was calculated to be 307 µW. The <b>bearing</b> <b>coefficient</b> of friction is measured to be 0. 02 ± 0. 002 which is in good agreement with the previously reported values. The rotary micromotor developed in this paper is a platform technology for centrifugal micropumps used for fuel-delivery and cooling applications.

It points out that the ultimate load capacity of a serial bolted connection failing in combined bearing and shear-out cannot be computed as the simple sum of the respective ultimate bearing and ultimate shear-out capacities, which is implicitly permitted in design specifications worldwide.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} optimization of {{rotor system}} design using stability and vibration response criteria. The initial {{premise of the}} study is that the effect of certain design changes can be parameterized in a system dynamic model through their influence on the system matrices obtained by finite element modeling. A suitable vibration response measure is derived by considering an unknown axial distribution of unbalance components having bounded magnitude. It is shown that the worst-case unbalance response is given by an absolute row-sum norm of the system frequency response matrix. The minimization of this norm is treated through the formulation of a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) that can also incorporate design parameter constraints and stability criteria. The formulation can also be extended to cover uncertain or time-varying system dynamics arising, for example, due to speed-dependent <b>bearing</b> <b>coefficients</b> or gyroscopic effects. Numerical solution of the matrix inequalities is tackled using an iterative method that involves standard convex optimization routines. The method is applied in a case study that considers the optimal selection of bearing support stiffness and damping levels to minimize the worst-case vibration of a flexible rotor over a finite speed range. The main restriction in the application of the method is found to be the slow convergence of the numerical routines that occurs with high-order models and/or high problem complexity.
