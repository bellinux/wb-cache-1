50|$|These {{are large}} <b>brown</b> and white <b>shrikes</b> found in sub-Saharan Africa. They are gregarious species, unlike the Lanius shrikes, {{and have a}} parrot-like flight.|$|R
50|$|Elsewhere, the {{southern}} parapatric {{relatives of the}} L. excubitor are the Chinese grey shrike (L. sphenocerus) from East Asia and the loggerhead shrike (L. ludovicianus) from North America. The northern grey shrike is sympatric in winter quarters with each of its three close relatives at the north of their range. Their overall colouration is - apparently plesiomorphically - shared in sub-Saharan Africa by the somewhat more distantly related grey-backed fiscal (L. excubitoroides) which is found from the Sahel eastwards, and Mackinnon's fiscal (L. mackinnoni) of the Congo Basin region. The lesser grey shrike (L. minor, Balkans to Central Asia) seems to be quite distinct indeed and is sympatric with the grey shrike superspecies between Eastern Europe and Central Asia; {{it may be more}} closely related to the small <b>brown</b> <b>shrikes</b> and resemble the bold, aggressive and hard-to-catch grey shrikes because of Batesian mimicry.|$|R
50|$|Some of {{the common}} migratory birds found here are grey pelican, painted stork, ibis, cormorant, egret, etc. which nest on trees in the islands present in the lake. Recent survey of birds have {{indicated}} 147 species. Herons, Asian open bill storks, egrets, red wattle lapwing, sandpipers, rose ringed parakeet, black drongo, <b>brown</b> <b>shrike,</b> red-whiskered bulbul, booted warbler, sunbird and greenish warbler {{are some of the}} other species of birds found here.|$|E
50|$|The <b>brown</b> <b>shrike</b> {{is larger}} with a longer tail and thinner bill. Adults have a brown crown and nape, plain brown {{back and a}} white stripe over the eye. Juveniles are less contrastingly marked than the {{juvenile}} tiger shrike and have a dark mask. The bull-headed shrike is also larger and longer-tailed. Adults have a reddish-brown crown and nape and males have a white wing-patch. The Burmese shrike (Lanius collurioides) is slimmer and longer-tailed than the tiger shrike with a white wing-patch and a plain chestnut back.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>brown</b> <b>shrike</b> (Lanius cristatus) is {{a bird in}} the shrike {{family that}} is found mainly in Asia. It {{is closely related to}} the red-backed shrike (L. collurio) and isabelline shrike (L. isabellinus). The genus name, Lanius, is derived from the Latin word for [...] "butcher", and some shrikes are also known as [...] "butcher birds" [...] because of their feeding habits. The {{specific}} cristatus is Latin for [...] "crested", used in a broader sense than in English. The common English name [...] "shrike" [...] is from Old English scríc, [...] "shriek", referring to the shrill call.|$|E
5000|$|The tiger shrike {{was first}} {{described}} in 1822 by the Belgian naturalist Pierre Auguste Joseph Drapiez in the Dictionnaire classique d'histoire naturelle. He {{placed it in}} the genus Lanius, {{a group of about}} 26 species living in open areas across Eurasia, Africa and North America. The name of the genus means [...] "butcher" [...] in Latin, referring to the birds' habit of impaling and storing prey. Within the genus, analysis of calls suggests that the tiger shrike is most closely related to the <b>brown</b> <b>shrike</b> (L. cristatus) and bull-headed shrike (L. bucephalus). It has no recognized subspecies.|$|E
5000|$|The Rauchua / Kyttyk wetland area is {{considered}} to be the easternmost extent of so-called [...] "Kolyma fauna", such as the Terek sandpiper, <b>brown</b> <b>shrike</b> and scarlet rosefinch. The most common bird species in the Rauchua / Kyttyk wetland are the yellow-billed, black-throated and Pacific divers. One of the main reasons for the importance of the Rauchua / Kyttyk is the breeding population (figures as of 1994) of Bewick's swan (approximately 300 birds), the Pacific eider (approximately 3,000 birds) and the spectacled eider (approximately 2,000 birds). Spectacled and Pacific eider as well as black-throated and Pacific divers are also found in the Ust-Chaun region, though the Pacific eider is much more common on the Kyttyl Peninsula and near Apapelgino.|$|E
50|$|The UP Arboretum {{is located}} on a plateau with an {{elevation}} of 70 m above sea level. It lies {{in the middle of}} a natural ridge that runs northwest-southeast and is crossed by small creeks. The arboretum contains a collection of tropical plant species, many of which are endemic and endangered. The most common trees found in the arboretum are kupang, mahogany, narra, and rain trees. Many of these trees tower as high as 20 feet or more. It is also inhabited by alibangbáng, palo santo, monkey pod and tagutagu. They provide a sanctuary to 47 bird species, such as the long-tailed shrike, olive-backed sunbird, Philippine pygmy woodpecker, <b>brown</b> <b>shrike,</b> yellow-vented bulbul, lowland white-eye, pied triller, Eurasian tree sparrow, mountain shrike, Pacific swallow, pied fantail, tailorbird, lemon-throated leaf warbler and the spotted dove.|$|E

Approximately 1800 ha are under forest cover and 300 ha are open areas, pastures and areas under cultivation. Several portions of the La Mesa reservoir are shallow with exposed mudflats, swampforest, reed and other swamp vegetation. Its forest serves as an important breeding area for {{a variety of}} wildlife species and birds such as the little heron, black-crowned night heron, osprey, Japanese sparrowhawk, plain bush-hen, common moorhen, Eurasian coot, Philippine coucal, Philippine nightjar, island swiftlet, spotted wood kingfisher, common kingfisher, white-collared kingfisher, Philippine pygmy woodpecker, barn swallow, pied triller, ashy minivet, Philippine bulbul, black-naped oriole, Oriental magpie robin, Arctic warbler, grey-streaked flycatcher, pied fantail, yellow-bellied whistler, grey wagtail, <b>brown</b> <b>shrike,</b> olive-backed sunbird, and lowland white-eye.|$|E
50|$|The <b>brown</b> <b>shrike</b> is a {{migratory species}} and ringing {{studies show that}} they have high {{fidelity}} to their wintering sites, often returning to the same locations each winter. They begin establishing wintering territories shortly after arrival and their loud chattering or rattling calls are distinctive. Birds that arrive early and establish territories appear to have an advantage over those that arrive later in the winter areas. The timing of their migration is very regular with their arrival in winter to India in August and September and departure in April. During their winter period, they go through a premigratory moult. Their song in the winter quarters is faint and somewhat resembles {{the call of the}} rosy starling and often includes mimicry of other birds. The beak remains closed when singing and only throat pulsations are visible although the bird moves its tail up and down while singing.|$|E

In addition mice, lizards, large insects are also taken. In one study in Bangladesh, adults fed mainly on small sparrow sized birds (72%) and Pipistrellus bats (28%). They may sometimes pirate prey obtained by other medium-sized raptors. Prey may sometimes be cached and eaten subsequently.The red-necked falcon drinks water where available during the afternoons. This has been observed both in India and in Africa, where it sometimes visits waterholes.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Perch-sites are {{important}} in the territorial behaviour, and influence the life-history traits of true shrikes. I studied foraging behaviour, perch choice and use, and inter- and intraspecific interactions of migratory Brown Shrikes during a 5 -day stay at the Kenting National Park Youth Activity Center, southern Taiwan. Brown Shrikes overwhelmingly preferred to perch on protruding branches on a side of the tree canopy (N = 1886; 98. 3 %), which facilitated detection of prey and vigilance. The Brown Shrikes also rested a lot between hunting bouts while on migration, and hunting rate {{was very different from}} that during the breeding season. Of a total of 89 interactions with other individuals, 62 (69. 6 %) were intraspecific and 27 (30. 4 %) were interspecific. Of the 62 intraspecific aggressive interactions, 3 were against groups of up to 5 migrating Brown Shrikes that landed in the study plot before heading out to sea, supposedly towards the Philippines across the Luzon Strait. The 7 observed Brown Shrikes had an overall hunting success of 62. 7 % (106 of 169). I conclude that Brown Shrikes in Taiwan maintain feeding territories while on migration and feed en route and, like most other true shrikes, will adapt to local conditions and their diet will depend on local prey availability.
