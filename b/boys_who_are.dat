The two <b>boys,</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> eavesdropping on the conversation, are terrified at this prospect.|$|E
5|$|Chetham's admits {{boarding}} and day {{students to}} one of three houses: Victoria House, a mixed-gender house for students aged 8–13; Boys' House, for <b>boys</b> <b>who</b> <b>are,</b> or over the age of 13; and Girls' House for girls who are, or over the age of 13. In senior houses, boarding students share rooms for four people, and in the sixth form students either have single rooms or share with one other person. Students have a personal tutor to discuss their progress, and boarding students have a house parent who communicates with parents at home.|$|E

5|$|Nefarious: Merchant of Souls {{documents}} modern human trafficking, specifically sexual slavery. While {{there are}} men and <b>boys</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> trafficked around the world, the United States Department of State (DoS) estimates that about 80% of human trafficking victims are female, and the film focuses on them. Information is presented from a Christian worldview—despite the subject matter, there is no profanity or nudity in the film, although there are scenes showing alcohol consumption and women wearing skimpy clothing.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{tuition at}} the school was free, funded by various endowments and rents {{obtained}} from lands the most significant arising from the Abolition of the Chantries Acts, and the re-appropriation of funds to the school. In 1944 under the Education Act education remained free, however the common entrance exam at eleven was introduced and the school became a selective grammar school. School fees were introduced in 1977 when the school withdrew from the maintained system and became independent. For the year 2013/2014 they are £14,670 (approximately €17,900 or US$24,500 as of March 2014) per year excluding lunches. All those wishing to be admitted now take the schools own internal 11+ entrance examination which tests English, mathematics and verbal reasoning and attend an interview with two members of staff. If a place is awarded, entry can de deferred for two years so that <b>boys</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> at prep school may enter at thirteen. Those entering at thirteen must take the 13+ Common Entrance or the scholarship examination to confirm their place.|$|E
25|$|Boys {{are less}} willing to state they have {{negative}} feelings about sex than girls when they describe their sexual self-schemas. Boys are not divided into positive and negative sexual self-concepts; they are divided into schematic and non-schematic (a schema is a cluster of ideas about a process or aspect of the world; see schema). <b>Boys</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> sexually schematic are more sexually experienced, {{have higher levels of}} sexual arousal, and are more able to experience romantic feelings. <b>Boys</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> not schematic have fewer sexual partners, a smaller range of sexual experiences and are much less likely than schematic men to be in a romantic relationship.|$|E

Tobey eventually goes out with her but is confused between her and Callie Rose.|$|E
25|$|The bird the {{children}} have found has died, and {{the children}}, assisted by the adults, hold a funeral for it. Virginia is aware that she {{and the little girl}} are far more invested in the funeral than Vanessa's <b>boys,</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> probably laughing at the females behind their backs. As Virginia stares longingly at the dead bird she has an epiphany: her character, Clarissa Dalloway, is not like Virginia, and would not commit suicide. Like the bird's funeral bed, Clarissa represents -to Virginia- an uncaring, even foolish thing. As such, Clarissa will represent the death bed (the counterpoint) to the character who Virginia will have commit suicide.|$|E
25|$|In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), {{the largest}} {{denomination}} of the Latter Day Saint movement, priesthood is recognized only {{in men and}} <b>boys,</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> ordained to offices in the priesthood {{as a matter of}} course once they reach the age of 12, so long as they meet requirements of worthiness. There are no other requirements for ordination, although prior to 1978, the church did not ordain men or boys who were deemed to be of black African descent, based on the mid-19th century teachings of Brigham Young, which the church felt it could not abandon without a revelation from God. (See Black people and priesthood (LDS)). The doctrine was eliminated in 1978 and the church now allows all men to hold the priesthood, subject to worthiness.|$|E

25|$|Adolescent {{girls and}} <b>boys</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> {{attracted}} to {{others of the}} same sex are strongly affected by their surroundings in that adolescents often decide to express their sexualities or keep them secret depending on certain factors in their societies. These factors affect girls and boys differently. If girls’ schools and religions are against same sex attractions, they pose the greatest obstacles to girls who experience same sex attractions. These factors were not listed as affecting boys as much. The researchers suggest that maybe this is because not only are some religions against same-sex attraction, but they also encourage traditional roles for women and do not believe that women can carry out these roles as lesbians. Schools may affect girls more than boys because strong emphasis is placed on girls to date boys, and many school activities place high importance on heterosexuality (such as cheerleading). Additionally, the idea of not conforming to typical male gender roles inhibited many boys from openly expressing their same-sex attraction. The worry of conforming to gender roles didn’t inhibit girls from expressing their same-gender preferences as much, because society is generally more flexible about their gender expression.|$|E
500|$|... "Homer Goes to College" [...] is {{the third}} episode of The Simpsons fifth season. It {{originally}} aired on the Fox network in the United States on October 14, 1993. In the episode, Homer's lack of a college degree is revealed and he is sent to Springfield University to pass a nuclear physics class. Homer, who bases his perception of college on comedy films and TV shows, goofs around and is sent {{to a group of}} boys for tutoring.

500|$|Despite being a Tamil, it was {{not until}} 1978 he worked in a Tamil film when he signed up as the cinematographer for J. Mahendran's directorial debut Mullum Malarum (1978). Apart from {{handling}} the cinematography, Mahendra involved himself in other aspects such as screenwriting, casting, editing and direction in the film. After completing Mullum Malarum, Mahendra decided to work on his second directorial venture, this time in Tamil. He named the film Azhiyadha Kolangal (1979), which according to him was [...] "partly autobiographical". Inspired from the 1971 American film Summer of '42, Azhiyadha Kolangal was a coming-of-age film that dealt with the story of three adolescent <b>boys</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> in the awakening of sexuality. Although it was controversial for its theme, it was a box-office success. During this time he did the cinematography of K. Vishwanath's Telugu film Sankarabharanam (1979) {{which turned out to be}} a major critical and commercial success.|$|E

500|$|Serving as {{executive}} producers {{in addition to}} writers throughout the entire series, Schooley and McCorkle oversaw the show for its entire duration to maintain consistency. As executive producers, Schooley and McCorkle were mostly involved in the writing process, focusing mainly on plot and dialogue, while storyboarding was chiefly handled by Loter. The writing staff consisted of both Disney Channel employees and freelance writers. Much of the series is based on both Schooley and McCorkle's own experiences growing up as teenagers in high school. Although essentially a comedy series, Schooley and McCorkle also combined elements of adventure, relationships and humor in order to appeal to both <b>boys,</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> primarily interested in action, and girls, who are more-so attracted to relationships and character development, aware of [...] "ancient truisms" [...] surrounding the belief that boys are generally less likely to watch a series starring a female lead, while girls seldom exhibit such reservations when the casting situation is reversed. Without alienating younger viewers, to whom the show refuses to [...] "talk down", the writing in Kim Possible is [...] "a little older than" [...] that of traditional Disney animated series. While avoiding adult references, Schooley and McCorkle opted for a fast-paced sitcom-style dialogue and rhythm that attracted adult viewers instead, ultimately resulting in teleplays that were typically five pages longer than traditional Disney Channel scripts. Additionally, the show heavily parodies the popular James Bond films. Kim Possibles showrunners were heavily influenced by Marvel Comics, particularly the Spider-Man, Fantastic Four and X-Men comic book series. One particularly strong influence is found in Dr. Drakken and James Possible's former friendship, whose relationship closely mirrors that of the Fantastic Fours Victor von Doom/Doctor Doom and Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic, respectively.|$|E
