We find that this effect is important, and suggest that institutional features of resource allocation in public research may have serious implications for long term divergence in research performance. We also find that to maximise the total expected publications of the programme about 85 % of its budget should be allocated to the top quartile of the selected units (about 10 % of applicants) ranked according to past publications. Our estimated elasticity of publications on budget is 0. 6, and we find evidence of a trade-off between publications and "industrial transferability": all else held constant, projects conducted with industrial applications in mind produce about 20 % fewer publications.

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} the "production function" for scientific research publications {{in the field}} of biotechnology. it utilises an exceptionally rich and comprehensive data set pertaining to the universe of research groups that applied to a 1989 - 1993 research programme in biotechnology and <b>bio-instrumentation,</b> sponsored by the ltalian National Research Council, CNR. A structural model of the resource allocation process in scientific research guides the selection of instruments in the econometric analysis, and controls for selectivity bias effects on estimates based on the performance of funded research units. The average elasticity of research output with respect to the research budget is estimated to be 0. 6; but, for a small fraction of groups led by highly prestigious Pls this elasticity approaches 1. These estimates imply, conditional on the distribution of observed productivity, that a more unequal distribution of research funds would increase research output in the short-run. Past research publication performance is found to have an important effect on expected levels of grant funding, and hence on the unit's current productivity in terms of (quality adjusted) publications. The results show that the productivity of aggregate resource expenditures supporting scientific research is critically dependent on the institutional mechanisms and criteria employed in the allocation of such resources. ...|$|E

40|$|Small scale {{unmanned}} aerial vehicles (UAVs) {{have proven}} {{themselves to be}} useful, but often too noisy for certain operations due to their rotary motors. This project examined the feasibility of using an almost silent linear actuator to power a flapping wing UAV. In order to this, a wing was designed and installed into a test set-up to replicate normal flight conditions of flapping wing flight (FWF). The designs of the wing, the test set-up and the actual experiments were biomimetic, looking to approximate the flight of real birds. The main goal {{of this study was}} to characterize a novel new linear actuator being developed in the <b>Bio-Instrumentation</b> Lab at MIT based on important parameters for FWF including the mounting position, the frequency of oscillation and the amplitude of oscillation of the wing. Ultimately the linear actuator performed well under all of the tests and was only limited by the control software. When the frequency and amplitude of oscillation were raised, the force on the actuator increased. The mounting position ended up not having a correlation with the force on the actuator, leading one to believe that it is not a critical parameter for this actuator-wing system. by Christopher L.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to develop an {{optimized}} nozzle for the needle-free injection device currently under construction in MIT's <b>Bio-Instrumentation</b> Laboratory. Initial predictions from ANSYS, a finite element modeling program, indicated that the injection performance could be noticeably improved with a new nozzle design. After running several flow simulations, a final nozzle design was selected, and a strategy was developed to manufacture the new nozzle. The new nozzle {{was placed in the}} injection device and measurements of the jet velocity were recorded via a high speed camera. A 2 mm long nozzle with a contoured profile consisting of a linear segment tangent to an arc segment at the nozzle exit produced an exit velocity of 45. 5 m/s {{at the end of the}} injection stroke. This showed almost a 19 percent increase in velocity compared to the older nozzle which produced 38. lm/s upon termination of the injection cycle. However, the results of the new nozzle vary from injection to injection. Thus there is a need for continued testing in the future, and possibly more refined measuring techniques such as depth of penetration into the gel or developing improvements with the current video setup. by Gabriel Nestor Sanchez.

40|$|For {{the twelve}} {{thousand}} annual cases of traumatic {{spinal cord injury}} (TSCI), there are limited treatment options. Basic supportive care is combined with a twenty-four hour regimen of high-dose methylprednisolone administered within eight hours post injury. This regimen is thought to help moderate further inflammatory damage, but the motor recovery results are marginal and the therapy highly debated. ^ Discoveries in neural regeneration have shown that applied electrical fields (EFs) {{have the ability to}} enhance and guide new neuronal growth. Research into EF-stimulated growth and the implantable systems used to establish EFs has generated promising new medical therapies for TSCI. However, these discoveries have progressed without the quantification of stimulus amplitude, EF strength, or electrode-tissue interface stability. Quantitative analyses of EF strength and the electrode-tissue interface have relied on calculated models and in vivo studies using large-scale, non-implantable <b>bio-instrumentation,</b> respectively. ^ To better realize the potential for electrically-stimulated CNS repair, we present a novel implantable, wirelessly-programmable prosthesis with injury-site EF surveillance, multi-waveform stimulation, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Interface impedance measures the in vivo response to electrical stimulation over time. Wireless data transfer to and from an external system and a customized graphical user interface (GUI) add to patient mobility and complete the system loop. We have conducted in vitro and in vivo studies to validate system accuracy and biocompatibility. Efficacy differences between traditional oscillating direct current (dc) and alternating current (ac) stimulation were evaluated based on their quantified effect on functional and anatomical recovery in a TSCI rat model. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{steerable}} catheters {{have demonstrated}} many advantages {{to overcome the}} limitations of the conventional catheters in the minimally invasive surgery. The motion and force transmission from the proximal end to distal tip of the catheter have significant effects to the efficiency and safety of surgery. While the force information between the catheter and the body (e. g., vessel) can be obtained by mounting sensors on the distal tip of the catheter, this would be more intrusive and less reliable than the one without the sensors, which is described in this disseration. In addition, the small diameters of the catheters may also restrict the idea of mounting sensors on the distal tip. The other approach to obtain the force information is to infer it from the information outside the body. This will demand an accurate mathematical model that describes the force and motion relation called kinetic model, and unfortunately, such a kinetic model is not available in the literature. In this dissertation, a kinetic model for steerable catheters is presented wich captures the following characteristics of the steerable catheter, namely (1) the geometrical non-linear behavior of the catheter in motion, (2) the deformable pathway, (3) the friction between the catheter and the pathyway, and (4) the contact between the catheter and pathway. A non-linear finite element system (SPACAR) was employed to capture these characteristics. A test-bed was built and an experiment was carried out to verify the developed kinetic model. The following conclusions can be drawn from this dissertation: (1) the developed kinetic model is accurte in comparison with those in literature; (2) the Dahl friction model, the LuGre friction model and the simplified LuGre friction model are able to capture the friction behavior between the catheter and the pathway but the Coulomb friction model fails (as it cannot capture the hysteresis property which has a significant influence on the behavior of the catheter); (3) the developed kinetic model has the potential of being used to optimize the design and operation of steerable catheters with several salient findings that (3 a) the maximal contact force between the catheter and the pathway occurs on the tip of the distal part or the connecting part between the distal part and catheter body of the catheter and (3 b) the rigidity and length of the distal part are crucial structural parameters that affect the motion and force transmission significantly. There are several contributions made by this dissertation. In the field of the steerable catheter, biomechanics and <b>bio-instrumentation,</b> the contributions are summarized in the following: (1) the approach to develop the kinetic model of the steerable catheter in a complex work environment is useful to model other similar compliant medical devices, such as endoscope; (2) the kinetic model of the steerable catheter can provide the force information to improve the efficiency and safety of MIS (minimally invastive surgery) and to realize the “doctor-assisted” catheter-based MIS procedure; (3) the kinetic model can provide accurate data for developing other simplified models for the steerable catheters in their corresponding work environments for realizing the robotic-based fully automated MIS procedure. (4) The kinetic model of the steerable catheter and the test-bed with the corresponding instruments and methods for the kinetic and kinematic measurements are a useful design validation in the steerable catheter technology {{as well as for the}} training of physicians to perform the catheter-based interventional procedure by adding more complex anatomic phantoms. In the field of continuum manipulator and continuum robots, the approach to develop the kinetic model is useful to model other manipulators and robots, such as snake-like robots...|$|E
