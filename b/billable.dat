He contrasted how telephone billing considers every action a separately <b>billable</b> event, while the Internet model is based on a flat fee for best-effort delivery in connectionless mode transmission.|$|E

50|$|It {{was assumed}} in the Hyde Amendment that <b>billable</b> hours would be capped at $125 per hour. However, since {{the work done}} {{in this case was}} by highly-paid attorneys, the rate of <b>billable</b> hours was {{considerably}} higher than $125. Judge Merryday scrutinized the 11,251 <b>billable</b> hours submitted by Cohen and associates and subtracted only 310 hours from the total. Cohen argued that because of the complexity of the case and its successful outcome, the rate of <b>billable</b> hours should be multiplied by three. (That is a standard practice in civil cases.) The judge declined to multiply the fees but agreed that a substantial increase in fees was warranted in this case, setting an important precedent, as an increase in fees had never previously been allowed in a Hyde Amendment case.|$|E

50|$|The second way to {{calculate}} the utilization rate {{is to take the}} number of <b>billable</b> hours and divide by a fixed number of hours per week. For example, if 32 hours of <b>billable</b> time are recorded in a fixed 40-hour week, the utilization rate would then be 32 / 40 = 80%.|$|E
