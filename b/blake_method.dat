50|$|<b>Blake</b> {{discussed}} three <b>methods</b> for {{calculating the}} canonical form: exhaustion of implicants, iterated consensus, and multiplication. The iterated consensus method was rediscovered by Samson and Mills, Quine, and Bing.|$|R
25|$|Frustrated {{with this}} <b>method,</b> <b>Blake</b> {{seems to have}} begun {{thinking}} about a new method of publishing at least as early as 1784, as in that year a rough description of what would become relief etching appears in his unpublished satire, An Island in the Moon. Around the same time, George Cumberland had been experimenting with a method {{to allow him to}} reproduce handwriting via an etched plate, and <b>Blake</b> incorporated Cumberland's <b>method</b> into his own relief etching; treating the text as handwritten script rather than mechanical letterpress, and thus allowing him to make it a component of the image.|$|R
2500|$|Chapter 11 {{is seen as}} {{the most}} {{important}} chapter by many critics insofar as it contains early versions of [...] "The Little Boy lost", [...] "Holy Thursday", and [...] "Nurse's Song", all of which would appear in Songs of Innocence in 1789. This chapter also includes an incomplete description of <b>Blake's</b> <b>method</b> of illuminated printing. The description begins in the middle, with at least one preceding page missing, as Quid explains his method to Mrs. Gittipin; [...] "... them Illuminating the Manuscript-Ay said she that would be excellent. Then said he I would have all the writing Engraved instead of Printed & at every other leaf a high finish'd print all in three Volumes folio, & sell them a hundred pounds a piece. They would Print off two thousand then said she whoever will not have them will be ignorant fools & will not deserve to live." [...] Damon has speculated that Blake may have destroyed the missing page(s) so as to preserve the secret of his method.|$|R

A modern interpretation of Tom Blake's work is the perimeter stringer method used by some manufacturers, utilizing laminated rails as stringers connected {{with a series of}} plywood ribs. This skeleton is then sheathed with 5mm-thick wood strips, creating a fast hollow board with good flex properties.|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} the results of a detailed study {{of the effects of the}} 1883 earthquake, which occurred at the island of Ischia (Gulf of Naples) and produced the total destruction of buildings in the epicentral area (Casamicciola town). Despite the moderate magnitude, this event was characterised by very high intensities (Imax = XI degree MCS) mainly due to the shallow depth of the source. The study of the earthquake shows that the intensities, which decreased rapidly with distance, were affected by source directivity, according to the causative fault geometry and tectonic structures, while local amplification of damage was observed where soft soils outcrop. The attenuation of seismic intensity with distance was evaluated using the well-known relation of intensity versus epicentral distance (<b>Blake’s</b> <b>method).</b> The diverse gradients of attenuation, observed in different directions, were ascribed to the various geological features of the shallow crust of the island. In order to evaluate the role of geology in the damage level, we computed different attenuation models for stiff and soft soils outcropping on the island. A systematic local amplification of about 1 MCS degree associated to the presence of reworked tuffs was obtained. This study also shows the influence of geological conditions on the evaluation of macroseismic data and supplies useful elements to derive a predictive map of potential site effects...|$|R
40|$|William　Blakeの作品AmericaはOrcを主人公として書かれ，EuropeはEnitharmonを中心人物としている。この二人の影に隠れて一見，重要でないように思えるが実は見過してはならない女性が一人いる。それは両作品の“Preludium”に登場する“nameless　shadowy　female”である。この小論では謎めいたこの女性にスポットを当て，両作品の中で彼女の担う役割は何かを考察してみたいと思う。While Orc is {{the hero}} in America,and Enitharmon is the heroine in Europe,there is also a“nameless shadowy female”who appears in the“Preludium”sections of both America and Europe. She does {{not at first}} appear to bear a {{significant}} role in the stories. However,Blake uses her as a bridge between Cisions of the Daughters of Albion,in which through the voice of Oothoon he openly expresses his concern over the rights of women and slaves,and these two later works. The“nameless shadowy female”in America and Europe symbolizes the oppressed-slaves and women-and is in reality the fallen form of Vala,who is the Emanation of Luvah. (Orc is Luvah's earthly form.) A nameless,shadowy female not only increases the aura of mystery in America and Europe,but the words“nameless”and “shadowy”are also <b>Blake's</b> <b>method</b> of injecting the reality of the situation suffered by slaves and women in that age. She may appear frail and unimportant at first sight,but she plays an indispensable role in setting Orc free from his chains,thereby enabling him to appear in America and France as the fire of revolution. The fact that Blake assigns her such an important role reflects his high expectations for the hidden potential of slaves and women. Thus,by placing the“nameless shadowy female”in America and Europe,Blake expresses his hope that rebellions like the American and French Revolutions will also free slaves and women,whose rights and dignity have long been denied,and once again restore them to their rightful positions...|$|R
2500|$|An Island in the Moon is {{the name}} {{generally}} assigned to an untitled, unfinished prose satire by William Blake, written in late 1784.

Although they include some of Blake’s best-known images, they have not been studied before in their entirety or {{from the point of view}} of analysing the techniques and <b>methods</b> <b>Blake</b> had used. My study will show how Blake executed these truly impressive prints in terms of materials, method and motives. The first half of the thesis deals with the materialistic aspects of Blake’s colour printing. In chapter one tracing the controversial two-pull discussion to the root, I will make clear the focus points as well as revealing the early tradition of experimental criticism on <b>Blake’s</b> colour printing <b>method.</b> Focusing on two important critics, W. Graham Robertson and Ruthven Todd, and the periods they lived, I attempt to reveal the role they played in a wider context. Also I show how the tradition of Blake’s art was inherited directly through the Ancients to the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, which leads to Robertson and Todd. In the second chapter I deal with the development of Blake’s colour printing experiments. It is obvious that the Twelve Large Colour Prints were produced as a result of Blake’s series of colour printing experiments, starting with monocolour simple prints, going through the illuminated books progressing with more colours and higher skills...|$|R
30|$|Hydraulic {{conductivity}} (infiltration under a unit hydraulic gradient) {{was measured}} using a Mini Disc infiltrometer (MDI; Decagon Devices, Inc., Pullman, Washington, USA) and field methods of Robichaud et al. (2008). Three measurements were made within each burn scar in September 2010, about 0.5 m from the water repellency test locations. Postfire ash layers were carefully removed before infiltration rates were measured on the mineral soil surface. Infiltration was calculated using methods provided in the MDI User’s Manual Version 6, with a suction rate of 2 cm for the LTB soils. Soil bulk density was determined using the hollow-core <b>method</b> (<b>Blake</b> and Hartge 1986) on three 0 cm to 5 cm depth samples collected {{near the center of}} each pile.|$|R
2500|$|Relief etching was {{the same}} basic method used for woodcutting, and copper relief etching had been practised in the early eighteenth century by Elisha Kirkall, but Blake {{was the first to}} use such a method to create both words and designs mixed {{together}} on the same plate. Apart from the unique aesthetic effects possible, a major advantage of relief etching was that Blake could print the material himself. Because the text was in relief, the pressure needed for printing was constant, unlike in intaglio printing, where different pressures were needed to force the paper into the furrows, depending on size. Additionally, intaglio etchings and engravings were printed with great pressure, but in relief etching, because the printed material was a raised surface rather than incised lines, considerably less pressure was required. As such, relief etching tackled the problem of the division of labour of publishing. <b>Blake's</b> new <b>method</b> was autographic; [...] "it permitted – indeed promoted – a seamless relationship between conception and execution rather than the usual divisions between invention and production embedded in eighteenth-century print technology, and its economic and social distinctions among authors, printers, artists and engravers. Like drawings and manuscripts, Blake's relief etchings were created by the direct and positive action of the author/artist's hand without intervening processes". Blake served as artist, engraver, printer and publisher.|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} “Structure From Motion” (SFM) aims at {{recovering}} the 3 D shape and motion of flexible objects from their 2 D projections on images. Assuming orthographic projection, Tomasi and Kanade introduced a closed form {{solution to this}} problem. Later, Bascle and <b>Blake</b> specialized this <b>method</b> to the single image case, assuming that the 3 D object belongs to a Linear Object Class for which the model was pre-computed. We present, in this paper, an alternative to this approach which improves {{the accuracy of the}} recovery. The previous approach is based on the factorization of a matrix using the low-rank constraints of the problem. Instead of this global estimate, we advocate the use of a selective estimate which we introduce in this paper. We detail both methods and assess their performance quantitatively and qualitatively, we present an efficient implementation of our algorithm and verify the theoretical results by Monte-Carlo simulations and experiment on photographs...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} William Blake’s Songs of Innocence and Experience, {{and on the}} way Blake’s books allow us to reimagine the {{materiality}} of the book, that is of the book as an art object. Blake’s technical and creative methods allowed him to create reproducible yet unique objects. Although there are several copies of the Songs, there are important differences among them that individualize each object. By focusing on the book’s materiality, <b>Blake’s</b> graphic <b>methods,</b> the object’s relation to the British book market, and the physical qualities of the book, we will see how Blake’s books lead us to reconsider the notions of original and copy, uniqueness and reproduction, and of the book itself. Esta tesis se enfoca en el libro Songs of Innocence and Experience, de William Blake, y en la manera en la que nos permite reimaginar la materialidad del libro. Los métodos técnicos y creativos de Blake le permitieron crear objetos que son únicos, a pesar de ser reproducibles, y sus libros no operan solamente como medios, sino también son objetos de arte. A pesar de que hay varias copias de Songs of Innocence and Experience, cada copia es diferente a las demás, lo que individualiza a cada objeto. Al enfocarse en la materialidad del libro, los métodos gráficos de Blake, su relación con el mercado de libros británico y las cualidades físicas del libro, se buscará entender cómo los libros de Blake nos llevan a repensar las nociones de original y copia, unicidad y reproducibilidad y del libro como tal...|$|R
5000|$|Series creator Terry Nation pitched Blake's 7 to the BBC as [...] "The Dirty Dozen in space", a {{reference}} to the 1967 Robert Aldrich movie in which a disparate group of convicts are sent on a suicide mission during World War II. This influence shows in that some of Blake's devotees are escaped convicts (Avon, Vila, Gan and Jenna). Blake's 7 also draws much of its inspiration from the legend of Robin Hood. Blake's devotees are not a band of [...] "Merry Men". His diverse crew includes a corrupt computer genius (Avon), a smuggler (Jenna), a thief (Vila), a murderer (Gan), a telepathic guerrilla soldier (Cally), a computer with {{a mind of its own}} (Zen) and another wayward computer (Orac). Later additions were: a naive weapons expert (Dayna), a mercenary (Tarrant), a gunslinger (Soolin) and an obsequious computer (Slave). While Blake intends to use Liberator to strike against the Federation, the others are often reluctant soldiers—especially Avon. Blake and Avon's clashes over the command represent a conflict between idealism and cynicism, emotion and rationality, and dreams and practicality. Similar conflicts occur between other characters; the courage of Blake and Avon compared with Vila's cowardice, or Avon and Jenna's scepticism of Blake's ideals compared with Gan's unswerving loyalty, <b>Blake's</b> mass murdering <b>methods</b> compared with Avon's targeted and less destructive methods.|$|R
40|$|This is {{the first}} {{full-length}} study to be published on Blake?s influence on subsequent writers and artists since R. Bertholf and A. Levitt?s William Blake and the Moderns in 1987, and the first text to consider that influence across {{a wider range of}} cultural formats and activities such as music, film, and political thinking. Its contribution has been noted in the field and stimulated an increased interest in the study of Blake?s reception, notably in texts such as The Reception of Blake in the Orient (eds. S. Clark and S. Masashi) and Blake and Modern Literature (E. Larrissy), with citations {{in a wide range of}} articles and books that have been published on Blake in the past five years. Radical Blake for Blake studies moved considerations of reception beyond the immediate audience for Blake?s original texts. In terms of scholarship, Radical Blake draws particularly upon work undertaken in the last two decades in the fields of new historicism (Essick, Worrall, Mee, Makdisi) and what is referred to as the ?new bibliography? (Bentley, Viscomi, Essick), areas that changed our understanding of <b>Blake?s</b> ideas and <b>methods.</b> Whereas earlier reception studies tended to concentrate on formal characteristics that indicated the influence of Blake?s art and poetry, the methodology employed within Radical Blake emphasises the significance of cultural materialist contexts for new texts, supported in many cases by archival research to locate and identify the new areas where Blake?s art transformed and inspired artistic and literary production...|$|R
