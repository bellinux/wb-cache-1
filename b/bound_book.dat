5|$|Carnivàle: The Complete First Season was {{released}} as a widescreen six-disc Region 1 DVD box set on December 7, 2004, {{one month before}} the premiere of the second season. It was distributed by HBO Home Video and contained three audio commentaries and a behind-the-scenes featurette. The outer slipcover of the Region 1 set was made of a thick cardboard to mimic a <b>bound</b> <b>book.</b> The same set {{was released}} with less elaborate packaging in Region 2 on March 7, 2005, and in Region 4 on May 11, 2005.|$|E

Each album was also available in a Super Deluxe Edition Box Set, which included the remastered album and bonus disc on both CD and 180-gram vinyl, a high-definition audio download card of all content at 96kHz/24 bit, a hard <b>bound</b> <b>book</b> filled with rare and previously unseen photos and memorabilia, and a high quality print of the original album cover.|$|E
25|$|Many {{of the new}} {{religions}} {{relied on}} {{the emergence of the}} parchment codex (<b>bound</b> <b>book)</b> over the papyrus volumen (scroll), the former allowing for quicker access to key materials and easier portability than the fragile scroll, thus fueling the rise of synoptic exegesis, papyrology.

25|$|Trimming {{separates}} {{the leaves of}} the <b>bound</b> <b>book.</b> A sheet folded in quarto will have folds at the spine and also across the top, so the top folds must be trimmed away before the leaves can be turned. A quire folded in octavo or greater may also require that the other two sides be trimmed. Deckle edge, or Uncut books are untrimmed or incompletely trimmed, and may be of special interest to book collectors.|$|E
25|$|Though {{almost any}} {{existing}} book can be repaired to some extent, only books that were originally sewn can be rebound by resewing. Repairs or restorations are often done {{to emulate the}} style of the original binding. For new works, some publishers print unbound manuscripts which a binder can collate and bind, but often an existing commercially <b>bound</b> <b>book</b> is pulled, or taken apart, in order to be given a new binding. Once the textblock of the book has been pulled, it can be rebound in almost any structure; a modern suspense novel, for instance, could be rebound to look like a 16th-century manuscript. Bookbinders may bind several copies of the same text, giving each copy a unique appearance.|$|E

He won the National Book Critics Circle Award and the Ralph J. Gleason Music Book Award in 1993 {{for his book}} The Land Where the Blues Began, connecting {{the story of the}} origins of blues music with the prevalence of forced labor in the pre-World War II South (especially on the Mississippi levees). Lomax also received a posthumous Grammy Trustees Award for his lifetime achievements in 2003.

[...] The work became a standard reference used by ornithologists for decades after Ridgway's death, as well as specialists in such wide-ranging fields as mycology, philately, and food coloring. [...] The book named 1,115 colors, illustrated with painted samples reproduced on 53 plates. [...] Special care was taken to ensure consistency of color reproduction across the edition, as well as the prevention of fading. [...] The color samples were printed as large sheets by A.

500|$|Smith, Joseph Coe, and Simeon Andrews soon {{purchased}} the four mummies {{and at least}} five papyrus documents for $2,400. In October 1835, he began [...] "translating an alphabet to the Book of Abraham, and arranging a grammar of the Egyptian language as practiced by the ancients." [...] In doing so, Smith worked closely with Cowdery and Phelps. The result of this attempted deciphering was a collection of documents and manuscripts {{now known as the}} Kirtland Egyptian papers. One of these manuscripts was a <b>bound</b> <b>book</b> simply titled [...] "Grammar & Aphabet of the Egyptian Language", which contained Smith's interpretations of the Egyptian glyphs. The first part of the book focuses almost entirely on deciphering Egyptian characters, and the second part deals with a form of astronomy that was supposedly practiced by the ancient Egyptians. The majority of the pages in this tome were penned in July 1835, and of note, most of the writing in the book was written—not by Smith—but rather by a scribe taking down what Smith said. The [...] "Egyptian Alphabet" [...] manuscript is particularly important because it illustrates how Smith attempted to translate the papyri. First, the characters on the papyri were transcribed onto the left-hand side of the book. Next, a postulation as to what the symbols sounded like was devised. Finally, an English interpretation of the symbol was provided. Smith's subsequent translation of the papyri takes on the form of five [...] "degrees" [...] of interpretation; each degree represents a deeper and more complex level of interpretation.|$|E
500|$|In 1986, Congress {{passed the}} Firearm Owners Protection Act (FOPA), which relaxed certain {{controls}} in the Gun Control Act and permitted licensed firearm dealers to conduct business at gun shows. Specifically, FOPA made it legal for FFL holders to make private sales, provided the firearm {{was transferred to}} the licensee's personal collection at least one year prior to the sale. Hence, when a personal firearm is sold by an FFL holder, no background check or Form 4473 is required by federal law. According to the ATF, FFL holders are required to keep a record of such sales in a <b>bound</b> <b>book.</b> The United States Department of Justice (USDOJ) said the stated purpose of FOPA was to ensure the GCA did not [...] "place any undue or unnecessary federal restrictions or burdens on law-abiding citizens, but it opened many loopholes through which illegal gun traffickers can slip." [...] The scope of those who [...] "engage in the business" [...] of dealing in firearms (and are therefore required to have a license) was narrowed to include only those who devote [...] "time, attention, and labor to dealing in firearms as a regular course of trade or business with the principal objective of livelihood and profit through the repetitive purchase and resale of firearms." [...] FOPA excluded those who buy and sell firearms to [...] "enhance a personal collection" [...] or for a [...] "hobby," [...] or who [...] "sell all or part of a personal collection." [...] According to the USDOJ, this new definition made {{it difficult for them to}} identify offenders who could claim they were operating as [...] "hobbyists" [...] trading firearms from their personal collection. Efforts to reverse a key feature of FOPA by requiring criminal background checks and purchase records on private sales at gun shows were unsuccessful.|$|E
