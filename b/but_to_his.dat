5|$|Because {{of their}} concerns, Aflaq kept quiet. <b>But</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> astonishment, keeping quiet {{caused him to}} lose his post as Secretary General – Aflaq was succeeded as Secretary General of the National Command by Munif al-Razzaz, a Jordanian of Syrian origin. However, the power between the two camps was {{unexpectedly}} reshuffled when Amin al-Hafiz defected to Aflaq's camp. In contrast to other military officers al-Hafiz had very little influence within or outside the party. Al-Hafiz's defection led to a resurgence of activity within Aflaq's faction, al-Bitar and Umran were brought back from Spain {{to form a new}} government.|$|E
5|$|In 2017, Douglas Stenton, {{director}} for heritage in the Nunavut territory in north eastern Canada, suggested that {{four sets of}} European human remains found could possibly be women. He initially suspected that DNA testing would not offer up anything more, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> surprise they registered {{that there was no}} 'Y' chromosomal element to the DNA. Stenton acknowledged that women were known to have served in the Royal Navy in the 17th, 18th and early 19th centuries, but he also pointed out that {{it could be that the}} DNA had simply degraded as further tests proved ambiguous. Stenton also stated that whilst the probability of four disguised women aboard the two ships was very, very low; he could not rule it out completely.|$|E
5|$|The {{young man}} was not certain if he should accept the offer Freddy Carlone had made, so he {{returned}} to Canonsburg to talk the matter over with his father. Perry expected he would tell {{him to stay in}} the barber business, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> surprise, the senior Como told him if he did not take the opportunity, he might never know whether or not he could be a professional singer. The decision was also made with an eye on finances; Como earned around $125 per week from his barber shop while the job with Carlone paid $28 per week. Roselle was willing to travel with her husband and the band, but the salary was not enough to support two people on the road. Perry and Roselle were married in Meadville on July 31, 1933; four days later, Como joined Freddy Carlone's band and began working with them. Roselle returned home to Canonsburg; her new husband would be on the road for the next 18 months.|$|E

25|$|Mat Salleh, however, is {{not always}} seen as a hero. Many writers of this {{rebellion}} see Mat Salleh as a lone crusader and / or an opportunist solely interested in restoring his precolonial social position of power. To the British, he was a rebel and troublemaker, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> supporters, he {{was and still is}} a warrior.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, {{research}} has established that Arnold's success was {{not due to}} the form of detent escapement, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> original methods of adjusting the balance spring for positional errors by manipulating the overcoil terminal curve. For obvious reasons, Arnold tried to keep these methods secret, certainly it is recorded that he clearly expressed his concerns about possible plagiarism to Earnshaw, warning him {{in no uncertain terms}} not to use his Helical balance spring.|$|E
25|$|Under Peter I (10381041, 10441046) ancient pagan {{sentiment}} {{erupted in}} a rebellion of elemental force and a country-wide slaughter of clergymen began in 1046. Among {{the victims were}} Bishop Gerard of Csanád and his two fellow bishops. However, the rebels were not without opposition as {{the majority of the}} kingdom's leading men did not wish to return to paganism. Accordingly, they recalled Vazul's exiled sons, and offered the crown not to the pagan Levente, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> younger brother, Andrew who had converted and become a devout Christian.|$|E

25|$|Time {{independent}} {{solutions to}} field equations do not emit radiation, because a time independent background conserves energy. Based on this principle, Hawking {{set out to}} show that black holes do not radiate. <b>But,</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> surprise, a careful analysis convinced him that they do, and {{in just the right}} way to come to equilibrium with a gas at a finite temperature. Hawking's calculation fixed the constant of proportionality at 1/4; the entropy of a black hole is one quarter its horizon area in Planck units.|$|E
25|$|As Universal Migrator {{had enough}} content {{to form a}} two-CD album, Arjen made a key {{decision}} to sell each disc as a separate release. He believed his fans to be fundamentally {{divided into two groups}} by genre of choice, being either progressive rock or heavy metal fans. The Dream Sequencer was meant to appeal to the prog enthusiasts, and Flight of the Migrator to the metal fans, so that each could simply purchase the album of their choice, if so inclined, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> surprise, fans bought and loved both albums.|$|E
25|$|Biblical scholar Michael D. Coogan {{discusses}} {{this as an}} inaccuracy regarding Mordecai's age. In the passage, either Mordecai or {{his great-grandfather}} Kish is identified as having been exiled from Jerusalem to Babylon by King Nebuchadnezzar (in 597 BC). If this refers to Mordecai, {{he would have had}} to live over a century to have witnessed the events described in the Book of Esther (assuming the biblical Ahasuerus is indeed Xerxes I). However, the verse may be read as referring not to Mordecai's exile to Babylon, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> great-grandfather Kish's exile—a reading which many accept.|$|E

25|$|Roach invited President Rutherford B. Hayes and {{the entire}} U.S. Congress to the launch of City of Para in 1878, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> consternation, his {{attempts}} to secure subsidies from the U.S. and Brazilian governments were both to meet with failure. Meanwhile, Mallory's misgivings that the ships were {{too big for the}} available trade proved correct, and Roach was faced with cutthroat competition from a British shipping line. After several years of increasing losses, he was forced in 1881 to sell the ships and wind up the Line.|$|E
25|$|The {{family lived}} with their {{maternal}} grandmother. As a big, dairy-fed American kid who spoke very little Japanese, George had trouble fitting in, and found comfort in art. His grandparents introduced him to traditional Japanese art forms such as Kabuki and Noh drama, Sumi-e painting, calligraphy, wood-block printing, ceramics, flower arranging, and the tea ceremony; at the same time, he studied European and American art, and developed a lifelong love of Western classical music. He showed promise as an artist, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> father's disappointment he was a mediocre student with little interest in joining the family business.|$|E
25|$|Confederate {{reinforcements}} from Heth's and Mahone's divisions arrived {{while the}} Confederate artillery under Col. William Pegram softened up the Union position. The final attack began around 5:30p.m. by six brigades against Miles's position and it {{broke through the}} northwest corner of the Union fortifications; although the Union defensive fire was fierce enough to keep the Confederates at bay, suddenly two Union regiments panicked and bolted for the rear, opening a gap. Miles ordered his reserve brigade under Col. Horace Rugg to close the gap, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> astonishment, Rugg's men fell prone and refused to open fire. Heth personally led the charge through the earthworks, tussling with Sgt. Thomas Minton of the 26th North Carolina about who would carry the colors forward.|$|E

25|$|Maroto left England a {{few days}} after Don Carlos's retinue had done the same, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> {{surprise}} he was detained and arrested in Calais and from there was brought to Paris, where he was imprisoned in contradiction of all human rights; the arrest was not justified by any crime or lack of documentation. When he was freed a short time later he asked for a passport so he could leave for Italy, although he stopped for some time in Nice to regain his health and to plan a way to enter Spain instead of going to Italy. He was able effortlessly to go through southern France and arrive at Bordeaux. From there he went to Navarre, aided and protected by French Carlists.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} semi–main {{event of the}} evening, La Sociedad member Jeff Jarrett {{challenged}} El Zorro for the AAA Mega Championship. Like the other matches involving TNA workers, the match was refereed by La Sociedads own referee, Hijo del Tirantes, who showed bias towards Jarrett throughout the match. On several occasions Jarrett attempted to get El Zorro to submit with an ankle lock, the signature hold of his TNA rival Kurt Angle, but when {{he realized he was}} not going to succeed in his attempt, he took advantage of a distraction from his wife Karen and smashed El Zorro with his signature guitar, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> surprise, only managed to get a two count out of the following pinfall. Jarrett then took a hold of El Zorro's kendo stick, hit him with it and then put it across his throat and performed his finishing maneuver The Stroke to become the new AAA Mega Champion and the first ever American to hold the title. Jarrett left the ring as fans in attendance started to fill it with bottles.|$|E
25|$|Two years later, {{the young}} {{family moved to}} his late {{paternal}} grandfather's property, 'Burnside', about 10 miles north of Baltimore {{at the entrance to}} the Green Spring Valley. In 1898, his father turned Burnside into a dairy farm, with a prize herd of Guernsey cattle, though his grandfather had preferred Jerseys. Sam Shoemaker was well aware of his privileged upbringing: Mennonite Schumachers had moved from Germany, Holland and Switzerland hundreds of years earlier, converted to Quakerism under the influence of William Penn's missionaries and Anglicised their surname as they moved to Germantown, which became a Philadelphia neighborhood. One of his ancestors of the same name had twice served as Philadelphia's mayor, and his paternal grandfather (who died in 1884 and for whom both Sam's father and young Sam were named), although born in Lafourche Parish, Louisiana, made his fortune organizing the Great Western Express transportation line between Philadelphia and Baltimore. His paternal grandmother, the Victorian matriarch who raised him as an Episcopalian, was Augusta Chambers Eccleston, of Chestertown, Maryland, daughter of Maryland Court of Appeals Judge John Bowers Eccleston (1794-1860) and sister of the Rev. John H. E. Eccleston, whose Emmanuel Episcopal Church was decorated with flowers from the family's greenhouses. A more distant John C. Eccleston (1828-1912) served as a priest in Richmond County, New York. Sam's maternal grandfather, John Augustus Whitridge, had a fleet of clipper ships, although he died when Sam was 13. Shoemaker later became known for a slight southern inflection in his speech, which he attributed not to these relatives, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> lifelong friend Hen Bodley, and to James (actually Richard Hugh Gwathney), a longtime family servant, who had been born in Fredericksburg, Virginia.|$|E
