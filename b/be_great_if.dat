According to Carter, Duchovny came {{to him and said}} [...] "it <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>if</b> we had like an alien bounty hunter", an idea of which Carter approved. Spotnitz has noted that the actor cast for the role, Brian Thompson, was chosen because he had a very [...] "distinctive look" [...] about him, most notably his face and mouth.|$|E

We wanted the film to feel like a lost film of that era. If we're a footnote in the history of pulp art and Golden Age comics, that'd be enough, that'd <b>be</b> <b>great.</b> <b>If</b> we even just inspire some people to go back and investigate some of that stuff, we'd have done enough." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{founders of}} Circus Juventas, Dan and Betty Butler, met as {{teenagers}} at the Sailor Circus of Sarasota during the mid-1970s. Dan was a catcher on the flying trapeze, and Betty was an aerialist on the cloud swing. They began dating at age sixteen, {{went on to}} perform at Florida State University's Flying High Circus, and married in 1980. Dan became a successful real estate broker in Atlanta, but faced bankruptcy and chemical dependency. The couple came to reside in Minnesota because Dan Butler was receiving {{alcohol and drug abuse}} rehabilitation at Hazelden. The Butlers attended Sailor Circus reunions together and after one, in April 1994, Betty Butler wondered, [...] "Wouldn't it <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>if</b> we could do something in ?" ...|$|E

500|$|According to Lee, several core {{concepts}} {{were already}} in place from Buck and Del Vecho's early work, such as the film's [...] "frozen heart" [...] hook: [...] "That was a concept and the phrase... an act of true love will thaw a frozen heart." [...] They already knew the ending involved true love {{in the sense of}} the emotional bond between siblings, not romance, in that [...] "Anna was going to save Elsa. We didn’t know how or why." [...] Lee said Edwin Catmull, president of Disney Animation, told her early on about the film's ending: [...] "First and foremost, no matter what you have to do to the story, do it. But you have to earn that ending. If you do it will <b>be</b> <b>great.</b> <b>If</b> you don't, it will suck." ...|$|E
500|$|In contrast, Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine {{described}} it as [...] "a sappy Paula Cole-style statement of self-actualization". Jon Dolan from Rolling Stone criticized its lyrics and negatively likened them to those of Alanis Morissette. Kitty Empire from The Guardian found the song to be [...] "ridden with cliché". Mesfin Fekadu from ABC News thought both tracks were [...] "good", but stated that they [...] "could <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>if</b> Perry didn't hold back and explored more lyrically and sonically". Chris Bosman from Consequence of Sound criticized its placement on the album track listing and thought that they [...] "would stand out more if they ('By The Grace of God', and closing track 'Double Rainbow') hadn't been forced to rub elbows, thus stealing momentum and impact from each other". Carl Williott from Idolator praised the track as a [...] "nice counterpart to Roar".|$|E
500|$|The art in Ōkami {{is highly}} {{inspired}} by Japanese watercolor and wood carving {{art of the}} Ukiyo-e style, such {{as the work of}} Hokusai. Ōkami was originally planned to be rendered in a more photorealistic 3D style. However, Clover Studio determined that the more colorful sumi-e style allowed them to better convey Amaterasu's association with nature and the task of restoring it. The change was also influenced by limitations in the PS2 hardware to render the photorealistic 3D graphics. As a result of the switch to the watercolor style, the idea of the Celestial Brush came about. Atsushi Inaba, CEO of Clover, noted that [...] "Once we fixed ourselves on a graphical style and got down to the brushwork, we thought 'Wouldn't it <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>if</b> we could somehow get the player involved and participate in this artwork instead of just watching it?' That's how the idea of the Celestial Brush was born". Original concepts for enemies included the use of dinosaurs, but the designs settled onto more demon-like characters.|$|E

500|$|While {{discussing}} {{the origin of}} the title [...] "Rhythm Nation", Jackson stated she first uttered the phrase during a conversation with her producers. [...] "I thought it would <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>if</b> we could create our own nation" [...] adding that it would be [...] "one that would have a positive message and that everyone would be free to join." [...] She based the idea on the prevalence of various youth groups and organizations that are formed as a means of creating a common identity. The usage of the number [...] "1814" [...] represents the year the national anthem [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner" [...] was written. Rolling Stone emphasized the core concept is further explored in the album's opening pledge (the first track of the recording), which states: [...] "We are a nation with no geographic boundaries, bound together through our beliefs. We are like-minded individuals, sharing a common vision, pushing toward a world rid of color-lines." [...] Several critics noted that [...] "R" [...] (Rhythm) and [...] "N" [...] (Nation) are the eighteenth and fourteenth letters of the alphabet, though Jackson said this was coincidental.|$|E
500|$|A {{portion of}} the clip's premise was {{inspired}} by Jackson's then-relationship with record producer Jermaine Dupri, which was unconfirmed and had generated speculation within the media. Meyers explained, [...] "In the other video we were shooting, {{she came out of}} the trailer wearing a So So Def jacket, and that's when I got the idea, 'it would <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>if</b> you do a whole video if you look like you do now when you're going home'. It took her a minute, she thought about it, she asked JD if he'd be okay with doing the video, 'cus I was begging and I was like, 'if I could get the two of you in a simple video together, it's gonna be gold.' She asked and he said yea, and that's when my video came to life." [...] Meyers also had the idea for Dupri's cameo due to persistent rumors of their relationship circulating in the media, saying [...] "That's the whole concept here, a real simple video and then the slam dunk is JD's in the video. He hasn't been in any of her stuff and all the rumors of 'are they together, are they not together.'" ...|$|E
500|$|John Glover characterizes Lionel as a {{businessman}} who is disappointed with his son. To Glover, Lionel is this [...] "rich and powerful businessman" [...] who sees his son as a [...] "wuss" [...] and [...] "fraidy-cat". It was important to Glover that Lionel appear as human as possible; Glover {{said he does not}} want to simply [...] "twirl [...] mustache". Glover described Lionel as a man who will do whatever he needs to do to get what he wants. He characterizes Lionel as an intelligent man who can read people easily. Lionel uses that ability to further his goals. The character can also get past people's defenses and manipulate them. Glover thinks that type of power would <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>if</b> it could be used to help someone other than Lionel. Lionel's character is also connoted by the color scheme that surrounds him; the use of cold blue tones helps to evoke the [...] "sinister" [...] nature of the character. Lionel is also often portrayed in front of a white or [...] "clinical blue" [...] background. Lionel's signature mane of hair is used to symbolize his power—by growing it out and refusing to style it, Lionel attempts to show he is so powerful that he can do whatever he wants without any backlash.|$|E

500|$|... "The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace" [...] {{was written}} by John Swartzwelder, who had {{a deal with the}} {{producers}} of the show to write five scripts for season ten. Although {{he was the one who}} wrote the episode, Dan Greaney was the one who came up with the idea for it. Greaney based Homer's intense obsession with Edison on the fact that when he himself would have an obsession with something in life, he would badger and bore people with details of it. [...] "Homer's relationship to Thomas Edison's achievements is a version of my own experience of trying to communicate the experience of things you love by driving people crazy," [...] Greaney said in a DVD audio commentary for the episode. The untippable chair was also an idea of Greaney's; while working on the episode, he was leaning back in his chair and fell backwards. He casually said it would <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>if</b> there were legs on the back of the chair and someone in the writing room said that would be a great invention for Homer. Soon after coming up with the story, Greaney told it to Swartzwelder so that he could turn it into a script. Greaney said [...] "it couldn't in my best dreams have turned out as good as it did if I had written it." ...|$|E
500|$|During the {{production}} of the season, Duchovny asked Carter [...] "wouldn't it <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>if</b> we had like an alien bounty hunter?" [...] Carter was positive towards the idea and acted upon it, creating with Spotniz the character of the Alien Bounty Hunter for the two-part episodes [...] "Colony" [...] and [...] "End Game". Actor Brian Thompson auditioned for the role in a casting session, where he was competing with another actor. Spotnitz and Carter did not have much time to cast the character, but they knew this casting would be important since they intended the character to become a recurring character. Thompson was chosen according to Spotnitz because he had a very [...] "distinctive look" [...] about him, most notably his face and mouth. Megan Leitch also appeared in [...] "Colony" [...] and [...] "End Game" [...] as a grown-up clone version of Samantha Mulder, and would return to play Samantha or one of her clones over the other seasons. Carter did not want it to be the real Samantha, since that would have been [...] "straight science fiction" [...] and it was too [...] "ridiculous" [...] to give too many answers. Darren McGavin, star of , was sought out for the part of Senator Matheson in [...] "Little Green Men" [...] and Mulder's father in [...] "Colony" [...] and [...] "End Game", but the roles went to Raymond J. Barry and Peter Donat respectively, while McGavin agreed to play X-Files founder Arthur Dales in season five.|$|E
500|$|Mylod {{additionally}} {{spoke about}} filming the final {{scenes of the}} episode, the foot chase between Arya and the Waif, in the behind the scenes featurette published by HBO after the airing of the episode. Mylod stated that he did extensive research {{in order to create}} the foot chase, saying [...] "I devoured every foot chase in the history of cinema, but trying to take from that something that would fit into the blueprint of the Game of Thrones visual style, which is not necessarily the same kind of kinetic, handheld feel that you find in many contemporary thrillers. It's a much more classic frame." [...] He continued, [...] "Everything hinged from finding this very lovely, steep stairwell and thinking 'Wouldn't it <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>if</b> she leapt off that, and then tumbled down the stairs?' I had this image in my head that I wanted lots of oranges rolling down, not quite sure where that comes from, but it looked pretty." [...] Mylod also stated in a separate interview that it was a conscious decision not to show the final fight between Arya and the Waif, given that it took place in the dark, noting [...] "when the character dies in the dark, unless we switch on night-vision goggles, we're {{not going to be able}} to see that, and we're not going to stick around to hear a scream in the dark anyway. It was actually a conscious choice in the writing and I think, for me, a very elegant storytelling beat as to get that reveal a few seconds later." ...|$|E

500|$|Finding {{accommodation}} {{was one of}} {{the greatest}} challenges faced by black travelers. Not only did many hotels, motels, and boarding houses refuse to serve black customers, but thousands of towns across the United States declared themselves [...] "sundown towns," [...] which all non-whites had to leave by sunset. Huge numbers of towns across the country were effectively off-limits to African Americans. By the end of the 1960s, there were at least 10,000 sundown towns across the U.S.– including large suburbs such as Glendale, California (population 60,000 at the time); Levittown, New York (80,000); and Warren, Michigan (180,000). Over half the incorporated communities in Illinois were sundown towns. The unofficial slogan of Anna, Illinois, which had violently expelled its African-American population in 1909, was [...] "Ain't No Niggers Allowed". Even in towns which did not exclude overnight stays by blacks, accommodations were often very limited. African Americans migrating to California to find work in the early 1940s often found themselves camping by the roadside overnight for lack of any hotel accommodation along the way. They were acutely aware of the discriminatory treatment that they received. Courtland Milloy's mother, who took him and his brother on road trips when they were children, recalled that [...] "after riding all day, I'd say to myself, 'Wouldn't it be nice if we could spend the night in one of those hotels?' or, 'Wouldn't it <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>if</b> we could stop for a real meal and a cup of coffee?' We'd see the little white children jumping into motel swimming pools, and you all would be in the back seat of a hot car, sweating and fighting." ...|$|E
500|$|Andrew Hanson {{from the}} Los Angeles Times also was {{impressed}} with the cast's singing abilities, and praised the writers' risk-taking: [...] "that just goes to show how well thought out, creative, and just plain fun tonight’s “Fringe” really was. A lot of people would have pegged a 1940s film noir musical episode as a big risk, but the bigger the risk, the bigger the pay out". Rhee Dee of Pinkraygun.com commented [...] "After the revelation in the last episode, and Peter running away, this episode was a great way to express Walter’s grief and guilt about this whole situation without actually watching Walter talk about how sad and guilty he feels about everything. Walter’s story serves as a powerful metaphor for how he actually feels". Tim Grierson of New York Magazine thought the episode turned out to be simply mediocre because [...] "its noir elements weren’t incorporated in a really interesting way, and as for the musical numbers, they tended to be throwaway bits, save for “fictional” Dunham crooning “For Once in My Life” to the seemingly dying “fictional” Peter near the episode’s end". Grierson continued that [...] "If a show is going to completely throw away its usual rulebook for a fun onetime-only episode, it would <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>if</b> the writers could come up with a story as audacious as their premise. But aside from some Chinatown references, fancy threads, and mildly clever mirroring of the show’s mythology — Massive Dynamic is up to no good in this story-land world as well — 'Brown Betty' wasn’t all that enjoyable because it didn’t do a great job of capturing what generally makes Fringe enjoyable".|$|E
