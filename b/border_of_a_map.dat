50|$|The game, {{which is}} built on the Unreal Engine 3, uses the Nvidia PhysX physics engine. This allows for a destructible environment, as well as {{advanced}} cloth and water effects. The PhysX engine allows players to block passages and create new ones, allowing for more realistic gameplay. For example, after entering the upper floor <b>of</b> <b>a</b> building, a sniper can blow up the stairs behind them to block access, but conversely a rocket blast to the wall that is providing cover will leave them vulnerable. The only parts of the environment that cannot be destroyed are core gameplay objects and/or objects that line the <b>borders</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>map.</b> However, due {{to the amount of}} indestructible terrain, many actions which one might expect to be possible are not.|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a remote control robot for searching for victims inside buildings during disasters. We used the approach of searching inside buildings by displaying <b>a</b> <b>map.</b> Concerning displays, several {{studies have been done}} on constructing 3 D indoor maps from laser scan data acquired by a laser scanner. However, it is difficult to construct 3 D <b>maps</b> in <b>a</b> vast or complicated space. Conventionally, these systems display only part of the indoor architecture that the robot was able to acquire. We describe here a method to display an entire indoor architecture using mixed reality. This method can display vast or complicated space using an image. Furthermore, we developed <b>a</b> method <b>of</b> synthesizing <b>a</b> display <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 3 D <b>map</b> on <b>an</b> image by using a translation technique that recognizes the <b>borders</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 3 D <b>map</b> and <b>an</b> image. Our method allows the system to represent the entire indoor architecture seamlessly. 1...|$|R

As {{ordered by the}} British authorities, Schomburgk began British Guiana's western boundary with the new Republic of Venezuela at the mouths of the Orinoco River, although all the Venezuelan maps showed the Essequibo river as the east <b>border</b> <b>of</b> the country. <b>A</b> <b>map</b> <b>of</b> the British colony was published in 1840. Venezuela did not accept the Schomburgk Line, which placed the entire Cuyuni River basin within the colony. Venezuela protested, claiming the entire area west of the Essequibo River. Negotiations between Britain and Venezuela over the boundary began, but the two nations could reach no compromise. In 1838, Essequibo was made {{one of the three}} counties of Guiana, the other two being Berbice and Demerara. In 1850 both countries agreed not to occupy the disputed zone.|$|R
50|$|When Britain gained {{formal control}} over what is now Guyana in 1814, it also became {{involved}} in one of Latin America's most persistent border disputes. At the London Convention of 1814, the Dutch surrendered the United Colony of Demerara and Essequibo and Berbice to the British, a colony which had the Essequibo river as its west border with the Spanish colony of Venezuela. Although Spain still claimed the region, the Spanish did not contest the treaty because they were preoccupied with their own colonies' struggles for independence. In 1835 the British government asked German explorer Robert Hermann Schomburgk to map British Guiana and mark its boundaries. As ordered by the British authorities, Schomburgk began British Guiana's western boundary with Venezuela {{at the mouth of}} the Orinoco River, although all the Venezuelan maps showed the Essequibo river as the east <b>border</b> <b>of</b> the country. <b>A</b> <b>map</b> <b>of</b> the British colony was published in 1840.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{investigate}} topological watersheds [1]. One of our main results {{is a necessary}} and sufficient condition for <b>a</b> <b>map</b> G to be <b>a</b> watershed <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>map</b> F, this condition is based on <b>a</b> notion <b>of</b> extension. <b>A</b> consequence <b>of</b> the theorem is that there exists a (greedy) polynomial time algorithm to decide whether <b>a</b> <b>map</b> G is <b>a</b> watershed <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>map</b> F or not. We introduce <b>a</b> notion <b>of</b> “separation between two points ” <b>of</b> <b>an</b> image {{which leads to a}} second necessary and sufficient condition. We also show that, given an arbitrary total order on the minima <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>map,</b> it is possible to define <b>a</b> notion <b>of</b> “degree <b>of</b> separation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> minimum ” relative to this order. This leads to a third necessary and sufficient condition for <b>a</b> <b>map</b> G to be <b>a</b> watershed <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>map</b> F. At last we derive, from our framework, a new definition for the dynamics <b>of</b> <b>a</b> minimum...|$|R
