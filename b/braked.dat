5|$|At {{the time}} of the ban, WCRC {{operated}} about 90% of all steam charter operations on Britain's railways. DB Schenker was the only other operator licensed to run steam trains on Network Rail tracks. DB Schenker has a policy of only operating air <b>braked</b> trains, whereas many trains operated by WCRC use vacuum brakes, which meant that DB Schenker was unable to operate those charters in place of WCRC.|$|E
5|$|As the {{collapse}} continues, the rotation rate can increase {{to the point}} where the accreting protostar can break up due to centrifugal force at the equator. Thus the rotation rate must be <b>braked</b> during the first 100,000years to avoid this scenario. One possible explanation for the braking is the interaction of the protostar's magnetic field with the stellar wind in magnetic braking. The expanding wind carries away the angular momentum and slows down the rotation rate of the collapsing protostar.|$|E
5|$|Barrichello placed blame upon Frentzen for {{starting}} the lap one accident at the Variante della Roggia corner. He demanded that Frentzen be banned for ten races. Barrichello also added that his helmet was damaged from his collision with de la Rosa. Frentzen reacted {{by suggesting that}} Barrichello <b>braked</b> earlier which forced him {{to make contact with}} teammate Trulli. FIA Race Director Charlie Whiting defended his decision not to stop the race saying that the safety car was deployed as all cars involved were in the run-off areas and that he believed stopping the race would be dangerous. However, he admitted that he was not aware about Gislimberti's condition when making the decision. Jordan team principal Eddie Jordan believed that Whiting had made the right decision and praised the safety of the modern Formula One car for protecting drivers.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{the fact}} that a drum <b>brake's</b> {{friction}} contact area is at the circumference of the <b>brake,</b> a drum <b>brake</b> can provide more <b>braking</b> force than an equal diameter disc <b>brake.</b> The increased friction contact area of drum <b>brake</b> shoes on the drum allows drum <b>brake</b> shoes to last longer than disc <b>brake</b> pads used in a <b>brake</b> system of similar dimensions and <b>braking</b> force.

5|$|During {{the early}} laps, Massa {{appeared}} to have a faster car than Hamilton, and repeatedly tried to pass the McLaren {{on the inside of}} turn four. His first attempt was on lap three, but Hamilton <b>braked</b> late and kept ahead of Massa into the following corner. Massa tried again at the same place on the next two laps. He passed Hamilton briefly into the turn on lap five, but overshot the corner and ran wide onto the grass. He dropped to fifth, behind teammate Räikkönen and BMW's Nick Heidfeld. Hamilton apologised after the race for 'tricking' Massa into the move. Albers, in the sole remaining Spyker, retired on lap nine with a gearbox fire.|$|E
5|$|Lewis Hamilton, the {{eventual}} Drivers' Champion, led the Championship {{going into the}} race, and started from pole position alongside Räikkönen. Hamilton's McLaren teammate Heikki Kovalainen began from third, next to Alonso. At the first corner Hamilton <b>braked</b> late, forcing Räikkönen wide. Hamilton was later given a penalty, and was criticised by the British racing press for overaggressive driving. Ferrari driver Felipe Massa, Hamilton's principal Championship rival, was penalised after an incident on lap two in which he touched Hamilton's car, causing it to spin. The incident dropped Hamilton {{to the back of}} the field, from where he was unable to regain a points scoring position. Massa later collided with Sébastien Bourdais of Toro Rosso. Bourdais was penalised after the race, and demoted from sixth to tenth position. The penalty prompted widespread criticism from the racing media and ex-drivers.|$|E
5|$|The Met {{opened with}} no stock of its own, with the GWR {{and then the}} GNR {{providing}} services. The GWR used eight-wheeled compartment carriages constructed from teak. By 1864, the Met had taken delivery of its own stock, made by the Ashbury Railway Carriage & Iron Co., based on the GWR design but standard gauge. Lighting was provided by gas— two jets in first class compartments and one in second and third class compartments, and from 1877 a pressurised oil gas system was used. Initially the carriages were <b>braked</b> with wooden blocks operated by hand from the guards' compartments at {{the front and back}} of the train, giving off a distinctive smell. This was replaced in 1869 by a chain that operated brakes on all carriages. The operation of the chain brake could be abrupt, leading to some passenger injuries, and it was replaced by a non-automatic vacuum brake by 1876. In the 1890s, a mechanical 'next station' indicator was tested in some carriages on the circle, triggered by a wooden flap between the tracks. It was considered unreliable and not approved for full installation.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new <b>braking</b> torque {{distribution}} strategy for electric {{vehicles equipped with}} a hybrid hydraulic <b>braking</b> and regenerative <b>braking</b> system. The <b>braking</b> torque distribution strategy is proposed based on the required <b>braking</b> torque and the regenerative <b>braking</b> system 2 ̆ 7 s status. To get the required <b>braking</b> torque, a new strategy is designed based on the road conditions and driver 2 ̆ 7 s <b>braking</b> intentions. Through the estimated road surface, a robust wheel slip controller is designed to calculate the overall maximum <b>braking</b> torque required for the anti-lock <b>braking</b> system (ABS) under this road condition. Driver 2 ̆ 7 s <b>braking</b> intentions are classified as the emergency <b>braking</b> and the normal <b>braking.</b> In the case of emergency <b>braking,</b> the required <b>braking</b> torque is to be equal to the overall maximum <b>braking</b> torque. In the case of normal <b>braking,</b> the command <b>braking</b> torque {{is proportional to the}} pedal stroke. Then the required <b>braking</b> torque is chosen as the smaller one between the overall maximum <b>braking</b> torque and the command <b>braking</b> torque. To acquire both high regenerative efficiency and good <b>braking</b> performance when the required <b>braking</b> torque is smaller than the maximum <b>braking</b> torque of the regenerative <b>braking</b> system, the whole <b>braking</b> torque can be provided by the regenerative <b>braking</b> system; when the required <b>braking</b> torque is bigger than the maximum <b>braking</b> torque of the regenerative <b>braking</b> system, the whole <b>braking</b> torque can be provided by both the hydraulic <b>braking</b> system and the regenerative <b>braking</b> system, while the maximum <b>braking</b> torque of the regenerative <b>braking</b> system is obtained based on the battery state of charge (SOC) and vehicle speed in real-time. Both fuzzy rule-based scheduling and robust control approaches will be applied to achieve the above proposed distribution strategy. The effectiveness of the proposed control system is validated by numerical simulations under various road conditions, vehicle speeds, driver 2 ̆ 7 s <b>braking</b> intentions, and the battery SOCs...|$|R

5|$|The {{rotational}} {{period of}} each star {{can be measured}} by observing periodic variations in the doppler shifts of their spectral lines. The absolute rotational velocities of the two stars are known from their inclinations, rotation periods, and sizes, but the projected equatorial rotational velocities measured using doppler broadening of spectral lines are a standard measure and these are generally quoted. Capella Aa has a projected rotational velocity of 4.1±0.4 km per second, taking 104 ± 3 days to complete one rotation, while Capella Ab spins much more rapidly at 35.0±0.5 km per second, completing a full rotation in only 8.5 ± 0.2 days. Rotational braking occurs in all stars when they expand into giants, and binary stars are also tidally <b>braked.</b> Capella Aa has slowed until it is rotationally locked to the orbital period, although theory predicts that it should still be rotating more quickly from a starting point of a rapidly-spinning main sequence A star.|$|E
5|$|Alonso lapped {{consistently}} {{in the low}} 1:19 range, {{setting the}} new fastest lap of the race on lap41, a 1:19.101, to extend his lead over Kubica to more than 12seconds. Räikkönen was five seconds behind Kubica in third. Alonso made a pit stop {{for the second time}} on lap43 and changed to the softer compound tyre. Kubica, complaining of understeer over the team radio, made his second stop on lap46, two laps ahead of Räikkönen. Trulli, Bourdais, Vettel and Piquet made pit stops over the next five laps, their teams giving them sufficient fuel to finish the race. As Bourdais exited the pit-lane in seventh place on lap51, Massa, who was eighth, but yet to make his final pit stop, attempted to pass him and the two cars collided at the first corner. Massa spun, but rejoined the race behind Bourdais. Three laps later, the stewards announced that they were investigating the incident, and would make their decision after the race. On lap52, Räikkönen attempted to pass Kubica on the approach to turn one after drafting behind him up the straight, but Kubica drove right as a blocking manoeuvre, <b>braked</b> late, and defended his position. On the following lap Kubica attempted to replicate his block, but Räikkönen out-braked him into turn one, and the two drew alongside. Kubica held the inside line on the turn three left-hander, and drove the racing line as Räikkönen left the track at the run-off area. Räikkönen then rejoined behind the BMW driver. Kubica faced similar challenges from Räikkönen over the next two laps into turn one, but he successfully defended his position.|$|E
5|$|As Vettel {{maintained}} his lead, the stewards informed the Lotus team that Kovalainen {{had been caught}} speeding in the pit lane, {{for which he was}} served with a ten-second stop-and-go penalty that was taken on lap thirty-nine. Alonso set a new fastest lap and closed the gap to 1.2 seconds behind Vettel at the start of lap thirty-seven. Further back, Sutil overtook Heidfeld for twelfth on the following lap. Sutil tried to pass Kobayashi on lap thirty-eight at turn three but out-braked himself, allowing Kobayashi to retake the position. He passed the Kobayashi because of his higher straight line speed, but Sutil <b>braked</b> later and slid off the track, rejoining in fourteenth. One lap later, Alonso was told by his team to drive less aggressively through turns seven and eight in an effort to preserve tyre life because he was spinning his tyres under acceleration. At the conclusion of lap thirty-nine, all of the drivers had made pit stops. Vettel was leading Alonso, who was followed by Hamilton, Massa, Schumacher, Barrichello, Petrov, Hülkenberg, Kubica, Liuzzi, Kobayashi, Heidfeld, Alguersari, Sutil, Button, Senna, Kovalainen and Yamamoto. A dry line began to emerge on lap forty-one as Petrov lost control of the rear-end of his car between turns seventeen and eighteen; he slid sideways into the tyre barrier at the pit lane entry.|$|E

5|$|Audi's No. 8 car made a {{pit stop}} for tyres, fuel and a {{replacement}} rear spoiler. The safety car {{went into the}} pit lane after 24 minutes and racing resumed with Jarvis leading the field back up to speed. Lamy passed François Perrodo's No. 83 AF Corse Ferrari at Rivage corner {{to take over the}} LMGTE Am lead. Patrick Long in the No. 88 Abu Dhabi Proton Racing car overtook Perrodo at Les Comes to take over second position in the same category. Fässler closed the gap to Heidfeld in the No. 12 Rebellion Racing vehicle but was spun by Albuquerque's RGR Sport car after moving in front of the vehicle upon lapping it at La Source resulting in heavy damage to the No. 7 Audi car's front-end, littering debris on the track. This was partly because Fässler <b>braked</b> early for the corner due to slower cars. Baxi DC Racing's No. 35 Alpine and the Abu Dhabi's No. 88 Porsche made heavy contact causing the former to sustain a right-rear puncture, littering the track with debris on the Kemmel Straight, and stopping {{on the side of the}} track. Calado's engine failed which prevented him from clinching victory in LMGTE Pro and he went into his garage to retire. Derani locked his tyres at La Source, allowing Lapierre to close the gap, and the French driver overtook Derani around the outside while lapping Franchitti's Ford GT at Fagnes to move into the LMP2 lead.|$|E
5|$|Friday's late {{afternoon}} qualification session {{was divided into}} two groups that lasted 25 minutes each. Cars in LMGTE Pro and Am were sent out first and, after a five-minute interval, LMP1 and LMP2 vehicles drove onto the track. All vehicles were required to be driven by two participants for one timed lap each and the starting order was determined by the competitor's fastest average times. The fastest qualifier was awarded one point which went towards the Drivers' and Manufacturers' Championships. The qualifying session took place in sunny weather conditions. Porsche led the time sheets early on with a flying lap from Hartley in the No. 1 entry before Bernhard improved it to clinch the team's first pole position of the season with an average time of one minute and 55.793 seconds. This was Hartley's, Bernhard's and Webber's seventh of their careers, and the 13th for the German manufacturer. They were joined on the grid's front row by team-mates Jani and Lieb who were nearly eight-tenths of a second off Bernhard and Hartley's pace but it marked the first occasion that Porsche began an World Endurance Championship in the first two starting positions since the 2015 6 Hours of Bahrain. Lieb was not happy with his fastest lap because he <b>braked</b> early and was unable to achieve a rhythm he liked.|$|E
5|$|On lap 20 it was {{announced}} that Vergne was under investigation by the stewards after he was observed speeding in the pit lane. He was issued with a drive-through penalty three laps later, ending his chances of battling for the victory. He remerged in fifth place ahead of both Audi Sport ABT cars but behind Prost, and Buemi inherited second place. Duval stopped on the track with powertrain problems on the 25th lap but was able to restart his car and continued in 18th position. Having made a pit stop one lap earlier {{than the rest of the}} field, Rosenqvist conserved electrical energy usage, allowing Buemi to close up to him at a rate of nearly two seconds per lap because he used Fan Boost, had more electrical energy available to him, and the requirement to lift and coast was minimal. Abt lost sixth place when was overtaken by teammate di Grassi at the sixth turn on lap 27. Shortly afterwards, Buemi drafted Rosenqvist, <b>braked</b> later than he did, and overtook him around the outside at turn eleven to take over the lead. López passed Frijns to move into tenth place. Vergne attempted to move ahead of Prost but was unable to pass, allowing di Grassi to close up to Vergne. Vergne defended his position, but di Grassi overtook him at turn seven to take over fifth place.|$|E

5|$|Abt fell to seventh {{when he was}} {{overtaken}} by Prost at the first corner on lap ten, and the former defended from a large pack of cars. By the twelfth lap, Buemi had more usable electrical energy available and closed up to Piquet, overtaking him around the inside for fourth position at the seventh turn. Félix da Costa's vehicle stopped at turn eight on lap twelve. However, the deployment of a full course yellow flag was avoided when he received radio instructions from his team to perform a full reset, enabling him to rejoin the race. By then, he had dropped {{to the back of}} the field, and later became the race's first retirement. Upfront, Rosenqvist held a five-second advantage over Bird by the fourteenth lap, but the latter was being caught by Vergne by more than four-tenths of a second per lap. Although he had less electrical energy, Vergne caught Bird, who had been backed into Buemi, and moved in front of him at the start of the 16th lap with Bird electing not to defend the second position. The mandatory pit stops, during which all drivers need to change into a second car, began on the same lap. When Rosenqvist and Vergne entered the pit lane Buemi and Bird elected to remain on the circuit for another lap. Buemi was running quicker and overtook Bird at turn eleven on lap 17. He <b>braked</b> late for turn eleven but avoided going off the circuit. Piquet was affected by an electrical problem, ending his chances of finishing in a points-scoring position. Engel stopped his vehicle after making his pit stop, and became the event's second retirement with electrical problems. After the pit stops, Rosenqvist regained the first position, retaining most of his four-second advantage over Vergne. Di Grassi had been passed by Turvey but reclaimed sixth place from him shortly afterwards and started to close up to teammate Abt.|$|E
25|$|In normal {{operation}} for locomotive/carriage trains, on descending and level running, {{the train is}} normally <b>braked</b> (service braking) using the locomotive. This uses compression braking – the energy is absorbed by using the cylinders as pumps, then dumping the pressure, similar to a Jake brake – on steam locomotives, hydraulic braking on the diesel locomotives. The diesel-electric railcars were service <b>braked</b> using hydraulic brakes and dynamic braking, during which power was dissipated in roof-mounted resistors, creating a distinct heat shimmer when the vehicles were descending and shortly afterwards. The hand brakes are used to bring a train to a complete stand from low speed, and as a parking brake.|$|E
25|$|Spacing of {{vehicles}} on the guideway influences the maximum passenger capacity of a track, so designers prefer smaller headway distances. Computerized control theoretically permits closer spacing than the two-second headways recommended for cars at speed, since multiple vehicles can be <b>braked</b> simultaneously.

50|$|Friction <b>brakes</b> on {{automobiles}} store <b>braking</b> heat in {{the drum}} <b>brake</b> or disc <b>brake</b> while <b>braking</b> then conduct it to the air gradually. When traveling downhill some vehicles can use their engines to <b>brake.</b>|$|R
50|$|A <b>braking</b> {{technique}} {{where the}} driver will combine {{the use of}} left-foot <b>braking</b> with throttle to dynamically control <b>brake</b> bias and remove engine <b>braking.</b> In a rear wheel drive vehicle, greater throttle usage while <b>braking</b> will counteract the rear <b>braking</b> force and move the <b>brake</b> bias forward.|$|R
50|$|Transmission <b>brakes</b> use drum <b>brakes,</b> {{rather than}} disc <b>brakes,</b> {{as they are}} {{intended}} as a static parking <b>brake,</b> rather than a high performance dynamic <b>brake.</b> Drum <b>brakes</b> allow simpler adjustment with cable-actuated hand lever mechanisms.

25|$|The {{class was}} built in two batches; units 303001-035 were built 1959-60 (nominally for the North Clyde Line) and units 303036-091 were built 1960-61 (nominally for the Cathcart Circle Lines). In practice, when built, the North Clyde lines {{required}} {{the majority of the}} units. There was no electrified connection between the two networks until late {{in the life of the}} trains, and thus transfers between the two halves of the system, performed quite regularly, were dragged by locomotives via the Shields Road-High Street line. As the Class 303 were air <b>braked,</b> and most diesel locomotives of the early era were vacuum <b>braked,</b> a few Class 20 diesels were fitted with air brake connections for this, although when the Class 303 were new there were still a few former Caledonian Railway 4-4-0 steam locomotives in stock with the Westinghouse air brake, which were used for the transfers, and for delivering the units from their factory in Paisley.|$|E
25|$|Each train {{consists}} of a locomotive pushing a single passenger car up the mountain, descending the mountain by going backwards. Both locomotive and car were originally equipped with a ratchet and pawl mechanism engaged during the climb that prevents any roll-back; during descent, both locomotive and car are <b>braked.</b> Recent improvements in design have replaced the ratchet (gear and pawl mechanism) with sprag clutches and disc brake assemblies. Most of the locomotives {{were made by the}} Manchester Locomotive Works.|$|E
25|$|Differential braking (or <b>braked</b> differential) systems {{remove the}} {{clutches}} {{on the track}} and add a differential on the transmission output. The differential allows the tracks to turn at different speeds while remaining powered. Steering is then accomplished by slowing one track with a brake. The advantage to this design is that power is maintained to both tracks even while steering is taking place. Another advantage is outright simplicity; the steering system connects directly to the brake and nothing else, producing a very simple mechanical arrangement.|$|E
40|$|A Disc <b>brake</b> is {{a device}} that retards/halts the {{rotation}} of a shaft/ wheel.

50|$|<b>Brake</b> fade {{failures}} can cascade. For example, {{a typical}} 5-axle truck/trailer combination has 10 <b>brakes.</b> If one <b>brake</b> fades, <b>brake</b> load {{is transferred to}} the remaining 9 <b>brakes,</b> causing them to work harder, get hotter, and thus fade more. Where fade is non-uniform, fade may cause a vehicle to swerve. Because of this, heavy vehicles often use disproportionately weak <b>brakes</b> on steered wheels, which hurts the stopping distance and causes <b>brakes</b> on non-steered wheels to work harder, worsening fade. An advantage of low-fade <b>brakes</b> such as disc <b>brakes</b> is steered wheels can do more <b>braking</b> without causing <b>brake</b> steer.|$|R
