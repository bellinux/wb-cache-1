40|$|In plants {{there is}} no {{universal}} protocol for RNA extraction, since optimizations are required depending on the species, tissues and developmental stages. Some plants/tissues are rich in secondary metabolites or synthesize thick cell walls, which hinder an efficient RNA extraction. One such example is <b>bast</b> <b>fibres,</b> long extraxylary cells characterized by a thick cellulosic cell wall. Given the economic importance of <b>bast</b> <b>fibres,</b> which {{are used in the}} textile sector, as well as in biocomposites as green substitutes of glass fibres, it is desirable to better understand their development from a molecular point of view. This knowledge favours the development of biotechnological strategies aimed at improving specific properties of <b>bast</b> <b>fibres.</b> To be able to perform high-throughput analyses, such as, for instance, transcriptomics of <b>bast</b> <b>fibres,</b> RNA extraction is a crucial and limiting step. We here detail a protocol enabling the rapid extraction of high quality RNA from the <b>bast</b> <b>fibres</b> of textile hemp, Cannabis sativa L., a multi-purpose fibre crop standing in the spotlight of research...|$|R

25|$|Another Egyptian sling was {{excavated}} in El-Lahun in Al Fayyum Egypt in 1914 by William Matthew Flinders Petrie, and now {{resides in}} the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology—Petrie dated it to about 800 BC. It was found alongside an iron spearhead. The remains are broken into three sections. Although fragile, the construction is clear: it is made of <b>bast</b> <b>fibre</b> (almost certainly flax) twine; the cords are braided in a 10-strand elliptical sennit and the cradle {{seems to have been}} woven from the same lengths of twine used to form the cords.|$|E
25|$|Jute is a <b>bast</b> <b>fibre,</b> {{which comes}} from the inner bark of the plants of the Corchorus genus. It is retted like flax, sundried and baled. When {{spinning}} {{a small amount of}} oil must be added to the fibre. It can be bleached and dyed. It was used for sacks and bags but is now used for the backing for carpets. Jute can be blended with other fibres to make composite fabrics and work continues in Bangladesh to refine the processes and extend the range of usage possible. In the 1970s, jute-cotton composite fabrics were known as jutton fabrics.|$|E
25|$|The {{company in}} Győr had {{mechanical}} flax- and hamp weaving for surface treatment, finishing and impregnation, fabrics of jute, production of bags and tents transportation. The plant had a wide product range of tablecloths, towels, pressings, tarpaulin sheets, and canvas cloths {{made up of}} technical textiles. The name of the company, Group Linum-Taussig, shows that it was about Linum (flax). Linum is a genus of approximately 200 species in the flowering plant family Linaceae, native to temperate and subtropical regions of the world. It includes the Common Flax (L. usitatissimum), the <b>bast</b> <b>fibre</b> of {{which is used to}} produce linen and the seeds to produce linseed oil.|$|E

50|$|The bark of the {{hibiscus}} contains strong <b>bast</b> <b>fibres</b> {{that can}} be obtained by letting the stripped bark set in the sea to let the organic material rot away.|$|R
50|$|Since the {{valuable}} fibres {{are located in}} the phloem, they must often be separated from the xylem material ("woody core"), and sometimes also from the epidermis. The process for this is called retting, and can be performed by micro-organisms either on land (nowadays the most important) or in water, or by chemicals (for instance high pH and chelating agents) or by pectinolytic enzymes. In the phloem, <b>bast</b> <b>fibres</b> occur in bundles that are glued together by pectin and calcium ions. More intense retting separates the fibre bundles into elementary fibres, that can be several centimetres long. Often <b>bast</b> <b>fibres</b> have higher tensile strength than other kinds, and are used in high-quality textiles (sometimes in blends with cotton or synthetic fibres), ropes, yarn, paper, composite materials and burlap. An important property of <b>bast</b> <b>fibres</b> is that they contain a special structure, the fibre node, that represents a weak point, and gives flexibility. Seed hairs, such as cotton, do not have nodes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bast</b> <b>fibres</b> are the long, narrow {{supportive}} {{cells that}} provide tension strength without limiting flexibility. They {{are also found}} in xylem, and are {{the main component of}} many textiles such as paper, linen, and cotton.|$|R

50|$|The {{plant is}} {{primarily}} cultivated {{for the production}} of <b>bast</b> <b>fibre</b> from the stem. The fibre may be used as a substitute for jute in making burlap. Hibiscus, specifically roselle, has been used in folk medicine as a diuretic and mild laxative.|$|E

50|$|Kenaf is {{cultivated}} for its fibre in India, Bangladesh, United States of America, Indonesia, Malaysia, South Africa, Viet Nam, Thailand, {{parts of}} Africa, {{and to a}} small extent in southeast Europe. The stems produce two types of fibre, a coarser fibre in the outer layer (<b>bast</b> <b>fibre),</b> and a finer fibre in the core. It matures in 100 to 200 days. Kenaf was grown in Egypt over 3000 years ago. The kenaf leaves were consumed in human and animal diets, the <b>bast</b> <b>fibre</b> was used for bags, cordage, and the sails for Egyptian boats. This crop was not introduced into southern Europe until the early 1900s. Today, principal farming areas are China, India, {{and it is also}} grown in many other countries such as the US, Mexico and Senegal.|$|E

40|$|The {{preservation}} of intact RNA is a limiting step when gene expression profiling {{is performed using}} field-collected plant material. The use of liquid nitrogen ensures the optimal {{preservation of}} RNA, however {{it is not always}} practical, especially if the plant material has to be sampled in remote locations. Ethanol is known to preserve DNA in plant tissues even after a long storage period and here its suitability to preserve the RNA of textile hemp cortical tissues was tested. Hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) is an economically important fibre crop because it supplies cellulosic <b>bast</b> <b>fibres</b> used in different industrial sectors. In this study we demonstrate the suitability of ethanol for RNA preservation by analyzing tissues stored at 4 °C for 1, 2, 4 and 8 days. We show that in all the cases the extracted RNA is intact. We finally analyze hemp stem tissues stored in ethanol for 1 month and demonstrate the preservation of the tissue structure, particularly of <b>bast</b> <b>fibres...</b>|$|R
