5|$|Because the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> {{payments}} sums to zero, {{a current}} account surplus indicates a deficit in the asset accounts and vice versa. A current account surplus or deficit indicates {{the extent to which}} a country is relying on foreign capital to finance its consumption and investments, and whether it is living beyond its means. For example, assuming a capital account <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> zero (thus no asset transfers available for financing), {{a current account}} deficit of £1 billion implies a financial account surplus (or net asset exports) of £1 billion. A net exporter of financial assets is known as a borrower, exchanging future payments for current consumption. Further, a net export of financial assets indicates growth in a country's debt. From this perspective, the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> payments links a nation's income to its spending by indicating the degree to which current account imbalances are financed with domestic or foreign financial capital, which illuminates how a nation's wealth is shaped over time. A healthy <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> payments position is important for economic growth. If countries experiencing a growth in demand have trouble sustaining a healthy <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> payments, demand can slow, leading to: unused or excess supply, discouraged foreign investment, and less attractive exports which can further reinforce a negative cycle that intensifies payments imbalances.|$|E

5|$|Addressing the mercantilist {{belief that}} {{monetary}} intervention {{could cause a}} perpetually favourable <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> trade, Cantillon developed a specie-flow mechanism foreshadowing future international monetary equilibrium theories. He suggested that in countries with a high quantity of money in circulation, prices will increase and therefore become less competitive in relation to countries {{where there is a}} relative scarcity of money. Thus, Cantillon also held that increases in the supply of money, regardless of the source, cause increases in the price level and therefore reduce the competitiveness of a particular nation's industry in relation to a nation with lower prices. However, Cantillon did not believe that international markets tended toward equilibrium, and instead suggested that government hoard specie to avoid rising prices and falling competitiveness. Furthermore, he suggested that a favourable <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> trade can be maintained by offering a better product and retaining qualitative competitiveness. Cantillon's preference towards a favourable <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> trade possibly stemmed from the mercantilist belief in exchange being a zero-sum game, in which one party gains at the expense of another.|$|E

40|$|In {{this book}} {{advanced}} balancing methods for planar and spatial linkages, hand operated and automatic robot manipulators are presented. It is organized into three main parts and eight chapters. The main parts are {{the introduction to}} <b>balancing,</b> the <b>balancing</b> <b>of</b> linkages and the <b>balancing</b> <b>of</b> robot manipulators. The review of state-of-the-art literature including more than 500 references discloses particularities <b>of</b> shaking force/moment <b>balancing</b> and gravity compensation methods. Then new methods for <b>balancing</b> <b>of</b> linkages are considered. Methods provided {{in the second part}} of the book deal with the partial and complete shaking force/moment <b>balancing</b> <b>of</b> various linkages. A new field for balancing methods applications is the design of mechanical systems for fast manipulation. Special attention is given to the shaking force/moment <b>balancing</b> <b>of</b> robot manipulators. Gravity balancing methods are also discussed. The suggested balancing methods are illustrated by numerous examples...|$|R

The source of information for me was proffesional literature. The second and practical part focuses on the selected company. I decided for the joint-stock construction company OHL ŽS, a. s.

Moreover, a fictional business corporation being under liquidation will be created and a statement <b>of</b> <b>balances</b> and preparations preceding the statement <b>of</b> <b>balance</b> will be described.
