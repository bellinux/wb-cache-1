5|$|If OHS is suspected, various {{tests are}} {{required}} for its confirmation. The most important initial test is the demonstration of elevated {{carbon dioxide in the}} blood. This requires an arterial blood gas determination, which involves taking a blood sample from an artery, usually the radial artery. Given that it would be complicated to perform this test on every patient with sleep-related <b>breathing</b> <b>problems,</b> some suggest that measuring bicarbonate levels in normal (venous) blood would be a reasonable screening test. If this is elevated (27mmol/l or higher), blood gasses should be measured.|$|E

5|$|The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{warned in}} 2014 that {{over-the-counter}} acne products containing benzoyl peroxide and/or salicylic acid, including Proactiv, can cause severe irritation, {{as well as}} rare but life-threatening allergic reactions. Consumers were advised to stop using the products if they experience hives or itching, and to seek emergency medical attention if they feel faint, or experience throat tightness, <b>breathing</b> <b>problems,</b> or swelling of the eyes, face, lips or tongue. The FDA noted that it remains unclear whether the reactions are caused by the active ingredients, inactive ingredients or a combination.|$|E

5|$|The {{result of}} {{breathing}} increased partial pressures of oxygen is hyperoxia, {{an excess of}} oxygen in body tissues. The body is affected in different ways {{depending on the type}} of exposure. Central nervous system toxicity is caused by short exposure to high partial pressures of oxygen at greater than atmospheric pressure. Pulmonary and ocular toxicity result from longer exposure to increased oxygen levels at normal pressure. Symptoms may include disorientation, <b>breathing</b> <b>problems,</b> and vision changes such as myopia. Prolonged exposure to above-normal oxygen partial pressures, or shorter exposures to very high partial pressures, can cause oxidative damage to cell membranes, collapse of the alveoli in the lungs, retinal detachment, and seizures. Oxygen toxicity is managed by reducing the exposure to increased oxygen levels. Studies show that, in the long term, a robust recovery from most types of oxygen toxicity is possible.|$|E
5|$|Nelson owns Luck, Texas, a {{ranch in}} Spicewood, Texas, and also lives in Maui, Hawaii with several celebrity neighbors.While {{swimming}} in Hawaii in 1981, Nelson's lung collapsed. He {{was taken to}} the Maui Memorial Hospital and his scheduled concerts were canceled. Nelson temporarily stopped smoking cigarettes each time his lungs became congested, and resumed when the congestion ended. He was then smoking between two and three packs per day. After suffering from pneumonia several times, he decided to quit either marijuana or tobacco. He chose to quit tobacco. In 2008 he started to smoke marijuana with a carbon-free system to avoid the effects of smoke. In 2004 Nelson underwent surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome, as he had damaged his wrists by continuously playing the guitar. On the recommendation of his doctor, he canceled his scheduled concerts and only wrote songs during his recovery. In 2012 he canceled a fund-raising appearance in the Denver area. He suffered from <b>breathing</b> <b>problems</b> due to high altitude and emphysema and was taken to a local hospital. His publicist Elaine Schock confirmed soon after that Nelson's health was good and that he was heading to his next scheduled concert in Dallas, Texas. After repeated instances of pneumonia and emphysema through the years, Nelson underwent stem-cell therapy in 2015 to improve the state of his lungs.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Enuresis Nocturna (EN) {{associated}} with symptoms of upper airway obstruction was frequentlyobserved in various studies. In this study EN {{associated with}} symptoms of upperairway obstruction (<b>breathing</b> <b>problem</b> while sleeping, sleep apnea syndrome, sleeping with open mouth, snoring) was examined. Methods: This {{study was conducted}} on 2314 students between 6 - 14 years age, from 3 primary schools in Ankara between January-May 2011. The questionnaires, questioning EN and the symptoms of upper airway obstruction, were distributed to students to be filled in by parents. Results: The mean age of 2314 studyparticipants (1123 male, 1191 female) was 9. 21 ± 2. 08 (6 - 14 years). When students were evaluated as groups with EN and without EN, {{a statistically significant difference}} was detected between groups regarding upper airway obstruction symptoms (<b>breathing</b> <b>problem</b> while sleeping, sleep apnea syndrome, sleeping with open mouth and snoring) (re spectively p= 0. 002, p= 0. 036, p 3 ̆c 0. 001,p 3 ̆c 0. 001). When students were examined by dividing into 3 age groups as GroupI(6 - 8 age), Group II(9 - 11 age) and Group III(12 - 14 age), a statistically significant difference was detected between age groups with EN (+), regarding <b>breathing</b> <b>problem</b> while sleeping and sleep apnea syndrome (respectively p= 0. 025,p= 0. 004). Conclusion: As was detected in this study, EN could accompany upper airway obstruction symptoms as was detected in this study. Thus, taking a detailed medical history and physical examination at the primary care centers is significant...|$|R
