5|$|Celebrities, artists, {{and merchants}} enjoyed fine food, opium, and liquor at the Great Southern Hotel, which had novel Western pleasures, {{such as a}} disco ball {{specially}} imported from the USA. The allure of Western goods and traditions even extended to weddings held at the hotel. A prolific Chinese writer, Wu Sijing, held her 17-table wedding banquet there in 1952, and was photographed in a white bridal dress, {{with her husband in}} a white suit and <b>bowtie.</b> This choice of dress would have been most unusual amongst mainland Chinese due to the nationalistic influence of Mao-era China, highlighting Singapore's confluence between Eastern and Western cultures, of which the hotel was at the forefront. Both in decor, and activities.|$|E

25|$|The Caprice was updated for 2011 {{to include}} the {{features}} that Holden included the Holden Caprice. The Caprice lettering engraved on the chrome trim which was on the car from 2000 until 2010 on the trim was dropped & replaced by a Caprice nameplate badge which is below the chrome trim on the left end of the rear fascia on the trunk. The V6 engines were dropped in the LS & LTZ leaving the V8 as the standard engine while the LS got the rims that were previously on the LTZ from 2007-2010 as well as previously seen on the VE Commodore V based on the Omega Series I model, while the LTZ & Royale get the rims seen on the VE Commodore Calais V Series II & the 2010-2011 Chevrolet Omega Fittipaldi Edition and the SS now gains the rims that the WM Caprice V Series II has. The LS, LTZ, & Royale still retain the Statesman front bumper, while the SS still retains the Caprice/Caprice V front bumper. The Royale also gains a rear vision camera in the chrome trim on the trunk which is absent on the LS, LTZ, & SS like the Holden Caprice & Caprice V. For the 2013 model year for the Caprice SS the Impala badge on the trunk was dropped {{in favor of the}} traditional Chevrolet <b>bowtie.</b>|$|E

[...] According to fellow cast member Bob McGrath, who also appeared in Sesame Streets first episode with Lee, [...] "Will had a broader dimension to his character than perhaps the rest of us did... He convinced me that no matter how simple the scene was with a child, you had to bring a tremendous integrity and an honesty and credibility to it". [...] Joan Ganz Cooney, Sesame Street co-creator and president of the Children's Television Workshop (CTW), said, [...] "He gave millions of children the message that the old and the young have a lot to say to each other". [...] The New York Times reported that Mr. Hooper ranked first of all human characters of the show in recognition by young viewers.|$|E

2500|$|For 1978 the Concours was {{discontinued}} {{to clear}} the way for the newly downsized Malibu, and the Nova Custom inherited much of the Concours' exterior finery but lacked the stand-up hood ornament displayed by the Concours. Upholstery choices included all-vinyl or Edinburgh woven sport cloth/vinyl. More basic versions of the 1978 Chevrolet Nova had the same grille used in '76-77 and added a gold-tinted Chevy <b>bowtie</b> emblem at {{the leading edge of the}} hood. [...] For '78 Nova was also available with Rally equipment, which included yet another front-end layout: a diamond-pattern grille with horizontal parking lights and black headlight bezels (basically the '76-77 SS grille), plus triple band striping and color-keyed Rally wheels.

2500|$|The family divided {{their time}} between the Villa Meridiana, an {{experimental}} floriculture station which also served as their home, and Mario's ancestral land at San Giovanni Battista. On this small working farm set in the hills behind San Remo, Mario pioneered in the cultivation of then exotic fruits such as avocado and grapefruit, eventually obtaining an entry in the Dizionario biografico degli italiani for his achievements. The vast forests and luxuriant fauna omnipresent in Calvino's early fiction such as The Baron in the Trees derives from this [...] "legacy". In an interview, Calvino stated that [...] "San Remo continues to pop out in my books, in the most diverse pieces of writing." [...] He and Floriano would climb the tree-rich estate and perch for hours on the branches reading their favorite adventure stories. Less salubrious aspects of this [...] "paternal legacy" [...] are described in The Road to San Giovanni, Calvino's memoir of his father in which he exposes their inability to communicate: [...] "Talking to each other was difficult. Both verbose by nature, possessed of an ocean of words, in each other's presence we became mute, would walk in silence side by side {{along the road to}} San Giovanni." [...] A fan of Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book as a child, Calvino felt that his early interest in stories made him the [...] "black sheep" [...] of a family that held literature in less esteem than the sciences. Fascinated by American movies and cartoons, he was equally attracted to drawing, poetry, and theatre. On a darker note, Calvino recalled that his earliest memory was of a Marxist professor who had been brutally assaulted by Benito Mussolini's Blackshirts: [...] "I remember clearly that we were at dinner when the old professor came in with his face beaten up and bleeding, his <b>bowtie</b> all torn, asking for help." ...|$|E

50|$|On 16 October 2011, the {{developers}} released a beta {{fork of the}} project called <b>Bowtie</b> 2. In addition to the Burrows-Wheeler transform, <b>Bowtie</b> 2 also uses an FM-index (similar to a suffix array) to keep its memory footprint small. Due to its implementation, <b>Bowtie</b> 2 is more suited to finding longer, gapped alignments {{in comparison with the}} original <b>Bowtie</b> method. The latest version (2.2.6) was released on July 22, 2015.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Bowtie</b> {{sequence}} aligner {{was originally}} developed by Ben Langmead et al. at the University of Maryland in 2009. The aligner is typically used with short reads {{and a large}} reference genome, or for whole genome analysis. <b>Bowtie</b> is promoted as [...] "an ultrafast, memory-efficient short aligner for short DNA sequences." [...] The speed increase of <b>Bowtie</b> {{is partly due to}} implementing the Burrows-Wheeler transform for aligning, which reduces the memory footprint (typically to around 2.2GB for the human genome); a similar method is used by the BWA and SOAP2 alignment methods. The latest version of <b>Bowtie</b> (1.1.2) was released on June 23, 2015.
