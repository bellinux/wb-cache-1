40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the system of state social support. It {{analyzes}} {{the development of these}} benefits {{since the beginning of the}} global economic crisis to the present. I analyzed <b>birth</b> <b>grant,</b> child allowance, parental allowance, housing allowance and funeral grant. I analyzed social supplement too, but it has been canceled. The thesis compares the benefits before the global economic crisis with the development of the crisis and the current legislative setting benefits. The aim is to confirm the impact of the global economic crisis to strengthen those benefits. Since 2008 welfare benefits are toughen in our country. Toughen up benefits impacts families with children whom are primarily set these benefits. Thus decreasing doses that are designed for families with children? State makes austerity. It reduces expenditures of the state budget. In my thesis I examine the impact of the tightening of state social support system of assistance in material need. Therefore reduce the expenditures of the state budget, or just spilling over into another social security? Accordingly, this thesis compares the development of state budget expenditures on social benefits and the benefits of the assistance in material need, from 2007 to 2013.

Heterosexuals constitute a social majority and a heterosexually oriented gender roles are well established, which may cause minority sexual orientation, gay, lesbian, and transgender, to be the opposite of “normal”. What is transgender or gender non-conforming? “Transgender/gender non-conforming” describes people whose gender identity or expression is different, {{at least part of}} the time, from their anatomical gender at <b>birth</b> (<b>Grant</b> et al., 2010). This means that someone that is anatomically born a male identify as female or vice versa. There are many different terms that transgender/gender non-conforming people identify with. The following are a list of terms transgender people may identify with: 1. Transgender 2. Transsexual 3. FTM (female to male) 4. MTF (male to female) 5. Intersex (genital ambiguity) 6. Gender non-conforming (gender variant) 7. Gender-queer 8. Androgynous (sexual ambiguity) 9. Feminine male 10. Masculine female or butch 11. A. G. or Aggressive 12.

40|$|The bachelors {{treatise}} {{deals with}} the issue of the state social support regulating the allowances provided to authorised person (family members) in certain socially recognised situation, when the state partly takes over the joint liability for the occurred social situation. The thesis describes the historical development of social allowances paid by the state, contemporary legal regulations concerning the benefits as a. o. child allowance, social benefit, contribution to housing, parental benefit, benefits for foster care, <b>birth</b> <b>grant,</b> death allowance. Moreover it informs of the characteristics of the Act No. 117 / 1995 Coll. of the State Social Allowance, as amended, in connection to present regulation of the life minimum pursuant the Act No. 110 / 2006 Coll. of the Life and Existence Minimum. This concerns also the way of financing of social security and continuity of the Czech system of state social support to that of European Union. The target of the work was to map {{the current state of the}} issue and also to find out the opinions of the employees of the body of state social support on the valid legal regulation including the possible drafts of its possible change and to make up the comparison of changes in providing individual benefits in years 2006, 2007 and 2008. To achieve this goal, the qualitative method of the analysis of the document and questioning was applied. The technique of the research was secondary data analysis and standardised talk. The examined complex consisted of nine respondents with experience in the field of state social support, selected by the method of accidental choice from six different regions of the Czech Republic. These were managers with a long-term practice in the given system. It follows from the research that the changes which came into effect on 1 st January 2008 are being evaluated rather negatively based on the opinion that the Czech system of the state social support causes the growth of dependency of citizens on the state. The proposal of changes, formulated in this treatise based on the results of the research should concern first of all the child allowance, contribution to housing and more strict control concerning providing allowances. Based on the gained information and achieved goals the thesis could serve as incentive for the proposal of legislative change in the system of state social support with a positive impact on this system during its application in practice...|$|E

40|$|Around 400 {{thousand}} {{children in}} Serbia {{are covered with}} cash-benefits targeting poor children representing 31. 7 % {{of the total number}} of children in 2011. Additionally, around 60 thousand families receive <b>birth</b> <b>grants</b> that is more than 90 % of the newly born. When it comes to child-birth related leaves, there were around 37 thousand beneficiaries in 2012. This means that around 50 % of the newly born children’s parents are covered with maternity/parental leave, while the coverage of employed mothers is almost full. Coverage of the poor children, particularly by the financial social assistance (FSA), can be considered inadequate. When it comes to targeting (vertical efficiency), FSA is targeted quite well, while there is scope for improvement of the inclusion error within the child-allowance program. When the adequacy of cash benefits targeting poor children is analyzed from the perspective of meeting the basic needs, then the amount is at the verge of being acceptable and differs for different kinds of families - single parent and families with very young children (0 - 2) being better off. However, when compared to the minimum wage, the cumulative amount of FSA and child allowance is lower only for one- child families. Total expenditures for cash-benefits connected to children amount to 1. 4 %of GDP - 1. 21 % being related to ESSPROS family/children function and 0. 18 % for the FSA for families with children. When compared to the EU, the total expenditure is below the EU average, with the birth related expenditures being higher and child allowance lower than the EU average. The first group of recommendations for cash benefits aimed at families with children relate to the improvement of adequacy and coverage of benefits aiming at poverty reduction, while respecting budget constraints. The increase of benefits for children above 14 years old - increase of child allowance or/and assigning higher weights (0. 5 instead of 0. 3) for the FSA’s equivalence scale, seems the least controversial measure. When it comes to child allowance benefits, comparative analysis shows that it is more important to increase the coverage rather than to increase the amount. Elimination of requirement for the parents to be covered with health insurance, allowing child allowance right for 4 children (instead of the first 4 children in the family) and relaxation of property criteria could act toward this end. Both from the perspective of improving the coverage and better targeting, the cadastral revenue as eligibility criteria for agricultural households should be replaced with some more realistic criteria. When it comes to child-birth related leaves, due to evidence of misuse of maternity/parental leave benefit by formal employment registration just a few months before child’s birth, one of the recommendations is to prolong the benefit calculation period, while at the same time extending the coverage for women with flexible jobs. Also, the introduction of flexible arrangements for parental leave, such as a choosing different combinations of benefit level and leave duration, part-time work and similar. Speaking of <b>birth</b> <b>grants,</b> there are advantages of introducing one-off payment instead of payment in installments, which actually implies returning to the model before changes were introduced in 2005. In addition, indexation of property threshold should be introduced. Finally, there is a need for benefits’ consolidation and simplification of administrative procedures...|$|R

In an April 2001 assessment of the internal control over Education's payment processes and the associated risks for improper payments, GAO identified four broad categories of internal control weaknesses: poor segregation of duties, lack of supervisory review, inadequate audit trails, and inadequate computer systems' applications controls. This testimony discusses how these weaknesses make Education vulnerable to improper payments in grant and loan payments, third party drafts, and government purchase card purchases. GAO found that Education's student aid application processing system for grants and loans lacks an automated edit check that would identify potentially improper payments from students who were much older than expected, a single social security number associated with two or more dates of <b>birth,</b> <b>grants</b> to recipients in excess of statutory limits, and searches for invalid social security numbers. GAO also found problems with Education's third party draft system. Specifically, Education (1) circumvented a system's application control designed to avoid duplicate payments by adding a suffix to the invoice/voucher number when the system indicates that an invoice/voucher number has already been used; (2) allowed 21 of the 49 Education employees who could issue third party drafts {{to do so without}} involving anyone else; and (3) lacked adequate audit trails, such as a trigger log, to identify changes made to the list of approved vendors. GAO also found shortcomings with Education's internal controls over government purchase cards. ...|$|R
