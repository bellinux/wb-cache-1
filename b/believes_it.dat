5|$|According to Gandhi, {{religion}} {{is not about}} what a man <b>believes,</b> <b>it</b> is about how a man lives, how he relates to other people, his conduct towards others, and one's relationship to one's conception of god. It is not important to convert or to join any religion, {{but it is important}} to improve one's way of life and conduct by absorbing ideas from any source and any religion, believed Gandhi.|$|E
5|$|Developed by Sera Gamble and Cathryn Humphris, {{the episode}} {{was written by}} the latter and {{directed}} by Steve Boyum. It delves into the backstory of Bobby, and also features a major turning point in Dean's search for self-worth. Many dream sequences had to be altered due to production issues, though series creator Eric Kripke <b>believes</b> <b>it</b> ultimately benefited the episode.|$|E

Meanwhile, George Michael and Maeby deal with their previous kiss by avoiding each other.|$|E
5|$|The {{purple-throated cotinga}} {{is not well}} known {{and appears to be}} {{naturally}} uncommon or rare across a widespread area; however, it is almost certainly under-reported due to its canopy lifestyle. The IUCN considers this species to be a species of Least Concern due in part to its large range. While the IUCN has not estimated the population size, it <b>believes</b> <b>it</b> is declining due to habitat loss.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} the river, Robb divides his forces, sending the aforementioned 2,000 men to distract Lord Tywin's army. Due to the false information Robb {{gave to the}} captured Lannister scout, Lord Tywin's force <b>believes</b> <b>it</b> is the whole Stark army. The remainder of Robb's men sneak up on Jaime Lannister's army, defeating them and capturing Jaime. When captured, Jaime challenges Robb to a one-on-one duel to settle the matter, which Robb declines.|$|E

5|$|Dancers in the United Kingdom {{have had}} success in hip-hop theater. In 2006, hip-hop dance company Boy Blue Entertainment won a Laurence Olivier Award for their show Pied Piper. In 2008, Into the Hoods {{became the first}} hip-hop theater show to perform in London's West End. It {{eventually}} {{went on to become}} the West End's longest running dance show ever. According to Clemente, the future of hip-hop dance is in theater; he <b>believes</b> <b>it</b> is necessary for the dance to make this transition in order for it to be legitimized as an art form.|$|E
5|$|European {{occupation}} of Australia has, on the whole, benefited black-shouldered kites through land clearing and irrigation for agriculture and grain harvesting and storage practices which provide suitable conditions for much {{larger numbers of}} mice. According to raptor researcher Dr Stephen Debus, this species did not suffer from eggshell thinning {{during the period of}} DDT use in Australia, though he <b>believes</b> <b>it</b> is possible that secondary poisoning may occur from rodenticides used during mouse plagues or from pesticides used during locust plagues. Populations in areas with high sheep and rabbit numbers may decline, as these animals compact the soil and reduce the available habitat for mice.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{the total}} {{civilian}} population of Nanking in December 1937 {{and the size}} of the Chinese garrison defending the city are used as a basis for calculating the death toll, though the matter is complicated due to greatly varying estimates for both of these numbers. For instance, Tokushi Kasahara claims that Nanking's population in 1937 included 400,000 to 500,000 civilians and 150,000 soldiers, whereas David Askew <b>believes</b> <b>it</b> was 200,000 to 250,000 civilians and 73,790 to 81,500 soldiers.|$|E

Siti Bida Undara, at first upset at the thought of sharing her husband, soon becomes close friends with Siti Akbari. Shortly thereafter Bahar Oedin takes his revenge, capturing Abdul Moelan and Siti Bida Undara. When the sultan tries to capture Siti Akbari, he discovers a body in her room and <b>believes</b> <b>it</b> to be hers. He takes his captives back to Hindustan and imprisons them.|$|E

Ricko left Jared a suicide note giving him his van, though Jared asks Cherie to dump the keys to the van in the ocean when she goes out surfing.|$|E

Reyes says that Doggett has spent the last few years convincing himself he did not see it. Reyes <b>believes</b> <b>it</b> was a psychic clue, and now with the other crime scene, she has seen it again.|$|E

5|$|Notwithstanding that in NASA's {{judgment}} {{the contractor}} later made {{significant progress in}} overcoming the problems, the committee <b>believes</b> <b>it</b> should have been informed of the situation.

However, that position in no way can be used as an argument for not bringing this or other serious situations {{to the attention of the}} committee.|$|E
5|$|One art {{historian}} suggests {{the painting was}} influenced by the works of Rosa Bonheur and Gustave Courbet, while another <b>believes</b> <b>it</b> was informed by those of the satirists William Hogarth and Honoré Daumier. The painting's humorous content contributed to its popularity among critics, collectors and the public at large, which led to Predić painting two replicas in 1918 and 1922. By 1890, the original was owned by the National Museum of Serbia, in whose possession it remains.|$|E
5|$|The Human Rights Campaign, a LGBT rights organization, has {{frequently}} given Ryan a 0/100 rating on its legislative scorecard.

On April 30, 2013, Ryan came {{out in favor of}} same-sex couples adopting children. Ryan said he had always supported civil unions, and that if the US Supreme Court declares the Defense of Marriage Act unconstitutional, then he <b>believes</b> <b>it</b> will become a federalist issue for states to decide same-sex marriage.|$|E

5|$|The keep {{was inside}} the inner bailey and {{contained}} the king's accommodation. It had two rooms: an antechamber and an audience room. While Allen Brown interpreted the audience room as the king's chamber, historian Liddiard <b>believes</b> <b>it</b> is probably a throne room. A throne room emphasises the political importance of the castle. In England there is nothing similar to Château Gaillard's keep, but there are buildings with a similar design in France in the 12th and 13th centuries.|$|E
5|$|Together {{with the}} north and south wall, the {{entrance}} of the narthex effectively isolates two smaller parts of the atrium, similar in plan and accessible through doors. The north part includes a small necropolis, while the south part was probably a baptistery, as it features a square installation with a clay pipe that resembles a baptismal font. However, Nikolova considers its shape much too unusual and its depth unsuitable for baptism, and <b>believes</b> <b>it</b> may instead have been designed as a vessel for dispensing holy water.|$|E
5|$|Ulysses appears {{larger than}} his fellow sailors, while the Sirens hold out their arms in {{traditional}} dramatic poses. The three Sirens {{are very similar}} in appearance, and Etty's biographer Leonard Robinson <b>believes</b> <b>it</b> likely that Etty painted the same model in three different poses. Robinson considers their classical poses {{to be the result}} of Etty's lifelong attendance at the Academy's Life Classes, where models were always in traditional poses, while former curator of York Art Gallery Richard Green considers their pose a tribute to the Nereids in Rubens's The Disembarkation at Marseilles, a work Etty is known to have admired and of which he made a copy in 1823.|$|E
