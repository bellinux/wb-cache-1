In one of them, Moberly claimed to {{have seen in the}} Louvre in 1914 an apparition of the Roman emperor Constantine, a man of unusual height wearing a gold crown and a toga; he was not observed <b>by</b> <b>anybody</b> else. During the First World War, Jourdain, the dominant personality of the pair who had succeeded as Principal of St. Hugh's, became convinced that a German spy was hiding in the college. After developing increasingly autocratic behaviour, she died suddenly in 1924 {{in the middle of an}} academic scandal over her leadership of the college, her conduct having provoked mass resignations of academic staff. Moberly died in 1937.|$|E

He also claimed numerous other romances, although he did not discuss his marriages, his wives, or his children in his autobiography. As a young man he was a family friend of Stella Adler's, whose daughter Ellen was a roommate of novelist Paula Fox. For a while, Brando and Fox lived under one roof and became close. Brando may have been the father of Fox's first child, daughter Linda Carroll, who was born in 1944. Linda was given up for adoption and is the mother of Courtney Love.

25|$|If a {{man held}} a peerage, his son would succeed to it; {{if he had}} no children, his brother would succeed. If he had a single daughter, his {{son-in-law}} would inherit the family lands, and usually the same Peerage; more complex cases were decided depending on circumstances. Customs changed with time; Earls {{were the first to}} be hereditary, and three different rules can be traced for the case of an Earl who left no sons and several married daughters. In the thirteenth century, the husband of the eldest daughter inherited the Earldom automatically; in the fifteenth century, the Earldom reverted to the Crown, who might regrant it (often to the eldest son-in-law); in the seventeenth century, it wouldn't be inherited <b>by</b> <b>anybody</b> unless {{all but one of the}} daughters died and left no descendants, in which case the remaining daughter (or her heir) would inherit.|$|E
25|$|Public {{buildings}} and monuments, secular and religious, by their nature normally address {{the whole of}} society, and visitors as viewers, and display {{to the general public}} has long been an important factor in their design. Egyptian temples are typical in that the most largest and most lavish decoration was placed on the parts that could be seen by the general public, rather than the areas seen only by the priests. Many areas of royal palaces, castles and the houses of the social elite were often generally accessible, and large parts of the art collections of such people could often be seen, either <b>by</b> <b>anybody,</b> or by those able to pay a small price, or those wearing the correct clothes, regardless of who they were, as at the Palace of Versailles, where the appropriate extra accessories (silver shoe buckles and a sword) could be hired from shops outside.|$|E
25|$|The colonists were {{followed}} by state employees, by Slovak farmers (including those who inherited land or bought it in a standard legal way with their own money) and later <b>by</b> <b>anybody</b> denoted as an unreliable. Lists of unreliable persons were prepared {{by members of the}} Hungarian United Party already before the First Vienna Award. The measures took place in a violent way with shooting, casualties and looting of Slovak and Czech stores and property. Military bodies usually did not react to complaints, or they openly declared that they would not do anything against offenders and violence. Under such conditions, many Slovaks and Czechs decided to leave the territory. In addition, they signed official statement that they moved voluntarily and all of their property (except items allowed to be exported) passed into the ownership of Hungary. In Gbelce (Köbölkút), three Czech colonists were shot dead and one hanged. Employees of public administration had to leave territory in 48 hours and they were replaced by administration from Hungary.|$|E

It is a relatively powerful little automobile <b>by</b> <b>anybody's</b> standards." [...] Motor Trend measured an early Prelude completing the quarter-mile in 18.8 seconds at 70 mph. In terms of underpinnings it was mostly a Honda Accord, although its more compact package and lower weight allowed for a marginally higher top speed and gas mileage.|$|R

60|$|The {{authors of}} the diaries allowed me to copy them exactly as they were written, and the {{extracts}} that I have given are without any smoothing over or revision. These diaries are finely modest and unaffected, and with unconscious and unintentional art they rise toward the climax with graduated and gathering force and swing and dramatic intensity; they sweep you along with a cumulative rush, and when the cry rings out at last, 'Land in sight!' your heart is in your mouth, {{and for a moment}} you think it is you that have been saved. The last two paragraphs are not improvable <b>by</b> <b>anybody's</b> art; they are literary gold; and their very pauses and uncompleted sentences have in them an eloquence not reachable by any words.|$|R
25|$|There {{followed}} {{in quick succession}} two musicals which have secured Kelly's reputation as a major figure in the American musical film, An American in Paris (1951) and – probably {{the most popular and}} admired of all film musicals – Singin' in the Rain (1952). As co-director, lead star and choreographer, Kelly was the central driving force. Johnny Green, head of music at MGM at the time, said of him:Gene is easygoing as long as you know exactly what you are doing when you're working with him. He's a hard taskmaster and he loves hard work. If you want to play on his team you'd better like hard work, too. He isn't cruel but he is tough, and if Gene believed in something he didn't care who he was talking to, whether it was Louis B. Mayer or the gatekeeper. He wasn't awed <b>by</b> <b>anybody,</b> and he had a good record of getting what he wanted.|$|E
25|$|After Penny’s autopsy {{revealed}} {{that she had}} ingested a lethal amount of liquid nicotine, Grissom and his team noted that there were traces of glue {{on the model of}} Penny’s back, and on the chair that she had been sitting in. This led them to believe that the killer had assumed that Penny would have died in her chair from her poisoned cherry brandy, not expecting her to go into convulsions. As Penny stood up in her spastic fits, the killer revealed herself, previously hiding behind Penny, and threw Penny through the window. With the miniature already made to depict Penny dead in her chair, the killer showed signs of obsessive habits, having to fix the model by rearranging it to match the actual death scene before it could be seen <b>by</b> <b>anybody</b> else. This explained why the miniature was not at the scene of death as the first one had been. A camera from Penny Garden's neighborhood showed Ernie Dell (Natalie's foster father) delivering the miniature wearing a jacket with a train symbol on the back.|$|E
25|$|Subsequent to the {{replacement}} of the Dundee foundry engine there is no record of the Stirling brothers having any further involvement with air engine development, and the Stirling engine never again competed with steam as an industrial scale power source. (Steam boilers were becoming safer and steam engines more efficient, thus presenting less of a target for rival prime movers). However, beginning about 1860, smaller engines of the Stirling/hot air type were produced in substantial numbers for applications in which reliable sources of low to medium power were required, such as pumping air for church organs or raising water. These smaller engines generally operated at lower temperatures so as not to tax available materials, and so were relatively inefficient. Their selling point was that unlike steam engines, they could be operated safely <b>by</b> <b>anybody</b> capable of managing a fire. Several types remained in production beyond the end of the century, but apart from a few minor mechanical improvements the design of the Stirling engine in general stagnated during this period.|$|E

Over the years Cornell has performed many near-miracles. She has made the yearning soul as good box office as the fiery body. She has made an invalid lady on a couch the essence of glamor. She has turned Shakespeare and Shaw into rousing hits.

500|$|Chandler upset many in {{the black}} {{community}} by voting against an anti-lynching bill soon after taking office. The bill levied fines against local governments and individual government officials in counties where illegal lynchings occurred. Of his vote against the bill, Chandler remarked, [...] "I am against lynching <b>by</b> <b>anybody</b> and of anybody, black or white, but the present bill carries penalties on local officials and local subdivisions which I think are too severe." [...] The bill passed in the House of Representatives, but died in the Senate. Later, Chandler joined with senators from other southern states in opposing the repeal of poll taxes, long used as a mechanism to prevent blacks from voting.|$|E

You must not indeed blame me for estimating Wordsworth at his height, {{and on the other}} side I readily confess to you that he is occasionally, and not unfrequently, heavy and dull, and that Coleridge had an intenser genius.

500|$|Ripken {{advanced}} {{even more}} in 1983, having what {{would be one of}} the best years of his career. He played well all season on the way to earning the first of 19 All-Star berths. Roommate Rick Dempsey gave this analysis of Ripken's performance: [...] "Certainly there were pitchers who faced him in 1982 and made or tried to make adjustments against him. But Cal was determined and worked hard to offset their adjustments." [...] At season's end, Ripken had set Orioles' records for RBI by a shortstop (102) and hits <b>by</b> <b>anybody</b> (211). He led the major leagues in hits and doubles (47) while also leading the AL with 121 runs scored. As a shortstop, he led the league in fielding percentage (.970), assists (534), and double plays (111), although he did not win the Gold Glove Award. After the season, he was named the AL Most Valuable Player (MVP), hitting [...]318 with 27 home runs. Ripken became the first player in MLB history to win Rookie of the Year and MVP Awards in consecutive seasons.|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé {{wanted a}} simple music video; it was filmed with minimal {{alternative}} camera shots and cuts, and no changes to hairstyles, costumes and sets. According to JaQuel Knight, Beyoncé also wanted the video to feel [...] "good and powerful" [...] and include choreography {{that could be}} attempted <b>by</b> <b>anybody.</b> The day the video was shot, the song was divided into three parts. Nava deliberately used lengthy shots so that viewers [...] "would connect with the human endeavor of Beyoncé's awe-inspiring dance", with all the changes in looks, angles, and lighting executed live on-camera {{because he wanted to}} keep the feel [...] "very organic and un-gimmicky". The styling was inspired by a Vogue photo shoot. In the video Beyoncé wears a titanium roboglove designed by her long-time jeweler, Lorraine Schwartz, to complement her alter ego Sasha Fierce. The glove consists of several pieces, including a ring and a separate component that covers Beyoncé's upper arm. She first wore the roboglove on the red carpet at the MTV Europe Music Awards on November 8, 2008. The video shoot took around twelvehours. Many performances of the song were filmed without interruption, and edited together {{to give the impression that}} the final video was filmed in a single take.|$|E
