5|$|In 1907, the Bread and Cheese Lands {{were sold}} for housing, and the {{resulting}} income allowed the annual dole to expand considerably, providing the widows and pensioners of Biddenden with cheese, bread and tea at Easter and with cash payments at Christmas. Biddenden cakes continue to <b>be</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> poor of Biddenden each Easter, and are sold as souvenirs to visitors.|$|E
5|$|The {{vertical}} intercept of the iso-profit line {{measures the}} level of profit that Robinson Crusoe's firm will make. This level of profit, Π, {{has the ability to}} purchase Π dollars worth of coconuts. Since PriceCoconuts is $1.00, Π number of coconuts can be purchased. Also, the firm will declare a dividend of Π dollars. This will <b>be</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> firm's sole shareholder, Crusoe himself.|$|E

5|$|An {{elaborate}} bureaucracy {{was created}} to regulate German imports of raw materials and finished goods {{with the intention of}} eliminating foreign competition in the German marketplace and improving the nation's balance of payments. The Nazis encouraged the development of synthetic replacements for materials such as oil and textiles. As the market was experiencing a glut and prices for petroleum were low, in 1933 the Nazi government made a profit-sharing agreement with IG Farben, guaranteeing them a 5 percent return on capital invested in their synthetic oil plant at Leuna. Any profits in excess of that amount would {{be turned over to the}} Reich. By 1936, Farben regretted making the deal, as the excess profits by then being generated had to <b>be</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> government.|$|E
5|$|Biofuels have {{a limited}} ability to replace fossil fuels {{and should not be}} {{regarded}} as a ‘silver bullet’ to deal with transport emissions. Biofuels on their own cannot deliver a sustainable transport system and so must be developed as part of an integrated approach, which promotes other renewable energy options and energy efficiency, as well as reducing the overall energy demand and need for transport. Consideration needs to <b>be</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> development of hybrid and fuel cell vehicles, public transport, and better town and rural planning.|$|E
5|$|Elevators, which operate {{differently}} {{depending on}} the hotel, enable the player to go between the five floors of the stage. The faster a stage is cleared, the more points will <b>be</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> player. Every stage has its own title screen via which the game can be saved. The screens are also used to enter previously played hotel stages and {{the map of the}} Mushroom Kingdom, which allows the player to access any visited hotel.|$|E

5|$|Georges Vezina {{collapsed}} {{during the}} first game of the 1925–26 season. He was diagnosed with tuberculosis and never played again, succumbing to the illness in March 1926. In his honour, the team donated a new award to the league, the Vezina Trophy, to <b>be</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> goaltender who allowed the fewest goals over the course of the season. The first recipient was his replacement, George Hainsworth. Vezina was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame upon its creation in 1945.|$|E
5|$|In 2004 an {{agreement}} was signed between the DGAM and the Italian General Direction for Development Cooperation for a joint mission to renovate and reorganize the citadel and the National Museum of Damascus. This mission started {{working in the}} citadel in 2007. Much attention will <b>be</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> reinforcement of damaged or structurally weak parts in the architecture. It is expected by the Syrian–Italian mission that, once renovations are finished, the citadel {{will be used for}} cultural and social events and activities.|$|E
5|$|In tribal societies, kilim were woven {{by women}} at {{different}} stages of their lives: before marriage, in readiness for married life; while married, for her children; and finally, kilim for her own funeral, to <b>be</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mosque. Kilims thus had strong personal and social significance in tribal and village cultures, being made for personal and family use. Feelings of happiness or sorrow, hopes and fears were expressed in the weaving motifs. Many of these represent familiar household and personal objects, such as a hairband, a comb, an earring, a trousseau chest, a jug, a hook.|$|E

5|$|Palmer {{gained an}} anti-settler {{reputation}} among immigrants, newspapers and officials, {{who said he}} acted too favorably toward the Indians, even though he moved the tribes to reservations outside the Willamette Valley, seeking to avoid friction between settlers and natives by physical distance. In late 1855, while moving the Rogue River tribes to the Grand Ronde Reservation, violent resistance was threatened by settlers who felt the land should not <b>be</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tribes. Palmer succeeded, but the territorial legislature petitioned for his removal from office, which became effective in 1857.|$|E
5|$|Religious beliefs were {{central to}} the Kingdom of Nri. Nri oral {{tradition}} states that a bounty of yams and cocoyams could <b>be</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> eze Nri, while blessings were given in return. It was believed that Nri's influence and bountiful amount of food was a reward for the ruler's blessings. Above all, Nri was a holy land for those Igbo who followed its edicts. It served {{as a place where}} sins and taboos could be absolved just by entering it. Even Igbo living far from the center of power would send abnormal children to Nri for ritual cleansing rather than having them killed, as was sometimes the case for dwarfs or children who cut their top teeth before their lower teeth.|$|E
5|$|She {{was known}} for her honesty and {{moderate}} life style. Having received a small scholarship in 1893, she returned it in 1897 {{as soon as she}} began earning her keep. She gave much of her first Nobel Prize money to friends, family, students, and research associates. In an unusual decision, Curie intentionally refrained from patenting the radium-isolation process, so that the scientific community could do research unhindered. She insisted that monetary gifts and awards <b>be</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> scientific institutions she was affiliated with rather than to her. She and her husband often refused awards and medals. Albert Einstein reportedly remarked that she was probably the only person who could not be corrupted by fame.|$|E

5|$|The National Assembly by a {{proposal}} of the President of Vietnam elects the prime minister.

Finally, the deputies of the National Assembly have the right to question the prime minister and other members of government.|$|E
5|$|The River Weaver is a river, navigable in {{its lower}} reaches, {{running in a}} curving route {{anti-clockwise}} across west Cheshire, northern England. Improvements to the river to make it navigable were authorised in 1720 and the work, which included eleven locks, was completed in 1732. An unusual clause in the enabling Act of Parliament stipulated that profits should <b>be</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> County of Cheshire {{for the improvement of}} roads and bridges, but the navigation was not initially profitable, and it was 1775 before the first payments were made. Trade continued to rise, and by 1845, over £500,000 had been given to the county.|$|E
5|$|The match {{ended when}} Lex Luger and Bret Hart {{simultaneously}} eliminated each other. Two referees argued about who had landed first while several inconclusive camera angles were broadcast. Eventually, WWF President Jack Tunney {{came to the}} ring and had Finkel announce that both men would be considered winners. The situation regarding the title shot at WrestleMania X, which was to <b>be</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> winner, remained unresolved until the following week on Monday Night Raw.|$|E

5|$|The two {{earliest}} codes {{were concerned}} with clerical matters, and Æthelstan stated that he acted {{on the advice of}} Wulfhelm and his bishops. The first asserts the importance of paying tithes to the church. The second enforces the duty of charity on Æthelstan's reeves, specifying the amount to <b>be</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> poor and requiring reeves to free one penal slave annually. His religious outlook is shown in a wider sacralization of the law in his reign.|$|E
5|$|When {{a person}} dies, a doctor will certify {{the cause of}} death if it is known and due to natural causes. He or she will then fill up a {{certificate}} of cause of death (CCOD) which will <b>be</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> family of the deceased. If the doctor is unable to determine {{the cause of death}}, or the death is due to non-natural causes, the Criminal Procedure Code requires him to refer the case to the police. The police will provide a hearse to send the body to the Centre for Forensic Medicine (CFM) Mortuary at Block 9 of the Singapore General Hospital, which will then inform the family when to visit the mortuary.|$|E
5|$|Alderson enjoyed {{an active}} retirement, {{becoming}} Colonel Commandant of the Royal West Kent Regiment and pursuing hunting and yachting with fervour, being an active master of foxhounds of the South Shropshire Hunt {{and member of}} the Royal Norfolk and Suffolk Yacht Club. He was also very concerned that the growing popularity of motor sports would result in the demise of these traditional pastimes and expended much energy promoting them. After living the last few years of his life on a houseboat moored in Oulton Broad, he died in December 1927 of a sudden heart attack at Lowestoft and was buried at Chesterton, Oxfordshire, survived by his wife. She later arranged for his private papers to <b>be</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nation and they are currently stored at British Library and the National Archives of Zimbabwe.|$|E
