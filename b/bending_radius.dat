5000|$|In {{sheet metal}} design, the K-factor {{is used to}} {{calculate}} how much sheet metal one needs to leave for the bend in order to achieve particular final dimensions, especially for between the straight sides next the bend. Use the known k-factor and the known inner <b>bending</b> <b>radius</b> to calculate the <b>bending</b> <b>radius</b> of the neutral line. Then use the neutral <b>bending</b> <b>radius</b> to calculate the arc length of the neutral line ("circumference of circle" [...] multiplied by the [...] "bend angle as fraction of 360deg"). The arc length of the neutral line is the length of the sheet metal you have to leave for the bend.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bend</b> <b>radius,</b> {{which is}} {{measured}} {{to the inside}} curvature, is the minimum <b>radius</b> one can <b>bend</b> a pipe, tube, sheet, cable or hose without kinking it, damaging it, or shortening its life.

The simulation results show that, {{with the increase of}} the <b>bend</b> <b>radius,</b> the peak flow will be continuously increased, and the fundamental diagram will become more {{similar to that of the}} classic NaSch model; the smaller the <b>bend</b> <b>radius</b> is, the easier it is for the occurrence of blockage; for different bend lengths, all the corresponding traffic flows show that the phenomenon of go-and-stop and the bends exert slight inhibitory effect on traffic flow; under the same <b>bend</b> <b>radius,</b> the inhibition effect of the bends on the traffic flow will be weakened with the increase of the friction coefficiency...|$|R

50|$|Overbending of {{the cable}} occurs when the cable is bent in a radius of less than the minimum <b>bending</b> <b>radius</b> defined by the manufacturer. Although the cable may {{initially}} survive the overbending, {{this can lead to}} subsequent fatigue within the cable ultimately leading to cable failure. The CPS selected should maintain a radius which is greater than the specified minimum bend radius.|$|E
5000|$|Track ropes (full locked ropes) {{have to act}} as rails for the rollers of cabins {{or other}} loads in aerial ropeways and cable cranes. In {{contrast}} to running ropes, track ropes do not take on the curvature of the rollers. Under the roller force, a so-called free <b>bending</b> <b>radius</b> of the rope occurs. This radius increases (and the bending stresses decrease) with the tensile force and decreases with the roller force.|$|E

40|$|Understanding bend-loss in single-ring hollow-core {{photonic}} crystal fibers is becoming of increasing importance as the fibers enter practical applications. While purely numerical approaches are useful, {{there is a}} need for a simpler analytical formalism that provides physical insight and can be directly used in the design of PCFs with low bend-loss. We show theoretically and experimentally that a wavelength-dependent critical <b>bend</b> <b>radius</b> exists below which the bend-loss reaches a maximum, and that this can be calculated from the structural parameters of a fiber using a simple analytical formula. This allows straightforward design of single-ring PCFs that are bend-insensitive for specified ranges of <b>bend</b> <b>radius</b> and wavelength. It also can be used to derive an expression for the <b>bend</b> <b>radius</b> that yields optimal higher-order mode suppression for a given fiber structure...|$|R
40|$|Bending loss in {{silicon-on-insulator}} rib waveguides {{was calculated}} using conformal mapping of the curved waveguide to an equivalent straight waveguide. Finite-element analysis with perfectly matched layer boundaries {{was used to}} solve the vector wave equation. Transmission loss was experimentally measured {{as a function of}} <b>bend</b> <b>radius</b> for several SOI waveguides. Good agreement was found between simulated and measured losses, and this technique was confirmed as a good predictor for loss and for minimum <b>bend</b> <b>radius</b> for efficient design...|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} conveyor uses {{a specially}} designed plastic crescent top chain. The chain actually runs on its side (on its link plates), with the crescent plate attached {{to the other side}} plate by means of a snap pin. This gives the chain a very small <b>bending</b> <b>radius</b> and allows the conveyor to make the tight corners found in most conveyor belt sushi restaurants. Further, the horizontal layout means that there is no return side of the chain, which not only eliminates chain sag and sliding with the roller, but allows for a much shallower design.|$|E
50|$|Flexible electronics, {{also known}} as flex circuits, is a {{technology}} for assembling electronic circuits by mounting electronic devices on flexible plastic substrates, such as polyimide, PEEK or transparent conductive polyester film. Additionally, flex circuits can be screen printed silver circuits on polyester. Flexible electronic assemblies may be manufactured using identical components used for rigid printed circuit boards, allowing the board to conform to a desired shape, or to flex during its use. An alternative approach to flexible electronics suggests various etching techniques to thin down the traditional silicon substrate to few tens of micrometers to gain reasonable flexibility, referred to as flexible silicon (~ 5 mm <b>bending</b> <b>radius).</b>|$|E
50|$|The minimum {{bend radius}} is of {{particular}} importance in the handling of fiber-optic cables, which are often used in telecommunications. The minimum <b>bending</b> <b>radius</b> will vary with different cable designs. The manufacturer should specify the minimum radius to which the cable may safely be bent during installation, and for the long term. The former is somewhat smaller than the latter. The {{minimum bend radius}} is in general also a function of tensile stresses, e.g., during installation, while being bent around a sheave while the fiber or cable is under tension. If no minimum bend radius is specified, one is usually safe in assuming a minimum long-term low-stress radius not less than 15 times the cable diameter.|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of grating length and <b>bend</b> <b>radius</b> of long-period gratings (LPGs) on refractive index sensing was examined. Sensitivity to refractive indexes {{smaller than that}} of silica could be enhanced by bending LPGs. Bent LPGs lost sensitivity to refractive indexes {{higher than that of}} silica, whereas a 20 -mm-long LPG arranged in a straight line had considerable sensitivity. These experimental results demonstrated that the sensitivity characteristics of LPGs to refractive index could be controlled by grating length and <b>bend</b> <b>radius...</b>|$|R

Finally is shown that bend-radius tuning during fabrication of such filters is a means of mitigating the effect of manufacturing variations...|$|R

5000|$|Rotary draw bending (RDB) is {{a precise}} technology, since it bends using tooling or [...] "die sets" [...] {{which have a}} {{constant}} center line radius (CLR), alternatively indicated as Mean <b>Bending</b> <b>Radius</b> (Rm). Rotary draw benders can be programmable to store multiple bend jobs {{with varying degrees of}} bending. Often a positioning index table (IDX) is attached to the bender allowing the operator to reproduce complex bends which can have multiple bends and differing planes.Rotary draw benders are the most popular machines for use in bending tube, pipe and solids for applications like: handrails, frames, motor vehicle roll cages, handles, lines and much more. Rotary draw benders create aesthetically pleasing bends when the right tooling is matched to the application.CNC rotary draw bending machines can be very complex and use sophisticated tooling to produce severe bends with high quality requirements.The complete tooling is required only for high-precision bending of difficult-to-bend tubes with relatively large OD/t (diameter/thickness) ratio and relatively small ratio between the mean <b>bending</b> <b>radius</b> Rm and OD. The use of axial boosting either on the tube free end or on the pressure die is useful to prevent excessive thinning and collapse of the extrados of the tube. The mandrel, with or without ball with spherical links, is mostly used to prevent wrinkles and ovalization. For relatively easy bending processes (that is, as the difficulty factor BF decreases), the tooling can be progressively simplified, eliminating the need for the axial assist, the mandrel, and the wiper die (which mostly prevents wrinkling). Furthermore, in some particular cases, the standard tooling must be modified in order to meet specific requirements of the products.|$|E
50|$|The Three-Roll Push Bending (TRPB) is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used freeform-bending process to manufacture bending geometries consisting of several plane bending curves. Nevertheless, a 3D-shaping is possible. The profile is guided between bending-roll and supporting-roll(s), while being pushed through the tools. The position of the forming-roll defines the <b>bending</b> <b>radius.</b> The bending point is the tangent-point between tube and bending-roll. To change the bending plane, the pusher rotates the tube around its longitudinal axis. Generally, a TRPB tool kit can be applied on a conventional rotary draw bending machine. The process is very flexible since with a unique tool set, several bending radii values Rm can be obtained, although the geometrical precision of the process is not comparable to rotary draw bending. Bending contours defined as spline- or polynomial-functions can be manufactured.|$|E
50|$|In bottoming, {{the sheet}} is forced against the V {{opening in the}} bottom tool. U-shaped {{openings}} cannot be used. Space is left between the sheet and {{the bottom of the}} V opening. The optimum width of the V opening is 6 T (T stands for material thickness) for sheets about 3 mm thick, up to about 12 T for 12 mm thick sheets. The <b>bending</b> <b>radius</b> must be at least 0.8 T to 2 T for sheet steel. Larger bend radius require about the same force as larger radii in air bending, however, smaller radii require greater force—up to five times as much—than air bending. Advantages of bottoming include greater accuracy and less springback. A disadvantage is that a different tool set is needed for each bend angle, sheet thickness, and material. In general, air bending is the preferred technique.|$|E
50|$|Air bending {{does not}} require the bottom tool to have the same radius as the punch. <b>Bend</b> <b>radius</b> is {{determined}} by material elasticity rather than tool shape.|$|R

Experiments show that sub-millimeter <b>bending</b> <b>radii</b> are achieved using a splayed molecular orientation. Systems with a splayed or twisted nematic (TN) director profile drive greater amplitude and faster bending than uniaxial planar systems with the same chemical composition.

50|$|Ceramic fibres in CMCs {{can have}} a {{polycrystalline}} structure, as in conventional ceramics. They can also be amorphous or have inhomogeneous chemical composition, which develops upon pyrolysis of organic precursors. The high process temperatures required for making CMCs preclude the use of organic, metallic or glass fibres. Only fibres stable at temperatures above 1000 °C can be used, such as fibres of alumina, mullite, SiC, zirconia or carbon. Amorphous SiC fibres have an elongation capability above 2% - much larger than in conventional ceramic materials (0.05 to 0.10%). The reason for this property of SiC fibres {{is that most of}} them contain additional elements like oxygen, titanium and/or aluminium yielding a tensile strength above 3 GPa. These enhanced elastic properties are required for various three-dimensional fibre arrangements (see example in figure) in textile fabrication, where a small <b>bending</b> <b>radius</b> is essential.|$|E
