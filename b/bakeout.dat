50|$|The MSSL Mechanical {{engineering}} group {{operates a}} number of test facilities which include a vacuum <b>bakeout</b> facility, thermal vacuum facility, a vibration facility, a cleanroom facility, Laser and Sputter coating facility, a Westbond wire bonding facility, ultrasonic cleaning facilities, and a mechanical engineering workshop.|$|E
50|$|Materials outgas {{by three}} mechanisms: release of absorbed gases, release of adsorbed gases, and {{evaporation}} {{of the material}} itself. The former can be reduced by a <b>bakeout,</b> the latter is an intrinsic property of the material. Some outgassed materials can deposit on other surfaces, contaminate the vacuum system and be difficult to get rid of.|$|E
40|$|A {{large amount}} of {{chemical}} analysis data involving identification of outgassing products from spacecraft, experiment modules, and support equipment accumulated at the Goddard Space Flight Center {{over the past ten}} years were reduced to a computer compatible format and subjected to a variety of relevant program operations. From these data a list of the most troublesome outgassing species were compiled and several useful and interesting materials' correlations were developed. The frequency of occurrence totals show that in aerospace program, di(2 -ethyl hexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is the most often found individual species in outgassing samples and that esters are the leading generic class of compounds. The effectiveness of this data bank was demonstrated by the good correlations between materials and their outgassing products for solar panel <b>bakeouts</b> and cable <b>bakeouts.</b> However, trends in frequency of occurrence of many compounds were demonstrated where no correlation could be established. In the case of the class of compounds called aliphatic hydrocarbons, it is shown that the number of instances of significant outgassing due to these materials is increasing...|$|R
40|$|After launch, the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS), a {{focal plane}} {{instrument}} on the Chandra X-ray Observatory, suffered radiation damage {{from exposure to}} soft protons during passages through the Earth's radiation belts. An effect of the damage was to increase the charge transfer inefficiency (CTI) of the front illuminated CCDs. As part of the initial damage assessment, the focal plane was warmed from the operating temperature of - 100 C to + 30 C which unexpectedly further increased the CTI. We report results of ACIS CCD irradiation experiments in the lab aimed at better understanding this reverse annealing process. Six CCDs were irradiated cold by protons ranging in energy from 100 keV to 400 keV, and then subjected to simulated <b>bakeouts</b> {{in one of three}} annealing cycles. We present results of these lab experiments, compare them to our previous experiences on the ground and in flight, and derive limits on the annealing time constants.

40|$|The Extreme UV Imaging Telescope (EIT) {{instrument}} is operating on-board the SOHO spacecraft since January 1996. EIT is providing EUV {{observations of the}} solar corona in four narrow channels: 171, 195, 284 and 304 Å. Due to continuous exposure to the EUV solar irradiation, the instrument performance is continuously evolving. The backside thinned detector is showing important changes in its overall response and local damages of EUV highly exposed areas. These performance modifications can be characterized through several observation analyses that are discussed in this paper. Two major effects are identified: contamination on the detector surface and charge mobility changes in the CCD produced by the EUV irradiation. To restore the instrument response, <b>bakeouts</b> are regularly planned as well as specific observation sequences {{that are used to}} characterize the detector damages. An overview of the instrument response behavior is presented in this paper. To cross calibrate this instrument, the spare components of the EIT program were assembled in a new structure used as the EIT Calroc Sounding Rocket instrument. The Calroc flight successfully occurred in October 97 and gathered very useful data that provide additional means to cross calibrate the EIT-SOHO instrument. The Calroc results and their use to improve the EIT-SOHO data are discussed. This sounding rocket mission demonstrated good correlations of the performanc...|$|R
5000|$|Solders are {{sometimes}} unavoidable for soft-soldered joints. Tin-lead solders (Sn50Pb50, Sn60Pb40, Sn63Pb37) can be conditionally used when the apparatus {{is not to}} be baked and operating temperatures aren't elevated (lead tends to outgas). A better choice for vacuum systems is the tin-silver eutectic, Sn95Ag5; its melting point of 230 °C allows <b>bakeout</b> up to 200 °C. A similar 95-5 alloy, Sn95Sb5, is unsuitable as antimony has similar vapor pressure as lead. Take care to remove flux residues.|$|E
50|$|While not {{necessarily}} employing conventional inkjet technology, various other powder-binder combinations may be deployed to form objects by chemical or mechanical means. The resulting parts may then {{be subjected to}} different post-processing regimes, such as infiltration or <b>bakeout.</b> This may be done, for example, to eliminate the mechanical binder (e.g., by burning) and consolidate the core material (e.g., by melting), or to form a composite material blending the properties of powder and binder. Depending on the material, full color printing {{may or may not}} be an option. As of 2014, inventors and manufacturers have developed systems for forming objects from sand and calcium carbonate (forming a synthetic marble), acrylic powder and cyanoacrylate, ceramic powder and a liquid binder, sugar and water (for making candies), etc.|$|E
50|$|Metals with {{sufficiently}} low hydrogen diffusion can {{be turned}} into deuterium targets by bombardment of deuterons until the metal is saturated. Gold targets under such condition show four times higher efficiency than titanium. Even better results can be achieved with targets made of a thin film of a high-absorption high-diffusivity metal (e.g. titanium) on a substrate with low hydrogen diffusivity (e.g. silver), as the hydrogen is then concentrated on the top layer and can not diffuse away into the bulk of the material. Using a deuterium-tritium gas mixture, self-replenishing D-T targets can be made. The neutron yield of such targets is lower than of tritium-saturated targets in deuteron beams, but their advantage is much longer lifetime and constant level of neutron production. Self-replenishing targets are also tolerant to high-temperature bake-out of the tubes, as their saturation with hydrogen isotopes is performed after the <b>bakeout</b> and tube sealing.|$|E
40|$|The new GSI {{accelerator}} facilities (FAIR project) {{are planned}} to deliver heavy ion beams of increased energy and highest intensity [1]. Whereas the energy is {{planned to be}} increased roughly {{by a factor of}} 30, the ion beam intensities are planned to be enlarged by three orders of magnitude. To achieve highest beam intensities, medium charged heavy ions (e. g. U 28 +) are accelerated. Since the ionization cross sections for these ions are comparably high, a UHV-accelerator system with a base pressure in the low 10 - 12 mbar regime is required, even under the influence of ion beam loss induced desorption processes. An intensive program was started to upgrade the UHV system of the existing synchrotron SIS 18 (bakeable) and to design and lay out the UHV systems of the future synchrotrons SIS 100 and SIS 300 (mainly cryogenic). One special technical difficulty common to SIS 18 and SIS 100 is the restriction on thin walled (< 0. 5 mm), large aperture vacuum chambers, which have to withstand 300 °C <b>bakeouts</b> or liquid helium temperatures inside the fast cycling magnets (minimum eddy – currents). The strategy of this program includes basic research on the physics of the ion induced desorption effects as well as technical developments, design and prototyping on bakeable UHV components (vacuum chambers, diagnostics, bakeout-control, pumping speed), collimator for controlled ion beam loss, NEG coating and cryogenic vacuum components...|$|R
5000|$|Maintaining UHV {{conditions}} {{requires the}} use of unusual materials for equipment. Heating of the entire system above 100 °C for many hours ("baking") to remove water and other trace gases which adsorb on the surfaces of the chamber is required upon [...] "cycling" [...] the equipment to atmosphere. To save time, energy, and integrity of the UHV volume an [...] "interlock" [...] is often used. The interlock volume has one door or valve facing the UHV side of the volume, and another door against atmospheric pressure through which samples or workpieces are initially introduced. After sample introduction and assuring that the door against atmosphere is closed, the interlock volume is typically pumped down to a medium-high vacuum. In some cases the workpiece itself is baked out or otherwise pre-cleaned under this medium-high vacuum. The gateway to the UHV chamber is then opened, the workpiece transferred to the UHV by robotic means or by other contrivance if necessary, and the UHV valve re-closed. While the initial workpiece is being processed under UHV, a subsequent sample can be introduced into the interlock volume, pre-cleaned, and so-on and so-forth, saving much time. Although a [...] "puff" [...] of gas is generally released into the UHV system when the valve to the interlock volume is opened, the UHV system pumps can generally snatch this gas away before it has time to adsorb onto the UHV surfaces. In a system well designed with suitable interlocks, the UHV components seldom need <b>bakeout</b> and the UHV may improve over time even as workpieces are introduced and removed.|$|E
50|$|In a {{delay line}} {{detector}} the electrons are accelerated to 500 eV between {{the back of}} the last MCP and a grid. Then they fly for 5 mm and are dispersed over an area of 2 mm. A grid follows. Each element has a diameter of 1 mm and consists of an electrostatic lens focusing arriving electrons through a 30 µm hole of a grounded sheet of aluminium. Behind that a cylinder of the same size follows. The electron cloud induces a 300 ps negative pulse when entering the cylinder and a positive when leaving. After that another sheet, a second cylinder follows, and a last sheet follows. Effectively the cylinders are fused into the center-conductor of a stripline. The sheets minimize cross talk between the layers and adjacent lines in the same layer, which would lead to signal dispersion and ringing. These striplines meander across the anode to connect all cylinders, to offer each cylinder 50 Ω impedance, and to generate a position dependent delay. Because the turns in the stripline adversely affect the signal quality their number is limited and for higher resolutions multiple independent striplines are needed. At both ends the meanders are connected to detector electronics. These electronics convert the measured delays into X- (first layer) and Y-coordinates (second layer). Sometimes a hexagonal grid and 3 coordinates are used. This redundancy reduces the dead space-time by reducing the maximum travel distance and thus the maximum delay, allowing for faster measurements. The microchannel plate detector must not operate over around 60 degree Celsius, otherwise it will degrade rapidly, <b>bakeout</b> without voltage has no influence.|$|E
40|$|Three {{electropolished}} one-cell cavities {{were measured}} {{before and after}} in-situ <b>bakeout</b> under ultra-high vacuum conditions. Before <b>bakeout</b> the cavities showed a strong reduction in quality factor at fields above 25 MV/m. After the <b>bakeout</b> the Q drop was no longer present and gradients of up to 39 MV/m were achieved. This indicates that electropolishing yields highest accelerating gradients in niobium cavities only in combination with in-situ <b>bakeout...</b>|$|E

40|$|A thermal {{vacuum box}} <b>bakeout</b> and {{certification}} allows orbital payloads {{to be cleaned}} and certified when the background TQCM measurements (a measure of how much molecular contamination is on a payload or chamber) are unacceptable or unmanageable in the standard thermal vacuum chamber. The box <b>bakeout</b> procedure is usually performed in 4 steps: <b>bakeout</b> the box, certify the box, bake out the payload, and finally certify the payload. In the procedure's current setup, the contaminant conduction hole ("lid") is initially open and a vacuum chamber break must occur between the <b>bakeout</b> and certification phases to close the box from the vacuum chamber. This exposure is necessary to allow the outgassed contaminants to escape the box's volume rapidly during <b>bakeout</b> phase, but payload certification isn't usually performed while the lid is still open, because it exposes the payload, TQCM, and box volume to chamber contaminants. The Remotely Operated <b>Bakeout</b> Box Shutter (ROBBS) is a new facility design and will allow the remote closure of the contamination hole while the chamber is still under vacuum, and {{with little or no}} time to do so...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{restricted}} {{space for the}} heaters and insulation in the normal conducting magnets of the HERA proton ring, the <b>bakeout</b> process must be done very carefully {{in order to prevent}} damage of the magnets. A special high temperature thermal insulating material allows <b>bakeout</b> of the stainless steel vacuum chambers by a heating jacket as thin as 3. 5 mm. When built into a normal conducting accelerator magnet, a <b>bakeout</b> temperature of 300 °C is achieved without overheating the surrounding magnet. After more than 24 h the maximum temperature of 68 °C reached at the sensitive coil of the magnet is well below the 80 °C critical temperature of the epoxy. With the described <b>bakeout</b> system no heat sink is necessary to protect the magnet's components from the high temperatures. Control and regulation of the temperature of the vacuum chambers are done by means of thermocouple probes, attached to the outer surface of the chambers near the coaxial heating elements...|$|E

40|$|AbstractStandard {{circular}} ConFlat® (CF) flanges {{are widely}} used in industry due to their high sealing reliability after being subjected to a <b>bakeout</b> process. The Beam Gas Ionisation (BGI) instrument for the CERN Proton Synchrotron accelerator will require a CF-like rectangular sealing system. Although rectangular CF-type flanges with plastically deforming metal seals have been used, no published designs with validated tests for <b>bakeout</b> under UHV conditions are available. Existing circular CERN CF flanges were compared and a design for a rectangular CF flange was proposed. Two prototypes were manufactured along with copper gaskets. The flanges and gaskets were cleaned and prepared for extensive vacuum testing after <b>bakeout</b> cycles up to 350  °C. This paper summarises the design, analysis and manufacturing process and describes the testing procedures and results.

40|$|Low {{secondary}} electron emission yield (l- 1. 3), 1 ow rf-loss films are of interest as coatings for alumina ceramic high power klystron windows. Very thin (15 - 50 A) Ti and TiN layers have been previously used with success in klystron tubes operating at lower power levels (< 35 MW peak power) and short (2. 5 hsec) pulses but are subject to property changes during air exposure, tube <b>bakeout</b> (55 OOC for up to 10 days) and in-situ electron bombardment.

The most important part of a heat pipe is the wick, which transports the sodium over the heated surface area. Bench scale heat pipes were designed and built to more economically, both in time and money, test different wicks and cleaning procedures.
