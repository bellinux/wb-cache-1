5|$|With Maryland voters, Mathias {{benefited from}} his {{frequent}} disagreements with the Nixon administration and his liberal voting record. On November 5, 1974, he was re-elected by a 57% to 43% margin, though he lost <b>badly</b> <b>in</b> Baltimore City and Baltimore County, where Mikulski was popular.|$|E
5|$|About 20officers then marched {{him away}} from Pearl Roundabout. Alekry said that while walking him, riot police also broke his nose and damaged his left eye so <b>badly</b> <b>in</b> the process that he {{temporarily}} lost his sight. He was then taken to a police bus, where his pants were pulled down by an officer who threatened Alekry with sexual assault; though the threat was not carried out.|$|E
5|$|After the {{assassination}} of the King at the Stockholm opera in 1792, support for the liberal arts was withdrawn. Bellman, already in poor health from alcoholism, went into decline, drinking increasingly heavily. His drinking very likely contributed to his gout, which troubled him <b>badly</b> <b>in</b> 1790. He also caught tuberculosis: the disease had already killed his mother, and by the winter of 1792, he was seriously ill.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{function}} u on {{the unit}} circle T {{is said to be}} <b>badly</b> approximable <b>in</b> the weighted space Lp(T, w) if ‖u+ f‖Lp(T,w) ≥ ‖u‖Lp(T,w) for all f ∈ H∞. We prove that if an unimodular function u is <b>badly</b> approximable <b>in</b> Lp(T, w) for all p ∈ (0,+∞) and some non-zero weight w, then u is an inner function. We describe the inner functions Θ and the weights w {{on the unit}} circle T such that Θ is <b>badly</b> approximable <b>in</b> Lp(T, w) for all p> 0. It turns out that, for given inner functions Θ, the class of all weights satisfying the above-mentioned condition depends only on the zero set of Θ. In other words, Θ is <b>badly</b> approximable <b>in</b> Lp(T, w) for all p ∈ (0,+∞) if and only if B is <b>badly</b> approximable <b>in</b> Lp(T, w) for all p ∈ (0,+∞), where B is a Blaschke product with simple zeros and such that Θ− 1 (0) = B− 1 (0) ...|$|R

5|$|As the {{paperback}} book came into fashion, lesbian themes were relegated to pulp fiction. Many of the pulp novels typically presented very unhappy women, or relationships that ended tragically. Marijane Meaker later wrote {{that she was}} told to make the relationship end <b>badly</b> <b>in</b> Spring Fire because the publishers {{were concerned about the}} books being confiscated by the U.S. Postal Service. Patricia Highsmith, writing as Claire Morgan, wrote The Price of Salt in 1951 and refused to follow this directive, but instead used a pseudonym.|$|E
5|$|Kapil's term as Indian cricket team's {{national}} {{coach was}} not considered a success due to poor on-field performances. During Kapil's reign as National Coach, India performed <b>badly</b> <b>in</b> away matches and managed just 3 victories in 15 games (20%) in ODI Tournaments. In Test cricket, India lost its first home series in 13 years and managed just 1 victory in 3 Test series.|$|E
5|$|McCain had {{fundraising}} {{problems in}} the first half of 2007, due in part to his support for the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, which was unpopular among the Republican base electorate. Large-scale campaign staff downsizing took place in early July, but McCain said that he was not considering dropping out of the race. Later that month, the candidate's campaign manager and campaign chief strategist both departed. McCain slumped <b>badly</b> <b>in</b> national polls, often running third or fourth with 15percent or less support.|$|E

5|$|The {{record of}} the 1969 and 1970 Montreal Junior Canadiens in the playoffs was so {{outstanding}} it caused a change in Memorial Cup eligibility rules. Previously, all Junior clubs in Canada were eligible for the cup, but the Junior Canadiens beat a club from Prince Edward Island so <b>badly</b> <b>in</b> the playoffs that 'Junior A' was re-organized into 'Major Junior' and 'Junior A'. Since then, only Major Junior clubs are eligible for the Cup.|$|E
5|$|The {{violence}} in the pre-climax sequences was toned down to match the sensibilities of the Telugu audience after Venkatesh expressed scepticism {{as to whether the}} audience would accept him getting beaten up <b>badly</b> <b>in</b> the police station. During set construction for the police station and the house in the film, the producer and the director {{wanted to get rid of}} some coconut trees. However, art director Vivek managed to erect those sets without cutting down any trees.|$|E
5|$|Donna Freedman (also Brown) is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the Australian soap opera Neighbours, played by Margot Robbie. Believing she had performed <b>badly</b> <b>in</b> the audition, Robbie went on holiday to Canada. She then learned {{she had won}} the part and {{had to return to}} Australia to begin filming. She made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 2 June 2008. Donna was initially introduced as a guest character, but Robbie was promoted to the regular cast shortly after she made her debut. In April 2010, it was revealed that Robbie had told producers she would like to leave when her contract expired {{at the end of the}} year. Five months later, it was announced that Robbie had quit Neighbours and she departed on 26 January 2011.|$|E

5|$|Early in his {{political}} career, Piłsudski became {{a leader of}} the Polish Socialist Party. Concluding that Poland's independence would have to be won by force of arms, he created the Polish Legions. In 1914 he anticipated the outbreak of a European war, the Russian Empire's defeat by the Central Powers, and the Central Powers' defeat by the western powers. When World War I broke out, he and his Legions fought under Austrian army control against Russia. In 1917, with Russia faring <b>badly</b> <b>in</b> the war, he withdrew his support for the Central Powers and was arrested by the Germans.|$|E
5|$|Establishing {{an early}} {{reputation}} {{playing for the}} Shannon Club in Trinidad, St Hill was selected for Trinidad in 1912 and played in every Inter-Colonial Tournament until 1930. Although he missed selection for the 1923 tour of England, he played for representative West Indian sides in 1926 against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and scored a century against the tourists for Trinidad. Success in trial matches led to his selection for the 1928 tour of England where he failed <b>badly.</b> <b>In</b> 1930, he hit another century for Trinidad against MCC and was chosen for one final Test, after {{which he did not}} play any further first-class cricket.|$|E
5|$|In 1636 {{the space}} beneath the south west tower became a bishop's consistory court. It was {{furnished}} as such at that time, {{and is now}} a unique survival in England, hearing its last case, that of an attempted suicide of a priest, in the 1930s. Until 1881, the south transept, which is unusually large, also took on a separate function as an independent ecclesiastical entity: the parish church of St Oswald. Although the 17thcentury saw additions to the furnishings and fittings, there was no further building work for several centuries. By the 19thcentury, the building was <b>badly</b> <b>in</b> need of restoration. The present homogeneous appearance that the cathedral presents from many exterior angles is largely the work of Victorian restorers, particularly George Gilbert Scott.|$|E

5|$|In July 1857, Macdonald {{departed}} for Britain to promote Canadian government projects. On {{his return to}} Canada, he was appointed premier {{in place of the}} retiring Taché, just in time to lead the Conservatives in a general election. Macdonald was elected in Kingston by 1,189votes to 9 for John Shaw, who was subsequently hanged in effigy; other Conservatives, however, did <b>badly</b> <b>in</b> Canada West, and only French-Canadian support kept Macdonald in power. On 28 December, Isabella Macdonald died, leaving John A. Macdonald a widower with a seven-year-old son. Hugh John Macdonald would be principally raised by his paternal aunt and her husband.|$|E
5|$|In Week 3 of the 2005 season, both Pennington and {{backup quarterback}} Jay Fiedler were injured against the Jaguars. With both quarterbacks {{out for the}} season, third-string quarterback Brooks Bollinger started; the 41-year-old Testaverde was brought out of {{retirement}} to serve as his backup. Bollinger played <b>badly</b> <b>in</b> a loss in week four, and Testaverde became the starter. Testaverde had little success, and Bollinger did not fare better when he was re-inserted. Running back Curtis Martin chose to have arthroscopic surgery on his knee with four games left in the season. The Jets finished 4–12.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1860s and 1870s, Wallace was very {{concerned}} about the financial security of his family. While he was in the Malay Archipelago, the sale of specimens had brought in a considerable amount of money, which had been carefully invested by the agent who sold the specimens for Wallace. However, on his return to the UK, Wallace made a series of bad investments in railways and mines that squandered most of the money, and he found himself <b>badly</b> <b>in</b> need of the proceeds from the publication of The Malay Archipelago.|$|E

5|$|In {{the more}} popular {{versions}} of the tale, only one pea is used. However, Charles Boner added in two more peas in his translation of the story upon which Andersen based his tale. Other differences amongst versions {{can be seen in}} various numbers of mattresses as well as feather beds. Versions of the story differ based on whether or not the character of the helper is included. The helper, in some cases, tells the princess to pretend as though she slept <b>badly.</b> <b>In</b> other versions, the helper does not appear at all, and the princess decides to lie all on her own.|$|E
5|$|Margot Robbie {{auditioned for}} the role of Donna in 2008. The actress {{believed}} that she had performed <b>badly</b> <b>in</b> the audition and decided to leave for a five-week snowboarding holiday in Canada. Robbie had been in Canada for two days when she received a phone call telling her that she had been successful and that she had to return to Australia. Robbie began appearing on-screen in June of that year. Donna was originally supposed to have a guest character role, but Robbie was promoted to regular cast member shortly after her debut.|$|E
5|$|The Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger {{was then}} made the Lord Warden in 1792. Pitt was <b>badly</b> <b>in</b> debt and King George III {{believed}} that the post, which came with a salary of £3,000 a year, would usefully supplement Pitt's income. Pitt made extensive use of the castle and by 1803 he used it as his main residence {{in an effort to}} reduce his living costs. Pitt's niece, Lady Hester Stanhope, joined him at Walmer between 1803 and 1806; together with Pitt, she carried out extensive work on the castle gardens, transforming them from a simple kitchen garden into a set of landscaped ornamental enclosures; Stanhope enlisted the Dover militia to help with the landscaping and planting.|$|E
