50|$|The {{earliest}} <b>boats</b> <b>were</b> 12' and 13' (“Fisherman”) {{models and}} 15' (“Vandal”) models. Wacanda <b>boats</b> <b>were</b> all built with fiberglass ribs, stringers and floors.

5|$|The <b>boat</b> <b>was</b> {{assigned}} to the 2nd Division (escadrille) of the Light Squadron of submarines on 16 January and she joined them at Calais on 11 February. Mariotte visited Brest on 20 February and was inspected by Rear Admiral Charles Eugène Favereau. During the inspection the oil-fired galley stove in the forecastle exploded, lightly burning two sailors. The <b>boat</b> <b>was</b> in Calais for the visit of King Christian X of Denmark later in the year.|$|E
5|$|The botik (small <b>boat)</b> <b>was</b> constructed, {{either in}} England or by Danes in Russia using an English design, in the 1640s, and {{was then called}} the St. Nicholas. The boat {{originally}} belonged to Peter the Great's grandfather; an earlier theory held that the <b>boat</b> <b>was</b> a gift from Queen Elizabeth to Ivan the Terrible in the 1580s. It is the last remnant of the fleet of wooden boats maintained by Peter's father, Alexis; the rest rotted from neglect or were destroyed during the rebellion of Stenka Razin.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} two other Stämpfli fours, most other <b>boats</b> <b>are</b> Janousek. The {{majority}} of <b>boats</b> <b>are</b> built for scull and sweep rigging for versatility, also necessary {{due to the}} limited boat racking space, meaning {{the total number of}} <b>boats</b> <b>is</b> limited.|$|R

5|$|After the Kingdom of Italy {{surrendered}} to the Allies on 3 September 1943, the unfinished CB-20 was captured by German forces and completed by March 1944. The <b>boat</b> <b>was</b> then {{handed over to the}} Italian Social Republic where it saw service with the Tenth Flotilla performing reconnaissance and landing saboteurs. At some point between September and October 1944, CB-20 was relocated to its new home port in Pula, where it was captured by the Partisans on 3 May 1945. Renamed Mališan (P-901), translating as nipper in English, the <b>boat</b> <b>was</b> overhauled at the Uljanik Shipyard and commissioned in 1948. The Yugoslav Navy used it for training new submariners as well as evaluating the concept of midget submarines for future use, which eventually materialized {{in the form of the}} Una-class midget submarines three decades later. Depending on the source, the exact time Mališan was decommissioned differs from the early 1950s to 1957.|$|E
5|$|As {{the party}} recuperated, Shackleton {{realised}} that the <b>boat</b> <b>was</b> {{not capable of}} making a further voyage to reach the whaling stations, and that Vincent and McNish were unfit to travel further. He decided to move the boat to a safer location within King Haakon Bay, from which point he, Worsley and Crean would cross the island on foot, aiming for the station at Stromness.|$|E
5|$|Before leaving, Shackleton {{instructed}} Frank Wild {{that he was}} {{to assume}} full command as soon as the James Caird departed, and that should the journey fail, he was to attempt to take the party to Deception Island the following spring. The James Caird was launched from Elephant Island on 24 April 1916. The wind was a moderate south-westerly, which aided a swift getaway, and the <b>boat</b> <b>was</b> quickly {{out of sight of the}} land.|$|E

5|$|German {{submarine}} U-36 was a Type VIIA U-boat of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine {{which served}} during World War II. She {{was constructed in}} {{the earliest days of}} the U-boat arm at Kiel in 1936, and served in the pre-war Navy in the Baltic Sea and North Sea under Kapitänleutnant (Kptlt.) Klaus Ewerth. Korvettenkapitän (K.Kapt.)Wilhelm Fröhlich took command in October 1938 and continued in the role until the <b>boat</b> <b>was</b> lost.|$|E
5|$|In 1858, Louis Faidherbe, the {{governor}} of Senegal, inaugurated the Bouteville boat that was capable of transporting 150 passengers, animals {{and all kinds of}} goods. The boat made ten crosses every day and the fares differed: five centimes for a person, 50 centimes for a horse, cow or camel, and two francs for a carriage. In less than a year it was obvious that this system was overrun and a second <b>boat</b> <b>was</b> introduced but with no success.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, {{the first}} {{practical}} solar <b>boat</b> <b>was</b> constructed in England. By 1995, passenger boats incorporating PV panels began appearing {{and are now}} used extensively. In 1996, Kenichi Horie made the first solar-powered crossing of the Pacific Ocean, and the Sun21 catamaran made the first solar-powered crossing of the Atlantic Ocean {{in the winter of}} 2006–2007. There were plans to circumnavigate the globe in 2010.|$|E

50|$|Larger <b>boats,</b> called moyaibune, <b>are</b> {{created and}} sent out by neighborhoods, local councils or organizations.

5|$|In {{sea trials}} of the replica Philadelphia II, the Lake Champlain Maritime Museum {{determined}} that the <b>boat</b> <b>was</b> not particularly maneuverable: contemporary accounts of sailing the vessels include reports that the gondolas skipped across {{the waters of the}} lake, blown by the wind, and needed safe shelter when winds were high.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, Malaysian Marine Police boats {{entered the}} waters around Pedra Branca on several occasions. However, both Malaysia and Singapore acted with restraint, the Singapore Navy having been given strict {{instructions}} not to escalate matters. In 1989, the then Prime Minister of Malaysia Mahathir Mohamad made an unannounced {{visit to the}} vicinity of the island. His <b>boat</b> <b>was</b> intercepted by Singapore naval vessels. To avoid an international incident, he directed his boat to leave.|$|E
5|$|King was {{sponsored}} by the Daily Express and Sunday Express newspapers. One of the shortcomings of the <b>boat</b> <b>was</b> that it had neither guard rails or shrouds to hold on to. King solved this problem with a steel wire that stretched from bow to stern, to which he clipped a harness. His method was then copied by fellow racers Loïck Fougeron and Bernard Moitessier.|$|E
