40|$|Five bisbenzyl {{isoquinoline}}s (1 - 5), three <b>benzyl</b> <b>isoquinolines</b> (6 - 8), four isoquinoline alkaloids (9 - 12), and two unclassified compounds (13 and 14) from Popowia perakensis and Phaeanthus crassipetalus {{were evaluated}} for their vasorelaxant effect on rat aortic arteries. In aortic rings pre-contracted with phenylephrine (PE, 0. 3 μM), {{some of the}} bisbenzyl isoquinoline alkaloids, benzyl isoquinoline alkaloids, and isoquinoline alkaloids showed clearly vasorelaxant effects at 30 μM. The action of (-) -limacine (4) was deduced to be mediated through the increased release of NO from endothelial cells, and that of pecrassipine A (7) and backebergine (12) partly mediated by NO release. Further, the action of pecrassipine A (7) and backebergine (12) {{may be attributed to}} their inhibition of the voltage-dependent Ca(2 +) channel and receptor-operated Ca(2 +) channel...|$|E
40|$|Higher plants {{produce a}} {{diverse array of}} {{secondary}} metabolites. These chemicals are synthesized from simple precursors through multistep reactions. To understand how plant cells developed such a complicated metabolism, we examined the plasticity of <b>benzyl</b> <b>isoquinoline</b> alkaloid biosynthesis in transgenic Eschscholzia californica cells with the ectopic expression of Coptis japonica scoulerine- 9 - O-methyltransferase (Cj SMT). Cj SMT catalyzes the O-methylation of scoulerine to produce tetrahydro-columbamine (THC) in berberine biosynthesis and {{is not involved in}} benzophenanthridine alkaloid biosynthesis in E. californica. While a preliminary characterization con-fi rmed that columbamine (oxidized product of THC) was produced in transgenic E. californica cells, many newly found peaks were not identifi ed. Here, we report the identifi cation of novel products, including allocryptopine and 10 -hydroxychelerythrine. This result indicates that Cj SMT reaction products were further converted by endoge-nous enzymes to produce double O-methylated compounds instead of a methylenedioxy ring at the 7, 8 -position of the original benzophenanthridine alkaloids. Further metabolite profi ling revealed the enhanced diversifi cation of the alkaloid profi le in transgenic cells. Metabolic plasticity and the enzymes involved in metabolic diversity are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{application}} of chiral sulfoxides and sulfoxmines to the asymetric synthesis of chiral alcohols, amines and isoquinoline alkaloids, the results are presented in five chapters. In chapter 1 {{the addition of the}} anions of methyl phenyl and methyl p-tolysulfoxide to imines was shown to be highly diastcrcoselctive process under kinetically controlled conditions. This method was extended to the asymmetric synthesis of R(+) tetrahydropalmatine. Chapter 2 is an extension of this method to methyl phenylsulfoximines. The relative stereochemistry of major adduct between lithiated t-butyldiphenylsilyl sulfoximine and benzylideneaniline was determined by x-ray crystalography. In chapter 3 an attempt was made to extend this methodology to the synthesis of <b>benzyl</b> <b>isoquinoline</b> alkaloids. However, both the yields and diastereoselctivity were poor. Chapter 4 deals with an attempt to solve the problems encountered with benzylmethylsulfoxide (in chapter 3). However the addition of the dianions of (Rs) -lO-methyl and (Rs) - 10 -Benzyl-sulphinylbornan- 2 -Exo-ol to imines gave low yields and poor diastereoselectivity. Attempts to silysate these sulfoxides gave a number of novel Pummerer rearrnagements products. Chapter 5 deals with the successful application of benzyl methyl and benzylphenylsulfoximines to the synthesis of chiral amines, alcolhols and 1 -benzyl isoquinoline derviatives. The stereochemistry at these adducts was determined by x-ray crystalography...|$|R
