50|$|<b>Butoconazole</b> (trade names Gynazole-1, Mycelex-3) is an {{imidazole}} antifungal used in gynecology. It {{is administered}} as a vaginal cream.|$|E
50|$|Intravaginal agents: <b>butoconazole,</b> clotrimazole, miconazole, nystatin, tioconazole, terconazole. Candidal {{vulvovaginitis}} {{in pregnancy}} {{should be treated}} with intravaginal clotrimazole or nystatin for at least 7 days. All {{are more or less}} equally effective.|$|E
50|$|Reaction of {{epichlorohydrin}} with 4-chlorophenylbenzylmganeium chloride {{leads to}} 1-chloro-4-(4-chlorophenyl)butan-2-ol (3). Displacement with sodium imidazole, {{conversion of the}} secondary alcohol to the chloride (SOCl2), and displacement with 2,6-dichlorobenzenethiol concludes the synthesis of the antifungal <b>butoconazole.</b>|$|E
50|$|Organisms {{responsible}} for vulvitis in children include pinworms (Enterobius vermicularis), Candida yeast, and group A hemolytic Streptococcus. Though pinworms mainly affect the perianal area, {{they can cause}} itching and irritation to the vulva as well. Pinworms are treated with albendazole. Vulvar Candida infections are uncommon in children, and generally occur in infants after antibiotic therapy, and in children with diabetes or immunodeficiency. Candida infections cause a red raised vulvar rash with satellite lesions and clear borders, and are diagnosed by microscopically examining a sample treated with potassium hydroxide for hyphae. They are treated with topical <b>butoconazole,</b> clotrimazole, or miconazole. Streptococcus infections are characterized by a dark red discoloration of the vulva and introitus, and cause pain, itching, bleeding, and dysuria. They are treated with antibiotics.|$|E
40|$|In a multicenter, randomized, invesgtigator-blind, {{parallel}} study, 398 {{patients were}} dispensed topical <b>butoconazole</b> nitrate 2 % cream for 3 days (n = 199) or miconazole nitrate 2 % cream for 7 days (n = 199) for vaginal use. Efficacy analyses included 254 patients with culture-confirmed Candida (119 <b>butoconazole</b> and 135 miconazole users). Of the 398 patients issued study medication, 9 were lost to follow-up. Therefore, safety analyses included 389 patients (197 <b>butoconazole</b> and 192 miconazole users). Evaluations upon admission and approximately 8 and 30 days post-treatment included Candida cultures, potassium hydroxide (KOH) wet mounts, and vulvovaginal examinations, with rating of vulvovaginal {{signs and symptoms}} using a 4 -point scale. Rates of clinical cure (based on sign/symptom scores), microbiologic cure (based on cultures and wet mounts), and therapeutic cure (both clinical and microbiologic cures) were assessed and were to be similar between the regimens. Therapeutic cure rates were 57. 8 % and 61. 4 % for <b>butoconazole</b> and miconazole, respectively. Three-day <b>butoconazole</b> treatment was as safe and effective as 7 -day miconazole therapy in treating vulvovaginal candidiasis...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: It is {{estimated}} {{that as many as}} 13 million cases of vulvovaginal infection occur in the United States annually, the majority of which are the result of Candida albicans infection. The symptoms of vulvovaginal infections are often painful and distressing to the patient. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare the time to symptomatic relief of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) with <b>butoconazole</b> nitrate 2 % Site Release vaginal cream (Gynazole- 1) and oral fluconazole 150 mg tablets (Diflucan). METHODS: This randomized, open-label, parallel study evaluated 181 female patients with moderate to severe symptoms of VVC. Patients were randomized to single-dose therapy with either <b>butoconazole</b> nitrate 2 % Site Release vaginal cream or fluconazole. The primary outcome measure was the time to onset of first relief of symptoms. Secondary measures included the time to overall relief of symptoms and the reinfection rate over the first 30 days following treatment. The overall safety of both products was investigated through the collection of adverse event reports. RESULTS: The median time to first relief of symptoms occurred at 17. 5 h for <b>butoconazole</b> patients as compared to 22. 9 h for fluconazole patients (p < 0. 001). The time at which 75 % of patients experienced first relief of symptoms was 24. 5 h versus 46. 3 h for <b>butoconazole</b> and fluconazole, respectively (p < 0. 001). By 12 - and 24 -h post-treatment, 44. 4 % and 72. 8 % of patients in the <b>butoconazole</b> treatment group reported first relief of symptoms versus 29. 1 % and 55. 7 % of patients in the fluconazole group (p = 0. 044 and p = 0. 024 respectively). In patients experiencing first relief of symptoms within 48 h of dosing, the median time to first relief of symptoms in the <b>butoconazole</b> treatment group was significantly shorter at 12. 9 h compared to 20. 7 h for the fluconazole treatment group (p = 0. 048). There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to time to total relief of symptoms or reoccurrence of infection within 30 days of treatment. <b>Butoconazole</b> therapy was shown to have fewer reported adverse events, including drug-related adverse events, than fluconazole therapy. Vulvovaginal pruritis and vulvovaginal burning were the most common drug-related adverse events attributed to <b>butoconazole.</b> Headache, diarrhea, nausea, upset stomach and skin sensitivity were the most common drug-related adverse events attributable to fluconazole. CONCLUSIONS: Single-dose <b>butoconazole</b> nitrate 2 % Site Release vaginal cream provides statistically significant improvement in time to first relief of symptoms in the treatment of VVC compared to fluconazole. There is no difference between these two treatments with respect to total relief of symptoms or reinfection rate. Although there was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse events judged by the investigator to be treatment-related, <b>butoconazole</b> treatment did result in fewer patients experiencing adverse events than fluconazole...|$|E
40|$|<b>Butoconazole</b> is an {{imidazole}} antifungal that is {{more effective}} than miconazole and clotrimazole for treatment of vaginal candidiasis. A highly sensitive tandem mass spectrometric assay was developed and validated to evaluate systemic absorption of <b>Butoconazole</b> following intravaginal administration. Chromatographic separation was achieved using Waters Xterra C 18 column (3 Â Âµm, 3. 0 Â ÃÂ  50. 0 Â mm). Liquid-liquid extraction using tert-butyl methyl ether was used for preparation of plasma samples. The mobile phase was solvent A: 0. 1 % formic acid in water and solvent B: acetonitrile: methanol (30 : 70, v/v), using gradient elution mode at 0. 5 Â mL/min. Detection at positive electrospray ionization in the MRM mode was then employed. Analysis was carried out within 5. 5 Â min over a linear concentration range of 0. 10 â 30. 00 Â ng/mL. Validation was carried out according to US FDA guidelines for bioanalytical method validation. Matrix effect, recovery efficiency and process efficiency have been investigated for the analyte and internal standard in neat solvent, post-extraction matrix and plasma. The mean percentage recoveries were higher than 80 %, the accuracy was 93. 51 â 106. 85 % and the RSD was below 10 % throughout the studied concentration range. Results indicated sufficient stability of the target analyte in plasma at the employed experimental conditions. Results of incurred sample re-analysis and incurred sample stability revealed less than 5 % variability. The applicability of the assay for monitoring of the systemic absorption of <b>Butoconazole</b> following intra vaginal application to healthy volunteers was demonstrated. Results confirmed that <b>Butoconazole</b> was detected shortly after intra vaginal administration with Cmax and tmax of 30 Â ng/mL and 6 Â h, respectively.

40|$|Fungal {{infections are}} a major burden {{to the health and}} welfare of modern humans. They range from simply cosmetic, non-life-threatening skin infections to severe, {{systemic}} infections that may lead to significant debilitation or death. The selection of chemotherapeutic agents useful for the treatment of fungal infections is small. In this overview, a major chemical group with antifungal activity, the azole derivatives, is examined. Included are historical and state of the art information on the in vitro activity, experimental in vivo activity, mode of action, pharmacokinetics, clinical studies, and uses and adverse reactions of imidazoles currently marketed (clotrimazole, miconazole, econazole, ketoconazole, bifonazole, <b>butoconazole,</b> croconazole, fenticonazole, isoconazole, oxiconazole, sulconazole, and tioconazole) and under development (aliconazole and omoconazole), as well as triazoles currently marketed (terconazole) and under development (fluconazole, itraconazole, vibunazole, alteconazole, and ICI 195, 739) ...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Candida parapsilosis is an {{infrequent}} isolate on vaginal cultures; {{its role}} as a vaginal pathogen remains unstudied. This retrospective study of women with positive culture for C. parapsilosis sought to characterize the significance of this finding and its response to antifungal therapy. Methods: From February 2001 to August 2002, we identified all individuals with positive fungal isolates among a population of women with chronic vulvovaginal symptoms. Charts of women with C. parapsilosis cultures were reviewed with regard to patient demographics, clinical presentation and therapeutic response. Mycological cure, defined as a negative fungal culture at the next office visit, and clinical cure, i. e. symptom resolution, were determined for each subject. Results: A total of 582 women had positive vaginal cultures for 635 isolates, of which 54 (8. 5 %) were C. parapsilosis. The charts of 51 subjects with C. parapsilosis were available for review and follow-up cultures and clinical information were available for 39 (76. 5 %). Microscopy was positive in 9 (17. 6 %). Antifungal treatment resulted in mycological cure in 17 / 19 patients with fluconazole, 7 / 7 with <b>butoconazole,</b> 6 / 6 with boric acid, 1 / 1 with miconazole and occurred spontaneously in 6 / 7 : 24 / 37 (64. 9 %) patients with a mycological cure experienced clinical cure. Conclusions: Although C. parapsilosis is often a cause of vaginal symptoms, it seems to respond to a variety of antifungal agents and may even be a transient vaginal colonizer...|$|E
