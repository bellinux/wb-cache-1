It has a minimal instrumentation which incorporates [...] "a mesh of fizzing synthesizers". It was released {{as a single}} on 16 October 2013, and was later featured on the singer's debut extended play, Truth Serum (2014). According to the artist, the songs on the EP talk about her [...] "most intense" [...] failed relationship. In an interview with Coup de Main Magazine, she said that [...] "'Out Of Mind' for me {{is kind of the}} step after 'Habits'... Picked up the pieces again and now just trying to glue them back together, you know? But it never really works". She further explained, [...] "That comes after I have the pain and I'm trying to get over this heartbreak. It's when you moved on and you're sort of okay, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> that little scar. It will always be there.

500|$|In an interview, Lo {{summarised}} the storyline of the EP; [...] "The song 'Love Ballad' {{is about}} the moment you decide to give everything to another person, while 'Habits' shows what happens when everything is screwed up and {{you just want to}} freak out. 'Out of Mind' deals with the stage after that, when your broken heart has mended, but the scars are still there". The EP's main genres are pop, electropop and indie pop. The Swedish edition of Truth Serum opens with [...] "Love Ballad", a pop song with drum instrumentation. It was described as a [...] "parody of love songs" [...] that talks about the [...] "carefree beginnings of a new romance". Lo also called it a [...] "way of telling the one I love I'd do anything for him". In the standard edition, the EP opens with [...] "Not on Drugs", a pop, dance and electropop song in which the artist compares falling in love to being under the influence of drugs. Following the narrative of Truth Serum, it represents the happy beginning of the relationship, when Lo was [...] "really in love" [...] and [...] " [...] think straight". [...] "Paradise" [...] is a jungle and drum and bass song with electronic elements; it talks about the moment when Lo realizes that she needs and relies on her partner. The electropop song [...] "Over" [...] details the part when Lo and her boyfriend end the relationship. The singer stated that it was about [...] "me making a big mistake and having to confess and come clean". [...] "Habits (Stay High)" [...] is a pop and electropop track which talks about the artist's hedonistic attempts to forget her former boyfriend. [...] "Out of Mind" [...] is a pop song with minimal instrumentation. According to Lo, it represents the part when [...] "I have the pain and I'm trying to get over this heartbreak. It's when you moved on and you're sort of okay, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> that little scar". The EP's last track is the downtempo [...] "Stay High", a remix version of [...] "Habits (Stay High)" [...] by record production duo Hippie Sabotage.|$|E

Until recently it was Tapu (taboo) for any male that has passed puberty to be in the same room with his sister or girl cousins alone. This was done under the notion of respect or faka'apa'apa. The recent introduction of western ideas and culture has slowly made this taboo vary widely amongst Tongan families.
