40|$|Recently Propp and Wilson [14] have {{proposed}} an algorithm, called Coupling from the Past (CFTP), which allows {{not only an}} approximate but perfect (i. e. exact) simulation of the stationary distribution of certain finite state space Markov chains. Perfect Sampling using CFTP has been successfully extended to the context of point processes, amongst other authors, by Haggstrom et al. [5]. In [5] Gibbs sampling is applied to a bivariate point process, the penetrable spheres mixture model [19]. However, in general the running time of CFTP in terms of number of transitions is not independent of the state sampled. Thus an impatient user who aborts long runs may introduce a subtle bias, the user impatience <b>bias.</b> <b>Fill</b> [3] introduced an exact sampling algorithm for finite state space Markov chains which, in contrast to CFTP, is unbiased for user impatience.

40|$|Background and objectives: Several information-processing models {{highlight}} the independent roles of controlled and automatic processes in explaining fearful behavior. Therefore, we investigated whether direct measures of controlled processes and indirect measures of automatic processes predict unique variance components of children's spider fear-related behavior. Method: Seventy-seven children between 8 and 13 years performed an Affective Priming Task (APT) measuring associative bias, a pictorial {{version of the}} Emotional Stroop Task (EST) measuring attentional <b>bias,</b> <b>filled</b> out the Spider Anxiety and Disgust Screening for Children (SADS-C) {{in order to assess}} self-perceived fear, and took part in a Behavioral Assessment Test (BAT) to measure avoidance of spiders. Results: The SADS-C, EST, and APT did not correlate with each other. Spider fear-related behavior was best explained by SADS-C, APT, and EST together; they explained 51 % of the variance in BAT behavior. Limitations: No children with clinical levels of spider phobia were tested. The direct and the different indirect measures did no correlate with each other. Conclusions: These results indicate that both direct and indirect measures are useful for predicting unique variance components of fear-related behavior in children. The lack of relations between direct and indirect measures may explain why some earlier studies did not find stronger color-naming interference or stronger fear associations in children with high levels of self-reported fear. It also suggests that children with high levels of spider-fearful behavior have different fear-related associations and display higher interference by spider stimuli than children with non-fearful behavior...|$|R

C-V profiles detect changes consisting in apparent doping and/or charge concentration increase within the quantum wells. This increase is correlated to dramatic modifications in the DLTS spectrum when the reverse <b>bias</b> and <b>filling</b> pulse are properly adjusted {{in order to}} probe the quantum well region. The new distribution of the electronic levels detected by DLTS could explain the observed decrease in the light emission efficiency of the device, as the deep levels generated during the stress may provide alternative recombination paths for free carriers. The photocurrent spectra do not change in shape during stress, although their amplitude slightly decreases. This is related to a decrease of the device yield, in this photodetector configuration, with increasing aging time. Thus, we can suggest that {{the introduction of new}} defect levels in the bulk material lowers the free carrier mobility...|$|R

40|$|Tended to view {{disability}} inclusion {{as merely}} another mandate, {{building and construction}} practitioners have yet to recognize its value in social sustainability. In academia, similarly, it has received less attention than other building performance attributes such as environmental friendliness and indoor air quality. With rights to access now acknowledged as basic human rights, there is demand for a tool to assess building disability inclusiveness, indicating {{the extent to which}} building considerations include persons with disabilities (PWDs). This paper proposes a Building Inclusiveness Assessment Score (<b>BIAS)</b> to <b>fill</b> the existing gap. The BIAS framework comprises two hierarchies of inclusion attributes identified from literature, guides, and standards of barrier-free access and universal design. The final product consists of two building disability inclusiveness assessment tools: the Physical Disability Inclusion Sub-score (PDIS) and the Visual Impairment Inclusion Sub-score (VIIS). These are simple, quantitative, objective tools for assessing buildings. We performed a Monte Carlo simulation to validate the assessment protocols.

40|$|AbstractMultiple {{sclerosis}} lesions {{influence the}} process of image analysis, leading to tissue segmentation problems and biased morphometric estimates. Existing techniques try to reduce this <b>bias</b> by <b>filling</b> all lesions as normal-appearing white matter on T 1 -weighted images, considering each time-point separately. However, due to lesion segmentation errors {{and the presence of}} structures adjacent to the lesions, such as the ventricles and deep grey matter nuclei, filling all lesions with white matter-like intensities introduces errors and artefacts. In this paper, we present a novel lesion filling strategy inspired by in-painting techniques used in computer graphics applications for image completion. The proposed technique uses a five-dimensional (5 D), patch-based (multi-modality and multi-time-point), Non-Local Means algorithm that fills lesions with the most plausible texture. We demonstrate that this strategy introduces less bias, fewer artefacts and spurious edges than the current, publicly available techniques. The proposed method is modality-agnostic and can be applied to multiple time-points simultaneously. In addition, it preserves anatomical structures and signal-to-noise characteristics even when the lesions are neighbouring grey matter or cerebrospinal fluid, and avoids excess of blurring or rasterisation due to the choice of the segmentation plane, shape of the lesions, and their size and/or location...|$|R

40|$|A quantum wire-on-well (WoW) structure, taking {{advantage}} of the layer undulation of an In- GaAs/GaAs/GaAsP superlattice grown on a vicinal substrate, was demonstrated to enhance the carrier collection from the confinement levels and extend the carrier lifetime (220 ns) by approximately 4 times as compared with a planar reference superlattice. Strained InGaAs/GaAs/GaAsP superlattices were grown on GaAs substrates under exactly the same condition except for the substrate misorientation (0 o- and 6 o- off). The growth on a 6 o-off substrate induced significant layer undulation as a result of step bunching and non-uniform precursor incorporation between steps and terraces whereas the growth on a substrate without miscut resulted in planar layers. The undulation was the most significant for InGaAs layers, forming periodically aligned InGaAs nanowires on planar wells, a wire-on-well structure. As for the photocurrent corresponding to the sub-bandgap range of GaAs, the light absorption by the WoW was extended to longer wavelengths and weakened as compared with the planar superlattice, and almost the same photocurrent was obtained for both the WoW and the planar superlattice. Open-circuit voltage for the WoW was not affected by the longer-wavelength absorption edge and the same value was obtained for the two structures.

40|$|Women {{who start}} college {{in one of}} the natural or {{physical}} sciences leave in greater proportions than their male peers. The reasons for this difference are complex, and one possible contributing factor is the social environment women experience in the classroom. Using social network analysis, we explore how gender influences the confidence that college-level biology students have in each other's mastery of biology. Results reveal that males are more likely than females to be named by peers as being knowledgeable about the course content. This effect increases as the term progresses, and persists even after controlling for class performance and outspokenness. The bias in nominations is specifically due to males over-nominating their male peers relative to their performance. The over-nomination of male peers is commensurate with an overestimation of male grades by 0. 57 points on a 4 point grade scale, indicating a strong male bias among males when assessing their classmates. Females, in contrast, nominated equitably based on student performance rather than gender, suggesting they lacked gender <b>biases</b> in <b>filling</b> out these surveys. These trends persist across eleven surveys taken in three different iterations of the same Biology course. In every class, the most renowned students are always male.

40|$|Estimates of scour {{and fill}} in rivers that are derived by {{differencing}} topographic surfaces {{are known to}} be negatively biased by local compensation of scour and fill between surveys but the magnitude of bias is not well known. This study examines the effect of survey frequency on volumes of scour and fill over a period of active channel braiding in a small-scale river model. A 100 min, high temporal resolution time series of digital elevation models is artificially coarsened by selectively removing models. The resulting four overlapping time series have survey intervals of 10 min, 20 min, 50 min and 100 min. Cumulative scour and fill volumes for the 100 min period are compared between the four series. It is concluded that the decay in measured volumes of scour and fill with increased survey interval can be described using inverse functions. Cumulative scour-fill volumes are approximately 420 per cent greater over the study period for 10 min survey intervals than for a 100 min interval. After the 100 min period of competent flow, nearly 65 per cent of the channel area experienced significant compensation of scour and fill. Several compensation mechanisms were identified in association with braided channel kinetics, including lateral channel migration, the migration of bed forms, and channel avulsion. It is demonstrated that by negatively <b>biasing</b> scour, <b>fill</b> and net estimates, this error significantly affects morphological approaches to the estimation of bed load sediment transport.

The sample structures and Indium doping levels were shown to have great influences on the {{properties of the}} devices. Multiple {{rise and fall of the}} PL signals were observed under the decrease of the forward bias and increase of the reverse bias in the blue, green, and dual-wavelength LED samples. We suggest that the rise and fall of the PL spectrum are due to the increased electron and hole wavefunciton overlap and charge carrier escape, respectively, and that the multiple intensity peaks possibly originate from different Quantum Wells (QWs) in the sample with different in-well fields depending on their positions. Our results indicated that the QWs in our samples make non-equivalent contributions to the PL emission. In addition, the emergence of a new higher energy spectral peak was found to considerably enhance the PL emission under reverse bias. We interpret the new peak as the emission from the excited state transition in the QW. On the other hand, the EL of blue LED showed a red-blue energy shift with the increase of the injection current. While the red shift was due to the enhancement of Quantum Confined Stark Effect (QCSE) by the forward <b>bias,</b> band <b>filling</b> effect was shown to play a dominate role for the blue shift...|$|R
40|$|According to the {{instructional}} failure hypothesis, the contextual similarity of the intertrial interval (ITI) and the delay interval (DI) {{is responsible for}} the choose-short bias that occurs when memory for filled intervals is tested. This hypothesis may also explain the choose-long bias for empty intervals, if birds confuse an extended DI with a long empty interval. In the present study, pigeons were trained in a within-subjects design to discriminate durations of a filled interval (2 -s and 8 -s of light), and durations of an empty interval (2 -s and 8 -s bound by two 1 -s light markers). In order to disambiguate the ITI, sample presentation phase, and the DI, the colour displayed on the video monitor was different during the various phases of a trial. In Experiment 1, the ITI was magenta, the sample presentation phase was dark, and the DI was grey. Although accuracy was greater for short than for long samples, the retention functions were parallel. Thus, {{there was no evidence of}} a biased-forgetting effect. In Experiment 2, additional tests indicated that the interval from the offset of the ITI to the onset of the DI, as well as the filled and empty intervals themselves affected choice responding in Experiment 1. In Experiment 3, the colour displayed on the video monitor was manipulated such that the illumination was magenta during the ITI, and dark during the sample presentation and comparison phases in order to prevent pigeons timing from the ITI offset to the DI onset, and to create confusion for one interval-type, but not the other. A choose-long bias was obtained for empty intervals, and no-bias was obtained for filled intervals. In Experiment 4, the colour displayed on the video monitor was manipulated such that the illumination was dark during the ITI and sample presentation phase, and grey during the comparison phase in order to prevent pigeons from timing from ITI offset to DI onset, and to eliminate the possibility of confusion for both filled and empty intervals. The results of this experiment revealed no <b>biases</b> for either <b>filled</b> or empty intervals. In Experiment 5, the colour displayed on the video monitor was dark for all of the phases of the trial in order to create confusion, and thus produce the choose-short and long biases.

But the photovoltaic application of BFO has been hindered by low energy-conversion efficiency due to poor carrier transport and collection. In this work, a new approach of utilizing BFO as a light-absorbing sensitizer is developed to interface with charge-transporting TiO 2 nanoparticles. This mesoporous all-oxide architecture, similar to that of dye-sensitized solar cells, can effectively facilitate the extraction of photocarriers.

It is intended to prevent perception <b>bias</b> in <b>filling</b> out the questionnaire. The statistical method used is hierarchical multiple regression analysis. It is the best choice of the statistical method because {{it can be used to}} test the mediating role of attitudes in the research model.

The process starts from the way of thinking, feeling, and intention behavior. In this study, the price is a stimulus that directly influence on switching intentions, but its role is further weakened when the process is mediated by a positive attitude. Product attributes are next stimulus that can influence the switching intentions, but this role is lost when the process is mediated by a positive attitude. Acquisition is stimulus found no role in influencing the switching intention, but this role becomes stronger when mediated by a positive attitude.

Samples were produced using a conventional solid state sintering technique, and sintered at 1100 °C and 1200 °C, quenching the Bi-free samples from the sintering temperature to preserve high temperature defect distribution and slow cooling the Bi-containing samples to develop varistor behaviour.

40|$|The {{mechanics}} of airflow {{in the large}} airways during inspiration affects important physiological functions such as ventilation, olfaction, heat exchange and mass transfer. The behaviour of the airflow is important not only for healthcare applications including diagnosis, intervention planning and assessment, but for inhalation toxicology. This research aims to further the understanding of human nasal physiology through computational modelling. Specifically, the effects of transient inhalation conditions on flow dynamics and transport were characterised and the changes in flow behaviour in response to certain pathologies quantified. The key findings can be summarised as follows: Firstly, the time scales for airflow in the large airways have been identified and the initial flow patterns revealed. Three phases in the temporal behaviour of the flow were identified (flow initiation, quasi-equilibrium and decay). The duration of each phase differs depending on the quantity of interest. Flow in the nose was characterised as transitional, whilst {{in parts of the}} descending airways it is turbulent, particularly in the faster moving regions around the jets which may occur in the pharynx, larynx and at the superior end of the trachea. The bulk of the flow is <b>biased</b> to <b>fill</b> only certain regions of the airways, whilst other regions carry little flow, due to features upstream. Analysis of cross-sectional images provided by medical imaging does not necessarily provide a representative view of the area available to the flow. Various scalar species were employed to represent the fate of nanoparticles and gaseous species within the airways. Only species with high diffusion rates exhibited significant absorption at the airway walls. Airway pathologies often cause changes to the geometry of the airway. One such pathology, the goitre, was found to curve the trachea and in some cases cause constriction. Both these geometric changes were found to increase the pressure loss and energy required to drive flow through the trachea. Furthermore, the flow in pathological cases was more disturbed. High resolution simulations have been used to address these topics and the scales simulated have been analysed in terms of the smallest features possible in the flow to determine their fidelity.

Minimal invasive procedures, laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) and small-incision cholecystectomy (SIC), have replaced the classical open cholecystectomy. No differences have been found in primary outcome measures between LC and SIC, therefore secondary outcome measures have to be considered to determine preferences. The aim of our study was to examine health status applying evidence-based guidelines in LC and SIC in a randomised trial. METHODS: Patients with symptomatic cholecystolithiasis were included in a blind randomised trial. Operative procedures, anaesthesia, analgesics and postoperative care were standardised in order to limit <b>bias.</b> Questionnaires were <b>filled</b> in preoperatively, the first day postoperatively, and at outpatients follow-up at 2, 6 and 12 weeks. In accordance with evidence-based guidelines, the generic short form (SF- 36) and the disease-specific gastrointestinal quality-of-life index (GIQLI) questionnaires were used in addition to the body image questionnaire (BIQ). RESULTS: A total of 257 patients were randomised between LC (120) and SIC (137). Analyses were performed according to intention-to-treat (converted procedures included) and also distinguishing converted from minimal invasive (nonconverted) procedures. Questionnaires were obtained with a response rate varying from 87. 5 % preoperatively to 77. 4 % three months postoperatively. Except for two time-specific measurements in one SF- 36 subscale, there were no differences between LC and SIC.

5000|$|Outside of {{participant}} motivation, {{there are other}} factors that influence the appearance of demand characteristics in a study. Many of these factors relate to the unique nature of the experimental setting itself. For example, participants in studies are more likely to put up with uncomfortable or tedious tasks simply because they are in an experiment. Additionally, the mannerisms of the experimenter, such as the way they greet the participant, or the way they interact with the participant {{during the course of the}} experiment may inadvertently bias how the participant responds during the course of the experiment. Finally, prior experiences of being in an experiment, or rumors of the experiment that participants may hear can greatly bias the way they respond. Outside of an experiment, these types of past experiences and mannerisms may have significant effects on how patients rank the effectiveness of their therapist. Many of the ways therapists go about collecting client feedback involve self-report measures, which can be highly influenced by response bias. Participants may be <b>biased</b> if they <b>fill</b> out these measure in front of their therapist, or somehow feel compelled to answer in an affirmative matter because they believe their therapy should be working. In this case, the therapists would not be able to gain accurate feedback from their clients, and be unable to improve their therapy or accurately tailor further treatment to what the participants need. [...] All of these different examples may have significant effects on the responses {{of participant}}s, driving them to respond in ways that do not reflect their actual beliefs or actual mindset, which negatively impact conclusions drawn from those surveys.|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{introduction}} of market mechanisms in Dutch healthcare engages insurance companies in competition. Patient experience surveys are increasingly applied to generate performance information guiding consumers and insurers to choose and contract high performers, {{as well as}} holding them accountable. Thus, there is an increased need for standardized patient experience measurement tools for specific types of care. Here, {{we report on the}} reliability and validity of a new instrument we developed to measure patient experiences with diabetes care. Methods: We combined and adapted existing CAHPS and QUOTE-Diabetes instruments into one self-administered questionnaire (118 items) to assess (i) patients’ experiences with diabetes care provided by their general practitioner (GP), internist, nurse, or dietician and (ii) their diabetes-specific health outcomes. Survey population diabetes patients of one insurer (Agis), enrolled in the sickness fund and aged 50 or above. Sample 983 patients who claimed reimbursement for diabetes medication in the 12 months prior to November 2003 were sent a questionnaire. Results: A total of 563 patients returned the questionnaire and confirmed being diabetic (response rate 63. 5 %). 510 diabetes patients completed the questionnaire. Non-response <b>bias</b> was unlikely. <b>Filling</b> out the questionnaire did not seem a problem for the majority of respondents. Psychometric properties of the questionnaire compared well with the two underlying pre-existing questionnaires. ‘Diabetes specific communication’ was a consistent 4 -item factor in the new instrument, independent of the type of care provider. Internal consistency reliability was good (Cronbach’s alpha ranged 0. 84 – 0. 89). ‘Provider-patient interaction’ was a consistent 5 -item factor for care by GP’s, internists and nurses (Cronbach’s alpha 0. 89 – 0. 92), but not dieticians. Respondents reported case management and outcome measures similar to those in other studies. Conclusions: The newly constructed—CAHPS and QUOTE-Diabetes based—questionnaire is reliable and valid and is well received by respondents. It offers a strong basis for further development of patient experiences survey for Diabetes Care in the Dutch healthcare context. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
40|$|Global {{satellite}} {{measurements of}} solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) from chlorophyll over land and ocean have proven useful {{for a number}} of different applications related to physiology, phenology, and productivity of plants and phytoplankton. Terrestrial chlorophyll fluorescence is emitted throughout the red and far-red spectrum, producing two broad peaks near 683 and 736  nm. From ocean surfaces, phytoplankton fluorescence emissions are entirely from the red region (683  nm peak). Studies using satellite-derived SIF over land have focused almost exclusively on measurements in the far red (wavelengths [*]>[*]  712  nm), since those are the most easily obtained with existing instrumentation. Here, we examine new ways to use existing hyperspectral satellite data sets to retrieve red SIF (wavelengths [*]<[*]  712  nm) over both land and ocean. Red SIF is thought to provide complementary information to that from the far red for terrestrial vegetation. The satellite instruments that we use were designed to make atmospheric trace-gas measurements and are therefore not optimal for observing SIF; they have coarse spatial resolution and only moderate spectral resolution (0. 5  nm). Nevertheless, these instruments, the Global Ozone Monitoring Instrument  2 (GOME- 2) and the SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIAMACHY), offer a unique opportunity to compare red and far-red terrestrial SIF at regional spatial scales. Terrestrial SIF has been estimated with ground-, aircraft-, or satellite-based instruments by measuring the filling-in of atmospheric and/or solar absorption spectral features by SIF. Our approach makes use of the oxygen (O 2) γ band that is not affected by SIF. The SIF-free O 2 γ band helps to estimate absorption within the spectrally variable O 2 B band, which is filled in by red SIF. SIF also fills in the spectrally stable solar Fraunhofer lines (SFLs) at wavelengths both inside and just outside the O 2 B band, which further helps to estimate red SIF emission. Our approach is then an extension of previous approaches applied to satellite data that utilized only the filling-in of SFLs by red SIF. We conducted retrievals of red SIF using an extensive database of simulated radiances covering a wide range of conditions. Our new algorithm produces good agreement between the simulated truth and retrievals and shows the potential of the O 2 bands for noise reduction in red SIF retrievals as compared with approaches that rely solely on SFL <b>filling.</b> <b>Biases</b> seen with existing satellite data, most likely due to instrumental artifacts that vary in time, space, and with instrument, must be addressed in order to obtain reasonable results. Our 8 -year record of red SIF observations over land with the GOME- 2 allows for the first time reliable global mapping of monthly anomalies. These anomalies are shown to have similar spatiotemporal structure as those in the far red, particularly for drought-prone regions. There is a somewhat larger percentage response in the red as compared with the far red for these areas that are drought sensitive. We also demonstrate that good-quality ocean fluorescence line height retrievals can be achieved with GOME- 2, SCIAMACHY, and similar instruments by utilizing the full complement of radiance measurements that span the red SIF emission feature...|$|R
40|$|Negatively biased {{interpretation}} {{has been}} hypothesized {{as an important}} factor in the aetiology and maintenance of depression. Recently developed cognitive bias modification paradigms, intending to change these biases towards a more optimistic interpretation tendency (CBM-I), seem to offer new promising implications for cognitive therapy innovation. Surprisingly, the increasing interest in the modifiability of interpretation bias is contrasted by a severe lack of methodological and measurement development studies. A review of current research revealed 1) a severe lack of psychometrically evaluated measures for depressionrelated interpretation bias and its modification, 2) inconsistent findings for the existence of depression-related interpretation bias depending on the (direct or indirect) assessment paradigm, 3) a demand for profound knowledge about the underlying work mechanisms and best ingredients for CBM-I procedures, and 4) a lack of measures and CBM-I training materials in the German language. With these considerations in mind, the objectives of this dissertation were 1) to develop and evaluate an internally consistent and valid measure for the assessment of depression-related interpretation bias and its modification, 2) to validate an indirect priming task to assess interpretation bias and to further examine the interrelations of four different direct and indirect assessment paradigms, 3) to evaluate a new and more active CBM-I variant and test its effectiveness in comparison with guided CBM-I and a control group, and 4) to provide valid test and CBM-I training materials in German. The aim of study 1 was to develop and evaluate a pragmatic assessment instrument, consisting of a 30 -item questionnaire (long version) and two 15 -item parallel short versions (A and B). Items were generated as ambiguous sentences, reflecting three relevant content areas based on Beck’s cognitive triad (Beck et al., 1979). All three versions of the instrument were found to be structurally stable, internally consistent and valid. In line with Beck’s cognitive triad (Beck et al., 1979) in depression, confirmatory factor analyses determined a three factor solution (self, experiences, future). Significant correlations were found between all scales and depressive mood. The two short versions represent the same underlying constructs, share identical psychometric properties and possess high parallel-test reliability. The study was the first to evaluate and confirm the factorial validity as well as the parallel-test reliability, and therefore suitability to measure modification of interpretation bias measure in the context of depressed mood. The aim of study 2 was to evaluate an indirect affective priming task using homophones as ambiguous material and to compare this task to three different already established interpretation bias paradigms, namely an ambiguous scenarios test, a scrambled sentences test under cognitive load, as well as a homophone paradigm. No empirical support for mood-related interpretation bias was found for the newly developed affective priming task as well as the homophone task, which both did not differentiate between dysphoric and non-dysphoric individuals. The ambiguous scenarios test and the scrambled sentences test under cognitive load were shown to be internally consistent and valid instruments that were also highly intercorrelated. These findings emphasize the challenge to create valid ambiguous test stimuli for the measure of depression-related interpretation bias as well as the inequality of different assessment paradigms. Study 2 was the first study to examine the relatedness of four different direct and indirect assessment paradigms for the measure of depression-related interpretation bias in one sample. The aim of study 3 was to compare the efficacy of CBM-I requiring participants to imagine standardized positive resolutions to a novel, more active training version that required participants to generate the positive interpretations themselves. Participants were randomly allocated to (1) standardized CBM-I, (2) self-generation CBM-I or (3) a control group. Outcome measures included self-report mood measures and a depression-related interpretation bias measure. Both positive training variants significantly increased the tendency to interpret fresh ambiguous material in an optimistic manner. However, only the standardized imagery CBM-I paradigm positively influenced mood. Study 3 successfully evaluated a new CBM-I variant, gained insights about the role of self-generation and added further support to the potential therapeutic significance of imagery-based cognitive bias modification strategies. Altogether, this dissertation significantly contributed to the research field of depressionrelated interpretation <b>bias</b> by 1) <b>filling</b> a gap in measure development studies, 2) increasing the knowledge of the relatedness of different assessment paradigms, 3) increasing the knowledge about the working mechanisms and optimal ingredients of successful CBM-I, and 4) evaluating and providing assessment as well as CBM-I training materials for the German language context. Ein negativer Interpretationsbias bezieht sich auf die Tendenz, mehrdeutige Reize (z. B. Situationen, Gesichtsausdrücke, Rückmeldung von anderen Personen) in einer pessimistischen Art und Weise zu interpretieren. Diese kognitive Verzerrung im Rahmen der Informationsverarbeitung wird als wichtiger Faktor für die Entstehung und Aufrechterhaltung von depressiven Störungen diskutiert. Insbesondere die Modifikation dieser Tendenz zu einem positiveren Interpretationsstil (Cognitive bias modification targeting interpretation; CBM-I) erweckte in den vergangenen Jahren großes Forschungsinteresse, da diese innovativen, computergestützten Techniken wirkungsvolle Behandlungsansätze für die Therapie von Depressionen bedeuten könnten. Nach aktuellem Forschungsstand besteht jedoch 1.) ein Mangel an hinreichend evaluierten Instrumenten für die Erhebung von depressionsbedingten Interpretationsverzerrungen und insbesondere deren Veränderbarkeit, 2.) eine inkonsistente Befundlage für die Existenz von depressionsbedingten Interpretationsverzerrungen in Abhängigkeit von der (direkten oder indirekten) Erhebungsmethode, 3.) ein Bedarf an genaueren Erkenntnissen über die zugrunde liegenden Wirkmechanismen und effektivsten Komponenten von CBM-I und 4.) ein Fehlen von CBM-I Materialien und Erhebungsmethoden in deutscher Sprache. Vor diesem Hintergrund wurden die Ziele dieser Dissertation formuliert, die neben einer kurzen Einführung in das Themengebiet und einer abschließenden Diskussion aus drei Studien besteht. Das Ziel der ersten Studie war die Entwicklung und Validierung eines pragmatischen Erhebungsinstrumentes zur Messung von depressionsbedingten Interpretationsverzerrungen, bestehend aus einem Fragebogen (Langfassung, 30 Items) und zwei Kurz- bzw. Parallelversionen (A und B, jeweils 15 Items). In den Items werden emotional mehrdeutig interpretierbare Szenarien beschrieben, deren Inhalte Beck‘s kognitive Triade (Beck et al., 1979) widerspiegeln. Den Ergebnissen zufolge können alle drei Versionen des Instruments als strukturell stabil, internal konsistent und valide bewertet werden. In Übereinstimmung mit der Theorie der kognitiven Triade (Beck et al., 1979) wurde mittels konfirmatorischer Faktorenanalyse eine Dreifaktorenlösung (Selbst, Erfahrungen, Zukunft) festgestellt. Signifikante Korrelationen wurden zwischen allen Skalenwerten und depressiver Symptomatik gefunden. Die beiden Parallelversionen weisen ähnliche psychometrische Eigenschaften sowie eine hohe Paralleltest-Konsistenz auf. Das Ziel der zweiten Studie war die Validierung eines indirekten, affektiven Priming- Verfahrens, in dem homophone Wörter als emotional zweideutige Stimuli eingesetzt wurden. Dieser Test wurde zusätzlich mit drei bereits etablierten Erhebungsparadigmen (Ambiguous Scenarios Test; Scrambled Sentences Test, Homophone-Test) verglichen. Hinsichtlich der Ergebnisse konnte keine empirische Unterstützung für den affektiven Priming-Test sowie für den Homophone-Test gefunden werden; beide Tests zeigten keinen Zusammenhang mit depressiven Symptomen. Der Ambiguous Scenarios Test und der Scrambled Sentences Test erwiesen sich als internal konsistent und valide und wiesen außerdem eine hohe Interkorrelation auf. Die Ergebnisse geben Aufschluss über die Vergleichbarkeit der unterschiedlichen Erhebungsparadigmen. Das Ziel der dritten Studie war die Entwicklung und Evaluation einer neuen, aktiveren CBM-I Variante, in der die Teilnehmer mittels eines computergestützten Trainings aufgefordert wurden, positive Interpretationen auf emotional mehrdeutige Szenarien eigenständig zu generieren. Die Ergebnisse der neuen CBM-I-Variante wurden mit den Ergebnissen einer herkömmlichen CBM-I-Variante (Standard-CBM-I) sowie den Ergebnissen einer Kontrollgruppe verglichen. Es zeigte sich, dass sowohl die neue CBM-I-Variante als auch Standard-CBM-I die Interpretationstendenz signifikant in eine positive Richtung verbesserten. Darüber hinaus konnte durch Standard-CBM-I eine stimmungsaufhellende Wirkung erzielt werden...|$|R
