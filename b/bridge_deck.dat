5|$|The bridge {{underwent}} a renovation in 1990 which included replacement of its <b>bridge</b> <b>deck.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1873, in {{an effort}} to improve {{navigation}} around the bridge and reduce accidents, two of the piers were removed, making the widest span a more easily navigated , and the <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> was strengthened with iron girders to compensate for the missing piers.|$|E
5|$|In August 1922, Tosa {{was moved}} to Kure, still incomplete. Fifty {{thousand}} people turned out to watch as the battleship was towed out of the harbor by five tugboats. The barbettes for the 406mm (16inch) guns were in place, but no turrets or weapons had been mounted, so {{the holes in the}} main deck were covered with a mesh-like material. Her hull was finished, and a superstructure deck, <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> and conning tower had been fitted, along with a light signal mast directly aft of the second barbette. The conning tower had to be outfitted as a bridge, as there was no other suitable location; compared with those of similar ships, it was much smaller, as it only contained two levels and bridge wings. An exhaust pipe resembling an extremely small funnel was fitted so that heat could be supplied within the ship.|$|E
30|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to investigate the seasonal variations in the relative permittivity of actual concrete <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> of various ages on Korea expressways, and to propose a practical way to calibrate two critical effects, to assess the condition of the concrete <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> with better accuracy. For these purposes, fifty-three actual concrete <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> on Korea expressways were scanned using an air-coupled ground penetrating radar (GPR) system, and the relative permittivity of the concrete was evaluated from the GPR data in the field. A statistical analysis showed that the relative permittivity of the concrete <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> in Korea are closely correlated with seasonal changes and concrete ages. For concrete <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> aged 10  years or older, the effect of concrete age was not as significant as that of relative humidity of the air on relative permittivity of concrete. Based on the results, a simple calibration process was proposed to suppress the effects of seasonal variation and age of concrete on the measured relative permittivity of the concrete <b>decks</b> on actual <b>bridges.</b> As will be discussed, the resulting relative permittivity method produced better agreement with the current condition of the concrete <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> as determined by visual inspection and other complementary methods (energy attenuation of GPR signals and corrosion potential measurements) than without the calibration process.|$|R
40|$|Research {{funds were}} {{approved}} {{for the purchase}} of equipment designed to proportion and inject epoxy resins into delaminated areas of <b>bridge</b> <b>decks.</b> Through investigation and refining of this process, it was anticipated that a maintenance procedure would be developed to delay spalling of <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> by "gluing down" delaminated areas before spalling occurred...|$|R
30|$|Transverse {{cracking}} {{on these}} decks {{may also be}} related to structural-related stresses, such as restrained shrinkage effects due to connections on steel girders, negative bending moments over steel supports or other structural-related stresses. These cracks could have also occurred due to loads applied too soon after the deck was constructed, or other reasons. These two bridges are also two of the oldest bridges included in the study, and traffic loads could {{also play a role}} in the development of transverse cracks. <b>Bridge</b> <b>decks</b> with stay-in-place metal forms (<b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> 8 N/ 8 L and 9 N/ 9 L) also tended to exhibit more longitudinal and transverse cracking than <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> on precast concrete girders and non-continuous steel girders. Stay-in-place metal forms are not typically considered to be bonded to the concrete deck, although some restraint due to partial bonding and friction can be expected. It is interesting to note that although all four of these bridges have stay-in-place forms, they are supported by different types of girders, with bridges 8 L and 9 L on widened steel I-beams, while bridges 8 N and 9 N have stay-in-place forms on prestressed concrete girders. Some of the cracking observed on the <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> 8 N, 8 L, 9 N, and 9 L may also be attributable to the superstructure design, rather than from concrete materials-related causes. Other <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> exhibiting transverse cracks (albeit to a lesser extent than in <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> 6 N, 6 L, 7 N, 7 L, 8 N, 8 L, 9 N, and 9 L), include <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> 1 L, 3 N, and 5 N.|$|R
5|$|In August 2008, Skanska {{was awarded}} the $150-million design–build {{contract}} to build the new bridge. Skanska started driving test pilings into {{the ground in the}} later part of 2008. In May 2009, public voting for the aesthetic design features of the bridge decided that the cables would be blue, the pylon tops would be slanted with railings, and the lighting fixtures for the walkway would have a nautical theme. The test pilings for the bridge were completed in June 2009. Construction of the pylons began in July 2009 with the pouring of concrete into the first pylon. By December 2009, construction had begun on the approach foundations and the edge girders, with work continuing on the pylon towers and the side abutments. The completion of the design phase of the project {{and the beginning of the}} concrete pour for the <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> took place in April 2010. In May 2010, the bridge received $1.79 million in federal funding for the pedestrian and bike paths. By this time, the new Indian River Inlet Bridge was about halfway complete.|$|E
5|$|Before 1897, {{there had}} been a ferry at Grovehill, and a {{shipyard}} on the east bank, owned by Joseph Scarr. To assist his workers to reach the shipyard, Scarr designed and built a ferry bridge, which cost him £300. It consisted of a large rectangular pontoon, above which was fitted a <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> with handrails. Two jack screws enabled the deck to be raised or lowered in relation to the pontoon, so that it remained at approximately the same height, whatever the state of the tide. On the eastern bank, Scarr constructed a variable-height landing, but the landing on the west bank was constructed by Beverley Council, and was fixed. Scarr campaigned to have a variable landing here as well, and was prepared to fund it, but his requests were always rejected. The fixed landing made access to the bridge difficult at high tides. When a boat needed to pass, the west end was freed, and the pontoon swung round to lie parallel to the bank, either upstream or downstream, depending {{on the state of the}} tide. It would then be winched back into position by a small barrel winch. At night the bridge was closed and moored beside the bank.|$|E
25|$|During {{the summer}} of 1994 the <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> {{launching}} gantry fell onto the Gwent viaduct, causing the 200tonne <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> unit to fall onto the deck below. Although this delayed the project by ten weeks, the builders still completed the bridge on schedule two years later.|$|E
30|$|Pattern {{cracking}} {{was observed}} {{on a number}} of <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> included in the study. As shown in Table  3, the most severe pattern cracking (judged to be moderate severity) was observed in <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> 6 N and 6 L. As mentioned previously, these <b>bridge</b> <b>decks,</b> located on an interstate in the Piedmont region, had the highest traffic loading (ADT of 68, 000 and 64, 000 respectively). This pattern cracking could have initiated due to materials related issues, but were likely exacerbated due to traffic loads. An analysis of the relationship between ADT on observed cracking is presented subsequently in this paper.|$|R
40|$|For {{concrete}} <b>bridge</b> <b>decks,</b> {{the use of}} salt in {{cold weather}} areas is known to result in damage, such as freeze or thaw damage (microcracks) and surface breaking cracks. In this paper attention is directed to an ultrasonic method to scan for surface-breaking cracks and to determine the crack depth in concrete <b>bridge</b> <b>decks...</b>|$|R
30|$|It {{should be}} noted that the {{literature}} is lacking data on the fire resistance of continuous concrete <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> when subjected to top fire loading. Thus, it could be confidently extrapolated that the developed FE model can predict with a reasonable level of accuracy the fire resistance of concrete <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> when subjected to top fire loading.|$|R
25|$|Depending on the design, {{the columns}} may be {{vertical}} or angled or curved {{relative to the}} <b>bridge</b> <b>deck.</b>|$|E
25|$|A cradle system {{carries the}} strands within the stays from the <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> to <b>bridge</b> <b>deck,</b> as a {{continuous}} element, eliminating anchorages in the pylons. Each epoxy-coated steel strand is carried inside the cradle in a one-inch (2.54cm) steel tube. Each strand acts independently, allowing for removal, inspection, and replacement of individual strands. The first two such bridges are the Penobscot Narrows Bridge, completed in 2006, and the Veterans' Glass City Skyway, completed in 2007.|$|E
25|$|In {{suspension}} bridges, large main cables (normally two) hang {{between the}} towers and are anchored {{at each end}} to the ground. This {{can be difficult to}} implement when ground conditions are poor. The main cables, which are free to move on bearings in the towers, bear the load of the <b>bridge</b> <b>deck.</b> Before the deck is installed, the cables are under tension from their own weight. Along the main cables smaller cables or rods connect to the <b>bridge</b> <b>deck,</b> which is lifted in sections. As this is done, the tension in the cables increases, as it does with the live load of traffic crossing the bridge. The tension on the main cables is transferred to the ground at the anchorages and by downwards tug on the towers.|$|E
30|$|Overall, a {{distinct}} {{difference between the}} overall field-observed cracking of the lightweight <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> and normalweight <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> {{included in this study}} was not readily evident through direct paired comparison or though statistical analysis. This finding, based on field observations, differs from those of several studies that have indicated that use of lightweight concrete can reduce cracking.|$|R
40|$|The {{superposition}} {{method is}} employed {{to obtain an}} accurate analytical type solution for the free vibration frequencies and mode shapes of multi-span <b>bridge</b> <b>decks.</b> Free edge conditions are imposed on the long edges running {{in the direction of}} the deck. Inter-span support is of the simple (knife-edge) type. The analysis is valid regardless of the number of spans or their individual lengths. Exact agreement is found when computed results are compared with known eigenvalues for <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> with all spans of equal length. Mode shapes and eigenvalues are presented for typical <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> of three and four span lengths. In each case torsional and non-torsional modes are studied...|$|R

25|$|In the {{cable-stayed}} bridge, {{the towers}} {{are the primary}} load-bearing structures which transmit the bridge loads to the ground. A cantilever approach {{is often used to}} support the <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> near the towers, but lengths further from them are supported by cables running directly to the towers. This has the disadvantage, compared to the suspension bridge, that the cables pull to the sides as opposed to directly up, requiring the <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> to be stronger to resist the resulting horizontal compression loads; but has the advantage of not requiring firm anchorages to resist the horizontal pull of the main cables of the suspension bridge. By design all static horizontal forces of the cable-stayed bridge are balanced so that the supporting towers do not tend to tilt or slide, needing only to resist horizontal forces from the live loads.|$|E
25|$|The more {{detailed}} concept the bridge group proposed in late 2009 included eight traffic lanes (including separate truck and bus lanes), two light rail tracks (in the <b>bridge</b> <b>deck)</b> {{as well as}} walking and cycling paths, possibly with travelators. Backers claimed that the bridge, estimated by them at NZ$2–3 billion, would be significantly cheaper than a tunnel for approximately NZ$4 billion.|$|E
25|$|During 1961 it was {{necessary}} to repair damage to the asphalt surface of the road, and remove rot damage on the <b>bridge</b> <b>deck.</b> In 1964 the bridge was removed to the shipyard for repairs, and the tramway permanently removed. In 1965 the wooden pedestrian sidewalks were replaced with new materials, the concrete columns were reinforced, tooth plate joints were installed, and the bridge repainted.|$|E
40|$|A {{corrugated}} {{core steel}} sandwich plate is a high-performance all-steel structural element. It {{consists of two}} outer steel plates separated by a folded corrugated core plate. Connecting the three plates can be made through hybrid laser-arc welding. In bridge applications, steel sandwich <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> bring several benefits compared to conventional orthotropic decks; better load distribution, higher stiffness to weight ratio and a more industrialized production and construction process. This paper presents a background {{to the concept of}} steel sandwich <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> and comparisons are made to conventional steel <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> in a qualitative and quantitative manner. The results from a study on the impact of the weld joint configuration on the fatigue performance and transverse shear stiffness is presented. In addition possible applications of sandwich <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> are discussed based on case studies. The results show that weight saving with up to 44 % can be achieved by replacing conventional orthotropic decks with steel sandwich plates...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an application for}} the development of stochastic models to predict the deterioration of infrastructure facilities. The main objective is to demonstrate the capabilities and limitations of two types of models, namely state-based and time-based models, which will guide decision makers in selecting the most appropriate model type according to management needs and data availability. Concrete <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> are selected for this application because they are {{considered one of the most}} deteriorating infrastructure components. Inventory and condition data required for developing the stochastic deterioration models are obtained from the database of the Ministére des Transports du Québec (MTQ). Markov-chain models, as an example of state-based models, and non-parametric time-based models are developed for <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> when no maintenance actions are taken. Although this application demonstrates the development of stochastic deterioration models for concrete <b>bridge</b> <b>decks,</b> these models can be developed to predict the performance of other infrastructure facilities for network level analysis.

25|$|State Route 1: In Watsonville, the Struve Slough Bridge collapsed, with concrete/steel support columns {{penetrating}} {{up through}} the <b>bridge</b> <b>deck.</b> The highway was closed for several months until it could be demolished and rebuilt. Another section of Highway 1 through Monterey suffered damage {{and had to be}} rebuilt as well. Additionally, the bridge carrying Highway 1 over the Salinas River near Fort Ord was damaged and subsequently rebuilt.|$|E
25|$|The Farris Engineering Company, a Pittsburgh company {{located in}} the Empire Building, {{performed}} {{a great deal of}} work on the bridge at its new location. The original approved contract for their work had a price total of $271,811.50. They built portions of the substructure that the Foundation Company had not done. Farris also erected the two pony truss approach spans, repaired and painted the main superstructure, and paved the <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> and the two approaches.|$|E
25|$|The extradosed {{bridge is}} a {{cable-stayed}} bridge {{but with a}} more substantial <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> that, being stiffer and stronger, allows the cables to be omitted close to the tower and for the towers to be lower {{in proportion to the}} span. The first extradosed bridges were the Ganter Bridge and Sunniberg Bridge in Switzerland. A new extradosed bridge is also being planned to cross the St. Croix River between Bayport, Minnesota and Houlton, Wisconsin in the Twin Cities.|$|E
40|$|With {{the latest}} {{developments}} of concrete technology, {{it is possible to}} rely on concretes of higher strengths for normal construction activities with confidence. One of the features of stronger concretes is the ability to withstand higher compressive stresses. This advantage has been fully utilized to propose alternative structural forms for <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> using the standard T-beams where the possibility of using lesser number of beams and the lesser quantity of in-situ cast concrete is investigated. It is shown that there is a possibility to form robust <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> with half the number of beams when composite beam slab <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> are formed instead of pseudo-slab type bridges for the same span range...|$|R
40|$|The {{deterioration}} of <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> due to steel corrosion {{is a problem}} encountered several years ago. This project, using galvanized reinforcement, began over twenty years ago. Since that time, epoxy coated reinforcement has become the specified material used in <b>bridge</b> <b>decks.</b> The decks researched in this project are located on 1 - 35 in Story County. They were constructed in 1967. The results from the testing done on this project show that galvanizing protects steel from corrosion due to deicing salts, resulting in less/no concrete deterioration...|$|R

25|$|In an underspanned {{suspension}} bridge, {{the main}} cables hang entirely below the <b>bridge</b> <b>deck,</b> {{but are still}} anchored into {{the ground in a}} similar way to the conventional type. Very few bridges of this nature have been built, as the deck is inherently less stable than when suspended below the cables. Examples include the Pont des Bergues of 1834 designed by Guillaume Henri Dufour; James Smith's Micklewood Bridge; and a proposal by Robert Stevenson for a bridge over the River Almond near Edinburgh.|$|E
25|$|Wave-piercing {{catamarans}} {{employ a}} low-buoyancy bow on each hull that is {{pointed at the}} water line and rises aft, up to a level, to allow each hull to pierce waves, rather than ride over them. This allows higher speeds through waves than for a conventional catamaran. They are distinguished from SWATH catamarans, in that the buoyant part of the hull is not tubular. The spanning <b>bridge</b> <b>deck</b> may be configured {{with some of the}} characteristics of a normal V-hull, which allows it to penetrate the crests of waves.|$|E
25|$|The gaps in {{the right}} end of the {{structure}} reveal the hollow chamber construction method of the <b>bridge</b> <b>deck,</b> typical of several Roman bridges in Asia Minor, e.g. the Aesepus Bridge. The great height of the ancient structure is further verified by the discovery of 1.5m long iron threaded rods, which, bound together with hooks and loops, were used to reinforce the masonry in the bridge's foundations. The {{main body of the}} bridge was built using concrete, which survives in at least one Seljuq-era pier as a foundation.|$|E

The gap between the <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> of pillars PB10 and PB11 was closed during the summer. Despite the low water levels in the Danube river {{construction}} continued swiftly, working on the abutment A3, on the Romanian river bank.|$|R
40|$|Honeycomb {{structures}} {{have been}} used in different engineering fields. In civil engineering, honeycomb fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) structures {{have been used}} as <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> to rehabilitate highway bridges in the United States. In this work, a simplified finite-element modeling technique for honeycomb FRP <b>bridge</b> <b>decks</b> is presented. The motivation is the combination of the complex geometry of honeycomb FRP decks and computational limits, which may prevent modeling of these decks in detail. The results from static and modal analyses indicate that the proposed modeling technique provides a viable tool for modeling the complex geometry of honeycomb FRP <b>bridge</b> <b>decks.</b> The modeling of other bridge components (e. g., steel girders, steel guardrails, deck-to-girder connections, and pier supports) is also presented in this work...|$|R
