5|$|Hundreds {{of members}} of the Bosnian Muslim SS {{divisions}} volunteered to fight in the 1948–1949 Arab–Israeli War. Many were recruited by agents of al-Husayni, who achieved political leadership of the Palestinian Arabs following the 1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine. The Syrian government also made a request for the transfer of 8,000 Bosnian Muslim refugees to Syria, many for recruitment into the Syrian Armed Forces. Iraq sent representatives to Europe and invited 2,500 Bosnian Muslims to settle in their nation. Frantzman and Culibrk estimate that approximately 1,000 former Bosnian Muslim SS members fought in Palestine, <b>but</b> <b>say</b> it is possible that Bosnian Muslim participation was much more extensive. Contemporary Haganah intelligence records suggest that up to 4,000 Bosnian Muslim volunteers took part. Many of the volunteers served in the Arab Liberation Army's Ajnaddin Battalion, as well as the Army of the Holy War.|$|E

25|$|The {{world price}} of vitamin C rose sharply in 2008 {{partly as a}} result of rises in basic food prices but also in {{anticipation}} of a stoppage of the two Chinese plants, situated at Shijiazhuang near Beijing, as part of a general shutdown of polluting industry in China over the period of the Olympic games. Five Chinese manufacturers met in 2010, among them Northeast Pharmaceutical Group and North China Pharmaceutical Group, and agreed to temporarily stop production in order to maintain prices. In 2011 an American suit was filed against four Chinese companies that allegedly colluded to limit production and fix prices of vitamin C in the United States. According to the plaintiffs, after the agreement was made spot prices for vitamin C shot to as high as $7 per kilogram in December 2002 from $2.50 per kilogram in December 2001. The companies did not deny the accusation <b>but</b> <b>say</b> in their defense that the Chinese government compelled them to act in this way. In January 2012 a United States judge ruled that the Chinese companies can be sued in the U.S. by buyers acting as a group.|$|E

500|$|In government, Elizabeth {{was more}} {{moderate}} than {{her father and}} half-siblings had been. One of her mottoes was [...] "video et taceo" [...] ("I see <b>but</b> <b>say</b> nothing"). In religion, she was relatively tolerant and avoided systematic persecution. After the pope declared her illegitimate in 1570 and released her subjects from obedience to her, several conspiracies threatened her life, {{all of which were}} defeated {{with the help of her}} ministers' secret service. Elizabeth was cautious in foreign affairs, manoeuvring between the major powers of France and Spain. She only half-heartedly supported a number of ineffective, poorly resourced military campaigns in the Netherlands, France, and Ireland. By the mid-1580s, England could no longer avoid war with Spain. [...] England's defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 associated Elizabeth with one of the greatest military victories in English history.|$|E

500|$|Other {{issues of}} {{contention}} include {{the lack of}} historical context; the film does not cover some of the {{events leading up to}} Chávez's ousting, including the long-running political crisis and the general strike. Gunson also criticizes the filmmakers for showing events out of order. In June 2002, they filmed an opposition community group as its members considered [...] "how to defend themselves against possible... attacks" [...] from Chávez's supporters. In the film, this sequence is placed before the march. Bartley justified the action, saying that the residents' opinions were representative of those held [...] "long before" [...] the events of April 2002. Responding to the critique, the BBC added a date stamp to the sequence for the film's repeat broadcast. Gunson also cites footage of Caracas mayor Freddy Bernal as he sings to a happy group of Chávez supporters in front of the palace. Later images of a [...] "differently dressed Bernal" [...] reveal that the footage was from another day. Similarly, Gunson says that until shot at, [...] "The opposition march was entirely peaceful." [...] The film presents footage of its [...] "violent finale"—including an image from another day—as if it occurred during the protest's approach to the palace, accompanied by the narrated claim that [...] "some in the vanguard looked ready for a fight". Bartley and ÓBriain admit that they included a [...] "limited" [...] amount of archive footage, <b>but</b> <b>say</b> it was a [...] "legitimate reconstruction" [...] to build context [...] "before the core narrative of the coup [...] off" [...] as they [...] "could not be everywhere filming at all times".|$|E

2500|$|Emission theory, {{also called}} emitter theory or {{ballistic}} theory of light, was a competing theory {{for the special}} theory of relativity, explaining {{the results of the}} Michelson–Morley experiment of 1887.
