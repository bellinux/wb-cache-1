5|$|A scene {{featuring}} multiple clones of {{the character}} Kurt Crawford was achieved with motion control photography, allowing actor David Lovgren to portray all of the clones—multiple takes were recorded with the actor in different positions within the scene, and by using a camera controlled <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> to follow exactly the same motions for each take, these could be seamlessly composited together. Producer Paul Rabwin has noted that achieving these shots was difficult due to the mixture of green and blue light sources in the scene.|$|E

5|$|Birdy was {{the first}} feature film to be {{partially}} shot with the Skycam, a computer-controlled, cable-suspended camera system created by Garrett Brown, inventor of the Steadicam. The Skycam had 100-foot high posts with four hanging wires controlled <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer,</b> and a lightweight Panavision camera with 200 feet of film hung {{at the center of}} the wires. The filmmakers intended to use the Skycam to fully depict Birdy's point of view during a fantasy sequence in which he imagines himself flying. However, they encountered difficulties with the Skycam, which would often malfunction. Although the Skycam proved successful on its first take, Parker insisted that the filmed footage be shot more rapidly. However, the camera system malfunctioned during its second take, after capturing 40 seconds of footage. This resulted in the camera operators shooting the remainder of the sequence with a Steadicam mounted on top of an improvised camera dolly.|$|E

The machine uses the original chessboard, which was stored separately from the original Turk and was not destroyed in the fire. The first public display of Gaughan's Turk was in November 1989 at a history of magic conference.

5|$|There is an inherent, {{systemic}} {{problem with}} any metric based on comparing {{with one or}} a few reference translations: in real life, sentences can be translated in many different ways, sometimes with no overlap. Therefore, the approach of comparing by how much any given translation result <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> differs from just a few human translations is flawed. HyTER is another automated MT metric that compares to very many translations in a reference grammar defined by human translators; the drawback is then that the human effort involved in correctly defining the combinatorially many ways to render the meaning of the translation in practice means HyTER also is only an approximation.|$|E

5|$|Phase {{shifting}} interferometry overcomes {{these limitations}} by not relying on finding fringe centers, {{but rather by}} collecting intensity data from every point of the CCD image sensor. As seen in Fig.17, multiple interferograms (at least three) are analyzed with the reference optical surface shifted by a precise fraction of a wavelength between each exposure using a piezoelectric transducer (PZT). Alternatively, precise phase shifts can be introduced by modulating the laser frequency. The captured images are processed <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> to calculate the optical wavefront errors. The precision and reproducibility of PSI is far greater than possible in static interferogram analysis, with measurement repeatabilities of a hundredth of a wavelength being routine. Phase shifting technology has been adapted {{to a variety of}} interferometer types such as Twyman-Green, Mach–Zehnder, laser Fizeau, and even common path configurations such as point diffraction and lateral shearing interferometers. More generally, phase shifting techniques can be adapted to almost any system that uses fringes for measurement, such as holographic and speckle interferometry.|$|E
5|$|The Outlaw Star manga {{series and}} {{animated}} television series are paced differently. The anime episodes often involve Gene and his comrades taking on various jobs or missions to fund their ship's massive maintenance costs. Throughout their travels, the crew often encounters Ronald MacDougall and Harry MacDougall, {{a pair of}} bounty hunters {{responsible for the death}} of Gene's father. Ronald acts as a rival to Gene, while Harry wishes to form a bond with Melfina, a bio-android like himself, who instead develops strong feelings for Gene. The crew also contends with others that learn of the Outlaw Star's connection to the Galactic Leyline. They are Nguyen Khan, a scientist wishing to gain omniscience through the Leyline; and Lord Hazanko, the leader of the ruthless assassin organization the Anten Seven that seek the Leyline to gain ultimate power. The series climaxes when all parties meet on the physical plane of the Leyline. In the end, Ron MacDougall retreats, saved <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> copy of his brother Harry (who is killed trying to protect Melfina from Hazanko), Khan is integrated into the Leyline as data, Gene reveals to Melfina that he is in love with her and frees her from the Leyline by making it their shared wish to be together forever, and Hazanko is eventually defeated by the Outlaw Star crewmembers. Once the conflict comes to a close, Gene and his friends return to Sentinel III and go their separate ways, but ultimately reunite to continue their adventures together.|$|E
5|$|The {{high regard}} with which The Invincibles {{are held in}} the annals of Australian and world cricket is {{reflected}} in the various honours accorded to the players. Bradman, Lindwall and Miller were among the ten inaugural inductees into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 1996. Hassett, Morris and Harvey were later inducted, so that 20% of the inductees are from the 1948 team. Of these six, all except Hassett were selected in Australia's Team of the Century, with Bradman as captain and Miller his deputy. Bradman, Lindwall, Miller and Harvey are among a group of only 14 Australians in a total of 60 players who have been inducted into the International Cricket Council's Hall of Fame. In The Ten Greatest Test Teams by Tom Graveney with Norman Miller ten teams were compared <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> and the 1948 Australians emerged second behind the 1984 West Indians. Graveney strongly disagreed with the result, writing 'there has not been a better team in my lifetime than Don Bradman's Australian tourists of 1948'. The computer regarded Sam Loxton {{as a member of the}} team as he played more Tests in the series than Neil Harvey, if Harvey had been picked the Australians would have been the superior team.|$|E
