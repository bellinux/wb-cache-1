This paper therefore adjusts South Africa's general government primary balance for terms-of-trade effects by means of an alternative calculation of the transitory component based on a measure of the real income gap rather than the real output gap.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the empirical relationship between real money balances, real income, and the opportunity cost variables in Turkey using quarterly data between the periods 1987 Q 1 - 2003 Q 3. The estimation results reveal that long run demand for real cash <b>balances</b> depends <b>on</b> real <b>income,</b> interest rate <b>on</b> government securities and the exchange rate. The long run elasticity of income is close to one with the opportunity cost variables carrying the expected signs. Based on the cointegration and the weak exogeneity test results, single equation error correction model is specified and estimated. The estimated models disclose the fact that the income and the interest rate effects is much smaller in the short run than the long run, whereas exchange rate influence is more pronounced in the short run.

This study analyzes the extent to which the seven generally accepted hotel valuation techniques might be appropriate for China, since those approaches rely on certain types of data and financial ratios that may not be readily available.

40|$|The OPEC {{members have}} {{experienced}} wide fluctuations in their trade balances. This {{can be attributed}} to several factors: (1) heavy dependence of national income and export earnings on a single primary export-oil; (2) instability of price and world demand for oil; and (3) the exchange rate regime practiced in recent years. ^ An exchange rate policy can be used to minimize the fluctuations in trade balance, given the changes in exchange rates of major international currencies. ^ The {{purpose of this study is}} two fold; first, examine the effects of fluctuations in trade <b>balance</b> <b>on</b> the OPEC economies, and second, propose appropriate exchange rate regime for selected OPEC members. ^ The study is divided into two parts. The first part demonstrates the impact of trade <b>balance</b> changes <b>on</b> national <b>income</b> and other macroeconomic variables using a Keynesian framework. The second part involves using conventional trade models to search for the appropriate exchange rate regime to minimize the fluctuations in trade balance of each sample country. ^ The study 2 ̆ 7 s findings are: first, fluctuations in trade balances had negative effects on the economies of Algeria, Kuwait, Libya, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. Second, the current exchange rate regime of no sample country is optimal in minimizing trade balance fluctuations. Third, in contrast to expectations, U. S. dollar peg did not stabilize the trade balance of any OPEC member. Finally, the results show that the sample OPEC economies could have enjoyed faster [...] though with different degree [...] economic growth if they had pegged their currencies to the derived optimal exchange rate regime. These optimal exchange rate regimes are: the SDR for Algeria and the United Arab Emirates, the purchasing power parity for Libya and Saudi Arabia, and the real Yen for Kuwait. ...|$|R

40|$|Both in its {{institutional}} {{range and}} in its penetration of financial markets, the microfinance sector in Bolivia rivals any in the world, and has played a major part in extracting the macro-economy from meltdown since the mid- 1980 s. We seek specifically to assess its impact on poverty, and do this through small-sample surveys on four microfinance institutions, two urban and two rural, using a range of poverty concepts: income (generated both through the borrower's enterprise and through the labour market), asset holdings and diversity, and various measures of vulnerability. All the institutions studied had, <b>on</b> <b>balance,</b> positive impacts <b>on</b> <b>income</b> and asset levels, with income impacts correlating negatively with <b>income</b> <b>on</b> account of poor households choosing to invest in low-risk, low-return assets. Microfinance may, however, augment vulnerability: average debt-service ratios of microfinance clients are disturbingly high, and if the coping mechanisms used by borrowers fail, borrowers may be {{forced out of the}} microfinance system, possibly resulting in decapitalisation and impoverishment. Poorer households are more restricted in their choice of coping strategy, and many as a consequence 'choose' coping strategies more likely to jeopardise their long-term income prospects, in particular asset sales and cuts in children's schooling. The more successful low-income borrowers are those who have voluntary savings deposits and do not rush into fixed capital purchases too early: collapse back into poverty is associated with multiple crises and the failure of one or more 'safety nets', in particular of one or more 'safety nets', in particular support from a member's solidarity group. The following actions appear to be promising for the further reduction of poverty in Bolivia: stronger efforts to mobilise rural savings, removal of lower limits on loan size, and the introduction of appropriate insurance mechanisms. In comparison with other anti-poverty measures, microfinance appears to be successful and relative cheap at reducing the poverty of those close to the poverty line, but ineffective, by comparison with labour-market and infrastructural measures, in reducing extreme poverty.

Using cointegration techniques and the Johansen procedure they first establish a desired long-run demand function for liquid assets depending <b>on</b> <b>income,</b> wealth and a set of interest rates. Deviations of liquidity from this desired level cause changes in consumption via intertemporal substitution but via its effect on disequilibrium liquidity. Consumption is modeled in an error-correction framework and is also found to depend <b>on</b> <b>income</b> and financial wealth. Both the disequilibrium liquidity and wealth terms may be picking up the effects of financial liberalization (e. g.

They also find some evidence that changes in the distribution of income have an independent effect on aggregate consumption. Copyright 1991 by MIT Press. ...|$|R

We examined single-leg stance on prosthesis vs. sound limb <b>balancing</b> <b>on</b> narrow ridges in transtibial amputees. When <b>balancing</b> <b>on</b> the prosthetic limb, the lateral displacement of the center of pressure was reduced and was compensated by an increase in counter-rotation. We show that single-leg stance on a prosthetic limb can be compared to <b>balancing</b> <b>on</b> a narrow ridge. Standing on a prosthetic limb involves the same balance mechanisms as <b>balancing</b> <b>on</b> narrow ridges of 40 -mm to 20 -mm width. Yet, the ability to <b>balance</b> <b>on</b> a narrow ridge with the sound limb was only a weak predictor for an amputee's ability to stand on the prosthetic limb. Balancing in single-leg stance on a prosthetic limb is not a common activity. The ability to compensate with the sound limb may therefore be functionally more important than the ability to stay in dynamic <b>balance</b> <b>on</b> the prosthetic limb. (C) 2016 IPEM.
