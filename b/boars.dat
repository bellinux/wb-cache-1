5|$|Verger bribes Justice Department {{official}} Paul Krendler {{to accuse}} Starling of withholding {{a note from}} Lecter, leading to her suspension. Lecter lures Starling to Union Station. Verger's men, having trailed Starling, capture and bring Lecter to Verger. Verger intends to feed Lecter alive to a herd of wild <b>boars</b> bred specifically for this purpose. After her superiors refuse to act, Starling infiltrates Verger's estate. After neutralizing the two guards and freeing Lecter, she is shot by a third guard who was in hiding. Lecter picks up an unconscious Starling just before the <b>boars</b> break through the doors. Verger orders his physician Cordell Doemling to shoot Lecter, but, with Lecter's suggestion, Cordell shoves his hated boss into the pen. Lecter carries Starling and watches the <b>boars</b> eat Verger alive.|$|E
5|$|The Guilden Morden boar {{recalls the}} Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf, where helmets with boar imagery are {{referenced}} five times.

Such is the case when Grendel's mother seeks vengeance {{for the death of}} her son.|$|E
5|$|Domesticated {{guinea pigs}} thrive {{in groups of}} two or more; groups of sows, or groups {{of one or more}} sows and a {{neutered}} boar are common combinations. Guinea pigs learn to recognize and bond with other individual guinea pigs, and testing of <b>boars</b> shows their neuroendocrine stress response is significantly lowered {{in the presence of a}} bonded female when compared to the presence of unfamiliar females. Groups of <b>boars</b> may also get along, provided their cage has enough space, they are introduced at an early age, and no females are present. Domestic guinea pigs have developed a different biological rhythm from their wild counterparts, and have longer periods of activity followed by short periods of sleep in between. Activity is scattered randomly over the day; aside from avoidance of intense light, no regular circadian patterns are apparent.|$|E
50|$|Upon its {{founding}} in October 1973, the <b>Boar</b> incorporated Campus, the student newspaper of the late 1960s and early 1970s. For a brief period in 1988, the <b>Boar</b> {{changed its name to}} Mercury, though {{by the end of the}} academic year it reverted to the <b>Boar.</b> With the exception of the occasional comedy issue of the Warwick Goat, the <b>Boar</b> has consistently remained as the <b>Boar</b> or the Warwick <b>Boar.</b>|$|R
50|$|Catch dogs {{physically}} {{take hold}} of the <b>boar,</b> typically seizing {{the base of the}} <b>boar's</b> ear. Once the catch dogs have physical control of the <b>boar,</b> they will hold it down by the head indefinitely until the hunter arrives. The hunter then comes in from behind the <b>boar,</b> and dispatches the <b>boar</b> with a knife or spear.|$|R
40|$|The wild <b>boar</b> {{is a large}} {{ungulate}} {{which may}} produce serious economic problems. As the wild <b>boar</b> is highly reproductive, a fast dispersing species and flexible in behavior, management has to be adapted to the adaptive wild <b>boar</b> populations. On the other hand, the wild <b>boar</b> lives small scaled in family-groups, which enables management concepts on regional scale. Female wild <b>boar</b> of all age classes should be hunted in favour by comprehensive hunting methods for wild <b>boar</b> population regulation...|$|R
5|$|Several wild <b>boars</b> (Sus scrofa) {{are native}} to the park. They are often found near the beaches where they feed on scraps and trash dropped by visitors. Further within the forests of the peninsula, other mammals can be spotted, such as golden jackals (Canis aureus), Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), and even several striped hyenas (Hyaena hyaena) and caracals (Caracal caracal), among many others usually not native to such areas.|$|E
5|$|The 2009 {{wildlife}} {{survey conducted}} by Government of Tamil Nadu enumerated 10 Bengal tigers, 866 Indian elephants, 672 gaurs, and 27 leopards. The survey party observed four additional species of horned antelope including 2,348 spotted deer, 1,068 blackbucks, 304 sambar deer, 77 barking deer and four-horned antelopes, 843 wild <b>boars,</b> 43 sloth bears and 15 striped hyenas. Herds of the famous feral buffaloes can also be spotted in places near the Moyar river.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} wild mammalians {{may be found}} in Canadian {{territory}} without being confirmed natives. Some were voluntarily or involuntarily introduced. These include the house mouse (Mus musculus), and Norway and black rats (respectively Rattus norvegicus and R. rattus). Other include escaped animals; the Coypu (Myocastor coypus), European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and Hares (Lepus europaeus), as well as feral cats, dogs and horses fall into this category. Fallow deers (Dama dama) and wild <b>boars</b> (Sus scrofa) were introduced for hunting.|$|E

5|$|In eastern Serbia it was {{believed}} that ale who interact with people can metamorphose into humans or animals, after which their true selves can be seen only by so-called šestaci– men with six fingers on both hands and six toes on both feet– though human-looking ale cause houses to shake when they enter. By a belief recorded in the Homolje region, ale that charge to the Moon also display shapeshifting abilities: they repeatedly shift from their basic shape of two-headed snakes to six-fingered men who hold iron pitchforks, black young bulls, big <b>boars,</b> or black wolves, and back.|$|E
5|$|Key {{protein sources}} include birds and tenrecs. Mikea adults and {{children}} of both sexes use clubs to kill the small tenrec (tambotrika, 0.4 kilograms), which is widespread year round, and the larger one (tandraka, 2-3 kilograms), which is mainly caught during the rainy season. To a lesser extent they also hunt or trap two to three species of lemur, feral cats, occasional wild <b>boars,</b> turtles and rodents using blowguns, spears and dogs, and use a hook and line to catch fish in saline inland lakes. Some Mikea raise animals for food or sale at market, including goats, chickens and guinea fowl; tree nuts also provide additional protein.|$|E
5|$|The city is {{surrounded}} by forests and grasslands. Rare species of plants, such as Venus's slipper and iris, {{are found in the}} two botanical reservations of Cluj-Napoca, Fânațele Clujului and Rezervația Valea Morii ("Mill Valley Reservation"). Animals such as <b>boars,</b> badgers, foxes, rabbits and squirrels live in nearby forest areas such as Făget and Hoia. The latter forest hosts the Romulus Vuia ethnographical park, with exhibits dating back to 1678. Various people report alien encounters in the Hoia-Baciu forest, large networks of catacombs that connect the old churches of the city, or the presence of a monster in the nearby lake of Tarnița.|$|E

Finally, they contended that, although the days had been unusually warm and wild <b>boars</b> were known to inhabit the area, Baker's body showed no obvious signs of decomposition or disturbance by animals, as might have been expected had it been there for six days, as the prosecution had charged.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} food {{eaten in}} Sihanaka {{has long been}} rice, which they cultivate heavily. The rice based diet was supplemented by {{a wide range of}} game and other meats, including lemurs, wild <b>boars,</b> snakes, owls, rats, cats and crocodile, the latter having at one time been protected by a fady that was eventually abandoned. Use of tobacco or marijuana and consumption of pork were commonly forbidden in Sihanaka families. Many believed that transporting swine across Lake Alaotra would bring storms. Their traditional dress consisted of clothing woven of raffia fibers.|$|E
5|$|Even at {{the start}} of the Middle Ages the English {{landscape}} had been shaped by human occupation over many centuries. Much woodland was new, the result of fields being reclaimed by brush after the collapse of the Roman Empire. Human intervention had established wood pastures, an ancient system for managing woods and animals, and coppicing, a more intensive approach to managing woodlands. Other agricultural lands included arable fields and pastorage, while in some parts of the country, such as the South-West, waste moorland remained testament to earlier over-farming in the Bronze Age. England's environment continued to be shaped throughout the period, through the building of dykes to drain marshes, tree clearance and the large-scale extraction of peat. Managed parks for hunting game, including deer and <b>boars,</b> were built as status symbols by the nobility from the 12th century onwards, but earlier versions of parks, such as hays, may have originated as early as the 7th century.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, the wild <b>boar</b> has been {{undergoing}} an expansion in Europe, which may have negatively affected small game populations and particularly red-legged partridges. We aim to evaluate the red-legged partridge nest predation by wild <b>boar</b> at high <b>boar</b> abundances by placing artificial nests in nine big game estates. Predation rates were compared between nests placed in fenced controlled plots with no wild <b>boar</b> access (but accessible to other predators) and open plots in which the wild <b>boar</b> gains access. The proportion of nests and eggs predated was significantly lower in wild <b>boar</b> exclusion areas, recording a predation rate of 50 % for the nests and 38 % for the eggs in these areas, whereas {{in the presence of}} wild <b>boar,</b> the predation rate was 80 % for the nests and 58 % for the eggs. Moreover, the wild <b>boar</b> was identified as the main nest predator in unfenced areas, accounting for 36 and 48 % of the predated nests and eggs respectively.

Sometimes during the season when mahua trees bloom, wild Asiatic elephants from Jharkhand come in trampling crops and threatening life and property. Birds of Birbhum include a mix of hilly and plain-land dwelling species like partridge, pigeon, green pigeon, water fowls, doyel, Indian robin, drongo, hawk, cuckoo, koel, sunbird, Indian roller, parrot, babbler, and some migratory birds.|$|E
5|$|The boar-hunting scene is, in contrast, {{laden with}} detail. <b>Boars</b> were (and are) much more {{difficult}} to hunt than deer; approaching one with only a sword was akin to challenging a knight to single combat. In the hunting sequence, the boar flees but is cornered before a ravine. He turns to face Bertilak {{with his back to the}} ravine, prepared to fight. Bertilak dismounts and in the ensuing fight kills the boar. He removes its head and displays it on a pike. In the seduction scene, Bertilak's wife, like the boar, is more forward, insisting that Gawain has a romantic reputation and that he must not disappoint her. Gawain, however, is successful in parrying her attacks, saying that surely she knows more than he about love. Both the boar hunt and the seduction scene can be seen as depictions of a moral victory: both Gawain and Bertilak face struggles alone and emerge triumphant.|$|E
50|$|In Ancient Greek culture, the <b>boar</b> {{represented}} death, {{due to its}} {{hunting season}} beginning on 23 September, the near end of the year. The <b>boar</b> was also seen as a representation of darkness battling against light, due to its dark colouration and nocturnal habits. <b>Boar</b> hunts appear frequently in Ancient Greek mythology and literature. The first recorded mention of a <b>boar</b> hunt in Europe occurs in 700 BC in Homer's rendition of {{the hunt for the}} Calydonian <b>boar.</b> In Homer's Odyssey, Odysseus was injured on the leg during a <b>boar</b> hunt as a boy. The scar on his leg is what leads Eurycleia to recognise him on his return to Ithaca.

5000|$|The <b>boar</b> {{was used}} as an emblem in some {{instances}} during antiquity and the early medieval period (i.e. predating the development of classical European heraldry).

5|$|The city {{is divided}} into two {{distinctive}} geographic regions: the dry eastern side which includes majority of the urban area {{of the city and the}} western region which borders the Nilgiris, Anaimalai and Munnar ranges. Palghat Gap, a mountain pass which connects the neighbouring state of Kerala to Tamil Nadu, lies to the west of the city. Because of its location in the biodiversity hotspot of the Western Ghats, it is rich in fauna and flora. The Coimbatore urban wetlands harbours around 116 species of birds, of which 66 are resident, 17 are migratory and 33 are local migrants. The spot-billed pelican, painted stork, openbill stork, ibis, spot-billed duck, teal and black-winged stilt visit the Coimbatore wetlands on their migration. Apart from the species common to the plains, various threatened and endangered species such as Indian elephants, wild <b>boars,</b> leopards, Bengal tigers, gaurs, Nilgiri tahr, sloth bear and black-headed oriole are found in the region.|$|E
5|$|The hurst {{of trees}} with a {{representation}} of the Pole Star above are a play on the name Northwood.

The Manor was later seized by Henry V and granted as part of the endowment of King's College, Cambridge. The Abbey and the College were dedicated to St. Mary, one of whose symbols is a fleur-de-lis. The 'rye slips' are a play on the name Ruislip. The wild boar shows that the Lordship was an ancient one, granted when the land was forest roamed by wild <b>boars.</b>|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} little {{opportunity}} to study epidemiology in the Sumatran rhinoceros. Ticks and gyrostigma were reported to cause deaths in captive animals in the 19th century. The rhino is also known to be vulnerable to the blood disease surra, which can be spread by horse-flies carrying parasitic trypanosomes; in 2004, all five rhinos at the Sumatran Rhinoceros Conservation Centre died over an 18-day period after becoming infected by the disease. The Sumatran rhino has no known predators other than humans. Tigers and wild dogs may be capable of killing a calf, but calves stay close to their mothers, {{and the frequency of}} such killings is unknown. Although the rhino's range overlaps with elephants and tapirs, the species do not appear to compete for food or habitat. Elephants (Elephas maximus) and Sumatran rhinos are even known to share trails, and many smaller species such as deer, <b>boars,</b> and wild dogs will use the trails the rhinos and elephants create.|$|E
