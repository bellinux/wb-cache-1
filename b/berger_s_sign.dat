The current paper is an addition to [T. <b>Berger</b> and <b>S.</b> Trenn, SIAM J. Matrix Anal.

40|$|This article {{deals with}} the history of {{membranous}} superficial fascia (Antonio Scarpa, Abraham Colles), the history of clinical signs that use discoloration of the torso (Cullen 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sign,</b> Grey Turner 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sign,</b> Fox 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sign,</b> Bryant 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sign)</b> and then describes anatomical dissection studies to link the two. INTRODUCTION: The membranous superficial fascia (MSF) was described early in the 19 th century, as was its role in the clinical sign of urethral disruption. Clinical signs of haemorrhage or leakage of pancreatic and biliary fluid into the retroperitoneum, which were described throughout the 20 th century, all relied on circumscribed discolouration of the skin of the torso. The objective {{of this study was to}} relate the anatomy of the MSF to clinical signs of retroperitoneal catastrophe. METHODS: The MSF was dissected in the torso of seven embalmed cadavers to note its extent and its attachments. The attachments of the MSF were mapped to the areas of skin discolouration that are described in the clinical signs. RESULTS: The well known extent of the MSF in the inguinal region, its continuation into the perineum and its attachment to the fascia lata of the thigh were confirmed with our method of dissection. Dissection was continued superiorly, demonstrating continuation of the MSF over the entire torso with loose fibrous attachment of the MSF to the deep fascia. The MSF is firmly adherent to the midline of the abdomen except for the umbilicus, to a horizontal line below the clavicles and laterally in the abdomen to form pockets. The lines of firm adhesion correspond with the borders of the discoloured areas described in the clinical signs. CONCLUSIONS: Circumscription of discolouration seen in the eponymous clinical signs of retroperitoneal catastrophe is explained by confinement of coloured retroperitoneal fluid by the MSF and its deep attachments...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Sign-out (SO) is a {{challenge}} to the emergency physician. Some training programs have instituted overlapping 9 -hour shifts. The residents see patients for eight hours, and have one hour of wrap-up time. This hour helps them complete patient care, leaving fewer patients to sign-out. We examined whether this strategy impacts SO burden. Methods: This is a retrospective review of patients evaluated by emergency medicine (EM) residents working 9 -hour (eight hours of patient care, one hour wrap-up time) and 12 -hour shifts (12 hours patient care, no reserved time for wrap-up). Data were collected by reviewing the clinical tracker. A patient was assigned to the resident who initiated care and dictated the chart. SO was defined as any patient in the ED without disposition at change of shift. Patient turn-around-time (TAT) was also recorded. Results: One-hundred sixty-one postgraduate-year-one resident (PGY 1), 264 postgraduate-yeartwo resident (PGY 2), and 193 postgraduate-year-three resident (PGY 3) shifts were included. PGY 1 <b>s</b> <b>signed</b> out 1. 9 patients per 12 -hour shift. PGY 2 <b>s</b> <b>signed</b> out 2. 3 patients on 12 -hour shifts and 1. 8 patients on 9 -hour shifts.

40|$|While the {{aetiology}} of eponymous surface {{signs of}} retroperitoneal haemorrhage and bile leakage is known, {{it is unclear}} what causes their appearance. The location of Scarpa 2 ̆ 7 s fascia makes it a potential candidate in understanding the pattern of these signs. In this study, dissections were performed on seven embalmed cadavers and the Visible Human Project was examined to determine Scarpa’s fasica’s role in these clinical signs. Scarpa 2 ̆ 7 s fascia attaches where the umbilicus emerges from the external oblique aponeurosis providing a deficiency that may cause the bruising in Cullen 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sign.</b> As the membranous layer continues into the flanks, it creates a pocket which may account for Turner 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sign.</b> The continuation of the membranous layer into the axilla and chest forms another pocket where bile may accumulate in Icterus Marginatus.
