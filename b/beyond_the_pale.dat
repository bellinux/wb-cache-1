Harrington took part in this offensive, and Clifford came from the west with reinforcements, only to lose many men in the fighting. A surprise attack on the O'Connors in the heart of their country was successful: their children were exposed to the might of the Crown army, their corn was burned, and 500 cows were seized in thick woods. But Essex had failed once more to engage a significant rebel force and he withdrew to Dublin.|$|E

25|$|While the Pundras {{and their}} habitat were {{looked down upon}} as impure in later Vedic {{literature}} because they fell <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>pale</b> of Vedic culture, an inscription written in Prakrit in the Brāhmī script of the 3rd century BC, found at Mahasthangarh, ancient site of Pundranagara, indicates that the area imbibed, like adjoining Magadha, many elements of Aryan culture. Buddhism was introduced into North Bengal, if not other parts of Bengal, before Ashoka. Two Votive inscriptions on the railings of the Buddhist stupa at Sanchi of about the 2nd century BC records the gifts of two inhabitants of Punavadhana which undoubtedly stands for Pundravardhana. The impact of Aryan-Brahmana culture was felt in Bengal much after the same spread across northern India. The various non-Aryan people then living in Bengal were powerful and thus the spread of Aryan-Brahman culture was strongly resisted and the assimilation took a long time.|$|E
25|$|The {{greatest}} {{criticism of}} chabad messiansim was leveled by Professor David Berger. In a series or articles that were later published {{in his book}} The Rebbe, the Messiah, and the Scandal of Orthodox Indifference, Berger argued {{that there is no}} source in Jewish theology for the concept that a Messiah will come, begin his mission, only to die, and then be resurrected to complete his mission. As a result of this, Berger argued that Chabad Messianism, which he claimed was prevalent in majority of Chabad and its largest institutions, was <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>pale</b> of Orthodoxy and perhaps even heretical. His positions sparked much controversy in the Jewish world during the late 1990s and early 2000s. In his book he documents his efforts to mobilize other rabbis and rabbinical organizations to delegitimize Chabad. He concludes by recording his great frustrations in not being able to achieve this.|$|E
25|$|A {{state of}} Lhomon (literally, {{southern}} darkness) or Monyul (dark land, {{a reference to}} the Monpa one of the Tibeto-Burman people of Bhutan), possibly a part of Tibet that was then <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>pale</b> of Buddhist teachings. Monyul is thought to have existed between AD 100 and AD 600. The names Lhomon Tsendenjong (southern Mon sandalwood country) and Lhomon Khashi (southern Mon country of four approaches), found in ancient Bhutanese and Tibetan chronicles, may also have credence and have been used by some Bhutanese scholars when referring to their homeland. Variations of the Sanskrit words Bhota-ant (end of Bhot) or Bhu-uttan (meaning highlands) have been suggested by historians as origins of the name Bhutan, which came into common foreign use in the late 19th century and is used in Bhutan only in English-language official correspondence. The traditional name of the country since the 17th century has been Drukyul—country of the Drukpa, the Dragon people, or the Land of the Thunder Dragon, {{a reference to the}} country's dominant Buddhist sect.|$|E

King George had strongly disliked the depiction of him Pistrucci had prepared for his coinage. Soon after this, he ordered a new one to be based on a portrait by Francis Chantrey, and Pistrucci refused the instructions to prepare the dies, again declining to copy the work of another artist. The resulting furore endangered his position, causing him to be excluded from further work on the coinage, and Pistrucci was instructed to concentrate on the Waterloo Medal. By 1826, part of one side had been completed. With Pistrucci's role at the Royal Mint now controversial, according to the Royal Mint Museum, [...] "his progress was slow—and deliberately so since he feared that, having put himself <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>pale</b> by his obstinate behaviour, the Royal Mint would sever its association with him as soon as he handed over the dies." ...|$|E
500|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 1934 season Larwood was fit again, and it was anticipated that he would play in the Tests. Jardine had earlier issued an unequivocal statement that he would not play. By way of confirming their commitment not to use bodyline, the MCC committee decided that Larwood should apologise to the Australians for his bowling on the 1932–33 tour. No such apology had been requested from Jardine; Larwood refused to do so, insisting that he had bowled precisely as instructed by his captain. Shortly before the second Test, he wrote in the Sunday Dispatch that he was unrepentant about leg theory, adding: [...] "I doubt if I shall ever play against [...] again, at least in big cricket". Larwood's Test career thus ended. In its review of the 1934 season, Wisden commented: [...] "No greater disservice was ever done to English cricket than when Larwood was induced to dash into print and become responsible for statements which put him <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>pale</b> of being selected for England".|$|E

500|$|The {{newspaper}} {{has been}} accused from time-to-time of forcing public figures out of the closet. This policy of 'outing' individuals surfaced in 1996 during {{the debate over the}} Defense of Marriage Act, when the Blade and The Advocate were going to out Congressmen Jim Kolbe and Mark Foley. Neither publication did out either politician, and both publications later denied ever intending to out the Congressmen. In recent years, these accusations have resurfaced as Kevin Naff, current editor of the Blade, has accused the Washington Post of 'straight-washing' stories about LGBT individuals. Naff wrote that [...] "When someone is described as 'flamboyant,' 'eccentric' or 'a lifelong bachelor,' we know what’s being implied... Readers of the Washington Post had better hone their gaydar skills, because in story after story, the newsgathering behemoth either ignores questions of sexual orientation or employs endless winks and nods to convey what would be better spelled out." [...] When asked why identifying and outing of individuals by publications like the Blade, staff writer Greg Marzullo wrote [...] "Why do [...] insist on mentioning someone's sexual orientation at all? Because we're a queer paper." [...] As reported in the Washington Post, former editor Chris Crain summarized the Blades editorial reasoning for the 'outings' by stating that [...] "It is 2004, not 1954, and sexual orientation in and of itself is no longer a 'private fact' <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>pale</b> of inquiry." [...] The Blade, he wrote, [...] "would investigate and report about whether influential Hill aides are gay if facts about their sexual orientation raise highly newsworthy questions of hypocrisy in the stands taken by anti-gay members of Congress for whom they work." [...] A former staff writer of the Washington Blade has noted objections to this perceived campaign to label individuals by their sexual orientations and has used a blog to register these objections.|$|E
