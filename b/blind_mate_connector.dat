5000|$|A <b>blind</b> <b>mate</b> <b>connector</b> is {{differentiated}} {{from other}} types of connectors by the mating action that happens via a sliding or snapping action which can be accomplished without wrenches or other tools. [...] They have self-aligning features which allows a small misalignment when mating.|$|E
5000|$|Optical signals {{can also}} be {{connected}} using <b>blind</b> <b>mate</b> <b>connectors</b> providing the capability to link fibre optics on a plug-in card to an optical backplane, or through an optical midplane ...|$|R
50|$|Electrical <b>blind</b> <b>mate</b> <b>connectors</b> provide {{power or}} signal and are {{distinguished}} from other connectors {{in that they}} do not feature a rigid mechanical retention mechanism belonging to the interface itself, such as a threaded coupling nut on an SMA connector. They are typically used in a multi-pin arrangement between racks and panels, daughtercard to backplane, or similar applications where the <b>connector</b> is not <b>mated</b> by itself, but rather by the action of inserting the entire unit or module.|$|R
5000|$|Certain {{styles of}} <b>blind</b> <b>mate</b> RF <b>connectors</b> feature a detent or {{undercut}} {{to allow for}} the <b>mating</b> <b>connector</b> to snap into, improving retention. These styles are typically used when the mate is a cable connector and might see a significant force that would normally demate the connection.|$|R
50|$|<b>Blind</b> <b>mate</b> RF <b>connectors</b> are {{generally}} {{intended to be}} used without wrenches or other tools, but can come packaged in a multiport configuration that includes mounting hardware or provided as inserts in a circular connector such as a MIL-DTL-38999. Some examples of <b>blind</b> <b>mate</b> RF interfaces include BMA (OSP), BMMA (OSSP), SMP, and SMPM.|$|R
40|$|Damage to {{connectors}} {{reduced and}} special tools not needed. Clockwise rotation of screw tightens wedges against mounting body and right heat sink. Counterclockwise rotation of screw drives bottom wedge downward and jacking ring upward, pulling pins away from <b>mating</b> <b>connector.</b> Screw in mechanism turned to produce jacking force that disengages board from <b>mating</b> <b>connector.</b> Force parallel to connector pins do not bend or brake. When disengaged, board protrudes from assembly and readily grasped by operator...|$|R
50|$|In less {{critical}} applications, {{where the}} electrical {{length of the}} <b>mated</b> <b>connector</b> pair is short compared to the wavelength of the highest frequency transmitted, such mismatch can usually be ignored.|$|R
5000|$|Interfacial Seal is an {{elastomeric}} seal for <b>mated</b> <b>connectors</b> {{and their}} individual contacts. [...] "Cork & bottle" [...] seals feature a raised shoulder around each pin contact that compresses into a corresponding {{hole on the}} socket contact insulator.|$|R

50|$|In 2013, U.S. Navy {{surveillance}} experts upgraded the G-BOSS {{system with}} DC-DC converters for power generation, having awarded Vicor Corporation {{a contract to}} improve the power systems. This upgrade package will include a 24-volt DC power electronics devices with 48-, 12-, and 9-volt DC outputs, 24-volt DC converters with 19.5-, 12-, and 48-volt DC outputs, and input <b>mating</b> <b>connector</b> kits.|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} {{deleterious}} mechanically induced modulation is speckle noise created in a multimode fiber by an imperfect splice or imperfectly <b>mated</b> <b>connectors.</b> Mechanical disturbance of the fiber {{ahead of the}} joint will introduce changes in the modal structure, resulting in variations of joint loss. This is a subset of many mechanisms {{that can lead to}} modal noise in an optical system.|$|R
40|$|A {{hydraulic}} {{tool for}} safely separating one multipin electrical connector from another is presented. The separation tool {{consists of a}} master cylinder which operates a pair of slave cylinders. Each slave cylinder has a corresponding operative shaft and an extraction tab. The slave cylinders are spaced apart from one another {{so that they may}} be positioned on either side of <b>mated</b> <b>connector</b> pairs of different sizes and so that their extraction tabs may be slid between the connectors. When the master cylinder's plunger is operated, its operation is hydraulically transmitted to the operative shafts of the slave cylinders which extend outward and, once pressed against a substrate, causes the slave cylinders and corresponding extractor tabs to move away and separate one connector from the other. A second preferred separation tool includes an additional pair of extractor tabs, one {{at the end of each}} operative shaft, so that the tool can be used to separate a <b>mated</b> <b>connector</b> pair hanging in free space...|$|R

5000|$|Eurocard is a European {{standard}} format for PCB cards {{that can be}} plugged together into a standardized subrack. The subrack consists {{of a series of}} slotted card guides on the top and bottom, into which the cards are slid so they stand on end, like books on a shelf. At the [...] "back" [...] of each card is one or more connectors, which plug into <b>mating</b> <b>connectors</b> on a backplane that closes the rear of the subrack.|$|R
50|$|MIL-DTL-38999 (formerly MIL-C-38999) {{describes}} four {{series of}} miniature, high density, bayonet, threaded, or breech coupling, circular, environment resistant, electrical connectors using removable crimp or fixed solder contacts, and {{are capable of}} operation within a temperature range of -65 to +200 degrees Celsius. The connectors are intended for use as follows: (i) Series I connectors are used where a quick disconnect coupling system is required for <b>blind</b> <b>mating</b> or other mating problem areas, and these connectors provide high-vibration characteristics and are suitable for severe wind and moisture problem (SWAMP) areas with proper connector accessories; (ii) Series II connectors are used where the connector is not subjected to high vibration or SWAMP areas and where space or weight is at a premium due to their lower profile; (iii) Series III connectors are suitable for <b>blind</b> <b>mating</b> areas, and provide high-vibration characteristics at elevated temperature and are suitable for SWAMP areas with the proper connector accessories; and (iv) Series IV connectors are used where a quick disconnect coupling system is required for <b>blind</b> <b>mating</b> or other mating problem areas, and these connectors provide high-vibration characteristics and are suitable for SWAMP areas with the proper connector accessories. These connectors are lightweight, and are all scoop proof {{with the exception of}} series II which are non-scoop-proof. The insert arrangements are provided in MIL-STD-1560.|$|R

Sensing and control systems include vision, force, and torque subsystems. Enhances safety by {{making it possible to}} couple and uncouple umbilical plates quickly, without exposing human technicians to hazards of leaking fuels and oxidizers. Significantly reduces time spent to manually connect umbilicals.

50|$|Screw {{terminals}} {{are low in}} cost {{when compared}} to other types of connectors, and can be readily designed into products for circuits carrying currents of from a fraction of an ampere up to several hundred amperes at low to moderate frequencies. The terminals easily can be re-used in the field, allowing for the replacement of wires or equipment, generally with standard hand tools. Screw terminals usually avoid the requirement for a specialized <b>mating</b> <b>connector</b> to be applied to the ends of wires.|$|R
50|$|The <b>mating</b> Hirose <b>connector</b> on an {{expansion}} board is the “receptacle” connector {{and is available}} in three different heights (1.5 mm, 2.0 mm, 3.0 mm).|$|R
5000|$|In {{electrical}} and mechanical trades and manufacturing, each {{half of a}} pair of <b>mating</b> <b>connectors</b> or fasteners is conventionally assigned the designation male or female. The [...] "female" [...] connector is generally a receptacle that receives and holds the [...] "male" [...] connector. On occasion, the terms [...] "male" [...] and [...] "female" [...] are respectively referred to as the A and B ends, though the names of some standards conflict with this as they contain the letters A or B within the name.|$|R
50|$|The {{physical}} {{design of}} D-sub connectors is ill-suited for consumer plug-and-play applications. Thin metal pins, especially in higher-density connectors, are easily bent or broken, particularly if frequently plugged in by touch behind equipment. The need to tighten screws for a secure connection is cumbersome. There {{is a high}} risk of shorting the male pins with the <b>mating</b> <b>connector's</b> surrounding lip as well. Although ESD- and EMI-resistant D-sub connectors exist, the fundamental design was never intended to protect from electrostatic discharge or electromagnetic interference or facilitate very high frequency interconnections.|$|R
5000|$|SAE J1772 (IEC Type 1) is a North American {{standard}} for electrical connectors for electric vehicles {{maintained by the}} SAE International and has the formal title [...] "SAE Surface Vehicle Recommended Practice J1772, SAE Electric Vehicle Conductive Charge Coupler". It covers the general physical, electrical, communication protocol, and performance requirements for the electric vehicle conductive charge system and coupler. The intent is to define a common electric vehicle conductive charging system architecture including operational requirements and the functional and dimensional requirements for the vehicle inlet and <b>mating</b> <b>connector.</b>|$|R

The modules and hubs are fastened together in a trianglar configuration in three dimensions. The interconnections include a pair of opposed, axially aligned, flanged ports, and a clamp latch formed from a plurality of sections hinged along their length and extending circumferentially around the flanged ports. A utilities connection channel extends between ports. The channel has a shell with utilities connectors movable between an extended position to <b>mating</b> <b>connectors</b> in the modules and a withdrawn position.

50|$|The {{earliest}} tubes, {{like the}} Deforest Spherical Audion from c. 1911, used the typical light bulb Edison socket for the heater, and flying leads {{for the other}} elements. Other tubes directly used flying leads for all of their contacts, like the Cunningham AudioTron from 1915, or the Deforest Oscillion. Type C6A xenon thyratrons, used in servos for the U.S. Navy Stable Element Mark 6, had a mogul screw base and L-shaped stiff wires at the top for grid and anode connections. <b>Mating</b> <b>connectors</b> were machined pairs of brass blocks with clamping screws, attached to flying leads (free hanging).|$|R
50|$|The term {{jackscrew}} is {{also used}} for the captive screws that draw the two parts of D-subminiature electrical connectors together and hold them mated. When unscrewed, they allow the connector halves to be taken apart. These small jackscrews may have ordinary screw heads or extended heads (also making them thumbscrews) that allow the user's fingers to turn the jackscrew. Furthermore, the head sometimes has an internal female thread, with the male externally threaded screw shaft extending from that. The threaded-head type {{can be used to}} panel-mount one connector and provide a means to attach the <b>mating</b> <b>connector</b> to the first connector.|$|R
5000|$|Special [...] "octal" [...] {{connectors}} {{with either}} 8 or 11 pins, {{almost identical to}} octal relay sockets or tube sockets, were used to connect power supplies to some tube audio amplifiers, transmitters and tranceivers (especially in amateur radio models). Female sockets were installed on the power supply and male sockets (with exposed pins) on the radio equipment. Cable assemblies with <b>mating</b> <b>connectors</b> were also readily available. These connections transferred anode positive voltage (typically 600 VDC for Heathkit, 800 VDC for Collins), grid negative bias (-130 VDC), 6.3 and 12.6 VAC for heaters (filaments), and control functions (remote mains switching).|$|R
40|$|Humans {{are able}} to pump gas into a car {{with little or no}} difficulty. This task is {{characterized}} by two sources of force: that from the nozzle contacting the car and that from the hose attached to the pump. The task succeeds due to the appreciable skill of a human and a forgiveness in the connection. The robotic <b>mating</b> of <b>connectors</b> burdened by forces from sources like the gas hose is beyond the current state of art. The research presented in this dissertation develops technology for robots to <b>mate</b> <b>connectors</b> that concurrently experience appreciable forces from encumbrances, like those from hoses, cables and oscillating masses, in addition to forces from contact. Effective force guided assembly under the influence of these bias forces, requires the differentiation of contact forces from bias forces, a task that is impossible using traditional sensing configurations. Emulating the contribution of bias during contact allows the estimation of bias forces and, subsequently, contact forces. By measuring and modeling bias prior to contact, when the only forces on the connector are from bias, a model of th...|$|R
5000|$|Visually {{inspect the}} {{connectors}} for any {{problems such as}} bent pins or parts which are obviously off-centre. These should be thrown away, as <b>mating</b> damaged <b>connectors</b> with good connectors will often result in damaging the good connector.|$|R
50|$|The {{processor}} in the ECU is an Intel AN87C196KD {{running at}} 12 MHz and featuring 8KB of on-chip ROM for storage of code and data and 232 bytes of general-purpose RAM. The main connector is a 36-pin TE Connectivity 344108 ("Econoseal"), and its <b>mating</b> <b>connector</b> (used in the wiring harness) is a TE Connectivity 344111. On {{earlier versions of}} the system, a MAP sensor was internal to the ECU, requiring that an inlet manifold vacuum line be run to the ECU enclosure. In MEMS 1.6, this MAP sensor is the Motorola 5141550T02, and the vacuum line feeding it passes through a vapor trap to prevent admission of fuel vapor into the ECU.|$|R

50|$|The {{design of}} a SELV circuit {{typically}} involves an isolating transformer, guaranteed minimum distances between conductors and electrical insulation barriers. The electrical connectors of SELV circuits should be designed such {{that they do not}} <b>mate</b> with <b>connectors</b> commonly used for non-SELV circuits.|$|R
5|$|In all USB connectors, the {{construction}} always {{ensures that the}} external sheath on the plug makes contact with its counterpart in the receptacle before {{any of the four}} connectors within make electrical contact. The external metallic sheath is typically connected to system ground, thus dissipating damaging static charges. This enclosure design also provides a degree of protection from electromagnetic interference to the USB signal while it travels through the <b>mated</b> <b>connector</b> pair (the only location when the otherwise twisted data pair travels in parallel). In addition, because of the required sizes of the power and common connections, they are made after the system ground but before the data connections. This type of staged make-break timing allows for electrically safe hot-swapping.|$|R
5000|$|An M.2 module is {{installed}} into a <b>mating</b> <b>connector</b> {{provided by the}} host's circuit board, and a single mounting screw secures the module into place. Components may be mounted {{on either side of}} the module, with the actual module type limiting how thick the components can be; the maximum allowable thickness of components is 1.5 mm per side. Different host-side connectors are used for single- and double-sided M.2 modules, providing different amounts of space between the M.2 expansion card and the host's PCB. [...] Circuit boards on the hosts are usually designed to accept multiple lengths of M.2 modules, which means that the sockets capable of accepting longer M.2 modules usually also accept shorter ones by providing different positions for the mounting screw.|$|R
