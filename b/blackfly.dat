5|$|The {{black bean}} aphid (Aphis fabae) {{is a small}} black insect in the Aphis genus, with a broad, soft body, {{a member of the}} order Hemiptera. Other common names include <b>blackfly,</b> bean aphid and beet leaf aphid. In the warmer months of the year it is found in large numbers on the undersides of leaves and on the growing tips of host plants, {{including}} various agricultural crops and many wild and ornamental plants. Both winged and wingless forms exist and at this time of year, they are all females. They suck sap from stems and leaves and cause distortion of the shoots, stunted plants, reduced yield and spoiled crops. This aphid also acts as a vector for viruses that cause plant disease and the honeydew it secretes may encourage the growth of sooty mould. It breeds profusely by live birth but its numbers are kept in check, especially in the later part of the summer, by various predatory and parasitic insects. Ants feed on the honeydew it produces and take active steps to remove the aphid's enemies. It is a widely distributed pest of agricultural crops and can be controlled by chemical or biological means. In the autumn, winged forms move to different host plants where both males and females are produced. These mate and the females lay eggs which overwinter.|$|E
25|$|An adelpho-{{parasite}} (from Greek αδελφός (adelphos), brother) is {{a parasite}} {{in which the}} host species {{is closely related to}} the parasite, often {{being a member of the}} same family or genus. An example of this is the citrus <b>blackfly</b> parasitoid, Encarsia perplexa, unmated females of which may lay haploid eggs in the fully developed larvae of their own species. These result in the production of male offspring. The marine worm Bonellia viridis has a similar reproductive strategy, although the larvae are planktonic.|$|E

40|$|Larvae, pupae, {{and adult}} <b>blackflies</b> (Simuliidae) {{are capable of}} {{harbouring}} several groups of nematodes. Multiple parasitism involving nematodes of the same or different species, or various developmental stages of the same nematode may also occur. Thus, <b>blackflies</b> can serve as paratenic, intermediate, or definitive hosts of nematodes. The present study reviews the literature pertaining to the association between nematodes and Simuliidae and provides a key to various groups of nematodes found in <b>blackflies.</b> Emphasis {{is placed on the}} commoner filarial and mermithid nematodes, but several other unusual and rare roundworm parasites are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND Genetic {{surveillance}} {{of the human}} filarial parasite, Onchocerca volvulus, from onchocerciasis endemic regions will ideally focus on genotyping individual infective larval stages collected from their intermediate host, Simuliid <b>blackflies.</b> However, <b>blackflies</b> also transmit other Onchocerca species, including the cattle parasite O. ochengi, which are difficult to distinguish from the human parasite based on morphological characteristics alone. This study describes a versatile approach to discriminate between O. volvulus and O. ochengi that is demonstrated using parasite infective larvae dissected from <b>blackflies.</b> RESULTS A speciation assay was designed based on genetic differentiation between O. volvulus and O. ochengi mitochondrial genome sequences that can be performed in high-throughput high-resolution melt (HRM) - or lower throughput conventional {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (RFLP) analyses. This assay was validated on 185 Onchocerca larvae dissected from <b>blackflies</b> captured from 14 communities in Ghana throughout 2011 - 2013.

2500|$|Generally, {{the cherry}} {{can be a}} {{difficult}} fruit tree to grow and keep alive. [...] In Europe, the first visible pest in the growing season soon after blossom (in April in western Europe) usually is the black cherry aphid ("cherry blackfly", Myzus cerasi), which causes leaves at the tips of branches to curl, with the <b>blackfly</b> colonies exuding a sticky secretion which promotes fungal growth on the leaves and fruit. At the fruiting stage in June/July (Europe), the cherry fruit fly (Rhagoletis cingulata and Rhagoletis cerasi) lays its eggs in the immature fruit, whereafter its larvae feed on the cherry flesh and exit through a small hole (about 1 mm diameter), {{which in turn is}} the entry point for fungal infection of the cherry fruit after rainfall. In addition, cherry trees are susceptible to bacterial canker, cytospora canker, brown rot of the fruit, root rot from overly wet soil, crown rot, and several viruses.|$|E

40|$|A suspended-net {{technique}} {{was used to}} capture <b>blackflies</b> attracted to and engorging on Dorper and Merino sheep on irrigated pastures. Two bait animals of each breed were restrained individually in wire-mesh enclosures located within four larger pens, each containing nine more animals of the same breed. Nets were suspended partly over the restrained animals and <b>blackflies</b> were collected {{at the end of}} 2 -hour or longer periods. Mean numbers of <b>blackflies</b> captured in association with Merino (73, 3 /h) and Dorper sheep (89, 1 /h) did not differ significantly. Numbers of captured <b>blackflies</b> correlated (rho = 0, 8361) with levels of irritation shown by sheep. Engorgement on Merinos was significantly (p = 0, 009) higher than on Dorpers. Percentage engorgement was low, mostly below 10 % on Merinos and below 5 % on Dorpers. When high wind speeds and high saturation deficits (associated with temperatures in the mid-thirties) occurred, the success of capture was impaired. The technique is useful for quantifying the abundance of irritating <b>blackflies</b> in the immediate proximity of smallstock under experimental conditions.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the MosqTent® trap was evaluated in endemic area to onchocerciasis in Brazil. This study seeks to provide subsidies for the monitoring of the onchocerciasis transmission in the country. The study was carried out at the Homoxi and Thirei villages, located in the Yanomami Indigenous Land, {{in the state of}} Roraima. This area presents hyperendemicity, high <b>blackflies</b> densities, large population migrations and mining activities. The Homoxi and Thirei villages are assisted by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. To conduct the present study, the village leader, health leaders and the Brazilian Ethics Committee were consulted. <b>Blackflies</b> captures were carried out simultaneously at the Homoxi and Thirei, using systematized methods to allow for comparisons between the traditional Human Landing Catch (HLC) and HLC protected by the MosqTent®. The female <b>blackflies</b> were captured at two equidistant capture stations per locality, by two collectors per station, for five consecutive days. Individuals captured by interval/station/day were counted, identified and maintained at - 20 °C. The underlying probability distributions and the differences between the methods for the independent sample data were verified in a comparative statistical analysis between the use of the MosqTent® and the HLC. A total of 10, 855 antropophilic <b>blackflies</b> were captured by both methodologies. A total of 7, 367 (67. 87 %) <b>blackflies</b> belonging to seven species were captured by MosqTent® -Simulium incrustatum s. l (99. 06 %); S. guianense s. l (0. 74 %), S. oyapockense s. l (0. 01 %), S. exiguum (0. 10 %), S. metallicum (0. 05 %), S. ochraceum (0. 03 %) and S. minusculum s. l (0. 01 %). Moreover, 3, 488 (32. 14 %) <b>blackflies</b> belonging to four species were captured by HLC-S. incrustatum s. l (98. 33 %); S. guianense s. l (1. 38 %), S. oyapockense s. l (0. 26 %) and S. metallicum (0. 03 %). The MosqTent® was more effective and efficient when compared to HLC. When comparing total <b>blackflies</b> captured/day, the MosqTent® was more efficient than HLC (p = 0. 031) with a means of 799. 4 blackflies/day versus 217. 6 blackflies/day by HLC.

40|$|Detection of Onchocerca volvulus in Simulium populations is {{of primary}} {{importance}} {{in the assessment of}} the effectiveness of onchocerciasis control programs. In Brazil, the main focus of onchocerciasis is in the Amazon region, in a Yanomami reserve. The main onchocerciasis control strategy in Brazil is the semi-annually mass distribution of the microfilaricide ivermectin. In accordance with the control strategy for the disease, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was applied in pools of simuliids from the area to detect the helminth infection in the vectors, as recommended by the Onchocerciasis Elimination Program for the Americas and the World Health Organization. Systematic sampling was performed monthly from September 1998 to October 1999, and a total of 4942 <b>blackflies</b> were collected from two sites (2576 from Balawaú and 2366 from Toototobi). The molecular methodology was found to be highly sensitive and specific for the detection of infected and/or infective <b>blackflies</b> in pools of 50 <b>blackflies.</b> The results from the material collected under field conditions showed that after the sixth cycle of distribution of ivermectin, the prevalence of infected <b>blackflies</b> with O. volvulus had decreased from 8. 6 to 0. 3 % in Balawaú and from 4 to 0. 1 % in Toototobi...|$|R
