30|$|It is {{well known}} that the Jackson and <b>Bernstein</b> <b>inequalities</b> reflect {{relations}} between quality and size of the approximation for a certain pair spaces [1], p. 201, and they are used to characterize the approximation spaces by means of the interpolation spaces [1], p. 235, Theorem  9.1. While the <b>Bernstein</b> <b>inequality</b> has a variety of applications in approximation theory, it is usually used to prove the inverse theorems. Wavelet decomposition into this area has shown how wavelets convey their contribution across various types. In 1993 an article [2] about <b>Bernstein</b> <b>inequality</b> was publish by Jia that {{has been the subject of}} much discussion ever since. References [3 – 5] seem to agree with [2], although no further improvement has been made. As shown in the above, the existing research as regards the <b>Bernstein</b> <b>inequality</b> has emphasized the necessity of smoothness, and it ignored the feasibility of decay (only-) based approaches. Hence, in order to help fill this gap in our knowledge, we establish the feasibility of decay-based approaches to the <b>Bernstein</b> <b>inequality.</b> The aim has been accomplished by means of completeness of wavelet bi-frames in Lebesgue spaces and stability of wavelet coefficients.|$|R

40|$|In {{approximation}} theory, three classical {{types of}} results are direct theorems, <b>Bernstein</b> <b>inequalities,</b> and inverse theorems. In this paper, we include results about radial basis function (RBF) approximation {{from all three}} classes. <b>Bernstein</b> <b>inequalities</b> are a recent development {{in the theory of}} RBF approximation, and on Rd, only L 2 results are known for RBFs with algebraically decaying Fourier transforms (e. g. the Sobolev splines and thin-plate splines). We will therefore extend what is known by establishing Lp <b>Bernstein</b> <b>inequalities</b> for RBF networks on Rd. These inequalities involve bounding a Bessel-potential norm of an RBF network by its corresponding Lp norm in terms of the separation radius associated with the network. While <b>Bernstein</b> <b>inequalities</b> have a variety of applications in approximation theory, they are most commonly used to prove inverse theorems. Therefore, using the Lp <b>Bernstein</b> <b>inequalities</b> for RBF approximants, we will establish the corresponding inverse theorems. The direct theorems of this paper relate to approximation in Lp(Rd) by RBFs which are perturbations of Green's functions. Results of this type are known for certain compact domains, and results have recently been derived for approximation in Lp(Rd) by RBFs that are Green's functions. Therefore, we will prove that known results for approximation in Lp(Rd) hold for a larger class of RBFs. We will then show how this result can be used to derive rates for approximation by Wendland functions...|$|R

40|$|It is {{now well}} known that sparse or {{compressible}} vectors can be stably recovered from their low-dimensional projection, provided the projection matrix satisfies a Restricted Isometry Property (RIP). We establish new implications of the RIP with respect to nonlinear approximation in a Hilbert space with a redundant frame. The main ingredients of our approach are: a) Jackson and <b>Bernstein</b> <b>inequalities,</b> associated to the characterization of certain approximation spaces with interpolation spaces; b) a new proof that for overcomplete frames which satisfy a <b>Bernstein</b> <b>inequality,</b> these interpolation spaces are nothing but the collection of vectors admitting a representation in the dictionary with compressible coefficients; c) the proof that the RIP implies <b>Bernstein</b> <b>inequalities.</b> As a result, we obtain that in most overcomplete random Gaussian dictionaries with fixed aspect ratio, just as in any orthonormal basis, the error of best $m$-term approximation of a vector decays at a certain rate if, and only if, the vector admits a compressible expansion in the dictionary. Yet, for mildly overcomplete dictionaries with a one-dimensional kernel, we give examples where the <b>Bernstein</b> <b>inequality</b> holds, but the same inequality fails for even the smallest perturbation of the dictionary.

30|$|<b>Bernstein</b> <b>inequality</b> is an {{essential}} inequality for Besov spaces. Smoothness based approaches are widely used in establishing the inequality. Yet, despite numerous studies {{over the last two}} decades, there is still little research focusing on decay-based approaches. However, motivating authors to establish inequality poses challenges, many of which can be overcome by means of the completeness of wavelet bi-frames in Lebesgue spaces and the stability of wavelet coefficients.

In addition, {{it is based on}} a rather direct argument using two applications of the same (non-empirical) <b>Bernstein</b> <b>inequality</b> for U-statistics. We discuss potential applications of our new inequalities, especially in the realm of learning ranking/scoring functions. In the process, we exhibit an efficient procedure to compute the variance estimates for the special case of bipartite ranking that rests on a sorting argument. We also argue that our results may provide test set bounds and particularly interesting empirical racing algorithms for the problem of online learning of scoring functions. ...|$|R
