25|$|In general relativity, {{something}} somewhat analogous happens, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the Ricci tensor which vanishes in any {{vacuum region}} (but {{not in a}} region which is matter-free but contains an electromagnetic field), {{and it is the}} Weyl curvature which is generated (via another first order covariant differential equation) by variations in the stress–energy tensor and which then propagates into vacuum regions, rendering gravitation a long-range force capable of propagating through a vacuum.|$|E
500|$|A four-story Major Block 1 building, {{designed}} by T. V. Widskier, sat on this location until the Great Chicago Fire. [...] After the fire, this {{was replaced with}} the Major Block 2, which eventually {{became known as the}} Roanoke Building. [...] Major Block 2 stood from 1872–1912 as a seven-story building on spread foundations. [...] It was {{designed by}} Dixon & Hamilton and had a length of [...] along South LaSalle Street and a width of [...] along West Madison Street. [...] A commonly published illustration of this building shows it as a five-story building. From June 8, 1873 to January 1, 1887 the original Roanoke building served as the Chicago location for the National Weather Service Weather Forecast official climate site. The building is mentioned in Saul Bellow's More Die of Heartbreak <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> referred to as a wealthy residence building and not as an office building.|$|E
25|$|<b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not a surprise, because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{predicted}} by Onsager.|$|R
60|$|During lunch he had {{the misfortune}} to upset a glass of water. Pure accident, of course, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> don't you know, all over the table.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Mulville stared. [...] "Oh I suppose Mr. Anvoy has {{scarcely}} gone bankrupt--or {{whatever he}} has done--on purpose. Very likely they won't {{be able to}} keep <b>it</b> up, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a very beautiful impulse." ...|$|R
6000|$|L. Even if it be not, it {{cannot be}} {{anywhere}} else <b>but</b> <b>there.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> not the crystalline lens {{of your eyes}} which is sorry, when you cry? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a pity," [...] he said. [...] "A great pity, {{especially}} as I gather, Sir James, that {{the matter is}} important. <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> she can tell you nothing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "These are my night's work. The bar {{is the top}} one of the grate. I had a job {{to loosen}} it, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> The pegs I whittled out of that log." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> monstrous and incredible, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> <b>There</b> was {{no getting}} round <b>it.</b> The man <b>was</b> <b>there</b> talking when {{he ought to}} have been dead. We all sat staring in amazement, but United States Marshal Carpenter was not a man to be euchred so easily. He motioned the others to one side, so that the {{prisoner}} was left standing alone.|$|R
6000|$|How Blunt had {{got enough}} {{information}} to base that atrocious calumny upon, Monsieur George couldn’t imagine. <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> He kept silent in his indignation till his friend murmured, “I expect you will {{want him to know}} that you are here.” ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> several evenings {{after this}} that David Grief, {{lounging}} under the after deck awning of the Kittiwake and idly scanning the meagre columns of the Papeete Avant-Coureur, sat suddenly up and almost rubbed his eyes. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> unbelievable, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> The old South Seas Romance was not dead. He read: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's ridiculous that {{we should}} be ruined for two {{thousand}} pounds; <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> <b>is!</b> If I try to borrow from my friends, I must tell why I need the money. And I don't know who would lend." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear, I fully {{intended}} going. <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> man proposes and-- ahem--I stayed {{talking with}} a friend until it was past the time. Most unfortunate!" [...] and finishing with a little inconsequent chuckle, {{he opened the door}} for them to enter.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not the military. We do the fighting, and get fairly {{paid for}} it. The civilians get {{five times as}} highly paid, and run no risks whatever. Why it should be so {{no one has ever}} {{attempted}} to explain; <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> sister." ...|$|E
60|$|And all in {{a minute}} a hare made a leap out from between his hands, and whether <b>it</b> <b>was</b> one of the cards that took that shape, or whether <b>it</b> <b>was</b> made out of nothing in the palms of his hands, nobody knew, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> running {{on the floor of}} the barn, as quick as any hare that ever lived.|$|R
60|$|Such {{an obvious}} {{explanation}} involved {{the death of}} any illusions I might still cherish about this Arab lady, Ayesha, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> true that I parted with them with regret, as we all do when {{we think we have}} discovered something wonderful in the female line. <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> and to bother any more about her, her history and aims, seemed useless.|$|R
5000|$|Due to his {{connections}} with S.I., González started working for Warren Publishing in 1971. Jim Warren described {{his reaction to}} seeing González's art in The Warren Companion: The minute I {{took one look at}} Pepe González's artwork, I knew we had it! We survived 12 issues <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> This is what I wanted for the first issue but couldn't put together.|$|R
6000|$|L. Neith's, I believe; {{though not}} built for Asychis. I know {{only that it}} is a little rosy {{transparent}} pyramid, built of more courses of bricks than I can count, it being made so small. You don't believe me, of course, Egyptian infidel; <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> (Giving crystal of rose Fluor.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your Press, for one thing," [...] Selingman replied; [...] "your Press, {{written for}} and {{inspired}} {{with the whole}} spirit of the bourgeoisie. You prate about your Empire, but you've never learnt yet to think imperially. <b>But</b> <b>there,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not for this I crossed the Channel. It is to be with Maraton." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are, quite right," [...] Tavernake confessed, shortly. [...] "I know I was a fool--a fool! If I {{could think}} of any {{adjective}} that would meet the case, I'd use it, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> I chucked things and I came here. You haven't come down to tell me your opinion of me, I suppose?" ...|$|E
60|$|Ben and Dickey {{had worked}} faithfully, and {{performed}} {{all that had}} been given them to do. The curtain was hung, a little awkwardly, to be sure, {{on account of the}} uneven manner in which the stage <b>was</b> built; <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> whether straight or crooked, where all the beauty of its many-colored illustrations could be seen if the candles were held near enough to it.|$|R
60|$|Leaving the bilious and {{mathematical}} exactitude, the preposterous peace of that backwater, he thought suddenly: 'During coverture! Why can't they exclude fellows like Profond, {{instead of a}} lot of hard-working Germans?' and was surprised at the depth of uneasiness which could provoke so unpatriotic a thought. <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> <b>was!</b> One never got a moment of real peace. Always something at the back of everything! And he made his way towards Green Street.|$|R
60|$|The {{freckled}} girl {{went out}} and {{stood for a moment}} {{at the head of the}} stairs. When she came back she looked very hard at her friend. The incident struck her as important--wonderfully important. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> unassimilable, of course, and absurd, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> the thing that is so cardinal to a girl, the emotion, the subservience, the crowning triumph of her sex. She could not help feeling that Helen took it, on the whole, a little too hardly.|$|R
6000|$|... "The same. You see the fellow's well protected. It's a {{piece of}} news I {{gathered}} in St. Nicholas. I {{am not sure that}} I welcome it, for I am not sure that it makes any easier a task upon which my kinsman, Lord Sunderland, has sent me hither. <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> You didn't know?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She stood panting {{a little}} in the darkness, {{listening}} to some cautious yet uneasy thought that seemed to haunt her mind. 'I thought--it seemed there was something we had not said, something I could not understand. <b>But</b> <b>there,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> nothing! You know what a fanciful old silly I am. You do love me? Quite as much as ever?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, spying, if you like; <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> And {{now to the}} point--I am {{not going}} on {{supplying}} you with money at this rate. I cannot do it and I will not do it. I am {{going to give you}} two hundred and fifty pounds now, and as much every year, and not one farthing more." ...|$|E
60|$|The Roman {{taking of}} the census was an abomination. Yet <b>it</b> had to <b>be</b> done, for <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the basis of taxation. <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> again. Taxation by the State was a crime against their law and God. Oh, that Law! <b>It</b> <b>was</b> not the Roman law. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> their law, what they called God's law. There were the zealots, who murdered anybody who broke this law. And for a procurator to punish a zealot caught red-handed was to raise a riot or an insurrection.|$|R
6000|$|Hurriedly {{depositing}} his hat, {{he ran to}} Cecilia. He still {{preserved the}} habit of knocking on her door before he entered, though she had never, so far, answered, [...] "Don't come in!" [...] because she knew his knock. The custom gave, in fact, the measure of his idealism. What he feared, or what he thought he feared, after nineteen years of unchecked entrance, could never have <b>been</b> ascertained; <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> that flower of something formal and precise, of something reticent, within his soul.|$|R
60|$|The esquimo returns {{after five}} minutes, however. There is a bedroom in the house. He is pleased, because he didn't like putting {{us into the}} bagnio. Where he found the bedroom I don't know. <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> large, sombre, cold, and over the kitchen fumes of a small inner court like a well. But {{perfectly}} clean and all right. And the people seemed warm and good-natured, like human beings. One has got so used to the non-human ancient-souled Sicilians, who are suave and so completely callous.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{would make}} me angry if I were on my death-bed," [...] he said, [...] "that is, when you talk like that. <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> I cannot change you, so let us change the subject. Have you any of that poison to spare? If so, you might serve us out a little; we may want it before the evening is over." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{been all}} 'balled up' since you went away," [...] he explained--"took a {{contract}} to produce a certain line of ornamental reliefs; it never pays to be mercenary. <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> <b>is!</b> I was greedy, I went out for money--now behold me in the grasp of a business agreement. Can't sleep, can't breathe country air--had to work all day Sunday." ...|$|E
6000|$|Three {{minutes later}} Lady Meadowcroft rushed on deck and flung her arms impulsively round Hilda. [...] "You dear, good girl!" [...] she cried; [...] "how sweet {{and kind of}} you! I really COULDN'T have landed if you hadn't promised to come with us. And Dr. Cumberledge, too! So nice and {{friendly}} of you both. <b>But</b> <b>there,</b> <b>it</b> <b>IS</b> so much pleasanter to deal with ladies and gentlemen!" ...|$|E
60|$|They looked. Some {{miles from}} them, across the great plain of bush that merged {{gradually}} into swamp, lay that {{branch of the}} Zambesi which they would reach. They could not see it, indeed, for its face was hid by a dense cloak of soft white mist that covered it like a cloud. <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> won at last, and there away to the eastward shone the wide glitter of the sea, flecked with faint lines of broken billows whence the sun rose in glory.|$|R
6000|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> {{still as}} if, for an instant, Milly {{had to be}} sure of what she meant; <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> {{presently}} <b>was.</b> [...] "If she did care Mrs. Condrip would have told me." ...|$|R
60|$|Ah! <b>but</b> <b>there</b> was {{no truth}} in it--could not be. He was not afraid; {{she was really}} a good little thing. <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> when you got {{a thing like that}} into your mind. And James was of a nervous temperament--one of those men whom things will not leave alone, who suffer tortures from {{anticipation}} and indecision. For fear of letting something slip that he might otherwise secure, he was physically unable to make up his mind until absolutely certain that, by not making it up, he would suffer loss.|$|R
