5|$|Because of the {{long-term}} effects of inflation, notably the significant increase of movie theater ticket prices, the list unadjusted for inflation gives far more weight to later films. The unadjusted list, while commonly found in the press, is therefore largely meaningless for comparing films widely separated in time, as many films from earlier eras will never appear on a modern unadjusted list, despite achieving higher commercial success when adjusted for price increases. To compensate for the devaluation of the currency, some charts make adjustments for inflation, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> this practice fully addresses the issue since ticket prices and inflation do not necessarily parallel one another. For example, in 1970, tickets cost $1.55 or about $6.68 in inflation-adjusted 2004 dollars; by 1980, prices had risen to about $2.69, a drop to $5.50 in inflation-adjusted 2004 dollars. Ticket prices have also risen at different rates of inflation around the world, further complicating the process of adjusting worldwide grosses.|$|E

Krissi Murison of the NME disagreed, calling it one of [...] "the best bits of the decade of decadence" [...] and referring to it as [...] "Salt-N-Pepa's cartoon rap". Jason Shawhan of About.com stated that the song's [...] "great Narada Michael Walden bleepy synth noises [...] pop out of the mix like the car stereo just decided to sing along", and Jennifer Nine of Yahoo! Music commented that the track had [...] "icy-cool schoolyard sass". Eric Greenwood of Drawer B argued that the track [...] "carelessly revisits Stefani's blatant fondness for 80's pop, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> [...] Tony Kanal can save her from lifeless retreads like these." [...] The Washington Post reviewer Sean Daly compared it to Salt-n-Pepa's 1987 single [...] "Push It" [...] and added that Stefani [...] "pushes it real good". PopMatters's Jason Damas gave it a very strong review, stating that [...] "Stefani nails all the vocal mannerisms" [...] and that Kanal [...] "reveals a major mainstream pop jones here, especially {{in the way he}} layers the cut [...] with dozens of orchestra hits [...] which have been absent from almost all pop albums for a decade or more now." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine gave the song a mixed review, stating that it [...] "features some near-fatal car metaphors" [...] but that Stefani [...] "maintains her signature sass throughout".|$|E

If [...] is odd, then the semidirect product is in fact a direct product, and any orthogonal matrix can be produced by taking a rotation matrix and possibly negating all of its columns. This follows from the property of determinants that negating a column negates the determinant, and thus negating an odd (<b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>even)</b> number of columns negates the determinant.|$|E

2500|$|One {{consequence}} {{of this is that}} the target audience is extremely fluid: while some of his works are clearly published as children's literature (picture books, cassettes), the distinction between youth, young adult and adult literature is not easily made; traditional story-telling addresses the entire community at once. [...] The interplay of truth and fiction, always difficult concepts, is a recurring theme in Schami's writings. [...] Der ehrliche Lügner opens with the words: [...] "My name is Sadik, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> that is certain." [...] Elsewhere we are told that the important thing is not whether stories are true, but rather how we live with them (A Handful of Stars). [...] Although elements from fairy-tale worlds may appear in these stories, they are always rooted in daily life. [...] Schami has made a distinction between Illusion and Phantasie (illusion and vision). [...] Illusion is an unachievable dream, distorting the world to something impossible, whereas vision is the imaginative construction of achievable goals; rooted in reality it indicates something which can be striven for, but this reality means also accepting the other possibility, that there may not be a happy ending. [...] Asked by a radio interviewer whether literature is an escape from reality, Schami answers, yes: but one which enables the reader to return to reality better equipped.|$|E
2500|$|The French {{landscape}} and building architect, Joseph Jacques Ramée had already established {{a reputation as}} a skilled designer of landscapes combined with houses and other kinds of buildings {{by the time he was}} persuaded to visit America in search of projects. One of his projects had been the design of the estate of David Parish’s father in Hamburg, and Parish remembered this when he sought an architect to help him develop settlements on vast tracts of land in northern New York he had purchased on speculation. [...] Ramée arrived in the northern Adirondacks in late 1812 to work on projects in and around the small towns on Parish’s land. <b>But</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> the ambitious Parish could keep the famous architect busy enough to support his family, so Parish also acted as agent in finding Ramée other work. [...] So, it was natural that on a return trip to Philadelphia in January 1813, Parish should introduce Ramée to Eliphalet Nott, who was already in the college building business. Nott hired Ramée almost immediately to draw up plans for the new campus, for the fairly grand sum of $1,500 (roughly $ today). [...] Ramée worked on the drawings for about a year, and construction of two of the college buildings proceeded quickly enough to permit occupation in 1814. The Union College campus thus became the first comprehensively planned college campus in the United States.|$|E
