As a result, ways of obtaining information have greatly changed. The readership of the printed media appears to have been gradually decreasing, something that may also happen with dictionaries. It has for example been noted that three mediums for dictionaries — paper, electronic gadgets, and the Internet — are now about equally popular with students. Gone therefore are the days when paper dictionaries dominated the reference world. For example, more than 70 % of students interviewed at Hong Kong Polytechnic University claim that they use e-dictionaries more often than the traditional <b>bulky</b> <b>paper</b> products: among them, the most 'bookmarked' is the online version of the Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary.

40|$|The {{extraction}} of biomedical parameters, for early disease detection, is assuming today an ever increasing and fundamental importance. In particular, in the cardiologic field, the preejection period (PEP) is {{the duration of}} the iso-volumetric left ventricle contraction until the aortic valve opening. This parameter is a non-constant additive delay, which rapidly changes in response to stress, emotion and physical effort. To estimate this period, several wearable electronics devices have been developed in literature, and among them the Impedance Cardiogram equipment is the most used.

40|$|The current paper {{presents}} a novel methodology for calculating the rheological para-meters for dilute aqueous solutions of a power-law non-Newtonian fluid, xanthan gum (XG). Previous studies have verified the fidelity of finite-element modelling of the Navier–Stokes equations for reproducing the velocity fields of XG solutions in a microfluidic T-junction with experimental observations obtained using micron resolution particle image velocimetry (μ-PIV). As the pressure-driven fluid {{is forced to}} turn {{the corner of the}} T-junction, a range of shear rates, and therefore viscosities, are produced within the flow system. Thus, a setup that potentially establishes the rheological profile of XG from a single experiment is selected. An inverse method based on finding the mapping between the statistical moments of the velocity field and the constitutive parameters of the viscosity profile demonstrated that such a system could potentially be used for the design of an efficient microfluidic rheometer. However, μ-PIV technology is expensive and the equipment is <b>bulky.</b> The current <b>paper</b> investigates whether different flow features could be used to establish the rheological profile. ...|$|R

Users can now access them offline any time without carrying a <b>bulky</b> pBook (<b>Paper</b> Book). The stable eBook application should restrict and control the use of contents to protect the copyrights. Encryption and enforcement of digital policies are generally managed by Digital Rights Management (DRM). The stable system for online as well as offline readers safeguard the intellectual properties for authors, publishers by providing a protection to their digital content, secure eBook distribution, authentication, authorization, market involvement, and monetary transactions [1, 2, 3]. Content Piracy has always been a prime issue in managing a Library System. To safeguard against piracy, publishers need to control and track whether the user is authorized or not and up to how much extent the privileges should be provided [4]. Publishers, authors are concerned about the revenue lost over unauthorized, unpaid access to their valuable contents and efforts as well. This is an old issue with pBooks that has now come in the forefront with the introduction of online and offline eBook applications. A solution needs to be proposed to provide a good user experience and content security, and integrity for publishers. In this project, we will explore how the user restrictions and access controls can be enforced using a Content Management System (CMS). Drupal [17], Joomla [18], and WordPress [19] are few of the powerful CMSs where a developer has to integrate various modules with core modules and configure them as per the need of an organization.

40|$|Most multi-charged ion sources {{produce a}} wide {{spectrum}} of charge states, which may make it hard to obtain enough current after selecting a particular state. A newly proposed type of multi-charged ion source has several potential advantages over existing types. The basic principle is that multi-photon absorption in an intense uniform laser focus can give multiple charge states of high purity [1]. Thus, charge state separation downstream is simplified or made unnecessary. Another advantage is that currents of many amperes can be extracted if required. This type of source could be used for heavy-ion fusion drivers or storage ring injectors. There are also industrial applications such as materials processing. Previously, we modeled direct extraction from a spherically expanding laser plasma [2]. We showed that very large currents can be extracted with low ion thermal velocities but that the required focusing system was <b>bulky.</b> The present <b>paper</b> considers compact alternatives, using a conical guide field or a magnetic bucket. Large currents, as required for heavy-ion fusion, are extracted in two stages: a multiple-aperture pre-accelerator is followed by a high perveance single-aperture diode. Our scheme is designed to give low aberrations and low emittance in the combined beam. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Active {{physiological}} tremor compensation instruments {{have been}} under research and development recently. The sensing unit of the instruments provides information on three degrees-of-freedom (DOF) motion of the instrument tip using accelerations provided by accelerometers placed inside the instruments. A complete vector of angular acceleration of the instrument needs to be known to obtain information on three DOF motions of the tip. Sensing resolution of angular acceleration about the instrument axis is directly proportional to {{the width of the}} proximal-end sensing unit. To keep the sensing resolution high enough, the width of the unit has to be made large. As a result, the proximal-end sensing unit of the instruments is <b>bulky.</b> In this <b>paper,</b> placement of accelerometers is proposed such that the angular acceleration about the instrument axis need not be known to obtain information on the three DOF motions of the tip. With the proposed placement, the instrument is no longer bulky and fewer number of accelerometers is required, thereby making the instrument compact and better in terms of ergonomics and reliability. Experiments were conducted to show that the proposed design of placement works properly.
