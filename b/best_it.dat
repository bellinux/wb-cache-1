5|$|Debates ensued {{over the}} fate of the Marysvale branch line. The mines {{at the end of the}} line had long closed; the last train to {{traverse}} the entire length of the line passed through in 1970. Still, farmers and industry in the Sevier and Sanpete Valleys generated enough traffic that the line broke even most years. However, this line was severely damaged, with several washed-out bridges and railroad tracks draping over the sides of newly created cliffs. The railroad determined that at <b>best</b> <b>it</b> would take years to recover the cost of rebuilding the line.|$|E

5|$|The peak random write {{performance}} on an SSD {{is driven by}} plenty of free blocks after the SSD is completely garbage collected, secure erased, 100% TRIMed, or newly installed. The maximum speed will depend upon the number of parallel flash channels connected to the SSD controller, {{the efficiency of the}} firmware, and the speed of the flash memory in writing to a page. During this phase the write amplification will be the <b>best</b> <b>it</b> can ever be for random writes and will be approaching one. Once the blocks are all written once, garbage collection will begin and the performance will be gated by the speed and efficiency of that process. Write amplification in this phase will increase to the highest levels the drive will experience.|$|E

But over and above that, Duchamp did not select just any ready-made object to display. In selecting the urinal, his message was clear: Art is something you piss on.|$|E

25|$|The Swedish Air Force {{underwent}} a rapid modernization from 1945. It {{was no longer}} politically acceptable to equip it with second-rate models. Instead, the Air Staff purchased the <b>best</b> <b>it</b> could find from abroad, e.g. P-51D Mustangs, De Havilland Mosquito NF.19 night fighters and de Havilland Vampires, and supported the development of top performance domestic models. When the Saab 29 Tunnan fighter was introduced around 1950, Sweden suddenly had planes that were equal {{to the best of}} the Royal Air Force, the Soviet Union's VVS, and the U.S. Air Force.|$|E

Parliament was set up temporarily in the Duke of Leinster's old palace, Leinster House, where it has remained ever since. Over time, the GPO, Custom House and Four Courts were rebuilt. While major schemes were proposed for Dublin, no major remodelling took place initially.|$|E

25|$|Excessive {{intervention}} by a tribunal is {{a breach of}} the fair hearing requirement. The principle behind this rule was elucidated succinctly by Justice Yong Pung How. He stated that since Singapore's justice system is adversarial and not inquisitorial, when hearing evidence a tribunal may seek clarification on points in the evidence which are not clear, but must at all times avoid descending into the arena and joining in the fray. The tribunal is there to judge as <b>best</b> <b>it</b> can and is not there to supplement the prosecution.|$|E
25|$|Tunnels on steep {{gradients}} {{can present}} problems for air-breathing locomotives, such as steam locomotives and diesel locomotives. Poor ventilation in long or narrow tunnels can starve the locomotive of power. The solution {{is analogous to}} compensation for curvature and requires the gradient in the tunnel and for some distance on either side to be greatly reduced compared to the ruling grade. Unfortunately, the necessary compensation for gradient {{is not a simple}} equation, but is rather a trial and error process. Since one cannot build several tunnels to find out which one is <b>best,</b> <b>it</b> is useful to study existing tunnels with steep gradients.|$|E
