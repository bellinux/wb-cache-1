50|$|The thermal {{conductivity}} detector (TCD), {{also known as}} a Katharometer, is a <b>bulk</b> <b>property</b> detector and a chemical specific detector commonly used in gas chromatography. This detector senses changes in the {{thermal conductivity}} of the column effluent and compares it to a reference flow of carrier gas.

50|$|An {{intensive}} property is a <b>bulk</b> <b>property,</b> {{meaning that it}} is a physical property of a system that does not depend on the system size or the amount of material in the system. Examples of intensive properties include temperature, T, refractive index, n, density, ρ, and hardness of an object, η (IUPAC symbols are used throughout this article). When a diamond is cut, the pieces maintain their intrinsic hardness (until the sample reduces to a few atoms thick), so hardness is independent {{of the size of the}} system, for larger samples.|$|E

Several <b>bulk</b> <b>properties</b> like Young's modulus, heat capacity, thermal diffusivity and conductivity have been determined and estimations of the <b>bulk</b> <b>properties</b> at 100 % density are made. Furthermore, in spinel-type materials like zinc aluminate the process of cation inversion occurs, which is in general not {{taken into account in}} computer simulations for the prediction of <b>bulk</b> <b>properties.</b> In order to determine whether the amount of cation inversion can be influenced by the preparation method resulting in different <b>bulk</b> <b>properties,</b> zinc aluminate powders were synthesised using solid-state synthesis, co-precipitation and a sol-gel method at different temperatures.

5000|$|The basic {{principle}} of pulsed EPR {{is similar to}} NMR spectroscopy. Differences {{can be found in}} the relative size of the magnetic interactions and in the relaxation rates which are orders of magnitudes larger in EPR than NMR. A full description of the theory is given within the quantum mechanical formalism, but since the magnetization is being measured as a <b>bulk</b> <b>property,</b> a more intuitive picture can be obtained with a classical description. For a better understanding of the concept of pulsed EPR let us consider the effects on the magnetization vector in the laboratory frame as well as in the rotating frame. As the animation below shows, in the laboratory frame the static magnetic field B0 is assumed to be parallel to the z-axis and the microwave field B1 parallel to the x-axis. When an electron spin is placed in magnetic field it experiences a torque which causes its magnetic moment to precess around the magnetic field. The precession frequency is known as the Larmor frequency ωL (see page 18 of ref [...] ).|$|E
50|$|Since {{the bulk}} density of a solid {{chemical}} element is strongly related to its molar mass (usually about 3 R per mole, as noted above), there exists a noticeable inverse correlation between a solid’s density and its specific heat capacity on a per-mass basis. This {{is due to a}} very approximate tendency of atoms of most elements to be about the same size (and constancy of mole-specific heat capacity) resulting in a good correlation between the volume of any given solid chemical element and its total heat capacity. Another way of stating this, is that the volume-specific heat capacity (volumetric heat capacity) of solid elements is roughly a constant. The molar volume of solid elements is very roughly constant, and (even more reliably) so also is the molar heat capacity for most solid substances. These two factors determine the volumetric heat capacity, which as a <b>bulk</b> <b>property</b> may be striking in consistency. For example, the element uranium is a metal which has a density almost 36 times that of the metal lithium, but uranium's specific heat capacity on a volumetric basis (i.e. per given volume of metal) is only 18% larger than lithium's.|$|E

[...] Elastivity is the intensive property of a material corresponding to the <b>bulk</b> <b>property</b> of a component, elastance. It is the reciprocal of permittivity. As Heaviside put it,Here, permittance is Heaviside's term for capacitance. He did not like any term that suggested that a capacitor was a container for holding charge. He rejected the terms capacity (capacitance) and capacious (capacitive) and their inverses incapacity and incapacious. [...] The terms current in his time for a capacitor were condenser (suggesting that the [...] "electric fluid" [...] could be condensed out) and leyden after the Leyden jar, an early form of capacitor, also suggesting some sort of storage. Heaviside preferred the analogy of a mechanical spring under compression, hence his preference for terms that suggested a property of a spring. [...] This preference was a result of Heaviside following James Clerk Maxwell's view of electric current, or at least, Heaviside's interpretation of it. In this view, electric current is a flow caused by the electromotive force and is the analogue of velocity caused by a mechanical force. At the capacitor, this current causes a [...] "displacement" [...] whose rate of change is equal to the current. The displacement is viewed as an electric strain, like a mechanical strain in a compressed spring. The existence of a flow of physical charge is denied, as is the buildup of charge on the capacitor plates. This is replaced with the concept of divergence of the displacement field at the plates, which is numerically equal to the charge collected on the plates in the charge flow view.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the design and}} test results of a passive prosthetic ankle that has mechanical behavior {{similar to that of}} a natural ankle. The ankle prosthesis is designed to store and return enough energy to the amputee to propel their body forward during push-off. The ankle prosthesis is a 2 degree of freedom (DoF) mechanism containing a network of conventional compression springs. One DoF allows the lower leg to compress when weight is applied; the other allows the foot to rotate about the ankle joint. <b>Bulk</b> <b>property</b> and dynamic performance criteria are used to assess the performance of the ankle prosthesis. Lightweight, compactness and low friction are the primary <b>bulk</b> <b>property</b> requirements for the ankle device. Stiffness nonlinearity and active behavior similar to that of a human ankle are the major dynamic performance characteristics. In this research, a preliminary computer geometric model of the prosthesis was developed, simulated, and refined in CAD software. A proof-of-concept prototype was then fabricated, modified and tested on both a robot and a human subject. The test results showed that the designed ankle prosthesis demonstrated its ability to satisfy the <b>bulk</b> <b>property</b> requirements and some of the dynamic performance characteristics.
