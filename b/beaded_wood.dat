The barn's interior is finished with <b>beaded</b> <b>wood.</b> A stuccoed log smokehouse with a pyramidal roof and a stone springhouse date to the 1830s. A small gazebo-like pavilion with a pyramidal roof acts as a wellhouse. An early 20th century icehouse has been converted to a garage.|$|E

Its roof is done in <b>beaded</b> <b>wood</b> paneling similar to that once used inside the school. The surrounding masonry work is different since the door was added later. Fenestration on that side consists of three aligned pairs of double-hung sash windows, one-over-one at the basement and first story, and two six-over-ones flanking a wooden door on the second.|$|E
25|$|On {{the second}} floor, the {{staircase}} from the entry passage opens {{on a large}} lobby from a two-arched staircase arcade. The lobby extends from the front back to the courtyard and is floored with diagonally laid gray and white marble tiles. The walls, as are old walls in the building, are plastered, and the ceiling has exposed 4x10 <b>beaded</b> ausubo <b>wood</b> beams. Old double four-paneled doors and a transom open to the courtyard. The window in the stairhall has been filled in with glass brick.|$|R
50|$|Sunshine: Extensive use of glazing was a {{fundamental}} feature, allowing the visual {{integration of the}} house into its surrounding landscape. Glass windows were <b>beaded</b> into structural <b>wood</b> members. The amount of glass was not necessarily increased but, was concentrated into wide areas facing the view and light.|$|R
2500|$|Construction of the {{original}} 1841-42 building is in traditional heavy masonry walls two feet thick. [...] The ceilings are high: 15' on the first floor, 14' on the second. There are several large structural arch openings in the interior masonry walls. The exposed floor joists are heavy 4x10 <b>beaded</b> edge ausubo <b>wood</b> members laid 24" [...] on center. These old joists support modern concrete slab second floor laid over wire mesh and composition board forms laid during the 20th century remodeling. Also added at this point was reinforced concrete framing adjoining the old walls on the first floor. It is now in deteriorated condition, while {{the original}} walls appear generally sound.|$|R

It is a barn, built in 1869, that was converted about 1925 {{to serve as a}} guesthouse for the Bragg family, and represents a fine local example of Colonial Revival architecture. Its structure is post-and-beam timber (cypress) framing, and its exterior is vertical board siding. The interior walls were covered in <b>beaded</b> <b>wood</b> paneling when the conversion was done, but most have since been enclosed in wallboard. The floors are pine throughout.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} of the original front section of the house retains a c. 1830 Georgian style mantel and original door and wood trim.

50|$|The 1911 school {{replaced}} {{an earlier}} school that had existed {{on the site}} since the 1880s. By the early 20th century local farmers were prospering, and chose to build a high-quality replacement school. The school features a large belfry with a 30-gallon cast iron bell on a higher-than-usual roof. The one-story wood frame school measures about 34.5 ft deep and 22.5 ft wide on a shaped stone foundation. The sole door is centered on the gabled front facade with the belfry above, flanked by two two-over-two sash windows. A cloakroom vestibule spans {{the front of the}} school on the west side, opening into the classroom. There are no windows on the north side, a concession to winter winds. Two windows on the east side and four on the south side light the room, which features a pressed tin ceiling. Walls were plastered and had <b>beaded</b> <b>wood</b> wainscoting. The plaster has been replaced by drywalll and the wainscot has been preserved. The wood strip floor has been preserved.|$|E
5000|$|The Black Walnut {{plantation}} complex grew {{to encompass}} {{a variety of}} domestic and agricultural outbuildings; the main house served as the focal point. Domestic outbuildings, including a smokehouse, dairy, kitchen, and icehouse, were placed in a U-shaped cluster to the rear, or west, of the main house. Slave quarters and agricultural outbuildings were more isolated from the main living area. A formal boxwood garden was laid out south of the main house, and a terraced vegetable garden was situated to the northwest. A variety of native and {{ornamental trees and shrubs}} landscaped the grounds, and the entire complex was enclosed by woodland. A family cemetery was situated northwest of the house. John Sims' prosperity was illustrated by the substantial modifications made to the manor house during {{the first quarter of the}} nineteenth century, at which time the central section of the house was raised to a full two-story height. The house was altered again with the construction of a substantial two-story frame addition connected by a central hyphen, resulting in its present H-shaped configuration. The 1848 tax assessment for this property shows an increase in valuation due to [...] "improvements". The plan of the house consisted of two center-hall, single-pile units joined by a center hyphen. The exterior walls were sheathed in <b>beaded</b> <b>wood</b> siding. The building's massing terminated in a gable roof sheathed in metal standing-seam panels. Wooden block modillions ornamented the front and rear eaves and partially returned cornices. Central brick exterior-end chimneys were located on each gable-end. Small attic vents punctuated the gable ends. The three-bay main facade was characterized by its symmetrical composition. A one-story hipped roof portico was centered on the facade and delineated the front entrance. Nine-over-nine-light, double-hung, wooden sash windows were aligned across this facade. The window openings were framed by louvered wood blinds. One-room units flanked the rear two-story section, and a one-story porch extended across the rear elevation.|$|E
