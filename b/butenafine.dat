50|$|There {{are many}} topical {{antifungal}} drugs {{useful in the}} treatment of athlete's foot including: miconazole nitrate, clotrimazole, tolnaftate (a synthetic thiocarbamate), terbinafine hydrochloride, <b>butenafine</b> hydrochloride and undecylenic acid. The fungal infection may be treated with topical antifungal agents, which can {{take the form of a}} spray, powder, cream, or gel. Topical application of an antifungal cream such as terbinafine once daily for one week or <b>butenafine</b> once daily for two weeks is effective in most cases of athlete's foot and is more effective than application of miconazole or clotrimazole. Plantar-type athlete's foot is more resistant to topical treatments due to the presence of thickened hyperkeratotic skin on the sole of the foot. Keratolytic and humectant medications such as urea, salicyclic acid (Whitfield's ointment), and lactic acid are useful adjunct medications and improve penetration of antifungal agents into the thickened skin. Topical glucocorticoids are sometimes prescribed to alleviate inflammation and itching associated with the infection.|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of action of a new benzylamine antimycotic, <b>butenafine</b> hydrochloride, was studied in Candida albicans by using the thiocarbamate antimycotic tolnaftate as a reference drug. <b>Butenafine</b> completely inhibited {{the growth of a}} test strain of C. albicans at 25 micrograms/ml and was cidal at 50 micrograms/ml.

40|$|<b>Butenafine</b> (N- 4 -tert-butylbenzyl-N-methyl- 1 -naphtalenemethylamine hydrochloride) is an {{antifungal}} {{agent of the}} benzylamine class that has excellent therapeutic efficacy and a remarkably long duration of action when applied topically to treat various mycoses. Given the lipophilic nature of the molecule, efficacy {{may be related to}} an interaction with cell membrane phospholipids and permeabilization of the fungal cell wall. Similarly, high lipophilicity could account for the long duration of action, since fixation to lipids in cutaneous tissues might allow them to act as local depots for slow release of the drug. We have therefore used computer-assisted conformational analysis to investigate the interaction of <b>butenafine</b> with lipids and extended these observations with experimental studies in vitro using liposomes. Conformational analysis of mixed monolayers of phospholipids with the neutral and protonated forms of <b>butenafine</b> highlighted a possible interaction with both the hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains of membrane phospholipids.

40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{activity}} of KP- 103, a novel triazole derivative, against pathogenic fungi that cause dermatomycoses and its therapeutic efficacy against plantar tinea pedis and cutaneous candidiasis in guinea pigs were investigated.

40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{antifungal}} susceptibilities of six clinical Trichophyton rubrum isolates obtained sequentially {{from a single}} onychomycosis patient who failed oral terbinafine therapy (250 mg/day for 24 weeks) were determined by broth microdilution and macrodilution methodologies. Strain relatedness was examined by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analyses. Data obtained from both broth micro- and macrodilution assays were in agreement and revealed that the six clinical isolates had greatly reduced susceptibilities to terbinafine. The MICs of terbinafine for these strains were > 4 μg/ml, whereas they were 128 μg/ml, whereas they were 0. 0002 μg/ml for the reference strain. The MIC of terbinafine for the baseline strain (cultured at the initial screening visit and before therapy was started) was already 4, 000 -fold higher than normal, suggesting {{that this is a}} case of primary resistance to terbinafine.
