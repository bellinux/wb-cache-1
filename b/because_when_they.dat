5|$|The {{characteristic}} {{bright orange}} bill plates and other facial characteristics {{develop in the}} spring. At {{the close of the}} breeding season, these special coatings and appendages are shed in a partial moult. This makes the beak appear less broad, the tip less bright and the base darker grey. The eye ornaments are shed and the eyes appear round. At the same time, the feathers {{of the head and neck}} are replaced and the face becomes darker. This winter plumage is seldom seen by humans <b>because</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> have left their chicks, the birds head out to sea and do not return to land until the next breeding season. The juvenile bird is similar to the adult in plumage but altogether duller with a much darker grey face and yellowish-brown beak tip and legs. After fledging, it will make its way to the water and will head out to sea and not return to land for several years. In the interim, each year it will have a broader bill, paler face patches and brighter legs and beak.|$|E
500|$|Reception to Nebulous was {{generally}} positive: a reviewer from The Times described the first series as [...] "a winning blend of Doomwatch, Quatermass and British silliness that has cult {{written all over}} it", while the second series was described as [...] "cool and cultish". However, The Daily Telegraph was more guarded, comparing the show to [...] "Hitchhiker's without the philosophy or Red Dwarf without the energy", going {{on to say that}} show is [...] "funny, but not seriously so". A reviewer for Doctor Who website UnitNews also initially expressed concerns about the level of jokes in the show, but later claimed [...] "I should have been more patient <b>because</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> did arrive, coinciding with the introduction of the character Harry, they were relentlessly funny".|$|E
500|$|Kelly died in Toronto, Canada, {{following}} an epileptic seizure, on April 12, 1971. He had traveled there from New York {{to play in}} a club with drummer George Reed and vocalist Herb Marshall. Kelly had a longstanding epilepsy problem, and had to monitor his condition carefully. An account of his death was given by his friend, Cobb: [...] "Wynton called his girlfriend in New York and said, 'You know, I don't feel good.' She said, 'Why don't you go downstairs to the bar and if something happens somebody could tend to you.' We don't know if he did that, <b>because</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> found him he was in the room." [...] Kelly was found in his room in the Westminster Hotel on Jarvis Street by Marshall. He was reported to have had almost no money {{at the time of his}} death. A memorial concert was held on June 28 in New York and featured numerous well-known musicians of the period.|$|E

2500|$|In 2011, the National Security Archive, in {{accordance}} with the Freedom of Information Act, released over 1200 pages of documents. One detail within these documents was incidents of friendly fire. The CIA had outfitted some B-26 bombers to appear as Cuban aircraft, having ordered them to remain inland to avoid being fired upon by American-backed forces. Some of the planes did not heed the warning, and were fired upon. According to CIA operative Grayston Lynch, “we couldn’t tell them from the Castro planes.

2500|$|Saturn's largest moon Titan {{is known}} to have {{extensive}} fields of dunes, though the origin of the material forming the dunes is not known - it could be small fragments of water ice eroded by flowing methane, or possibly particulate organic matter that formed in Titan's atmosphere and rained down on the surface. [...] Scientists are beginning to call this loose icy material regolith because of the mechanical similarity with regolith on other bodies, although traditionally (and etymologically) the term had been applied only when the loose layer was composed of mineral grains like quartz or plagioclase or rock fragments that were in turn composed of such minerals. [...] Loose blankets of ice grains were not considered to be regolith <b>because</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> appear on Earth in the form of snow they behave differently from regolith, the grains melting and fusing with only small changes in pressure or temperature. [...] However, Titan is so cold that ice behaves like rock. Thus there is an ice-regolith complete with erosion and aeolian and/or sedimentary processes.|$|E
2500|$|On March 24, 1897, Fidel Velez {{and his men}} met at Susua Arriba, {{just outside}} Yauco. They unfurled the Puerto Rican flag {{for the first time}} in Puerto Rican soil. and marched towards the town. They planned to attack the barracks of the Spanish Civil Guard with the aim of gaining control of the arms and {{ammunition}} which were stored there. The plan did not succeed <b>because</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> arrived they were ambushed by the Spanish forces who had set up positions and were waiting for them. A firefight ensued upon the arrival of the group and the rebels quickly retreated. On March 26, another group headed by Jose Nicolas Quiñones Torres and Ramon Torres attempted to fight the Spaniards in a barrio called [...] "Quebradas" [...] of Yauco, however said revolt also failed. Over 150 rebels were arrested, accused of various crimes against the state and sent to prison in the City of Ponce. Velez fled to St. Thomas where he lived in exile, while Mattei Lluberas went into exile in New York City and joined a group known as the [...] "Puerto Rican Commission".|$|E
2500|$|Paulini uses life {{experiences}} {{her and her}} friends and family have gone through as inspiration for writing songs, and tries to keep the lyrics as honest as possible. She began writing songs before entering Australian Idol, but stated that she had [...] "stopped and just did the projects I was told to do," [...] referring to her first two albums released through Sony BMG. Paulini had no songwriting credits on her debut album One Determined Heart (2004), and co-wrote only two tracks on her second album Superwoman (2006). In an interview with The Sydney Morning Herald, Paulini revealed that she felt manufactured with her first two albums, saying: [...] "You kind of actually feel trapped <b>because</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> would ask you to make an album, they'd {{have a list of}} songs ready for you to choose from. It was like a massive list of just songs that other people have written that you can just kind of go, 'Oh yeah. I like that one. I like the sound of this.' It just didn't seem real. I mean, it wasn't real for me. They were all great songs and written by awesome writers. But, they weren't my words and my experiences; I didn't feel like it belonged to me." [...] Paulini was heavily involved with the songwriting on her third album Come Alive (2015), having co-written all but two tracks on the album. She referred to Come Alive as her first real album as she took her time working on it, explaining that with [...] "this one, this is me. Every experience in there is me, it's what I've gone through, or what I’ve interpreted {{from my point of view}} with other situations with my friends and family." ...|$|E

2500|$|Climate plays a {{major role}} in the moose-wolf {{relationship}} as well. Since El Niño hit in 1998, the climate has warmed up, which has significantly affected the moose population across North America. [...] The warmer climate in recent years has produced more Moose winter ticks, which consume the blood of animals, making them more susceptible to anemia, and induce the moose to scratch off their hair, exposing them to hypothermia in cold weather. [...] A moose can have tens of thousands of ticks feeding on its blood at one time, each sucking up to one milliliter of blood. The biting ticks cause a lot of discomfort for the moose, so they try to get the ticks off their bodies by biting off their hair, and rubbing up against trees. This preoccupies moose, and keeps them from browsing for food, which can lead to malnutrition. Compounded with blood loss, moose weakened by ticks are easier for wolves to kill. [...] Ticks are more prominent in years where spring arrives earlier than usual, <b>because</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> fall on ground not covered in snow, then they can reproduce. Otherwise, they die out. [...] Then, if the summer is hot, ticks are able to reproduce at a higher rate. Hot summers also lead to moose resting in the shade, or in the water to keep cool, making them easier prey for wolves. Also, hot summers lead to tougher foraging for moose which makes them less prepared and more vulnerable to the winter. Not only has the recent warming of Isle Royale hurt the moose, but completely opposite problems harm them also. Harsh winters pose significant problems to moose, because moose have problems finding food when there is too much snow on the ground. [...] The less snow there is, the more freely moose can move around the island. When there is a significant amount of snow, moose stay in conifer swamps, making them easier prey for wolves, because they are more confined, and immobilized due to the snow. [...] Deep or heavy snow decreases the speed and agility of moose that is necessary to evade wolf attacks, and calves born during a winter with particularly deep snow are more vulnerable to being weaker prey for wolves later on in their lives because of foraging problems that occur when the snow is deep.|$|E
