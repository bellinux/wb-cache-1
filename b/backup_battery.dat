5|$|In {{the major}} MRT {{disruption}} of 15 December 2011, one C151 train (trainset 067/068, T139 in the COI) was stalled {{in the tunnel}} and its <b>backup</b> <b>battery</b> failed. The passenger compartments in T139 experienced a blackout and loss of ventilation, leading to one passenger smashing a train door window to avoid suffocation. The battery failure led to criticism by the COI {{on the condition of}} the aging emergency batteries installed on all C151 trains. SMRT has since proposed an upgrading plan to address this issue.|$|E
5|$|All of the Links are cleaned twice weekly, with LinkNYC staff {{removing}} vandalism {{and dirt}} from the Links. Each Link has cameras and over 30 vibration sensors to sense if the kiosk {{has been hit}} by an object. A separate set of sensors also detects if the USB ports are tampered with. If either the vibration sensors or the USB port sensors detect tampering, an alert is displayed at LinkNYC headquarters that the specific part of the Link has been affected. All of the Links have a <b>backup</b> <b>battery</b> power supply that can last for up to 24 hours if a long-term power outage were to occur. This is {{because of what happened}} in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in 2012, which caused power outages citywide, especially to the city's payphones (which were connected to the municipal power supply of New York City).|$|E
25|$|Initial reports {{suggested}} the crash had {{been caused by}} a combination of severe weather and mechanical problems with the aircraft. The investigation into the accident, however, found the cause was spatial disorientation following the loss of a flight instrument after both generators failed. <b>Backup</b> <b>battery</b> power was exhausted early, due to the crew using an outdated checklist and not adhering to a checklist.|$|E

50|$|<b>Backup</b> <b>batteries</b> in {{aircraft}} keep essential {{instruments and}} devices {{running in the}} event of an engine power failure. Each aircraft has enough power in the <b>backup</b> <b>batteries</b> to facilitate a safe landing. The batteries keeping navigation, ELUs (emergency lighting units), emergency pressure or oxygen systems running at altitude, and radio equipment operational. Larger aircraft have control surfaces that run on these backups as well. Aircraft batteries are either nickel-cadmium or valve-regulated lead acid type. The battery keeps all necessary items running for between 30 minutes and 3 hours. Large aircraft may have a ram air turbine to provide additional power during engine failures.|$|R

2500|$|Pathfinder was {{powered by}} eight {{electric}} motors — later reduced to six — which were first powered by batteries. It had a wing span of [...] Two underwing pods contain the landing gear, batteries, instrumentation system, and flight control computer. By {{the time the}} aircraft was adopted into the ERAST project in late 1993, solar cells were being added, eventually covering the entire upper surface of the wing. The solar arrays provide power for the aircraft's electric motors, avionics, communications and other electronic systems. Pathfinder also had a <b>backup</b> <b>battery</b> system that can provide power for between two and five hours to allow limited-duration flight after dark.|$|E
5000|$|A {{reserve battery}} is {{distinguished}} from a <b>backup</b> <b>battery,</b> in that a reserve battery is inert {{until it is}} activated, while a <b>backup</b> <b>battery</b> is already functional, {{even if it is}} not delivering current.|$|E
50|$|Philae power {{management}} was planned for two phases. In the first phase, the lander operated solely on battery power. In the second phase, {{it was to}} run on <b>backup</b> <b>batteries</b> recharged by solar cells.|$|R

The pneumatic system is nowadays often replaced by a computer-controlled turbopump.|$|R
50|$|The Service Module also {{mounted the}} spacecraft's waste heat {{management}} system (its radiators) {{and the aforementioned}} solar panels. These panels, along with <b>backup</b> <b>batteries</b> located in the Orion CM, would provide in-flight power to the ship's systems.

Of the two rooms, one was the report room used for administrative work, record keeping and logbooks. It is currently used as a radio room. The second room housed a spare mantle holder.

40|$|This paper shows a technical-economical {{analysis}} of a novel Uninterruptible Power Systems (UPS) configuration, in which the <b>backup</b> <b>batteries</b> would {{be replaced by a}} photovoltaic (PV) system. Many interesting technical and economical issues concerning the proposed configuration are discussed against the traditional UPS and <b>backup</b> <b>batteries</b> solution. Moreover the technical solutions concerning the proposed integrated system realized using a double conversion UPS are motivated. Finally the operating costs of the proposed integrated PV-UPS system and the classical system with UPS and batteries with different sizes, and as the back-up time varies, are also compared and interesting results have been observed. Of course, the costs estimation for systems including renewables is not easy and cannot be precise, especially on the mid and long term, but still the analysis carried out shows that the proposed system seems to be an economically convenient choice at present in many cases and in the near future almost in all cases...|$|R
