5|$|In {{a pair of}} studies, high-functioning {{children}} with autism aged 8–15 performed equally well as, and adults better than, individually matched controls at <b>basic</b> <b>language</b> tasks involving vocabulary and spelling. Both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language, comprehension and inference. As people are often sized up initially from their <b>basic</b> <b>language</b> skills, these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals {{are more likely to}} overestimate what their audience comprehends.|$|E

25|$|Ferrin are small, ratlike humanoids {{who live}} across the {{temperate}} world. Some live {{out in the}} wild, foraging for food and protecting their warrens, while many others live in human cities. Those who live in human cities often filch food and hunt rats. Most consider them a minor nuisance at best and vermin to be exterminated at worst. They are somewhat intelligent, though not as intelligent as humans. They have a very <b>basic</b> <b>language</b> and understand clothing and tools, including simple weapons.|$|E
25|$|As the {{historian}} Bernard Johnpoll notes, the SLP which Daniel DeLeon joined in 1890 differed little {{from the organization}} which had been born {{at the end of}} the 1870s—it was largely a German-language organization located in an English-speaking country. Just 17 of the party's 77 branches used English as their <b>basic</b> <b>language,</b> while only two members of the party's governing National Executive Committee spoke English fluently. The arrival of erudite, well-read, multilingual university lecturer with English fluency was seen as a great triumph for the SLP organization.|$|E

25|$|In December 1974 Bill Gates was {{a student}} at Harvard University and Paul Allen worked for Honeywell in Boston when they saw the Altair 8800 {{computer}} in the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics.

They wanted {{to be the first to}} offer BASIC for the Altair computer and the software development tools they had previously created for their Intel 8008 microprocessor based Traf-O-Data computer would give them a head start.|$|E
25|$|Based {{on these}} results the {{concluded}} that Genie's brain had completed lateralization and that, because Genie had received no stimulation in her language center {{when she was}} a child, it had atrophied and her language functions had instead lateralized to her right hemisphere. Her results on their non-language tests suggested to them that her hemispheric dominance was not simply reversed. They believed that Genie had been developing as a normal right-handed person until the time her father began isolating her, and attributed the extreme imbalance between Genie's left and right hemispheres to the fact that Genie's sensory stimulation as a child was almost exclusively visual and tactile. Previous observations of right-hemisphere language acquisition in adult split-brain and left hemispherectomy patients consistently showed that both populations were much better at learning vocabulary, although they were able to learn some basic grammar. Linguists noted these subjects had an advantage over Genie because, unlike her, their right hemispheres had already acquired at least a small amount of <b>basic</b> <b>language.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} Hesiod's {{complaints}} about poverty, life on his father's farm {{could not have}} been too uncomfortable if Works and Days is anything to judge by, since he describes the routines of prosperous yeomanry rather than peasants. His farmer employs a friend (Works and Days 370) as well as servants (502, 573, 597, 608, 766), an energetic and responsible ploughman of mature years (469 ff.), a slave boy to cover the seed (441–6), a female servant to keep house (405, 602) and working teams of oxen and mules (405, 607f.). One modern scholar surmises that Hesiod may have learned about world geography, especially the catalogue of rivers in Theogony (337–45), listening to his father's accounts of his own sea voyages as a merchant. The father probably spoke in the Aeolian dialect of Cyme but Hesiod probably grew up speaking the local Boeotian, belonging to the same dialect group. However, while his poetry features some Aeolisms there are no words that are certainly Boeotian. His <b>basic</b> <b>language</b> was the main literary dialect of the time, Homer's Ionian.|$|E

500|$|One of Tarn and Zach Adams' {{early works}} was a text based {{adventure}} game called dragslay, {{written in the}} <b>BASIC</b> <b>language</b> and influenced by Dungeons and Dragons. This was the brothers' first fantasy project. In high school, Tarn Adams taught himself the C programming language and developed it further. dragslay would later have an important influence on Dwarf Fortress. Adams explained his interest in fantasy games, that {{he had grown up}} [...] "surrounded by that sort of thing...along with generic sci-fi, generic fantasy is part of our heritage." [...] Years later, before entering graduate school in mathematics, Adams began working on a project he called Slaves to Armok: God of Blood. It was named after a deity in dragslay, originally named for a variable [...] "arm_ok"—which counted the limbs the player still had attached. This new project was a two-dimensional (would later have 3D graphics) isometric fantasy role-playing game in which the player encountered and fought goblins.|$|E
500|$|Whether {{or not the}} characters' simple speech helps build <b>basic</b> <b>language</b> skills {{has been}} debated. Los Angeles Times critic Lynne Heffley commended the {{interactive}} aspects of the show but mentioned that the simplified dialogue can distract from the educational content. She writes, [...] "the repetition of single words and use of incomplete sentences ... offer a mixed result: at times seeming too babyish, at other times effectively underscoring concepts, ideas and vocabulary." [...] In her Common Sense Media review, Andrea Graham stated that the language [...] "should {{not be seen as}} detrimental to a child's speech development – rather, it's a language that young children understand and appreciate." [...] Jaime Egan of Families.com wrote negatively of the dialogue but felt that it did not divert from the educational value. She wrote that [...] "even though the characters do not speak in complete sentences ... the lessons that this show teaches can be invaluable." [...] The hosts of Ray William Johnson's Equals Three criticized the simplified language, stating that the puppets [...] "didn't even use full sentences. They just said enough words to make themselves understood." [...] Amy Sohn of New York magazine expressed her opinion that the language ruined the show as a whole, calling the characters [...] "speech-impaired." [...] The Star Tribunes James Lileks deemed the series [...] "brain-rotting," [...] and Pete Vonder Haar of the Houston Press called Oobis writers [...] "lazy" [...] for using such a simple concept.|$|E
