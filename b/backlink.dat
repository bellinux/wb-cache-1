5|$|To {{convert the}} <b>backlink</b> data {{gathered}} by BackRub's web crawler into {{a measure of}} importance for a given web page, Brin and Page developed the PageRank algorithm, and realized {{that it could be}} used to build a search engine far superior to existing ones. The new algorithm relied on a new kind of technology that analyzed the relevance of the backlinks that connected one Web page to another, and allowed the number of links and their rank, to determine the rank of the page. Combining their ideas, the pair began utilizing Page's dormitory room as a machine laboratory, and extracted spare parts from inexpensive computers to create a device that they used to connect the nascent search engine with Stanford's broadband campus network. After filling Page's room with equipment, they then converted Brin's dorm room into an office and programming center, where they tested their new search engine designs on the Web. The rapid growth of their project caused Stanford's computing infrastructure to experience problems.|$|E

25|$|Cho et al. {{made the}} first study on {{policies}} for crawling scheduling. Their data set was a 180,000-pages crawl from the stanford.edu domain, in which a crawling simulation was done with different strategies. The ordering metrics tested were breadth-first, <b>backlink</b> count and partial Pagerank calculations. One of the conclusions was that if the crawler wants to download pages with high Pagerank early during the crawling process, then the partial Pagerank strategy is the better, followed by breadth-first and backlink-count. However, these results are for just a single domain. Cho also wrote his Ph.D. dissertation at Stanford on web crawling.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: <b>Backlinks,</b> {{which are}} {{sometimes}} called inbound links, are incoming links to a web page or the entire website. Search engines have measure {{the number of}} <b>backlinks</b> a website or web page has, and ranks those web pages with more <b>backlinks</b> in a higher position as inbound links are important to search engine rankings. Back links play two important roles they direct traffic to your web site and factor in the search engines deciding the position of your web pages in the index of results. Web pages use different types of <b>backlinks</b> to make the linking a mutually beneficial objective, {{as well as to}} build the number of <b>backlinks</b> to the website. A web page that has more <b>backlinks</b> than another with similar content will rank higher than the other page, simply because it seems to be more popular with visitors and other websites...|$|R
50|$|Websites often employ SEO {{techniques}} {{to increase the}} number of <b>backlinks</b> pointing to their website. Some methods are free for use by everyone whereas some methods, like linkbaiting, require quite a bit of planning and marketing to work. There are also paid {{techniques to}} increase the number of <b>backlinks</b> to a target site. For example, private blog networks can be used to purchase <b>backlinks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Competitor <b>backlinking</b> is {{a search}} engine {{optimization}} strategy that involves analyzing the <b>backlinks</b> of competing websites within a vertical search. The outcome of this activity is designed to increase organic search engine rankings and to {{gain an understanding of}} the link building strategies used by business competitors.|$|R

If he could devise a method to count and qualify each <b>backlink</b> on the Web, as Page puts it [...] "the Web would become a more valuable place." [...] Battelle further described how Page and Brin began working together on the project: ...|$|E
2500|$|Within {{the text}} of most pages, there are usually {{a large number of}} {{hypertext}} links to other pages within the wiki. This form of non-linear navigation is more [...] "native" [...] to a wiki than structured/formalized navigation schemes. Users can also create any number of index or table-of-contents pages, with hierarchical categorization or whatever form of organization they like. These may be challenging to maintain [...] "by hand", as multiple authors and users may create and delete pages in an ad hoc, unorganized manner. Wikis can provide one or more ways to categorize or tag pages to support the maintenance of such index pages. Some wikis, including the original, have a <b>backlink</b> feature, which displays all pages that link to a given page. It is also typically possible in a wiki to create links to pages that do not yet exist, as a way to invite others to share what they know about a subject new to the wiki. Wiki users can typically [...] "tag" [...] pages with categories or keywords, {{to make it easier for}} other users to find the article. For example, a user creating a new article on cold weather cycling might [...] "tag" [...] this page under the categories of commuting, winter sports and bicycling. This would make it easier for other users to find the article.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} factors that {{determine}} {{the value of}} a <b>backlink.</b> Backlinks from authoritative sites on a given topic are highly valuable. If both sites have content geared toward the keyword topic, the <b>backlink</b> is considered relevant and believed to have strong influence on the search engine rankings of the web page granted the <b>backlink.</b> A <b>backlink</b> represents a favorable 'editorial vote' for the receiving webpage from another granting webpage. Another important factor is the anchor text of the <b>backlink.</b> Anchor text is the descriptive labeling of the hyperlink as it appears on a web page. Search engine bots (i.e., spiders, crawlers, etc.) examine the anchor text to evaluate how relevant it is to the content on a webpage. Anchor text and webpage content congruency are highly weighted in search engine results page (SERP) rankings of a webpage with respect to any given keyword query by a search engine user.|$|E
5000|$|Unlinked content: pages {{which are}} not linked to by other pages, which may prevent web {{crawling}} programs from accessing the content. This content {{is referred to as}} pages without <b>backlinks</b> (also known as inlinks). Also, search engines do not always detect all <b>backlinks</b> from searched web pages.|$|R
40|$|The study {{examines}} {{the number of}} <b>backlinks</b> to the websites of libraries belonging to Central Universities of India. The study has presented seven categories of library webpages based on their features. The {{study was conducted in}} five rounds to get the primary data through four selected search engines. Analysis is presented for each search engine separately. Study concludes that index page/home page of library websites attracts more number of <b>backlinks</b> than any other webpages of library websites. Search engine Yahoo Site Explorer retrieved highest number of <b>backlinks</b> for library websites...|$|R

50|$|Domain Authority (DA), {{a website}} metric {{developed}} by Moz, is a predictive metric {{to determine a}} website's traffic and organic search engine rankings. Domain Authority is based on different link metrics, such as number of linking root domains, number of total <b>backlinks,</b> and the distance of <b>backlinks</b> from the home page of websites.|$|R
50|$|By {{analyzing}} the <b>backlinks</b> to competitor websites, {{it is possible}} to gain a benchmark on the number of links and the quality of links that is required for high search engine rankings. Another possible outcome of competitive <b>backlinking</b> is the identification of the type of websites that are inclined to link to a specific type of website.|$|R
40|$|A {{web page}} {{generally}} includes {{elements such as}} text, hyperlink, image, etc. Hyperlink represents a relationship between two web pages or just between sections of the same page. Understanding the hyperlink structure is fundamental to understanding the Web connectivity structure, because hyperlinks {{have been used in}} web indexing and information retrieval, as well as page ranking. If the Web were a car, hyperlinks would be the engine, because without them, we are not going anywhere. It can be concluded that search engines consider that any words used by other sites to describe a site is particularly relevant even if the keywords are not used in the <b>backlinked</b> site/page (the linked target destination). In other words, the foreign language text links allow the linked sites {{to have a chance to}} be retrieved as relevant results in response to a search query. Many search engines judge the linking page partly based on the quality of the linked page, and if many sites <b>backlinking</b> to a site use keywords in their link text, search engines will raise its ranking for those keywords. Ultimately, <b>backlinks</b> from popular websites with a higher ranking, have a higher weight then <b>backlinks</b> from smaller unknown websites...|$|R

5000|$|Yahoo! Site Explorer (YSE) was a Yahoo! service {{which allowed}} users to view {{information}} on websites in Yahoo!'s search index. The service was closed on November 21, 2011 and merged with Bing Webmaster Tools, a tool similar to Google Webmaster Tools. [...] In particular, it was useful for finding information on backlinks {{pointing to a}} given webpage or domain because YSE offered full, timely <b>backlink</b> reports for any site. After merging with Bing Webmaster Tools, the service only offers full <b>backlink</b> reports to sites owned by the webmaster. Reports for sites not owned by the webmaster are limited to 1,000 links.|$|E

50|$|When {{the search}} results pop {{up after the}} user has input their keyword, DeepPeep ranks the links based on 3 features: term content, number of <b>backlinks.</b> and pagerank. Firstly, the term content is simply {{determined}} by {{the content of the}} web link and its relevance. <b>Backlinks</b> are hyperlinks or links that direct the user to a different website. Pageranks is the ranking of websites in search engine results and works by counting the amount and quality of links to website to determine its importance. Pagerank and back link information are obtained from outside sources such as Google, Yahoo, and Bing.|$|R
30|$|Finally, Shorter College, {{the only}} private, two-year HBCU in this study, is smaller and less popular than its non-HBCU peer, Louisburg College, {{measured}} by <b>backlinks,</b> organic keywords, web traffic, web advertising, and webpages.|$|R
30|$|Practitioners at HBCUs—especially {{those in}} web {{development}} and marketing—can glean several insights from this study. First, {{data in this}} study suggest HBCU websites are much smaller in terms of webpages than peer institutions. From here, web developers at HBCUs should collaborate across departments, including admissions, financial aid, and prospective student recruitment, to produce attractive, keyword-specific web content for prospective students and post that content on their institutional website. Furthermore, HBCU practitioners could explore collaborations with other institutions or organizations and produce content that could be added to other websites. Across sectors, HBCUs had markedly fewer <b>backlinks</b> to their websites than non-HBCU institutions, meaning that Internet users {{are much more likely}} to encounter non-HBCU institutional material in other places on the Internet than HBCU material. HBCUs could consider collaborating among themselves to embed <b>backlinks</b> to other HBCU websites on their own, increasing the number <b>backlinks</b> and web presence that HBCUs could have. Paul Quinn College could serve as a model institution in terms of how to increase web presence and popularity: HBCUs could learn to compete from one of their own.|$|R
50|$|Widgets come in many {{shapes and}} sizes, {{but two of}} the major types today are Web widgets and Desktop widgets. Web widgets are {{intended}} for use on (embedding in) webpages and have major implications in areas such as site performance, SEO and even <b>backlink</b> campaigns. Desktop widgets are embedded on local computers, and do not impact SEO or webpage performance.|$|E
50|$|Search engines require ways {{to confirm}} page relevancy. A known {{method is to}} examine for one-way links coming {{directly}} from relevant websites. The process of building links {{should not be confused}} with being listed on link farms, as the latter requires reciprocal return links, which often renders the overall <b>backlink</b> advantage useless. This is due to oscillation, causing confusion over which is the vendor site and which is the promoting site.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{consider}} the problem of maximizing the PageRank of a given target node in a graph by adding $k$ new links. We consider {{the case that the}} new links must point to the given target node (<b>backlinks).</b> Previous work shows that this problem has no fully polynomial time approximation schemes unless $P=NP$. We present a polynomial time algorithm yielding a PageRank value within a constant factor from the optimal. We also consider the naive algorithm where we choose <b>backlinks</b> from nodes with high PageRank values compared to the outdegree and show that the naive algorithm performs much worse on certain graphs compared to the constant factor approximation scheme...|$|R
5000|$|Google {{has been}} {{updating}} its algorithm {{for as long}} as it has been fighting the manipulation of organic search results. However, up until May 10, 2012, when Google launched the Google Penguin update, many people wrongly believed that low-quality <b>backlinks</b> would not negatively affect ranks. While this viewpoint was common, it was not correct, as Google had been applying such link-based penalties for many years, but not made public how the company approached and dealt with what they called [...] "link spam". Since this time there has been a much wider acknowledgement about the dangers of bad SEO and a forensic analysis of <b>backlinks</b> to ensure there are no harmful links.|$|R
