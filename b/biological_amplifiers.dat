40|$|An {{analysis}} of the motor control information content made available with a neural machine interface (NMI) in 4 subjects is presented in this study. We have developed a novel NMI called targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR) to improve the function of artificial arms for amputees. TMR involves transferring the residual amputated nerves to non-functional muscles in amputees. The reinnervated muscles act as <b>biological</b> <b>amplifiers</b> of motor commands in the amputated nerves and the surface electromyogram (EMG) {{can be used to}} enhance control of a robotic arm. While initial clinical success with TMR has been promising, the number of degrees of freedom of the robotic arm that can be controlled has been limited by the number of reinnervated muscle sites. In this study we assess how much control information can be extracted from reinnervated muscles using high-density surface EMG electrode arrays to record surface EMG signals over the reinnervated muscles. We then applied pattern classification techniques to the surface EMG signals. High accuracy was achieved in the classification of 16 intended arm, hand an...|$|E
40|$|Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV) is a flavivirus {{maintained}} in a zoonotic cycle which involves pigs, birds and Culex species of mosquitoes causing fatal encephalitis endemic most of Asia {{and as far}} as Australia from its putative origin in Indonesia and Malaysia. The principle vector is Culex mosquito, most important being Culex tritaenorhynchus, present in greatest density in rainy season (June to November) Humans are accidental dead-end-hosts as they do not develop a level of viraemia sufficient to infect mosquitoes. The natural cycle of JEV consists of pig-mosquito-pig or bird-mosquito-bird and pigs serve as a <b>biological</b> <b>amplifiers</b> and reservoirs. The risk for Japanese encephalitis varies by appropriate ecological conditions and season to cause epidemics and epizootics. Disease control by vaccination is considered to be most effective. The Envelope (E) protein is dominant antigen including immunologic responses in infected host and eliciting virus neutralizing antibodies. Large scale immunization of susceptible human population is highly important to prevent this deadly infection. Attempts are being made to develop enhanced vaccines using the recombinant DNA technology. Since the existing inactivated, live attenuated or killed vaccines have side effects such as neurological disorders and systemic hypersensitivity, DNA based vaccines might aid the purpose of combating against JEV which are presently under clinical trials.

40|$|Coastal {{lake and}} estuarine systems across south eastern Australia act as both {{sedimentary}} and <b>biological</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> {{and are more}} sensitive to cumulative catchment-driven hydrological change than previously recognised (see Tibby et al., this volume). Deciphering natural responses to climate change and geomorphology, and ensuing historical responses to catchment clearance and regulation reveals whether these systems now lie within pre-disturbance variability, {{and the extent to}} which anthropogenic change is unidirectional. A multi-proxy palaeoecological assessment of the terminal coastal and estuarine lakes of the Snowy River floodplain will be presented. The Snowy River is one of Australia’s hallmark river systems. Its catchment has been substantially modified since the mid 1800 s. The ecological and water quality impacts of a major inter-basin transfer of up to 99 % of its flow since the mid 1960 s are poorly understood. Incorporating a diatom-water quality inference model, stable isotope and fossil pigment reconstruction, this study has examined (a) notions of variability in the progressive evolution of the system (b) how the records compare to that of a relatively un-impacted (control) system nearby (c) the influence of natural perturbations on the ecology of these lakes (with respect to salinity and nutrient status), as well as (d) the nature and timing of anthropogenic disturbance. Explained as a combination of land clearance, drainage practices, and more recently, substantial flow diversion in the Snowy River, recent water quality changes are as pronounced as any experienced through the Holocene. However, they have occurred at a rate faster than those brought on by past climatic or geomorphic change. International Union for Quaternary Researc...|$|E
50|$|A Driven Right Leg Circuit or DRL circuit is an {{electric}} circuit {{that is often}} added to <b>biological</b> signal <b>amplifiers</b> to reduce Common-mode interference. <b>Biological</b> signal <b>amplifiers</b> such as ECG (Electrocardiogram) EEG (Electroencephalogram) or EMG circuits measure very small electrical signals emitted by the body, often as small as several micro-volts (millionths of a volt). Unfortunately, the patient's body can also act as an antenna which picks up electromagnetic interference, especially 50/60 Hz noise from electrical power lines. This interference can obscure the biological signals, making them very hard to measure. Right Leg Driver circuitry is used to eliminate interference noise by actively canceling the interference.|$|R
40|$|The {{electrical}} potential difference across the human red cell membrane has been measured directly. A <b>biological</b> <b>amplifier</b> with neutralized input capacity was used. Human red cells in modified Ringer solution were impaled individually with 3 M KCl-filled glass microelectrodes. Movements of the microelectrodes were effected by Leitz micromanipulators. Results showed a potential difference of - 8. 0 ± 0. 21 (SEM) mv, the inside being negative {{with respect to the}} outside. This value is approximately that calculated by using the Nernst equation considering the intracellular and extracellular chloride concentrations. As a control, similar measurements were made on nylon microcapsules containing hemoglobin. The measured potential of - 0. 52 ± 0. 02 (SEM) mv, which agreed very well with the value calculated on the basis of Donnan equilibrium, was much smaller in magnitude as compared to the results for the red cell, and there was evidence of fixed charges on the microcapsule membrane.

40|$|A integridade da via auditiva e a investigação do respectivo limiar eletrofisiológico podem ser avaliadas por meio da observação, no domínio do tempo, dos potenciais evocados auditivos de tronco encefálico. Atualmente, nova técnica de análise dos potenciais evocados auditivos, no domínio das freqüências, tem sido utilizada para uma observação {{particular}} desses limiares. Assim, com a aplicação da transformada rápida de Fourier, é possível realizar a análise das freqüências comprometidas na audição, de maneira eficiente e rápida. O objetivo com este trabalho, então, foi desenvolver, caracterizar e realizar testes preliminares com um dispositivo único capaz de avaliar os potenciais evocados auditivos nos dois domínios, por meio de uma placa de som, que ainda não havia sido implementada para tal fim. Desse modo, foi produzido um aparelho capaz de registrar sinais biológicos da ordem de 0, 5 ?V. Após a caracterização e o estudo simulado, foram conduzidos testes-piloto com doze seres humanos, ouvintes normais (n = 24 orelhas), divididos em dois grupos com o mesmo número de participantes. No grupo 1, os potenciais evocados auditivos de tronco encefálico adquiridos por meio de um instrumento padrão-ouro e de instrumento desenvolvido foram comparados entre si. Em seguida, os achados foram relacionados com o exame no domínio das freqüências formatado no novo aparelho. O grupo 2 foi submetido à avaliação dos potenciais miogênicos vestibulares, também com os dois instrumentos, e suas latências absolutas comparadas. Os resultados demonstraram não haver diferenças significativas entre os dois instrumentos para as amplitudes e latências do potencial evocado auditivo de tronco encefálico. Constatou-se, ainda, que as ondas presentes no domínio do tempo davam respostas equivalentes no domínio das freqüências. Por fim, também não foram encontradas diferenças significativas entre os dois aparelhos para as latências do potencial miogênico vestibular. The {{integrity of}} the auditory pathway and {{the investigation of the}} respective electrophysiological threshold can be assessed by observation, in the time domain, of brainstem auditory evoked potentials. This assessment is usually evoked by clicks, which have a wide acoustic spectrum, and consequently serious limitations with respect to frequency specificity, in determining electrophysiological thresholds. New techniques for analyzing auditory evoked potentials in the frequency domain are currently being used for a closer observation of these thresholds. Thus, by applying the fast Fourier transform, one can analyzed the compromised auditory frequencies efficiently and rapidly. This method, on the other hand, does not investigate the integrity of specific auditory pathway structures, as the other method does. Although both types of assessment require similar biological amplifier architecture and are, to a certain extent, complementary, they are performed with two distinct devices. The first, which makes the observation in the time domain, is quite well known and several manufacturers have been producing it for a long time. The second, which inspects the potentials in the frequency domain, was introduced into the market only a few years ago. The aim of this study, therefore, was to develop, characterize and conduct preliminary tests with a single device capable of evaluating the auditory evoked potentials in both domains, by means of a sound card that had not been previously used for this purpose. Thus, a device was produced with <b>biological</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> filters, electrical protection apparatus and a logic control system capable of recording biological signals around 0. 5 µV. After characterization and the simulated study, pilot tests were carried out with 12 normal- hearing subjects (n = 24 ears), allocated to two groups of 6 participants. In group 1, we observed the latencies and amplitudes of waves I, III and V of the brainstem auditory evoked potentials, using a gold standard instrument and a developed instrument and later compared them. The findings were then correlated to those of the frequency domain examination formatted on the new device. Group 2 was submitted to an assessment of components p 13 and n 23 of the vestibular myogenic potentials to observe the most delayed biological signals, also with both instruments, and their absolute latencies were compared. The results showed {{no significant differences between the}} two instruments for the amplitudes (p = 0. 379; p = 0. 301; p = 0. 605, waves I, III and V, respectively) and latencies (p = 0. 381; p = 0. 140; p = 0. 255) of the brainstem auditory evoked potentials. It was also found that the waves present in the time domain gave equivalent responses in the frequency domain. Finally, no significant differences were observed between the two devices for the absolute latencies of components p 13 and n 23 of the vestibular myogenic potentials, with p values of 0. 102 and 0. 078, respectively. Thus, it was concluded that the new instruments were efficient for the functions tested...|$|E

40|$|Thyroid hormone {{disorders}} and thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies (TPO-Ab) in women {{are associated with}} subfertility and early pregnancy loss. Here, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview {{of the literature on}} the pathophysiology of these associations. A review of the literature in the English language was carried out. Relevant studies were identified by searching Medline, EMBASE and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register from 1975 until March 2014. From a total of 6108 primary selected articles from the literature search, 105 articles were selected for critical appraisal. Observational data indicate that altered thyroid hormone levels are associated with disturbed folliculogenesis, spermatogenesis, lower fertilization rates and lower embryo quality. Triiodothyronine (T 3) in combination with FSH enhances granulosa cell proliferation and inhibits granulosa cell apoptosis by the PI 3 K/Akt pathway. T 3 is considered a <b>biological</b> <b>amplifier</b> of the stimulatory action of gonadotrophins on granulosa cell function. T 3 increases the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), MMP- 2, MMP- 3, fetal fibronectin and integrin α 5 β 1 T 3 in early placental extravillous trophoblasts. Thyroid hormone transporters and receptors are expressed in the ovary, early embryo, endometrium, uterus and placenta. No other data explaining the associations could be retrieved from the literature. The presence of TPO-Ab is negatively associated with spermatogenesis, fertilization and embryo quality, but no data are available on the potential pathophysiological mechanisms. Thyroid hormone {{disorders and}} TPO-Ab are associated with disturbed folliculogenesis, spermatogenesis, fertilization and embryogenesis. The pathophysiology of these associations remains largely unknown, as evidence is limited and includes studies using small sample sizes, and often restricted to animal models. There are no studies on the pathophysiology underlying the association between TPO-Ab and reproduction. The available evidence, although limited, supports a role of thyroid hormone in fertility and early pregnancy. This justifies clinical intervention studies on the effects of thyroid hormone supplementation in women with subclinical hypothyroidism and in women prone to develop hypothyroidism due to the presence of TPO-Ab. In addition, {{more research is needed to}} identify the underlying mechanisms. This would be of particular interest in women undergoing IVF to pinpoint the effects of thyroid hormone on different parameters of reproductio...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to harness the power of bacterial phage display to develop a <b>biological</b> <b>amplifier</b> for the detection of small numbers of pathogenic organisms in potable water and foods. The basic approach consists of the insertion of a second copy of a gene coding for a surface protein modified to express a predetermined binding epitope. Amplification of the recombinant phage is performed in a genetically modified host which suppresses expression of the modified surface protein. Subsequent infection of a wild type host using the modified parent phage results in progeny which are distinguishable from the parent and can be detected using immunoassays. Proof of principle experiments of this technology utilizes M 13, an E. coli F 2 ̆ 7 bacteriophage. In these experiments a second copy of the gIII modified to mimic biotin is inserted into the M 13 multicloning site controlled by the induction of the IPTG-inducible lac promoter. This allows the suppression of the second copy of the surface protein in the absence of IPTG. Experiments to determine the presence of host microorganisms will be performed in the presence of IPTG, resulting in amplification of progeny displaying the unique epitope. A Salmonella detection assay is currently being developed by modifying bacteriophage P 22 using a similar approach as described for M 13. The displayed epitope for P 22 is a 6 xHis tag sequence consisting of 6 histidine residues, which will be inserted at the carboxy terminus of a second copy of the tail spike protein gene under control of the lac promoter. A Salmonella strain containing a functional lac repressor expressed at levels high enough to suppress the lac-controlled 6 xHis tail spike protein must be used to generate the phage for the assay. The resultant phage will still be infectious but will only produce the tailspike protein upon infection of a wild type Salmonella. This platform potentially can be expanded to numerous pathogen-specific phages with different epitopes to allow detection of multiple pathogens in the same sample. 1 slide Related Documents:WM 1, WM 2, WM 3, WM...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: While the {{relationships}} among socio-economic status (SES) and obesity are powerful and synergistic, the SES construct is insufficient to describe some of the cultural influences on status production in society, and therefore on obesity production. Socio-economic status has two closely related dimensions. The economic one is represented by financial wealth while the social one can incorporate education, occupational prestige, authority and community standing. These are, however, incomplete explanations for {{the relationships}} between societal inequalities and obesity. DISCUSSION: Cultural factors associated with SES and obesity are examined here by using Bourdieu and Boltanski's theory of practice, which links economic, social and cultural forms of capital (or value) in an overarching category of symbolic capital. These represent categories through which power relationships within society are negotiated. This construct permits a more complete examination of societal stratification and its human <b>biological</b> consequences and <b>amplifiers,</b> since it incorporates the notion of cultural value in different groups of, for example, preferences in body size and shape. The focus is primarily on the USA, although it draws on literature from elsewhere {{in the industrialized world}} where appropriate. Differences in obesity rates across major ethnic groups are discussed, because this is an area in which forms of capital differ, and may offer new insights into obesity and factors that predispose to it, as forms of symbolic capital...|$|R
30|$|In {{the past}} decades, {{inorganic}} luminescent materials with nanosale dimensions {{have been found}} many potential applications, such as light emitting devices, low-threshold lasers, optical <b>amplifiers,</b> <b>biological</b> fluorescence labeling, and so on [1 – 4]. However, due to nonradiative decay from defects {{on the surface of}} the nanocrystals, the luminescence efficiency of nanostructural materials is usually lower than that of the corresponding bulk materials [5, 6]. To reduce these defects, the growth of a crystalline shell of a suitable inorganic material around each nanocrystal to form the core/shell structures has been regarded as an effective strategy to improve luminescent efficiency. Compared with the conventional oxide-based luminescent materials, fluorides are advantageous as fluorescent host materials owing to their low vibrational energies, and the subsequent minimization of the quenching of the excited state of the rare-earth ions [7]. Hence, Lanthanide fluorides have attracted considerable attention because of their outstanding luminescent characteristics that originate from good coordination capability of hosted lanthanide ions in fluoride lattices and the wide band gap and very low vibrational energies induced by the high ionicity of the lanthanide to fluoride bond [8 – 13]. A bulk crystal of CeF 3 possesses a hexagonal phase structure with a space group of P 63 /mcm (JSPDS 08 - 0045) and lattice constants a = 0.713 nm, c = 0.729 nm, and there are six formula weights per unit cell. The Ce 3 + ion in the CeF 3 crystal is coordinated by nine F− and has a C 2 site symmetry [9]. As a potential scintillator and tunable laser material, CeF 3 is a luminescent material with 100 % activator concentration. Moreover, the material CeF 3 : Eu 3 + has red luminescence property, the energy transfer processes from Ce 3 + to Eu 3 + can enhance the Eu 3 + emission, which has gained a great deal of research interest.|$|R
