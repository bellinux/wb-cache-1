5|$|The main CPU of the Sega CD is a 12.5MHz 16-bit Motorola 68000 processor, {{which runs}} 5MHz {{faster than the}} Genesis processor. It {{contains}} 1 Mbit of boot ROM, allocated for the CD game BIOS, CD player software, and compatibility with CD+G discs. 6 Mbit of RAM are allocated to data for programs, pictures, and sounds; 512 Kbit to PCM waveform memory; 128 Kbit to CD-ROM data cache memory; and an additional 64 Kbit are allocated as the <b>backup</b> <b>memory.</b> Additional <b>backup</b> <b>memory</b> {{in the form of}} a 1 Mbit Backup RAM Cartridge was also available as a separate purchase, released near the end of the system's life. Audio is able to be supplied through the Ricoh RF5C164, and two RCA pin jacks allow the Sega CD to output stereophonic sound separate from the Genesis. Combining stereo sound from a Genesis to either version of the Sega CD requires a cable between the Genesis's headphone jack and an input jack on the back of the CD unit. This is not required for the second model of the Genesis.|$|E
500|$|The Dreamcast {{controller}} {{includes both}} an analog stick and a digital pad, four action buttons, and two analog triggers. The system has four ports for controller inputs, {{although it was}} bundled with only one controller. The design of the Dreamcast's controller, described by the staff of Edge as [...] "an ugly evolution of Saturn's 3D controller," [...] was called [...] " [...] that great" [...] by 1UP.com's Sam Kennedy and [...] "lame" [...] by Game Informers Andy McNamara. [...] The staff of IGN wrote that [...] "unlike most controllers, Sega's pad forces the user's hands into an uncomfortable parallel position." [...] In contrast to the Sega CD and Sega Saturn, which included internal <b>backup</b> <b>memory,</b> the Dreamcast uses a 128 kbyte memory card called the VMU (or [...] "Visual Memory Unit") for data storage. The VMU features a small LCD screen, audio output from a one-channel PWM sound source, non-volatile memory, a directional pad, and four buttons. The VMU can present game information, {{be used as a}} minimal handheld gaming device, and connect to certain Sega arcade machines. [...] For example, players use the VMU to call plays in NFL 2K or raise virtual pets in Sonic Adventure. Sega officials noted that the VMU could be used [...] "as a private viewing area, the absence of which has prevented effective implementation of many types of games in the past." [...] After a VMU slot was incorporated into the controller's design, Sega's engineers found many additional uses for it, so a second slot was added. This slot was generally used for vibration packs providing force feedback like Sega's [...] "Jump Pack" [...] and Performance's [...] "Tremor Pack", although it could also be used for other peripherals including a microphone enabling voice control and player communication. Various third-party cards provide storage, and some contain the LCD screen addition.

It is revealed that eons before the Autobots and Decepticons existed, Cybertron was also inhabited by the Predacons, powerful dragon-like Transformers that became extinct on Cybertron due to an event referred to as [...] "the Great Cataclysm" [...] by Shockwave long before recorded Cybertronian history began. Cybertron's core is stated by Ratchet as being Primus himself during the season one finale. Vector Sigma is also tied into the Matrix of Leadership and Primus, being claimed to be a form of 'memory backup' for all who have possessed the Matrix, though the manner in which this is achieved is left unexplained.

50|$|Whilst Goal {{is still}} asleep, Rufus {{attempts}} {{to find a way}} to the upper platform to meet Cletus. After revealing that this was where his father left him (to leave for Elysium), he begins to search around. Once he has reprogrammed a lift, and risen to the top platform, Rufus overhears a conversation between Cletus and Argus in which it is revealed that they are plotting together, and that Goal is only needed because there is information stored in her malfunctioning brain implant. The Prime Controller, Ulysses, is also in on the plot. Rufus follows Cletus, with whom he shares a striking resemblance, eventually confronting him and discovering that Deponia is to be blown up, and that Cletus is in possession of a <b>backup</b> <b>memory</b> implant for Goal which contains no memory of it. Rufus declares that he hates Deponia in a similar style to that of his father. He then tries to head back down, only to be stopped by Argus, who he can't pass by for fear of the Organon. Disguising himself as Cletus, Rufus is able to slip through, only to discover that Goal is missing. After following the trail, he ends up at Captain Bozo's Trash heap, where he is reunited with Goal and Doc. After sorting out her implants, Goal awakens, and is brought up to date by Rufus. They discuss their plan, and return to the station, taking out a group of soldiers with the crane. After taking care of Cletus, Goal and Rufus ascend to Elysium, while Rufus comes clean about everything to Goal, who demands her memory implant back. Rufus returns to the planet, where he meets Cletus again and gives him the memory cartridge. Goal wakes up, and she and Cletus return to Elysium. Argus decides not to let Rufus go because he knows too much, and so Rufus returns to Captain Bozo.|$|E

40|$|With the {{increasing}} number of components and further miniaturization the mean time between faults in supercomputers will decrease. System level fault tolerance techniques are expensive and cost energy, since they are often based on redundancy. Also classical check-point-restart techniques reach their limits when the time for storing the system state to <b>backup</b> <b>memory</b> becomes excessive. Therefore, algorithm-based fault tolerance mechanisms can become an attractive alternative. This article investigates the solution process for elliptic partial differential equations that are discretized by finite elements. Faults that occur in the parallel geometric multigrid solver are studied in various model scenarios. In a standard domain partitioning approach, the impact of a failure of a core or a node will affect one or several subdomains. Different strategies are developed to compensate the effect of such a failure algorithmically. The recovery is achieved by solving a local subproblem with Dirichlet boundary conditions using local multigrid cycling algorithms. Additionally, we propose a superman strategy where extra compute power is employed to minimize the time of the recovery process...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Microprocessor {{memory is}} {{sensitive}} to cold boot attacks. In this kind of attacks, memory remanence is exploited to download its content after the microprocessor has been struck by a hard boot. If just in this moment, a crypto-algorithm was in execution, the memory data can be downloaded into a <b>backup</b> <b>memory</b> and specialized tools {{can be used to}} extract the secret keys. In the main memory data can be protected using efficient encryption techniques but in caches this is not possible unless the performance becomes seriously degraded. Recently, an interleaved scrambling technique (IST) was presented to improve the security of caches against cold boot attacks. While IST is effective for this particular kind of attacks, a weakness exists against side channel attacks, in particular using power analysis. Reliability of data in caches is warranted by means of error detecting and correcting codes. In this work it is shown how these kinds of codes can be used not only to improve reliability but also the security of data. In particular, a self-healing technique is selected to make the IST technique robust against side channel attacks using power analysis...|$|E

40|$|Ultracapacitor {{is one of}} {{most popular}} device for energy storage system because of it {{capability}} that have high charge/discharge efficiency, can operate at high current, have long life cycle and no chemical reaction involve in store and release of energy. Ultracapacitor modelling {{is important for the}} electrical system analysis and equipment design. An efficient and high accuracy model can help electrical engineers thoroughly understand ultracapacitor’s characteristics. A commercial ultracapacitor cell is characterized under standard procedures to assess its performance. This project focuses on the analysis and modelling of ultracapacitor cell characteristic. Two experiments involve which are charging/discharging test and AC Impedance test. The charge / discharge test is to determine ultracapacitor cell ability on charge and discharge performance. AC impedance test/ Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is to measure the complex impedance of ultracapacitor. The purpose of the test is to determine capacitance and equivalent series resistance. Based on experiment result, parameters and analysis, the equivalent circuit model of ultracapacitor is proposed. After that, the proposed model is simulated with MATLAB/Simulink and EIS Spectrum Analyser for verification. Then, the simulation result carried out is analysed and compared with experiment results. Based on ultracapacitor characteristic, the electrical circuit modelling was present in this thesis and can be used for power electronic, <b>backup</b> <b>memory,</b> heavy transportation application, hybrid electric vehicles and as power back up for UPS application...|$|E
40|$|Digital {{simulation}} is {{a useful}} tool in many scientific areas. Interactive simulation can provide the user with a better appreciation of a problem area. With the introduction of large scale integrated circuits {{and in particular the}} advent of the microprocessor, a large amount of computing power is available at low cost. The aim of this project therefore was to investigate the feasibility of producing a minimum cost, easy to use, interactive digital simulation system. A hardware microcomputer system was constructed to test simulation program concepts and an interactive program was designed and developed for this system. By the use of a set of commands and subsequent interactive dialogue, the program allows the user to enter and perform simulation tasks. The simulation program is unusual in that it does not require a sophisticated operating system or other system programs such as compilers. The program does not require any <b>backup</b> <b>memory</b> devices such as magnetic disc or tape and indeed could be stored in ROM or EPROM. The program is designed to be flexible and extendable and could be easily modified to run with a variety of hardware configurations.
