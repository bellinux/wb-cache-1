He {{designed}} 18 <b>balloons</b> <b>and</b> <b>dirigibles</b> before turning his attention to fixed-winged aircraft.On 19 October 1901 he flew his airship Number 6, a small semi-rigid with a detached keel, from the Parc Saint Cloud to and around the Eiffel Tower and back in under thirty minutes. This feat earned him the Deutsch de la Meurthe prize of 100,000 francs. Many inventors were inspired by Santos-Dumont's small airships and a veritable airship craze began worldwide. Many airship pioneers, such as the American Thomas Scott Baldwin, financed their activities through passenger flights and public demonstration flights. Stanley Spencer built the first British airship with funds from advertising baby food {{on the sides of}} the envelope. Others, such as Walter Wellman and Melvin Vaniman, set their sights on loftier goals, attempting two polar flights in 1907 and 1909, and two trans-Atlantic flights in 1910 and 1912.In 1902, the Spanish engineer Leonardo Torres Quevedo published details of an innovative airship design in Spain and France. With a non-rigid body and internal bracing wires, it overcame the flaws of these types of aircraft as regards both rigid structure (zeppelin type) and flexibility, providing the airships with more stability during flight, and the capability of using heavier engines and a greater passenger load. In 1905, helped by Captain A. Kindelán, he built the airship [...] "España" [...] at the Guadalajara military base. Next year he patented his design without attracting official interest. In 1909 he patented an improved design which he offered to the French Astra company, who started mass-producing it in 1911 as the Astra-Torres airship. The distinctive three-lobed design was widely used during the Great War by the Entente powers.|$|E

50|$|World War I had {{introduced}} {{the use of}} aircraft to military operations and naval aviation was also still in its infancy.

Although the use of airborne platforms, such as hot air <b>balloons,</b> blimps, <b>and</b> <b>dirigibles</b> gained increasing acceptance among the armed forces of the world, winged aircraft were a new technology whose effectiveness as a weapon had yet to be proved. While serving in France during 1917, Mitchell encountered Sir Hugh Trenchard, commander of the Royal Flying Corps. Trenchard held the belief that an independent air force could be a highly effective weapon against an enemy. In September 1918, when he led 1,481 American and Allied aircraft, Mitchell effectively put Trenchard’s concept into action. At St. Mihiel, France, American and Allied planes decimated their German counterparts to establish air superiority, and then proceeded {{to take part in the}} destruction of the German forces on the ground.

At an aviation meet in St. Louis fellow enthusiasts discussed the possibility of holding an air meet in Los Angeles. This group, which included Charles Willard, Roy Knabenshue, and Glenn Curtiss, followed through on the proposed project and sent Dick Ferris to Los Angeles to make the preliminary contacts and finalize the plans for the proposed Air Meet. After arriving in Los Angeles Ferris met with various contacts and an International Air Meet was proposed which would include Louis Paulhan-a renowned French aviator. The location was selected, Dominguez Field, which was part of one of the original Spanish land grants-The Rancho San Pedro. Publicity was begun, grandstands were erected and an expanded passenger platform was constructed at the Pacific Electric Station located closest to the Air Meet site to accommodate the large number of spectators expected to attend the event. Dates for the Air Meet were agreed upon. Commencing on January 10 th, 1910 and lasting ten days until January 20 th the air meet would invite a variety of participants and would include not only aeroplanes but also hot air <b>balloons</b> <b>and</b> <b>dirigibles.</b> Cash prizes would be awarded to those participating in scheduled events, which would include altitude, speed, and endurance competitions. " [...] ; Peter Bergen (part 1 of 2).; "Over the ten-day period of the air meet spectators were thrilled by the performances of aviators Louis Paulhan, Glenn Curtiss, Charles Willard, and others. Paulhan was the "star attraction" at the air meet. Invited by the organizers to participate, Paulhan brought with him to the event two Bleriot Monoplanes, Two Farman Biplanes, and an entourage, which included his wife and black poodle dog. At the air meet he set a new altitude record (4164 ft.), endurance record (64 miles in 1 hr. 49 mins. 40 secs.), and won $ 14, 000 in prize money. Glenn Curtiss won two events-fastest speeds with a passenger (55 mph) and quickest start (6 2 / 5 secs. covering 98 ft.). Curtiss took home $ 6500 in prize money. Charles Willard was credited with the most accurate take off and landing skills for which he receive a prize totaling $ 250. Attendance at the air meet reached and surpassed all expectations. During the ten-day period of the air meet an estimated 226, 000 spectators converged on Dominguez Field. Gate receipts for the event equaled over $ 137, 500. The air meet was considered a phenomenal success and helped to alleviate a perceived economic drought in the Los Angeles area. " [...] Peter Bergen (part 2 of 2) ...|$|E
