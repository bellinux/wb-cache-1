5|$|The {{second book}} is largely {{devoted to the}} {{respective}} roles of faith and philosophical argument. Clement contends that while both are important, the fear of God is foremost, because through faith one receives divine wisdom. To Clement, scripture is an innately true primitive philosophy which is complemented by human reason through the Logos. Faith is voluntary, and the decision to <b>believe</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> crucial fundamental step in becoming closer to God. It is never irrational, as it is founded on {{the knowledge of the}} truth of the Logos, but all knowledge proceeds from faith, as first principles are unprovable outside a systematic structure.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the year}} 2000, taxonomic studies using cladistical {{analyses}} of multiple organ systems, shell morphology (including fossil species) and modern molecular phylogenetics {{have resulted in}} the drawing up of what experts <b>believe</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> more accurate phylogeny of the Bivalvia. Based upon these studies, a new proposed classification system for the Bivalvia was published in 2010 by Bieler, Carter & Coan. In 2012, this new system was adopted by the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) for the classification of the Bivalvia. Some experts still maintain that Anomalodesmacea should be considered a separate subclass, whereas the new system treats it as the order Anomalodesmata, within the subclass Heterodonta. Molecular phylogenetic work continues, further clarifying which Bivalvia are most closely related and thus refining the classification.|$|E

25|$|Dating {{to around}} c. 13,000BC, a cave {{painting}} in the Trois Frères cave in France depicts what some <b>believe</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> musical bow, a hunting bow used as a single-stringed musical instrument. From the musical bow, families of stringed instruments developed; since each string played a single note, adding strings added new notes, creating bow harps, harps and lyres. In turn, this led {{to being able to}} play dyads and chords. Another innovation occurred when the bow harp was straightened out and a bridge used to lift the strings off the stick-neck, creating the lute.|$|E

25|$|Defeating ISIS: Who They Are, How They Fight, What They <b>Believe</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> non-fiction {{book about}} counterterrorism against ISIS. It {{was written by}} Malcolm Nance, a former {{cryptology}} analyst, with a foreword by Richard Engel. Nance's thesis in the work is that ISIS {{is not part of}} Islam, and instead functions as destructive extremist group. He emphasizes a majority of those harmed by ISIS are themselves Muslim. The book traces the history of the movement from Al-Qaeda in Iraq, and discusses their combat and recruiting tactics. Nance offers a four-point plan to defeat ISIS, including airpower and special forces, Internet tactics, strengthening the Syrian military, and engaging Arab world states.|$|E
25|$|In {{comparison}} to monolinguals, bilinguals have {{shown to have}} a better recovery after stroke. As with Alzheimer's patients, bilingual patients who have suffered an ischemic stroke have shown {{to have a better}} cognitive outcome which researchers believe is due to a higher cognitive reserve. This increase of cognitive reserve might be attributed to the increase of grey matter in bilingual individuals. Since bilingual individuals have to constantly change and inhibit a language, the brain is more used to brain training and has been able to optimize better the space it uses. Brain training has led researchers to <b>believe</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> factor that helps stroke patients recover faster and better. Bilingual individuals then are able to benefit more from rehabilitation after stroke compared to monolingual patients because the brain has a higher plasticity ability that allows for a better remodeling of the brain after stroke. Stroke patients (bilinguals) with aphasia also perform better in other cognitive tasks that measure attention and ability to organize and retrieve information. This is attributed again to the increase of grey matter since it is involved in cognitive control and higher cognitive functions that are more present in bilinguals. This is relevant since in some patients the automatization of language is impaired, highly correlated to basal ganglia lesions and anterior parietal cortex. Although it is uncommon for patients to lose automatization of the first language, basal ganglia lesions have been correlated to loss of automatization of language, which fits with the role of basal ganglia in automatized motor and cognitive performance. This is more evident with patients who have acquired a second language at a later age since studies suggest that late bilingual aphasics' syntactic judgment abilities may be more impaired for the second language. Acquisition of language at a later age changes the mapping of language in the brain since the languages do not overlap. This difference in mapping seems to be a contributing factor in recovery for patients with bilingual aphasia since there are second language-restricted zones that are dedicated to the first language.|$|E
25|$|The {{ordinary}} Bohra {{is highly}} conscious of his identity, {{and this is}} especially demonstrated at religious and traditional occasions by the appearance and attire of the participants. Dawoodi Bohra men wear a traditional white three-piece outfit, plus a white and gold cap (called a topi), and women wear the rida, a distinctive form of the commonly known burqa which is distinguished from other forms of the veil due to it often being in color and decorated with patterns and lace. The rida's difference from the burqa, however, is significant beyond just the colour, pattern and lace. The rida does not call for covering of women's faces like the traditional veil. It has a flap called the 'pardi' that usually hangs on the back like {{the hood of a}} jacket but it is not used to conceal the face. This is representative of the Dawoodi Bohra community's values of equality and justice for women, which they <b>believe,</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> tenet of the Fatimid Imamate's evolved understanding of Islam and the true meaning of women's chastity in Islam. The Dawoodi Bohra community also do not prevent their women from coming to mosques, attending religious gatherings or going to places of pilgrimage. It is often regarded as the most peaceful sect of Islam and an example of true Sufism; it has been critically acclaimed on several occasions even by Western governments such as those of the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden and particularly the United States for its progressive outlook towards gender roles, adoption of technology, promotion of literature, crafts, business and secular values. However, the Dawoodi Bohras are highly single-minded about inter-caste or inter-faith marriage. They do not oppose it but do not encourage it either. If a Dawoodi Bohra member does marry into another caste or religion, he or she is usually advised to ask his or her spouse to convert to Islam and, specifically, into the community.|$|E

500|$|The {{two parts}} of [...] "Stress Relief" [...] ran an hour long (including commercials), {{compared}} to the typical half-hour length of most The Office episodes.
