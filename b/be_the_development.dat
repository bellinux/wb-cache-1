5|$|Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex was {{originally}} intended to be designed by Mark Cerny, who had designed all the games in the series thus far, and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. The game under Cerny's direction {{was to be a}} free-roaming title with puzzle elements that would see Crash travelling between different planets. In early 2000, when Universal approached Traveller's Tales to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> team behind the game, they produced a 3-D rendered demo of Crash running through a volcanic level. Development of the game's engine began in mid-2000.|$|E

Rarely, {{the first sign of}} leukemia may <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> of a solid leukemic mass or tumor outside of the bone marrow, called a chloroma. Occasionally, a person may show no symptoms, and the leukemia may be discovered incidentally during a routine blood test.|$|E
5|$|Because Irenaeus saw {{the purpose}} of the world to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> of the moral {{character}} of humans, he believed that a good world would be best suited to that purpose. Irenaeaus believed that this world would include some suffering and evil to help people draw closer to God. He perceived God's declaration in the Book of Genesis that his creation was good to mean that the world is fit for purpose, rather than being free from suffering. To illustrate the benefits of suffering, Irenaeus cited the Biblical example of Jonah, from the Book of Jonah. His suffering, being swallowed by a whale, both enabled God's plan to be fulfilled and also brought Jonah closer to God: Jonah ended up repenting for his sin and the people of Nineveh turn to God.|$|E

25|$|Peptic {{ulcer disease}} had a {{tremendous}} effect on morbidity and mortality until the last decades of the 20th century when epidemiological trends started to point to an impressive fall in its incidence.

25|$|In {{that same}} year, a leaked U.S. {{diplomatic}} cable revealed Argentine concerns related to Brazilian nuclear ambitions. It {{stated that the}} Argentine foreign ministry was thinking about what Argentina’s reaction should be in case Brazil backed out of ABACC or developed a nuclear weapon. According to the document, one of the responses under consideration by Buenos Aires could <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> and deployment of advanced peaceful nuclear technology—such as a nuclear-powered icebreaker—to demonstrate capacity. ABACC did not comment, but one of its Brazilian officials stated that the information expressed in the leaked cable was contrary to the Brazilian–Argentine experience, which was enshrined in mutual trust.|$|E
25|$|In {{the medieval}} period (500-1400) in Europe, {{there were a}} variety of {{authority}} forms throughout the region. These included feudal lords, empires, religious authorities, free cities, and other authorities. Often dated to the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, there began to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> in Europe of modern states with large-scale capacity for taxation, coercive control of their populations, and advanced bureaucracies. The state became prominent in Europe {{over the next few}} centuries before the particular form of the state spread {{to the rest of the}} world via the colonial and international pressures of the 19th century and 20th century. Other modern states developed in Africa and Asia prior to colonialism, but were largely displaced by colonial rule.|$|E

25|$|The Mishnah {{teaches the}} oral traditions by example, {{presenting}} actual cases {{being brought to}} judgment, usually along with {{the debate on the}} matter and the judgment that was given by a notable rabbi based on halakha, mitzvot, and spirit of the teaching ("Torah") that guided his decision. In this way, it brings to everyday reality the practice of the mitzvot as presented in the Torah, and aims to cover all aspects of human living, serve as an example for future judgments, and, most important, demonstrate pragmatic exercise of the Biblical laws, which was much needed since the time when the Second Temple was destroyed (70 CE). The Mishnah does not claim to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> of new laws, but rather the collection of existing traditions.|$|E
500|$|The intense {{radiation}} of most observed GRBs {{is believed}} to be released during a supernova or hypernova as a rapidly rotating, high-mass star collapses to form a neutron star, quark star, or black hole. A subclass of GRBs (the [...] "short" [...] bursts) appear to originate from a different process: the merger of binary neutron stars. The cause of the precursor burst observed in some of these short events may <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> of a resonance between the crust and core of such stars {{as a result of the}} massive tidal forces experienced in the seconds leading up to their collision, causing the entire crust of the star to shatter.|$|E

2500|$|... "What is {{the purpose}} of science?" [...] is the {{question}} repeatedly asked in Poincaré's book. To this teleological problem, Poincaré responds by taking the opposite position from that of Édouard Le Roy, philosopher and mathematician, who argued in a 1905 article (Sur la logique de l'invention, [...] "On the logic of invention") that science is intrinsically anti-intellectual (in the sense of Henri Bergson) and nominalistic. In contrast to Le Roy, Poincaré follows the thought of Pierre Duhem. He explains that the notion that science is anti-intellectual is self-contradictory, and that the accusation of nominalism can be strongly criticized, because it rests on confusions of thoughts and definitions. He defends the idea of conventional principles, and the idea that scientific activity is not merely a set of conventions arranged arbitrarily around the raw observations of experiment. He wishes rather to demonstrate that objectivity in science comes precisely {{from the fact that the}} scientist does no more than translate raw facts into a particular language: [...] "(...) tout ce que crée le savant dans un fait, c'est le langage dans lequel il l'énonce". The only contribution of science would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> of a more and more mathematized language, a coherent language because it offers predictions which are useful – but not certain, as they remain forever subject to comparisons with real observations, and are always fallible.|$|E
60|$|Just as far {{as these}} reform efforts succeed and develop is the {{organisation}} of the United States of America into a great, self-conscious, civilised nation, unparalleled in the world's history, possible; just {{as far as}} they fail is failure written over the American future.

60|$|It must {{be remembered}} that a modern Utopia must differ from the Utopias of any {{preceding}} age in being world-wide; it is not, therefore, to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> of any special race or type of culture, as Plato's developed an Athenian-Spartan blend, or More, Tudor England. The modern Utopia is to be, before all things, synthetic. Politically and socially, as linguistically, we must suppose it a synthesis; politically {{it will be a}} synthesis of once widely different forms of government; socially and morally, a synthesis of a great variety of domestic traditions and ethical habits. Into the modern Utopia there must have entered the mental tendencies and origins that give our own world the polygamy of the Zulus and of Utah, the polyandry of Tibet, the latitudes of experiment permitted in the United States, and the divorceless wedlock of Comte. The tendency of all synthetic processes in matters of law and custom is to reduce and simplify the compulsory canon, to admit alternatives and freedoms; what were laws before become traditions of feeling and style, and in no matter will this be more apparent than in questions affecting the relations of the sexes.|$|E

60|$|In Mr. Max Muller's opinion these riddles 'could not but lead {{to what we}} call popular myths or legends.' Very probably; {{but this}} does not aid us to accept the {{philological}} method. The very essence of that method is the presumed absolute loss of the meaning of, e.g. 'the Dark One.' Before there can be a myth, ex hypothesi the words Dark One must have become hopelessly unintelligible, must have become a proper name. Thus suppose, for argument's sake only, that Cronos once meant Dark One, and was understood in that sense. People (as in the Norse riddle just cited) said, 'Cronos [i.e. the Dark One--meaning mist] swallows water and wood.' Then they forgot that Cronos was their old word for the Dark One, and was mist; but they kept up, and understood, {{all the rest of the}} phrase about what mist does. The expression now ran, 'Cronos [whatever that may be] swallows water and wood.' But water comes from mist, and water nourishes wood, therefore 'Cronos swallows his children.' Such would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> of a myth on Mr. Max Muller's system. He would interpret 'Cronos swallows his children,' by finding, if he could, the original meaning of Cronos. Let us say that he did discover it to mean 'the Dark One.' Then he might think Cronos meant 'night;' 'mist' he would hardly guess.|$|E
