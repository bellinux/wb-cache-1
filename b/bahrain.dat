5|$|<b>Bahrain</b> is {{the site}} of the ancient Dilmun civilisation. It has been famed since antiquity for its pearl fisheries, which were {{considered}} {{the best in the world}} into the 19th century. <b>Bahrain</b> was one of the earliest areas to convert to Islam (628). Following a period of Arab rule, <b>Bahrain</b> was occupied by the Portuguese in 1521, who in turn were expelled in 1602 by Shah Abbas I of the Safavid dynasty under the Persian Empire. In 1783, the Bani Utbah clan captured <b>Bahrain</b> from Nasr Al-Madhkur and it has since been ruled by the Al Khalifa royal family, with Ahmed al Fateh as Bahrain's first hakim.

Formerly an emirate, <b>Bahrain</b> was declared a Kingdom in 2002. In 2011, the country experienced protests inspired by the regional Arab Spring.|$|E

Eventually the Government of British India overpowered <b>Bahrain</b> when the Persians refused to protect it. Colonel Pelly signed a new treaty with Al Khalifas placing <b>Bahrain</b> under British rule and protection.|$|E

5|$|Unrest {{amongst the}} people of <b>Bahrain</b> began when Britain officially {{established}} complete dominance over the territory in 1892.

5|$|About 92% of <b>Bahrain</b> is desert with {{periodic}} droughts {{and dust}} storms, the main natural hazards for Bahrainis. Environmental issues facing <b>Bahrain</b> include desertification {{resulting from the}} degradation of limited arable land, coastal degradation (damage to coastlines, coral reefs, and sea vegetation) resulting from oil spills and other discharges from large tankers, oil refineries, distribution stations, and illegal land reclamation at places such as Tubli Bay. The agricultural and domestic sectors' over-utilisation of the Dammam Aquifer, the principal aquifer in <b>Bahrain,</b> has led to its salinisation by adjacent brackish and saline water bodies. A hydrochemical study identified {{the locations of the}} sources of aquifer salinisation and delineated their areas of influence. The investigation indicates that the aquifer water quality is significantly modified as groundwater flows from the northwestern parts of <b>Bahrain,</b> where the aquifer receives its water by lateral underflow from eastern Saudi Arabia, to the southern and southeastern parts. Four types of salinisation of the aquifer are identified: brackish-water up-flow from the underlying brackish-water zones in north-central, western, and eastern regions; seawater intrusion in the eastern region; intrusion of sabkha water in the southwestern region; and irrigation return flow in a local area in the western region. Four alternatives for the management of groundwater quality that are available to the water authorities in <b>Bahrain</b> are discussed and their priority areas are proposed, based on the type and extent of each salinisation source, in addition to groundwater use in that area.|$|E
5|$|According to Rajab, {{he became}} {{involved}} in organized human rights activities during the 1990s uprising in <b>Bahrain.</b> In 1996 Rajab discussed the idea of setting up a human rights organization with Ali Rabea and Ibrahim Kamal Al Den. They introduced him to Salman Kamal Al Den, Sabeeka Al Najjar, Mohammed Al Motawa and other colleagues with whom they held secret meetings.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, Qur'anic schools (Kuttab) were the only form of education in <b>Bahrain.</b> They were traditional schools aimed at teaching children and youth the reading of the Qur'an.
