Two nozzle types have been investigated,a standard WC/Co nozzle which is used for soldering applications and a novelceramic nozzle. Applications for active piezoceramic components integrated in structural parts are e. g. active damping, energy harvesting, or monitoring of vibrations and material failure. Anup to now unsolved problem is the electrical contacting of such components without damaging the conductor or the metallization of the ceramic substrate. Since piezoelectric components are to be integrated into structures made of casted aluminum, requirements are high mechanical strength and temperature resistance. Within this paper a method forcontacting piezoceramic modules is presented. A spherical <b>braze</b> <b>preform</b> of tin bronze Cu 89 Sn 11 with a diameter of 600 μm {{is located in a}} ceramic nozzle and is subsequently melted by a laser pulse. The liquid solder is ejected from the nozzlevia nitrogen overpressure and wets the surface of the metallization pad and the Cu-wire, resulting in a brazing joint after solidification. The process is called laser droplet brazing (LDB). To asses the thermal evolution during one cycle WC/Co and ZTA have been simulated numerically for two different geometries enabling a proposition weather the geometry or the material properties have a significant influence on the thermal load during one cycle. To evaluate the influence of the nozzle on the joint the positioning accuracy, joint height and detachment times have been evaluated. Results obtained with the ZTA nozzle show comparable positioning accuracies to a WC/Co nozzle with a lower standard deviation of solder detachment time...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of piezoelectric transducers to structural body parts of machines or vehicles enables {{the combination of}} passive mechanical components with sensor and actuator functions in one single structure. According to Herold et al. [1] and Staeves [2] this approach indicates significant potential regarding smart lightweight construction. To obtain the highest yield, the piezoelectric transducers need to {{be integrated into the}} flux of forces (load path) of load bearing structures. Application in a downstream process reduces yield and process efficiency during manufacturing and operation, due to the necessity of a subsequent process step of sensor/actuator application. The die casting process offers the possibility for integration of piezoelectric transducers into metal structures. Aluminum castings are particularly favorable due to their high quality and feasibility for high unit production at low cost (Brunhuber [3], Nogowizin [4]). Such molded aluminum parts with integrated piezoelectric transducers enable functions like active vibration damping, structural health monitoring or energy harvesting resulting in significant possibilities of weight reduction, which is an increasingly important driving force of automotive and aerospace industry (Klein [5], Siebenpfeiffer [6]) due to increasingly stringent environmental protection laws. In the scope of those developments, this paper focuses on the entire process chain enabling the generation of lightweight metal structures with sensor and actuator function, starting from the manufacturing of piezoelectric modules over electrical and mechanical bonding to the integration of such modules into aluminum (Al) matrices by die casting. To achieve this challenging goal, piezoceramic sensors/actuator modules, so-called LTCC/PZT modules (LPM) were developed, since ceramic based piezoelectric modules are more likely to withstand the thermal stress of about 700  °C introduced by the casting process (Flössel et al., [7]). The modules are made of low temperature cofired ceramic (LTCC) tapes with an embedded lead zirconate titanate (PZT) plate and are manufactured in multilayer technique. For joining conducting copper (Cu) wires with the electrode structure of the LPM, a novel laser drop on demand wire bonding method (LDB) is applied, which is based on the melting of a spherical CuSn 12 <b>braze</b> <b>preform</b> with a liquidus temperature Tliquid of 989. 9  °C (Deutsches Kupfer-Institut Düsseldorf, [8]) providing sufficient thermal stability for a subsequent casting process.

40|$|Rheological {{and thermal}} {{properties}} of LD-PE and LD-PE + 65 vol% Ni composite were examined by viscosity, pvt and thermal conductivity measurements at {{a wide range}} of shear rate, temperature and pressure. The typical shear-thinning viscosity of LD-PE polymer melt was enhanced up to four times by adding 65 vol% Ni braze metal particles. LD-PE show increasing specific volume versus temperature, decreasing with pressure and braze particle filler content. Variation of specific volume of LD-PE was reduced to 5 % by admixing 65 vol% rigid Ni braze metal particles. Thermal conductivity of LD-PE was increased up to 15 times in the composite, reduced by decreasing pressure at temperature exceeding 80 ℃. Furthermore, thermal analysis was performed in modulated DSC to determine the specific heat capacity in wide temperature range. Viscosity and pvt-data were fitted using Cross-WLF equation and 2 -domain Tait-pvt model, respectively. Simulation of LD-PE and LD-PE + 65 vol% Ni composite was performed based on rheological and thermal properties to define processing parameters.
