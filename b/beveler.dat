5000|$|The shop under Leonard created proteges {{who went}} on to become rod making greats in their own rite. Such names as: Hiram Hawes, F.E. Thomas, E.W. Edwards, E.F. Payne, Fred Devine and George I. Varney all worked for Leonard. In 1875 H.L. Leonard {{patented}} the water-proof ferrule, and Leonard rods became among the first to be made on a commercial <b>beveler.</b> It was while working with employee Loman Hawes, that they first developed the [...] "revolutionary" [...] <b>beveler.</b> It allowed Leonard to dramatically increase production as well as increase the quality and consistency of his product. Before this time, fly rods varied greatly rod to rod. Manufacturing was difficult due to the imprecision of the tools available. With his new <b>beveler,</b> Leonard was able to hold tolerances to thousands of an inch. The series of measurements, known as 'tapers', he used as the templates for beveling his rods became standards for every rodmaker thereafter.|$|E
50|$|After shading is {{completed}} with the Pear Shader, the <b>Beveler</b> {{is used to}} compress {{one side of the}} cut. This creates the impression of depth by pressing down parts of the image relative to the foreground. The <b>Beveler</b> is used by holding it vertically, with the foot of the tool in contact with the leather, and striking it lightly with the rawhide mallet. The tool is then moved forward along the cut about half its width, and struck again with the mallet. This process {{is completed}} until {{the entire length of the}} cut has been appropriately beveled.|$|E
50|$|He did {{not make}} only the rods, the H.L. Leonard rod company made {{machinery}} to produce cane/ bamboo fly rods. The {{most important of these}} was the <b>beveler.</b> Some of the greatest fly rod makers learned their craft under Leonard and later opened their own rod shops. The company would continue to make rods for almost eight decades under various ownership, including surviving a fire in 1964 which virtually destroyed the shop. In 1984, the Leonard Rod Company closed its doors. The machinery from the shop, including the <b>beveler,</b> was purchased at auction by Marc Aroner who continues to make rods under his own name using the equipment.|$|E
50|$|Shipfitters fabricate, {{assemble}} and erect all {{structural parts}} of a ship, coordinate all fixed tank work performed on submarines and ships, and coordinate all sonar dome work. Shipfitters also use heavy machinery, such as plate planners, shears, punches, drill presses, bending rolls, bending slabs, plate <b>bevelers,</b> saws, presses up to 750 tons, angle rolls (vertical and horizontal), dogs and wedges. Shipfitters are responsible for hydro and air testing of tanks and compartments, as well as perform grinding, drilling and fit-up operations on submarines and surface crafts.|$|R
5000|$|Stamp set â€” A set of {{stamping}} tools used {{to shape}} and color the leather {{to create the}} final image. Usually contains at minimum a <b>beveler,</b> pear shader, seeder, and background tool, but sets often contain other tools and sometimes several variations on the same tool.|$|E
5000|$|The main tools used to [...] "carve" [...] leather include: swivel knife, veiner, <b>beveler,</b> pear shader, seeder, cam, and {{background}} tool. The swivel knife is held similar to pencil and drawn along the leather to outline patterns. The other tools are punch-type implements struck with a wooden, nylon or rawhide mallet. The {{object is to}} add further definition {{with them to the}} cut lines made by the swivel knife.|$|E
50|$|These tools {{create a}} curved {{impression}} {{of a series of}} short, closely spaced lines. They may be used interchangeably, the only difference being that the veiner creates a simple curved line, while the shell tool has a pattern resembling the edge of a scallop along the inside edge. They are used to continue to create the impression of depth created by the <b>beveler,</b> and to create the {{impression of a}} curved surface. These tools are used in the usual way, but like the pear shader, may also be tilted to help create the impression of depth where they are used beside a cut.|$|E
