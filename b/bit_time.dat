500|$|End of Packet (EOP): EOP is {{indicated}} by the transmitter driving 2 bit times of SE0 (D+ and D− both below max.) and 1bit time of Jstate. After this, the transmitter ceases to drive the D+/D− lines and the aforementioned pull-up resistors hold it in the J (idle) state. Sometimes skew due to hubs can add {{as much as one}} <b>bit</b> <b>time</b> before the SE0 of the end of packet. This extra bit can also result in a [...] "bit stuff violation" [...] if the six bits before it in the CRC are 1s. This bit should be ignored by receiver.|$|E
5000|$|A {{zero bit}} is a one-microsecond pulse {{in the center}} of the first half of a <b>bit</b> <b>time,</b> and a one is a pulse in the second half of a <b>bit</b> <b>time.</b> Data is sent as 8 bit bytes. A byte is preceded by a <b>bit</b> <b>time</b> that has two pulses (at both 1 and 0 times), and ends with a <b>bit</b> <b>time</b> that has another two pulses. In some variations, the stop bit-time is optional, and the dual-pulse bit times are treated as byte separators.|$|E
50|$|In telecommunication, coded mark {{inversion}} (CMI) is a non-return-to-zero (NRZ) line code. It encodes zero bits as a half <b>bit</b> <b>time</b> of zero {{followed by}} a half <b>bit</b> <b>time</b> of one, and while one bits are encoded as a full <b>bit</b> <b>time</b> of a constant level. The level used for one bits alternates each time one is coded.|$|E
5000|$|A repeater/repeater hub uses a jabber timer {{that ends}} {{retransmission}} {{to the other}} ports when it expires. The timer runs for 25,000 to 50,000 <b>bit</b> <b>times</b> for 1 Mbit/s, 40,000 to 75,000 <b>bit</b> <b>times</b> for 10 and 100 Mbit/s, and 80,000 to 150,000 <b>bit</b> <b>times</b> for 1 Gbit/s. Jabbering ports are partitioned off the network until a carrier is no longer detected.|$|R
5000|$|... 100 Mbit/s hubs and {{repeaters}} come in {{two different}} speed grades: Class I delay the signal for a maximum of 140 <b>bit</b> <b>times</b> (enabling translation/recoding between 100Base-TX, 100Base-FX and 100Base-T4) and Class II hubs delay the signal for a maximum of 92 <b>bit</b> <b>times</b> (enabling installation of two hubs in a single collision domain).|$|R
5000|$|For Ethernet {{received}} IPG can {{be reduced}} to a period of 47 <b>bit</b> <b>times.</b>|$|R
5000|$|To {{calculate}} the <b>bit</b> <b>time</b> for a 10 Mbit/s NIC, use the formula as follows: [...] <b>bit</b> <b>time</b> = 1 / (10 * 10^6) = 10^-7 = 100 * 10^-9 = 100 nanoseconds ...|$|E

50|$|This also (assuming NRZL with {{transition}} for 0 encoding of the output) {{provides a}} minimum of one transition per 6 <b>bit</b> <b>times</b> during transmission of data, and one transition per 7 <b>bit</b> <b>times</b> during transmission of flag, so the receiver can stay {{in sync with the}} transmitter. Note however, that for new protocols, newer encodings such as 8b/10b encoding are better suited.|$|R
5000|$|For Fast Ethernet {{received}} IPG {{reduction is}} not specified. Standard is 96 <b>bit</b> <b>times</b> (12 bytes).|$|R
500|$|SOF (Start of Frame) Every {{millisecond}} (12000 full-bandwidth <b>bit</b> <b>times),</b> the USB host transmits {{a special}} SOF (start of frame) token, containing an 11-bit incrementing frame number {{in place of}} a device address. This is used to synchronize isochronous and interrupt data transfers. High-bandwidth USB2.0 devices receive seven additional SOF tokens per frame, each introducing a 125µs [...] "microframe" [...] (60000 high-bandwidth <b>bit</b> <b>times</b> each).|$|R
50|$|Synchronization {{starts with}} a hard {{synchronization}} on the first recessive to dominant transition {{after a period of}} bus idle (the start bit). Resynchronization occurs on every recessive to dominant transition during the frame. The CAN controller expects the transition to occur at a multiple of the nominal <b>bit</b> <b>time.</b> If the transition does not occur at the exact time the controller expects it, the controller adjusts the nominal <b>bit</b> <b>time</b> accordingly.|$|E
5000|$|However, if {{this would}} result in the same output level as the {{previous}} <b>bit</b> <b>time,</b> a 0 level is output instead.|$|E

50|$|Mechanical {{teleprinters}} using 5-bit codes (see Baudot code) {{typically used}} a stop period of 1.5 <b>bit</b> <b>times.</b> Very early electromechanical teletypewriters (pre-1930) could demand 2 stop bits to allow mechanical impression without buffering. Hardware {{which does not}} support fractional stop bits can communicate with a device that uses 1.5 <b>bit</b> <b>times</b> if it is configured to send 2 stop bits when transmitting and requiring 1 stop bit when receiving.|$|R
5000|$|For 40, and 100 Gigabit Ethernet {{received}} IPG can {{be reduced}} to a period of 8 <b>bit</b> <b>times</b> (1 byte).|$|R
50|$|At {{the start}} of the next <b>bit</b> <b>time,</b> the host negates the {{transmission}} line, and the process repeats. Each bit is communicated in this manner.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>bit</b> <b>time</b> for a 10 Mbit/s NIC is 100 nanoseconds. That is, a 10 Mbit/s NIC can eject 1 bit every 0.1 {{microsecond}} (100 nanoseconds = [...]1 microseconds).|$|E
50|$|<b>Bit</b> <b>time</b> is {{a concept}} in {{computer}} networking. It {{is defined as the}} time it takes for one bit to be ejected from a Network Interface Card (NIC) operating at some predefined standard speed, such as 10 Mbit/s. The time is measured between the time the logical link control layer 2 sublayer receives the instruction from the operating system until the bit actually leaves the NIC. The <b>bit</b> <b>time</b> {{has nothing to do with}} the time it takes for a bit to travel on the network medium, but has to do with the internals of the NIC.|$|E

50|$|In telecommunications, a {{transverse}} {{redundancy check}} (TRC) or vertical redundancy check is a redundancy check for synchronized parallel bits applied once per <b>bit</b> <b>time,</b> across the bit streams. This requires additional parallel channels for the check bit or bits.|$|E

50|$|This is vaguely {{reminiscent}} of, {{but quite}} different from, Miller encoding, which also uses half-bit and full-bit pulses, but additionally uses the half-one/half-zero combination and arranges {{them so that}} the signal always spends at least a full <b>bit</b> <b>time</b> at a particular level before transitioning again.|$|E

40|$|A {{half-duplex}} repeater is the least-cost method for connecting multiple hosts to an IEEE 802. 3 Ethernet LAN. However, if we increase the data rate from 10 Mb/s Ethernet to 100 Mb/s Fast Ethernet, shared access via CSMA/CD becomes less e#cient {{because of the}} resulting increase in size of the collision fragments. For example, in a typical star-wired single-repeater network with a diameter of 200 meters, upgrading from 10 BASE-T to 100 BASE-T increases the round-trip delay (including bit budget for the network cards and repeater) from about 100 <b>bit</b> <b>times</b> to almost 500 <b>bit</b> <b>times.</b> Moreover, a further upgrade to 1000 Mb/s Gigabit Ethernet would increase the round-trip delay to about 4000 <b>bit</b> <b>times</b> [...] - which is eight {{times larger than the}} minimum frame size.
