5|$|Another steep climb of 800 feet <b>brought</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> the Marei Parei spur, to {{the spot}} where the ground was covered with the {{magnificent}} pitcher-plants, of which we had come in search. This one has been called the Nepenthes Rajah, and is a plant about four feet in length, with broad leaves stretching on every side, having the great pitchers resting on the ground in a circle about it. Their shape and size are remarkable. I will give the measurement of one, to indicate the form: the length along the back nearly fourteen inches; from the base {{to the top of the}} column in front, five inches; and its lid a foot long by fourteen inches broad, and of an oval shape. Its mouth was surrounded by a plaited pile, which near the column was two inches broad, lessening in its narrowest part to three-quarters of an inch. The plaited pile of the mouth was also undulating in broad waves. Near the stem the pitcher is four inches deep, so that the mouth is situated upon it in a triangular manner. The colour of an old chalice is a deep purple, but that of the others is generally mauve outside, very dark indeed in the lower part, though lighter towards the rim; the inside is of the same colour, but has a kind of glazed and shiny appearance. The lid is mauve in the centre, shading to green at the edges. The stems of the female flowers we found always a foot shorter than those of the male, and the former were far less numerous than the latter. It is indeed one of the most astonishing productions of nature.|$|E

"We {{neared the}} fort itself in approaches, which took a great effort, since {{at that time}} there was great cold, and in {{addition}} to that the situation around the fort is rocky, which caused significant upturn; however, despite the difficulty, the approaches have <b>brought</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> the sea strait, which is right under the city itself, at the distance of a musket's shot, with which bags full of fur were very helpful, where there were bare rocks. And for the other side ... to perform the approaches, Major-General Bergholtz was sent out with six regiments, which were also nearing the city with approaches." ...|$|E
500|$|After the battle, Xerxes {{was curious}} {{as to what the}} Greeks had been trying to do (presumably because they had had so few men) and had some Arcadian deserters interrogated in his presence. The answer was: all the other men were {{participating}} in the Olympic Games. When Xerxes asked what the prize was for the winner, the answer was: [...] "an olive-wreath". Upon hearing this, Tigranes, a Persian general, said: [...] "Good heavens, Mardonius, what kind of men are these that you have pitted against us? It is not for riches that they contend but for honor!" [...] (Godley translation) or otherwise, [...] "Ye Gods, Mardonius, what men have you <b>brought</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> fight against?

500|$|In November 1934, Walker, now {{a student}} at the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, testified with Robert Olds, Claire Chennault, Donald Wilson, Harold George and Robert Webster on the {{military}} aspects of aviation before the Howell Commission on Federal Aviation. All were current or former instructors at the Air Corps Tactical School, and all except Chennault were part of the Bomber Mafia. They argued for an independent air force, in contradiction to Army doctrine. Walker told the commission: [...] "unless we create an adequate and separate Air Force, this next war 'will begin in the air and end in the mud'-in the mud and debris of the demolished industries that have <b>brought</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> our knees." [...] They were unable to persuade the commission to recommend an independent air force, although it did agree that the Air Corps should be granted greater autonomy within the Army. The commission concluded that [...] "there is ample reason to believe that aircraft have now passed far beyond their former position as useful auxiliaries... An adequate striking force for use against objectives both near and remote is a necessity for a modern army".|$|E

And when asked [...] "What is the prize for the winner?", [...] "An olive-wreath" [...] came the answer. Then Tigranes, one of his generals uttered a most noble saying: [...] "Good heavens!

2500|$|In the 1993 essay {{entitled}} [...] "Ecofeminism: Toward Global Justice and Planetary Health" [...] authors Greta Gaard and Lori Gruen outline {{what they}} call the [...] "ecofeminist framework". The essay provides a wealth of data and statistics in addition to laying out the theoretical aspects of the ecofeminist critique. The framework described is intended to establish ways of viewing and understanding our current global situations so that we are better able to understand how we arrived at this point and what may be done to ameliorate the ills. The four sides of the frame are: the mechanistic materialist model of the universe that resulted from the scientific revolution and the subsequent reduction of all things into mere resources to be optimized, dead inert matter to be used; the rise of patriarchal religions and their establishment of gender hierarchies along with their denial of immanent divinity; self and other dualisms and the inherent power and domination ethic it entails; and capitalism and its intrinsic need for the exploitation, destruction and instrumentalization of animals, earth and people {{for the sole purpose of}} creating wealth. They hold that these four factors have <b>brought</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> what ecofeminists see as a [...] "separation between nature and culture" [...] that is the root source of our planetary ills.|$|E
