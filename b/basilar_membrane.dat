Both the scala vestibuli and the scala tympani contain an extracellular fluid called perilymph. The scala media contains endolymph.

25|$|In most {{reptiles}} the perilymphatic duct and lagena {{are relatively}} short, and the sensory cells {{are confined to}} a small basilar papilla lying between them. However, in birds, mammals, and crocodilians, these structures become much larger and somewhat more complicated. In birds, crocodilians, and monotremes, the ducts are simply extended, together forming an elongated, more or less straight, tube. The endolymphatic duct is wrapped in a simple loop around the lagena, with the <b>basilar</b> <b>membrane</b> lying along one side. The {{first half of the}} duct is now referred to as the scala vestibuli, while the second half, which includes the <b>basilar</b> <b>membrane,</b> is called the scala tympani. As a result of this increase in length, the <b>basilar</b> <b>membrane</b> and papilla are both extended, with the latter developing into the organ of Corti, while the lagena is now called the cochlear duct. All of these structures together constitute the cochlea.|$|E

40|$|Transduction {{of sound}} in {{mammalian}} ears is mediated by basilar-membrane waves exhibiting delays that increase systematically with {{distance from the}} cochlear base. Most contemporary accounts of such “traveling-wave” delays in humans have ignored postmortem basilar-membrane measurements in favor of indirect in vivo estimates derived from brainstem-evoked responses, compound action potentials, and otoacoustic emissions. Here, we show that those indirect delay estimates are either flawed or inadequately calibrated. In particular, we argue against assertions based on indirect estimates that basilar-membrane delays are much longer in humans than in experimental animals. We also estimate in vivo basilar-membrane delays in humans by correcting postmortem measurements in humans according {{to the effects of}} death on basilar-membrane vibrations in other mammalian species. The estimated in vivo basilar-membrane delays in humans are similar to delays in the hearing organs of other tetrapods, including those in which <b>basilar</b> <b>membranes</b> do not sustain traveling waves or that lack <b>basilar</b> <b>membranes</b> altogether...|$|R

30|$|At low tone intensities, {{however, the}} {{input-output}} response is linear. Such responses, of 1 dB/dB, are also suggested for sufficiently higher-than-moderate intensities of pure tones; both theoretically and empirically, the input–output relation steepens above 80 dB SPL, its slope approaching unity at 90 – 100 dB SPL. Nonetheless, some studies indicate highly compressive growth {{right up to}} 100 dB SPL (Guinea pig, chinchilla). The high-intensity regime is not relevant to the model considered here, {{and will not be}} mentioned further. Similarly, the compression zone’s lower limit is unclear; for example, in the chinchilla it can be roughly 40 dB SPL, but in the Guinea pig it can be roughly 50 dB SPL. Whether the <b>basilar</b> <b>membrane’s</b> input-output function varies across species is an ongoing debate. It is agreed, however, that nonlinearity is only present at or near the basilar-membrane locus of the CF. When the frequency of the stimulating tone is lower than about 0.7 of the CF, the vibrations there grow linearly, at least for basilar-membrane loci at the cochlear base. The present paper concerns only basilar-membrane loci at the respective CF’s.|$|R
25|$|In reptiles, {{sound is}} {{transmitted}} to the inner ear by the stapes (stirrup) bone of the middle ear. This is pressed against the oval window, a membrane-covered opening {{on the surface of}} the vestibule. From here, sound waves are conducted through a short perilymphatic duct to a second opening, the round window, which equalizes pressure, allowing the incompressible fluid to move freely. Running parallel with the perilymphatic duct is a separate blind-ending duct, the lagena, filled with endolymph. The lagena is separated from the perilymphatic duct by a <b>basilar</b> <b>membrane,</b> and contains the sensory hair cells that finally translate the vibrations in the fluid into nerve signals.

25|$|Neural {{structures}} {{form and}} become more sophisticated {{as a result of}} experience. For example, the preference for consonance, the harmony or agreement of components, over dissonance, an unstable tone combination, is found early in development. Research suggests that this is due to both the experiencing of structured sounds and the fact they stem from development of the <b>basilar</b> <b>membrane</b> and auditory nerve, two early developing structures in the brain. An incoming auditory stimulus evokes responses measured {{in the form of an}} Event-related potential (ERP), measured brain responses resulting directly from a thought or perception. There is a difference in ERP measures for normally developing infants ranging from 2–6 months in age. Measures in infants 4 months and older demonstrate faster, more negative ERPs. In contrast, newborns and infants up to 4 months of age show slow, unsynchronized, positive ERPs. Trainor, et al. (2003) hypothesized that these results indicated that responses from infants less than four months of age are produced by subcortical auditory structures, whereas with older infants responses tend to originate in the higher cortical structures.|$|E

To be effective, OHC feedback must be delivered to the correct region of the BM and introduced {{at the appropriate time}} in each cycle of BM displacement. To investigate when OHCs contribute to cochlear amplification, a laser-diode interferometer was used to measure tone-evoked BM displacements in the basal turn of the guinea pig cochlea. Measurements were made at multiple sites across the width of the BM, which are tuned to the same characteristic frequency (CF). In response to CF tones, the largest displacements occur in the OHC region and phase lead those measured beneath the outer pillar cells and adjacent to the spiral ligament by about 90 °. Postmortem, responses beneath the OHCs are reduced by up to 65 dB, and all regions across the width of the BM move in unison. We suggest that OHCs amplify BM responses to CF tones when the BM is moving at maximum velocity. In regions of the BM where OHCs contribute to its motion, the responses are compressive and nonlinear. We measured the distribution of nonlinear compressive vibrations {{along the length of the}} BM in response to a single frequency tone and estimated that OHC amplification is restricted to a 1. 25 - to 1. 40 -mm length of BM centered on the CF place...|$|R

This partition, comprising the organ of Corti sandwiched between the <b>basilar</b> and tectorial <b>membranes,</b> contains the outer hair cells that are thought to drive this amplification process. Force generation by outer hair cells has been studied extensively in vitro and in situ, but, to understand cochlear amplification fully, it is necessary to characterize the role played by each of the components of the cochlear partition in vivo. Observations of cochlear partition motion in vivo are severely restricted by its inaccessibility and sensitivity to surgical trauma, so, for the present study, a computer model has been used to simulate the operation of the cochlea under different experimental conditions. In this model, which uniquely retains much of the three-dimensional complexity of the real cochlea, the motions of the <b>basilar</b> and tectorial <b>membranes</b> are fundamentally different during in situ- and in vivo-like conditions. Furthermore, enhanced outer hair cell force generation in vitro leads paradoxically to a decrease in the gain of the cochlear amplifier during sound stimulation to the model in vivo.

2500|$|The {{hair cells}} in the organ of Corti are tuned to certain sound {{frequencies}} by way of their location in the cochlea, due {{to the degree of}} stiffness in the <b>basilar</b> <b>membrane.</b> [...] This stiffness is due to, among other things, the thickness and width of the <b>basilar</b> <b>membrane,</b> which {{along the length of the}} cochlea is stiffest nearest its beginning at the oval window, where the stapes introduces the vibrations coming from the eardrum.

Plasma taurine is comparable in the three strains (approximately 0. 5 mM), but taurinuria is 10 -fold greater in taut- animals. Fractional reabsorption of taurine is 0. 967 +/- 0. 013 (mean +/- SD) in A/J); and 0. 839 +/- 0. 08 and 0. 787 +/- 0. 05 in C 57 BL/ 6 J and PRO/Re, respectively. Taurine concentration in renal cortex intracellular fluid (free of urine contamination) is similar in the three strains. Taurine reabsorption is inhibited by beta-alanine, in taut+ and taut- strains. These in vivo findings reveal residual taurine transport activity in the taut- phenotype and no evidence for impaired efflux at <b>basilar</b> <b>membranes</b> {{as the cause of}} impaired taurine reabsorption. Cortex slices provide information about uptake of amino acids at the antiluminal membrane. Taurine behaves as an inert metabolite in mouse kidney cortex slices. Taurine uptake by slices is active and, at less than 1 mM, is greater than normal in taut- slices. Concentration-dependent uptake studies reveal more than one taurine carrier in taut+ and taut- strains. The apparent Km values for uptake below 1 mM are different in taut- and taut+ slices (approximately 0. 2 mM and approximately 0. 7 mM, respectively); the apparent Km values above 1 mM taurine are similar in taut+ and taut- slices. Efflux from slices in all strains in the same (0. 0105 - 0. 0113 mumol-min- 1 -g- 1 wet wt), but taut- tissue retains about 10 % more radioactivity over the period of efflux. beta-Alanine is actively metabolized in mouse kidney. Its uptake in the presence of blocked transamination, is greater; its intracellular oxidation is attenuated; and its exchange with intracellular taurine is diminished in taut- slices. These findings indicate impaired beta-amino acid permeation on a low-Km uptake system at the luminal membrane in the taut- phenotype. beta-Amino acids are not reclaimed efficiently either from the innermost luminal pool in cortex slices or from the ultrafiltrate in the tubule lumen in vivo. The former leads to high uptake ratios in vitro, the latter to high clearance rates in vivo. In vitro and in vivo data are thus concordant.

2500|$|Loudness is {{perceived}} as how [...] "loud" [...] or [...] "soft" [...] a sound is and relates to the totalled number of auditory nerve stimulations over short cyclic time periods, most likely over the duration of theta wave cycles.

Past around 200 ms this is no longer the case and the duration of the sound no longer affects the apparent loudness of the sound. Figure 3 gives an impression of how loudness information is summed over a period of about 200 ms before being sent to the auditory cortex. Louder signals create a greater 'push' on the <b>Basilar</b> <b>membrane</b> and thus stimulate more nerves, creating a stronger loudness signal.

40|$|The {{cells of}} perfused rabbit {{collecting}} tubules swell and the intercellular spaces widen during osmotic {{flow of water}} from lumen to bath induced by antidiuretic hormone (ADH). Ouabain had no influence on these changes. In the absence of net water flow intercellular width was unaffected when tubules were swollen in hypotonic external media. Therefore, during ADH-induced flow widening of intercellular spaces is not a consequence of osmotic swelling of a closed intercellular compartment containing trapped solutes, but rather is due to flow of solution through the channel. Direct evidence of intercellular flow was obtained. Nonperfused tubules swollen in hypotonic media were reimmersed in isotonic solution with resultant entry of water into intercellular spaces. The widened spaces gradually collapsed completely. Spaces enlarged in this manner could be emptied more rapidly by increasing the transtubular hydrostatic pressure difference. In electron micrographs a path of exit of sufficient width to accommodate the observed rate of fluid flow was seen {{at the base of}} the intercellular channel.

40|$|It {{has always}} {{intrigued}} man {{as to how}} the human body performs so many complicated functions with the speed and accuracy that it does. One such task is that of sound localization in space, the ability to determine the location of a sound source with considerable accuracy. A biologically realistic neural network is proposed for the binaural processing of interaural time and intensity cues that closely resembles computational schemes suggested for sterepsis (depth perception) in vision. The important feature of this network {{is that it does not}} use any neural delay lines to generate such attributes of binaural hearing such as lateralization of all audible frequencies and the detection of enhancement of signals in a noisy environment. Temporal shifts between the signals at the ears, arising from sound sources at different locations on the azimuth cause spatial disparities in the corresponding travelling waves set up on the <b>basilar</b> <b>membranes</b> in the two ears. The two dimensional network proposed uses these spatial differences between instantaneous outputs at the two ears to measure interaural differences. The network operation approximately computes the cross-correlation between the two cochlear outputs by combining the ipsilateral input at a given characteristic frequency (CF) with contralateral inputs from locally off-CF locations. Some of the results obtained from this network are presented. Having proposed a network, the next question is whether such a connection is genetically present in the body or whether it is formed over a long period of time by a gradual process of learning. Assuming that the latter solution is more plausible, two learning rules are suggested according to which the network could alter its initial random connectivities. The first learning rule is a supervised technique in which a teaching signal prespecifies the ideal response expected from the network to each input pattern presented. The error between the actual output and the desired response helps to guide the learning process in the desired direction. When the minimum of the error surface is reached, the network is said to have learned and the weights do not change any more. The teaching signal required for the supervised algorithm could be derived from the visual system. However, no physiological evidence exists that links the auditory and visual maps at the level of the olivary complex which is where early binaural processing occurs. To overcome this problem, an unsupervised learning rule is proposed which requires only the cochlear outputs from the two ears. The rule is a competitive learning strategy wherein only one neuron updates its connectivities for a particular input pattern. The neuron chosen to alter its weights is the one which responds maximally to the input. The inherent delays that exist in the neural system are used as guides to form the organized spatial map responses...|$|R

The G protein was consistently localized at the apex of viral buds, whereas the density of G protein on the shaft was equivalent to that in the surrounding membrane. These observations suggest that G-protein interaction with the nucleocapsid via its cytoplasmic domain may be necessary for the initiation of viral assembly. Once contact is established, nucleocapsid coiling proceeds with nose cone formation followed by formation of the helical cylinder. M protein may function to induce a nucleocapsid conformation favorable for coiling or may cross-link adjacent turns in the tight coil or both...|$|R
