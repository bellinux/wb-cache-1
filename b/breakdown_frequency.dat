40|$|The {{evolution}} of resistance-breaking capacity in pathogen populations {{has been shown}} to depend on the plant genetic background surrounding the resistance genes. We evaluated a core collection of pepper (Capsicum annuum) landraces, representing the worldwide genetic diversity, for its ability to modulate the <b>breakdown</b> <b>frequency</b> by Potato virus Y of major resistance alleles at the pvr 2 locus encoding the eukaryotic initiation factor 4 E (eIF 4 E). Depending on the pepper landrace, the <b>breakdown</b> <b>frequency</b> of a given resistance allele varied from 0 % to 52. 5 %, attesting to their diversity and the availability of genetic backgrounds favourable to resistance durability in the plant germplasm. The mutations in the virus genome involved in resistance breakdown also differed between plant genotypes, indicating differential selection effects exerted on the virus population by the different genetic backgrounds. The <b>breakdown</b> <b>frequency</b> was positively correlated with the level of virus accumulation, confirming the impact of quantitative resistance loci on resistance durability. Among these loci, pvr 6, encoding an isoform of eIF 4 E, was associated with a major effect on virus accumulation and on the <b>breakdown</b> <b>frequency</b> of the pvr 2 -mediated resistance.

Using the pepper (Capsicum annuum) /Potato virus Y (PVY, genus Potyvirus) pathosystem, we aimed at identifying plant genetic factors directly affecting the frequency of virus adaptation to the major resistance gene pvr 2 (3) and at comparing them with genetic factors affecting quantitative resistance. The resistance <b>breakdown</b> <b>frequency</b> was a highly heritable trait (h(2) = 0. 87).

The durability of the pvr 23 allele, conferring resistance to Potato virus Y (PVY), was demonstrated {{to depend on the}} plant genetic background. In order to identify genetic factors affecting the durability of the pvr 23 resistance, QTL mapping was performed using doubled-haploid (DH) lines issued from the F 1 between two Capsicum annuum lines: ‘Perennial’ carrying pvr 23 in a partially resistant background and ‘Yolo Wonder’ carrying the susceptible pvr 2 + allele in a susceptible background. 350 DH lines were genotyped with 234 markers and the linkage map was established. The 156 DH lines carrying the pvr 23 allele but segregating for the genetic background were evaluated for two traits: the <b>breakdown</b> <b>frequency</b> of pvr 23 (following inoculation with a PVY clone nonpathogenic (avirulent) towards pvr 23) and the PVY accumulation (following inoculation with a mutant of the previous PVY clone carrying a single mutation conferring pathogenicity towards pvr 23).

One major QTL, explaining 29 % of the variance of pvr 23 <b>breakdown</b> <b>frequency</b> was identified on chromosome 3 and two QTLs, explaining 25 % and 9 % of PVY accumulation variation, were identified on chromosomes 3 and 6, respectively.

Probability to make errors over a period depends on some factors mainly job-training, professional experience and psychophysical stress. In particular, this study deals with accident frequency resulting from temporary work (or “work in leasing”). By applying typical risk analysis techniques adopted in process engineering, this paper is focused on human risk level assessment with emphasis on the role of professional experience and job training.

40|$|International audienceGenetic {{resistance}} provides efficient {{control of}} crop diseases, but {{is limited by}} pathogen evolution capacities which often result in resistance breakdown. It has been demonstrated recently, in three different pathosystems, that polygenic resistances combining a major-effect gene and quantitative resistance controlled by the genetic background are more durable than monogenic resistances (with the same major gene in a susceptible genetic background), but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Using the pepper–Potato virus Y system, we examined three mechanisms that {{could account for the}} greater durability of the polygenic resistances: (i) the additional quantitative resistance conferred by the genetic background; (ii) {{the increase in the number}} of mutations required for resistance breakdown; and (iii) the slower selection of adapted resistance-breaking mutants within the viral population. The three mechanisms were experimentally validated. The first explained a large part of the variation in resistance <b>breakdown</b> <b>frequency</b> and is therefore expected to be a major determinant of resistance durability. Quantitative resistance factors also had an influence on the second mechanism by modifying the virus mutational pathways towards resistance breakdown and could also have an influence on the third mechanism by increasing genetic drift effects on the viral population.

In the previous study, the mould maintenance plans were integrated with the traditional production schedules in a plastics production system. It was proven that considering machine and mould maintenance in production scheduling could improve the overall reliability and productivity of the production system. However, the previous model assumed that each job contained single operation. It is not workable in other manufacturing systems such as die stamping which may contain multiple operations with multiple moulds in each job.

In this paper, we present {{an approach to}} generate an adaptive PM schedule which maximizes the net savings from PM subject to workforce constraints. The approach consists of two components: (a) task prioritization based on a multi-logit regression model {{for each type of}} PM task, and (b) task rescheduling based on a binary integer programming (BIP) model with constraints on single-skilled and multi-skilled workforce availability. The task prioritization component develops a multi-logit regression for machine failure probability associated with each type of PM task {{at the beginning of the}} year, using historical data on machine utilization, PM, and machine breakdowns. At the start of each PM time-bucket (e. g., a month), we use the updated machine failure probability for each candidate PM task to compute its current contribution to net PM savings, which indicates its current priority. The task rescheduling BIP model incorporates the priorities in selecting tasks for the current bucket to maximize PM effectiveness subject to workforce availability, yielding an adaptive and effective PM schedule for each time-bucket of the master PM schedule. We examine the effect of using multi-skilled workforce on the overall PM effectiveness, and also provide an illustration from a newspaper publishing environment to explain the use of the approach. We have developed four heuristic algorithms to yield good solutions to large scale versions of this scheduling problem.

We also overcome the lowfrequency breakdown caused by the loss of the frequency dependence of the right hand side vector in scattering analysis and the same loss in Green’s function in RCS computation. In addition, we develop a fast solution that eliminates the lowfrequency breakdown of the EFIE in a reduced system of O(1). Instead of introducing additional computational cost to fix the low-frequency breakdown problem, the proposed fast O(1) solution speeds up low-frequency computation.

As the size and complexity of mining equipment continue to increase, the implications of equipment failure become ever more critical. An unplanned failure can result in significantly higher repair costs than a planned maintenance or repair. Of even more importance {{is the loss of}} production associated with larger equipment failures. One method to mitigate the impact of failures is to improve the reliability of the equipment. Reliability is a performance indicator of overall equipment condition. A first step in reliability improvement is collection and analysis of the appropriate data. This paper presents a case study describing reliability analysis of crushing plants in Jajarm bauxite mine. In this study crushing plants are divided into seven subsystems. Reliability analysis has been done for each subsystem by using failures data. The parameters of some idealized probability distributions, such as Weibull, Exponential, Lognormal distributions, have been estimated by using ReliaSoft's Weibull++ 6 software. An investigation has also been made to determine which of these distributions provide the best fit for characterizing the failure pattern of the two crushing plants and their subsystems. Some aspects of system failure behavior are analyzed briefly for ongoing machine improvement. Reliability of both crushing plants and its subsystems has been estimated at different mission times with their best fit distribution. Analysis of the total downtime, <b>breakdown</b> <b>frequency,</b> reliability, and maintainability characteristics of different subsystems shows that the reliability of crushing plant 1 and crushing plant 2 after 10 hour reduce to about 64 % and 35 % respectively. The study shows that reliability and maintainability analysis is very useful for deciding maintenance intervals. It is also useful for planning and organizing maintenance.

However, despite the abundance of several IT solutions, there exist many problems where more than one decision has to be made. Among the techniques supporting a multi-decisional context, simulations can undoubtedly play an important role as they provide what-if analysis and hence help to evaluate quantitative benefits. This thesis develops a simulation model for breakdown in an industrial machine, the main crusher in a cement factory. It also examines three important parameters (Drill Head, Dusting and Lubrication) of the crusher machine with the use of Bayesian network modelling which allows determination of suitable influencing factors in a precise and dynamic manner. The model also supports integration with management systems such as J. I. T, and MRPII. Witness simulation software has been used in this work to model the <b>breakdown</b> <b>frequency</b> of the Crusher machine and the associated parameters. The Bayesian Network Modelling is used to consider historical data and expert opinions; the Bayes’ approach takes into consideration off all existing parameters that affect the machine breakdown directly or indirectly. This tool is capable of establishing a probability based on the information gathered about the parameters. The simulation model is developed further to enable the Bayesian Network Modelling to be applied via the Chain Rule to calculate the probability of failure. The findings of this research show the approach developed in this work, where the Bayesian probability development process is integrated into the simulation model. This provides a unique and dynamic tool to aid decision making in understanding machine breakdowns. The resulting simulator is a decision making tool capable of analysing the status of the machine and the associated influencing factors. This uses an approach based on multiple performance measures and a user-defined set of inputs based on historical and expert opinion. This work provides a methodology to study the importance of key parameters of the crusher machine. This in effect highlights the correlation between the governing parameters and the occurrence of breakdown. ...|$|E

Paper 4 : Competence requirements and their impact on manufacturing system performance; This paper explains how staff competence can be implemented into process models to obtain a more representative simulation of overall system performance. Paper 5 : Modelling the impact of supporting processes on manufacturing system performance - experiences from an industrial case study.

The carrier number and Sommerfeld coefficient of the specific heat {{are estimated to be}} 1. 01 [...] 1. 03 holes per formula unit and 82 [...] 94 mJmol^- 1 K^- 2, respectively, which are consistent with the chemical stoichiometry and a direct measure of 93 mJmol^- 1 K^- 2 [H. Fukazawa et al., J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 80 SA, SA 118 (2011) ]. The Sommerfeld coefficient is about 9 times enhanced over a band value, suggesting the importance of low-energy spin and/or orbital fluctuations, and places KFe_ 2 As_ 2 among strongly correlated metals. We have also performed dHvA measurements on Ba_ 0. 07 K_ 0. 93 Fe_ 2 As_ 2 and have observed the α and β frequencies. Comment: 14 pages, 16 Figures, 3 Table...|$|R
40|$|Power and {{distribution}} transformers are expensive and important units in electric power networks. Majority of dielectric and mechanical failures in transformers {{are due to}} mechanical displacements in the winding structure. Detection of these winding displacements in advance of a dielectric failure can reduce unplanned maintenance costs and provide the possibility to improve system reliability by preventing outages and <b>breakdowns.</b> <b>Frequency</b> Response Analysis (FRA) is a powerful and sensitive diagnostic test technique to evaluate transformer winding displacements by measuring their electrical transfer functions over a wide frequency range. In the past, it has really required trained experts to interpret the FRA test results in a subjective manner to make a judgement as whether the amount of agreement or disagreement between the two or more sets of FRA measurements is significant enough for further testing and inspection of the transformer. Therefore, a quite number of numerical techniques have been proposed to analyze the FRA data such as Standard Deviation (SD), Absolute Sum of Logarithmic Error (ASLE), Correlation Coefficient (CC), and others. Several of the numerical techniques were evaluated for its suitability, reliability and sensitivity for different cases of auto power transformer, 1000 MVA, 400 / 275 / 13 kV HV neutral winding terminations and comparison methods. It is concluded that Absolute Sum of Logarithmic Error (ASLE) is more reliable and sensitive. The ASLE technique should included as an analysing technique in any FRA test to get better interpretation and increase opportunities to provide more objective comparison of FRA test results...|$|R
