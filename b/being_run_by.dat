Working-class locals and Reed College students frequent the bar, which is known for popularizing the beer Pabst Blue Ribbon.

5|$|That July, the RTC {{took out}} a $385,000 {{mortgage}} on the Theatre from two banks, the Rondout Savings Bank and the Ulster Savings Bank. After <b>being</b> <b>run</b> <b>by</b> the Cacchios for 61years, the RTC assumed ownership of the Theatre on August19, 2010.

The second and third floors may be renovated and used for offices, and as space for rehearsals and performances.|$|E

Old Sun Community College {{is run by the}} Siksika Nation in Alberta in a building designed by architect Roland Guerney Orr. From 1929 to 1971 the building housed Old Sun residential school, first run by the Anglicans and taken over by the federal government in 1969. It was converted to adult learning and stood as a campus of Mount Royal College from 1971 to 1978, at which point the Siksika Nation took over operations. In 1988, the Old Sun College Act was passed in the Alberta Legislature recognizing Old Sun Community College as a First Nations College.|$|E

5|$|J. Grossman's Sons was a {{business}} that had been operating in New Orleans, Louisiana since at least 1884. By the early 1900s, the business was <b>being</b> <b>run</b> <b>by</b> both Adolph Grossman and Isidore Grossman. Prior to developing Grapico, J. Grossman's Sons served as creditors. In 1905 for example, a collection attorney successfully sued J. Grossman's Sons to recover legal fees for reducing to judgment a debt of $875 owed to J. Grossman's Sons. Also in 1905, J. Grossman's Sons unsuccessfully prevented the sale of their securing collateral, a debtor's home, to the debtor's daughter. In January 1912, J. Grossman's Sons lent $1000 to a Lewisburg, Louisiana saloon owner who they successfully sued eleven months later to recover the amount against his real estate.|$|E
5|$|Prost {{began his}} career with McLaren (<b>being</b> <b>run</b> <b>by</b> Teddy Mayer) in 1980 {{alongside}} Ulsterman John Watson. On his debut in Buenos Aires he finished in sixth place earning one point, something achieved by {{only a handful of}} drivers. Prost added four more points to his tally during the season, scoring points at Interlagos, Brands Hatch and Zandvoort. Prost finished the year 15th in the Drivers' Championship, equalling points with former world champion Emerson Fittipaldi. Despite the encouraging debut season, Prost had several accidents, breaking his wrist during practice at Kyalami and suffering a concussion during practice at Watkins Glen. He also retired from the Canadian round in Montreal a week earlier because of rear suspension failure. At the end of the season, despite having two years remaining on his contract, he left McLaren and signed with Renault. Prost has said that he left because of the large number of breakages on the car and because he felt the team blamed him for some of the accidents.|$|E
5|$|The {{wool and}} cloth trade was {{primarily}} now <b>being</b> <b>run</b> <b>by</b> English merchants themselves {{rather than by}} foreigners. Increasingly, the trade was also passing through London and the ports of the South-West. By the 1360s, 66–75% of the export trade was in English hands and by the 15th century this had risen to 80%; London managed around 50% of these exports in 1400, {{and as much as}} 83% of wool and cloth exports by 1540. The growth in the numbers of chartered trading companies in London, such as the Worshipful Company of Drapers or the Company of Merchant Adventurers of London, continued, and English producers began to provide credit to European buyers, {{rather than the other way}} around. Usury grew during the period, and few cases were prosecuted by the authorities.|$|E

5|$|Von Neumann {{entered the}} Lutheran Fasori Evangelikus Gimnázium in 1911. This {{was one of}} the best schools in Budapest, part of a {{brilliant}} education system designed for the elite. Under the Hungarian system, children received all their education at the one gymnasium. Despite <b>being</b> <b>run</b> <b>by</b> the Lutheran Church, the majority of its pupils were Jewish. The school system produced a generation noted for intellectual achievement, that included Theodore von Kármán (b. 1881), George de Hevesy (b. 1885), Leó Szilárd (b. 1898), Dennis Gabor (b. 1900), Eugene Wigner (b. 1902), Edward Teller (b. 1908), and Paul Erdős (b. 1913). Collectively, they were sometimes known as Martians. Wigner was a year ahead of von Neumann at the Lutheran School. When asked why the Hungary of his generation had produced so many geniuses, Wigner, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1963, replied that von Neumann was the only genius.|$|E
5|$|Learning that James {{seeks to}} revive the project and {{continue}} his work by acquiring a Garden of Eden Creation Kit (G.E.C.K.), the Lone Wanderer soon tracks him down to Vault 112, and frees him from a virtual reality program <b>being</b> <b>run</b> <b>by</b> the Vault's sadistic Overseer, Dr. Stanislaus Braun, whom James had sought out for information on a G.E.C.K.. Reunited with their father, the pair soon return to Rivet City and recruit Li and the other project members to resume work at the Jefferson Memorial. Just as they begin testing the project, the Memorial is invaded by the Enclave, a powerful military organization formed from {{the remnants of the}} pre-War United States government, which continues to remain active despite the demise of their brethren on the West Coast thirty years previously (see Fallout 2). Seeking to stop them gaining control of his work, James urges the Lone Wanderer to finish his work and find a G.E.C.K. before flooding the project's control room with massive amounts of radiation, preventing the Enclave's military leader, Colonel Augustus Autumn, from taking control of it and killing himself in the process, though Autumn survives. Taking the remaining project members to safety, the Lone Wanderer makes contact with the Brotherhood of Steel within the ruins of the Pentagon, now known as the Citadel. With their help, the Lone Wanderer travels to Vault 87 to find a G.E.C.K., which had been used as a testing site for the Forced Evolutionary Virus (FEV) and now as a breeding ground for the Super Mutants. The Lone Wanderer recovers the G.E.C.K. from within the Vault. But as they make their way out, the Wanderer is ambushed by Colonel Autumn and the Enclave and is captured.|$|E

25|$|The Great Depression of the 1930s brought {{hardship}} to the market. By {{the late}} 1930s, merchants were under increasing {{pressure from the}} AFL and CIO to join their respective labor unions. This led {{to a series of}} strikes that further disrupted business. The introduction and proliferation of supermarkets also hurt market business during the 1930s. One of these new establishments opened across 12th street, directly competing with the Reading Terminal Market. Pressure to compete with supermarkets led to fewer stalls <b>being</b> <b>run</b> <b>by</b> farmers, and more <b>being</b> <b>run</b> <b>by</b> middle men reselling a variety of goods.|$|E
