5|$|This loss led Tiku to {{reinforce}} his men. The Torajan troops were armed with rifles, spears, boulders, swords, and chili pepper extract, sprayed into enemy {{eyes with a}} device called a tirik lada, or <b>blowgun,</b> to blind them. Tiku himself was armed with a Portuguese rifle, spear, and labo. He wore protective armour, a sepu (crotch guard), and a songkok with protrusions {{in the shape of}} buffalo horns, and carried a decorated shield. With his soldiers, Tiku dug pits filled with bamboo stakes along Dutch supply routes; those who wandered over the pits would fall in and be impaled. However, these were not enough to stop the advancing Dutch. On 17 October 1906, two more fortresses, Bamba Puang and Kotu, fell, after several unsuccessful Dutch attacks since June. As the campaign against Tiku, which had already lasted longer than most other campaigns in the occupation, was thought to undermine Dutch authority in Sulawesi, Governor-General J. B. van Heutsz dispatched Governor of Sulawesi Swart to personally lead the attack.|$|E
25|$|The {{economy of}} {{the peoples of the}} Oriente was {{essentially}} silvicultural, although horticulture was practiced. They extracted dyes from the achiote plant for face paint, and curare poisons for <b>blowgun</b> darts from various other plants. Complex religious systems developed, many of which incorporated (or perhaps originated from) the use of hallucinogenic plants such as Datura and Banisteriopsis. They also made coil ceramics.|$|E
25|$|Other early weapons {{used for}} hunting include the sling, which allows small stones or metal balls {{to be thrown}} at much higher {{velocities}} than the arm alone, and the <b>blowgun.</b> The African blowgun's curare tipped darts, intended to paralyze small game, is very similar in function to modern capture guns, with the substitution of a barbiturate for the paralytic curare.|$|E
50|$|Today <b>blowguns</b> {{are used}} with {{tranquilizer}} darts to capture wildlife or to stun caged dangerous animals. Herpetologists use <b>blowguns</b> to capture elusive lizards with stun darts. <b>Blowguns</b> {{are also used}} recreationally, with either darts or paintballs.|$|R

50|$|Bows and Arrows are {{the main}} weapons of the Matsés culture, {{although}} they are currently rarely used in personal conflict. Generally they are only used for hunting animals. The Matsés were never known to use war clubs as do the neighboring Korubo. Historically, they used <b>blowguns,</b> similar to the Matis tribe of Brazil; however, they recently abandoned <b>blowguns</b> in favor of bows and arrows.|$|R
25|$|There {{are three}} classes of soldier {{common to all}} races: swordsmen, bowmen and squad leaders. The level of swordsmen and bowmen is set by the player prior to recruitment, with both types of soldier having three ranks, {{determined}} {{by the amount of}} gold necessary for recruitment (no gold for Level 1, one gold bar for Level 2 and two gold bars for Level 3). Squad leaders are available in only one rank, and require a sword, a suit of armour and three gold bars to recruit. As well as being stronger and having more health than a Level 3 swordsman, they also affect the troops around them; improving their formations, increasing their combat strategy, and enhancing their abilities. Each race can also produce warships, war machines (catapults for the Romans, magical lightening generators for the Vikings, canons for the Mayans, and ballistae for the Trojans), and special military units (medics for the Romans, axe warriors for the Vikings, <b>blowgun</b> warriors for the Mayans, and backpack catapultists for the Trojans). As with swordmen and bowmen, special military units have three levels of recruitment.|$|E
500|$|Exudations {{from the}} skin of the golden poison frog (Phyllobates terribilis) are {{traditionally}} used by native Colombians to poison the darts they use for hunting. The tip of the projectile is rubbed {{over the back of the}} frog and the dart is launched from a <b>blowgun.</b> The combination of the two alkaloid toxins batrachotoxin and homobatrachotoxin is so powerful, one frog contains enough poison to kill an estimated 22,000 mice. [...] Two other species, the Kokoe poison dart frog (Phyllobates aurotaenia) and the black-legged dart frog (Phyllobates bicolor) are also used for this purpose. These are less toxic and less abundant than the golden poison frog. They are impaled on pointed sticks and may be heated over a fire to maximise the quantity of poison that can be transferred to the dart.|$|E
500|$|The Huaorani {{around the}} time of Operation Auca were a small tribe occupying the jungle of Eastern Ecuador between the Napo and Curaray Rivers, an area of {{approximately}} 20,000 square kilometers (7,700mi²). They numbered approximately 600 people, and were split into three groups, all mutually hostilethe Geketaidi, the Baïidi, and the Wepeidi. They lived on the gathering and cultivation of plant foods like manioc and plantains, as well as fishing and hunting with spear and <b>blowgun.</b> Family units consisted of a man and his wife or wives, their unmarried sons, their married daughters and sons-in-law, and their grandchildren. [...] All of them would reside in a longhouse, which was separated by several kilometers from another longhouse in which close relatives lived. Marriage was always endogenous and typically between cousins, and arranged by the parents of the young people.|$|E

50|$|Projectiles include seeds, clay pellets, and darts. Some {{cultures}} dip {{the tip of}} the darts in curare {{or other}} poisons in order to paralyze the target. <b>Blowguns</b> were very rarely used by these tribes as anti-personnel weapons, but primarily to hunt small game such as monkeys. North American Cherokees were known for making <b>blowguns</b> out of river cane to supplement their diet with rabbits and other small creatures.|$|R

2500|$|A {{corresponding}} film, [...] (featuring Oka, Torrence, Miller, Warburton, Crews and a cameo by Hathaway reprising their roles), {{was released}} on DVD on July 1, 2008, eleven days after the feature film's theatrical release. The film tells a standalone story that takes place concurrently with the events within the film (including {{a scene in which}} Agent 99 calls Lloyd and angrily berates him for the poor quality of her gadgets compared to Max's; that scene takes place immediately after Max accidentally renders himself unconscious with a <b>blowgun</b> during a stakeout in the main film).|$|E
2500|$|Manser {{learned about}} {{survival}} {{skills in the}} jungle and familiarized himself with the Penan's culture and language. The Penan tribal leader in Upper Limbang, named Along Sega, became Manser's mentor. During his stay with the Penan tribe, Manser adopted their way of life. He dressed in a loincloth, hunted with a <b>blowgun,</b> and ate primates, snakes, and sago. Manser's decision to live {{as a member of}} the Penan tribe was ridiculed in the West, and he was dismissed as a [...] "White Tarzan". Within the Penan tribe, however, Manser was known as [...] "Laki Penan" [...] (Penan Man), having earned the respect of the Penan tribe that adopted him.|$|E

60|$|Frank {{placed the}} <b>blowgun</b> to his mouth, {{and in a}} moment his pellet struck the animal smartly {{on the side of the}} head. It gave a short yelp and paused. Another shot struck it, and then Frank, {{snatching}} the water net from Charlie, threw himself over the hedge, and placed himself between the child and the dog just as the latter, with a savage growl, rushed at him.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is a good}} thing," [...] Mr. Goodenough answered. [...] "For {{shooting}} {{sitting there}} is nothing better than a <b>blowgun</b> in skillful hands. They have the advantage too of not breaking the skin; but for flying a shotgun is infinitely more accurate. You will have little difficulty in learning to shoot well, as your eye is already trained {{by the use of}} your blowpipe. Will you want any knives for skinning?" ...|$|E
60|$|One Saturday {{afternoon}} Frank {{started with}} a smaller boy, {{who was one of}} his most devoted followers, for a long country walk. Frank carried his <b>blowgun,</b> and a butterfly net, Charlie Goodall a net of about a foot in depth, made of canvas, mounted on a stout brass rim, and strong stick, for the capture of water beetles. Their pockets bulged with bottles and tin boxes for the carriage of their captured prey.|$|E

You are as good a shot as I am, and I am {{considered}} a fair one. I {{have no doubt that}} with a little practice you will succeed as well with your double barrel. The shooting of birds on the wing is a knack which seems to come naturally to some people, while others, practice as they will, never become good shots." ...|$|E
60|$|Frank {{was ready}} to join {{in a game of}} {{football}} or cricket when wanted, and could hold his own in either. But he vastly preferred to go out for long walks with his <b>blowgun,</b> his net, and his collecting boxes. At home every moment not required for the preparation of his lessons was spent in mounting and arranging his captures. He was quite ready to follow the course his father proposed for him, and to enter the army. Captain Hargate had been a very gallant officer, and the despatches had spoken most highly of the bravery with which he led his company into action in the fight in which he lost his life. Therefore Mrs. Hargate hoped that Frank would have little difficulty in obtaining a commission without purchase when the time for his entering the army arrived.|$|E
6000|$|After {{spending}} two {{or three}} days going about London and enjoying himself with his friend Dick, Frank started for Deal, where he was pleased to find his sister well and happy. He bade goodbye to her, to the doctor, and such of his schoolfellows as lived in Deal, to whom his start for Central Africa was quite an event. Dr. Bateman handed over to him his watch and chain and his <b>blowgun,</b> which he had taken care of for him, also his skinning knives and instruments. The same evening he returned to town, and spent the days very pleasantly until the afternoon came when he was to depart. Then he bade farewell to his kind friends Sir James and Lady Ruthven. Dick accompanied him in the cab to Euston station, where a minute or two later Mr. Goodenough arrived. The luggage was placed in a carriage, and Frank stood chatting with Dick at the door, until the guard's cry, [...] "Take your places!" [...] caused him to jump into the carriage. There was one more hearty handshake with his friend, and then the train steamed out of the station.|$|E

60|$|And {{there the}} {{survivors}} sit, beside the silent stream, beneath the tropic moon; sun-dried and lean, but strong and bold as ever, with the quiet fire of English courage burning undimmed in every eye, and the genial smile of English mirth fresh on every lip; making a jest of danger and a sport of toil, as cheerily {{as when they}} sailed over the bar of Bideford, in days which seem to belong to some antenatal life. Their beards have grown down upon their breasts; their long hair is knotted on their heads, like women's, to keep off the burning sunshine; their leggings are of {{the skin of the}} delicate Guazu-puti deer; their shirts are patched with Indian cotton web; the spoils of jaguar, puma, and ape hang from their shoulders. Their ammunition is long since spent, their muskets, spoilt by the perpetual vapor-bath of the steaming woods, are left behind as useless in a cave by some cataract of the Orinoco: but their swords are bright and terrible as ever; and they carry bows of a strength which no Indian arm can bend, and arrows pointed with the remnants of their armor; many of them, too, are armed with the pocuna or <b>blowgun</b> of the Indians--more deadly, because more silent, than the firearms which they have left behind them. So they have wandered, and so they will wander still, the lords of the forest and its beasts; terrible to all hostile Indians, but kindly, just, and generous to all who will deal faithfully with them; and many a smooth-chinned Carib and Ature, Solimo and Guahiba, recounts with wonder and admiration the righteousness of the bearded heroes, who proclaimed themselves the deadly foes of the faithless and murderous Spaniard, and spoke to them of the great and good queen beyond the seas, who would send her warriors to deliver and avenge the oppressed Indian.|$|E
