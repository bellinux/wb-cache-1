5|$|The Landlord, {{the leader}} of Thongs and Octopus, is played by Michael Hui, a Hong Kong Film Award-winning comedic actor who starred in various box office hits from 1970s to 1990s before emigrating to Canada shortly before the {{handover}} of Hong Kong. Hui was chosen for the part <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> ideal actor to play a character who persuades others to do bad things. The producers had originally intended Hui to fight along with Chan and Koo, however, it was eventually decided that Hui would simply act as the brains of the gang.|$|E
25|$|Fred and Rosamond Vincy are {{the eldest}} {{children}} of Middlemarch's town mayor. Having never finished university, Fred {{is widely considered}} a failure and a layabout, but he allows himself to coast <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> presumed heir of his childless uncle Mr. Featherstone, an unpleasant, though rich, man. Featherstone keeps a niece of his through marriage, Mary Garth, as a companion, and, though she is considered plain, Fred {{is in love with}} her and wants to marry her.|$|E
25|$|During the play-the-ball it is {{customary}} for {{a player}} from the defending team to stand {{directly in front of}} the player playing the ball, called the marker. If no marker is present, the tackled player may tap the ball on his boot to start the next play, instead of the normally required play-the-ball. As the tap is faster to perform than the play-the-ball, giving great advantage to the attack, there is almost always a marker. Usually the person who tackled the player becomes a marker <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> closest to the tackled player. There may be a maximum of two markers for each play-the-ball, the second standing behind the first.|$|E

25|$|Further {{erosion of}} {{independence}} was feared when Rebecca Li Bo-lan – a 30-year veteran graft-buster {{and the first}} female head of the ICAC investigative unit, appointed in June 2015 – was abruptly removed from her job in an unprecedented manner, and no explanation has been forthcoming from the ICAC. Pan-democratic politicians accused chief executive CY Leung of interfering <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> subject of an anti-graft probe over a HK$50million payment Leung received from Australian firm UGL. Democratically elected legislators made allegations, citing internal ICAC sources, that Leung's office had been uncooperative and also impeding the progress of investigations into his own case; the Chief Executive's Office rebutted the claim.|$|E
25|$|Zachariah – Zachariah is the ship's cook who is cast in {{the role}} of the noble character. Early on, he offers Charlotte his {{friendship}} as well as a small knife for her protection. He cares for Charlotte during her first days of seasickness, and seems to be respected by the crew, although he is at times the butt of their jokes <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> only black person on board. He tells Charlotte that he left his home in Africa as a teenager, and had been a sailor ever since. He has never lived in America and has never been a slave. At the end of the book, it becomes clear that he does not realize what his social status would be, even as a free man in Providence, Rhode Island.|$|E
25|$|But these differences, though {{demonstrating a}} Lagašite respect of {{religious}} figures simply {{in the amount}} of time and energy they required, is not as telling as the language Gudea uses to justify any punishment. Whereas Sargon or Naram-Sin simply demand punishment to any who change their words, based on their power, Gudea defends his words through tradition, “since the earliest days, since the seed sprouted forth, no one was (ever) supposed to alter the utterance of a ruler of Lagaš who, after building the Eninnu for my lord Ningirsu, made things function as they should”. Changing the words of Naram-Sin, the living god, is treason, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> king. But changing the words of Gudea, simple governor of Lagaš, is unjust, because he made things work right.|$|E

25|$|In the bible, David {{refuses to}} harm King Saul, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Lord's anointed, even when Saul is seeking his life. And when Saul {{eventually}} is killed in battle {{and a person}} comes to David {{to tell him that}} he helped kill Saul, David puts the man to death, even though Saul had been his enemy, because he had raised his hands against the Lord's anointed. Christian concepts of the inviolability of the person of the monarch have great influence from this story. Diarmait mac Cerbaill, King of Tara (mentioned above), was killed by Áed Dub mac Suibni in 565. According to Adomnan of Iona's Life of St Columba, Áed Dub mac Suibni received God's punishment for this crime by being impaled by a treacherous spear many years later and then falling from his ship into a lake and drowning.|$|E
500|$|The first segment, [...] "The Devil and Homer Simpson", {{was written}} by Daniels and McGrath. The first time Devil Flanders appears, he looks {{the same as the}} devil Chernabog from the 1940 Walt Disney {{produced}} film Fantasia; Silverman particularly admired the animation in that sequence. Oakley loved the idea of Flanders being the Devil <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> one you would least expect. He also thought Harry Shearer {{did a good job of}} playing Flanders in a much darker way, while remaining very true to the character. Many scenes had to be cut to shorten the segment, including one that showed Homer's severed head being used as a bowling ball by a demon in hell. This scene later appeared in the clip show episode [...] "The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular", which aired in the show's seventh season.|$|E

[...] Noticing Ann is angry with Andy, Mark makes a pass at her, but Ann angrily rejects him. Leslie and George show up and are mocked by Tom. After the concert ends, Andy tries to {{stay as long as}} possible to avoid a fight with Ann, but she insists they leave. George goes home because he was falling asleep and Leslie starts to leave, but an intoxicated Mark asks her to stay and have a beer with him.|$|E

500|$|On the {{freighter}} Kahana, mercenary Martin Keamy (Kevin Durand) {{returns from}} his unsuccessful {{attack on the}} Barracks, the former home of the Others. Enraged that his mission was unsuccessful {{and several of his}} colleagues were killed, he accuses [...] Gault (Grant Bowler) of giving him up to Ben, but Gault tells Keamy that Michael is the actual spy. He tries to kill Michael by shooting him, but just as in [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] when Michael tries to commit suicide, the gun jams. Gault then tells Keamy that Michael is vital to repairing the engines, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> one that sabotaged them initially. Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews), fearing Keamy's intentions, uses a Zodiac boat to return to the island, hoping to save as many people as possible. Desmond refuses to accompany him, saying that he would never return to the island after he left.|$|E

[...] The duo begin asking Ben questions about his time as a teen mayor in Partridge, Minnesota, having researched how he bankrupted the town. Ben responds awkwardly, stammering incomprehensibly and unable to defend himself to Crazy Ira and The Douche's taunts. Tom proposes dumping Ben from future media interviews, but Leslie insists they cannot <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{only one who can}} handle complicated questions about its budget. Meanwhile, April (Aubrey Plaza) accepts an offer from Chris (Rob Lowe) to move to Indianapolis to be his secretary. Andy (Chris Pratt) begs April to reconsider, offering to perform all the errands that she hates doing for a month. Ron (Nick Offerman) volunteers to help, claiming that {{he does not want to}} lose April as an assistant while denying he cares about April and Andy's relationship. Ann (Rashida Jones) is increasingly frustrated that Chris has not asked her about coming to Indianapolis with him, and is concerned about where their relationship is headed.|$|E
500|$|The Final Frontier, the {{previous}} {{film in the}} series, was a critical and financial disappointment; {{the cast and crew}} were worried that the franchise {{would not be able to}} recover from the blow. With the looming 25th anniversary of [...] in 1991, producer Harve Bennett revisited an idea Ralph Winter had for the fourth film: a prequel featuring young versions of Kirk and Spock at Starfleet Academy. The prequel was designed to be a way of keeping the characters, if not the actors, in what was called [...] "Top Gun in outer space". Bennett and The Final Frontier writer David Loughery wrote a script entitled The Academy Years, where Dr. Leonard McCoy talks about how he met Kirk and Spock while addressing a group of Academy graduates. The script shows Kirk and Spock's upbringing, their meeting McCoy and Montgomery Scott at the Academy and defeating a villain before parting ways. The script would have established that George Kirk, James T. Kirk's father, was a pilot who went missing—presumed dead—during a warp experiment with Scott. The script is set before the [...] "enlightenment" [...] of the Federation; slavery and racism are common, with Spock being bullied <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> only Vulcan student. Nurse Christine Chapel cameos in the script's climax.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{original}} Rolling Stone review for Haggard's 1968 album Mama Tried, Andy Wickham wrote, [...] "His songs romanticize the hardships and tragedies of America's transient proletarian and his success is resultant of his inherent {{ability to relate}} to his audience a commonplace experience with precisely the right emotional pitch....
