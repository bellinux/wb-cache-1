Rabbi Bulka, Prime Minister Harper, MP Elizabeth May, who is <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>tonight,</b> {{and many other}} speakers spoke eloquently there about the systematic, state-sponsored intended annihilation of Jewish Europe. The words of Jesus, “Love one another as I have loved you ” link explicitly love of God and love of neighbour. The two great commandments, found in both the New Testament and the Torah, complement each other. Love of God is love of neighbour; love of neighbour is love of God. Similar thoughts {{can be found in}} the holy books of other spiritual communities. Courageous Christians and members of other religions saved Jewish neighbours during the Holocaust, well knowing that, if discovered, they would be shot by the Nazis. There is at least one survivor of the Holocaust here tonight whose life was saved by a series of brave Christians. There are religiously free countries of many faith backgrounds. Paul Marshall, author of books on religion and politics, says Latin America has become one of the most religiously free regions in the world.
