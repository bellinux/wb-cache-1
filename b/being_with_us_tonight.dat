Courageous Christians and members of other religions saved Jewish neighbours during the Holocaust, well knowing that, if discovered, they would be shot by the Nazis. There is at least one survivor of the Holocaust here tonight whose life was saved by a series of brave Christians. There are religiously free countries of many faith backgrounds. Paul Marshall, author of books on religion and politics, says Latin America has become one of the most religiously free regions in the world.
