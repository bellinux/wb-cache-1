25|$|Histograms are {{sometimes}} confused with bar charts. A histogram {{is used for}} continuous data, where the bins represent ranges of data, while a <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> is a plot of categorical variables. Some authors recommend that bar charts have gaps between the rectangles to clarify the distinction.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} prisoners {{related to the}} Basque National Liberation Movement has varied {{over the years as}} can be seen in the {{following}} <b>bar</b> <b>chart.</b> It begins in 1978, after the amnesty of 1977, which made it illegal to bring to trial any Franco era crime, and also gave amnesty to all prisoners who had committed crimes with a political root during Franco's dictatorship and the Spanish transition to democracy.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Bar</b> <b>charts</b> have a {{discrete}} range. <b>Bar</b> <b>charts</b> are usually scaled {{so that all}} the data can fit on the <b>chart.</b> <b>Bars</b> on the <b>chart</b> may be arranged in any order. <b>Bar</b> <b>charts</b> arranged from highest to lowest incidence are called Pareto <b>charts.</b> Normally, <b>bars</b> showing frequency will be arranged in chronological (time) sequence.|$|R
50|$|Composite <b>bar</b> <b>charts</b> are <b>bar</b> <b>charts</b> {{where each}} <b>bar</b> {{displays}} multiple data points stacked {{in a single}} row or column. This may, for instance, {{take the form of}} uniform height <b>bars</b> <b>charting</b> a time series with internal stacked colours indicating the percentage participation of a sub-type of data. Another example would be a time series displaying total numbers, with internal colors indicating participation in the total by sub-types.|$|R

25|$|The {{data for}} the <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> comes from Etxerat, the {{association}} of family members of these prisoners, and the EPPK (Euskal Preso Politikoen Kolektiboa). However {{it should be noted}} that some prisoners choose not to be part of Etxerat, or have been expelled, and so the number of Basque National Liberation Movement prisoners is approximately 7% more than these figures. For example, in 2005 Etxerat reported 507 prisoners were held in Spanish prisons, while the Spanish prison service stated that there were 544 related to ETA.|$|E
25|$|As {{shown in}} the <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> below, {{investment}} levels increased substantially {{during much of the}} 1990s, from US$39 million in 1990 to a peak of US$422 million in 1997. Since then investments have declined again to US$106 million in 2004 and US$190 million in 2005. Total investment between 1990 and 2005 was at US$43.3 billion, the average being at US$205m p.a. Investments are financed through programs providing subsidies to municipal utilities, as well as to a limited extent by internal cash generation and debt.|$|E
25|$|The Marimekko {{name has}} been adopted within {{business}} and the management consultancy industry {{to refer to a}} specific type of <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> known as a variable-width chart or Mosaic plot in which all the bars are of equal height, there are no spaces between the bars, and the bars are in turn each divided into segments of different width. The design of the mosaic plot resembles a Marimekko print. The chart's design encodes two variables (such as percentage of sales and market share), but it is criticised for making the data hard to perceive and to compare visually.|$|E
40|$|Information graphics, such as <b>bar</b> <b>charts,</b> grouped <b>bar</b> <b>charts,</b> {{and line}} graphs, are an {{important}} component of multimodal documents and cannot be ignored. When such graphics appear in popular media, such as magazines and newspapers, they generally have an intended message. We argue that this message represents a brief summary of the graphic’s high-level content, and thus can {{serve as the basis for}} more robust information extraction from multimodal documents. The paper describes our methodology for automatically recognizing the intended message of an information graphic, with a focus on grouped <b>bar</b> <b>charts...</b>|$|R

40|$|Specifies if a bar will {{be drawn}} at the plot points of each trace on {{subsequent}} plots. DESCRIPTION DATAPLOT can draw a trace as a character or plot symbol at each point, as a connected line, as a spike from the point to a base, as a bar from the plot point to a base, or as some combination of the above. The choice {{is determined by the}} BAR, SPIKE, CHARACTER, and LINE commands. The switches for these commands work independently so that a plot point can be any combination of these (or even none of them). The BAR switch is most commonly used to generate <b>bar</b> <b>charts.</b> The following types of <b>bar</b> <b>charts</b> are commonly used in business and presentation graphics: 1. Standard <b>bar</b> <b>charts</b> (a <b>bar</b> is drawn from the data point to the X axis); 2. Grouped <b>bar</b> <b>charts</b> (<b>bars</b> are drawn for 2 or more groups of data); 3. Stacked (or divided) <b>bar</b> <b>charts</b> (the <b>bar</b> is divided into several intervals). All of these formats are possible using DATAPLOT. At least one example of each of these formats is given in the PROGRAM section. DATAPLOT provides commands to control the various aspects of the bar (see the RELATED COMMANDS section). Many of these are also demonstrated with the sample programs. Many analysts prefer that <b>bar</b> <b>charts</b> be drawn vertically rather than horizontally. This is straightforward to do and is demonstrated with the sample programs...|$|R

5000|$|A <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> or {{bar graph}} is a chart with {{rectangular}} bars with lengths {{proportional to the}} values that they represent. The bars can be plotted vertically or horizontally. A vertical <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> is sometimes called a column <b>bar</b> <b>chart.</b>|$|E
50|$|Bar graphs {{can also}} be used for more complex {{comparisons}} of data with grouped bar charts and stacked bar charts. In a grouped <b>bar</b> <b>chart,</b> for each categorical group there are two or more bars. These bars are color-coded to represent a particular grouping. For example, a business owner with two stores might make a grouped <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> with different colored bars to represent each store: the horizontal axis would show the months of the year and the vertical axis would show the revenue. Alternatively, a stacked <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> could be used. The stacked <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> stacks bars that represent different groups on top of each other. The height of the resulting bar shows the combined result of the groups. However, stacked bar charts are not suited to datasets where some groups have negative values. In such cases, grouped <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> are preferable.|$|E

40|$|Simple {{presentation}} graphics are intuitive and easy-to-use, but show only highly aggregated data and present {{only a very}} limited number of data values (as {{in the case of}} <b>bar</b> <b>charts),</b> and may have a high degree of overlap which may occlude {{a significant portion of the}} data values (as in the case of the x-y plots). In this paper, we therefore propose a generalization of traditional <b>bar</b> <b>charts</b> and x-y-plots which allows the visualization of large amounts of data. The basic idea is to use the pixels within the bars to present the detailed information of the data records. Our so-called pixel <b>bar</b> <b>charts</b> retain the intuitiveness of traditional <b>bar</b> <b>charts</b> while allowing very large data sets to be visualized in an effective way. We show that, for an effective pixel placement, we have to solve complex optimization problems, and present an algorithm which efficiently solves the problem.

40|$|Abstract—One of {{the common}} {{problems}} businesses need to solve is how to use large volumes of sales histories, Web transactions, and other data to understand the behavior of their customers and increase their revenues. <b>Bar</b> <b>charts</b> are widely used for daily analysis, but only show highly aggregated data. Users often need to visualize detailed multidimensional information reflecting the health of their businesses. In this paper, we propose an innovative visualization solution based {{on the use of}} value cells within <b>bar</b> <b>charts</b> to represent business metrics. The value of a transaction can be discretized into one or multiple cells: high-value transactions are mapped to multiple value cells, whereas many small-value transactions are combined into one cell. With value-cell <b>bar</b> <b>charts,</b> users can 1) visualize transaction value distributions and correlations, 2) identify high-value transactions and outliers at a glance, and 3) instantly display values at the transaction record level. Value-Cell <b>Bar</b> <b>Charts</b> have been applied with success to different sales and IT service usage applications, demonstrating the benefits of the technique over traditional charting techniques. A comparison with two variants of the well-known Treemap technique and our earlier work on Pixel <b>Bar</b> <b>Charts</b> is also included.
