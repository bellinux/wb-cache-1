Despite the absence of bile ducts and bile canaliculi, the hepatocytes have some features which resemble those of cells in the livers of other vertebrates. Hepatocytes are characterised by large gap junctions, many cytoplasmic inclusions, and large deposits of iron. The latter is present throughout the cytoplasmic matrix and within large inclusion bodies which may arise through sequestration of parts of the cytoplasm by membrane isolation. There is no evidence for the involvement of hepatocytes in glucose metabolism but their fine structure reflects the production of <b>bile</b> <b>products</b> and the processing of lipoproteins.

40|$|Primary biliary {{cirrhosis}} (PBC) {{and primary}} sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) represent the major clinical entities of chronic cholestatic liver diseases. Both disorders {{are characterized by}} portal inflammation and slowly progress to obliterative fibrosis and eventually liver cirrhosis. Although immune-pathogenic mechanisms have been implicated in the pathogenesis of PBC and PSC, neither disorder {{is considered to be}} a classical autoimmune disease, as PSC and PBC patients do not respond to immune-suppressants. Furthermore, the decreased bile flow resulting from the immune-mediated tissue assault and the subsequent accumulation of toxic <b>bile</b> <b>products</b> in PBC and PSC not only perpetuates biliary epithelial damage, but also alters the composition of the intestinal and biliary microbiota and its mutual interactions with the host. Consistent with the close association of PSC and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the polyclonal hyper IgM response in PBC and (auto-) antibodies which cross-react to microbial antigens in both diseases, an expansion of individual microbes leads to shifts in the composition of the intestinal or biliary microbiota and a subsequent altered integrity of epithelial layers, promoting microbial translocation.

40|$|Background: The {{intestine}} {{is responsible}} for absorbing dietary lipids and delivering them to the organism as triglyceriderich lipoproteins (TRL). It is important to determine how this process is regulated in enterocytes, the absorptive cells of the intestine, as prolonged postprandial hypertriglyceridemia is a known risk factor for atherosclerosis. During the postprandial period, dietary lipids, mostly triglycerides (TG) hydrolyzed by pancreatic enzymes, are combined with <b>bile</b> <b>products</b> and reach the apical membrane of enterocytes as postprandial micelles (PPM). Our aim {{was to determine whether}} these micelles induce, in enterocytes, specific early cell signaling events that could control the processes leading to TRL secretion. Methodology/Principal Findings: The effects of supplying PPM to the apex of Caco- 2 /TC 7 enterocytes were analyzed. Micelles devoid of TG hydrolysis products, like those present in the intestinal lumen in the interprandial period, were used as controls. The apical delivery of PPM specifically induced a number of cellular events that are not induced by interprandial micelles. These early events included the trafficking of apolipoprotein B, a structural component of TRL, from apical towards secretory domains, and the rapid, dose-dependent activation of ERK and p 38 MAPK. PPM supply induced the scavenger receptor SR-BI/CLA- 1 to cluster at the apical brush border membrane and to move from non-raft to raft domains. Competition, inhibition or knockdown of SR-BI/CLA- 1 impaired the PPM-dependent apoB trafficking and ERK activation. Conclusions/Significance: These results are the first evidence that enterocytes specifically sense postprandial dietary lipidcontainin...|$|R

40|$|The marked {{deficiency}} of peroxisomal organelle assembly in the PEX 2 (-/-) mouse model for Zellweger syndrome provides {{a unique opportunity}} to developmentally and biochemically characterize hepatic disease progression and <b>bile</b> acid <b>products.</b> The postnatal survival of homozygous mutants enabled us to evaluate the response to bile acid replenishment in this disease state. PEX 2 mutant liver has severe but transient intrahepatic cholestasis that abates in the early postnatal period and progresses to steatohepatitis by postnatal day 36. We confirmed the expected reduction of mature C 24 bile acids, accumulation of C 27 -bile acid intermediates, and low total bile acid level in liver and bile from these mutant mice. Treating the PEX 2 (-/-) mice with bile acids prolonged postnatal survival, alleviated intrahepatic cholestasis and intestinal malabsorption, reduced C 27 -bile acid intermediate production, and prevented older mutants from developing severe steatohepatitis. However, this therapy exacerbated the degree of hepatic steatosis and worsened the already severe mitochondrial and cellular damage in peroxisome-deficient liver. Both untreated and bile acid-fed PEX 2 (-/-) mice accumulated high levels of predominantly unconjugated bile acids in plasma because of altered expression of hepatocyte bile acid transporters. Significant amounts of unconjugated bile acids were also found in the liver and bile of PEX 2 mutants, indicating a generalized defect in bile acid conjugation. CONCLUSION: Peroxisome deficiency widely disturbs bile acid homeostasis and hepatic functioning in mice, and the high sensitivity of the peroxisome-deficient liver to bile acid toxicity limits the effectiveness of bile acid therapy for preventing hepatic diseas...|$|R

40|$|<b>Bile</b> acids, the <b>products</b> of {{oxidative}} catabolism {{of cholesterol}} by the liver, {{play an important}} role in the intestinal absorption of fat. Recent work suggests that these amphipathic sterols act not only as simple emulsifying agents but, more impor-tantly, also as the basic micellar structure into which the poorly soluble amphiphylic monoglycer-ides and long chain fatty acids become solubilized (1). It is largely as a consequence of the forma-tion of these "mixed micelles " that absorption of fat into the mucosal cells of the gastrointestinal tract is facilitated. It has been appreciated for many years that bile acids undergo an enterohepatic circulation with ab-sorption from the gastrointestinal tract followed by rapid clearance from the blood as the liver se-cretes these acid sterols back into the bile. The intestinal absorptive phase of this cycle is of con-siderable theoretical as well as clinical interest, since an understanding of the transport mecha-nisms whereby bile acids normally are able to penetrate the mucosal cell barrier no doubt will be necessary before the elucidation of the pathophysi-ology of certain malabsorption syndromes associ-ated with deranged bile acid metabolism is pos-sible. Yet, despite the potential physiologic im-portance of bile acid absorption, little detailed data are currently available concerning the transport of these sterols.

40|$|Gunn rats lack {{bilirubin}} UDP-glycosyltransferases, but diazo-negative derivatives of bilirubin {{have been}} described in their bile. In order to investigate this alternative disposal of bilirubin, crude bile samples from Gunn and Wistar rats were directly analysed by h. p. l. c. Besides bilirubin (in Gunn rats) or its glycosides (in Wistar rats), two major compounds were detected. A yellow one corresponded to the previously documented vitamin B- 2 and was equally prominent in Gunn rats or Wistar-rat bile. The other compound was colourless, but on standing in contact with air it was spontaneously oxidized to a pinkish-yellow pigment. It was far more prominent in Gunn-rat bile. Analysis of bile obtained after intravenous injection of [14 C]bilirubin to Gunn rats demonstrated that this compound was highly labelled. Freezing and thawing of the bile resulted {{in the formation of}} a series of diazo-negative derivatives, demonstrating that the original compound was quite labile. Spectral (adsorption and fluorescent) and chromatographic (h. p. l. c., t. l. c. and paper chromatography) analysis of the oxidized form of the labelled compound allowed its identification as urobilin-i. The colourless compound secreted in bile was urobilinogen-i. Administration of neomycin and bacitracin to Gunn rats or gut resection suppressed the biliary excretion of urobilinogen and thus confirmed its intestinal origin. Urobilinogen seems thus to represent the major bilirubin derivative present in Gunn-rat <b>bile.</b> Its breakdown <b>products</b> might represent the so-far-unidentified diazo-negative polar bilirubin derivatives.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Biliary casts {{develop in}} up to 18 % of liver {{transplant}} recipients. Casts are associated with morbidity, graft failure, need for retransplantation, and mortality. Proposed etiological mechanisms include acute cellular rejection, ischemia, infection, and biliary obstruction. We aimed to identify clinical features associated with biliary cast formation, review treatments, and analyze the biochemical composition of casts at a single, large, liver transplant center. METHODS: Patient records were reviewed retrospectively to identify patients who developed casts. Data were collected with attention to ischemia, rejection, obstruction, infection, immunosuppression, postoperative biliary drain use, and cast-directed management, and were compared with data from controls. Cast specimens, retrieved at cholangiography, were analyzed with chromatography techniques. RESULTS: Ischemic factors were noted in 70 % (7 / 10) of cast patients versus 15 % (6 / 40) of controls (OR = 13. 2; 95 % CI = 2. 7 - 66. 0; p = 0. 001). Biliary strictures were present in 50 % of cast patients versus 10 % of controls (OR = 9. 0; 95 % CI = 1. 8 - 45. 2; p = 0. 01). Differences in cold ischemia time, acute cellular rejection, cyclosporin use, infection, and postoperative biliary drain use were not significant. Casts were successfully treated by endoscopic and percutaneous methods in 60 % of patients. One patient died of cast-related complications (mortality 10 %). Four casts were in satisfactory condition for biochemical analysis. Bilirubin was the main component (∼ 10 - 50 %). <b>Bile</b> acid synthesis <b>products</b> and cholesterol comprised smaller percentages, and protein comprised only 5 - 10 %.

40|$|AbstractThe {{glutathione}} conjugate of 2 -furamide {{has been}} screened for and structurally characterized by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) {{by using a}} hybrid instrument of BEqQ design. Mass spectrometry experiments employed fast atom bombardment (FAB) ionization of a crude bile extract from a rat dosed with a 1 : 1 mixture of unlabeled and [13 C 1] 2 -furamide. Initial screening for glutathione conjugates employed constant neutral loss scanning to detect the loss of 129 u, corresponding {{to the loss of}} the γ-glutamyl moiety of the conjugates. By direct comparison with control bile, [M + H]+ ions of m/z 417 and 418 were readily identified as candidate ions corresponding to the glutathione conjugates of unlabeled and 13 C-labeled 2 -furamide. Complementary screening information was generated by using a methylated bile extract, with constant neutral loss scanning to detect the loss of the methylated γ-glutamyl moiety (143 u). An alternative screening procedure employing parent ion scanning to detect the sodium adducts of methylated glutathione conjugates was also developed. Structural information was generated by first-generation product ion scanning of the protonated and sodium cationized forms of the candidate species, both native and derivatized. This provided a body of internally consistent evidence that the conjugate retains the pseudoaromatic furan ring system without ring hydroxylation. The utility of sequential mass spectrometry (MS/MS/MS) capability of the hybrid instrument in the analysis of complex biological mixtures was also demonstrated. Using the <b>bile</b> extract, first-generation <b>product</b> ions that formed in either the first or second field-free region of the double-focusing portion of the instrument were subsequently collisionally activated in the rf-only quadrupole followed by mass analysis of the second-generation product ions.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the contribution of}} plasma-derived phosphatidylcholine (PC) to bile PC, the hepatic processing and biliary secretion of liposome-associated PC was studied in rats. For this purpose, small unilamellar vesicles (SUV), containing trace amounts of [2 -palmitoyl- 9, 10 - 3 H]dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine ([palmitoyl- 3 H]DPPC), [choline- 14 C]-dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine ([choline- 14 C]DPPC), di[14 C]palmitoylphosphatidylcholine ([14 C]DPPC) or di[1 - 14 C]-oleoylphosphatidylcholine ([14 C]DOPC), were administered intravenously to unanaesthetized rats, equipped with permanent catheters in heart and bile duct. Biliary secretion of the 14 C-head-group label of DPPC was very slow (0. 3 % of injected dose in 4 h), whereas the [3 H]palmitoyl label was secreted {{at a much higher}} rate (16 % in 4 h), but only after substantial catabolism of the acyl chain. To study the latter process in more detail, we compared hepatic metabolism and biliary secretion of [1 - 14 C]acyl-labelled DPPC and DOPC. In rats with an 8 -day <b>bile</b> drainage, degradation <b>products</b> of the oleoyl chain were utilized for synthesis of bile acids, which were subsequently secreted into the bile (2 % in 6 h). A much smaller fraction (0. 6 % in 6 h) was secreted as PC and lyso-PC. When bile drainage was started immediately after SUV injection, i. e. a situation with a low hepatic bile acid synthesis rate and a high phospholipid secretion, the secretion of [14 C]DOPC-derived radioactivity in the form of bile acids was decreased (0. 2 % in 6 h), and that as (lyso-) PC increased (1. 5 % in 6 h). Biliary secretion of DPPC palmitoyl chains in bile-diverted rats was much less than that of the oleoyl chains, and occurred predominantly as PC and lyso-PC (0. 6 %, compared with 0. 4 % as bile acids in 6 h). Breath analyses demonstrated that a considerable fraction of both acyl chains was oxidized to CO 2 and expired: 25. 1 % of the administered label for oleoyl chains and 13. 4 % for palmitoyl chains respectively in a 4 h period. The results {{of this study indicate that}} liposomal PC is only minimally secreted into bile via a direct pathway; the bulk is extensively degraded in the liver. Resulting products are partly secreted into bile, as bile acid or as resynthesized PC. There appears to be a quantitative difference in the metabolism of oleoyl and palmitoyl acyl chains...|$|R

Bile acids, endogenously produced by the host liver, represent both a strong selective pressure for potential colonizers, aswell as substrates for microbial metabolism. Indeed, microbes have evolved enzymes to deconjugate bile salts, epimerize bile acid hydroxyl groups, and 7 alpha-dehydroxylateprimary <b>bile</b> acids. The <b>products</b> of microbial 7 alpha-dehydroxylation, secondary bile acids, are suggested by numerous lines of evidence {{to be involved in}} promoting colon carcinogenesis. 7 alpha-dehydroxylating activity is a multi-step pathway, genes of which have only been identified in a small number of organisms within the genusClostridium. The biochemistry of this pathway has been largely worked out. The third step in the pathway is introduction of a delta- 4 -double bond; however, the gene product(s) responsible have not been identified. The baiCD and baiH genes were cloned, expressed and shown to have NAD-dependent 3 -oxo-delta- 4 -steroid oxidoreductase activity showing stereospecificity for 7 alpha-hydroxy and 7 beta-hydroxy bile acid, respectively. In addition, bai genes were isolated from C. hylemonae TN 271 by bidirectional genome-walking by PCR. This represents the first report of bai genes from a 2 ̆ 2 low activity 2 ̆ 2 7 alpha-dehydroxylating bacterium. The gene organization and sequence of the baiBCDEFGHI operon was highly conserved between C. hylemonae TN 271 and the 2 ̆ 2 high activity 2 ̆ 2 7 alpha-dehydroxylating bacterium C. scindens VPI 12708. The baiA gene was located by PCR using degenerate oligonucleotides. Bi-directional genome-walking revealed what appears to be several novel genes involved in bile acid metabolism which were also located in C. scindens VPI 12708. Expression of a 62 kDa flavoprotein and reactionwith [24 - 14 C] 3 -oxo-DCA and NADP resulted in a product of greater hydrophilicity than deoxycholic acid. The identity of this product was not determined. A second gene appears to share a common evolutionary origin with the baiF gene. A hypothesis is offered regarding the function of these homologues as Type III CoA transferasesrecognizing 5 alpha-bile acids, or 5 beta-bile acids (allo-bile acids). A third gene encodes a putative short chain reductase, similar in size and predicted function to the baiA gene, which may be involved in the final reductive step in the pathway. These novel genes also contained a conserved upstream regulatory region with the baioxidative genes. Finally, two genes were identified which may serve as potential drug targets to inhibit bile acid 7 alpha-dehydroxylation. The first is an ABC transporter which may be co-transcribed with the other novel bile acid metabolizing genes, and {{what appears to be a}} bile acid sensor/regulator similar to the Tryptophan-rich sensory protein (TspO) /mitochondrial peripheral benzodiazepinereceptor (MBR) family of proteins...|$|R
