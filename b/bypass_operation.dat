40|$|<b>Bypass</b> <b>operations</b> {{have proved}} to be an {{effective}} treatment for advanced coronary artery disease. Randomized clinical trials have now shown that compared with medical treatment, <b>bypass</b> <b>operations</b> enhance survival in patients who have three-vessel disease or left main coronary stenosis. The goals of both medical and surgical treatment should be to improve a patient's quality of life, extend survival and reduce medical care costs. Preliminary data suggest that <b>bypass</b> <b>operations</b> may be less costly than medical treatment in patients with severe angina that requires repeated or prolonged stays in hospital...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground: Off-pump {{coronary}} artery operations have recently gained popularity among {{the community of}} cardiac surgeons. Because the use of cardiopulmonary bypass is avoided, full anticoagulation is generally not sought to decrease perioperative blood loss and transfusion needs. Traditionally, patients undergoing {{coronary artery}} <b>bypass</b> <b>operations</b> with cardiopulmonary <b>bypass</b> are not considered {{at risk of having}} venous or arterial thromboembolic complications, and prophylaxis is generally not recommended. Methods and results: We have reviewed our experience with off-pump coronary <b>bypass</b> <b>operations,</b> focusing on thromboembolic complications with clinical manifestations, and compared these findings with our experience with cardiopulmonary <b>bypass</b> <b>operations.</b> In our series of 500 off-pump cases, thromboembolic complications occurred in 1 %, causing death in 1 patient, whereas in a contemporary cohort of 1476 patients operated on with cardiopulmonary bypass, thromboembolic complications resulted in stroke in 0. 5 % of the cases. This difference did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions: Thromboembolic complications in off-pump coronary <b>bypass</b> <b>operations</b> are comparable with those in cardiopulmonary <b>bypass</b> <b>operations.</b> Although the prevalence of this complication remains low, the associated morbidity should lead to reconsideration of prophylactic measures.

During his program, Berg called Kaplan on the phone. When she answered, he introduced her as “a vile human being” and praised Nancy Kissinger's attack on her. After Kaplan hung up, Berg continued to ridicule Kaplan and abuse her verbally for the remainder of the program.

Perioperative myocardial damage was shown in eight patients and myocardial ischaemia in 15 patients when assessed by thallium imaging during exercise. Thallium imaging proved more sensitive than electrocardiography in the demonstration of perioperative infarction and in the detection of postoperative ischaemia. Exercise electrocardiography may be misleading after aortocoronary <b>bypass</b> <b>operations.</b> Thallium imaging offers a simple, objective evaluation of the results of revascularisation procedures, throws light on the mechanisms of relief of angina by operation, and helps in the assessment of the patient whose progress is unsatisfactory after operation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractCerebral {{dysfunction}} after {{coronary artery}} <b>bypass</b> <b>operations</b> represents some {{to the most}} serious and costly complications of cardiac surgery, We used transcranial Doppler ultrasonography to detect and quantify the number of microemboli in the right middle cerebral artery of patients undergoing elective first coronary <b>bypass</b> <b>operations</b> (n = 117) and second coronary <b>bypass</b> <b>operations</b> (n = 10). We hypothesized that total microemboli were related to clinical outcome. A 2 MHz transducer was positioned {{in front of the}} ear above the zygomatic arch and depth gated to 50 mm. Microemboli were recorded as perturbations of the blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery and aurally monitored. Each episode of mircroembolism was specified both by clock time and as perfusion or surgical event. Forty-one patients (32 %) completed neurophysiologic evaluation with a battery of tests for cognitive function. Anxiety states and traits were also assessed. The distribution of microembolism showed that there were three groups of patients 60 (n = 24). Seven of 10 patients with cerebral complications (stroke, coma delirium, aberrant behavior) were in the > 60 microemboli group. Those with cerebral complications had 20. 7 ± 4. 5 from perfusion and system symptoms had 95. 5 ± 19. 5 microemboli from perfusion and 36. 0 ± 6. 9 from surgical events. Neuropsychological scores were most often depressed for memory (73 %), comprehension (49 %), attention (46 %), and constructional ability (44 %). The greatest change was in total score in the > 60 microemboli group (- 3. 3 ± 0. 6) compared with - 1. 1 ± 0. 2 and 1. 1 ± 0. 2 for the 30 to 59 and 60 microemboli group. We concluded that transcranial Doppler ultrasonography is a useful technique to quantify and detect the source of microemboli during coronary artery <b>bypass</b> <b>operations</b> and may be useful in assesing new operative stragteies, the quality of the perfusion, and poentially as an indicator for pharmacologic therapy in the operationg room in patients with high microemboli counts.
