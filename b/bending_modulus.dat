The area compression modulus Ka, <b>bending</b> <b>modulus</b> Kb, and edge energy , can be used to describe them.

Ka and Kb affect the ability of proteins and small molecules to insert into the bilayer, and bilayer mechanical properties have been shown to alter the function of mechanically activated ion channels. Bilayer mechanical properties also govern what types of stress a cell can withstand without tearing.

5|$|In {{contrast}} to Ka, {{which is a}} measure of how much energy is needed to stretch the bilayer, Kb {{is a measure of}} how much energy is needed to bend or flex the bilayer. Formally, <b>bending</b> <b>modulus</b> is defined as the energy required to deform a membrane from its intrinsic curvature to some other curvature. Intrinsic curvature is defined by the ratio of the diameter of the head group to that of the tail group. For two-tailed PC lipids, this ratio is nearly one so the intrinsic curvature is nearly zero. If a particular lipid has too large a deviation from zero intrinsic curvature it will not form a bilayer and will instead form other phases such as micelles or inverted micelles. Addition of small hydrophilic molecules like sucrose into mixed lipid lamellar liposomes made from galactolipid-rich thylakoid membranes destabilises bilayers into micellar phase. Typically, Kb is not measured experimentally but rather is calculated from measurements of Ka and bilayer thickness, since the three parameters are related.|$|E

Motivated by experimental realizations of such systems made of biopolymer filaments and motor proteins, we describe a large-scale simulation study of a particle-based computational model that explicitly incorporates the semiflexibility of the biopolymers. We find that energy injected into the system at the particle scale preferentially excites bend deformations, renormalizing the filament <b>bend</b> <b>modulus</b> to smaller values. The emergent characteristics of the active nematic depend on activity and flexibility only through this activity-renormalized <b>bend</b> <b>modulus,</b> demonstrating that material parameters such as the Frank `constants' must explicitly depend on activity in a continuum hydrodynamic description of an active nematic. Further, we present a systematic way to estimate these material parameters from observations of deformation fields and defect shapes in experimental or simulation data...|$|R

The tensile elastic <b>modulus,</b> <b>bend</b> elastic <b>modulus</b> and tensile {{strength}} of the composite materials hose were determined by uniaxial tension test and three point bending test.

5000|$|<b>Bending</b> <b>modulus</b> {{is defined}} as the energy {{required}} to deform a membrane from its natural curvature to some other curvature. For an ideal bilayer the intrinsic curvature is zero, so this expression is somewhat simplified. The <b>bending</b> <b>modulus,</b> compression modulus and bilayer thickness are related by [...] such that if two of these parameters are known the other can be calculated. This relationship derives from the fact that to bend the inner face must be compressed and the outer face must be stretched. The thicker the membrane, the more each face must deform to accommodate a given curvature (see bending moment). Many of the values for Ka in literature have actually been calculated from experimentally measured values of Kb and t. This relation holds only for small deformations, but this is generally a good approximation as most lipid bilayers can support only a few percent strain before rupturing.|$|E

For the <b>bending</b> elasticity <b>modulus</b> of SOPC bilayers, the value of (0. 93 ± 0. 03) × 10 - 12 erg was obtained.

The sphere is adiabatically compressed until we reach a jammed nematic state with maximum packing density. The nematic state exhibits four + 1 / 2 disclinations arrayed on a great circle rather than at the vertices of a regular tetrahedron. This arises from the high elastic anisotropy of the system in which splay (K_ 1) is far softer than bending (K_ 3). We also introduce and study a lattice nematic model on S^ 2 with tunable elastic constants and map out the preferred defect locations as a function of elastic anisotropy.
