50|$|An {{interesting}} form of <b>ballistic</b> <b>galvanometer</b> is the Grassot fluxmeter. In {{order to}} operate correctly, the discharge time through the regular <b>ballistic</b> <b>galvanometer</b> must be {{shorter than the}} period of oscillation. For some applications, especially those involving inductors, this condition cannot be met. The Grassot fluxmeter solves this. Its construction {{is similar to that}} of a <b>ballistic</b> <b>galvanometer,</b> but its coil is suspended without any restoring forces in the suspension thread or in the current leads. The core (bobbin) of the coil is of a non-conductive material. When an electric charge is connected to the instrument, the coil starts moving in the magnetic field of the galvanometer's magnet, generating an opposing e.m.f. and coming to a stop regardless of the time of the current flow. The change in the coil position is proportional only to the quantity of charge. The coil is returned to the zero position by the reversing of the current or manually.|$|E
50|$|A <b>ballistic</b> <b>galvanometer</b> {{is a type}} of {{sensitive}} galvanometer, commonly a mirror galvanometer. Unlike a current-measuring galvanometer, the moving part has a large moment of inertia, thus giving it a long oscillation period. It is really an integrator measuring the quantity of charge discharged through it. It can be either of the moving coil or moving magnet type.|$|E

50|$|In 1924, the German {{psychiatrist}} Hans Berger connected {{a couple}} of electrodes (small round discs of metal) to a patient's scalp and detected a small current by using a <b>ballistic</b> <b>galvanometer.</b> During the years 1929-1938 he published 14 reports about his studies of EEGs, and much of our modern knowledge of the subject, especially in the middle frequencies, is due to his research. Berger analyzed EEGs qualitatively, but in 1932 G. Dietsch applied Fourier analysis to seven records of EEG {{and became the first}} researcher of what later is called QEEG (quantitative EEG).|$|E

40|$|In a {{previous}} article [1] we have described some experiments {{in which a}} coil of copper wire was rotated about its axis at a high speed and then suddenly brought to rest, {{the ends of the}} coil being connected with a sensitive <b>ballistic</b> <b>galvanometer</b> which permitted a measurement of the pulse of current which was produced at the instant of stopping by the tendency of the electrons to continue in motion. We have continued these experiments making use of three new windings of copper wire, and using two different windings each of silver and aluminium wire. These further experiments were made not only because it seems desirable to subject so new a phenomenon to a more rigid test, but because it is also desirable to see if the mass of the carrier of electricity is the same in all different metals and how much it differs, if at all, from the mass of the electron in free space. The only change that we have made in our apparatus as described in the earlier article was to provide a small bowl-shaped metallic cover to protect the binding posts on the rotating wheel from air friction. This was particularly important when our coil mas of aluminium or silver in helping to reduce accidental thermoelectric forces which arose at the junction of the coil with the copper wires which led to the galvanometer...|$|E
40|$|Mercury drops falling {{vertically}} {{through an}} electrolyte may be deflected from their course by {{application of a}} horizontal field in the electrolyte. A method of photographing the curve followed by any drop is described, and it is shown possible to deduce the ionic charge on the drop from {{a study of the}} shape of the curve. In Sulphuric acid of fixed concentration the drop charge is found to be proportional to its volume. Results are also given for the charges in various acid concentrations between 0. 1 N and 0. 001 N. All charges are found to be reduced when the acid is saturated with mercurous sulphate. This seems to afford evidence that, in acid, the charges are due to hydrogen ions, and not to mercurous ions as had been assumed by several investigators. Results obtained in other electrolytes are also given. Some remits for drop charges, measured by a <b>ballistic</b> <b>galvanometer</b> method, are included for comparison. The method is less accurate but confirms the original results. A description is given of similar experiments with amalgam drops. Silver amalgam is similar in behaviour to pure mercury, but Cadmium and Zinc amalgams show a curious phenomenon. The drops are naturally positive, but their charge may be reversed in sign by application of a 'sufficiently strong field. A possible explanation of this, effect is discussed. Some attention is given to the fact { that Zinc and Cadmium appear naturally positive. Several results showing charges in various potential gradients, and. for amalgams of various compositions, are included. A few final pages are devoted to similar experiments using air bubbles and the possibilities of the method for cataphoresis experiments...|$|E
40|$|When {{water drops}} are cooled to - 1 C, {{nucleated}} with tiny ice crystals and then allowed to freeze at - 15 C, a thin shell of ice is formed. Further freezing {{of the water}} causes internal stresses {{to be set up}} and the water escapes through the shell to form spicules. If the pressure becomes too great then some of the ice shell or of the spicule may be ejected, and the residue is found to have a charge of the order of 10 (^- 3) e. s. u. A diffusion chamber was designed and constructed. The base was cooled directly being an aluminium heat sink surrounded by solid carbon dioxide. The steady temperature gradient thus set up was measured with horizontal thermo-couples. A 1 mm diameter water drop was suspended in the centre of the chamber {{on the end of a}} fine insulating fibre which could be easily raised and lowered. The charge on the drop was measured by raising it into the centre of a Faraday cage which was connected to a sensitive <b>ballistic</b> <b>galvanometer</b> through a Vibrating Reed Electrometer (V. R. E.). The limit of sensitivity was 0. 05 x 10 (^- 3) e. s. u. It was found that the sign of the charge on the residue was dependant upon the type of break which had occurred. When more water than ice was given off then the residue had a predominantly negative charge. When no break occurred, no charge was detected. Of the 633 drops studied, 118 broke in some way. The average charge on the residue was + 0. 34 x 10 (^- 3) e. s. u. and ranged from - 17. 10 to + 25. 30 x 10 (^- 3) e. s. u. It was found impossible to account for either the magnitude or the sign of the charge in terms of the Latham and Mason temperature gradient theory but both could be accounted for if the Workman and Reynolds effect was invoked. It is suggested that in a thundercloud the effect of the turbulence present is to increase the number of breaks which occur while the spicule is still partially liquid, thereby increasing the number of negative residues and giving the cloud the correct polarity, when minute water drops freeze on graupel and break...|$|E
