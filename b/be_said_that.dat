5|$|Chrysippus {{regarded}} bodies, surfaces, lines, places, {{the void}} and time as all being infinitely divisible. He determined {{one of the}} principal features of the infinite set: since a man and a finger have an infinite number of parts as do the universe and a man, it cannot <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> a man has more parts than his finger, nor that the universe has more parts than a man.|$|E
5|$|Overall, {{it could}} <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> women had made marked social {{progress}} since the Bolshevik Revolution {{and by the}} Brezhnev era, comprised {{a considerable number of}} sole breadwinners in the country.

5|$|Even {{though the}} GRC scheme is {{intended}} to ensure minority representation in Parliament, it can <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> the scheme emphasizes racial consciousness and hence widens the gap between races. It may undermine the esteem of minority candidates as {{they would not be}} sure if they are elected on their own merit, or due to the scheme and the merits {{of the rest of the}} team of MPs. This would result in minority candidates resenting that they are dependent on the majority to enter Parliament, and the majority candidates believing that minority candidates have insufficient ability. It has also been claimed that the GRC scheme demeans the majority of Singaporeans as it assumes that they are not able to see the value or merit of minority candidates, and only vote for candidates with whom they share a common race, culture and language.|$|E

5|$|Gaudí's {{position}} {{in the history of}} architecture is that of a creative genius who, inspired by nature, developed a style of his own that attained technical perfection as well as aesthetic value, and bore the mark of his character. Gaudí's structural innovations were to an extent the result of his journey through various styles, from Doric to Baroque via Gothic, his main inspiration. It could <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> these styles culminated in his work, which reinterpreted and perfected them. Gaudí passed through the historicism and eclecticism of his generation without connecting with other architectural movements of the 20th century that, with their rationalist postulates, derived from the Bauhaus school, and represented an antithetical evolution to that initiated by Gaudí, given that it later reflected the disdain and the initial lack of comprehension of the work of the modernista architect.|$|E
5|$|The Jardin des Mont du Récollets {{provides}} expansive views {{over the}} plains of Flanders and beyond; {{on a clear day}} it is possible to see the North Sea, the English coast and the belfry of Bruges. It used to <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> from Cassel one could see five kingdoms: France, Belgium, Holland, England and Heaven. The garden also hosts an equestrian statue of Marshal Foch and the Monument des Trois Batailles, commemorating the battles of 1071, 1328 and 1677. Just below the gardens is the Porte du Château of 1621, the last substantial part of the old castle to remain standing. The city walls no longer stand but footpaths and streets still trace their former course.|$|E
5|$|There {{were five}} of them, a {{somewhat}} exceptional number: William P. Halliday, Samuel B. Halliday, Edwin W. Halliday, Henry L. Halliday, and Thomas W. Halliday. Of them all, I may {{be permitted to}} say that while they all differed from each other, they all exhibited features of character and conduct {{that would have given}} them prominence anywhere in the business world. No doubt in some one or two important respects, each one excelled the others. This was shown in those matters and things to which they gave their chief attention. Speaking of them and their families, so well represented here with us and elsewhere, it can <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> they have always stood for better things, not with assumption or pharisaically, but openly and firmly. They pushed their business enterprises with diligence, and had there been more of such men {{it would have been better}} for the city and for them also, I have no doubt.|$|E

25|$|Folk {{beliefs that}} cats can cause strange {{phenomena}} {{are not limited}} to Japan. For example, in Jinhua, Zhejiang, in China, it <b>is</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> a cat, after having been raised for three years by humans, would then start bewitching them. Because it <b>is</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> cats with white tails are especially good at this, there arose the custom of refraining from raising white cats. Since it <b>is</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> their ability to bewitch humans comes from taking in the spiritual energy of the moon, it <b>is</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> when a cat looks up at the moon, whether its tail has been cut or not, it should be killed on the spot.|$|R
