5|$|Egyptian forces {{attempted}} a surprise {{attack on the}} crusaders' camp on 9 October, but John discovered their movements. He and his retinue attacked and annihilated the Egyptian advance guard, hindering the main force. The crusaders built a floating fortress on the Nile near Damietta, but a storm <b>blew</b> <b>it</b> near the Egyptian camp. The Egyptians seized the fortress, killing nearly all of its defenders. Only two soldiers survived the attack; they were accused of cowardice, and John ordered their execution. Taking advantage of the new Italian troops, Cardinal Pelagius began to intervene in strategic decisions. His debates with John angered their troops. The soldiers broke into the Egyptian camp on 29 August 1219 without an order, but they were soon defeated and nearly annihilated. During the ensuing panic, only the cooperation of John, the Templars, the Hospitallers and the noble crusaders prevented the Egyptians from destroying their camp.|$|E

500|$|Many {{people within}} Major League Baseball spoke out {{in support of}} Joyce, {{offering}} their sympathies and noting his exceptional reputation.

It's a shame for both of them, for the pitcher and for the umpire. But I'm telling you he is the best baseball has, and a great guy. It's just a shame." [...] Former Chicago Cubs pitcher Milt Pappas said, [...] "I would tell , 'I feel for you. There have been only 20 perfect games in the history of baseball. The umpire situation was the same one I had—they <b>blew</b> <b>it.</b> At least I had the satisfaction of getting the no-hitter. You don't. I feel for you. You pitched a tremendous game. At least you have the satisfaction of the umpire saying he was sorry. But that doesn't help your situation as far as a perfect game." [...] Pappas' own bid for a perfect game on September 2, 1972, was spoiled when umpire Bruce Froemming called a borderline 3-and-2 pitch to 27th-batter Larry Stahl a ball, issuing a walk to the pinch-hitter. Former Yankees pitcher Don Larsen—who threw the fourth perfect game of the modern era and the only one in World Series history on October 8, 1956—said, [...] "I feel sorry for the umpire, and I just feel real badly for the kid.

500|$|Padres {{general manager}} Kevin Towers said Hoffman {{was the first}} one in and the last one out of the {{ballpark}} everyday. Hoffman adhered to a daily conditioning program. When pitcher Jeremy Fikac was promoted to the majors in 2001, Hoffman invited him to join him on his usual afternoon run. [...] "I remember sitting in the bullpen that night, and my legs were still trembling from the run", Fikac recalled. [...] "I'd run before, but not at that pace ... I was thinking, I hope they don't call on me because I can't feel my legs under me ... His work ethic is unbelievable." [...] Bochy said, [...] " [...] one of those guys like Tony Gwynn—they never feel like they've arrived. Tony never thought, 'Well, I'm hitting [...]360 ... ' He was never content. And Trevor's the same way. They just keep working and make sure that they've got goals they want to reach." [...] After every save opportunity, whether he converted it or <b>blew</b> <b>it,</b> Hoffman would sit in the dugout for up to five minutes after his teammates had cleared out. Whether it was the euphoria from success or the sting of failure, he would sit there and drain all the emotion out of himself, put the game behind him, and move on. Tracy Hoffman said, [...] "He's all about order. That's the foundation to what he does. You see it when he's on the field. He's always the same, win or lose. He doesn't smile, doesn't show any emotion." [...] Padres manager Bud Black marveled at Hoffman's regimen. [...] "The daily preparation for his job, that focus and dedication each day to prepare for the ninth inning ... It was incredible to see live", said Black. [...] "I played with George Brett, a Hall of Famer who was a great worker. But Trevor took it to a level and a commitment and Hall of Fame caliber." [...] After Hoffman resurrected his final season and recorded his 600th save, Macha said Hoffman's [...] "work ethic and perseverance paid off ... He had to grind it out to get there." ...|$|E
