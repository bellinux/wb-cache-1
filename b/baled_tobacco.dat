6000|$|In those halcyon days of {{the free}} trade, the fixed price for {{carrying}} a box of tea or <b>bale</b> of <b>tobacco</b> from the coast of Galloway to Edinburgh was fifteen shillings, and a man with two horses carried four such packages. The trade was entirely destroyed by Mr. Pitt's celebrated commutation law, which, by reducing the duties upon excisable articles, enabled the lawful dealer {{to compete with the}} smuggler. The statute was called in Galloway and Dumfries-shire, by those who had thriven upon the contraband trade, 'the burning and starving act.' ...|$|R
60|$|As fast as {{he could}} carry the kegs up the banks she slipped slings round them, two at a time, hooked them to a milkmaid's yoke, and went off with them to a shed which served as a stable and {{cowhouse}} in the winter. Against this was a rick of hay. Putting the kegs down she returned for more, and by the time that they were all in the stable her husband had finished his share of the work and had carried the heavy <b>bales</b> of <b>tobacco</b> to the shed. The three horses were already there.|$|R
60|$|A rare {{place was}} {{this in the}} old {{smuggling}} days, and indeed until quite lately the trade was carried on, though upon a reduced scale. Vessels drifting slowly up the river would show a light as they passed a barge at anchor or a bawley hanging to its trawl, a light would be shown in answer, {{and a moment later}} a boat would row off to the ship, and a score of tubs or a dozen <b>bales</b> of <b>tobacco</b> be quickly transferred, and before morning the contents would be stowed in underground cellars in some of the little farmhouses on the creeks, or be hidden away in the Leigh marshes.|$|R
50|$|In January 1945 she was requisitioned by the Admiralty and {{commissioned}} as HMS Cicero, {{under which}} name she served out {{the remainder of}} the war, although it would appear that she remained named as Empire Arquebus. In 1945, Empire Arquebus was used to transport troops from Sydney and Brisbane via New Ireland, New Britain and Manus to Ponam. During this journey, the ship was infested by flying beetles which had got aboard in <b>bales</b> of <b>tobacco.</b> The ship arrived at Ponam on 25 March 1945. Surplus to requirements after the war's end, she was returned to the Ministry of War Transport in September 1945, which returned her to Donaldson Bros & Black under her original name of Empire Arquebus.|$|R
2500|$|Griffiths was {{succeeded in}} May 1802 by Commander Joseph Masefield, who {{operated}} out of Portland. On 13 June Masefield sailed Atalante on an anti-smuggling patrol. On 1 October he sent in to Portsmouth a large smuggling vessel with 360 casks of spirits and 20 <b>bales</b> of <b>tobacco.</b> Then {{the next week}} he sent in a lugger with 170 [...] of spirits, a sloop with 120, and a large boat with 400. On 14 October he brought into Plymouth the 80-ton Admiral Pole, of Exeter, which Atalante caught after a long chase. She too had been carrying 170 ankers of spirits. Admiral Pole had been captured some months earlier at Weymouth and then released after posting bond with the Board of Customs and Excise.|$|R

50|$|The {{crash was}} the first fire {{incident}} on the 747 Combi and one of few fires on widebody aircraft. Fred Bereswill, the investigator from Boeing, characterised the Flight 295 fire as significant for this reason. Barry Strauch of the NTSB visited Boeing's headquarters to inquire about the Combi's design. Boeing's fire test in the Combi models did not accurately match {{the conditions of the}} Helderberg's cargo hold; in accordance with federal US rules, the Boeing test involved setting a <b>bale</b> of <b>tobacco</b> leaves ablaze. The fire stayed within the cargo hold. The air in the passenger cabin was designed to have a marginally higher pressure than cargo area hold, so if a crew member {{opened the door to the}} cargo hold, the air from the passenger cabin would flow into the cargo hold, stopping any smoke or gases from exiting through the door.|$|R
50|$|In 1818, the Grand Duke of Tuscany, Ferdinand III, {{founded a}} tobacco factory which {{manufactured}} Toscano cigars. A <b>bale</b> of Kentucky <b>tobacco</b> leaves {{which had been}} drying in the open were caught in an unexpected downpour of rain. The wet tobacco started to ferment in the summer heat. Instead of throwing all away, {{it was decided that}} the fermented tobacco be used to produce cigars to be sold in Florence. It gained popularity amongst Italians, thereafter it became a regular production. Today, the Toscano brand cigars are manufactured by Manifatture Sigaro Toscano SpA located in Lucca and Cava de' Tirreni.|$|R

50|$|At Weybourne {{the coast}} has an unusually steep shingle beach which was {{regarded}} as vulnerable {{to the threat of}} the Spanish Armada in 1588. The village was also a well-used location for smuggling items such as over-proof gin and pressed <b>bales</b> of <b>tobacco.</b> The coast between Sheringham and Weybourne was popular for landing goods because ships could anchor closer to the shore {{than anywhere else in the}} area. There was also a convenient gap in the cliffs through which goods could be easily transported. Local folklore says that the miller at the local windmill would stop the mill's sails in the form of a cross to warn the smugglers that the customs or coastguards were on to them; when the coast was clear he would set the sails going once more. On Weybourne beach there was so little cover for the waiting land party that the men were reputed to bury themselves neck-deep in the shingle until the smuggling vessel appeared on the horizon. This story perhaps stretches credulity, but the fact that it is also told of Suffolk locations adds at least a little weight. In the 1800s, William J. Bolding, the owner of Weybourne water mill and much of the inland areas at Weybourne, reputedly turned a blind eye to goods landed on the beaches bordering his property, and was rewarded with contraband left discreetly on his doorstep. In February 1837, a Lieutenant George Howes and his men from Weybourne intercepted a large gang of armed smugglers at nearby Kelling. Many shots were exchanged and the coastguards recovered five horses with carts carrying 540 gallons of brandy and around 4,000 pounds of manufactured tobacco.|$|R
40|$|Contract {{farming is}} {{emerging}} as an important governance structure in certain agricultural value chains. This study {{was done with the}} objectives of understanding the contractual relations between buyers and small-scale growers in the tobacco industry in Malawi and the impact of contract farming on smallholder incomes. Cross-sectional data was collected from 211 contract and 109 non-contract smallholder burley tobacco farmers who sold tobacco in the 2012 / 13 season. Two analyses were undertaken. First, the study analyzed the contractual arrangement and the performance factors under contract using analytical methods from transaction costs economics. Commercial banks, through the tobacco buyer, provide farmers with input loans, which farmers use to obtain fertilizer, seed, and extension services, all of which are important to increase tobacco productivity. The results of the contract analysis indicated that side-selling, information asymmetry, moral hazard, and strategic contract default by farmers were some of the transactions costs that affect the success of contract farming. However, the contractual arrangement also contributed to reduced transfer costs and reduced the rejection rate for the tobacco produced by the contract farmers. Moreover, to the buying company, contract farming contributes to reduced monitoring costs, as farmers work in groups and monitor each other’s activities, such as <b>baling</b> of the <b>tobacco</b> leaf, which ensures better quality tobacco being offered under contract. Secondly, for the impact evaluation of contract tobacco farming, a treatment effect model was used. The study analyzed the factors that affect farmers’ participation in contract farming and the effect of that participation on net tobacco income. Landholding size, access to extension services, distance to the auction floor, and the gender of the tobacco farmer were found to strongly affect the participation decision. Differences in income between contract and non-contract farmers were found to be strongly influenced by landholding size and monitoring of sales at the auction. Contract participation increases tobacco income by 46. 6 percent. This finding justifies making efforts to contractually link more smallholder farmers to tobacco companies. Therefore, a policy needs to be in place to facilitate such contracts between small-scale farmers and companies that buy tobacco leaf in Malawi.
