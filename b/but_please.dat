500|$|In {{its product}} manual, the NAIT {{is said to}} have [...] "low {{continuous}} power output ... balanced by a very large peak current capacity so there are no restrictions on the size or type of loudspeaker that may be used. <b>But</b> <b>please</b> don't expect the impossible". Hi-Fi Journal wrote that [...] "the NAIT excelled in musical terms... and would comfortably drive loudspeakers that caused other amplifiers to sound lumpen and distinctly unmusical". And for that reason, many people who owned the Quad Electrostatic Loudspeaker (ESL) [...] which are known to be a very difficult load for amplifiers [...] would choose the NAIT to drive their speakers. Reviewers attribute the perception of power of the NAITs to the over-engineered, dedicated power supplies that ensure generous current delivery for musical transients.|$|E
500|$|A {{fundamental}} {{characteristic of the}} aesthete is immediacy. In Either/Or, there are several levels of immediacy explored, ranging from unrefined to refined. Unrefined immediacy is characterized by immediate cravings for desire and satisfaction through enjoyments {{that do not require}} effort or personal cultivation (e.g. alcohol, drugs, casual sex, sloth, etc.) Refined immediacy is characterized by planning how best to enjoy life aesthetically. The [...] "theory" [...] of social prudence given in Crop Rotation is an example of refined immediacy. Instead of mindless hedonistic tendencies, enjoyments are contemplated and [...] "cultivated" [...] for maximum pleasure. However, both the refined and unrefined aesthetes still accept the fundamental given conditions of their life, and do not accept the responsibility to change it. If things go wrong, the aesthete simply blames existence, rather than one's self, assuming some unavoidable tragic consequence of human existence and thus claims life is meaningless. Kierkegaard spoke of immediacy this way in his sequel to Either/Or, Stages on Life's Way, [...] "The esthetic sphere is the sphere of immediacy, the ethical the sphere of requirement (and this requirement is so infinite that the individual always goes bankrupt), the religious the sphere of fulfillment, <b>but,</b> <b>please</b> note, not a fulfillment such as when one fills an alms box or a sack with gold, for repentance has specifically created a boundless space, and as a consequence the religious contradiction: simultaneously to be out on 70,000 fathoms of water and yet be joyful. Just as the ethical sphere is a passageway-which one nevertheless does not pass through once and for all-just as repentance is its expression, so repentance is the most dialectical. No wonder, then, that one fears it, for if one gives it a finger it takes the whole hand. Just as Jehovah in the Old Testament visits the iniquities of the fathers upon the children unto the latest generations, so repentance goes backward, continually presupposing the object of its investigation. In repentance there is the impulse of the motion, and therefore everything is reversed. This impulse signifies precisely the difference between the esthetic and the religious as the difference between the external and the internal." [...] Søren Kierkegaard, Stages on Life's Way, Hong translation, p. 476-477 ...|$|E

Amidst fierce fighting in Butig on November 30, 2016, Duterte, in a command briefing in Lanao del Sur, warned the Maute group: [...] "Ayaw ko makipag-away sa inyo. Ayaw ko makipag-patayan, (I {{do not want a}} fight with you. I don't want us killing each other) <b>but</b> <b>please,</b> do not force my hand.

[...] On December 2, 2016, as the military regained control of Butig, the retreating Maute fighters reportedly left a note threatening to behead Duterte.|$|E

[...] She replied: [...] "Let us not speak of it now, you have earned your success, which is more worthy than {{to have been born}} to it."

2500|$|Bart Simpson's Escape from Camp Deadly has {{received}} mixed to negative reviews. Nintendo Power {{gave it a}} 3.4/5 rating in 1991. UGO Networks gave the game a negative review, commenting that [...] "this uninspired train wreck of a Game Boy title fails on nearly every level, {{but most of all}} simply because it's a snore-fest. It's your basic side-scrolling platformer with little to no connection to the source material and lasts only about few hours at best. During the game you come across bullies, camp counselors and even a few wild animals, battling them with spitballs, a boomerang and, in the lunchroom level, food. This one is for completists only." [...] Matt Williamson of the Rocky Mountain News gave the game a C+ grade and commented that [...] "Escape from Camp Deadly tries too hard to be a Nintendo game. It's hard, I know, to try to make game graphics more primitive, <b>but</b> <b>please,</b> guys, the more complex you make the graphics, the more confusing a game gets!" [...] However, the Channel 4 video game programme GamesMaster gave the game an 89% rating.|$|E
2500|$|Fellow crime writer Anthony Berkeley Cox, writing {{under the}} nom de plume of Francis Iles, {{reviewed}} the novel in the 6 December 1957 issue of The Guardian, {{in which he}} confessed to being disappointed with the work: [...] "I have only pity for those poor souls who cannot enjoy the sprightly stories of Agatha Christie; but though sprightliness is {{not the least of}} this remarkable writer's qualities, there is another that we look for in her, and that is detection: genuine, steady, logical detection, taking us step by step nearer {{to the heart of the}} mystery. Unfortunately it is that quality that is missing in 4.50 from Paddington. The police never seem to find out a single thing, and even Miss Marples (sic) lies low and says nuffin' to the point until the final dramatic exposure. There is the usual small gallery of interesting and perfectly credible characters and nothing could be easier to read. <b>But</b> <b>please,</b> Mrs Christie, a little more of that incomparable detection next time." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{implications}} of the scandal also involved several Wikipedia entries, particularly those on Romanian Wikipedia. In June 2007, Vladimir Tismăneanu stated: [...] "I did not make efforts {{to respond to the}} wave of calumnies (which have infested the two Wikipedia articles about me in both English and Romanian) because I followed the precept 'You do not dignify them with an answer'." [...] During a 2008 colloquy on [...] "The Campaign against the Intellectuals", organized by Revista 22 and attended by several journalists and civil society members, Horia-Roman Patapievici stated: [...] "How does one respond to the claim that one has no right condemn communism over being what one is? How come so many people are not indignant over this kind of argumentation? [...] page on Wikipedia was vandalized and has stayed that way. Viewers of the page are okay with the tendentious information there. You were outraged, for just cause, when a Jewish cemetery was vandalized, <b>but,</b> <b>please,</b> also express public outrage toward the vandalizing of Wikipedia pages on Vladimir Tismăneanu. [...] Why do those who supervise the Wikipedia franchise in Romania allow this grave disinformation of the public, by forcefully maintaining a vandalized page? The absence of such an indignation is the most significant contribution to our country's morally unbreathable air." ...|$|E

2500|$|Milošević {{denounced the}} {{declaration}} of independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina from Yugoslavia in 1992, and said that [...] "Bosnia and Herzegovina was illegally proclaimed as an independent state and recognized. That recognition was like when the Roman Emperor Caligula appointed his horse as a Senator: they recognized a state that never existed before. The Serbs there said, 'We want to stay within Yugoslavia. We don't want to be second-class citizens.' And then the conflicts were started by Muslims, no doubt. And the Serbs, in defending themselves, were always better fighters, no doubt. And they achieved results, no doubt. <b>But</b> <b>please,</b> we were insisting on peace. The international community gave premature recognition first of Slovenia and then of Croatia and supported the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina on a totally irregular basis." [...] A telephone conversation between Milošević and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzić in September 1991 talking about the prospects of war in Bosnia and Herzegovina was tapped by Yugoslav intelligence, which reported the transcript to Yugoslav prime minister Ante Marković, who released the transcript to the public to discredit Milošević. The transcript involved Milošević ordering Karadzic to [...] "Go to Uzelac , he'll tell you everything. If you have any problems, telephone me", and said [...] "As long as there is the army no one can touch us... Don't worry about Herzegovina. Momir [...] said to his men: 'Whoever is not ready to die in Bosnia, step forward five paces.' No one did so." [...] The conversation revealed that Milošević controlled the military strategy for the war in Bosnia and that Montenegro was under his control.|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{passengers}} of the bus approached Treviño Morales weeping and saying: [...] "Please, sir. I {{do not want to}} do this. I will give you all the money I have and my own house, <b>but</b> <b>please</b> let us go." [...] Treviño Morales stared at him firmly, took away his club and then said, [...] "Okay, stupid asshole. Leave," [...] and while the crying man was walking away, Treviño Morales swung his bat and hit him {{in the back of the}} head—and then struck him more than 20 times until his head was completely destroyed. He then turned around and said to the kidnapped victims: [...] "This is what you have to do. Have some balls (courage). Anyone who does not want to can tell me and I will beat the hell out of you." [...] All of the men started fighting. Several other Zeta members, who were still on a bus with other passengers, ordered the women whom they considered the most beautiful to descend the vehicle so they could rape them. Then they took away the children from their mothers, and shot the rest of the bus passengers. The women were taken to a warehouse where many other women were held captive. Inside a dark room, the women were reportedly raped and beaten, while one heard the screams of the women and of the children being put in acid. A driver of one of the buses was then asked to turn on the bus engine, and then ordered to move the bus to where the kidnapped victims were handcuffed and laid down on the dirt floor. [...] "Drive on top of them," [...] one of the killers told the bus driver, who stood there motionless. [...] "Drive on top of them or I will put you there too, asshole," [...] the killer repeated. As the driver rode over his passengers with the bus, he felt like the vehicle was passing over speed bumps, but the only difference was that the bus driver and {{the passengers}} could actually hear the cries of the people as they were being run over. The gunmen, once the driver was finished, shot him in the head and shot the rest on board. The bus was then set on fire by the Zetas. Treviño Morales then gathered all the Zetas and said, [...] "We have had enough fun for tonight. Bring the winners." [...] His men brought all of those who had passed the gladiator-like competitions, and they were gathered in front of Treviño Morales.|$|E
