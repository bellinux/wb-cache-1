25|$|The {{terrorist}} acts perpetrated against innocent civilians by {{individuals and groups}} under the guise to liberate Oromia were abominable crimes and should be condemned in the strongest possible terms. Whoever that commits such barbaric acts of terror {{in the name of}} liberation struggle should not be tolerated. The killing of innocent civilians and destroying their properties couldn't be justified <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>standard.</b> I am of the view that a democratic unity on the basis of justice and equality would be of much benefit to the people of Oromia.|$|E
25|$|The {{marriage}} between Clare and Henry was difficult. Henry was <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>standard</b> extremely successful, but his physical awkwardness, lack of humor, and newsman's discomfort with any conversation {{that was not}} strictly factual put him in awe of his beautiful wife's social poise, wit, and fertile imagination. Clare's years as managing editor of Vanity Fair left her with an avid interest in journalism (she suggested the idea of Life magazine to her husband before it was developed internally). Henry himself was generous in encouraging her to write for Life, {{but the question of}} how much coverage she should be accorded in Time, as she grew more famous, was always a careful balancing act for Henry since {{he did not want to}} be accused of nepotism.|$|E

50|$|The term formal {{standard}} refers specifically to a specification {{that has been}} approved by a standards setting organization. The term de jure standard refers to a standard mandated by legal requirements or refers generally to <b>any</b> formal <b>standard.</b> In contrast, the term de facto standard refers to a specification (or protocol or technology) that has achieved widespread use and acceptance - often without being approved <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>standards</b> organization (or receiving such approval only after it already has achieved widespread use). Examples of de facto standards that were not approved <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>standards</b> organizations (or at least not approved until after they were in widespread de facto use) include the Hayes command set developed by Hayes, Apple's TrueType font design and the PCL protocol used by Hewlett-Packard in the computer printers they produced.|$|R

As producer of the Lincoln Center original, he is credited for Masterpiece Theater's televised version of Enemies.|$|E
25|$|Abdur Rouf Choudhury's novel Natun Diganta (three volumes: {{published}} in 1991, 1992, 1993 and complete collection in 2005 by Pathak Shamabesh) is a quality {{work of art}} <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>standard</b> and most successful writing on pre- Bangladesh Liberation War. Choudhury most vividly depicted the unity of Bengal and the articulation of Bengali nationalism in his novel Natun Diganta (New Horizon) (vols. 1-3). Reason and humanity – these are its two eternal pillars. The essence of Choudhury's thought is a complete faith in the efficiency of these two immeasurable forces. Its most striking characteristic is its insistent association of work, precept and practice. It appeals not to controversial tests, not to any appearance of sweet reasonableness but to trials in the rough and tumble of life, and it will accept no other judgment. Natun Diganta gives warning against: 1) dogma, mysticism, ceremonial, hypnotism, the binding {{of the mind and}} will by oaths, and other inventions of external authority in religion and politics, 2) participation in violence, individual or social, and organisation's dependence on violence, 3) exploitation, luxury and material property, 4) self-degradation and 5) devotion to self-sacrifice.|$|E

While she continued her education, she briefly served as a teacher in the Macon County, Alabama segregated school system, where she taught 3rd and 4th grade in 1935 and 1936. She once stated, [...] "The rural black school in the segregated post-depression era was deprived <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>standard.</b> There were never enough books and the teacher had to provide her own chalk, paper, pencils...". She subsequently obtained a master's of arts degree in history from Ohio State University in 1937. It was a time when women of African American ancestry were unlikely to continue higher education and pursue degrees. After graduating from Ohio State, Brown and a group of Ohio State University students traveled to Haiti to pursue academic knowledge about Caribbean history and literature. She later wrote, [...] "That trip was my first sally forth to see the world".|$|E

2500|$|The 1987 {{championship}} {{threw up}} some interesting surprises. [...] Galway put down an early signal of intent by claiming the National League title at Clare's expense.

Though outclassed by Japanese fighter aircraft, it performed well in strafing and bombing runs, often proving deadly in ground attacks on Japanese forces trying to retake Henderson Field. Guns salvaged from P-39s were sometimes fitted to Navy PT boats to increase firepower.
