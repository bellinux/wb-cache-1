2500|$|In a 2012 study, Koch et al. {{focused on}} whether Laser-assisted <b>BioPrinting</b> (LaBP) {{can be used}} to build {{multicellular}} 3D patterns in natural matrix, and whether the generated constructs are functioning and forming tissue. LaBP arranges small volumes of living cell suspensions in set high-resolution patterns. The investigation was successful, the researchers foresee that [...] "generated tissue constructs might be used for in vivo testing by implanting them into animal models" [...] (14). As of this study, only human skin tissue has been synthesized, though researchers project that [...] "by integrating further cell types (e.g. melanocytes, Schwann cells, hair follicle cells) into the printed cell construct, the behavior of these cells in a 3D in vitro microenvironment similar to their natural one can be analyzed", useful for drug discovery and toxicology studies.|$|E

They believe that humans can and should use these technologies to become more than human. [...] Therefore, they support the recognition and/or protection of cognitive liberty, morphological freedom and procreative liberty as civil liberties, {{so as to guarantee}} individuals the choice of using human enhancement technologies on themselves and their children. Some speculate that human enhancement techniques and other emerging technologies may facilitate more radical human enhancement no later than at the midpoint of the 21st century. Kurzweil's book The Singularity is Near and Michio Kaku's book Physics of the Future outline various human enhancement technologies and give insight on how these technologies may impact the human race.|$|E
30|$|Appropriate cell {{types and}} {{suitable}} biomaterials {{are the two}} major requirements to produce clinically viable <b>bioprinted</b> skin tissue. A shortcoming of most tissue engineered skin constructs is that they rely upon molecular diffusion and mechanical perfusion for nutrient supply. Since diffusion is generally limited to 100 – 200  μm, cell viability in the construct will be compromised (Tran and Wen 2014). Presence of a highly developed vasculature in the <b>bioprinted</b> construct can provide nutrients at {{the vicinity of the}} cells. In this scenario, development of vascularized cell-laden <b>bioprinted</b> skin substitutes would have great benefit in repairing skin defects (Bertassoni et al. 2014).|$|R

5000|$|... 3D <b>bioprinting</b> is {{the process}} of {{creating}} cell patterns in a confined space using 3D printing technologies, where cell function and viability are preserved within the printed construct. Generally, 3D <b>bioprinting</b> utilizes the layer-by-layer method to deposit materials known as Bioinks to create tissue-like structures that are later used in medical and tissue engineering fields. <b>Bioprinting</b> covers a broad range of materials. Currently, <b>bioprinting</b> can be used to print tissues and organs to help research drugs and pills. In addition, 3D <b>bioprinting</b> has begun to incorporate the printing of scaffolds. These scaffolds can be used to regenerate joints and ligaments. The first patent related to this technology was filed in the United States in 2003 and granted in 2006.|$|E
40|$|Compared to {{standard}} 2 D culture systems, new methods for 3 D cell culture of adipocytes could provide more physiologically accurate data and {{a deeper understanding}} of metabolic diseases such as diabetes. By resuspending living cells in a bioink of nanocellulose and hyaluronic acid, we were able to print 3 D scaffolds with uniform cell distribution. After one week in culture, cell viability was 95 %, and after two weeks the cells displayed a more mature phenotype with larger lipid droplets than standard 2 D cultured cells. Unlike cells in 2 D culture, the 3 D <b>bioprinted</b> cells did not detach upon lipid accumulation. After two weeks, the gene expression of the adipogenic marker genes PPAR. and FABP 4 was increased 2. 0 - and 2. 2 -fold, respectively, for cells in 3 D <b>bioprinted</b> constructs compared with 2 D cultured cells.

Incorporation of growth factors into <b>bioprinted</b> scaffolds offers many new possibilities regarding both biological and architectural properties of the scaffolds. This study investigates whether the sustained release of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP- 2) influences osteogenicity of tissue engineered <b>bioprinted</b> constructs. BMP- 2 loaded on gelatin microparticles (GMPs) {{was used as a}} sustained release system, which was dispersed in hydrogel-based constructs and compared to direct inclusion of BMP- 2 in alginate or control GMPs. The constructs were supplemented with goat multipotent stromal cells (gMSCs) and biphasic calcium phosphate to study osteogenic differentiation and bone formation respectively. BMP- 2 release kinetics and bioactivity showed continuous release for three weeks coinciding with osteogenicity. Osteogenic differentiation and bone formation of <b>bioprinted</b> GMP containing constructs were investigated after subcutaneous implantation in mice or rats.

30|$|Cell microenvironment, both at pre-printing and post-printing stages have {{crucial role}} in the {{ultimate}} success of the <b>bioprinted</b> skin construct. Various physicochemical elements play important role in the generation and maintenance of a suitable microenvironment in <b>bioprinted</b> construct. The importance of microenvironmental factors was recognized by previous studies and dynamic culture was used for mimicking the natural niche in native skin to produce structures like sweat glands (Huang et al. 2016). To achieve specific cell differentiation, they incorporated mouse plantar dermis and epidermal growth factor into gelatin and sodium alginate based 3 D-ECM. Using recent advancements in microfluidics, various gradients of biomolecular cues can also be incorporated during printing.|$|R

The company utilizes its NovoGen MMX Bioprinter for 3D <b>bioprinting.</b> The printer is optimized {{to be able to}} print skin tissue, heart tissue, and blood vessels among other basic tissues that could be suitable for surgical therapy and transplantation. Similarly, a research team at Swansea University in the UK is using <b>bioprinting</b> technology to produce soft tissues and artificial bones for eventual use in reconstructive surgery. <b>Bioprinting</b> technology will eventually be used to create fully functional human organs for transplants and drug research, which will allow for more effective organ transplants and safer more effective drugs.|$|E
40|$|Here, we {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} osteogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) in three-dimensional (3 D) <b>bioprinted</b> tissue constructs in vitro and in vivo. A 3 D Bio-plotter dispensing system {{was used for}} building 3 D constructs. Cell viability was determined using live/dead cell staining. After 7 and 14 days of culture, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to analyze the expression of osteogenesis-related genes (RUNX 2, OSX, and OCN). Western blotting for RUNX 2 and immunofluorescent staining for OCN and RUNX 2 were also performed. At 8 weeks after surgery, osteoids secreted by osteogenically differentiated cells were assessed by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining, Masson trichrome staining, and OCN immunohistochemical staining. Results from live/dead cell staining showed {{that most of the}} cells remained alive, with a cell viability of 89 %, on day 1 after printing. In vitro osteogenic induction of the 3 D construct showed that the expression levels of RUNX 2, OSX, and OCN were significantly increased on days 7 and 14 after printing in cells cultured in osteogenic medium (OM) compared with that in normal proliferation medium (PM). Fluorescence microscopy and western blotting showed that the expression of osteogenesis-related proteins was significantly higher in cells cultured in OM than in cells cultured in PM. In vivo studies demonstrated obvious bone matrix formation in the 3 D <b>bioprinted</b> constructs. These results indicated that 3 D <b>bioprinted</b> constructs consisting of hASCs had the ability to promote mineralized matrix formation and that hASCs could be used in 3 D <b>bioprinted</b> constructs for the repair of large bone tissue defects...|$|R

5000|$|... 3D <b>bioprinting</b> for {{fabricating}} biological constructs typically involves dispensing cells onto a biocompatible scaffold using a successive layer-by-layer {{approach to}} generate tissue-like three-dimensional structures.* Artificial organs such as livers and kidneys made by 3D <b>bioprinting</b> {{have been shown}} to lack crucial elements that affect the body such as working blood vessels, tubules for collecting urine, and the growth of billions of cells required for these organs. Without these components the body has no way to get the essential nutrients and oxygen deep within their interiors. Given that every tissue in the body is naturally compartmentalized of different cell types, many technologies for printing these cells vary in their ability to ensure stability and viability of the cells during the manufacturing process. Some of the methods that are used for 3D <b>bioprinting</b> of cells are photolithography, magnetic <b>bioprinting,</b> stereolithography, and direct cell extrusion.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bioprinting</b> {{may be used}} to {{increase}} human performance, strength, speed, or endurance. For instance, <b>bioprinting</b> {{may be used to}} manufacture enhanced bones and replace regular human bones that are stronger and more flexible. The 3d printer could also be used {{to increase}} muscle performance by making muscles more “resilient and less likely to become fatigued”. Lung capacity could also be improved by replacing it with an artificial lung that can increase oxygen efficiency in the blood. Human enhancement would have a dangerous but incredible impact on society; <b>bioprinting</b> could create a culture without disease or imperfection.|$|E
40|$|Timely vascularization is {{essential}} for optimal performance of bone regenerative constructs. Vascularization is efficiently stimulated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a substance with a short half-life time. This study investigates the controlled release of VEGF from gelatin microparticles (GMPs) {{as a means to}} prolong VEGF activity at the preferred location within 3 D <b>bioprinted</b> scaffolds, and the effects on subsequent vascularization. The release of VEGF from GMPs was continuous for 3 weeks during in vitro studies, and bioactivity was confirmed using human endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in migration assays. Traditional and real-time migration assays showed immediate and efficient EPC migration in the presence of GMP-released VEGF, indistinguishable from VEGF-solution that was added to the medium. Matrigel scaffolds containing EPCs and VEGF, which was released either in a fast or sustained fashion by application of GMPs, were investigated for their in vivo vasculogenic capacity. Implantation in subcutaneous pockets in nude mice for one week demonstrated that vessel formation was significantly higher in the VEGF sustained-release group compared to the fast release group. In addition, regional differences with respect to VEGF release were introduced in 3 D <b>bioprinted</b> EPC-laden scaffolds and their influence on vasculogenesis was investigated in vivo. The different regions were retained and vessel formation occurred analogous with the results seen in the Matrigel plugs. We conclude that GMPs are suitable to generate sustained release profiles of bioactive VEGF, and that they can be used to create defined differentiation regions in 3 D <b>bioprinted</b> heterogeneous constructs, allowing a new generation of smart scaffold design. The prolonged presence of VEGF led to a significant increase in scaffold vascularization when applied in vivo...|$|R

5000|$|Magnetic 3D <b>bioprinting</b> {{can be used}} {{to screen}} for {{cardiovascular}} toxicity, which accounts for 30% of drug withdrawals [...] Vascular smooth muscle cells are magnetically printed into 3D rings to mimic blood vessels that can contract and dilate. This system could potentially replace experiments using ex vivo tissue, which are costly and yield few data per experiment. Furthermore, magnetic 3D <b>bioprinting</b> can use human cells to approximate a human in vivo response better than with an animal model. This has been demonstrated by the bioassay which combines the benefits of 3D <b>bioprinting</b> in building tissue-like structures for study with the speed of magnetic printing.|$|E

They {{should be able}} to maintain its three-dimensional structure for at least 3  weeks to allow ingrowths of blood vessels, fibroblast and for epithelial cell proliferation (Sekine et al. 2013). Biodegradation should preferably take place after this period (Augustine et al. 2015). Moreover, degradation products should not create a massive foreign body response. Understanding and controlling the biodegradation is an important aspect for maintaining 3 D architecture of any tissue engineering scaffold throughout the implantation period and subsequent integration with native host tissue (Augustine et al. 2016 c).|$|R

Organovo also partners with biopharmaceutical companies and academic medical centers to design, build, and validate more predictive in vitro tissues for disease modeling and toxicology. The living test tissues provide researchers the opportunity to test drugs before administering the drug to a living person; this bridges the gap between preclinical testing and clinical trials.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} bioglass (bioactive glass) on growth and mineralization of bone-related SaOS- 2 cells, encapsulated into a printable and biodegradable alginate/gelatine hydrogel. The hydrogel was supplemented either with polyphosphate (polyP), administered as polyP • Ca 2 +-complex, or silica, or as biosilica that had been enzymatically prepared from ortho-silicate by silicatein. These hydrogels, together with SaOS- 2 cells, were <b>bioprinted</b> to computer-designed scaffolds. The results revealed that bioglass (nano) particles, with a size of 55 nm and a molar ratio of SiO 2 : CaO : P 2 O 5 of 55 : 40 : 5, {{did not affect the}} growth of the encapsulated cells. If silica, biosilica, or polyP • Ca 2 +-complex is co-added to the cell-containing alginate/gelatin hydrogel the growth behavior of the cells is not changed. Addition of 5 mg/ml of bioglass particles to this hydrogel significantly enhanced the potency of the entrapped SaOS- 2 cells to mineralize. If compared with the extent of the cells to form mineral deposits in the absence of bioglass, the cells exposed to bioglass together with 100 µmoles/L polyP • Ca 2 +-complex increased their mineralization activity from 2. 1 - to 3. 9 -fold, or with 50 µmoles/L silica from 1. 8 - to 2. 9 -fold, or with 50 µmoles/L biosilica from 2. 7 - to 4. 8 -fold or with the two components together (100 µmoles/L polyP • Ca 2 +-complex and 50 µmoles/L biosilica) from 4. 1 - to 6. 8 -fold. Element analysis by EDX spectrometry of the mineral nodules formed by SaOS- 2 revealed an accumulation of O, P, Ca and C, indicating that the mineral deposits contain, besides Ca-phosphate also Ca-carbonate. The results show that bioglass added to alginate/gelatin hydrogel increases the proliferation and mineralization of <b>bioprinted</b> SaOS- 2 cells.
