5|$|In {{the first}} few decades {{following}} the journal's establishment, leading authors in The Accounting Review tended to write articles that would <b>be</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> to accounting practitioners. The journal published articles that focused on accounting education and issues related to particular industries and trade groups, with many articles using anecdotal evidence and hypothetical illustrations. The longest-serving editor during this period was Eric Kohler, an accounting practitioner; Kohler served as editor from 1928 to 1942.|$|E
5|$|In early 1922 Marquis started {{considering}} {{working as}} an Indian agency physician. This would both satisfy his longstanding interest in the Native Americans of the West, and provide a subject that might <b>be</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> to publishers. In May, Marquis applied to the Civil Service Commission. While waiting, he began work on a novel, Boute, an unfinished story based on his wartime experiences. In June, Marquis was appointed agency physician to the Northern Cheyenne. He arrived in the agency village of Lame Deer, Montana, in early July.|$|E
5|$|The Accounting Review was {{established}} in 1926. In its early decades, the journal tended to publish articles that would <b>be</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> to accounting practitioners, but over time it shifted towards a preference for quantitative model building and mathematical rigor. In the 1980s the AAA began to publish two other journals, Issues in Accounting Education and Accounting Horizons, that were more relevant to accounting educators and accounting practitioners respectively, to allow The Accounting Review to focus more heavily on quantitative articles.|$|E

5|$|The {{increasing}} demands {{placed on}} the Congolese population by the colonial authorities during the war, however, provoked strikes, riots {{and other forms of}} resistance, particularly from the indigenous Congolese. These were repressed, often violently, by the Belgian colonial authorities. The Congo's comparative prosperity during the conflict led to a wave of post-war immigration from Belgium, bringing the white population to 100,000 by 1950, as well as a period of industrialisation that continued throughout the 1950s. The role played by Congolese uranium during the hostilities caused the country to <b>be</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> to the Soviet Union during the Cold War.|$|E
5|$|Boston's British {{military}} leaders, General Thomas Gage and Admiral Samuel Graves, {{both had}} reason {{to do business with}} the people of Machias. Gage required lumber to build barracks for the additional troops arriving in the besieged city. Graves wanted to recover the guns from the HMS Halifax shipwreck, which been intentionally run aground in Machias Bay by a local pilot in February 1775. The ship's guns were reported to <b>be</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> to the Patriots of Machias. Graves authorized Ichabod Jones, a Tory Machias merchant, to take flour and other food supplies aboard his ships Unity and Polly to exchange for Gage's needed lumber. To guarantee that this trade would happen, Graves sent James Moore, a midshipman from his flagship HMS Preston, to command the armed schooner Margaretta and accompany the two merchant vessels. Moore had additional orders to retrieve what he could from the wreck site of the HMS Halifax.|$|E

25|$|In algebra, ring {{theory is}} the study of rings—algebraic {{structures}} in which addition and multiplication are defined and have similar properties to those operations defined for the integers.
