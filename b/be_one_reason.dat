He often carried a hip flask in case {{he ran out of}} something to drink. Vainio's deteriorating family relationships are considered to <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> for his drinking. Many of his friends were heavy drinkers as well but despite his drinking problem, he always managed to finish his lyrics on time.|$|E
5|$|Unlike many Banksia species, B.telmatiaea lacks a lignotuber, so {{plants are}} killed by bushfire. However, it is adapted to release its aerial seed bank {{following}} a bushfire, and so regenerates rapidly. This behaviour, known as serotiny, makes B.telmatiaea dependent upon a suitable fire regime for successful regeneration; indeed, excessive fire frequency may <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why B.telmatiaea does not occur further south, despite suitable habitat throughout southwest Australia. Unlike most serotinous Banksia species, the seeds of B.telmatiaea are not released immediately {{after the passage of}} a bushfire. The follicles open straight away, but at first the seeds are blocked from falling out by the winged seed separator. If moistened, these wings close up, and as they dry they open out again, levering the seeds out of position, making it possible for them to fall. This adaptation ensures that seeds are released only after the first rains following a bushfire.|$|E

25|$|This data {{somewhat}} {{undermines the}} traditional economic {{explanation of the}} concentration of female labor in agriculture. Regardless of the underlying reason for high female participation in agriculture, these workers earn a lower wage {{than their male counterparts}} both within this sector and relative to workers in other sectors.

25|$|Because of {{this most}} of the {{vineyards}} in Argentina are planted on ungrafted rootstock. There are many theories about why phylloxera has not yet reach {{this part of the}} world. The centuries-old tradition of flood irrigation where water is allowed to deeply saturate the soil may <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason,</b> as is the high proportion of sand present in the soil. The relative isolation of Argentina is also cited as a potential benefit against phylloxera with the country's wine regions being bordered by mountains, deserts and oceans that create natural barriers against the spread of the louse. Despite the minimal risk of phylloxera, some producers are switching to grafted rootstock that provide better yield control.|$|E
25|$|Both {{the harmful}} effects of {{radiation}} upon biological systems (induction of cancer and acute radiation injuries) and the useful effects of radiotherapy involve the radiation chemistry of water. The vast majority of biological molecules are present in an aqueous medium; when water is exposed to radiation, the water absorbs energy, and as a result forms chemically reactive species that can interact with dissolved substances (solutes). Water is ionized to form a solvated electron and H2O+, the H2O+ cation can react with water to form a hydrated proton (H3O+) and a hydroxyl radical (HO.). Furthermore, the solvated electron can recombine with the H2O+ cation to form an excited state of the water, this excited state then decomposes to species such as hydroxyl radicals (HO.), hydrogen atoms (H.) and oxygen atoms (O.). Finally, the solvated electron can react with solutes such as solvated protons or oxygen molecules to form respectively hydrogen atoms and dioxygen radical anions. The fact that oxygen changes the radiation chemistry might <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why oxygenated tissues are more sensitive to irradiation than the deoxygenated tissue at the centre of a tumor. The free radicals, such as the hydroxyl radical, chemically modify biomolecules such as DNA, leading to damage such as breaks in the DNA strands. Some substances can protect against radiation-induced damage by reacting with the reactive species generated by the irradiation of the water.|$|E

500|$|Though {{a skilled}} swordsman, Sparrow prefers {{to use his}} {{superior}} intelligence during combat, exploiting his environment to turn the tables on his foes, reasoning [...] "Why fight when you can negotiate?" [...] He uses strategies of non-violent negotiation and turning his enemies against each other. He invokes parleys and tempts his enemies away from their murderous intentions, encouraging them to see the bigger picture, as he does when he persuades Barbossa to delay returning to mortal form so he can battle the Royal Navy. He often uses complex wordplay and vocabulary to confound his enemies, and {{it is suggested that}} his pacifism may <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> Barbossa and the crew of the Black Pearl mutinied.|$|E
500|$|Another side of West Coast jazz {{that also}} came under {{critical}} fire was {{music in a}} lighter style, intended for popular consumption. Manne made contributions here too. Best known is the series of albums he recorded with pianist André Previn and with members of his groups, based on music from popular Broadway shows, movies, and television programs. (The first and most successful of these was the My Fair Lady album based on songs from the musical, recorded by Previn, Manne, and bassist Leroy Vinnegar in 1956.) The recordings for the Contemporary label, with each album devoted to a single musical, are in a light, immediately appealing style aimed at popular taste, which did not always go over well with aficionados of [...] "serious" [...] jazz, which may <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why Manne has been frequently overlooked in accounts of major jazz drummers of the 20th century. Much of the music produced on the West Coast in those years, as Robert Gordon concedes, was in fact imitative and [...] "lacked the fire and intensity associated with the best jazz performances". But Gordon {{also points out that}} there is a level of musical sophistication, as well as an intensity and [...] "swing", in the music recorded by Manne with Previn and Vinnegar (and later Red Mitchell) that is missing in the many lackluster albums of this type produced by others in that period.|$|E

2500|$|The {{similarity}} with Endgame may <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why Beckett did {{not attempt}} to develop the play further and why he published it at a much later date among the ‘odds’. “Several passages make one suspect … that Beckett may have sensed that the dangers of repetition or self-parody were too great to allow him to complete or release the play [...] earlier.” Many scholars suggest that the room in which Endgame is staged is a post-war fallout shelter and that the nothingness observed outside is a result of a nuclear winter; [...] a similar view can be just as easily taken of Rough for Theatre I.|$|E
2500|$|The supply-side economists (and others) {{have argued}} that raising International {{competitiveness}} through policies that promote traded goods sectors' productivity (at {{the expense of other}} sectors) will increase a nation's GDP, and increase its [...] standard of living, when compared with treating the sectors equally. The Balassa–Samuelson effect might <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> to oppose this trade theory, because it predicts that: a GDP gain in traded goods does not lead to as much of an improvement in the living standard as an equal GDP increase in the non-traded sector.

2500|$|After the 1595 record {{there is}} a {{complete}} gap until 1602, although the destruction of La Mothe is likely to <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> for this. Scholars have speculated that Bellange travelled either in this period or before 1595. The connection with Crispijn de Passe in Cologne (see below) may mean that he had visited that city. In eight of Bellange's prints, his signature describes him as [...] "eques" [...] or [...] "knight", but {{it seems clear that}} this title was not given by the Dukes of Lorraine. It is not impossible that he had acquired it at some other court during this period, and returned to Lorraine around 1602 with the prestige of an artist with international experience.|$|E
2500|$|In particular, the {{impaired}} {{processing of}} proIAPP that {{occurs at the}} N-terminal cleavage site is {{a key factor in}} the initiation of amyloid. Post-translational modification of proIAPP occurs at both the carboxy terminus and the amino terminus, however, the processing of the amino terminus occurs later in the secretory pathway. This might <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why it is more susceptible to impaired processing under conditions where secretion is in high demand. [...] Thus, the conditions of Type 2 diabetes—high glucose concentrations and increased secretory demand for insulin and IAPP—could lead to the impaired N-terminal processing of proIAPP. The unprocessed proIAPP can then serve as the granule upon which IAPP can accumulate and form amyloid.|$|E
2500|$|Cichlids share {{a single}} key trait: {{the fusion of}} the lower {{pharyngeal}} bones into a single tooth-bearing structure. A complex set of muscles allows {{the upper and lower}} pharyngeal bones {{to be used as a}} second set of jaws for processing food, allowing a division of labor between the [...] "true jaws" [...] (mandibles) and the [...] "pharyngeal jaws". Cichlids are efficient and often highly specialized feeders that capture and process a very wide variety of food items. This is assumed to <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why they are so diverse. Cichlids vary in body shape, ranging from compressed and disc-shaped (such as Symphysodon and Heros), to triangular (such as Pterophyllum and Uaru) to elongated and cylindrical (such as Crenicichla and Biotoecus).|$|E

[...] Mao's personal physician, Li Zhisui, later recorded that doctors responsible for Kang's treatment at Beijing Hospital told him that Kang was suffering from schizophrenia.

2500|$|In the US, up to 20% of {{infertile}} {{couples have}} unexplained infertility. In these cases abnormalities {{are likely to}} be present but not detected by current methods.
