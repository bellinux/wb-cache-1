50|$|Caterpillar is {{a serious}} {{defoliator}} of many plants across the world. Adult laid eggs near {{the tips of the}} terminal twigs. Newly emerged larvae fed on the tender leaves of the twigs. Six larval instars until pupa. Young larvae secrete silk threads from spinnerets and suspended themselves from twigs by them. This habit, and the discharge of a fluid from a saclike, eversible gland are the only known defense strategies. Pupation usually found within <b>bark</b> <b>cracks</b> and crevices. Older larvae and adult are nocturnal.|$|R
50|$|Quercus pubescens is a {{medium-sized}} deciduous tree growing up to 20 m. Forest-grown trees grow tall, while open-growing trees develop {{a very broad}} and irregular crown. They are long-lived, to several hundred years, and eventually grow into very stout trees with trunks up to 2 m in diameter. Open-grown trees frequently develop several trunks. The bark is very rough, light grey and divided into small flakes. Large trees develop very thick whitish <b>bark</b> <b>cracked</b> into deep furrows, similar to the Pedunculate oak but lighter in colour.|$|R

40|$|Stem {{injection}} of imidacloprid is an available component of management strategies for hemlock woolly adelgid. Preliminary observations of similar treatments of maple and ash {{show that the}} injury sustained by injection warrants investigation of the wound response in eastern hemlock. Such investigations need adequate experimental controls to identify the role of phytoxicity of the active ingredient and the carrier formulation, delivery pressure, seasonality, and tree condition. External indicators such as <b>bark</b> <b>cracks</b> tend to underestimate the amount of cambial dieback. Evaluation of the wound response requires tree dissection. We suggest that the unintended consequences of treatment such as injection injury be considered and incorporated into the management decision process...|$|R
50|$|Quercus marilandica {{is a small}} {{deciduous}} tree {{growing to}} 15 m tall, with <b>bark</b> <b>cracked</b> into rectangular black plates with narrow orange fissures. The leaves are 7 - 20 cm long and broad, and typically flare from a tapered base to a broad three-lobed bell shape with only shallow indentations. They are dark green and glossy above, pubescent underneath, and often remain attached to the twigs through the winter after turning colors from red to brown in the fall. The acorn is small, 12 - 20 mm long and 10 - 18 mm broad; like other red oaks, it takes 18 months to mature.|$|R

40|$|A {{disorder}} {{causing the}} <b>cracking</b> of <b>bark</b> {{in the lower}} trunk region of seedlings and in the root stock of bud-grafted trees of Hevea brasiliensis was observed recently. A preliminary investigation was carried {{out for the first}} time to study the occurrence, symptoms, its relationship to the genotype of clones or seedlings, age and growth of trees. The observations were that, this disorder appears only after about three years of establishment and reaches a high percentage in about seven years and is completely absent in bud wood nurseries. Bud-grafted trees with the disorder had a greater girth than those unaffected. The genotype of the scion in bud-grafted trees did not have a significant influence on the occurrence of this disorder. The nature and the symptoms of this disorder do not show the involvement of a pathogen of, but secondary infections may be the reason for <b>bark</b> decay around <b>cracks.</b> The information gathered so far points to an inherited physiological disorder that appears at maturity affecting both root stocks in bud-grafted trees and the lower trunk region in seedlings.

50|$|This {{plant is}} a low, rounded shrub with a gnarled trunk {{emerging}} from the sand and branching densely to form a mound up to two meters tall. The zig-zagging, angled, sharp-tipped branches are sometimes buried in sand and emerge covered in lichens. The gray <b>bark</b> <b>cracks,</b> revealing new reddish brown bark beneath. The alternately arranged leaves have smooth blades 1 to 3 centimeters long with wavy or toothed edges. Blooming occurs before the leaves appear. The flowers are usually solitary. They have five red sepals and five white petals a few millimeters long. There are many stamens at the center, each with a yellow anther. The species is andromonoecious, with individuals bearing both bisexual and male-only flowers. The fruit is a bitter-tasting, egg-shaped drupe up to 2.5 centimeters long. The drupe is reddish purple in color and is consumed by animals.|$|R

40|$|Aims: Oak {{decline is}} a complex phenomenon, {{characterized}} by symptoms of canopy transparency, <b>bark</b> <b>cracks</b> and root biomass reduction. Root health status {{is one of the}} first stress indicators, and root turnover is a key process in plant adaptation to unfavourable conditions. In this study, the combined effects of decline and thinning were evaluated on fine root dynamics in an oak forest adjoining the Italian Pre-Alps by comparison of acute declining trees with non-declining trees, both with and without thinning treatment of surrounding trees. Methods: Dynamics of volumetric root length density (RLDV) and tip density (RTDV), root tip density per unit length of root (RTDL), diameter, branching index (BI) and mycorrhizal colonization were monitored by soil coring over 2 years as possible descriptors of decline. Key Results: At the beginning of the experiment, the relationship between canopy transparency and root status was weak, declining trees having slightly lower RLDV (– 20...|$|R
5|$|Cracks are linear {{openings}} {{that form}} in materials to relieve stress. When an elastic material stretches or shrinks uniformly, it eventually reaches its breaking strength and then fails suddenly in all directions, creating cracks with 120 degree joints, so three cracks {{meet at a}} node. Conversely, when an inelastic material fails, straight cracks form to relieve the stress. Further stress {{in the same direction}} would then simply open the existing cracks; stress at right angles can create new cracks, at 90 degrees to the old ones. Thus the pattern of cracks indicates whether the material is elastic or not. In a tough fibrous material like oak tree <b>bark,</b> <b>cracks</b> form to relieve stress as usual, but they do not grow long as their growth is interrupted by bundles of strong elastic fibres. Since each species of tree has its own structure at the levels of cell and of molecules, each has its own pattern of splitting in its bark.|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- The {{amount of}} latex from rubber tree (Hevia Brasiliensis) {{depends on the}} quality of the bark surface in the cutting area. The major sign for a low quality surface is a <b>cracking</b> <b>bark</b> which can results in empty latex. This paper proposes a vision-based method for crack {{detection}} and classification of bark surfaces. First, candidate regions are detected using threshold-based boundary detection method. Then, the maximum area region each candidate region is computed by fractal dimension method finally, these features are used as the inputs to discriminate statistic to classify whether or not it is a <b>cracking</b> <b>bark.</b> Any surface with a <b>cracking</b> <b>bark</b> is considered as a bad surface. The experiments on 30 cracking surfaces and 30 normal surfaces were carried out. The results showed overall errors at 10 % of which 16. 7 % is the negative faults (i. e. bad surfaces are graded as good ones) and 3. 3 % is the positive faults (i. e. good surfaces are graded as bad ones) ...|$|R

30|$|As expected, {{ethephon}} treatment {{triggered a}} chain of events that manifested as <b>bark</b> <b>cracking</b> and necrosis, resinification, and chlorosis, and led to significantly different transcriptomes (Table 2) in all sampled tissues. Ethephon increased the transcription of genes associated with secondary metabolism, specifically of phenylpropanoids and flavonoids in xylem tissues (Table 2). Some of these secondary metabolites may be responsible for the red-fluorescent extractives that developed in ethephon-treated xylem after fixation with FAA (Figure 4 C). These extractives seem to be limited to the young outer xylem nearest to the mucilaginous xylem. This is consistent with the hypothesis that, in conifers, the ethylene signal is transported to the mucilaginous xylem which is subsequently reprogrammed to generate cells with altered physiology to produce metabolites that counter the stress factor identified by the signalling pathway (Hudgins and Franceschi [2004]). Resinification was more pronounced at the higher 5 and 25 mg ethephon dosages (data not shown); transcriptomic analyses were not attempted for these treatments due to inconsistent RNA extraction possibly due to the adverse effect of high resin content.|$|R

40|$|Acute Oak Decline (AOD) {{is a new}} {{condition}} affecting both species of native oak, Quercus robur and Quercus petraea, in Great Britain. The decline is characterised by a distinctive set of externally visible stem symptoms; <b>bark</b> <b>cracks</b> that “weep” dark exudate are found above necrotic lesions in the inner bark. Emergence holes of the buprestid beetle, Agrilus biguttatus are often also seen on the stems of oak within affected woodlands. This investigation assesses {{the extent to which}} the external symptoms of these two agents co-occur and reveals the spatial and temporal patterns present in affected woodland. Annual monitoring in eight affected woodlands showed that stem bleeding and emergence holes frequently occur on the same trees, with new emergence holes significantly more likely to occur when trees already have stem bleeds. Trials with coloured prism traps confirm A. biguttatus was present at all experimental sites. Beetle emergence is linked primarily to a few heavily declining trees, indicating that susceptibility may vary between hosts and that those with reduced health may be predisposed to AOD. Stem bleeds occur on trees in close proximity to the locations of trees with exit holes...|$|R
40|$|The {{so-called}} "quebra-galho" clone of Tahiti lime is {{very popular}} in Brazil, because {{the small size of}} the trees is suitable for high-density plantings. These Tahiti lime trees are easily recognized because they show bark-cracking symptoms, that have been claimed to be associated with "exocortis" infection. Viroid infection of three "quebra-galho" Tahiti lime trees from a farm near Araraquara in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, was assessed by Northern-blot hybridization using viroid-specific probes. Similarly, eight clones of Tahiti lime from different origins and available at Topara Nursery, near Chincha, Peru, were also tested for viroids. The four clones that displayed characteristic bark-cracking symptoms were found to be infected with Citrus exocortis viroid (CEVd), Hop stunt viroid (HSVd) and Citrus viroid III (CVd-III), whereas the clones that did not show bark-cracking symptoms were either viroid-free or infected only with CVd-III. A study is being conducted to establish if viroids, and in particular CEVd, are indeed the cause of "quebra-galho" <b>bark</b> <b>cracking</b> symptoms.

40|$|SummarySurface cracks create {{sites for}} {{pathogen}} invasion. Yew trees (Taxus) hyperbranch from long-lived buds that lie underneath the bark [1], resulting in persistent <b>bark</b> <b>cracking</b> and deep air pockets, potentially allowing pathogens {{to enter the}} nutrient-rich vascular system (vertical phloem and inter-connected radial medullary rays [MR]). Yew is famous {{as the source of}} the anti-cancer diterpenoid drug Taxol. A mystery has been why both the tree and its resident non-pathogenic fungi (endophytes) synthesize Taxol, apparently redundantly [2 – 7]. These endophytes, as well as pure Taxol, suppress fungal pathogens including wood-decaying fungi (WDF) [8 – 11]. Here we show that a Taxol-producing fungal endophyte, Paraconiothyrium SSM 001 [12], migrates to pathogen entry points including branch cracks. The fungus sequesters Taxol in intracellular hydrophobic bodies that are induced by WDF for release by exocytosis, after which the bodies can coalesce to form remarkable extracellular barriers, laced with the fungicide. We propose that microbial construction of fungicide-releasing hydrophobic barriers might be a novel plant defense mechanism. We further propose that the endophyte might be evolutionarily analogous to animal immune cells, in that it might expand plant immunity by acting as an autonomous, anti-pathogen sentinel that monitors the vascular system...|$|R

40|$|Field {{studies were}} {{conducted}} in the years 2003 - 2005 in the Rymanów Forest Unit in 13 stands aged between 40 to 100 years, which had 10 % - 60 % of the sycamore in their species composition. They grew on a mountain forest site (12 stands) and mountain riparian forest (1 stand). In each of them 100 trees were examined, growing {{next to each other}} in the central part of the stands. The disease symptoms, on trunks and in the crown area of each tree, and their intensity were determined according to the predefined symptomatic - developmental code. More than 80 fragments of wood and bark were collected from trunks of living and dead trees with local cankers and bark peeling off exposing wood. From the samples, 798 isolations were made on 2 % malt - agar medium. The examined sycamores in the Rymanów Forest Unit showed a large variation in the disease symptoms and their occurrence frequency. Among 1300 analyzed trees, only 13. 7 % did not show external, macroscopic disease symptoms. There was a relatively large share of dead trees (15. 0 %), which in individual stands ranged 4. 0 - 32. 0 %. The most frequent symptoms in crowns were as follows: top dying (6. 3 % trees), entire branch dying (16. 2 %) or only their tops (9. 6 %), crown thinning (19. 4 %), leaf atrophy (10. 8 %) and leaf discoloration (11. 6 %). On sycamores trunks, the following symptoms were found: plate-like and strip-like necrosis of bark that was breaking, falling off and exposing wood (8. 6 % trees), local bark cankers (14. 7 %), among which healed ones dominated (10. 3 %), <b>bark</b> <b>cracks</b> (14. 3 %) and tree cancer symptoms (3. 8 %). Bark necrosis and wood exposure formed 1. 5 times more frequently on the northern and western side than on the southern and eastern side, <b>bark</b> <b>cracks</b> appeared most frequently on the southern trunk side. On the cross sections of sycamore trunks, the following symptoms were found predominantly: T-shaped discolorations which appeared in the place of local healed cankers, dead wood regions in the places of local unhealed cankers and widespread bark cankers, sometimes taking the form of a sector reaching the part near the pith, and greyish - green or greenish - brown wood discolorations in the form of numerous stains, especially in the trunk periphery part. On the trunks of 184 (14. 2 %) sycamores, perithecia of Nectria coccinea were present. They formed in the area of cankers on bark and exposed wood alike. Fruiting bodies of Nectria cinnabarina, Eutypa acharii, Melanomma pulvis-pyrius, conidiomata of Cytospora ambiens, Aposphaeria cf. pulviscula and conidiomata of Stegonsporium pyriforme occurred sporadically. From wood, the following were isolated predominantly: Basidiomycetes sp. 1, Chalara sp. 1, Cadophora fastigiata, Nectria cinnabarina and Cytospora ambiens.
