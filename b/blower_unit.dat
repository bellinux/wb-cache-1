This work was necessitated by planned renovations to the dormitory building, one of the complex of nineteenth century buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places (Figs. 1, 2). The nature of the renovation would consist of excavating below the present floor of the dormitory basement so that air conditioning ducts and <b>blower</b> <b>units</b> might be installed; transformation of this basement from a storage place into a series of functional rooms and galleries; construction of a new entryway into the basement from the south (Figs. 2, 3); and the construction of a French drain along {{the south side of the}} dormitory to prevent flooding of the basement area (Fig. 2). Archaeological excavation units were located in those areas to be most severely disturbed by construction activities: two units in the dormitory basement and three units in the courtyard close to the south wall of the dormitory (Fig. 2). Preliminary analysis of the excavation data showed significant parallels with the 1974 Texas Historical Commission investigations (Clark 1974), permitting a clearance letter to be written almost immediately.

For IBM's Power Systems, the POWER Hypervisor (PHYP) {{is a native}} (bare-metal) hypervisor in firmware and provides isolation between LPARs. Processor capacity is provided to LPARs in either a dedicated fashion or on an entitlement basis where unused capacity is harvested and can be re-allocated to busy workloads. Groups of LPARs can have their processor capacity managed {{as if they were}} in a [...] "pool" [...] - IBM refers to this capability as Multiple Shared-Processor Pools (MSPPs) and implements it in servers with the POWER6 processor. LPAR and MSPP capacity allocations can be dynamically changed. Memory is allocated to each LPAR (at LPAR initiation or dynamically) and is address-controlled by the POWER Hypervisor. For real-mode addressing by operating systems (AIX, Linux, IBM i), the POWER processors (POWER4 onwards) have designed virtualization capabilities where a hardware address-offset is evaluated with the OS address-offset to arrive at the physical memory address. Input/Output (I/O) adapters can be exclusively [...] "owned" [...] by LPARs or shared by LPARs through an appliance partition known as the Virtual I/O Server (VIOS).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{analysis of}} the life-cycle costs for individual households and the aggregate energy and economic impacts from potential energy efficiency improvements in U. S. residential furnaces. Most homes in the US are heated by a central furnace attached to ducts for distributing heated air and fueled by natural gas. Electricity consumption by a furnace blower is significant, comparable to the annual electricity consumption of a major appliance. Since the same <b>blower</b> <b>unit</b> is also used during the summer to circulate cooled air in centrally air conditioned homes, electricity savings occur year round. Estimates are provided of the potential electricity savings from more efficient fans and motors. Current regulations require new residential gas-fired furnaces (not including mobile home furnaces) to meet or exceed 78 percent annual fuel utilization efficiency (AFUE), but in fact nearly all furnaces sold are at 80 percent AFUE or higher. The possibilities for higher fuel efficiency fall into two groups: more efficient non-condensing furnaces (81 percent AFUE) and condensing furnaces (90 - 96 percent AFUE). There are also options {{to increase the efficiency}} of the furnace blower. This paper reports the projected national energy and economic impacts of requiring higher efficiency furnaces in the future. Energy savings vary with climate, with the result that condensing furnaces offer larger energy savings in colder climates. The range of impacts for a statistical sample of households and the percent of households with net savings in life cycle cost are shown. Gas furnaces are somewhat unusual in that the technology does not easily permit incremental change to the AFUE above 80 percent. Achieving significant energy savings requires use of condensing technology, which yields a large efficiency gain (to 90 percent or higher AFUE), but has a higher cost. With respect to electricity efficiency design options, the ECM has a negative effect on the average LCC. The current extra cost of this technology more than offsets the sizable electricity savings...|$|E

40|$|Soymilk is {{becoming}} more and more popular because consumers become more health conscious and seek out alternatives to dairy products. Basically, soymilk is a water extract of soybeans, closely resembling dairy milk in appearance and composition. It contains high amounts of protein, iron, unsaturated fatty acids, and niacin, but low amounts of fat, carbohydrates, and calcium as compared with cow’s milk and human milk. Soymilk is also touted as a healthy food because it is cholesterol and lactose free and contains phytochemicals. It is recommended for those who are allergic to milk protein or have lactose intolerance and those who have special health or religious diet requirements. Furthermore, there is a real interest that soymilk in dried product. A dry powder product is highly desirable since it not only possesses long shelf-life, but also requires relatively low transportation cost and storage capacity and the product can be distributed over a wide area. Thus, a process for producing a dried soymilk powder that is soluble and without loss of nutritive value is highly desirable. A new develop technology for producing powder materials from suspension, namely fluidized bed drying of inert particle. The drying of pastes and suspensions in fluidized bed of inert partcles is a lower cost alternative to the spray drying, with the same level of product quality. Fluidized bed drying is much smaller volume and floor area than in a competitive spray dryer. This translates into lower investment and operating costs and possibly lowers power consumption. A high drying efficiency results from the large contact area and from the large temperature difference between the inlet and outlet air. The flexibility in the fluid flow regimes, the control of particle agglomeration, drying efficiency, film removal from particle surfaces and powder production should be enhanced in drying of suspensions in fluidized beds of inert particles. The objective of this research is to study in depth, how the process changes liquid feeds into powder can occur in the fluidized bed dryer of inert particles. Then several specific purposes can be described as follows: (i) determine the drying curve, (ii) study effect of inlet air temperature and inlet air velocity on thermal efficiency, material hold-up, and the residual moisture content, (iii) study the characteristics of powder product includes the proximate analysis (moisture, ash, protein, and carbohydrates), particle size distribution, morphology (appearance, size, and shape), density (bulk, tapped, and particle), porosity, wettability, and dispersibility, and (iv) simulation work for studying the effect of inlet air temperature and inlet air velocity on thermal efficiency. All the research activities will give five outputs fundamentally scientific and industrially application as contributions, such as: (i) data of type of inert particles, inlet air velocity, inlet air temperature, mass of feed, concentration of feed, and static bed height as operating parameter for commercially process design, (ii) prototype of fluidized bed dryer including piping, sensors and control system for producing soybean milk powder, (iii) data of drying kinetics for scaling up into industrial dryer scale design, (iv) one international publication within title “Performance Characteristics of Fluidized Bed Drying of Inert Particles for Producing Soybean Milk Powder” will be submitted in Drying Technology Journal, (v) one draft of proposed patent. The experimental works was conducted in the Food Process Engineering Laboratory, and the Separation Laboratory, Chemical Engineering Department, Diponegoro University from May-October 2009.
