40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} an estimation {{of a bank}} angle for bus rollover prediction when the <b>bus</b> is <b>driving</b> around a curved road. An estimator for the dynamic road bank, as well as vehicle sideslip angle estimation, using the dynamic simplex algorithm is designed to consider the influence of road bank on rollover prediction. An application of the estimated bank angle in rollover prediction was then provided. The proposed estimator is evaluated by TruckSim software, and simulation {{results show that the}} estimator can generate acceptable bus rollover prediction in typical scenarios...|$|R
