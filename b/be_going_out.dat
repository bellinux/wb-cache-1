5|$|Both yes–no {{questions}} and wh-questions in English are mostly formed using subject–auxiliary inversion (Am I going tomorrow?, Where can we eat?), which may require do-support (Do you like her?, Where did he go?). In most cases, interrogative words (wh-words; e.g. what, who, where, when, why, how) {{appear in a}} fronted position. For example, in the question What did you see?, the word what appears as the first constituent despite being the grammatical object of the sentence. (When the wh-word is the subject or forms part of the subject, no inversion occurs: Who saw the cat?.) Prepositional phrases can also be fronted when they are the question's theme, e.g. To whose house did you go last night?. The personal interrogative pronoun who is the only interrogative pronoun to still show inflection for case, with the variant whom serving as the objective case form, although this form may <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>out</b> of use in many contexts.|$|E

25|$|Things {{seemed to}} be going well for the band when it was {{announced}} that the Ignition Records label would <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>out</b> of business.

Kyle Herrman, a friend of the band, accompanied them for several days and filmed the documentary, Mass Appeal Madness. While initially only available at the band's final show, the film would continue to be sold on the internet for several more years.|$|E

25|$|The Notts County Supporters Trust {{were the}} {{majority}} shareholders {{in the club}} between 2006 and 2009. When the club went into administration in 2003, and looked to <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>out</b> of business, the money to keep the club in business was only found {{a week before the}} Football League's deadline. During this time, the supporters decided to form a supporters trust. In 2006 the trust eventually took control of Notts County Football Club, buying the club from Haydn Green. In 2009, members of the trust voted to accept a takeover bid from Munto Finance, with Peter Trembling named as Chairman. The group saw Sven-Göran Eriksson come in as Director of Football and Sol Campbell as a player.|$|E
