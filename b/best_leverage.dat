A study of an online sample of 888 supermarket consumers is conducted to test a number of hypotheses.

First, key inter-relationships among the equities are examined; thus advancing theory.

40|$|The Resource-Based View of {{the firm}} (RBV) posits as a {{necessary}} condition for diversification that a firm's resources can be leveraged beyond its original business.

We find that firm should, and do, extend their hosizontal and vertical scope when they compete in industries with more fast paced new product development. Two strong points about the study are (1) Because we are specific about the theory of the firm invoked, we can make more precise predictions, and (2) we test the predictions in production functions as well as in estimates of actual firm scop...|$|R

40|$|Abstract]: With {{worldwide}} sponsorship spending now {{in excess}} of US$ 26 billion, {{it is important for}} marketers to understand how to <b>best</b> <b>leverage</b> their sponsorship spend to achieve marketing and corporate goals. One widely used form of sponsorship leverage, particularly in the FMCG Industry is Sponsorship Leveraged Packaging (SLP) which involves depicting the sponsored property’s image, logos or symbols on the sponsoring brands’ packaging. Little is known empirically about if and how SLP impacts consumer attitudes to the sponsoring brand. It would be advantageous for organizations to establish how consumer attitudes are affected by SLP, thereby enabling management to adjust strategies and tactics, to justify continued spending on sponsorships and to differentiate their competitive offerings. This paper develops a research model and methodology to test the relationship between SLP and consumer attitudes and purchase intention...|$|E
