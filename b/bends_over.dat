25|$|The Mark Twain novel A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court {{features}} {{a man who}} lives on a pillar in {{the valley of the}} hermits and repeatedly <b>bends</b> <b>over</b> at the waist for his prayers. The main character hitches him to a sewing machine and uses the man to make linen shirts.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to weather}} conditions, peanuts are usually planted in Spring. The peanut {{comes from a}} yellow flower which <b>bends</b> <b>over</b> and infiltrates the soil after {{blooming}} and wilting, and the peanut starts {{to grow in the}} soil. Peanuts are harvested from late August to October, while the weather is clear. This weather allows for dry soil so that when picked, the soil does not stick to the stems and pods. The peanuts are then removed from vines and transported to a peanut shelling machine for mechanical drying. After cropping, the peanuts are delivered to warehouses for cleaning, where they are stored unshelled in silos.|$|E
25|$|Juliet {{catches her}} mother {{having an affair}} with one of her {{psychiatric}} clients and threatens to tell her father, but her mother tells her he knows. Shortly afterward, the two announce their intention to divorce, upsetting Juliet. Soon it is decided that the family will leave Christchurch, with Juliet to be left with a relative in South Africa. She becomes increasingly hysterical at the thought of leaving Pauline, and the two girls plan to run away together. When that plan becomes impossible, the two begin to talk about murdering Pauline's mother as they see her as the primary obstacle to their being together. As the date of Juliet's departure nears, it is decided that the two girls should spend the last three weeks together at Juliet's house. At the end of that time, Pauline returns home and the two finalize plans for the murder. Honora plans a day for the three of them at Victoria Park, and the girls decide this will be the day. Juliet puts a broken piece of brick into a stocking and they go off to the park. After having tea, the three walk down the path and when Honora <b>bends</b> <b>over</b> to pick up a pink charm the girls have put there, Juliet and Pauline bludgeon her to death.|$|E

500|$|The plot of v versus [...] {{above is}} not linear; {{although}} initially linear at low , it <b>bends</b> <b>over</b> to saturate at high [...] [...] Before {{the modern era}} of nonlinear curve-fitting on computers, this nonlinearity could {{make it difficult to}} estimate KM and Vmax accurately. [...] Therefore, several researchers developed linearisations of the Michaelis–Menten equation, such as the Lineweaver–Burk plot, the Eadie–Hofstee diagram and the Hanes–Woolf plot. [...] All of these linear representations can be useful for visualising data, but none should be used to determine kinetic parameters, as computer software is readily available that allows for more accurate determination by nonlinear regression methods.|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the video, Range <b>bends</b> <b>over</b> 'Mr Shy Guy' in {{a seductive}} manner, Buchanan pushes 'Mr Too Cool' to the floor, and Buena gives 'Mr Perfect' a lap dance. The Sugababes are shown dancing in the lift {{throughout}} the video. Daily Mirrors Gavin Martin wrote that they [...] "throw caution aside and present themselves as voracious maneaters" [...] in the video. He compared Buchanan's dancing to that of American girl group Destiny's Child in the video for their single [...] "Bootylicious". Madeline Crisp of the same publication described the Sugababes as having a [...] "60s look". The video peaked at number one on the UK TV Airplay chart for two consecutive weeks. In Australia, the clip reached number three on Rage's top 50 video countdown.|$|E
500|$|In the video, Beyoncé is seen {{mostly in}} all pink, and the dancers wear PVC jackets and dance around {{rippling}} satin sheets. She occasionally <b>bends</b> <b>over</b> and grabs her behind. The video cuts to Beyoncé wearing a polka dot corset against a hot magenta polka-dotted wall, wearing a pink wig and pink lipstick. Where black bars normally {{appear on a}} [...] (full screen) television showing a widescreen production, footage is displayed of curtains moving in the background. This was a trend in the videos directed by Williams during that year, with the effect being used in Ne-Yo's 2006 single [...] "So Sick" [...] and Jamie Foxx's 2005 single [...] "Unpredictable". [...] "Check on It" [...] won the Best R Video at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards. It was also nominated for Video of the Year at the 2006 BET Awards. Although Beyoncé did not perform [...] "Check on It" [...] in any televised appearances, it {{was a part of}} her set list on The Beyoncé Experience (2007) and the I Am... Tour (2009–10).|$|E

500|$|The 15th-century The Turke and Gowin {{begins with}} a Turk {{entering}} Arthur's court and asking, [...] "Is there any will, as a brother, To give a buffett and take another?" [...] Gawain accepts the challenge, and is then forced to follow the Turk until he decides to return the blow. Through the many adventures they have together, the Turk, out of respect, asks the knight {{to cut off the}} Turk's head, which Gawain does. The Turk, surviving, then praises Gawain and showers him with gifts. Sir Gawain and the Carle of Carlisle contains a scene in which the Carl, a lord, orders Gawain to strike him with his spear, and <b>bends</b> <b>over</b> to receive the blow. Gawain obliges, the Carl rises, laughing and unharmed, and, unlike in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, no return blow is demanded or given. Among all these stories, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight is the only one with a completely green character, and the only one tying Morgan le Fay to his transformation.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{contains}} {{a number of}} other cultural references. When Peter and Lois enter their motel room and find a hooker on the bed, Peter warns Lois to stay perfectly still, as the prostitute's vision is based on movement. This is a reference to a scene in the movie Jurassic Park (1993) in which Dr. Grant gives this warning in reference to a Tyrannosaurus Rex. Pinocchio appears in a cutaway gag, in which Gepetto <b>bends</b> <b>over</b> and deliberately sets Pinocchio up to tell a lie in an attempt to emulate anal sex. This was based on a joke MacFarlane's mother had told her friends when he was a child. Lois yells out George Clooney's name when she and Peter are having sex. The 1950s sitcom The Honeymooners is also referenced when a fictional episode of the sitcom is shown in which Ralph Kramden, the show's main character, hits his wife, Alice, something he would only threaten to do on the show. Meg watches an episode of the CBS sitcom Two and a Half Men, which shows three men in a living room, one of whom is cut in half at the waist and screaming in agony, the other two standing over him and screaming in horror. Fictional army soldier Flint of [...] appears briefly after Chris is caught drinking vodka, and educates the children on drinking and informs them that [...] "...knowing is half the battle". Flint's voice was provided by Bill Ratner, the actor who had voiced the character in the G.I. Joe television series. According to Seth Green, who voices Chris, the reason the Family Guy cast members did not voice Flint themselves is because if you have the original actor providing the voice [...] "you take it with a little bit more gravitas".|$|E
500|$|The Houston Chronicles Joey Guerra {{felt all}} of the album's tracks were strong, and wrote [...] "Every track plays like a {{potential}} hit single, and that's exactly what fans will love about 'E=MC²'. Expect it to soundtrack much of the summer and beyond." [...] Los Angeles Times staff writer, Richard Cromelin, gave the album two out of four stars, noting its [...] "alternatives to the glass-shattering flamboyance of her early '90s youth." [...] He concluded in his mixed review of the album, [...] "Of course, consistency isn't so important when an album is assembled {{as a series of}} singles rather than a cohesive work. Fortunately for Carey, the tabloid-tailored real-life back story {{on one side and the}} producer's craft on the other matter more than the art of singing in this particular fairy tale." [...] Ben Ratliff of The New York Times felt the album didn't level up to par with Carey's previous release, writing [...] "Much of the record sounds like urban-radio imitations, without the peculiarities and effective hooks of 'Mimi'. Maybe emancipation isn't a continuing procedure; maybe it only comes once." [...] Writing for PopMatters, Evan Sawdey rated E=MC² four out of ten discs, describing it as a [...] "shallow imitation of its predecessor". Sawdey concluded his review on a mixed note, stating [...] " [...] the second act of Mariah's comeback doesn't wisely expand her sound: it instead succumbs to the blueprint so carefully laid out by its predecessor, a pointless remake that exists only because it has to. If you ever had a doubt as to its formulaic nature, you need to look no further than its title. Long live the Diva." [...] Caryn Ganz from Rolling Stone questioned why she limited her vocal abilities throughout the record, [...] "nearly every song confines Carey to four-note verses, offering little room for her glorious range." [...] Journalist Eric Henderson, writing for Slant Magazine, graded the album three out of five stars, and concluding with, [...] "Such are the rewards of an album like 'E=MC²', in which one does reach a solution, but not before Mariah <b>bends</b> <b>over</b> backward to show her work." [...] The album finished in the top-ten of several [...] "best of 2008" [...] lists, ending at number four on an official poll held by Billboard, eight by The Detroit News, and number ten by The San Diego Union-Tribune. Robert Christgau picked out one song from the album, [...] "Touch My Body", as a [...] "choice cut" [...] (...) [...]|$|E

The help, Mrs. Drudge, gravitates to the radio, oblivious to the corpse, and turns it on {{just in time for}} an overly expository police message explaining that police are searching for an escaped madman in the swamps surrounding the manor. Simon, a mysterious young man new in the neighbourhood enters the house, and it is revealed that he has dumped Felicity Cunningham for her friend Cynthia Muldoon, lady of the house. In the audience, Birdboot has mentally done the same. Major Magnus Muldoon, Cynthia's brother-in-law, is also in love with Cynthia. Eventually Inspector Hound from the police force arrives on the scene, apparently searching for the madman, and the company finally notices the body. The company splits up to look for a man of suspicion, when Simon is left alone on stage with the body, he <b>bends</b> <b>over</b> it and seems to recognise the victim, at which point he is shot by an unknown assailant.|$|E
