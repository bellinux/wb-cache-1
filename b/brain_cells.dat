40|$|Insufficient {{cerebral}} O(2) supply {{leads to}} <b>brain</b> <b>cell</b> damage {{and loss of}} <b>brain</b> <b>cell</b> function. The relationship between the severity of hypoxemic <b>brain</b> <b>cell</b> damage {{and the loss of}} electrocortical brain activity (ECBA), as measure of <b>brain</b> <b>cell</b> function, is not yet fully elucidated in near-term newborns. We hypothesized that there is a strong relationship between cerebral purine and pyrimidine metabolism, as measures of <b>brain</b> <b>cell</b> damage, and <b>brain</b> <b>cell</b> function during hypoxemia. Nine near-term lambs (term, 147 d) were delivered at 131 (range, 120 - 141) d of gestation. After a stabilization period, prolonged hypoxemia (fraction of inspired oxygen, 0. 10; duration, 2. 5 h) was induced. Mean values of carotid artery blood flow, as a measure of cerebral blood flow, and ECBA were calculated over the last 3 min of hypoxemia. At the end of the hypoxemic period, cerebral arterial and venous blood gases were determined and CSF was obtained. CSF from 11 normoxemic siblings was used for baseline values. HPLC was used to determine purine and pyrimidine metabolites in CSF, as measures of <b>brain</b> <b>cell</b> damage. Concentrations of purine and pyrimidine metabolites were significantly higher in hypoxemic lambs than in their siblings, whereas ECBA was lower in hypoxemic lambs. Significant negative linear relationships were found between purine and pyrimidine metabolite concentrations and, respectively, cerebral O(2) supply, cerebral O(2) consumption, and ECBA. We conclude that <b>brain</b> <b>cell</b> function is related to concentrations of purine and pyrimidine metabolites in the CSF. Reduction of ECBA indeed reflects the measure of brain damage due to hypoxemia in near-term newborn lambs...|$|R

40|$|The {{capacity}} of a panel of HIV- 1 isolates to infect primary mixed fetal <b>brain</b> <b>cell</b> cultures was estimated and their sensitivity to inhibition by a range of coreceptor ligands assessed.

CCR 5 ligands (including AOP-RANTES, a potent inhibitor of CCR 5 -dependent infection), however, blocked infection only weakly, raising the possibility that alternative unidentified coreceptors are also used.

5|$|Amnesic {{shellfish}} poisoning (ASP) {{was first}} reported in eastern Canada in 1987. It {{is caused by}} the substance domoic acid found in certain diatoms of the genus Pseudo-nitzschia.

5|$|All {{members of}} Cicuta except C.bulbifera contain {{high levels of}} the {{poisonous}} principle cicutoxin, an unsaturated aliphatic alcohol that is structurally {{closely related to the}} toxin oenanthotoxin found in the plant hemlock water dropwort. Cicutoxin is present at all stages of growth and {{in all parts of the}} plant, but is most concentrated in the roots which appear to be the most toxic in the early spring. Its primary toxic effect is to act as a stimulant in the central nervous system. It is a non-competitive gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor antagonist. Cicutoxin acts on the GABAA receptor causing a block of the chloride channel which results in neuronal depolarization. In the presence of cicutoxin this depolarization continues unabated causing cell overactivity. The hyperactivity in <b>brain</b> <b>cells</b> results in seizures. Cicutoxin is highly poisonous and water hemlock is considered one of North America's most toxic plants. Ingestion of Cicuta can be fatal in humans and there are reports in the medical literature of severe poisoning and death as early as 1670. A number of people have also died following ingestion of the plant in the 20th and 21st century.|$|E

5|$|Huntington's disease (HD), {{also known}} as Huntington's chorea, is an {{inherited}} disorder that results in death of <b>brain</b> <b>cells.</b> The earliest symptoms are often subtle problems with mood or mental abilities. A general lack of coordination and an unsteady gait often follow. As the disease advances, uncoordinated, jerky body movements become more apparent. Physical abilities gradually worsen until coordinated movement becomes difficult and the person is unable to talk. Mental abilities generally decline into dementia. The specific symptoms vary somewhat between people. Symptoms usually begin between 30 and 50 years of age, but can start at any age. The disease may develop earlier in life in each successive generation. About 8% of cases start {{before the age of}} 20 years and typically present with symptoms more similar to Parkinson's disease.

After one of their sharks escapes the facility and attempts to attack a boat full of teenagers, financial backers send corporate executive Russell Franklin to investigate the facility. In the laboratory, doctors Susan McAlester and Jim Whitlock prove their research is working by testing a certain protein complex that was removed from the brain tissue of their largest shark. However, Jim's right arm is bitten off by the animal shortly afterwards. Brenda Kerns, the tower's operator, calls a helicopter to evacuate Jim, but as he is being lifted, the stormy weather causes Jim to fall into the shark pen. The shark then grabs Jim's stretcher and pulls the helicopter into the tower, killing Brenda and the pilots.|$|E
5|$|The brain consumes up {{to twenty}} percent of the energy used by the human body, more than any other organ. Brain {{metabolism}} normally relies upon blood glucose as an energy source, but during times of low glucose (such as fasting, endurance exercise, or limited carbohydrate intake), the brain uses ketone bodies for fuel with a smaller need for glucose. The brain can also utilize lactate during exercise. Long-chain fatty acids cannot cross the blood–brain barrier, but the liver can break these down to produce ketone bodies. However, short-chain fatty acids (e.g., butyric acid, propionic acid, and acetic acid) and the medium-chain fatty acids, octanoic acid and heptanoic acid, can cross the blood–brain barrier and be metabolized by <b>brain</b> <b>cells.</b> The brain stores glucose in the form of glycogen, albeit in significantly smaller amounts than that found in the liver or skeletal muscle.|$|E

5|$|Turning Urine Samples into Brain Cells: This new {{technique}} of reprogramming ordinary cells present in urine into immature <b>brain</b> <b>cells</b> that can form multiple types of functioning neurons and glial cells {{was developed by}} Chinese researchers in China, and {{was published in the}} scientific journal Nature Methods in December 2012.

This technique makes the procedure of generating Induced pluripotent stem cells far easier and non-invasive, as the cells can be obtained from a urine sample instead of a blood sample or biopsy. This research proves human excreta could be a powerful source of cells to study disease, bypassing some of the problems of using stem cells, and could be useful for research studying the cellular mechanisms of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and for testing the effects of new drugs that are being developed to treat them.|$|E
5|$|The {{pituitary}} {{develops in}} {{the third week of}} embryogenesis from interactions between the diencephalon part of the brain and the nasal cavity. The <b>brain</b> <b>cells</b> secrete FGF-8, Wnt5a and BMP-4, and the oral cavity BMP-2. Together, these cellular signals stimulate a group of cells from the oral cavity to form Rathke's pouch, which becomes independent of the nasal cavity and develops into the anterior pituitary; this process includes the suppression of production of a protein called Sonic hedgehog by the cells of Rathke's pouch. The cells then differentiate further into the various hormone-producing cells of the pituitary. This requires particular transcription factors that induce the expression of particular genes. Some of these transcription factors {{have been found to be}} deficient in some forms of rare combined pituitary hormone deficiencies (CPHD) in childhood. These are HESX1, PROP1, POU1F1, LHX3, LHX4, TBX19, SOX2 and SOX3. Each transcription factor acts in particular groups of cells. Therefore, various genetic mutations are associated with specific hormone deficiencies. For instance, POU1F1 (also known as Pit-1) mutations cause specific deficiencies in growth hormone, prolactin and TSH. In addition to the pituitary, some of the transcription factors are also required for the development of other organs; some of these mutations are therefore also associated with specific birth defects.|$|E
5|$|There is {{speculation}} {{of several}} {{mechanisms by which}} the <b>brain</b> <b>cells</b> could be lost. One mechanism consists of an abnormal accumulation of the protein alpha-synuclein bound to ubiquitin in the damaged cells. This insoluble protein accumulates inside neurones forming inclusions called Lewy bodies. According to the Braak staging, a classification of the disease based on pathological findings, Lewy bodies first appear in the olfactory bulb, medulla oblongata and pontine tegmentum; individuals at this stage may be asymptomatic or may have early non-motor symptoms (such as loss of sense of smell, or some sleep or automatic dysfunction). As the disease progresses, Lewy bodies develop in the substantia nigra, areas of the midbrain and basal forebrain and, finally, the neocortex. These brain sites are the main places of neuronal degeneration in PD; however, Lewy bodies may not cause cell death {{and they may be}} protective (with the abnormal protein sequestered or walled off). Other forms of alpha-synuclein (e.g., oligomers) that are not aggregated in Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites may actually be the toxic forms of the protein. In people with dementia, a generalized presence of Lewy bodies is common in cortical areas. Neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques, characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, are not common unless the person is demented.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Insufficient {{cerebral}} O 2 supply {{leads to}} cellular energy failure {{and loss of}} <b>brain</b> <b>cell</b> function. The relationship between the severity of cellular energy failure due to hemorrhagic hypotension {{and the loss of}} electrocortical brain activity (ECBA), as a measure of <b>brain</b> <b>cell</b> function, is not yet fully elucidated in near-term born lambs. OBJECTIVES: To study the relationship between cerebral purine and pyrimidine metabolism, as a measure of <b>brain</b> <b>cell</b> energy failure, and <b>brain</b> <b>cell</b> function after hemorrhagic hypotension in near-term born lambs. METHODS: Eight near-term lambs (term 147 days) were delivered at 131 days of gestation. After a stabilization period, mean arterial blood pressure was reduced till 30 % of baseline by withdrawal of blood. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was obtained {{at the end of the}} hypotensive period (2. 5 h). CSF from 8 siblings was used for comparison. HPLC was used to determine purine and pyrimidine metabolites in CSF, as a measure of cellular energy failure. ECBA was calculated as the root mean square value of a band-filtered (2 - 16 Hz) one-channel EEG. RESULTS: Values of guanosine, inosine, hypoxanthine, xanthine and uridine were significantly higher, while ECBA was significantly lower after hemorrhagic hypotension than control values. The concentrations of inosine, hypoxanthine, xanthine and uridine were significantly negatively linearly related to ECBA. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Brain</b> <b>cell</b> function is negatively related to concentrations of inosine, hypoxanthine, xanthine and uridine in the CSF after hemorrhagic hypotension in near-term born lambs...|$|R
