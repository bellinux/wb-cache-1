2500|$|On {{the morning}} of July 15, 1974, Chubbuck {{confused}} co-workers by claiming she had to read a newscast to open Suncoast Digest, something she had never done before. That morning's talk show guest waited across the studio while Chubbuck sat at the news anchor's desk. During the first eight minutes of her program, Chubbuck covered three national news stories and then a shooting from the previous day at local restaurant Beef & Bottle, at the Sarasota-Bradenton Airport. The film reel of the restaurant shooting had jammed and would not run, so Chubbuck shrugged it off and said on-camera, [...] "In keeping with Channel 40's policy of <b>bringing</b> <b>you</b> the latest in 'blood and guts', and in living color, {{you are going to}} see another first—attempted suicide." [...] She drew the revolver and shot herself behind her right ear. Chubbuck fell forward violently and the technical director faded the broadcast rapidly to black.|$|E
2500|$|The {{completion}} of the screenplay, concerned Sparks that Cyrus {{would not be able}} to successfully execute the role: [...] "The first thing I thought when I finished the screenplay was, wow, I hope she can do this, this is a tough role because I'm <b>bringing</b> <b>you</b> through a whole gamut of emotion and you're just a 16-year-old girl who's done the Disney Channel. Are you able to do this as an actress?", After visiting the set and watching Cyrus film, Sparks' worries abated. To play the New York teen, Cyrus worked with a dialect coach to lose her Southern accent and learned to play classical piano. After she completed filming, Cyrus said that in a case of life imitating art, she had matured and [...] "changed a lot" [...] over the course of her summer in Georgia, similar to the way Ronnie does in the film. [...] "Showing this movie, I feel like I'm really showing a part of my growth as a person as well. So I'm really excited for people to see it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although never a nationalist, Merezhkovsky was a Russo-centric {{author and}} thinker, cherishing {{the idea of}} his country's unique {{and in many ways}} decisive place in the world culture in history. Never tiring of reiterating the [...] "Russian plight is the problem of the world, not Russia" [...] postulate, he was ever on the {{look-out}} for some 'strong leader' who would be able to organize and successfully see through the anti-Communist crusade. For a while Merezhkovsky thought he's found his hero in Benito Mussolini who, having sponsored his book on Dante, had several lengthy talks with the Russian writer on politics, literature and art. Impressed, Merezhkovsky started to see his new friend as an incarnation of Dante, almost. In a letter addressed to Mussolini, he wrote:The best, the truest and the liveliest document on Dante is — your personality. To understand Dante one has to live through him, but only you being around makes that possible. Two souls, his and yours, are merged into one, Infinity itself <b>bringing</b> <b>you</b> two together. Visualize Mussolini in contemplation, and it's Dante. Imagine Dante in action, and it's Mussolini.|$|E

2500|$|In 1675, the Iroquois {{made peace}} with the Machian while finally {{defeating}} the Susquenhannock. In the late 1670s and early 1680s, the Five Nations started to raid {{what is now the}} Midwest, battling the Miami and the Illinois while alternatively fighting against and attempting to make an alliance with the Ottawa. One Onondaga chief, Otreouti, whom the French called La Grande Gueule ("the big mouth"), announced in a speech in 1684 that the wars against the Illinois and Miami were justified because [...] "They came to hunt beavers on our lands...". Initially, the French took an ambivalent attitude towards the Iroquois push west. On one hand, having the Five Nations at war with other nations prevented those nations from trading with the English at Albany while on the other hand, the French did not want to the Iroquois become the only middlemen in the fur trade. But as the Iroquois continued to win against the other nations, prevented French and Algonquin fur traders from entering the Mississippi river valley, and the Ottawa showed signs of finally making an alliance with the Five Nations, in 1684 the French declared war on the Iroquois. Otreouti in an appeal for help correctly noted: [...] "The French will have all the beavers and are angry with us for <b>bringing</b> <b>you</b> any". Starting in 1684, the French repeatedly raided Kanienkeh, burning crops and villages as Louis gave orders to [...] "humble" [...] the Five Nations once and for all, and to teach them to respect the [...] "grandeur" [...] of France. The repeated French raids took their toll with the Mohawk who could field about 300 warriors in the 1670s to able to field only 170 warriors in the summer of 1691. The Iroquois struck back by making raids into New France with the most successful being a raid on Lachine in 1689 that killed 24 Frenchmen while taking 80 captives, but the superior resources of the French state proceeded to grind them down until they finally made peace in 1701.|$|E
