40|$|THE SUMMER THERMAL STRESS IN LISBOA; A BIOCLIMATIC APPROACH. The summer {{frequency}} of hot days was studied, in Lisboa/Portela, with daily {{data from the}} period 1981 / 97. We used the Physiological Equivalent Temperature, an index of thermal confort based on the human energy balance, and calculated with air temperature, vapour pressure, wind speed and mean radiant temperature. It was assumed that mean radiant temperature was equal to air temperature, which is acceptable in the shade. The days were classifiend in two groups: hot days and very hot days, according to the thresholds of PET of 29 ºC and 35 ºC; 10 % of the days had warm stress, with a maximum of frequency in July and a great interanual variability. The relation between the thermal discomfort and the wind regime was analysed. Most of the unconfortable days had breeze conditions, with the wind blowing from the East (from the estuary) during the morning; in the afternoon, the <b>barometric</b> <b>gradient</b> between the Ocean and the Iberian Peninsula increases, the breeze {{is replaced by a}} week northerly wind. The frequent occurence of strong northerly winds in summer is an important factor of reduction of the warm stress in Lisbo...|$|E
40|$|Oporto is {{a medium}} size {{city on the}} NW coast of Portugal with {{approximately}} 300 000 inhabitants that has experienced an intense urbanization process especially after 1970. Results from daily field work from November 2003 to January 2005 show several different thermal nocturnal pattern in Paranhos, Oporto, some of which we conclude can easily be related to different weather types. Our main purpose is to demonstrate the diversity of Oporto’s climatic subsystem resolution processes under generically similar weather types, as found during our period of itinerant measurements. Our research underlines {{the idea that the}} latitude, the strength of the winds from west, the Douro’s river presence and the altimetric diversity are not sufficient to erase the influence of urban metabolism on the energy city balance. From the analysis of the various examples selected, it is possible to state that there is a significant relationship between the weather type and the magnitude and pattern of the “urban heat islands”. The “urban heat-island” was specially evident on days of strong stability, weak <b>barometric</b> <b>gradient,</b> weak wind and frequent periods of calm, conditions normally associated with the presence of anticyclonic situations, but which we have found also under the influence of cyclonic weather types. We conclude however that it is not absolutely true that the “urban heat-island” is weaker under cyclonic than anticyclonic weather types. On the majority of the days with cyclonic weather and good mixing conditions we frequently verified a disturbance in the explicatory capacity of the two geographic factors considered - distance from the sea and altitude ( [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|The {{moisture}} {{transmission performance}} of building envelopes {{is a subject}} of national and international significance. However, {{in spite of the}} considerable research efforts that have taken place, there remains a lack of fundamental knowledge on the various moisture transport processes and their interaction in practical situations. One of the principal reasons for this is the absence of an investigative tool which can provide accurate information on realistically-sized test specimens subjected to environmental conditions representative of those experienced in practice. This project will address this deficiency. The first stage of the project will involve the installation and commissioning of a specialist X-Ray absorption apparatus, similar to that already operating at DTU(Denmark) and being installed at NIST (USA). This can perform multi-dimensional measurements with sub-millimetric resolution on 420 mm test specimens subjected to uniform temperature and humidity conditions. In the second stage, this core apparatus will be substantially modified to allow the imposition of temperature, humidity and <b>barometric</b> <b>gradients</b> across the specimens. The operational capabilities of the enhanced apparatus will be validated against results from previous and existing EPSRC projects based on conventional gravimetric techniques, as well as results from existing low resolution NMR equipment. A programme of dissemination will then take place, including a series of BRE-sponsored Workshops and a portfolio of possible future research projects developed...|$|R
50|$|The basic {{principles}} of physics and the Coriolis effect satisfactorily explain that {{the direction of the}} wind in the atmosphere is parallel to the isobars. Measurements of wind speed and direction at heights well above ground level confirm that the speed of the wind matches that predicted by considerations of gradient flow, and the direction of the wind is indeed parallel to the isobars in the region. However, from ground level up to heights where the influence of the earth’s surface can be neglected, the wind speed is less than predicted by the <b>barometric</b> pressure <b>gradient,</b> and the wind direction is partly across the isobars rather than parallel to them. This flow of air across the isobars near ground level is a secondary flow. It does not conform to the primary flow, which is parallel to the isobars.|$|R
40|$|Barometric pressure, surface {{temperature}} and wind time {{series in the}} eastern equatorial Pacific are analyzed to determine if oceanic tropical instability wave (TIW) sea {{surface temperature}} variations cause <b>barometric</b> pressure <b>gradients</b> large enough to influence the atmospheric boundary layer. During the study period from April 2001 through September 2002, 11 TIWs propagated westward past 110 W, causing a spectral peak at 20 - 30 days in the sea surface temperature (SST) meridional difference between 2 N, 110 W and 0, 110 W. Likewise, the meridional pressure difference also had a spectral peak in the 20 - 30 day TIW band. Crossspectral analysis shows that within the TIW band, SST-induced pressure variations were roughly ! 0. 1 hPa C in magnitude. The resulting pressure gradient force is comparable in magnitude to other terms in the meridional momentum balance. Implications {{about the role of}} the boundarylayer capping in the adjustment to SST forcing are discussed...|$|R
40|$|While their ecological, {{economical}} {{and societal}} values are irrefutable, {{an uncertain future}} exists for coral reefs and numerous {{studies suggest that the}} threat of coral bleaching will worsen under global warming. Despite the association between global warming and coral reef health, there is a paucity of data relating to the exchanges of heat, moisture and momentum between the atmosphere and the reef surface during bleaching episodes. Understanding these key reef-atmosphere interactions is essential for identifying the processes which control the thermal environment of water on the reef. In this paper we present new direct in situ measurements of radiation transfers and sensible and latent heat fluxes associated with an observed localised coral bleaching event at Heron Reef, in the southern Great Barrier Reef. Measurements were made during a three day period in February 2009 using the Eddy Covariance method. Under the influence of a weak <b>barometric</b> pressure <b>gradient,</b> clear skies and light north easterly winds, daily net radiation peaked at more than 800 W m 2, with up to 95 % of the net radiation during the morning being partitioned into heating the water column, substrate and benthic cover. Heating was exacerbated by a midafternoon low tide, and low wind speeds resulted in reduced evaporative cooling of the water surface. As a result, daily maximum water surface temperatures exceeded 34 °C and near-bottom temperatures 33 °C. Such conditions in conjunction with limited horizontal heat transfer due to the pooling of reef waters at the site meant that the water surface and near-bottom water temperatures exceeded 30 °C for 27 % and 38 % of the duration of the observation period respectively resulting in widespread coral bleaching...|$|R
