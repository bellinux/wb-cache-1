6000|$|For Aaron to {{hold out}} against her {{admittance}} {{would have been to}} defraud himself, for she transformed his house. When she saw the <b>brass</b> <b>lining</b> of the jelly-pan discolored, and that the stockings hanging from the string beneath the mantelpiece had given way where the wearers were hardest on them; when she found dripping adhering to a cold frying-pan instead of in a [...] "pig," [...] and the pitcher leaking and the carrot-grater stopped--when these and similar discoveries were made by Grizel, was it a squeal of horror she gave that such things should be, or a cry of rapture because to her had fallen the task of setting them right? ...|$|E

5000|$|The term Rose Line as the Paris Meridian {{was given}} by Dan Brown in his novel The Da Vinci Code as an {{alternate}} name for [...] "the world's first prime meridian", identified as the Paris Meridian. Brown's novel also conflates this meridian with a gnomon in the Parisian church of Saint-Sulpice marked in {{the floor with a}} <b>brass</b> <b>line,</b> as did the 1967 Priory Document Le Serpent Rouge - Notes sur Saint-Germain-des-Près et Saint-Sulpice de Paris. The Paris Meridian actually passes about 100 metres east of the gnomon, which according to author Sharan Newman and a sign in the church was [...] "never called a Rose-Line". A St Sulpice booklet dating from 2000, in the page {{about the history of the}} gnomon describes the <b>brass</b> <b>line</b> as [...] "a meridian", it does not use the term Roseline or Rose Line. Author Paul Murdin describes such sun lines as a [...] "Meridian", or meridiana.|$|R
25|$|The {{system is}} first {{built around a}} meridian, a line which is {{strictly}} oriented along the north-south axis, represented by a <b>brass</b> <b>line</b> set in a strip of white marble {{on the floor of}} the church. This is not the Paris Meridian, established by Louis XIV in 1667, which is located a few hundred metres to the east and goes through the Observatory of Paris.|$|R
2500|$|Several {{claims about}} the Church of Saint-Sulpice in Paris are disputed. While there is a <b>brass</b> <b>line</b> running north-south through the church, {{it is not a}} part of the Paris Meridian. The line is instead more of a gnomon or sundial/calendar, meant to mark the {{solstice}} and equinoxes. Further, there is no evidence that there was ever a temple of Isis on the site. This note has been on display in the church: ...|$|R

5000|$|We began The Hobbit with research: reading Tolkien's {{literature}} and immersing {{ourselves in the}} world of Bilbo, Gandalf and Gollum. Bilbo's enchanting world needed a music score that was simple, melodic and organic for his adventures through Middle Earth, switching to bold and dramatic for the combat scenes. Reading the literature, one can hear fiddles, wood flutes, bagpipes, guitar, mandolins and bodhráns. And when a fight or battle occurs, one can imagine the pulse of low chugging strings, dramatic percussion and moving <b>brass</b> <b>lines</b> and stabs.|$|R

The song {{was sent to}} rhythmic contemporary radio as the album's fifth single on December 6, 2016. Lyrically, the song talks about forgiveness and rebuilding trust after infidelity, with the protagonist trying to rekindle the passion with her lover. The song's music video {{is part of a}} one-hour film with the same title as its parent album, originally aired on HBO.|$|R

"Pulstar" [...] (possibly a {{portmanteau}} of [...] "pulsar" [...] and [...] "star") {{builds on}} a synthesizer pulse sequence, a main line {{and various other}} synthesizer <b>brass</b> <b>lines.</b> It ends with a recording of the speaking clock. [...] "Freefall" [...] builds on a gamelan sequence and a synthesizer line. [...] "Mare Tranquillitatis" [...] is a quiet synthesizer piece featuring recordings of several Apollo moon landings. [...] "Main sequence" [...] is propelled by a pulsed synthesizer sequence, along which a drums-based jazz track develops. It calms down and flows into the next song, [...] "Sword of Orion", built on an arpeggio chord, melody, and percussion.|$|R

50|$|One of CMI's initial {{operating}} decisions was {{to begin}} producing a full line of background and low brass instruments {{in addition to the}} trumpet, cornet and trombone models that Olds was already making and had built its reputation on. However, the Olds plant in Los Angeles was not set up for manufacturing the additional <b>brass</b> <b>lines</b> and CMI had difficulty finding a partner who would provide these instruments to Olds without also producing the more profitable small brass and trombones. Instead, CMI's president, Maurice Berlin, coaxed Foster Reynolds, a former apprentice at J.W. York,30 year veteran of the H.N. White company, and founder of F.A. Reynolds Co., out of retirement and sent him to Los Angeles with a directive to tool up the factory and begin manufacturing the full <b>line</b> of <b>brasses.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... "Looking Hot" [...] is a synth-slathered pop song {{replete with}} {{a dose of}} ska and reggae flavor, with a {{pounding}} arena-rave beat, drenched in '80s new wave tones. Lyrically, [...] "Looking Hot" [...] finds Gwen Stefani spouting tongue-in-cheek lyrics about being a well-preserved forty-something frontwoman, wondering how much longer she can indulge in skintight clothes. [...] "Go ahead and look at me cause that's what I want. Take a good look won't you please cause that's what I want," [...] she sings over lazy <b>brass</b> <b>lines</b> and cushy synth runs. [...] "I {{know you want to}} stare. You can't help it and I don't care." [...] According to James Montgomery of MTV News, the song [...] "pairs club-ready thump with catwalk-approved strut, with breezy horns, melding their skanking past with their shiny pop present.|$|R

60|$|Once more quite unintentionally he {{stumbled}} upon these two people. It was about seven o'clock. He stopped outside a linen draper's and peered over the {{goods in the}} window at the assistants in torment. He could have spent a whole day happily at that. He told himself {{that he was trying to}} see how they dressed out the <b>brass</b> <b>lines</b> over their counters, in a purely professional spirit, but down at the very bottom of his heart he knew better. The customers were a secondary consideration, and it was only after the lapse of perhaps a minute that he perceived that among them was--the Young Lady in Grey! He turned away from the window at once, and saw the other man in brown standing at the edge of the pavement and regarding him with a very curious expression of face.|$|R

5000|$|The {{use of a}} tube for {{intubation}} {{had often}} been attempted but unsuccessfully. After five years of study, working with surgeon George Fell, by 1885 O'Dwyer had devised a set of tubes of graduating in size to fit children from one to ten years of age. He also developed a procedure for the insertion and extraction of the tube, using specially designed instruments. After a number of refinements the final tubes, made by George Tiemann and Company of New York, were made of <b>brass,</b> <b>lined</b> with gold, and came in five different sizes. These were later supplanted by Annandale's rubber endotracheal tube. The method proved successful in relieving difficulty in breathing. In 1885, O'Dwyer presented his findings. According to Sperati and Felisanti, O'Dwyer's modifications in Bouchut's concept [...] "were determinant". O'Dwyer's tubes of hard rubber or metal had rounded edges and were therefore, well tolerated.|$|R

5000|$|Line Renaud {{was born}} as Jacqueline Ente in Pont-de-Nieppe on 2 July 1928.

5000|$|The corps became {{well known}} for its large, talented <b>brass</b> <b>lines</b> taught by the late Pete Spadero. The 1975 {{offering}} gained notoriety by beating nearly every other line in head to head competition. Powered by Lewis, Hawkins, Cavanaugh, Fennell and others, the corps presented {{the first of its}} hallmark [...] "Big Band" [...] shows featuring American Patrol and the Harry James Medley. The soprano solos by Fennell gained the reputation of Harry James II. In addition, the Vagabonds were the host corps for the long-running classic drum corps show the American International Open. In its heyday during the late 1970s and early 1980s, the AIO was a two- or three-day event with national corps hoping to capture the lucrative purse. By 1981, however, the Vagabonds could field only 18 horns and were not as competitive as in earlier years. The first generation of Vagabonds came to an end after the 1981 season.|$|R
