5|$|Ajax {{had little}} success in European {{competition}} {{prior to their}} meeting with Liverpool. They had qualified for the European Cup Winners' Cup twice during the 1960–61 and 1961–62 seasons, but did not progress past the first round either time. Liverpool had only participated in European competition during the previous two season, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> more success than Ajax. Their first season of competition in 1964–65 they reached the semi-finals of the European Cup, losing to eventual winners Internazionale. The following season they reached {{the final of the}} European Cup Winners' Cup, however, they lost 2–1 against German team Borussia Dortmund.|$|E

5|$|Although lesbian-feminism was a {{significant}} shift, not all lesbians agreed with it. Lesbian-feminism was a youth-oriented movement: its members were primarily college educated, with experience in New Left and radical causes, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> not seen any success in persuading radical organizations to take up women's issues. Many older lesbians who had acknowledged their sexuality in more conservative times felt maintaining their ways of coping in a homophobic world was more appropriate. The Daughters of Bilitis folded in 1970 over which direction to focus on: feminism or gay rights issues.|$|E
5|$|Despite this surrender, leaving Dawes {{standing}} awkwardly holding seven swords, {{the fighting}} continued for minutes more and numerous Confederates {{were able to}} escape back to Herr Ridge. The three Union regiments lost 390440 of 1,184 engaged, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> blunted Davis's attack, prevented them from striking {{the rear of the}} Iron Brigade, and so overwhelmed the Confederate brigade that it was unable to participate significantly in combat {{for the rest of the}} day. The Confederate losses were about 500 killed and wounded and over 200 prisoners out of 1,707 engaged.|$|E
5|$|Headley {{was born}} in Colón, Panama on 30 May 1909, the son of DeCourcy Headley and Irene Roberts. Neither of Headley's parents was from Panama; his father was from Barbados and his mother from Jamaica, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> moved to Panama while DeCourcey worked on the {{construction}} of the Panama Canal. By the time Headley was five years old the Canal was complete, and the family moved to Cuba in search of further employment. In 1919, concerned by the amount of Spanish being spoken by her son, Headley's mother took him to Jamaica so he could be educated in an English-speaking school.|$|E

5|$|In the UK Control Risks, a British {{security}} company—paid by {{an anonymous}} donor {{to assist the}} McCanns since 7 May—took hair samples from the McCann twins on 24 September, at their parents' request. The twins had slept through the commotion in apartment 5A after Madeleine was reported missing; Kate wrote that she was concerned the abductor might have given the children sedatives. According to the Polícia Judiciária files, Kate had asked them to take samples, {{three months after the}} disappearance, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> not done so. Control Risks took a sample from Kate too, to rebut allegations that she was on medication. No trace of drugs was found.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} part of 1186, {{after the death}} of King Henry's son Geoffrey– who was Duke of Brittany– King Philip II of France demanded that Geoffrey's daughters be placed in the French king's custody, and that the duchy of Brittany, which Geoffrey had ruled in right of his wife, be {{surrendered}} into French royal custody. Coutances was one of the negotiators sent by King Henry to secure a settlement, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> to settle for a temporary truce. In January 1188 Coutances took the cross when he pledged to go on Crusade along with King Henry and King Philip of France.|$|E
5|$|Initially, some of {{the coal}} carried on the canal had been transported in boats owned by the canal company, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> given up this {{practice}} in 1812. They resumed carrying coal in 1827, because they felt that coal stocks at Grantham were not adequate, but were accused of price-fixing. Although the penalty imposed by Lincoln Assizes was small, they ceased this trade, and the coal merchants agreed to maintain stocks of 2,660 tons at Grantham. In 1833, J. Rofe and his son made {{a proposal for a}} canal to connect Grantham and Sleaford, but this was not pursued.|$|E

His family was not musical, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> a piano, which no-one in the house could play. Miller, however, played tunes on the piano {{from the age of}} six, playing by ear. He had piano lessons from the age of eight. As a child, he played blues and rhythm and blues for dances, and gospel music in a church. His family was Methodist, but he played in churches of various denominations. His principal influence on piano at this stage was Ramsey Lewis.|$|E
5|$|That {{afternoon}} three {{troops of}} tanks from the 13th/18th Royal Hussars, {{were sent to}} reinforce the Black Watch, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> only just started to move towards the Château when three tanks were destroyed by hidden German self-propelled guns. The other tanks were withdrawn being unable to deploy in the wooded ground around the Château. The {{rest of the day}} and night passed without another attack, but the Germans sent out reconnaissance patrols to establish the exact location of the British positions and German armoured vehicles could be heard moving up to the front during the night.|$|E
5|$|The battalion's 'A' Company {{suffered}} a similar fate, the officer commanding was wounded crossing the start line, {{and at the}} same time every member of the 2nd Platoon was killed or wounded. The CSM assumed command of the company but was killed when they reached Bréville. The company second in command who had been bringing up the rear, reached the village and found the 3rd Platoon only had nine men left <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> managed to clear the village Château and the 1st Platoon had cleared its grounds.|$|E

5|$|Well Dunn {{continued}} {{to face the}} top teams in the WWF, including The Smoking Gunns, The Headshrinkers, and the newly formed team of Sparky Plugg and the 1-2-3 Kid. When The Smoking Gunns were unable to compete due {{to the birth of}} Billy Gunn's son, Well Dunn competed against The Heavenly Bodies instead; these matches were unusual, as they pitted heel tag teams against each other. As in 1993, Well Dunn lost more matches than they won in each series, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> occasional victories against established tag teams and were often booked to defeat jobber tag teams.|$|E
5|$|When {{the rebels}} did reach their targets, they {{experienced}} further setbacks. The force of 122 men targeting Zacapa were intercepted and decisively beaten {{by a small}} garrison of 30 Guatemalan soldiers, with only 30 rebels escaping death or capture. The force that attacked Puerto Barrios was dispatched by policemen and armed dockworkers, {{with many of the}} rebels fleeing back to Honduras. In an effort to regain momentum, the rebels attempted to attack the capital with their planes. These attacks caused little material damage, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> a significant psychological impact, leading many citizens to believe that the invasion force was more powerful than it actually was.|$|E

5|$|Although {{gunpowder}} {{was introduced}} to Europe in the 14thcentury, it did not significantly affect castle building until the 15thcentury, when artillery became powerful enough to break through stone walls. While castles continued to be built well into the 16thcentury, new techniques to deal with improved cannon fire made them uncomfortable and undesirable places to live. As a result, true castles went into decline and were replaced by artillery forts with no role in civil administration, and country houses that were indefensible. From the 18thcentury onwards, there was {{a renewed interest in}} castles with the construction of mock castles, part of a romantic revival of Gothic architecture, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> no military purpose.|$|E
5|$|At 05:37 {{an enemy}} contact report was made, and course {{was changed to}} {{starboard}} to close range. Neither ship was in good fighting trim. Hood, designed twenty-five years earlier, lacked adequate decking armour {{and would have to}} close the range quickly, as she would become progressively less vulnerable to plunging shellfire at shorter ranges. She had completed an overhaul in March and her crew had not been adequately retrained. Prince of Wales, with thicker armour, was less vulnerable to 15-inch shells at ranges greater than , but her crew had also not been trained to battle efficiency. The British ships made their last course change at 05:49, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> made their approach too fine (the German ships were only 30 degrees on the starboard bow) and their aft turrets could not fire. Prinz Eugen, with Bismarck , had Prince of Wales and Hood slightly forward of the beam, and both ships could deliver full broadsides.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Russo-Japanese War the sisters were assigned to the 2nd Division of the 2nd Fleet, although Asama was attached to the 4th Division of Rear Admiral Uryū Sotokichi for operations near Seoul, Korea. Just before the war began, the ship escorted Japanese troop convoys to Chemulpo, Seoul's port on the west coast, and helped to sink the two Russian warships stationed there {{on the first day of}} the war. Tokiwa participated in the Battle of Port Arthur that same day, when Vice Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō led the Combined Fleet in an attack on the Russian ships of the Pacific Squadron anchored just outside Port Arthur. Tōgō had expected the earlier surprise night attack by his destroyers to be much more successful than it was, anticipating that the Russians would be badly disorganized and weakened, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack.|$|E
