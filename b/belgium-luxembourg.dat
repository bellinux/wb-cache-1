These two arrangements would go a considerable distance towards calming the tensions over Luxembourg that had flared up during and after the First World War.|$|E
50|$|In 1972, after 50 {{years of}} existence, the <b>Belgium-Luxembourg</b> Economic Union {{was due to}} expire. The two governments decided to renew it every 10 years.

While the treaty of 1921 had established population size as the criterion for dividing up income from excise, the Luxembourgish government demanded a different method of dividing it up, which took more account of the economic realities. A protocol signed on 27 October 1971 tried to satisfy Luxembourgish demands in establishing at regular intervals, a new distribution of excise income.|$|E

50|$|Grand Duchy of Luxembourg {{has long}} been a {{prominent}} supporter of European political and economic integration.

50|$|After World War I, the <b>Belgium-Luxembourg</b> Economic Union {{formed in}} 1921, {{establishing}} a fixed parity between the Belgian franc and Luxembourgian franc, {{which was only}} revised in 1935 and 1944. The success of this union inspired the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, all in exile from World War II in 1944, to meet in London and create the larger Benelux Customs Union. Ratified in The Hague in 1947, the London Customs Convention came into force in 1948 and lasted until 1960 when it was superseded by the stronger Benelux Economic Union, signed in The Hague in 1958. Besides initiating the Benelux Parliament in 1955, the Benelux countries went on to found the European Coal and Steel Community with France, Italy, and West Germany, foreshadowing the modern European Union.|$|E

5000|$|The war brought Belgium and Luxembourg closer together. The <b>Belgium-Luxembourg</b> Economic Union (UEBL) had {{undergone}} several crises between the wars. Henceforth, {{faced with a}} common danger, strong economic and monetary links were created again between the two countries. The Luxembourg state lacked any funds since its gold reserves, entrusted to the National Bank of Belgium in 1938-1939, had fallen into German hands. Belgium therefore used its resources from the Congo to provide the Luxembourgish government with financial assistance. When the Liberation was announced, the two governments prepared to re-establish the UEBL. On 31 August 1944 in London, they agreed to an additional clause which restored parity of the Belgian franc and the Luxembourgish franc. The two partners even aimed to increase their ties by signing the Benelux Treaty with the Netherlands, on 5 September 1944.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} the U.S. entry into World War II, Browning consistently sought a commission in the U.S. Army, but was thwarted by political foes. He finally appealed directly to the Army's adjutant general in Washington, and was commissioned in 1943 with the rank of captain. [...] He attended the School of Military Government in Charlottesville, Virginia, which trained military officers in matters related to governing occupied territories, and was eventually promoted {{to the rank of}} lieutenant colonel. He initially served as deputy head of the <b>Belgium-Luxembourg</b> mission, which aimed to restore civilian government to these areas, and aided in the Allied victory at the Battle of the Bulge in early 1945. In September 1946, Browning was appointed commander of the military government in the Bremen enclave as part of the Allied Occupation of Germany.|$|E
50|$|In {{the gold}} {{standard}} and the Bretton Woods system, the major developed countries mainly implemented fixed exchange rate systems. Due to the devaluation of the pound around the 1970s {{and the collapse of}} the Bretton Woods system, many developed countries switched to floating exchange rates. In 1971, France started to adopt the dual exchange rate system. After that, in 1973, Italy also adopted this system. Both countries maintained these dual exchange rate systems through the early 1970s. The <b>Belgium-Luxembourg</b> Economic Union has been using this system since the early 1990s. Around the same time, many Latin American countries also shifted from a single exchange rate system to a dual exchange rate system or a multiple exchange rate system. With the structural adjustment to international trade that has occurred since the mid-1980s, especially the deepening of trade reform, Latin American countries have begun gradually abandoning multiple exchange rate systems, favoring instead the implementation of single exchange rate systems.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} the {{political}} organisation of the EEC, the Luxembourgish government had constantly opposed a representation of Luxembourg by Belgium (in conformance with the treaty of the <b>Belgium-Luxembourg</b> Economic Union of 1921) and insisted that Luxembourg join the common market as a sovereign state. It finally received what it wanted: it would be fully represented in the Commission. Of the nine seats in the Commission, one seat was allocated to Luxembourg. The Luxembourgish negotiators were convinced that {{the interests of the}} Grand Duchy as a sovereign state were best protected by the Council of Ministers. In these meetings of six, Luxembourg was more likely to get its voice heard. They also argued for a reinforcement of the powers of the Council of Ministers {{at the expense of the}} supranational organs. Luxembourg had only received its recognition as a sovereign state, as a full member of the international community, in the course of the Second World War and at the cost of heavy sacrifice. This explains the government's reticence in renouncing a part of its national prerogatives.|$|E
5000|$|The {{project of}} European {{construction}} {{in which the}} Luxembourgish government had participated throughout the 1950s had modified the relations between Luxembourg and its neighbouring countries, especially Belgium. The creation of a common European market had repercussions for the structures of the <b>Belgium-Luxembourg</b> Economic Union (UEBL), and made it necessary to revise the convention of 1921, long before {{it was due to}} expire in 1972. In the late 1950s, the two partners started negotiations to re-examine the UEBL. On 29 January 1963, three protocols were signed to adapt the UEBL to the new international situation. The agreements were intended to harmonise the two countries' economic policies, especially with regards to agricultural trade and excise duties; to redefine the currency regime and increase the volume of notes printed by the Luxembourgish authorities; and finally to introduce a [...] "Committee of Ministers" [...] similar to the Council of Ministers of the EEC. Through the agreements of 1963, the two partners showed their desire to treat each other as equals within the UEBL.|$|E
5000|$|Luxembourg's {{exit from}} the customs union with Germany brought about a {{profound}} restructuring of the Luxembourgish economy, especially with regards to currency. Until 1918, it was mostly German money that circulated in Luxembourg, while Luxembourgish francs only played a small role. The government took advantage of its {{exit from the}} Zollverein to create a proper national currency, a symbol of its sovereignty. A decree of 11 December 1918 regulated the exchange of the 200 million German marks in circulation, for Luxembourgish francs. This transaction brought about several logistical problems. The printing of new notes did not proceed fast enough, and the exchange rate of 1,25 was considered by some as an unjustified generosity towards investors by the state. The new franc was not backed by any gold reserves, and had no value abroad. The government also had the intention of creating a monetary union with Luxembourg's new economic partner. This partner's currency would be legal tender in the Grand Duchy. The question of currency occupied a central place in the negotiations {{which led to the}} <b>Belgium-Luxembourg</b> Economic Union. In 1921, the Grand Duchy borrowed 175 million Belgian francs.|$|E
50|$|As foreign {{minister}} during the Great war, Hymans {{was successful in}} securing promises from the Allies that amounted to co-belligerency. Britain, France and Russia pledged in the Declaration of Sainte-Adresse in February 1916 that Belgiumn would {{be included in the}} peace negotiations, but it's independence would be restored, and that it would receive a monetary compensation for Germany for the damage. When war began, Hymans also got major promises of relief support from the United States, with the approval of President Wilson. Relief was directed primarily by an American Herbert Hoover and involved several agencies: Commission for Relief in Belgium, American Relief Administration, and Comité National de Secours et d'Alimentation. At the Paris peace conference in 1919, Belgium officially ended its long time neutral status, and became first in line to receive reparations payments from Germany. However, Belgium received only a small bit of German territory, and was rejected in its demands for all of Luxembourg and part of the Netherlands. However, it was given colonial mandates over the German colonies of Rwanda and Burundi. Hymans was the leading spokesman for the small countries at Paris, and became president of the first assembly of the new league of Nations. He Hymans helped form the customs union of Belgium and Luxembourg (<b>Belgium-Luxembourg</b> Economic Union) in 1921 and played a leading part in negotiating the Dawes Plan in 1924. In 1928, he signed the Kellogg-Briand Pact for Belgium.|$|E
5000|$|However, the Luxembourgish {{government}} had to wait several more months before the French revealed their game. On 10 May, the French ambassador informed the Luxembourgish government that his country {{had no intention of}} forming an economic union, and advised it to turn towards Belgium. Having succeeded in concluding a military pact with Belgium, France had no further need of Luxembourg. Since the beginning of the war, the Belgian authorities had shown annexationist tendencies towards the Grand Duchy. In 1917, France renounced any ambitions with regards to Luxembourg, but kept this secret from the Luxembourgish government, in order to conceal the intentions of the French negotiators. After the war, France intended {{to take advantage of the}} Luxembourg question, by obtaining from Belgium the conclusion of a military pact. After the French announcement, the Luxembourgish government re-started negotiations with Belgium. These were slow-going, but resulted on 25 July 1921 in the signing of a treaty on a customs and monetary union between the two countries. The <b>Belgium-Luxembourg</b> Economic Union came into force in March 1922. The treaty stipulated the abolition of customs barriers between the two countries, a common external tariff, a common trade policy led by Belgium and a currency association. The Belgian franc became the common currency, while Luxembourg however retained its right to print Luxembourgish notes. The economic union was never a perfect one, as the treaty did not require the harmonisation of tax systems.|$|E
