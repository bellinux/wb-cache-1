5|$|Construction of Selfe's {{version of}} the Sydney harbour bridge never started due to an {{economic}} slowdown and a change of government at the 1904 state election. Much to Selfe's outrage, the Department of Public Works kept his calculations and drawings, and also copied and printed them. Eventually in 1907, the department contacted Selfe {{and asked him to}} collect his drawings, but refused to return the calculations. Selfe was never given the £1,100 prize, nor was he paid for his subsequent work which he estimated to <b>be</b> <b>worth</b> <b>more</b> than £20,000.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its lack}} of {{commercial}} success {{when it was first}} released, the C5 gained an unexpected degree of cult status in the later years. Collectors began purchasing them as investment items, reselling them for considerably more than their original retail price. One such investor, Adam Harper, bought 600 C5s from a film company as a speculative investment in 1987. He sold all but four within two years, selling them to customers who wanted a novel or more environmentally friendly form of transportation. He also found willing customers among drivers who had been banned from the road, as the C5 did not need a driving licence or vehicle tax. According to Harper, C5s could be resold for as much as £2,500 – more than six times the original retail price. By 1996, a Special Edition C5 in its original box was reported to <b>be</b> <b>worth</b> <b>more</b> than £5,000 to collectors.|$|E
5|$|There {{had been}} coin {{shortages}} beginning in 1959, and the United States Bureau of the Mint expanded production {{to try to}} meet demand. The early 1960s {{was a time of}} increased use of silver both in the coinage and in industry, putting pressure on the price of silver, which was capped at just over $1.29 per ounce by government sales at that price. The silver in a dollar's worth of quarters would <b>be</b> <b>worth</b> <b>more</b> as bullion than as money if the price of the metal rose past $1.38 per ounce, and there was widespread hoarding of silver coins. Demand for the Kennedy half dollar as a collectable drove it from circulation after its debut in 1964. The Bureau of the Mint increased production, helping reduce the coin shortages by May 1965, but government stocks of silver were being rapidly reduced, and threatened to run out by 1968. After extensive study by the Treasury Department, President Lyndon B. Johnson in June 1965 recommended that Congress pass legislation to allow for silverless dimes and quarters, and debased silver half dollars. Although there was some opposition, mainly from legislators representing Western mining states, the bill progressed rapidly through Congress, and was enacted with Johnson's signature on July 23, 1965.|$|E

25|$|Barringer, who in 1894 {{was one of}} {{the investors}} who made $15 million in the Commonwealth silver mine in Pearce, Cochise County, Arizona, had ambitious plans for the iron ore. He {{estimated}} from the size of the crater that the meteorite had a mass of 100 million tons. The current estimate of 300,000 tons for the impactor is only three-tenths of one percent of Barringer's estimate. Iron ore of the type found at the crater was valued at the time at $125/ton, so Barringer was searching for a lode he believed to <b>be</b> <b>worth</b> <b>more</b> than a billion 1903 dollars.|$|E
25|$|These {{sorts of}} {{collections}} are not enjoyed by mainstream collectors and traditional collectors, {{even though they}} themselves may {{have in the past}} or continue to have pieces which could be considered part of an aesthetic collection. One of the issues with this category is that the coins can be seen to have less perceived value to speculators and appraisers. Secondly the coins may be produced artificially, that is coins can be exposed to substances which can create effects similar to those sought for aesthetic collections. This means that coins which may <b>be</b> <b>worth</b> <b>more</b> to historians, numismatists and collectors for their purposes will be destroyed by the process.|$|E

Tom shows Laurence his prize bull and expects him to be impressed, but Laurence nonchalantly tells Tom that he has sold {{a painting of a}} different bull, which Tom has seen and does not like, for three hundred pounds. Tom is angry that a mere picture of a bull should <b>be</b> <b>worth</b> <b>more</b> than his real bull. This and Laurence's condescending attitude give him the urge to strike him. Laurence, running away across the field, is attacked by the bull, but is saved by Tom from serious injury. Tom, looking after Laurence as he recovers, feels no more rancour because he knows that, however valuable Laurence's painting might be, only a real bull like his can attack someone.|$|E

500|$|Four years later, William A. Clark, who {{had made}} a fortune in mining and {{commercial}} ventures in Montana, bought the United Verde properties and, among other improvements, enlarged the smelter. He ordered construction of a narrow gauge railway, the United Verde & Pacific, to Jerome Junction, a railway transfer point [...] to the west. As mining of the ore expanded, Jerome's population grew from 250 in 1890 to more than 2,500 by 1900. By then the United Verde Mine had become the leading copper producer in the Arizona Territory, employing about 800 men, {{and was one of}} the largest mines in the world. Over its 77-year life (1876 to 1953), this mine produced nearly 33 million tons of copper, gold, silver, lead and zinc ore. The metals produced by United Verde and UVX, the other big mine in Jerome, were said to <b>be</b> <b>worth</b> <b>more</b> than $1billion. According to geologists Lon Abbott and Terri Cook, the combined copper deposits of Jerome were among the richest ever found.|$|E
500|$|No {{proposal}} for a gold twenty-dollar piece was considered until after the California Gold Rush, beginning in 1848, greatly increased {{the amount of the}} metal available in the United States. [...] The increase in the supply of gold caused silver coins to <b>be</b> <b>worth</b> <b>more</b> than their face value, and they were heavily exported, generating new support for a gold dollar to take their place in commerce. [...] The massive quantity of gold made a larger denomination desirable as well, to more efficiently convert gold to coins. In January 1849, North Carolina Congressman James Iver McKay amended his previously introduced legislation for a gold dollar to provide for a double eagle as well. [...] He wrote to Mint Director Robert M. Patterson, who responded, [...] "there can be no other objection to the Double eagle except that it is not needed. [...] It will be a handsome coin, between the half dollar and dollar in size." ...|$|E

50|$|If the {{timeshare}} property <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>more</b> than $5,000, you'll need {{a written}} appraisal {{in conformity with}} IRS standards. Publication 561 provides details on the form of written appraisal and the additional paperwork you'll need to attach to your return to secure the deduction. Of course, the danger lies in claiming that your timeshare <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>more</b> than the true market value, i.e. resale value. According to the IRS, “Fair market value is the price at which property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither having to buy or sell, and both having reasonable knowledge of all the relevant facts.” In the depressed timeshare resale market, timeshares <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> far less than what people think they <b>are</b> <b>worth.</b> If you claim your timeshare <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>more</b> than true market value, you could become vulnerable to an IRS audit {{as well as a}} stiff fine.|$|R
