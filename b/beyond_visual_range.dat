5|$|In air combat, the Phantom's {{greatest}} advantage was its thrust, which {{permitted a}} skilled pilot to {{engage and disengage}} from the fight at will. As a massive fighter aircraft designed to fire radar-guided missiles from <b>beyond</b> <b>visual</b> <b>range,</b> it lacked the agility of its Soviet opponents and was subject to adverse yaw during hard maneuvering. Although thus subject to irrecoverable spins during aileron rolls, pilots reported the aircraft to be very communicative and easy to fly {{on the edge of}} its performance envelope. In 1972, the F-4E model was upgraded with leading edge slats on the wing, greatly improving high angle of attack maneuverability at the expense of top speed.|$|E
25|$|Plans {{call for}} 3 or 4 of the 12 {{aircraft}} to be fitted with capability for <b>beyond</b> <b>visual</b> <b>range</b> (BVR) intercept.

25|$|The South African Air Force's Saab JAS 39 Gripen fighter {{aircraft}} are also equipped with PS-05/A pulse-doppler X-band multi-mode radar, developed by Ericsson and GEC-Marconi. This all-weather radar system {{is capable of}} locating and identifying air targets 120km away and surface targets 70km away. It is also able to automatically track multiple targets in {{the upper and lower}} spheres, on the ground and sea or in the air. It can guide several <b>beyond</b> <b>visual</b> <b>range</b> air-to-air missiles to multiple targets simultaneously (although the Air Force still lacks modern <b>beyond</b> <b>visual</b> <b>range</b> missile capability). When deployed operationally on combat missions and air patrols the aircraft can link their systems to the South African National Defence Force's digital network protocol, Link ZA, to share data with other radar systems to help create a wider picture as to the situation in the air and on the ground in order to rapidly adapt to a change in short term situations.|$|E
50|$|The {{ability of}} FPV {{aircraft}} to fly far <b>beyond</b> the <b>visual</b> <b>range</b> {{of the pilot}} and at significant altitudes above the surface has raised some safety concerns regarding risks of collisions with manned aircraft or danger to persons and property on the ground, causing some national aviation authorities to restrict or prohibit FPV flying.|$|R
50|$|World War I was {{the high}} point for the {{military}} use of observation balloons, which were extensively deployed by both sides. Artillery had developed {{to the point where}} it was capable of engaging targets <b>beyond</b> the <b>visual</b> <b>range</b> of a ground-based observer. Positioning artillery observers on balloons, generally a few miles behind the front lines and at altitude, allowed them to see targets at greater range than they could on the ground. This allowed the artillery to take advantage of its increased range.|$|R
50|$|The Academy of Model Aeronautics' (AMA) {{official}} Safety Code's rules (which governs {{flying at}} AMA affiliated fields) allows FPV flight under {{the parameters of}} AMA Document #550, which requires that FPV aircraft be kept within visual line of sight with a spotter maintaining unaided visual contact with the model at all times. Because these restrictions prohibit flying <b>beyond</b> the <b>visual</b> <b>range</b> of the pilot (an ability which many view as the most attractive aspect of FPV), most hobbyists that fly FPV do so outside of regular sanctioned RC clubs' membership and those clubs' flying fields.|$|R
25|$|For much {{of their}} service with the airships, the Sparrowhawks' {{effectiveness}} was greatly hampered by their poor radio equipment, and they were effectively limited to remaining {{within sight of the}} airship. However, in 1934 new direction-finding sets and new voice radios were fitted which allowed operations <b>beyond</b> <b>visual</b> <b>range,</b> exploiting the extended range offered by the belly fuel tanks and allowing the more vulnerable mother ship to stay clear of trouble.|$|E
25|$|An {{advantage}} that the Triple Nickel pilots had over other US aircrews was that eight of their F-4D Phantoms had the top secret APX-80 electronic set installed, {{known by its}} code-name Combat Tree. Combat Tree could read the IFF signals of the transponders built into the MiGs so that North Vietnamese GCI radar could discriminate its aircraft {{from that of the}} Americans. Displayed on a scope in the WSO's cockpit, Combat Tree gave the Phantoms the ability to identify and locate MiGs when they were still <b>beyond</b> <b>visual</b> <b>range.</b>|$|E
25|$|The F-4’s missile {{armament}} {{consisted of}} the AIM-7 Sparrow and the AIM-9 Sidewinder. Although the short-range AIM-9 {{was thought to be}} an effective weapon, the use of the <b>beyond</b> <b>visual</b> <b>range</b> AIM-7 was constrained by Rules of Engagement which in most cases required visual confirmation of a target before firing – essentially defeating any advantage that the missile would have conferred to the American pilots. Both missiles had exhibited reliability problems in 1966 combat, exacerbated by maintenance problems caused by the tropical conditions of Southeast Asia, with the majority failing to ignite, fuse, or guide to the target.|$|E
50|$|The {{prospect}} of a potential third world war featuring large mechanized armies and nuclear weapon strikes led to a degree of specialization along two design approaches: interceptors (like the English Electric Lightning and Sukhoi Su-9) and fighter-bombers (such as the Republic F-105 Thunderchief and the Sukhoi Su-7). Dogfighting, per se, was deemphasized in both cases. The interceptor was {{an outgrowth of the}} vision that guided missiles would completely replace guns and combat would take place at <b>beyond</b> <b>visual</b> <b>ranges.</b> As a result, interceptors were designed with a large missile payload and a powerful radar, sacrificing agility in favour of high speed, altitude ceiling and rate of climb. With a primary air defence role, emphasis was placed on the ability to intercept strategic bombers flying at high altitudes. Specialized point-defence interceptors often had limited range and little, if any, ground-attack capabilities. Fighter-bombers could swing between air superiority and ground-attack roles, and were often designed for a high-speed, low-altitude dash to deliver their ordnance. Television- and IR-guided air-to-surface missiles were introduced to augment traditional gravity bombs, and some were also equipped to deliver a nuclear bomb.|$|R
50|$|World War I was {{the high}} point for the {{military}} use of observation balloons, which were extensively deployed by both sides. The British, despite their experience in late 1800s Africa, were behind developments and were still using spherical balloons. These were quickly replaced by versions, {{commonly referred to as}} kite balloons, which were flyable and could operate in more extreme weather conditions; at first the German Parseval-Siegsfeld type balloon, and then French Caquot type dirigible. By World War I, artillery had developed {{to the point where it}} was capable of engaging targets <b>beyond</b> the <b>visual</b> <b>range</b> of a ground-based observer. Positioning artillery observers on balloons, generally a few miles behind the front lines and at altitude, allowed them to see targets at greater range than they could on the ground.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 157 - 159). The positive classification {{and identification}} of airborne targets <b>beyond</b> the <b>visual</b> <b>range</b> by using the reflected radar signal has become an increasingly valuable capability for the defence force of a country. The rotating structures on an airborne target cause additional Doppler modulation in the return signal, known as the micro-Doppler effect. Information on the rotating structures can be extracted from this effect. A technique based on time- frequency and tomographic analysis is introduced in this research to extract certain helicopter blade parameters which will aid {{in the identification of}} a helicopter. The proposed algorithm shows that (under certain conditions) it is possible to extract the number of main rotor blades, the blade length and the rotation rate of the helicopter's main rotor. These features can be used to determine the make and model of a particular helicopter...|$|R
25|$|The F-4 Phantom II {{had been}} in {{operational}} service with the United States Air Force since 1964. The latest fighter in American service, the F-4 had powerful engines, excellent handling, and an air-to-air configuration of eight air-to-air missiles. However, the Phantom suffered from one critical armament weakness – {{the lack of an}} internal cannon, as its original conception as a fleet defense interceptor dictated that air combat would occur at <b>beyond</b> <b>visual</b> <b>range</b> with radar-guided missiles. It was also a large, heavy fighter, with high wing loadings that degraded its performance in high-G turns, and with engines that tended to produce large amounts of smoke, making it highly visible in combat.|$|E
25|$|However the United Kingdom’s Royal Air Force has an {{enhancement}} programme {{that aims}} to integrate the MBDA Storm Shadow cruise missile, the MBDA Brimstone air-to-surface missile and the Meteor <b>Beyond</b> <b>Visual</b> <b>Range</b> Air-to-Air Missile into its Eurofighter Typhoon force. This programme is known as Project Centurion and has set a target of December 2018 to seamlessly integrate the weapons and capability of the Panavia Tornado GR4 before the Tornados go out of service in 2019. In October 2016, BAE systems confirmed that {{the first phase of}} Project Centurion's package of enhancements had entered the operational evaluation stage. In April 2017, BAE Systems announced six successful firings by the Typhoon in 2016, including a simultaneous firing of two Meteor missiles. Training with Meteor is now due to take place with the UK Royal Air Force later in 2017.|$|E
25|$|The Tornado ADV was {{designed}} {{to serve in the}} role of an interceptor against the threat of Soviet bombers, rather than as an air superiority fighter for engaging in prolonged air combat manoeuvering with various types of enemy fighters. In order to perform its anti-bomber primary mission, it was equipped with long range <b>beyond</b> <b>visual</b> <b>range</b> missiles such as the Skyflash, and later the AMRAAM; the aircraft also had the ability to stay aloft for long periods and remain over the North Sea and Northern Atlantic in order to maintain its airborne patrol. The Ministry of Defence acknowledged the Tornado ADV was not as significantly superior an aircraft to the Phantoms it had replaced in the air-defence role. However, the capability of its weapon systems was a dramatic improvement; in particular the radar and onboard computer facilities. Compared with the Phantom, the ADV had greater acceleration, twice the range and loiter time, and was more capable of operating from short 'austere' air strips.|$|E
40|$|The {{interpretation}} of photographs in oceanographic remote sensing is discussed. The photographs {{were made from}} spacecraft with two exceptions. Two photographs were made from aircraft. There were three types of film {{used to make the}} photographs: black-and-white, color, and color IR. Black and white photography is well known; it presents pictures in various shades of gray from black to white. Color film presents pictures in color, very nearly as the human eye sees them. Color IR film presents pictures in color also but not as seen by the human eye. Blue becomes much deeper blue, green is suppressed to some extent, and red is recorded <b>beyond</b> the <b>visual</b> <b>range</b> of the human eye, out in the near infrared. The most noticeable effect of the use of color IR film is that leaf materials which are highly reflective in the infrared part of the spectrum are presented as red...|$|R
5000|$|In the United States, the Academy of Model Aeronautics' (AMA) Safety Code (which governs {{flying at}} AMA {{affiliated}} fields) allows FPV flight under {{the parameters of}} AMA Document #550, which requires that FPV aircraft be kept within visual line of sight with a spotter maintaining unaided visual contact with the model at all times.

40|$|Chelodina oblonga is a long-necked, {{freshwater}} turtle found predominantly in {{the wetlands}} on the Swan Coastal Plain of Western Australia. Turtles from three populations {{were recorded in}} artificial environments set up to simulate small wetlands. Recordings were undertaken from dawn to midnight. A vocal repertoire of 17 categories was described for these animals with calls consisting of both complex and percussive spectral structures. Vocalizations included clacks, clicks, squawks, hoots, short chirps, high short chirps, medium chirps, long chirps, high calls, cries or wails, hooos, grunts, growls, blow bursts, staccatos, a wild howl, and drum rolling. Also, a sustained vocalization was recorded during the breeding months, consisting of pulse sequences that finished rhythmically. This was hypothesized to function as an acoustic advertisement display. Chelodina oblonga often lives in environments where visibility is restricted due to habitat complexity or poor light transmission due to tannin-staining or turbidity. Thus the use of sound by turtles {{may be an important}} communication medium over distances <b>beyond</b> their <b>visual</b> <b>range.</b> This study reports the first records of an underwater acoustic repertoire in an aquatic chelonian...|$|R
25|$|Throughout the war, an {{arms race}} evolved between the Allies and the Kriegsmarine, {{especially}} in detection and counterdetection. Sonar (ASDIC in Britain) allowed Allied warships to detect submerged U-boats (and vice versa) <b>beyond</b> <b>visual</b> <b>range,</b> but was not effective against a surfaced vessel; thus, early in the war, a U-boat at night or in bad weather was actually safer on the surface. Advancements in radar became particularly deadly for the U-boat crews, especially once aircraft-mounted units were developed. As a countermeasure, U-boats were fitted with radar warning receivers, to give them ample time to dive before the enemy closed in, {{as well as more}} anti aircraft guns. However, by early to mid-1943, the Allies switched to centimetric radar (unknown to Germany), which rendered the radar detectors ineffective. U-boat radar systems were also developed, but many captains chose not to use them for fear of broadcasting their position to enemy patrols and lack of sufficient electronic countermeasures.|$|E
25|$|Early on, the Germans {{experimented with}} the idea of the Schnorchel (snorkel) from {{captured}} Dutch submarines, but saw no need for them until rather late in the war. The Schnorchel was a retractable pipe that supplied air to the diesel engines while submerged at periscope depth, allowing the boats to cruise and recharge their batteries while maintaining a degree of stealth. It was far from a perfect solution, however. Problems occurred with the device's valve sticking shut or closing as it dunked in rough weather; since the system used the entire pressure hull as a buffer, the diesels would instantaneously suck huge volumes of air from the boat's compartments, and the crew often suffered painful ear injuries. Waste disposal was a problem when the U-boats spent extended periods without surfacing, as it is today. Speed was limited to , lest the device snap from stress. The Schnorchel also had the effect of making the boat essentially noisy and deaf in sonar terms. Finally, Allied radar eventually became sufficiently advanced that the Schnorchel mast could be detected <b>beyond</b> <b>visual</b> <b>range.</b>|$|E
500|$|The future Gripen E/F {{will use}} a new active {{electronically}} scanned array (AESA) radar, Raven ES-05, based on the Vixen AESA radar family from Selex ES. [...] Among other improvements, the new radar is to be capable of scanning over a greatly increased field of view and improved range. In addition, the new Gripen integrates the Skyward-G Infra-red search and track (IRST) sensor, which is capable of passively detecting thermal emissions from air and ground targets in the aircraft's vicinity. The sensors of the Gripen E are claimed to be able to detect low radar cross-section (RCS) targets at <b>beyond</b> <b>visual</b> <b>range.</b> Targets are tracked by a [...] "best sensor dominates" [...] system, either by onboard sensors or through the Transmitter Auxiliary Unit (TAU) data link function of the radar.|$|E
50|$|In 1952 - at {{the same}} time that the Military Aeronautics was {{becoming}} independent, ending its links to the Army - the Army Minister Abranches Pinto boosted the activation of this light aviation service, with the acquisition of 22 Piper L-21 Super Cub observation and liaison aircraft and the sending of artillery officers to be trained as pilot-observers at the US Army aviation schools. At the same time, an airfield was built in the grounds of the Army Artillery School at Vendas Novas, to serve as the base for this unit. Eight of the L-21 became permanently based at Vendas Novas, being piloted by the few available pilot-observers of the artillery arm and used in the observation and direction of artillery fire against targets <b>beyond</b> the <b>visual</b> <b>range</b> of the ground observers. The remaining aircraft were only used in large Army maneuvers, when they were piloted by Air Force pilots. By the influence of the US Army aviation doctrine, the concept of Army light aviation evolved and it was anticipated that it would also be equipped with helicopters and it would have other missions beyond the artillery observation.|$|R
40|$|Atmospheric aerosol acts to both {{reduce the}} {{background}} concentration of natural cluster ions, and to attenuate optical propagation. Hence, {{the presence of}} aerosol has two consequences, {{the reduction of the}} air’s electrical conductivity and the <b>visual</b> <b>range.</b> Ion-aerosol theory and Koschmieder’s visibility theory are combined here to derive the related non-linear variation of the atmospheric electric potential gradient with <b>visual</b> <b>range.</b> A substantial sensitivity is found under poor <b>visual</b> <b>range</b> conditions, but, for good <b>visual</b> <b>range</b> conditions the sensitivity diminishes and little influence of local aerosol on the fair weather potential gradient occurs.
