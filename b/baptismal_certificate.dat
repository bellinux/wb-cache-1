25|$|In 1950, Loeb {{repeated}} his <b>baptismal</b> <b>certificate</b> stunt, {{this time on}} the Union Leader front page. He again hoped to dispel gossip about his Jewish heritage, {{this time in the}} wake of controversy surrounding his political endorsements.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} baptismal registers of the Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel and Saint Aloysius {{were destroyed}} during the Spanish Civil War, and no original birth record of Maria Pia de Bragança {{has ever been}} made public. In 1939 the Vicar-General of the Diocese of Madrid-Alcalas issued a <b>baptismal</b> <b>certificate</b> to Maria Pia de Bragança with information provided to him at that time by Don Antonio Goicoechea y Cusculluela, {{a member of the}} Spanish parliament and the Governor of the Bank of Spain, who had reportedly been present at the baptism. Subsequently Maria Pia de Bragança used this <b>baptismal</b> <b>certificate</b> as evidence for her claim to be the recognised daughter of King Carlos.|$|E
25|$|In October 1966 Duarte Nuno petitioned an {{ecclesiastical court}} of the Diocese of Madrid-Alcala to remove the name of King Carlos from the <b>baptismal</b> <b>certificate</b> of Maria Pia de Bragança. Duarte Nuno claimed {{that there was no}} {{evidence}} that King Carlos was the father of Maria Pia. It is unusual for a baptismal registration to record the father of a bastard child. The Roman Ritual instructs the officiating priest only to record the father’s name if the father himself requests it or if he is known to be the father from some public authentic document (Titulus XII, caput II). Clearly King Carlos was not present at Maria Pia's baptism, but Maria Pia claimed that the copy of the document purportedly signed by Carlos granting her the rights of the princes of Portugal was sufficient justification in ecclesiastical law for Carlos to be named her father on her <b>baptismal</b> <b>certificate.</b>|$|E

50|$|The churches {{under his}} {{jurisdiction}} were also ordered quietly by Damaskinos to distribute Christian <b>baptismal</b> <b>certificates</b> to Jews fleeing the Nazis, thus saving thousands of Romaniote Jews {{in and around}} Athens.|$|R
25|$|In 1982 Maria Pia de Bragança filed a {{claim for}} the {{restitution}} of the private real property of the Royal House of Portugal. It {{was rejected by the}} Supreme Tribunal of Justice at Lisbon on 14 April 1983. The Court found that Maria Pia had not established the identity of her father, despite the presentation of the same <b>baptismal</b> <b>certificate</b> presented to the court at the Vatican.|$|E
25|$|Maroto {{was baptized}} in the San Cristóbal parish church, where his <b>baptismal</b> <b>certificate</b> was {{preserved}} and later helped biographers clarify {{details of his}} family. During his childhood, he lived on the Calle Mayor (Main street) of the Barrio de San Cristóbal, across from Plaza de la Estrella. He married Antonia Cortés García, a Chilean, in 1816, and had seven children with her. Antonia {{and two of his}} daughters died in a shipwreck in 1830 en route to Chile.|$|E
25|$|Some sources claim Erauso {{was born}} in 1585 {{including}} her alleged autobiography of 1626. However her <b>baptismal</b> <b>certificate</b> dates her birth in 1592. Her parents were Captain Miguel de Erauso and Maria Pérez de Arce Gallarraga, both {{of whom had been}} born and lived in San Sebastián. Her father was an important military commander of the Basque province under the orders of King Philip III of Spain. From an early age she took part with her father and brothers in the arts of warfare.|$|E
50|$|In {{the spring}} of 1943 he was arrested by the Gestapo for {{harboring}} Jews, specifically for providing Jews with more than 600 <b>baptismal</b> <b>certificates.</b> On March 25, 1944 he was gassed at Majdanek concentration camp near Lublin, Poland.|$|R
50|$|M. Pagnol {{could not}} find any birth <b>certificate,</b> <b>baptismal</b> death <b>certificate</b> in the Jersey archives. He {{therefore}} concluded that James was not born on the island, {{and that he did}} not belong to the Carteret family.|$|R
50|$|Archbishop Damaskinos - Archbishop of Athens {{during the}} German occupation. He {{formally}} protested the deportation of Jews and quietly ordered churches under his jurisdiction to issue fake Christian <b>baptismal</b> <b>certificates</b> to Jews fleeing the Nazis. Thousands of Greek Jews {{in and around}} Athens were thus able to claim that they were Christian and were thus saved.|$|R
25|$|Loeb {{partnered with}} his friend Charlie Weaver to buy the St. Albans Messenger in St. Albans, Vermont, in 1941 to enter the {{publishing}} arena. Loeb also received cash investments from a woman named Marka Loening, who indulged in an extramarital affair with Loeb while waiting for her divorce from her estranged husband to be finalized. Loeb later used funding from Loening to buy the Burlington Daily News in 1942. One of Loeb's first infamous journalistic exploits was the publishing of his own <b>baptismal</b> <b>certificate</b> {{on the front page}} of both Vermont papers in an attempt to disprove rumors of his Jewish ancestry.|$|E
25|$|In February 1972 {{the case}} between Duarte Nuno and Maria Pia de Bragança {{moved up to}} the Sacred Roman Rota, the normal appeal court for the Roman Catholic Church. On December 6, 1972 the court {{dismissed}} the claim, {{on the grounds that}} D. Duarte Nuno did not have legal standing in the case, being only the second cousin twice removed of King Carlos. The court did not address the primary question of whether there was sufficient evidence for Carlos being Maria Pia’s father and thus named as such on the <b>baptismal</b> <b>certificate.</b> It did, however, question the necessity of changing a certificate which was over sixty years old.|$|E
25|$|Porfirio Díaz was {{the sixth}} of seven children, baptized on 15 September 1830, in Oaxaca, Mexico, but his actual {{date of birth}} is unknown. September 15 is an {{important}} date in Mexican history, {{the eve of the}} day when hero of independence Miguel Hidalgo issued his call for independence in 1810; when Díaz became president, the independence anniversary was commemorated on September 15 rather than the 16th, a practice that continues to the present era. Díaz was a castizo. His mother, Petrona Mori (or Mory) was the daughter of a man whose father had immigrated from Spain and Tecla Cortés, an indigenous woman; Díaz's father was a Criollo. There is confusion about his father's name, which is listed on the <b>baptismal</b> <b>certificate</b> as José de la Cruz Díaz, but is also known as José Faustino Díaz, who was a modest innkeeper and died of cholera when his son was three.|$|E
50|$|Jews of Międzyrzecz were {{provided}} with fake <b>baptismal</b> <b>certificates</b> by Rev. Albin Horba until the final liquidation of the ghetto. He was transferred to local parish in May 1942 after sheltering several prominent Jews in Świsłocz. When the Red Army rolled into the city, Horba was arrested by the Soviet secret police, and held in prison until April 1948.|$|R

5000|$|Clauses in the 3 April 1949 Armistice Agreements {{specified}} that Israelis would {{have access to}} the religious sites in East Jerusalem. However, Jordan refused to implement this clause arguing that Israel's refusal to permit the return of Palestinians to their homes in West Jerusalem voided that clause in the agreement. Tourists entering East Jerusalem had to present <b>baptismal</b> <b>certificates</b> or other proof they were not Jewish.|$|R
25|$|There are no {{original}} documents to support Maria Pia's {{claims to be}} both a daughter of Carlos I and an heir to the Dukedom of Braganca and pretense to the throne of Portugal. Maria Pia's <b>baptismal</b> <b>certificate</b> from 1907 was destroyed and {{there is only a}} copy of the document in which Carlos I supposedly granted succession rights to Maria Pia. Nonetheless, there exist some records concerning a relationship between Maria Pia's mother Maria Amelia Laredó e Murça and King Carlos I. A biography of Infanta Eulalia of Spain purports to reveal some letters of the Portuguese King and also reveals the existence of Maria Pia de Bragança as King Carlos I's bastard daughter. King Alfonso XIII of Spain and his son Infante Jaime, Duke of Segovia seem to have had an ongoing friendship with Maria Pia; her supporters have interpreted this relationship as an affirmation on the part of Alfonso and Jaime de Borbón that they recognised Maria Pia de Bragança as Carlos's bastard daughter. In fact, most of the letters cited by Maria Pia in support of her claim were simply courteous replies by royals to her numerous queries and salutations.|$|E
500|$|Eva's autobiography, La Razón de mi Vida, {{contains}} no dates or references to childhood occurrences, {{and does not}} list the location of her birth or her name at birth. According to Junín's civil registry, a birth certificate shows that one María Eva Duarte was born on 7 May 1922. Her <b>baptismal</b> <b>certificate,</b> however, lists the date of birth as 7 May 1919 under the name Eva María Ibarguren. It is thought [...] that in 1945 the adult Eva Perón created a forgery of her birth certificate for her marriage.|$|E
500|$|Information about Thorpe's birth, {{name and}} ethnic {{background}} varies widely. He was baptized [...] "Jacobus Franciscus Thorpe" [...] in the Catholic Church. [...] Thorpe {{was born in}} Indian Territory, but no birth certificate has been found. [...] He was generally considered {{to have been born}} on May 22, 1887, near the town of Prague, Oklahoma. Thorpe himself said in a note to The Shawnee News-Star in 1943 that he was born May 28, 1888, [...] "near and south of Bellemont – Pottawatomie County – {{along the banks of the}} North Fork River... hope this will clear up the inquiries as to my birthplace." [...] However, most biographers believe that he was born on May 22, 1887, as that is what is listed on his <b>baptismal</b> <b>certificate.</b> [...] Bellemont was a small community, now disappeared, on the line between Pottawatomie and Lincoln Counties. Thorpe referred to Shawnee as his birthplace in the 1943 note.|$|E
50|$|After the Fall of France in 1940, Jews began {{approaching}} the house asking for <b>baptismal</b> <b>certificates,</b> which Father Dimitri would provide them. Many Jews {{came to stay}} with them. They provided shelter and helped many to flee the country. Eventually the house was closed down. Mother Maria, Fr. Dimitri, Yuri and Sophia were all arrested by the Gestapo. Fr. Dimitri and Yuri both died at the Dora concentration camp.|$|R
50|$|The film {{is based}} on a memoir written by Adolf Burger, a Jewish Slovak {{typographer}} who was imprisoned in 1942 for forging <b>baptismal</b> <b>certificates</b> to save Jews from deportation, and was later interned at Sachsenhausen to work on Operation Bernhard. Ruzowitsky consulted closely with Burger through almost every stage of the writing and production. The film won the 2007 Best Foreign Language Film Oscar at the 80th Academy Awards.|$|R
50|$|Fraktur {{drawings}} {{were executed}} in ink and/or watercolors and {{are found in}} a wide variety of forms: the Vorschriften (writing samples), the Taufscheine (birth and <b>baptismal</b> <b>certificates),</b> marriage and house blessings, book plates, and floral and figurative scenes. The earlier Fraktur were executed entirely by hand, while printed text became increasingly common in later examples. Common artistic motifs in Fraktur include birds (distelfinks), hearts, and tulips, as well as blackletter (Fraktur) and italic calligraphy.|$|R
2500|$|Cohan {{was born}} in 1878 in Providence, Rhode Island, to Irish Catholic parents. A <b>baptismal</b> <b>certificate</b> from St. Joseph's Roman Catholic Church (which gave the wrong first name for his mother) {{indicated}} that he was born on July 3, but Cohan and his family always insisted that George had been [...] "born on the Fourth of July!" [...] George's parents were traveling vaudeville performers, and he joined them on stage while still an infant, first as a prop, learning to dance and sing soon after he could walk and talk.|$|E
2500|$|Maria Pia de Bragança {{also claimed}} {{that in the}} {{archives}} of the Diocese of Madrid-Alcalá there was a copy of a document signed by King Carlos 14 March 1907 in which he recognised Maria Pia de Bragança as his daughter and that [...] "she may be called by my name and enjoy from now on the use of this name with the honours, prerogatives, rank, obligations and advantages of the princes of the House of Braganza of Portugal". Like the <b>baptismal</b> <b>certificate,</b> the original of this document did not survive.|$|E
2500|$|Pius later {{engineered}} an agreement—formally {{approved on}} 23 June 1939—with Brazilian President Getúlio Vargas to issue 3,000 visas to [...] "non-Aryan Catholics". However, {{over the next}} 18 months Brazil's Conselho de Imigração e Colonização (CIC) continued to tighten the restrictions on their issuance, including requiring a <b>baptismal</b> <b>certificate</b> dated before 1933, a substantial monetary transfer to the Banco do Brasil, and approval by the Brazilian Propaganda Office in Berlin. The program was cancelled 14 months later, after fewer than 1,000 visas had been issued, amid suspicions of [...] "improper conduct" [...] (i.e., continuing to practice Judaism) among those who had received visas.|$|E
50|$|Filipinos {{may have}} one or more {{official}} given names (as registered in their birth <b>certificates</b> and <b>baptismal</b> <b>certificates)</b> and various types of temporary or permanent nicknames. Filipinos have a penchant for giving themselves or each other various sorts of nicknames and monikers. Some nicknames are carried for life while others are used only with certain groups so a person can have multiple nicknames at different ages or among different groups of people.|$|R
50|$|Documents {{other than}} those listed above, {{including}} Canadian passports, are not considered as proof of citizenship, but a passport is issued only after review of other documentary proof, as noted above. Church-issued <b>baptismal</b> <b>certificates</b> and birth certificates issued by an authority other than a provincial or territorial government are also not proof of Canadian citizenship. Such certificates were common in Quebec, as the provincial government did not start to issue birth certificates until 1994.|$|R
5000|$|According to the Raoul Wallenberg Foundation, Roncalli {{forwarded}} {{a request}} for the Vatican to inquire whether other neutral countries could grant asylum to Jews, to inform the German government that the Palestine Jewish Agency had 5,000 immigration certificates available and to ask Vatican Radio to broadcast that helping Jews {{was an act of}} mercy approved by the Church. In 1944, Roncalli used diplomatic couriers, papal representatives and the Sisters of Our Lady of Zion to transport and issue <b>baptismal</b> <b>certificates,</b> immigration certificates and visas - many of them forged - to Hungarian Jews. A dispatch dated Aug. 16, 1944 from Roncalli to the papal nuncio to Hungary illustrates the intensity of [...] "Operation Baptism".|$|R
2500|$|Had the Roman Rota {{found in}} favour of Duarte Nuno, his {{supporters}} could {{have said that the}} court had determined that Carlos was not Maria Pia’s father. Since the court found against Duarte Nuno, the supporters of Maria Pia de Bragança were able to say that the court had affirmed the validity of her <b>baptismal</b> <b>certificate</b> and therefore the validity of her claimed parentage – neither of which in fact actually occurred. The court found only that Duarte Nuno did not have the legal standing to bring such a case: [...] "Patres Auditores de Turno ... decreverunt negative, seu non constare de legitimatione actoris ad causam".|$|E
2500|$|In 1968, James Earl Ray, {{the man who}} assassinated Martin Luther King, Jr., used a Canadian passport, {{which was}} {{obtained}} with a forged <b>baptismal</b> <b>certificate</b> {{in the name of}} [...] "Ramon George Sneyd", to temporarily escape capture following his completed assassination. He was in possession of two Canadian passports {{at the time of his}} arrest at London Heathrow Airport. Before Ray's arrest, he was able to turn his passport in, which has incorrectly spelled his fake last name as [...] "Sneya", to the Canadian Embassy in Portugal, for a replacement under his correct alias. The arrest of Ray triggered an investigation launched by the Royal Commission on Security in 1969, which recommended much more stringent application requirements and the establishment of Passport Canada offices.|$|E
2500|$|On 16 June 1940, the Spanish Boletín Oficial del Estado ("Official State Bulletin") {{records that}} Escrivá {{requested}} {{of the government}} that he be permitted to change his [...] "first surname {{so that it will}} be written Escrivá de Balaguer". He justified the petition on the grounds that [...] "the name Escrivá is common in the east coast and in Catalonia, leading to harmful and annoying confusion". [...] On 20 June 1943, when he was 41 years old, the registry book of the Barbastro cathedral and the <b>baptismal</b> <b>certificate</b> of José María were annotated to represent [...] "that the surname Escriba was changed to Escrivá de Balaguer". [...] Balaguer {{is the name of the}} town in Catalonia from which Escrivá's paternal family derived.|$|E
50|$|When Elek and Ferenc {{escape from}} the labor forces, they find their way back home and {{discover}} their families have been sent away. Elek's home has been ransacked, and he finds the <b>baptismal</b> <b>certificates</b> taped {{to the back of}} a family photo that he saves. Horty secretly negotiates with Stalin for Hungary's surrender to the Allies, but the Nazis learn of this and he is overthrown. In his place the Hungarian fascist Arrow Cross Party assumes power, and their militia help the Nazis rounding up Jews.|$|R
50|$|When the Nazi {{presence}} and anti-Semitic laws increase in Budapest, Jewish radio repair shop owner Jozsef (Simon Kunz) sends home {{the two young}} men who work for him, Elek Cohen (Jonas Armstrong) and Ferenc Jacobson (Mark Wells). They obtain forged <b>baptismal</b> <b>certificates</b> from a Catholic priest and urge their families to use them to escape Hungary when they themselves are forced to join the Hungarian labor service, in which Jewish men are brutally treated, shot if they cannot keep up or are injured while doing work.|$|R
5000|$|The protests at St. Basil's {{continued}} into the fall of 1970. In September 1970, a group of Chicano protesters gathered at St. Basil's for an outdoor religious service on the church steps in which the participants burned their <b>baptismal</b> <b>certificates,</b> an act intended as [...] "an expression of frustration in dealing with church authorities in discussing Mexican-American problems". On viewing the Sunday protest, one female parishioner {{was said to have}} been heard saying, [...] "Why doesn't someone push them (the demonstrators) down the steps?" [...] However, the protest was peaceful and ended without violence.|$|R
