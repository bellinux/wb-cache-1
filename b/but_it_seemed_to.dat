25|$|Of this {{head and}} two other pieces of {{sculpture}} exhibited by Brâncuși in July, 1913, at the Allied Artists' Exhibition in London, Roger Fry said in The Nation, August 2: Constantin Brâncuși's sculptures have not, I think, been seen before in England. His three heads are the most remarkable works of sculpture at the Albert Hall. Two are in brass and one in stone. They show a technical skill which is almost disquieting, a skill which might lead him, in default of any overpowering imaginative purpose, to become a brilliant pasticheur. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> me there was evidence of passionate conviction; that the simplification of forms was no mere exercise in plastic design, but a real interpretation of the rhythm of life. These abstract vivid forms into which he compresses his heads give a vivid presentment of character; they are not empty abstractions, but filled with a content which has been clearly, and passionately apprehended.|$|E
500|$|The first {{plans for}} making the small River Frome, {{also known as the}} Stroudwater, navigable date back to the last three years of the 17th century. The plan was to serve the woollen industry, by {{carrying}} coal from the Severn to Stroud and transporting the finished cloth away to markets, but it was opposed by mill owners, and it came to nothing. The idea was revived in 1728, when John Hore, who had previously succeeded in making the River Kennett navigable, suggested a canal around [...] long, with 12 locks, suitable for 60-ton barges. An Act of Parliament was obtained in 1730, with support from those who worked in the cloth industry, but opposition from some of the millers, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> ignore Hore's recommendations, in that it was again based on making the river navigable. As the millers were given powers which would have effectively shut the navigation for two months each year, and the tolls were set at a level which would have discouraged traffic, no further action was taken.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{positive}} assessments, [...] "Space Race: Part II" [...] {{produced more}} variety within critical opinion. In his [...] "commendable" [...] 8.6 {{out of ten}} rating review, Ross Bonaime of Paste asserted that the program displayed some exceptional dimension into the characters—from Lana's apparent self-consciousness, to Cheryl's eccentric and [...] "odd" [...] persona, and Krieger's past. Ultimately, Bonaime professed that [...] "Space Race: Part II" [...] was slightly inferior to its predecessor; [...] "'Space Race, Part II' doesn’t {{have some of the}} big laughs that the first part featured. By that, I mean Archer never rode Cyril through waves of Lana’s puke joyously. It is a step down from the first part comedically, but the episode does give us a few fun moments for each member of the cast." [...] Analogous sentiments were echoed by Blair Marnell of CraveOnline, who concluded: [...] "The space adventure had some fun moments, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> lack the punch provided by the two episodes that proceeded it. Even though it was good to see Barry again this season, his appearance in this episode seemed pretty tacked on." [...] VanDerWerff affirmed that the episode was a superb conclusion to Archer third season, despite not being as [...] "relentlessly entertaining" [...] as [...] "Space Race: Part I". While deeming the episode as a hilarious finale, TV Overmind writer Kevin Fitzpatrick claimed that [...] "Space Race: Part II" [...] left many unanswered questions to the audience. Conversely, Eric Hochberger of TV Fanatic applauded the episode, issuing it a 4.7 out of 5 stars. [...] "Archer ended its third season tonight with the conclusion to its two part episode, 'Space Race'. And, man, from the second Archer announced he left his light saber in his other space pants, you knew you were in for a solid ending." ...|$|E

2500|$|Before Wecht's trial, the {{prosecution}} moved to dismiss 43 of the 84 counts without prejudice. The judge rejected the motion and dismissed the 43 charges with prejudice, which permanently bars {{the revival of}} the charges. Wecht's defense counsel argued that his prosecution was politically motivated. The initial indictment was announced in early 2006, before the November 2006 elections. During the trial, the judge barred the defense from arguing that the case was politically motivated. Although discussions about possible political motivations were not allowed during the trial, the jury foreman told reporters after the trial that some jurors began to see {{the prosecution}} as [...] "political"."I don't know if politically motivated or not, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> me that the motivations were certainly less than pure. There was something behind it other than seeking justice." ...|$|E

[...] The texts from Renna (an employee of Kelly) to Sheridan (who had worked on the re-election campaign) came to light in court filings by Baroni's attorneys on August 10, 2016, to which Christie responded, [...] "I absolutely dispute it. It’s ridiculous. It’s nothing new." [...] At the federal trial, Renna walked back her comments, testifying, [...] "I had no knowledge of whether the governor was lying or not. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> contradict what I had been told." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1951, Hughes {{initially}} studied English at Pembroke College under M.J.C. Hodgart, {{an authority}} on balladic forms. Hughes felt encouraged and supported by Hodgart's supervision, but attended few lectures and wrote no more poetry at this time, feeling stifled by literary academia and the [...] "terrible, suffocating, maternal octopus" [...] of literary tradition. He wrote, [...] "I might say, that I had as much talent for Leavis-style dismantling of texts as anyone else, I even had a special bent for it, nearly a sadistic streak there, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> me not only a foolish game, but deeply destructive of myself." [...] In his third year, he transferred to anthropology and archaeology, both of which would later inform his poetry. He did not excel as a scholar. His first published poetry appeared in Chequer. A poem [...] "The little boys and the seasons", written during this time, was published in Granta, under the pseudonym Daniel Hearing.|$|E
2500|$|In 1929 {{the first}} edition of the FIDE laws of chess {{required}} thirty moves to be played before a draw by agreement. [...] This rule was discarded when the rules were revised in 1952. [...] In 1954 FIDE rejected a request to reinstate the rule, but it did state that it is unethical and unsportsmanlike to agree to a draw before a serious contest had begun. [...] FIDE stated that the director should discipline players who repeatedly disrespect this guideline, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> have no effect on players. [...] In 1962 FIDE reinstated a version of the rule against draws by agreement in fewer than thirty moves, with the director allowing them in exceptional circumstances. [...] FIDE had the intention of enforcing the rule and the penalty was a loss of the game by both players. [...] However, players ignored it or got around it by intentional threefold repetition. [...] Directors were unable or unwilling to enforce the rule. In 1963 FIDE made another attempt to strengthen the rule. [...] Draws by agreement before thirty moves were forbidden, and the penalty was forfeit by both players. [...] Directors were to investigate draws by repetition of position to see if they were to circumvent the rule. [...] The rule was dropped in 1964 because it was decided that it had not encouraged aggressive play , [...]|$|E
