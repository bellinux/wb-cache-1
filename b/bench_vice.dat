50|$|On hacksaws, as {{with most}} frame saws, the blade can be mounted with the teeth facing toward or away from the handle, {{resulting}} in cutting action on either the push or pull stroke. In normal use, cutting vertically downwards with work held in a <b>bench</b> <b>vice,</b> hacksaw blades should be set to be facing forwards. Some frame saws, including Fret Saws and Piercing Saws, have their blades set to be facing the handle because {{they are used to}} cut by being pulled down against a horizontal surface.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Bandung State Polytechnic for Manufacturing (POLMAN), as an {{institution}} of vocational high education, implements certain portion of practical program in its workshop that aimed to build students skill competencies. For those, product media are created from structured exercises and combined with external inquiries from collaboration with industrial parties, through a system called Production Based Education (PBE). Completing the ‘job shop ’ products that students are doing daily, <b>Bench</b> <b>Vice</b> as one of standard product in Polman is treated as ‘batch product ’ due to its appropriated characteristic. The idea of Material Requirements Planning (MRP) method for <b>Bench</b> <b>Vice</b> handling is implemented {{in order to get}} most beneficial either for students, lecturers and institution. Since the common MRP and other control functions influence each other related with capacity and schedule, simplified MRP for <b>Bench</b> <b>Vice</b> is developed as a learning media for all involved parties in organization...|$|E

5000|$|An engineer's vice {{is bolted}} {{onto the top}} surface of a workbench, {{with the face of}} the fixed jaws just forward of its front edge. The vice may include other {{features}} such as a small anvil on the back of its body. Most engineer's vices have a swivel base. Some engineer's vices marketed as [...] "Homeowner Grade" [...] are not made of steel or cast iron, but of pot metal or a very low grade of iron, typically with a tensile strength of under 10 ksi. Most homeowner's <b>bench</b> <b>vices</b> have an exposed screw.|$|R
40|$|Abstract This devise {{addresses}} the inadequacies {{of providing a}} quick means of holding jobs of irregular shapes such as are encountered in small scale fabrication workshops. The conventional bench vise often does not provide the adequate grip for such shapes so that attachments {{in the form of}} V blocks are usually provided to enhance the grip before drilling operations are carried out. This versatile work holding device enables fabricators to perform drilling and other production operations on a work piece. This device produced from mild steel plates uses the toggle principle to provide rapid grip. Comparative tests on time span in the use of this device and the <b>bench</b> <b>vice</b> for job set up, production operation and then disassembly showed that time is gained with use of the device...|$|E

As the school moved to a new building, a team of volunteers spent two days in the old school gathering furniture and equipment to be shipped to Africa. Amongst the items donated were: 220 chairs, 51 desks, 76 exam tables, 4 stationery cupboards, 4 filing cabinets, 12 four-seater dining tables, 4 LCD projectors, 3000 text books, 13 boxes of lab equipment, kitchen equipment, 12 sewing machines, 4 woodwork <b>benches</b> with <b>vices,</b> carpentry machinery and tools and 60 computers.|$|R
60|$|The little counting-house {{reserved}} {{for his own}} occupation, was a room of wood and glass {{at the end of}} a long low workshop, filled with <b>benches,</b> and <b>vices,</b> and tools, and straps, and wheels; which, when they were in gear with the steam-engine, went tearing round as though they had a suicidal mission to grind the business to dust and tear the factory to pieces. A communication of great trap-doors in the floor and roof with the workshop above and the workshop below, made a shaft of light in this perspective, which brought to Clennam's mind the child's old picture-book, where similar rays were the witnesses of Abel's murder. The noises were sufficiently removed and shut out from the counting-house to blend into a busy hum, interspersed with periodical clinks and thumps. The patient figures at work were swarthy with the filings of iron and steel that danced on every bench and bubbled up through every chink in the planking. The workshop was arrived at by a step-ladder from the outer yard below, where it served as a shelter for the large grindstone where tools were sharpened. The whole had at once a fanciful and practical air in Clennam's eyes, which was a welcome change; and, as often as he raised them from his first work of getting the array of business documents into perfect order, he glanced at these things with a feeling of pleasure in his pursuit that was new to him.|$|R
60|$|The hilly {{country in}} the middle of the north edge of Sussex, looking very {{pleasant}} on a fine evening at the end of September, is seen through the windows of a room which has been built so as to resemble the after part of an old-fashioned high-pooped ship, with a stern gallery; for the windows are ship built with heavy timbering, and run right across the room as continuously as the stability of the wall allows. A row of lockers under the windows provides an unupholstered windowseat interrupted by twin glass doors, respectively halfway between the stern post and the sides. Another door strains the illusion a little by being apparently in the ship's port side, and yet leading, not to the open sea, but to the entrance hall of the house. Between this door and the stern gallery are bookshelves. There are electric light switches beside the door leading to the hall and the glass doors in the stern gallery. Against the starboard wall is a carpenter's <b>bench.</b> The <b>vice</b> has a board in its jaws; and the floor is littered with shavings, overflowing from a waste-paper basket. A couple of planes and a centrebit are on the bench. In the same wall, between the bench and the windows, is a narrow doorway with a half door, above which a glimpse of the room beyond shows that it is a shelved pantry with bottles and kitchen crockery.|$|R
60|$|In a dentist's {{operating}} room on a fine August morning in 1896. Not the usual tiny London den, {{but the best}} sitting room of a furnished lodging in a terrace on the sea front at a fashionable watering place. The operating chair, with a gas pump and cylinder beside it, is half way between {{the centre of the}} room and one of the corners. If you look into the room through the window which lights it, you will see the fireplace {{in the middle of the}} wall opposite you, with the door beside it to your left; an M.R.C.S. diploma in a frame hung on the chimneypiece; an easy chair covered in black leather on the hearth; a neat stool and <b>bench,</b> with <b>vice,</b> tools, and a mortar and pestle in the corner to the right. Near this bench stands a slender machine like a whip provided with a stand, a pedal, and an exaggerated winch. Recognising this as a dental drill, you shudder and look away to your left, where you can see another window, underneath which stands a writing table, with a blotter and a diary on it, and a chair. Next the writing table, towards the door, is a leather covered sofa. The opposite wall, close on your right, is occupied mostly by a bookcase. The operating chair is under your nose, facing you, with the cabinet of instruments handy to it on your left. You observe that the professional furniture and apparatus are new, and that the wall paper, designed, with the taste of an undertaker, in festoons and urns, the carpet with its symmetrical plans of rich, cabbagy nosegays, the glass gasalier with lustres; the ornamental gilt rimmed blue candlesticks on the ends of the mantelshelf, also glass- draped with lustres, and the ormolu clock under a glass-cover in the middle between them, its uselessness emphasized by a cheap American clock disrespectfully placed beside it and now indicating 12 o'clock noon, all combine with the black marble which gives the fireplace the air of a miniature family vault, to suggest early Victorian commercial respectability, belief in money, Bible fetichism, fear of hell always at war with fear of poverty, instinctive horror of the passionate character of art, love and Roman Catholic religion, and all the first fruits of plutocracy in the early generations of the industrial revolution.|$|R
5000|$|... 'Boat {{building}} uses many or {{the same}} tools that are common house tools such as hammers, cross cut saws, power drills, <b>benches</b> and <b>vices.</b> For building small boats under 5m some specialized tools are needed such as clamps (cramps) either G clamps or spring clamps. A minimum of 4 6inch(150mm) and 10 4inch(100mm) G clamps, plus 20 2 inch(50mm) steel spring clamps is need for ply on frame designs. More is better with clamps. Flat and round surform rasps are useful tools for shaping wood and ply. A drill set from 2-10mm, several speedbore drills for larger holes 12-25mm, (1/2inch-1 inch) rotary sanding backing pads {{and a range of}} replacement sanding pads from coarse (40grit) to fine (180grit), counter sinking drills for screws, a right angle set square, a set of manual screw drivers with blades to match screws being used are essential. A heavy craft knife, an 8m(25 ft) tape, flat and round files for metal and wood, a short(torpedo) level and a set of 3 chisels from 6 to 25mm are needed. Power tools make a job much easier and are relatively cheap. An 7 1/4inch (185mm) circular saw with a fine 40 tooth tungsten carbide blade, a jigsaw with a dust blower with a set of fine, medium and coarse tooth metal and wood blades is good for cutting plywood panels to shape, a rotary oscillating sander with medium and fine pads and a cordless drill for driving screws all save time and energy. A steam box is excellent for making planks easier to bend although hot wet rags are a messy, but easy substitute. A fine tooth hacksaw is not only essential for cutting metal such as trimming stainless steel bolts to the correct length but is handy for ultra-fine cuts in thin wood. A fine-tooth tenon saw is used to cut across the grain to produce a reasonably fine, accurate cut. Some boat builders have started using Japanese draw saws for fine cuts but while these are excellent they tend to be very expensive. A No 4 smoothing plane is essential but an electric plane is very useful (but extremely loud) for making rudder blades and centre boards. A much longer No. 7 plane is needed if the design calls for a wooden spars as used in many modern [...] "traditional" [...] yachts.|$|R
5000|$|... "Today is {{the first}} day I'm living as a former Rossonero after ten years. I wanted to ... say goodbye to all the Milan fans who in these years were close to me and with whom I have shared joys and bitterness, despite winning everything. A big thank you to Silvio Berlusconi, Adriano Galliani and Sporting Director Ariedo Braida: without them I could never have had such a gratifying {{experience}} both from a sporting and human point of view. There are many people I'd like to thank: all the teammates I've had, Milan's managers and co-workers, the Milanello staff. But I especially want to cite Carlo Ancelotti, the coach who allowed me to play in this fantastic team and with whom I spent the biggest part of my Rossoneri life, and Villiam Vecchi, who endured me for all these years. ... Thanks from the heart and Forza Milan!" [...] —Dida in his goodbye letter to Milan, 1 July 2010 [...] "I played with Iker Casillas for four years at Real Madrid, but for me Dida is the best goalkeeper. We played together and won together at AC Milan and for the Brazil national team. He is an unbelievable keeper." [...] —Kaká Dida retained the starting spot on the back of strong league performances despite Storari returning to fitness, such as a stoppage-time save from Pablo Granoche in a 25 October 2-1 win over Chievo, and double and triple saves performed minutes apart in a 2-2 draw at Napoli on 28 October. Dida kept four clean sheets and conceded an average of one goal per game as Milan enjoyed an eight-match unbeaten league run in that stretch that ended in a 2-0 loss to Palermo on 13 December. With Dida retaining the number-one jersey into 2010 and Abbiati returning from injury, Storari was loaned to Sampdoria on 15 January. However, after Abbiati returned for his first match in ten months on 31 January, a 1-1 draw with Livorno that Dida missed due to a back injury, both keepers were subsequently juggled {{in and out of the}} starting lineup due to Leonardo's difficulty in establishing a definite number one, until Abbiati's heroics in Milan's 2-0 win over Bari on 21 February relegated Dida to the <b>bench.</b> Milan <b>vice</b> president Adriano Galliani publicly insisted that a duel between the keepers did not exist and it was Leonardo's choice whom to play. After Abbiati was sidelined with tendinitis on 28 March, Dida started for the rest of the season, finishing with his most Serie A appearances (23) in four years. On 1 May, he played his 300th match in all competitions for Milan in a 1-0 win over Fiorentina. He was substituted for Abbiati in the 88th minute of the Rossoneri's 3-0 season-finale defeat of Juventus on 15 May, receiving a standing ovation as he departed. His final games in a Milan uniform were postseason friendlies against Major League Soccer (MLS) teams Chicago Fire and Montreal Impact. On 30 June 2010, Dida's contract expired, officially ending his decade-long tenure with the club. He finished with the currently sixth-highest number of Champions League clean sheets (34) and the second-highest percentage of clean sheets in games played (49%, behind Edwin Van der Sar's 52%), in addition to the fourth-highest unbeaten mark (623 minutes) in Champions League history.|$|R
