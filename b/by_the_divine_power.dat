6000|$|But {{perhaps the}} ruling, though not {{altogether}} conscious motive of Pierre in finally declining--as he did--the services of Messrs. Wonder and Wen, those eager applicants {{for the privilege}} of extending and solidifying his fame, arose from the idea that being at this time not very far advanced in years, the probability was, that his future productions might at least equal, if not surpass, in some small degree, those already given to the world. He resolved to wait for his literary canonization until he should at least have outgrown the sophomorean insinuation of the Law; which, with a singular affectation of benignity, pronounced him an [...] "infant." [...] His modesty obscured from him the circumstance, that the greatest lettered celebrities of the time, had, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>divine</b> <b>power</b> of genius, become full graduates in the University of Fame, while yet as legal minors forced to go to their mammas for pennies wherewith to keep them in peanuts.|$|E
6000|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>divine</b> <b>power</b> of poetry, therefore, {{which is}} irresistible with the lovely sex, did I subdue {{the heart of}} this fair little haberdasher. We carried on a sentimental {{correspondence}} for a time across the counter, and I supplied her with rhyme by the stockingful. At length I prevailed on her to grant me an assignation. But how was it to be effected? Her father kept her always under his eye; she never walked out alone; and the house was locked up the moment that the shop was shut. All these difficulties served but to give zest to the adventure. I proposed that the assignation should be in her own chamber, into which I would climb at night. The plan was irresistible. A cruel father, a secret lover, and a clandestine meeting! All the little girl's studies from the circulating library seemed about to be realised. But what had I in view in making this assignation? Indeed I know not. I had no evil intentions; nor can I say that I had any good ones. I liked the girl, and wanted to have an opportunity of seeing more of her; and the assignation was made, as I have done many things else, heedlessly and without forethought. I asked myself a few questions of the kind, after all my arrangements were made; but the answers were very unsatisfactory. [...] "Am I to ruin this poor thoughtless girl?" [...] said I to myself. [...] "No!" [...] was the prompt and indignant answer. [...] "Am I to run away with her?" [...] "Whither--and to what purpose?" [...] "Well, then, am I to marry her!"--"Pah! a man of my expectations marry a shopkeeper's daughter!" [...] "What, then, am I to do with her?" [...] "Hum--why.--Let me get into her chamber first, and then consider"--and so the self-examination ended.|$|E
6000|$|If {{the reader}} recall a passage already quoted from the Convito,[247] he will perhaps think with {{us that the}} gate of Dante's Limbo is left ajar even for the ancient {{philosophers}} to slip out. The divine judgments are still inscrutable, and the ways of God past finding out, but faith {{would seem to have}} led Dante at last to a more merciful solution of his doubt than he had reached when he wrote the De Monarchia. It is always humanizing to see how the most rigid creed is made to bend before the kindlier instincts of the heart. The stern Dante thinks none beyond hope save those who are dead in sin, and have made evil their good. But we are by no means sure that he is not right in insisting rather on the implacable severity of the law than on the possible relenting of the judge. Exact justice is commonly more merciful in the long run than pity, for it tends to foster in men those stronger qualities which make them good citizens, an object second only with the Roman-minded Dante to that of making them spiritually regenerate, nay, perhaps even more important as a necessary preliminary to it. The inscription over the gate of hell tells us that the terms on which we receive the trust of life were fixed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Divine</b> <b>Power</b> (which can what it wills), and are therefore unchangeable; by the Highest Wisdom, and therefore for our truest good; by the Primal Love, and therefore the kindest. These are the three attributes of that justice which moved the maker of them. Dante is no harsher than experience, which always exacts the uttermost farthing; no more inexorable than conscience, which never forgives nor forgets. No teaching is truer or more continually needful than that the stains of the soul are ineffaceable, and that though their growth may be arrested, their nature is to spread insidiously till they have brought all to their own color. Evil is a far more cunning and persevering propagandist than Good, for it has no inward strength, and is driven to seek countenance and sympathy. It must have company, for it cannot bear to be alone in the dark, while ...|$|E

Another small temple is built inside the fort consists of goddess Kaali. After the death of Pratap Singh, his successors had a tussle for the kinship which is not properly mentioned in history. The next influential king of Naigarhi was Jagat Bahadur Singh who was mostly known for leading a lavish life with wine, music and women. He built the matchless stone carved Bara-dari built for dancing and salacious enjoyment. In an artistic view Bara-dari {{is an example of}} outstandingly chiselled work of fine maestros. But sadly in the year 1933 it was struck by a thunder along with the Panchmandir temple and is now a detritus. In the reign of Jagat Bahadur, Naigarhi faced tumultuous tussle with the Maharaja of Rewa who made it firm to conquer Naigarhi to end the long term tension of a revolt. Historical facts suggest that Rewa attacked Naigarhi five times but failed to conquer the fort which was supernaturally proteged <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>divine</b> <b>powers</b> of goddess Kaali. A village folk song transcends the valour of the Naigarhian warriors and the divinity of a cannon named ‘Lakshmaniya’ - which means straight to the ‘Lakshya’ or target. The Cannon was rumoured to turn to its own desired direction and shoot without the help of any soldier. Ironically, these reasons were enough to herald Naigarhi as an invincible dominion.|$|R

60|$|Embarrassed by such difficulties, another {{course of}} {{explanation}} has been resorted to, which, freed {{from some of}} the objections which attend the two extreme suppositions, is yet liable to others. It has been supposed that something took place upon this remarkable occasion similar to that which disturbed the preconcerted purpose of the prophet Balaam, and compelled him to exchange his premeditated curses for blessings. According to this hypothesis, the divining woman of Endor was preparing to practise upon Saul those tricks of legerdemain or jugglery by which she imposed upon meaner clients who resorted to her oracle. Or we may conceive that in those days, when the laws of Nature were frequently suspended <b>by</b> manifestations of <b>the</b> <b>Divine</b> <b>Power,</b> some degree of juggling might be permitted between mortals and the spirits of lesser note; in which case we must suppose that the woman really expected or hoped to call up some supernatural appearance. But in either case, this second solution of the story supposes that the will of the Almighty substituted, on that memorable occasion, for <b>the</b> phantasmagoria intended <b>by</b> <b>the</b> witch, the spirit of Samuel in his earthly resemblance--or, if the reader may think this more likely, some good being, the messenger of <b>the</b> <b>Divine</b> pleasure, in <b>the</b> likeness of the departed prophet--and, to the surprise of the Pythoness herself, exchanged the juggling farce: of sheer deceit or petty sorcery which she had intended to produce, for a deep tragedy, capable of appalling the heart of the hardened tyrant, and furnishing an awful lesson to future times.|$|R
5000|$|Ahmadi {{beliefs are}} more {{aligned with the}} Sunni tradition, than they are with the Shi'a tradition, such as The Five Pillars of Islam and The Six {{articles}} of Islamic Faith. Likewise, Ahmadis accept the Quran as their holy text, face the Kaaba during prayer, practice the Sunnah (practices and habits of Muhammad) and accept the authority of Sunni Hadiths (reported sayings of and stories about Muhammad). These are the central beliefs constituting Ahmadi Muslim thought. The distinguishing feature of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community is their belief in Mirza Ghulam Ahmad as the Promised Messiah and Mahdi, as prophesied <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Islamic prophet Muhammad. Summarising his claim, Ahmad writes: The task for which God has appointed me is that I should remove the malaise that afflicts the relationship between God and His creatures and restore the relationship of love and sincerity between them.
