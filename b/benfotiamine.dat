40|$|Chronic microglial {{activation}} {{and resulting}} sustained neuroinflammatory reaction are generally associated with neurodegeneration. Activated microglia acquires proinflammatory cellular profile that generates oxidative burst.

In our recent study, {{we have shown}} that <b>benfotiamine</b> (S-benzoylthiamine O-monophosphate) possesses anti-inflammatory effects. Here, the effects of <b>benfotiamine</b> on the pro-oxidative component of activity of LPS-stimulated BV- 2 cells were investigated.

40|$|PURPOSE. To {{study the}} {{amelioration}} of ocular inflammation in endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) in rats by <b>benfotiamine,</b> a lipid-soluble analogue of thiamine. METHODS. EIU in Lewis rats was induced by subcutaneous injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) followed by treatment with <b>benfotiamine.</b> The rats were killed 3 or 24 hours after LPS injection, eyes were enucleated, aqueous humor (AqH) was collected, {{and the number}} of infiltrating cells, protein concentration, and inflammatory marker levels were determined. Immunohistochemical analysis of eye sections was performed to determine the expression of inducible–nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (Cox) - 2, protein kinase C (PKC), and transcription factor NF-�B. RESULTS. Infiltrating leukocytes, protein concentrations, and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were significantly elevated in the AqH of EIU rats compared with control rats, and <b>benfotiamine</b> treatment suppressed these increases. Similarly increased expression of inflammatory markers iNOS and Cox- 2 in ciliary body and retinal wall was also significantly inhibited by <b>benfotiamine.</b> The increased phosphorylation of PKC and the activation of NF-�B in the ciliary body and in the retinal wall of EIU rat eyes were suppressed by <b>benfotiamine.</b> CONCLUSIONS. These results suggest that <b>benfotiamine</b> suppresses oxidative stress–induced NF-�B–dependent inflammatory signaling leading to uveitis.

40|$|Abstract Background Lipid-soluble {{thiamine}} precursors have a {{much higher}} bioavailability than genuine thiamine and therefore {{are more suitable for}} therapeutic purposes. <b>Benfotiamine</b> (S-benzoylthiamine O-monophosphate), an amphiphilic S-acyl thiamine derivative, prevents the progression of diabetic complications, probably by increasing tissue levels of thiamine diphosphate and so enhancing transketolase activity. As the brain is particularly sensitive to thiamine deficiency, we wanted to test whether intracellular thiamine and thiamine phosphate levels are increased in the brain after oral <b>benfotiamine</b> administration. Results <b>Benfotiamine</b> that is practically insoluble in water, organic solvents or oil was solubilized in 200 mM hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin and the mice received a single oral administration of 100 mg/kg. Though thiamine levels rapidly increased in blood and liver to reach a maximum after one or two hours, no significant increase was observed in the brain. When mice received a daily oral administration of <b>benfotiamine</b> for 14 days, thiamine derivatives were increased significantly in the liver but not in the brain, compared to control mice. In addition, incubation of cultured neuroblastoma cells with 10 μM <b>benfotiamine</b> did not lead to increased intracellular thiamine levels. Moreover, in thiamine-depleted neuroblastoma cells, intracellular thiamine contents increased more rapidly after addition of thiamine to the culture medium than after addition of <b>benfotiamine</b> for which a lag period was observed. Conclusion Our results show that, though <b>benfotiamine</b> strongly increases thiamine levels in blood and liver, it has no significant effect in the brain. This would explain why beneficial effects of <b>benfotiamine</b> have only been observed in peripheral tissues, while sulbutiamine, a lipid-soluble thiamine disulfide derivative, that increases thiamine derivatives in the brain as well as in cultured cells, acts as a central nervous system drug. We propose that <b>benfotiamine</b> only penetrates the cells after dephosphorylation by intestinal alkaline phosphatases. It then enters the bloodstream as S-benzoylthiamine that is converted to thiamine in erythrocytes and in the liver. <b>Benfotiamine,</b> an S-acyl derivative practically insoluble in organic solvents, should therefore be differentiated from truly lipid-soluble thiamine disulfide derivatives (allithiamine and the synthetic sulbutiamine and fursultiamine) with a different mechanism of absorption and different pharmacological properties. </p...|$|E

High glucose and advanced glycation end-products (AGE) contribute locally to peritoneal and systemically to renal damage. Integrity of podocyte structure and function is of special importance to preserve RRF. <b>Benfotiamine</b> could counteract the glucose and AGE mediated toxicity by blocking hyperglycemia associated podocyte damage via the pentose phosphate pathway. Methods: A human differentiated podocyte cell line was incubated with control solution (Control), 2. 5 % glucose solution (Glucose) and 2. 5 % PD fluid (PDF) for 48 h either ± 50 μM <b>benfotiamine.</b> Podocyte damage and potential benefit of <b>benfotiamine</b> were analyzed using immunofluorescence, western blot analysis, and a functional migration assay.

Smoking induces endothelial {{dysfunction}} (ED) {{mainly by}} exacerbating oxidative stress (OS) and inflammation. <b>Benfotiamine,</b> a thiamine prodrug with high bioavailability, prevents nicotine-induced vascular dysfunction in rats.

Treatment with <b>benfotiamine</b> activated glucose metabolism in INS- 1 cells in high-glucose culture conditions, and appeared to maximize the BM-derived IPCs ability to synthesize insulin. <b>Benfotiamine</b> was not shown to induce the glucose receptor Glut- 2, however it was shown to activate glucokinase, the enzyme responsible for conversion of glucose to glucose- 6 -phosphate.

There were two- to fourfold increases in fructosyl-lysine and AGE content of glomerular, retinal, sciatic nerve and plasma protein in diabetes. Increases in AGEs were reversed by thiamine and <b>benfotiamine</b> therapy but increases in fructosyl-lysine were not.

40|$|Thiamine is {{essential}} for normal brain function and its deficiency causes metabolic impairment, specific lesions, oxidative damage and reduced adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN). Thiamine precursors with increased bioavailability, especially <b>benfotiamine,</b> exert neuroprotective effects not only for thiamine deficiency (TD), but also in mouse models of neurodegeneration. As {{it is known that}} AHN is impaired by stress in rodents, we exposed C 57 BL 6 /J mice to predator stress for 5 consecutive nights and studied the proliferation (number of Ki 67 -positive cells) and survival (number of BrdU-positive cells) of newborn immature neurons in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. In stressed mice, the number of Ki 67 - and BrdU-positive cells was reduced compared to non-stressed animals. This reduction was prevented when the mice were treated (200 mg/kg/day in drinking water for 20 days) with thiamine or <b>benfotiamine,</b> that were recently found to prevent stress-induced behavioral changes and glycogen synthase kinase- 3 β (GSK- 3 β) upregulation in the CNS. Moreover, we show that thiamine and <b>benfotiamine</b> counteract stress-induced bodyweight loss and suppress stress-induced anxiety-like behavior. Both treatments induced a modest increase in the brain content of free thiamine while the level of thiamine diphosphate (ThDP) remained unchanged, suggesting that the beneficial effects observed are not linked to the role of this coenzyme in energy metabolism. Predator stress increased hippocampal protein carbonylation, an indicator of oxidative stress. This effect was antagonized by both thiamine and <b>benfotiamine.</b> Moreover, using cultured mouse neuroblastoma cells, we show that in particular <b>benfotiamine</b> protects against paraquat-induced oxidative stress. We therefore hypothesize that thiamine compounds may act by boosting anti-oxidant cellular defenses, by a mechanism that still remains to be unveiled. Our study demonstrates, for the first time, that thiamine and <b>benfotiamine</b> prevent stress-induced inhibition of hippocampal neurogenesis and accompanying physiological changes. The present data suggest that thiamine precursors with high bioavailability might be useful as a complementary therapy in several neuropsychiatric disorders. Peer reviewe...|$|E
