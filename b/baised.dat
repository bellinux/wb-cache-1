When time-varying alphas are suppressed and only time-varying betas are considered, the betas become <b>baised.</b> Previous studies overstate the significance of time-varying alphas. ...|$|E

Current approaches to this problem are based on marginal structural models, i. e., parametric models for the marginal distribution of counterfactural outcomes as a function of treatment and effect modifiers. The various estimators developed in this context furthermore each depend on a high-dimensional nuisance parameter whose estimation currently also relies on parametric models. Since misspecification of any of these models can lead to severely <b>baised</b> estimates of causal effects, the dependence of current methods on such parametric models represents a major limitation. In this article we introduce estimators that allow the marginal structural model as well as the parametric model for the relevant nuisance parameter to be selected data-adaptively.

This paper sheds light on how these two factors - the regulated pricing system and the loe rate of separation - contribute to hospital inefficiency. It further argues for a capitaion on government regulated reimbursement prices for prescription drugs in order to increase hospital production efficiency. The empirical results of this study not only show that the regulated pricing causes the <b>baised</b> allocation of resources,which contributes to inefficiency,and that the number of prescriptions exceeding the optimal level,which results in the inefficiency of hospital production output,but also shows that overprecribing drugs increases the existing inefficiencles in hospitals. Simple price reduction {{of prescription drugs}} has little impact on discouraging physicians from over prescribing drugs due to the existing negative elasticity between treatment days and drug prices as well as between the relationship of units of service and drug prices. Futhermore,the regulated pricing system also contributes to inefficient human resource allocation in hospitals,pariculary pharmacist over employment,which in tum contributes to lower efficiency in general hospitals. As a means of comparative study,this paper highlights and evaluates the effectiveness of the capitation scheme in curbing medical expenditures with respect to prescription drug usage.

40|$|In an ECMP process, a wafer is anodically <b>baised</b> during polishing. The {{electrical}} potential {{is the driving}} force to oxidize copper metal to ions. Copper ions then react with chemistry in the electrolyte to go in solution or form a passivation layer on the surface. The passivation layer is removed by a very low downforce (0. 5 - 1 psi), causing copper to electrochemically dissolve in solution. Passive film formation during copper ECMP is key to the success of this process, since passivation reduces dissolution in the recessed areas, while elevations on the copper surface in direct contact with the ECMP pad are electrochemically planarized. If no passive film forms, then copper removal will be conformal from the elevated and recessed areas, and planarity will be lost. Chemical formulations for the electrochemical mechanical planarization (ECMP) of copper must contain constituents that are stable at anodic potentials. A key component of the formulation is a corrosion inhibitor, which is required to protect low lying areas while higher areas are selectively removed. Organic compounds, which adsorb on copper at low overpotentials and form a film by oxidation at higher overpotentials, may be particularly useful for ECMP. The main goal of the research reported in this dissertation is to understand and develop oxalic acid-based chemical systems suitable for ECMP of copper through electrochemical and surface investigations. Special attention was paid to the development of an inhibitor, which can function under applied potential conditions. Physical methods such as profilometry and four point probe were used to obtain copper removal rates. An organic compound, thiosalicylic acid (TSA), was identified and tested as a potential corrosion inhibitor for copper. TSA offers better protection than the conventionally used benzotriazole (BTA) by oxidizing at high anodic potentials to form a passive film on the copper surface. The passive film formed on the copper surface by addition of TSA was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The oxidation potential of TSA was characterized using cyclic voltammetry. The passivation and repassivation kinetics was investigated in detail and a passivation mechanism of copper in oxalic acid in the presence of TSA is proposed. Copper removal experiments were performed on a specially designed electrochemical abrasion cell (EC-AC) in both the presence and absence of inhibitors. The effect of anodic potentials on the dissolution of copper was studied to identify suitable conditions for the electro-chemical mechanical planarization process...|$|E
40|$|Although {{weather is}} a {{significant}} determinant of agriculture production, {{it is not a}} common practice in production analysis to investigate on its direct impact on the level of final production. We assume that the problem is methodological, since it is difficult to find a proper proxy variable for weather in these models. Thus, in the common production models, the weather is often included into a set of unmeasured determinants that affects the level of final production and farmers productivity (statistical noise, random error). The aim of this dissertation is to solve this methodological issues and find the way to define weather and its impacts in a form of proxy variable, to include this variable into proper econometric model and to apply the model. The purpose of this dissertation is to get beyond the empirical knowledge and define econometric model that would quantify weather impacts as a part of mutually (un) conditioned factors of final production, to specify the model and apply it. The dissertation {{is based on the assumption}} that the method of stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) represents a potential opportunity to treat the weather as a specific (though not firm-controllable) factor of production and technical efficiency. SFA is parametric method based on econometric approach. Its starting point is the stochastic frontier production function. The method was presented in the work of Aigner, Lovell and Schmidt (1977) and Meusen and van den Broeck (1977). Unlike commonly used econometric models, SFA is based on analysis of production frontier that is formed by deterministic production frontier function and the compound error term. The compound error term consists of two parts [...] random error (statistical noise, error term) and technical inefficiency. Technical inefficiency represents the difference in the actual level of production of the producer, and the maximum attainable (possible) level that would be achieved if the producer used a particular combination of production factors in a maximum technically efficient way. Over time, it has been developed on a number of aspects - see time variant and invariant inefficiency, heteroscedasticity, measurement and unmeasured heterogeneity. Along with the DEA, SFA has become the preferred methodology in the area of production frontier and productivity and efficiency analysis in agriculture. Lately, it has been applied for example by Bakusc, Fertő and Fogarasi (2008) Mathijs and Swinnen (2001), Hockmann and Pieniadz (2007), Bokusheva and Kumbhakar (2008) Hockmann et al. (2007), Čechura a Hockmann (2011, 2012), and Čechura et al. (2014 a, b). We assume that the weather impacts should be analysed with regard to technical efficiency, rather than as a part of statistical noise. Implementation of weather in part of deterministic production function rather than in the statistical noise {{is a significant}} change in the methodical approach within the stochastic frontier analysis. Analysis of the weather impacts on the changes in the level of TE has not been greatly recorded in the associated literature and is, therefore, considered as the main contribution of this work for the current theory of production frontier estimation, or the technological effectiveness, in the field of agriculture. Taking into account other variables that are important for the relationship and whose inclusion would enhance the explanatory power of the model was part of the objective of this work. Thus, the possible effect of heterogeneity was taken into account when models were formulated and final results discussed. The paper first defined and discussed possible ways how to incorporate the effects of the weather into production frontier model. Assessing the possibility of inclusion of weather in these models was based on the theoretical framework for the development of stochastic frontier analysis, which defines the concept of technical efficiency, distance functions theory, stochastic production function theory and the methodology and techniques that are applied within the framework of SFA, which were relevant for the purpose of this work. Then, the weather impacts on the shape and shift of production frontier and technical efficiency of czech cereal production in the years 2004 - 2011 was analyzed. The analysis was based on the assumption that there are two ways how to define variables representing weather in these models. One way is to use specific climatic data, which directly describe the state of the weather. For the purpose of this thesis, the variables mean air temperature (AVTit) and sum of precipitation (SUMPit) in the period between planting and harvest of cereals in the individual regions of Czech republic (NUTS 3) were selected. Variables were calculated from the data on monthly mean air temperatures and monthly sums of precipitation on the regional levels provided by Czech hydro-meteorological institute CHMI. Another way to define weather variable is to use a proxy variable. In this dissertation, the calculation of climatic index (KITit) was applied. Climatic index was calculated as a sum of ratios between the actual yield levels and approximated yield levels of wheat, barley and rye, weighted by the importance of each plant in a cereal production protfolio in each region of the Czech republic. Yield levels were approximated by the linear trend functions, yield and weights were calculated with the use of data on regional production and sown area under individual grains by year at the level of regional production (NUTS 3) provided by Czech Statistical Office. Both ways of weather definition are associated with some advantages and disadvantages. Particular climatic data are very precise specificatopn of the actual weather conditions, however, to capture their impacts on the level of final production, they must be implemented into model correctly along with the number of other factors, which have an impact on the level of final production. Climatic index, on the other hand, relates the weather impacts directly to the yield levels (it has been based on the assumption that the violation from yield trends are caused by the weather impacts), though, it does not accomodate the concrete weather characteristics. The analysis was applied on unbalanced panel data consisting of the information on the individual production of 803 producers specialized on cereal production, which have each the observations from at least two years out of total 8 -years time serie. Specialization on crop production was defined as minimum 50 % share of cereal production on the total plant production. Final panel consists of 2332 observations in total. The values of AVTit, SUMPit a KITit has been associated with each individual producer according to his local jurisdiction for a particular region. Weather impacts in the three specified forms were implemented into models that were defined as stochastic production frontier models that capture the possible heterogeneity effects. The aim is to identify the impact of weather on shift and shape of production frontier. Through the defined models, the production technology and technical efficiency were estimated. We assume that the proposed inclusion in weather impacts will lead to a better explanatory power of defined models, as a result of weather extraction from a random components of the model, or from a set of unmeasured factors causing heterogeneity of the sample, respectivelly. Two types of models were applied to estimate TE - Fixed management model (FMM) and Random parameter model (RPM). Models were defined as translogarithmic multiple-output distance function. The analyzed endogene variable is cereal production (expressed in thousands of EUR). Other two outputs, other plant production and animal production (both expressed in thousands of EUR) are expressed as the share on cereal production and they appear on the right side of the equation together with the exogene variables representing production factors labour (in AWU), total utilized land (in acres), capital (sum of contract work, especially machinery work, and depreciation, expressed in thousands of EUR), specific material (represented by the costs of seeds, plants, fertilisers and crop protection, expressed in thousands of EUR), and other material (in thousands of EUR). The values of all three outputs, capital, and material inputs were deflated by the the country price indexes taken from the EUROSTAT database (2005 = 100). In Random parameter model, heterogeneity is captured in random parameters and in the determinants of distribution of the technical inefficiency, uit. All production factors were defined as a random parameters and weather in form of KITit enters the mean of uit and so it represents the possible source of unmeasured heterogeneity of a sample. In fixed management model, heterogeneity is defined as a special factor representing firm specific effects, mi. This factor represents unmeasured sources of heterogeneity of sample and enters the model in interaction with other production factors and the with the trend variable, tit. Trend variable represents the impact of technological change at a time t for each producer i. The weather impacts in form of variables AVTit a SUMPit is, together with production factors, excluded from the set of firm specific effects and it is also numerically expressed. That way weather becomes a measured source of heterogeneity of a sample. Both types of models were estimated also without the weather impacts specification in order to obtain the benchmark against which the effects of weather impacts specification on production frontier and technical efficiency is evaluated. Easier interpretation of results was achieved by naming all five estimated models as follows: FMM is a name of fixed management model that does not include specified weather variables, AVT is a name for fixed management model including weather impacts in form of average temperatures AVTit, SUMP is name of model which includes weather impacts in form of sum of precipitations SUMPit, RPM is random parameter model that does not account for weather impacts, KIT is random parameter model that includes climatic index KITit into the mean of inefficiency. All estimated models fullfilled the conditions of monotonicity and kvasikonvexity for each production factor with the exception of capital in FMM, AVT, SUMP and RPM model. Violating the kvasikonvexity condition is against the theoretical assumptions the models are based on, however, since capital is also insignificant, it is not necesary to regard model as incorrect specification. Violation of kvasikonvexity condition can be caused by the presence of other factor, which might have contraproductive influence on final production in relation to capital. For example, Cechura and Hockann (2014) mention imperfections of capital market as possible cause of inadequate use of this production factor with respect to technological change. Insufficient significancy of capital can be the result of incorrect specification of variable itself, as capital is defined as investment depreciation and sum of contract work in the whole production process and not only capital related to crop production. The importance of capital in relation to crop production is, thus, not strong enough to be significant. Except of capital are all other production factors significant on the significancy level of 0, 01. All estimated models exhibit a common pattern as far as production elasticity is concerned. The highest elasticity is attributed to production factors specific and othe material. Production elasticity of specific material reaches values of 0, 29 - 0, 38, the highest in model KIT and lowest of the values in model AVT. Production elasticity of other material reahed even higher values in the range 0, 40 - 0, 47. Highest elasticity of othe material was estimated by model AVT and lowest by model KIT. Lowest production elasticity are attributed to production factors labour and land. Labour reached elasticity between 0, 006 and 0, 129 and land reached production elasticity in the range of 0, 114 a 0, 129. All estimated models displayed simmilar results regarding production elasticities of production factors, which also correspond with theoretical presumptions about production elasticities [...] highest values of elasticity of material inputs correspond with naturally high flexibility of these production factors, while lowest values of elasticity of land corresponds with theoretical aspect of land as relativelly inelastic production factor. Low production elasticity of labour was explained as a result of lower labor intensity of cereals sector compared to other sectors. Production elasticity of weather is significant both in form of average temperatures between planting and harvest in a given region, AVTit, and form of total precipitation between planting and harvest in a given region, SUMPit. Production elasticity of AVTit, reach rather high value of 0, 3691, which is in the same level as production elasticities of material inputs. Production elasticity of SUMPit is also significant and reach rather high lower value of 0, 1489. Both parameters shows significant impact of weather on the level of final crop production. Sum of production elasticities in all models reach the values around 1, indicating constant returns of scale, RS (RSRPM= 1, 0064, RSKIT= 0, 9738, RSSUMP = 1, 00002, RSFMM= 0, 9992, RSAVT= 1, 0018.). The results correspond with the conclusion of Cechura (2009) and Cechura and Hockmann (2014) about the constant returns of scale in cereals sector in Czech republic. Since the value of RS is calculated only with the use of production elasticities of production factors, almost identical result provided by all three specifications of fixed management model is a proof of correct model specification. Further, the significance of technological change and its impact on final production and production elasticities were reviewed. Technological change, TCH, represents changes in production technology over time through reported period. It is commonly assumed that there is improvement on production technology over time. All estimated models prooved significant impact of TCH on the level of final production. All specified fixed management models indicate positive impaact of TCH, which accelerates over time. Estimated random parameter models gave contradicting results [...] model KIT implies that TCH is negative and decelerating in time, while model RPM indicates positive impact of TCH on the level of final production, which is also decelerating in time. It was concluded, that in case that weather is not included into model, it can have a direct impact on the positive direction of TCH effect, which can be captured by implementing weather into model and so the TCH becomes negative. However, as to be discussed later, random parameter model appeared not as a suitable specification for analyzed relationship and so the estimate of the TCH impact might have been distorted. The impact of technological progress on the production elasticities (so-called biased technological change) is in fixed management models displayed by parameters representing the interaction of production factors with trend variable. The hypothesis of time invariant parameters (Hicks neutral technological change) associated with the production factors is rejected for all models except the model AVT. Significant <b>baised</b> technological change is confirmed for models FMM and SUMP. Biased technological change is other material-saving and specific material-intensive. In the AVT model, where weather is represented by average temperatures, AVTit, technological change is not significant in relation to any production factors. In both random parameter models, rejection of hypothesis of time invariant parameters only confirms significance of technological change in relation to final crop production. Nonsignificant effect of technological change on production elasticity of labor, land and capital indicates a generally low ability of farmers to respond to technological developments, which can be explained by two reasons. The first reason can the possible complications in adaptation to the conditions of the EU common agricultural market (eg. there are not created adequate conditions in the domestic market, which would make it easier for farmers to integrate into the EU). This assumption is based on conclusion made by Cechura and Hockmann (2014), where they explain the fact that in number of European countries there is capital-saving technological change instead of expected capital-using technical change as the effect of serious adjustment problems, including problems in the capital market [...] Second possible reason for nonsignificant effect of technological change on production elasticity of labor, land and capital is that the financial support of agricultural sector, which was supposed to create sufficient conditions for accomodation of technological progress, has not shown yet. Then, the biased TCH is not pronounced in relation to most production factors. Weather impacts (SUMPit, AVTit) are not in significant relation to technological change. Both types of models, FMM and RPM were discussed in relation to the presence of the heterogeneity effects All estimated random parameters in both RPM models are statistically significant with the exception of the production factor capital in a model that does not involve the influence of weather (model RPM). Estimated parameter for variable KITit (0, 0221) shows significant positive impact of the weather on the distribution of TE. That way, heterogeneity in relation to TE is confirmed, too, as well as significant impact of weather on the level of TE. Management (production environment) is significant in all three estimated fixed management models. In models that include weather impacts (AVT, SUMP), the parameter estimates indicates positive, slightly decreasing effect of management (or heterogeneity, respectivelly) on the level of final crop production. In model FMM, on the contrary, first and second order parameters of mangement indicate also significant, but negative and decelerating effect of management (heterogeneity) on final crop production. If weather impact is included into models in form of AVTit, or. SUMPit, the direction of the influence of management on the level of final crop production changes. Based on the significance of first order parameter of management, significant presence of heterogeneity of analyzed sample is confirmed in all three estimated fixed management models. As far as the effect of heterogeneity on single production factors (so called management bias) is concerned, the results indicate that in case of model that does not include weather impacts (model FMM) the heterogeneity has positive impact on production elasticities of land and capital and negative effect on the production elasticities of material inputs. In models that account for weather impacts, heterogeneity has negative effect on production elasticities of land and capital and positive effect on the elasticity of material inputs. Heterogeneity effect on the production elasticity of labor is insignificant in all models FMM. In all three estimated models, the effect of heterogeneity is strongest in case of production factors specific and othe material, and, also, on production factor land. In case of FMM model, heterogeneity leads to increase of production elasticity of land, while in AVT and SUMP heterogeneity leads to decrease of production elasticity of land. At the same time, the production elasticity of land, as discussed earlier, is rather low in all three models. This fact leads to a conclusion that in models that accomodate weather impacts (AVT and SUMP), as the effect of extraction of weather from the sources of unmeasured heterogeneity, the heterogeneity has a negative impact on production elasticity of land. It can be stated that the inclusion of weather effects into the sources of unmeasured heterogeneity overestimated the positive effect of unmeasured heterogeneity on the production factor land in the model FMM. Management does not have a significant effect on the weather in form of SUMPit, while it has significant and negative effect on the weather in form of average temperature, AVTit, with the value of - 0. 0622 **. In other words, heterogeneity is in negative interaction with weather represented by average temperatures, while weather in form of the sum of precipitation (SUMPit) does not exhibit significant relation to unmeasured heteregeneity. In comparison with the model that does not include weather impacts, the effect of heterogeneity on the production elasticities has the opposite direction the models that include weather. Compare to the model where weather is represented by average temperature (model AVT), the effect of management (heterogeneity) on the production elasticity of capital is bigger in model with weather represented by sum of precipitations (model SUMP) while the effect of management (heterogeneity) on the production elasticity of land and material imputs is smaller in model with weather represented by sum of precipitations (model SUMP). Technical efficiency is significant in all estimated models. The variability of inefficiency effects is bigger than the variabilty of random error in both models that include weather and models where weather impacts are not specified. The average of TE in random parametr models reaches rather low value (setting the average TE = 54 %), which indicates, that specified RPM models underestimate TE as a possible result of incorrect variable specification, or, incorrect assumptions on the distribution of the error term representing inefficiency. All estimated FMM models results in simmilar value of average TE (86 - 87 %) with th...|$|E
