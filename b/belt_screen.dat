40|$|AbstractThe Northeastern U. S. has {{the ideal}} {{location}} and {{unique opportunity to}} be a leader in cold water marine finfish aquaculture. However, problems and regulations on environmental issues, mandatory stocking of 100 % native North American salmon, and disease have impacted economic viability of the U. S. salmon industry. In response to these problems, the USDA ARS developed the National Cold Water Marine Aquaculture Center (NCWMAC) in Franklin, Maine. The NCWMAC is adjacent to the University of Maine Center for Cooperative Aquaculture Research on the shore of Taunton Bay and shares essential infrastructure to maximize efficiency. Facilities are used to conduct research on Atlantic salmon and other cold water marine finfish species. The initial research focus for the Franklin location is to develop a comprehensive Atlantic salmon breeding program from native North American fish stocks leading to the development and release of genetically improved salmon to commercial producers. The Franklin location has unique ground water resources to supply freshwater, brackish water, salt water or filtered seawater to fish culture tanks. Research facilities include office space, primary and secondary hygiene rooms, and research tank bays for culturing 200 + Atlantic salmon families with incubation, parr, smolt, on-grow, and broodstock tanks. Tank sizes are 0. 14 m 3 for parr, 9 m 3 for smolts, and 36, 46 and 90 m 3 for subadults and broodfish. Culture tanks are equipped with recirculating systems utilizing biological (fluidized sand) filtration, carbon dioxide stripping, supplemental oxygenation and ozonation, and ultraviolet sterilization. Water from the research facility discharges into a wastewater treatment building and passes through micro-screen drum filtration, an inclined traveling <b>belt</b> <b>screen</b> to exclude all eggs or fish from the discharge, and UV irradiation to disinfect the water. The facility was completed in June 2007, and all water used in the facility has been from groundwater sources. Mean facility discharge has been approximately 0. 50 m 3 /min (130 gpm). The facility was designed for stocking densities of 20 – 47 kg/m 3 and a maximum biomass of 26, 000 kg. The maximum system density obtained from June 2007 through January 2008 has approached 40 kg/m 3, maximum facility biomass was 11, 021 kg, water exchange rates have typically been 2 – 3 % of the recirculating system flow rate, and tank temperatures have ranged from a high of 15. 4 °C in July to a low of 6. 6 °C in January 2008 without supplemental heating or cooling...|$|E

40|$|Erosive slurry wear occurs {{extensively}} throughout minerals {{processing equipment}} for slurry transport applications. Wear resistant materials {{are designed to}} prolong the life of equipment used to transport the slurry such as pumps, hoses, grinders, conveyor <b>belts,</b> <b>screens,</b> etc. In this study, the erosive wear mechanisms of rubber pump lining materials used in slurry pumps were explored at a structural level. The erosive wear mechanisms for rubber pump lining materials have not be extensively investigated in the literature. Arnold and Hutchings [1] were the pioneers in this field of tribology, however, {{a number of key}} areas for study remain. Although the wear mechanisms of rubber wear in slurry erosion are well documented in the literature, the chemical degradation of the rubber during this erosive wear has not been investigated. Furthermore, the viscoelastic properties of the rubber and their correlation with erosive wear have not been well documented. The approach to {{this study was to investigate}} four different rubber compounds used in slurry transport pumps and determine the wear mechanisms and their correlation with physical, viscoelastic and chemical properties of the rubbers. A slurry jet erosion test was used to investigate the wear rate of each compound under different variables. The samples were then chemically analysed using a Fourier Transfer Infra Red (FT-IR) Spectrometer to determine the extent of chemical change to the surface of the rubber during erosive wear testing. The physical properties of the rubber were tested using conventional test methods, whereas a Rubber Process Analyser 2000 (RPA 2000) was used to determine the key viscoelastic properties. It was important to investigate these properties of the rubber compounds to determine which properties could be correlated with erosive wear. Through FT-IR analysis of heat aged samples of the rubber compounds, it was established that erosive slurry wear does not correlate with aging, however, heat aging influences the hardness, resilience and viscoelastic properties which increases the wear rate of the rubber compounds. The key findings from this study were that heat aging would increase the tan &# 948; and hardness, and lower the resilience, hence, causing lower erosive wear resistance in all the rubbers. Tan &# 948;, hardness and resilience could be correlated with erosive wear loss, the heat aging effect and the chemistry of the rubber compounds. The influence of the type of reinforcing filler and cure systems could also be correlated with erosive wear resistance. Rubbers with a high loading of reinforcing carbon black resulted in a low wear resistance in comparison to a high wear resistance for silica and silane filled rubber compounds. Tan &# 948; was also correlated with the type of reinforcing filler used in the rubber chemistry. The significance of these findings is important for the future design of rubber compounds used in slurry erosion wear resistant pump liners. For a highly slurry erosion wear resistant pump liner, a high resilience, low tan &# 948; and hardness (as are found in silica and silane reinforced rubber) would be required...|$|R
50|$|Following Robert's {{successful}} model, {{built in}} 1798, Saint-Léger Didot insisted that Robert {{apply for a}} patent. Prior to 1798, paper was made one sheet at a time, by dipping a rectangular frame or mould with a screen bottom into a vat of pulp. The frame {{was removed from the}} vat, and the water was pressed out of the pulp. The remaining pulp was allowed to dry; the frame could not be re-used until the previous sheet of paper was removed from it. Robert's construction had a moving <b>screen</b> <b>belt</b> that would receive a continuous flow of stock and deliver an unbroken sheet of wet paper to a pair of squeeze rolls. As the continuous strip of wet paper came off the machine it was manually hung over a series of cables or bars to dry. With Didot's urging, Robert and Didot went to François de Neufchâteau, the Minister of the Interior and applied for a patent. In 1799, the patent (brevet d'invention) was granted by the French Government, for which Robert paid 8,000 francs.|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the design and}} operation of models I, II, and V. No report has been prepared on model III - the differences in design between it and model II were not great enough to warrant a separate report. Models IV and VI have been tested, and reports describing their features and operation are being prepared. The basic design for model I was taken from that developed by the Fisheries Research Board of Canada during an investigation with traveling cables and a chain. BCF experiments on model I indicated a need to eliminate the drag created by the screen as it returned upstream through the water. This change was accomplished in model II by raising the screen clear of the water on its return upstream. Model III, installed and tested within the Maxwell Canal (Hermiston, Oreg.) during 1966, had some improvements over model II, particularly in design of the carriage, track, and drive systems. The step from model III to IV was significant {{from the standpoint of}} design and size of structure - the carriage and track systems were drastically changed, and the screen had to be made larger and stronger to handle flows that were 10 times greater than those handled by model III.

40|$|The {{traveling}} screen; a rotating, <b>belt</b> type, mechanical <b>screen</b> {{was built}} to remove the invasive Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis) at the Tracy Fish Collection Facility (TFCF). Because the screen has been demonstrated to be fish friendly during mitten crab removal (1996 - 1999), it was natural to test the traveling screen as a general debris removal device. The goals {{of this study were}} to determine of the screen could be used to remove debris flowing through the primary fish guidance louvers to the secondary fish guidance louvers, and also to determine if improvements to the debris removal system could be made to improve collection and transport of collected debris to the debris hauling truck. Three different evaluation techniques were used to determine the effectiveness of the traveling screen to remove debris: (1) The addition of known amounts of debris, introduced upstream of the traveling screen, compared to the debris recovered by the traveling screen. (2) Overnight collection of debris in which the traveling screen was operated, on average, 15. 5 hours per night. (3) Ten-minute debris collections within the below-ground circular holding tank, coinciding with routine fish counts being made every 2 hours at the TFCF. Two hundred sixty-one fish were collected by the traveling screen during these three different evaluations. Of this total, 210 were dead, and 173 (66 percent) of these dead fish had been dead long before being collected, indicated by old injuries and decomposition of the body. The traveling screen has proven to be effective at removing green vegetative debris greater than 189 mm (7. 4 inches) and woody debris greater than 105 mm (4. 1 inches) in length or longer from the secondary channel.

40|$|Health care {{consumers}} of all stripes—young and old, healthy and sick, employed and retired—are increasingly {{being asked to}} take on more responsi-bility for their health and health care.

40|$|Dust from mining {{activities}} is produced from several unit operations {{and is often}} a serious problem to the industry, due to the influence it can have on {{human health and the}} safety record and productivity of a mine. So far, legislative parties and the industry have approached dust as an issue that needs to be controlled, only when a mining operation or process generates undesirable particulates. Nevertheless, new legislation and standards, such as the EU IPPC directive (Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control) and air quality strategies aim to drive mining companies to incorporate dust assessment planning that will be implemented through the whole life cycle of the mine. Mitigation and monitoring practices as well as health surveillance programs will need to be clearly defined. This project’s purpose is to understand how mining processes and in particular how the mechanisms inherent within common unit operations (i. e transfer processes using haulage roads or conveyor belts, the tipping, loading and stockpiling process, the screening process etc) result in the generation of dust. If the operation of unit operations could by optimized to produce less dust, then a “fit-for-purpose” strategy for dust minimisation could be developed to follow exploitation, processing and production demand. The literature on dust from mining operations identified that generation of fines/dust occurs due to the presence of the mechanisms of abrasion and impact. Based on this logic, an experimental methodology was developed, which aimed to assess how dust was generated for each different mechanism and for a variety of ores of different mineralogy. Five different ores were tested, a limestone, talc, an iron ore, a lamproite and a copper ore and the same experimental methodology was followed for each. Experimentation using the HSE-WSL tumbling mill test determined that under the effect of abrasion, ores yielded higher dustiness values during longer tumbling times, whilst parameters such as the sample mass and the particle size distribution of the feed sample could also influence the dust generation patterns. The findings of the computational modelling (discreet element modelling) and experimentation (high speed video recording) suggested that control and optimisation of operational parameters (e. g mill velocity, or tumbling time) within processes that involve abrasion, {{such as the use of}} conveyor <b>belts,</b> mills, and <b>screens</b> could minimise the potential of dust generation by this mechanism. The use of a novel impact test determined a positive relationship between the energy input and the particle size distributions of the broken particles, as well as the accumulation of fine particulates in the range of dust (< 75 μm). Also an increase in the bulk volume of ores resulted in larger quantities of fine particulates. These observations suggest that it is possible to reduce dust in processes that involve drop from heights and impaction (i. e transfer points in conveyor belts, tipping, loading) by adjusting the energy input and the bulk volume of ore at impact to as low a level possible. Particle size analysis of the produced dust fractions were found to be material dependent and varied considerably for the different ores. Almost all materials produced significant amounts of ultra fine particles below 10 μm and 2. 5 μm, both under impact and abrasion, which reveals the potential adverse impacts to the environment and human health. Quantitative mineralogical analysis using the mineral liberation analyser determined that the dust fraction presents a different composition to that of the ore. Comparison of the results collected for the five different ores using the HSE-WSL mill and the impact test identified that certain materials yielded high dust levels under abrasion and low under impact. Therefore it would be expected that dust control approaches for such materials would differ according to the mechanisms of the involved process and the mineralogy of the sample. According to the findings of this study a reduction in dust produced from mining unit operations could be possible by optimising the involved processes either by altering their operating parameters (drop height during tipping, velocity of conveyor belt) or by optimising the design of processes so as to reduce abrasion or impact. New legislation such as the EU IPPC directive has already started considering such an approach as important, and newly developed Best Available Techniques documents refer to this as the primary step companies should follow to minimise dust. Additional advantages of this approach are that it can reduce cost for dust control by making use of less conventional mitigation practices, and in the long term it could also minimise the utilization of energy and water going to suppression, extraction and dust collection systems. In certain cases the proposed route could also optimise the production chain, especially where the generation of fines is undesirable (e. g iron ore processing or aggregates production) ...|$|R
