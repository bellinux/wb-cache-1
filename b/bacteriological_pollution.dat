Among other activities, it systematically collected data on performance indicators (benchmarking), prepared business plans, valued fixed assets and identified all customers. The project also established water balances in pilot areas where customer meters had been installed, carried out customer satisfaction surveys in the same areas, and prepared the ground for the adoption for consumption-based tariffs. However, these tariffs are not yet applied. It also tried to prepare the Establishments for taking over their responsibilities in wastewater management through a “Declaration of Principles towards Sustainable Wastewater Management". However, the Establishments have not yet taken over this responsibility.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{problems}} dealing with traditional water-monitoring methods {{is the need to}} collect water samples at the precise moment that faecal contamination is actually present; for this reason, the use of Mytilus galloprovincialis as an indicator of previously high bacteria concentrations in coastal seawaters was examined. These molluscs are able to integrate the fluctuations in pollutants, they are good representatives of the sampling area because they are sedentary, and they offer the advantage of being resistant to pollution. The research was conducted from September 2001 to October 2002, twice a month, in two coastal areas of Salento (Apulia, Italy), near the discharge channels. We analysed both natural and cultivated mussels. The latter were placed in cages, after checking their starting level of microbiological <b>pollution.</b> <b>Bacteriological</b> analyses were conducted simultaneously on mussels and their ambient water to detect total coliforms, faecal coliforms, faecal streptococci, and Escherichia coli. The abundance of bacteria investigated was always higher within mussels than in the surrounding water where levels were sometimes undetectable. These results confirm the ability of mussels to concentrate and to retain bacteria into their tissues (recorders of present or even past microbiological pollution). Therefore, mussels can enable to detect a bacterial contamination that might be missed by standard water-monitoring methods, and we suggest they be included in routine microbiological investigations of coastal seawaters even in areas where these species aren’t widely distributed...|$|R

40|$|Groundwater {{has become}} a source of {{drinking}} water since last few decades, due to the scarcity, non-availability and <b>bacteriological</b> <b>pollution</b> of surface waters in many developing and underdeveloped countries. Millions of handpumps and deep tubewells have been installed in India since 1970, to provide safe drinking water to rural population, as groundwater is generally free of bacteriological contamination. Although this drastically reduced the incidence of water borne diseases, it has led to the emergence of chronic health effects {{in many parts of the}} country due to the excessive presence of chemical constituents like fluoride and arsenic in groundwater in some parts of the country. These have become major geo-environmental issues (1, 2). Not much attention was given in the initial stages to the presence of these chemical constituents, as clinical manifestations appear after a prolonged intake of contaminated water. Fluoride is a normal constituent of natural waters. Its concentration, however, varies depending on the water source.

40|$|L'exploitation des systèmes aquifères karstiques est toujours effectuée sous des contraintes liées à leur forte vulnérabilité. Une étude complète d'un épisode de crue de la source du Lez a été réalisée grâce à une coopération entre les Services de Santé et l'Université. Cette étude comporte une {{observation}} des paramètres physico-chimiques et bactériologiques sur une période de 15 jours, correspondant à une réponse hydrodynamique impulsionnelle sur la totalité du bassin. Les pas de temps d'échantillonnage varient de 4 à 24 heures. L'interprétation des résultats physico-chimiques met en évidence une disjonction nette entre les variations piézométriques et le passage de différents volumes d'eau. L'écoulement des eaux plus chaudes (16, 5 °C) observé lors de l'étiage, eaux d'origine profonde plus chargées chimiquement se poursuit jusque vers le milieu de la décrue pour faire place à l'arrivée d'eaux plus froides correspondant à des infiltrations rapides puis retardées. Les eaux les plus chaudes sont caractérisées par des variations des teneurs en magnésium, les teneurs en calcium restant à peu prés constantes. Inversement; les eaux froides de l'infiltration retardée ont de faibles variations des teneurs en magnésium et sont tracées par une forte {{augmentation des}} valeurs en calcium. Le risque sanitaire maximal est lié au début de l'arrivée des eaux froides. Les eaux d'étiage et les eaux profondes sont légèrement contaminées. Les eaux d'infiltration retardée sont peu contaminées. En dehors des zones de perte du réseau hydrographique et des axes d'infiltration rapide, la vulnérabilité de l'aquifère est faible à l'échelle du bassin. The exploitation of karstic aquifer {{systems for the}} supply of potable water raises {{the problem of the}} evaluation of sanitary risks, in view of their great vulnerability. To supply a great urban tenter, a yield as high as several cubic metres per hour is required, and this magnitude corresponds to that of an underground basin of several km 2, so {{that it is difficult to}} monitor and protect. Analytical observations from sanitary control platforms on potable water catchments have shown the existence of periods of high <b>bacteriological</b> <b>pollution</b> synchronizing systematically with periods of a rise of water. These <b>bacteriological</b> <b>pollution</b> transfers depend on the general conditions in which the aquifer functions. It seemed interesting, for the prevention of contamination, to examine all these hydrogeologic functions observed during a water rise, using bacteriological parameters. This study was based on observations made during an overall flood period following a prolonged drought throughout the whole basin supplying the city of Montpellier (France). The aim was to carry out a correlation test on the functioning of a karstic aquifer, with regard to :- the variation of the main physico-chemical parameters,- the principal pathogenic germs,- the commonly observed indicators of faecal contamination. This operation, undertaken in close collaboration with the sanitation board and the university authorities, required considerable investment in human, materiat and financial resources. Montpellier, a city with a population of 250 000 inhabitants, is supplied with potable water from the source of the River Lez. The water catchment is-situated upstream of a. major resurgence (12 m 3 /s during the water rise), tapping water from a principal drainage channel at a depth of 40 metres. The area of the basin feeding the spring was evaluated to be 150 km 2 by adjustment to the 450 km 2 of Jurassic and Cretaceous outcropping certified limestone, north of Montpellier. Even if the limits of the basin are not precisely defined, some of its parameters are well known. The aquifer consists of different structural zones, almost like independent sub-systems, having in common a rapid drainage network. The response observed at the exurgence is compared globally with the pluviometric signs, as well as with the effects produced in each structural zone, the transfer time, chemistry, temperature, recession, etc. The whole aquifer must be considered under pressure and it is this state of pressure which is probably responsible for the directional flow of the water from the rock matrix and of that circulating in the major karstification areas. The aquifer may be either in a state of injection or drainage and this notion is supported by the chemical and thermal fluctuations at the exurgence point. A one-year experimental programme, based on our knowledge of this aquifer, has been set up in collaboration with forecasters at the National Meteorological Office. All have been on the alert and ready to intervene, equipped with all the necessary staff and apparatus to ensure reliable sampling and analyses. The following procedures were performed :- sampling every 4 hours during the first 48 hours;- sampling every 12 hours during the following 48 hours. Then until the end of the study, sampling took place every 24 hours with :- 1 bacteriological sample in sterile condition,- 1 sample for physico-chemical analyses in the laboratory,- temperature measurements with a 1 / 10 ° mercury thermometer,- resistivity measurements,- pH measurements with two standards,- a limigraphic reading. This period of water rise, hydrologically homogeneous throughout the whote basin in the form of a single impulsive response tasting about 10 days, was characterised by the circulation of two types of water masses : from the rock matrix and resutting from rapid infiltration. The mixture of these two bodies, each with a distinct chemical character, is a function of the state of pressure in the aquifer. At the end of the rise, a third type of water intervenes, that of retarded infiltration. The best criteria for identifying these volumes of water are thermal ones. The most variable elements are magnesium and calcium. Deep waters with a temperature of 16 ° 5 are characterised by a variation in magnesium, and cold water, by a variation in calcium. The highest value of calcium is related to the passage of water bodies attributed to the influence of retarded infiltration. The geological observations and the processing of results by factorial analyses show a clear distinction between the chemical rise and the piezometric rise. The hydraulic rise point is constituted by water with the saure chemical characteristics as that of the lowest water level. The most important dilution due to rapid transfer in the basin is observed in the middle of the water fait. These synchronized with the highest batteriological pollution rate for most of the elements. This study has provided a global appreciation of the sanitary risks and shows how pollution mechanisms function. Risks are permanent, even during the passage of the deepest water with a long residence time. This phenomenon raises the question of the duration and mode of survive of non encystable bacteria indicators in the karst system. The survival time appeared to be about a year or more. There is always a covariation between the physico-chemical elements and <b>bacteriological</b> <b>pollution</b> where the aquifer is under high pressure and when the water rises or has reached its maximum level, or when the water starts to fall. It is when the level of the water starts to drop that the main peaks of <b>bacteriological</b> <b>pollution</b> are observed. From this moment onwards, the whole basin functions like a drained system and the absence of covariation in the physico-chemical and bacteriological parameters are signs that the flow has become heterogeneous. For sanitation purposes it may be sufficient to monitor temperature and other chemical elements, in order to determine when an additional treatment of the water is required to maintain its potability. An appropriate apparatus is being devised to this end...|$|E

Samples were collected at different periods of the year between February and August on this location and on an undisturbed reference site located on the artificial intertidal shore. Chemical aspects were apprehended by metal concentrations in biota. Biological aspects were based on physiological status and biometrics indicators. It enables us to look for the phenotypic variations of morphological patterns of the mussel shells in relation to environmental changes. It was completed by an ecological characterisation of the present benthic communities. The communication proposes {{a detailed description of the}} method and a presentation of first results which actually does not show any modification of the biological indicators in relation to the new process...|$|E
40|$|Groundwater {{is still}} a main source of clean water in rural areas of Indonesia. Drinking-water {{facilities}} which mostly use shallow groundwater are dug wells. However, the water quality of dug wells is the worst among other shallow groundwater facilities. This is due to some factors affecting the quality, such as the type of soil, the season, the distance of latrines to the on-site sanitation, the construction of those facilities, and the behavior of water users. Those factors {{were used in the}} sanitary inspection checklist of drinking-water quality surveillance. The study was conducted in Rembang District in August and November 1999 and aimed to determine how those factors may impact on water quality by measuring the concentration of faecal coliforms. The method of the study includes bacteriological assessment of water samples, interview with the owners of the water facilities, sanitary inspection, and examination of soil size of samples taken from the dugwells.  The sample size of dugwells was determined by multi-stage random sampling method, amounting to a total of 261 dugwells from two villages. The water sampling and the sanitary inspection were conducted twice according to two seasons on all 261 dugwells, whilst the soil sample examination were conducted only on 30 dugwells. The determination of <b>bacteriological</b> <b>pollution</b> risk were based on logistic regression analysis with a level of confidence of 90 %. The study showed that in the dry season there were three significant variables for dugwells. They were the seal of the wall below the ground less than three meters, the water stagnant within two meters of the well, and the location of the well outside the house. In the rainy season, the only significant variable was the location of the well outside the house. The type of soil surounding the dugwells according to the examination of soil size was not significant due to its homogenity. The study reccommends for further studies with emphasis on increasing the sample size and variety of soil size. </p...|$|E
40|$|Agricultural {{activities}} are frequently associated with water contamination. The spreading and storage of fertilizers, for instance, {{may result in}} groundwater contamination due to pollutants leaching into an aquifer. Nitrates and fecal bacteria are two important contaminants associated with agriculture. Thus, the development of efficient strategies for groundwater protection in agricultural areas requires an assessment of these two contaminants. Given this perspective, groundwater quality monitoring was carried out over the whole capture zone of a municipal well located in an agricultural area in the St. -Lawrence Lowlands in Québec. Thirty-eight piezometers were installed within the roughly 2 km 2 capture area of the well to measure physico-chemical parameters such as major ions, field measured parameters (pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, water level, temperature), and isotopic ratios, bacteriological parameters (Heterotrophic Plate Count [...] HPC, enterococci, total coliforms, Escherichia coli) and their variations in space and time. Groundwater was sampled from the pumping well and the piezometers during 25 field campaigns in 2005, 2006 and 2007. The results demonstrate the impact of agricultural activities on nitrate contamination. They indicate high spatial and temporal variations in nitrate concentrations, from 6 to 125 mgNO 3 -/L within the capture area, with 40 % of the samples exceeding the Québec drinking water limit of 45 mgNO 3 -/L. Nitrate pollution in the municipal well exceeded 45 mgNO 3 -/L during 2005, but no bacteriological contamination was observed. The results also show a high variability of nitrate concentration with depth within the capture zone. Electrical conductivity appears as a good indicator {{of the presence of}} nitrate and calcium ions in this capture zone. Correlations between nitrate, calcium and chloride suggest that these ions come from the same source of fertilizer. Nitrate isotopic composition suggests that nitrate in groundwater originates from both chemical and organic fertilizers. The bacteriological results show that the extracted volume of water during sampling of a piezometer has {{a significant impact on the}} bacteria count. The variability of <b>bacteriological</b> <b>pollution</b> is important in space and time, showing a higher contamination during summer. Only 2 % of the raw water samples exhibit contamination exceeding the drinking water standard for treated water. Total coliforms seem to be a good precursor of E. coli or enterococci contamination. Globally, the physico-chemical and bacteriological groundwater quality within the studied capture area and the pumping well shows contamination by nitrates, but low contamination levels by fecal bacteria.

40|$|In Ouagadougou {{and in many}} similar Sahelian cities, urban {{agriculture}} uses {{very often}} polluted water for irrigation of vegetables, including those {{that are likely to}} be eaten uncooked. As the pathogenic germs can survive long enough in water, soil and plants, this practice entails potential sanitary risks, particularly for farmers and their families. The potential of risks related to the use of sewage in agriculture is well known and sanitary instructions exist. However, there is no assessment of real risks within the context of sewage use on a small scale in small size plots, as it is the case in Ouagadougou, and common in Sahelian countries. The aim of the current thesis is to contribute {{to a better understanding of}} interactions between the environment and health. The specific objectives are: (i) - to assess incidence rates for diarrhoea In a period of two weeks and to assess prevalence rates for parasitic infections; (ii) - to assess relative risks and prevalence ratios among exposed groups and those of the population in general; (iii) - to assess levels of microbiological pollution of irrigation water, soils and vegetables; (iv) - to assess sociocultural factors and behavioural attitudes of the various actors; (v) - to assess environmental pollution at the level of residential areas; (vi) - to propose possible measures in order to reduce risks and to discuss their feasibility. The general approach that has been adopted is transdisciplinary, particularly with an epidemiological perspective associating microbiology, socio-anthropology, cartography and geomatics. The cartographical approach, with the assistance of geomatics made it possible (i) - to characterize residential areas in Ouagadougou according to pollution by refuse dumps and throwing out of sewage, (ii) - to locate market gardening sites in urban fabric, and (iii) - to assess the importance of exploited surfaces during the dry season, the cool season and the rainy season. Peripheral sectors are more polluted than central sectors. Variation in the total exploited surfaces between the cool season (December) and the dry season (April) is almost 85 %. Six areas of market gardening represent in all seasons more than 55 % of the total exploited surfaces. The majority of fanners in these 6 areas of market gardening live in 4 to 6 peripheral sectors (79 % in 1992, 90 % in 1995). The microbiological approach made it possible to monitor bacteriological (fecal coliforms) and parasitological (helminth and protozoan eggs) pollution in water, soils and plants. Water and soil samples have been taken in 4 market gardening areas which represent in all seasons between 49 and 56 % of the exploited surfaces in the city; plant samples have been taken in the 4 areas of market gardening and in the central market of Ouagadougou. 668 samples of irrigation water, 247 samples of lettuce, 48 samples of carrots and 218 samples of soils have been analyzed between October 1993 and December 1995. The levels of <b>bacteriological</b> <b>pollution</b> for all types of water, most of the time, are above the thresholds recommended by WHO for the watering of vegetables that are likely to be consumed uncooked (1000 FC/ 100 ml). Water from canals or channels (Abattoir and Canal Central sites) prove to be more polluted, both bacteriologically and parasitologically, than the one from wells and dams (Boulmiougou and Tanghin sites). Lettuce from both market gardening sites and market has a <b>bacteriological</b> <b>pollution</b> that is beyond sanitary thresholds (100 FC/ 100 g), with higher levels in the market. A proportion of at least 10 % of soil samples from paths are contaminated by parasites such as Ankylostomes, Ascaris and Anguillules. The market gardening sites which have the most polluted beds by parasites are those of Abattoir (79 % of samples) and Canal Central (75 %) which correspond to the sites with irrigation water that is also the most polluted. The socio-anthropological approach made it possible to gather ideas and beliefs of various actors in the chain of market gardening products (from producer to consumer) and to carry out direct observations about environmental factors as well as about practices in the various places in this chain. During the two years, 15 FGD (Focus Group Discussion) have been held with farmers, retailers, caterers and consumers. In 1995, 226 observations sessions have been held from 22 observation posts (5 market gardening sites, 3 markets, 3 caterers and 11 selected households). Whilst the environmental factors on market gardening sites are characterized by a high level of pollution, the behavioural attitudes of farmers during their activities, particularly walking barefoot, and expressed beliefs reveal a lack of awareness. The epidemiological approach made it possible to assess differences in incidence or prevalence rates between climatic seasons, between farmers and the general population, between market gardening sites, and between sexes, for diarrhoea, stomach aches and various parasitic infections. The data have been collected through households surveys and examinations in analysis laboratories of excreta and of households' drinking water. Three cross-sectional surveys with children as targets have been undertaken in 1994 (2 in the dry season and in the rainy season) and in 1995 (one at the end of the rainy season). Sample sizes were respectively 512, 599 and 3040 children aged between 0 and 4 full years and who have been weaned. During the third cross-sectional survey 208 adults, fathers or mothers of the surveyed children, have been also involved and water samples of 2996 households have been analyzed. A fourth cross-sectional survey dealt only with the group of market gardeners, with 191 adults, 97 children of farmers and 186 samples of households' drinking water. Differences are significant between the end of the rainy season and the two other seasons as far the diarrhoea and the main parasitic infections are concerned among the general population's children aged less than 5 years old. The incidence of two weeks' diarrhoea is very important in all seasons among the children of the general population (always > 30 %) as well as among the children of market gardeners at the end of the rainy season (37. 10 ± 9. 61 %). On the other hand, the incidence rate for two weeks' diarrhoea is low among adult farmers themselves at the end of the rainy season (6. 30 ± 3. 45 %). The group of farmers, both children and adults, have in a very significant way higher prevalence rates than those of the general population as far as Ankylostoma are concerned (10. 80 ± 6. 68 % against 1. 40 ± 0. 43 % among children; 40. 60 ± 7. 38 % against 14. 90 ± 5. 09 % among adults). The difference between men and women is very significant for Ankylostoma among market gardeners (48. 40 % against 30. 70 %, PR= 1. 58, p= 0. 03). The epidemiological approach also made it possible to carry out a case-control analysis of diarrhoea among children of the general population aged less than 5 years old. The final logistic regression model draws a significant association (p < 0. 05) between children's diarrhoea and 11 risk factors. These factors are related to either habitat conditions, or socio-economic conditions, or behavioural attitudes. The geomatic approach made it possible to disintegrate the main results of the epidemiological approach (as it has been done already for those of the cartographical approach) to present them at the sector level as thematic maps. The study leads to the formulation of recommendations in the area of (i) - actions and interventions; and (ii) - possibilities in research perspectives, regarding health and environment...|$|E
