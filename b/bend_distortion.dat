The positive value of elastic anisotropy of a semi-flexible LCP, Cl- 6, shows that <b>bend</b> <b>distortion</b> is favoured. The obvious variations of elastic anisotropy values measured {{from the different}} disclinations is probably related to the polydispersity of the polymer. The majority of disclination pairs showing random configurations indicate that that defect interactions are far from equilibrium in polymeric smectics. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{introduce}} {{the idea of}} transformation trajectories to describe the evolution of nematic shells in terms of defect locations and director field when the elastic anisotropy and the shell thickness heterogeneity vary. Experiments are compared to numerical results to clarify the exact role played by these two parameters. We demonstrate that heterogeneity in thickness {{is a result of}} a symmetry breaking initiated by buoyancy and enhanced by liquid crystal elasticity, and is irrespective of the elastic anisotropy. In contrast, elastic anisotropy [...] in particular, disfavored <b>bend</b> <b>distortion</b> [...] drives an asymmetric defect reorganization.

When the twist-anchoring is weak only at one of the surfaces, the critical thickness dc of the structure is affected by the saddle-splay elastic constant K 24. Moreover, if the twist-anchoring is weak at the external surface, a transition of the first order was found, dc playing the role of an order parameter. Such a transition, characterized by bistability and hysteresis, may be driven by K 24 and by the anchoring strength...|$|E
5000|$|PJTE versus Renner-Teller {{effect in}} <b>bending</b> <b>distortions.</b> Linear {{molecules}} are exceptions from the JTE, {{and for a}} long time it was assumed that their <b>bending</b> <b>distortions</b> in degenerate states (observed in many molecules) is produced by the Renner-Teller effect (RTE) (the splitting of the generate state by the quadratic terms of the vibronic coupling). However, recently it was proved (see in the review [...] ) that the RTE, by splitting the degenerate electronic state, just softens the lower branch of the APES, but this lowering of the energy is not enough to overcome the rigidity of the linear configuration and to produce <b>bending</b> <b>distortions.</b> It follows that the <b>bending</b> <b>distortion</b> of linear molecular systems is due to, and only to the PJTE that mixes the electronic state under consideration with higher in energy (excited) states. This statement is enhanced by the fact that many linear molecules in nondegenerate states (and hence with no RTE) are, too, bent in the equilibrium configuration. The physical reason for the difference between the PJTE and the RTE in influencing the degenerate term is that while in the former case the vibronic coupling with the excited state produces additional covalent bonding that makes the distorted configuration preferable (see above, section 2.3), the RTE has no such influence; the splitting of the degenerate term in the RTE takes place just because the charge distribution in the two states becomes nonequivalent under the <b>bending</b> <b>distortion.</b>|$|R
40|$|Warpage is {{a problem}} that {{frequently}} occurs in laser transformation hardening of precision parts. If, for example, the ball bearing tracks of a linear guiding rail are sequentially hardened with a single laser, this results in <b>bending</b> <b>distortion</b> and torsion of the rail. Afterwards the rail has to be straightened manually. This paper presents a multiple laser beam technique for solving this problem. A process controlling modular diode laser system is set up and used for hardening of the four ball bearing tracks of a precision linear guiding rail simultaneously. The diode laser system consists of up to ten modules. Each module is equipped with a pyrometer for temperature measurement and feed back control in each processing zone. By multiple beam technique the torsion of the guiding rail can be completely avoided.

Several experiments are performed under different conditions to identify the most favorable operating conditions for the preparation of blend (polyester/epoxy) resins. Optimum conditions, namely, mixing speed, mixing time, heating temperature and heating time are investigated and found experimentally as 500 rpm, 5 min, 75 0 C and 6 hr respectively. In addition, solid palms wastes (lignin) as reinforcement fibers is employed in order to improve the mechanical properties: impact strength, bending deflection and <b>bending</b> <b>distortion</b> of coated wood. The optimum ratio of prepared blend is characterized by the mechanical (impact and bending) tests of the untreated samples occurred at a ratio of polyester/epoxy resins of 0. 91 w/w.

40|$|The nematic twist-bend (TB) phase, {{exhibited}} by certain achiral thermotropic liquid crystalline (LC) dimers, features a nanometer-scale, heliconical {{rotation of the}} average molecular long axis (director) with equally probable left- and right-handed domains. On meso to macroscopic scales, the TB phase may {{be considered as a}} stack of equivalent slabs or "pseudo-layers", each one helical pitch in thickness. The long wavelength fluctuation modes should then be analogous to those of a smectic-A phase, and in particular the hydrodynamic mode combining "layer" compression and bending ought to be characterized by an effective layer compression elastic constant B_eff and average director splay constant K_ 1 ^eff. The magnitude of K_ 1 ^eff is expected to be similar to the splay constant of an ordinary nematic LC, but due to the absence of a true mass density wave, B_eff could differ substantially from the typical value of ∼ 10 ^ 6 Pa in a conventional smectic-A. Here we report the results of a dynamic light scattering study, which confirms the "pseudo-layer" structure of the TB phase with B_eff in the range ∼ 10 ^ 3 - 10 ^ 4 Pa.

Interest in warped galaxies has increased with the recognition that they are quite common: all three spiral galaxies in the Local Group are warped, and most edge-on disc galaxies appear to be warped to some extent (S'anchez-Saavedra et al. 1990, Bosma 1991). The high frequency of warps implies that they are either long-lived or repeatedly excited. Briggs (1990) summarized the characteristics of 12 isolated galaxies with HI warps.

40|$|Nanogenerators {{based on}} ZnO {{nanowires}} (NWs) realize the energy conversion at nanoscale, which are {{ascribed to the}} piezoelectric property caused by the lattice distortion of the ZnO NWs. The lattice distortion can significantly tune the electronic and optical properties, and requires a sensitive and convenient measurement. However, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) technique provides a limited sensitivity of 0. 01 nm on the variation of the lattice spacing and requires vacuum conditions.

The basic problem of aileron effectiveness and the interrelationship between structural distortion and the loads applied by the control surface is illustrated. A rigid wing/aileron surface will develop the capability to generate increased roll rates as airspeed increases. A flexible surface will become less effective as airspeed increases because of the twisting distortion created by the aft-mounted control surface.

40|$|The study's aim is {{to improve}} the {{applicability}} of finite element analysis to the prediction of welding distortions, with particular emphasis on out-of-plane deformations. Robust simulation strategies are established which take account of material properties and joint configurations, but are at the same time computationally efficient. This is achieved by reducing the full transient thermo-elastoplastic analysis to variants of an uncoupled thermal, elasto-plastic and structural treatment. A two-dimensional cross-section thermal model was used to establish thermal transients. The maximum temperatures, experienced at each node during the welding cycle, were then used to link the thermal welding strains to the elasto-plastic and structural response of the welded structures. Three efficient models have been identified that reduce the transient analysis to a simple multi-load-step analysis and these were applied to sample butt-welded plates. The simulation techniques are supported by full-scale welding tests on steel plates. The evolution of angular distortion can be treated simply through non-linear, stepwise, static analyses.

40|$|AbstractCold bending {{of glass}} {{involves}} the straining of relatively thin glass components, (typically plates), at ambient temperatures, {{and is a}} low energy and cost effective manner of creating curvilinear forms required in modern glass applications. Cold bending is also popular because it is thought to eliminate the optical imperfections in curved glass plates that arise during alternative and more conventional thermal bending techniques. Experimental and numerical investigations on the cold bending of monolithic glass plates into anticlastic shapes are undertaken and described in this paper. The aim is to characterise the cold bending behaviour during the bending process and to evaluate the surface/optical quality of the curved plates. Two distinct phenomena of interest are observed: (i) {{a change in the}} deformation mode that under particular boundary and loading conditions lead to snap-through buckling and; (ii) a local instability termed “cold bending distortion” that appears on curved plates when certain applied displacement limits are exceeded. This cold <b>bending</b> <b>distortion</b> is found to occur at stresses significantly below the fracture strength of the glass plate, but the distortions can be sufficiently large to breach optical serviceability requirements.

Here we investigate the internal dynamics of a 200 bp closed circular molecule with natural curvature using a newly developed normal-mode treatment of DNA in terms of neighboring base-pair “step” parameters. The intrinsic curvature of the DNA is described by a 10 bp repeating pattern of <b>bending</b> <b>distortions</b> at successive base-pair steps. We vary the degree of intrinsic curvature and the superhelical stress on the molecule and consider the normal-mode fluctuations of both the circle and the stable figure- 8 configuration under conditions where the energies of the two states are similar. To extract the properties due solely to curvature, we ignore other important features of the double helix, such as the extensibility of the chain, the anisotropy of local bending, and the coupling of step parameters. We compare the computed normal modes of the curved DNA model with the corresponding dynamical features of a covalently closed duplex of the same chain length constructed from naturally straight DNA and with the theoretically predicted dynamical properties of a naturally circular, inextensible elastic rod, i. e., an O-ring.

40|$|The {{extent to}} which in-situ global {{mechanical}} tensioning (GMT) {{can be used to}} modify the residual stress state in friction stir (FS) welds is investigated in this article. Residual stress distributions have been determined by synchrotron X-ray and neutron diffraction for four sets of FS welds in high-strength AA 7449 -W 51 and lithium containing AA 2199 -T 8 aerospace aluminum alloys subjected to a systematic range of GMT levels. For the cases studied, the results indicate that the level of residual stresses present in the as-welded state {{is a function of the}} alloy. The rate of residual stress reduction brought about by GMT, however, is basically alloy independent; indeed, it is essentially linear with respect to the GMT load, so that the tensioning required to reduce the weld stresses to zero can be calculated directly from the stresses present in the untensioned case. For thin plates, proximity to the yield stress in the hot-softened zone means that a guideline rule is that 1 MPa of tensioning during welding reduces the tensile stress by approximately 1 MPa. The GMT was found to be less effective at greater depths in thick plates. Furthermore, a reduction in <b>bending</b> <b>distortion</b> and an increase in angular distortion was observed with increased GMT, while no effects on the weld microstructure and hardness were observed...|$|R
