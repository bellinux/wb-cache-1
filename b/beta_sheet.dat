5|$|When {{bound to}} a protein, NAD and NADH are usually held within a {{structural}} motif {{known as the}} Rossmann fold. The motif is named after Michael Rossmann {{who was the first}} scientist to notice how common this structure is within nucleotide-binding proteins. This fold contains three or more parallel beta strands linked by two alpha helices in the order beta-alpha-beta-alpha-beta. This forms a <b>beta</b> <b>sheet</b> flanked by a layer of alpha helices on each side. Because each Rossmann fold binds one nucleotide, binding domains for NAD consist of two paired Rossmann folds, with each fold binding one of the two nucleotides of the cofactor. However, this fold is not universal among NAD-dependent enzymes, since a class of bacterial enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism have recently been discovered that bind the coenzyme, but lack this motif.|$|E

25|$|In general PDZ domains bind {{to a short}} {{region of}} the C-terminus of other {{specific}} proteins. These short regions bind to the PDZ domain by <b>beta</b> <b>sheet</b> augmentation. This means that the <b>beta</b> <b>sheet</b> in the PDZ domain is extended {{by the addition of}} a further beta strand from the tail of the binding partner protein.|$|E
50|$|KIAA1841 is {{primarily}} composed of alpha helices and <b>beta</b> <b>sheets.</b> Alpha helices comprise {{the majority of}} the protein, this is true for the DUF domain and both terminuses. The DUF domain has slightly less <b>beta</b> <b>sheets</b> compared to the protein as a whole and the C terminus has an even smaller amount of <b>beta</b> <b>sheets</b> comprising its secondary structure.|$|R
50|$|This protein domain {{contains}} both alpha helices and <b>beta</b> <b>sheets.</b> In particular, the <b>beta</b> <b>sheets</b> {{are arranged}} in an antiparallel formation. More specifically, it contains a beta grasp fold.|$|R
50|$|PROSER1 is {{composed}} primarily of alpha helices, <b>beta</b> <b>sheets,</b> and coils. The protein is largely coiled. The DUF {{is composed}} mainly of alpha helices and coils. It has slightly fewer <b>beta</b> <b>sheets</b> {{compared to the}} protein as a whole.|$|R
25|$|The {{most notable}} supersecondary {{structure}} is a five chain <b>beta</b> <b>sheet</b> that {{is composed of}} a β-meander and a β-α-β clockwise unit. It is present in both domains suggesting that the protein arose from gene duplication.|$|E
25|$|The Shikimate {{dehydrogenase}} substrate binding domain {{found at}} the N-terminus binds to the substrate, 3-dehydroshikimate. It {{is considered to be}} the catalytic domain. It has a structure of six beta strands forming a twisted <b>beta</b> <b>sheet</b> with four alpha helices.|$|E
25|$|In {{the absence}} of heparin, amino acids P14 and P15 (see Figure 3) from the {{reactive}} site loop are embedded within {{the main body of}} the protein (specifically the top of <b>beta</b> <b>sheet</b> A). This feature is in common with other serpins such as heparin cofactor II, alpha 1-antichymotrypsin and MENT.|$|E

25|$|The {{structure}} of human SUMO1 is depicted on the right. It shows SUMO1 as a globular protein with {{both ends of}} the amino acid chain (shown in red and blue) sticking out of the protein's centre. The spherical core consists of an alpha helix and a <b>beta</b> <b>sheet.</b> The diagrams shown are based on an NMR analysis of the protein in solution.|$|E
25|$|In general, this {{phenomenon}} will be exhibited in absorption bands of any optically active molecule. As a consequence, circular dichroism is exhibited by most biological molecules, {{because of the}} dextrorotary (e.g. some sugars) and levorotary (e.g. some amino acids) molecules they contain. Noteworthy as well is that a secondary structure will also impart a distinct CD to its respective molecules. Therefore, the alpha helix, <b>beta</b> <b>sheet</b> and random coil regions of proteins and the double helix of nucleic acids have CD spectral signatures representative of their structures.|$|E
25|$|In 1951, {{based on}} the {{structures}} of amino acids and peptides and the planar nature of the peptide bond, Pauling, Robert Corey and Herman Branson correctly proposed the alpha helix and <b>beta</b> <b>sheet</b> as the primary structural motifs in protein secondary structure. This work exemplified Pauling's ability to think unconventionally; central to the structure was the unorthodox assumption that one turn of the helix may well contain a non-integer number of amino acid residues; for the alpha helix it is 3.7 amino acid residues per turn.|$|E

25|$|The hinge {{region of}} {{antithrombin}} in the Figure 5 complex {{could not be}} modelled due to its conformational flexibility, and amino acids P9-P14 are not seen in this structure. This conformational flexibility indicates an equilibrium may exist within the complex between a P14 P15 reactive site loop inserted antithrombin conformation and a P14 P15 reactive site loop expelled conformation. In support of this, analysis of the positioning of P15 Gly in the Figure 5 complex (labelled in model B) shows it to be inserted into <b>beta</b> <b>sheet</b> A (see model C).|$|E
25|$|Cystatin C is a non-glycosylated, basic protein (isoelectric {{point at}} pH 9.3). The crystal {{structure}} of cystatin C {{is characterized by}} a short alpha helix and a long alpha helix which lies across a large antiparallel, five-stranded <b>beta</b> <b>sheet.</b> Like other type 2 cystatins, it has two disulfide bonds. Around 50% of the molecules carry a hydroxylated proline. Cystatin C forms dimers (molecule pairs) by exchanging subdomains; in the paired state, each half is made up of the long alpha helix and one beta strand of one partner, and four beta strands of the other partner.|$|E
25|$|Alpha sheet (also {{known as}} alpha pleated sheet or polar pleated sheet) is an {{atypical}} secondary structure in proteins, first proposed by Linus Pauling and Robert Corey in 1951. The hydrogen bonding pattern in an alpha sheet {{is similar to}} that of a <b>beta</b> <b>sheet,</b> but the orientation of the carbonyl and amino groups in the peptide bond units is distinctive; in a single alpha strand, all of the carbonyl groups are oriented in the same direction on one side of the pleat, and all of the amino groups are oriented in the same direction on the opposite side of the sheet. Thus the alpha sheet accumulates an inherent separation of electrostatic charge, with one edge of the sheet exposing negatively charged carbonyl groups and the opposite edge exposing positively charged amino groups. Unlike the alpha helix and <b>beta</b> <b>sheet,</b> the alpha sheet configuration does not require all component amino acid residues to lie within a single region of dihedral angles; instead, the alpha sheet contains residues of alternating dihedrals in the traditional right-handed (αR) and left-handed (αL) helical regions of Ramachandran space. Although the alpha sheet is only rarely observed in natural protein structures, it has been speculated to play a role in amyloid disease and it was found to be a stable form for amyloidogenic proteins in one set of molecular dynamics simulations. Alpha sheets have also been observed in X-ray crystallography structures of designed peptides.|$|E

25|$|His work on {{chemical}} bonding marks {{him as one}} of {{the founders}} of modern quantum chemistry. The Nature of the Chemical Bond was the standard work for many years, and concepts like hybridization and electronegativity remain part of standard chemistry textbooks. While his Valence bond approach fell short of accounting quantitatively for some of the characteristics of molecules, such as the color of organometallic complexes, and would later be eclipsed by the molecular orbital theory of Robert Mulliken, Valence Bond Theory still competes, in its modern form, with Molecular Orbital Theory and density functional theory (DFT) as a way of describing the chemical phenomena. Pauling's work on crystal structure contributed significantly to the prediction and elucidation of the structures of complex minerals and compounds. His discovery of the alpha helix and <b>beta</b> <b>sheet</b> is a fundamental foundation for the study of protein structure.|$|E
25|$|Silks {{derived from}} Bombyx mori are {{generally}} made of two parts: the silk fibroin fiber which contains a light chain of 25kDa {{and a heavy}} chain of 350kDa (or 390kDa) linked by a single disulfide bond and a glue-like protein, sericin, comprising 25 to 30 percentage by weight. Silk fibroin contains hydrophobic <b>Beta</b> <b>sheet</b> blocks, interrupted by small hydrophilic groups. And the beta-sheets contribute much to the high mechanical strength of silk fibers, which achieves 740 MPa, tens of times that of poly(lactic acid) and hundreds of times that of collagen. This impressive mechanical strength has made silk fibroin very competitive for applications in biomaterials. Indeed, silk fibers have {{found their way into}} tendon tissue engineering, where mechanical properties matter greatly. In addition, mechanical properties of silks from various kinds of silkworms vary widely, which provides more choices for their use in tissue engineering.|$|E
