40|$|<b>Hydrazine</b> <b>derivatives</b> {{are widely}} used in agriculture, in industry, as rocket propellants, and in medicine. Hydrazines also occur {{naturally}} in tobacco and mushrooms. Many hydrazines tested in animal studies appear to be carcinogenic and induce tumors in various target tissues in mice, hamsters, and rats. The use of <b>hydrazine</b> <b>derivatives</b> in humans is often complicated by adverse side-effects such as liver injury and rheumatoid arthritis. A {{number of studies have}} demonstrated that <b>hydrazine</b> <b>derivatives</b> are activated to reactive intermediates, such as free radicals, through a variety of cellular oxidative metabolic pathways. The aim of this work is to demonstrate the occurrence of free radical intermediates during the metabolic activation of various <b>hydrazine</b> <b>derivatives</b> and to characterize the enzymatic system(s) responsible for the activation to free radical species. The hydrazines studied are acetylhydrazine, isoniazid, isopropylhydrazine, iproniazid, methylhydrazine, 1, 1 -dimethylhydrazine, and 1, 2 -dimethylhydrazine. The model systems chosen are those of rat liver microsomes and isolated hepatocytes. Free radical intermediates have been demonstrated by the electron spin resonance spectroscopy coupled to spin trapping technique.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{demonstrates}} and validates {{the discovery of}} two novel <b>hydrazine</b> <b>derivatives</b> as selective dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) inhibitors. Virtual screening (VS) of publicly available databases was performed using virtual screening workflow (VSW) of Schrödinger software against DPP-IV and the most promising hits were selected. Selectivity was further assessed by docking the hits against homology modeled structures of DPP 8 and DPP 9. Two novel <b>hydrazine</b> <b>derivatives</b> were selected for further studies based on their selectivity threshold.

The binding poses were further validated by docking these ligands with different softwares (Glide and Gold).

40|$|International audienceReactive {{carbonyl}} compounds (RCC) generated by {{polyunsaturated fatty acid}} oxidation alter progressively cellular and tissular proteins by forming adducts on free amino groups and thiol residues (carbonyl stress). Carbonyl scavengers may neutralize RCC, but their protective effect in atherosclerosis has not been extensively studied. We report the carbonyl scavenger and antiatherogenic properties of <b>hydrazine</b> <b>derivatives,</b> namely hydralazine, an antihypertensive drug, isoniazid, an antituberculosis agent, and two antidepressants, phenelzine and iproniazid. These drugs were poorly efficient in preventing the oxidation of LDL mediated by smooth muscle cells (SMCs), but inhibited the toxicity of UV-oxidized LDL (oxLDL) and of 4 -hydroxynonenal (4 -HNE). <b>Hydrazine</b> <b>derivatives</b> prevented the formation of foam cells resulting from LDL oxidation in human macrophagic U 937 cells, and blocked the carbonyl stress in SMCs, by inhibiting the decrease in free amino group content, the increase in carbonylated proteins, {{and the formation of}} 4 -HNE adducts on PDGFR. Experimental studies carried out on apoE-/- mice supplemented with drugs (30 mg/L in drinking water) showed a significant carbonyl stress inhibition correlated with a net reduction of atherosclerotic lesion development. In conclusion, these data indicate that <b>hydrazine</b> <b>derivatives</b> exhibit carbonyl scavenger and antiatherogenic properties, which opens novel therapeutical approaches for atherosclerosis and its cardiovascular complications...|$|R
