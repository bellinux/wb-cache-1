40|$|Accelerating Moving Walkways (AMWs) are {{conveyor}} systems that accelerate pedestrians {{from a low}} speed {{at the entrance to}} a higher speed at the middle section, and then decelerate them to a low speed again at the exit. It is envisaged they can be a potential transport mode to fill the gap between short and moderate distance transport. However, present day AMWs are still relatively short, so there is no knowledge on the application and performance of these systems for longer distances. In comparison, long <b>bulk</b> material belt <b>conveyors</b> have been utilized for many years. Their application is made possible due to the distribution of power along the belt conveyor. Because moving walkways and belt conveyors have some similarities in their mechanism, the experience in developing long <b>bulk</b> material belt <b>conveyors</b> can be taken as analogy for developing long AMWs. Nevertheless, the two systems have different characteristics related to their different application and load, one for people and the other for bulk materials. This thesis aims to investigate the possibility of applying AMWs for moderate distance continuous people transport. In approaching this main research objective, we distinguish three main elements in the application of AMWs, i. e. the system itself, the passengers, and the location. The characteristics of each element and their interactions are analysed with respect to how they impose requirements and boundaries towards the application of AMWs, in general and in particular for moderate distance transport. Using a dynamic AMW belt conveyor model, simulations are carried out to study the dynamic behaviour and operating performance of long AMWs for single- and multiple-drive configurations, and for different operational stages, load conditions and control strategies.

40|$|This {{research}} paper investigates a new 3 D handling process in food industry: bin picking. Machines only function effectively when {{the input of}} product is physically well organised, well structured, and consistent. At many stages in a typical production line, foodstuffs are physically arranged as they move through a machine or equipment, however, this order is then lost again as products are ejected onto <b>conveyors,</b> <b>bulked</b> together into bins for transport, taken off-line for chilled storage. Bin picking is generally not solved for manufacturing parts. Unlike food ordering processes such as pick and place operations, vibratory feeders etc., this food handling operation has not been applied to food industry neither. A new approach is presented using the Microsoft KinectTM sensor and Active Shape Models. By combining the new device that obtains an RGB and RGB-D image and the flexible shape model, {{it is possible to}} identify non-uniform food products that have a high variation in shape. The methodology of this system is presented. The experiments show the achievability of this new system...|$|R
50|$|Conveyors {{are used}} when {{material}} {{is to be}} moved frequently between specific points over a fixed path and {{when there is a}} sufficient flow volume to justify the fixed conveyor investment. Different types of conveyors can be characterized by the type of product being handled: unit load or <b>bulk</b> load; the <b>conveyor’s</b> location: in-floor, on-floor, or overhead, and whether or not loads can accumulate on the conveyor. Accumulation allows intermittent movement of each unit of material transported along the conveyor, while all units move simultaneously on conveyors without accumulation capability. For example, while both the roller and flat-belt are unit-load on-floor conveyors, the roller provides accumulation capability while the flat-belt does not; similarly, both the power-and-free and trolley are unit-load overhead conveyors, with the power-and-free designed to include an extra track in order to provide the accumulation capability lacking in the trolley conveyor. Examples of bulk-handling conveyors include the magnetic-belt, troughed-belt, bucket, and screw conveyors. A sortation conveyor system is used for merging, identifying, inducting, and separating products to be conveyed to specific destinations, and typically consists of flat-belt, roller, and chute conveyor segments together with various moveable arms and/or pop-up wheels and chains that deflect, push, or pull products to different destinations.|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: The mining {{industry}} {{is characterized by}} the need for high volume of production which has forced its adoption of large and fast moving equipment for transporting <b>bulk</b> material. Belt <b>conveyors</b> have attained a dominant position in transferring material due to such inherent advantages as their economy of operation, reliability, versatility, and practically unlimited range of capabilities. With all of these factors comes an inherent danger. From 1995 to 2007 there have been a total of 534 equipment related fatal accidents in the United States as recorded by the Mine Safety and Health Administration, 50 of which are conveyor belt related. Most accidents around belt conveyors are caused by human error, improper maintenance procedures, lack of effective training or lack of awareness of possible hazards. To counteract this high number of accidents, virtual reality (VR) is being looked at as an alternative to current safety training programs. The structure and program being proposed consists of 4 steps in creating a two phased program. This paper discusses the step by step structure of creating a safety training program for belt conveyors and the first phase of implantation of the program. The first phase includes an instructional-based phase that allows for the presentation of the information compiled for the areas of training that were determined within the structure of the program. This paper will discuss the framework used in developing the VR safety training application, {{the first phase of the}} prototype development, how the data has been retrieved and organized, and how industry feedback was gathered and used to develop the application...|$|R
30|$|Analytical {{models have}} also been used to predict the {{drilling}} load [9, 14 – 20]. The analytical model of drill-soil interaction was developed using the screw conveyance theory and soil shear rupture principle. The analysis of the soil rupture {{is based on the}} passive earth pressure theory, which has successfully been used to predict the bulldozing force [21, 22]. According to the shape and cutting rake angle of the blade, different cutting models have been proposed to describe the soil rupture mechanism [23 – 26]. These theories {{can be used as a}} fundamental reference for modeling drill-tool interaction. The screw conveyance calculation, which is similar to the <b>bulk</b> solid screw <b>conveyor</b> design, can predict particle screw conveyance load and efficiency [27 – 29]. According to the screw diameters and the rotary speed of an auger, the centripetal force or the weight of particles are the main causes of auger conveyance [30, 31]. The rotary speed is always less than 300  r/min, and the diameters of the drill tool are generally limited below 50  mm in extraterrestrial exploration. For such orders of rotary speed and diameters, the weight of particles could be the main component that provides cuttings conveyance [30]. This study models the screw conveyance process based on a quasi-static analysis. In addition, in a significant number of previous works, the drill-soil interaction was simply divided into screw conveyance and soil cutting processes. The boundary conditions and soil mechanical property differences between these two processes were ignored in previous modeling of the drill-soil interaction. Thus, the calculated results, i.e., the summations of the screw conveyance load and soil cutting load, must either be further verified or only used in special situations.|$|R
40|$|Mining {{and mineral}} {{processing}} industries {{throughout the world}} rely on the efficient transportation of <b>bulk</b> solid. Belt <b>conveyors</b> {{have been used for}} the transportation of bulk solid over relatively short distances for many years, but with significant developments in analytical procedures to describe the dynamic properties of belt conveying systems, the utilisation of belt conveyors for long distance overiand transportation is becoming more economically viable. Belt conveyor installations are becoming progressively longer and belt speeds significantly faster, and as these trends continue it becomes increasingly important that the motion resistances associated with the operation of belt conveyors be minimised for optimum performance and efficiency. In the energy conscious world in which we live, no longer is it acceptable for a belt conveyor to simply transport bulk solid from one point to another, the operation must be economically viable, environmentally friendly and energy efficient. The energy consumed in raising bulk solid from one level to another is typically a parameter that cannot be easily changed, and is usually determined by plant constraints or the terrain over which the conveyor is travelling. As a result the primary area of focus in order to minimise power consumption is the resistances associated with the motion of the belt conveyor. The energy consumed during the operation of a long horizontal belt conveyor is primarily due to the frictional resistance that occurs {{along the length of the}} conveyor. This resistance is known as the main resistance and includes the belt and bulk solid flexure resistance, the rotating resistance of the idler rolls and the indentation rolling resistance of the conveyor belt. This paper will discuss each component of the main resistance and provide details of methods to calculate the contribution of each component. A finite difference solution that applies orthotropic plate mechanics is described to calculate the deflection of the conveyor belt due to the loading induced from the weight of the belt and bulk solid, and the loading induced from the relative movement of the bulk solid. Given the displacement of the belt and bulk solid the flexure resistance of each component can then be calculated. The rotating resistance of the idler rolls is briefly discussed and an apparatus to measure the resistance is presented. A finite element model is then discussed which calculates the indentation rolling resistance occurring at each idler set from the viscoelastic properties of the bottom cover of the conveyor belt...|$|R
