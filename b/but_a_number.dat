5|$|With {{the release}} of Age Ain't Nothing <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>Number,</b> rumors {{circulated}} of a relationship between Aaliyah and R. Kelly. Shortly after, there was speculation about a secret marriage with {{the release of}} Age Ain't Nothing <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>Number</b> and the adult content that Kelly had written for Aaliyah. Vibe magazine later revealed a marriage certificate that listed the couple married on August 31, 1994, in Sheraton Gateway Suites in Rosemont, Illinois. Aaliyah, who was 15 at the time, was listed as 18 on the certificate; the illegal marriage was annulled in February 1995 by her parents. The pair continued to deny marriage allegations, stating that neither was married. One particular allegation among the rumor was that Aaliyah wedded R. Kelly without her parents' knowledge.|$|E

5|$|The ships {{used the}} basic {{design of the}} Cerberus-class breastwork {{monitors}} to reduce design and construction time. Their hulls were completed very quickly, but the pace of building reduced as the likelihood of their immediate use diminished. They were delivered to the Royal dockyards in 1872 and commissioned for fitting out, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of years elapsed before that process was completed as little sense of urgency remained.|$|E
5|$|When Ronald Reagan's {{administration}} {{took power}} in 1981, the export restrictions {{put in place}} by the Carter administration were slowly relaxed. At first, the FX program continued as normal, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of events eroded the value of the program and limit the F-5G's potential sales. The signing of the 1982 US-PRC Joint Communiqué was a major agreement on arms sales, which continued blocking sales of the F-5G to Taiwan. By this point the Taiwanese had started their own light-fighter project, the AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-kuo. In signing the Communiqué, the U.S. was signaling that Taiwan would not receive modern aircraft, therefore the Ching-kuo became Taiwan's primary focus. As a result, the F-5G's sales potential remained unestablished.|$|E

5|$|A key {{criticism}} of the Act {{at the time as}} well as more recently is that the NIRA endorsed monopolies, with the attendant economic problems associated with that type of market failure. Even the National Recovery Review Board, established by President Roosevelt in March 1934 to review the performance of the NRA, concluded that the Act hindered economic growth by promoting cartels and monopolies. One of the economic effects of monopoly and cartels is higher prices—this was seen as necessary because the severe deflation of 1929–33 had depressed prices 20% and more. There is anecdotal evidence that these higher prices led to some stability in industry, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of scholars maintain that these prices were so high that economic recovery was inhibited. But other economists disagree, pointing to far more important monetary, budgetary, and tax policies as contributors to the continuation of the Great Depression. Others point out that the cartels created by the Act were inherently unstable (as all cartels are), and that the effect on prices was minimal because the codes collapsed so quickly.|$|E
5|$|Although plague was known, it {{was still}} {{sufficiently}} uncommon that medical practitioners might have had no personal experience of seeing the disease; medical training varied from those who had attended the college of physicians, to apothecaries who also acted as modern doctors, to simple charlatans. Other diseases abounded, such as an outbreak of smallpox the year before, and these uncertainties all added to difficulties identifying the true start of the epidemic. Contemporary accounts suggest cases of plague occurred through the winter of 1664/5, {{some of which were}} fatal <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of which did not display the virulence of the later epidemic. The winter was cold, the ground frozen from December to March, river traffic on the Thames twice blocked by ice, {{and it may be that}} the cold weather held back its spread.|$|E
5|$|At 12:50, a force {{comprising}} {{elements of}} the 121st and 125th Home Guard regiments and the 265th Reconnaissance-Sabotage Company managed to cross the Sava River at {{the confluence of the}} Sava and Una. The crossing force of 80 soldiers, encountered a minefield, VRS artillery fire and small arms fire from bunkers near the river bank. Extraction of the force began after 14:00, leading to an exchange of heavy artillery fire between the VRS on one bank and the 121st and the 125th Home Guard regiments' battlegroups on the other. The withdrawal required several river crossings using the available boats, and resulted in further losses. The situation was further complicated for the HV <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of incidents and factors. These included a tugboat towing a damaged amphibious vehicle which caught fire because of faulty wiring, insufficient fire support from river gunboats, and boat crews provided by the 34th Engineer Battalion who refused to cross the river against VRS fire and had to be replaced by conscripts of the 33rd Engineer Battalion. Despite HV use of unmanned aerial vehicles to locate the VRS guns as targets for counter-battery fire, the artillery exchange continued late into the night of 19/20 September.|$|E

5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1808, {{messages}} arrived in France from Martinique, outlining the desperate situation of their supplies, morale and economy. It was determined that reinforcements and food supplies would be sent and the frigate Thétis was despatched in November 1808. Within days, Thétis had been captured at the Action of 10 November 1808, and subsequent operations had mixed success: the frigate Amphitrite reached Martinique, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of smaller ships were intercepted and defeated, both in Europe and the West Indies. In desperation, a major operation was planned, intended to transport substantial supplies and sufficient troops to resist the inevitable British invasion on Martinique. To this end, Commodore Amable-Gilles Troude was provided with the ships of the line Courageux, Polonais and Hautpoult, with the frigates Félicité and Furieuse en flûte as armed storeships, carrying {{the bulk of the}} supplies.|$|E
5|$|Funds were {{scarce in}} the 1760s <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of {{improvements}} {{were made to}} the North Front defences and the sea wall from South Bastion to Europa Point, which was severely damaged by a great storm in 1766. Green spent several years reviewing the state of the fortifications and developing a plan to improve them. He sent a report to the Board of Ordnance in London in 1762 and another in 1768. The following year he travelled to London to present his conclusions to a commission appointed by William Pitt the Elder. He summed up his three principal aims as being to prevent a possible landing by sea; {{to improve the quality of}} the garrison and its provisioning; and to keep the enemy at a distance with artillery.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{development}} on WoA took place by porting code from Windows 7; Windows Mobile smartphones {{were used to}} test early builds of WoA {{because of lack of}} readily available ARM-based tablets. Later testing was performed using a custom-designed array of rack-mounted ARM-based systems. Changes to the Windows codebase were made to optimize the OS for the internal hardware of ARM devices, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of technical standards traditionally used by x86 systems are also used. WoA devices would use UEFI firmware, and have a software-based Trusted Platform Module to support device encryption and UEFI Secure Boot. ACPI is also used to detect and control plug and play devices and provide power management outside the SoC. To enable wider hardware support, peripherals such as human interface devices, storage and other components that use USB and I²C connections use class drivers and standardized protocols. Windows Update serves as the mechanism for updating all system drivers, software, and firmware.|$|E
