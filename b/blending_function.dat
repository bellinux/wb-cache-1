40|$|The {{development}} of patch test consistent quasicontinuum energies for multi-dimensional crystalline solids modeled by many-body potentials remains a challenge. The original quasicontinuum energy (QCE) has been implemented for many-body potentials {{in two and}} three space dimensions, {{but it is not}} patch test consistent. We propose that by blending the atomistic and corresponding Cauchy-Born continuum models of QCE in an interfacial region with thickness of a small number k of blended atoms, a general quasicontinuum energy (BQCE) can be developed with the potential to significantly improve the accuracy of QCE near lattice instabilities such as dislocation formation and motion. In this paper, we give an error analysis of the blended quasicontinuum energy (BQCE) for a periodic one-dimensional chain of atoms with next-nearest neighbor interactions. Our analysis includes the optimization of the <b>blending</b> <b>function</b> for an improved convergence rate. We show that the ℓ^ 2 strain error for the non-blended QCE energy (QCE), which has low order O(ϵ^ 1 / 2) where ϵ is the atomistic length scale, can be reduced by a factor of k^ 3 / 2 for an optimized <b>blending</b> <b>function</b> where k is the number of atoms in the blending region.

40|$|B-spline {{representation}} {{is one of}} the main methods for free-form surface modeling and has become the standard for CAD systems. However, in Virtual Reality (VR) environment, when a B-spline surface deforms, the <b>blending</b> <b>functions</b> need to be continuously computed. The high computational cost of continuously calculating the <b>blending</b> <b>functions</b> for merging, collision detection and physics-based deformation system, while the model is deforming, restricts the use of B-spline representation in a VR environment. This paper presents an alternative methodology to represent B-spline surface patches for an interactive VR environment. A uniformly discretized B-spline surface patch can be represented by a set of control points and two precalculated B-spline blending matrices. The proposed technique exploits the fact that these B-spline blending matrices are independent of the position of control points and therefore can be pre-calculated. The blending matrices enable the algorithm to merge B-spline surface patches, accurately check the collision, and generate nodes for the mass spring system to determine deformation using the physics-based model. This technique does away with the need to calculate computationally intensive <b>blending</b> <b>functions</b> for the Bspline surfaces, and inverse of large matrices during the run-time.
