2500|$|Banda was {{the only}} African ruler to {{establish}} diplomatic ties with South Africa during apartheid {{as well as the}} Portuguese regime in Mozambique. After the cabinet crisis in 1964, Banda became increasingly isolated in African politics. On the other hand, his antipathy for Roy Welensky and what he denounced as the [...] "stupid federation" [...] was a smokescreen he used to reject the proposed Bangula Hydro-electric dam – proposed to be bigger than the Gezira Dam in Khartoum – that Welensky's Federation had sought and obtained funding for from the British government. Banda went on to blame everything including snails (likely to cause widespread Bilharzias) to abort the project. In turn, the British denied Banda the funding and <b>budgetary</b> <b>support</b> he needed to build his pet dream of a new capital city at Lilongwe, in his home region. Hence he turned to South Africa – itself playing geo-political games in the region – which gave him a soft loan of 300 million rand. The quid pro quo was that Banda had to support South Africa's apartheid policies among fellow African leaders. Hence, on one occasion he paid a state visit to South Africa where he met his South African counterparts at Stellenbosch. Banda once noted that, [...] "It is only contact like this [...] that can reveal to your people that there are civilized people other than white..." [...] Banda's staunch anticommunism also influenced his decision to seek warm relations with South Africa.|$|E

40|$|With the {{improvement}} of relationship with the western countries after {{the demise of the}} old order regime of President Soekarno, Indonesia received a large volume of foreign aid that {{played a crucial role in}} the recovery of the economy. Indonesia remained a significant recipient of foreign aid through out the 1970 s and 1980 s, especially during the balance of payments crises. In addition to smoothing out balance of payments problems and providing <b>budgetary</b> <b>supports,</b> aid played an important catalyst for policy reforms that are believed to have contributed to the spectacular success of the Indonesian economy. However, no systematic study has been done so far on the effectiveness of foreign aid in Indonesia. This issue has become critical in the wake of the financial crisis of the late 1990 s which turned Indonesia a heavily aid-dependent country as well as the renewed world wide debate on aid effectiveness. This paper, thus, attempts to examine the historical significance and effectiveness of aid flows to Indonesia. It finds that aid did contribute positively to economic growth, but made the government lazy in terms of domestic resource mobilisation. As a result, despite significance progress, Indonesia remained aid-dependent. Foreign aid, economic growth, balance of payments, government fiscal behaviour. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyze the effect of budgetary participation on the performance of the officials of Regional Work Units (SKPD) with locus of control, job satisfaction, and relevant job information as mediating variables. The study was done on SKPD in Palu by survey using questionnaires. The sample consists of 40 people selected by using purposive sampling technique. Data were analyzed using multiple regressions and moderating regression analysis (MRA). The results show that budgetary participation significantly affects the performance of the SKPD in Palu. Locus of control (LoC) as a moderating variable does not strengthen the effect of budgetary participation on the performance of officials. Job satisfaction can mod-erate the effect of budgetary participation on the performance of officials. The results also reveal that relevant job information can moderate the performance of SKPD in Palu.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} budgetary participation on departmental performance via budget adequacy, organisational commitment and role ambiguity. The responses of 108 budget preparers and budget users drawn from a cross-section of Malaysian local authorities, to a questionnaire survey were analysed by using mediation analysis, path analysis and Pearson Product-Moment Correlation technique. The results suggest that budget adequacy, organisational commitment, and role ambiguity are important links in the process. The {{results of this study}} suggest that the relationship between budget participation and departmental performance is statistically, significantly, positively and marginally correlated. Of more interest was the finding that budget adequacy, organisational commitment, and role ambiguity are important intervening variables in the relationship between budget participation and departmental performance. The test for mediation effect, demonstrated that budget adequacy, organisational commitment, and role ambiguity had partially mediated the relationship of budget participation and departmental performance. These three variables act as partial mediators when they significantly reduced or decreased the path coefficient of budget participation and departmental performance rather than eliminating the relationship. Furthermore, the test for direct and indirect effect of budget participation on departmental performance, suggests that budget participation predicted or affected departmental performance more strongly in the indirect way than it did in a direct way. This suggests that, even though the correlation between budget participation and departmental performance was significant, the path interpretation suggests that the correlation arose because budget participation was correlated with other variables that have direct effect upon departmental performance not budget participation itself directly predicted departmental performance. Therefore, there is enough evidence to suggest that budget participation of budget preparers and budget users affects departmental performance of Malaysian local authorities indirectly via budget adequacy, organisational commitment and role ambiguity. Among the indirect effects, the link between budget participation, budget adequacy, organisational commitment, role ambiguity and departmental performance may be the most important in term of this study’s contribution. The decomposition of the observed correlation between budget participation, budget adequacy, organisational commitment and role ambiguity showed that budget 3 participation of budget preparers and budget users of Malaysian local authorities in the budget setting has direct effect on budget adequacy, organisational commitment and role ambiguity. Budget adequacy and organisational commitment was directly related. However, the relationship of role ambiguity and organisational commitment in this study was indirectly related. This suggests that participation of budget preparers and budget users in the budget setting of Malaysian local authorities lead to decrease role ambiguity that provide adequate <b>budgetary</b> <b>supports,</b> which lead to increase organisational commitment and thus enhance departmental performance. In relation to the strength of the relationships of the variables undertaken for the study, the overall relationships between variables are significant and positively related except that of role ambiguity relationship. The relationships of role ambiguity with budget participation, budget adequacy, organisational performance and departmental performance are negatively related.
