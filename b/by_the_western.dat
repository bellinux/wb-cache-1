5|$|Early in his {{political}} career, Piłsudski became {{a leader of}} the Polish Socialist Party. Concluding that Poland's independence would have to be won by force of arms, he created the Polish Legions.

When World War I broke out, he and his Legions fought under Austrian army control against Russia.

5|$|Feminism in Russia {{originated}} in the 18thcentury, influenced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> European Enlightenment and mostly confined to the aristocracy. Throughout the 19thcentury, the idea of feminism remained closely tied to revolutionary politics and to social reform. In the 20thcentury Russian feminists, inspired by socialist doctrine, shifted their focus from philanthropic works to organizing among peasants and factory workers. After the February Revolution of 1917, feminist lobbying gained suffrage and nominal equality for women in education and the workplace; however, in the 1960s and 1970s, women continued to experience discrimination in certain career-paths (including politics) as well as income inequality and a greater burden of household work. In spite of this, the concern with feminism waned during this period.|$|E

5|$|In the Soviet Union, {{both the}} Germans and the Soviets spent {{the spring and}} early summer of 1943 {{preparing}} for large offensives in central Russia.

This decision was partially affected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> Allies' invasion of Sicily launched on 9 July which, combined with previous Italian failures, resulted in the ousting and arrest of Mussolini later that month.
