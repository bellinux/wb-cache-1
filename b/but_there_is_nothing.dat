5|$|Martial {{reports a}} contest between an {{elephant}} and a bull, and the elephant, having won, knelt before Titus. This may have formed {{part of its}} training, but Martial attributed it to a spontaneous recognition of the Emperor's power. He also mentions a bull enraged by fires in the amphitheatre being tossed around the arena before being killed by an elephant, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> to indicate that these two epigrams {{are about the same}} events or repeated many times during the span of one hundred days of celebration.|$|E
5|$|Increasing general {{physical}} activity has been recommended, but no clear relationship to pain or disability {{has been found}} when used {{for the treatment of}} an acute episode of pain. For acute pain, low- to moderate-quality evidence supports walking. Treatment according to McKenzie method is somewhat effective for recurrent acute low back pain, but its benefit in the short term does not appear significant. There is tentative evidence to support the use of heat therapy for acute and sub-chronic low back pain but little evidence for the use of either heat or cold therapy in chronic pain. Weak evidence suggests that back belts might decrease the number of missed workdays, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> to suggest that they will help with the pain. Ultrasound and shock wave therapies do not appear effective and therefore are not recommended.|$|E

25|$|Rüstow and Köchly, {{writing in}} the 19th century, {{believed}} that Pelopidas led the Sacred Band out from the column to attack the Spartans in the flank. Hans Delbrück considered {{this to be a}} mere misreading of Plutarch. Plutarch does indeed describe Pelopidas leading the Band and catching the Spartans in disorder, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> in his account that conveys anything other than the Sacred Band being the head of the column, and the Spartans were disordered not because they were taken in the flank but because they were caught in mid-maneuver, extending their line.|$|E
25|$|The main {{difference}} between the Brazilian and Guyanese Wapishana is their rights to land. In Guyana, Amerindian villages are state elected administrative units <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> relating to the reservation system and villages are in remote areas. Although the situation of Guyanese Wapishana is better than most part of the Brazilian population of Wapishana, it is still far from perfect. Entirely, Amerindians are the least privileged group of Guyanese society. Among their problems are health and education, unfortunately the Rupununi region {{is one of those}} Amerindian populations that are particularly suffering from these problems, according to a study demonstrated by the ARU.|$|E
25|$|The Lorentz transformations have a {{mathematical}} property called linearity, since x and t are obtained as linear combinations of x and t, with no higher powers involved. The linearity {{of the transformation}} reflects a fundamental property of spacetime that we tacitly assumed while performing the derivation, namely, that the properties of inertial frames of reference are independent of location and time. In the absence of gravity, spacetime looks the same everywhere. All inertial observers will agree on what constitutes accelerating and non-accelerating motion. Any one observer can use her own measurements of space and time, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> absolute about them. Another observer's conventions will do just as well.|$|E

25|$|Yermolai Alexeievitch Lopakhin – a merchant. Lopakhin {{is by far}} {{the wealthiest}} {{character}} in the play, but comes from the lowest social class. This contrast defines his character: he enjoys living the high life, {{but at the same time}} is uncomfortably conscious of his low beginnings and obsession with business. He is often portrayed on stage as an unpleasant character because of his greedy tendencies and ultimate betrayal of the Gayev family, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> in the play to suggest this: he works strenuously to help the Gayevs, but to no avail. Lopakhin represents the new middle class in Russia, one of many threats to the old aristocratic way of doing things.|$|E
25|$|According to the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba, Amlaíb died around 874–875 in Dollar {{during a}} {{protracted}} campaign against Constantine I of Scotland. These deaths ushered in {{three decades of}} uncertainty for the Norse settlements in Ireland. Internecine conflict between the different factions weakened the colonies and {{made it easier for}} the Irish to unite against them. During this period most of the Norse colonies at Dublin, Wexford, Waterford, Cork and Limerick fell under the sway of native rulers, as the former allies of the Norsemen turned against them. It has even been claimed that Cerball mac Dúnlainge assumed the kingship of Dublin around this time (possibly with the consent of its Norse inhabitants), <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> in the Irish sources to support this.|$|E
25|$|Though the VCD {{technology}} can support it, most films carried on VCDs {{do not contain}} chapters, requiring the viewer to fast-forward to resume the program after playback has been stopped. This is mostly because VCD technology is able to start playback at a chapter point <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> to signal the player that the chapter has changed during a program. This can be confusing for the user as the player will indicate {{that it is still}} playing chapter 1 when it has played through to chapter 2 or later. Pressing the Next button would cause playback from the beginning of chapter 2. However, preview material is sometimes stored in a separate chapter, followed by a single chapter for the film.|$|E

500|$|In the mid-afternoon of 30 April, Hitler shot himself. After Hitler's suicide, Goebbels was depressed. Voss later recounted Goebbels as saying: [...] "It {{is a great}} pity {{that such}} a man is not with us any longer. <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> to be done. For us, {{everything}} is lost now {{and the only way}} out left for us is the one which Hitler chose. I shall follow his example." ...|$|E
500|$|Unemployed again, in December 1868 Hay {{journeyed to}} the capital, writing to Nicolay that he [...] "came to Washington in the {{peaceful}} {{pursuit of a}} fat office. <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> just now available". Seward promised to [...] "wrestle with Andy for anything that turns up", but nothing did prior to the departure of both Seward and Johnson from office on March 4, 1869. In May, Hay went back to Washington from Warsaw to press his case with the new Grant administration. The next month, due {{to the influence of}} his friends, he obtained the post of secretary of legation in Spain.|$|E
500|$|In the trial, Aylmer {{began the}} accusations of Marbury, saying [...] "you had rattled the Bishop of Peterborough," [...] to which Marbury accused {{the bishop of}} placing poorly trained ministers in the parish churches, adding that the bishops were poorly supervised. [...] Aylmer then retorted, [...] "The Bishop of Peterborough was never more overseen in his life than when he {{admitted}} thee to be a preacher in Northampton." [...] Marbury warned that for every soul damned {{by the lack of}} adequate preaching, the guilt [...] "is on the bishops' hands." [...] To this Aylmer replied, [...] "Thou takest upon thee to be a preacher, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> in thee. [...] Thou art a very ass, an idiot, and a fool." ...|$|E

500|$|The Kalpoe {{brothers}} were rearrested on August 26 {{along with another}} new suspect, 21-year-old Freddy Arambatzis. Arambatzis's lawyer said that his client was suspected of taking photographs of an underage girl and also of having inappropriate physical contact with the same girl. This incident allegedly occurred before the Holloway disappearance. Arambatzis's friends Van der Sloot and the Kalpoe {{brothers were}} supposedly involved in the incident. Van der Sloot's mother, Anita van der Sloot, stated, [...] "It's {{a desperate attempt to}} get the boys to talk. <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> to talk about." [...] While no public explanation was then made for the Kalpoe rearrests, Dompig later said that it was an unsuccessful attempt to pressure the Kalpoe brothers into confessing.|$|E
500|$|Later, in 1975, Hordern narrated Barry Lyndon, Stanley Kubrick's filmed {{adaptation}} of William Makepeace Thackeray's novel The Luck of Barry Lyndon. The critic John Riley, {{writing for the}} British Film Institute, thought that the actor provided [...] "a witty and ironic foil to the characters' helplessness". [...] The same year Hordern was asked to narrate 30 episodes of the children's animation series Paddington, {{which was based on}} the Paddington Bear book series by Michael Bond. In his 1993 autobiography, Hordern wrote of his enjoyment at working on Paddington and that he could not differentiate between his enjoyment in comedy and drama: [...] "it's a bit like difference between roast beef and meringue, both delicious in their way, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> more satisfying than a thousand people sharing their laughter with you".|$|E
500|$|The {{immediate}} {{descendants of}} Cináed were styled either as King of the Picts or King of Fortriu. They were ousted in 878 when Áed mac Cináeda {{was killed by}} Giric mac Dúngail, but returned again on Giric's death in 889. When Cínaed's eventual successor Domnall mac Causantín died at Dunnottar in 900, {{he was the first}} man to be recorded as rí Alban (i.e. King of Alba). Such an apparent innovation in the Gaelic chronicles is occasionally taken to spell the birth of Scotland, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> extant from or about his reign that might confirm this. Known in Gaelic as [...] "Alba", in Latin as [...] "Scotia", and in English as [...] "Scotland", his kingdom was the nucleus from which the Scottish kingdom would expand as the Viking influence waned, just as in the south the Kingdom of Wessex expanded to become the Kingdom of England.|$|E

Tilted on the edge of one foot he stood beside the fireplace, watching his mother grilling rashers; <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> in grilling, he thought, unless the Vision grilled. The limp rasher hung down between the bars of the gridiron like a cat in a child's arms; <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> in similes, unless She uttered them. He looked at the daylight shadows of a yellow hue, dancing with the firelight shadows in blue on the whitewashed chimney corner, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> in shadows.

500|$|Critics {{were also}} divided about the game's {{graphics}} and pacing. Destructoid stated that [...] "while detailed, most environments alternate between concrete gray and brick red." [...] GameSpot echoed {{criticism of the}} [...] "lack of visual variety." [...] IGN added that [...] "the world map and dungeons are crying for more detail." [...] Despite this, Destructoid allowed that [...] "the colorful clothing helps offset the game's otherwise limited palette." [...] IGN disliked the fact that [...] "large difficulty spikes are interjected every now and then" [...] and [...] "Resonance of Fate is built for those that enjoy the grind." [...] In contrast, the GameSpot reviewer liked {{this aspect of the}} game, [...] "You need to use every trick you have learned, and a few you may not have even realized yet, to tackle these treacherous monsters, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> quite as sweet as toppling something that has tormented you for so long." ...|$|E
500|$|The first {{definite}} {{mention of}} cricket in Sussex was in 1611 and relates to ecclesiastical court records stating that two parishioners of Sidlesham, now in West Sussex, {{had failed to}} attend church on Easter Sunday because they were playing cricket. They were fined 12 pence each and made to do penance, which meant confessing their guilt to the whole church congregation the following Sunday. The case {{is the first of}} several 17th century cricket references, until the Restoration in 1660, arising from Puritan disapproval of recreational activity, especially on Sundays. These references indicate that inter-parish matches were being played <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> to suggest that any teams representative of counties were formed before the Restoration. There is no evidence of large scale gambling or patronage prior to the English Civil War and it was those factors which drove the formation of [...] "representative" [...] teams in the 18th century. It must be concluded, therefore, that the cricket being played before the war was of minor standard only: i.e., village cricket.|$|E
500|$|TNM02067 is a damaged, partial left dentary [...] (lower jaw bone). It {{preserves}} much of {{the body}} of the bone, which is short and deep, but is broken along a vertical fracture behind the toothrow. There is another fracture in the front part of the jaw. The bone is 19.5mm (0.77 in) long and 11.4mm (0.45 in) deep. All the teeth are incomplete or absent, and lack both enamel and cementum, but what remains indicates that there was a large incisor at the front and five cheekteeth further back, separated by a diastema (gap) of about 2.5mm (0.098 in). On the labial (outer) surface of the dentary, there is one large mental foramen (opening). The mandibular symphysis, where the two halves of the lower jaw meet, is poorly preserved, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> to suggest that the left and right dentaries were fused. The lower margin of the bone is convex at the front, but concave further back, so that the depth of the dentary is 8.3mm (0.33 in) below the diastema, but only 7.0mm (0.28 in) below the third cheektooth. The origin of the coronoid process, a projection {{at the back of the}} dentary, lies far to the front.|$|E
