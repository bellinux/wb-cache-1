In natural language processing, the syntactic analysis of natural language input can vary from being very low-level, such as simply tagging each word in the sentence with a part of speech, or very high level, such as recovering a structural analysis that identifies the dependency between each predicate in the sentence and its explicit and implicit arguments.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Functionally {{gradient}} syntactic foams (FGSFs) are fabricated using a layer-over-layer integrated {{technique in}} five different layer sequences. Four {{different types of}} glass microballoons, with similar outer diameters but different inner diameters are used to fabricate individual layers in integrated FGSFs (IFGSFs). The volume fraction of microballoons in each IFGSF layer is kept constant at 60 % to maintain uniformity in the structure. The different layers of IFGSFs are integrated before major solidification takes place. IFGSFs are investigated for flat-wise and edge-wise compression properties on a MTS- 810 servo hydraulic machine. Compared to plain syntactic foams with a similar density, {{it is found that}} the energy absorption of flat-wise and edge-wise IFGSFs increase by more than 200 % and 20 %, respectively. Also, the IFGSFs show a dramatic increment in compressive properties compared to adhesively bonded FGSFs. Furthermore, IFGSFs are compared to one another to examine the effect of layer sequencing on flat-wise and edge-wise compressive behavior.

40|$|To my dear wife Åsa In {{complex and}} {{automated}} technological processes {{the effects of}} a fault can quickly propagate and lead to degradation of process performance or even worse to a catastrophic failure. This means that faults have to be found as quickly as possible and decisions have to be made to stop the propagation of their effects and to minimize process performance degradation. The behavior of the process is affected in different ways by different faults and the fault can be found by ruling out faults for which the expected behavior of the process is not consistent with the observed behavior. In model-based diagnosis, a model describes the expected behavior of the process for the different faults. A device for finding faults is called a diagnosis system. In the diagnosis systems considered here, a number of tests check the consistency of different parts of the model, by using observations of the process.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The contact areas {{between the}} {{articular}} {{surfaces of the}} talus and tibia are essential for understanding the mobility of the ankle joint. The purpose of our study was to reveal the contact area among the superior articular surface of the trochlea tali (target surface T) and the inferior articular surface of the tibia (query surface Q) under non–weight-bearing conditions in plantar flexion and dorsiflexion. Twenty cadaveric foot specimens were dissected and scanned by a three-dimensional (3 D) laser scanner to obtain data point sets. These point sets were triangulated and a registration procedure performed to avoid any intersection of the two joint surfaces. For all points of the query surface Q, the closest distance to T was measured. In 11 of the 20 ankle joints, the contact area was larger in plantar flexion, in 5 it was nearly of equal size, and in 4 the two surfaces were found in a better congruence in dorsiflexion. The two articular surfaces can be in point or line contact and cause different motions while T is gliding on Q, so the original geometry of ligaments must <b>be</b> <b>carefull...</b>|$|E

The main sources of uncertainty in practical usage of calibration results are discussed. The comparison {{of the results of the}} reciprocity primary calibration, step-force and reciprocity calibration with broadband-pulse excitation method is presented. The shape of calibration characteristics agrees well up to 300 kHz. The calculation of the uncertainty in all the calibration methods is described. The problem of propagation of uncertainty in the fast Fourier algorithm was solved. Uncertainty of measurement by primary calibration is determined and the influence of main sources to the uncertainty is given. Piezoelectric AE sensor PAC UT 1000 was used as the sensor under test. The big influence on uncertainty in reciprocity calibration was the influence of remounting sensor under test and pair sensors.

40|$|Object of the study: Euthanasia {{continues}} to be an issue of moral debate in end of life care. As the general practitioner has a central role in performing and co-ordinating en-of-life home care in the Netherlands, he is regulartly confronted with patients requesting (information on) euthanasia. The research question of this paper is: how do general practitioners and their patients experience communication on euthanasia? Method: In a qualitative research design, we interviewed 15 terminally ill patients and their 15 GPs. Data were analysed inductively and separately by the first two authors. Results: Initiative in communication on euthanasia was for GPs and their patients an important concept. GPs left the initiative of communication to the patient {{and in the course of}} their illness most patients raised this topic themselves. Direct communication on euthanasia was not always necessary, when they had exchanged views on related issues like religion. Other emerging concepts were: the support patients experience by communication about end of life decision making, accessibility of GPs and communication between GPs and other care providers. Conclusion: Discussing euthanasia seems to be a way to talk about the possibilities of palliative care as much as the first step in a medical end of life decision. This study suggests that the possibility to talk about euthanasia offers GPs and patients the opportunity to discuss problems and wishes more openly and directly GPs <b>are</b> <b>carefull</b> in raising the subject of euthanasia.

40|$|The {{practice}} of employing experimental design methods for operational test within ACC {{has now become}} standard procedure. For training, all wing test engineers and operations analysts attend 3 one-week short courses in applied statistics and design of experiments, followed by mentored on-the-job training within their units. Statistically-based testing strategies allow risks associated with incorrect decisions (e. g. fielding an incapable system) to be quantified so that the tests can be right sized. Statistical modeling and analyses uncover not only the parameters impacting and not impacting performance, but also reveal the frequently influential parameter two-factor interactions. Although standard, classical textbook methods are applicable and readily applied, the nature of operational test mandates that techniques not typically covered in a design of experiments course {{be used in a}} variety of conditions in many types of operational tests. One of these advanced methods most commonly demanded by test teams are designs adequate for restrictions on randomization.

40|$|In this paper, I {{analyze and}} give a {{critical}} examination of some basic issues of religious pluralism by reference to the mystical philosophy of Muhyi al-Din Ibn al ‘Arabī, who thought that various religious beliefs are to be considered as an outcome of different forms of the divine manifestation.

In mean gradiant way, the gradiant of diffusion coefficient was smaller than that of the rule of 4 / 3 (by Richardson), and the diffusion coefficients were 1. 4 × 105 cm 2 /sec in Omura Bay and 1. 6 × 105 cm 2 /sec in Sasebo Bay at 900 m-scale.
