5|$|Philosopher John Searle {{argues that}} Watson—despite {{impressive}} capabilities—cannot actually think. Drawing on his Chinese room thought experiment, Searle claims that Watson, like other computational machines, is capable only of manipulating symbols, <b>but</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> {{ability to understand}} the meaning of those symbols; however, Searle's experiment has its detractors.|$|E
5|$|The American loss is uncertain. Theodore Savas and J. David Dameron give a {{range of}} 150-500 killed, wounded and captured. Samuel Roads numbers the {{casualties}} of 47 killed and 70 wounded. Henry Dawson estimates 50 killed, 150 wounded and 17 missing for McDougall's and Spencer's commands <b>but</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> information on the losses in Haslet's regiment.|$|E

5|$|Wind {{power is}} capital intensive, <b>but</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> fuel costs. The price of wind power is {{therefore}} much {{more stable than}} the volatile prices of fossil fuel sources. The marginal cost of wind energy once a station is constructed is usually less than 1-cent per kW·h.|$|E
5|$|Bottom-dwelling and inactive, {{the tiger}} {{catshark}} feeds {{on a wide}} variety of fishes and invertebrates from on or near the sea floor. An oviparous species, the female retains her eggs internally until the embryos are at an advanced state of development, resulting in a relatively short hatching time after laying. Between 12 and 22 encapsulated eggs are produced at a time, which the female attaches to the bottom. The tiger catshark is caught incidentally by commercial and recreational fishers <b>but</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> economic value. It has been listed as Data Deficient by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), pending more information.|$|E
5|$|Doggett {{is taken}} to the local jail, where he meets a fellow {{prisoner}} named Domingo. Domingo is eventually freed and offers to have Doggett bailed out as well, {{under the condition that}} Doggett help him perform his criminal tasks. Doggett agrees, but changes his mind once he is released. Nestor, Domingo's friend, pulls a gun, but Doggett quickly overpowers him and takes the weapon. Doggett returns to the warehouse in hopes of finding clues to his identity. From time to time, he experiences flashbacks of his wife and son, <b>but</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> idea who they are.|$|E

5|$|Non-aposematic {{species have}} often evolved {{to mimic the}} {{conspicuous}} markings of their aposematic counterparts. For example, the hornet moth is a mimic of the yellowjacket wasp; it resembles the wasp, <b>but</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> sting. A predator which avoids the wasp will to some degree also avoid the moth. This is known as Batesian mimicry, after Henry Walter Bates, a British naturalist who studied Amazonian butterflies {{in the second half}} of the 19th century. Batesian mimicry is frequency dependent: it is most effective when the ratio of mimic to model is low; otherwise, predators learn to recognise the impostors.|$|E
5|$|Santosh {{is shocked}} knowing that Hasini has {{revealed}} all his mischievous activities and berates her often for being childish. Hasini worries {{and decides to}} leave Santosh’s home even before the one-week time given to her. She apologises to everyone in Santosh’s home and says {{that she is not}} the one fit for him and his family. Santosh is worried seeing this <b>but</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> option rather than staying calm as even Subramaniam did not like Hasini.|$|E
5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{can be used}} to help verify an identification of L.holopus. A drop of ammonium hydroxide solution turns the cap cuticle a pinkish color, <b>but</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> reaction with the flesh. A drop of dilute potassium hydroxide (KOH) has no reaction on the cap surface, and either no reaction or a brownish reaction with the flesh. Application of iron (II) sulphate solution does not have a reaction on the cap surface, and either no reaction to slightly olive coloration on the flesh.|$|E

5|$|The Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA) {{consists}} of the City of Toronto, the City of Hamilton, and the surrounding Regions of Halton, Peel, York and Durham. GO Transit also reaches beyond the GTHA into Niagara and Waterloo Regions, the city of Brantford and Peterborough, Simcoe, Dufferin and Wellington Counties. Under the provincial charter, GO Transit is permitted to serve cities elsewhere in Ontario, <b>but</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> plans of doing so.|$|E
5|$|Various {{chemical}} color {{tests can}} be used to help identify fruit bodies suspected to be S.amygdalinus. A drop of dilute potassium hydroxide (KOH) will turn the cap flesh dingy orange, while it turns the cap cuticle red, or darker. Ammonia (as ammonium hydroxide, NH4OH) produces a dingy yellow on the flesh, and brown on the cap. Iron sulphate (FeSO4) produces either no change to a pale grey color with both the flesh and the cuticle. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) causes the flesh to turn orange or pink, <b>but</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> color reaction with the cuticle.|$|E
5|$|After {{entering}} Middlesex County, Route 18 continues {{north as}} a freeway, entering Old Bridge Township. After interchanging with U.S. Route 9 (exit 30), the freeway ends, and the route becomes an arterial highway through a mostly wooded commercial stretch of Old Bridge. The route crosses several roads in this area. It then passes under County Route 516 and County Route 527 (Old Bridge-Matawan Road), <b>but</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> northbound interchange {{to connect with}} them; motorists have to travel through a residential area to access these roads. On the southbound side, motorists can use a cloverleaf or Englishtown Road. Route 18 then enters East Brunswick, then interchanging with Middlesex County Route 615, which also connects to County Route 527.|$|E

5|$|As Raskolnikov and Porfiry {{continue}} to meet, Raskolnikov's motives {{for the crime}} become exposed. Porfiry becomes increasingly certain of the man's guilt, <b>but</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> concrete evidence or witnesses with which to back up this suspicion. Furthermore, another man admits to committing the crime under questioning and arrest. However, Raskolnikov's nerves {{continue to}} wear thinner, and he is constantly struggling {{with the idea of}} confessing, though he knows that he can never be truly convicted. He turns to Sonya for support and confesses his crime to her. By coincidence, Svidrigaïlov has taken up residence in a room next to Sonya's and overhears the entire confession. When the two men meet face to face, Svidrigaïlov acknowledges this fact, and suggests that he may use it against him, should he need to. Svidrigaïlov also speaks of his own past, and Raskolnikov grows to suspect that the rumors about his having committed several murders are true. In a later conversation with Dunya, Svidrigaïlov denies that he had a hand in the death of his wife.|$|E
5|$|English {{remains an}} active second language, with its use allowed for some {{official}} purposes under the National Language Act of 1967. In Sarawak, English is an official state language alongside Malaysian. Historically, English was {{the de facto}} administrative language, with Malay becoming predominant after the 1969 race riots (13 May Incident). Malaysian English, also known as Malaysian Standard English, {{is a form of}} English derived from British English. Malaysian English is widely used in business, along with Manglish, which is a colloquial form of English with heavy Malay, Chinese, and Tamil influences. The government discourages the use of non-standard Malay <b>but</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> power to issue compounds or fines to those who use improper Malay on their advertisements.|$|E
5|$|Jack Stanley is disinherited by his father, Lord Stanley, {{because he}} refuses to marry his cousin, Lady Maude. Jack emigrates to America, <b>but</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> money and has no job upon which to sustain himself. While pondering his actions, he {{witnesses}} a trio of riders approach and speak to him. He accepts a position as a groom for a wealthy American, but he {{falls in love with}} his daughter, Ann. When her father learns of this, he dismisses Jack and Ann says she will never marry anyone but him. Meanwhile, Lord Stanley has come to forgive his son and decided to reinstate him in his will. No sooner has the task been completed does Lord Stanley suddenly dies.|$|E

5|$|Mr. Burns reveals to Smithers that {{he misses}} his {{cherished}} bear Bobo and desperately wants it back <b>but</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> idea where it is. Another flashback reveals Bobo's history: after Mr. Burns leaves it behind, the bear eventually {{finds its way}} to Charles Lindbergh, who tosses the bear into a crowd, where it is caught by Adolf Hitler. In 1945, Hitler blames Bobo for losing World War II and tosses him away. Bobo is seen again in 1957 on board the USS Nautilus headed for the North Pole. Bobo becomes encased in a block of ice until picked up by an ice-gathering expedition in 1993. The bag of ice with Bobo in it {{is sent to the}} Kwik-E-Mart in Springfield. Bart buys the bag of ice, finds Bobo inside and gives it to Maggie to play with.|$|E
5|$|The {{motorway}} {{consists of}} two traffic lanes and an emergency lane in each driving direction, separated by a central reservation. All intersections of the A3 motorway are grade separated, and the motorway comprises several large stack and cloverleaf interchanges at junctions with four other motorways in Croatia: A1, A2, A4 and A5. As of October 2010, another cloverleaf interchange is under construction on the A3 route, where the A11 motorway is scheduled to branch off. The route comprises {{a large number of}} bridges and culverts, <b>but</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> tunnels because it runs through plains. The Sava River Bridge is the most significant structure on the A3. Currently, there are 21exits and 18rest areas operating along the route. A large part of the motorway is tolled using a ticket system; one section uses an open toll collection system. The Zagreb bypass sections are not tolled. The toll is charged according to vehicle classification in Croatia. The A3 motorway is operated by Hrvatske autoceste.|$|E
5|$|The second film, The Only Girl in Camp, {{focuses on}} Trapper Gates's daughter, {{who is the}} only woman in the mining camp. Three ruffians come across the camp and plan to rob the miners. The leader, Bill, announces himself as Professor Watson and says he will give a lecture on {{locating}} gold deposits in the town hall. All the miners are lured to the building, save the girl, and Bill's accomplices proceed to rob the men. She realizes that this meeting is unusual and goes to the town hall and witnesses the robbery, <b>but</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> way of reporting or stopping the three armed men. Struck with an idea, she returns home for her father's bear traps and sets them on the steps of town hall. The robbers back out of the town hall and step into the traps, where they are captured.|$|E
