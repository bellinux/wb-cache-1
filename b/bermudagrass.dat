40|$|With {{a summer}} noted for {{extended}} periods of temperatures over 100 °F, 2000 put turfgrass in our state through quite a test. As we enter the 2001 growing season, it's clear that some warmseason grasses were adversely affected by a cold winter. There is no rest for the weary attempting to growing quality turf in Kansas. This publication contains results of projects done throughout 2000 by K-State turfgrass researchers. You can see many of these projects in progress on August 2, 2001, at the Kansas Turfgrass Field Day at the John C. Pair Horticultural Research Center, Wichita. What questions can we answer for you?

40|$|<b>Bermudagrasses</b> (Cynodon spp.) {{are genetically}} and morphologically diverse warm-season {{species that are}} {{valuable}} for turf and forage. Diverse accessions of Cynodon are preserved in various germplasm banks in Asia, Europe, and the United States. However, the extent of genetic and ecological diversity within Australia has not been previously explored and characterized. To address this issue, a broad-scale collection of Cynodon germplasm across Australia was recently conducted. A core collection was generated from this resource to optimize its utilization in breeding and research. Genetic diversity of 690 Cynodon accessions was characterized using 16 expressed sequence tag (EST) -simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. The mean number of alleles generated was 7. 44 per marker. Genetic data was combined with passport, ploidy level, morphological, and experimental performance data to generate a core collection using a directed stratified sampling method. The core collection comprised 13 % of the source germplasm and captured 96 % of the allelic diversity. Redundancy within the core collection was avoided with all accessions representing unique genotypes. This core collection will facilitate the future use of Australian germplasm in Cynodon breeding, genomics, conservation, taxonomy, and phylogeographical research...|$|R

50|$|This {{species is}} similar to {{southern}} crabgrass (Digitaria ciliaris), but with fewer, narrower inflorescence branches. It is also similar to <b>bermudagrass</b> (Cynodon dactylon), but with shorter, wider leaves which are more blue in color.|$|E
50|$|Nymphs feed {{on various}} grasses (including centipedegrass, <b>bermudagrass</b> and corn) from within foam (consisting {{of their own}} spittle) {{produced}} from juices of their host plant. Adults feed on hollies {{on the underside of}} the leaves.|$|E
50|$|Larvae {{are green}} to brown, {{freckled}} with darker; {{the lines are}} obscure; the dorsal line is almost lost in a dark clouding; subdorsal lines are plainer, with the upper edge diffuse; the lateral and spiracular lines are white.The larva feeds on various grasses, especially <b>bermudagrass.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Little {{is known}} about the life cycle of Atherigona reversura, nevertheless, it has been {{reported}} that the eggs are laid in the underside of the leaf in <b>bermudagrass.</b> After 2.5 days the larva emerge and move to the node where the stem emerges. The larva feed from the node causing the death of the leaf. After 1 to 3 days the feeding damage is evident, the larvae leave the stem, and move to the ground for pupation, where after 7 or 10 days the flies emerge. Adult flies can survive approximately 21 to 28 days producing many offspring during its adult life,. The populations of the <b>bermudagrass</b> stem maggot increase from south to north gradually, with populations picking up in mid-June in Central Florida and late July in North Georgia. In general all the <b>bermudagrass</b> cultivars have been susceptible to stem maggot damage, but cultivars with high number of shoots, small shoot diameter and narrow leaves show higher preference by the fly. Currently the recommendations to suppress infestations in the crops are to harvest the grass to help break the life cycle and to apply pyrethroid insecticides after grass regrowth, approximately 7 to 10 days after cutting, [...] Current research focuses on improving understanding of the behavior, biology and ecology of this insect pest.|$|E
50|$|Threats to this {{endangered}} species include habitat loss as its range is consumed for development and oil exploration.

Today, Z. japonica {{has become one of}} the most widely used species of turfgrass in the United States, serving as a close alternative to <b>bermudagrass.</b>|$|E
50|$|This is a {{perennial}} grass with rhizomes and/or stolons. The stems grow 10 to 79 centimeters tall. The leaf blades are 10 to 19 centimeters long {{and may be}} hairless to slightly hairy. They are usually blue-green in color. The panicle is usually a pair of branches up to 7.9 centimeters long; there is sometimes a third branch below the pair. The branches are lined with oval to lance-shaped spikelets which grow pressed against the branches, making the panicle narrow. This species is similar to <b>bermudagrass.</b> It spreads by its rhizomes and stolons, forming a thick turf.|$|E
5000|$|The {{artificial}} {{surface was}} used through the 1993 season, {{the last game}} on the surface being a 62-14 win over Vanderbilt.

The turf was replaced with natural grass the following year, with the checkerboard end zones and midfield logo retained. In 1998, the interlocking [...] "UT" [...] was replaced with the same Power T logo as seen on the football helmets. Since 2007, the entire surface gets re-sodded annually with Tifway <b>bermudagrass,</b> which rests on a 12-inch bed of sand to enhance drainage.|$|E
5000|$|A {{distinctive}} {{feature of the}} ground is the Miguel Dasso Tower on its northern side, which contains luxury boxes; it was most recently renovated in 2004. The Estadio Nacional has a natural <b>bermudagrass</b> pitch. It was, from 2005 to 2011, the only national stadium in CONMEBOL to have artificial turf, which was installed for the 2005 FIFA U-17 World Championship. The stadium was during this period one of Peru's four [...] "FIFA Star II" [...] grounds, the highest certification granted to artificial pitches, but the synthetic turf was blamed for players' injuries, such as burns and bruises.

5000|$|This grass {{has been}} bred into cultivars {{which are used}} for golf course turf and other {{landscaping}} projects. It forms a higher quality turf than <b>bermudagrass</b> in poor conditions, such as wet soils and low light levels, and with fewer nitrogen soil amendments. It can grow in lawns that receive rain on 250 days per year, and it can survive being waterlogged or submerged for several days at a time. It tolerates foot traffic. The main advantage of this grass {{is that it is}} very salt-tolerant. It can be irrigated with non-potable water, such as greywater, an important advantage in a time when there are increasing restrictions on water use. The grass can even be irrigated with saltwater. The grass will be lower in quality than that irrigated with potable water, but it survives. This species has [...] "filled a niche in America", being a better grass to use on turf next to the ocean in places that receive sea spray. [...] "It has the highest salt tolerance of all turfgrasses." [...] It is also more competitive against weeds than similar grasses. Weeds can be controlled by the application of saltwater, in which weeds will die and the grass will survive.|$|E

40|$|<b>Bermudagrass</b> (Cynodon spp.) golf {{greens are}} usually overseeded {{in the fall}} with cool-season grasses {{throughout}} the southern United States to maintain a dense, green turf while <b>bermudagrass</b> is dormant. However, the overseeded grass can delay transition back to the <b>bermudagrass</b> monostand the following spring and early summer. Spring management practices of reducing mowing height, delaying fertilization, and reducing soil moisture (Bruneau et al. 1985; Meyers and Horn 1970; Palmertree 1975) influence the transition of cool-season grass to <b>bermudagrass.</b> However, the response from vertical mowing and coring has not been consistent (Bruneau et al. 1985; Mazur and Wagner 1987). The success of management programs often depends on weather conditions and timing of cultivation treatments. Because results from the management practices vary, a herbicide that would gradually reduce the cool-season grass and permit normal <b>bermudagrass</b> growth during the transition period would be desirable. A uniform turfgrass cover must be maintained during the transition from overseeded ryegrass to <b>bermudagrass</b> in spring and early summer. When ryegrass dies faster than <b>bermudagrass</b> can fill in, the transition is poor. Ideally, the cover of <b>bermudagrass</b> should increase {{at the same rate}} that the cover of ryegrass decreases. For a herbicide to be effective, it must gradually remove ryegrass from th...|$|E
