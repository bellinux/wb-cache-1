40|$|Borehole {{waves are}} {{strongly}} affected by adjacent porous zones or by fractures intersecting the borehole. A theoretical description for both porous and fracture zones is possible {{based on the}} introduction of an effective borehole fluid bulk modulus, characterizing the wave attenuation via borehole wall impedance. This impedance can be calculated for both porous and fracture zones adjacent to the borehole, thus predicting borehole wave attenuation, transmission, and reflection over such zones. A shock tube setup generates <b>borehole</b> <b>tube</b> waves that are used for porous and fracture zone characterization. A PVC sample is used to introduce and vary fractures in a cylindrical sample. Shock wave experiments show that attenuation in boreholes adjacent to porous zones can be predicted by theory. The transmittivities of a <b>borehole</b> <b>tube</b> wave over 1 and 5 ?mm fractures are correctly predicted, thus showing the potential of borehole wave experiments for fracture detection and characterization.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{synthesize}} the most important results of the thesis work of Meredith (1990) concerning radiation from seismic sources in boreholes. Previous studies of radiation from sources in boreholes have been far-field studies and have neglected the explicit contribution of the borehole. In general, this is fine for P-wave radiation and for S-wave radiation into high velocity rocks. However, tube waves "leak" shear conical waves (Mach waves) which propagate when the tube wave velocity is greater than the shear wave velocity of the surrounding medium. These Mach waves are of high amplitude because of the dominance of the tube wave and radiate away from the borehole in a fixed conical shape. The shape of the cone is dependent on the shear wave velocity of the medium and the tube wave velocity. This paper defines the conditions under which these Mach waves exist and thoroughly describes them in a physical sense and less so in a mathematical sense. Finally, the relationship of Mach waves to data sets is examined and how Mach waves may be confused with receiver <b>borehole</b> <b>tube</b> waves. To keep the presentation simple, radiation from axial or torsional sources or radiation from empty boreholes is omitted in this paper but fully addressed in Meredith (1990).

40|$|Natural or {{hydraulic}} fractures are {{of major}} {{importance for the}} productivity of hydrocarbon reservoirs. Besides fracture detection, also the aperture and extension of the fractures are essential for a correct reservoir productivity estimate. There {{are many ways to}} detect and measure fractures, such as borehole televiewers and electrical borehole scans. A practical approach to investigate fracture properties is by means of acoustic logging. In this thesis, borehole waves along fractured media are investigated theoretically and experimentally. Theoretically, the effect of a fracture intersecting a vertical borehole can be described by the introduction of a frequency-dependent (dynamic) borehole fluid compressibility which is measured in the laboratory. The dynamic fluid bulk modulus comprises the intrinsic fluid stiffness, the borehole wall distensibility, and the radial fluid seepage into the adjacent (horizontal) permeable zones. The latter two effects tend to diminish the intrinsic fluid’s stiffness, giving rise to a lower effective bulk modulus amplitude and thus to a lower wave speed in the borehole. The radial oscillatory fluid seepage causes viscous friction in the adjacent zones and results in a phase lag between the pressure increase and the compression of the borehole fluid, leading to attenuation of the borehole waves. This seepage effect is expressed in terms of a so-called borehole dynamic wall impedance specifying the radial fluid velocity at the borehole wall {{as a function of the}} borehole pressure variations. If a borehole wave travels down from an undamaged zone into a fracture zone, it will encounter an impedance contrast causing the wave to partially reflect and partially transmit, thus revealing the presence of permeable fracture zone adjacent to the borehole. Stoneley wave propagation in porous and fractured formations is studied experimentally by means of a vertical shock tube facility. In this set-up, shock waves in air are generated that travel downwards into a water-saturated cylindrical rock sample that has a borehole drilled along the center axis. In this way, high-energy borehole waves can be generated with excellent repeatability. A logging probe is installed in the borehole to measure the pressure profiles. Reflection from the water-sample interface and from the free water interface can be recorded by means of a fixed pressure transducer mounted in the wall of the shock tube above the sample in the water layer. The fractures in the formation are represented by small horizontal slits in composite cylinders whose upper and lower parts are separated by small spacer poles. In this way, a variable horizontal fracture (slit) aperture can be obtained. Obviously these fractures form an open connection between the borehole fluid and the fluid outside the cylinder. Also mandrel samples are used for horizontal slits that are not open to the fluid outside the cylinder, thus representing fractures with finite radial extension. Wave experiments show that varying fracture widths significantly alter the recorded Stoneley wave pressure signal at fixed depth. The reflection and transmission of <b>borehole</b> <b>tube</b> waves over 1 and 5 mm fractures are correctly predicted by theory. Other wave experiments show that attenuation in boreholes adjacent to porous zones without fractures can be predicted by theory. This technique even allows a direct measurement of the permeability, although the acoustically measured permeability and the permeability measured by falling-head technique still show a significant discrepancy. This technique is directly applicable to fractured porous reservoir core samples. Geoscience & EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Some {{mechanics}} {{involved in}} calculating wave speeds in pre-stressed materials of geophysical interest are discussed. Two topics are explored: granular materials, and fluid-solid composite systems. Elasticity in the granular material {{is dominated by}} intergranular contact which produces strong nonlinearity. The con-tact also introduce possible hysteresis and loss of strict macroscopic hyperelasticity. Starting with the Hertz solution for two spheres, these notes develop the theory to the stage where macroscopic elastic properties can be estimated, and the stress dependence of bulk waves calculated. Fluid-solid composite systems, such as a fluid-filled borehole in an elastic solid, are complicated by {{the ability of the}} fluid to slip under pre-stress. The interface conditions in the different material descriptions are examined and a procedure is described to determine the modified wave speed using a perturbation integral approach. The example of the fundamental guided mode of the <b>borehole,</b> the <b>tube</b> wave, is described in detail. ...|$|R
40|$|Community {{participation}} and management has been hailed {{as central to}} the provision of essential services like clean water facilities to underserved communities in developing countries. In Ghana, community {{participation and}} management {{is seen as the}} blue-print to water facility provision and management in both rural and small towns of the country due to the failure of the top-down approach to the provision and management of this essential facility. I argue in this thesis that the water sector reform in Ghana is being influenced by external forces like the World Bank (WB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as such community management (CM) of water in rural areas of Ghana is not made to serve the interests of the poor but to relieve the government of providing good and affordable water to these people. It is argued in the thesis that the use-values people in rural and small towns attached to different sources of water are not properly enumerated in the water sector. This thesis presents a comprehensive analysis of the bottom-up approach to water facilities provision in the Akatsi District of Ghana through the use of extensive field surveys, observation, focus group discussions, and interview with key informants in two communities- a rural community that benefited from a <b>borehole</b> (<b>tube</b> well) facility and a ‘small town’ where people use different forms of water sources like wells, boreholes, rain harvesting systems and pipe scheme (gravity fed borehole). The study assesses how the facilities are being managed and reasons why people use a particular water source at a particular time. Findings show that whilst water has been commodified, remuneration given people managing the facilities have not been commodified. Women agreed to participate in water management but later leave the water and sanitation development boards (WSDB) because they derive little remuneration from this undertaking. Within the WSDB, there is no consensus of opinion among “indigenous” citizens of Akatsi and people from different towns serving in the board on how the facilities should be managed. Sustainability and replication of the facilities is at stake because institutions and bodies owe the WSDB arrears that could have been used to pay for the initial capital cost incurred by the DA or extension of service to new areas. The DA is also not assisting the WSDB to institute legal action against these defaulters to recover these costs because the water facilities in principle belong to the community. Indeed, the institutional pluralism in the construction and management of water facilities in rural areas and small towns of Ghana is de-motivating WSDBs and people in beneficiary communities to make additional contribution for the development of their water systems because some communities were assisted with water facilities without paying initial capital cost of construction. Even though distance people travelled to gather water has been shortened {{as a result of the}} provision of public stand pipes and boreholes in various locations in Akatsi, the new infrastructure associated with the CM strategy has increased time spent gathering water. The findings also show that people of Akatsi do not have demand for the water facilities being provided them because they refused to pay part of the initial capital cost of the facility provision and get connected to the piped network. They are also resisting CM of water facilities because they do not take part in the activities of the WSDB leaving the facilities to be managed by these selected few. Findings from the thesis shows that the use-values people attached to a particular type of water are very important in addition to the price they have to pay to use it. People use a particular type of water for a specific purpose base on the characteristics the water possesses. Borehole water does not replace rain harvested water or river use because of its taste and hardness. The study reiterated that existing local water management strategies like rainwater harvesting should be incorporated into CWSP in small towns as well as villages for the people to use this water source for purposes like drinking or washing. This study fills a gap in development geography which often overlooks how gender is created through water resource interventions by concerning itself with how new meanings of community management is reinforcing gender inequality and spatial development through water facilities management and its commodification. It contributes to feminist and development geography literature by demonstrating that participatory approaches to water resource management act as a constraint to women empowerment and poverty alleviation. The study concludes that, community participation and management of water facilities is not benefiting the intended beneficiaries as such the whole concept of community participation and management should be given a second thought in the development geography literature...|$|E
40|$|We {{previously}} {{proposed a}} method of seismic endoscopy and a related prototype tool to acquire directional information and to produce three-dimensional (3 -D) seismic images in a cylindrical volume surrounding a borehole, with an investigation radius of several metres. Basic imaging algorithms were developed where the azimuthal move out (AMO) process is combined to a timescale method to refocus directional information and analyse the surrounding medium. Further processing tools, however, were necessary for separating {{the various types of}} waves recorded. The present paper describes a multiscale and dynamic azimuthal filtering to separate the far-field waves from <b>borehole</b> or <b>tube</b> waves, generated by the pipe. We call this filter Stoneley move out (SMO), because it characterizes Stoneley waves associated with the tube. It is then possible to reconstruct details of the far field by an inverse wavelet transform. The comparison with classical methods such as the covariance method is discussed. Applications on noisy synthetic and experimental data are presented...|$|R

40|$|A {{methodology}} for validating low-energy whole building simulations is expounded in this paper. The {{capability of the}} integrated building-plant system, modeled by means of equation-based environment (IDA ICE), is evaluated to quantify model mismatch. A unique “energy concept” building is considered, and consists of various low-exergy technologies: suspended ceiling panels with phase change material (PCM), radiant cooling by plastered capillary <b>tubes,</b> <b>borehole</b> heat exchanger, and free night ventilation. Monitoring data is used to validate the model over the cooling season, and results showed accurate prediction by both the building and plant models (Pfafferot 2003). The primary outcome {{of this research is}} the complete, integrated realization of a low-energy whole building simulation with validation results, whereas comparable "energy concept" validation studies are scarce.

40|$|Numerical {{analysis}} of heat exchange rate of {{several types of}} vertical ground heat exchangers (GHEs) with different condition of inlet water temperatures, <b>borehole</b> depths, and <b>tube</b> configurations have been carried out. The GHE models were built and simulated by using a commercial CFD code, FLUENT. Heat exchange rates per unit borehole depth of the GHEs increase in the cooling mode and decrease in the heating mode of 3. 4 W/m for U-tube, 5. 7 W/m for double tube, and 3. 3 W/m for multi-tube with increasing of 1 ???C of the temperature difference between inlet water and ground. Also, increasing the borehole depth lowers temperature difference between circulated water and surrounding ground and then lowers the heat exchange with the ground. Furthermore, thermal interference between inlet and outlet tubes due to the tube configuration affects significantly to the heat exchange rate of the GHEs. Insulating the outlet tube and increasing the inlet tube diameter in the multi-tube GHE contributes to the increasing the GHE performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{modeling}} of eddy current (EC) problems {{is not only}} helpful for the probe design and the interpretation of measurement data, but also essential to the corresponding inverse problems. In {{order to deal with}} high conductivity and low operating frequency, the conventional pure numerical methods require large memory and long computing time to accurately solve EC problems. In this dissertation, semi-analytical approaches are presented to efficiently solve a series of EC problems in cylindrical polar coordinates. By applying the truncation in an unbounded domain, the fields are expanded into a linear combination of the eigenfunctions. Each eigenfunction belongs to different eigenvalue. The expansion coefficients are determined by the continuity conditions at the interface between different regions. For a given coil source, the semi-analytic solution of the fields in an unflawed conductor can be obtained using this method. The electromagnetic fields are expressed in terms of transverse electric and transverse magnetic modes. At a circularly cylindrical interface, these two modes are coupled with each other. The coupling is considered in the <b>borehole</b> and <b>tube</b> problems. Then the concept is further extended into the borehole opening problem, in which the coupling between different eigenmodes is added. A well-developed crack model is used to solve the crack problems and estimate the impedance change of an induction coil due to a thin crack in conductors. The thin crack is equivalent to an electric current dipole source distributed over the crack region. An electric integral equation is constructed to solve this equivalent source, and the coil impedance change is predicted. The dyadic Green 2 ̆ 7 s kernel, which is required in the integral equation, is derived for different structures. Special numerical implementations are proposed to deal with the issues arising in our program to make sure the calculation is accurate and the computational cost is small. The convergence of the series expansion is discussed. Methods used to compute the eigenvalues are also investigated. Predictions of the probe signals show a good agreement with experimental measurements in several examples. Compared to numerical methods, the approach is much faster to get the results with same accuracy...|$|R
40|$|To {{accommodate}} a future {{need for additional}} waste disposal facilities at the Savannah River Site, the Solid Waste Management Division (SWMD) designated nine additional plots for development (Kasraii 2007; SRS 2010); these plots are collectively known as the E Area Completion Project (ECP). Subsurface samples were collected from ECP plots 6, 7, 8 and 9 (Figure 1) for chemical and physical property analyses to support Performance Assessment (PA) and Special Analyses (SA) modeling. This document summarizes the sampling and analysis scheme and the resultant data, and provides interpretations of the data particularly in reference to existing soil property data. Analytical data in this document include: gamma log, cone penetrometer log, grain size (sieve and hydrometer), water retention, saturated hydraulic conductivity (falling head permeameter), porosity, dry bulk density, total organic carbon, x-ray diffraction, and x-ray fluorescence data. SRNL provided technical and safety oversight for the fieldwork, which included completion of eight soil borings, four geophysical logs, and the collection of 522 feet of core and 33 Shelby tubes from ECP plots 6, 7, 8, and 9. Boart Longyear provided sonic drilling and logging services. Two soil borings were completed at each location. The first set of boreholes extended into (but did not fully penetrate) the Warley Hill Formation. These boreholes were continuously cored, then geophysically (gamma ray) logged. The recovered core was split, photographed, and described; {{one half of the}} core was archived at SRS's Core Lab facilities, and the remaining half was consumed as necessary for testing at SRS and off-site labs. Core descriptions and geophysical data were used to calculate target elevations for Shelby tube samples, which were obtained from the second set of <b>boreholes.</b> Shelby <b>tubes</b> were shipped to MACTEC Engineering and Consulting Inc. (MACTEC) in Atlanta for physical property testing. SRNL deployed their Site Characterization and Analysis Penetrometer System (SCAPS) cone penetrometer test (CPT) truck at ECP plots 6, 7, 8 and 9 to collect inferred lithology data for the vadose zone. Results from this study are used to make recommendations for future modeling efforts involving the ECP plots. The conceptual model of the ECP hydrogeology differs from the conceptual model of the current ELLWF disposal area in that for the ECP plots, the topography (ground surface) is generally lower in elevation; The Upland and top of Tobacco Road lithostratigraphic units are missing (eroded); The water table occurs lower in elevation (i. e., it occurs in lower stratigraphic units); and the Tan Clay Confining Zone (TCCZ) often occurs within the vadose zone (rather than in the saturated zone). Due to the difference in the hydrogeology between the current ELLWF location and the ECP plots, different vadose zone properties are recommended for the ECP plots versus the properties recommended by Phifer et al. (2006) for the current disposal units. Results from this study do not invalidate or conflict with the current PA's use of the Upper and Lower Vadose Zone properties as described by Phifer et al. (2006) for the current ELLWF disposal units. The following modeling recommendations are made for future modeling of the ECP plots where vadose zone properties are required: (1) If a single vadose zone property is preferred, the properties described by Phifer et al. (2006) for the Upper Vadose Zone encompass the general physical properties of the combined sands and clays in the ECP vadose zone sediments despite the differences in hydrostratigraphic units. (2) If a dual zone system is preferred, a combination of the Lower Zone properties and the Clay properties described by Phifer et al. (2006) are appropriate for modeling the physical properties of the ECP vadose zone. The Clay properties would be assigned to the Tan Clay Confining Zone (TCCZ) and any other significant clay layers, while the Lower Zone properties would be assigned {{for the remainder of the}} vadose zone. No immediate updates or changes are recommended for the saturated zone properties for modeling of the ECP plots. The hydrogeology and saturated hydraulic conductivity values resulting from the ECP work are consistent with existing data for the area. The following recommendations are provided for consideration in future work: (1) When the database is next updated, we recommend checking/refining hydrostratigraphic interpretations (picks) in addition to revising physical property data for both the vadose zone and saturated zone. (2) Results from this work suggest that separate ECP vadose zone properties may be appropriate for the various ECP plots. Consideration should be given to the fact that the plots toward the northwest (ECP plots 6, 7 and 8) all have the TCCZ within the vadose zone whereas the TCCZ occurs within the saturated zone to the east (ECP plot 9). (3) Further data may be needed at ECP plot 7...|$|R
