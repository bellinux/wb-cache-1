The rapid development of entertainment technology was assisted by improvements in data storage devices such as cassette tapes or compact discs, along with increasing miniaturisation.

A new species, T. kapasi, was described by Lacau & Groc in 2012, but has now been relegated to a junior synonym under T. tatusia based on the extent of the morphological variability encountered throughout this broad geographic range. Analysis of DNA <b>barcodes</b> indicated a pattern of genetic isolation by distance, suggesting the presence of a single species undergoing allopatric differentiation.|$|E

25|$|RFID tags {{are often}} a complement, but not a substitute, for UPC or EAN <b>barcodes.</b> They may never {{completely}} replace <b>barcodes,</b> {{due in part to}} their higher cost and the advantage of multiple data sources on the same object. Also, unlike RFID labels, <b>barcodes</b> can be generated and distributed electronically, e.g. via e-mail or mobile phone, for printing or display by the recipient. An example is airline boarding passes. The new EPC, along with several other schemes, is widely available at reasonable cost.|$|E
25|$|A barcode is an optical, machine-readable, {{representation}} of data; the data usually describes {{something about the}} object that carries the barcode. Originally <b>barcodes</b> systematically represented data by varying the widths and spacings of parallel lines, and may {{be referred to as}} linear or one-dimensional (1D). Later two-dimensional (2D) codes were developed, using rectangles, dots, hexagons and other geometric patterns in two dimensions, usually called <b>barcodes</b> although they do not use bars as such. <b>Barcodes</b> were initially scanned by special optical scanners called barcode readers. Later application software became available for devices that could read images, such as smartphones with cameras.|$|E

25|$|Many {{phones are}} able to decode <b>barcodes</b> using their {{built-in}} camera, as well. Google's mobile Android operating system uses both their own Google Goggles application or third party barcode scanners like Scan. Nokia's Symbian operating system features a barcode scanner, while mbarcode is a QR code reader for the Maemo operating system. In Apple iOS 11, the native camera app can decode QR Codes and can link to URLs, join wireless networks, or perform other operations depending on the QR Code contents. Other paid and free apps are available with scanning capabilities for other symbologies or for earlier iOS versions. With BlackBerry devices, the App World application can natively scan <b>barcodes</b> and load any recognized Web URLs on the device's Web browser. Windows Phone 7.5 is able to scan <b>barcodes</b> through the Bing search app. However, these devices are not designed specifically for the capturing of <b>barcodes.</b> As a result, they do not decode nearly as quickly or accurately as a dedicated barcode scanner or portable data terminal.|$|E

Each <b>barcoded</b> SNT has several segments with different reflectance values depending on their diameters and wall thicknesses. Therefore, the <b>barcode</b> of each SNT can be “read-out ” with a conventional optical microscope. <b>Barcoded</b> SNTs have shown high stability and dispersibility in aqueous buffer media.

40|$|DNA <b>barcoding</b> {{has become}} one of {{hotspots}} of biodiversity research in the last five years. It is a method of rapid and accurate species identification and recognition using a short, standardized DNA region. DNA <b>barcoding</b> is now well established for animals, using a portion of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI or cox 1) as the standard universal <b>barcode.</b> However, in plants, progress has been hampered by slow substitution rates in mitochondrial DNA. A number of different chloroplast regions have been proposed. There has been considerable debate, but little consensus regarding region choice for DNA <b>barcoding</b> land plants. Direct comparative assessment of different <b>barcoding</b> regions is now a priority to enable a standard <b>barcoding</b> solution to be agreed in plants. The proposed chloroplast <b>barcoding</b> regions mainly include five coding (rpoB, rpoC 1, matK, rbcL, UPA) and three non-coding (trnH-psbA, atpF-atpH, psbK-psbI) regions. In addition, nrITS is also suggested as a potential plant <b>barcode.</b> Limited by the universality and resolvability of single <b>barcoding</b> region, five combinations of these regions are proposed. In this review, the advance of these <b>barcoding</b> regions, both their universality of primers and resolving power are reviewed.

25|$|A barcode is {{an optical}} {{machine-readable}} representation of data, which shows certain data on certain products. Originally, <b>barcodes</b> represented {{data in the}} widths (lines) and the spacings of parallel lines, and may {{be referred to as}} linear or one-dimensional <b>barcodes</b> or symbologies. They also come in patterns of squares, dots, hexagons and other geometric patterns within images termed two-dimensional matrix codes or symbologies.

25|$|Barcode {{verification}} examines scanability and {{the quality}} of the barcode in comparison to industry standards and specifications. Barcode verifiers are primarily used by businesses that print and use <b>barcodes.</b> Any trading partner in the supply chain can test barcode quality.
