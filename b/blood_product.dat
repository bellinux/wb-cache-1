When he was three days old, doctors diagnosed him with severe hemophilia A, a hereditary blood coagulation disorder associated with the X chromosome, which causes even minor injuries to result in severe bleeding. For treatment, he received weekly infusions of Factor VIII, a <b>blood</b> <b>product</b> created from pooled plasma of non-hemophiliacs, an increasingly common treatment for hemophiliacs at the time.|$|E
5|$|The {{second most}} {{frequent}} mode of HIV transmission is via blood and blood products. Blood-borne transmission can be through needle-sharing during intravenous drug use, needle stick injury, transfusion of contaminated blood or <b>blood</b> <b>product,</b> or medical injections with unsterilized equipment. The risk from sharing a needle during drug injection is between 0.63 and 2.4% per act, {{with an average}} of 0.8%. The risk of acquiring HIV from a needle stick from an HIV-infected person is estimated as 0.3% (about 1 in 333) per act and the risk following mucous membrane exposure to infected blood as 0.09% (about 1 in 1000) per act. In the United States intravenous drug users made up 12% of all new cases of HIV in 2009, and in some areas more than 80% of people who inject drugs are HIV positive.|$|E
25|$|As no {{intravenous}} fluids used for initial resuscitation {{have been shown}} to be superior, warmed Lactated Ringer's solution continues to be the solution of choice. If blood products are needed, a greater use of fresh frozen plasma and platelets relative to packed red blood cells has been found to improve survival and lower overall <b>blood</b> <b>product</b> use; a ratio of 1:1:1 is recommended. The success of platelets has been attributed to the fact that they may prevent coagulopathy from developing. Cell salvage and autotransfusion also may be used.|$|E

40|$|AbstractHematopoietic {{stem cell}} {{transplantation}} (HSCT) recipients are a high-risk, immunocompromised {{group of patients}} who receive frequent transfusions after transplantation. Transfusion of cytomegalovirus (CMV) -negative <b>blood</b> <b>products</b> {{has long been the}} standard of care to prevent transfusion-transmitted CMV in this patient population. Leukoreduction of <b>blood</b> <b>products</b> before transfusion has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of transfusion-transmitted CMV. In the era of universal leukoreduction in Canada, the need for CMV testing of <b>blood</b> <b>products</b> remains unclear. We sought to identify whether there is a difference in transfusion-transmitted CMV viremia in patients receiving only leukoreduced versus CMV-negative and leukoreduced <b>blood</b> <b>products</b> in HSCT recipients. Patients who were CMV negative and received an allogeneic HSCT from a CMV-negative donor between October 1, 1999 and June 30, 2012 were included in the analysis. Transfusion data were collected from The Ottawa Hospital Blood Bank and Canadian Blood Services. CMV viremia was defined as PCR positivity. One hundred sixty-six patients were identified who met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 89 patients received an HSCT before January 2007, during the time when patients received leukoreduced and CMV-negative <b>blood</b> <b>products.</b> Seventy-seven patients received an HSCT after this time, receiving only leukoreduced <b>blood</b> <b>products.</b> The 2 groups did not differ in terms of age, gender, diagnosis, graft type, graft source, conditioning regimen, or ABO compatibility (P > . 05). CMV viremia was detected in 3 patients who received CMV-negative leukoreduced <b>blood</b> <b>products</b> (3. 37 %) and in 1 patient who received only leukoreduced <b>blood</b> <b>products</b> (1. 30 %, P = . 6244). Of the patients who developed CMV viremia, 2 developed suspected CMV disease. Both of these patients were transfused with CMV-negative <b>blood</b> <b>products.</b> Secondary outcomes, including total length of stay in hospital, admission to the intensive care unit, acute and chronic graft versus host disease, and 100 -day nonrelapse mortality, did not differ between the groups. In the era of universal leukoreduction of <b>blood</b> <b>products,</b> this study demonstrates that testing for CMV-negative <b>blood</b> <b>products</b> is not needed for HSCT recipients...|$|R
25|$|When an apheresis {{system is}} used for therapy, the system is {{removing}} relatively small amounts of fluid (not more than 10.5 mL/kg body weight). That fluid must be replaced to keep correct intravascular volume. The fluid replaced is different at different institutions. If a crystalloid like normal saline (NS) is used, the infusion amount should be triple what is removed as the 3:1 ratio of normal saline for plasma is needed to keep up oncotic pressure. Some institutions use normal serum albumin, but it is costly and {{can be difficult to}} find. Some advocate using fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or a similar <b>blood</b> <b>product,</b> but there are dangers including citrate toxicity (from the anticoagulant), ABO incompatibility, infection, and cellular antigens.|$|E
25|$|Red {{blood cells}} {{may be given}} {{as part of a}} blood transfusion. Blood may be donated from another person, or stored by the {{recipient}} at an earlier date. Donated blood usually requires screening to ensure that donors do not contain risk factors for the presence of blood-borne diseases, or will not suffer themselves by giving blood. Blood is usually collected and tested for common or serious Blood-borne diseases including Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and HIV. The blood type (A, B, AB, or O) or the <b>blood</b> <b>product</b> is identified. This relates to the presence of antigens on the cell's surface. After this process, the blood is stored, and within a short duration is used. Blood can be given as a whole product or the red blood cells separated as packed red blood cells.|$|E
25|$|On rare occasions, blood {{products}} are contaminated with bacteria. This {{can result in}} a life-threatening infection known as transfusion-transmitted bacterial infection. The risk of severe bacterial infection is estimated, as of 2002, at about 1 in 50,000 platelet transfusions, and 1 in 500,000 red blood cell transfusions. <b>Blood</b> <b>product</b> contamination, while rare, is still more common than actual infection. The reason platelets are more often contaminated than other {{blood products}} is that they are stored at room temperature for short periods of time. Contamination is also more common with longer duration of storage, especially if that means more than 5 days. Sources of contaminants include the donor's blood, donor's skin, phlebotomist's skin, and containers. Contaminating organisms vary greatly, and include skin flora, gut flora, and environmental organisms. There are many strategies in place at blood donation centers and laboratories {{to reduce the risk of}} contamination. A definite diagnosis of transfusion-transmitted bacterial infection includes the identification of a positive culture in the recipient (without an alternative diagnosis) as well as the identification of the same organism in the donor blood.|$|E

The effect of transfusing non-irradiated <b>blood</b> <b>products</b> in HSCT outcome, including incidence of transplant complications, bacterial infections, acute and chronic GVHD presentation, and characteristics, has not been documented. Clinical records as well as blood bank and electronic databases of HSCT patients grafted after reduced-intensity conditioning who received irradiated versus non-irradiated <b>blood</b> <b>products,</b> after <b>blood</b> irradiation became unavailable at our center, were scrutinized for transplant outcome, clinical evolution, engraftment characteristics including days to neutrophil and platelet recovery, acute and chronic GVHD, rate and type of infections, and additional transplant-related comorbidities. All transfused <b>blood</b> <b>products</b> were leukoreduced. A total of 156 HSCT recipients was studied, 73 received irradiated and 83 non-irradiated blood components.

These patients would be supported with <b>blood</b> <b>products</b> {{sent by the}} transferring facility, and on arrival these products would be discarded due to unvalidated shipping methods. This process put a strain on local blood suppliers and small transfusion services. The local aero-medical evacuation provider, Airlift Northwest (ALNW), also had no <b>blood</b> <b>products</b> to support trauma patients being transferred {{from the scene of}} the injury. These patients only began receiving transfusion support upon arrival at HMC. HMC partnered with ALNW to begin supplying <b>blood</b> <b>products</b> to support the transfer of patients. This process would entail validating a system to ensure the <b>blood</b> <b>products</b> would be kept at a storage temperature between 1 - 6 ℃. Since ALNW had six air bases throughout Washington and Alaska, the Credo Series 4 EMT cooler was validated to store the <b>blood</b> <b>products</b> for up to seven days to minimize transport between HMC and ALNW. To ensure an appropriate temperature was maintained in the cooler, a temperature recorder was placed in the cooler along with the <b>blood</b> <b>products.</b> HMC also used new <b>blood</b> <b>products,</b> low titer plasma and liquid plasma, to support prehospital transfusion. Low titer plasma (LTP) was defined as blood type A plasma with a titer of anti-B as ≤ 1 : 200. LTP was occasionally used in place of the traditional universal type AB plasma due to inventory control purposes. Typically HMC stocks thawed plasma that expires five days after thawing. To support ALNW holding <b>blood</b> <b>products</b> for seven days, liquid plasma was used as it expires 26 days after donation.
