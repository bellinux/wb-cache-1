Shortly before his death, {{there was a}} staged reading of <b>Big</b> <b>White</b> Fog in New York City and, in 1995, the Penumbra Theatre Company's artistic {{director}} Lou Bellamy directed a production of the play for The Guthrie Theatre in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

25|$|The {{success of}} <b>Big</b> <b>White</b> Fog in Chicago {{prompted}} Ward to seek wider reaching theatrical success in New York City. He traveled east {{as an actor}} in the chorus of the FTP's 1939 production of The Swing Mikado, and settled in with Wright in Harlem where he was writing for the Communist newspaper, the Daily Worker. Without warning, however, Congress announced that they were shutting down the increasingly incendiary productions of the Federal Theatre Project, and Ward promptly found himself out of a job. Determined to continue his theatrical experiments and bolstered by Wright's socialist agenda, Ward began searching for private funding and a New York venue to revive the <b>Big</b> <b>White</b> Fog. After a series of fundraisers and new alliances with New York artists, the play re-opened Off-Broadway in 1940 at Harlem's Lincoln Theatre as the inaugural production of Ward's new collaborative project, the Negro Playwrights Company, a theatrical organization born out of the burgeoning culture of the Harlem Renaissance and featuring such up-and-comers as Wright, Paul Robeson, Langston Hughes, Powell Lindsay, and Edna Thomas among others. Although both critics and Ward's contemporaries celebrated the work for its somber realism and politically relevant tone, the general public disapproved of its heavy-handed leftist rhetoric and, as a result, <b>Big</b> <b>White</b> Fog closed after only sixty-four performances, taking the still fledgling Negro Playwrights Company down in its wake.|$|E

25|$|The short play {{impressed}} Ward's fellow {{writer and}} John Reed member Richard Wright, {{who insisted that}} Ward keep composing for the theatre, even introducing him to the South Side Writers Club, an artistic cooperative of aspiring black writers that included Wright, Arna Bontemps, Frank Marshall Davis, Owen Dodson, George Norford, and Margaret Walker. With their influence and encouragement, Ward completed his first full-length work, <b>Big</b> <b>White</b> Fog, which was produced in 1938 by the Negro Unit of the FTP to much local fanfare.|$|E

500|$|In an Astaire-Rogers picture, the <b>Big</b> <b>White</b> Set — {{as these}} Art Deco-inspired creations were known — {{took up the}} largest share of the film's {{production}} costs, and Top Hat was no exception. A winding canal — spanned by two staircase bridges {{at one end and}} a flat bridge on the other — was built across two adjoining sound stages. Astaire and Rogers dance across this flat bridge in [...] "Cheek to Cheek". Around the bend from this bridge was located the main piazza, a giant stage coated in red bakelite and this was the location for [...] "The Piccolino". This fantasy representation of the Lido of Venice was on three levels comprising dance floors, restaurants and terraces, all decorated in candy-cane colours, with the canal waters [...] dyed black.

[...] Homer is sent home with a 20-question psychiatric quiz that he has to fill in so that Dr. Marvin Monroe can assess his sanity.

500|$|The tour {{became the}} most {{successful}} debut concert tour in history, with an attendance of over two million. It also set a record for the fastest sell-out of Japan's Tokyo Dome, selling out within seven minutes. Jackson became the only female artist other than Madonna to fill arenas at the time. It was ranked the fifth most successful tour of 1990, making her the only female artist to place within the top ten. It also solidified her reputation as a fashion icon, as fans imitated her [...] "Rhythm Nation" [...] outfit and regalia. Ebony magazine reported [...] "hoards of teen girls were imitating her distinctive look—black quasi-military long jackets, black tight-tight pants, and <b>big</b> <b>white</b> shirts." [...] Joel Selvin of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote [...] "the 23-year-old has been making smash hit records for four years, becoming a fixture on MTV and a major role model to teenage girls across the country." [...] Over $450,000.00 in proceeds from the tour's Madison Square Garden show were used to establish the Rhythm Nation scholarship program. The annual scholarship awards $5,000.00 to students majoring in performing arts and communications at United Negro College Fund member colleges and universities. William Allen, then-executive {{vice president of the}} UNCF, remarked: [...] "Jackson is a role model for all young people to emulate and the message she has gotten to the young people of this country through the lyrics of 'Rhythm Nation 1814' is having positive effects." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jackson — in {{the late}} 1960s, Ketcham decided to add an African American {{character}} named Jackson to the cast. Ketcham designed Jackson {{in the tradition of}} a stereotypical cartoon pickaninny, with huge lips, <b>big</b> <b>white</b> eyes, and just a suggestion of an Afro hair style. A panel from May 13, 1970 depicted Jackson and Dennis playing in the backyard, with Dennis saying to his father, [...] "I'm havin' some race trouble with Jackson. He runs FASTER than I do!" [...] The attempt to integrate the feature did not go over well. Protests erupted in Detroit, Little Rock, Miami, and St. Louis, and debris was thrown at the offices of the Post Dispatch. Taken aback, Ketcham issued a statement explaining that his intentions were innocent, and Jackson was not used again. However, another African American character named Jay Weldon appeared in the 1986 animated series to far less controversy, as he was not a stereotype.|$|E
2500|$|James Theodore Ward (September 15, 1902 [...] May 8, 1983) was {{a leftist}} {{political}} playwright and theatre educator {{during the first}} half of the 20th century and one of the earliest contributors to the Black Chicago Renaissance. Often referred to as the [...] "dean of black dramatists," [...] Ward was well known for tackling controversial topics related to African-American urban life during the Great Depression. His staged works were lauded for their innovative depiction of the black experience, most notably for doing away with the spiritual ballads and feverish dancing that dominated [...] "Negro theatricals" [...] of his time in favor of a more nuanced, naturalistic approach to plot and character. A prolific writer, Ward composed over thirty plays and co-founded the Negro Playwrights Company with Langston Hughes, Paul Robeson and Richard Wright. His best known works are the drama <b>Big</b> <b>White</b> Fog (1938), produced by the Negro Unit of the Federal Theatre Project in Chicago as well the musical Our Lan' (1947) which premiered on Broadway at New York's Royale Theatre.|$|E

The operation had been engineered out of the White House by Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North, {{who served on the}} National Security Council staff. North was then aided by CIA Director William Casey. Aspects of the operation violated a congressionally-mandated restriction of overt U.S. support of the Contras. George initially told Congress that CIA was not involved in the operation, and he later apologized for being evasive. He said he was trying to protect the agency.|$|R
