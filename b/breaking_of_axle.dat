50|$|The {{service life}} of the class 605 was rather ill-fated. The ICE TD units were plagued by {{technical}} problems from the start. After the <b>breaking</b> <b>of</b> an <b>axle</b> on 2 December 2002, all remaining 19 units (one fell off a working platform during maintenance) were grounded. Even though one year later the trains were admitted to service again, DB judged their operation to be overly expensive. DB must pay full diesel tax for the fuel.|$|R
50|$|The {{class was}} ordered {{as the only}} railcar for the Valdres Line. Built by Strømmens Værksted, it was design-wise similar to the Gullfisk trams which had been {{delivered}} to the Oslo Tramway. Kristine Valdresdatter was delivered to the private railway with road number 109. In 1937, the line {{was taken over by}} NSB, and the train was given number 18247 and designated Cmb Class 17. As the nationalization resulted in more direct services to Oslo, there was no longer need for the railcar on the line, and it was transferred to the Numedal Line on 21 July 1939. On 12 January 1946, the train was transferred to Stavanger, but was little used. The railcar had a loose tire and procuring a replacement rubber spacer deemed difficult. It was transferred for use on the Grimstad Line on 7 May 1947. On 5 August 1955, the railcar derailed at Fjære, causing a <b>break</b> <b>of</b> <b>axle.</b> The train was therefore set aside, and was decided retired from 7 April 1956. Part of the reason for the early retirement was that the railcar only had a driver's cab in one end, making it difficult to turn. The railcar has been scrapped.|$|R
50|$|Rather luckless was class 411/415's {{adaptation}} {{for diesel}} services. In 2001 {{a total of}} 20 units were commissioned for use on the Dresden - Munich line, but these class 605 (ICE-TD) units experienced trouble from the start. After the <b>breaking</b> <b>of</b> an <b>axle</b> in 2002, all remaining 19 units (one fell off a working platform) were taken out of service. Even though one year later the trains were admitted to service again, DB judged their operation to be overly expensive. In 2006 those trains were used for amplifier trains and since 2008 they run on the Hamburg - Copenhagen route.|$|R

40|$|Front <b>axle</b> <b>of</b> {{heavy duty}} truck is the {{important}} component of vehicle and needs good design under the various loading conditions of the complete vehicle. Aim of the project is to stress analysis and predict the life <b>of</b> front <b>axle</b> for vertical, and vertical and braking loading case. The fatigue life <b>of</b> front <b>axle</b> is generally estimated by stress life approach and strain life approach method. Front axle beam assembly was modeled in the NX cad software.

Fatigue life <b>of</b> <b>axle</b> obtained by FEA method is more than 2 x 105 cycles, which is considered as safe for vertical loading case.

2500|$|On November 4, 1862, the 33rd Alabama {{was ordered}} to board a train which was {{scheduled}} {{to take them to}} Chattanooga. In a freak accident a few miles south of Cleveland, Tennessee, a large stick of wood fell from the locomotive tender as the train moved rapidly on a downhill grade, <b>breaking</b> the <b>axle</b> <b>of</b> one of the railcars immediately behind it and causing part of the train to derail. Pvt. Matthews reports that when the axle snapped on the boxcar he was in, all the wheels came off and [...] "clogged" [...] under the wheels of the car behind it (occupied by Co. G), causing its separation from the train. Meanwhile, the engine continued to pull the wheel-less B Company car two or three hundred yards down the track before it finally stopped. Several soldiers had been riding on the boxcar roofs: Matthews reported that these were [...] "shook off, like shaking peaches from a tree, and badly jolted when they hit the ground." [...] Others were pinned beneath and within the wreckage; some only escaped by [...] "alighting on their heads." ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The {{toll rate}} charged for {{the usage of}} {{facilities}} such as a tunnel or a bridge is usually proportional to the number <b>of</b> <b>axles</b> possessed by a vehicle. However, it is sometimes difficult {{to determine the number}} <b>of</b> <b>axles</b> <b>of</b> a vehicle by the toll-booth operator and therefore, an automatic system that can identify the number <b>of</b> <b>axles</b> is sought. Instead <b>of</b> detecting the <b>axle,</b> wheels <b>of</b> a vehicle are tested and a method based on the Hough transform for detecting circles is proposed. As the system must be able to detect the correct number of wheels in real-time, sub-sampling based on the Haar Wavelet transform is applied. Experimental results show that the system is able to identify the wheel correctly and to process the input images in real-time...|$|R

50|$|Vehicles are {{classified}} for toll purposes in six categories {{based on the}} wheelbase and the number <b>of</b> <b>axles.</b> If the number <b>of</b> <b>axles</b> <b>of</b> a vehicle {{is less than the}} maximum number <b>of</b> <b>axles</b> -because some <b>axles</b> <b>of</b> a truck are lifted up or a tractor is running without its trailer-, the integrated automated vehicle classification system changes the vehicle category read in to the actual one during the passage allowing a lower toll tariff. The bridge toll is fixed for each vehicle category, and is charged only once in eastward direction on the two bridges in Istanbul. The road toll is rated further depending on the distance driven between the entry and the exit of motorway for each vehicle category. For this reason, a signal has to be initiated on the KGS-lane by entering the motorway.|$|R
