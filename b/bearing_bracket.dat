It mainly includes granite basement, micro energy pulse generator, precise servo mechanics, detection and servo control system, constant tension winding systems.

The servo reference voltage also influences the surface roughness and machining time. Utilizing micro wire electrode with diameter in 30 µm, the MWEDM can machine micro slot with minimum size of 38 µm, which proves that the discharge gap width can be controlled not more than 4 um, and so small discharge gap is beneficial for part’s machining accuracy.

40|$|Based on {{experimental}} {{observations on}} a set of twenty 700 [*]MW hydrogenerators, compiled from several technical reports issued over the last three decades and collected from the reprocessing of the vibration signals recorded during the last commissioning tests, this paper shows that the accurate determination of the journal bearings operating conditions may be a difficult task. It shows that the outsize <b>bearing</b> <b>brackets</b> of large hydrogenerators are subject to substantial dimensional changes caused by external agents, like the generator electromagnetic field and the bearing cooling water temperature. It also shows that the shaft eccentricity of a journal bearing of a healthy large hydrogenerator, operating in steady-state condition, may experience unpredictable, sudden, and significant changes without apparent reasons. Some of these phenomena are reproduced in ordinary commissioning tests or may be noticed even during normal operation, while others are rarely observed or are only detected through special tests. These phenomena modify journal bearings stiffness and damping, changing the hydrogenerator dynamics, creating discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental measurements, and making damage detection and diagnostics difficult. Therefore, these phenomena must be analyzed and considered in the application of vibration-based condition monitoring to these rotating machines...|$|R
40|$|In {{vertically}} oriented {{machines with}} journal bearing, {{there are no}} predefined static radial loads, such as dead weight for horizontal rotor. Most of the commercial software is designed to calculate rotordynamic and bearing properties based on machines with a horizontally oriented rotor; that is, the bearing properties are calculated at a static eccentricity. For tilting-pad bearings, there are no existing analytical expressions for bearing parameters and the bearing parameters are dependent on eccentricity and load angle. The objective {{of this paper is}} to present a simplified method to perform numerical simulations on vertical rotors including bearing parameters. Instead of recalculating the bearing parameters in each time step polynomials are used to represent the bearing parameters for present eccentricities and load angles. Numerical results are compared with results from tests performed in a test rig. The test rig consists of two guide bearings and a midspan rotor. The guide bearings are 4 -pad tilting-pad bearings. Shaft displacement and strains in the <b>bearing</b> <b>bracket</b> are measured to determine the test rig’s properties.

40|$|In {{this work}} we have {{developed}} the energy balance model for inelastic deformation process of metals. Changes in the material structure are taking into account {{with the help of}} tensorial variable having the physical meaning of additional strain induced by initiation of defects. Introduction of such a parameter allows one to calculate the stored energy value and develop an energy-based fracture criterion. There were considered two ways of derivation of constitutive equations for plastic and structural strain. The first method was based on the principles of linear nonequilibrium thermodynamics, the second one is the analogue of the flow plastisity theory. Developed thermomechanical model includes equilibrium equation, geometric relation for strain tensor, Hooke's law, constitutive equations for structural and plastic strain and energy balance equation. It is assumed that fracture in the material takes place when stored energy reaches critical value in some volume of the material. The application of such an approach to fracture problems of the metals is illustrated by two numerical examples. The first example is crack path simulation in the steel shaft with initial crack oriented at the certain angle to the shaft axis.

As part of a major debottlenecking project, they were rerated to provide more flow. The entire pump inner case assemblies (including rotor and inner casing) were replaced with higher capacity elements. The steam turbines had new governor valves and nozzle rings installed to produce more power. The control scheme was modernized with an electronic governor that adjusted the pump speed to maintain a constant header pressure. The new equipment was installed in September 1994, nothing went well. The pump experienced high blade pass frequency vibrations. The solution required unique hydraulic modifications and inboard <b>bearing</b> <b>bracket</b> stiffening to eliminate a resonance. The turbines tripped mysteriously and broke governor valve stems.

40|$|Since Sweden’s {{hydropower}} {{plants are}} getting old and operating conditions have changed, {{there is a}} need for simulation tools to predict the functionality, durability and needs for maintenance. Also for breakdowns and major revisions, there is a benefit if dynamical problems could be predicted through simulations. The important parts in the modelling of hydropower machines are the interconnections (Bearings, Generator, Runner). Therefore, accurate and fast models are preferred to describe the interconnections and implement to the finite element model of the rotor. Since hydropower machines are oriented ertically the bearing coefficients needs to be described dynamically. This is due to the fact that vertical machines has no stationary operating point. In paper A simulations of a hydropower machine that suffered from resonance problems were performed. To reduce vibrations, a new type of viscoelastic supports was implemented between the supporting structure and <b>bearing</b> <b>bracket.</b> It was shown through simulations that this support would reduce the vibration levels and reduce the probability of resonance problems occurring when running at operating speed. In paper B the effect of cross-coupling bearing terms was investigated, commonly the cross-coupling terms are neglected since they are small in comparison to the radial components. This is shown to be true for some load cases, but if studying a vertical machine the load angle will change dynamically and for some load angles the cross-coupling terms cannot be neglected. Experiments on a vertical test rig with tilting pad bearings also agree well with the simulations performed. Since the tilting pad bearings in vertical machines introduce periodic coefficients in the bearing, studies in paper C shows that this periodic excitation can cause increased vibrations for certain operating conditions.

40|$|In {{almost all}} {{production}} of electricity the rotating machines serves as {{an important part of}} the energy transformation system. In hydropower units, a hydraulic turbine connected to a generator converts the potential energy stored in the water reservoir into electrical energy in the generator. An essential part of this energy conversion is the rotating system of which the turbine and the generator are part. During the last century the machines for electricity production have been developed from a few mega watts per unit up to several hundreds mega watts per unit. The development and increasing of size of the hydropower machines have also brought a need for new techniques. The most important developments are the increased efficiency of the turbines and generators, new types of bearings and the introduction of new materials. Vibration measurements are still the most reliable and commonly used method to avoid failure during commissioning, for periodic maintenance, and as protection of the systems. Knowledge of the bearing forces in different operational modes is essential in order to estimate the degeneration of components and to avoid failures. In the appended Paper A, a method has been described for measurement of bearing load by use of strain gauges installed on the guide <b>bearing</b> <b>bracket.</b> This technique can determine the magnitude and direction of both static and dynamic loads acting on the bearing. This method also makes it possible to find the cause of the radial bearing force among the various eccentricities and disturbances in the system. A principal cause of many failures in large electrical machines is the occurrence of high radial forces due to misalignment between rotor and stator, rotor imbalance or disturbance from the turbine. In this thesis, two rotor models are suggested for calculation of forces and moments acting on the generator shaft depending on misalignment between stator and rotor. These two methods are described in appended papers B and C. In Paper B, a linear model is proposed for an eccentric generator rotor subjected to a radial magnetic force. Both the radial force and the bending moment affecting the generator shaft are considered when the centre of the rotor spider hub deviates from the centre of the rotor rim. The magnetic pull force acting on the rotor is assumed to be proportional to the rotor displacement. In Paper C, a non-linear model is proposed for analysis of an eccentric rotor subjected to radial magnetic force. Both the radial and bending moments affecting the generator shaft are considered when the centre of the generator spider hub deviates from the centre of the generator rim. The magnetic forces acting on the rotor are assumed to be a non-linear function of the air-gap between the rotor and stator. The stability analysis shows that the rotor can become unstable for small initial eccentricities if the rotor rim position relative to the rotor hub is included in the analysis. The analysis also shows that the natural frequencies can decrease and the rotor response can increase if the rotor rim position in relation to the rotor spider is considered. The endurance of hydropower rotor components is often associated with the dynamic loads acting on the rotating system and the number of start-stop cycles of the unit. Measurements together with analysis of the rotordynamics are often the most powerful methods available to improve understanding of the cause of the dynamic load. The method for measurement of bearing load presented in this thesis makes it possible to investigate the dynamic as well as the static loads as acting on the bearing brackets.

In Paper E, the effect of damping rods was included in the analysis of the magnetic pull force. The resulting force was found to be reduced significantly when the damper rods were taken into account. An interesting effect of the rotor damper rods was that they reduced the eccentricity forces and introduced a force component perpendicular to the direction of eccentricity. The results from the finite-element simulations were used to determine how the forces affect the stability of the generator rotor. Damped natural eigenfrequencies and the damping ratio for load and no-load conditions were investigated. When applying the forces computed in the time- dependent model, the damped natural eigenfrequencies were found to increase and the stability of the generator rotor was found to be reduced, compared with when the forces were computed in a stationary model. Damage due to contact between the runner and the discharge ring have been observed in several hydroelectric power units. The damage can cause high repair costs to the runner and the discharge ring as well as considerable production losses. In Paper F a rotor model of a 45 MW hydropower unit is used for the analysis of the rotor dynamical phenomena occurring due to contact between the runner and the discharge ring for different grades of lateral force on the turbine and bearing damping. The rotor model consists of a generator rotor and a turbine, which are connected to an elastic shaft supported by three isotropic bearings. The discrete representation of the rotor model consist of 32 degrees of freedom. To increase the speed of the analysis, the size of the model has been reduced with the IRS method to a system with 8 degrees of freedom. The results show that a small gap between the turbine and discharge ring can be dangerous, due to the risk of contact with high contact forces as a consequence. It has also been observed that backward whirl can occur and in some cases the turbine motion becomes quasi-periodic or chaotic. The endurance of hydropower rotor components is often associated with the dynamic loads acting on the rotating system and the number of start-stop cycles of the unit. Measurements, together with analysis of the rotor dynamics, are often the most powerful methods available to improve understanding of the cause of the dynamic load.

It suggests a new interpretation of principles and techniques to build a Buddhist monastery, contrasting other sites in India, Central Asia, China, Japan, and Korea that follow the placement and the construction of building such as the two cases. ^ My contention is that the monasteries were constructed through the attempts of 2 ̆ 7 adoption 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 adaptation 2 ̆ 7 which demonstrates both the universalization of shared ideas of design and a vernacularization in preference for indigenous building types and local construction methods. ^ The first tendency towards universalization is demonstrated in the adoption of broader intellectual programs in the combination of a 2 ̆ 7 mahacetiya and cetiya 2 ̆ 7, a 2 ̆ 7 Buddha hall and Buddha pagoda 2 ̆ 7 modeled on the law of 2 ̆ 7 causality 2 ̆ 7; the combinations refer to sacred venues and events during the life of the Buddha from his birth to mahaparinirvana passing through great departure, meditation, enlightenment, and preaching. The combination of a hall with two pagodas was an important innovation in the Bulguk monastery. Their amalgamation inside the gallery of Bulguk-sa already appeared at some Buddhist sites in India. These include Nagarjunakonda Buddhist remains of the Mahasangkika School founded between the 3 rd and 4 th century A. D. The monasteries include the grouping of a mahacetiya with twin cetiyas, a revolutionary way to represent sacred places and events. I argue that the homologous Indian Buddha stupa/cetiya and Korean Buddha hall/pagoda combinations are both grounded in the complementary pursuit of 2 ̆ 7 merit-making 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 rebirth into the Pure Land (posthumous well-being) 2 ̆ 7, by linking them through historiographical texts including epigraphy and literary evidence to the ritual life and aims of devotees. They likewise carve out a new standard of the narrative law of causation as a basic conception of the Buddhist mandala. The appearance of twin cetiyas and twin pagodas in the temple complexes 2 ̆ 2 from Nagarjunakonda to Gyeongju 2 ̆ 2 embodied in the three dimensional structures of the primitive idea of twin mandalas, the so-called mandalas of the Womb World and the Diamond World, which culminated in the temples of Heian Japan (794 - 1192) and Liao China (907 - 1125). The representation as the twin pagodas in East Asia also sheds a solid light on the new interpretation of the meaning and function of 2 ̆ 7 pagoda 2 ̆ 7 with that of 2 ̆ 7 stupa 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 cetiya 2 ̆ 7 in the Suvarnaprabhasa-sutra, Rasmivimalavisuddha prabha dharani-sutra, Saddharmapundarika-sutra, etc; its reproduction of Buddhist temple appears through a transnational vocabulary of building types and layouts shared throughout the China, Korea, and Japan, ultimately derived from styles known to have spread from India via Central Asia. This thesis thus shows the universalization of shared concepts and programs through the dissemination of some fundamental ideas in the construction of Buddhist temples. ^ The second tendency towards vernacularization is demonstrated through the adoption and adaptation of local idioms into a temple design, as a new model for 2 ̆ 2 Pure Land architecture 2 ̆ 2 which was an effective media in making the paradisiac milieu as a bridge between the future ultimate happiness and the present suffering world. The two sites depend on the indigenous meanings of pre-Buddhist building types in a persistent use of the taste and needs of votaries. They also fuse different styles in their contextualized application of various structural elements and materials according to different times and venues; particularly, the masonry structure of Bulguk-sa architecture follows in the eighth century the construction methods of the time when such wooden components as <b>brackets,</b> <b>bearing</b> blocks, pillars, beams, etc were in use. I argue that the adopted structural systems appear as localized adaptations in response to the degree of combination between two elements for structural stability, the so-called 2 ̆ 2 piled-up 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 framed 2 ̆ 2 structures. It further proves that Korean architecture absorbed the northern and southern regional construction method of Chinese architecture uncovered in Yingzao Fashi into their regional styles to create a 2 ̆ 7 new 2 ̆ 7 official building for a dynastic power and a legitimate rule in close rapport with Tang China (618 - 907). ^ Based on the understanding of universalization and vernacularization, this dissertation concludes that Bulguk-sa and Nagarjunakonda Buddhist architecture, between the other Buddhist monuments of Central Asia, China, Japan, etc., represent the harmony of a particular vernacularized material 2 ̆ 2 body 2 ̆ 2 with a universalist 2 ̆ 2 spirit 2 ̆ 2 of ideas, situated both firmly amidst a particular set of geographical, geomorphologic, and historic factors and a cosmopolitan philosophical system shared across much of the Asian continent. ...|$|R
