5|$|Article 20 {{provides}} {{protection from}} conviction for offences in certain respects, including the rights against {{ex post facto}} laws, double jeopardy and freedom from self-incrimination. Article 22 provides specific rights to arrested and detained persons, in particular the rights to <b>be</b> <b>informed</b> of the grounds of arrest, consult a lawyer of one's own choice, be produced before a magistrate within 24 hours of the arrest, and the freedom not to be detained beyond that period without an order of the magistrate. The Constitution also authorizes the State to make laws providing for preventive detention, subject to certain other safeguards present in Article 22. The provisions pertaining to preventive detention were discussed with skepticism and misgivings by the Constituent Assembly, and were reluctantly approved after a few amendments in 1949. Article 22 provides that {{when a person is}} detained under any law of preventive detention, the State can detain such person without trial for only three months, and any detention for a longer period must be authorised by an Advisory Board. The person being detained also has the right to <b>be</b> <b>informed</b> about the grounds of detention, and be permitted to make a representation against it, at the earliest opportunity.|$|E

5|$|The Fifth Amendment {{protects against}} double {{jeopardy}} and self-incrimination and guarantees {{the rights to}} due process, grand jury screening of criminal indictments, and compensation for the seizure of private property under eminent domain.

5|$|After the {{formation}} of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic in July 1940, Gens was fired from his job. He was unable to secure a work permit nor was he allowed to continue to live in Kaunas. He went to live with his brother, Solomon, in Vilnius, and although Gens was on a list to be sent to Soviet labor camps, he managed to secure an unregistered job at the Vilnius health department through an old military colleague, Colonel Juozas Åªsas. Gens was not on the official payroll, which meant that the political officer attached to the hospital did not need to <b>be</b> <b>informed</b> of his employment. During June 1941, when thousands of the Lithuanian elites were exiled to Siberia, Gens remained in hiding and was not deported.|$|E
5|$|After {{weeks of}} secret {{negotiations}} between merchants and protest leaders, an agreement was finally reached {{during the first}} week of May. According to the agreement, small, selected groups of African Americans would order food at the downtown lunch counters on a day known in advance to the merchants. The merchants would prepare their employees for the event and instruct them to serve the customers without trouble. This arrangement would continue in a controlled manner for a couple of weeks and then all controls would be taken off, at which point the merchants and protest leaders would reconvene to evaluate the results. Also as part of the agreement, the media was to <b>be</b> <b>informed</b> of the settlement and requested to provide only accurate, non-sensational coverage.|$|E

If an autopsy is conducted and reveals that the death is unnatural, the police will conduct further investigations into the cause of death with the family's assistance.

Without the forbidding example of Buck Weaver to haunt them, it is unlikely Mann and Sand would have snitched on their fellow players. After Landis' unforgiving treatment of the popular and basically honest Weaver they dared not to. And once prospectively crooked players knew that honest players would no longer shield them, the scandals stopped.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Harvey's {{account of}} the smoke-filled room had Harding being sent for {{in the early morning}} hours, to <b>be</b> <b>informed</b> by Harvey that the Ohioan would be the candidate. Harvey stated he asked if there was {{anything}} in Harding's background that might harm his candidacy, to which the senator, who had had at least one extramarital affair, replied there was not. Harding biographer Charles W. Murray noted that there is no evidence besides Harvey's word that Harding went to the Hays suite that night, and that other participants denied that Harding was there. Harding was so uncertain of victory that he filed for re-election to the Senate, though Daugherty continued to urge delegates to support him.|$|E

50|$|There is a {{misconception}} that a physician only {{needs to do}} what other physicians typically do (i.e. standard of care).

5|$|French {{military}} planners had to balance competing demands for the 1781 campaign. After the unsuccessful American attempts of co-operation leading to failed assaults at Rhode Island and Savannah, they realised more {{active participation in}} North America was needed. However, they also needed to co-ordinate their actions with Spain, where there was potential interest in making {{an assault on the}} British stronghold of Jamaica. It turned out that the Spanish were not interested in operations agaynst Jamaica until after they had dealt with an expected British attempt to reinforce besieged Gibraltar, and merely wanted to <b>be</b> <b>informed</b> of the movements of the West Indies fleet.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known hatt-Ä± hÃ¼mayun {{is the one}} sent by Sultan Murad I to Evrenos Bey in 1386, commending {{the commander}} for his conquests and giving him {{advice on how to}} administer people. Until the reign of Murad III, Viziers used to present matters orally to the Sultans, who would then give their consent or denial, also orally. While hatt-Ä± hÃ¼mayuns were very rare prior to this, they proliferated afterward, especially during the reigns of Sultans such as AbdÃ¼lhamid I, Selim III and Mahmud II, who wanted to increase their control and <b>be</b> <b>informed</b> of everything.|$|E
5|$|A {{few years}} earlier, a healthy Nalla {{took part in}} various street theatre {{performances}} protesting against multinational corporation-driven industrialisation, {{that resulted in the}} marginalisation of the labour force. He was at odds with Kandasamy Padayatchi (Nassar), a manipulative factory owner who refused to give his workers a raise. Nalla satirically imitated Padayatchi in many of his shows. However, in an unexpected turn of events, Nalla and Padayatchi's daughter Balasaraswathi, called Bala (Kiran Rathod), fell in love with each other. Realising their chances of getting together would be slim if Padayatchi knew about their relationship, Nalla and Bala decided to elope to Kerala. Nalla boarded a bus bound for Kerala, and on his way to meet Bala, the bus crashed on a hillside leaving him scarred, disfigured, and partially paralysed for life. After recovering from his wounds, he visited Bala only to <b>be</b> <b>informed</b> by Padayatchi that his daughter was already married and has settled abroad. Padayatchi had earlier lied to Bala that Nalla died in the accident. It was also at this time that Nalla became a firm believer in kindness and love. Despite suffering from an inferiority complex due to his scarred and deformed body, Nalla performs community service and social work with renewed fervour while continuing to fight for union causes.|$|E

5|$|Negotiations {{continued}} during autumn 1938. The Soviets {{reduced their}} demands: a Red Army operation {{was not an}} option anymore and the focus was shifted on securing the Gulf of Finland. The Soviets wanted to <b>be</b> <b>informed</b> of key elements of the FinnishâEstonian Gulf blockade, the secret military plan against the Baltic Fleet. Furthermore, Yartsev suggested that the Finns fortify the Suursaari island, but that the Soviets would take care of its defence. During the negotiations, Rudolf Holsti resigned as foreign minister, although not for reasons associated with the negotiations, and his place was taken by Eljas Erkko. Holsti was rather anti-German, so the resignation set off rumours, quickly quelled by the Finnish government, that he had been forced to resign by a Finnish government sympathetic to the Germans. The Finns attempted to appear even-handed, and the interior ministry issued an order banning the extreme-right IKL. The ban was reversed by the Finnish courts as being unconstitutional. Many years later, the minister in charge at that time, Urho Kekkonen, admitted that this was a simple gesture, to suggest to Moscow that Finland did not harbour a German fifth column.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the brigade}} arrived, {{many of the}} Germans around the drop zone withdrew or offered no further resistance. The first unit on the ground, 10 Para, {{attacked}} and destroyed the Dutch SS Wachbattalion while Brigadier Hackett personally captured ten Germans shortly after landing. When Hackett arrived at brigade headquarters, he was informed by Lieutenant Colonel Mckenzie of the division's staff about the change in plans, explaining that 11 Para was to be detached from his brigade to support the push into Arnhem. At {{the same time the}} KOSB, until then responsible for defending the northern side of the landing grounds, were attached to 4th Parachute Brigade to replace 11 Para. Meanwhile, the KOSB still had to defend landing-zone 'L', to protect gliders arriving on day three. While Hackett formulated a new plan, Mckenzie returned to divisional headquarters, to <b>be</b> <b>informed</b> on his arrival that 60 German tanks were approaching Arnhem from the north. Transport aircraft passing over occupied channel ports had confirmed German suspicions of a second lift such {{that they were able to}} give their troops at Arnhem forty-five minutes advance notice of the allies' arrival. Prepared in advance for such an eventuality, a Waffen SS mobile unit had been dispatched towards the likely landing grounds.|$|E
5|$|The detainee {{is also to}} <b>be</b> <b>informed</b> within 14 days of his or {{her right}} to make {{representations}} against the order to an advisory board, which is required to hear and consider the detainee's representations.

The board has the powers of a court to summon and examine witnesses, and to order that documents be produced. It evaluates the evidence and must make recommendations to the President concerning the matter within three months of the date of detention. When the advisory board recommends the release of the detainee against the Minister's decision, the President exercises personal discretion whether the detainee should be released. Before exercising his discretion, the President is required to consult the Council of Presidential Advisers.|$|E
