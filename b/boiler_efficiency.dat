Tile population includes 2, 930 small, hand-fired boilers and 227 larger traveling grate stoker-fired boilers. These boilers are important contributors to air quality problems in Krakow, and an assessment of their efficiency and emissions characteristics was recently undertaken. For the larger, stoker-fired <b>boilers,</b> <b>efficiency</b> was measured using a stack-loss method In addition to the normal baseline fuel, the effects of coal cleaning and grading were evaluated Testing was done at two selected sites. <b>Boiler</b> <b>efficiencies</b> {{were found to be}} low- 50 % to 67 %. These boilers operate without combustion controls or instrumentation for flue gas analysis. As a result, excess air levels are very high (up to 400 %) leading to poor performance. Emissions were found to be typical for boilers of this type. Using the improved fuels yields reductions in emissions and improvement in efficiency when combined with proper adjustments. In the case of the hand-fired boilers, one set of cast-iron boilers and one set of steel <b>boilers</b> were tested. <b>Efficiency</b> in this case was measured using an input-output method for sets of three boilers taken together as a system.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analysis conducted upon the sensor data {{gathered from the}} distribution control system of a central heating and cooling plant in Ottawa, Canada. After observing that the performance of four boilers and five chillers of this plant vary substantially in time under steady-state conditions, data-driven models were developed to explain this variability from the archived sensor data. By employing a forward stepwise regression and a repeated random sub-sampling cross-validation approach, two-layer feed-forward artificial neural network models with seven to fifteen hidden-nodes were selected for each boiler and chiller. The selected boiler models could explain 84 to 95 % of the variability in a <b>boiler's</b> <b>efficiency,</b> and the selected chiller models could explain 65 to 94 % of the variability in a chiller's coefficient of performance. Among studied nine variables, the most informative ones to predict a <b>boiler's</b> <b>efficiency</b> were identified as follows: flue gas O 2 concentration, pressure, part-load ratio, forced draft fan state, and return water flow rate. Unlike boilers, all four studied variables were found useful in predicting a chiller's coefficient of performance. These four variables were the return water flow rate, part-load ratio, outdoor temperature, and return water temperature.

Approximately 30% of the ConEd steam system’s installed capacity and 50% {{of the annual}} steam generated comes from cogeneration.

40|$|Based on the {{existing}} biomass co-firing technologies and the known innate drawbacks of dedicated biomass firing, including slagging, corrosion and the dependence on fuel, {{a new model of}} agro/forestry residue pellets/shreds and coal co-fired in a large Pulverized Coal (PC) furnace was proposed, and the corresponding technical and economic assessments were performed by co-firing testing in a 300 MW PC furnace and discounted cash flow technique. The developed model is more dependent on injection co-firing and combined with co-milling co-firing. Co-firing not only reduces CO 2 emission, but also does not significantly affect the fly ash use in cement industry, construction industry and agriculture. Moreover, economic assessments show that in comparison with dedicated firing in grate furnace, agro/forestry residues and coal co-firing in a large PC furnace is highly economic. Otherwise, when the co-firing ratio was below 5 wt%, the <b>boiler</b> co-firing <b>efficiency</b> was 0. 05 %– 0. 31 % higher than that of dedicated PC combustion, and <b>boiler</b> <b>efficiencies</b> were about 0. 2 % higher with agro/forestry residues co-firing in the bottom and top burner systems than that in a middle burner system...|$|R
