5|$|The Passing Zone {{made its}} first {{appearance}} during season 1 of America's Got Talent, {{as part of the}} Chicago auditions aired on July 5, 2006. Wee bounced a rubber (prop) <b>bowling</b> <b>ball</b> off of Morse's face ("to make sure you're paying attention"), then climbed onto Morse's shoulders while Morse balanced on a Rola Bola long enough for the duo to juggle a total of six flaming torches in unison. The judges' assessments were not unanimous; David Hasselhoff rejected them ("That's the act?!") while Brandy and Piers Morgan wanted to see more.|$|E
5|$|Homer, having {{forgotten}} Marge's birthday, rushes {{out to buy}} her {{a present}} at the Springfield Mall. He finds a <b>bowling</b> <b>ball</b> and decides to buy it for her. During the night of her birthday dinner at the Singing Sirloin, Marge is happy with the kids' presents of French perfume from Bart and a macaroni and glue card of her as the Mona Lisa from Lisa. However, she is offended by Homer's gift as it is another demonstration of his thoughtless gift giving history, which her sisters Patty and Selma Bouvier had reminded her of earlier. To make matters worse, as he presents his 'gift', it bursts through its box and squashes Marge's birthday cake. Deeply resentful, Marge reminds him that not only has she never gone bowling in her life, but the ball is also inscribed with his name.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} 2007, the USBC {{completed}} a two-year study on <b>bowling</b> <b>ball</b> motion and how advanced, high-tech equipment may influence lane conditions and scoring. Establishing a <b>Bowling</b> <b>Ball</b> Specifications Task Force—comprising research engineers and volunteers from ball manufacturing companies—the USBC sought {{to better understand the}} motion of bowling balls using scientific research and data analysis. Test equipment included, but was not limited to, a robotic ball-thrower, a Computer Aided Tracking System ("Super C.A.T.S."), 59 reactive resin and particle bowling balls from various manufacturers, and eight lanes in a climate-controlled facility.|$|E
25|$|Grizzly {{bears are}} {{especially}} dangerous {{because of the}} force of their bite, which has been measured at over 8 megapascals (1160 psi). It {{has been estimated that}} a bite from a grizzly could even crush a <b>bowling</b> <b>ball.</b>|$|E
25|$|The USBC {{completed}} {{data analysis}} and released a lengthy report {{on its website}} (www.bowl.com) {{to the public in}} the spring of 2008. As of April 1, 2009, The USBC now regulates the chemical surface roughness of all bowling balls manufactured for certified ten-pin bowling. This specification is a direct result from the ball motion study, as the surface roughness of the coverstock of a <b>bowling</b> <b>ball</b> was the number one variable (out of 18) that affected the strength (how much a ball hooks) of a <b>bowling</b> <b>ball.</b> The radius of gyration specification has also been tightened and went into effect in 2010. For up to date information on ball specifications, check the USBC Equipment Specifications website at http://bowl.com/equipandspecs/index.jsp.|$|E
500|$|Mirkin {{remembered the}} episode [...] "very fondly" [...] because {{when it was}} finished, the staff {{received}} customized The Simpsons <b>bowling</b> <b>balls,</b> <b>bowling</b> bags, and Pin Pal shirts as gifts. Scully said the <b>bowling</b> <b>balls</b> were [...] "really cool" [...] because they were yellow and had The Simpsons logo on them.|$|R
50|$|Columbia Industries was {{a company}} {{involved}} in the manufacture and sale of <b>bowling</b> <b>balls</b> and ten-pin bowling-related accessories. Their most notable brand name was Columbia 300, which produced {{some of the most}} well-known balls in the sport. Beginning in 1960 in Ephrata, Washington (near the Columbia River), Columbia Industries was the first manufacturer to successfully use polyester resin ("plastic") in <b>bowling</b> <b>balls.</b> Prior to this, nearly all <b>bowling</b> <b>balls</b> were of a hard rubber material. The company later moved to San Antonio, Texas.|$|R

A {{group of}} men stand in a line on an outdoor lawn, covered with lawn <b>bowling</b> <b>balls.</b> The men wear similar apparel, such as pale, wide-brimmed hats, pale shirts, pale slacks, and ties. Some of the men are kneeling, {{appearing}} to roll the lawn <b>bowling</b> <b>balls,</b> which {{appear to be the}} size of large grapefruits. Others can be seen standing, holding lawn <b>bowling</b> <b>balls,</b> and appear to be conversing with each other. Park benches and tree trunks can be seen behind the men, in the background...|$|R
25|$|The way {{the finger}} holes are {{arranged}} {{on the ball}} surface changes how the <b>bowling</b> <b>ball</b> moves down the lane. The drilling configuration {{is determined by the}} positions of the finger holes relative to the markings {{on the surface of the}} ball, and may also be positioned relative to the axis of rotation of a particular bowler. The axis is typically identified according to the Positive Axis Point (PAP), which marks the axis before axis migration has begun.|$|E
25|$|Pendulums {{are used}} in science {{education}} to demonstrate the law of conservation of energy. A heavy object such as a <b>bowling</b> <b>ball</b> or wrecking ball {{is attached to a}} string. The weight is then moved to within a few inches of a volunteer's face, then released and allowed to swing and come back. In most instances, the weight reverses direction slightly before the position it was released from, and the volunteer is unharmed. On occasion, the volunteer does not stand still and is injured.|$|E
25|$|Sanding of the <b>bowling</b> <b>ball</b> {{surface was}} another {{technique}} {{to soften the}} ball's surface. Once the track area {{is located on the}} ball, the bowler would sand the track area to make the surface more abrasive, allowing the ball to hook more. And, bowlers would apply solvents to the ball's surface during tournament play—rubbing the chemicals into the cover using a rag. More rules by the ABC had to be passed, including restrictions from doctoring the bowling ball's surface at any time once the ball has passed inspection by an official.|$|E

25|$|DATAR {{was similar}} in concept to Benjamin's display. The {{trackball}} used four disks {{to pick up}} motion, two each for the X and Y directions. Several rollers provided mechanical support. When the ball was rolled, the pickup discs spun and contacts on their outer rim made periodic contact with wires, producing pulses of output with each movement of the ball. By counting the pulses, the physical movement of the ball could be determined. A digital computer calculated the tracks and sent the resulting data to other ships in a task force using pulse-code modulation radio signals. This trackball used a standard Canadian five-pin <b>bowling</b> <b>ball.</b> It was not patented, {{since it was a}} secret military project.|$|E
25|$|There is {{an optimal}} <b>bowling</b> <b>ball</b> {{speed at which}} the player maximizes the chance to knock down all ten bowling pins. Optimal ball speed, which {{is defined as the}} time it takes for the ball to travel from one foot past the foul line to the head pin, is 2.3 seconds (this number can shift to 2.2 or 2.4 {{depending}} on the dryness or slickness of the lane). A ball that is rolled too fast will not give the pins enough time to “mix” with other pins, or in other words, to knock each other down in a domino effect motion. Conversely, a ball rolled too slowly will deflect too much and {{will not be able to}} knock down all the pins.|$|E
25|$|The <b>bowling</b> <b>ball</b> {{speed is}} {{affected}} primarily by three factors: gravitational forces, forward momentum, and downswing acceleration. The {{speed of the}} ball as generated by gravitational forces during the swing depends primarily on the total arc of the swing. This arc is further affected by {{the length of the}} bowler’s arm and by the height at which the swing begins. Assuming a longer arm and higher swing peak will maximize the speed that the gravitational forces produce. Forward momentum is manifested in the walking approach of the bowler prior to the throw. The “four-step” approach is most commonly applied, with the right foot slightly ahead of the left at starting position (for right handed bowlers). Longer legs and a faster approach during the third step and downswing will increase the ball speed. Finally, the deliberate acceleration of the arm during downswing is of critical focus. This particular factor is difficult to master, however, because one can easily force the armswing and thus accelerate too quickly or cause the arm to deviate from the natural path.|$|E

25|$|A game of bowling {{consists}} of ten frames. In each frame, the bowler {{will have two}} chances to knock down as many pins as possible with their <b>bowling</b> <b>ball.</b> In games {{with more than one}} bowler, as is common, every bowler will take their frame in a predetermined order before the next frame begins. If a bowler is able to knock down all ten pins with the first ball, they are awarded a strike. If the bowler is able to knock down all 10 pins with the two balls of a frame, it is known as a spare. Bonus pins are awarded for both of these, depending on what is scored in the next two balls (for a strike) or one ball (for a spare). The bowler is allowed to throw two extra balls for achieving a strike in the tenth frame, or one extra ball for achieving a spare. This allows for a potential of 12 strikes in a single game, and a maximum score of 300 pins, a perfect game. The player with the highest pinfall at the end of ten frames wins. Although, if there is a time limit and if time runs out before the end of ten frames bowling stops, and the person with the highest pinfall wins the game.|$|E
500|$|To {{achieve the}} point-of-view of a rolling <b>bowling</b> <b>ball</b> the Coen {{brothers}} mounted a camera [...] "on {{something like a}} barbecue spit", according to Ethan, and then dollied it along the lane. The challenge for them was figuring out the relative speeds of the forward motion and the rotating motion. CGI was used to create {{the vantage point of}} the thumb hole in the <b>bowling</b> <b>ball.</b>|$|E
500|$|The Beer 'N' Brawl redneck bar {{is based}} on the bar in the film Urban Cowboy. The Beer 'N' Brawl sells Laramie High Tar cigarettes, a {{reference}} to the American cigarette brand Laramie. After arriving home from the Beer 'N' Brawl, Lurleen's song is stuck in Homer's head, and he even sings it to his <b>bowling</b> <b>ball</b> for good luck. Homer's co-worker Lenny decides to give it a shot and sings [...] "There's a Kind of Hush (All Over the World)" [...] to his <b>bowling</b> <b>ball.</b> Homer says that the last song before Lurleen's [...] "Your Wife Don't Understand You" [...] that he could not get out of his mind was the Lipps Inc song [...] "Funkytown". The syndicated country comedy show that Lurleen appears on, Ya-Hoo!, {{is based on}} the country television series Hee Haw, which ran in syndication from 1971 to 1993.|$|E
2500|$|Historically, <b>bowling</b> <b>balls</b> {{were often}} made from dense {{hardwoods}} such as Lignum Vitae, but {{starting in the}} early 20th century, hard rubber became the primary material for <b>bowling</b> <b>balls.</b> The first <b>bowling</b> <b>balls</b> to be made from polyester ("plastic") were produced in the late 1950s. This would become the predominant material in the 1970s. In the early 1980s, polyurethane ("urethane") <b>bowling</b> <b>balls</b> were introduced. Urethane balls provided greater friction on the lane, which allowed for a greater angle of entry of {{the ball to the}} [...] "pocket" [...] (space between two of the front-most bowling pins, known for providing the greatest percentage of strikes), and as a better match to the increasing use of polyurethane varnish on wood lanes, and with wood lane [...] "overlays" [...] and fully synthetic lanes using a polyurethane surface. This is desirable, as a greater entry angle tends to provide a higher striking percentage.|$|R

500|$|Wii Sports {{consists}} of five separate sports games—tennis, baseball, bowling, golf, and boxing—accessed {{from the main}} menu. [...] The games use the motion sensor capabilities of the Wii Remote and Nunchuk attachment to control {{the actions of the}} on-screen ball pit. The player moves the remote in a similar manner to how the separate games are played in real life; for example, holding and swinging the Wii Remote like a golf club, baseball bat or <b>bowling</b> <b>ball.</b> Some aspects of the gameplay are computer controlled. In tennis, player movement is controlled by the Wii, while the swinging of the racket is controlled by the player. Baseball {{consists of}} batting and pitching, with all of the fielding and baserunning handled by the Wii.|$|E
500|$|The first segment, [...] "The Devil and Homer Simpson", {{was written}} by Daniels and McGrath. The first time Devil Flanders appears, he looks {{the same as the}} devil Chernabog from the 1940 Walt Disney {{produced}} film Fantasia; Silverman particularly admired the animation in that sequence. Oakley loved the idea of Flanders being the Devil because he is the one you would least expect. He also thought Harry Shearer {{did a good job of}} playing Flanders in a much darker way, while remaining very true to the character. Many scenes had to be cut to shorten the segment, including one that showed Homer's severed head being used as a <b>bowling</b> <b>ball</b> by a demon in hell. This scene later appeared in the clip show episode [...] "The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular", which aired in the show's seventh season.|$|E
