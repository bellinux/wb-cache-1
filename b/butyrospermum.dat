50|$|Shea {{butter is}} an oil extract from the kernel of the sheanut produce of the shea tree Vitellaria paradoxa (syn. <b>Butyrospermum</b> parkii, <b>Butyrospermum</b> paradoxum) (Sapotaceae). It grows profusely {{in the wild}} without any special {{nourishment}} and attention. Every part of this indigenous tree {{is found to be}} useful. Its distribution is exclusive to sub-Saharan West Africa in the savannas, particularly in Burkina Faso where it provides economic sustenance to rural women. Its distribution extends from Senegal to Ethiopia and Uganda over stretch of savanna nearly a thousand kilometers long covering an area of 1 million square km of wooded grassland (about 500 million trees) across 19 countries of the region.|$|E
5000|$|The {{tree was}} {{formerly}} {{classified in the}} genus <b>Butyrospermum,</b> meaning [...] "butter seed".

5000|$|The French {{explorer}} René Caillié {{stopped at}} Zangasso on 12 February 1828 on his journey to Timbuktu. He was travelling with a caravan transporting kola nuts to Djenné. In his book Travels through Central Africa to Timbuctoo published in 1830, he spelled {{the name of}} the village as Sanasso. He wrote:As we advanced the soil became sandy and well cultivated. The country was generally open, yet there were some cés and nédés rhamnus lotus and nauclea. We met a numerous caravan from Jenné, laden with salt. This caravan was composed of about two hundred men, sixty women, and twenty five asses. About nine o'clock in the morning we halted at Sanasso. From Toumaré to Jenné, wood is so scarce that the greater part of the inhabitants burn millet stubble. Sanasso is shaded by bombaces and baobabs. Like all Bambara villages in this region, it is built of bricks baked in the sun. The houses have only a ground floor: they are very dirty, and surrounded with walls. Caillié recorded details of many of the plants. The [...] "cés" [...] are shea trees Vitellaria paradoxa (formerly <b>Butyrospermum</b> parkii) from which shea butter is made.

The influence of the thickness of kernels and of time was determined, according to the central composite experimental design, in comparison with the extraction yield, the acid and peroxide values, the melting properties and the composition of unsaponifiable matter of butter. The maximum butter yield is obtained with kernels content 10 to 15 % of residual water. The cutting up of kernels makes easier the vaporizing of water but, also increases acidity and reduces contents of unsaponifiable, triterpenic alcohols and sterols successive in an increase of interface between enzymes and molecules. While, a long exposure is favourable to the appearance of peroxides which destabilize not stable compounds with high melting point.

40|$|Context: Oils {{and butter}} of seed from Brazilian {{biodiversity}} are extending {{the range of}} innovative products for cosmetics development. They have a fat potential similar to skin composition, leading to the improved performance of these product. Aims: Improve the emulsions spreadability through prior screening of grease composition and studying the viscosity, and the emulsions accelerated stability. Methods: Emulsions were formulated using oils from semiarid plants from Bahia: Syagrus coronate, Pachira retusa, and Pachira aquatica, so as to compare them with oils already standard {{in the production of}} cosmetics. Spreadability and stability tests were made comparing the results. The same criteria were used with Amazon seed butter: Virola surinamensis, <b>Butyrospermum</b> parkii, Astrocaryum murumuru, Theobroma cacao and Theobroma grandiflorum. For the emulsions screening and performance, a system was developed for oil/ butter, following tests of accelerated stability, viscosity, and spreadability. Results: The combined system of spreadability was optimized using screening. Emollients containing oleic and palmitic acids, and light chain fatty acids obtained good spreadability. The oil emulsion containing Pachira retusa and Virola surinamensis butter had a higher viscosity. Conclusions: With high content of fatty acids such as oleic, palmitic or the light chain fatty acids obtain an appropriated appearance, texture, and spreadability for cosmetic use. Thus, oils with a low fatty acid content may be combined with butter that have a high fatty acid content and vice-versa.

The Old Continent is increasingly jeopardized by the obnoxious assaults of these insects, due to the high density of housing, to the haphazard urbanization and globalization, to the novel ecological patterns in use in the bio-masonry and to the antique remnant of mansions and sacred architecture. Presently, sustainable management of termite pests includes the use of preventative measures (eg. application of repellents/antifeedants) {{and the use of}} baits with slow-acting termiticides. The nuts of <b>Butyrospermum</b> parkii (Sapotaceae), tree native to West-Central Africa, are used to produce shea (karité) butter, welcome in the manufacture of cosmetics and food stuff. Aborigens believe that the residue from shea-butter extraction is capable to protect their houses from termites, which are extremely abundant in these regions (1). To verify if these popular beliefs have scientific basis, experiments were performed with European subterranean and drywood termites, respectively Reticulitermes lucifugus (Rhinotermitidae) and Kalotermes flavicollis (Kalotermitidae). Therefore an hydroglyceric extract of shea nut shells (the only pericarp) and an acqueous extract of shea cake (obtained from de-husked ground kernels, and thus phase oil-free) were used in short-term choice-tests and in long-term force-feeding trials, in order to assess the feeding deterrence or stimulation [...] The results show that for both termite species shea cake extract is a feeding deterrent, thus confirming its potential as a wood preservative. However, most interestingly, the extract from shea nut shells elicited a very strong feeding stimulant effect, which looks extremely promising to increase the attractiveness -and therefore efficiency- of the baits. Further analytical investigations (to determine the total rate of terpenoids and polyphenols) on both extracts are in progress in order to identify the active components responsible for the observed effects. 1) J.

30|$|Industrials {{interest}} in fats as raw material, resides in their exceptional quality and potentialities of exploitation in several fields. Hence cocoa butter, palm, palmist and coco oils are so widely exploited that the Codex Stan 210 (1999) established standards {{in order to}} guide traders/industrials. Many other fats like avocado, olive, illipe and jojoba are also involved in cosmetic or pharmaceutical products {{on the basis of}} their interesting characteristics (Pontillon 1996; Joanny 2005; AAK Global 2012) Shea (Vitellaria paradoxa, syn. <b>Butyrospermum</b> parkii, B. paradoxa) butter which represents an important socio-economical agro-resource for its producing countries, is more and more being exploited in several industrial fields (Hall et al. 1996, Schreckenberg 2004; PNUD 2010). This increasing importance is mainly linked to its properties which would justify the wide range of its empiric uses (Hall et al. 1996). Indeed, according to these authors, shea butter has long been used in sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere for medicinal, culinary, and other applications (Tomaszkiewicz-Potepa 2012; Tomaszkiewicz-Potepa and Sliwa 2012). Nowadays, shea buter, mainly the traditional one (called BIO-shea butter) interests cosmetic and pharmaceutical firms (Pontillon 1996; Elias and Carney 2004; Nahm 2011; AAK Global 2012). Nevertheless these firms are highly exigent about shea butter quality. Whereas, the traditional processes often lead to shea butter non-conform to recommended standards (Hall et al. 1996; Mégnanou and Diopoh 2008). Several studies have been undertaken to improve shea butter properties; most of these studies just focused on one or two effecting factors. Those of Mégnanou and Niamke (2013 a) took into account many factors like nuts drying mode and time, kernels quality and roasting time, so did shea butter wrapper hygienic quality. The results drew the effects of such factors on shea butter physicochemical and microbiological characteristics, and consequently induced the optimized traditional process (Bup et al. 2012; Pouliot and Elias 2013; Nsogning et al. 2014). The resulted shea butter was in conformity with the unrefined shea butter standards for trade as proposed by UEMOA (2011). Nevertheless, because of the exigencies of industrials which take into account many other properties, shea butter utilization as raw material (Cosmetic and pharmaceutical) might be linked to its exceptional quality and high potential of exploitation (Honfo et al. 2013, 2014).|$|E
40|$|The {{shea butter}} tree grows {{throughout}} savanna areas of West Africa and is prized for the oil extracted from its nuts, and {{for the sale of}} the nuts themselves. Unfortunately, processing and marketing difficulties mean that only 40 % of the produce is used profitably. The {{shea butter tree}} (<b>Butyrospermum</b> parkii) grows in the semi-arid zone from the east of Senegal to the south of Chad, and is found mainly in Mali and Burkina Faso and in northern parts of Cote d'lvoire, Ghana, Togo, Benin and Nigeria. It is a small tree with a short trunk and dark green leaves, but its fruit has amazing potential. The population density may be around 50 to 60 trees per hectare in remote areas, but this decreases sharply in populated districts. The fruit is picked up from the ground by women who extract a high-quality pure oil by grinding the nuts with a pestle and mortar. With this they make the prized shea butter, which is much sought after throughout Africa, either for their own consumption or for sale at markets. When the harvest is plentiful the women contract to sell the nuts or the butter to traders, and this is often their only source of ready cash. Indeed, Olivier Krugg, who has made a study of the shea butter tree for the Centre d'Echange et Promotion des Artisans en Zones a Equiper (CEPAZE) in Mali, says: 'The shea butter tree provides more than half the income of village women in these areas. ' Shea butter is not only used widely in cooking: it also has cosmetic and pharmacological uses in treating colds and sprains, promoting the healing of wounds, and as a beauty product. Its by-products are also useful: the pulp and the shell make a waterproof material used on the walls of huts, farmers spread them as fertilizer, or burn them as fuel. A multi-purpose tree Shea butter also has industrial value in the North: it {{can be used as a}} cocoa butter substitute, for coating in chocolate manufacture, and in the cosmetic industry. It has highly desirable softness and smoothness, and pharmacologists recognize its healing and protective powers for the skin. Despite this multiplicity of potential uses, around 60 % of the harvest rots in the bush, according to the experts, mainly as a result of several factors which hamper processing and commercial exploitation. Bernard Clamagirand, Director of CEPAZE, who has been working for some years on small-scale centrifugal processing machinery, says 'Shea butter nut is extremely difficult to process. The nuts contain a gummy substance which clogs the sieves and and other parts of the machine. ' The latest processing machine, the Mockarite, is still at the experimental stage but looks promising. Small or large-scale production? Similar problems are encountered on an industrial scale in the processing plants of Mali, Burkina Faso and Benin. The presses will clog in exactly the same way if the women deliver nuts which are incompletely dried. Furthermore, shea butter trees crop very irregularly (see box), which means the presses can lie idle for two or three years, adding to economic difficulties. The main producer countries are now trying to establish marketing strategies which will exploit the shea butter tree more fully. In Burkina Faso, Togo and Benin, harvesting and marketing have been nationalized, though in Mali and Cote d'Ivoire they have been left in the hands of private enterprise. Only time will tell which policy is the most effective.

40|$|Most {{nuts are}} highly nutritious {{and some have}} a high sale value. Cashew and {{macadamia}} are much in demand for export while other kinds of nuts are produced more locally and may be unknown outside a particular region. Some of these also {{have the potential to}} become useful, productive and profitable crops elsewhere. Typically, most nut species are moderate to large trees suitable for planting singly in gardens, hedgerows, orchards or as part of agroforestry. As well as cropping, they provide shade and stabilize the soil. Some have very deep roots and remain productive under surprisingly arid conditions. The cashew (Anacardium occidentale) is the most widely grown nut, excepting coconut and oilpalm which are in a different crop category. It originated in the American tropics from Mexico to Brazil, but has long since spread successfully to many lowland tropical areas in Africa and Asia. The largest African producers of cashews are Mozambique and Tanzania with smaller amounts being produced in Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Nigeria and Senegal. But there is much greater potential for this crop. The nuts have a high export value, while the cashew apple can be consumed fresh or dried (See Spore 35 page 4). The shell of the nut yields phenol-containing oils which are used for preserving, waterproofing and, after distillation, for brake-linings, inks and cements. The cashew grows on relatively dry and infertile soils but requires high temperatures and no rainfall during flowering and harvesting in order to produce optimum yields. Since harvesting is by hand, plentiful, inexpensive labour is essential. This is true of most nuts and fruits and may be seen as advantageous since harvesting provides an income opportunity in rural areas. Processing is necessary to remove the cashew shell nut liquid which can blister human skin. In the past, East African output was shipped to India for processing but now processing plants are being built in Kenya, Mozambique and Tanzania. The macadamia (Macadamia integrifolia) is a more recent arrival in Africa, having originated in Australia. Macadamias require a frost-free sub-tropical climate with at least 125 cm of well-distributed rainfall per year. They will grow {{on a wide variety of}} soils if drainage is adequate. However, wind is a hazard: the wood is brittle, and where there are strong winds plantations must be protected by windbreaks. Nuts of the wet tropics The kola nut (Cola nitida), dike nut (Irvingia gaboneusis) and njansan (Ricinodendron africanum) all grow in wet forest regions but the kola is the most widely grown; it is widely traded as a bitter chewing stimulant. The kola is still mainly harvested from forests but is increasingly planted in orchards, in cocoa plantations and among coffee. The tree is slow growing and only comes into full production in about the twentieth year. The dike nut matures in seven years and although exploitation is still limited to selfplanted trees the dike seems suitable for planting in hedges, wooded areas, mixed orchards and pure groves. The fruit looks like a small mango and can be eaten in the same way but it is the kernels that are most esteemed: when heated they yield a thick oil. The kernels are also ground to make a paste for thickening stews in the same way as the groundnut and njansan. Njansans are tall trees producing fruits with kernels that have several culinary uses. They can be eaten grilled or ground into a paste and oil can be extracted from the kernels. Most exploitation is from the wild but trees are now being planted deliberately in some regions. Nuts for arid regions The mongongo nut (Ricinodendron rauteanenii from the Kalahari and the ye-eb (Codeauxin edulis) from Somalia are staples of local diet in very arid regions and the practicality of these species being planted as desert orchards in their countries or origin and elsewhere is being investigated. Germination and seedling health remain problematic. Yosef Mizrahi, Professor of Plant Physiology and Horticulture at the Ben Gurion University, Israel found that of a thousand mongongo nuts not one germinated. However, his team subsequently discovered that just one minutes' exposure to ethylene was enough to trigger germination in 80 - 100 % of mongongo seeds. The Ben Gurion team also had problems with propagating ye-eb: while the seeds germinated well and developed in a nursery, they failed to thrive when planted out in orchards. The ye-eb develops long roots as a young seedling and this can be damaged very easily at transplanting. An arid land species which is much more widely exploited, although again there have been difficulties domesticating it as orchard plantings, is the shea butter tree (<b>Butyrospermum</b> parkii). The shea nut is used throughout the Sahel for food and as a raw material for cosmetics and medicines. It has considerable economic potential (Spore 32). At a time when tree planting is being promoted widely in most parts of the tropics there is ample evidence to suggest that one or more species of nuts may be suitable candidates for selection. Perennial species require little cultural attention and most nut species appear to thrive on poor soils with little or no demand for agrochemical inputs. They deserve more attention than they have received in the past. Most nuts are highly nutritious and some have a high sale value. Cashew and macadamia are much in demand for export while other kinds of nuts are produced more locally and may be unknown outside a particular region. Some of these also have the [...] ...|$|E
40|$|It was {{the wicked}} uncle of Aladdin, in the Tales of the Arabian Nights, who offered 'new lamps for old'. He {{wanted to find}} an ancient magic lamp that could give him access to a hoard of {{treasure}} for his own personal use. When agricultural developers talk about 'new' crops, the crops they are thinking about are also not really new but they hope that these crops will lead to far wider prosperity and wealth for farmers, rural communities and even national economies. Throughout history, thousands of species of plants {{have been used by}} man for food but only a few, perhaps 150 or so, have been commercially cultivated. Most people in the world today derive the bulk of their food needs from about twenty plant species - cereals, roots, legumes, sugar cane and sugar beet, coconuts and bananas. This means that plant breeding, crop protection and the development of processing technology have all focused on a handful of major cash crops. This has had a self-perpetuating effect and, by and large, plant species that do not fall within this category are still largely under-exploited; while such minority crops may be highly valued locally as part of a complex farming system, they are not perceived by growers or traders to have commercial potential. This is partly because European food habits have nowadays become fashionable in the tropics, just as heavy denim jeans have also become fashionable. While the trend towards fewer crop varieties is recognized and understood, is it {{in the best interests of}} food security, let alone economic prosperity? There are always risks associated with monoculture, whether from a disease or pest infestation or a collapse in world prices and it is, in any case, hard to make a commercial success of the high volume, low value products upon which ACP economies have traditionally come to depend. A diversified range of high or added value products is economically more attractive, but it has to be admitted that markets for new products are hard to develop. In fact a niche market may be almost as difficult to find as Aladdin's lamp. Plants with potential ACP countries, however, have their own treasures: attractive, nutritious fruit, for example, or plants which may contain compounds of interest to the pharmaceutical industry Agronomic conditions in ACP countries may also be suitable for growing indigenous or exotic crops, oilseeds in particular, that are of value to the plastics and related chemical industries. In Eritrea, for example, vernonia (Vernonia galamensis) is now being commercially cultivated. The plant occurs naturally in West and East Africa, and the seed from its thistle-like flower heads contains 40 % oil. Seed yields of 1. 5 t/ha can be obtained. Vernonia oil can be used as a plasticizer-stabilizer for polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and it can also be combined with polystyrene to form unique plastics. Not surprisingly, it commands a high price. The nuts of the shea tree (Vitellaria paradoxa syn. <b>Butyrospermum</b> paradoxum), which grows naturally from eastern Senegal to north-west Uganda, have long been an important domestic and export crop. But, because the trees are wild, the yield and quality of the nuts are highly variable, limiting their industrial value, and yet shea butter is now more widely permitted for use in Europe as a substitute for cocoa butter in chocolate and could, therefore, find a larger market. Furthermore, it has unique medical properties that could make it commercially attractive to the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. Research to select trees for faster growth, earlier fruiting and consistent high quality and yields could stimulate commercial exploitation. Another tree that is proving a commercial success is masuku (Uapaca kirkiana). The fruit is eaten fresh or processed into juices, squashes, jams and jellies; in city supermarkets in Malawi and Zambia, commercially produced wine made from masuku is on sale and the fruit is also used to make beer and gin. The tree, which is indigenous to tropical Africa, grows in symbiotic relationship with edible mushrooms for which there is also an export market. Like the shea tree there is considerable potential for domesticating what is still a wild species. 'New' fruits have been successfully introduced into ACP countries with significant tourist industries - Seychelles, Mauritius and Pacific and Caribbean countries, for example. Following market testing with visiting consumers, many of these fruits have now found an export market, following the holidaymakers back home. New processing equals new products New processing techniques could revitalize and add considerable value to traditional subsistence crops. Increasing numbers of city dwellers and women at work require foods that are quick and easy to prepare, and there is a growing market for convenience foods which at present is being largely filled by wheat and maize products. If sorghum and millets could be popped, puffed or flaked, rural and urban populations would derive considerable benefit. Popping is a relatively simple technique and requires less investment than puffing or flaking, but all these processes could be used to swell the small grains of pearl and finger millet, sorghum, fonio etc. and improve their taste while making a ready-to-eat, convenience food product with a high added value. The commercial development of new crops and new products requires investment, but industry is reluctant to invest in an untried market, particularly if new processing technology has to be developed. Even on farm, or at farmers' cooperative level, small-scale machinery must be able to provide a return on investment. This will usually require it to be multi-purpose and to be of use for longer than just one harvesting season. If new crops are introduced it should be because they fit in with the existing farming system, or because they will grow on marginal land; and as far as possible, their introduction should minimize rather than increase risk. This lower-risk potential will often pave the way for eventual commercialization. It was the wicked uncle of Aladdin, in the Tales of the Arabian Nights, who offered 'new lamps for old'.
