5|$|Edward (Ted) Ford {{was born}} in Bethanga, Victoria, on 15 April 1902, the son of Edward John Knight Ford and his wife Mary Doxford, née Armstrong. His first job after leaving Clunes Higher Elementary School was as a {{telegraph}} <b>boy</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Postmaster-General's Department (PMG), which he joined in April 1917, later working in its accounts branch. After he matriculated {{at the age of}} 24 he enrolled in an arts course at the University of Melbourne, but soon switched to medicine. He supported himself by continuing to work for the PMG by night. He graduated with his Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) degrees in 1932, and did his residency at Melbourne Hospital.|$|E

5|$|Family {{holidays}} usually {{were spent}} with the Waugh aunts, at Midsomer Norton, {{in a house}} lit with oil lamps, a time that Waugh recalled with delight, many years later. At Midsomer Norton, Evelyn became deeply interested in high Anglican church rituals, the initial stirrings of the spiritual dimension that later dominated his perspective of life, and he served as an altar <b>boy</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> local Anglican church. During his last year at Heath Mount, Waugh established and edited The Cynic school magazine.|$|E
5|$|In 1888, {{at the age}} of 14, Stanley {{left school}} and went to work as an office <b>boy</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Detroit Street Railways Company, which ran a horse-drawn tram system. He {{continued}} to study at evening school and worked long hours, often from 7.30am to 10.00pm. His abilities were recognised early and Stanley was given responsibility for scheduling the services and preparing the timetables when he was 17. Following the expansion and electrification of the tramway, he became General Superintendent of the company in 1894.|$|E
5|$|Paul Bernard Wurtsmith {{was born}} in Detroit, Michigan, on 9 August 1906, the eldest of three sons of Fred Bernard Wurtsmith, a {{railroad}} engineer on the Pere Marquette Railroad, and his wife Ella.

In his spare time he worked on a Ford Model-T hot rod. He attended the University of Detroit, where he {{earned a degree in}} aeronautical engineering.|$|E

5|$|Shiina, {{given name}} unknown, {{otherwise}} {{referred to by}} his nickname , is another adult friend of Shuichi and Yoshino. He was Yuki's classmate in elementary school, and he eventually became her boyfriend after her transition. Unlike Yuki, Shiina had many friends in school. He generally just watches over Shuichi and Yoshino with Yuki, but he sometimes does bold and unexpected things, such as grabbing Yoshino's crotch when he first meets Yoshino because he feared that, because Yoshino was dressed as a <b>boy</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, Yuki might be having an illicit affair with Yoshino.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Ted was {{frequently}} uprooted as {{his family moved}} among Bronxville, New York, Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, Palm Beach, Florida, and the Court of St. James's in London, England. His formal education started at Gibbs School, in Sloane Street, Kensington, London. He attended ten different schools {{by the age of}} eleven, with his education suffering as a result. Ted was an altar <b>boy</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> St. Joseph's Church and received his First Communion from Pope Pius XII in the Vatican at age seven. Ted spent sixth and seventh grades in the Fessenden School, where he was a mediocre student, and eighth grade at Cranwell Preparatory School; both schools were in Massachusetts. His parents were affectionate toward him as the youngest child, but also compared him unfavorably with his older brothers.|$|E
5|$|Born in Leuven, Belgium, Mertens {{started his}} career as a <b>boy</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> now-dissolved local club Stade Leuven. It was here that the scouts of Anderlecht first spotted Mertens, {{ultimately}} resulting in him being offered a chance to join the club's youth academy in 1998. He spent five years in the youth setup at Anderlecht before being released in 2003, with coaches finding him to be too be too short and physically incapable of competing at a professional level. Following his release from Anderlecht, Mertens was signed by fellow Belgian Pro League side, Gent. Following two seasons in Gent's youth academy, Mertens was loaned to Eendracht Aalst for the 2005–06 season. He excelled with the third division side and was named Player of the Year. The coaching staff at Gent, much like those at Anderlecht before, remained unconvinced of Mertens given his slight frame, however, and loaned him out again the following season, this time to AGOVV Apeldoorn in the Netherlands.|$|E

5|$|Fauré {{was born}} into a cultured but not {{especially}} musical family. His talent became clear when he was a small <b>boy.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> age of nine, he was sent to a music college in Paris, where he was trained to be a church organist and choirmaster. Among his teachers was Camille Saint-Saëns, who became a lifelong friend. After graduating from the college in 1865, Fauré earned a modest living as an organist and teacher, leaving him little time for composition. When he became successful in his middle age, holding the important posts of organist of the Église de la Madeleine and director of the Paris Conservatoire, he still lacked time for composing; he retreated to the countryside in the summer holidays to concentrate on composition. By his last years, Fauré was recognised in France as the leading French composer of his day. An unprecedented national musical tribute was held for him in Paris in 1922, headed {{by the president of the}} French Republic. Outside France, Fauré's music took decades to become widely accepted, except in Britain, where he had many admirers during his lifetime.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1934, Matthews married Betty Vallance, {{daughter}} of Stoke City trainer Jimmy Vallance, whom he first met on his 15th birthday in 1930 {{on his first day}} as office <b>boy</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Victoria Ground. The couple had two children together: Jean (born 1 January 1939) and Stanley Jr. (born 20 November 1945), who {{went on to become a}} tennis player under the tutelage of John Barrett. He became Wimbledon Boys' Champion in 1962, making him the last English player to do so. He never translated his success into the senior game, though, and instead moved to the United States to run the Four Seasons Racquet Club in Wilton, Connecticut. Jean married Robert Gough, whom she had met at their tennis club. In 1965, Matthews became a grandfather after Jean gave birth to a son, Matthew Gough. She would have two other children — daughters Samantha and Amanda. Gough made Matthews a great-grandfather in 1999 when he and his wife had a son, Cameron. Matthews had six other great-grandchildren.|$|E
5|$|When John Spencer died in 1522, {{he passed}} the estate to his {{youngest}} son, Sir William Spencer, High Sheriff of Northamptonshire, who held it {{until his death in}} 1532. Only a <b>boy</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time of William's death, his son John Spencer inherited Althorp and held it until his death in 1586, when he passed it to his son, also John, who died in 1600. John's son, Robert, was created the 1st Baron Spencer of Wormleighton on 21 July 1603. King Charles I is documented to have visited Althorp during his reign. The drawing room was built and the main hall enlarged for the occasion, with £1,300 spent on the banquet, an exorbitant sum for the period. Upon Robert Spencer's death in 1627 Althorp devolved to William Spencer, 2nd Baron Spencer of Wormleighton who held it until his death in 1636. William's eldest son, Henry Spencer, 1st Earl of Sunderland, known as The Lord Spencer between 1636 and June 1643, fought in the Battle of Edgehill in 1642 and was rewarded for his services on 8 June 1643 when the title of Earl of Sunderland was bestowed upon him, although the title cost him £3,000. He then fought in the Siege of Gloucester in August 1643 and the First Battle of Newbury on 20 September 1643, where he was killed, aged 23, by a cannonball.|$|E
