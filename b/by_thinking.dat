5|$|The Rolling Stones {{were the}} first major {{recording}} artists to broadcast a concert over the Internet; a 20-minute video was broadcast on 18 November 1994 using the Mbone at 10 frames per second. The broadcast, engineered <b>by</b> <b>Thinking</b> Pictures and financed by Sun Microsystems, {{was one of the}} first demonstrations of streaming video; while it was not a true webcast, it introduced many to the technology.|$|E
5|$|Susan Hall {{wrote that}} there is no rule of law in the books, as the actions of Ministry of Magic {{officials}} are unconstrained by laws, accountability or any kind of legal challenge. This provides an opportunity for Voldemort to offer his own horrific version of order. As a side-effect Harry and Hermione, who were brought up in the highly regulated Muggle world, find solutions <b>by</b> <b>thinking</b> in ways unfamiliar to wizards. For example, Hermione notes that one obstacle to finding the Philosopher's Stone is a test of logic rather than magical power, and that most wizards have no chance of solving it.|$|E

5|$|Photographer Dick Matthews, {{a friend}} from the Jacaranda, heard about Harry's {{problems}} with Leach and introduced Harry to a local civil servant, Jim Anderson, who lent Harry £50. This enabled Harry to found Mersey Beat in 1961. Harry decided to publish the newspaper every two weeks, covering the music scene in Liverpool, Wirral, Birkenhead, New Brighton, Crosby and Southport, as well as Warrington, Widnes and Runcorn. He thought up the name Mersey Beat <b>by</b> <b>thinking</b> about a policeman's 'beat' (the area of duty), which {{had nothing to do}} with a musical beat. Virginia gave up her accountancy/comptometer operator job at Woolworth's and worked full-time for £2.10/- a week (also contributing a Mersey Roundabout article), while Harry lived on his Senior City Art Scholarship funding. Matthews photographed groups, while Anderson found a small attic office for £5 a week above David Land's wine merchant's shop at 81a Renshaw Street, Liverpool. Anderson and Matthews helped with the move to the new office, with Anderson providing a desk, chair and an Olivetti typewriter.|$|E
5|$|Single-purpose {{characters}} {{needed a}} distinctive personality trait to quickly establish {{them with the}} player, rather than serving as a disposable item, while major characters had to reflect the player's progression and actions through the game. Mitsoda wrote the characters <b>by</b> <b>thinking</b> about who each character was, assigning them motivations determining why they were where they were, what they thought about the player and what they wanted from them. In accordance with a suggestion by fellow writer Chad Moore, the Malkavian player character has a dialog script distinct {{from that of the}} other eight clans; Mitsoda said {{it was one of the}} simpler aspects of the development cycle. He wrote the Malkavian script last, with time running out on development, and the overwork and lack of sleep contributed to what Mitsoda considered an unhealthy state of mind, ideal for writing insane dialog. He wanted to highlight their madness, without making it comical. Since the story is set during the Camarilla's takeover of Los Angeles, the team simplified the plot by only allowing the player to belong to one of the LA-based clans.|$|E
5|$|Men with SCI {{rank the}} ability to father {{children}} among their highest concerns relating to sexuality. Male fertility is reduced after SCI, due {{to a combination of}} problems with erections, ejaculation, and quality of the semen. As with other types of sexual response, ejaculation can be psychogenic or reflexogenic, and the level of injury affects a man's ability to experience each type. As many as 95% of men with SCI have problems with ejaculation (anejaculation), possibly due to impaired coordination of input from different parts of the nervous system. Erection, orgasm, and ejaculation can each occur independently, although {{the ability to}} ejaculate seems linked {{to the quality of the}} erection, and the ability to orgasm is linked to the ejaculation facility. Even men with complete injuries may be able to ejaculate, because other nerves involved in ejaculation can effect the response without input from the spinal cord. In general, the higher the level of injury, the more physical stimulation the man needs to ejaculate. Conversely, premature or spontaneous ejaculation can be a problem for men with injuries at levels T12–L1. It can be severe enough that ejaculation is provoked <b>by</b> <b>thinking</b> a sexual thought, or for no reason at all, and is not accompanied by orgasm.|$|E

25|$|In the night, or in a ship without windows, it {{is helpful}} to simply close one's eyes, or if possible, take a nap. This {{resolves}} the input conflict between the eyes and the inner ear.

25|$|Tetraplegic Matt Nagle {{became the}} first person to control an {{artificial}} hand using a BCI in 2005 as part of the first nine-month human trial of Cyberkinetics’s BrainGate chip-implant. Implanted in Nagle’s right precentral gyrus (area of the motor cortex for arm movement), the 96-electrode BrainGate implant allowed Nagle to control a robotic arm <b>by</b> <b>thinking</b> about moving his hand as well as a computer cursor, lights and TV.

40|$|In {{terms of}} {{prediction}} by Epstein’s integrative theory of personality, Cognitive-Experiential Self-Theory (CEST), those people with experiential-intuitive cognitive style {{are more inclined}} to induce errors than the other people with analytical-rational cognitive style in the conjunction fallacy (two events that can occur together are seen as more likely than {{at least one of the}} two events). We tested this prediction in a revised Linda problem. The results revealed that rational and experiential cognitive styles do not statistically influence the propensity for committing the conjunction fallacy, which is contrary to the CEST’s predictions. Based on the assumption that the rational vs. experiential processing is a personality trait with comparatively stabile specialities, these findings preliminarily indicate that those people who are characterized <b>by</b> rational <b>thinking</b> are not more inclined to use Bayes’ deduction than the other people who are labeled <b>by</b> intuitive <b>thinking</b> or <b>by</b> poor <b>thinking...</b>|$|R

25|$|In {{many people}} with hyperacusis, an {{increased}} activity develops in the tensor tympani muscle in the middle ear {{as part of the}} startle response to some sounds. This lowered reflex threshold for tensor tympani contraction is activated by the perception/anticipation of loud sound, and is called tonic tensor tympani syndrome (TTTS). In some people with hyperacusis, the tensor tympani muscle can contract just <b>by</b> <b>thinking</b> about a loud sound. Following exposure to intolerable sounds, this contraction of the tensor tympani muscle tightens the ear drum, which can lead to the symptoms of ear pain/a fluttering sensation/a sensation of fullness in the ear (in the absence of any middle or inner ear pathology).|$|E
25|$|Zoroaster {{emphasized}} {{the freedom of}} the individual to choose right or wrong and individual responsibility for one's deeds. This personal choice to accept aša, or arta (the divine order), and shun druj (ignorance and chaos) is one's own decision and not a dictate of Ahura Mazda. For Zarathustra, <b>by</b> <b>thinking</b> good thoughts, saying good words, and doing good deeds (e.g. assisting the needy or doing good works) we increase this divine force aša or arta in the world and in ourselves, celebrate the divine order, and we come a step closer on the everlasting road to being one with the Creator. Thus, we are not the slaves or servants of Ahura Mazda, but we can make a personal choice to be his co-workers, thereby refreshing the world and ourselves.|$|E
25|$|How {{can this}} be {{rational}} for both investors? The {{answer lies in the}} fact that the investors do not have to invest the full 100,000 US dollars. Max Return is content to invest only 10,000 US dollars for now. After all, Max Return may rationalize the outcome <b>by</b> <b>thinking</b> that maybe tomorrow there will be new opportunities available to invest the remaining 90,000 US dollars the bank is willing to lend Max Return, at even higher IRRs. Even if only seven more projects come along which are identical to Small-Is-Beautiful, Max Return would be able to match the NPV of Big-Is-Best, on a total investment of only 80,000 US dollars, with 20,000 US dollars left in the budget to spare for truly unmissable opportunities. Max Value is also happy, because she has filled her capital budget straight away, and decides she can take the rest of the year off investing.|$|E
