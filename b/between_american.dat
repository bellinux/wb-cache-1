5|$|Advance {{elements}} of the 24th Infantry Division were badly defeated in the Battle of Osan on July 5, during the first battle <b>between</b> <b>American</b> and North Korean forces. The force at the battle, Task Force Smith, retreated from Osan, and U.S. forces were again defeated in the Battle of Pyongtaek. For over {{a week after the}} defeat of Task Force Smith, 24th Infantry Division soldiers were repeatedly defeated and forced south by the North Korean force's superior numbers and equipment. The regiments of the 24th Infantry Division were systematically pushed south at and around Chochiwon, Chonan, Pyongtaek, Hadong, and Yechon. These American soldiers, most of whom had experienced only occupation duty in Japan and no actual combat, were unprepared compared to the more disciplined North Korean units.|$|E

5|$|Advance {{elements}} of the 24th Infantry were badly defeated in the Battle of Osan on 5 July, the first encounter <b>between</b> <b>American</b> and North Korean forces. For the first month after the defeat of Task Force Smith, 24th Infantry was repeatedly defeated and forced south by superior North Korean numbers and equipment. The regiments of the 24th Infantry were systematically pushed south in engagements around Chochiwon, Chonan, and Pyongtaek. The 24th made a final stand in the Battle of Taejon, where it was almost completely destroyed but delayed North Korean forces until July 20. By that time, the 8th Army′s force of combat troops were roughly equal to North Korean forces attacking the region, with new UN units arriving every day.|$|E

Advance units of the 24th Infantry Division were badly defeated in the Battle of Osan on July 5 in the first encounter <b>between</b> <b>American</b> and North Korean troops. For the first month after the defeat at Osan, the 24th Infantry were repeatedly pushed back and forced southeastward by larger numbers of North Korean troops equipped with rugged Soviet-made T-34 tanks.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{atypical}} scheduling of the show's first 7 episodes, American Dad! has {{a controversial}} season number discrepancy {{in which many}} are divided as to how many seasons the program has had.

From Detroit, the British recruited and supplied Indian war parties to attack American forts and settlements, hoping to divert American military resources from the primary theater {{of war in the}} East as well as keeping the Indians—and the lucrative fur trade—firmly attached to the British Empire. Indians of the Ohio Country, primarily the Shawnee, Mingo, Delaware, and Wyandot, hoped to drive American settlers out of Kentucky and reclaim their hunting grounds, which they had lost in the Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1768) and Lord Dunmore's War (1774).|$|E

Later, it was translated into almost every major language, including Chinese (with translator Lin Shu creating the first Chinese translation of an American novel in 1901) and Amharic (with the 1930 translation created in support of Ethiopian efforts to end the suffering of blacks in that nation). The book was so widely read that Sigmund Freud reported a number of patients with sado-masochistic tendencies who he believed had been influenced by reading about the whipping of slaves in Uncle Tom's Cabin.|$|E
5|$|Both Irene and Prinzess Wilhelm saw {{extensive}} {{service with}} the German fleet. Irene frequently escorted Kaiser Wilhelm II's yacht on cruises throughout Europe.

Irene was in dock for engine maintenance at the time, and so she was not present during the operation. As a result of the seizure, the Cruiser Division was reorganized as the East Asia Squadron. Both ships were present in the Philippines {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the Battle of Manila Bay <b>between</b> <b>American</b> and Spanish squadrons during the Spanish–American War in 1898.
