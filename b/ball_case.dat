"The {{analytical}} problems {{arose in}} a particularly acute form in the smoke <b>ball</b> <b>case.</b> Thus it seemed very peculiar {{to say that there}} had been any sort of agreement between Mrs Carlill and the company, which did not even know of her existence until January 20, when her husband wrote to them to complain. There were indeed earlier cases permitting the recovery of advertised rewards; the leading case here was Williams v Carwardine, where a reward of £20 had been promised by a handbill for information leading to the conviction of the murderer of Walter Carwardine, and Williams, who gave such information, successfully sued to recover the reward. But this was long before the more modern doctrines had become so firmly embodied in legal thinking, and in any event the case was quite distinguishable. It concerned a reward, whereas Mrs Carlill was seeking compensation. There could be at most only a few claimants for this, but there is no limit on the number of those who may catch influenza. Furthermore, the Carbolic Smoke Ball Company had had no chance to check the validity of claims, of which there could be an indefinite number; much was made of this point in the argument. But the judges were not impressed with these difficulties, and their attitude was no doubt influenced by the view that the defendants were rogues. They fit their decision into the structure of the law by boldly declaring that the performance of the conditions was the acceptance, thus fictitiously extending the concept of acceptance to cover the facts. And, since 1893, law students have been introduced to the mysteries of the unilateral contract through the vehicle of Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co. and taught to repeat, as a sort of magical incantation of contract law, {{that in the case of}} unilateral contracts performance of the act specified in the offer constitutes acceptance, and need not be communicated to the offeror." ...|$|E

30|$|These {{case studies}} {{illustrate}} a temporal range of impacts, namely the 17 th, 19 th and 20 th centuries, which represent the ongoing development of ballistic weaponry. In particular, {{the contrast between}} the rounded musket <b>balls</b> (<b>Case</b> Studies 1 and 2) and the more modern weaponry of the 20 th century highlights the increasing intensity of the ballistic impacts. In addition to this, modern warfare is characterised by a more extensive mixture of coexisting weaponry. Where previously some damage or even compaction of the surface is associated with musket <b>ball</b> impacts, <b>Case</b> Study 4 has revealed the resonating impact further into the stone, creating far more complicated fracture networks and energy dissipation than might be visible on the surface. This increasingly penetrating nature of ballistic missiles, both in terms of the bullets themselves and the weaponry used to shoot them, is a cause for grave concern for the future conservation of damaged heritage in conflict areas; if ballistics continue to increase in strength both in terms of energy and energy density at point of impact as well as increasingly efficient penetration of a material, it will be increasingly difficult to stabilise heritage post-conflict.|$|R

A popular {{three-dimensional}} mesh generation {{scheme is}} {{to start with a}} quadrilateral mesh of the surface of a volume, and then attempt to fill the interior of the volume with hexahedra, so that the hexahedra touch the surface in exactly the given quadrilaterals[24].

Computed tomography (CT) of the sinuses showed a heterogeneous opacification of the right maxillary sinus with well-defined hyperdense foci suggesting aspergillosis. She underwent a middle meatus antrectomy by an endonasal approach. Six months after the surgery, her symptoms were gone and had not recurred. Mycological examination found Acremonium.

In our proof, we use the blow-up method. Compared with [1], there are some different key points. First, we derive the different Euler–Lagrange equation on which the analysis is performed. Then we prove that h must be positive at the blow-up point. Hence we use the different scaling when define the maximizing sequences of functions. We also obtain the different upper bound of the subcritical functionals. Finally, when proving the existence of the extremal function, we obtain the different lower bounds for the integrals of test functions constructed in Sects.  2 – 5. It should be remarked that our analysis on the weight h is essentially different from that of Yang and Zhu [2], where a weak version of Trudinger–Moser inequality was studied.|$|E
40|$|Many {{applications}} are inherently rotational in nature. These applications range from industrial products to consumer products. As {{seen in a}} traditional frequency response plot, the motion of a rotating imbalance does not approach zero as the forcing frequency is increased. Unlike a traditional forced mass spring oscillator, {{the motion of the}} rotating imbalance approaches some non-zero value. To account for this residual motion, some systems utilize a balancing device to reduce this motion. These balancing devices can be passive or active, depending on the design considerations. This paper will focus on the traditional, passive ball-type balancer due to its simplicity and extensive use in application. This paper derives the equations of motion for a vertically oriented ball-type balancing system. Due to the high non-linearity of these equations, a fourth order Runge-Kutta numerical integration method is used. The ball balancer equations of motion contain the proper physics needed for full operation such that the ball balancer can translate horizontally, vertically and rotate angularly in the presence of gravity. Acceleration terms are included such that a wide range of operating conditions can be tested. Additionally, n number of balls are present, which are affected by rolling friction and viscous fluid drag. Unlike many numerical models published in the past, the ball-to-ball interactions are not neglected within this model. These interactions include collisions, and train formations and separations. An application of the method presented by (Henon 1982) is utilized where the equations of motion are altered such that an exact integration step can be solved. This is based on the need for a displacement step (collision) or a force step (separation). Although the model presented can accommodate n number of balls, only a maximum ball count of two is considered. It is shown how the behavior of the balls affect the motion response of the ball balancer at rotational velocities above the translational resonance of the system. It is seen that a critical transition is reached; the operating point at which the ball balancer becomes effective at offsetting an eccentric mass. It is also seen that ball balancer displacement decreases until a point of saturation, after which ball balancer displacement increases. Also for the two <b>ball</b> <b>case,</b> it is shown that the spatial characteristics of the balls do affect steady state motion. The angle that separates two contacting balls alters the center of gravity of the train of balls such that the balancing capacity of the system is reduced. Although this effect is shown to be small for a two <b>ball</b> <b>case,</b> the balancing capacity is further reduced as the angle between two contacting balls becomes larger...|$|E
