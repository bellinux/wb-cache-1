At {{the bottom of my heart}} I am bitterly resentful to-day. This is a world of fools and brutes in which we live, a world of idiotic traditions, imbecile limitations, cowardice, habit, greed and mean cruelty. It is a slum of a world, a congested district, an insanitary jumble of souls and bodies. Every good thing, every sweet desire is thwarted--every one. I have to lead the life of a slum missionary, a sanitary inspector, an underpaid teacher. I am bored. Oh God! how I am bored! I am bored by our laws and customs. I am bored by our rotten empire and its empty monarchy. I am bored by its parades and its flags and its sham enthusiasms. I am bored by London and its life, by its smart life and by its servile life alike. I am bored by theatres and by books and by every sort of thing that people call pleasure. I am bored by the brag of people and the claims of people and the feelings of people. Damn people! I am bored by profiteers and by the snatching they call business enterprise. Damn every business man! I am bored by politics and the universal mismanagement of everything. I am bored by France, by Anglo-Saxondom, by German self-pity, by Bolshevik fanaticism. I am bored by these fools' squabbles that devastate the world. I am bored by Ireland, Orange and Green. Curse the Irish--north and south together! Lord! how I HATE the Irish from Carson to the last Sinn Feiner! And I am bored by India and by Egypt. I am bored by Poland and by Islam. I am bored by anyone who professes to have rights. Damn their rights! Curse their rights! I am bored to death by this year and <b>by</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> and by the prospect of next year. I am bored--I am horribly bored--by my work.

50|$|Blue Shield of California was {{stripped}} of its tax-exempt status by the California Franchise Tax Board in 2014. The Los Angeles Times has reported on an audit of the huge nonprofit California health insurer {{that was used in}} part as the basis for denying tax-exempt status. Blue Shield is contesting the decision; having to pay state taxes back to 2009 could cost the company more than $100 million. In a June 2014 letter to the company, tax board officials wrote that “Blue Shield is not operating exclusively for the promotion of civic betterment or social welfare,” according to the Times. And part of the reason was Blue Shield’s massive cash reserves, which had swollen to more than $4 billion <b>by</b> <b>last</b> <b>year.</b> Consumer advocates have criticized the company, saying it should use those amassed profits to provide more free or reduced-cost health care to needy Californians. The company says it already caps profits and provides abundant charity to Californians, and that some of the accumulated cash is earmarked for a major acquisition to expand its business into the Medicaid area.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Under an {{increasing}} social demand {{for improving the}} so-called eutrophication problems in stagnant surface waters, {{the development of the}} zeolite for detergent-use was initiated according to the request of the detergent manufacturer. In a cooperative study with the zeolite supplier, the specifications of zeolite suitable to Japanese washing conditions were determined, and {{it was found that the}} acid clay method via activated silicic acid gel is suitable for the manufacturing process because of the economical viability and the quality of zeolite 4 A obtained, which has small uniform-sized particles and high ion-exchange ability. By adding some improvements, specially prepared zeolite slurry was developed, which fulfills the require-ments for the phosphate substitute builder. The related technology required for manufacturing of non-phosphated deter-gent was also developed, particularly on formulation, spray-dry processing and improvement of the final product's physical properties. Thus non-phosphated powder detergents of high-zeolite formulation were successfully introduced since 1980, and owing to their excellent performance properties, the switchover from phosphated detergents to them has almost been corn-pleted <b>by</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> in Japan...|$|E
40|$|We are in {{the midst}} of a period of {{unprecedented}} debate within policy circles regarding addiction. David Lynch investigates new statistics and talks to academics and doctors. Just over 4, 450 adult substance misusers commenced treatment in 2013, according to HSE figures released to this newspaper under a Freedom of Information request. On a quarterly basis, the number of people commencing treatment following assessment increased during the year, with 1, 228 in December. Alcohol service was most in demand with 2, 115 users, followed by heroin, ‘other illicit drugs’ and finally over-the-counter drugs. In terms of opioid substitution (most of which is methadone), there has been a steady increase in those who are in treatment. According to the National Drug Treatment Centre Central Treatment List, the number of patients was 9, 251 in 2011, in 2012 it was 9, 419, and <b>by</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> it had reached 9, 652. The HSE’s National Social Inclusion Office supplied information to the Medical Independent (MI) on the age profile of those in treatment as of the end of March this year. Of the 9, 698 in treatment, most were in their 30 s. Just over 2, 800 were between the ages of 35 and 39 and some 2, 128 were between 30 and 34 years old. These figures give an insight into the growing and varied problem of addiction in Ireland. They also appear against the backdrop of unprecedented debate and experimentation within the addiction and drug policy arena, both at home and abroad [...] ...|$|E

The result of the simulation studies indicate that there is the decrease {{in the production of}} poultry meat sector (traditional and medium-large) and egg sectors impact on the micro and macro aspects of the economy. This research is the second step of my research deal with Avian flu and the economy. The first step was the {{negative impact}} of avian flu on economy which was already published on Asian Social Economic Journal <b>by</b> <b>last</b> <b>year.</b> The result of this research are : On the micro level in domestic market there are decresed production and increased prices in the poultry sector, eggs, other farms, restaurants and services. While in the foreign market there are decresed exports as well as imports. Similarly, there is a decline in consumption by the entire group of household due to a decline in the acceptance by all groups of households and firms. Government revenue also declined due to a decrease in taxes from households and firms. At the macro level there are a decline in GDP and a decline in the investment. The last  simulation illustrate  the increase of production and the impact of government policy on the micro aspects and the overall economy.   On the micro level in domestic market there are increased production and falling prices in the sector of poultry, eggs, other farms, restaurants and services. While in foreign market there are  increased exports and  decreased imports in almost all sectors. Similarly, there are an increase in consumption by the entire group of households due to an increse in the acceptance by all groups of households and firms.

40|$|Tobacco presentations in {{commercial}} motion pictures are of serious public health concern because cumulative exposure to this imagery causes {{large numbers of}} adolescents to start smoking. An estimated 52 % of adolescent smoking initiation is attributed to this exposure. To examine trends {{in the number of}} tobacco presentations over time, by Motion Picture Association of America age-classification and North American distributor, we surveyed a large sample of films released to U. S. theaters 1991 - 2008 to trace the proportion of smoking and smokefree films, incidence of tobacco imagery in films with smoking, tobacco impressions (incidents times paid admissions) delivered to theater audiences, and tobacco brand display. Policy advocacy aimed at reducing adolescent exposure to tobacco in youth-rated (G, PG and PG 13) films by modernizing the rating system to rate smoking movies R, with some specific exceptions, has been directed at the major studio distributors and their parent corporations since 2001. Some companies have adopted public stances that reflect growing public concern over the issue of smoking in youth-rated films. We pay particular attention to smoking trends in youth-rated films over recent years. KEY FINDINGS Analysis of 1, 769 films released over the past 18 years established that: • Most youth exposure to on-screen smoking occurs in youth-rated films, particularly PG 13. In 2008, PG 13 films delivered 65 % of tobacco impressions (11. 7 billion of the 18. 1 billion impressions) and G/PG films delivered another 1 % (200 million). • The fraction of all films that are smokefree has been growing since the late 1990 s, yet still remains below 50 % even for youth-rated (G/PG/PG 13) films. • Tobacco incidents per film have fallen by about half since 2005, led by youth-rated films. The total number of tobacco incidents on screen remains above levels seen in the late 1990 s. • The number of films with tobacco brands has, if anything, increased. Marlboro, the brand most frequently chosen by adlescent smokers, was displayed most often — accounting for 75 % of brand display in 2008, for example. BY MEDIA COMPANY • Tobacco incidents have nearly disappeared from Disney’s G and PG films. • In recent years, around 75 % of films released by GE (Universal) have featured tobacco — more than from any other major studio. In 2008, tobacco incidents per PG 13 film (on the rise) were as high as incidents per R-rated film (on the decline). • Tobacco incidents in News Corp. (Fox) films have been relatively few in recent years. In three out of the last five years, 66 % or more of News Corp. ’s youth-rated films have been smokefree, a record rivaled only by Disney. • Sony, one of the largest film producer-distributors, has shown no sustained change in tobacco content since the mid- 1990 s. No more than 40 % of Sony’s PG 13 films were smokefree in any year. • At Warner Bros., the prolific studio owned by Time Warner, tobacco incidents in youth-rated films declined between 2005 and 2007, but the trend reversed in 2008. Over the last three years, the percentage of Time Warner’s youth-rated films that were smokefree dropped below 50 % to 39 %. • Viacom’s Paramount films have ranged between 25 % and 50 % smokefree since the late 1990 s, displaying no real change. • Independent producer-distributors (large and small) account for a growing number of theatrical releases. In 2008, indies included a record number of tobacco incidents in their youth-rated films: twice as many as in 2007 and nearly four times as many as in 2006. <b>By</b> <b>last</b> <b>year,</b> only about one in three youth-rated films released by independents was smokefree. CONCLUSION • This film survey’s evidence of limited progress at some companies, and none at others, suggests that an industry wide solution, including R-rating future smoking, is needed to achieve substantial, permanent reductions in dangerous youth exposure to on-screen smoking...|$|E
