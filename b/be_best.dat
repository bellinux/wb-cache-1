5|$|A {{previous}} {{analysis by}} Carlos and Raul de la Fuente Marcos of commensurabilities among the known ETNOs using Monte Carlo techniques revealed a pattern {{similar to that}} of the Kuiper belt, where accidental commensurabilities occur due to objects in resonances with Neptune. They find that this pattern would <b>be</b> <b>best</b> explained if the ETNOs were in resonance with an additional planetary-sized object beyond Pluto and note that a number of these objects may be in 5:3 and 3:1 resonances if that object had semi-major axis of ≈700 AU.|$|E
5|$|After a whistle-blower {{reported}} that the MSDF's preference had been improperly changed an investigation was launched. On December 16 2016 the Japanese Ministry of Defense (the Defense Agency having been upgraded to a ministry in 2007) stated {{that it had not}} confirmed lobbying efforts but the ministry admonished Tomohisa Takei, the JMSDF chief of staff, for mentioning the MCH-101 by name during the procurement process to his subordinates. This had come after MSDF officials had {{reported that}} the Mitsubishi-built SH helicopters may <b>be</b> <b>best.</b>|$|E
5|$|Also in October 2012, Jamie McIntosh of IJM Canada {{said that}} his {{organization}} supports the NAP-CHT, and that the plan's promises to participate in international child protection would <b>be</b> <b>best</b> fulfilled by apprehending and prosecuting Canadians who engage in child sex tourism and child trafficking in other countries. McIntosh recommended that this work be focused on Cambodia, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, the Philippines, and Thailand because these countries are particularly vulnerable to Canadian traffickers. He also recommended focusing on these countries because Canadians have been caught participating in child sex tourism there; McIntosh made specific reference to the cases of Kenneth Klassen and Donald Bakker.|$|E

5|$|Although early {{assertions of}} a {{distinct}} Mangalorean Catholic identity {{date from the}} migration period, a developed Mangalorean Catholic cultural identity only emerged following the captivity. The culture of Mangalorean Catholics {{is a blend of}} Mangalorean and Goan cultures. After migration, they adopted some aspects of the local Mangalorean culture, but retained many of their Goan customs and traditions, and like their Goan ancestors, modern Mangalorean Catholic culture can <b>be</b> <b>best</b> described as an increasingly Anglicised Indo-Latin culture. The Mangalorean Catholic diaspora is mostly concentrated in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf and the English-speaking world.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{offensive}} success in junior, Giordano went unselected at the NHL Entry Draft.

Andy is initially flattered, but starts to grow uncomfortable when Ron returns for a third shoeshine. This time, Ron makes an involuntary noise that sounds like a sexual moan, seriously embarrassing both men. After a day of avoiding each other, Ron and Andy discuss the noise and decide it would <b>be</b> <b>best</b> to simply pretend it never happened.|$|E

5|$|Long {{began his}} {{involvement}} in politics {{at the local level}} in Hingham in 1870. Temperance was a major issue which dominated his political beliefs. His early politics was somewhat independent: he supported the reformist Republican Benjamin Butler for governor in 1871, but received an unsolicited Democratic nomination later that year for a seat in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. He did not campaign, and lost the election. Nominated by both Democrats and reformist Republicans in 1872, he lost again. He thereafter became more of a Republican stalwart, convinced that reform would <b>be</b> <b>best</b> accomplished from within the party organization.|$|E

5|$|The Tale of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle is a children's {{book written}} and {{illustrated}} by Beatrix Potter. It was published by Frederick Warne & Co. in October 1905. Mrs. Tiggy-winkle is a hedgehog washerwoman who lives in a tiny cottage in the fells of the Lake District. A child named Lucie happens upon the cottage and stays for tea. The two deliver freshly laundered clothing to the animals and birds in the neighbourhood. Potter thought the book would <b>be</b> <b>best</b> enjoyed by girls, and, like most girls' books of the period, it is set indoors with a focus on housework.|$|E

5|$|The day before, the Ottoman {{government}} had proposed to Wangenheim that a fictitious {{purchase of the}} German ships be arranged, so their presence would not compromise Ottoman neutrality. The next day the German Chancellor had cabled Wagenheim, rejecting the idea and demanding that the Ottomans immediately join the war. The Grand Vizier accosted Wagenheim on the premature arrival of the ships and repeated the demand for a fictitious sale. The Ottoman government subsequently declared that it had purchased both ships for 80 million German marks. On 14 August, Wagenheim advised the German government that it would <b>be</b> <b>best</b> {{to go along with}} the sale, lest they risk angering the Ottomans.|$|E
5|$|They {{are kind}} birds but the male Sebright may get {{protective}} around hens and may turn {{on its own}} owners like all roosters may do. And due to their light, flighty nature it might <b>be</b> <b>best</b> to keep them contained to a smaller, fenced off area. Sebrights often will live happily living amongst other breeds as well. Sebrights are not prolific egglayers and hens are only expected to produce 60-80 creamy-white eggs each season.|$|E

The social structure of the orangutan can <b>be</b> <b>best</b> described as solitary but social. Interactions between adult females range from friendly to avoidance to antagonistic. Resident males may have overlapping ranges and interactions between them tend to be hostile.|$|E

5|$|With {{the partial}} {{destruction}} of the North Vietnamese logistical system in Cambodia, the U.S. headquarters in Saigon determined that the time was propitious for a similar campaign in Laos. If such an operation were to be carried out, the U.S. command believed, it would <b>be</b> <b>best</b> to do it quickly, while American military assets were still available in South Vietnam. Such an operation would create supply shortages that would be felt by PAVN/NLF forces 12–18 months later, as the last U.S. troops were leaving South Vietnam and thereby give the U.S. and its ally a respite from a possible communist offensive in the northern provinces for one year, possibly even two.|$|E
5|$|After their {{training}} had been completed, on 17 November the sappers were transported to an RAF airfield at Skitten in Scotland, with the operation scheduled to commence two days later.

The first aircraft–glider combination took off from the airfield at 17:50, with the second following at 18:10; after circling the airfield several times the two combinations headed out across the North Sea towards their objective.|$|E
