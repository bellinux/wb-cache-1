Meanwhile, Andy, Jim, and Pam watch an illegally downloaded movie at work starring Jack Black, Jessica Alba and Cloris Leachman, and Pam deals with her parents' recent argument that's caused her father to move in with her and Jim.|$|E

5|$|As 1997 {{turned to}} 1998, an {{inspirational}} performance from Giggs helped a modest United side labour for a hard-earned three points and still maintain {{their desire for}} a fifth title in six seasons. A trip to the Dell to play Southampton – where United were undone last season repeated itself, this time by a solitary Kevin Davies goal in the third minute. The Saints pulled off a valiant performance, most notably from goalkeeper Paul Jones, who denied Solskjær from scoring right at {{the death of the}} second half. Things went from <b>bad</b> <b>to</b> worse in January as Tony Cottee popped in to stun Old Trafford and score the winner for Leicester in what proved a wretched season for the striker. This was the Foxes first win in the league since November and United's first home defeat of the season and fifth altogether.|$|E
5|$|Alan Ball the {{previous}} chairman became executive deputy chairman, with Smallpeice requesting a non-executive deputy chairman position, which was quickly agreed to. Sandys and Smallpeice {{were joined by}} a third new board member, the Conservative politician Edward du Cann and the new board constituted in March 1972. The board quickly become concerned at the behaviour of their chief executive Tiny Rowland who had agreed in principle to finance a sugar refinery in Sudan {{at a cost of}} £80 to £100 million, whilst the company {{was in the midst of}} refinancing itself. The board was able to reword the agreement and it became a feasibility study, recovering the situation but respite from a further crisis would prove to be short lived. The situation at Lonrho went from <b>bad</b> <b>to</b> worse during early 1973, when Peats, Lonrho's auditors, discovered payments totalling £44,000 made from a subsidiary company based in the Cayman Islands to Duncan Sandys. Sandys, believing that the payment had been authorised by the board returned in full the money he had received.|$|E
5|$|Sebastian Vettel's {{momentum}} continued {{one week}} later in Korea, winning his third consecutive race and taking a six-point championship lead as Fernando Alonso finished third. Vettel overcame pole-sitter Mark Webber at the start, and was aided in building up a lead by first-lap contact between Jenson Button, Nico Rosberg and Kamui Kobayashi that saw Button and Rosberg retire with damage from the collision; Rosberg pulled over on the approach to the third turn, forcing a protracted yellow flag period as marshalls attempted to retrieve his car. With the sporting regulations banning overtaking while yellow flags were shown, the field was effectively thinned out in the opening laps as drivers were unable to pass one another. Tyre management {{became the focus of}} the race, as drivers reported heavy graining, particularly on the right-front tyre, which bore most of the load over a lap of the circuit. Vettel ignored six radio calls from his pit wall cautioning him that a tyre failure was imminent, only backing off just enough in the final few laps to secure victory over Webber by six seconds. The team later denied that there had ever been a problem with Vettel's tyres. Further down the order, Scuderia Toro Rosso's Jean-Éric Vergne and Daniel Ricciardo fought their way from sixteenth and twenty-first on the grid to finish eighth and ninth, while Romain Grosjean drove a conservative race to finish seventh, having been warned beforehand by the stewards that another first-lap altercation would likely result in his disqualification from the race. Lewis Hamilton's day went from <b>bad</b> <b>to</b> worse when an anti-roll bar on his McLaren failed, while the car handled its tyres so poorly that he was forced to make an unscheduled stop {{in order to make it}} to the finish, only to tear up a length of astroturf that wreaked havoc on his downforce and he slid down to tenth place, narrowly fending off an opportunistic charge from Sergio Pérez to take the final World Championship point on offer. Button's retirement and Hamilton's single point meant that McLaren lost second place in the World Constructors' Championship to Ferrari, and Hamilton admitted that his bid to be the 2012 World Drivers' Champion was over.|$|E

However, with the tenth ball of the fourth day Chapple dismissed Kabir Ali to end with five for 32, and Warwickshire were all out for 113.|$|E

25|$|Another {{art form}} has a wider range: the illness {{narrative}} {{has become a}} staple of breast cancer literature and is prominent in women's magazines.

The cure and quest narratives fit neatly with the breast cancer culture. Chaos narratives, which are rarer in stories about breast cancer, oppose it.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{before the}} start of the war with France, Monke sailed Speedwell to Hamburg to {{retrieve}} some British sailors rescued from various vessels that had wrecked on the coast of Jutland. He brought back about 100. Monke was forced to stay on deck day and night, although on the way back to Britain the weather was <b>bad,</b> <b>to</b> forestall any uprising by the rescued sailors. The fear was that the sailors, who were not anxious to be pressed into the Royal Navy, would try to seize Speedwell and run her ashore.|$|E
25|$|Despite these {{positive}} developments, {{the situation}} of Alexandra and her mother didn't improve. Indeed, Greece experiencing a series of military defeats against Turkey and a coup d'état soon forced King Constantine I to abdicate again, this time in favor of Diadochos George, on 27 September 1922. Things went from <b>bad</b> <b>to</b> worse for the country; a further coup forced the new ruler, {{his wife and his}} brother to leave the country on 19 December 1923. On 25 March 1924, the Second Hellenic Republic was proclaimed and both Aspasia and Alexandra were then the only members of the dynasty allowed to stay in Greece.|$|E
5000|$|In the Guardian, Gareth McLean {{noted that}} [...] "Richard Littlejohn lecturing on {{the evils of}} bigotry is akin to Hannibal Lecter advocating vegetarianism."

50|$|The {{conclusion}} is that actually nothing <b>bad</b> happens <b>to</b> good men.

25|$|Any hopes England had {{of winning}} the test and {{squaring}} the series were eliminated on day 3. Jayawardene went on to score 213 not out, Vaas had scored 90 before being dismissed, and Sri Lanka declared on 499/8. But things then turned from <b>bad</b> <b>to</b> catastrophic for England, as they lost 4 wickets during a 20-minute passage of play before lunch. Two wickets then fell quickly after lunch too to leave England on 33/6. Ryan Sidebottom and Paul Collingwood managed a partnership of 37 before the lower order were blown away. England were bowled out for the pitiful total of 81.|$|E

The season went from <b>bad</b> <b>to</b> worse when Gary Ablett went down injured in the clash with Brisbane. In the absence of Ablett, a silvering lining was discovered by the club during their next two losses as Harley Bennell's talent was unearthed.
