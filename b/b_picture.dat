5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the growing {{practice}} of screening nonmainstream motion pictures as late shows, {{with the goal}} of building a cult film audience, brought the midnight movie concept home to the cinema, now in a countercultural setting—something like a drive-in movie for the hip. One of the first films adopted by the new circuit in 1971 was the three-year-old Night of the Living Dead. The midnight movie success of low-budget pictures made entirely outside the studio system, like John Waters' Pink Flamingos (1972), with its campy spin on exploitation, spurred the development of the independent film movement. The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975), an inexpensive film from 20th Century Fox that spoofed all manner of classic <b>B</b> <b>picture</b> clichés, became an unparalleled hit when it was relaunched as a late show feature the year after its initial, unprofitable release. Even as Rocky Horror generated its own subcultural phenomenon, it contributed to the mainstreaming of the theatrical midnight movie.|$|E
5|$|On television, the {{parallels}} between the weekly series that became the mainstay of prime-time programming and the Hollywood series films of an earlier day had long been clear. In the 1970s, original feature-length programming increasingly began to echo the B movie as well. As production of TV movies expanded {{with the introduction of}} the ABC Movie of the Week in 1969, soon followed by the dedication of other network slots to original features, time and financial factors shifted the medium progressively into <b>B</b> <b>picture</b> territory. Television films inspired by recent scandals—such as The Ordeal of Patty Hearst, which premiered a month after her release from prison in 1979—harkened {{all the way back to}} the 1920s and such movies as Human Wreckage and When Love Grows Cold, FBO pictures made swiftly in the wake of celebrity misfortunes. Many 1970s TV films—such as The California Kid (1974), starring Martin Sheen—were action-oriented genre pictures of a type familiar from contemporary cinematic B production. Nightmare in Badham County (1976) headed straight into the realm of road-tripping-girls-in-redneck-bondage exploitation.|$|E
5|$|While the inceptive noir, Stranger on the Third Floor, was a <b>B</b> <b>picture</b> {{directed}} by a virtual unknown, {{many of the}} films noir still remembered were A-list productions by well-known film makers. Debuting as a director with The Maltese Falcon (1941), John Huston followed with Key Largo (1948) and The Asphalt Jungle (1950). Opinion is divided on the noir status of several Alfred Hitchcock thrillers from the era; at least four qualify by consensus: Shadow of a Doubt (1943), Notorious (1946), Strangers on a Train (1951) and The Wrong Man (1956). Otto Preminger's success with Laura (1944) made his name and helped demonstrate noir's adaptability to a high-gloss 20th Century-Fox presentation. Among Hollywood's most celebrated directors of the era, arguably none worked more often in a noir mode than Preminger; his other noirs include Fallen Angel (1945), Whirlpool (1949), Where the Sidewalk Ends (1950) (all for Fox) and Angel Face (1952). A half-decade after Double Indemnity and The Lost Weekend, Billy Wilder made Sunset Boulevard (1950) and Ace in the Hole (1951), noirs that were not so much crime dramas as satires on Hollywood and the news media. In a Lonely Place (1950) was Nicholas Ray's breakthrough; his other noirs include his debut, They Live by Night (1948) and On Dangerous Ground (1952), noted for their unusually sympathetic treatment of characters alienated from the social mainstream.|$|E

500|$|By {{the turn}} of the millennium, the average {{production}} cost of an American feature had already spent three years above the [...] mark. In 2005, the top ten movies at the U.S. box office included three adaptations of children's fantasy novels, one extending and another initiating a series (Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and , respectively), a child-targeted cartoon (Madagascar), a comic book adaptation (Batman Begins), a sci-fi series installment (...) , a sci-fi remake (War of the Worlds), and a King Kong remake. It was a slow year for Corman: he produced just one movie, which had no American theatrical release, true of most of the pictures he had been involved in over the preceding decade. As big-budget Hollywood movies further usurped traditional low-rent genres, the ongoing viability of the familiar brand of B movie was in grave doubt. New York Times critic A. O. Scott warned of the impending [...] "extinction" [...] of [...] "the cheesy, campy, guilty pleasures" [...] of the <b>B</b> <b>picture.</b>|$|E
500|$|Ida Lupino, {{well known}} as an actress, {{established}} herself as Hollywood's sole female director of the era. In short, low-budget pictures made for her production company, The Filmakers, Lupino explored virtually taboo subjects such as rape in 1950's Outrage and 1953's self-explanatory The Bigamist. Her most famous directorial effort, The Hitch-Hiker, a 1953 RKO release, is the only example of film noir's classic period directed by a woman. That year, RKO put out another historically notable film made at low cost: Split Second, which concludes in a nuclear test range, is perhaps the first [...] "atomic noir". The most famous such movie, the independently produced Kiss Me Deadly (1955), typifies the persistently murky middle ground between the A and <b>B</b> <b>picture,</b> as Richard Maltby describes: a [...] "programmer capable of occupying either half of a neighbourhood theatre's double-bill, [...] budgeted at approximately $400,000. [...] distributor, United Artists, released around twenty-five programmers with production budgets between $100,000 and $400,000 in 1955." [...] The film's length, 106 minutes, is A level, but its star, Ralph Meeker, had previously appeared in only one major film. Its source is pure pulp, one of Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer novels, but Robert Aldrich's direction is self-consciously aestheticized. The result is a brutal genre picture that also evokes contemporary anxieties about what was often spoken of simply as the Bomb.|$|E

500|$|Despite all the {{transformations in}} the industry, by 1961 the average {{production}} {{cost of an}} American feature film was still only —after adjusting for inflation, less than 10 percent more {{than it had been}} in 1950. The traditional twin bill of B film preceding and balancing a subsequent-run A film had largely disappeared from American theaters. The AIP-style dual genre package was the new model. In July 1960, the latest Joseph E. Levine sword-and-sandals import, Hercules Unchained, opened at neighborhood theaters in New York. A suspense film, Terror Is a Man, ran as a [...] "co-feature" [...] with a now familiar sort of exploitation gimmick: [...] "The dénouement helpfully includes a 'warning bell' so the sensitive can 'close their eyes.'" [...] That year, Roger Corman took AIP down a new road: [...] "When they asked me to make two ten-day black-and-white horror films to play as a double feature, I convinced them instead to finance one horror film in color." [...] The resulting House of Usher typifies the continuing ambiguities of <b>B</b> <b>picture</b> classification. It was clearly an A film by the standards of both director and studio, with the longest shooting schedule and biggest budget Corman had ever enjoyed. But it is generally seen as a B movie: the schedule was still a mere fifteen days, the budget just $200,000 (one-tenth the industry average), and its 85-minute running time close to an old thumbnail definition of the B: [...] "Any movie that runs less than 80 minutes." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1970, a low-budget crime drama shot in 16mm by first-time American {{director}} Barbara Loden won {{the international}} critics' prize at the Venice Film Festival. Wanda {{is both a}} seminal event in the independent film movement and a classic <b>B</b> <b>picture.</b> The crime-based plot and often seedy settings would have suited a straightforward exploitation film or an old-school B noir. The $115,000 production, for which Loden spent six years raising money, was praised by Vincent Canby for [...] "the absolute accuracy of its effects, the decency of its point of view and... purity of technique." [...] Like Romero and Van Peebles, other filmmakers of the era made pictures that combined the gut-level entertainment of exploitation with biting social commentary. The first three features directed by Larry Cohen, Bone (1972), Black Caesar (1973), and Hell Up in Harlem (1973), were all nominally blaxploitation movies, but Cohen used them as vehicles for a satirical examination of race relations and the wages of dog-eat-dog capitalism. The gory horror film Deathdream (1974), directed by Bob Clark, is also an agonized protest {{of the war in}} Vietnam. Canadian filmmaker David Cronenberg made serious-minded low-budget horror films whose implications are not so much ideological as psychological and existential: Shivers (1975), Rabid (1977), The Brood (1979). An Easy Rider with conceptual rigor, the movie that most clearly presaged the way in which exploitation content and artistic treatment would be combined in modestly budgeted films of later years was United Artists' biker-themed Electra Glide in Blue (1973), directed by James William Guercio. The New York Times reviewer thought little of it: [...] "Under different intentions, it might have made a decent grade-C Roger Corman bike movie—though Corman has generally used more interesting directors than Guercio." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tim Pulleine of The Guardian {{described}} {{the film as}} superficial despite successfully meeting {{the requirements of the}} genre.

2500|$|A few {{down-market}} independent productions {{were more}} ambitious: White Zombie (1932), directed by Victor Halperin and starring Béla Lugosi, is now {{regarded as the}} archetypal zombie movie, though it was poorly received at the time. It {{was picked up by}} United Artists for distribution after it lost deals with Columbia and the small Educational Pictures. On occasion, a low-end movie would get separated from the pack. Reviewing the 77-minute Universal crime melodrama Rio (1939), the New York Times declared that director [...] "John Brahm's impact on the Class <b>B</b> <b>picture</b> is producing one of the strangest sound effects in recent cinema history. It is that of an unmistakable B buzzing like an A." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1970, a low-budget crime drama shot in 16 mm by {{a first-time}} American {{director}} won the international critics' prize at the Venice Film Festival. Wanda, {{written and directed}} by Barbara Loden, is both a seminal event in the independent film movement and a classic <b>B</b> <b>picture.</b> The plot—involving a disaffected divorcée who drifts away from her coal-town life and aimlessly falls in with a small-time, would-be hardboiled crook—and the often seedy settings would have been suitable to a straightforward exploitation film or (with a little shifting of sex roles) an old-school B noir. Loden, who spent six years raising money for the sub-$200,000 production, created a film that Vincent Canby of the New York Times praised for [...] "the absolute accuracy of its effects, the decency of its point of view and the kind of purity of technique that can only be the result of conscious discipline." [...] While Wanda would be the only movie Loden ever made, she [...] "left us with a film that anticipated the independent spirit that would reinvigorate the industry." ...|$|E
2500|$|In early 1967, Disney {{released}} Mosby's Marauders, a now mostly forgotten but successful Civil War drama {{told from}} a southern perspective with Adams {{in the role}} of a cruel Union army sergeant. Adams guest-starred in five episodes of four TV series that year, including an installment of his friend Robert Conrad's The Wild Wild West, an appearance in Combat! and two episodes of Hondo (a short-lived western which also had an ex-Confederate theme). Throughout 1967 and early 1968 he also worked in three low-budget films. One of these was Mission Mars (1968) which has been described as [...] "rarely seen, and utterly dreadful." [...] Adams' costume for this movie included an off-the-shelf motorcycle helmet. Reacting to Mission Mars over 30 years later, SciFi reviewer Gary Westfahl wrote, [...] "The only quality that Adams could persuasively project on film was a desperate desire to be popular, to be liked... which helps to explain why Adams got his foot in many doors." [...] Adams' last U.S. production was a more solid <b>B</b> <b>picture,</b> a movie filmed in Iowa called Fever Heat. His last film appearance was in the little-seen Spanish-language western Los Asesinos, filmed in Mexico City, Mexico.|$|E

2500|$|The film holds a 31% 'Rotten' {{rating on}} Rotten Tomatoes as of February 7, 2015, with 58 {{positive}} of 185 reviews being positive with the critics consensus being [...] "The magic is gone, leaving a dreary, generic action movie". David Edelstein of Slate called the film [...] "profoundly stupid and inept" [...] and added, [...] "it's an endless source of giggles once you realise that its historical revisionism {{has nothing to}} do with archeological discoveries and everything to do with the fact that no one at Disney would green-light an old-fashioned talky love triangle with a hero who dies and an adulterous heroine who ends up in a nunnery." [...] A. O. Scott of the New York Times further remarked that the film was [...] "a blunt, glowering <b>B</b> <b>picture,</b> shot in murky fog and battlefield smoke, full of silly-sounding pomposity and swollen music (courtesy of the prolifically bombastic Hans Zimmer). The combat scenes, though boisterous and brutal, are no more coherent than the story, which requires almost as much exposition as [...] Luckily there is an element of broad, brawny camp that prevents King Arthur from being a complete drag." ...|$|E
2500|$|That same year, RKO put {{out another}} {{historically}} notable film made at low cost {{and with an}} only faintly starry cast: the 85-minute-long Split Second comes to a head in a desert ghost town {{about to become a}} nuclear blast site, making it perhaps the first example of an [...] "atomic noir."

2500|$|It is {{not clear}} that the term B movie (or B film or <b>B</b> <b>picture)</b> was in general use before the 1930s; in terms of studio production, however, a similar concept was already well {{establish}}ed. In 1916, Universal became the first Hollywood studio to establish different feature brands based on production cost: the small Jewel line of [...] "prestige" [...] productions, midrange Bluebird releases, and the low-budget Red Feather line of five-reelers—a measure of film length indicating a running time between fifty minutes and an hour. The following year, the Butterfly line, a grade between Red Feather and Bluebird, was introduced. During those two years, about half of Universal's output was in the Red Feather and Butterfly categories. According to historian Thomas Schatz, [...] "These low-grade westerns, melodramas, and action pictures...underwent a disciplined production and marketing process," [...] in contrast to the Jewels, which were not as strictly governed by studio policies. While the down-market branding was soon eliminated, Universal continued to focus on low and modestly budgeted productions. In 1919, wealthy Paramount Pictures created its own distinct low-budget brand: the company's Realart films were made attractive to exhibitors with lower rental fees than movies from the studio's primary production line. Indicating the breadth of the budgetary range at a single studio, in 1921, when the average cost of a Hollywood feature was around $60,000, Universal spent approximately $34,000 on The Way Back, a five-reeler, and over $1 million on Foolish Wives, a top-of-the-line Super Jewel. The production of inexpensive films like The Way Back allowed the studios to derive maximum value from facilities and contracted staff in between a studio's more important productions, while also breaking in new personnel.|$|E
