50|$|Long-beaked common {{dolphins}} are {{not common}} in human care {{as they are}} extremely difficult to keep in captivity. In the wild, however, they have been seen travelling with <b>bottle-nosed</b> <b>dolphins,</b> pilot whales, and yellowfin tuna.|$|R
50|$|The rich {{offshore}} {{waters of}} Mauritania {{are home to}} a diverse fauna of cetaceans. Upwellings off the coats create rich feeding grounds for baleen whales and these include blue whale, sei whale and Bryde's whale, although the North Atlantic right whale is now extinct in the eastern Atlantic and it was recorded off Mauretania. Other whales and dolphins found off Mauritania's coast include harbour porpoise, Atlantic spotted dolphin, <b>bottle-nosed</b> <b>dolphin,</b> sperm whale, short-finned pilot whale and orca.|$|E
50|$|Malampaya Sound's waters, coral reefs, {{seagrass}} beds, mangrove coastlines {{and surrounding}} lowland forests provide habitat {{for a wide}} variety of wildlife. More than 156 fish species are found in its waters including commercially valuable fish such as mackerel, anchovy, crevalle, sea catfish, snapper, frigate tuna, rabbit fish and grouper. Crabs and stingray are also abundant in the sound and is also visited by dugongs and marine turtles like green sea turtles and hawksbill sea turtles. The sound is also home to three species of dolphins: the Irrawady dolphin found in the Inner Sound, the <b>bottle-nosed</b> <b>dolphin</b> in the Outer Sound, and Risso's dolphin found at Minapla Bay.|$|E

50|$|Bon Secour is {{characterized}} by a coastal, Southern Gothic scenery with huge water oak trees covered in Spanish moss, great blue herons, brown pelicans, ever present <b>bottle-nosed</b> <b>dolphin</b> pods and the potent smell of salty gulf waters everywhere. The local commercial fisherman that make their living from the Gulf are no less salty but also friendly. Other than the relatively small, family owned, seafood processing plants, Bon Secour is primarily made up of many rural neighborhoods, most of which enjoy beautiful vistas of the Bon Secour River and Bon Secour Bay. Brown Pelicans are everywhere and locals often see alligators from time to time, plying the waters of the estuarial system from the head waters of the Bon Secour River to the bay. One can see baby bottle-nosed dolphins playing near the mouth of the river at any time. In Bon Secour one can catch bass, bream, fresh-water catfish, then travel a few miles down river, to the bay and catch all manner of salt water fish, shrimp, and oysters in the same day.|$|E

50|$|Lacazia loboi is a yeast-like fungus {{that causes}} {{infection}} in humans and <b>bottle-nosed</b> <b>dolphins</b> (Tursiops truncatus). Aqueous environments {{appear to be}} mandatory for the lifecycle of L. loboi. It is saprophytic in water and is transmitted to the vulnerable host via contact. Infections due to L. loboi are mostly reported from tropical zones.|$|R
50|$|On {{the lower}} {{parts of the}} river the {{wildlife}} is rich. There is a large variety ranging from crowfoot river plants to Atlantic salmon as well as otters, wetland birds and multi fruited river moss. There have also been sightings of <b>bottle-nosed</b> <b>dolphins</b> where the river opens into the estuary and flows into Cardigan Bay.|$|R
50|$|Wildlife is {{abundant}} in this area, and <b>bottle-nosed</b> <b>dolphins</b> and Atlantic grey seals {{can often be}} seen in the coastal waters. In the dunes there are stonechats, goldfinches, and sand martins. Migratory birds pass this way too, so autumn brings the arrival of redwings, chaffinches, starlings and skylarks. The rare Red-billed chough breeds in small numbers.|$|R
40|$|Two {{bacterial}} pneumonia cases of bottle-nosed dolphins (Tursiops gillii) {{were found in}} Seoul Zoo. Firstly, severe fibrous pleuropneumonia was revealed in a 14 -year-old male <b>bottle-nosed</b> <b>dolphin</b> on its necropsy. The clinical signs included anorexia, listing posture, and vertical submerging after the initial signs of low activity and avoiding trainers. White blood cell count increased up to 31. 80 × 103 /µl. Despite aggressive antibiotics therapy of intramuscular injection and nebulization it died two months later. At early time of illness Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis were isolated. Lately Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from the exhaled air culture and direct sample of lung parenchyma on necropsy. Secondly, a 6 -year-old male <b>bottle-nosed</b> <b>dolphin</b> with anorexia and tendency to avoid trainers was completely recovered after prompt treatment with antibiotics and NSAIDs for six days prior to diagnosis. The diagnosis was based on history, clinical signs, blood cell count, and mucous culture from blowhole. The count of white blood cell dramatically decreased from 25. 36 × 103 /µl to 7. 28 × 103 / µl after four days of antibiotics therapy. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from the culture...|$|E
40|$|Cadenat (1959) and Rancurel (1964) {{produced}} strong {{indirect evidence}} that off {{the west coast}} of Africa, the <b>Bottle-nosed</b> <b>Dolphin,</b> Tursiops truncatus, is in the habit of diving very deeply, possibly down to 600 m. Examination of the skulls of fully adult specimens of Tursiops taken off Dakar and St. Helena revealed marked distension and fenestration of bones associated with the accessory air sinuses of the middle ear. The condition suggests a pathological enhancement of the normal processes of evolution of these bones in order to adjust to excessive middle ear pressure sustained intermittently over a long period...|$|E
40|$|Heavy metal (Hg, Cd, Pb and Zn) and {{selenium}} {{levels were}} determined in striped (Stenella coeruleoalba) and bottle-nosed dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) stranded {{along the coast}} of Tuscany and Latium, Italy in the period 1987 - 1989. Lead and zinc concentrations were quite low and there was modest accumulation of cadmium in the kidney of both species. Mercury levels were very high, especially in the liver where they reached peaks of 4400 ppm (dry weight) in the striped dolphin and 13 150 ppm (dry weight) in the <b>bottle-nosed</b> <b>dolphin.</b> Selenium levels were also high and were significantly correlated with mercury levels in some organs and tissues. The toxicological significance of the selenium-mercury interaction is discussed...|$|E

40|$|Bronchoscopy is a {{standard}} diagnostic and therapeutic procedure in respiratory medicine and has been performed on many animal species. Cetaceans suffer considerable morbidity and mortality from lower respiratory tract infections, {{and it is very}} difficult to sample lower respiratory tract secretions for microbiology and other analyses. We report our experience on performing fiberoptic bronchoscopy in three <b>bottle-nosed</b> <b>dolphins</b> (Tursiops truncatus) and one false killer whale (Pseudorca crassidens), which should help other clinicians in performing bronchoscopy in cetaceans. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
50|$|The Croaghaun cliffs {{are home}} to two {{families}} of peregrine falcons (RTÉ, 2008). September and October are {{the best time to}} see the fastest creatures on Earth here, as they teach their young to fly. Metamorphic, quartz-laden gems may be observed, along with Mediterranean heathers and the waters of the Atlantic. It is common to see shoals of <b>bottle-nosed</b> <b>dolphins</b> and basking sharks, once a source of revenue for Achill Island (BBC, 2009). Porpoises are found in large numbers. Killer whales, humpback whales, and other whales have been sighted.|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} of the cardiac foramen ovale from 17 species representing six cetacean families, the Monodontidae, Phocoenidae, Delphinidae, Ziphiidae, Balaenidae and the Balaenopteridae, was studied using the scanning electron microscope. Eight white whale fetuses (Delphinapterus leucas) and a narwhal fetus (Monodon monoceros) represented the Monodontidae; one fetal and nine neonatal harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) and a finless porpoise fetus (Neophocoena phocoenoides) represented the Phocoenidae; two white-beaked dolphin fetuses (Lagenorhynchus albirostris), four fetal and one neonatal Atlantic white-sided dolphins (Lagenorhynchus acutus), a Risso's dolphin fetus (Grampus griseus), two common <b>bottle-nosed</b> <b>dolphin</b> neonates (Tursiops truncatus), a female short-beaked common dolphin fetus (Delphinus delphis), four killer whale fetuses (Orcinus orca) and two long-finned pilot whale fetuses (Globicephala melas) represented the Delphinidae; two northern bottlenose whale fetuses (Hyperoodon ampullatus) represented the Ziphiidae; one bowhead whale fetus (Balaena mysticetus) represented the Balaenidae and five Common minke whale fetuses (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), one blue whale fetus (Balaenoptera musculus), nine fin whale fetuses (Balaenoptera physalus) and four humpback whale fetuses (Megaptera novaeangliae) represented the Balaenopteridae. The hearts of an additional two incompletely identified toothed and four baleen whale fetuses were also studied. In each species the fold of tissue derived from the cardiac septum primum and subtended by the foramen ovale had {{the appearance of a}} short tunnel or sleeve which was fenestrated at its distal end. In the toothed whales the tissue fold was tunnel-shaped with the interatrial septum as the floor whereas in baleen whales it was more sleeve-like. In toothed whales thin threads extended from the fold to insert into the interatrial septum whereas a network of threads covered the distal end of the sleeve in the baleen whales. Similar structures were present in the corresponding cardiac tissues of neonatal Hippopotamidae...|$|E
50|$|A {{population}} {{of several thousand}} red deer inhabit the moors and hills. Fallow deer {{can be found in}} the southeast, and roe deer are common on low-lying ground. Otters are common around the coasts along Nave Island, and common and grey seals breed on Nave Island. Offshore, a variety of cetaceans are regularly recorded including minke whales, pilot whales, killer whales and <b>bottle-nosed</b> <b>dolphins.</b> The only snake on Islay is the adder and the common lizard is widespread although not commonly seen. The island supports a significant {{population of}} the marsh fritillary along with numerous other moths and butterflies. The mild climate supports a diversity of flora, typical of the Inner Hebrides.|$|R
50|$|Joel Silverman {{grew up in}} Southern California and {{at the age of}} 13, {{the first}} animal he ever trained was the family dog, Shadow. At about the same time, he and his family spent their summer {{vacations}} in San Diego and would go to SeaWorld every year, and after a number of summers watching the trainers riding the killer whales, Silverman developed a fascination with the whales and trainers. At the age of 16, he got hired to pick up trash at SeaWorld, and after helping out the trainers and years of hard work, Silverman was hired as a trainer. He started off with Pacific and Atlantic <b>bottle-nosed</b> <b>dolphins,</b> California sea lions, and eventually killer whales.|$|R
50|$|In 1950, Kellogg left Indiana University for Florida State University. While {{it marked}} the end of his {{research}} on conditioning in dogs, it also marked the beginning of an entirely new focus of research. Kellogg would shift his attention to the study of <b>bottle-nosed</b> <b>dolphins,</b> an area of interest that would fill up the next 13 years. At Florida State, Kellogg was given the opportunity to shape the psychology program. He built an exceptional psychology doctoral program by revamping current the undergraduate and master's programs. Additionally he acquired funds from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to build the psychology research building, aided in recruiting faculty, and pushed the growth of the psychology department. His time at Florida State would be dedicated to the study of bottlenose dolphins, driven by his curiosity about how they were able to navigate.|$|R
