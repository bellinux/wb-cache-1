They were aground. [...] "Push her off to the lee there! Let go your sheets!" [...] roared the boatswain from the wheel. [...] "Push her off to the lee." [...] He spun the wheel around as he spoke. A half a dozen men sprang up, seized the sweeps, and plunged them into the water. Others ran to help them, but the sweeps only sank into the mud without moving the schooner. The sails had fallen off and they were flapping and thumping and clapping in the wind. Others of the crew had scrambled to their feet and ran to help those at the sweeps. The lieutenant had walked quickly aft again. They were very close now to the pirate sloop, and suddenly some one hailed him from aboard of her. When he turned he saw that there was a man standing up on the rail of the pirate sloop, holding by the <b>back</b> <b>stays.</b> [...] "Who are you?" [...] he called, from the distance, [...] "and whence come you? What do you seek here? What d'ye mean, coming down on us this way?" ...|$|E

50|$|The {{design of}} the bridges is complex. Each of the two decks is {{supported}} by inclined outward-leaning pylons. The decks are suspended from fans of slender steel rods called deck stays—there are 180 on each deck, made up of over 4 km of cable—and are held in position by other rods called <b>back</b> <b>stays.</b> Because the pylons lean the <b>back</b> <b>stays</b> are under tension. The deck is secured in place by steel collars fitted around (although not supported by) the pillars of the railway bridge; the collars are themselves attached to the bridge's foundations by tie-down rods. The entire structure is thus {{held in place by}} exploiting the tensions between the pylons and the various stay rods and struts.|$|E

50|$|The {{symmetric}} cable-stayed system {{consists of}} two A shape pylons, each inclined away from the main span at an angle of 78°, held by 10 pairs of <b>back</b> <b>stays</b> spread into two planes, and 22 main stay cables in one plane anchored on {{and pick up the}} middle spine of the main-span deck. The through-arch system, on the other hand, employs inclined hangers (from arches) anchored on and pick up the outer edges of the main-span deck. With support at the middle and the outer edges, the main-span bridge deck can be made relatively lightweight and slender.|$|E
5000|$|The major {{advantage}} a masthead sloop {{has over}} a fractional one, {{is that the}} jib is larger. Since the jib has no mast {{in front of it}} to cause turbulent airflow over it, it is considered much more efficient than the main, especially for sailing up wind. Also, since the fore stay is attached {{to the top of the}} mast, it pulls directly against the <b>back</b> <b>stay.</b> Tightening the <b>back</b> <b>stay,</b> then, increases the tension on the fore stay. This is useful because the jib needs considerable fore stay tension to set well. This need increases in direct proportion to the wind speed and jib size. Increasing the tension on the <b>back</b> <b>stay</b> does not tend to bend the mast, as it would on a fractional sloop. It puts the mast in compression instead. For this reason the mast on a mast head rig has a thicker section at the top to stand this load.|$|R

It's not so much an origin tale; instead it's a nice layer of depth to Jonah's past that ultimately makes the reader more sympathetic to {{the character}}. I wouldn't {{go so far as}} to say that this added element was absolutely necessary, but it's certainly not unwelcome. Too often with antiheroes like Jonah Hex, writers focus too much on badass one-liners and brutal kills without ever exploring the character's inner workings fully. Thankfully, that's exactly what regular Hex writers Justin Gray and Jimmy Palmiotti do in No Way Back." ...|$|E
50|$|When {{cats are}} calm, {{they tend to}} stand relaxed with a still tail. If they become aggressive, the hind legs stiffen, the rump elevates but the <b>back</b> <b>stays</b> flat, tail hairs are erected, the nose is pushed forward and the ears are pulled back slightly. Because cats have both claws and teeth, they can easily cause injury if they become {{involved}} in a fight, so this posture {{is an attempt to}} elicit deference by a competitor without fighting. The aggressor may attempt to make challengers retreat and will pursue them if they do not flee. A fearful, defensive cat makes itself smaller, lowers itself toward the ground, arches its back and leans its body away from the threat rather than forward. Fighting usually occurs only when escape is impossible.|$|E
50|$|Most R-22 {{boats are}} now {{equipped}} with Inner Mast Furling (IMF) {{as well as}} roller reefing jibs. The R-22 can be sailed single handed from the large, self-bailing cockpit. The cockpit features a flat floor bottom, comfortable seating, and an optional Boom Room. The boom can be raised or lowered, allowing the boat to be sailed with a Bimini top in place providing shade from the sun. The cabin features a partitioned V-berth, 4' long galley with stove and icebox, {{as well as an}} enclosed head. The cabin ceiling features two standing room hatches and an optional pop top and canvas enclosures. The sailboat also uses the swing keel as a self-centering feature when loading onto the trailer. Unlike most sailboats in its class, this boat features positive foam flotation that render it unsinkable, even if holed. The sturdy mast is supported by 9 stays and 9 chain plates: one forward jib stay, 3 stays on each side, and two <b>back</b> <b>stays.</b> The mast can remain upright with any broken stay, even the single forward jib stay. One R-22 boat was caught in hurricane-force winds in Long Island Sound and knocked down 3 times. The R-22 is unsinkable and self-righting, but hurricane-force winds tested its mettle. It broke one shroud and one stay, but was never de-masted and sailed back to Mamaroneck Harbor when the winds died to about 30 mph.|$|E

5000|$|The Seri Wawasan Bridge is a {{longitudinally}} asymmetric cable‐stayed box-girder {{bridge with}} a inverted-Y shape concrete/steel pylon 96m high. The main span, 165m long, {{is supported by}} 30 pairs of forward stay cables, anchored on the 75° forward‐inclined pylon and on the outer edges of the bridge deck, arranged in a fan shape pattern from the side elevation. To counter balance these front stays, a combination of 21 pairs of cable backstays and structural steel tie back was used. The <b>back</b> <b>stay</b> anchored at the (next-) highest point of the pylon is anchored at the curved backstay anchorage point (next-) nearest to the pylon, creating a crisscross‐over pattern from the side elevation, which adds to the aesthetic of the bridge. The overall complexity of the <b>back</b> <b>stay</b> tie <b>back</b> structure, however, may be aesthetically distracting.
