5|$|A <b>broad</b> muzzle {{is found}} on the river otter's flat head, and the ears are round and inconspicuous. The rhinarium is bare, with an obtuse, {{triangular}} projection. Eyes of the animal are small and placed anteriorly. A short, <b>broad</b> rostrum for exhaling and a long, <b>broad</b> cranium define the relatively flat skull. The river otter's nostrils and ears close during submersion, inhibiting water from entering them. Its vibrissae (whiskers) are long and thick, enhancing sensory perception underwater and on land.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Broads</b> Authority is {{the agency}} which has {{statutory}} {{responsibility for the}} <b>Broads</b> in England. Originally, the Nature Conservancy Council (now Natural England), pressed for a special authority to manage the <b>Broads</b> which had been neglected for a long time. In 1978, the forerunner to the present-day <b>Broads</b> Authority was established by the Countryside Commission (now also Natural England). Ten years later, it had become clear that a statutory body was needed, and a special Act of Parliament, The Norfolk and Suffolk <b>Broads</b> Act 1988 (referred to as the <b>Broads</b> Act) made the <b>Broads</b> Authority into a special statutory authority which gave it parity yet establishing key differences with national park authorities. The <b>Broads</b> Authority is not a National Park.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Broads</b> are {{a network}} of mostly navigable rivers and lakes in the English {{counties}} of Norfolk and Suffolk. The lakes, known as <b>broads,</b> were formed by the flooding of peat workings. The <b>Broads,</b> and some surrounding land, were constituted as a special area {{with a level of}} protection similar to a national park by the Norfolk and Suffolk <b>Broads</b> Act 1988. The <b>Broads</b> Authority, a special statutory authority responsible for managing the area, became operational in 1989.|$|R
5|$|Bruchus rufimanus, {{commonly}} known as the <b>broad</b> bean weevil, <b>broad</b> bean beetle, or <b>broad</b> bean seed beetle is a weevil which inhabits crops and fields, as well as some homes. It is a pest of faba beans (Vicia faba L.).The adult weevils feed on pollen, while their larvae tunnel in seeds destroying crops and moving on to new ones once they dry out. The adult beetle, being one of the biggest of its genus, ranges from 3 to 5mm in length.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{to that of}} Nectomys, {{the skull}} is lightly built and has narrow nasals and a <b>broad,</b> round braincase without {{conspicuous}} ridges on it. The zygomatic plate is <b>broad.</b> The incisive foramina (perforations of the front part of the palate) extend between the first molars and are broadest in their back halves. The <b>broad</b> mesopterygoid fossa, the gap behind {{the end of the}} palate, is perforated by sphenopalatine vacuities. The molar crowns are not as simplified as in Nectomys species, but the front cusps of the upper (anterocone) and lower first molar (anteroconid) are not divided in two. In addition to the main roots, the upper and lower first molars have smaller additional roots.|$|E
5|$|Farther north, work on {{the segment}} between Brown and Allen Streets was {{performed}} on one side at a time, keeping one side of <b>Broad</b> Street open at all times. The northbound lanes of this segment were closed on April7, and one direction of the segment was closed until November. It fully reopened on December3 along with the West Main Street–Allen Street segment. Rehabilitation of <b>Broad</b> Street from West Main Street to Exchange Boulevard {{was expected to be}} completed in mid-to-late 2011. The entire project, which also calls for landscape improvements to the area surrounding West <b>Broad</b> Street, was tentatively scheduled to be finished in February 2012.|$|E
5000|$|This is {{the subject}} of ongoing {{controversy}} among some <b>Broads</b> users who note that the <b>Broads</b> is not named in law as a National Park and claim the branding detracts from the <b>Broads</b> Authority's third purpose which is to protect the interests of navigation. In response to this the <b>Broads</b> Authority has stated that its three purposes will remain in equal balance and that the branding is simply for marketing the National Park qualities of the <b>Broads.</b>|$|R
