40|$|The purpose - {{to study}} the morphofunctional changes of upper {{extremities}} in patients with <b>brachymetacarpia.</b> Material and methods. The results of the examination and surgical treatment by distraction osteosynthesis of six patients (10 hands, shortening of the 18 -metacarpal bones) with <b>brachymetacarpia</b> are presented. Results. All patients noted dissatisfaction with the cosmetic state of hands and tiredness during physical activities with the hand. IV ray was shortened in 50 %, V ray - in 33 % of cases and III ray - in 17 %. Limitation of active flexion was noted in all patients, an average flexion was 58. 9 ± 7, 1 °. After treatment flexion increased an average on 20. 5 ° (22. 7 %). Complications were obtained in two patients on three hands. Conclusions. <b>Brachymetacarpia</b> is a rare disease, the etiology of which is still unknown and requires further study. In all cases of <b>brachymetacarpia</b> there is a restriction of active flexion of the MCP joint of the affected ray and the indications for treatment are caused not only by a cosmetic defect, but also functional impairment. Surgical treatment of <b>brachymetacarpia</b> by distraction osteosynthesis gives predictably good results. Complications during the treatment of <b>brachymetacarpia</b> are rare and mostly related to the appearance of contractures, {{in order to prevent}} which in the postoperative period should be used preventive conservative therapy...|$|E
30|$|<b>Brachymetacarpia</b> is a {{congenital}} condition {{characterized by}} undergrowth of the metacarpal bone {{in the hand}} [1]. This {{may be caused by}} idiopathic early closure of the epiphyseal plate [2]. Typically, when one digit is affected, the patient may complain that the “knuckle is missing” due to severe recession of the affected metacarpal [3]. However, there are typically no significant functional issues although this recessed position may restrict metacarpal-phalangeal joint (MPJ) flexion [3]. Patients who pursue treatment for <b>brachymetacarpia</b> are likely seeking improvement in the cosmesis of their hand [2, 3].|$|E
30|$|Distraction osteogenesis for <b>brachymetacarpia</b> {{has been}} {{described}} in several small case series and single case reports, but the rehabilitation required to optimize outcomes has not been reported. We present a case report describing the hand rehabilitation program of a 13 -year-old girl with congenital <b>brachymetacarpia</b> who underwent distraction osteogenesis of the third metacarpal. Intense weekly hand therapy including desensitization, scar massage, range of motion exercises and splinting was essential up to 28  weeks postoperatively to address the progressive changes in the anatomical structures. At final follow-up, she had full active range of motion, no functional deficits in grasp or in-hand manipulation skills and resumed her participation in competitive baton twirling. Patient and family satisfaction with outcome was high. However, better education regarding the progressive symptoms with distraction and daily challenges of wearing an external fixator would have improved the overall experience. With a strong family commitment to rehabilitation and thorough patient education, distraction osteogenesis for <b>brachymetacarpia</b> {{has the potential to}} improve functional and aesthetic outcome in the hand.|$|E
30|$|Distraction osteogenesis for <b>brachymetacarpia</b> {{has been}} {{described}} in several small case series and single case reports [2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. The focuses of these cases are surgical technique used, length gained and the complications encountered to achieve optimal length. Complications reported included loss of range of motion (ROM) in the digit, pin site infections, transient sensory disturbances, premature consolidation of the callus and post-lengthening fracture through the regenerate bone [2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. One aspect {{that has not been}} described in these case reports is the rehabilitation required postoperatively to optimize functional and aesthetic results. Therefore, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to provide a detailed case report of the rehabilitation protocol post-distraction osteogenesis of the third metacarpal in a 13 -year-old girl with congenital <b>brachymetacarpia.</b>|$|E
30|$|Distraction osteogenesis for <b>brachymetacarpia</b> has the {{potential}} to improve functional and aesthetic outcome. Education regarding the progressive symptoms with distraction and daily challenges of wearing an ex-fix is beneficial to the child and family’s experience. As well as, the family and teen’s understanding of the intensity of hand therapy and dedication required postoperative be thoroughly assessed before recommending this procedure.|$|E
30|$|This {{case study}} {{illustrates}} that intense hand rehabilitation {{is required to}} attain the full benefits of distraction osteogenesis for <b>brachymetacarpia.</b> More specifically, hand therapy was essential to address the complications associated with distraction osteogenesis. The reported complications in the literature including stiffness, loss in ROM, sensory disturbances and pin site infections were experienced in this case study [2, 5]. Frequent follow-up and ongoing adaptation of the therapy program were required to address these complications.|$|E
40|$|Metatarsal {{osteomyelitis}} {{in children}} is a very uncommon disease, and this can make diagnosis difficult leading to a delay in treatment that can cause complications like <b>brachymetacarpia</b> or loss of function.

40|$|Metacarpal {{lengthening}} {{was performed}} by callus dis-traction in six children with brachydactyly. Four of the patients were girls and two were boys, with ages ranging from 10 to 14 years (mean age: 12 years). Four of the patients had brachydactyly resulting from injury to the hand and damage to the epiphysis related to infection, while the other two had congeni-tal <b>brachymetacarpia.</b> Two patients had short thumbs, two had short index fingers, and the remaining two had short ring fingers. General anesthesia with a pneumatic tourniquet was used during surgery for all patients. Distraction was initiated on the sixth day following osteotomy, and distractions of 0. 25 mm were carried out at 12 -hour intervals. Adequate length was achieved in an average of 37 days (32 - 44), and adequate union of the bone in an average of 12. 2 (11. 5 - 15) weeks. No bone grafting was done. In one patient with congenital <b>brachymetacarpia,</b> {{it was not possible}} to achieve the desired length because of bending in the Kirshner wires, but union of the bone occurred without difficulty, and the out-come was satisfactory. Although single-stage metacarpal lengthening by cal-lus distraction is time-consuming, it is a simple pro-cedure without complications, which can be used in children with brachydactyly...|$|E
30|$|Written {{informed}} consent was attained from both the patient and parents to describe their experience of the rehabilitation process post-distraction osteogenesis for <b>brachymetacarpia.</b> This 13 -year-old girl first presented to our institution’s {{plastic and reconstructive surgery}} clinic at 12  years of age due to episodes of intense pain with subsequent swelling in her right third finger (D 3) MPJ. The family described that they first noticed the difference in length of her D 3 2  years prior, but there were no functional concerns. Preoperatively, her passive and active ROM in her D 3 was MPJ (0 °/ 60 °), PIPJ (0 °/ 95 °), DIPJ (0 °/ 90 °). Pain is atypical in patients with <b>brachymetacarpia</b> as it has not been described in large cohorts with this condition [1]. However, pain in the affected digit appeared to increase over time with greater writing demands at school and participation in competitive baton twirling. As such, her pain was best described as idiopathic musculoskeletal pain that was clearly triggered by activities with high demand and repetitive use of her intrinsic muscles. Her pain was related to overuse of her affected hand, resulting in pain at rest, and with activity. She rated her worse pain intensity in the prior week as 6 out of 10  on the numeric rating scale (NRS). The decision to undergo distraction osteogenesis was made in October 2013. The family’s primary goal in pursing treatment was to halt the increasing dysfunction caused primarily by pain.|$|E

30|$|Volpi and Fragomen also {{reported}} {{the need for}} intense hand therapy to resolve stiffness after distraction osteogenesis due to intrinsic muscle tightness and scarring of the extensor tendons [2]. This case study supports their concerns that maintaining {{the length of the}} extrinsic and intrinsic extensors is critical in the rehabilitation of the hand during and after distraction osteogenesis. Therapy and home programming that entails short duration and frequent repetition of therapeutic exercises, deep friction massage and splinting are essential. Earlier efforts to address the progressive scarring and maintain lumbrical muscle and EDC length may have prevented the development of the swan neck deformity and MPJ subluxation. However, these complications occurred quickly. Therapists working with children or adults who undergo distraction osteogenesis for <b>brachymetacarpia</b> should expect to deal with such complications. Prevention of sensory disturbances is unlikely, but educating the teen and family of this expected complication prior to distraction osteogenesis may improve overall care.|$|E
40|$|International audienceAcromicric {{dysplasia}} (AD) is an {{autosomal dominant}} disorder characterized by short stature, short extremities, stiff joint and skeleton features including <b>brachymetacarpia,</b> cone-shaped epiphyses, internal notch of the femoral head, and delayed bone age. Recently, we identified fibrillin 1 (FBN 1) as the disease gene of AD. The aim {{of our study}} was to further describe the long-term follow up of AD patients {{with an emphasis on}} orthopedic management. Nine patients with FBN 1 mutations were included in the study ranging in age from 5. 5 to 64 years. For all, detailed clinical and radiological data were available. Results: Birth parameters were always normal and patients progressively developed short stature <- 3 SD. Carpal tunnel syndrome was observed in four patients. We found discrepancy between the carpal bone age and the radius and ulna epiphysis bone ages, a variable severity of hip dysplasia with acetabular dysplasia, epiphyseal and metaphyseal femoral dysplasia resembling Legg-Perthes-Calvé disease and variable pelvic anteversion and hyperlordosis. Orthopedic surgery was required in two patients for hip dysplasia, in one for limb lengthening and in three for carpal tunnel syndrome. Our observations expand the AD phenotype and emphasize the importance of regular orthopedic survey...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Nance-Horan Syndrome (NHS) (OMIM: 302350) {{is a rare}} X-linked {{developmental}} disorder {{characterized by}} bilateral congenital cataracts, with occasional dental anomalies, characteristic dysmorphic features, <b>brachymetacarpia</b> and mental retardation. Carrier females exhibit similar manifestations that are less severe than in affected males. Methods Here, we report a four-generation Chinese family with multiple affected individuals presenting Nance-Horan Syndrome. Whole-exome sequencing combined with RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing was used {{to search for a}} genetic cause underlying the disease phenotype. Results Whole-exome sequencing identified in all affected individuals of the family a novel donor splicing site mutation (NM_ 198270 : c. 10452 ̆ 009 + 2 ̆ 0092 T 2 ̆ 009 > 2 ̆ 009 A) in intron 4 of the gene NHS, which maps to chromosome Xp 22. 13. The identified mutation results in an RNA processing defect causing a 416 -nucleotide addition to exon 4 of the mRNA transcript, likely producing a truncated NHS protein. Conclusions The donor splicing site mutation NM_ 198270 : c. 10452 ̆ 009 + 2 ̆ 0092 T 2 ̆ 009 > 2 ̆ 009 A of the NHS gene is the causative mutation in this Nance-Horan Syndrome family. This research broadens the spectrum of NHS gene mutations, contributing {{to our understanding of the}} molecular genetics of NHS...|$|E
