25|$|The first Soviet {{programmable}} desktop calculator ISKRA 123, {{powered by}} the power grid, was released {{at the start of}} the 1970s. The first Soviet pocket battery-powered programmable calculator, Elektronika B3-21, was developed by the end of 1977 and released at the start of 1978. The successor of B3-21, the Elektronika B3-34 wasn't backward compatible with B3-21, even if it kept the reverse Polish notation (RPN). Thus B3-34 defined a new command set, which later was used in a series of later programmable Soviet calculators. Despite very limited abilities (98 bytes of instruction memory and about 19 stack and addressable registers), people managed to write all kinds of programs for them, including adventure games and libraries of calculus-related functions for engineers. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of programs were written for these machines, from practical scientific and business software, which were used in real-life offices and labs, to fun games for children. The Elektronika MK-52 calculator (using the extended B3-34 command set, and featuring internal EEPROM memory for storing programs and external interface for EEPROM cards and other periphery) was used in Soviet spacecraft program (for Soyuz TM-7 flight) as a backup of the <b>board</b> <b>computer.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The IBM RAD6000 {{radiation}} hardened single <b>board</b> <b>computer,</b> now produced by BAE Systems, was initially {{developed in a}} collaboration with the Space Electronics and Protection Branch and IBM Federal Systems and is now used on nearly 200 satellites and robotic spacecraft, including on the twin Mars Exploration Rovers—Spirit and Opportunity. In November 2005, the AFRL XSS-11 satellite demonstrator received Popular Science's [...] "Best of What's New" [...] award in the Aviation and Space category. The Space Vehicles Directorate is also a leading collaborator in the Department of Defense Operationally Responsive Space Office's Tactical Satellite Program and served as program manager {{for the development of}} TacSat-2, TacSat-3, and is current program manager for the development of TacSat-5. They also have contributed experimental sensors to TacSat-4 which is managed by the NRL's Center for Space Technology.|$|E
2500|$|The {{system uses}} a loop between the rails, to send {{instructions}} to the train and so the train can send updates to the control centre. Each side of the loop crosses over approximately every 25m, and each 25m section is subdivided into 4 further sections, effectively creating 160 virtual 'blocks' in every kilometre of track. These crossovers cause a 180 degree phase shift that is detected by the train to tell when it has passed over one. The system allows trains {{to get up to}} 50m away from each other while both are moving at very low speeds. The system is capable of bi-directional or [...] "wrong way running", but London Underground has this feature disabled. Thus, a train has to be put into restricted manual to run the wrong way along a track. There are exceptions, such as the sidings north of Wembley Park and West Hampstead, and a small area around Stratford Market Depot where the track becomes [...] "locked out" [...] to any other train but the one given a movement authority. Trains constantly receive speed instructions based on the train's determined position that uses a wheel tachometer between loop crossovers, however they receive definite instructions once they report and have passed over a track loop. S40 does not allow speeds higher than 108km/h, and the 1996 stock had to be upgraded slightly so it could use the new equipment, which includes a Vehicle On <b>Board</b> <b>Computer</b> for the S40 system that must interface with the train's control system.|$|E

2500|$|The {{signalling}} {{technology used}} {{on all three}} SkyTrain lines to run trains automatically was originally developed by Alcatel, and loaded from a 3.5" [...] diskette. There are four systems called the VCC (Vehicle Control Computer) with three divided over the mainline {{and one for the}} storage yard. VCC1 controls trains from Waterfront to Royal Oak; VCC2 controls trains from Royal Oak to King George (it now also controls a portion of the Millennium line); and VCC3 controls trains in the yard. Each VCC is a cluster of three IBM rack-mount computers with Intel-IA32 processors and proprietary hardware, configured in a fault tolerant setup. For every command that is sent to a VCC, {{at least two of the}} computers must agree with the action, otherwise an error is generated and the command is ignored. The VCCs communicates with the train's VOBC (Vehicle On <b>Board</b> <b>Computer),</b> whose data is transmitted through leaky coax cable laid along the tracks. There are up to two VOBCs per married-pair trains, i.e., 4-car train would have two VOBCs. If the VCCs fail or communication between the VCC and the VOBC is lost, the train will 'time-out' and (EB) emergency-brake through a Quester Tangent BAM (Brake Assurance Monitor) that controls propulsion and braking systems. The VCCs have a command-line-console, but normally the trains are controlled through a system known as the SMC, which also provides scheduling. All commands from the SMC are verified to be safe by the VCC before execution. However if the SMC fails, the system can still be operated through the VCC. This is known as 'degraded mode'. The SkyTrain HMU (Health Monitoring Unit) developed by Quester Tangent [...] provides monitoring and diagnostic functionality for vehicle maintenance by connecting to CAN vehicle network and providing a maintenance display in the Hoslter Panel.|$|E
