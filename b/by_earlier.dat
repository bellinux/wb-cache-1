5|$|According to {{historian}} Charles Coulson {{the accumulation}} of wealth and resources, such as food, led {{to the need for}} defensive structures. The earliest fortifications originated in the Fertile Crescent, the Indus Valley, Egypt, and China where settlements were protected by large walls. Northern Europe was slower than the East to develop defensive structures and {{it was not until the}} Bronze Age that hill forts developed and began to spread across Europe. In the medieval period castles were influenced <b>by</b> <b>earlier</b> forms of elite architecture, contributing to regional variations. Importantly, while castles had military aspects, they contained a recognisable household structure within their walls, reflecting the multi-functional use of these buildings.|$|E
5|$|Bhima Kavi {{paved the}} way for the shatpadi metre {{tradition}} in his work Basavapurana (c.1369), a form first experimented with by the 12th century Hoysala poet Raghavanka. Bhima Kavi's work, a biography of Basavanna, is an important Veerashaiva purana. It was inspired <b>by</b> <b>earlier</b> biographies of Basavanna by the Hoysala poet Harihara (the author of the first biographical narrative poem of the protagonist's life called Basavaraja Ragale) and the Telugu writings of Palkuriki Somanatha of the 13th century. Bhima Kavi humbly acknowledges and eulogises his predecessors in a writing full of well-known personalities.|$|E

5|$|In {{order for}} the Tornado to perform well as a {{low-level}} supersonic strike aircraft, it was considered necessary for it to possess good high-speed and low-speed flight characteristics. To achieve high-speed performance, a swept or delta wing is typically adopted, but these wing designs are inefficient at low speeds. To operate at both high and low speeds with great effectiveness, the Tornado uses a variable-sweep wing. This approach had been adopted <b>by</b> <b>earlier</b> aircraft, such as the American General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark strike fighter, and the Soviet Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23 fighter. The F-111 has many similarities with the smaller Tornado; however, the Tornado differs in being a multi-role aircraft with more advanced onboard systems and avionics.|$|E
5|$|Khurshid (Middle Persian: , Khōrshēd; Tabari/, Spāhbed Khōrshīd 'General Khorshid'; 734–761), erroneously {{designated}} Khurshid II <b>by</b> <b>earlier</b> scholars, was {{the last}} Dabuyid ispahbadh of Tabaristan. He succeeded to the throne at an early age, and was supervised by his uncle as regent {{until he reached the}} age of fourteen. Khurshid tried to assert his independence from his vassalage to the Caliphate, supported various rebellions and maintained diplomatic contacts with Tang China. Finally, the Abbasids conquered his country in 759–760, and captured most members of his family. Khurshid fled to Daylam, where he ended his life.|$|E
5|$|Mulla Sadra (c. 1571/2 – 1640) was an Iranian Shia Islamic philosopher who was {{influenced}} <b>by</b> <b>earlier</b> Muslim philosophers such as Avicenna and Suhrawardi, {{as well as}} the Sufi metaphysician Ibn 'Arabi. Sadra discussed Avicenna's arguments for the existence of God, claiming that they were not a priori. He rejected the argument on the basis that existence precedes essence, or that the existence of human beings is more fundamental than their essence.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the major}} sources of income in the {{territory}} during the 1850s was U.S. government annuity payments to the Ojibwe and other tribes required <b>by</b> <b>earlier</b> treaties. These payments amounted to more than $380,000 per year on average ($ in present-day terms) compared to approximately $120,000 per year ($ in present-day terms) given to the territory itself for development. Because of corruption, and mishandling of the payments to the tribes, {{a great deal of}} the money was used directly by U.S. settlers for commercial and community development with questionable benefit to the tribes. At the beginning of the Minnesota Territory, in fact, these payments were the territory's most important source of income since the fur trade was no longer as lucrative as it had once been and other exports were still negligible.|$|E
5|$|The Corpus Juris Civilis, {{the name}} for the massive body of law promulgated by Emperor Justinian from the 530s CE and onwards, {{consists}} of two historical collections of laws and their interpretation (the Digest, opinions of the pre-eminent lawyers from the past, and the Codex Justinianus, a collection of edicts and rescripts <b>by</b> <b>earlier</b> emperors), along with Jusinian's prefatory introduction text for students of Law, Institutes, plus the Novels, Justinian's own, later edicts. That the earlier collections {{were meant to be}} sources for the actual, current practice of law, rather than just being of historical interest, can be seen, for example, from the inclusion, and modification of Modestinus' famous description of poena cullei (Digest 48.9.9), in Justinian's own law text in Institutes 4.18.6.|$|E
5|$|The National Trust {{took control}} of the Tor in 1933, but repairs were delayed until after the Second World War. During the 1960s, {{excavations}} identified cracks in the rock, suggesting the ground had moved in the past. This, combined with wind erosion, started to expose the footings of the tower, which were repaired with concrete. Erosion caused by the feet of the increasing number of visitors was also a problem and paths were laid to enable them to reach the summit without damaging the terraces. After 2000, enhancements to the access and repairs to the tower, including rebuilding of the parapet, were carried out. These included the replacement of some of the masonry damaged <b>by</b> <b>earlier</b> repairs with new stone from the Hadspen Quarry.|$|E

5|$|The Upanishad {{asserts that}} anyone can renounce – this choice is entirely up to the individual, {{regardless}} of which Ashrama (stage of life) he is in. The Jabala Upanishad seems to justify suicide as an individual choice in certain circumstances, a view opposed <b>by</b> <b>earlier</b> Vedic texts and Principal Upanishads. Those too sick may renounce the worldly life in their mind. The Jabala Upanishad presents the Vedanta philosophy view that one who truly renounces lives an ethical life, which includes not injuring anyone in thought, word or deed. Such a sannyasi (renunciate) abandons all rituals, is without attachments to anything or anyone, and is one who {{is devoted to the}} oneness of Atman and Brahman.|$|E
5|$|The {{results of}} {{paleontology}} have {{also contributed to}} the development of evolutionary theory. In 1944 George Gaylord Simpson published Tempo and Mode in Evolution, which used quantitative analysis to show that the fossil record was consistent with the branching, non-directional, patterns predicted by the advocates of evolution driven by natural selection and genetic drift rather than the linear trends predicted <b>by</b> <b>earlier</b> advocates of neo-Lamarckism and orthogenesis. This integrated paleontology into the modern evolutionary synthesis. In 1972 Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould used fossil evidence to advocate the theory of punctuated equilibrium, which maintains that evolution is characterized by long periods of relative stasis and much shorter periods of relatively rapid change.|$|E
5|$|This work {{maintains}} a heavy {{importance in the}} Art History world, as {{it is widely believed}} to be the first painting, since the fall of Rome (ca. 476 AD), to use Scientific Linear One Point Perspective, or, all the orthogonals point to one vanishing point, in this case, Christ. Also, it is one of the first paintings that does away with the use of a head-cluster. A technique employed <b>by</b> <b>earlier</b> Proto-Renaissance artists, such as Giotto or Duccio. If you were to walk into the painting, you could walk around Jesus Christ, in the semicircle created, and back out the painting again with ease.|$|E

5|$|Until {{relatively}} recently, Sutorius eximius {{was typically}} considered an edible mushroom, and listed as so in several North American field guides. This continued a trend initiated <b>by</b> <b>earlier</b> authors such as Charles McIlvaine and Louis Krieger, who both wrote favorably of the bolete's esculent properties. A series of poisonings reported from the New England region and eastern Canada have {{cast doubt on}} the edibility of this fungus. According to Greg Marley, author Roger Phillips was the first to include a toxicity warning in his 1991 book Mushrooms of North America. Despite its revised status in North America, the lilac-brown bolete {{remains one of the most}} common fungi used as food by locals in the Hengduan Mountains region of southwestern China.|$|E
5|$|Cell theory led {{biologists}} to re-envision individual organisms as interdependent assemblages {{of individual}} cells. Scientists in the rising field of cytology, armed with increasingly powerful microscopes and new staining methods, soon {{found that even}} single cells were far {{more complex than the}} homogeneous fluid-filled chambers described <b>by</b> <b>earlier</b> microscopists. Robert Brown had described the nucleus in 1831, {{and by the end of}} the 19th century cytologists identified many of the key cell components: chromosomes, centrosomes mitochondria, chloroplasts, and other structures made visible through staining. Between 1874 and 1884 Walther Flemming described the discrete stages of mitosis, showing that they were not artifacts of staining but occurred in living cells, and moreover, that chromosomes doubled in number just before the cell divided and a daughter cell was produced. Much of the research on cell reproduction came together in August Weismann's theory of heredity: he identified the nucleus (in particular chromosomes) as the hereditary material, proposed the distinction between somatic cells and germ cells (arguing that chromosome number must be halved for germ cells, a precursor to the concept of meiosis), and adopted Hugo de Vries's theory of pangenes. Weismannism was extremely influential, especially in the new field of experimental embryology.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{representing}} a new vessel, the Enterprise-A {{was the same}} model {{that had been used}} since 1979. Poorly regarded <b>by</b> <b>earlier</b> effects artists because of its complicated wiring and bulk, the Enterprises hairline cracks were puttied and sanded down, and the internal circuitry was redone. The new model's running lights were matched to similar intensities, saving the effects artists time because the lights would look correct with only a single pass, instead of three passes required previously (for the sensor dome, running lights, and window lights). One unfortunate byproduct of the fixes was the loss of the model's distinctive pearlescent finish. The elaborate sheen was never visible on screen (lighting schemes prevented reflections while filming so the ship could be properly inserted into effects shots) and so when the model was repainted with conventional techniques the effect was lost. The Bird of Prey had been damaged from work in The Voyage Home, where the ship was supposed to fly around the sun. To suggest singes, the model had been painted with black-tinged rubber cement, with the expectation that this application would rub off. The cement instead sat on the model and baked itself to the model surface, and had to be scrubbed off.|$|E

5|$|Gonzalo de Alvarado {{and his men}} {{decided to}} remain; the area was {{apparently}} well-populated enough to provide worthwhile tribute, {{and the existence of}} precious metal deposits in the region had already been established <b>by</b> <b>earlier</b> forays. Alvarado decided to found the new town of Gracias a Dios at Opoa, rather than at the nearby site that had been set aside by Chávez. In late 1536, Gonzalo de Alvarado finally founded the new town, assigning officials as had been designated by his brother. Although 100 citizens had been assigned by Pedro de Alvarado, in reality it had about 40 upon its foundation. The town only remained at Opoa for a brief period, before it was transferred to a new site. Gonzalo and his men campaigned to impose their control over a wide area, penetrating as far as the Comayagua valley. Although claiming conquest of a wide region, Gonzalo had too few soldiers to effectively control it. Native resistance was such that the colonists were soon threatened by starvation, and the natives refused to serve the Spanish. San Pedro was in a similar situation, and was unable to provide any kind of relief to Gracias a Dios. The colonists appealed to Maldonado in Guatemala for assistance, and were informed that Francisco de Montejo would soon be taking up governorship, and would provide any assistance necessary.|$|E
5|$|In 1838 William Macarthur planted Riesling vines near Penrith in New South Wales. Riesling was {{the most}} planted white grape in Australia until the early 1990s when Chardonnay greatly {{increased}} in popularity. Riesling still flourishes in The Great Southern (in particular Mt Barker, Frankland River and Porongorup), Clare Valley, in particular the areas of Watervale and around the Polish Hill River, and the cooler Eden Valley and High Eden regions. The warmer Australian climate produces thicker skinned grapes, sometimes seven times the thickness of German grown grape. The grapes ripening in free drain soil composed of red soil over limestone and shale, producing a lean wine that as it matures produces toasty, honeycomb and lime aromas and flavors. It is common for Australian Rieslings to be fermented at low temperatures in stainless steel tanks with no oxidation of the wine and followed <b>by</b> <b>earlier</b> bottling.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th century, George Mackenzie, 1st Earl of Cromartie wrote {{a history}} of the Mackenzies, which {{included}} a genealogy of the MacLeods of Lewis (from whom he was also descended). Cromartie's genealogy listed Leod as a son of Harald, son of Godred Donn. Later genealogies, however, made Leod a son of Olaf the Black—genealogies found in Sir Robert Douglas of Glenbervie's Baronage of Scotland, of 1798; and the Bannatyne manuscript, which dates to about 1830. In the Baronage of Scotland, Glenbervie stated that he had obtained information from the MacLeods of Dunvegan which was allegedly based upon information found within the mediaeval Chronicles of Mann and William Camden's 17th century Britannia—however, neither of these two works make any mention of Leod at all. In 1977, historian William Matheson rejected the traditional descent from Olaf the Black on the basis that it is unsupported by any facts whatsoever, and that it is also contradicted <b>by</b> <b>earlier</b> Gaelic-language genealogies which may be more authentic.|$|E
