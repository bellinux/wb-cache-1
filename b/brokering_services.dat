40|$|An {{important}} {{problem for}} agents in open multiagent systems {{is how to}} find agents that match certain criteria. A number of middle agent services, such as matchmaking and <b>brokering</b> <b>services,</b> have been proposed to address this problem. However, the search capabilities of such services are relatively limited since the match criteria they use are relatively inflexible. We propose ATSpace, a middle agent to support application-oriented matchmaking and <b>brokering</b> <b>services.</b> Application agents in ATSpace deliver their own search algorithms to a public tuple space which holds agent property data; the tuple space executes the search algorithms on this data. We show how the ATSpace model increases the dynamicity and flexibility of middle agent services. Unfortunately, the model also introduces security threats: the data and access control restrictions in ATSpace may be compromised, and system availability may be affected. We describe some mechanisms to mitigate these security threats...|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper {{proposes a}} coordinated load {{management}} protocol for Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) coupled federated Grid systems. The {{participants in the}} system, such as the resource providers and the consumers who belong to multiple control domains, work together to enable a coordinated federation. The coordinated load management protocol embeds a logical spatial index over a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) space for efficient management of the coordination objects; the DHT-based space serves {{as a kind of}} decentralized blackboard system. We show that our coordination protocol has a message complexity that is logarithmic to the number of nodes in the system, which is significantly better than existing broadcast based coordination protocols. The proposed load management protocol can be applied for efficiently coordinating resource <b>brokering</b> <b>services</b> of distributed computing systems such as grids and PlanetLab. Resource <b>brokering</b> <b>services</b> are the main components that control the way applications are scheduled, managed and allocated in a distributed, heterogeneous, and dynamic Grid computing environments.

40|$|Crowdsourcing is {{evolving}} into powerful outsourcing options for organizations by {{providing access to}} the intellectual capital within a vast knowledge community. Innovation <b>brokering</b> <b>services</b> have emerged to facilitate crowdsourcing projects by connecting up companies with potential solution providers within the wider ‘crowd’. Most existing innovation <b>brokering</b> <b>services</b> are primarily aimed at larger organizations, however, Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) offer considerable potential for crowdsourcing activity since they are typically the innovation and employment engines in society; they are typically more nimble and responsive to the business environment than the larger companies. SMEs have very different challenges and needs to larger organizations since they have fewer resources, a more limited knowledge and skill base, and immature management practices. Consequently, innovation brokering for SMEs require considerably more support than for larger organizations. This paper identifies the crowdsourcing innovation brokerage facilities needed by SMEs, and presents an architecture that encourages knowledge sharing, development of community, support in mixing and matching capabilities, and management of stakeholders’ risks. Innovation brokering is emerging as a novel business model that is challenging concepts of the traditional value chain and organizational boundaries...|$|E

The {{participants in the}} system such as the resource providers and the consumers who belong to multiple control domains work together to enable a coordinated federation. The coordinated load management protocol embeds a logical spatial index over a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) space as regards to management of complex coordination objects. The DHT based space serves as a decentralised blackboard system, which facilitates autonomous participants with respect to coordinating their activities. We show that our coordination protocol involves low overhead with respect to number of messages generated, and has scalability properties. Our coordinated load management protocol is in particular applicable for resource <b>brokering</b> <b>services</b> of computational grids and PlanetLab. Resource <b>brokering</b> <b>services</b> are the main components that control the way applications are scheduled, managed and allocated in a distributed, heterogeneous and dynamic Grid computing environment. Existing Grid computing systems such as resource brokers, e-Science application work-flow schedulers operate in tandem but still lack a coordination mechanism {{that can lead to}} efficient application schedules across distributed resources. Further, lack of coordination exacerbates the utilisation of various resources (such as computing cycles and network bandwidth). The feasibility of the proposed coordinated load management protocol is studied through extensive simulations. I...|$|E
