40|$|Cocoa {{butter is}} an {{essential}} ingredient in chocolate as it forms the continuous phase of chocolate. It’s therefore responsible for the gloss, texture and typical melting behaviour of ‘irresistible’ chocolate. The aim {{of this research was}} to change the functionality of cocoa butter by two different methods. In the first part, cocoa butter was modified by physical refining by using packed column steam refining with or without silica pretreatment. The physicochemical properties of the refined cocoa butters were determined and in the next step they were applied in a milk chocolate formulation. The produced milk chocolates were then evaluated for different quality characteristics. It was clear that the free fatty acids played a predominant role but the exact mechanism remained unclear. In the second part of this research, cocoa butter was changed more drastically as it was submitted to an enzymatic modification process, aiming to produce diacylglycerols. Diacylglycerols have distinct physicochemical properties compared to triacylglycerols due to the presence of a free hydroxyl group. An enzymatic glycerolysis reaction was optimized and a highly purified diacylglycerol fraction was obtained by short path distillation. The produced diacylglycerols were physicochemically characterized and <b>blended</b> with cocoa <b>butter</b> to screen their applicability in confectionary products. A multi-methodological approach was used to study the isothermal crystallization of cocoa butter at 20 °C. In {{the last part of the}} research, the cocoa butter based diacylglycerols were applied in a dark chocolate formulation and the functional properties were derived by determining the melting and rheological behaviour and texture. As migration fat bloom remains one of the major quality issues in composed chocolate products, it was investigated whether cocoa butter based diacylglycerols could delay or prevent this phenomenon...|$|R

Two different ratios, 70 % shea butter: 30 % spices and 85 % shea butter: 15 % spices were prepared from raw shea butter and various spices. The treatments were packaged in a transparent plastic bowl and stored {{at room temperature}} for 4 weeks while samples were taken for analysis at 0, 2 and 4 weeks of storage. Samples were examined for chemical, antioxidant properties, anti-nutritional factors and sensory evaluation. Saponification value ranged from 47. 7 mg KOH/g - 104. 5 mg KOH/g while shea butter + spices exhibited lower values compared to 100 % shea butter (control). It was observed that iodine value of both the blends and control decreased as storage days increased except for samples of shea butter + ginger (SGG) and shea butter + suya spice (SSS) at 70 : 30 ratio.

40|$|Dietary n- 3 {{fatty acids}} (FAs) found in fish oils {{markedly}} lower plasma triglyceride (TG) and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) levels in both normal and hypertriglyceridemic subjects. The present {{study examined the}} mechanism of this effect. Ten subjects with widely different plasma triglyceride levels (82 to 1002 mg/dl) were fed metabolically controlled diets containing 20 % fat. The control diet contained a <b>blend</b> of cocoa <b>butter</b> and peanut oil (P/S = 0. 8). The test diet contained fish oil (P/S = 1. 1) and provided 10 - 17 g of n- 3 FAs per day (depending on calorie intake). After 3 to 5 weeks of each diet, the kinetics of VLDL-TG were determined over a 48 -h period after the injection of [3 H]glycerol. The fish oil diet reduced the VLDL-TG synthetic rate from 23 * 14. 3 (mean * SD) to 12. 6 f 7. 5 mg/h per kg ideal weight (P<O. O 05) and increased the frac-tional catabolic rate (FCR) for VLDL-TG from 0. 23 * 0. 12 to 0. 38 * 0. 16 h- 1 (PC 0. 005). At the same time, there was a 66 % reduction of plasma triglyceride levels, resulting largely from a 78 % decrease in VLDL-TG levels (398 * 317 to 87 + 77 mg/dl; PC 0. 005). There was a strong correlation (Y = 0. 83; P<O. Ol) between the change in synthetic rates and pool sizes, {{but there was no}} correlation (r = 0. 24; NS) between changes in FCRs and pool sizes. The VLDL cholesterol: triglyceride ratio increased during the n- 3 diet suggesting that smaller VLDL particles were present. These particles would be expected to leave the VLDL fraction more rapidly than larger particles producing a higher FCR. m We conclude that the hypotriglyceridemic effect of fish oil appears to be caused primarily by an inhibition of very low density lipoprotein-triglyceride synthesis, but an additional, independent effect upon VLDL catabolsi...|$|R
40|$|In this study, the {{churning}} efficiency of milk sample for buttermaking from camel milk by blending it with goat milk and microbiological quality of butter made at different blending levels were assessed. The experiment {{was laid out}} in completely randomized design with five treatments: T 1 (100 % camel milk), T 2 (75 % camel and 25 % goat milk), T 3 (50 % camel and 50 % goat milk), T 4 (25 % camel and 75 % goat milk) and T 5 (100 % goat milk). The churning efficiency and microbiological quality of the milk and butter samples were analyzed following standard procedures. The fermentation time (11. 33 days), churning time (121. 7 min) and churning temperature (28 °C) of T 1 were significantly (P < 0. 001) higher than the other milk samples. T 1 had significantly (P < 0. 001) lower churning pH (4. 13) and butter yield (49. 3 g/L) than the other samples. T 3 and T 4 had significantly (P < 0. 001) higher butter yield than the other milk samples. The fermentation time, churning time and churning temperature of T 5 were significantly (P < 0. 001) lower than the rest and T 5 required significantly (P < 0. 001) higher churning pH than the other milk samples. The coliform count (CC), enterobacteriaceae count (EBC), lipolytic bacteria count (LBC) and {{yeast and mould count}} (YMC) of T 1 was significantly (P < 0. 001) higher than the other butter samples.

40|$|Samples of {{inedible}} bulk mutton tallow {{were collected}} monthly throughout two killing seasons from one meat killing plant. These samples plus one sample from another plant, were analysed for fatty acid and triglyceride composition. In these samples, four fatty acids (myristic (14 : 0), palmitic (16 : 0), stearic (18 : 0) and oleic (18 : 1)) comprised 88. 6 % {{of the total}} fatty acids, {{and there was an}} average of 16 % trisaturated triglycerides, 38 % disaturated triglycerides and 46 % of triglycerides with a greater degree of unsaturation. Overall, there was a significant decrease in the proportion of 14 : 0, and {{a significant increase in the}} proportion of 18 : 0, from November to June; and there was a significant difference in the mean proportion of 16 : 0, and also 18 : 1, between the two seasons. There was a significant difference in the proportion of cis monounsaturated triglycerides, and the more highly unsaturated triglycerides, between some of the different tallows analysed. There was a significant decrease in the proportion of 2 -oleo disaturated triglycerides from November to June, with a range from 10. 0 % (May, 1978) to 20. 5 % (November, 1976). An acetone fractionation scheme was developed with the main aim of concentrating these 2 -oleo disaturated triglycerides into one fraction (the intermediate fraction) which may be useful as a cocoa butter replacer. The first precipitate (the hard fraction was separated by filtration, and the filtrate was adjusted for solvent : fat ratio and then further cooled to precipitate the intermediate fraction. After separation of this precipitate, acetone was distilled from the filtrate to produce a final fraction (the soft fraction). A screening experiment showed that the solvent : fat ratio at each crystallisation, the temperature to which the fat solution was cooled at each crystallisation, the water content of the acetone and the degree of agitation during crystallisation all affected the fractionation. The effect of these variables upon one sample of mutton tallow was studied, and mathematical models were developed to predict the yields of the three fractions and the melting properties of the intermediate fraction, The model predicting the melting properties of the intermediate fraction was used to estimate the fractionation conditions which would give an intermediate fraction with melting properties most similar to those of cocoa butter. From this, a fractionation was performed with first and second crystallisation temperatures of 9. 2 °C and 5. 2 °C respectively, solvent to fat ratios at the first and second crystallisations of 1. 0 : 1 and 10. 0 : 1 respectively, a water concentration in the acetone of 0. 6 % and a defined agitation condition. The yields of the hard, intermediate and soft fractions were 34. 5 wt %, 2. 5 wt % and 63. 0 wt % of the tallow respectively. The intermediate fraction contained 51. 0 % of 2 -oleo disaturated triglycerides (compared to 68. 9 % in cocoa butter) and had very similar melting properties to cocoa butter. Then the fractionation scheme was modified to give a greater yield of the intermediate fraction (8. 3 wt %) but the melting properties of this intermediate fraction were less similar to those of cocoa butter. This latter fractionation scheme was scaled up (from 20 g tallow to 200 g and 1 kg). On each scale an intermediate fraction with consistent yield and melting properties was obtained. The yields of the other two fractions varied, however, and overall there was a considerable difference in the behaviour of the fractionations on each scale. Attempts on the 1 kg scale to produce an intermediate fraction with properties similar to those of the best 20 g intermediate fraction (i. e. similar to cocoa butter) were unsuccessful. The highest proportion of the important 2 -oleo disaturated triglycerides attained in a 1 kg scale intermediate fraction was 36. 8 %, and this fraction melted, over a wider temperature range than cocoa butter. This intermediate fraction may be useful as a cocoa butter substitute in a coating chocolate, but is unlikely to be able to replace cocoa butter in chocolate. The hard fraction produced from this 1 kg fractionation (23. 0 wt % of the tallow) showed promise in a baking shortening <b>blend</b> with <b>butter,</b> but was too hard to be useful as a pastry shortening.
