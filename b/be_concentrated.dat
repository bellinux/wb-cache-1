They were in high demand in the United States from the late 19th century until the beginning of World War I. During the 1920s, livestock production began to decline.

5|$|After an {{unremarkable}} school career, Eichmann briefly {{worked for}} his father's mining company in Austria, {{where the family}} had moved in 1914. He worked as a travelling oil salesman beginning in 1927, and joined both the Nazi Party and the SS in 1932. After returning to Germany in 1933, he joined the Sicherheitsdienst (SD; Security Service), where he was appointed {{head of the department}} responsible for Jewish affairs—especially emigration, which the Nazis encouraged through violence and economic pressure. After the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, Eichmann and his staff arranged for Jews to <b>be</b> <b>concentrated</b> in ghettos in major cities with the expectation that they would be transported either farther east or overseas. Eichmann drew up plans for a Jewish reservation, first at Nisko in south-east Poland and later in Madagascar, but neither of these plans were ever carried out.|$|E
5|$|At room temperature, {{hydrogen}} chloride is a colourless gas, {{like all the}} hydrogen halides apart from hydrogen fluoride, since hydrogen cannot form strong hydrogen bonds to the larger electronegative chlorine atom; however, weak hydrogen bonding is present in solid crystalline {{hydrogen chloride}} at low temperatures, similar to the hydrogen fluoride structure, before disorder begins to prevail as the temperature is raised. Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid (pKa = −7) because the hydrogen bonds to chlorine are too weak to inhibit dissociation. The HCl/H2O system has many hydrates HCl·nH2O for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. Beyond a 1:1 mixture of HCl and H2O, the system separates completely into two separate liquid phases. Hydrochloric acid forms an azeotrope with boiling point 108.58°C at 20.22g HCl per 100g solution; thus hydrochloric acid cannot <b>be</b> <b>concentrated</b> beyond this point by distillation.|$|E
5|$|In the Geiger–Marsden experiment, Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden (colleagues of Rutherford {{working at}} his behest) shot alpha {{particles}} at thin sheets {{of metal and}} measured their deflection {{through the use of}} a fluorescent screen. Given the very small mass of the electrons, the high momentum of the alpha particles, and the low concentration of the positive charge of the plum pudding model, the experimenters expected all the alpha particles to pass through the metal foil without significant deflection. To their astonishment, a small fraction of the alpha particles experienced heavy deflection. Rutherford concluded that the positive charge of the atom must <b>be</b> <b>concentrated</b> in a very tiny volume to produce an electric field sufficiently intense to deflect the alpha particles so strongly.|$|E

5|$|Of all the North Korean attacks {{along the}} Pusan Perimeter, the Second Battle of Naktong Bulge {{is seen by}} historians as the most serious threat. It was the battle in which the North Koreans made the most {{substantial}} gains, splitting the US 2nd Infantry Division in half and briefly capturing Yongsan, where they were very close to breaching through to the US forces' supply lines and threatening other divisions' rear areas. However, once again the fatal weakness of the North Korean Army had cost it victory after an impressive initial success—its communications and supply were not capable of exploiting a breakthrough and of supporting a continuing attack {{in the face of}} massive air, armor, and artillery fire that could <b>be</b> <b>concentrated</b> against its troops at critical points.

5|$|Operation Tonga {{originated}} in the planning of Operation Overlord, the Allied plan for the eventual invasion and liberation of German-occupied France. Invasion planning begun in May 1943, when President of the United States Franklin Delano Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill met during the Washington Conference. The two Allied leaders decided that all available Allied forces should <b>be</b> <b>concentrated</b> in the United Kingdom, and that planning for the invasion of North-Western Europe should begin. A provisional target date of May 1944 was set with the code-name 'Overlord' decided upon. A joint Anglo-American planning staff was created under Lieutenant-General Frederick E. Morgan, who was given the title of Chief of Staff to the Supreme Allied Commander (COSSAC).|$|E

5|$|The 19th Air Brigade's {{primary mission}} was to defend the {{industrial}} facilities in northern Kyūshū, and particularly the iron works at Yawata. The brigade's plans {{for the defense of}} the Western District called for its interceptor aircraft to <b>be</b> <b>concentrated</b> over Yawata and not move far from the area. While this inflexible deployment was considered unsatisfactory by the 19th Air Brigade, it was deemed necessary as few aircraft were available, the only searchlight units needed to facilitate night operations were stationed near Yawata and northern Kyūshū was regarded by the Army as being the most important region in the Western District. Prior to the raid on Yawata the 19th Air Brigade undertook joint planning with anti-aircraft units and implemented a training program which included practice in responding to alerts and night flying.|$|E
