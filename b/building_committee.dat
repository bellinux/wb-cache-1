5|$|In July 1942 the Royal Navy {{formed the}} Future <b>Building</b> <b>Committee,</b> chaired by the Deputy First Sea Lord, {{to examine the}} fleet's {{requirements}} {{for the rest of}} the war. Tasked with anticipating the Navy's readiness and requirements for January 1944, the committee realised that a major expansion of naval aviation was required, which meant that more aircraft carriers would be needed. Many factors combined to drive up the size of these new carriers, notably the increasing size and speed of aircraft and the desire to increase the numbers of aircraft aboard fleet carriers. Another important consideration was the change in carrier tactics from the earlier doctrine of more attacks with smaller numbers of aircraft to the use of large, single airstrikes.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1960s, {{directors}} of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., declared {{the need for a}} new building. Paul Mellon, a primary benefactor of the gallery and a member of its <b>building</b> <b>committee,</b> set to work with his assistant J. Carter Brown (who became gallery director in 1969) to find an architect. The new structure would be located to the east of the original building, and tasked with two functions: offer a large space for public appreciation of various popular collections; and house office space as well as archives for scholarship and research. They likened the scope of the new facility to the Library of Alexandria. After inspecting Pei's work at the Des Moines Art Center in Iowa and the Johnson Museum at Cornell University, they offered him the commission.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet {{news media}} and {{government}} officials soon began to discuss the apparent substandard construction styles that had caused so many of Armenia's buildings to collapse. Gorbachev, in a TV interview several weeks after his expedited return from New York City, said that the concrete blocks had been built with more than enough sand but too little concrete, and suggested that the concrete had been stolen. , deputy chairman of the state <b>building</b> <b>committee,</b> stated that many newer homes collapsed as well {{and that he was}} beginning an investigation into the matter and that criminal charges would be brought. The official communist party newspaper Pravda said that poor construction, like other issues of neglect in the Soviet system, could be blamed on the Era of Stagnation from the era of Leonid Brezhnev.|$|E

5|$|Abramson was {{a leading}} {{architect}} of synagogue-centers at that time. He designed a number of New York examples, including the original synagogue-center, the Manhattan Jewish Center (1918), {{as well as the}} Brooklyn Jewish Center, the Flatbush Jewish Center, and the Ocean Parkway Jewish Center (all constructed in Brooklyn between 1920 and 1924). While the Flatbush Jewish Center has been completely remodeled, the Brooklyn and Ocean Parkway Jewish Centers are visually similar to the East Midwood Jewish Center, and the Brooklyn Jewish Center in particular has an identical layout. The written evidence consists of an entry in a souvenir journal commemorating the twentieth anniversary of the Flatbush Jewish Center, stating that Abramson drew East Midwood's plans. The NRHP nomination form speculates that Abramson drew the basic plans for the East Midwood Center, and that the <b>Building</b> <b>Committee</b> completed them, in order to save money.|$|E

During early February 1912, the <b>building</b> <b>committee</b> visited various banks seeking a loan for building the new church and soon found no banks in the city would offer them a loan. This delayed construction and also caused frequent changes in the original plans in order to cut cost.
