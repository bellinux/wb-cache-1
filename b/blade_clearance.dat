40|$|An {{important}} {{challenge facing}} {{the design of}} turbodynamic ventricular assist devices (VADs) intended for long-term support is the optimization of the flow path geometry to maximize hydraulic performance while minimizing shear-stress-induced hemolysis and thrombosis. For unshrouded centrifugal, mixed-flow and axial-flow blood pumps, the complex flow patterns within the <b>blade</b> tip <b>clearance</b> between the lengthwise upper surface of the rotating impeller blades and the stationary pump housing have a dramatic effect on both the hydrodynamic performance and the blood damage production. Detailed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses were performed in this study to investigate such flow behavior in <b>blade</b> tip <b>clearance</b> region for a centrifugal blood pump representing a scaled-up version of a prototype pediatric VAD. Nominal flow conditions were analyzed at a flow rate of 2. 5 L/min and rotor speed of 3000 rpm with three <b>blade</b> tip <b>clearances</b> of 50, 100, and 200 microm.

For this reason, using bladed, high-speed mixers is frequently considered a good solution by many types of industry.

40|$|The {{ability to}} monitor the {{structural}} health of the rotating components, especially in the hot sections of turbine engines, is of major interest to aero community in improving engine safety and reliability. The use of instrumentation for these applications remains very challenging.

The aim is to validate the OpenFOAM results for cases that have also been computed with other CFD codes, as well as have been experimentally investigated.

40|$|Long-term rotary left {{ventricular}} assist devices (LVADs) are increasingly employed to bridge patients with end-stage heart failure to transplant or as a destination therapy. Significant recent device development has increased patient support times, shifting further development focus toward physiologically sensitive {{control of the}} pump operation. Sensorless control of these devices would benefit from increased observability of the ventricular volume/preload to the pump, in order to regulate flow based on preload, imitating the native Frank-Starling flow control. Monitoring the transmitted flow pulse through the pump {{has been used as}} a surrogate for preload, although means of maximizing its transmission are not clear. However, it is known that a flat hydraulic performance curve of the rotary pump induces high changes in flow for a given change in pressure head. The aim of this study was to determine geometric pump parameters responsible for increasing this flow pulse transmission and to demonstrate this increase in vitro. The sensitivity of the performance gradient to blade angles, blade heights, <b>blade</b> <b>clearance,</b> and channel areas were studied. Resulting pressure head, flow, and hydraulic efficiency were analyzed with respect to textbook designed procedures. Then pumps with comparably “flat” and “steep” performance curves were used to simulate LVAD support in vitro over a range of pump flow rates to observe the transmitted flow pulsatility. It was found that an outlet blade angle of 90 °, inlet blade angle between 25 and 45 °, and large throat area generated a “flatter” performance curve. The transmitted flow pulsatility through a pump with a flat performance curve was 68 % higher than that of a steep performance curve at a flow rate of 5 L/min. Substantial gains in the observability of LVAD preload/ resident blood volume in the ventricle exist through the careful selection of specific pump geometries...|$|E
40|$|Particle mixing is a unit {{operation}} in many industrial {{applications such as}} pharmaceutical and chemical engineering processes. However, {{there is a lack}} of fundamental understanding of these operations due to difficulties in describing particle behaviour by governing equations. Thus, most manufacturers depend on trial-and-error efforts to design mixers that suite a certain operation. Here, a vertically-shafted cylindrical mixer is chosen as the subject of study. The method to be used for analysing particle behaviour in the mixer is the numerical simulations of particles, and is based on the Discrete Element Method (DEM). Previously, results obtained by simulations have been validated to some degree against the experimental results obtained by Positron-Emitting-Particle-Tracking (PEPT) method. Therefore, an extended version of the same software code is used here to further investigate mixing behaviour of spherical particles in the vertically-shafted cylindrical mixer. Mixing behaviour of such a mixer is generally known to be affected by many variables. The variables considered here are of three types: operational variables, design variables and properties of mixtures. The operational variables considered are blade speed and loading pattern; design variables are rake angle and blade clearance; and properties of the mixtures are volume fraction, size ratio and density ratio. In the first stage of the study, mixture quality is assessed by a conventional mixing index known as Lacey&# 146;s index to quantify effects of blade speed, <b>blade</b> <b>clearance</b> and rake angle. Such indexes are obtained by statistical analysis based on sampling methods, which suffer from uncertainties in the size and number of samples. Although, such issues are known for many decades, little has been done to address the issue. To address this issue, in the second stage of the study, a novel method is developed and used to evaluate the quality of mixtures at the particle-scale. In this method, mixture quality is defined as the variance of the particle fraction at the particle scale, and is obtained by using coordination number information, thus linking the mixture quality to the particle structure. It now depends on the particle contact condition, which is handled by specifying a maximum clearance between two particles. This particle-scale index is compared against two more methods of assessments: conventional mixing index and coordination number. In the third stage, a simple blade-particle system is considered, where a blade is dragged horizontally through a particle bed. Here, the possibility of creating dynamically similar systems is investigated. In addition, the simple system is used to model the mixing behaviour in the vertically-shafted cylindrical mixer. If proven effective, the simple system offers an easy solution for analysis of complex blade-particle systems. Both these methods are import to address scale-up issues. In the final stage, mixing of fine particles in a cylindrical mixer is considered by introducing a cohesive force on pairs of contacting particles. Cohesive force is implemented by van der Waals force, which depends on the material-dependent Hamaker constant Ha. The cohesive force is artificially varied by varying Ha to investigate effect of particle size on mixing. A higher Ha value indicates a larger cohesive force or a smaller particle diameter, and vice versa. Results show that small rake angles are suitable for mixing of cohesive particles...|$|E

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} experimental {{campaign has}} been carried out on two highhead, mixed-flow unshrouded inducers with tapered-hub and variable-pitch. Both the pumps, called DAPAMITO inducers, have been designed by means of a reduced order model and procedure reported in this thesis. The model is based on the incompressible, inviscid, irrotational flow approximation, where the 3 D velocity field inside the blade channels is expressed as the superposition of a fully-guided axisymmetric flow with radially uniform axial velocity and a 2 D cross-sectional vorticity correction. Boundary layer blockage is estimated by means of a suitable redefinition of the diffusion factor for bladings with non-negligible radial flow and Carter's rule is used to account for flow deviation at the inducer trailing edge. Performance losses are evaluated by adding suitably adapted correlations of turbulent duct losses to the inlet flow incidence losses. The noncavitating performance of the inducers has been investigated at different clearance and temperature. The close matching between the experimental data in cold water and the predicted performance has confirmed both the predictive capability of the reduced order model and the high-head nature of the DAPAMITO inducers. The suction performance of the inducers have been investigated at design and off-design conditions both at high and low clearance in cold and hot water. Several cavitation-induced instabilities has been detected and identified on the DAPAMITO inducers. The experimental evidence suggests that the occurrence of the synchronous rotating cavitation can be associated to a strong performance degradation. Furthermore, the comparison between the results at low and high clearance clearly highlights that a high value of the clearance tends to suppress the rotating instabilities, whereas it seems that axial phenomena are not affected, or at least less affected, by the tip <b>blade</b> <b>clearance.</b> The semi-empirical method proposed by Ruggeri and Moore for scaling the thermal cavitation effects has been successfully applied and, consequently, a further validation of this method has been provided. A new typology of cavitation thermal effects has been identified in the influence of the temperature on the intensity of the performance degradation associated to the attached cavitation instability. In this case the inhibition of the bubble growth due to thermal effects can be detected by the reduction of the performance degradation usually associated to this type of instability. The tests carried out on whirling inducers has investigated the roles of the flow coefficient, cavitation number, liquid temperature and of the imposed whirl motion of the rotor. The spectra, especially the continuous ones obtained by means of a novel data reduction procedure, of the rotordynamic forces measured at several flow coefficients in noncavitating regime clearly show the same qualitative behavior for both the inducers. The occurrence of large destabilizing peaks confirms that the conventional approach which uses the stiffness, damping and inertia matrices is clearly not able to characterize rotordynamic forces on noncavitating/cavitating inducers. For positive whirl frequency ratio, the continuous spectra of the module of the rotordynamic force clearly show a minimum that corresponds to a negligible intensity of the force and a maximum associated to the beginning of a destabilizing range. The intensity of the flow reversal and the magnitude of rotation in the tip clearance flow and backflow affect the strength of the rotordynamic force and the location of the minimum and maximum with respect to the whirl frequency ratio. The experimental results have confirmed that the cavitation has a dramatically clear destabilizing effect on the rotordynamic forces. Under cavitating regime, the minimum usually happens at the same value of the whirl ratio of noncavitating condition while, in general, the maximum is anticipated and its intensity is higher. For negative whirl ratio, the cavitation tends to reduce the stabilizing range to a small interval next to zero. Based on the available experimental evidence, the novel data reduction procedure capable of obtain a continuous spectrum of fluid-induced rotordynamic forces can be very useful to catch the unlikely foreseeable complexity of the rotordynamic forces and their consequences on stability of axial flow inducers. Finally, a brief overview of the laws of similarity in pumps has been provided. The second part of the thesis reports the results of a further research activity carried out during the years of the Ph. D. course. The research deals with a comprehensive experimental campaign on three hydrogen peroxide monopropellant thruster prototypes performed in order to characterize the decomposition capabilities of seven different platinum catalysts on alumina carriers for the decomposition of high grade hydrogen peroxide...|$|E

While no single project possessed all of the attributes desired, it was concluded that the main unit turbines at Shasta hydroelectric plant offered the best chance to show the effects of increased <b>blade</b> <b>clearances</b> and slower runner speed on fish survival...|$|R
