Various flash vapour recovery options have been evaluated for operability, maintainability and cost effectiveness. The design considerations for the blow-down vessel and the valve and piping configuration, which resulted from a Hazop Study, are explained. The recovery of 1. 6 tons per hour of boiler blowdown flash equates to R 260 000 per annum in coal savings...|$|E
40|$|Natural gas and {{electricity}} are expensive {{to the extent}} that annual fuel and power costs can approach the initial cost of an industrial boiler plant. Within this context, this paper examines several cost-effective efficiency advancements that were implemented during a recently completed boiler plant replacement project at a large semiconductor manufacturing complex. The "new" boiler plant began service in November, 1996 and consists of four 75, 000 lb/hr water-tube boilers burning natural gas and producing 210 psig saturated steam for heating and humidification. Efficiency advancements include: 1) Reheating of cleanroom make-up air with heat extracted during precooling. 2) Preheating of combustion air with heat extracted from boiler flue gas. 3) Preheating of boiler feedwater with heat extracted from the exhaust of a nearby gas turbine. 4) Variable speed operation of boiler feedwater pumps and forced-draft fans. 5) Preheating of boiler make-up water with heat extracted from <b>boiler</b> <b>blow-down.</b> These efficiency advancements should prove of interest to industrial energy users faced with replacement of aging, inefficient boiler plants, rising fuel and power prices, and increasing pressures to reduce operating costs in order to enhance competitiveness...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} several cost-effective steam {{conservation and}} boiler plant efficiency advancements that were implemented during a recently completed central steam boiler plant replacement project {{at a very}} large semiconductor manufacturing complex. The measures include: 1) Reheating of dehumidified cleanroom make-up air with heat extracted during precooling. 2) Preheating of deionization feedwater with refrigerant heat of condensation. 3) Preheating of boiler combustion air with heat extracted from boiler flue gas. 4) Preheating of boiler feedwater with heat extracted from gas turbine exhaust. 5) Variable speed operation of boiler feedwater pumps and forced-draft fans. 6) Preheating of boiler make-up water with heat extracted from <b>boiler</b> surface <b>blow-down.</b> The first two advancements (steam conservation measures) reduced the amount of steam produced by about 25 % and saved about $ 1, 010, 000 /yr by using recovered waste heat rather than steam-derived heat at selected heating loads. The last four advancements (boiler plant efficiency measures) reduced the unit cost of steam produced by about 13 % and saved about $ 293, 500 /yr by reducing natural gas and electricity usage at the steam boiler plant. The combined result was a 35 % reduction in annual steam costs (fuel and power) ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} paper the work {{performed}} to validate the ENEL/EDF ECART code {{on the base of}} a series of experimental tests performed in the Japanese ICE facility is presented. This activity has been carried out in the general framework of the validation phase of the ECART code, initially developed for integrated analysis of severe accidents in LWRs, for its application on incidental sequences related to fusion plants. The ICE facility consists of the cylindrical vacuum vessel, at horizontal axis (900. mm of external diameter and 600. mm length), the <b>boiler,</b> the <b>blow-down</b> tank and the corresponding piping and valves. The vessel has heat plates to maintain the required wall temperatures and initially contains dry air at a sub-atmospheric pressure of about 100. Pa. The employed ECART code full-couples the aerosol-vapour transport phenomena with thermal-hydraulics and chemical equilibrium. For the present work purposes, due to the ICE tests characteristics, only the thermal-hydraulic code section was activated and the dry aerosol or the chemical equilibrium modules were not employed. Two different conclusions have been highlighted by the work. The first one, being the main goal of the work, is related to the assessment of the ECART code in experimental conditions relevant for the future fusion reactors, against the traditional LWRs assessment previously performed for this code. The second one is related to the evaluation of the ICE experimental tests...|$|R
40|$|Our goal in {{this study}} is to utilize novel anionic clay sorbents for {{treating}} and reclaiming/reusing power-plant effluents, in particular, <b>boiler</b> <b>blow-down</b> waters containing heavy metals, such as As and Se. Developing and using novel materials for such application is dictated by the challenge posed by reclaiming and recycling these too-clean-to-clean effluent streams, generated during electricity production, whose contaminant levels are in the ppm/ppb (or even less) trace levels. During the study model blow-down streams have been treated in batch experiments. Adsorption isotherms as a function of pH/temperature have been established for both As and Se. Adsorption rates have also measured as a function of concentration, temperature, pH, and space time. For both the equilibrium and rate measurements, we have studied the As/Se interaction, and competition from background anions. A homogeneous surface diffusion model is used to describe the experimental kinetic data. The estimated diffusivity values are shown to depend on the particle size. On the other hand, a model taking into account the polycrystalline nature of these adsorbent particles, and the presence of an intercrystallite porous region predicts correctly that the surface diffusivity is particle size independent. A mathematical model to describe flow experiments in packed-beds has also been developed during phase I of this project. The goal is to validate this model with flow experiments in packed-beds during the phase II of this project, to determine the adsorption capacity under flow conditions, and to compare it with the capacity estimated from the adsorption isotherms determined from the batch studies...|$|E
