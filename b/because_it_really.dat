25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} by some that {{this is perhaps the}} most interesting of all the series events, including the race itself. In this event there are heats of 5–8 riders, depending on the number of riders signed up for the day. These heats are seeded according to the results of each rider's ITT. Riders are placed along the starting line in order from fastest (on the inside) to slowest (on the outside) and are then given one lap to get the position they want in the pack and to gain some speed. Once they cross the start/finish line again, the race begins. The riders race around the track and every time the pack crosses the start/finish line, the last one to cross is out and must leave the track. Riders keep racing until there are only three riders left. These three riders {{move on to the next}} round. This process continues until the final heat of 8. In this heat, riders continue to race and get out until you have the last three and then they commence a one lap full out sprint and the first, second, and third-place winners are determined by the order in which the riders cross the start/finish line. This is a great event <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> measures the skill of a rider, because in order to win, a rider must be more than just fast. If a rider hopes to win, she must also have good drafting skills, the ability to find good positioning, the intuition to know when to get out of the pack and sprint around the outside, and the endurance to be able to do this all day.|$|E

One person replied [...] "Oh, that's Worcester's monument to bestiality." [...] Wilson said the sculpture is intended to portray [...] "innocence, joy, and rebirth," [...] and that historically Charles Y. Harvey came from an artistic tradition in which [...] "the human figure is the apex of beauty, and how well you can capture that is the demonstration of your artistic talents." [...] Regarding the artistic merit of the work, Wilson said: [...] "It's unfortunate, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> does look like something untoward is going on." ...|$|E
500|$|The Margaritaville blender itself {{served as}} a metaphor for {{consumerism}} and the tendency of Americans to buy luxuries that they do not need. Stone said, [...] "We didn't want to make an episode where it was like, 'Oh, those Wall Street guys took our money.' It {{was one of those things}} where we all screwed up and nobody really knows what's going on, but it has something to do with buying shit like Margaritavilles." [...] The Margaritaville also serves {{as a metaphor for}} the housing bubble. Parker himself actually owns a Margaritaville, of which he said, [...] "It's pretty stupid <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> is just a blender".|$|E

500|$|The episode {{helped to}} {{elaborate}} the backstory of The Smoking Man, the series' chief antagonist. William B. Davis, {{the actor who}} played the character, later noted, [...] "As the story developed, we developed a relationship between Cigarette-Smoking Man and Mulder's apparent father, and Cigarette-Smoking Man and Mulder's mother; then we started backfilling with an historical connection." [...] Carter explained that the episode {{was the start of}} the series' greater conspiracy: [...] "It's an interesting development <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> was the development of the conspiracy. The elements of the conspiracy were part of his development. But [...] back story, of course, intertwined with Mulder's." [...] Actor Chris Owens reprised his role as The Smoking Man; he had previously played him in the season's earlier episode [...] "Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} based on actual recent {{research}} and involved much collaboration among the series' different departments. For the scene in which they remove the victim's eyeball, the special effects crew created a mold based on actress Elizabeth Stanley's head. Using plaster to make a prosthetic, they [...] "drilled out the eyeball and sculpt it open and [...] {{through a series of}} molds." [...] Stanley stated that [...] "it's really cool to see the head <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> does look just like me, even though it's very gruesome because the eyeball's popping out." [...] The prop department rigged a weapon which they called a [...] "photon gun"; according to prop master Peter Gelfman, this gun {{was based on}} real devices employed in airport security that look through people's clothing for concealed weapons. VFX Supervisor Christopher Scollard explained that for the eye's last vision, they used [...] "a lot of actual photographic reference on the set and on the location," [...] which they then used to [...] "take that imagery and composite it into the various computer monitors and displays in the lab." ...|$|E
500|$|... "More than a Woman" [...] and [...] "I Care 4 U" [...] were {{released}} as posthumous singles and peaked within the top 25 of the Billboard Hot 100.

[...] "More than a Woman" [...] reached {{number one on the}} UK singles chart making Aaliyah the first female deceased artist to reach number one on the UK singles chart. [...] "More than a Woman" [...] was replaced by George Harrison's [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] which is the only time in the UK singles chart's history where a dead artist has replaced another dead artist at number one. In July 2001, she allowed MTV's show Diary behind-the-scenes access to her life and stated [...] "I am truly blessed to wake up every morning to do something that I love; there is nothing better than that." [...] She continued, [...] "Everything is worth it – the hard work, the times when you're tired, the times when you are a bit sad. In the end, it's all worth it <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> makes me happy. I wouldn't trade it for anything else in the world.

5000|$|One {{can get a}} {{good sense}} of the {{difference}} between classical and non-classical harmony from looking at how they deal with dissonances. Classical treats all notes that don't belong to the chord (i.e., the triad) as potential dissonances to be resolved. ... Non-classical harmony just tells you which note in the scale to avoid is sometimes called an avoid-note" [...] (<b>because</b> <b>it's</b> <b>really</b> dissonant), meaning that all the others are okay.|$|R
500|$|Fraser McAlpine of the BBC stated, [...] "'Love Story' is a {{stunning}} pop song and, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> does tell a love story, it's heart-warming and draws the listener into the exciting and romantic fairytale world." [...] However, she felt Swift's vocal performance was not incredible, but was passionate {{to complement the}} song's sentiments. McAlpine resumed by stating that [...] "Love Story", although obvious, a bit dramatic, and probably targeted towards younger audiences, was just lovely and that Swift proved herself a true princess of pop with the song. Chris Neal of Country Weekly called [...] "Love Story" [...] an [...] "ebullient first hit." [...] Deborah Evans Price of Billboard magazine gave the single a favorable review and called it an [...] "enchanting offering". Price noted that [...] "Love Story" [...] demonstrates one of Swift's appeals, her writing and singing of age-appropriate material that can be both relatable to her audience and others. As a result, she predicted the song would have much commercial success in the country music industry. Alex Macpherson of British newspaper The Guardian described the song to be fueled by a [...] "joyous rush" [...] that, according to him, was later replicated by Swift's own single [...] "Mine" [...] (2010). Taste of Country listed the song at number 17 on its list of greatest country songs of all time.|$|E
500|$|Many {{of these}} films feature her in roles as distressed women, and often showed Baker in nude scenes, which few major Hollywood actors were willing {{to do at the}} time. Baker became a {{favorite}} of Umberto Lenzi, with her best-known role being in the aforementioned Paranoia, where she played a wealthy widow tormented by two sadistic siblings. In his review of Paranoia, Roger Ebert said: [...] "Carroll Baker, who was a Hollywood sex symbol (for some, it is said) until she sued Joe Levine and got blacklisted, has been around. She may not be an actress, but she can act. In The Carpetbaggers, there was a nice wholesome vulgarity to her performance. She is not intrinsically as bad as she appears in Paranoia. I think maybe she was saying the hell with it and having a good time." [...] As with Paranoia, the majority of the films she made in Italy received poor critical reception in the United States, though they afforded Baker—who had left Hollywood in debt and with two children to support— an income, as well as fame abroad. In retrospect, Baker commented on her career in Italy and on her exploitation film roles, saying: [...] "I think I made more films [...] than I made in Hollywood, but the mentality is different. What they think is wonderful is not what we might... it was marvelous for me <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> brought me back to life, and it gave me a whole new outlook. It's wonderful to know about a different world." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to [...] "protective and {{occasionally}} nervous" [...] fans, Kripke meant for Bela {{to be introduced}} in [...] "small doses". He wanted fans to know the show would always be just about Sam and Dean Winchester, and stated, [...] " [...] there for important plot elements, but it's not the Ruby and Bela show, nor {{is it about the}} four of them cruising around in the Impala together. It's about the guys." [...] However, he felt the writers pushed it too far in the episode [...] "Red Sky at Morning", stating his opinion that it [...] "was by far the least successful episode this year <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> kind of became the Bela show". The writers also did not take the time to consider how to tie her into the Winchesters' storylines. As Kripke pointed out, [...] "It's a road show and we're in a different town every week, so if you're going to run into the same character over and over again, you better have a damn good reason..." [...] They were eventually [...] "crushed {{under the weight of the}} absurdity of it" [...] because it became more difficult to justify her reappearances within the narrative. Another key problem stemmed from their conceptualization of her as an antagonistic character rather than a potential love interest for the brothers. The writers, [...] "so taken with a woman who could screw the boys over at every turn", ended up making Bela too antagonistic without establishing a balance. Any chance for a [...] "funny effervescent episode where they all work together" [...] was lost after the character attempts to have the Winchesters killed on multiple occasions. They eventually decided to drop the character from the series, opting to [...] "send her off in an appropriate and dramatic way" [...] which would [...] "show a couple of cards [...] been holding onto all season" [...] by revealing her backstory [...] "in a way that will surprise the audience and kind of tie her into the story." ...|$|E
5000|$|Middlebrook {{was noted}} for her {{openness}} and honest, sometimes [...] "brutal" [...] biographical writing. [...] "The more {{that each of}} us knows about each of the other human beings in the world, the better off we are. It’s true that it is very painful to be exposed to people’s curiosity. But it’s painful in a way that can only lead to self-knowledge, <b>because</b> <b>it’s</b> <b>really</b> not a big deal. In the scope of human endeavor, it’s not a big deal." ...|$|R

2500|$|Subsequent to {{the band}} {{recording}} the instrumental album, {{it was announced that}} Rossetti had recently recovered from a disorder affecting his voice and would indeed contribute vocals to Pelagial. [...] Some editions of the album include a second disc featuring the all-instrumental version of Pelagial with an alternate mix. Guitarist Jona Nido later explained the band's reversal: [...] "Loïc is the frontman of this band and we all felt that The Ocean and this album needed him... I'm glad we decided to record vocals in the end, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> adds a new dimension to the album that was not there before." [...] Staps later said that Rossetti's vocal health was [...] "part of the reason we decided to have it instrumental originally". [...] He confirmed that part of the logic for releasing both the vocal and instrumental versions of the album was that the band can shift to an instrumental configuration for live performances if Rossetti's health problems return.|$|E
5000|$|Synyster Gates stated of the album: [...] "I {{think our}} songwriting has {{improved}} {{by leaps and}} bounds. Sonically, this record is our biggest record by fucking far.

We had to restrain ourselves from doing that just to keep it more badass and just more straightforward rock." ...|$|R

I just want to warn all the young people. Be careful <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> does change your life." [...] The role has also garnered Palmer nominations as [...] "Most Popular Actress" [...] at the 1996 National Television Awards, [...] "Best Actress" [...] at the 1999 British Soap Awards, [...] "TV Soap Personality" [...] at the 2009 Television and Radio Industries Club Awards, [...] "Best On-Screen Partnership" [...] (with Sid Owen) in the 2001 British Soap Awards, and [...] "I'm a Survivor" [...] at the 2009 All About Soap Bubble Awards.|$|E
2500|$|Boll {{does not}} {{shy away from}} his critics.

[...] Referring to House of the Dead, Boll said: [...] "I think I made a perfect House of the Dead movie, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> shows how the game is. It's a lot of fun, it's over-the-top action." [...] Boll is especially critical of his Internet detractors. Referring to two Ain't It Cool News critics who negatively reviewed his work, Boll said, [...] "Harry (Knowles) and Quint (Eric Vespe) are retards." [...] Boll later claimed Knowles was being [...] "played" [...] by film studios that [...] "kissed his ass" [...] with set visits and pretend offers to produce large-budget films and suggested to Knowles the reason he did not like him was because, [...] "I never kissed your ass, Harry." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{first show}} in Rhode Island {{will always be}} remembered for its {{extended}} jams (even [...] "Birds of a Feather" [...] clocked in at 15 minutes).

That this is so, seems to me to demonstrate the truth of the Fall of Man from the condition of moral very-goodness in God's sight. And I think that Dante connected the purifying pains of his intermediate state with actual sufferings in this life, working out repentance,--in himself and others. And the 'torment' of this passion, to the repentant or resisting, or purity-seeking soul is decidedly like the pain of physical burning.|$|E
