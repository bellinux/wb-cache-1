These salts cause damage to property, affect plant communities in the wetlands, and contribute to salinity in the Colorado River System. To {{gain a better understanding of}} these salts, two soil profiles were described. Whole soil samples were analyzed for ammonium acetate–extractable and water-soluble elemental analyses, cation exchange capacity (CEC), pH, electrical conductivity, and particle size. Salt minerals were analyzed using scanning electron microscope (SEM) /energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) and x-ray diffraction (XRD). Results of XRD analyses indicate hexahydrite, <b>bloedite,</b> mirabilite, gypsum, thenar-dite, halite, vivianite, and sepiolite. SEM/EDS analyses found <b>bloedite,</b> eugsterite, halite, hexahydrite, gypsum, thenardite, and possibly kainite. Gypsum occurs at the surface and in all subsurface horizons. The more soluble salts occur at the surface and in two subsurface horizons. This study documents the third occurrence of eugsterite in the USA and is the first study to document salts other than gypsum forming snowball morphology. We interpret the subsurface zones of soluble salts to represent relict water tables where capillary action, combined with subsurface evaporation, has concentrated Na-Mg sul-fates and halite.

Due {{to the fact that}} there are no important surface water bodies present in this sabkha, transport of solutes is dominated by advection rather than mixing in lakes. For our study we used both analytical conservative and numerical reactive transport models. Results showed that salinity varies with distance and may reach very high levels near a watershed where the groundwater flux is zero. As a consequence, reactive transport simulations results showed that more minerals precipitate and water activity decreases values near this watershed. Model results also showed that a sequence of precipitating minerals could be deduced after 140, 000 years. From the boundary of the sabkha towards the watershed the mineral sequence was dolomite, gypsum, magnesite, <b>bloedite,</b> halite and mirabilite.

The efflorescences commonly occur as powdery or cemented salt precipitates at seepage points {{at the base of the}} slag dump and as solid aggregates in protected overhangs facing the Tinto river. The mineral salt types include Ca and Mg sulfates (gypsum, epsomite, hexahydrite, <b>bloedite)</b> as well as mixed Fe 2 + – Fe 3 + hydrated sulfates (copiapite, roemerite). The salt mixtures have variable metal concentrations, including major (> 1 wt %) concentrations of Zn, minor Cu (> 1000 ppm), sub-minor (100 – 1000 ppm) to traces (< 100 ppm) of As and Co as well as traces (< 100 ppm) of Ag, Bi, Cd, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Sn, Tl and W. Copiapite-rich samples exhibit the highest As, Cd and Cu, epsomite–hexahydrite rich samples have the highest Zn, and the gypsum-rich samples show the lowest metal and metalloid concentrations. Dissolution experiments show that all salt mixtures are acid generating due to Fe and Al hydrolysis and resultant pH decrease in the solution. Thus, weathering and leaching of metalliferous smelting slags are accompanied by the mobilisation of metals, metalloids, alkali earth elements and sulfate into pore and seepage waters. Evaporation of seepage waters emanating from the slag dump causes the precipitation of mobilised elements and compounds and leads to their temporary fixation in secondary soluble minerals. Dissolution of the efflorescences during the next rainfall and flushing event and associated Al 3 + and Fe 3 + hydrolysis contribute to the acidification and metal and sulfate contamination of Río Tinto waters...|$|E
40|$|Melt {{inclusions}} {{were studied}} in chrome diopside from the Inagli deposit of gemstones in the Inagli massif of alkaline ultrabasic rocks of potassic affinity {{in the northwestern}} Aldan shield, Yakutia, Russia. The chrome diopside is highly transparent and has an intense green color. Its Cr 2 O 3 content varies from 0. 13 to 0. 75 wt %. Primary and primary–secondary polyphase inclusions in chrome diopside are dominated by crystal phases (80 – 90 vol %) and contain aqueous solution and a gas phase. Using electron microprobe analysis and Raman spectroscopy, the following crystalline phases were identified. Silicate minerals are represented by potassium feldspar, pectolite [NaCa 2 Si 3 O 8 (OH) ], and phlogopite. The most abundant minerals {{in the majority of}} inclusions are sulfates: glaserite (aphthitalite) [K 3 Na(SO 4) 2], glauberite [Na 2 Ca(SO 4) 2], aluminum sulfate, anhydrite (CaSO 4), gypsum (CaSO 4 * 2 H 2 O), barite (BaSO 4), <b>bloedite</b> [Na 2 Mg(SO 4) 2 * 4 H 2 O], thenardite (Na 2 SO 4), polyhalite [K 2 Ca 2 Mg(SO 4) 4 * 2 H 2 O], arcanite (K 2 SO 4), and celestite (SrSO 4). In addition, apatite was detected in some inclusions. Chlorides are probably present among small crystalline phases, because some analyses of aggregates of silicate and sulfate minerals showed up to 0. 19 – 10. 3 wt % Cl. Hydrogen was identified in the gas phase of polyphase inclusions by Raman spectroscopy. The composition of melt from which the chrome diopside crystallized was calculated {{on the basis of the}} investigation of silicate melt inclusions. This melt contains 53. 5 wt % SiO 2, considerable amounts of CaO (16. 3 wt %), K 2 O (7. 9 wt %), Na 2 O (3. 5 wt %), and SO 3 (1. 4 wt %) and moderate amounts of Al 2 O 3 (7. 5 wt %), MgO (5. 8 wt %), FeO (1. 1 wt %), and H 2 O (0. 75 wt %). The content of Cr 2 O 3 in the melt was 0. 13 wt %. Many inclusions were homogenized at 770 - 850 oC, when all of the crystals and the gas phase were dissolved. The material of inclusions heated up to the homogenization temperature became heterogeneous even during very fast quenching (two seconds) producing numerous small crystals. This fact implies that most of the inclusions contained a salt (rather than silicate) melt of sulfate-dominated composition. Such inclusions were formed from salt globules (with a density of about 2. 5 g/cm 3) occurring as an emulsion in the denser (2. 6 g/cm 3) silicate melt from which the chrome diopside crystallized...|$|E
40|$|Salts are {{widespread}} in the cold, arid McMurdo region of Antarctica. They exist {{in a variety of}} deposit types from massive subglacial and sub-lake deposits containing up to 1010 kilograms of salt, down to traces in soil, snow and ice. However, deposits on rock and soil typically amount to a few grams of salt. At least 30 salt phases are known but only 10 of these are widespread. These 10 are thenardite, gypsum, halite, calcite, darapskite, soda nitre, mirabilite, <b>bloedite,</b> epsomite and hexahydrite. The distribution of salts has been examined on two scales, local and regional. The local scale extends from individual deposits to areas of a few square kilometres. The regional scale covers McMurdo oasis, McMurdo Sound and Ross Island, though areas in McMurdo oasis, and particularly Taylor Valley receive most attention. Local distribution is controlled by salt migration and separation. Migration is induced by water and wind, with soil brines moving as thin liquid films, by capillarity and under the influence of gravity. Deflation and asymmetric salt accumulation provide evidence that wind is important. Separation of phases is a consequence of different physico-chemical properties of salts, and environmental conditions, including site aspect, ambient temperature and humidity. Eutectic temperature is a fundamental salt property but solubility is also important. Several salt deposits containing separated (fractionated) phases have been found in the region. Separation is achieved mainly by fractional dissolution and crystallization and the most evolved product of the general separation sequence is calcium chloride. The separation processes, together with salt migration, obscure the sources of the salts. Regional distribution of salts has been characterized by determining the relative frequency at which specific phases are encountered at increasing distance from the coast and above sea level. Chloride and sodium phases decrease, whereas magnesium phases increase in frequency away from the coast. Sulphates-to-chloride and nitrates-to-chloride ratios increase with increasing distance. Calcium and carbonate show little change except in Taylor Valley where a marked decrease is apparent. This regional distribution is mainly dependent on the sources of the salts. The marine source is most important, contributing almost all of the chloride, sodium, sulphate and probably nitrate ions that are present. Chemical weathering is the predominant source of magnesium, calcium and carbonate ions probably via reactions of mafic, ferromagnesian minerals in local rocks and regolith. Biological and volcanic activity are locally significant at eastern Taylor Valley and in the summit area of Erebus Volcano, respectively. The salts have accumulated over the lifetime of the region, that is over less than the last 20 - 25 Ma or so. There is no evidence that they are relics from earlier, preglacial times, except for very minor amounts of gypsum and calcium carbonate. There has been a recent influx of sea water into Taylor Valley perhaps between 50, 000 and 20, 000 years ago, and evaporation of this water has preceded advance of Taylor Glacier over part of the resulting salt deposit. The continuing interaction between glacier and salt is causing basal ice to melt and producing aperiodic discharges of up to a few thousand cubic metres of salty water from the terminus of the glacier...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In {{much of the}} {{northern}} Great Plains, saline and hypersaline lacustrine brines are the only surface waters present. As a group, the lakes of this region are unique: {{there is no other}} area in the world that can match the concentration and diversity of saline lake environments exhibited in the prairie region of Canada and northern United States. The immense number of individual salt lakes and saline wetlands in this region of North America is staggering. Estimates vary from about one million to greater than 10 million, with densities in some areas being as high as 120 lakes/km 2. Despite over a century of scientific investigation of these salt lakes, we have only in the last twenty years advanced far enough to appreciate the wide spectrum of lake types, water chemistries, and limnological processes that are operating in the modern settings. Hydrochemical data are available for about 800 of the lake brines in the region. Composition, textural, and geochemical information on the modern bottom sediments has been collected for just over 150 of these lakes. Characterization of the biological and ecological features of these lakes is based on even fewer investigations, and the stratigraphic records of only twenty basins have been examined. The lake waters show a considerable range in ionic composition and concentration. Early investigators, concentrating on the most saline brines, emphasized a strong predominance of Na + and SO 4 - 2 in the lakes. It is now realized, however, that not only is there a complete spectrum of salinities from less than 1 ppt TDS to nearly 400 ppt, but also virtually every water chemistry type is represented in lakes of the region. With such a vast array of compositions, it is difficult to generalize. Nonetheless, the paucity of Cl-rich lakes makes {{the northern}} Great Plains basins somewhat unusual compared with salt lakes in many other areas of the world (e. g., Australia, western United States). Compilations of the lake water chemistries show distinct spatial trends and regional variations controlled by groundwater input, climate, and geomorphology. Short-term temporal variations in the brine composition, which can have significant effects on the composition of the modern sediments, have also been well documented in several individual basins. From a sedimentological and mineralogical perspective, the wide range of water chemistries exhibited by the lakes leads to an unusually large diversity of modern sediment composition. Over 40 species of endogenic precipitates and authigenic minerals have been identified in the lacustrine sediments. The most common non-detrital components of the modern sediments include: calcium and calcium-magnesium carbonates (magnesian calcite, aragonite, dolomite), and sodium, magnesium, and sodium-magnesium sulfates (mirabilite, thenardite, <b>bloedite,</b> epsomite). Many of the basins whose brines have very high Mg/Ca ratios also have hydromagnesite, magnesite, and nesquehonite. Unlike salt lakes in many other areas of the world, halite, gypsum, and calcite are relatively rare endogenic precipitates in the Great Plains lakes. The detrital fraction of the lacustrine sediments is normally dominated by clay minerals, carbonate minerals, quartz, and feldspars. Sediment accumulation in these salt lakes is controlled and modified by a wide variety of physical, chemical, and biological processes. Although the details of these modern sedimentary processes can be exceedingly complex and difficult to discuss in isolation, in broad terms, the processes operating in the salt lakes of the Great Plains are ultimately controlled by three basic factors or conditions of the basin: (a) basin morphology; (b) basin hydrology; and (c) water salinity and composition. Combinations of these parameters interact to control nearly all aspects of modern sedimentation in these salt lakes and give rise to four 'end member' types of modern saline lacustrine settings in the Great Plains: (a) clastics-dominated playas; (b) salt-dominated playas; (c) deep water, non-stratified lakes; and (d) deep water, "permanently" stratified lakes. </p...|$|E
40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{relation}} between the mineralogical composition of salt assemblages and the composition of groundwaters from which these salts precipitated. A comparison was made between salts and waters sampled in the Konya Basin in Turkey and waters sampled in three different regions in Kenya. The chemical composition of waters from rivers entering the Konya Basin is different from the composition of those from rivers in Kenya. The initial composition of these rivers determines the type of minerals that will precipitate during evaporation of these river waters. The ratio of calcium to carbonate at the moment the solution becomes saturated with respect to calcite, usually the first mineral to precipitate, determines whether the final solution will become carbonate-rich or carbonate-poor. The ratio of magnesium to silica and the ratio of calcium to sulphate at the moment the solution becomes saturated with respect to sepiolite and gypsum respectively, determine the magnesium and sulphate content of the final solution. In this way six different types of concentrated brines originate and six different types of salt assemblages precipitate from these brines during evaporation. The concentrated waters and the salt assemblages in the Konya Basin belong mainly to the Na-Mg-SO 4 -Cl-type. The evolution of the groundwater composition and the type of minerals which precipitated from these groundwaters can be explained by assuming successive precipitation of calcite, sepiolite and gypsum. The concentrated waters and the salt assemblages from Kenya belong mainly to the Na-CO 3 -SO 4 -Cl-type. The behaviour of the dissolved species and the type of salt minerals can be explained by assuming calcite and sepiolite precipitation only. The crystallographic properties of some salt minerals were determined by means of X-ray diffraction analysis and the morphological properties by Scanning Electron Microscopy. The presence of halite causes a salt crust to become dense and sealing. The porosity of a salt crust increases when <b>bloedite</b> or trona is present. Prediction of the sequence of salt minerals which will precipitate from a concentrated solution requires an accurate knowledge of the thermodynamic properties of concentrated electrolyte solutions. Unfortunately, these properties are still unknown for carbonate-rich solutions. Only recently a theory was developed for carbonate-poor solutions. The watersamples were evaporated in the laboratory in evaporating dishes under ambient conditions. The mineralogical composition of the precipitates was compared with the assemblages that occur in the field. The carbonate-containing salt assemblages both from the field and from the laboratory experiments were investigated by means of log PCO 2 - log aH 2 O diagrams. It appeared that neither the field nor the laboratory salt assemblages were in equilibrium with the CO 2 - pressures of the solutions from which they precipitated. These CO 2 -pressures were calculated from the analytical data. The carbonate-free salt assemblages from the Konya Basin were investigated by means of Jänecke-diagrams. For a few selected samples the theoretical mineral sequences were calculated under the assumption of equilibrium precipitation {{with the help of the}} computerprogram of Harvie & Weare (1980). It appeared that prediction of mineral assemblages in salt efflorescences is difficult even with a sound thermodynamic theory. Salt assemblages in natural salt efflorescences could best be predicted assuming precipitation under equilibrium conditions, whereas mineral assemblages in evaporating dishes in the laboratory could best be predicted assuming both metastable mineral formation and fractional crystallization. This conclusion is supported by the presence of the two new minerals, konyaite and eugsterite, which have been discovered in this study. Both are metastable minerals under ambient conditions. The oxygen and hydrogen isotopic composition of some waters from the Konya Basin in Turkey and of the watersamples from the Amboseli Basin in Kenya were determined. The isotope fractionation caused by evaporation is different in groundwater and surface water. Processes of evaporation and water-rock interaction could be distinguished...|$|E
