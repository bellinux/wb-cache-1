50|$|Hankook Tire's {{worldwide}} reputation {{has largely}} grown {{due to its}} radial tire and <b>bias-ply</b> <b>tire</b> production. The company now supplies tires as original equipment to various automakers. In addition to producing about 92 million tires annually, the company also sells batteries, alloy wheels, and brake pads.|$|E
5000|$|Michelin {{developed}} and patented a key innovation in tire history, the 1946 radial tire, and successfully exploited this technological innovation {{to become one}} of the worlds leading tire manufacturers. The radial was initially marketed as the [...] "X" [...] tire. It was developed with the front-wheel-drive Citroën Traction Avant and Citroën 2CV in mind. Michelin had bought the then-bankrupt Citroën in the 1930s. Because of its superiority in handling and fuel economy, use of this tire quickly spread throughout Europe and Asia. In the U.S., the outdated <b>bias-ply</b> <b>tire</b> persisted, with market share of 87% in 1967.|$|E
5000|$|Invented in 1984 by David Allen Dayton. A {{bead breaker}} {{is a tool}} used for {{separating}} tires from rims. The inner-most diameter of the tire that interfaces with a wheel is called the Tire Bead. The tire bead is a thicker section of rubber, and is reinforced with braided steel cable, called the Bead Bundle. [...] The inner-most surface of the tire bead creates the air seal between the tire and rim on a radial-ply tire and a <b>bias-ply</b> <b>tire.</b> Often, the bead can become frozen to the rim after rusting or corrosion occurs, requiring {{the use of a}} bead breaker in order to be removed.|$|E
50|$|Radial tires have {{different}} characteristics of springiness {{from those of}} <b>bias-ply</b> <b>tires,</b> and a different degree of slip while steering. A benefit was that cars could now be made lighter because {{they would not have}} {{to make up for the}} deficiencies of <b>bias-ply</b> <b>tires.</b>|$|R
5000|$|By comparison, radial tires lay all of {{the cord}} plies at 90 degrees to the {{direction}} of travel (that is, across the tire from lip to lip). This design avoids having the plies rub against each other as the tire flexes, reducing the tire's rolling friction. This allows vehicles with radial tires to achieve better fuel economy than with <b>bias-ply</b> <b>tires.</b> It also accounts for the slightly [...] "low on air" [...] (bulging) look that radial tire sidewalls have, especially when compared to <b>bias-ply</b> <b>tires.</b>|$|R
40|$|Radial tractor tires offer {{advantages}} over <b>bias-ply</b> <b>tires</b> that usually result in increased productivity and reduced fuel consumption. The axle power {{developed by a}} tractor is distributed four ways: overcoming rolling resistance, wheel slip losses, tire-soil action and useful drawbar work. The most efficient use of tractor power occurs when the drawbar power is maximized and the first three items are minimized. Radial tractor tires can improve tractive efficiency and extend tire wear. There are benefits and disadvantages of radial tractor <b>tires</b> compared to <b>bias-ply</b> <b>tires.</b> Radial tractor tires {{should be considered as}} original equipment on new tractors and as replacements whenever tractor tires are being replaced...|$|R
5000|$|At the time, the U.S. tire {{industry}} built tires {{based on}} bias ply technology, dating to 1888. In 1946, Michelin developed the radial tire method of construction, which quickly spread in France, Michelin's home country. Because of its superiority in treadlife, handling, safety from blowouts, and fuel economy, {{use of this}} technology quickly spread throughout Europe and Asia. In the U.S., the <b>bias-ply</b> <b>tire</b> construction persisted, caused by tire and automobile manufacturers in America [...] "concerned about transition costs." [...] In 1968, Consumer Reports, an influential American magazine, acknowledged the superiority of radial construction, and in 1971 the Lincoln Continental Mark III became the first American made car with standard OEM radial tires.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to predict deflection () of <b>bias-ply</b> <b>tire</b> based on contact area index (CAI), inflation pressure (P) and vertical load (W). For this purpose, deflection of four bias-ply tires with different contact area index were measured at five levels of inflation pressure and five levels of vertical load. Results of deflection measurement for bias-ply tires No. 1, 2 and 3 were utilized to determine regression model and 2 three-variable linear regression model P = 42. 13 - 0. 00009 CAI- 0. 905 P + 3. 534 W with R = 0. 982 was obtained. Also, results of deflection measurement for <b>bias-ply</b> <b>tire</b> No. 4 were used to verify model. The paired samples t-test results indicated that the deflection values predicted by model were more than the deflection values measured by test apparatus. To check the discrepancies between the deflection values predicted by model with the deflection values measured by test apparatus, RMSE and MRPD were calculated. The amounts of RMSE and MRPD were 5. 8 mm and 16. 3 %, respectively. Rational amounts of RMSE and MRPD confirmed that the three-variable linear regression model may be used to predict deflection of <b>bias-ply</b> <b>tire</b> based on contact area index, inflation pressure and vertical load. On the other hand, to calculate actual deflection values or deflection values measured by test apparatus (M) based on deflection values predicted by model (P) the linear regression 2 model = 0. 654 + 6. 318 with R = 0. 986 can be strongly recommended.

50|$|Radial tires were {{introduced}} to the U.S. market by rivals Goodrich and Michelin in the late 1960s, and Firestone lacked their own radial tire. The first radial tire developed and produced by Firestone was the ill-fated Firestone 500 Radial.

5000|$|... 1999: Goodyear brought tires to Michigan {{designed}} for Fontana for Winston West racing, where Hoosier Tire {{was still a}} presence in competition against Goodyear; the new tire featured greater stagger and handled more like <b>bias-ply</b> <b>tires</b> than radials. Dale Earnhardt grabbed the lead late and got into a spirited battle with Bobby Labonte before Labonte cleared for the win.|$|R
40|$|When Pirelli Co. {{developed}} the first radial tractor tire in 1957, the company claimed it would develop 20 percent greater traction with less slippage at equal load than an equivalent <b>bias-ply</b> <b>tire.</b> (Forrest, et al. 1962) Subsequent research has confirmed that radial tires {{have the advantage}} in tractive efficiency. H. Erdal Ozkan, state extension specialist at Ohio State University, has reviewed all available research results related to field performance of tractors equipped with radial and bias ply tires...|$|E

The standard Monte Carlo with manual transmission, retained [...] "traditional" [...] steering and <b>bias-ply</b> <b>tires,</b> but the radial-tuned system was included when the automatic transmission was ordered, earning the Monte Carlo S label.|$|R
25|$|CART {{officials}} {{held out}} the possibility of rescheduling the race, but there was no room in the schedule and it was ultimately canceled. The race marked the first time a CART race had been canceled outright due to driver safety issues. The 1985 Michigan 500 was postponed six days due to concerns about Goodyear's new radial tire. After three major crashes, drivers refused to participate, and the race was run the following weekend with the old <b>bias-ply</b> <b>tires.</b>|$|R
25|$|Redline <b>bias-ply</b> <b>tires</b> {{continued}} as standard equipment on the 1968 GTO, {{though they could}} be replaced by whitewall tires at no extra cost. A new option was radial tires for improved ride and handling. However, very few were delivered with the radial tires because of manufacturing problems encountered by supplier B.F. Goodrich. The radial tire option was discontinued after 1968. Pontiac did not offer radial tires as a factory option on the GTO again until the 1974 model.|$|R

50|$|Starting in 1988, {{teams were}} allowed to have six crew members over the wall during a pit stop. The crews would consist of four tire changers, a fueler, and a fuel vent/airhose man. Previously they were only allowed five (i.e., three tire changers). This was {{due in part to}} the fact that after the series changed from <b>bias-ply</b> <b>tires</b> to radials, the left-front tire (which at the time was seldom changed) would now be changed much more frequently.|$|R
5000|$|The {{origin of}} the {{movement}} itself is a little easier to pin down. In 1987, after many decades of building hot rods and customs, Jim [...] "Jake" [...] Jacobs gathered spare parts from his amassed personal stash and put together a ’28 Ford Phaeton in 28 days. It sported no fenders, wide-white <b>bias-ply</b> <b>tires,</b> a rusty Model A body on ’32 Ford frame rails, a chopped windshield and a shortened deuce grille shell with a small-block Chevy 350 and a ’39 Ford 3-speed.|$|R
50|$|Petty co-crew chiefs Robin Pemberton and Larry Pollard {{stated that}} during the last pit stop of the race they put softer {{compound}} <b>bias-ply</b> <b>tires</b> designed for {{the left side of}} the cars on the right side of Petty's race car. The softer left side tires provided more traction when attached to the right side of a stock car and worked best when used during cool cloudy weather days which prevents the softer tires from quickly wearing out if mounted on the right side of the cars.|$|R

50|$|Camber thrust is {{approximately}} linearly proportional to camber angle for small angles, reaches its steady-state value nearly instantaneously after {{a change in}} camber angle, and so {{does not have an}} associated relaxation length. <b>Bias-ply</b> <b>tires</b> have been found to generate more camber thrust than radial tires. Camber stiffness is a parameter used to describe the camber thrust generated by a tire and it is influenced by inflation pressure and normal load. The net camber thrust is usually in front of the center of the wheel and so generates a camber torque, twisting torque, or twisting moment. The orientation of this torque is such that it tends to steer a tire towards the direction that it is leaned. An alternate explanation for this torque is that {{the two sides of the}} contact patch are at different radii from the axle and so would travel forward at different rates unless constrained by friction with the pavement.|$|R
50|$|By 1968, wide whitewall tires were {{no longer}} {{available}} on the Chevrolet Corvette; replaced by F70x15 <b>bias-ply</b> nylon cord <b>tires</b> with thin stripes, either a narrow white or narrow red stripe.|$|R

30|$|Shortages of {{gasoline}} and other petroleum fuels from time to time, as well as ecological concerns, have renewed interest in identifying factors that affect fuel efficiency of vehicles. To this end, various proposals for reducing fuel consumption have been made. These include simple modification of vehicle components such as replacement of <b>bias-ply</b> <b>tires</b> with radial tires and development of alternative fuel sources and new engine designs to optimize combustion. In addition, a noticeable trend toward smaller and more efficient vehicles {{has appeared in the}} last few decades. This is done through reducing vehicle weight by using new materials and by improving vehicles’ exterior design to achieve lower aerodynamic drag [9]. Thus, fuel efficiency has become a selling point in the automotive industry. Although most of the proposals for conserving fuel resources have been focused around vehicle design changes, some external factors have been considered as well. The national reduction of highway speed to 55 mph (88.5 km/h), mandated in the USA in the 1970 s, is one example. Other examples include maintaining a constant highway speed or maintaining a constant throttle setting [10].|$|R
50|$|By {{the late}} 1960s, Firestone was selling more than 20,000 {{car and truck}} tires a day. Firestone prospered from a company {{of just a few}} hundred {{employees}} to becoming the biggest industrial employer in Memphis, employing over 3,000. This helped lead to a huge milestone in the Firestone plant’s history. On July 1, 1963, the plant celebrated the production of its 100,000,000th tire. The plant in Memphis was the largest tire manufacturer in the company’s worldwide operation. The smokestack from the company was visible for miles apparently. The death blow was dealt to Firestone after the introduction of radial tires. Every driver wanted these because they simply handled better. The plant was making radial tires, but they decided to specialize in the older <b>bias-ply</b> <b>tires,</b> leading to Firestone dwindling away. In 1983 it was announced that the Firestone plant was closing. The closure of the plant caused more than 1,500 manufacturing and precision operator jobs between 1980 and 1990. Closure also caused declines in residential neighborhood populations and reduction of residential property values in the neighborhood.|$|R
50|$|Fitting modern tires {{is also a}} {{suggestion}} to improve the handling. However, most modern tires may be much wider and have a lower profile than those used on classic cars when new, therefore they may interfere with suspension elements and the tire walls may become damaged. The suspension of a classic car may not be suitable for radial ply tyres, having been designed to only accommodate bias ply tires. Narrow classic car wheels may have been designed for narrow high-profile tube tires and not be suitable for modern tubeless radial tires. Another problem with modern tires on classic cars is that increased grip requires increased steering effort; many classic cars do not come with power steering. Many major tire companies have dedicated classic car tire marketing departments and {{will be able to}} give expert technical advice to address all these issues. It is important to know how radial tires will affect the performance of a car originally fitted with <b>bias-ply</b> <b>tires,</b> and the considerations needed to compensate for the differences.|$|R
500|$|In {{preparation}} for the race, tire provider Goodyear created new tires, branded [...] "Wrangler", based on a previous dirt tire that the company made. To give the trucks more grip, the tires were widened by one inch to eleven. The <b>bias-ply</b> <b>tires</b> (instead of radial tires) also had treads to remove dirt quicker, in a block pattern, along with being softer. The left-side tires were staggered three inches shorter to 85.5 inches than the right tires (88.5) to assist in handling. Meanwhile, the trucks had mesh shields and hood deflector screens attached to prevent debris from the dirt from entering the radiators and damaging the vehicles. The trucks also had the front spoilers and splitters removed, the grille closed, and the rear spoilers raised and enlarged by 40 square inches to generate more downforce. The trucks' windshields remained, meaning the track crew had to keep the track dry, to prevent mud from making them unable to be cleared. On the hoods, bug deflectors, which were 8 by 12 inches, were installed to prevent stones from hitting the windshield. Teams added under panels to the trucks' chassis to prevent dirt from increasing the trucks' weight.|$|R
50|$|In the {{interest}} of cost containment, cars may use either roller camshafts (a type used in Busch Series and Craftsman Truck Series engines), or flat tappet camshafts (used in Nextel Cup engines). All cars using a roller camshaft must run a 10.0:1 compression ratio, slightly higher than the former 9.5:1 ratio mandated by NASCAR for those series. All cars using a flat-tappet camshaft must run with current NASCAR regulations mandating a 12.0:1 compression ratio, adopted in the late 1990s. Cars must also run <b>bias-ply</b> <b>tires,</b> despite Goodyear's four-season transition (1989-92) to radial tires. The first race with radials was the 1989 First Union 400 at North Wilkesboro, NC. The last bias-ply race was the 1992 Food City 500 at Bristol, TN. NASCAR has exclusively used radial tires since then, and with Bristol being the late track to go radial, with the August 1992 Bud 500) where later-model Historic cars (1986-88 Chevrolet Monte Carlo, 1990-94 Chevrolet Lumina, 1989-95 Ford Thunderbird, 1988-94 Pontiac Grand Prix, 1989-91 Buick Regal, and 1989-92 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme) all raced with radial tires, and Contemporary cars have only used radial tires.|$|R

Bobby Rahal won the pole position with {{a track record of}} 215.202 mph, but a massive practice crash the day before the race destroyed his machine. Moments later, Roberto Guerrero blew out a tire, and both incidents were blamed on possible tire deficiencies. The race was postponed until the following Saturday, and run with the old <b>bias-ply</b> <b>tires.</b> On race day, Emerson Fittipaldi led Al Unser, Sr. in the closing laps. Mario Andretti wrecked hard on lap 243, suffering a broken collarbone. That set up a sprint to the finish with the green and white flags coming out for the final lap. Unser, Sr. could not get past the lapped car of Tom Sneva, and Fittipaldi held on for the win, his first win in CART Indy car competition, and his first race win since the 1975 British Grand Prix. Besides Andretti's crash, the race was also marred by a scoring snafu by CART officials. On a lap 82 restart, officials put the lapped car of Phil Krueger {{in the front of the}} pack by mistake. When the green came out, faster cars swerved to pass him, but Danny Ongais got caught up in the melee, and barrel-rolled down the backstretch.|$|R
