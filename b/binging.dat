5|$|Little {{comprehensive}} {{data regarding}} rumination syndrome in otherwise healthy individuals exists because most sufferers are private about their illness {{and are often}} misdiagnosed due {{to the number of}} symptoms and the clinical similarities between rumination syndrome and other disorders of the stomach and esophagus, such as gastroparesis and bulimia nervosa. These symptoms include the acid-induced erosion of the esophagus and enamel, halitosis, malnutrition, severe weight loss and an unquenchable appetite. Individuals may begin regurgitating within a minute following ingestion, and the full cycle of ingestion and regurgitation can mimic the <b>binging</b> and purging of bulimia.|$|E

25|$|On March 14, 2013, TMZ {{reported}} that Lil Wayne {{had been treated}} at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles {{on the evening of}} March 12, after suffering seizures while on a music video set with Young Money rapper Nicki Minaj. He was reportedly released {{in the early hours of}} March 13. On March 15, TMZ published a second story, claiming that hours after his release on March 13, Lil Wayne was found unconscious after experiencing further seizures, and was brought back to Cedars-Sinai, where he was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit in critical condition. The article alleged the latest seizures were found to be linked to high amounts of codeine in Lil Wayne's system, possibly due to <b>binging</b> on purple drank after his initial hospital release. Multiple celebrities, including Drake and Birdman, were photographed on March 15 and 16 visiting Lil Wayne at Cedars-Sinai.|$|E

25|$|Albertone's move {{opened a}} wide {{gap in the}} Italian lines, and {{isolated}} his brigade from Arimondi and Dabormida. By 5:30 a.m., at sunrise, while the two Italian brigades deployed on the Rebbi Arienni, from his position overlooking the Mariam Shavitu valley Albertone sighted the Ethiopian camp. Convincing himself that Baratieri wanted him to threaten those positions, he sent forward the 1st Native Battalion of major Turitto to scout the ground. Around 6 p.m. the advanced battalion came under heavy attacks from nearby Ethiopian troops, and Menelik was rapidly <b>binging</b> fresh forces to this side. The assault was so fierce that it reached the Italian second line, and the entire Native Brigade was forced to retreat, protected by the fire of Albertone's two mountain artillery batteries. At 6:45 Baratieri, who {{heard the sound of}} the fighting, ordered Dabormida to advance in support of Albertone, whom he assumed to be at the false Kidane Meret, or little ahead. Once Dabormida discovered the Native Brigade was further away, he continued to slowly march westwards, reaching the Mariam Shavitu valley 3 miles north of Albertone's positions.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, Byrne and Mclean's {{findings}} differed {{slightly from}} Fairburn et al.s cognitive behavioral model of bulimia nervosa {{in that the}} drive for thinness was the major cause of purging {{as a way of}} controlling weight. In turn, Byrne and Mclean argued that this makes the individual vulnerable to <b>binging,</b> indicating {{that it is not a}} binge-purge cycle but rather a purge-binge cycle in that purging comes before bingeing. Similarly, Fairburn et al.s cognitive behavioral model of bulimia nervosa is not necessarily applicable to every individual and is certainly reductionist. Everyone differs from another, and taking such a complex behavior like bulimia and applying the same one theory to everyone would certainly be invalid. In addition, the cognitive behavioral model of bulimia nervosa is very cultural bound in that it may not be necessarily applicable to cultures outside of the Western society. To evaluate, Fairburn et al..'s model and more generally the cognitive explanation of bulimia nervosa is more descriptive than explanatory, as it does not necessarily explain how bulimia arises. Furthermore, it is difficult to ascertain cause and effect, because it may be that distorted eating leads to distorted cognition rather than vice versa.|$|E

Rather than being a steady drinker, as commonly thought, he was prone to periods of <b>binging</b> on alcohol. Loretta Young remarked that Tracy was [...] "awful" [...] when he was drunk, and he was twice arrested for his behavior while intoxicated. Because of this bad reaction to alcohol, Tracy regularly embarked on prolonged periods of sobriety, and developed an all-or-nothing routine.

He became ill while there, and suffered relapses during spring training. Ruth collapsed in Asheville, North Carolina, as the team journeyed north. He was put on a train for New York, where he was briefly hospitalized. A rumor circulated that he had died, prompting British newspapers to print a premature obituary. In New York, Ruth collapsed again and was found unconscious in his hotel bathroom. He was taken to a hospital where he suffered multiple convulsions. After sportswriter W. O. McGeehan wrote that Ruth's illness was due to <b>binging</b> on hot dogs and soda pop before a game, it became known as [...] "the bellyache heard 'round the world". However, the exact cause of his ailment has never been confirmed and remains a mystery. Glenn Stout, in his history of the Yankees, notes that the Ruth legend is [...] "still one of the most sheltered in sports"; he suggests that alcohol was at the root of Ruth's illness, pointing to the fact that Ruth remained six weeks at St. Vincent's Hospital but was allowed to leave, under supervision, for workouts with the team for part of that time. He concludes that the hospitalization was behavior-related. Playing just 98 games, Ruth had his worst season as a Yankee; he finished with a [...]290 average and 25 home runs. The Yankees finished next to last in the AL with a 69–85 record, their last season with a losing record until 1965.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{diagnostic}} criteria for bulimia nervosa {{did not appear}} until 1979, evidence suggests that <b>binging</b> and purging were popular in certain ancient cultures. The first documented account of behavior resembling bulimia nervosa was recorded in Xenophon's Anabasis around 370 B.C, in which Greek soldiers purged themselves {{in the mountains of}} Asia Minor. [...] It is unclear whether this purging was preceded by <b>binging.</b> [...] In ancient Egypt, physicians recommended purging once a month for three days in order to preserve health. This practice stemmed from the belief that human diseases were caused by the food itself. In ancient Rome, elite society members would vomit in order to [...] "make room" [...] in their stomachs for more food at all day banquets. Emperors Claudius and Vitellius both were gluttonous and obese, and they often resorted to habitual purging.|$|E
2500|$|One theory {{suggests}} that <b>binging</b> provides a short-term escape from feelings of sadness, anger, or boredom, although it may contribute to these negative emotions in the long-term. [...] Another {{theory suggests}} that binge eating involves reward seeking, as evidenced by decreased serotonin binding receptors of binge-eating women compared to matched-weight controls and predictive value of heightened reward sensitivity/drive in dysfunctional eating.|$|E

2500|$|The act of <b>binging</b> and purging {{provides}} bulimics {{with the}} illusion that they can regain a sense of control.

[...] The self-destructive behavior of injecting intoxicating drugs parallels overeating; it permits the user to experience comfort, and to feel punished afterwards.|$|E
