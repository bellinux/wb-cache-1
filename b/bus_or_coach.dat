50|$|Succeeding the Leyland Royal Tiger underfoor-engined heavyweight single-decker <b>bus</b> <b>or</b> single-decker <b>coach</b> chassis {{which sold}} more than 6,000 from 1950 to 1956 was a {{difficult}} call, but Leyland answered it with the Royal Tiger Worldmaster, it retained a substantial steel ladder-frame chassis dropped in the wheelbase and overhangs and arched over the axles to which operators could fit a body of their choice. A Leyland O680H horizontal engine (the smaller-volume 0.600H was optional but rarely chosen) was mounted at {{the middle of the}} chassis frame, driving back through a pneumocyclic semi-automatic gearbox to an overhead-worm rear axle, steering was via a worm and nut mechanism.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the terms}} {{and the results of}} a sample of some recent Brazilian bidding processes for the concession of public passenger transport services: namely, urban and metropolitan <b>bus</b> <b>or</b> regional <b>coach</b> services. The analysis is based on selected issues relating to competitiveness and upon the legal framework that applies in this sector. It was concluded that, given the lack of bidding processes for concessions in the bus and coach sector in Brazil, the fact that some bidding processes have been carried out should be considered a sign of progress. However, these auctions have not necessarily prioritised competitiveness, since many barriers to entry into the systems were imposed by the bidding terms. Future competitive tendering processes should seek to abide by stricter principles of competitiveness, if they wish to avoid the entire effort expended on conducting such processes serving only to mask nothing more than formal obedience to the law and to discredit the bidding process in the eyes of Brazilian citizens.

5000|$|The USA have various sport related {{chaplaincy}} organizations. Along {{with major}} Denominations, Ministries such as Athletes in Action and Fellowship of Christian Athletes also provide chaplains to various sports at the collegiate and professional levels. Every major professional {{sport in the}} United States has at least some sports chaplaincy. Some sports are more coordinated, like Major League Baseball (see www.baseballchapel.org), but most are far more loosely structured with each chaplain having a program that best suits their team and individual situation. Every MLB, NFL, NBA & Major League Soccer franchise has a chaplain. Due to financial constraints, very few chaplains travel with their teams. In some cases, especially when an individual coach understands {{the value of the}} chaplain to their team, the coach may invite the chaplain to come on a road trip. This happens far more frequently when a team is traveling a short distance to a neighboring city by <b>bus</b> <b>or</b> motor <b>coach,</b> but in some cases, coaches have paid (out of their own pocket) to bring a chaplain on a road trip.|$|R
