40|$|The {{absence of}} a formal place in {{representative}} democracy at EU level casts sub-national authorities more as actors of EU participatory democracy. Where they have specific interests to pursue their <b>Brussels</b> <b>offices</b> act {{in the same way}} as ‘lobbyists’, but public authorities are also capable of acting on broader interest sets. This analysis is geared to understanding variation in the extent to which the diversely constituted <b>Brussels</b> <b>offices</b> of the regions can act on a broad spectrum of civil society interests, and thus have potential as actors of European integration in connecting civil society with EU institutions. Differences in the orientation of offices towards either highly defined or broad agendas can be conceived in qualified principal-agent terms, in which the autonomy of offices to develop activities is the critical explanatory factor. This autonomy can be derived more from the structure of principals and from degrees of purpose they have than from asymmetries of power between principals and agents, which in turn can be drawn from typologies of degrees of devolved authority present in different member states. It predicts that territorial offices from member states with medium degrees of devolved authority have the greatest potential to act on a broad range of civil society oriented interests...|$|R

40|$|This article {{seeks to}} map out routes of direct {{regional}} interest representation in the European Union. It identifies six main opportunity structures available to regions: the Committee of the Regions, the Council of Ministers, the Commission, the European Parliament, regional <b>Brussels</b> <b>offices</b> and European networks and associations. Using original interview material, the article analyses how and under what conditions each route can be most efficient for regional interest representation. It concludes that though these opportunity structures have not triggered {{the emergence of a}} 'Europe of the Regions' as some of the literature in the 1990 s had predicted, they do represent important channels of access that regions can use in an attempt to influence the EU policy process. These regional para-diplomatic activities bypass EU member states and consequently challenge liberal intergovernmentalist assumptions regarding the nature of EU politics...|$|R
