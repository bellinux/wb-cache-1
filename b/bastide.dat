25|$|Isabella's husband Edward, as the Duke of Aquitaine, owed {{homage to}} the King of France for his lands in Gascony. Isabella's three {{brothers}} each had only short reigns, and Edward had successfully avoided paying homage to Louis X, and had only paid homage to Philip V under great pressure. Once Charles IV took up the throne, Edward had attempted to avoid doing so again, increasing tensions between the two. One of the elements in the disputes was the border province of Agenais, part of Gascony and in turn part of Aquitaine. Tensions had risen in November 1323 after {{the construction of a}} <b>bastide,</b> a type of fortified town, in Saint-Sardos, part of the Agenais, by a French vassal. Gascon forces destroyed the <b>bastide,</b> and in turn Charles attacked the English-held Montpezat: the assault was unsuccessful, but in the subsequent War of Saint-Sardos Isabella's uncle, Charles of Valois, successfully wrestled Aquitaine from English control; by 1324, Charles had declared Edward's lands forfeit and had occupied the whole of Aquitaine apart from the coastal areas.|$|E

25|$|Foucault's Pendulum also bears {{a number}} of {{similarities}} to Eco's own experiences and writing. The character of Belbo was brought up in, and refers to many times, the region of Piedmont in Northern Italy. In an article compiled in Faith In Fakes, Eco refers to his own visit to a Candomblé ceremony in Brazil, reminiscent of the episode in the novel, and also describes a French ethnologist, Roger <b>Bastide</b> who bears resemblance {{to the character of}} Agliè.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, The Ruby Throne, {{the first}} volume of a new four-volume {{adaptation}} of Elric of Melniboné written by Julien Blondel and illustrated by Didier Poli, Jean <b>Bastide,</b> and Robin Recht, was published by Titan Comics. Stormbringer, the second volume was published in March 2015 by the same team and publisher. Moorcock states that this is his favorite comic adaptation of his Elric stories to date and praises the subtle changes to the original story, saying that he wishes he had made them himself. The third volume, entitled 'The White Wolf', will be released in September of 2017.|$|E
25|$|Among these, the Clos des Moulins, {{delivered}} in 2007, presents 44 units spread across four-storey buildings, {{close to the}} college and the stadium. Always close to the college, the cité des familles consists of 16 moderate-rent housing. In 2008, two other residences were opened near the Des Bourtoulets Quarter, Boulevard des Tilleuls and the station: The Villalodge du Parc, consisting of 16 villas and 54 apartments, and the residence of la Cheneraie, consisting of 62 apartments spread over four-storey buildings. Finally, north of the town, {{on the road to}} Galan, the <b>Bastide</b> de Piquegrue was created in 2009. It contains 34 semi-detached villas.|$|E

25|$|However, Léonce Perret is {{surprisingly}} unfamiliar to the generations of movie buffs that followed him. Cinema historians give him little consideration in their published research. For example, {{the study of}} Léonce Perret did not exist until 2003, {{but it was not}} definitive. Entitled Léonce Perret, the biography was published by the French Association for Historical Film Studies in collaboration with the Bologne Film Library under the direction of Bernard <b>Bastide</b> and Jean A. Gili. In 2006, Daniel Taillé published a more thorough work giving homage to such a pioneering artist. This was entitled Léonce Perret, cinématographiste.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{entering}} the Marseille youth academy, Nasri quickly impressed. Upon moving to <b>Bastide,</b> where the club's youth players reside, {{his style of}} play began to take shape. In 2007, Nasri admitted that the move to <b>Bastide</b> really helped his game, stating, [...] "That's where I really started to progress. Training was different and the facilities are beautiful, all of which helps you work well." [...] As {{a result of his}} quick progression, Nasri {{was an integral part of}} every youth team he was a part of winning several trophies, such as the Championnat de Provence, Coupe de Provence, and the Ligue de la Méditerranée. After spending most of the 2003–04 season playing with the club's under-18 team, for the latter part of the season, the now 16-year-old Nasri was promoted to the club's reserve team in the Championnat de France amateur, the fourth division of French football. He appeared primarily as a substitute in a few matches during the campaign as the reserve team failed to rebound from its bad start to the season, which resulted in a 16th-place finish and relegation to the Championnat de France amateur 2.|$|E

500|$|General d'Arco now ordered de la Colonie's French {{grenadiers}} into reserve {{on top of}} the Heights (above the breastworks {{manned by}} the Bavarians), ready to plug any gaps in their defences at the appropriate time. However, due to the flatness of the summit this position offered his men limited protection from the Allied guns. This exposure was noted by Colonel Blood who, sighting his artillery upon the summit, was able to inflict serious casualties upon de la Colonie's men. De la Colonie later recorded– [...] "They concentrated their fire upon us, and with their first discharge carried off Count de la <b>Bastide...</b> so that my coat was covered with brains and blood." [...] Notwithstanding this barrage, and despite losing five officers and 80 grenadiers before firing a shot, de la Colonie insisted his French regiment stayed at their post, determined as he was to maintain discipline and ensure his troops would be in good order when called into action.|$|E

2500|$|As an {{architect}} his engineering skills were firmly to the forefront, {{rather than an}} interpretation on the finer and more sophisticated points of rinascimento architecture.

5000|$|While {{most cities}} during the Gothic era grew {{over a longer}} period in a more or less {{haphazard}} way, there are some examples of centralised town planning from the period. Several new towns designed with grid plans were founded in the south of France in the 13th and 14th centuries, where they are known as <b>Bastides.</b> These cities and towns had their own characteristics: [...] "Purpose-built on unoccupied land, these <b>bastides</b> were immediately different from older medieval villages with winding streets that grew willy-nilly over decades. The <b>bastides</b> adopted the regular square grid of ancient Roman towns, with an arcaded market square at the center. In most cases, the church was set {{off to the side of}} the square, pointing to the priority given to trade." [...] The city of Aigues Mortes in southern France is an unusually large example of a consciously redesigned, if not strictly new, city.|$|R
