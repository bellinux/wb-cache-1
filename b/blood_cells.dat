5|$|The chronically low oxygen {{levels in}} the blood also lead to {{increased}} release of erythropoietin and the activation of erythropoeisis, the production of red <b>blood</b> <b>cells.</b> This results in polycythemia, abnormally increased numbers of circulating red <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> and an elevated hematocrit.|$|E
5|$|The {{parasite}} {{is relatively}} protected from {{attack by the}} body's immune system because {{for most of its}} human life cycle it resides within the liver and <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> and is relatively invisible to immune surveillance. However, circulating infected <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> are destroyed in the spleen. To avoid this fate, the P.falciparum parasite displays adhesive proteins {{on the surface of the}} infected <b>blood</b> <b>cells,</b> causing the <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> to stick to the walls of small blood vessels, thereby sequestering the parasite from passage through the general circulation and the spleen. The blockage of the microvasculature causes symptoms such as in placental malaria. Sequestered red <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> can breach the blood–brain barrier and cause cerebral malaria.|$|E

The relationship between cultural background, red <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> status and family constellation to the developmental progress of 201 one year olds and 136 three year olds was described. The subjects were clients from a well child clinic that provides health care to financially disadvantaged children. The children represented three cultural backgrounds with 19 percent Black, 28 percent White and 53 percent Spanish. Selected age-appropriate items from the Denver Developmental Screening Test were used to evaluate personal/social, fine motor, verbal and gross motor development. Statistically significant differences were found in the verbal and gross motor development of one year olds related to the interaction of cultural background with red <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> status. Significant differences in the verbal and gross motor development of three year olds were related to cultural background with red <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> status or the interaction of cultural background with red <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> status or the interaction of red <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> status with family constellation. Red <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> deficient Black and White one year olds scored lower on identifying their parents than could be accounted for by these two independent variables separately. Red <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> deficient Spanish and White children scored higher in walking well than could be accounted for by these two variables separately, while White red <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> deficient one year olds scored markedly lower than could be accounted for by these two variables separately.
