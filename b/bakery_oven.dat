40|$|The {{management}} of {{volatile organic compounds}} in bakery exhaust gases {{was identified as a}} high priority problem by the American Bakers Association in conjunction with their member companies. Biotrickling filter technology was evaluated among other approaches and was selected for a pilot study to control ethanol emissions from a <b>bakery</b> <b>oven</b> exhaust gas stream. Biofilters and biotrickling filters use microbial populations in biofilms that grow on support media to degrade or transform contaminants in the air. The biotrickling filter employed in the pilot study used a synthetic fibrous support media to immobilize the biofilm. A pilot study was conducted from September 1997 to February 1998, to assess the performance of biotrickling filter technology in treating organic emissions from bakery ovens. Bench-scale studies were conducted to determine the effectiveness of the support media and develop initial estimates of biotrickling filter performance. Pilot studies were performed with USEPA’s trailer mounted two-stage biotrickling filter system, at flowrates in the range of 1. 8 - 3. 0 standard cubic meters per minute (65 - 104 standard cubic feet per minute). Removal efficiencies in the range of 80 % to 100 % were measured experimentally, and averaged 91 % over the duration of the study. The pilot-scale biofilter produced removal efficiencies exceeding 80 % for about 99. 6 % of its operating time. The pressure drop across the bed was less than 6. 4 millimeters (0. 25 inches) of water. The test further revealed that the biotrickling filter was quite robust; it responded quickly to changes in inlet concentration and exhibited a recovery time of less than 150 minutes after a nine day shutdown period. Preliminary economic analysis of the biotrickling filter system, from a Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) perspective, showed that the tested biotrickling filter technology is cost-effective for treating ethanol emissions from a <b>bakery</b> <b>oven...</b>|$|E

The technology used is often “fixed grate” combustion in small batch furnaces.

This work has been undertaken {{in order to develop}} an efficient and environmentally friendly <b>bakery</b> <b>oven</b> furnace fired by biomass. The work was performed in Mozambique, and a survey was used to evaluate the consumption of wood and the technology used in the process of bread baking in two selected townships. The data collected from the 104 bakeries consisted of the dimensions of the oven, the temperature profiles of the combustion chamber and baking oven, the baking time and the bread quality. The circulation of hot gases within a baking oven was used to describe and predict the behaviour of the heat exchange {{and the quality of the}} products produced. A bi-dimensional cold flow model and a CFD model were used to estimate the flow pattern inside the oven by varying the velocity of the air flow in order to simulate changes in the combustion chamber. Experimental measurements to support improvements in the design and performance of the oven were performed on in situ wood-fired bakery ovens in Mozambique in order to evaluate the dependence of the quality of bread produced on different process conditions that originated from design of oven, the temperature profile and the wood used in combustion. 3 D CFD model was also used to study the heat transfer process during the baking process to predict the causes of the differences in quality of the bread baked in same batch. The effects of the design of the oven were analysed concerning velocity, temperature distribution and heat transfer during the baking process. As much as 60 tonnes/day of green wood are consumed in the bread baking process in the areas investigated. Two types of bakery ovens are used most commonly: indirect and semi-direct. The specific consumption was found to be 0. 55 and 0. 90 kg of wood per kg of wheat flour baked for the indirect and semi-direct, respectively. The inlet velocity, the geometry and the mode of the feeding dough into the oven affect the flow pattern in the baking oven. The temperature becomes non-uniform, the velocity varies according to the inlet velocity and consequently the quality of the bread baked in WFBO is not uniform. The analyses of heat transfer from in situ <b>bakery</b> <b>oven</b> shows the dependence on distribution of heat and intensity inside the baking chamber due to the temperature being non-uniform, even with steady temperature conditions in the oven. The heat intensity is affected by burning different wood species. The differences in layers of sand under the oven base give rise to variations of the condition during the baking process. A mathematical model of the transient heat transfer in a wood-fired <b>bakery</b> <b>oven</b> shows a high accuracy with earlier experimental results. Furthermore, it describes the differences in the distribution of heat in the oven. Fifty per cent of hot gases cross the oven without releasing any heat. The variations in the heat distribution are the cause of the differences in the quality of the bread baked in this device. An example of optimisation using CFD model shows good approximation of the optimal geometry of the oven with reasonable heat distribution.

40|$|Abstract Combustion {{of biomass}} in {{small-scale}} furnaces {{is widely used}} in many countries and in different applications. Often, the technology used is fixed grate combustion in small batch furnaces. The efficiency of such furnace is often low which results in a high environmental impact due to the poorly controlled combustion of the wood logs that are largely used as the heat source for baking bread in wood-fired bakery ovens. This work has been undertaken {{in order to develop}} an efficient and environment friendly <b>bakery</b> <b>oven</b> furnace fired by biomass. The work was performed in Mozambique, and a survey was used to evaluate the consumption of wood and the technology used in the process of bread baking in two selected townships. The data collected from the 104 bakeries consisted of the dimensions of the oven, the temperature profiles within the combustion chamber and baking oven and, finally, the baking time. The circulation of hot gases within the baking oven was used to describe and predict the behaviour of the heat exchange {{and the quality of the}} products produced. Bi-dimensional cold flow equipment and a CFD model were used in conjunction to estimate the flow pattern inside the oven, which is one of the key factors in determining the baking efficiency of such ovens. Experiments were conducted in a physical model; various velocities were used to simulate changes in the air flow within the combustion chamber of the bakery ovens. Mathematical modelling was used to describe the flow using a standard k-ω model, which took the effects of the feeding door into account. As much as 60 tons/day of green wood are consumed in the bread baking process in the investigated area. The bread baking process in a semi-direct <b>bakery</b> <b>oven</b> occurs when contact is made between the bread/dough and the flue gases as they exit the combustion chamber. The relationship between the mass of firewood consumed and mass of wheat processed (specific consumption) was found to be 0. 55 in indirect ovens and 0. 90 in semi-direct. The temperature profile in a semi-direct oven beyond the inlet airflow is affected negatively by the feeding door, an effect that is magnified with manual feeding of the dough causing lack of uniformity on the quality of the bread produced. Surrounding air rushes in via the bottom edge of the feeding door when it is opened, whilst hot gases exit rapidly, flowing oven the top edge of the door, and thus affects the overall heat transfer by changing the effective thermal conductivity. Urgent improvement to this system is recommended not only to minimize this phenomenon but also to improve the efficiency of such ovens and the quality of the bread produced therein. Comparisons made between the flow pattern achieved by the bi-dimensional cold flow model and the CFD model show acceptable agreement. The flow pattern inside the baking oven varies with variations in the hot gases leaving the combustion chamber. The increment in velocity directly improves the baking conditions in the temperature range desired by increasing the circulation and effective thermal conductivity of the hot gases within the baking oven...|$|E

The second son died young from scarlet fever and the oldest, an aspiring hockey goaltender whom Terry idolized, died suddenly of a heart attack at age seventeen. At age twelve, Sawchuk injured his right elbow playing rugby and, not wanting to be punished by his parents, hid the injury, preventing the dislocation from properly healing.

The heat intensity is affected by burning different wood species. The varying baking time used by the bakers is an additional factor that resulted in a nonuniform quality of the final product. Furthermore, the differences in the layers of sand that are under the oven base give rise to variations in conduction during the baking process and thus impact on the quality of the final product.

A madeira como {{material}} construtivo renovável, e segundo as dimensões da sustentabilidade, econômica e ambiental, apresenta as seguintes potencialidades: plantio e manejo florestal sustentável; adequação a diversos sistemas estruturais e construtivos; baixos consumos de energia e baixa geração de resíduos no processo de produção; desmontagem e aproveitamento dos resíduos no processo de transformação. O método adotado para o desenvolvimento do produto painel foi baseado, na análise e aperfeiçoamentos sucessivos a partir da avaliação dos dados coletados na fase experimental (processo de produção). As variáveis consideradas foram: facilidade de produção (homem/minuto, hora/equipamento e ferramentas), volume de resíduos gerados no processamento, custos e facilidade de montagem do painel. Os critérios adotados na avaliação de desempenho técnico foram: estrutural, estanqueidade visual e durabilidade. Na avaliação da sustentabilidade ambiental foram: uso de materiais de fontes renováveis; baixo consumo energético; redução de resíduos gerados. A sustentabilidade econômica foi avaliada considerando os critérios de: facilidade de produção; facilidade de montagem; produção em escala; baixos custos dos materiais empregados. Foram desenvolvidos e avaliados 10 projetos segundo os critérios considerados, concluindo-se com a proposição do produto painel estrutural composto por 1 / 2 peças roliças de eucalipto com pequeno diâmetro, curtas, justapostas e pregadas à chapa OSB (oriented strand board).

Wood as a renewable building material  and, in accordance with the environmental and economic dimensions of sustainability  presents the following potentialities: sustainable forest planting and handling; adequacy to several building and structural systems; low energy consumption and low residual outcome during the production process; dismantling and reuse of the remnants in the transformation process. The method adopted {{for the development of the}} panel product was grounded on the analysis and consecutive improvement, which was based on the evaluation of the data collected in the experimental phase (production process). The following variables were considered: production easiness (man/minute, time/equipment and tooling), amount of remnant generated by the processing, cost and panel mounting easiness. The criteria adopted in the evaluation of technical execution were the following: structural, visual tightness and durability. The following criteria were used in the environmental sustainability evaluation: use of materials from renewable sources; low energy consumption; reduction of residual outcome. The economic sustainability was evaluated taken the following criteria into consideration: production easiness; mounting easiness; mass production, low cost of the materials used. Ten projects have been developed and evaluated according to the considered criteria, and the structural panel product comprising juxtaposed, short, small diameter, eucalyptus, half round-wood pieces, nailed to OSB (oriented strand board) plate, was proposed. The panel has dimensions fractionized in the height and the width of the plate (1. 22 x 2, 44 m), in the following measures: 0. 61 x 2. 44; 0. 61 x 1. 22; 1. 22 x 1. 22 m; 1. 22 x 2. 44 m. This panel composition enables for best utilization of the so called metrinho (small pieces) pieces, which, nowadays, are 100 % used in burning for the generation of energy (from <b>bakery</b> to industrial <b>ovens).</b> The proposal has shown to be doable and of easy execution, even in precarious machinery situations. The adoption of these building simplifications for the production of building components for housing may represent an opportunity to reduce the execution time, as well as the products cost, in order to serve the low income housing sector. The proposal also presents a contribution to the improvement of housing conditions and to the reduction of negative environmental impacts, caused by the civil construction through the use of non-renewable materials...|$|R
