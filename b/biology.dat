5|$|Evolutionary <b>biology</b> {{is partly}} based on paleontology, which uses {{the fossil record}} to answer {{questions}} about the mode and tempo of evolution, and partly on the developments in areas such as population genetics. In the 1980s, developmental <b>biology</b> re-entered evolutionary <b>biology</b> after its initial exclusion from the modern synthesis through the study of evolutionary developmental <b>biology.</b> Phylogenetics, systematics, and taxonomy are related fields often considered part of evolutionary <b>biology.</b>|$|E
5|$|Molecular <b>biology</b> is {{the study}} of <b>biology</b> at the {{molecular}} level. This field overlaps with other areas of <b>biology,</b> particularly those of genetics and biochemistry. Molecular <b>biology</b> is a study of the interactions of the various systems within a cell, including the interrelationships of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis and how those interactions are regulated.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle's <b>biology</b> is {{the theory}} of <b>biology,</b> {{grounded}} in systematic observation and collection of data, mainly zoological, embodied in Aristotle's books on the science. Many of his observations were made during his stay {{on the island of}} Lesbos, including especially his descriptions of the marine <b>biology</b> of the Pyrrha lagoon there. His theory is based on his concept of form, which derives from but is markedly unlike Plato's theory of Forms.|$|E

The conference has been held every year since 1993 and has grown {{to become one of}} the largest and most prestigious meetings in these fields, hosting over 2,000 delegates in 2004. From the first meeting, ISMB has been held in locations worldwide; since 2007, meetings have been located in Europe and North America in alternating years.

40|$|International audienceUnraveling the {{specific}} spirit which animated some seminal {{works in the}} first half of the twentieth century could increase our understanding of the contemporary diversity of theoretical <b>biologies</b> and, more generally, of the biological studies which are based on theoretical models, especially as far as growth and morphogenesis are concerned. Going back to the main epistemological ideas of d’Arcy Thompson, Lotka, Woodger, Rashevsky and Rosen, this chapter follows a historical, epistemological but also comparative line. Its guiding questions are the following: to what extent can one say that there was and there still exists a diversity of mathematical <b>biologies,</b> but also a diversity of biophysics and theoretical <b>biologies?</b> In what precise terms nonetheless can we formulate the core problem that all theoretical <b>biologies</b> have to solve - whatever their diversity? How each of these diverse approaches leads us to conceive the nature of the complexities of life? And, how accordingly, does each one lead us to think the epistemic role of theorizing and modeling once it has assumed for itself the very nature and origin of these complexities...|$|R

5|$|Sub-disciplines of <b>biology</b> {{are defined}} by the scale at which life is studied, the kinds of organisms studied, and the methods used to study them: {{biochemistry}} examines the rudimentary chemistry of life; molecular <b>biology</b> studies the complex interactions among biological molecules; cellular <b>biology</b> examines the basic building-block of all life, the cell; physiology examines the physical and chemical functions of tissues, organs, and organ systems; ecology examines how organisms interact in their environment; and evolutionary <b>biology</b> examines the processes that produced the diversity of life.|$|E
