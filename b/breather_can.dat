40|$|The {{system of}} “integrable” coupled {{nonlinear}} Schrödinger equations (Manakov system) with three {{components in the}} defocusing regime is considered. Rogue wave solutions exist for a restricted range of group velocity mismatch, and the existence condition correlates precisely {{with the onset of}} baseband modulation instability. This assertion is further elucidated numerically by evidence based on the generation of rogue waves by a single mode disturbance with a small frequency. This same computational approach can be adopted to study coupled nonlinear Schrödinger equations for the “non‐integrable” regime, where the coefficients of self‐phase modulation and cross‐phase modulation are different from each other. Starting with a wavy disturbance of a finite frequency corresponding to the large modulation instability growth rate, a <b>breather</b> <b>can</b> be generated. The <b>breather</b> <b>can</b> be symmetric or asymmetric depending on the magnitude of the growth rate.

40|$|We have {{introduced}} {{a class of}} spiraling elliptic breathers in saturable nonlinear media with linear anisotropy. Two kinds of evolution behaviors of the breathers, rotating and pendulum-like librating, are both predicted by the variational approach, and confirmed by the numerical simulation. The spiraling elliptic <b>breathers</b> <b>can</b> rotate {{even though they have}} no initial orbital angular momentum (OAM). Due to the linear anisotropy of the media, the OAM is no longer conserved. Therefore, the angular velocity is found to be not a constant but a periodic function of the propagation distance. When the linear anisotropy is large enough, the spiraling elliptic <b>breathers</b> <b>can</b> librate like the pendulum. The spiraling elliptic breathers exist in the media with not only the saturable nonlinearity but also the nonlocal nonlinearity, as a matter of fact, they are universal in the nonlinear media with the linear anisotropy.

We also investigate the nonlinear interactions between these waves, which display some novel patterns due to the non-propagating characteristics of the solitons: (1) Two antidark solitons can produce a W-shaped soliton instead of a higher-order antidark one, (2) The interaction between an antidark soliton and a W-shaped soliton can not only generate a higher-order antidark soliton, but also form a W-shaped solion pair, (3) The interactions between an oscillation W-shaped soliton and an oscillation M-shaped soliton show the multipeak structures.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of moving discrete breathers in an interfaced piecewise DNA molecule. This is a DNA chain {{in which all the}} base pairs are identical and there exists an interface such that the base pairs dipole moments at each side are oriented in opposite directions. The Hamiltonian of the Peyrard [...] Bishop model is augmented with a term that includes the dipole [...] dipole coupling between base pairs. Numerical simulations show the existence of two dynamical regimes. If the translational kinetic energy of a moving breather launched towards the interface is below a critical value, it is trapped in a region around the interface collecting vibrational energy. For an energy larger than the critical value, the breather is transmitted and continues travelling along the double strand with lower velocity. Reflection phenomena never occur. The same study has been carried out when a single dipole is oriented in opposite direction to the other ones. When moving breathers collide with the single inverted dipole, the same effects appear. These results emphasize the importance of this simple type of local inhomogeneity as it creates a mechanism for the trapping of energy. Finally, the simulations show that, under favorable conditions, several launched moving breathers can be trapped successively at the interface region producing an accumulation of vibrational energy. Moreover, an additional colliding moving <b>breather</b> <b>can</b> produce a saturation of energy and a moving breather with all the accumulated energy is transmitted to the chain.

40|$|The {{scattering}} of kinks and low-frequency breathers of the nonlinear sine-Gordon (SG) equation on a spatially localized parity-time-symmetric perturbation (defect) with a balanced gain and loss is investigated numerically. It is demonstrated {{that if a}} kink passes the defect, it always restores its initial momentum and energy, and the only effect of the interaction with the defect is a phase shift of the kink. A kink approaching the defect from the gain side always passes, while in the opposite case it must have sufficiently large initial momentum {{to pass through the}} defect instead of being trapped in the loss region. The kink phase shift and critical velocity are calculated by means of the collective variable method. Kink-kink (kink-antikink) collisions at the defect are also briefly considered, showing how their pairwise repulsive (respectively, attractive) interaction can modify the collisional outcome of a single kink within the pair with the defect. For the breather, the result of its interaction with the defect depends strongly on the breather parameters (velocity, frequency, and initial phase) and on the defect parameters. The <b>breather</b> <b>can</b> gain some energy from the defect and as a result potentially even split into a kink-antikink pair, or it can lose a part of its energy. Interestingly, the breather translational mode is very weakly affected by the dissipative perturbation, so that a breather penetrates more easily through the defect when it comes from the lossy side, than a kink. In all studied soliton-defect interactions, the energy loss to radiation of small-amplitude extended waves is negligible...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} mainly {{concerned}} with the properties of some discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equations. These naturally arise in many different physical contexts as the limiting form of general dynamical lattice equations that incorporate nonlinearity and coupling. Interest is focused on theoretical models of coupled optical waveguides constructed from materials with a nonlinear index of refraction. In arrays of waveguides the overlap of the evanescent electric field of the modes in neighbouring waveguides provides a coupling and the nonlinearity of the material provides a mechanism to halt the discrete diffraction that otherwise would spread localized energy across the array. In particular, waveguide structures where also a nonlinear coupling is taken into account are studied. It is noted that the equation {{for the evolution of}} the complex amplitudes of the electric field along an array of waveguides also can be used to describe the dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates trapped in a periodic optical potential. Possible excitations in arrays in both one and two dimensions are considered, with emphasis on the effects of the nonlinear coupling. Localized excitations are considered from the viewpoint of the theory of discrete breathers, or intrinsic localized modes, i. e., solutions of the dynamical equations that are periodic in time and have a spatial localization. The general theory of such solutions, that appear under very general circumstances in nonlinear lattice equations, is reviewed. In an array of waveguides this means that light can propagate along the array confined essentially to one or a few waveguides. In general a distinction is made between excitations that are centred on a waveguide, or site in the lattice, and excitations that are centred inbetween waveguides. Usually only the former give stable propagation. When the localized beam can be displaced to neighbouring waveguides the array can operate as an optical switch. With the inclusion of nonlinear coupling between the sites, as in the model derived in this thesis, the stability of the site-centred and bond-centred solutions can be exchanged. It is shown how this leads to the existence of highly localized mobile solutions that can propagate transversely in the one-dimensional array of waveguides. The inversion of stability of stationary solutions occurs also in the two-dimensional array, but in this setting it fails to give good mobility of localized excitations. The reason for this is also explained. In a two-dimensional lattice a discrete <b>breather</b> <b>can</b> have the form of a vortex. This means that the phase of the complex amplitude will vary on a contour around the excitation, such that the phase is increased by 2 πS, where S is the topological charge, on the completion of one turn. Some ring-like vortex excitations are considered and in particular a stable vortex with S= 2 is found. It is also noted that the effect of charge flipping, i. e., when the topological charge periodically changes between -S and S, is connected to the existence of quasiperiodic solutions. The nonlinear coupling of the waveguide model will also give rise to some more exotic and novel properties of localized solutions, e. g., discrete breathers with a nontrivial phase. When the linear coupling and the nonlinear coupling have opposite signs, there can be a decoupling in the lattice that allows for compact solutions. These localized excitations will have no decaying tail. Of interest is also the flexibility in controlling the transport of power across the array when it is excited with a nonlinear plane wave. It is shown how a change of the amplitude of a plane wave can affect the magnitude and direction of power flow in the array. Also the continuum limit of the one-dimensional discrete waveguide model is considered with an equation incorporating both nonlocal and nonlinear dispersion. In general continuum equations the balance between nonlinearity and dispersion can lead to the formation of localized travelling waves, or solitons. With nonlinear dispersion it is seen that these solitons can be nonanalytic and have discontinuous spatial derivatives. The emergence of short-wavelength instabilities due to the simultaneous presence of nonlocal and nonlinear dispersion is also explained...|$|E
