50|$|Displaced {{intra-articular}} fractures require surgical intervention within 3 {{weeks of}} fracture, before bone consolidation has occurred. Conservative surgery consists of closed reduction with percutaneous fixation.

However, this procedure has increased risk of inadequate calcaneal <b>bone</b> <b>fixation,</b> compared to open procedures. Currently, open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF) is usually the preferred surgical approach when dealing with displaced intra-articular fractures.

40|$|Surgical {{fixation}} is {{the preferred}} method of treatment for the ruptured distal biceps tendon in active patients. To date, no fixation technique has been proven superior in a clinical setting. The {{purpose of the study}} was to systematically review the available literature on approach and fixation methods for distal biceps tendon repair in a clinical setting and to determine the optimal fixation methods of the distal biceps tendon on the radial tuberosity. Our hypothesis was that the outcomes would not be significantly different among the various fixation techniques and approaches. A systematic review of the available literature on anatomic reconstruction methods for distal biceps tendon ruptures was performed. The outcome measures evaluated were postoperative range of motion, elbow flexion and supination strength, and complication rates and types. Forty articles were included, representing 1074 patients divided into 4 fixation groups: suture anchors, bone tunnels, interference screws, and cortical buttons. There was no significant difference in range of motion and strength between the different approaches and fixation techniques. Complications were significantly less common after the double-incision approach with <b>bone</b> tunnel <b>fixation</b> (P <. 0005). There were significantly fewer complications after the double-incision approach with <b>bone</b> tunnel <b>fixation.</b> The double-incision approach had significantly fewer complications than the single-incision anterior approach, and the <b>bone</b> tunnel <b>fixation</b> had significantly fewer complications than the other 3 fixation techniques.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Coaptive film (i. e., Steri-StripsTM) is an {{adhesive}} tape used to replace sutures in wound closure. The use of coaptive film for wound closure after long <b>bone</b> fracture <b>fixation</b> {{has not been}} well documented in the literature. METHODS: The aim of this prospective, randomized controlled trial comparing coaptive film with sutures for wound closure after long <b>bone</b> fracture <b>fixation</b> was skin closure time, incidence of wound complications and scar width at 12 week follow-up. Forty-five patients underwent femur fracture fixation (22 patients’ wound closed with sutures, 23 with coaptive film). RESULTS: The mean time for skin closure using coaptive film was 171. 13 seconds compared to 437. 27 seconds using suture. The mean wound lengths in the coaptive film group and suture group were 187. 65 mm and 196. 73 mm, respectively. One patient in each group had wound complications. CONCLUSION: Coaptive film is a time-saving procedure for skin closure following long <b>bone</b> fracture <b>fixation.</b> There is {{no difference in the}} incidence of wound complications and scar width between these two methods of skin closure...|$|R

5000|$|... 316 {{stainless}} steel, {{also referred}} to as marine grade stainless steel, is a chromium, nickel, molybdenum alloy of steel that exhibits relatively good strength and corrosion resistance. Along with the titanium alloy Ti6Al4V, 316 stainless is a common choice of material for biomedical implants. Although Ti6Al4V provides greater strength per weight and corrosion resistance, 316 stainless components can be more economical to produce. However, immune system reaction to nickel is a potential complication of 316. Implants and equipment that are put under pressure (<b>bone</b> <b>fixation</b> screws, prostheses, body piercing jewelry) are made out of austenitic steel, often 316L and 316LVM compliant to ASTM F138,.316 surgical steel is used in the manufacture and handling of food and pharmaceutical products where it is often required in order to minimize metallic contamination. ASTM F138-compliant steel is also used in the manufacture of body piercing jewellery and body modification implants.|$|E
50|$|In anthropometric {{correction}} (extension), {{the alignment}} of the legs takes about 17 days after the initial operation, followed by a period of <b>bone</b> <b>fixation</b> during which time the patient wears the apparatus continuously until advised otherwise. Depending on the patient's abilities, this may take 45-65 days. After removal of the apparatus, the patient should avoid extensive loads on their legs as well as wearing high heeled shoes for about two months. Legs take the final form 7-8 months after the operation. In anthropometric distraction (lengthening) the process may continue depending on the length desired. The legs may be lengthened at most one millimeter per day. At present, the average period of lengthening in patients takes 3-6 months. The whole process may take 7-9 months. About {{three months after the}} removal of apparatus, a patient may feel great discomfort which is usually eliminated through therapeutic and physical exercises like physiotherapy or anaerobic activities such as swimming.|$|E
5000|$|In 1947 Leksell visited Wycis in Philadelphia and than {{developed}} and described his instrument in a publication in 1949 {{and this was}} the first example of a stereotactic system based on the principle of ‘‘center-of-arc’’. In contrast to the Cartesian coordinate system of the Spiegel-Wycis device, Leksell’s frame employed used three polar coordinates (angle, depth and anterior-posterior location). This ‘‘arc-quadrant’’ device provided maximum flexibility in choosing probe entry point and trajectory, and was therefore much easier to use. The frame has been modified over the ensuing years, but remarkably remains very similar in function and appearance to the original 1949 device. The use of a movable semi-arc with an electrode carrier implies that the tip of a probe can reach the target regardless of the position of the carrier or the angling of the arc relative to the skull fixation device, a frame or base plate with bars for <b>bone</b> <b>fixation</b> screws. This construction permits also transphenoidal, straight lateral and suboccipital probe approaches.Leksell was in many respects a perfectionist {{and for the rest of}} his life he continued to change and revise the design of virtually every small part of his instrument though the basic semicircular frame was retained. He focused not only on upgrading the function of the instrument but also on its aesthetic appearance. An important feature was that ‘‘the apparatus should be easy to handle and practical in routine clinical work’’ and ‘‘a high degree of exactitude is necessary.’’ An oft-cited quotation is ‘‘Tools used by the surgeon must be adapted to the task and where the human brain is concerned, no tool can be too refined.’’ ...|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe {{incidence}} of femoral fracture on hip prosthesis is increasing. Plate fixation is {{the method of}} choice when the prosthesis is stable. In fracture with proximal extension, {{the quality of the}} <b>bone</b> <b>fixation</b> is critical and, despite the development of anatomic plates, may be endangered when there are too few proximal screws. To resolve this issue, we recommend using a reversed LCP™ anatomic distal femoral Less Invasive Stabilization System (LISS™) locking plate: e. g., a left distal femoral plate for femoral fracture on right-hip implant. This presents several advantages: minimally invasive surgery, the introduction of the plate being facilitated by the LISS™ ancillary; ease of locking, also thanks to the ancillary; and, above all, multiple proximal trochanteric fixation thanks to the form of this anatomic distal LISS™ plate, improving proximal <b>bone</b> <b>fixation.</b> The present technical note seeks to illustrate the interest of using a “reversed” plate, in terms of simplicity of fitting and quality of reduction and consolidation, while also specifying the associated limitations and tolerance...|$|E

The first phase aim was to describe the length, internal and external diameter, cancellous bone volume/extent and cortical bone thickness at predetermined locations in the radius and ulna in a cohort of skeletally mature and disease-free cat cadavers using radiography and computed tomography. This phase provided a morphometric description of normal cat antebrachii and served as reference for implant selection for the second phase. The aim of the second phase was to compare the biomechanical properties of three constructs for dual <b>bone</b> <b>fixation</b> (DBF) in a cat ex vivo antebrachial, fracture-gap model. Twelve cat cadaver antebrachii were radiographed to confirm normal skeletal appearance and maturity. Antebrachii were allocated for application of one of three constructs in an incomplete randomised block design (n= 8 /group); 10 -hole 1. 5 / 2. 0 mm Synthes® LCP radial plate (P); Plate and 1. 2 mm ulna intramedullary pin (PI) and Plate with an 8 -hole 1. 5 / 2. 0 mm orthogonal Synthes® ulna LCP plate (PP). Dual <b>bone</b> <b>fixation</b> constructs were PP and PI with P used as a control. Constructs were tested in non-destructive mediolateral and caudocranial four point bending, axial compression and finally axial compression to failure. Dual <b>bone</b> <b>fixation</b> constructs (PI and PP) were significantly stiffer (P< 0. 001) than P in axial compression and caudocranial bending.
