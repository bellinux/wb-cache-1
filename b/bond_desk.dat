50|$|The {{secondary}} {{market for a}} variety of assets can vary from loans to stocks, from fragmented to centralized, and from illiquid to very liquid.

Exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange, London Stock Exchange and Nasdaq provide a centralized, liquid secondary market for the investors who own stocks that trade on those exchanges.

50|$|When Gutfreund was CEO of Salomon Brothers, a major scandal {{took place}} {{regarding}} the way Treasury bond trading {{was done by}} Salomon. Paul Mozer, head of the Government <b>Bond</b> <b>desk,</b> was submitting bids in excess of what was allowed by the Treasury rules. When this was discovered and {{brought to the attention}} of Gutfreund, he did not immediately suspend Mr. Mozer. The exposure of Mr. Mozer's repeated violations of U.S. government bond auction rules resulted in a significant scandal during which regulators and some politicians called on the firm to be stripped of its Primary Dealer status. This action would have threatened the survival of the firm, then the largest participant in the U.S. government and mortgage bond trading markets. Warren Buffett, who through Berkshire Hathaway had recently acquired a $900 million preferred equity position in Salomon, actively intervened to protect his investment, including briefly serving as CEO of Salomon Brothers. As a result of the scandal, Gutfreund and other senior managers of Salomon were forced to resign in 1991.|$|E

5000|$|Shortly {{after the}} merger, O'Donnell would retire and Summers would gain the Chairman's title along with CEO. Summers would retain both title {{for more than}} a year after the merger, and Clutterbuck would become President in 1998. Affectionately known as [...] "Clutter" [...] by friends and colleagues, Clutterbuck was an effective, {{hands-on}} manager, who also began with the firm as an intern on the muni <b>bond</b> <b>desk</b> within fixed income while he was in college. He joined the firm in June 1974 and in April 1977 was named the second youngest partner in firm history. [...] Later, Summers would pass the CEO mantle to Clutterbuck in 2000 but would remain chairman. [...] Although very popular with the rank-and-file, Clutterbuck's constant battles with the bank to preserve the McD culture made him no friends in Key Tower. Moreover, Clutterbuck refused to forgo his minimum annual bonus for 2001, despite the decision by the rest of Key's senior management to forsake bonuses following a difficult operating year. Thus, Clutterbuck received $1.289 million bonus pursuant to employment agreement signed as part of the merger, according to KeyCorp's 2002 proxy statement. This led to his quick demise.|$|E
