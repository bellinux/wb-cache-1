500|$|Nunn {{also became}} an {{advocate}} of legalizing industrial hemp in Kentucky, writing, [...] "Frankly, I was opposed to the legalization of hemp for years <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> of the opinion hemp was marijuana. I was short-sighted in my thinking, and I was wrong." [...] In 2000, Nunn secured an acquittal for actor Woody Harrelson, who came to Lee County, Kentucky, and planted hemp seeds in open defiance of Kentucky's law forbidding the cultivation of hemp. [...] Later, he traveled to South Dakota where, {{at the base of}} Mount Rushmore, he publicly presented an Oglala Lakota leader with bales of hemp after the tribe's crop was confiscated by officers from the federal Drug Enforcement Administration.|$|E
500|$|Constructing the Munitions and Main Navy Buildings was an idea {{conceived}} by Franklin D. Roosevelt, then the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, who put forth {{the idea to}} President Woodrow Wilson. [...] Roosevelt originally suggested a temporary building {{be placed on the}} Ellipse, but President Wilson disliked the idea of a building on the White House's front lawn. [...] Thus, Roosevelt suggested placing the buildings on the National Mall (Potomac Park) along B Street (renamed Constitution Avenue in 1931), near the Lincoln Memorial. [...] Roosevelt wanted them to be ugly wooden buildings, so that people would want to tear them down right away after World War I. [...] However, to make the buildings more fire resistant, concrete and steel materials were recommended. Roosevelt later expressed regret for allowing these building to be constructed, saying in 1941, [...] "I didn't think I would ever be let into the Gates of Heaven, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> responsible for desecrating the parks of Washington." ...|$|E
500|$|Blood Sugar Sex Magik {{integrated}} the band's typical punk and funk style, but {{moved away}} from this with more melodically driven songs. Tracks like [...] "The Righteous and the Wicked", [...] "Suck My Kiss", [...] "Blood Sugar Sex Magik", [...] "Give it Away" [...] and [...] "Funky Monks" [...] still incorporated use of heavy metal guitar riffs, but differed from Mother's Milk in that they contained less distortion. Flea, who had centered his bass playing around the slapping technique, downplayed on this {{in favor of more}} traditional and melodic bass lines. He also adopted a minimalist, [...] "less is more" [...] philosophy: [...] "I was trying to play simply on Blood Sugar Sex Magik <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> playing too much prior to that, so I thought, 'I've really got to chill out and play half as many notes'. When you play less, it's more exciting—there's more room for everything. If I do play something busy, it stands out, instead of the bass being a constant onslaught of notes. Space is good." [...] Kiedis felt that the album would expand the Chili Peppers' musical horizons, and that it was a departure from their previous material. One of Blood Sugar Sex Magiks more melodic tracks, [...] "Breaking the Girl", was written about Kiedis' constantly shifting relationships. He feared that he was following in his father's footsteps and simply becoming a womanizer, rather than establishing stable and long-term relationships: [...] "...As exciting and temporarily fulfilling as this constant influx of interesting and beautiful girls can be, {{at the end of the}} day, that shit is lonely and you're left with nothing." [...] The track also featured a bridge in the middle, consisting of percussion instruments salvaged from a garbage dump.|$|E

2500|$|Flea's bass playing {{has changed}} {{considerably}} throughout the years. When he joined Fear, his technique centered largely on punk rock bass lines; however, {{he was to}} change this style when the Red Hot Chili Peppers formed. He began to incorporate a [...] "slap" [...] bass style that drew influence largely from Bootsy Collins. However, this technique caused Flea to receive attention from the music world and was often copied, and he, therefore, {{felt it necessary to}} almost completely remove slap-bass styles from his repertoire following Mother's Milk (1989). Consequently, Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991) saw a notable shift in style as it featured less of his signature technique and more styles that focused on traditional and melodic roots. His intellectual beliefs on how to play the instrument were also altered: [...] "I was trying to play simply on Blood Sugar Sex Magik <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> playing too much prior to that, so I thought, 'I've really got to chill out and play half as many notes'.

2500|$|Flea's {{electric}} bass {{style is}} an amalgamation of funk, psychedelic, punk, and hard rock. The groove-heavy, low-tuned melodies, played through either finger-picking, or slapping, {{contributed to their}} signature style. While Flea's slap bass style was prominent in earlier albums, albums after Blood Sugar Sex Magik have more melodic and funk-driven bass lines. He has also used double stops on some newer songs.

2500|$|At 15:04 {{my flight}} was {{attacked}} by three MiGs, two from the ‘10 o’clock’ and one from the ´6 o’clock´. Initially I didn’t see this last one <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> concentrating on those approaching head-on. My WSO excitedly warned me about this rapidly approaching MiG, which was within firing range of my #3 and #4. I hesitated a while before interrupting my attack against the two MiGs in front, because I had seen the ‘Olds’ flight passing below us a few seconds before. I thought that the plane seen by my WSO {{could be one of}} them. Despite that, I suddenly turned left and then right, and caught sight of the third MiG. I ordered to my numbers 3 and 4 to break right. [...] As they did so, the MiG broke left for some mysterious reason and for a split second we were side by side. [...] We were so close that, besides the red stars in his wings, I could clearly see the pilot’s face. [...] I began a horizontal barrel roll to get away from him and into an attack position, once in position, I launched a Sidewinder. [...] The missile missed because the evading MiG broke left at full throttle. [...] But when he did it, he put himself {{in the line of fire}} of my number 2, Captain Everett T. Raspberry. [...] I ordered him to follow the prey, because the two aircraft that I initially saw had been placed in my forward sector. [...] I was in an advantageous position, so I fired two AIM-9s against them in a quick sequence, and I turned to place myself as wingman of my #2, Captain Raspberry. [...] I kept on descending besides Captain Raspberry and I remember that I thought that he was still out of the optimal launching envelope. But he performed a barrel roll that placed him in a perfect position again and he launched an AIM-9 which hit against the tail section of the MiG-21. It was shaken violently and later fell in a slow, almost plane spin.|$|E
