The back plate also increases the rigidity of whole set-up, supports the housing, and protects it from foreign materials like dust and other road debris. It absorbs the torque from the braking action, {{and that is why}} back plate is also called the [...] "Torque Plate". Since all braking operations exert pressure on the backing plate, it must be strong and wear-resistant. Levers for emergency or parking brakes, and automatic <b>brake-shoe</b> adjuster were also added in recent years.|$|E

The friction materials produced by power metallurgy technology {{have a lot of}} advantages, such as good wear resistance, better thermal conductivity, bearing high lord, work reliably and so on. So they are used widely in the fields such as auto industry, aerospace and so on. The application of metal powder metallurgy technology in preparation friction materials of railway vehicles was researched in this paper, such as <b>brake-shoe,</b> brake lining of train braking, pantograph slide of electric locomotive, electrify boots slider of the maglev train and so on. This kind of friction material has superior performance and better prospects...|$|E

Air samples were taken and dustlevels {{determined}} according to OSHA code,revealing a dust load in weighting and shooting saloons ranging from 2 to 16. 88 mg/nr Measurement and counting of asbestos fibers were done using OSHA ID 160 / code and permissible exposure levels. Asbestos fiber counts in sampled areas were higher than the time weighted average level (TWA) and even higher than action level. Particle size distribution was also determined. It turned out that of the 3000 counted particles,% 90 of non-fibers and % 10 are fiber-shaped. Also size of % 60. 4 of counted fibers is lower than 10 x that % 80 of them are fibers. The results of this study showed significantly thai the maximum pollution loads occur in the weighting section, especially in the mixers. Heavy pollutant load. low air flow (face velocity) and use of canopies with the lowest enclosure may be regarded as potential mechanisms...|$|E
