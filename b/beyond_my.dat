500|$|Cowell, who had {{encountered}} Ornstein while studying in New York, would pursue a similarly radical style {{as part of}} a grand intellectual and cultural mission, which also involved ambitious writings on music theory and publishing and promotional efforts in support of the avant-garde. Ornstein, the vanguard iconoclast of American classical music, followed a much more idiosyncratic muse: [...] "I'm guided entirely by just my musical instinct as to what I feel is consequential or inconsequential." [...] Evidence of that is the fact that, even {{at the height of his}} ultra-modernist notoriety, he also wrote several lyrical, tonal works, such as the First Sonata for Cello and Piano: [...] " [...] was written in less than a week under a compulsion that was not to be resisted", Ornstein later said. [...] "Why I should have heard this romantic piece at the same period that I was tumultuously involved in the primitivism of [...] is <b>beyond</b> <b>my</b> understanding." [...] Commenting on the piece after Ornstein's death approximately three-quarters of a century later, critic Martin Anderson wrote that it [...] "rivals Rachmaninov's [...] in gorgeous tunes." ...|$|E
500|$|Titanic {{suffered}} backlash {{in addition}} to its success. In 2003, the film topped a poll of [...] "Best Film Endings", and yet it also topped a poll by Film 2003 as [...] "the worst movie of all time". The British film magazine Empire reduced their rating of the film from the maximum five stars and an enthusiastic review, to four stars with a less positive review in a later edition, to accommodate its readers' tastes, who wanted to disassociate themselves from the hype surrounding the film, and the reported activities of its fans, such as those attending multiple screenings. In addition to this, positive and negative parodies and other such spoofs of the film abounded and were circulated on the internet, often inspiring passionate responses from fans of various opinions of the film. Benjamin Willcock of DVDActive.com did not understand the backlash or the passionate hatred for the film. [...] "What really irks me...," [...] he said, [...] "are those who make nasty stabs at those who do love it." [...] Willcock stated, [...] "I obviously don't have anything against those who dislike Titanic, but those few who make you feel small and pathetic for doing so (and they do exist, trust me) are way <b>beyond</b> <b>my</b> understanding and sympathy." ...|$|E
500|$|Jack and Helen were {{initiated}} into the Agape Lodge, the renamed Church of Thelema, in February 1941. Parsons adopted the Thelemic motto of Thelema Obtenteum Proedero Amoris Nuptiae, a Latin mistranslation of [...] "The establishment of Thelema through {{the rituals of}} love". The initials of this motto spelled out T.O.P.A.N., also serving as the declaration [...] "To Pan". Commenting on Parsons' errors of translation, in jest Crowley said that [...] "the motto which you mention is couched in a language <b>beyond</b> <b>my</b> powers of understanding". Parsons also adopted the Thelemic title Frater T.O.P.A.N—with T.O.P.A.N represented in Kabbalistic numerology as 210the name with which he frequently signed letters to occult associates—while Helen became known as Soror Grimaud. Smith wrote to Crowley saying that Parsons was [...] "a really excellent man... He has an excellent mind and much better intellect than myself... JP {{is going to be}} very valuable". Wolfe wrote to German O.T.O. representative Karl Germer that Parsons was [...] "an A1 man... Crowleyesque in attainment as a matter of fact", and mooted Parsons as a potential successor to Crowley as Outer Head of the Order. Crowley concurred with such assessments, informing Smith that Parsons [...] "is the most valued member of the whole Order, with no exception!" ...|$|E

500|$|Even {{with his}} First Nations allies, Brock was outnumbered {{approximately}} two to one. He {{decided to use}} tricks to intimidate Hull. He dressed his militia contingent in uniforms discarded by his regulars, making it appear (at a distance) as if his force consisted entirely of British regular infantry. Brock laid siege to Fort Detroit, from established artillery positions across the river in Sandwich. Through a carefully crafted series of marches, he gave the appearance of having much more numerous forces. He had Tecumseh's forces cross {{in front of the}} fort several times (doubling back under cover), intimidating Hull with the show of a large, raucous, barely controlled group of First Nations warriors. Finally, he sent Hull a letter demanding his surrender, in which he stated, in part, [...] "It is far from my inclination to join in a war of extermination, but you must be aware that the numerous body of Indians who have attached themselves to my troops will be <b>beyond</b> <b>my</b> control the moment the contest commences." [...] Brock hammered the fort with cannon fire. On 16 August, the day after receiving Brock's letter, Hull surrendered. Hull, elderly and without recent military experience, was terrified that the civilian population of the fort, including his own daughter and grandson, would face torture {{at the hands of the}} First Nations.|$|E
500|$|At 21:30 on 12 September, the Japanese cruiser [...] {{and three}} destroyers shelled the Lunga {{perimeter}} for 20 minutes and illuminated the ridge with a searchlight. Japanese artillery began shelling the Marine lines, but did little damage. At the same time, scattered groups of Kawaguchi's troops began skirmishing with Marines around the ridge. Kawaguchi's 1st Battalion—led by Major Yukichi Kokusho—attacked the Raider's [...] "C" [...] company between the lagoon and the Lunga River, overrunning {{at least one}} platoon and forcing the Marine company to fall back to the ridge. Kokusho's unit became entangled with troops from Kawaguchi's 3rd Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Kusukichi Watanabe, who were still struggling to reach their attack positions, and the resulting confusion effectively stopped the Japanese attack on the ridge that night. Kawaguchi, who was having trouble locating where he was {{in relation to the}} U.S. Marine lines as well as coordinating his troops' attacks, later complained, [...] "Due to the devilish jungle, the brigade was scattered all over and was completely <b>beyond</b> <b>my</b> control. In my whole life I have never felt so disappointed and helpless." [...] Twelve U.S. Marines were killed; Japanese casualties are unknown but perhaps somewhat greater. Although both Oka in the west and the Kuma unit in the east tried to attack the Marine lines that night, they failed to make contact and halted near the Marine lines at dawn.|$|E
500|$|For the {{flashback}} {{scene at}} the Tower of Joy, actor Robert Aramayo was cast to play a young Eddard Stark. In an interview with Access Hollywood, Aramayo stated {{that he was a}} big fan of the series, and that [...] "it was an honor and a gift {{to be able to be}} a part of it." [...] In regards to portraying the character similar to Sean Bean, who played Eddard Stark in the first season, Aramayo noted, [...] "I didn't want to get too hung up in sounding like Sean because I think that would've sort of got in my way if I'd have just situated all my work in that place. I watched a lot of footage of him playing Ned in the first season again, repeatedly, especially one particular fight scene that he was in and I think that was the biggest help for me when creating this version of Ned – was watching what Sean did with Ned in the first season and trying to work out what a younger man's version of that is." [...] In a separate interview with The Hollywood Reporter Aramayo spoke about auditioning for the role, stating, [...] "The chance to audition to be on the show was a dream, even to audition. It was an absolute dream to me. I was very excited to audition, and landing the role was <b>beyond</b> <b>my</b> wildest dreams. Then when I found out the role was Ned, it was overwhelming." ...|$|E

He turned it down, citing [...] "reasons <b>beyond</b> <b>my</b> control". This cryptic response led to charges among the National Party (and the press) that the U.S. had pressured López Arellano {{not to participate in}} the election, because of Kennedy's opposition to military governments. The eventual nominee of the National Party, Ramón Ernesto Cruz, had served past dictatorships and was not popular with farmers, organized labor, or liberals in San Pedro Sula. Ernesto Cruz's chances were weaked further when General Carías Andino formed a splinter party (the Popular Progressive Party).|$|E
2500|$|In 1908, he competed at the London Olympic Games and won {{the gold}} medal in doubles {{alongside}} Reginald Doherty. However, although being great fan of the Olympics in general, he was less enthusiastic about the idea of tennis being a part of it.

You could as well have Olympic cricket or Olympic golf. It is difficult to believe that players or public can treat the matter seriously or care two straws about it.

At Hill's suggestion he hired William Cornelius Van Horne to construct three major sections of the track, and his partnership with James Ross proved invaluable to the engineering success of the railway. However, {{by the end of}} 1881, Stephen admitted that the project was [...] "assuming dimensions far <b>beyond</b> <b>my</b> calculations". He ceased all other activities, and bringing R.B.

[...] For nearly two months he was kept in Warwick Prison, and during that time a great meeting was held, when Birmingham Town Hall was filled from end to end, and so many came from far and near to protest against the imprisonment; the singing of the [...] "Church's one Foundation" [...] at the end was something impressive and touching.” ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{promising}} {{and intelligent}} youth, Morgan contracted meningitis in August 1929. The disease {{left him with}} a total loss of hearing. Emily Morgan kept him home from school for an entire year, hoping that some hearing would return. Deafness cut off his ability to relate to people around him. The once popular, social, and athletic boy became socially introverted, devoting much of his time to reading and study. Morgan recalled that he had not yet reconciled himself to his deafness by the time he returned to school. In 1951, in a letter to Marguerite Sinclair Reusser, he wrote that a minor family crisis in March 1931 led to a hysterical outburst. During this emotional time, Morgan finally confided in his mother the difficulties and fears he had faced over the loss of his hearing. [...] "I began to face the future instead of wasting myself in bitter regret over a past that was <b>beyond</b> <b>my</b> reach. That was the beginning of my adjustment to the fact that my hearing was gone and would probably never return." [...] At this time, he began a lifelong pattern of writing, producing thousands of careful transcriptions, personal letters, and books in his field.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Napoleon {{spent the}} night of 29/30 October at Isenburg castle, near Gelnhausen, and {{received}} detailed intelligence about the Austro-Bavarian preparations, which confirmed that the enemy was intending to make a stand. Napoleon thus directed the army's baggage and supply train northwards, away from the coalition forces, {{under the protection of}} Jean-Toussaint Arrighi de Casanova's Cavalry Corps, while leading his remaining forces in a frontal manoeuvre against Wrede's force. He ordered Victor to form the left wing with his Army Corps and march along the Kinzig, while MacDonald's Corps and the Guard were to penetrate the Lamboi forest. Part of the Guard cavalry under General Charles Lefebvre-Desnouettes was detached further north to cover the flank of the army. Napoleon studied Wrede's position and spotted its main weakness, namely that he had most of his army deployed with the river behind it, which would act as a natural barrier should retreat be necessary. Upon seeing Wrede's dispositions, Napoleon sarcastically noted: [...] "I have made Wrede a Count but it was <b>beyond</b> <b>my</b> power to make him a General." [...] However, in order to exploit this potentially fatal weakness in Wrede's deployment, Napoleon first had to beat him, and do so with an inferior number of infantry, less cavalry and fewer cannons, fighting against an enemy who had all the time it needed to deploy its forces for defense.|$|E
