40|$|In {{the work}} {{described}} in this thesis, the absorption performance of flexible micro-perforated panels with finite-depth air <b>backing</b> <b>spaces</b> has been studied experimentally and analytically. Perforated materials are relatively stiff and robust compared to fibrous materials from a structural point-of-view and can perform as well as fibrous materials in certain frequency ranges when combined with a finite-depth air backing. To predict the acoustical performance of perforated panels, several models were developed. The modeling effort was divided into two types, based on the assumed size of sample: finite or infinite. For the finite model, it is also divided into two parts: normal incidence in a duct, and arbitrary incidence angles in free space with an infinite array of finite-size, flexible micro-perforated panel with segmented and unsegmented <b>backing</b> <b>spaces.</b> For the infinite size sample, the Maa model, which is a well known theory for the impedance of rigid micro-perforated panels, was studied. Though the Maa model works reasonably well, the panel {{is assumed to be}} rigid in his model which can cause differences between measurements and predictions, especially for lightweight materials. In the experiments, the absorption coefficient and transmission loss of various samples were measured in an impedance tube. A model was developed for the finite-sized samples by making use of two frequency-dependent properties: the end correction and flow resistance. According to the results, the absorption performance of finite-size, perforated membranes can be tuned to a certain frequency range by adjusting hole size, number of holes per unit area, hole depth, mass per unit area of the material, flexural stiffness and size of the panel. The air backing depth is another important parameter determining the location of the absorption peak. As the <b>backing</b> <b>space</b> increases, the low frequency absorption increases. In the arbitrary incidence angle model, segmented and unsegmented <b>backing</b> <b>spaces</b> were studied and it was found that a segmented <b>backing</b> <b>space</b> generated a locally reacting field that causes higher absorption at lower frequencies. From the comparison between measurement and prediction, {{it was found that the}} predictions and measurements showed reasonable agreement. ...|$|R

Harmony is expressed through movement between tension and release, as expressions of dissonance and consonance, and between the more inwardly directed minor mood and the outwardly directed major mood. Rhythm is chiefly conveyed through livelier and more contoured movements for quick notes, slower, dreamier movements for longer notes; in addition, longer tones move into the more passive (listening) <b>back</b> <b>space,</b> quicker tones into the more active front space.|$|E
50|$|After the Iraq War, the Army began researching {{engineering}} change proposals (ECPs) for the M2 Bradley to buy <b>back</b> <b>space,</b> weight, power, and cooling capacity {{reduced by the}} addition of armor and electronics hastily added during combat. ECP1 will work to restore mobility and allow the vehicle to handle more weight. As weight increased, the Bradley got lower on its shocks, which reduced ground clearance. This decreased mobility on rough terrain and left it more vulnerable to IEDs. The effort will install lighter tracks, shock absorbers, a new suspension support system, and heavy weight torsion bars. ECP2 will restore automotive power with a larger engine, a new transmission, and a smart-power management system for better electrical power distribution to accept future networked tactical radio and battle command systems. The first Bradleys upgraded with ECP1 were fielded in mid-2015, and the first to be upgraded with ECP2 will begin fielding in 2018.|$|E

Participants listened to a series of auditory stimuli from the conditions of colours, shapes and full objects, presented randomly to a speaker in front of the head or to a speaker behind the head, and were then given a series of visual representations from which to choose which of these images represented one of the stimuli they had heard.

If in case, the key is lost or stolen then anyone can open the lock using the key.
