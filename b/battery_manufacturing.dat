40|$|Abstract — Rechargeable {{battery is}} {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} main electric energy storage devices. Due to the problem of posible shortage of energy resources, cost or enviromental cosiderations, a power saving and energy efficient devices become frequent request and important need. Therefore, within this apaer a single phase battery charger / discharger set is proposed, which operates in two different modes. An empty battery is charged directly from ac source through the control of a PWM rectifier converter, followed by a dc/dc buck regulator in the first mode, which is called charging mode. Second mode is discharging mode, as the set is utilized to discharge and transfer the energy from a charged battery to charge another empty battery, hence a power saving has been obtained. Such charging and discharging operations could be frequently required, particularly during <b>batteries</b> <b>manufacturing,</b> tests, maintenance and also can be adopted to be utilized withn recent vechicle to grid applications. The proposed PWM rectifier offers a sinusoidal supply current at unity power factor and improves the total harmonic distortion during the two modes of operations, hence providing high power quality operating conditions. The proposed set is simulated using PSCAD software to evaluate the system performance. Furthermore, experimental setup of the proposed system is implemented and experimental results have been agreed with simulation results, validating the proposed set for practical applications.

40|$|International audienceIn {{the present}} paper, the {{deposition}} processes and formation of films in SF 6 ion-ion plasma, with {{positive and negative}} ion flows accelerated to the surface, are investigated. The PEGASES (acronym for Plasma Propulsion with Electronegative GASES) source is used as an ion-ion plasma source capable of generating almost ideal ion-ion plasma with negative ion to electron density ratio more than 2500. It is shown that film deposition in SF 6 ion-ion plasma is very sensitive to the polarity of the incoming ions. The effect is observed for Cu, W, and Pt materials. The films formed on Cu electrodes during negative and positive ion assisted deposition were analyzed. Scanning electron microscope analysis has shown that {{both positive and negative}} ion fluxes influence the copper surface and leads to film formation, but with different structures of the surface: the low-energy positive ion bombardment causes the formation of a nano-pored film transparent for ions, while the negative ion bombardment leads to a continuous smooth insulating film. The transversal size of the pores in the porous film varies in the range 50  500 &# 8201;nm, and further analysis of the film has shown that the film forms a diode together with the substrate preventing positive charge drain, and positive ions are neutralized by passing through the nano-pores. The film obtained with the negative ion bombardment has an insulating surface, but probably with a multi-layer structure: destroying the top surface layer allows to measure similar diode IV-characteristics as for the nano-pored film case. Basing on results, practical conclusions for the probes and electrodes cleaning in ion-ion SF 6 plasmas have been made. Different applications are proposed for the discovered features of the controlled deposition from ion-ion plasmas, from Li-sulphur rechargeable <b>batteries</b> <b>manufacturing</b> and nanofluidics issues to the applications for microelectronics, including low-k materials formation...|$|R
