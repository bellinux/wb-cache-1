5|$|As the {{financial}} crisis of 2007–08 reached a peak with the liquidity crisis of September 2008, Clinton supported the proposed <b>bailout</b> <b>of</b> the U.S. financial system, voting {{in favor of the}} $700billion law that created the Troubled Asset Relief Program, saying that it represented the interests of the American people. It passed the Senate 74–25.|$|E
5|$|Romney {{supported}} the Bush administration's Troubled Asset Relief Program {{in response to}} the late-2000s financial crisis, later saying that it prevented the U.S. financial system from collapsing. During the U.S. automotive industry crisis of 2008–10, he opposed a <b>bailout</b> <b>of</b> the industry in the form of direct government intervention, and argued that a managed bankruptcy of struggling automobile companies should instead be accompanied by federal guarantees for post-bankruptcy financing from the private sector.|$|E
5|$|Although a {{potential}} local ownership group was identified in late February, local {{opposition to a}} perceived <b>bailout</b> <b>of</b> multi-millionaire ownership began to take hold. A citizens opposition group called Don't Target Us (referencing the Target Center in their name) formed to voice their opposition to a public purchase of the facility. Additionally, polling at the time showed support for public intervention as being unfavorable with 60 {{percent of those polled}} being against intervention. However support for intervention on the arena issue began to take shape as well with several at the local and state level stating their intention to make a deal happen. Additionally, businesses near the arena starting a campaign to keep the team in Minneapolis.|$|E

5|$|By November 1998, UBS's {{losses from}} its {{exposure}} to LTCM were estimated {{at the level}} of approximately CHF 790million. UBS would prove to be the largest single loser in the LTCM collapse, ultimately writing off CHF 950million. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized a <b>bailout</b> <b>of</b> US$3.625billion by the hedge fund's major creditors to avoid a wider collapse in the financial markets. UBS contributed US$300million to the bailout effort, which would largely be recovered. In the aftermath of the LTCM collapse, Mathis Cabiallavetta resigned as chairman of UBS, along with three other executives.|$|E
5|$|This period saw a {{political}} alignment with the Eastern Bloc countries and a shift toward economic insularity. These policies, coupled with economic pressures {{stemming from the}} 1973 oil crisis, resulted in the rapid collapse of Madagascar's economy and {{a sharp decline in}} living standards, and the country had become completely bankrupt by 1979. The Ratsiraka administration accepted the conditions of transparency, anti-corruption measures and free market policies imposed by the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and various bilateral donors in exchange for their <b>bailout</b> <b>of</b> the nation's broken economy.|$|E
5|$|Ethnic tension {{continued}} to grow shortly after Mahathir narrowly defeated Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah for the UMNO Presidency in 1987. Around this time, several deposit-taking co-operatives (DTCs), some associated with the MCA, collapsed. To save Chinese investors, the MCA asked the government to bail out the DTCs, citing a previous <b>bailout</b> <b>of</b> Bumiputra financial institutions. UMNO's reluctance to acquiesce led MCA Deputy President Lee Kim Sai to warn that the MCA might quit the government. Later that year, the government posted several non-Chinese-educated staff to senior positions in Chinese vernacular schools. Anwar Ibrahim, then Education Minister, refused to yield to protests from the MCA, and stated that the decision was final, despite a previous informal agreement on the issue between the Malay and Chinese communities.|$|E

5|$|On June 11, 2008, the CTA {{board was}} {{scheduled}} to hear the city's plan of a three-phase <b>bailout</b> <b>of</b> {{the construction of the}} rapid transit station under block 37. The plan included $20million in additional tax increment financing. This comes on top of an extra $60–70million in excess of its budgeted amount that the CTA has been forces to expend. The building developer, Joseph Freed & Associates, has agreed to accept $19million of cost overruns. This round of assistance only covers costs that have been incurred to date. No further funds have been committed and the station's development is being halted until such funds arise. The original budget was $213million ($173 from CTA) and costs to date have been $320million. As of last year the costs were $150million over budget and the city is seeking private investment. Construction finally began on the third building, the hotel and residences in the end of 2009.|$|E
5|$|By then, Morgan {{was drawn}} into another situation. There was deep {{concern that the}} Trust Company of America and the Lincoln Trust might fail to open on Monday due to {{continuing}} runs by depositors. On Saturday evening 40–50 bankers had gathered at the library to discuss the crisis, with the clearing-house bank presidents in the East room and the trust company executives in the West room. Morgan and those dealing with the Moore & Schley situation {{had moved to the}} librarian’s office. There Morgan told his counselors that he would agree to help shore up Moore & Schley only if the trust companies would work together to bail out their weakest brethren. The discussion among the bankers continued late into Saturday night but without much progress. Around midnight, J.P. Morgan informed a leader of the trust company presidents that keeping Moore & Schley afloat would require $25 million, and he would not commit those funds unless the problems with the trust companies could also be resolved. The trust company executives understood they would not receive further help from Morgan; they would have to finance any <b>bailout</b> <b>of</b> the two struggling trust companies.|$|E
5|$|In December 2007, the United States {{entered the}} longest post–World War II recession, which {{included}} a housing market correction, a subprime mortgage crisis, soaring oil prices, and a declining dollar value. In February, 63,000 jobs were lost, a five-year record. To aid with the situation, Bush signed a $170billion economic stimulus package which was intended to improve the economic situation by sending tax rebate checks to many Americans and providing tax breaks for struggling businesses. The Bush administration pushed for significantly increased regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2003, and after two years, the regulations passed the House but died in the Senate. Many Republican senators, as well as influential members of the Bush Administration, feared that the agency created by these regulations would merely be mimicking the private sector's risky practices. In September 2008, the crisis became much more serious beginning with the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac followed {{by the collapse of}} Lehman Brothers and a federal <b>bailout</b> <b>of</b> American International Group for $85billion.|$|E

40|$|The {{idea that}} strong {{connections}} between investment bank executives and politicians {{leads to a}} government bailout when the bank finds itself struggling with insolvency, otherwise known as crony capitalism, has sparked the interest of scholars and popular writers alike (Bartiromo 2010, Cresswell 2008, Prins 2009, Ritholtz 2009, and Rosas 2006). Research on the <b>bailouts</b> <b>of</b> the 2008 financial crisis in particular has indicated that banks who are politically connected {{are more likely to}} receive aid from the Federal Reserve (Blau 2013). Blau’s paper looks at emergency aid from the Federal Reserve for all types of banks rather than just the investment banks. This paper will look specifically at the <b>bailouts</b> <b>of</b> the investment banks.
