5|$|Approach-avoidance {{conflict}} {{happens when}} a situation is presented that can either be rewarding or punishing, and the ensuing decision-making {{has been associated with}} anxiety. fMRI findings from studies in approach-avoidance decision-making found evidence for a functional role that is not explained by either long-term memory or spatial cognition.

5|$|Deep water coral {{habitats}} {{are also}} threatened by human activities, particularly by indiscriminate trawling. These ecosystems have been little studied, {{but in the}} perpetual darkness and cold temperatures, animals grow and mature slowly and there are relatively fewer fish worth catching than in the sunlit waters above.

5|$|Enzyme {{kinetics}} cannot prove which {{modes of}} catalysis {{are used by}} an enzyme. However, some kinetic data can suggest possibilities to be examined by other techniques. For example, a ping–pong mechanism with burst-phase pre-steady-state kinetics would suggest covalent catalysis might <b>be</b> <b>important</b> in this enzyme's mechanism. Alternatively, the observation of a strong pH effect on Vmax but not Km might indicate that a residue in the active site {{needs to be in}} a particular ionisation state for catalysis to occur.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the roles}} and {{importance}} of {{the various forms of}} vitamin E are presently unclear, and it has even been suggested that the most important function of α-tocopherol is as a signaling molecule, with this molecule having no significant role in antioxidant metabolism. The functions of the other forms of vitamin E are even less well understood, although γ-tocopherol is a nucleophile that may react with electrophilic mutagens, and tocotrienols may <b>be</b> <b>important</b> in protecting neurons from damage.|$|E

However, homoploid hybrid speciation (not {{increasing the}} number of sets of chromosomes) may be rare: by 1997, only 8 natural examples had been fully described. Experimental studies suggest that hybridization offers a rapid route to speciation, a prediction confirmed by the fact that early generation hybrids and ancient hybrid species have matching genomes, meaning that once hybridization has occurred, the new genome can remain stable.|$|E
