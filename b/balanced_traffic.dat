40|$|Abstract — Transport {{in large}} {{networks}} follows near to shortest paths. A shortest path {{depends on the}} topology {{as well as on}} the link weight structure. While much effort has been devoted to understand the properties of the topology of large networks, the influence of link weights on the shortest path received considerably less attention. Here, we first compute analytically and by simulation the effect of shifting the uniform distribution for the link weights from [0, 1] to (a, 1] where a> 0. When a> 0, the properties of the shortest path (hopcount and weight) differ from those of small a close to zero. The difference is shown to be highly related to the topology. Furthermore, by tuning the link weight parimeter a, thetrafficcan be controlled. When a is large, the traffic is more likely to follow the minimum hopcount shortest path, which leads to more <b>balanced</b> <b>traffic</b> traversing the network...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — One of the {{challenges}} in routing for dense Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) is <b>balancing</b> the <b>traffic</b> over different paths. Load-balancing methods inspired by physical phenomena such as electrostatics and optics have been studied in recent years, and the proposed methods are promising in energy-critical routing applications. Such methods model information flow in continuous domain in order to benefit from well-established continuous space optimization methods; however, the existing literature on physics inspired approaches do not address the link between continuous and discrete space models. In this paper, we present a discretization method for linking continuous flow to discrete paths in a dense-WSN. We study a p-norm flow optimization method in continuous domain and show that a fixed-path routing {{is not sufficient to}} completely <b>balance</b> <b>traffic</b> load over the network.

The issues we identified in wireless mobile ad-hoc networks include network partitioning, high signaling overhead, and excessive aggressiveness in handling failures.

40|$|Abstract—Multipath Switching systems (MPS) are {{intensely}} used in state-of-the-art core routers {{to provide}} terabit or even petabit switching capacity. One {{of the most}} intractable issues in designing MPS is how to load <b>balance</b> <b>traffic</b> across its multiple paths while not disturbing the intraflow packet orders. Previous packet-based solutions either suffer from delay penalties or lead to OðN 2 Þ hardware complexity, hence do not scale. Flow-based hashing algorithms also perform badly due to the heavy-tailed flow-size distribution. In this paper, we develop a novel scheme, namely, Flow Slice (FS) that cuts off each flow into flow slices at every intraflow interval larger than a slicing threshold and balances the load on a finer granularity. Based on the studies of tens of real Internet traces, we show that setting a slicing threshold of 1 4 ms, the FS scheme achieves comparative load-balancing performance to the optimal one. It also limits the probability of out-of-order packets to a negligible level (106) on three popular MPSes {{at the cost of}} little hardware complexity and an internal speedup up to two. These results are proven by theoretical analyses and also validated through trace-driven prototype simulations. Index Terms—Load <b>balancing,</b> <b>traffic</b> measurement, switching theory.
