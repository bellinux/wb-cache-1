40|$|Fertility {{control is}} a {{potential}} method to control prairie dog populations in the urban/suburban environment. However, an effective, oral delivery system is needed. We tested a food <b>bait</b> <b>block</b> delivery system that could make baits available to prairie dogs {{over a number of}} days which would make this method more cost-effective than placing food bait by hand near burrows every day. Prairie dogs readily consumed the bait blocks stacked on vertical metal poles during the day. We found, however, that rabbits and mice also consumed the food bait blocks, mainly at night. Over the course of the study, the mean amount removed per site was 81 % of the food bait presented. However, to make the food bait blocks primarily available to prairie dogs, a device that would eliminate access to the food bait blocks at night is needed...|$|E
40|$|Extensive forest {{conversion}} of the low-valued natural hardwood forest into coniferous plantations is the possible cause of the critical problem of squirrel debarking. The tree squirrel that causes the major damage is the red-bellied tree squirrel (Callosciurus erythraeus). Conifers {{are more susceptible to}} the damage than are hardwood species, especially the exotics. Intermediate-aged plantations appear to have the highest debarking. More damage occurs in the spring than the other seasons. The lower part of the trunk is more heavily debarked than the upper. Debarking is progressively upward to the crown as the tree grows older. Home range, food habit and behavior of the red-bellied tree squirrel are under intensive study and some preliminary results have been obtained. Selection of tree species less susceptible to squirrel debarking has been a main step to control the damage. Intensive weeding and thinning may reduce much of the squirrel preferred habitat and therefore reduce damage. Leaving any natural hardwood forest within or adjacent to the coniferous plantations may provide squirrels with a more attractive cover and food supply. A rice-paraffin <b>bait</b> <b>block</b> of warfarin has been used to poison them with some success. But laboratory studies show klerat (brodifacoum) has a faster lethal efficacy than warfarin. Application of baits and other trapping methods to control squirrel populations need more study and evaluation...|$|E
40|$|The fox {{tapeworm}} Echinococcus multilocularis is typically perpetuated in a cycle with red foxes as definitive hosts and various rodent species as intermediate hosts. In this study, foxes were baited {{with a highly}} efficient drug against cestodes (praziquantel) in 5 blocks of 1 km 2. Voles,Arvicola terrestris, the most abundant intermediate host species, were trapped in the 5 <b>baited</b> <b>blocks</b> and in 5 non-baited control <b>blocks.</b> <b>Baiting</b> the foxes reduced the prevalence of E. multilocularis in fox faecal samples in the <b>baited</b> <b>blocks,</b> but voles trapped in the two blocks {{did not differ in}} their infection rates. However, voles from the <b>baited</b> <b>blocks</b> had significantly smaller spleen masses and {{were more likely to be}} infested with mites than those from the control blocks, possibly reflecting different immunological activities. Our study suggests that the environmental contamination with E. multilocularis eggs, and perhaps those of other tapeworms, influences the immune system of the intermediate host species A. terrestris in the wild.

40|$|Once established, {{invasive}} rodents cause significant impacts to island {{flora and}} fauna, including species extinctions. There {{have been numerous}} efforts to eradicate invasive rodents from islands worldwide, with many successes. For a number of reasons, many invasive vertebrates have become established in Florida, including several rodent species. We have implemented rodent eradication efforts on two Florida islands. Using the successful eradication strategy developed for Buck Island, U. S. Virgin Islands, we have attempted the eradication of roof rats from Egmont Key off Tampa Bay. We also are attempting to eradicate Gambian giant pouched rats from Grassy Key in the Florida Keys. On Egmont Key, we used a grid of bait stations containing diphacinone rodenticide <b>bait</b> <b>blocks</b> and hand tossing of <b>bait</b> <b>blocks</b> into thickets. On Grassy Key, we used a grid of bait stations containing a zinc phosphide bait along with intensive live-trapping.

40|$|Nearly 100 % of U. S. {{artichoke}} production {{comes from}} California and {{is concentrated in}} Monterey County. California meadow voles are damaging rodent pests that can threaten the profitability of growing artichokes. A practical population monitoring method can be invaluable to integrated pest management programs for guiding when and where control is needed and assessing control efficacy. The standard method for indexing vole populations in artichoke fields {{has been based on}} observing chewing on artichoke bracts placed throughout the field. Because toxicants are delivered on artichoke bracts, bias for population indexing is potentially introduced. We therefore compared artichoke bracts to nontoxic grain-based wax <b>bait</b> <b>blocks</b> as an alternative chewing medium for eliciting chewing observations for indexing abundance. We also compared the use of binary (presence-absence) observations of chewing to continuous measures (percent chewed). We considered the effect of three sizes of observation grids (4 x 4, 5 x 5, 6 x 6) for indexing. We conducted intensive trapping to determine number of voles known to be alive (KTBA) at each site as a basis for assessing which of the 12 indexing approaches (2 chewing mediums, 2 measurement types, 3 grid sizes) best tracked population abundance. The percent chewed on artichoke bracts for all grid sizes only marginally correlated with KTBA (~ 0. 5), whereas percent chewed on <b>bait</b> <b>blocks</b> correlated very well with KTBA for all grid sizes (~ 0. 9). Reducing continuous data to binary observations produced indices only weakly or negatively correlated with KTBA. Available resources would probably determine whether smaller grid sizes would be used for obtaining chewing observations...|$|R

The rats were causing substantial damage {{to a variety of}} the 80 -ha island’s floral and faunal resources. An island-wide grid of elevated bait stations containing anticoagulant (0. 005 % diphacinone; 50 ppm) rodenticide <b>bait</b> <b>blocks</b> were used to eradicate the rats. The bait stations were modified several times to assure ready access by rats while minimizing access by non-target animals, especially crabs and birds. Numerous post-project trapping sessions over six years resulted in no rat captures, suggesting that, indeed, the rats had been eradicated from the island. No non-target losses resulting from the baiting program were observed by field personnel, but they noted {{what appeared to be a}} recovery of some of the island’s floral and faunal resources. There have been no depredations of endangered sea turtle nests since the eradication. Post-project monitoring sessions revealed the presence of a growing house mouse (Mus musculus) population on the island. The threats posed by, and potential management strategies for, this introduced pest species are being investigated. This is the first successful rat eradication on a sizable island, using diphacinone <b>bait</b> <b>blocks</b> with a unique, elevated bait-station system.

40|$|Within {{the past}} ten years, the roof rat (Rattus rattus) problem in {{residential}} Santa Clara County has developed from an insignificant nuisance to one of major concern. When {{a considerable number of}} complaints to the Santa Clara County Health Department reported roof rats on telephone cables, a study was made of 29 city blocks to determine the feasibility of utility pole baiting as a means of roof rat control. In the baiting process, rat signs were commonly observed on telephone equipment attached to the utility poles. A correlation was observed between bait consumption and the close proximity of vegetation to the telephone cable clamp. Bait consumption profiles on most blocks demonstrated patterns which resembled activity ranges.

40|$|Critically Endangered Puerto Rican parrots Amazona vittata {{are one of}} {{the rarest}} birds in the world. Several exotic mammal species capable of preying on Puerto Rican parrots cohabit the Caribbean National Forest with the only wild {{population}} of these parrots. We used tracking plates, monitoring blocks and trapping to index black rats, small Indian mongooses and feral cats in parrot habitat and in public-use areas in the same habitat type. We had high trap success for black rats at all sites (42 % of all sites combined), among the highest reported in the world. Rat response to monitoring (nontoxic <b>bait)</b> <b>blocks</b> was universally high, regardless of ground or tree placement. Mongooses were present at all sites, with a greater proportion of plates tracked within the forest than at public-use sites. Cats were present at all forest sites and one of the public-use sites. Presence of the three species {{did not appear to be}} linked to human disturbance. Because only 30 – 40 Puerto Rican parrots survive in the wild, with as few as three pairs nesting in 2002, we concluded that the abundance and pervasiveness of exotic mammalian predators poses a greater threat to the parrots than has been generally acknowledged. This is evidenced by mammalian predation during recent parrot breeding seasons, including six fledglings taken by mongooses and one nest failure from rats during 2000 – 2003...|$|R
40|$|A two-choice, taste {{preference}} {{study was conducted}} using 18 northern pocket gophers to evaluate pelleted sorghum, granulated sorghum, and wax <b>block</b> <b>baits</b> containing either 0. 01 to 0. 05 % quinine or 0. 10 to 5. 0 % sucrose. Bait consumption was significantly higher across treatments (P≤. 001) for granulated sorghum, followed by pelleted sorghum, and wax blocks. Gophers also showed a high frequency of moving the granulated bait in their cheek pouches to be deposited at alternate locations within their cages. Although increasing sucrose concentration did not produce significantly (P ≥. 10) enhanced consumption {{for any of the}} baits, a trend toward increasing preference with increased concentration was noted for the wax <b>block</b> <b>bait.</b> During quinine tests, bait consumption was again significantly highest (P≤. 01) for granulated sorghum followed by pelleted sorghum and wax block. Quinine treatment also failed to significantly (P≥. 10) alter bait consumption across the tested concentrations. However, there was a minor trend toward decreasing preference with increasing concentrations in the wax block group. Data indicated that pelleted bait had the advantage of producing more consistent consumption levels without the animals carrying bait in their cheek pouches for caching and subsequent spillage. Although the wax <b>block</b> <b>baits</b> were most influenced by the taste treatments, consumption levels were extremely low. In comparison with most wild rodent species, northern pocket gophers were found to be insensitive or indifferent to both taste stimuli over a wide concentration range...|$|R
40|$|Population {{monitoring}} is {{a valuable}} component to managing invasive rodent populations. Indices can be efficient methods for monitoring rodent populations, as more labor-intensive density estimation procedures often are impractical or invalid to apply. Many monitoring objectives can be couched in an indexing framework. Indexing procedures obtain maximal utility if they exhibit key characteristics, including being practical to apply, being sensitive to population changes or differences in the target species, having an inherent variance formula to estimate precision of index values, and relying on as few assumptions as possible. Here, a general indexing paradigm that promotes the characteristics that make indices most useful is specifically applied to rodent monitoring scenarios. Observations are made at stations located throughout the area of interest. Stations can take many forms, depending on the observations, and range from points for visual counts to tracking plots (or tiles), <b>bait</b> <b>blocks,</b> chew cards, camera stations, trap lines and many others. Thus, {{a wide variety of}} observation methods for many animal species can fit into this format. Observations are made at each station on multiple occasions for each indexing session. Collection of geographic location data for each station is encouraged. No assumptions of independence are made among stations or observation occasions, and measurements made at each station are required to be continuous or unboundedly discrete. The formula for a general index is presented along with a derived variance formula. Issues relevant to the application of this methodology to rodent populations, and indices in general, are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: To {{investigate}} {{the potential for}} mortality or sublethal effects in the tree weta (Hemideina crassidens) {{as the result of}} exposure to baits used for rodent control, and the potential secondary hazard to non-target species, captive weta were offered Ditrac ® wax <b>block</b> <b>bait</b> containing the anticoagulant diphacinone. Bait consumption was recorded daily for the first week and then weekly. Weta were sampled in groups of four following 1, 4, 8, 16, 31, and 64 days of exposure to bait and analysed to determine the concentration of diphacinone residues in their bodies. Any changes in feeding behaviour, survival, and bodyweight were recorded. Weta found Ditrac wax <b>block</b> <b>baits</b> palatable even in the presence of natural plant food, showing steady consumption of bait over time. No mortality or weight loss was attributable to the intake of Ditrac bait. All weta that ate bait had detectable diphacinone in their bodies, but did not accumulate diphacinone, i. e. whole-body concentrations did not increase with the amount of diphacinone bait eaten over time. Field use of diphacinone bait is likely to present a low risk of mortality to weta, but the risk posed by secondary diphacinone exposure to non-target species that eat weta requires further investigation. __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________...|$|R
40|$|Two large (approx. 160 ha) trial sites {{incorporating}} ricefields {{and village}} housing were selected in Laguna Province, Philippines. Flocoumafen 3. 5 -g wax <b>block</b> <b>baits</b> (StormR) {{were applied to}} one site, initially as two area-wide pulses of 80 to 100 blocks/ha and later as spot treatments, to areas of particularly high rat infestation. Baiting {{in and around the}} village houses was already carried out during the first two applications. On average, only 1. 175 kg/ha/season of flocoumafen <b>block</b> <b>bait</b> gave good rodent control resulting in significant decreases in crop damage (% cut tillers) compared to the untreated area. The overall yield increase was estimated to be 13 t of grain, equivalent to total added benefit of P 39, 000 (approx US$ 1, 950) or P 253 (approx. US$ 13) per ha. Few domestic animals were attracted to the bait and no casualties were reported. Only one dog was seen eating bait but this animal did not develop symptoms of poisoning. None of the wild animals observed regularly during the trial showed significant decreases in numbers after baiting. With the exception of two shrews (Suncus sp.) all animal carcasses found were those of the target rodent pests.

40|$|Poison {{operations}} are a widely used technique for rodent {{control in the}} indigenous forests of New Zealand. This study examined the bait-take and rat monitoring data obtained for continuous poison operations at Boundary Stream Mainland Island (BSMI), Hawke’s Bay, between 1996 and 2007. Since {{the beginning of the}} Mainland Island project at BSMI in 1996, 800 ha of indigenous forest have been treated with an ‘Integrated Pest Management’ approach, in which rodents (primarily ship rats) have been targeted by consecutive ground poison operations. The aim of the intensive pest control was to allow the ecosystem to recover and provide a safe environment for threatened native bird species to recover or be re-introduced. Another important aim of this pest control is to provide experience and expert knowledge in management techniques especially applicable to the protection of indigenous habitat on the New Zealand mainland. This research study had two main aims: to identify spatial patterns of the rodent population at BSMI and to determine the efficacy of the different rodenticides applied for their control. The distribution of the rodent population was investigated by spatial analysis of bait-take across the reserve and through time. Visualisation of high and low bait-take areas revealed that there was a noticeable reinvasion from adjacent unmanaged native forests, but not markedly from exotic forest or pasture. Reinvasion from small and isolated adjacent forests ceased to be noticeable consistently after approximately four years of the poison operation, while a large scenic native reserve, as well as a narrow part of the treatment area surrounded by many native bush patches, were continuously affected by reinvasion through the entire project time. Bait-take was visibly higher after the bait had either been removed, or left in the field unserviced, over winter. No consistent areas of no bait-take were identified. Further statistical analysis of bait-take data revealed that bait-take was higher in bait stations within 150 m of the treatment edge than interior bait stations. Bait-take in broadleaf/tawa/podocarp forest was significantly higher than in kamahi/kanuka/rewarewa, beech and cloud-cap forest. The second aim {{of the study was to}} determine the efficacy of the various bait types with different active ingredients used during the operation. Rat monitoring data, namely rat tracking indices (RTI) obtained from tracking tunnels, were statistically modelled using Generalised Linear Models. Diphacinone cereal pellets (Pestoff® 50 D, 0. 05 g/kg diphacinone) obtained the lowest RTI, followed by pindone cereal pellets (Pindone Pellets®, 0. 5 g/kg pindone), brodifacoum cereal pellets (Pestoff® 20 p and Talon®, 0. 02 g/kg brodifacoum), coumatetralyl paste (Racumin®, 0. 375 g/kg) and diphacinone <b>bait</b> <b>blocks</b> (Ditrac®, 0. 05 g/kg). Cereal pellet baits worked better than any other bait type used at this location. Season had no statistically significant effect on either RTI or bait-take estimates. The overall goal of the poison operation to decrease rat numbers, and to maintain low levels, has been met. However, the results of this study suggest that baiting needs to be done continuously and over the entire treatment area. Edge bait stations – particularly next to adjacent native forests – should be prioritised to target reinvading rodents. Poisons presented in cereal pellet baits should be preferred to other bait types. Both pindone and brodifacoum showed very good results, as well as diphacinone in cereal pellet baits...|$|R
40|$|Rodent pests cause major {{economic}} losses to rice crops and inflict health risk {{to people and}} live-stock in villages. Maize-based baits were used traditionally to control ricefield rodents. This study aimed to determine if replacing maize with rice as bait base would increase uptake of zinc phosphide and warfarin wax <b>block</b> <b>baits</b> in maturing rice crops, fallow fields and villages. The study site was in lowland ricefields in Cambodia. Nineteen experimental plots {{were placed in the}} three habitats, with three/four plots treated with zinc phosphide and three with warfarin per habitat. Each plot consisted of five bait points each with rice and maize-based toxic and non-toxic baits. Mean bait uptake was increased by 65 % through replacing maize with rice as the base. Such increase was greater with warfarin being the active ingredient than with zinc phosphide, but both increases were substantial (62 % and 51 %). The increase was high in villages (85 %) and maturing rice crops (79 %), and lower in fallow fields (49 %). We recommend that rice be the base in both baits. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Brodifacoum is {{a highly}} {{effective}} anticoagulant rodenticide that presents a secondary hazard to some non-target wildlife. The high acute toxicity of brodifacoum to mammals and birds, and its prolonged persistence in liver predicates secondary risk to predators and scavengers of poisoned rodents. Hence {{there is a need}} to improve ability to monitor and predict hazards of brodifacoum to non-targets, and optimise use patterns accordingly. Use of a less persistent anticoagulant rodenticide, diphacinone, is an alternative approach currently under investigation in New Zealand. This thesis describes a series of laboratory and pen studies that address information gaps relevant to the assessment of non-target hazards in continued use of brodifacoum, and of using diphacinone as an alternative. Non-lethal techniques for determining sublethal brodifacoum exposure in birds was investigated in chickens. Elevation of prothrombin time was a less reliable index than residual concentrations in tissues. Samples requiring less invasive procedures, such as dried blood spots or faeces, have potential to detect recent sublethal brodifacoum exposure and refinement of these indices could be useful in proactive monitoring of avian wildlife. Residual brodifacoum in eggs of sublethally-exposed hens raised further questions regarding wider non-target hazard and adverse effects on development of fertile eggs or chicks. A laboratory trial with rats found a positive correlation between residual brodifacoum concentrations in liver and the amount of brodifacoum ingested as bait. An estimated 14 - 22 % of ingested brodifacoum was excreted in rat faeces in the period between ingestion of a lethal dose and death, indicating another potentially significant environmental pathway for brodifacoum transfer. In considering diphacinone as a less persistent alternative rodenticide to brodifacoum, evaluation of residual concentrations and persistence in pig tissues was required to estimate secondary hazard to human consumers and adequate with-holding periods for hunting feral pigs in areas where diphacinone was applied. A pen trial showed that domestic pigs were more susceptible to diphacinone toxicity, and thus primary poisoning risk, than previously estimated. Hepatic half-life of diphacinone in pigs was approximately 14 days, indicating reduced persistence in comparison to brodifacoum and enabling estimates of with-holding periods for hunting feral pigs from areas where diphacinone baits were applied. To investigate potential hazards of diphacinone use to invertebrates a trial using tree weta, a native New Zealand invertebrate, was undertaken. Weta readily ate diphacinone wax <b>block</b> <b>baits</b> with no mortality or weight loss evident, indicating low susceptibility. Residual whole-body diphacinone concentrations did not increase with the amount of diphacinone bait eaten. A simple, deterministic risk assessment suggested that, as a single secondary exposure, the maximum diphacinone concentration measured in weta would present a low risk to non-target birds. Given international recognition of the high secondary hazard and corresponding restrictions on use of brodifacoum, continued availability of brodifacoum to non-licensed users and sustained field applications for possum and rodent control in New Zealand is an exceptional use pattern. New data in this thesis suggest that baiting strategies that minimise the amount of brodifacoum available in the environment are important and regulatory review of some New Zealand brodifacoum applications should address this. In parallel, development of diphacinone as an alternative to brodifacoum should continue, as new data here confirms lower persistence in mammalian liver than brodifacoum, and also indicates low toxicity to invertebrates. However further investigation of multiple-exposure hazard and potential sublethal effects of diphacinone on non-target mammals and birds is warranted before extensive and sustained field applications of diphacinone are undertaken...|$|R
