50|$|The <b>backspread</b> is the {{converse}} strategy to the ratio spread {{and is also}} known as reverse ratio spread. Using calls, a bullish strategy known as the call <b>backspread</b> can be constructed and with puts, a strategy known as the put <b>backspread</b> can be constructed.|$|E
50|$|With {{options on}} {{commodity}} futures (and possibly inverse ETFs), this relationship may be reversed as the observed correlation between price movement and implied volatility is positive meaning that as prices rise, so does volatility. In this case, the call <b>backspread</b> trader {{might benefit from}} these effects and the put <b>backspread</b> trader might not.|$|E

50|$|A 2:1 call <b>backspread</b> can {{be created}} by selling a number of calls at a lower strike price and buying {{twice the number of}} calls at a higher strike.|$|E
5000|$|The maximum {{loss for}} this {{strategy}} is taken {{when the price of}} the underlying security moves to exactly the lower strike at expiration. The loss taken per put <b>backspread</b> combination can be expressed as: ...|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} spreads in which unequal number of options are {{simultaneously}} purchased and written. When more options are written than purchased, it is a ratio spread. When more options are purchased than written, it is a <b>backspread.</b>|$|E

50|$|For equity markets (as {{described}} above), {{the call}} <b>backspread</b> does not generally offer these helpful dynamics because the generally associated changes in volatility as price {{moves in the}} equity markets may exacerbate losses on a bearish move and reduce profits on a bullish move in the underlying.|$|E

50|$|The call <b>backspread</b> (reverse call ratio spread) is a bullish {{strategy}} in options trading whereby the options trader writes {{a number of}} call options and buys more call options of the same underlying stock and expiration date but at a higher strike price. It is an unlimited profit, limited risk strategy that is used when the trader thinks {{that the price of}} the underlying stock will rise sharply in the near future.|$|E
50|$|In equity options markets (including equity indexes and {{derivative}} equities such as ETFs, but possibly excluding inverse ETFs), it {{has been}} observed that there exists an inverse correlation between the price of the underlying and the implied volatility of its options. The implied volatility will often increase as the price of the underlying decreases and vice versa. This correlation manifests itself in a beneficial way to traders in a put <b>backspread</b> position.|$|E
50|$|The put <b>backspread</b> is a {{strategy}} in options trading whereby the options trader writes a number of put options at a higher strike price (often at-the-money) and buys a greater number (often twice as many) of put options at a lower strike price (often out-of-the-money) of the same underlying stock and expiration date. Typically the strikes are selected such {{that the cost of}} the long puts is largely offset by the premium earned in writing the at-the-money puts. This strategy is generally considered very bearish but it can also serve as a neutral/bullish play under the right conditions.|$|E
