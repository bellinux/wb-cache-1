40|$|The {{interaction}} of a jet entering into a freestream normal {{to the main}} flow direction has been studied with particular attention directed to visualization of the large-scale flow interactions and to measurement of the film-cooling performance. Large eddies are apparent downstream of the entering jet even at moderate <b>blowing</b> <b>rate</b> (defined as {{the ratio of the}} mass velocity of the jet to the mass velocity of the freestream). At higher <b>blowing</b> <b>rate,</b> there is only intermittent contact between the mass from the jet and the downstream wall. The film cooling downstream from a single normal jet yields a lower centerline effectiveness compared to an inclined jet through a greater lateral spreading. The greater spreading provides a more uniform effectiveness across the span of the downstream wall, in particular at large <b>blowing</b> <b>rate...</b>|$|E

Data comparisons were made between straight and curved single tubular passages embedded in the wall and discharging at 30 deg angle in line with the tunnel flow. The results showed an influence of curvature on film-cooling effectiveness that was inversely proportional to the <b>blowing</b> <b>rate.</b> At the lowest <b>blowing</b> <b>rate</b> of 0. 18, curvature increased the effectiveness of film cooling by 35 percent; but at a <b>blowing</b> <b>rate</b> of 0. 76, the improvement was only 10 percent. In addition, the increase in film-cooling area coverage ranged from 100 percent down to 25 percent over the same blowing rates. A data trend reversal at a <b>blowing</b> <b>rate</b> of 1. 5 showed the straight tubular passage's film-cooling effectiveness to be 20 percent greater than that of the curved passage with about 80 percent more area coverage. An analysis of turbulence intensity detain the mixing layer in terms of the position of the mixing interface relative to the wall supported the concept that passage curvature tends to reduce the diffusion of the coolant jet into the main stream at blowing rates below about. Explanations for the film-cooling performance of both test sections were made in terms differences in turbulences structure and in secondary flow patterns within the coolant jets as influenced by flow passage geometry...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} of effectiveness and heat transfer on a cylinder model with showerhead cooling {{has been conducted}} in a free jet test facility, using the transient liquid crystal technique. A three- and a four-row configuration, covering a region of ± 21 °, were chosen to study the cooling behaviour for zero and off-design incidences. Typical engine airfoil leading edge conditions were maintained for the freestream Reynolds and Mach numbers to 1. 55 e 5 and 0. 26 for the three-row, and 1. 84 e 5 and 0. 30 for the four-row configuration, at a turbulence intensity of 7 %. The blowing and momentum rates were varied from 0. 4 to 1. 8 and 0. 1 to 1. 9, at a density ratio of 1. 65. At zero incidence it could be observed for both configurations that the highest effectiveness of about 0. 3 was achieved at a <b>blowing</b> <b>rate</b> of 0. 4. Negative incidence for the four-row configuration resulted in much higher effectiveness, being as high as 0. 5 at a <b>blowing</b> <b>rate</b> of 0. 9, with an associated high heat transfer. Much lower effectiveness was achieved at positive incidence, where the <b>blowing</b> <b>rate</b> of 0. 9 showed the best cooling behaviour.

The governing equations have been solved numerically by combining the implicit finite‐difference scheme with the quasi‐linearization technique.

40|$|The {{effect of}} large blowing {{rates on the}} {{unsteady}} laminar incompressible electrically conducting fluid flow over an infinite wedge with an aligned magnetic field has been studied. The effects of the induced magnetic field and the heat transfer {{are included in the}} analysis. The boundary layer equations and the Maxwell's equations governing the flow are reduced to a system of ordinary differential equations by using similarity transformations. These equations are solved numerically by using an implicit finite-difference scheme (with nonuniform step length) in combination with the quasilinearization technique. Also, we have carried out an asymptotic analysis using the method of matched asymptotic expansion. The asymptotic analysis, although approximate, allows the numerical results to be extended to indefinitely large rates of blowing and circumvents the difficulties in numerical analysis which become progressively more severe as the <b>blowing</b> <b>rate</b> increases. For large blowing rates the results of the asymptotic analysis are found to be in very good agreement with those of the numerical method. The boundary layer thickness increases rapidly with the <b>blowing</b> <b>rate</b> or the magnetic parameter.

The results have been obtained for (i) an accelerating/decelerating stream and (ii) a fluctuating stream. The skin friction responds to the fluctuation in the free stream more compared to the heat transfer.

A limit cycle oscillation was observed for angles of attack between 22 and 30 deg. In general, the main flow phenomena responsible for the wing-body-tail wing rock are the interactions between the forebody and the wing vortices. Various blowing techniques were evaluated as means of wing rock suppression. Blowing tangentially aft from leeward side nozzles near the forebody tip can damp the roll motion at low <b>blowing</b> <b>rates</b> and stop it completely at higher <b>blowing</b> <b>rates.</b> At the high rates, significant vortex asymmetries are created, causing the model to stop at a non-zero roll angle. Forward blowing and alternating right/left pulsed blowing {{appear to be more}} efficient techniques for suppressing wing rock.

Blowing was applied at the quarter-chord location during sinusoidal pitching oscillations described by alpha = alpha(sub m) + 10 deg sin omega t.

Strong steady blowing was found to prevent the bursting of the leading-edge separation bubble at several test points. When this occurred, the lift was increased significantly, stall was averted, and the shape of the moment response showed a positive damping in pitch. In almost all cases, steady blowing reduced the hysteresis amplitudes present in the loads, but the benefits diminished as the reduced frequency and mean angle of oscillation increased.

The influence of the jet on the leading edge vortex structure was examined using laser Doppler anemometry. Velocity surveys through the vortex showed that at high <b>blowing</b> <b>rates</b> the parallel velocity in the outer swirling region of the vortex increased and the normal velocity decreased.
