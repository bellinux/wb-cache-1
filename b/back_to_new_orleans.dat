5|$|The French {{continued}} {{to press for}} the destruction of the Natchez who now lived among the Chickasaw, traditional allies of the British—this sparked the Chickasaw Wars. The Chickasaw at first agreed to drive out the Natchez from among them, but they did not keep good on the promise. In the Chickasaw Campaign of 1736, the French, under Governor Bienville, attacked the Chickasaw villages of Apeony and Ackia, and then retreated, suffering significant casualties, but inflicting few. In the Chickasaw Campaign of 1739, Bienville summoned more than 1,000 troops to be sent over from France. Bienville's army ascended the Mississippi River to the site of present-day Memphis, Tennessee, and attempted to build a military road westward toward Chickasaw villages. After waiting for months in the winter of 1739–40, the French never mounted an attack and retreated <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> <b>Orleans.</b> After having suffered the attacks against the Chickasaw, the remaining Natchez moved on to live among the Cherokee and Creek people. By that time the Natchez, reduced to scattered refugees, had ceased to exist as a political entity.|$|E
5|$|The Minoan Brotherhood {{was officially}} inaugurated on January 1, 1977. Naming this first group the Knossos Grove coven, it {{initially}} began at his and Geraci's shared flat, {{where they were}} joined by their friend Joseph Cupolo. Setting up a lineage recording system to take into account which new initiates were being brought into the Brotherhood, the first man to be welcomed in was Kim Schuller, who was soon followed by Bruce-Michael Gelbert. Not long after, Cupolo moved to New Orleans, where he founded a second coven, known as Phaistos Grove. In 1977, Buczynski began attending the Sheridan Square Gym, and it was here that he met Gene Muto the following year. A stage director and part-time bartender, Muto entered into a sexual relationship with Buczynski, which Geraci accepted as per the rules of their open relationship. However, when Buczynski announced that he {{had fallen in love with}} Muto, it marked the end of his relationship with Geraci, who decided to move <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> in February 1979. Muto proceeded to move in with Buczynski at his apartment on West 13th Street, but did not share his boyfriend's magico-religious beliefs, instead being a far left atheist. He felt that Buczynski was wasting his life on Witchcraft, and encouraged him to aim for an academic education; Buczynski proceeded to attain a graduate equivalency diploma (GED). The Knossos Grove had meanwhile begun to deteriorate, rarely meeting from late-1978 through early 1979. He did however bring in Tony Fiara in late 1979, who would go on to play a significant role in the Minoan tradition, which was then being eclipsed in size by the Radical Faerie movement. That year, Buczynski decided to stop using his flat as a covenstead, which he moved to the Earth Star Temple, the back room of The Magickal Childe, Herman Slater's new shop.|$|E

5000|$|The mascot {{known as}} [...] "Big Al" [...] {{today was the}} brainchild of University of Alabama student Walt Tart. He was meeting with the {{homecoming}} chairman Ann Paige in 1979 as they were {{trying to come up with}} something different for the school's homecoming parade. He told Ann that several schools in the Southeastern Conference had obtained mascot costumes and proposed that the University of Alabama should get one as well. After contacting the University of Kentucky and a few other schools, Walt was able to discover that their mascots were designed and constructed by the Disney company. He contacted Disney and received a price quote for the design and construction of the elephant costume. Since funding for the mascot costume would have to come from the athletic department, Walt and Ann set up a meeting with Coach Bryant, as he was not only the football coach, but also the athletic director at the University. Bryant teased them about having an elephant on the field and the mess it would make. They assured him that it was just a person in an elephant costume and not a real one, to which the Coach gave a big grin and said he knew all along. He said he thought elephants were very smart but a little slow, but overall, the meeting went very well as Coach Bryant said they could have the funds for the elephant costume.The [...] "Big Al" [...] mascot officially debuted at the 1980 Sugar Bowl, when the 1979 Alabama Crimson Tide football team defeated the Arkansas Razorbacks.
