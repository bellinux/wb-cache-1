50|$|Bellcranks {{are often}} used in {{aircraft}} control systems to connect the pilot's controls to the control surfaces. For example: on light aircraft, the rudder often has a <b>bellcrank</b> whose pivot point is the rudder hinge. A cable connects the pilot's rudder pedal {{to one side of}} the <b>bellcrank.</b> When the pilot pushes on the rudder pedal, the rudder rotates on its hinge. The opposite rudder pedal is connected to the other end of the <b>bellcrank</b> to rotate the rudder in the opposite direction.|$|E
50|$|A {{drag link}} {{converts}} rotary motion from a crank arm, {{to a second}} <b>bellcrank,</b> usually in an automotive steering system.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bellcranks</b> {{are also}} seen in {{automotive}} applications, {{as part of}} the linkage connecting the throttle pedal to the carburetor, and connecting the brake pedal to the master brake cylinder. In vehicle suspensions, <b>bellcranks</b> are used in pushrod-style suspensions in automobiles or in the Christie suspension in tanks. Vertically-mounted suspensions may not be feasible in some vehicle designs due to space, aerodynamic, or other design constraints; <b>bellcranks</b> translate the vertical motion of the wheel in to horizontal motion, allowing the suspension to be mounted transversely or longitudinally within the vehicle.|$|R

50|$|Alloys 356-T6 and A356-T6 are {{the primary}} casting alloys {{employed}} for brackets, <b>bellcranks,</b> pulleys, and various fittings. Wheels are produced in these alloys as permanent mold or sand castings. Die castings in alloy A380 also are satisfactory for wheels for light aircraft.|$|R

5000|$|A typical 90 degree <b>bellcrank</b> {{consists}} of an [...] "L" [...] shaped crank pivoted where the two arms of the L meet. Moving rods (or cables or ropes) {{are attached to the}} ends of the L arms. When one is pulled, the L rotates around the pivot point, pulling on the other arm. A typical 180 degree <b>bellcrank</b> {{consists of}} a straight bar pivoted in the center. When one arm is pulled or pushed, the bar rotates around the pivot point, pulling or pushing on the other arm.|$|E
5000|$|... s were {{introduced}} around 1866. A <b>bellcrank</b> arrangement reduced the strain (percentage extension) of the spring, thus maintaining a more constant force. They {{were used by}} the L&Y & NER.|$|E

50|$|In a {{departure}} from the design philosophy of the LS4, Rolladen-Schneider set out to design the LS7 as an uncompromised competition machine, seeking the highest performance possible with the technology of the time. Designer Wolf Lemke specified a highly laminar wing profile and developed a high aspect ratio wing. Carbon fibre was extensively used in the construction, along with aramid fibre, to ensure enough strength in spite of slender structural elements and increased loadings. The aileron drive <b>bellcranks</b> were entirely concealed within the wings, with a mere 30mm of usable height at the trailing edge.|$|R
5000|$|The tank's {{suspension}} system was that {{which had been}} developed by Vickers for their Medium C prototype in the mid-1920s The tank was carried by five double wheel bogies on each side. Four of the bogies were on <b>bellcranks</b> in pairs, with a common horizontal coil spring. The fifth bogie at the rear was sprung against a hull bracket. Between the first bogie and the idler wheel, was a larger diameter vertically sprung [...] "jockey wheel". The first Matildas had return rollers; these were replaced in later models by track skids, which were far easier to manufacture and to service in the field.|$|R
50|$|The 2001 car {{featured}} upgrades {{and lessons}} learned from the 2000 car which include improved <b>bellcrank</b> mounting and lighter front uprights. New rear suspension geometry (new rear subframe) was also introduced this year.|$|E
50|$|A <b>bellcrank</b> whose center pivot was the upper, forward mount on the frame, {{and whose}} ends were {{attached}} {{to the top of}} the main link and the radius rod (the connection to the combination arm and thence to the valve).|$|E
50|$|Most servos are rotary {{actuators}} although other types are available. Linear actuators are sometimes used, {{although it is}} more common to use a rotary actuator with a <b>bellcrank</b> and pushrod. Some types, originally used as sail winches for model yachting, can rotate continuously.|$|E
2500|$|It was an {{extremely}} advanced design for the period, with a single-unit steel [...] "bathtub" [...] running from just behind the propeller to the rear crew position acting not only as armour, but also as both the main fuselage structure and engine mounting in one unit. Engine access was provided by armored steel panels, one {{on either side of}} the nose. The armour was [...] thick and weighed [...] It protected the crew, the engine, the fuel tanks, and radio equipment, when fitted. The flight control surfaces were connected to the aircraft's controls by push-rods and <b>bellcranks</b> – not with the usual steel cable control connections of the era as push-rods were less likely to be severed by ground fire.|$|R
50|$|The slender wings {{required}} {{the use of}} a carbon reinforced main spar for structural feasibility. The horizontal stabiliser is a sparless carbon sandwich shell. The full-span flaperons are divided into six segments and built as aramid / foam sandwiches allowing a very light and rigid construction. Fairings on the upper wing surface accommodate the tall flaperon <b>bellcranks.</b> The elevator is a carbon / aramid shell except for the LS6-a that employed an Aramid / corrugated paper construction. The fuselage is built as a single shell of glass-reinforced plastic, except {{in the area of the}} cockpit that is a double shell for passive safety. A safety cockpit was developed for the -c variant with additional glass, carbon and aramid reinforcements, following crash tests carried out in-house by Wolf Lemke anticipating later TÜV Rheinland crashworthiness recommendations.|$|R
2500|$|The system {{comprises}} two {{suspension cylinders}} mounted horizontally {{on each side}} of the platform chassis. Inside the cylinders are two springs, one for each wheel, mounted at each end of the cylinder. The springs are connected to the front leading swinging arm and rear trailing swinging arm, that act like <b>bellcranks</b> by pull rods (tie rods). These are connected to spring seating cups in the middle of the cylinder, each spring being compressed independently, against the ends of the cylinder. Each cylinder is mounted using an additional set of springs, originally made from steel, called [...] "volute" [...] springs, on later models made from rubber. These allow the front and rear suspension to interconnect. When the front wheel is deflected up over a bump, the front pull rod compresses the front spring inside the cylinder, against the front of the cylinder. This also compresses the front [...] "volute" [...] spring pulling the whole cylinder forwards. That action pulls the rear wheel down on the same side via the rear spring assembly and pull rod. When the rear wheel meets that bump a moment later, it does the same in reverse, keeping the car level front to rear. When both springs are compressed on one side when travelling around a bend, or front and rear wheels hit bumps simultaneously, the equal and opposite forces applied to the front and rear spring assemblies reduce the interconnection. It reduces pitching, which is a particular problem of soft car suspension.|$|R
50|$|One {{distinctive}} {{characteristic of}} the Tiger Moth design is its differential aileron control setup. The ailerons (on the lower wing only) on a Tiger Moth are operated by an externally mounted circular <b>bellcrank,</b> which lies flush with the lower wing's fabric undersurface covering. This circular <b>bellcrank</b> is rotated by metal cables and chains from the cockpit's control columns, and has the externally mounted aileron pushrod attached at a point 45° outboard and forward of the bellcrank's centre, when the ailerons are both at their neutral position. This results in an aileron control system operating, with barely any travel down {{at all on the}} wing {{on the outside of the}} turn, while the aileron on the inside travels a large amount upwards to counteract adverse yaw.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} the {{eccentric}} rod, close to the radius hanger, the rod connected to the transmission yoke. The upper end of this rod connected to a <b>bellcrank,</b> which translated the up and down motion of the transmission yoke into back and forth motion of the valves.|$|E
5000|$|For {{competition}} {{the lines}} are tested before flight with a [...] "pull test" [...] that varies with the model weight and category to verify that the lines and control system (primarily the <b>bellcrank</b> and its attachment {{to the rest of}} the model) will withstand the line tension during flight.|$|E
5000|$|In 1953 Leroy Cox (L.M. Cox Manufacturing) is sued by Jim Walker (American Junior Aircraft Co.) for {{copyright}} infringement because Cox {{was using}} Walker's patented <b>bellcrank</b> {{system in the}} TD1 and secondly because Walker believed the Cox Skylon Reel was {{a copy of his}} U-Reely control handle. The court case lasted for 3 years.|$|E
50|$|Another mechanism, used on Stephenson's {{locomotives}} in the 1830s, was the 'coupled gab'. Two open gabs were used, as for {{the manual}} open gab, although in this case they were both operated automatically by a single reversing lever. One was actuated by a <b>bellcrank,</b> the other through a reversing linkage from this, so that as one engaged the other was already lifted clear.|$|E
50|$|The {{parts were}} {{arranged}} {{so that when}} the yoke was centered, the connection of the main link to the <b>bellcrank</b> was in a line with the two pivots on the yoke. At this point, the back and forth motion of {{the lower end of the}} main link left the top relatively motionless as main link swung back and forth on the swing links.|$|E
50|$|A <b>bellcrank</b> {{is a type}} of crank {{that changes}} motion through an angle. The angle can be any angle from 0 to 360 degrees, but 90 degrees and 180 degrees are most common. The name comes from its first use, {{changing}} the vertical pull on a rope to a horizontal pull on the striker of a bell, used for calling staff in large houses or commercial establishments.|$|E
50|$|Other {{systems for}} {{steering}} exist, but are uncommon on road vehicles. Children's toys and go-karts often use a very direct linkage {{in the form}} of a <b>bellcrank</b> (also commonly known as a Pitman arm) attached directly between the steering column and the steering arms, and the use of cable-operated steering linkages (e.g. the capstan and bowstring mechanism) is also found on some home-built vehicles such as soapbox cars and recumbent tricycles.|$|E
50|$|Sulzer ZG9 was a pre-World War II opposed-piston {{two-stroke}} {{diesel engine}} by Sulzer. The engine was available {{with a choice}} of two, three and four cylinders (2ZG9, 3ZG9, 4ZG9); the two-cylinder version developed 120 bhp. It used a piston scavenge pump. This was mounted vertically above one rocker, driven by a <b>bellcrank</b> from the main rockers. This engine is sometimes cited as an inspiration for the Commer TS3 design.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{floor jack}} (aka 'trolley jack') a {{horizontal}} piston pushes {{on the short}} end of a <b>bellcrank,</b> with the long arm providing the vertical motion to a lifting pad, kept horizontal with a horizontal linkage. Floor jacks usually include castors and wheels, allowing compensation for the arc taken by the lifting pad. This mechanism provides a low profile when collapsed, for easy maneuvering underneath the vehicle, while allowing considerable extension.|$|E
50|$|The {{geometry}} {{in operation}} {{is more like}} that of a vee-twin engine. The two cylinders work together, but with one leading the other by approx. 30°. The difference in this case is that the cylinders are no longer directly in line with the crankshaft and so use the connecting rod as a form of <b>bellcrank.</b> If one cylinder is at dead centre, the other will be away from it by the amount of this angle.|$|E
5000|$|Changing {{the length}} of the arms changes the {{mechanical}} advantage of the system. Many applications do not change the direction of motion, but instead to amplify a force [...] "in line", which a <b>bellcrank</b> can do in a limited space. There is a tradeoff between range of motion, linearity of motion, and size. The greater the angle traversed by the crank, the more non-linear the motion becomes (the more the motion ratio changes).|$|E
50|$|In forward motion, {{the yoke}} was pushed forward, {{so that its}} upper pivot {{was in front of}} the bell crank-main link connection. Moving the {{eccentric}} arm back and forth lowered and raised the top of the main link. This motion was translated by the <b>bellcrank</b> into back and forth motion of the radius rod. The angle of the yoke controlled the relative motion, and therefore the cutoff; tilting the yoke backwards reversed the motion of the radius rod.|$|E
5000|$|The {{controls}} {{of a conventional}} 2-line/"U-Control" [...] system consist of lead-out cables, a <b>bellcrank,</b> push rods and control horns. These are connected so that differential motion of the lines rotates the <b>bellcrank,</b> causing a pushrod to move either forward or aft. The pushrod {{is connected to the}} control surface with a control horn that moves the elevator (and flaps, if used) up and down. The pilot holds a handle to which the lines are attached. Tilting the handle with the fingers, wrist, and/or elbow motion causes the differential movement in the lines. By convention, tilting the hand so the top is closer to the pilot than the bottom results in [...] "up" [...] elevator, much like pulling back on a full-scale airplane control stick. Also by convention, most airplanes are flown nominally counter-clockwise as viewed from above, with the leadout cables exiting the left wing. This is not universal and some pilots fly in the opposite direction. Flying clockwise has a slight advantage in some situations because most engines run so that the torque will roll the airplane away from the pilot, increasing line tension in upright level flight.|$|E
50|$|The Aerolite 103 {{features}} a high wing with half-span flaps that are extended {{by use of}} an overhead <b>bellcrank</b> {{to a maximum of}} 40 degrees. The flight controls are three-axis and are actuated by a wheel mounted on a control column via flexible push-pull cables and conventional rudder pedals connected to the rudder by cables. The engine throttle is a twist-grip type and incorporates a brake lever to operate the non-differential mechanical drum brakes installed on the main wheels of the tricycle landing gear.|$|E
5000|$|In 1955 Cox {{wins the}} court case against Jim Walker. Walker's patent on the <b>bellcrank</b> control system is ruled void and invalid {{because it was}} {{determined}} that the system had been designed before Walker's patent and by someone else - a man named Oba St.Clair, who was the first man to fly a control line airplane (in the USA) back in 1937 and the design was published in 1938. Oba St.Clair had shown his design to Jim Walker who took it upon himself to patent the design! The court also ruled that the Cox reel was not a copyright infringement.|$|E
50|$|There {{are very}} few similar engines. Opposed-piston diesel engines are rare enough at this size, the rocker lever {{arrangement}} was almost unheard of. Probably the only engine using a similar arrangement was the pre-war Sulzer ZG9. This was an opposed-piston engine {{with a choice of}} two, three and four cylinders (2ZG9, 3ZG9, 4ZG9); the two-cylinder version developed 120 bhp. Its layout was very similar to the Commer engines, but it used a piston scavenge pump rather than a Roots blower. This was mounted vertically above one rocker, driven by a <b>bellcrank</b> from the main rockers. This engine is sometimes cited as an inspiration for the Commer design.|$|E
50|$|The board {{found that}} the crash was survivable and that {{deficiencies}} in the seating, restraint systems, and the cabin configuration contributed {{to the deaths of}} seven of the occupants who appeared to have survived the initial impact. The primary cause of the accident was found to be a failure in the flight control systems, specifically a separation of the fore/aft <b>bellcrank</b> from the pitch control linkages in the aircraft's mixing unit. The failure in the flight control systems was ultimately found to be caused by systematic errors and deficiencies in the maintenance program employed by 817 Squadron {{at the time of the}} accident. The maintenance activity which led to the accident occurred 57 days before the accident.|$|E
