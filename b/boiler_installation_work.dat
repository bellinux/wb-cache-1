50|$|Condensing boilers {{are up to}} 50% more {{expensive}} to buy and install than conventional types in the UK and the US. However, , at UK prices the extra cost of installing a condensing instead of conventional boiler should be recovered in around 2-5 years through lower fuel use (for verification, see the following three documents published by the Building Research Establishment: Information Papers 10-88 and 19-94; General Information Leaflet 74; Digest 339; see also Case studies in Application Manual AM3 1989: Condensing Boilers by Chartered Institute of Building Services Engineers), and 2-5 years at US prices. Exact figures {{will depend on the}} efficiency of the original <b>boiler</b> <b>installation,</b> <b>boiler</b> utilisation patterns, the costs associated with the new <b>boiler</b> <b>installation,</b> and how frequently the system is used.The cost of these boilers is dropping as the mass takeup enforced by government takes effect and the manufacturers withdraw older, less efficient models, but production cost is higher than older types as condensing boilers are more complex.|$|R
