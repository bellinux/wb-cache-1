40|$|Abstract—The {{performance}} of iterative decoding of Low Den-sity Parity Check (LDPC) codes over Binary Erasure Channels can be completely {{characterized by the}} study of stopping sets. Therefore, the <b>burst</b> erasure correction <b>capability</b> of a given LDPC code can be readily quantified by searching for stopping sets within consecutive bit nodes. In this work we study the optimal permutation of the bit nodes {{that will result in}} the maximum possible <b>burst</b> erasure correction <b>capability</b> for a given LDPC code. Noting that this is essentially a combinatorial optimization problem that is highly likely to be NP-hard, we adopt a simulated annealing based approach for finding the optimal permutation.

As with the <b>burst</b> <b>capability,</b> cloud computing offers near-instant scalability (quicker than purchasing physical machines [8]) allowing an application to scale beyond what is easily achievable with in-house data centres, as shown in Figure 3.

30|$|Burst capabilityEvery {{object in}} the debris {{catalogue}} requires processing (e.g. for conjunction analysis) and as the catalogue grows, the demand for computational power increases. New launches increase the catalogue size in a predictable manner but conjunctions can unpredictably add thousands of new objects, then as the debris orbits decay, the number of entries reduces. A cloud-based architecture would facilitate the rapid procurement of processing power to process the debris orbital data and the characterisation of the conjunction event in a timely fashion. This is a fundamental component of the SST segment. As debris in the catalogue decays out of orbit, excess computational resources can be released, thus not incurring a cost. The <b>burst</b> <b>capability</b> of a cloud-based architecture offers rapid expansion and reduction of computational resources making it ideal for scenarios such as SSA.|$|E

40|$|Evolution and {{characteristics}} of apple bud dormancy in mild winter conditions. In order to study bud dormancy in mild winter climate, the evolution of bud <b>bursting</b> <b>capabilities</b> was investigated, using the « one-node-cutting test », during three successive years. The buds were sampled from Golden delicious apple trees grown {{in the region of}} Meknes (Morocco), where now and then abnormal bud burst occurs. The made-up graphs of mean bursting time display a fi rst phase of bud inertia, weak and temporary, of correlative origin, but variable from year to year. This is followed by a peak of true dormancy, wich appears fi rst induced and afterwards removed by the chilling temperatures from november to march. The bud break disorders result thus from the combined effect of a high initial inertia, linked to the previous growth conditions, and a short period of chilling. In fact, the very cause of the disorders is less the insuffi cient chilling avalaible than the double action of these low temperatures that partly increase at fi rst the depth of dormancy before starting to eliminate it...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{examined}} the effect of myelin P 2 protein on some proinflammatory functions exerted by human mononuclear phagocytes. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that P 2 protein selectively induced in monocytes and macrophages mRNA accumulation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin 1 beta (IL- 1 beta), and interleukin 8 (IL- 8) in a time-dependent manner. Natural killer stimulating factor (IL- 12) mRNA and protein secretion was strongly induced by lipopolysaccharide but not by P 2 protein. Supernatants harvested from P 2 -stimulated monocytes contained significant amounts of TNF, IL- 1 beta, and IL- 8, whereas those from macrophages contained only TNF and IL- 8. The effect of the P 2 protein on TNF and IL- 8 mRNA accumulation and secretion was not affected by polymyxin B, which, on the other hand, almost completely abolished the effect of lipopolysaccharide. Finally, P 2 protein did not directly trigger hydrogen peroxide release but, through the induced release of TNF, potentiated monocyte respiratory <b>burst</b> <b>capability.</b> Since P 2 protein is the antigen responsible for the induction of experimental allergic neuritis, these findings identify a potential mechanism involved in the inflammatory reaction and myelin damage during experimental allergic neuritis...|$|E
40|$|The Hodgkin-Huxley equations, first {{introduced}} in the early 50 ’s, provided the framework for en-suing and more detailed studies on the properties of neurons. The associated dynamical system, however, exhibits complex behaviour which {{makes it hard to}} analyze. To overcome this hindrance one usually reduces the dimension of the original system, with the help of ordinary dimensional reduction techniques, obtaining systems of two or three dimensions (instead of the original four) that still capture many of the same fundamental behaviours. In his book, ‘Dynamical Systems in Neuroscience: The Geometry of Excitability and Bursting’[1], Eugene Izhikevich introduces a few hybrid bidimensional and tridimensional models (defined only in part by continuous dynamical systems) which do exactly that, whilst having very low overhead. One of the most fundamen-tal aspects of many neurons is the ability to fire sequences of voltage spikes, interspersed with periods of quiescence, a phenomenon known as bursting.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{pathogenic}} fungus Fonsecaea pedrosoi constitutively {{produces the}} pigment melanin, an important virulence factor in fungi. Melanin {{is incorporated in}} the cell wall structure and provides chemical and physical protection for the fungus. We evaluated the production of nitric oxide (NO) in macrophages, the oxidative burst and the inducible nitric oxide synthase (i-NOS) activity in interactions between activated murine macrophages and F. pedrosoi. Experiments were carried out with or without tricyclazole (TC) treatment, a selective inhibitor of the dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN) -melanin biosynthesis pathway in F. pedrosoi. The paramagnetisms of melanin and the TC-melanin were analysed by electron spin resonance. The fungal growth responses to H 2 O 2 and to S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), a nitric oxide donor, were also evaluated. Results Melanised F. pedrosoi cells were more resistant to both H 2 O 2 and NO. Nitrite was not detected in the supernatant of macrophages incubated with melanised fungal cells. However, i-NOS expression was unaffected {{by the presence of}} either untreated control F. pedrosoi or TC-treated F. pedrosoi. In addition, the inhibition of the DHN-melanin pathway by TC improved the oxidative <b>burst</b> <b>capability</b> of the macrophages.

40|$|Stimulation {{of human}} {{polymorphonuclear}} leucocytes (PMN) with phagocytosable particles [yeast-IgG (Y-IgG) ], lipopolysaccharide (LPS), tumour necrosis factor (TNF) or formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenyl-alanine (FMLP) {{results in an}} increase of the interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) mRNA accumulation and a subsequent release of the protein. Here, we report that interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) down-regulates the constitutive IL- 8 mRNA levels expressed by resting PMN. As shown by Northern analysis, this down-modulation occurred rapidly, was not dependent on new protein synthesis, and was not caused by an increased rate of degradation of IL- 8 mRNA. Preincubation of PMN with IFN-gamma significantly inhibited their ability to release IL- 8 upon stimulation with TNF, LPS, FMLP and Y-IgG, but enhanced the respiratory <b>burst</b> <b>capability</b> in response to FMLP and TNF. TNF-, LPS- and FMLP-induced expression of IL- 8 mRNA was also selectively inhibited by IFN-gamma. Taken together {{these findings suggest that}} IFN-gamma has important regulatory effects on acute inflammatory response because of its capacity to modulate negatively IL- 8 gene expression and secretion by human PMN. Further observations revealed that, in human PMN, degradation of IL- 8 mRNA is finely regulated, and that cycloheximide (CHX), an inhibitor of protein synthesis, super-induces the mRNA accumulation for IL- 8 in a dose- and time-dependent manner...|$|E
40|$|Since the TSPs do not undergo any {{displacement}} {{relative to}} indications developed within the TSPs during normal operation, tube burst at these locations is prevented by the TSP. Thus, the <b>burst</b> <b>capability</b> requirement of 3 times the {{normal operating differential}} pressure is obviated {{by the presence of}} the TSP, and the RG 1. 121 requirement relative to 3 ∆PNO is inherently met. If the TSPs did not undergo displacements during a postulated SLB event, the same would be true of the RG 1. 121 requirement relative to 1. 43 ∆PSLB. However, the TSPs are subjected to out-of-plane loads during a SLB, and TSP displacements are predicted to occur at local areas on the TSPs thus exposing cracks presumed to exist in the tube within the span of the TSP. The principal requirement of the tube expansions is to restrict TSP deflection to a value such that the probability of burst (POB) during a postulated SLB event is essentially negligible. It can be shown that the burst probability for the STP- 2 SGs under peak bounding SLB loading is negligible even without tube expansion; however, 16 hot leg tubes will be expanded at plates C, F and J (see Figure 3 [...] 2 of WCAP 15163, Rev 1) to provide added margin for the probability of burst.

A PCI I/O board was developed, utilizing mainly Complex Programmable Logic Devices (CPLD 2 ̆ 7 s), which included a custom Direct Memory Access (DMA) Controller {{to take advantage of}} the unique feature set of the PCI bus. The arbitration mechanisms and performance characteristics of the PCI bus are taken advantage of in order to achieve a maximum burst throughput rate of 66 Megabytes per second. Performance characteristics of the I/O board are analyzed for two separate PCI host systems. In the faster of the two systems, a 166 MHz Pentium PC, a maximum aggregate throughput rate of 54 Megabytes per second for PCI burst writes was achieved. In all cases throughput increased as a function of transfer size. Due to buffering implementations in the host systems write performance was always superior to read performance. In addition to exceptional throughput capability, this implementation provides a design engineer with a versatile interface which can be mated to a number of high performance applications.
