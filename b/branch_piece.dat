40|$|Abstract: This paper {{reports on}} the {{development}} of a validated numerical model (using 3 -D finite element method (FEM)) of an unreinforced T-section pipe. Pipe profiling severely compromises the localized performance of the T-section pipe. The main objective was to develop a less conservative tool to investigate the key factors that influence failure in T-section pipes. Strain gauges were mounted on the T-section to capture the induced strains as the pressure was gradually increased until the pipe burst. The executed FEM analysis provided comparable results to the experimental measurements which provided a cost effective tool to validate the numerical model. This result allows for better placement of <b>branch</b> <b>piece</b> reinforcements based on experimentally obtained results. The developed tool c be used to optimize the design and sizing of reinforcing crotch plates...|$|E

The pathogen population was greatly reduced in the moist soil (43 MPa) when compared with the wet soil (- 0. 03 MPa) at both temperatures which was indicated by greater colonization and growth of T. harzanum- 2 on the <b>branch</b> <b>pieces</b> of chickpea plants. The pathogen was completely eradicated from the chickpea <b>branch</b> <b>pieces,</b> after 6 months at 35 degrees C in the moist soil. In air-dry soil (<- 50 MPa), Foc survived in 100 % of the <b>branch</b> <b>pieces</b> even after 6 months at both temperatures. When chickpea plant <b>branch</b> <b>pieces</b> having pathogen was sprayed with Th- 2 antagonistic isolates of Trichoderma spp., the Th- 2 isolate killed the pathogen up to minimum level (10 - 12 %) after 5 months at 35 degrees C in the sandy clay loam soil. It can be concluded that in chickpea growing rainfed areas of Pakistan having sandy clay loam soil, Foc can be controlled by using specific Trichoderma spp., especially in the summer season as after harvest of the crop the temperature increased up and there is rainfall during this period which makes the soil moist. This practice will be able to reduce the inoculum of Foc during this hot period as field remain fallow till next crop is sown in most of the chickpea growing rainfed areas of Pakistan...|$|R

A simple inverse code methodology based on BS 1113 [1 - 3] exists for estimating base rupture life in cylinder to cylinder configurations (branches) under constant pressure and temperature. This does not cover the complex issue of estimating the mixed creep-fatigue effects of cycling which can have a significant influence on damage especially under the current practice of multi-shifting as utilities follow fluctuating energy markets. The current work is primarily aimed at extending the inverse code methodology for base rupture to include cycled loading due to startups and shutdowns. This is achieved under the guidelines of the R 5 assessment code {{by the use of}} an analytical expression for metastable thermal stresses [4, 5] and mapped thermal stress response. System loads are not considered in this work other than by the simple method suggested using the inverse code method. Only 90 ° non protruding branches are considered in the current work. Examples of 90 ° branches are examined showing the significance of cyclic loading on a variety of branch configurations. It was observed that base rupture dominates most configurations up to a "cliff edge" in thermal ramp rate followed by rapid accumulation of creep-fatigue damage at higher rates.

40|$|The {{continuity}} of the xylem water columns was studied on 17 - to 23 -m tall birch trees (trunk diameter about 23 cm; first branching above 10 m) all year round. Fifty-one trees were felled, and 5 -cm thick slices or 2 -m long boles were taken at regular, relatively short intervals over the entire height of the trees. The filling status of the vessels was determined by (i) xylem sap extraction from trunk and <b>branch</b> <b>pieces</b> (using the gas bubble-based jet-discharge method and centrifugation) and from trunk boles (using gravity discharge); (ii) (1) H nuclear magnetic resonance imaging of slice pieces; (iii) infusion experiments (dye, (86) Rb(+), D(2) O) on intact trees and cut branches; and (iv) xylem pressure measurements. This broad array of techniques disclosed no evidence for continuous water-filled columns, as postulated by the Cohesion-Tension theory, for root to apex directed mass transport. Except in early spring (during the xylem refilling phase) and after extremely heavy rainfall during the vegetation period, cohesive/mobile water was found predominantly at intermediate heights of the trunks {{but not at the}} base or towards the top of the tree. Similar results were obtained for branches. Furthermore, upper branches generally contained more cohesive/mobile water than lower branches.

40|$|International audienceThe Skagafjörður area counts {{several large}} slope mass {{movements}} {{especially on the}} eastern side of the fjord. They are initiated from the top of the rockwall where a more or less developed scars are still observed. A significant number of those landforms have been described by Jónsson (1957), who interpreted those landforms as a result of post-glacial rockwall debuttressing, following the shrinking of the large ice bodies in the early Holocene. However, no attempt of dating has yet been carried out on the debris masses. The aims of this research are to discuss its possible paraglacial origin by combining four dating benchmarks: (i) the dating of a succession of raised beaches on which the rock avalanche material lies. The higher beaches, exceeding 65 m a. s. l., have been dated older than 12000 BP. Beaches between 43 and 50 m a. s. l. have been dated older than 11300 and 9900 BP and beaches at 22 - 31 m a. s. l. between 9900 and 9600 BP. Regression below the present sea level occurred about 9000 BP (Rundgren et al., 1997). As the rock avalanche deposit does not display visible evidence of being impacted by the glacio-isostatic rebound (no inherited sea cliffs are seen at higher elevation than the actual sea level), we estimate the rock avalanche occurred later than 9000 BP. (ii) the tephrochronological dating from the excavations made in the upper part of the mass, where peat areas developed since the setting of the rock avalanche goes back to 4500 years BP, with the H 4 Hekla acid white thick layer found at 140 cm depth. The deposits from Hekla are well known in the area, and the five most common ash layers were discovered in the opened section, providing a significant time marker. (iii) 14 C dating of birches (Betula sp.) trunk and <b>branches</b> <b>pieces</b> found 80 cm below the H 4 layer. The results are not yet available, but the period around 8000 BP is considered at those latitudes as a warm period, favourable to tree development. (iv) basalt samples were collected on the rock avalanche deposit, at various elevations and settings on the deposit, to provide Cosmic Ray Exposure ages. To specify the age of the landslide, we will measure 10 Be within the pyroxene minerals constituting the basalt. Beryllium isotopic ratios will be measured at the laboratory of CEREGE by Accelerator Mass Spectrometry. The results are in progress. Collectively, those chronological benchmarks constrain the trigerring of the rock avalanche event between 9000 BP (present-day sea-level) and 4500 BP (tephrochronology oldest dating). The finding of a large amount of wood long before the H 4 tephra layer suggests that the occurrence of the rock avalanche was closer to the oldest extremity of this time period (so-called early birch period, just around 9000 BP, according to Einarsson 1991, and Óladóttir et al. 2001). Such results comfort the Ólafur Jónsson idea, proposing the occurrence of such mass movement as the result of a rapid paraglacial crisis following the deglaciation period, due to the combined effects of rockwall debuttressing and glacio-isostatic uplift. The cosmogenic and 14 C results will provide a more accurate data for the chronological scenario. References Einarsson Þ., 1991. Geology of Iceland, rocks and landscape.

Snags are important as sites for biofilm growth and for shelter and feeding of aquatic invertebrates in both lowland and upland rivers and streams.In Australia, the role of freshwater snags has been largely ignored until recently, and more than one million snags have been removed from the Murray-Darling basin. Large tracts of the lowland reaches of the Murray-Darling system are now devoid of the snags that native fish like Murray cod require for shelter and breeding. The damage such wholesale snag removal has caused is clearly enormous, but is difficult to quantify (but see http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1526-100X.2002.01043.x;jsessionid=bzJx9fH83X44rRfwaT?journalCode=rec).

As the dense wood of river red gum is almost impervious to rot it is thought that some of the river red gum snags removed in past decades may have been several thousand years old.|$|R

30|$|Two {{central and}} {{compounding}} limitations exist when using discrete return airborne LiDAR to characterize sub-canopy fuels. First, limitations in the electronics of the LiDAR sensor system {{result in a}} short dead time between the recording of consecutive events. Depending on the speed and altitude of the aircraft, this can correspond to a distance of at least 1 m to 3 m for natural resource acquisitions (Evans et al. 2009). Because of this dead time, if a return occurs from a low-lying <b>branch,</b> shrub, or <b>piece</b> of coarse woody debris, then {{it may not be}} possible to record a ground return (farther away, later in time) from that same pulse. This dead time error can result in incorrect ground surfaces and associated vegetation heights, and effectively leads to a sub-sampling of the vegetation heterogeneity (Evans et al. 2009). The secondary effect is due to absorption of the laser pulse within the canopy and other interrogated material; as more surfaces reflect the energy from a given pulse, there is less energy remaining in the pulse to be reflected by surfaces lower down in the canopy and vegetation. This attenuation creates a bias in the observation towards earlier, stronger returns. Research is needed to evaluate these phenomena under different canopy stand structure and species conditions. One form of validation would be to follow research that has been done to calculate crown bulk density in a per crown basis (Keane et al. 2005) and record the number of branches and size of those branches present within each crown, and thus reconstruct the expected height-return histogram based on the density of branches within the canopy for comparison with LiDAR measurements.|$|R

Recently, the lab discovered that threonyl-tRNA synthetase (TARS) was an angiogenic factor that is linked to ovarian cancer. Studies have shown that a derivative of macrolide inhibitor Borrelidin, known as BC 194, inhibits TARS angiogenic and functional activity and altering TARS conformation. Sites of BC 19 were found and used to generate mutated version of human TARS. Q 566 W and H 388 A TARS mutations were investigated to see whether induced conformational change or loss of aminoacyl-transferase activity {{is the key to}} inhibit angiogenic activity respectively. Q 566 W and H 388 A plasmids were generated using site-directed mutagenesis. The plasmids were expressed in Escherichia coli cells and purified using sonication, protamine sulfate salting, His 6 tag affinity chromatography and Hydroxyapatite chromatography. Purified mutants were found to have a molecular weight of 83 kDa using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Following purification, TARS enzymes were applied to the in vitro tube assay using human umbilical vein endothelial cells to test angiogenic activity. Q 566 W promoted a similar number of <b>pieces</b> and <b>branches</b> as wild type TARS, while H 388 A had the greatest amount tube <b>pieces,</b> <b>branches,</b> and branching length. The study didn’t find a difference in angiogenic activity between the wild type and mutant TARS. However, the study shows that TARS has dose-dependent angiogenic activity and may link to α 5 β 3 intergin migration signaling. More studies on angiogenic activity using integrin inhibitor dose response in vitro tube assay under TARS are needed to verify this mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Let G be {{a finite}} (possibly simple) group, and let p be a prime {{dividing}} {{the order of}} G. The characteristic finite quotients k p ~ G of the universal p-Frattini cover of G are strikingly similar groups. It takes an effort to distinguish them for finding Q regular realizations for the Inverse Galois problem. Let r 3 be a fixed positive integer. This paper starts a program to show one can't realize all these groups as Galois groups of extensions L=Q(x) with at most r branch points. Let C be an r-tuple of p-regular conjugacy classes of G. To compare realizations of these groups we use a sequence of varieties [...] -a Modular Tower [...] -attached to (G; p; C). The notation for this sequence is H(k p ~ G;C), k = 0; 1; : : : : H(k p ~ G;C) is the kth level of the Modular Tower. Crucial properties of level k translate to properties of the characteristic modular representation of k p ~ G. This paper explains properties of these representations supporting the following statement. Conjecture. For each r there exists kr so that for k ? kr, regular realization of k p ~ G over Q requires more than r <b>branch</b> points. Two <b>pieces</b> of geometric information are necessary to prove this. (a) There is a uniform (with k) bound {{on the number of}} absolutely irreducible components at the kth level. (b) For k large H(k p ~ G; C) has no obstructed components. The main example of this paper and [FrK] is G = A 5, p = 2 and C = C 3 r with r = 4 repetitions of the conjugacy class of 3 -cycles. It allows full explanation and illustration of the significance of obstructed components. 1991 Mathematics Subject Classification.

40|$|International audienceSince {{the last}} major deglaciation, about 12 - 10, 000 years ago, paraglacial landforms widely {{occurred}} in fjord and mountain areas; mass movements such as rock-slope failure, rock avalanches, rockslides, sackungs, etc., are common (Dikau et al., 1996; Ballantyne, 2008). In north Iceland, numerous mass movements' landforms occurred, mostly in areas within Tertiary basalt formation, in a landscape characterized by steep slopes and overdeepened glacial valleys. Many of those landforms {{can be observed in}} the Vestfirðir peninsula, in central North Iceland, and in Eastern Iceland. Jónsson (1957) made some early descriptions of such landforms. He concluded that most of those landforms were formed during or shortly after the last deglaciation, in Early Holocene; at the time of these first observations, results on absolute dating were lacking. Recently, several landslides have been studied in the Skagafjörður area (Decaulne et al., 2010, Mercier et al., 2011). The aim {{of this study is to}} date several landslides in the Skagafjörður area, by combining several proxies, e. g. radiocarbon dating, teprhochronology, raised beaches. We present here the result on one of those, the Höfðahólar case-study. - The material originating from the Höfðahólar rock avalanche partly buried a succession of raised beaches. Raised beaches out in the Skagi peninsula, just west of the study area, exceeding 65 m a. s. l., have been dated older than 12, 000 yr B. P. (Rundgren et al., 1997). Beaches between 43 and 50 m a. s. l. have been dated to 11, 300 - 9, 900 yr B. P. and beaches at 22 - 31 m a. s. l. between 9900 and 9600 yr B. P. Regression below the present sea level occurred at 9, 000 yr BP. As the rock avalanche deposit does not display visible evidence of being impacted by the glacio-isostatic rebound, it is believed to be younger than 9, 000 yr B. P. - Tephra layers, occurring in a peat bog on top of the rock avalanche material date the avalanche older than 4, 500 yr B. P., as the H 4 tephra layer is found at 140 cm depth. - 14 C dating of birches (Betula sp.) trunk, <b>branch</b> and root <b>pieces</b> found 80 cm deeper than the H 4 layer provide 6, 070 yr B. C. calibrated age. This period, around 8, 000 yr B. P. is known as the "early birch periode" in Iceland, known to have been warm and favouring tree development (Einarsson 1991, Óladóttir et al. 2001, Langdon et al., 2010). Thus, the Höfðahólar rock avalanche event occurred between 9, 000 B. P. (youngest beaches) and 8, 000 B. P. (14 C oldest dating). Such results comfort Jónsson idea, proposing the occurrence of such landslide as the result of a rapid paraglacial crisis following the deglaciation period, due to the combined effects of glacial oversteepening, supply water throughout the lava piles during glacial melting, and glacio-isostatic uplift...|$|R
