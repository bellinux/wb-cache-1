5|$|With Phil Jackson's {{contract}} expiring, {{the pending}} departures of Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman looming, {{and being in}} the latter stages of an owner-induced lockout of NBA players, Jordan retired {{for the second time}} on January 13, 1999.

5000|$|Aside {{from the}} team expectations, many {{individuals}} on the roster were highly praised during the preseason, none more so than freshman center Jahlil Okafor.

5|$|Dick Versace, the Grizzlies' {{president}} of <b>basketball</b> <b>operations,</b> {{stated in the}} final Vancouver season {{that the company was}} losing US$40million per season.

Versace stated that he felt that the team did not get sufficient support from the business community. Colin Jones, University of Victoria professor in sports economics, stated that it was difficult to attract corporate sponsors as long as the team was losing so many games; the Grizzlies lack of good draft picks lead to the team failing to win, thus losing revenue. He also noted that the team never sought help in the general business community regarding management issues.|$|E
