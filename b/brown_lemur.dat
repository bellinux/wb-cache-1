5|$|Found in {{tropical}} moist lowland and montane forests in southeastern Madagascar, the collared <b>brown</b> <b>lemur</b> occurs {{west to the}} forests of Kalambatritra and in the south from TÃ´lanaro north to the Mananara River. The Mananara River is {{the boundary between the}} ranges of the collared <b>brown</b> <b>lemur</b> and the Gray-headed Lemur to the north. The collared <b>brown</b> <b>lemur</b> {{can be found in the}} littoral forests of Mandena Conservation Zone, Sainte Luce Reserve, and Andohahela National Park.|$|E

500|$|The ring-tailed lemur, ruffed <b>lemurs,</b> [...] and <b>brown</b> <b>lemurs</b> {{were once}} grouped {{together}} in the genus Lemur due {{to a host of}} morphological similarities. [...] For instance, the skeletons of the ring-tailed <b>lemur</b> and the <b>brown</b> <b>lemurs</b> are nearly indistinguishable. However, ruffed lemurs were reassigned to the genus Varecia in 1962, and due to similarities between the ring-tailed lemur and the bamboo lemurs, particularly in regards to molecular evidence and scent gland similarities, the <b>brown</b> <b>lemurs</b> were moved to the genus Eulemur in 1988. The genus Lemur is now monotypic, containing only the ring-tailed lemur.|$|R
50|$|Both <b>brown</b> <b>lemurs</b> {{and mouse}} lemurs were {{initially}} divided {{into a small}} number of species, either with no distinguishable subspecies (in the case of mouse lemurs) or with several distinguishable subspecies (in the case of <b>brown</b> <b>lemurs).</b> With molecular research suggesting a more distant split in both genera, these subspecies or undistinguished populations have been promoted to species status.|$|R
5000|$|The Lemur Conservation Foundation (LCF) {{is a small}} American {{non-profit}} organization that works closely with the Duke Lemur Center, LCF Scientific Advisory Council (including Dr. Ian Tattersall), the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) Prosimian Taxon Advisory Group (TAG), and the Species Survival Plan (SSP) coordinators. [...] Its lemur reserve in Myakka City, Florida, houses ring-tailed <b>lemurs,</b> red-fronted <b>brown</b> <b>lemurs,</b> white-headed lemurs, eastern lesser bamboo lemurs, mongoose lemurs, red ruffed <b>lemurs,</b> common <b>brown</b> <b>lemurs</b> and Sanford's lemurs. [...] Its goals include conservation (including captive breeding and reintroduction), research, and education.|$|R
5|$|Ruffed lemurs, {{along with}} several species of <b>brown</b> <b>lemur</b> were once {{included}} in the genus Lemur. In 1962, the ruffed lemurs were reassigned to the genus Varecia.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs are unusual {{since they}} have great {{variability}} in their social structure, yet generally lack sexual dimorphism in size and canine tooth morphology. However, some species tend towards having larger females, and two species of true lemur (genus Eulemur), the gray-headed lemur (E. albocollaris) and the red lemur (E. rufus), exhibit size differences in canine teeth. True lemurs show sexual dichromatism (sexual differences in fur coloration), but {{the difference between the}} genders varies from strikingly obvious, as in the blue-eyed black lemur (E. macaco), to nearly imperceptible {{in the case of the}} common <b>brown</b> <b>lemur</b> (E. fulvus).|$|E
5|$|Sexual dichromatism (different {{coloration}} patterns {{between males}} and females) {{can be seen in}} most <b>brown</b> <b>lemur</b> species, but otherwise lemurs show very little if any difference in body size or weight between sexes. This lack of sexual dimorphism is not characteristic of all strepsirrhines. Some adapiforms were sexually dimorphic, with males bearing a larger sagittal crest (a ridge of bone {{on the top of the}} skull to which jaw muscles attach) and canine teeth. Lorisoids exhibit some sexual dimorphism, but males are typically no more than 20percent larger than females.|$|E

50|$|True lemurs, {{also known}} as <b>brown</b> <b>lemurs,</b> are the lemurs in genus Eulemur. They are {{medium-sized}} primates that live exclusively on Madagascar.|$|R
5|$|Family Lemuridae {{consists}} of the ring-tailed <b>lemur,</b> the <b>brown</b> <b>lemurs,</b> the bamboo lemurs and the ruffed lemurs. There are 21extant species and six subspecies.|$|R
5|$|Bark {{and plant}} exudates such as tree sap are {{consumed}} {{by a few}} lemur species. The exploitation of exudates {{has been reported in}} 18 plant species and only in the dry regions in the south and west of Madagascar. Only the Masoala fork-marked lemur (Phaner furcifer) and Coquerel's giant mouse lemur regularly consume tree sap. Bark has never been reported as an important food item in lemur diets, but at least four species eat it: the aye-aye, the red-tailed sportive lemur (Lepilemur ruficaudatus), the common <b>brown</b> <b>lemur</b> (Eulemur fulvus), and Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi). Most bark feeding is directly linked to exudate feeding, except for the aye-aye's bark feeding on Afzelia bijuga (genus Afzelia) at Nosy Mangabe in the northeast.|$|E
5|$|Most lemurs have {{retained}} the tapetum lucidum, a reflective layer of {{tissue in the}} eye, which is found in many vertebrates. This trait is absent in haplorrhine primates, and its presence further limits the visual acuity in lemurs. The strepsirrhine choroidal tapetum is unique among mammals because it {{is made up of}} crystalline riboflavin, and the resulting optical scattering is what limits visual acuity. Although the tapetum is considered to be ubiquitous in lemurs, there appear to be exceptions among true lemurs, such as the black lemur and the common <b>brown</b> <b>lemur,</b> as well as the ruffed lemurs. Since the riboflavins in the tapetum have a tendency to dissolve and vanish when processed for histological investigation, however, the exceptions are still debatable.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs have {{traditionally}} been regarded as being less intelligent than anthropoid primates, with monkeys and apes often described as having more cunning, guile, and deceptiveness. Many lemur species, such as sifakas and the ring-tailed lemur, have scored lower on tests designed for monkeys while performing as well as monkeys on other tests. These comparisons may not be fair since lemurs prefer to manipulate objects with their mouths (rather than their hands) and only take interest in objects when in captivity. Recent {{studies have shown that}} lemurs exhibit levels of technical intelligence on par with many other primates, although they manipulate objects less often. Tool use has not been witnessed by lemurs in the wild, although in captivity the common <b>brown</b> <b>lemur</b> and the ring-tailed lemur have been demonstrated to be able to understand and use tools.|$|E

5|$|Since tool use is {{considered}} to be a key feature of primate intelligence, the apparent lack of this behavior in wild lemurs, as well as the lack of non-food object play, has helped reinforce the perception that lemurs are less intelligent than their simian cousins. However, another study at the Myakka City Lemur Reserve examined the representation of tool functionality in both the ring-tailed lemur and the common <b>brown</b> <b>lemur</b> and discovered that, like monkeys, they used tools with functional properties (e.g., tool orientation or ease of use) instead of tools with nonfunctional features (e.g., color or texture). Although the ring-tailed lemur may not use tools in the wild, it can not only be trained to use a tool, but will preferentially select tools based on their functional qualities. Therefore, the conceptual competence to use a tool may have been present in the common primate ancestor, even though the use of tools may not have appeared until much later.|$|E
500|$|Together {{with the}} twelve other true lemurs (genus Eulemur), the {{collared}} <b>brown</b> <b>lemur</b> (E. collaris) {{is a type}} of lemur [...] belonging to the family Lemuridae. [...] Collectively, lemurs (infraorder Lemuriformes) are classified as strepsirrhine primates. [...] Originally listed as a subspecies of the common <b>brown</b> <b>lemur</b> (E. fulvus), the collared <b>brown</b> <b>lemur</b> was promoted to full species status in 2001 by biological anthropologist Colin Groves.|$|E
500|$|The {{collared}} <b>brown</b> <b>lemur</b> {{was listed}} as Endangered in the IUCN Red List assessment. Its greatest threat is habitat loss from slash-and-burn agriculture and charcoal production. [...] It is also hunted for food and captured for the local pet trade. [...] However, populations of the collared <b>brown</b> <b>lemur</b> have been successfully sustained in captivity and continue to provide a safeguard against their extinction.|$|E
50|$|Lemur {{species in}} the Eulemur genus are known to interbreed, despite having {{dramatically}} different chromosome numbers. Red-fronted (2N=60) and collared (2N=50-52) <b>brown</b> <b>lemurs</b> were found to hybridize at Berenty Reserve, Madagascar.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Hybrid zones {{generally}} represent {{areas of}} secondary contact after speciation. The {{nature of the}} interaction between genes of individuals in a hybrid zone is of interest in the study of evolutionary processes. In this study, data from nuclear microsatellites and mitochondrial DNA sequences were used to genetically characterize hybridization between wild mongoose lemurs (Eulemur mongoz) and <b>brown</b> <b>lemurs</b> (E. fulvus) at Anjamena in west Madagascar. Results Two segments of mtDNA have been sequenced and 12 microsatellite loci screened in 162 <b>brown</b> <b>lemurs</b> and mongoose lemurs. Among the mongoose lemur population at Anjamena, we identified two F 1 hybrids (one also having the mtDNA haplotype of E. fulvus) and six other individuals with putative introgressed alleles in their genotype. Principal component analysis groups both hybrids as intermediate between E. mongoz and E. fulvus and admixture analyses revealed an admixed genotype for both animals. Paternity testing proved one F 1 hybrid to be fertile. Of the eight <b>brown</b> <b>lemurs</b> genotyped, all have either putative introgressed microsatellite alleles and/or the mtDNA haplotype of E. mongoz. Conclusion Introgression is bidirectional for the two species, with an indication that it is more frequent in <b>brown</b> <b>lemurs</b> than in mongoose lemurs. We conclude that this hybridization occurs because mongoose lemurs have expanded their range relatively recently. Introgressive hybridization may {{play an important role in}} the unique lemur radiation, as has already been shown in other rapidly evolving animals. </p...|$|R

500|$|In the Anjanaharibe-Sud Special Reserve, {{the silky}} sifaka is shares the same {{geographic}} range as the white-fronted <b>brown</b> <b>lemur</b> (Eulemur albifrons) and an all-black population of indri (Indri indri). [...] In Marojejy National Park, it is sympatric with the white-fronted <b>brown</b> <b>lemur.</b> In 2008, [...] the silky sifaka was suggested to be sympatric {{with the red}} ruffed lemur (Varecia rubra) near Maherivaratra and Andaparaty.|$|E
500|$|The {{collared}} <b>brown</b> <b>lemur</b> (Eulemur collaris), {{also known}} as the red-collared <b>brown</b> <b>lemur</b> or red-collared lemur, is a medium-sized strepsirrhine primate and one of twelve species of <b>brown</b> <b>lemur</b> in the family Lemuridae. [...] It is only found in south-eastern Madagascar. [...] Like most species of lemur, it is arboreal, moving quadrupedally and occasionally leaping from tree to tree. [...] Like other brown lemurs, this species is cathemeral (active during the day and the night; for more information please refer to Cathemerality), lives in social groups, primarily eats fruit, exhibits sexual dichromatism, and does not demonstrate female dominance. [...] The species is listed as Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and is threatened primarily by habitat loss.|$|E

50|$|<b>Brown</b> mouse <b>lemurs</b> are nocturnal creatures, {{which means}} they sleep {{during the day and}} search for food at night. According to National Geographic, <b>brown</b> mouse <b>lemurs</b> consume âinsects, fruit, flowers, and other plants.â They are known to be mostly frugivorous {{primates}} (primarily fruit eating), but they can be omnivorous as well. The <b>brown</b> mouse <b>lemur</b> is able to store âthirty-five percent of their body weightâ in the form of fat. This fat is stored in the lemur's hind legs and tail and is used for energy when food sources are scarce.|$|R
500|$|Most of the 99living lemur taxa {{are found}} only on Madagascar. [...] Two species, the common <b>brown</b> <b>lemur</b> (Eulemur fulvus) and the {{mongoose}} lemur (Eulemur mongoz), {{can also be}} found on the Comoro Islands, although it is assumed that both species were introduced to the islands from northwestern Madagascar by humans within the last few hundred years. Molecular studies on Eulemur fulvus fulvus (from the mainland) and E.f.mayottensis (from the Comoro Islands) and on Comoro and mainland mongoose lemurs have supported this assumption by showing no genetic differences between the two populations. [...] Because all lemurs, including these two <b>brown</b> <b>lemur</b> species, are only native to the island of Madagascar, they are considered to be endemic.|$|E
500|$|In its environment, the {{collared}} <b>brown</b> <b>lemur</b> {{acts as a}} seed disperser, and {{is especially}} critical for the dispersal of large-seeded fruiting trees within its range. [...] However, {{there is no evidence}} that these relationships are coevolutionary and instead these lemurs may be the last remaining seed dispersers for these tree species following the extinction of larger frugivorous birds and subfossil lemurs.|$|E
500|$|The {{collared}} <b>brown</b> <b>lemur</b> {{tends to}} live in social groups that are multi-male/multi-female, with groups {{ranging in size from}} two to seventeen individuals. [...] Population densities are estimated at 14 individuals/km2, and it appears to be common within its range. [...] Females give birth to one offspring between October and December, and male involvement with the young has been observed. [...] Female dominance, a common behavioral trait in many lemur species but uncommon in most true lemurs, has not been observed in this species.|$|E
50|$|The common <b>brown</b> <b>lemur's</b> diet {{consists}} {{primarily of}} fruits, young leaves, and flowers. In some locations it eats invertebrates, such as cicadas, spiders and millipedes. It also eats bark, sap, soil and red clay (see geophagy). It can tolerate {{greater levels of}} toxic compounds from plants than other lemurs can.|$|R
50|$|The <b>brown</b> mouse <b>lemur</b> {{generally}} {{makes its}} home in holes found in trees and nests {{that are made}} of leaves. On occasion, <b>brown</b> mouse <b>lemurs</b> make use of bird nests. They tend to create the nests in relatively large groups. These groups {{are made up of}} the immature young and the females.|$|R
5|$|More taxonomic {{changes have}} {{occurred}} at the genus level, although these revisions have proven more conclusive, often supported by genetic and molecular analysis. The most noticeable revisions included the gradual split of a broadly defined genus Lemur into separate genera for the ring-tailed lemur, ruffed <b>lemurs,</b> and <b>brown</b> <b>lemurs</b> due {{to a host of}} morphological differences.|$|R
