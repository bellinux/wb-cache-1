5000|$|In 1967 David Furley de-emphasized the {{importance}} of the swerve in both Epicurus and Lucretius so as to defend Epicurus from the [...] "extreme" [...] libertarian view that our actions are caused directly by random swerves. (Bailey had also denied this [...] "traditional interpretation".) Furley argues for a strong connection between the ideas of Aristotle and Epicurus on autonomous actions that are [...] "up to us". If we now put together the introduction to Lucretius' passage on voluntas and Aristotle's theory of the voluntary, we can see how the swerve of atoms was supposed to do its work. Aristotle's criterion of the voluntary was a negative one: the source of the voluntary action is in the agent himself, {{in the sense that it}} cannot be traced back beyond or outside the agent himself. Lucretius says that voluntas must be saved from a succession of causes which can be traced back to infinity. All he needs to satisfy the Aristotelian criterion is a <b>break</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>succession</b> of causes, so that the source of an action cannot be traced back to something occurring before the birth of the agent.The swerve, then, plays a purely negative part in Epicurean psychology. It saves voluntas from necessity, as Lucretius says it does, but it does not feature in every act of voluntas.|$|E

60|$|To {{this cause}} of minor <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>succession</b> of organic forms--a cause {{on which we}} have dwelt because {{it has not been}} taken into account--we must add sundry others. Besides these periodically-recurring changes of climate, there are the {{irregular}} ones produced by redistributions of land and sea; and these, sometimes less, sometimes greater, <b>in</b> degree, than <b>the</b> rhythmical changes, must, like them, cause in each region emigrations and immigrations of species; and consequent breaks, small or large as the case may be, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> paleontological series. Other and more special geological changes must produce other and more local blanks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>succession.</b> By some inland elevation the natural drainage of a continent is modified; and instead of the sediment previously brought down to the sea by it, a great river brings down sediment unfavourable to various plants and animals living in its delta: whereupon these disappear from the locality, perhaps to re-appear in a changed form after a long epoch. Upheavals or subsidences of shores or sea-bottoms, involving deviations of marine currents, remove the habitats of many species to which such currents are salutary or injurious; and further, this redistribution of currents alters the places of sedimentary deposits, and thus stops the burying of organic remains in some localities, while commencing it in others. Had we space, many more such causes of blanks in our paleontological records might be added. But it is needless here to enumerate them. They are admirably explained and illustrated in Sir Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology.|$|R

60|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> last {{edition of}} his Outlines of Astronomy, Sir John Herschel recognizes this as an element in {{geological}} processes; regarding it as possibly a part-cause of those climatic changes indicated by {{the records of the}} Earth's past. That it has {{had much to do with}} those larger changes of climate of which we have evidence, seems unlikely, since there is reason to think that these have been far slower and more lasting; but that it must have entailed a rhythmical exaggeration and mitigation of the climates otherwise produced, seems beyond question. And it seems also beyond question that there must have been a consequent rhythmical change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distribution of organisms--a rhythmical change to which we here wish to draw attention, as one cause of minor <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>succession</b> of fossil remains. Each species of plant and animal has certain limits of heat and cold within which only it can exist; and these limits in a great degree determine its geographical position. It will not spread north of a certain latitude, because it cannot bear a more northern winter, nor south of a certain latitude, because the summer heat is too great; or else it is indirectly restrained from spreading further by the effect of temperature on the humidity of the air, or on the distribution of the organisms it lives upon. But now, what will result from a slow alteration of climate, produced as above described? Supposing the period we set out from is that <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> contrast of seasons is least marked, it is manifest that during the progress towards the period of most violent contrast, each species of plant and animal will gradually change its limits of distribution--will be driven back, here by the winter's increasing cold, and there by the summer's increasing heat--will retire into those localities that are still fit for it. Thus during 10,000 years, each species will ebb away from certain regions it was inhabiting; and during the succeeding 10,000 years will flow back into those regions. From the strata there forming, its remains will disappear; they will be absent from some of the superposed strata; and will be found in strata higher up. But in what shapes will they re-appear? Exposed during the 21,000 years of their slow recession and their slow return, to changing conditions of life, they are likely to have undergone modifications; and will probably re-appear with slight differences of constitution and perhaps of form--will be new varieties or perhaps new sub-species.|$|R

5000|$|He {{was elected}} on 1 August 1559 but, given the {{turbulence}} and executions that had preceded Elizabeth's accession, {{it was difficult}} to find the requisite four bishops willing and qualified to consecrate Parker, and not until 19 December was that ceremony performed at Lambeth by William Barlow, formerly Bishop of Bath and Wells, John Scory, formerly Bishop of Chichester, Miles Coverdale, formerly Bishop of Exeter, and John Hodgkins, Bishop of Bedford. The allegation of an indecent consecration <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Nag's Head Fable seems first to have been made by the Jesuit Christopher Holywood in 1604, and has since been discredited. Parker's consecration was, however, legally valid only by the plenitude of the royal supremacy; the Edwardine Ordinal, which was used, had been repealed by Mary Tudor and not re-enacted by the parliament of 1559. Although the Papal Commission which pronounced Anglican Orders [...] "null and void" [...] in 1896 could not dispute that <b>the</b> 'manual' <b>succession,</b> that is, <b>the</b> actual laying on of hands and prayer, had not been broken in as much as two of the four consecrators of Parker, Barlow and Hodgkins, had been ordained with <b>the</b> Roman Pontifical <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Latin Rite <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1530s, and all of them had been made bishops by bishops who were consecrated with the Roman Pontifical, the Roman Catholic Church asserted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> condemnation of 1896 that [...] "defect of form and intent" [...] of consecration were insufficient to make a bishop, and therefore represented a <b>break</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> apostolic <b>succession,</b> but <b>the</b> Church of England has rejected this, arguing that the form of words used made no difference to the substance or validity of the act, and that <b>the</b> words <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Rite itself gave plenty of evidence as to the intent. The Roman Catholic viewpoint stated that the Rite to be valid had to include the intent to make a sacrificing priest. The Anglicans retorted that the only things that ordination rites had <b>in</b> common throughout <b>the</b> history of the Church was the laying on of hands and prayer. In any case Parker was already a 'sacrificing' priest as he had been ordained as such <b>in</b> 1527 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Latin Rite and before the break with Rome. Elizabeth wanted a moderate man, so she chose Parker. There was also an emotional attachment. Parker had been the favourite chaplain of Elizabeth's mother, Anne Boleyn. Before Anne was arrested in 1536, she had entrusted Elizabeth's spiritual well-being to Parker. A few days after this, Anne had been executed following charges of adultery, incest and treason. Parker also possessed all the qualifications Elizabeth expected from an archbishop, except celibacy. Elizabeth had a strong prejudice against married clergy, and in addition she seems to have disliked Margaret Parker personally, often treating her so rudely that her husband was [...] "in horror to hear it." [...] After a visit to Lambeth, the Queen duly thanked her hostess but maliciously asked how she should address her, [...] "For Madam I may not call you, mistress I should be ashamed to call you".|$|R
40|$|Faculty of Science School of Geoscience 0313950 n madgerber@yahoo. comU-Pb ID-TIMS ages are {{reported}} for several magmatic and anatectic phases from the Kalak Nappe Complex (KNC), northern Norwegian Scandinavian Caledonides. Euhedral prismatic zircons from {{a suite of}} plutons intruding the metaturbidite sequences of the Hellefjord Group, Sørøy-Seiland Nappe (upper KNC) yielded intrusion ages of 440. 9 ± 1. 5 Ma for a syenogranite, and 435. 9 ± 1. 6 Ma and 436. 7 ± 0. 8 Ma, respectively, for a granite and gabbro. The period of magmatic activity was followed closely by a phase of deformation associated with upper amphibolite-granulite facies metamorphism at c. 430 Ma. This caused local anatexis <b>in</b> <b>the</b> granite and growth of magmatic zircon (429. 5 ± 1. 4 Ma), {{as well as the}} common growth of metamorphic titanite (431. 4 ± 1 Ma and 427. 8 ± 2. 7 Ma). These late Ordovician-early Silurian ages link this tectonometamorphic activity to the Scandian phase of the Scandinavian Caledonian orogeny. Evidence for Scandian tectonometamorphic activity is also recorded at c. 425 Ma <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Klubben Group of the Olderfjord Nappe (lower KNC). This is documented by the intrusion of a granodiorite pegmatite (425. 9 ± 0. 7 Ma) and anatexis of the Klubben Group (425. 5 ± 1. 3 Ma). <b>In</b> addition, <b>the</b> Klubben Group records a c. 980 Ma Grenvillian age for anatectic veins crosscutting an earlier fabric (980. 9 ± 2. 6 Ma, syenogranitic leucosome), linking the initial evolution of the Klubben Group to the amalgamation of Rodinia. It is suggested that a previously undetected structural <b>break</b> exists <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sørøy <b>Succession</b> of <b>the</b> KNC at base of the Hellefjord Group. This is supported by c. 441 - 436 Ma Scandian ages obtained for bimodal magmatic activity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hellefjord, which does not relate to the intrusion of the SIP further down <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sørøy <b>Succession</b> at c. 570 - 560 and c. 530 - 520 Ma.

6000|$|Before {{seeking a}} {{solution}} of the problem thus raised, let us glance at the several minor causes which produce <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> geological <b>succession</b> of organic forms; taking first, the more general ones which modify climate, and, therefore, the distribution of life. Among these may be noted one which has not, we believe, been named by writers on the subject. We mean that resulting from a certain slow astronomic rhythm, by which {{the northern and southern}} hemispheres are alternately subject to greater extremes of temperature. <b>In</b> consequence of <b>the</b> slight ellipticity of its orbit, the Earth's distance from the sun varies to the extent of some 3,000,000 of miles. At present, the aphelion occurs at the time of our northern summer; and the perihelion during the summer of <b>the</b> southern hemisphere. <b>In</b> consequence, however, of that slow movement of the Earth's axis which produces the precession of the equinoxes, this state of things will in time be reversed: the Earth will be nearest to the sun during the summer of the northern hemisphere, and furthest from it during the southern summer or northern winter. The period required to complete the slow movement producing these changes, is nearly 26,000 years; and were there no modifying process, the two hemispheres would alternately experience this coincidence of summer with relative nearness to the sun, during a period of 13,000 years. But there is also a still slower change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> direction of the axis major of the Earth's orbit; from which it results that the alternation we have described is completed in about 21,000 years. That is to say, if at a given time the Earth is nearest to the sun at our mid-summer, and furthest from the sun at our mid-winter; then, in 10,500 years afterwards, it will be furthest from the sun at our mid-summer, and nearest at our mid-winter. Now the difference between the distances from the sun at the two extremes of this alternation, amounts to one-thirtieth; and hence, the difference between the quantities of heat received from the sun on a summer's day under these opposite conditions amounts to one-fifteenth. Estimating this, not with reference to the zero of our thermometers, but with reference to the temperature of the celestial spaces, Sir John Herschel calculates [...] "23° Fahrenheit, as the least variation of temperature under such circumstances which can reasonably be attributed to the actual variation of the sun's distance." [...] Thus, then, each hemisphere has at a certain epoch, a short summer of extreme heat, followed by a long and very cold winter. Through <b>the</b> slow change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> direction of the Earth's axis, these extremes are gradually mitigated. And at the end of 10,500 years, there is reached the opposite state--a long and moderate summer, with a short and mild winter. At present, <b>in</b> consequence of <b>the</b> predominance of sea <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southern hemisphere, the extremes to which its astronomical conditions subject it, are much ameliorated; while the great proportion of land <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northern hemisphere, tends to exaggerate such contrast as now exists in it between winter and summer: whence it results that the climates of the two hemispheres are not widely unlike. But 10,000 years hence, the northern hemisphere will undergo annual variations of temperature far more marked than now.|$|R
40|$|We report new palaeomagnetic {{data for}} red beds from the Ediacaran Brachina and Wonoka {{formations}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Adelaide Geosyncline, South Australia, and discuss their place with previously determined poles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Ediacaran apparent polar wander path for Australia. Both formations behave similarly on thermal demagnetization, displaying high-temperature components that decay to the origin at 680 ◦C, consistent with haematite {{being the only}} magnetic mineral present. Restoring the strata to the palaeohorizontal yielded positive fold tests for both units at 99 per cent confidence, indicating that acquisition of magnetization occurred before the early Palaeozoic Delamerian Orogeny. For the Brachina Formation (N = 91 specimens) the mean direction after unfolding is declination D = 178. 2 ◦, inclination I = – 22. 6 ◦ (α 95 = 4. 4 ◦), indicating a palaeolatitude λ = 11. 8 ± 2. 5 ◦ and a pole position at latitude λp = 46. 0 ◦S, longitude ϕp = 315. 4 ◦E, with confidence semi-axes dp = 2. 4 ◦ and dm = 4. 6 ◦. The mean direction for the Wonoka Formation after unfolding (N = 70) is D = 255. 9 ◦, I = – 23. 7 ◦ (α 95 = 6. 4 ◦), indicating λ = 12. 3 + 3. 8 /– 3. 4 ◦ and a pole position at latitude λp = 5. 2 ◦S, longitude ϕp = 30. 5 ◦E (dp = 3. 6 ◦ and dm = 6. 8 ◦). The mean directions for these units and other Ediacaran units <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Adelaide Geosyncline are significantly different from each other, which excludes blanket remagnetization of the units before Delamerian folding and therefore gives strong preference to their magnetization dating from close {{to the time of}} deposition. The late Cryogenian–Ediacaran–Cambrian apparent polar wander path for South Australia spans 150 Myr from ∼ 635 to 490 Ma and places Australia in low palaeolatitudes throughout the interval studied. The poles differ significantly from each other, suggesting Australia underwent continual drift during that time. Whereas the directional difference between the late Cryogenian Elatina Formation and early Ediacaran Nuccaleena Formation is mainly in inclination, for most other contiguous stratigraphic units the differences are mainly in declination with minor inclination differences, indicating Australia was rotating about a nearby Euler pole <b>in</b> low palaeolatitudes. <b>The</b> large and perhaps rapid polar shifts at 615 – 590 and 575 – 565 Ma <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Laurentian apparent polar wander path are not evident <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Ediacaran apparent polar wander path for Australia.

40|$|This PhD thesis was {{embedded}} in a regional groundwater study <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Paleozoic Wajid Sandstone of southwest Saudi Arabia. The Wajid Sandstone holds important fossil groundwater resources in southwest Saudi Arabia which became increasingly overused due to extensive irrigation for agricultural purpose. This thesis contributed to this groundwater project by evaluating the hydraulic properties of aquifer rocks. This involved also fundamental questions about the sedimentary facies, depositional environments, stratigraphy, architecture, age, and petrology of the Wajid Sandstone Group. The fundamental concept of this PhD thesis {{is based on the}} principle of out-crop-analogue studies, i. e. properties of reservoir rocks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> subsurface are investigated <b>in</b> outcrops at <b>the</b> surface. This concept is applicable for the Wajid Sandstone because of a well exposed outcrop belt and extractions wells whose aquifer rocks are exposed only few kilometres from the well location. The outcrop-analogue studies included all basic parameters of reservoir characterization. The major focus was on 1 D standard sections where samples were preferentially taken for further analysis. In particular for heterogenous glacigenic deposits also 2 D wall panels were composed and analysed. Field surveys lasted altogether around 4 months. The extensive sample collection was sent to Germany and all laboratory and microscopic work was done at the Institut für Angewandte Geowissenschaften of TU Darmstadt. This included measurements and analysis of gamma-ray, porosity, permeability, and thin sections as well as stratigraphic work applying palynology. The multiple data were merged into one data base and analysed by multivariate statistics and principal component analysis. The study area is located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south-western part of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and comprises the entire outcrop belt of the Wajid Group (ca. 44, 000 km 2). Correlation of sections is mainly based on unconformities that subdivide <b>the</b> <b>succession</b> into distinct stratigraphic packages. In its outcrop belt, the Wajid Group can be subdivided into 5 formations: the Dibsiyah Formation, Sanamah Formation, Qalibah Formation, Khusayyayn Formation, and Juwayl Formation. Thirteen lithofacies have been distinguished (LF 1 through LF 13), which cover the entire spectrum of siliciclastic grain size classifications. Shales and siltstones are relatively rare <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>succession,</b> whereas sandstones, especially medium-grained to coarse-grained sandstones are abundant. Conglomerates are locally abundant <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sanamah Formation and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Juwayl Formation. A second order descriptor is bioturbation, which is very common <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Dibsiyah Formation, but rare to absent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other units. The 13 lithofacies have been combined in 9 lithofacies associations (LF-A 1 through LF-A 9). By stacking the different sections a new standard lithostratigraphic log is presented in this thesis. Sediments of the Wajid Group were deposited during approximately 200 Ma to 260 Ma, depending on the definite depositional age of the Dibsiyah Formation. Extrapolations of sedimentation rates to depositional time show that within the Wajid Group and under the assumption of very conservative sedimentation rates, 62 Ma years are represented <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sediments: 20 Ma <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Dibsiyah Formation, 2 Ma (the length of <b>the</b> Hirnantian) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sanamah Formation, 15 Ma <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Khusayyayn Formation, and 25 Ma <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Juwayl Formation. Most likely, the time represented is much less. This means that the sediments preserved do not even cover ¼ of the Palaeozoic era. This is compatible with field observations of abundant unconformities and sedimentary <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> starved <b>successions.</b> This indicates that throughout the Palaeozoic, southern Saudi Arabia was located in an epicratonal setting, in which tectonic subsidence and relative sea level changes exerted only minor control. A specific aim {{of this study was to}} systematically explore the heterogeneous glacial and proglacial deposits, develop a genetic depositional model and compare the findings with other regions at the northern rim of Gondwana. Saudi Arabia is one of the few places where both glaciations can be studied in well-preserved sedimentary succession, which formed under similar boundary conditions. Among these are (a) incision of subglacial tunnel valleys according to the ice-loading model, (b) subsequent valley-fill by subaqueous to subaerial proglacial deposits in front of an oscillating, polythermal ice-shield, (c) intra-formational erosional events through repeated ice advance, (d) widespread and large-scale soft sediment deformation due to glacial surge during deglaciation, (e) marine transgression as a consequence of eustatic sea-level rise following deglaciation. The general pattern fits well with observations from northern Africa, pointing to closely coupled glaciological processes along the northern margin of the Gondwana ice-shield during Upper Ordovician glaciation. Although the same general patterns apply for the Permo-Carboniferous glaciation, styles and petrographical properties differ most probably due to a more complex ice-flow pattern with a rougher topography after the Hercynian event and contrasting weathering. This thesis presents the first statistical analysis of porosities and permeabilities over the entire Wajid Sandstone Group <b>in</b> <b>the</b> outcrop belt and links these values with lithofacies and microfacies studies in order to identify controlling factors. Furthermore, for the first time a combined approach of standard mini permemeter and sophisticated column permeameter measurements were carried out, the latter enables to convert gas in water permeabilities. Although the data of this thesis confirms the overall good reservoir quality, also wide scatter is obvious. This is particularly the case for permeabilities. High porosities do not guarantee high permeabilities and correlation of both is weak, although a positive trend exists. This means that porosities cannot be used to predict permeabilities accurately. Medians of porosities range from 23 to 27...|$|R
