500|$|Allison rebuilt his accelerator, {{which he}} called the [...] "kevatron", because it could {{accelerate}} particles to energies of 400 KeV. The name was {{a reference to the}} massive bevatron being built at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, which was planned to accelerate particles to <b>billions</b> of <b>electron</b> <b>volts.</b> Allison still believed that there were useful results still to be found with low energies. He became a pioneer of what became known as [...] "heavy ion physics", accelerating protons and deuterons, and using lithium and beryllium as targets.

5000|$|To reach still higher energies, with {{relativistic}} mass approaching or exceeding the rest {{mass of the}} particles (for protons, <b>billions</b> of <b>electron</b> <b>volts</b> or GeV), {{it is necessary to}} use a synchrotron. This is an accelerator in which the particles are accelerated in a ring of constant radius. An immediate advantage over cyclotrons is that the magnetic field need only be present over the actual region of the particle orbits, which is much narrower than that of the ring. (The largest cyclotron built in the US had a 184 in magnet pole, whereas the diameter of synchrotrons such as the LEP and LHC is nearly 10 km. The aperture of the two beams of the LHC is of the order of a centimeter.) ...|$|R

The gamma-ray spectrum is well modeled with emission from protons and nuclei.

5000|$|Electromagnetic {{waves are}} {{typically}} described {{by any of}} the following three physical properties: the frequency f, wavelength λ, or photon energy E. Frequencies observed in astronomy range from [...] (1 GeV gamma rays) down to the local plasma frequency of the ionized interstellar medium (~1 kHz). Wavelength is inversely proportional to the wave frequency, so gamma rays have very short wavelengths that are fractions of the size of atoms, whereas wavelengths on {{the opposite end of the}} spectrum can be as long as the universe. Photon energy is directly proportional to the wave frequency, so gamma ray photons have the highest energy (around a <b>billion</b> <b>electron</b> <b>volts),</b> while radio wave photons have very low energy (around a femtoelectronvolt).

Rolf-Dieter Heuer, the director general of CERN, said that it was too soon to know for sure whether it is an entirely new particle, which weighs in at 125 <b>billion</b> <b>electron</b> <b>volts</b> - one of the heaviest subatomic particles yet - or, indeed, the elusive particle predicted by the Standard Model, the theory that has ruled physics for the last half-century. It is unknown if this particle is an impostor, a single particle or even the first of many particles yet to be discovered. The latter possibilities are particularly exciting to physicists since they could point the way to new deeper ideas, beyond the Standard Model, about the nature of reality. For now, some physicists are calling it a [...] "Higgslike" [...] particle. Joe Incandela, of the University of California, Santa Barbara, said, [...] "It's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years, going way back to the discovery of quarks, for example." [...] The groups operating the large detectors in the collider said that the likelihood that their signal was a result of a chance fluctuation was less than one chance in 3.5 million, so-called [...] "five sigma," [...] which is the gold standard in physics for a discovery.

40|$|Novae are {{thermonuclear}} explosions on a {{white dwarf}} surface fueled by mass accreted from a companion star.

We propose that the material of the nova shell interacts with the dense ambient medium of the red giant primary and that particles can be accelerated effectively to produce pi(0) decay gamma-rays from proton-proton interactions. Emission involving inverse Compton scattering of the red giant radiation is also considered and is not ruled out. Z 9...|$|E

Furthermore, one specific project of STAR is to analyze how quark, gluons, and orbital angular momentum contribute to the proton spin. Spin is a particle's intrinsic angular momentum, a property of particles as basic as mass and electrical charge. In addition, by colliding beams of polarized protons, physicists can examine the structure underlying the proton's spin. In order to help advance the understanding of the proton spin, my research focuses on detectors that at very forward positions record the asymmetry of neutrons produced by collisions.

40|$|A {{sprawling}} {{group of}} buildings on an impressive campus site in the Berkeley hills provides {{the home of the}} Radiation Laboratory of the University of California. A succession of large accelerators has been built there, the latest of which is the Bevatron. It is the largest and highest-energy accelerator in operation at the present time. It was built and is operated under contract with the United States Atomic Energy Commission. It is of the type known as a proton synchrotron, of which there are two others in operation, one at the University of Birmingham, England, whose energy is 1 Bev (<b>billion</b> <b>electron</b> <b>volts),</b> and another at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, known as the Cosmotron, which operates at 3 Bev. The Bevatron accelerates protons (stripped nuclei of hydrogen atoms) to an energy of 6. 2 Bev. The design was started in 1947 under the direction of Professor E. O. Lawrence, and although it was the product of collaboration of a large group of physicists and engineers, the original conception was due to William Brobeck who also contributed more than any other individual. A working quarter-scale model was built and operated in 1948 and 1949 to verify the correctness of the design concept. Construction of the full-scale machine was completed in five years, and operation began in the spring of 1954. A period of adjustment and tuning up followed, and since September 1954 it has been the center of a most active and profitable program in high-energy physics. One new particle has been discovered, and an abundance of previously rare and poorly understood particles (heavy mesons and hyperons) has been provided for study. The program has had participants from laboratories all over the United States and from a half dozen other countries, in addition to the staff at the University of California. This article first describes the Bevatron and its operation, and then discusses a portion of the research program.
