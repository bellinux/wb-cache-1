In 1999 the Long Branch Historical Museum Association began fundraising efforts to save the building. The {{first step was to}} stabilize the building to prevent it from collapsing. The wood flooring was removed and reinforced concrete was poured to support the <b>building.</b> <b>Steel</b> supports replaced wooden pilasters that had deteriorated. The stained-glass windows, original altar, organ, and handmade pews were removed and put in storage during renovation.|$|E
25|$|The Contemporary Tower, {{the most}} {{prominent}} of the resort's four stand-alone buildings, was built as an A-frame with outer walls which slope inwards around an inner atrium. This design was a collaboration by Disney, the United States Steel Corporation, and Los Angeles architect Welton Becket. To construct the <b>building,</b> <b>steel</b> frames were erected on-site and modular pre-constructed rooms, designed by California architect Donald Wexler, were lifted into place by crane. Most of Disney's Polynesian Village Resort and the Court of Flags Resort were built the same way, except rooms were stacked instead of slid in.|$|E

There was a lull in building after the First World War and social change undermined the construction of rural country houses. Isolated examples included the houses that combined modern and traditional elements, designed by Basil Spence and built at Broughton Place (1936) and Gribloch (1937–9). After World War Two a shortage of building materials further reduced the number of large luxury houses. Isolated examples included Logan House, designed by David Style in the 1950s. In the 1960s there was Basil Hughes's design at Snaigow for the earl of Cadogan and the remodelling of Gask House by Claude Phillimore. This period also saw considerable restoration of existing houses.|$|E

2500|$|Andrey Pervozvanny and Imperator Pavel I saw {{very limited}} {{seagoing}} service in 1910 through 1912; their few voyages within the Russian Baltic waters were trials, rather than active duty.

2500|$|The war proved seminal for Spain as well. The loss of Cuba, {{which was}} seen {{not as a}} colony {{but as part of}} Spain itself, was {{traumatic}} for the Spanish government and Spanish people. This trauma led to the rise of the Generation of '98, a group of young intellectuals, authors, and artists who were deeply critical of what they perceived as conformism and ignorance {{on the part of the}} Spanish people. They successfully called for a new [...] "Spanish national spirit" [...] that was politically active, anti-authoritarian, and generally anti-imperialistic and anti-military. The war also greatly benefited Spain economically. No longer spending large sums to maintain its colonies, significant amounts of capital were suddenly repatriated for use domestically. This sudden and massive influx of capital led to the development for the first time of large, modern industries in banking, chemicals, electrical power generation, manufacturing, ship <b>building,</b> <b>steel,</b> and textiles.|$|E

40|$|Steel and {{concrete}} composite systems are generally used as major structural components in multi-storey <b>buildings.</b> <b>Steel</b> decking {{is a more}} common composite system in buildings since {{it serves as a}} working platform to support the construction loads and also acts as a permanent formwork for concrete. To achieve large column-free spans (in the range of 8 m- 12 m), as often demanded in multi-storey office <b>buildings,</b> <b>steel</b> {{and concrete}} composite floor trusses may form economical solutions since they are able to accommodate various service ducts within the structural zone. The concept of introducing a concrete-filled steel tube (CFST) instead of the conventional open-flanged steel section, as the top chord of these floor trusses has been discussed. However, the viability of this new concept should be ensured with experimental evidence on the longitudinal shear transfer capacity at the composite stage. This paper discusses the experimental results of a series of push-off tests conducted on CFST embedded composite slab panels. The effect of providing different concrete top covers and the effect of different concrete strengths were investigated and the results compared with existing guidelines for headed shear studs...|$|R

Specifically, an optimization method {{has been developed}} to minimize the structure cost of tall <b>steel</b> <b>buildings</b> subject to dynamic acceleration and drift constraints, and practical sizing requirements. The explicit formulation of the optimal design problem is first {{expressed in terms of}} design variables. The Kuhn-Tucker optimality necessary conditions are then rigorously derived and, lastly, the solution methodology is presented based on the so-called Guide-Weight method. It has been found that the optimization approach is efficient and, thus, most suitable for large-scale complex structures, such as tall <b>steel</b> <b>buildings...</b>|$|R
