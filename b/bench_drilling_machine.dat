5000|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1856 by Arthur Wallis and Charles Haslam in newly built {{premises}} which they named The North Hants Ironworks. The works were sited on Station Hill in Basingstoke and the company began trading as Wallis & Haslam. Shortly afterwards the company was highly commended for its hand-worked <b>bench</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> at the 1857 Royal Agricultural show in Salisbury. Even at this early stage, the company was producing {{a wide variety of}} agricultural equipment, and alongside the bench drill were corn drills, turnip drills, four types of horse hoe, drag harrows, a 3 hp threshing machine, a barley hummeller and sundry other devices. In 1862 a third partner, Charles James Steevens, joined the company and when Charles Haslam retired in 1869 the company became Wallis & Steevens.The date of production for the company's first Portable steam engine is not known although the earliest surviving drawing is dated 1866. The first traction engine, an 8 hp single, was built in 1877 from drawings by Arthur Herbert Wallis (son of the company founder) and this vehicle made its trial run on 21 June that year. The vehicle, named [...] "Success" [...] on the strength of its performance during the test, was given the works number T250.|$|E

The tribological properties and the application performance in Q 235 steel machining of the nanoparticles as water-based lubricant additives were investigated on an MSR- 10 D four-ball tribotester and on a <b>bench</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>machine,</b> respectively. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM) were used to analyze the worn surface. The results show that the surface-modified TiO 2 nanoparticles can remarkably improve the load-carrying capacity, the friction reducing, and anti wear abilities of pure water. The wear scar diameter and the coefficient of friction of the water-based lubricating fluids with TiO 2 nanoparticles decreased, and the thick deep furrows on the surface of wear scar also decreased obviously with the increase of TiO 2 concentration. The power consumption in drilling process was lower and the cutting surface was smoother using the water-based lubricating fluids added TiO 2 nanoparticles compared to the fluid without addition. The reason for nanoparticles improving tribological properties of water based lubricating fluid might be the formation of a dynamic deposition film during rubbing process according to analysis of the worn surface...|$|E

40|$|<b>Drilling</b> <b>machine</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} machine tools in industry except lathe and frais <b>machine.</b> <b>Drilling</b> <b>machine</b> has an important role on production proceses. But, vibration while drilling operation that caused by chatter or machine faults made the product output failure. One of the machine faults types is mass unbalance that can reduce the quality of product geometry. Therefore, dynamic behaviour analyze is necessary to prevent this mass unbalance will not happen. So, we did the dynamic behaviour analyze of <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> used ANSYS 11. 0 Workbench. The aim of this research is to find out the natural frequency and the mode shape of <b>drilling</b> <b>machine,</b> could to display their mode shape deformation with damping caused by excitation forces 100 N, and could to display FRF and FFT graphics caused by mass unbalance. In order to achieve the aims, modal analysis method has been adopted. Here, principal structures and their material which influence the stiffness of the <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> were modeled used SolidWork 2007 software. The <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> were modeled in three configuration of head body position. Software ANSYS 11. 0 Workbench used to determine FRF. As the results, the different configuration of head body position has been influence the dynamic behaviour structure that can be signed with the different of natural frequency. More higher the natural frequency, more higher the stiffness and it’s allow the structure difficult to vibrate. From the FRF, we know that the increase operation rotation of <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> allow higher vibration velocity that caused by mass unbalance. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{generally}} {{about how the}} mechanical system reacts when a load is given or friction is happen to touch the mechanical system. Every mechanical system will always be affected {{when there is a}} disturbance. Drilling operation is one of the common operations in the industry. When the drilling operation works, there must be a friction occurs when the work is done. Thus, there will be lack of performance for the <b>drilling</b> <b>machine.</b> The lack of the performance of the <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> will lead to the speed of the machine that will decrease slightly. That is the main part of this project. To make the performance of the <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> maintain, the speed must be increase as soon the friction is given to the <b>drilling</b> <b>machine.</b> To solve the problem, the Fuzzy Logic Method is use in this project. Using Fuzzy Logic Method, new equation will be finding and use it for this project. From the method, the speed of the motor will increase when the drilling operation is given a friction. There will be feedback for the error that the sensors detect from the <b>drilling</b> <b>machine.</b> The feedback will calculate the error and from the calculation the new increasing voltage will be determined. For the conclusion, the method is trying to find the new voltage for the <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> to maintain the speed of the machine. From the fact, we know that when the voltage in increase, the speed will also increase. Thus, the performance of the <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> will become more efficient...|$|R
