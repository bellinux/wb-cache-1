40|$|The {{conventional}} {{implementation of}} Katsevich’s inversion formula involves the computation of PI segment. This {{is done by}} solving a nonlinear equation with a numerical algorithm such as Newton’s method. In this study, we develop an implementation of Katsevich’s inversion formula without computing PI segment. Our implementation involves a new concept, cone <b>beam</b> <b>cover,</b> which {{is closely related to}} PI segment and Tam-Danielsson window. Unlike the implementation based on PI segment, the algorithm complexity of our implementation can be estimated with several important imaging parameters. This result may be instructive for practical applications to choose scanning parameters and reduce the algorithm complexity. The proposed implementation is validated with satisfactory numerical experiments...|$|E
40|$|The Katsevich image {{reconstruction}} {{algorithm is}} the rst theoret-ically exact cone beam image reconstruction algorithm for a he-lical scanning path in computed tomography (CT). However, it requires much more computation and memory than other CT al-gorithms. Fortunately, {{there are many}} opportunities for coarse-grained parallelism using multiple threads and ne-grained paral-lelism using SIMD units that can be exploited by emerging multi-core processors. In this paper, we implemented and optimized Kat-sevich image reconstruction based on the previously proposed -interval method and cone <b>beam</b> <b>cover</b> method and parallelized them using OpenMP API and SIMD instructions. We also exploited symmetry in the backprojection stage. Our results show that recon-structing a 1024 1024 1024 image using 5120 512 128 pro-jections on a dual-socket quad-core system took 23, 798 seconds on our baseline and 642 seconds on our nal version, a more than 37 times speedup. Furthermore, by parallelizing the code with more threads {{we found that the}} scalability is eventually hinged by the limited front-side bus bandwidth. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Six specimens, {{including}} 4 ceramsite concrete beams(one of beams {{mixed into}} the polypropylene fiber) and 2 normal concrete beams, were tested {{to investigate the}} flexural behavior. The test results show that cracking load of ceramsite concrete beams is slightly smaller than the ordinary concrete beam and cracking load of ceramsite concrete beams has significantly improved after mixing into the polypropylene fibers. The ultimate load of ceramsite concrete beams are no less than ordinary concrete beam,and fibers have not effects on the increase of ultimate load. Load-deflection curves were compared,and {{the results show that}} stiffness of ceramsite concrete beam is less than ordinary concrete beam. Ductility of ceramsite concrete beam is poorer than ordinary concrete beam. Fibers improve the stiffness of ceramsite concrete <b>beam.</b> <b>Cover</b> thickness of concrete beam has little effect on the performance of ceramsite concrete beam. Experimental Investigation A total of 6 flexural beams, including 4 ceramsite concrete beams(one of beams mixed into the polypropylene fiber) and 2 normal concrete beams were tested.

30|$|The mmWave {{channels}} are highly directional and often have few physical paths {{which can be}} parameterized by their angles-of-departure (AoDs). Thus, the beam codebook design for mmWave channels can be simplified to a low-dimensional quantization problem on the AoD domain [8 – 10, 13]. A common solution for beam sweeping is to construct beams that uniformly span the angular range of the channel [8 – 12].
