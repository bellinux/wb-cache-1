He confessed that he got the bills from a fellow in Washington {{who claimed to be}} printing them from some old government plates. That story was, of course, nonsense, since no government plates of such a bill are missing. I followed the trail to Washington, and there met a crook named Sacord. He, so I discovered, got his money from two men, one the owner of this ranch. Where the bad bills were manufactured was a mystery, but, by nosing around, I soon learned that the owner of the ranch never allowed strangers near his place, and that he sometimes had strange pieces of machinery shipped there. Then I put two and two together and {{came to the conclusion that}} the bad bills were printed here. Now, I want to prove it, and not only round up the gang, but also get possession of the bogus printing plates. If the government don't get the plates, somebody may keep on manufacturing the bad bills." ...|$|E

50|$|The first Ivy shot, Mike, was {{the first}} {{successful}} full-scale test of a multi-megaton thermonuclear weapon ("hydrogen bomb") using the Teller-Ulam design. Unlike later thermonuclear weapons, Mike used deuterium as its fusion fuel, maintained as a liquid by an expensive and cumbersome cryogenic system. It was detonated on Elugelab Island yielding 10.4 megatons, almost 500 times the yield of the bomb dropped on Nagasaki. Eight megatons of the yield was from fast fission of the uranium tamper, creating massive amounts of radioactive fallout. The detonation left an underwater crater 6,240 ft (1.9 km) wide and 164 ft (50 m) deep where Elugelab Island had <b>been.</b> <b>Following</b> <b>this</b> successful test, the Mike design was weaponized as the EC-16, but it was quickly abandoned for solid-fueled designs after {{the success of the}} Castle Bravo shot.|$|E

AllMusic reviewer Bryan Carroll described the album as [...] "a unique, epic effort {{from one of}} the most inventive and dynamic rock bands in recent memory". Max Finneran, writing for Spin, commented: [...] "Rounding off the edges of its tried and true punk-rock grind with the melodic and rhythmic tropes of '60s psychedelia, Unwound has perfectly re-imagined a sound that most art-students wouldn't even spit on the first time around". PopMatters critic Matt Cibula stated that Unwound [...] "plays with a tightness and richness that few bands can touch anymore; they have turned into the metal Minutemen". Camilo Arturo Leslie of Pitchfork wrote that he was [...] "convinced that, if you've <b>been</b> <b>following</b> <b>this</b> band's development, the initial bewildered expression on your face will give way to total enchantment".|$|E

He said, [...] "I must say that even though I've <b>been</b> <b>following</b> <b>this</b> storyline since it began, and I knew what was coming, seeing Brendan hit Ste was quite shocking… and the storyline is just beginning. The show has said it's {{going to be a}} dark, long-running story arc so I can only imagine what's ahead. I admit that I find the storyline quite compelling, and I've been drawn into it. While some people have seen this as a romance, it's never played that way to me. Ste and Brendan's scenes do have an element of sexual allure since the actors have chemistry, but there's too much darkness and manipulation on the edges of every scene to make real romance even possible. He also gave credit to the show for its slow build up over a few months.|$|E
50|$|This {{festival is}} celebrated with {{grandeur}} in the Tamil month of Purattasi (during September/October months) for six consecutive Saturdays. People converge {{at the temple}} from across India and overseas. During these days the temple presents a sea of humanity immersed in bhakthi for the Lord. These Saturdays at the temple begin as early as 4.00 AM with an “Abhishekam” or “Thiumanjanam” aradhanai for the Lord. The Maha Deeparadhanai is performed at noon. In the evening the Lord is taken along with his consorts Sridevi and Bhudevi on a majestic Garuda vahanam around the four streets of the temple in a tastefully decorated floral palanquin (Pushpaka Pallaki). The unique feature {{of this is the}} bhaktas fulfilling their vows by carrying an arrow shaped “Meravanai”. For generations people have <b>been</b> <b>following</b> <b>this</b> custom where they remit money in the name of their family members and receive this “Meravanai”.

5000|$|Throughout Europe {{the rates}} of {{religious}} observance has steadily decreased. Poland has also <b>been</b> <b>following</b> <b>this</b> trend; however, it still {{remains one of the}} most devoutly religious countries in Europe. Polish Catholics participate in the sacraments more frequently than their counterparts in most Western European and North American countries. A 2009 study by the Church itself revealed that 80% of Poles go to confession at least once a year, while 60% of the respondents say they do so more often than once a year. By contrast, a 2005 study by Georgetown University's Center for Applied Research on the Apostolate revealed that only 14% of American Catholics take part in the sacrament of penance once a year, with a mere 2% doing so more frequently. Tarnów is the most religious city in Poland, and Łódź is the least. The southern and eastern parts of Poland are more active in their religious practices than those of the West and North. The majority of Poles continue to declare themselves Roman Catholic. This is in stark contrast to the otherwise similar neighboring Czech Republic, which is one of the least religious practicing areas on Earth, with only 19% declaring [...] "they believe there is a God" [...] of any kind.|$|E
