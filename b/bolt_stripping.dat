5000|$|Rimmed {{cartridges}} {{generally do}} not work quite as well in firearms that feed from a box magazine, since the magazine must be carefully loaded so that the rim from each successive case is loaded ahead of the round beneath it, so the round won't snag {{on the rim of}} the cartridge below it as the <b>bolt</b> <b>strips</b> it out of the magazine. However, box magazine firearms firing rimmed cases have seen extensive use; the famous Lee-Enfield rifle used by the UK, and the Soviet Mosin-Nagant rifle, were both used from before World War I until after World War II. Semi-automatic handguns have been chambered in rimmed cartridges as well, for example a LAR Grizzly or Desert Eagle in [...]357 or [...]44 Magnum.|$|R
50|$|All of Mendoza’s design {{efforts in}} small arms {{up to that}} point had been {{intended}} for the Mexican Army. He continued that line of development between 1911 and 1918 with a 7×57mm Mauser caliber, bolt-action, center-fire military rifle of unusual design called the “Fusil Mexico.” In appearance, the rifle seemed to be a bolt-action without a bolt handle, leaving no obvious method of operating it. But in fact, the bolt itself was connected to the fore-end and the action and barrel to the buttstock. The parts of the two-piece, wood stock met just under the receiver. To operate the action, the user rotated the pistol grip outward and backward to unlock the bolt, extract and eject the case. When the pistol grip was pushed forward and rotated downward, the <b>bolt</b> <b>stripped</b> another cartridge from the magazine, chambered it and locked the action to the bolt. The design and operation was ingenious, ergonomic and very straightforward. Mendoza’s rifle was not adopted for military service, but it remains a milestone in bolt-action rifle development.|$|R

50|$|The M82 is a short-recoil {{semi-automatic}} firearm. When {{the gun is}} fired, {{the barrel}} initially recoils for a short distance (about 1 in), while being securely locked by the rotating bolt.

5|$|Beginning the mission's fourth spacewalk at 13:45 UTC, Massimino and Good {{went to work}} {{repairing}} the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). The spectrograph failed in 2004 due to a blown power supply. As with the ACS, the STIS was not designed {{with the intention of}} servicing it while in space, and one of the major challenges was to remove a cover plate held tight with over 100 screws using a specially designed tool called a fastener-capture plate, designed to trap the screws and washers and prevent them from floating into space when removed. While preparing the fastener-capture plate, Massimino encountered issues with a handrail that had to be removed to accommodate the fastener-capture plate. The handrail had a <b>stripped</b> <b>bolt</b> on the bottom, preventing it from being released. After trying multiple options without success, managers on the ground advised Massimino to use brute force to remove the handrail, so he could proceed with the removal of the cover plate. The procedure was tested at Goddard Space Flight Center prior to approving it, showing that the <b>stripped</b> <b>bolt</b> could be broken off safely using force. Working inside the orbiter, Feustel walked Massimino through the procedure slowly, advising him to tape the handrail with Kapton tape to prevent any parts from breaking off or flying loose, {{to be aware of the}} reaction the force would have, as well as to watch for sharp edges on the handrail after removal.|$|R

50|$|The rimmed 7.62×54mmR {{cartridges}} {{are set in}} a metal ammunition belt, and {{are held}} against the shoulder inside non disintegrating looped links, leaving the rim exposed at the rear. The belt is mounted from the right side into the feedway of the PK machine gun. The PK uses a non-reciprocating charging handle {{on the right side}} of the receiver to charge the gun. Since the PK uses a rimmed rifle cartridge and closed-link belts used for feeding, a two-stage feed mechanism with a preliminary extraction of a cartridge from a belt link was preferred over a direct ammunition feed design often used for rimmed cartridges. The PK machine gun is equipped with a lever-type feed mechanism, mounted on the feed cover and operated by the feed lever, mounted on the right wall of the receiver and wrapping around the bolt carrier with its feed pawl and roller. The PK feed mechanism pulls the rimmed 7.62×54mmR cartridges out from the back of the ammunition belt and drops the cartridges down into the feed way, allowing the <b>bolt</b> to <b>strip</b> and feed the cartridges into the chamber for firing.|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} long term {{exposure}} of full size bolts to corrosive environments is presented. A special test rig {{was used to}} test four bolts under different loading conditions. Four X-grade identical profile bolts, each 21 · 7 mm core diameter (23 · 7 mm full diameter) were subjected to prolonged corrosion testing using acid sulphate water. The pH value of the circulated water varied between 3 · 4 and 4 · 3. The corrosion exposure test period lasted 3 · 5 years. Two bolts were axially loaded to 10 t and 20 t force respectively, the third bolt was subjected to a 360 Nm torsion load and the fourth bolt was left unstressed to act as a reference bolt. After the test period ended, the <b>bolts</b> were <b>stripped</b> of their corroded coatings and weighted for weight loss. The diameter of each bolt was subsequently measured, and the loaded bolt samples were first tested nondestructively for tensile cracks and then tested for tensile failure. No cracks were found on postcorrosion bolts tested non-destructively. The failure strength reduction on all four post-corroded bolts was significant, varying between 21 and 39 %. The onset of corrosion was not confined to the water targeted mid-section length of the bolt, however, the most severe corrosion occurred at the anchored ends of the bolts, possibly attributed to the combination of several types of corrosion which may have been also compounded with increased surface area of the threading at the bolt ends and excessive aeration corrosion due to increase in air movement...|$|R

50|$|Though never {{designed}} {{to cross the}} Pacific under their own power, several flotillas of LCTs did make the journey from Pearl Harbor to forward areas. Success in towing strings of LCTs behind LSDs led to the decision to let Flotilla No. 31, comprising 24 Mk.6s, make an island hopping voyage under their own power. The passage was slow and breakdowns numerous, however the flotilla safely arrived at its destination. Three months later, groups 91 and 92 of this flotilla encountered six days of high seas during a typhoon off Okinawa. Fighting 50 foot swells and hurricane-force winds the craft made only 26 miles in nine hours, and were almost impossible to steer or control. When the typhoon finally abated, all the LCTs had survived and took stock of the damage. Halyards, antennas and masts were blown away, guns ripped from their mounts, and the craft had been so severely overstressed that each had to replace the <b>stripped</b> <b>bolts</b> or welds holding their sections together before they could proceed to their destination.|$|R
40|$|Torsion is {{resisted}} well by locked {{system of}} reinforcement, {{due to the}} blood nature of the torsion induced-shear flow stresses in a beam. Therefore, {{it will be more}} effective to have strengthening schemes, which are wrapped in closed form around the cross section. But strengthening with U wrap (three sides) or strengthening in the web and flange unconnectedly is more useful because of the unreachability of the entire cross section due to addition of flange in uniform beam – slab construction (T section of interior beam). This work aims at studying the strengthening of T beams in torsion by using carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP). The CFRP laminates will be used for strengthening previous to loading. The experimental work includes investigation of twelve reinforced concrete T beams tested under pure torsion. The first beam was the reference beam, without CFRP. The second beam was a simple concrete beam. The remaining ten beams. Variables considered in the test program include; effect of flange strengthening, effect of fiber orientation (90 ° or 45 ° CFRP strips with respect to the longitudinal axis), effect of using additional longitudinal CFRP strips with transverse CFRP <b>strips,</b> effect of <b>bolt</b> anchoring CFRP <b>strips</b> in the web and flange and effect of continuous CFRP strips between web and flange (isolated T section).

40|$|Mechanically Stabilized Earth (MSE) walls {{restrain}} hillslopes to unnatural gradients using reinforced soil. Traditional MSE {{walls are}} constructed of large reinforced concrete panels <b>bolted</b> to steel <b>strips</b> for soil reinforcement. Segmented Retaining Walls (SRWs) are {{a form of}} MSE walls composed of precast concrete modular blocks that incorporate geosynthetic soil reinforcement. In comparison, traditional MSE walls have faster construction times and are typically stronger, but SRWs have increased in popularity because they are much cheaper to build. There are many precast companies that produce different SRW block designs, these blocks have facing areas that range from 1 to 13. 75 sq. ft. and can weigh approximately 90 to 2, 000 lbs. There are advantages to both block types {{that must be addressed}} during design. Typically construction costs are lower for small blocks because they can be placed by hand rather than using equipment. Large blocks require less construction time but are usually more expensive to fabricate. Oldcastle is a precast company that has several modular block designs. The newest model called the Mega Wall block is 5. 5 feet wide, 2. 5 feet tall and weighs approximately 2, 000 lbs. The block is designed to accommodate both welded wire mesh and geosynthetics soil reinforcement. Prior to being released to the market design strengths must be determined through laboratory testing. This report presents the results of the Mega Wall block welded wire mesh connection capacity. Three tests were performed by pulling the welded wire mesh to failure under simulated overburden pressures. Results of the testing show that welds in the wire mesh failed well below the yield strength of the steel. As the wires were pulled, the mesh applied stress concentrations to edges of the concrete grooves. Conical concrete failures were observed in the concrete after each test. After the concrete failed, the mesh was allowed to bend considerably, which began to apply a bending to the welds already experiencing shear stress. This excessive bending deformation caused premature failure in the welds during testing. In order to achieve higher connection capacities, several modifications to the Mega Wall block design were presented to Oldcastle. These suggestions were acknowledged but not implemented. Oldcastle was not interested in testing modifications to the block and testing was terminated. It is assumed that the Mega Wall block design will not be modified and that Oldcastle will not recommend using the welded wire mesh connection...|$|R
