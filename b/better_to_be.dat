Minister of External Affairs Lester Pearson {{played a major}} part in the settlement of that dispute, and was later awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his role. Diefenbaker, as the Tories' foreign policy critic and as the favourite in the leadership race, gained considerable attention for his speeches on Suez. The Tories attacked Pearson for, as they said, being an errand boy for the United States government; he responded that it was <b>better</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> such a lackey than to be an obedient colonial doing Britain's will unquestioningly. While Suez would come to be regarded by many {{as one of the}} finest moments in Canadian foreign policy, at the time it cost the Liberals support outside of Quebec.|$|E

He {{argues that it}} is <b>better</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ruled by a bad tyrant, than by a bad democracy (since here all the people are now responsible for such actions, rather than one individual committing many bad deeds.) This is emphasised within the Republic as Plato describes the event of mutiny on board a ship. Plato suggests the ship's crew to be {{in line with the}} democratic rule of many and the captain, although inhibited through ailments, the tyrant. Plato's description of this event is parallel to that of democracy within the state and the inherent problems that arise.|$|E

25|$|With {{a lot of}} {{luck with}} other results, Yorkshire Phoenix could have {{qualified}} for the quarter-finals with a win in this game against Leicestershire Foxes. However, as Ian Harvey's support batsmen failed to score at more than three an over until Anthony McGrath came in at five with the scoreboard on 84 for 3, their innings was eventually worth just 177 for 5 - Harvey making 77 of those and McGrath 33. In reply, opening batsman Darren Maddy anchored the innings with 72 not out, and Jeremy Snape saw off the required runs as he hit 39 off 23 balls and the Foxes won with nine balls and seven wickets to spare. Leicestershire, who needed a tie or <b>better</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> completely assured of the quarter-final spot, thus went through.|$|E
25|$|In 1812, a schism {{occurred}} between the Seer of Lublin and his prime disciple, the Holy Jew of Przysucha, due to {{both personal and}} doctrinal disagreements. The Seer adopted a populist approach, centered on the Righteous' theurgical functions to draw the masses. He was famous for his lavish, enthusiastic conduct during prayer and worship, and extremely charismatic demeanour. He stressed that as Tzaddiq, his mission was to influence the common folk by absorbing Divine Light and satisfying their material needs, thus converting them to his cause and elating them. The Holy Jew pursued a more introspective course, maintaining that the Rebbes duty was {{to serve as a}} spiritual mentor for a more elitist group, helping them to achieve a senseless state of contemplation, aiming to restore man to his oneness with God which Adam supposedly lost when he ate the fruit of the Lignum Scientiae. The Holy Jew and his successors did neither repudiate miracle working, nor did they eschew dramatic conduct; but they were much more restrained in general. The Przysucha School became dominant in Central Poland, while populist Hasidism resembling the Lublin ethos often prevailed in Galicia. One extreme and renowned philosopher who emerged from the Przysucha School was Menachem Mendel of Kotzk. Adopting an elitist, hard-line attitude, he openly denounced the folkly nature of other Tzaddiqim, and rejected financial support. Gathering a small group of devout scholars who sought to attain spiritual perfection, whom he often berated and mocked, he always stressed the importance of both somberness and totality, stating it was <b>better</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fully wicked than only somewhat good.|$|E

500|$|Orion Pictures did {{not have}} faith in The Terminator {{performing}} well {{at the box office}} and feared a negative critical reception. At an early screening of the film, the actors' agents insisted to the producers that the film should be screened for critics. Orion only held one press screening for the film. The film premiered on October 26, 1984. On its opening week, The Terminator played at 1,005 theaters and grossed $4.0 million making it number one in the box office. The film remained at number one in its second week. It lost its number one spot in the third week to Oh, God! You Devil. Cameron noted that The Terminator was a hit [...] "relative to its market, which is between the summer and the Christmas blockbusters.

500|$|The {{extent of}} Digby's {{knowledge}} of the plot is unknown, but {{in the opinion of}} author Alan Haynes, Digby was shocked by what he heard, and asked what would become of some of their Catholic friends. [...] Catesby replied [...] "Assure your selfe that such of the nobilitie as are worth the saving shalbe preserved and yet knowe not of the matter." [...] None of their friends would be caught in the explosion. [...] He asked if Catesby had spoken of the matter with Garnet, or any other Jesuits; although Catesby was in no doubt that the Jesuits disapproved of any such action, he lied and said that he would not act without their approbation. [...] Catesby then named the other conspirators, and promised Digby that as soon as they reached Gayhurst he would demonstrate that their religion allowed such acts of regicide, thus dissuading the young lord from confessing to Garnet and discovering the Jesuit's opinion of the matter. [...] Catesby told him to rent Coughton Court from the head of the Throckmorton family, so that he would [...] "the <b>better</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to do good to the cause [...] ". [...] From there, he was to organise a hunting party (in reality a group of armed men on horseback) and be ready for some kind of military manoeuvre.

500|$|Levin was {{a bright}} child and, {{encouraged}} by his mother, he worked hard enough to win a scholarship to the independent school Christ's Hospital in the countryside near Horsham, West Sussex. His housemaster was D. S. ("Boom") Macnutt, the school's head of Classics. Macnutt was a strict, even bullying, teacher, and was feared rather than loved by his pupils, but Levin learned Classics well, and retained a lifelong love of Latin tags and quotations in his writing. He battled on many fronts at Christ's Hospital: he was a Jew at a Church of England establishment; he was from a poor family; he was slight of stature; he was utterly indifferent to sport; he adopted a Marxist stance, hanging the Red Flag from a school window to celebrate the Labour victory in 1945. In the local streets, the school's conspicuous uniform, including a cloak and tight stockings, attracted unwanted attention. Levin's biographer Bel Mooney writes of this period, [...] "Jeers put iron in his soul". Among the consolations of Christ's Hospital was its thriving musical life. At concerts by the school orchestra (whose members included Levin's contemporary, Colin Davis), Levin listened seriously to music for the first time. The food at the school was no such consolation; according to Levin it was so appalling {{that there must be}} something <b>better</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> found, and from his late teens he sought out the best restaurants he could afford.|$|E
500|$|Jim Farber from New York Daily News {{wrote that}} [...] "Ring Off" [...] is [...] "very much worth downloading." [...] Robert Christgau named the track a [...] "sisterly, daughterly" [...] song. ABC News' Allan Raible wrote that [...] "Ring Off" [...] was [...] "the counterpoint" [...] to Beyoncé's {{previous}} song [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" [...] (2008): [...] "While that song is about settling down, {{this is an}} ode to 'starting over again.'" [...] On behalf of USA Today, Patrick Ryan labelled the track as a hybrid of [...] "anthemic" [...] sound of [...] "XO" [...] and [...] "Caribbean vibes" [...] of [...] "Standing on the Sun" [...] and [...] "Grown Woman". Lindsay Zoladz, a reviewer from Vulture, said that [...] "Ring Off" [...] "isn’t anything special" [...] musically and likened the song's style to that of Beyoncé's previous songs [...] "Schoolin' Life" [...] (2011) and [...] "XO" [...] (2013). However, Zoladz complimented on the song's lyrics, calling it [...] "{{one of the most}} candidly personal songs Beyoncé’s ever released." [...] Vogue editor Alex Frank praised [...] "Ring Off" [...] for being an [...] "epically good track, but more importantly, one of the most personal, profound songs she has ever released". Daniel D'Addario from Time magazine praised [...] "Ring Off" [...] as a [...] "big step forward" [...] in the singer's music career, noting that it amplified the album's theme with [...] "an examination of the circumstances under which it’s <b>better</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> alone". In 2014, the song was placed at number 537 on the annual Pazz & Jop poll compiled by The Village Voice.|$|E
500|$|Janet Maslin, {{reviewing}} for The New York Times, praised Fincher's {{direction and}} editing of the film. She wrote that Fight Club carried {{a message of}} [...] "contemporary manhood", and that, if not watched closely, the film could be misconstrued as an endorsement of violence and nihilism. Roger Ebert, reviewing for the Chicago Sun-Times, called Fight Club [...] "visceral and hard-edged", but also [...] "a thrill ride masquerading as philosophy", whose promising first act {{is followed by a}} second that panders to macho sensibilities and a third he dismissed as [...] "trickery". Ebert later acknowledged that the film was [...] "beloved by most, not by me". He was later requested to have a shot-by-shot analysis of Fight Club at the Conference on World Affairs; he stated that [...] "eeing it {{over the course of a}} week, I admired its skill even more, and its thought even less." [...] Jay Carr of The Boston Globe opined that the film began with an [...] "invigoratingly nervy and imaginative buzz", but that it eventually became [...] "explosively silly". Newsweeks David Ansen described Fight Club as [...] "an outrageous mixture of brilliant technique, puerile philosophizing, trenchant satire and sensory overload" [...] and thought that the ending was too pretentious. Richard Schickel of Time described the director's mise en scène as dark and damp: [...] "It enforces the contrast between the sterilities of his characters' aboveground life and their underground one. Water, even when it's polluted, is the source of life; blood, even when it's carelessly spilled, is the symbol of life being fully lived. To put his point simply: it's <b>better</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> wet than dry." [...] Schickel applauded the performances of Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, but he criticized the film's [...] "conventionally gimmicky" [...] unfolding and the failure to make Helena Bonham Carter's character interesting.|$|E

500|$|By 20 July 1605, 36barrels of {{gunpowder}} {{had been}} {{stored in the}} undercroft, but the ever-present threat of the plague yet again prorogued the opening of Parliament, this time until 5November 1605. Catesby had borne much of the scheme's financial cost thus far, and {{was running out of}} money. As their plans moved closer to fruition, during a secret meeting at Bath in August at which he, Percy and Thomas Wintour were present, the plotters decided that [...] "the company being yet but few" [...] he was to be allowed to [...] "call in whom he thought best". Catesby soon added Ambrose Rookwood, a staunch Catholic who was both young and wealthy, but who most importantly owned a stable of fine horses at Coldham. For the plan to work Rookwood and his horses needed to be close to the other conspirators, and so Catesby persuaded him to rent Clopton House at Stratford-upon-Avon. Francis Tresham was brought into the plot on 14October. Also descended from William Catesby, Tresham was Robert's cousin, and as young children the two had often visited White Webbs. Although his account of the meeting is weighted with hindsight (when captured he sought to distance himself from the affair), he asked Catesby what support for the Catholics would be forthcoming once the king had been killed. Catesby's answer, [...] "The necessity of the Catholics [...] it must needs be done", in Fraser's opinion demonstrates his unwavering view on the matter, held at least since his first meeting with Thomas Wintour early in 1604. The final conspirator to be brought in was Everard Digby, on 21October, at Harrowden. Catesby confided in Digby during a delayed Feast of Saint Luke. Like Rookwood, Digby was young and wealthy, and possessed a stable of horses. Catesby told him to rent Coughton Court near Alcester, so that he would [...] "the <b>better</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to do good to the cause [...] ".|$|E

Despite marital problems, Alice remained {{a strong supporter of}} her husband, being highly critical when his abilities or talents were not fully recognised. On 20 March 1877, Louis' father Prince Charles died, making Louis heir apparent. On 13 June the same year, Charles' older brother Grand Duke Louis III died, and Louis and Alice became the Grand Duke and Duchess of Hesse. Her continued unpopularity in Darmstadt, however, coupled with her mother not wanting her in England, caused strain, and she and her children spent July and August in Houlgate, Normandy, where Louis often visited them. She was hurt by her reputation in Darmstadt, and she became increasingly bitter towards it; Louis wrote in August 1877 expressing the hope that [...] "bitterness of the salt water will drive away the bitterness that you still feel against Darmstadt. Please my darling, don't speak so harshly of it when I come to join you – it would quite spoil my happiness at seeing you again." [...] Alice took Louis's letter to heart, responding: [...] "I shall certainly say nothing to you about Darmstadt when you come...I have no intention of saying anything unpleasant, least of all to you. You shake off anything unpleasant like a poodle shaking off the water {{when it comes to the}} sea – natures like yours are the happiest in themselves, but they are not made to help, comfort and advise others, nor to share with others the heat of life's noon-day or the cool of the evening, with insight, understanding and sympathy." [...] In response, Louis sent a letter that [...] "made [...] cry", and after this letter, Alice's letters to Louis were more encouraging, assuring him of his ability to make decisions by himself.|$|E
