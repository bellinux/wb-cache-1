5|$|Sir Henry Crichton {{bought the}} castle in 1881, {{along with the}} {{surrounding}} gardens, orchards, pond and a <b>boat</b> <b>house.</b> The architect John Sedding remodelled the castle between approximately 1885 and 1890, creating a Gothic styled house, adding another storey and a new wing. After Crichton's death in 1922 his wife remained in the house until her death in 1936, when the property and the surrounding grounds were sold at auction.|$|E
5|$|The Burnham-on-Sea Area Rescue Boat {{now known}} as BARB Search & Rescue {{was set up in}} 1992 to fund and operate rescue craft in the Bridgwater Bay area.

5|$|The stations' closure also {{forced the}} Tyne Sea Scouts, who had {{operated}} from the North station since 1978, to seek new accommodation. The scouts {{had moved into}} the station when their <b>boat</b> <b>house</b> in Blyth was deemed unsafe and demolished. They had been provided with two site offices, storage in the power station complex, and permission to keep their boats at the North station's jetty, {{at the end of}} which they had a slipway built.|$|E
5|$|In the 1890s John Rollins deconstructed {{several of}} the slave cabins to build a <b>boat</b> <b>house</b> and dock. The archeological {{significance}} of the site is considerable as the majority of slave quarters in the Southern United States were not built with quality materials, and most quarters were destroyed after emancipation. Six graves thought to contain slaves were unearthed in 2011 by archeologists from the University of Florida. The bodies {{ranged in age from}} infants to an elderly woman; three were adults who were probably born in West Africa.|$|E

25|$|The Bideford District Association of the Royal National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck (as it {{was then}} known) {{introduced}} a lifeboat service in February 1825. The boat was kept in the King's Watch House at Appledore. In 1831 the work {{was taken over by}} the Devon Humane Society and they built a new <b>boat</b> <b>house</b> at Watertown, half a mile nearer the sea. This was large enough for two boats and a second one arrived in December that year but in 1848 was transferred to a second <b>boat</b> <b>house</b> at Braunton Burrows {{on the opposite side of}} the estuary. It was easier to launch from here to help ships on that side of the water but crews for lifeboats at Braunton Burrows always came from Appledore. A third station was built at Northam Burrows to the west of Appledore in 1851. This was expanded to house a second boat in 1856 and the old <b>boat</b> <b>house</b> at Watertown eventually lost its boats.|$|E

The boats are stored on racks (horizontal bars, usually metal) on the ground floor. Oars, riggers, and other equipment is stored around the <b>boats.</b> <b>Boat</b> <b>houses</b> are typically associated with rowing clubs and include some social facilities on the upper floor: a cafe, bar, or gym.|$|R
50|$|The sea {{is often}} very rough on Vágseiði, {{so it could}} be {{dangerous}} to go fishing from this place, but they fishermen had great respect for the weather conditions. They used the other harbour on the east coast when the weather didn't allow them to go fishing from Vágseiði. There used to be <b>boat</b> <b>houses</b> on Vágseiði, but a hurricane on 14 January 1989 which caused much damage and caused the sea to go over its level, took away most of these <b>boat</b> <b>houses</b> and they have not been re-built since then. The boats are now in other <b>boat</b> <b>houses</b> around the fjord of Vágur, Vágsfjørður. Sometimes they make excursions in old wooden boats starting from Vágseiði. The boats then get transported by trucks to Vágseiði. In May 2010 people from Vágur and from some of the neighbour villages made an excursion with the old wooden rowing boats which are called Grindabátar, to Sumba in the south and back again.|$|R
25|$|The {{district}} is adjacent to Lakeside Park, which lies {{to the east}} and northeast of the district. Lakeside Park is a public city park ring and green space surrounding Lake Merritt and is often called the Crown Jewel of Oakland's parks. Lakeside park is historically significant as featuring North America's first official wildlife refuge, designated in 1870. The state legislature voted the Lake Merritt Wildlife Refuge into law in 1870, making it the first such refuge on the North American continent. No hunting of any sort was to be allowed and the only fishing was to be by hook and line. Under the name Lake Merritt Wild Duck Refuge, the site became a National Historic Landmark on May 23, 1963. It also features a garden center with several cultivated gardens, and the Municipal <b>Boat</b> <b>House</b> on Lakeside Drive. A large restaurant has opened in the <b>Boat</b> <b>House</b> building, which has undergone extensive renovations, and was re-dedicated by city staff in 2009 in anticipation of its re-opening.|$|E
25|$|Dartmouth {{is a small}} port on {{the west}} side of the natural harbour formed by the River Dart. In the 1860s the Dartmouth and Torbay Railway {{established}} more quays on the opposite bank at Kingswear. The RNLI approved that Dartmouth Lifeboat Station be established at Dartmouth in July 1876 but it was 1878 before a lifeboat arrived. During the summer the lifeboat was kept in a <b>boat</b> <b>house</b> at Sand Quay, but during the winter it was kept afloat in Warfleet Creek where it was quicker to respond to any ships in distress. It would prove difficult for the rowing lifeboat to leave the estuary of the Dart if the wind was blowing from the sea unless a tug was able to help. The station was closed in 1896 and during all that time just one effective service was provided. That was on 20 September 1887 when the crew attended a trawler near Kingswear Castle. The <b>boat</b> <b>house</b> is now used by the Dartmouth Amateur Rowing Club.|$|E
25|$|The two {{stations}} were remote from Appledore where the crews lived. With {{the development of}} boats that could be more easily sailed (rather than just rowed) a new <b>boat</b> <b>house</b> was built at Badstep in 1889 to replace Northam Burrows. During World War I it became difficult to find the horses and men necessary for launching boats at Braunton Burrows so it too was closed temporarily in 1918 but this became permanent the following year. The first motor lifeboat arrived on station in 1922. In 1938 a , the Violet Armstrong, replaced the earlier, smaller, boat {{and had to be}} kept moored afloat as it did not fit in the <b>boat</b> <b>house.</b> Instead a small boarding boat was kept in it and used to ferry the crew out to the lifeboat. The new lifeboat had a shallower draught than was usual for a Watson Class and also had her stern strengthened, both modifications to help crossing the shallow water {{at the mouth of the}} estuary.|$|E
