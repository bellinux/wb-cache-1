40|$|The {{four year}} nursing {{programme}} is {{offered at the}} NEI in the EC province where this study was conducted. As early as 2009 the majority of first and second year nursing students of the NEI were academically unsuccessful in the subject <b>biological</b> <b>science.</b> This prompted the researcher to conduct a qualitative, contextual, exploratory and descriptive study to explore and describe the factors influencing {{the academic performance of}} students in the subject <b>biological</b> <b>science</b> at the NEI. Following an explanation of the Appreciative Inquiry (AI) process as the framework of the study and the purpose of the study, the consecutive sample of second year nursing students who consented to participate completed a written appreciative interview schedule. The findings of the content analysis process revealed factors influencing performance in the subject <b>biological</b> <b>science</b> as <b>biological</b> <b>science</b> content, nurse educator characteristics, study strategies, resources and <b>biological</b> <b>science</b> assessments. The recommendation was for all the stakeholders to play their various active roles towards influencing <b>biological</b> <b>science</b> performance positively.

5|$|A {{suitable}} environment {{had developed}} to question scientific doctrine. The discovery in 1492 of the New World by Christopher Columbus challenged the classical worldview. The works of Ptolemy (in geography) and Galen (in medicine) {{were found to}} not always match everyday observations. As the Protestant Reformation and Counter-Reformation clashed, the Northern Renaissance showed a decisive shift in focus from Aristotelean natural philosophy to chemistry and the <b>biological</b> <b>sciences</b> (botany, anatomy, and medicine). The willingness to question previously held truths and search for new answers resulted {{in a period of}} major scientific advancements.|$|E

5|$|Generally, {{students}} of certain <b>biological</b> <b>sciences,</b> paramedics, prosthetists and orthotists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, nurses, podiatrists, and medical students learn gross anatomy and microscopic anatomy from anatomical models, skeletons, textbooks, diagrams, photographs, lectures and tutorials, and in addition, medical students generally also learn gross anatomy through practical experience of dissection and inspection of cadavers. The study of microscopic anatomy (or histology) can be aided by practical experience examining histological preparations (or slides) under a microscope.|$|E
5|$|He helped {{establish}} the Academy's Science and Industry Forum, which {{was formed in}} the second year of his leadership in order to improve dialogue between researchers and industrialists. It investigated whether a national science policy should be formulated and led to the eventual creation of the Australian Science and Technology Council. He also laid the foundations of the Australian Biological Resources Study. When his presidency ended in 1969, the Academy founded the Burnet Lecture and Medal, which is the Academy's highest award for <b>biological</b> <b>sciences.</b>|$|E

He {{worked closely with the}} <b>Biological</b> <b>Sciences</b> Curriculum Study to develop high school curricula based on evolution as the central unifying principle in biology. He also opposed scientific creationism groups. Stebbins was active in numerous science organizationsincluding the International Union of <b>Biological</b> <b>Sciences,</b> the Western Society of Naturalists, the Botanical Society of America, and the Society for the Study of Evolutionand served as President of the American Society of Naturalists. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1952. Stebbins received numerous awards for his contributions to science: the National Medal of Science, the Gold Medal from the Linnean Society of London, the Addison Emery Verrill Medal from the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History, and the John Frederick Lewis Award from the American Philosophical Society. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1952. He was awarded the 1983 Leidy Award from the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.|$|E

5|$|The {{establishment}} of universally accepted conventions for {{the naming of}} organisms was Linnaeus' main contribution to taxonomy—his work marks {{the starting point of}} consistent use of binomial nomenclature. During the 18th century expansion of natural history knowledge, Linnaeus also developed {{what became known as the}} Linnaean taxonomy; the system of scientific classification now widely used in the <b>biological</b> <b>sciences.</b> A previous zoologist Rumphius (1627–1702) had more or less approximated the Linnaean system and his material contributed to the later development of the binomial scientific classification by Linnaeus.|$|E

5|$|Dung beetles (Scarabidae) {{have been}} {{successfully}} used to reduce the populations of pestilent flies, such as Musca vetustissima and Haematobia exigua which are serious pests of cattle in Australia. The beetles make the dung unavailable to breeding pests by quickly rolling and burying it in the soil, with the added effect of improving soil fertility, tilth, and nutrient cycling. The Australian Dung Beetle Project (1965–1985), introduced species of dung beetle to Australia from South Africa and Europe to reduce populations of Musca vetustissima, following successful trials of this technique in Hawaii. The American Institute of <b>Biological</b> <b>Sciences</b> reports that dung beetles save the United States cattle industry an estimated US$380 million annually through burying above-ground livestock feces.|$|E
5|$|ISMB 1997 {{was held}} in Halkidiki, Greece and marked the {{foundation}} of the International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB). ISCB was formed with a focus on managing all scientific, organizational and financial aspects of the ISMB conference and to provide a forum for scientists to address the emerging role of computers in the <b>biological</b> <b>sciences.</b> ISCB has assisted in organising the ISMB conference series since 1998. The period following the formation of ISCB also marked an expansion in the number of ISMB attendees: ISMB 2000 (held at the University of California, San Diego) was attended by over 1,000 delegates, submitting 141 scientific papers. This meeting was also the last time ISMB would be held at a university, due to size limitations.|$|E
