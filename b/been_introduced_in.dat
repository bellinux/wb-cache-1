5|$|Following {{the death}} of Queen Victoria on 22 January 1901, {{officials}} at the Royal Mint planned for new coins, to bear {{the image of her}} son and successor, Edward VII. New coin designs had <b>been</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>in</b> the 1890s, and Mint officials believed the British people wanted as few changes to the coinage as possible. Thus, it was decided not to alter the reverses of the three bronze coins (the penny, halfpenny and farthing), as a new portrait of the Queen had <b>been</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>in</b> 1895. At that time, the Engraver of the Royal Mint, George William de Saulles, had modified Leonard Charles Wyon's depiction of Britannia on the reverse of the bronze coins—the lighthouse and sailing ship that had flanked her were removed. De Saulles was tasked with creating a depiction of Edward for the King's new coinage. The Mint continued to strike coins depicting Victoria, dated 1901, until the King's coinage was ready in May 1902.|$|E

Finally, we conclude this paper in section “Conclusions”.|$|R
5|$|Beauty Revealed was {{completed}} {{during a period}} of popularity of portrait miniatures, a medium which had <b>been</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>in</b> the United States in the late 18th century. By the time Goodridge completed her self-portrait, miniatures were increasing in complexity and vibrance. The Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History describes Beauty Revealed as a play on the eye miniatures which were then popular as tokens of affection in England and France, but not common in the US. Such miniatures allowed portraits of loved ones to be carried by their suitors without revealing the sitters' identities.|$|E
5|$|By 1474, cannons had <b>been</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>in</b> Mdina. Other {{extensive}} {{preparations for}} an attack {{were made in the}} 1480s, when the fortifications were once again improved under the direction of Sicilian military engineers. At this point, some buildings in Rabat were demolished to clear the fortifications' line of fire. By 1522, the fortifications were being modernized with the construction of embrasures. However, the walls were still regarded as obsolete, since they lacked bastions and could not resist bombardment from modern artillery.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the group's opening news conference in February 2006, the {{proposed}} interstate compact had <b>been</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>in</b> the Illinois legislature.

It passed in the Colorado Senate and in both houses of the California legislature before being vetoed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.|$|E

Chamber of Commerce notes <b>were</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>in</b> 1919 in denominations of 5, 10 and 50 centimes and 1 franc. The {{decline in}} the value of the French franc following World War I caused 500 and 1000 franc banknotes to <b>be</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>in</b> 1927 and 1938, respectively. 10 franc notes <b>were</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>in</b> 1946.|$|R

5|$|Following George Trice's {{death in}} 1933, {{control of the}} {{business}} passed to his son, also called George. A coach hire and excursion business had <b>been</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>in</b> July 1931; this was split out into a new company, Tillingbourne Valley Coaches, which operated independently until 1955. From the early 1930s, until 1964, the service to Peaslake was run jointly with the London Passenger Transport Board; operation of the entire route was taken over in August 1964, but falling passenger numbers meant that the route was cut back in frequency a year later. A new livery of maroon and grey was introduced in 1964.|$|E
5|$|One {{source of}} {{inspiration}} for Tristan und Isolde was the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer, notably his The World as Will and Representation, to which Wagner had <b>been</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>in</b> 1854 by his poet friend Georg Herwegh. Wagner later called this the most important event of his life. His personal circumstances certainly made him an easy convert to what he understood to be Schopenhauer's philosophy, a deeply pessimistic view of the human condition. He remained an adherent of Schopenhauer {{for the rest of}} his life.|$|E

5|$|The {{antelope}} is {{native to}} and found mainly in India, while it is extinct in Bangladesh. Formerly widespread, only small, scattered herds are seen today, largely confined to protected areas. During the 20th century, blackbuck numbers declined sharply due to excessive hunting, deforestation and habitat degradation. The blackbuck has <b>been</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>in</b> Argentina and the United States. In India, hunting of blackbuck is prohibited under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. The blackbuck has significance in Hinduism; Indian and Nepali villagers do not harm the antelope.|$|E

This area encompasses both tropical and semiarid environments. The density of the cane toad is significantly lower within its native distribution than in places where it has <b>been</b> <b>introduced.</b> <b>In</b> South America, the density was recorded to be 20 adults per 100m (109yd) of shoreline, 1 to 2% of the density in Australia.|$|E

5|$|The {{historical}} {{range of}} the impala – spanning across southern and eastern Africa – has remained intact to a great extent, although it has disappeared from a few places, such as Burundi. The range extends from central and southern Kenya and northeastern Uganda in the east to northern KwaZulu-Natal in the south, and westward up to Namibia and southern Angola. The black-faced impala is confined to southwestern Angola and Kaokoland in northwestern Namibia; the status of this subspecies has not been monitored since the 2000s. The common impala has a wider distribution, and has <b>been</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>in</b> protected areas in Gabon and across southern Africa.|$|E
5|$|The idea of Ranko brought {{together}} two popular fictional {{creatures of the}} 1930s; the giant ape King Kong, who had <b>been</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>in</b> the film King Kong (1933), and the Loch Ness Monster, a cryptid who was to have lived in Loch Ness. Gaston Leroux's character of Balaoo the gorilla, who had appeared in a 1911 book and a 1913 film, might also have been an influence on Ranko. The plot and themes of the story were also influenced by Alfred Hitchcock's 1935 film The 39 Steps, itself an adaptation of John Buchan's 1915 adventure novel.|$|E
