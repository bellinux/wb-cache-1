5|$|After the council, Cuthbert {{continued}} {{to correspond with}} Boniface up until Boniface's martyrdom in 754, and then sent condolences to Boniface's successor. Cuthbert held a second synod in 758, but nothing is known of any enactments it made. He also built the church of St. John the Baptist in Canterbury, which was destroyed by fire in 1067. He was buried in his new church. The new church was located {{on the west side}} of the cathedral, and was used as a baptistery. The church also became a burial site for many of the archbishops, and later was used for trials by ordeal. There is no explicit contemporary reference that states that these uses were intended by Cuthbert, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> church was dedicated to St. John the Baptist argues strongly that Cuthbert at least intended the new building as a baptistery.|$|E
5|$|It {{had long}} been {{established}} Marcher custom to solve conflicts through private warfare. Hereford's problem, however, was his relative weakness in the Marches, {{and now he was}} facing open conflict with two different enemies. He therefore decided to take the issue to the king instead, in a break with tradition. King Edward again ordered Gloucester to stop, but the earl ignored the order and initiated raids on Hereford's lands. Hostilities continued and Hereford responded, until both earls were arrested and brought before the king. The real offense was not the private warfare in itself, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> earls had not respected the king's injunction to cease. In the parliament of January 1292, Gloucester was fined 10,000 marks and Hereford 1,000. Gloucester's liberty of Glamorgan was declared forfeit, and confiscated by the crown, as was Hereford's of Brecon.|$|E
5|$|The fourth {{series in}} 2010 was {{executive}} produced by Russell T Davies and Nikki Wilson, and the producers were Brian Minchin and frequent writer Phil Ford. During this series, Cyril Nri was introduced {{as a new}} recurring character called The Shopkeeper. The production team remained {{in place for the}} completed episodes of Series 5, which were shot concurrently with Series 4. The show's abbreviated fifth and final series introduced a new main character named Sky, played by Sinead Michael. The episode that introduced Sky also featured a return appearance by the Shopkeeper, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> second half of the series was never produced left his story arc, as well as other ongoing plot points, unresolved. A special edition of Doctor Who Magazine, The Sarah Jane Companion Volume 3, published in August 2012, detailed the plotlines of the three unfilmed stories.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{frequent}} mentioning of the Diolkos {{in connection with}} military operations, modern scholarship assumes that the prime purpose of the trackway {{must have been the}} transport of cargo, considering that warships cannot have needed transporting very often, and ancient historiography was always more interested in war than commerce. Comments by Pliny the Elder and Strabo, which described the Diolkos as being in regular service during times of peace, also imply a commercial use of the trackway. Coinciding with the rise of monumental architecture in Greece, the construction of the Diolkos may have initially served particularly for transporting heavy goods like marble, monoliths and timber to points west and east. It is not known what tolls Corinth could extract from the Diolkos on its territory, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> trackway was used and maintained long after its construction indicates that it remained for merchant ships an attractive alternative to the trip around Cape Malea for much of antiquity.|$|E
25|$|Although a few {{temporary}} passes {{were issued}} {{to work and}} to 16 students of St. Francis Xavier College outside the ghetto, these were granted arbitrarily and were severely curtailed after the first year. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Chinese did not leave the Hongkou ghetto meant the Jews were not isolated. Nevertheless, economic conditions worsened; psychological adjustment to ghettoization was difficult; the winter of 1943 was severe and hunger was widespread.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to note that whereas Roman vaults, like that of the Pantheon, and Byzantine vaults, like that at Hagia Sophia, were not protected from above (i.e. the vault from the inside was the same that one saw from the outside), the European architects of the Middle Ages, protected their vaults with wooden roofs. In other words, one will not see a Gothic vault from the outside. The reasons for this development are hypothetical, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> roofed basilica form preceded the era when vaults begin to be made is certainly to be taken into consideration. In other words, the traditional image of a roof took precedence over the vault.|$|E

25|$|Manufacturers {{point out}} {{that many of the}} {{products}} to be impacted are already making their way through the supply chain. As a result, much inventory that was legal prior to the signing of the law and was manufactured shortly thereafter will probably be on shelves as the deadlines approach. The Natural Resources Defense Council and Public Citizen apparently agree that these products are already in distribution, but believe that manufacturers should still be held liable. The problem is not the lead or phthalate content, as they imply, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> products must be tested to make sure they comply. There is also confusion of what products need a GCC and which do not. They have not been tested because the items generally do not contain hazardous materials; CPSC has been slow to define some of the accreditation or testing criteria; some of the low volume, low value items are not economical to test; and lot tracking methods would not allow some of the items to be tracked.|$|E
25|$|Guns and the cavalry. The {{introduction}} of guns saw {{a rise in}} the quantities and role of infantry within the savannah empires. Firepower gave the gun-armed footman growing influence, not only as far as bullets delivered, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> noise and smoke of muskets could frighten horses in the enemy camp, creating a tactical advantage; this happened when Asante gunmen confronted the horsemen of Gonja in the 17th century. The success of the gun-armed Moroccans in the 16th century also illustrates the growing impact of firearms. As gun quality and volume increased, the cavalry became more at risk, and eventually even some horsemen began to acquire firearms. The gunpowder era thus saw mixed forces in action throughout the savannah empires. If infantry were operating with mounted formations, the musketeers were generally used to open a battle, and soften up opposing defences for thundering cavalry charges. Traditional weapons still remained strong in many areas however, both in terms of archers and bowmen, and cavalry. Early musket-man formations relied on relatively slow-loading, inaccurate weapons, and could be defeated by fast-moving horsemen. This happened in 1767 when Tuareg cavalry defeated an army of Timbuktu that deployed Moroccan musketeers. The old weapons thus remained relevant for some time after the coming of guns, on into the 19th century.|$|E
500|$|Starting {{with an open}} bowl-like {{design and}} one covered terrace, Stamford Bridge had an {{original}} capacity of around 100,000.

It eventually became known as the [...] "Shed End", the home of Chelsea's most loyal and vocal supporters, particularly during the 1960s, 70s and 80s. The exact origins of the name are unclear, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> roof looked like a corrugated iron shed roof played a part.|$|E

2500|$|As Protestant Christians {{who accept}} the Bible as their only rule {{of faith and}} practice, Seventh-day Adventists {{on both sides of}} the issue employ the same Bible texts and {{arguments}} used by other Protestants (e.g. 1 Tim. 2:12 and Gal. 3:28), <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> most prominent and authoritative co-founder of the church—Ellen White—was a woman, also affects the discussion. Proponents of ordaining women point out that Adventists believe that Ellen White was chosen by God as a leader, preacher and teacher; that she remains the highest authority, outside the Bible, in the Seventh-day Adventist Church today; that she was regularly issued ordination credentials, which she carried without objection; and that she supported the ordination of women to at least some ministry roles. Opponents argue that because she was a prophet her example does not count, and that although she said she was ordained by God, she was never ordained in the ordinary way, by church leaders.|$|E
2500|$|On 10 July, the Soviets protested {{what they}} {{described}} as overflights by a USAF [...] "twin-engine medium bomber", apparently believing {{that it was}} a Canberra. The U.S. replied on 19 July that no American [...] "military planes" [...] had overflown the Soviet Union, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Soviets' report showed that they could track the U-2s for extended periods caused Eisenhower to immediately halt overflights over eastern Europe. Beyond the Soviet protests, the president was concerned about American public reaction to news that the U.S. had violated international law. To avoid project cancellation, the CIA began Project Rainbow to make the U-2 less detectable. The eight overflights over communist territory, however, had already shown that the bomber gap did not exist; the U-2s had not found any Myasishchev M-4 Bison bombers at the nine bases they had visited. Because the Eisenhower administration could not disclose the source of its intelligence, however, Congressional and public debate over the bomber gap continued.|$|E
2500|$|The {{status of}} the name Scansoriopteryx has been controversial. The type {{specimen}} was described {{only a few months}} after a very similar specimen, Epidendrosaurus ninchengensis, was described online, though the name Epidendrosaurus was not published in print until after Scansoriopteryx. These two specimens are so similar that they may be the same genus, in which case Article 21 of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) would give priority to Scansoriopteryx. The journal in which Scansoriopteryx appeared has a very small circulation, but was distributed on roughly 2002-09-02, before the print appearance of Epidendrosaurus, but well after the later's appearance on the Internet, enough time for the name Epidendrosaurus to have come into wide use by experts. This situation was used as an example in a proposed amendment to the ICZN by Jerry Harris that would consider electronic articles with Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) that are subsequently available in print to qualify as [...] "publication" [...] for naming purposes. Harris noted that while the name Epidendrosarus appeared first, Scansoriopteryx was the first to be published in print and is therefore the valid name, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ICZN does not recognize online names as valid has led to confusion over which has priority. In scientific literature, the genus Scansoriopteryx has been treated as a senior synonym of Epidendrosaurus by some scientists, such as Thomas R. Holtz, Jr. and Alan Feduccia, and as a junior synonym by other such as Kevin Padian.|$|E
