5|$|An ongoing {{question}} is whether RAD should {{be thought of as}} a disorder of the child's personality or a distortion of the relationship between the child and a specific other person. It has been noted that as attachment disorders are by their very nature relational disorders, they do not fit comfortably into noslogies that characterize the disorder as centered on the person. Work by C.H. Zeanah indicates that atypical attachment-related behaviors may occur with one caregiver but not with another. This is similar to the situation reported for attachment styles, in which a particular parent's frightened expression has been considered as possibly responsible for disorganized/disoriented reunion <b>behavior</b> <b>during</b> the Strange Situation Procedure.|$|E

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 52 - 58). viii, 58 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmThis {{study investigated}} {{the role of the}} dorsal and ventral hippocampus in both unconditioned and conditioned defensive behaviors by examining the effects of pretraining ibotenic acid lesions to the dorsal or ventral hippocampus in Long Evans hooded male rats exposed to three types of threat stimuli, cat odor, a live cat and footshock. Conditioned defensive behaviors were assessed in the same context 24 hours after the threat exposure. During unconditioned test trials, DR lesions did not significantly alter <b>behaviors</b> <b>during</b> exposure to cat odor, a live cat, or footshock. Additionally, DR lesions failed to modify conditioned <b>behaviors</b> <b>during</b> all three tests of defense. In contrast, VR lesions significantly reduced both unconditioned and conditioned defensive <b>behaviors</b> <b>during</b> cat odor and footshock, while only reducing defensive <b>behaviors</b> <b>during</b> the unconditioned cat exposure trail. These results suggest a role for the VR in modulating anxiety-like behaviors in certain animal models of defense...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Ictal <b>behaviors</b> <b>during</b> {{psychogenic}} non-epileptic seizures (NES) {{vary considerably}} among individuals, and can closely resemble common semiologies of epileptic seizures (ES). We tested {{the hypothesis that}} <b>behaviors</b> <b>during</b> NES in patients who have temporal spikes would more closely resemble <b>behaviors</b> <b>during</b> ES in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy than would <b>behaviors</b> <b>during</b> NES in patients {{who do not have}} EEG spikes. Methods: We identified 20 patients who had interictal temporal EEG spikes and EEG-video recorded NES (Study Group), 133 patients with temporal EEG spikes and recorded ES, without NES (Epileptic Group), and 24 patients with recorded NES and no epileptiform EEG abnormalities, without ES (Nonepileptic Group). Results: The hypothesis was supported with regard to ictal motor behaviors. Motionless staring or complex automatisms occurred mainly during NES in the Study Group and during ES in the Epileptic Group. In contrast, convulsive movements or flaccid falls were most common during NES in the Nonepileptic Group. Duration of unresponsiveness was longer, and there were fewer postictal states in NES both in the Study and Non-epileptic Groups. Unresponsiveness was briefer and postictal states were more consistent in ES in the Epileptic Group, however. Conclusions: Stereotyped motor activities during NES presumably represent learned behaviors. Processes underlying acquisition of ictal behaviors of NES probably differ in patients with interictal epileptiform EEG abnormalities compared to those without. Prior experiences and temporal lobe dysfunctions that are associated with epilepsy, and psychological characteristics that are unrelated to interictal epileptic dysfunctions, may determine ictal <b>behaviors</b> <b>during</b> NES...|$|R

5|$|The global {{financial}} crisis precipitated in 2007 and 2008 shared {{some of the}} key features exhibited by the wave of international financial crises in the 1990s, including accelerated capital influxes, weak regulatory frameworks, relaxed monetary policies, herd <b>behavior</b> <b>during</b> investment bubbles, collapsing asset prices, and massive deleveraging. The systemic problems originated in the United States and other advanced nations. Similarly to the 1997 Asian crisis, the global crisis entailed broad lending by banks undertaking unproductive real estate investments as well as poor standards of corporate governance within financial intermediaries. Particularly in the United States, the crisis was characterized by growing securitization of non-performing assets, large fiscal deficits, and excessive financing in the housing sector. While the real estate bubble in the U.S. triggered the financial crisis, the bubble was financed by foreign capital flowing from many different countries. As its contagious effects began infecting other nations, the crisis became a precursor for the global economic downturn now referred to as the Great Recession. In the wake of the crisis, total volume of world trade in goods and services fell 10% from 2008 to 2009 and did not recover until 2011, with an increased concentration in emerging market countries. The {{global financial}} crisis demonstrated the negative effects of worldwide financial integration, sparking discourse on how and whether some countries should decouple themselves from the system altogether.|$|E

40|$|AIMS: To (1) {{describe}} the child- and context-focused behaviors {{of physical and}} occupational therapists, and (2) compare the behaviors of therapists in a standard therapy session with those of therapists trained to deliver child- and context-focused services. METHOD: Videos of 49 therapy sessions provided by 36 therapists were analyzed using the intervention domains of the Paediatric Rehabilitation Observational measure of Fidelity (PROF) to examine the therapeutic behaviors of physical and occupational therapists with young children with cerebral palsy (CP) (24 to 48 months) in a Dutch rehabilitation setting. The PROF ratings of 18 standard therapy sessions were compared with the ratings of 16 child- and 15 context-focused therapy sessions. RESULTS: Therapists who provided standard therapy demonstrated a mix of child- and context-focused behaviors.
