5|$|In {{the first}} six days after Baker, when {{radiation}} levels were highest, 4,900 men boarded target ships. Sailors tried to scrub off the radioactivity with brushes, water, soap, and lye. Nothing worked, short of sandblasting to <b>bare</b> <b>metal.</b>|$|E
5|$|Due {{to a lack}} of maintenance, the {{protective}} lacquer covering Knife Edge Two Piece degraded and exposed the surface of the sculpture to the elements. This resulted in oxidation of the bronze metal. Subsequent deterioration of the patination and years of graffiti scratched into the surface resulted in further corrosion. The conservation aimed to remove the remaining protective lacquer and surface dirt, and to remove the result of corrosion and oxidation from the sculpture, and take the surface back to the <b>bare</b> <b>metal.</b> Following the removal of graffiti the sculpture was repatinated to return it to its original colour. It was finally waxed with a weatherproof surface to protect it from future damage. The conservation work was undertaken by Rupert Harris Conservation, working in consultation with the Henry Moore Foundation. The cost of the conservation was £16,190, with £11,000 contributed by the Henry Moore Foundation.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge was}} closed to motor {{vehicles}} on 15 February 2010 for refurbishment and strengthening. It was originally expected to remain closed for approximately 18 months, but after {{the condition of the}} bridge was found to be worse than expected, it was closed for 22 months. All of the timber in the decking as well as the footway that had rotted away were replaced, with additional timber added for strengthening. Surfaces at the carriageway and pavement decking were replaced. New steel structures were added to strengthen the bridge. All the lightbulbs were changed to more energy-efficient ones. The tollbooths were refurbished. All twelve layers of paint were stripped down until the <b>bare</b> <b>metal</b> was exposed, which was repaired and treated before three new coats of paint were added. The whole project cost £7.2 million of which the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea provided 25% of the cost and the other 75% was provided by Transport for London.|$|E

40|$|In this work, the surface-enhanced Raman {{scattering}} (SERS) {{spectra of}} pyridine (py) on thin films of Co and Ni electrodeposited on an Ag electrode activated by oxidation-reduction cycles (ORC) are presented. The SERS spectra from the thin films {{were compared to}} those of py on activated <b>bare</b> transition <b>metal</b> electrodes. It was verified that the SERS spectra of py on 3 monolayers (ML) -thick films of Ni and Co presented only bands assignable to the py adsorbed on transition metal surfaces. It was also observed that even for 50 ML-thick transition metal films, the py SERS intensity was ca. 40 % of the intensity from the 3 ML-thick films. The relative intensities of the SERS bands depended on {{the thickness of the}} films, and for films thicker than 7 ML for Co and 9 ML for Ni they were very {{similar to those of the}} <b>bare</b> transition <b>metal</b> electrodes. The transition metal thin films over Ag activated electrodes presented SERS intensities 3 orders of magnitude higher than the ones from <b>bare</b> transition <b>metal</b> electrodes.

These results indicate that, when the G/E is completely coated with paint or a paint/polyurethane resin combination, satisfactory protection of the D 6 AC steel is achieved with either a coat of zinc-rich primer or a primer/topcoat combination. Likewise, satisfactory corrosion protection of the aluminum is achieved by coating it with an epoxy coating system...|$|R
5000|$|In 1886 Berliner began {{experimenting with}} methods of sound recording. He was granted his first patent {{for what he}} called the [...] "Gramophone" [...] in 1887. The patent {{described}} recording sound using horizontal modulation of a stylus as it traced a line on a rotating cylindrical surface coated with an unresisting opaque material such as lampblack, subsequently fixed with varnish and used to photoengrave a corresponding groove into the surface of a metal playback cylinder. In practice, Berliner opted for the disc format, which made the photoengraving step much less difficult and offered the prospect of making multiple copies of the result by some simpler process such as electrotyping, molding or stamping. In 1888 Berliner was using a more direct recording method, in which the stylus traced a line through a very thin coating of wax on a zinc disc, which was then etched in acid to convert the line of <b>bared</b> <b>metal</b> into a playable groove.|$|R

Similarly, pure water absorbs very little visible light, but water is nonetheless a strong infrared absorber and has a correspondingly high emissivity.|$|R
40|$|Diffraction of {{a surface}} wave on a {{rectangular}} wedge with impedance faces is studied using the Sommerfeld-Malyuzhinets technique. An analog of Landau's bypass {{rule in the}} theory of plasma waves is introduced for selection of a correct branch of the Sommerfeld integral, and the exact solution is given in terms of imaginary error function. The formula derived is valid both in the near-field and far-wave zones. It is shown that a diffracted surface wave is completely scattered into freely propagating electromagnetic waves and neither reflected nor transmitted surface waves are generated in case of <b>bare</b> <b>metals</b> which have positive real part of surface impedance. The scattered waves propagate predominantly at a grazing angle along the direction of propagation of the incident surface wave and mainly in the upper hemisphere regarding the wedge face. The profile of radiated intensity is nonmonotonic and does not resemble the surface wave profile which exponentially evanesces with the distance from the wedge face. Comparison with experiments carried out in the terahertz spectral range at Novosibirsk free electron laser has shown a good agreement of the theory and the experiments.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} study of the effect of humidity on the static and dynamic strength of adhesive composite lap joints and an electrochemical study of coatings on metals and galvanic couples. ^ The effect of humidity on the static and impact strength of composite lap joints was studied by bonding steel to carbon fiber using a commercially available two-part epoxy. The quasi-static strength of the joints was measured using an INSTRON machine and the dynamic strength was determined with a Split-Hopkinson Pressure Bar Apparatus. ^ Baseline failure data was performed on unexposed specimens. The remaining joints were placed in a saltwater humidity chamber {{to determine the effects of}} simulated seawater on the adhesive joint strength over time. Joints were removed from the chamber at 250, 500, 1000, and 2000 -hour intervals and tested to failure to determine the joint strength. The static and dynamic strength was measured as a function of exposure to determine the effect of humidity. It was determined that initial bond quality, as well as exposure time, is a major factor in joint strength. ^ Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) was used to investigate single and galvanic couples of mild steel, stainless steel, and aluminum. In addition to <b>bare</b> <b>metals,</b> testing was performed on metals coated with polyurethane, electroplated aluminum, or an aluminum/titanium ceramic. The goals were to develop analytic models to predict the effectiveness of future coatings on metals and to investigate whether EIS could measure the effect of coupling a more anodic metal to a more cathodic metal in seawater. ^ This study determined EIS cannot discern between two coupled materials and measures the open circuit potential and corrosion current of the more anodic metal. Modeling the coatings was made impossible due to high rates of coating failure and software limitations. Although models from the EIS data were not developed, the open circuit potential and final impedance values of the coated systems may yield a valuable prediction tool. ...|$|R

25|$|The RAE first {{tested it}} in an “as delivered” configuration. The wing airfoil was {{designed}} to support laminar flow to 60% of chord. In the “as delivered” configuration, a profile drag was measured which was representative of the wing section with boundary layer transition {{at the leading edge}} (0% laminar flow). Reducing the surface roughness reduced the drag at low lift coefficients to a level representative of laminar flow to 35% of chord. Measurements were made of the surface waviness. This showed peak wave amplitudes, above the mean, of approximately 0.011 inches over a two-inch span. The standard waviness criteria shows the critical wave height to be 0.0053 inches for this application. To reduce the waviness, RAE personnel stripped the wing to <b>bare</b> <b>metal.</b> The wing was then sprayed with two coats of primer paint and a coat of paint type filler. After the paint was dry, it was sanded in a chordwise direction, using sanding blocks, whose curvature matched the local surface curvature. This was repeated several times. Surface waviness was then measured and found to be no more than 0.005 inches. In flight, this configuration was found to have a profile drag representative of boundary layer transition at 60% of chord. This gave researchers an idea of what level of wing surface quality was required to actually get the benefits of laminar flow airfoils.|$|E

40|$|Aluminum alloy (3003) {{has been}} {{anodized}} using sulfuric acid solution. To study the {{characteristic of the}} anodic film of aluminum alloy (3003); four variables are examined in term of anodic film thickness, these are current density ranging between 1. 5 - 3. 5 A/dm 2, electrolyte concentration ranging between 10 - 20 Vol. %, electrolyte temperature between 10 - 30 o C and anodizing time between 10 - 50 min. The study shows that the time of anodizing and current density has positive dependence of great significance on the anodic film thickness of aluminum alloy (3003) while the other two studied variables (i. e. concentration and temperature of electrolyte) show little dependence on the film thickness. When conditional Hookes and Jeeves optimization method is used, optimum conditions of aluminum alloy (3003) in terms of maximum thickness are found equal to: Current density (A /dm 2) 3. 5 Acid concentration (Vol. %) 10 Electrolyte temperature (o C) 19 Time of anodizing (min.) 50 Aluminum alloy (3003) specimens at optimum conditions are anodized and comparison studies between anodized and un-anodized specimens are carried out in terms of: 1) the roughness and hardness of anodic film. 2) the corrosion rates in 3. 5 % NaCl solution by: a) immersion test. b) polarization curves. 3) examining microstructure before and after anodizing of both types and their corrosion specimens by optical microscope and X-ray diffraction. In general, {{it is found that}} the surface roughness and hardness values for the anodized specimens are greater than that of un-anodized specimens because of the very much thicker oxide coating compare with the natural oxide (atmospheric oxide) whose improved physical and chemical properties. Also, the corrosion rates for anodized specimens are lower than that for un-anodized ones. The polarization behavior for anodizing alloy shows that the breakdown potentials are shifted to more noble direction than <b>bare</b> <b>metals</b> due to anodizing.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a high-performance apertureless near-field probe {{made of a}} tapered metal tip {{with a set of}} periodic shallow grooves near the apex. The spontaneous emission from a single emitter near the tip is investigated systematically for the side-illumination tip enhanced spectroscopy (TES). In contrast with the <b>bare</b> tapered <b>metal</b> tip in conventional side-illumination TES, the corrugated probe not only enhances strongly local excitation field but also concentrates the emission directivity, which leads to high collection efficiency and signal-to-noise ratio. In particular, we propose an asymmetric TES tip based on two coupling nanorods with different length at the apex to realize unidirectional enhanced emission rate from a single emitter. Interestingly, we find that the radiation pattern is sensitive to the emission wavelength and the emitter positions respective to the apex, which can result in an increase of signal-to-noise ratio by suppressing undesired signal. The proposed asymmetrical corrugated probe opens up a broad range of practical applications, e. g. increasing the detection efficiency of tip enhanced spectroscopy at the single-molecule level...|$|R

40|$|Aims: The {{present study}} was aimed to {{measurement}} of sound absorption coefficient of mineral wool and determination of their absorption ability. Materials and Methods: Mineral wool was used to find noise absorption coefficient. Random and normal sound absorption coefficient values were predicted. Then, the measures of transmission loss calculated as an overall value, for applied absorbent material and <b>bare</b> sheet <b>metal.</b> Results: The measured values of noise with one octave band frequency demonstrated an attenuation of 5. 5 - 7 dB for these frequencies. The absorption coefficients of materials showed that mineral wool had more normal sound coefficients than its random sound absorption coefficient values.

It seems that the amount or thickness of absorbent lining was a main reason of noise reduction in low band frequencies.
