40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} {{findings}} of laboratory based investigations into the settlement behaviour of granular columns with respect to time, in particular the progression through initial, consolidation and creep settlements. The {{aim of the research}} is to investigate and segregate the three settlement stages of a raft and an isolated foundation, supported by soft clay improved by granular columns. For convenience, the programme of work is divided into two parts, in which : Part 1 examines the long term settlement performance of a smooth, rigid raft underlain by soft clay without granular columns, and with granular columns, under single and multiple configurations, at an area replacement ratio, As of 15 %; and Part 2 examines the long term settlement performance of an isolated footing underlain by soft clay without granular column and with a single granular column at an As of 33 %. The results obtained from Part 1 (raft foundation loading) of the experimental investigations challenge the effectiveness of granular columns to control foundation settlement over a prolonged period, when installed in soft clay under a range of loadings. The tests were carried out in instrumented, one dimensional testing chambers on samples (254 mm ɸ, 100 mm high) of kaolin and sleech. The results obtained from Part 2 (isolated foundation loading) of the experimental investigations suggest that granular columns are a viable option in reducing settlements (initial, consolidation and creep) in weak deposit under low <b>bearing</b> <b>pressures,</b> at which the soil is overconsolidated, and not particularly effective under moderate to high <b>bearing</b> <b>pressures,</b> at which the soil is normally consolidated.

50|$|A {{column that}} carries the load down to a {{foundation}} must have means to transfer the load without overstressing the foundation material. Reinforced concrete and masonry columns are generally built directly on top of concrete foundations. When seated on a concrete foundation, a steel column must have a base plate to spread the load over a larger area, and thereby reduce the <b>bearing</b> <b>pressure.</b> The base plate is a thick, rectangular steel plate usually welded to the bottom end of the column.|$|E

The objectives of this study are to estimate the hydrodynamic loads on the bearings and to recommend feasible design modifications for BSMT to eliminate the parasitic loads. Three-dimensional computational analyses of inlet and exit cavities in their baseline configuration were performed with REFLEQS which is an advanced finite-volume Navier-Stokes code. Computations were performed with and without a 1 / 4 inch diameter temperature probe included in each of the cavities.
