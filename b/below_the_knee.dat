5|$|Mills came {{to public}} {{attention}} {{when she was}} a model in 1993 and was involved a collision with a police motorcycle in London. The accident resulted in the amputation of her left leg <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee,</b> but she continued to model by using a prosthetic limb and sold her story to a tabloid newspaper.|$|E
5|$|On the ground, the Australian magpie {{moves around}} by walking, {{and is the}} only member of the Artamidae to do so; woodswallows, butcherbirds and currawongs all tend to hop with legs parallel. The magpie has a short femur (thigh bone), and long lower leg <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee,</b> suited to walking rather than running, {{although}} birds can run in short bursts when hunting prey.|$|E
5|$|The blades are transtibial prostheses, {{meaning they}} replace {{legs and feet}} that are amputated <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> (BK). They were {{developed}} by medical engineer Van Phillips who incorporated Flex-Foot, Inc., in 1984, and in 2000 sold the company to Össur which now (in 2012) manufactures the blades. They are designed to store kinetic energy like a spring, allowing the wearer to jump and run effectively.|$|E
50|$|Churidaar is a {{variation}} on the salwar, loose above <b>the</b> <b>knees</b> and tightly fitted to <b>the</b> calf <b>below.</b> While <b>the</b> salwar is baggy and caught in at the ankle, <b>the</b> churidar fits <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>knees</b> with horizontal gathers near the ankles. The churidaar can be worn with any upper garment such as a long kurta, which goes <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>knees,</b> or as part of the anarkali suit.|$|R

5|$|In the mid-1990s, Bradbury accidentally hit his leg while {{chopping}} firewood. Gangrene set in, and {{his right}} leg was amputated <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee.</b> It spread to his left leg, and part of his left foot was amputated, leaving him in a wheelchair. The disease eventually proved fatal, and he died on 20 August 1997. He was {{survived by his wife}} Lois, who died in January 1998, and his three sons. A funeral service was held in Los Alamos, and he was buried at Guaje Pines Cemetery in Los Alamos.|$|E
5|$|On 8 February 1945, Rudel {{was badly}} {{wounded in the}} right foot, and crash landed inside German lines. Rudel's leg was amputated <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee.</b> He {{returned}} to flying on 25 March 1945. He claimed 26 more tanks destroyed {{by the end of}} the war. On 19 April 1945, the day before Hitler's final birthday, Rudel met with Hitler in the Führerbunker at the Reich Chancellery in Berlin. On 8 May 1945, Rudel fled westward from an airfield near Prague, landing in US controlled territory, and surrendered.|$|E
5|$|General Sir Ian Hamilton {{presided over}} the memorial's {{unveiling}} on Sunday, 9 October 1927, at a ceremony attended by Lutyens. The unveiling itself was performed by a local veteran, Bertie Withers. Withers was selected at random after candidates were solicited from the city's ex-servicemen who met four criteria: that they were natives of Norwich; had enlisted prior {{to the implementation of}} conscription in 1916; had served overseas; and had been permanently disabled {{as a result of their}} service. Withers enlisted on 1 September 1914 and fought in the Gallipoli Campaign in 1915; after a bout of illness he rejoined his unit to fight in the First Battle of Gaza, where his battalion suffered heavy casualties. Withers himself was injured and, after his evacuation, his left leg was amputated <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee.</b> Upon his return to England he spent a year in the Norwich and Norfolk Hospital.|$|E

5|$|Low {{back pain}} may be {{classified}} {{based on the}} signs and symptoms. Diffuse pain that does not change in response to particular movements, and is localized to the lower back without radiating beyond the buttocks, is classified as nonspecific, the most common classification. Pain that radiates down the leg <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee,</b> is located on one side (in the case of disc herniation), or is on both sides (in spinal stenosis), and changes in severity in response to certain positions or maneuvers is radicular, making up 7% of cases. Pain that is accompanied by red flags such as trauma, fever, a history of cancer or significant muscle weakness may indicate a more serious underlying problem and is classified as needing urgent or specialized attention.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{member of}} the family Equidae was the Hyracotherium, which lived between 45 and 55million years ago, during the Eocene period. It had 4toes on each front foot, and 3toes on each back foot. The extra toe on the front feet soon disappeared with the Mesohippus, which lived 32 to 37million years ago. Over time, the extra side toes shrank in size until they vanished. All that remains of them in modern horses is a set of small vestigial bones on the leg <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee,</b> known informally as splint bones. Their legs also lengthened as their toes disappeared until they were a hooved animal capable of running at great speed. By about 5million years ago, the modern Equus had evolved. Equid teeth also evolved from browsing on soft, tropical plants to adapt to browsing of drier plant material, then to grazing of tougher plains grasses. Thus proto-horses changed from leaf-eating forest-dwellers to grass-eating inhabitants of semi-arid regions worldwide, including the steppes of Eurasia and the Great Plains of North America.|$|E
5|$|When {{the pilgrims}} reach the {{appropriate}} Miqat (depending on where they're coming from), they {{enter into a}} state of holiness – known as Ihram – that consists of wearing two white seamless cloths for the male, with the one wrapped around the waist reaching <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> and the other draped over the left shoulder and tied at the right side; wearing ordinary dress for the female that fulfills the Islamic condition of public dress with hands or face uncovered; taking ablution; declaring the intention (niyah) to perform pilgrimage and to refraining from certain activities such as clipping the nails, shaving any part of the body, having sexual relations; using perfumes, damaging plants, killing animals, covering head (for men) or the face and hands (for women); getting married; or carrying weapons. The ihram is meant to show equality of all pilgrims in front of God: there is no difference between the rich and the poor.|$|E

50|$|Blocks {{that occur}} in the back of <b>the</b> legs and <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>knees,</b> {{initiated}} <b>below</b> <b>the</b> waist, or clotheslines are also generally prohibited and players who use them are subject to much more severe penalties than other illegal tackles. However, a player who plays on the line can block <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>knees</b> (cut block) as long the block is within five yards of the line and the player they block is {{in front of them and}} not engaged by another blocker (chop block).|$|R
