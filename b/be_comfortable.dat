5|$|Even {{after the}} album had been completed, Collins was unhappy about leaving the drumkit to sing lead, {{and the band}} were unsure he would <b>be</b> <b>comfortable</b> as {{frontman}} on tour. The group decided to try anyway, and needed someone to drum while Collins was singing. Collins insisted on choosing the touring drummer himself, selecting Bill Bruford, who he had already worked with in Brand X. Collins continued to drum during instrumental sections.|$|E

The Centre should also master any pass {{that must be}} made on the run. Both the Goal Attack and Wing Attack should be familiar with the long passes and the lob and drop pass. The Goal Attack should also be familiar with all styles of passing. The Goal Shooter should know how to do penalty passes. The Wing Defence should also <b>be</b> <b>comfortable</b> making lob passes. The Goal Defence should know how to make goal-line passes. The Goal Keeper should <b>be</b> <b>comfortable</b> making penalty passes and inbounding the ball.|$|E

He was rated as a highly capable member of the House of Commons bridge team and acquitted himself well in tournaments.|$|E
25|$|Gille Chlerig,1 also Gillocheri 2 or Gillocher, Gillocher or Gylocher is a Gaelic name attested {{only in a}} Latin source, a 13th-century forgery {{designed}} to {{advance the cause of}} Scottish independence. The name is highly corrupted, and therefore the name and meaning is unclear. Gille Chlerig is not known in any capacity other than being father of Morggán, but most scholars seem to <b>be</b> <b>comfortable</b> accepting him as the Mormaer of Earl of Mar who preceded his son Morggán.|$|E

25|$|With the {{independence}} of the Dominions, the British Paramountcy over the princely states came to an end. The rulers of the states were advised to join one of the two dominions by executing an Instrument of Accession. Maharaja Hari Singh of Jammu and Kashmir, along with his prime minister Ram Chandra Kak, decided not to accede to either dominion. The reasons cited were that the Muslim majority population of the State would not <b>be</b> <b>comfortable</b> with joining India, and that the Hindu and Sikh minorities would become vulnerable if the state joined Pakistan.|$|E

Lee went on to say that if a film were made, he would love to voice Smaug, as it would mean he could record his part in England and not have to travel. On 10 January 2011, it was reported that Lee had entered into negotiations to reprise the role of Saruman.|$|E

25|$|The State of Israel {{required}} all {{buildings to}} have access to air-raid shelters from 1951, and all new flats possess access to Merkhav Mugan. All medical and educational facilities are prepared for CRBN attacks (as of 2010) (as an example each surgery room is built to withstand a direct missile hit); some are built with closed-cycle air systems and are capable of being resistant to chemical agents for short periods of time; in addition all must include chemical air filtering systems. The public air-raid shelters are commonly employed as game rooms in peacetime so that the children will <b>be</b> <b>comfortable</b> to enter them at a time of need, and will not be frightened.|$|E
25|$|Notice {{that this}} kinematical {{discussion}} does not {{delve into the}} mechanism by which the required forces are generated. That {{is the subject of}} kinetics. In the case of the carousel, the kinetic discussion would involve perhaps a study of the walker's shoes and the friction they need to generate against the floor of the carousel, or perhaps the dynamics of skateboarding, if the walker switched to travel by skateboard. Whatever the means of travel across the carousel, the forces calculated above must be realized. A very rough analogy is heating your house: you must have a certain temperature to <b>be</b> <b>comfortable,</b> but whether you heat by burning gas or by burning coal is another problem. Kinematics sets the thermostat, kinetics fires the furnace.|$|E
25|$|When {{the lens}} first {{contacts}} the eye, it should <b>be</b> <b>comfortable.</b> A {{brief period of}} irritation may occur, caused by a difference in pH and/or salinity between that of the lens solution and the tear. This discomfort fades quickly as the solution drains away and is replaced by the natural tears. However, if irritation persists, the cause could be a dirty, damaged, or inside-out lens. Removing and inspecting it for damage and proper orientation, and re-cleaning if necessary, should correct the problem. If discomfort continues, the lens should not be worn. In some cases, {{taking a break from}} lens wear for a day may correct the problem. In case of severe discomfort, or if it does not resolve by the next day, the person should be seen as soon as possible by an eye doctor to rule out potentially serious complications.|$|E

25|$|Although {{overshadowed by}} its {{ubiquitous}} successor, {{it was the}} DC-2 that first showed that passenger air travel could <b>be</b> <b>comfortable,</b> safe and reliable. As a token of this, KLM entered its first DC-2 PH-AJU Uiver (Stork) in the October 1934 MacRobertson Air Race between London and Melbourne. Out of the 20 entrants, it finished second behind only the purpose-built de Havilland DH.88 racer Grosvenor House. During the total journey time of 90 hours, 13 min, {{it was in the}} air for 81 hours, 10 min, and won the handicap section of the race. (The DH.88 finished first in the handicap section, but the crew was by regulations allowed to claim only one victory.) It flew KLM's regular 9,000 mile route, (a thousand miles longer than the official race route), carrying mails, making every scheduled passenger stop, turning back once to pick up a stranded passenger, and even became lost in a thunderstorm and briefly stuck in the mud after a diversionary landing at Albury racecourse on the very last leg of the journey.|$|E
25|$|More {{than just}} the band's image was changing, however. In 1988, Pantera {{released}} its first album with Anselmo, titled Power Metal. Power Metal, like Pantera’s previous three albums, was released on Metal Magic Records, but showcased a change in their sound. By far the band’s heaviest album at this point, Power Metal was a mix of 1980s hard rock and thrash metal, sometimes blending both styles in a single song. Complementing the band’s new sonic approach were Anselmo’s harder-edged vocals compared to those of Terrence Lee. After the release of Power Metal, the band members decided to seriously reconsider their glam metal image and sound. Referring to the band's spandex appearance, Vinnie Paul remarked at a band meeting that “These magic clothes don't play music; we do. Let’s just {{go out there and}} <b>be</b> <b>comfortable</b> — jeans, t-shirt, whatever—and see where it goes.” The band members would later ignore their independent releases, including Power Metal, as they sculpted a new, heavier image to accompany their later groove metal sound. Their four independent albums are not listed on the band’s official website and have become hard-to-find collector’s items.|$|E
25|$|Beveridge was {{instrumental}} in compiling a new-look team where Shawn Redhage, Stephen Weigh and Brad Robbins were surrounded by proven NBL players Damian Martin, Drew Williamson, Luke Schenscher and Martin Cattalini, and rising stars Kevin Lisch and Jesse Wagstaff. Paul Rogers relinquished the captaincy heading into the 2009/10 season, handing over the reins to Redhage. The mix turned out to work remarkably well, with the late-season addition of Galen Young to replace the injured Paul Rogers proving the masterstroke that brought about a championship {{in the first year}} the group was together. After claiming the minor premiership and beating the Gold Coast Blaze in the Semi Finals, the Wildcats came up against the Wollongong Hawks in their first Grand Final series since 2003. After Games 1 and 2 proved to <b>be</b> <b>comfortable</b> victories for each home team, the Wildcats found themselves back inside The Jungle at Challenge Stadium for the deciding Game 3 in front of a capacity crowd. The Wildcats found themselves down by as many as 11 points in the second quarter, before an inspired Kevin Lisch exploded offensively to finish with 29 points to take the team to a record fifth NBL Championship with a 96–72 triumph, with Lisch taking home the Larry Sengstock Medal as MVP of the series.|$|E
