Due to {{national}} team commitments for the FIFA U-19 Women's World Cup in Thailand {{in the fall of}} 2004, Harris delayed her enrollment and did not start training with the Tar Heels until the spring of 2005.

25|$|The term {{sadomasochism}} {{is derived}} from the words sadism and masochism. These terms differ somewhat from the same terms used in psychology, since those require that the sadism or masochism cause significant distress or involve non-consenting partners. Sadomasochism refers to the aspects of BDSM surrounding the exchange of physical or emotional pain. Sadism describes sexual pleasure derived by inflicting pain, degradation, humiliation on another person or causing another person to suffer. On the other hand, the masochist enjoys <b>being</b> <b>hurt,</b> humiliated, or suffering within the consensual scenario. Sadomasochistic scenes sometimes reach a level that appear more extreme or cruel than other forms of BDSM—for example, when a masochist is brought to tears or is severely bruised—and is occasionally unwelcome at BDSM events or parties. Sadomasochism does not imply enjoyment through causing or receiving pain in other situations (for example, accidental injury, medical procedures).|$|E

25|$|On {{the night}} of 24 June, a 10-men team led by Subedar Harnam Singh was sent out. Another team led by Subedar Sansar Chand {{followed}} it at a distance. A third team led by Naib Subedar Bana Singh was kept as a reserve force to be deployed in case the first assault team was stalled due to enemy fire. Harnam Singh's team managed to find the rope and the dead bodies of Pande's patrol. The Indian soldiers started climbing the ice wall. They had barely covered a distance of 50 m, when their scout Naik Tara Chand noticed some movement in the front. Alerted by Tara Chand, the Indian soldiers started moving down. But before they could take up the firing positions, the Pakistanis opened fire with medium machine guns. Tara Chand and two others were killed instantaneously. The troops following them were unable to fire back as their weapons had jammed in the -25°C temperature. Later, the Indians found that the Pakistanis were heating their weapons with a kerosene stove kept below the weapon. Harnam Singh's men first took shelter behind icicles, and then hurriedly dug shallow trenches in the ice. The Indian artillery designated to cover them {{could not be used}} to full extent, as there was danger of them <b>being</b> <b>hurt.</b> Ultimately, the attack had to be abandoned.|$|E

500|$|In {{order to}} capture ghosts, Luigi must first use his {{flashlight}} {{to light up}} the ghost and stun it, revealing their heart. When this happens, players use the Poltergust 3000 to suck them up, steadily reducing the ghost's hit points to zero; the more hit points, the more {{time it takes for}} a ghost to be captured, giving them a chance to break free while leaving Luigi more exposed to being harmed; if his HP is reduced to zero from <b>being</b> <b>hurt</b> by the ghosts, the game is over. Once a ghost's HP is reduced to zero, they are captured. Some ghosts cannot be captured easily until Luigi locates three special medallions, each granting the Poltergust with the ability to suck up certain elements from the rooms and use them to capture special ghosts lying within the mansion. In addition to capturing the regular ghosts in the mansion, Luigi must also draw out special, [...] "portrait ghosts" [...] from some rooms, each requiring a condition be met to make them available for capture. Once all the ghosts in a room are captured, it brightens up; the music also changes, being pleasantly whistled by Luigi, while being haunted and spooky when filled with ghosts, with Luigi humming nervously to the tune.|$|E

500|$|Lennox Samuels from The Dallas Morning News {{felt that}} the [...] "great sense of <b>being</b> <b>hurt</b> that is present in 'Oh Father' is far more {{relatable}} than any other Madonna song." [...] Kevin Phinney from the Austin American-Statesman called it the strongest and the most shocking song on Like a Prayer. Stephen Holden from The New York Times wrote that the orchestration of the song was [...] "grandiloquent", while describing Madonna's delivery of the lines as an [...] "angry triumph". Stewart Mason from Allmusic shared Holden's opinion, and described [...] "Oh Father" [...] as [...] " [...] finest ballad performance ever". He added that the [...] "upward modulation of the chorus, accompanied by some overdubbed self-harmonies that feature a very controlled and effective use of Madonna's highest register, is sheer brilliance, giving the song a steely resolve that removes any taint of self-pity from the verses." [...] Music journalist J. D. Considine, while reviewing Like a Prayer for Rolling Stone, believed that despite the song's [...] "lush" [...] string arrangement, some of the lyrics contain a disquieting degree of pain. Hadley Freeman from The Guardian commented that the confessional nature of the lyrics of [...] "Oh Father" [...] was what appealed to her {{the most in the}} song. Negative reception for the song was given by Mark Browning, author of David Fincher: Films That Scar, who called it one of Madonna's weakest efforts, due to the verses sounding more like musical theater than a pop song.|$|E
500|$|A {{music video}} for [...] "Sun of a Gun", {{directed}} by ThirtyTwo, was first released onto Vevo on 19 October 2010. It was filmed in 2010 in Brooklyn, and displays Oh Land {{in two different}} themes: dark and light. According to Oh Land herself, she [...] "wanted the video to show the two different states {{that you can get}} in when you are in love with someone". The dark side reflects her [...] "desire to protect oneself from <b>being</b> <b>hurt</b> and celebrating independence", while the light side reflects her [...] "desire to be loved and the joys of being in love". The video opens with the dark side of Oh Land, wearing a black dress and extensive eye makeup. She performs the song's choreography atop a cloud-like stage, surrounded by blinking lights. As the track's chorus begins, the light side of Oh Land appears, in a skin-colored dress and longer hair, in front of a screen displaying the sun. The second verse finds her wearing a different black dress, and singing the song by many mirrors; simultaneously, visuals of Oh Land on the ground dancing appear. The following chorus shows the same scenario, but in the same skin-colored dress from earlier. In the song's bridge, both versions of the singer pull a shawl over their head, allowing it to move with the wind. The video concludes with Oh Land closing her eyes as the screen cuts to black.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} with 1999's Guerrilla, which featured songs with [...] "self-consciously disposable, happy" [...] lyrics, the tracks on Rings Around the World are, according to Rhys, [...] "broodier and more revealing". The track [...] "No Sympathy" [...] was originally written {{for a film}} entitled Plop, which followed three unsympathetic characters who lived for a week {{as though it were}} their last. Rhys has described the song as quite a departure for him as a lyric writer and claimed that out of context it could appear bleak and scary. [...] "Presidential Suite", about former United States and Russian presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin, is [...] "a reflective look back at the decadent nineties" [...] during the Lewinsky scandal and asks if [...] "we need to know if he really came inside her mouth?". [...] "Juxtapozed with U" [...] addresses social injustice and is about [...] "house prices going up, and people being left behind by the super rich" [...] and has been described by Rhys as [...] "grotesque in its upness and lift". [...] "Sidewalk Serfer Girl" [...] was initially written about Patti White Bull, a girl who fell into a coma for 15 years, awaking in 1999, but became an amalgamation of the lyrics of several different songs, including one section in which Rhys describes his disdain for extreme sports. [...] "Receptacle for the Respectable" [...] is about simultaneously being in awe of, and <b>being</b> <b>hurt</b> by, a [...] "girl around town" [...] while [...] "It's Not the End of the World?" [...] is [...] "a romantic song about growing old". [...] "Run! Christian, Run!" [...] was influenced by guitarist Huw Bunford's interest in [...] "doomsday cult websites". Bunford printed out several essays from these websites and gave them to Rhys who used them as inspiration for his lyrics along with his own recollections of watching Christian television shows during the band's American tours. The album's title track, [...] "(Drawing) Rings Around the World", is based on an idea put forward by Rhy's girlfriend's father and is about [...] "all the rings of communication around the world. All the rings of pollution, and all the radioactivity that goes around". [...] "Shoot Doris Day" [...] refers to shooting American singer and actress Doris Day with film—"a very cinematic reference" [...] for a song which Rhys claims is [...] "over-the-top lyrically". The track is about [...] "how people change" [...] and also references Labour Party 'spin doctor' Peter Mandelson, in the guise of 'Victor Panache'.|$|E
