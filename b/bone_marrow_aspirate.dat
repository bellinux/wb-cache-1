40|$|AbstractTo {{test the}} {{validity}} of the polymerase chain reaction for diagnosing American visceral leishmaniasis, 88 suspected cases were studied.

Samples of <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> and peripheral blood were processed by polymerase chain reaction to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the test and its agreement beyond chance with microscopy examination. The polymerase chain reaction was positive in <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> of 100 % of the patients with amastigotes seen with microscopy examination, and in 59. 5 % in those where no parasite were seen. Agreement beyond chance between visualization of the parasite in <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>aspirates</b> and polymerase chain reaction was considered weak (Kappa= 0. 41). Concordance between polymerase chain reaction of <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>aspirates</b> and of peripheral blood was considered excellent (Kappa= 0. 88).

This research aimed to study the probability of using autologous <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> {{as a source of}} mesenchymal stem cell for patients with tuberculous spondylitis. As many as nine patients with tuberculous spondylitis were used as samples. During the procedure, the vertebral lesion material and iliac <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>aspirates</b> were obtained for acid fast staining, bacteria culture, and PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests for Mycobacterium tuberculosis at the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory of Faculty of Medicine Universitas Indonesia.

40|$|Aim Locoregional recurrences {{and distant}} metastases in {{adequately}} treated {{head and neck}} squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients have a dismal effect on survival. Tumor cells that escape histopathological detection might be the prime cause of this effect. We evaluated whether minimal residual cancer (MRC) in deep surgical margins and disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) in <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>aspirates</b> are associated with clinicohistopathological parameters and outcome. Methods Submucosal samples of deep resection margins of 105 HNSCC patients with histopathologically tumor-free surgical margins were analysed {{for the presence of}} MRC using hLy- 6 D qRT-PCR. Bone-marrow aspirates of 76 of these patients were analysed for DTCs by immunocytochemical staining. Presence of molecular-positive deep surgical margins, presence of DTC in <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>aspirates,</b> and clinicohistopathological parameters were tested for associations with survival parameters by univariate and multivariate analyses. Results In addition to lymph node stage, it appeared that vasoinvasive growth and particularly infiltrative growth pattern are significant predictors for locoregional recurrence (p[*]=[*] 0. 041 and p[*]=[*] 0. 006, respectively) and disease-free survival (p[*]=[*] 0. 014 and p[*]=[*] 0. 008, respectively). Remarkably, neither the presence of molecular-positive deep surgical margins nor that of DTC in <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>aspirates</b> were significantly related to outcome. Conclusions The presence of vasoinvasive and infiltrative growth in HNSCC tumor specimens are significant risk-factors for locoregional recurrence and disease-free survival. At present there seems no role for molecular analysis of deep surgical margins and <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>aspirates</b> in predicting outcome with the methods used...|$|R

40|$|Summary: A {{method for}} non-haem iron {{analysis}} in <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>aspirates</b> using graphite furnace atomic absorption Spectrophotometry has been developed. <b>Bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>aspirates</b> {{were obtained from}} patients with various disorders.
