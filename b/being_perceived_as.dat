These higher notes, far from <b>being</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> conventional harmony, function as harmonics that alter the timbre of the fundamental note like mixture stops on a pipe organ. An example is {{the song of the}} golden oriole in Le loriot of the Catalogue d'oiseaux for solo piano (Example 4).|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{dissatisfaction with}} McClellan's failure to {{reinforce}} Pope, Lincoln was desperate, and restored him to command of all forces around Washington, {{to the dismay}} of all in his cabinet but Seward. Two days after McClellan's return to command, General Robert E. Lee's forces crossed the Potomac River into Maryland, leading to the Battle of Antietam in September 1862. The ensuing Union victory was among the bloodiest in American history, but it enabled Lincoln to announce that he would issue an Emancipation Proclamation in January. Having composed the Proclamation some time earlier, Lincoln had waited for a military victory to publish it to avoid it <b>being</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> the product of desperation.|$|E
5|$|The idea of {{it being}} a simpler project due to the {{original}} art being reusable {{turned out to be}} untrue: because so much time had passed since the original's release, there were multiple parts that had to be reworked, leading to a process similar to creating a whole new game from scratch. All character graphics were redone, special effects were changed, and certain animations were added, such as sleeping animations. Some item placements were changed, the overall difficulty was adjusted, and some characters' battle statistics were altered; one such instance was making Kechi stronger than Oryu, due to it <b>being</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> illogical that a person with a sword would be weaker than a person fighting with her bare hands.|$|E
40|$|Human {{beings are}} most often an {{integrated}} part of com-plex systems. In order to describe such a system with appropriate accuracy {{it is necessary to}} model the human components with the same accuracy as the technical components. Human factors must be included and mo-delled with the same degree of precision as the system’s mechanical parts. A human <b>being</b> is <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> a psychosomatic unit with cognitive capacities embedded in a social environ-ment. Human behaviour is structurally highly complex.

5|$|In Britain gay saunas were {{routinely}} raided by police {{up until the}} end of the 1980s (for example raids in May 1988 on Brownies in Streatham, the owner getting a six-month jail sentence and a £5,000 fine, and the Brooklyn House Hotel sauna in Manchester). By the 1990s, with increasing scrutiny of the costs of such operations (charges of gross indecency in a sauna normally needing the expense of undercover officers), a reduced likelihood of successful prosecution, concerns of <b>being</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> homophobic, and little public interest in victimless crime, gay saunas became free to operate without the risk of being raided by police. Also, police attitudes meant that they were more willing to turn a blind eye because they preferred such activity to take place in a contained environment rather than outdoors even though users were still committing the homosexual sexual offence of gross indecency, until gross indecency was wiped from the statute books following the Sexual Offences Act 2003.|$|E

50|$|Inclusive Masculinity, {{underpinned}} {{by social}} constructionist theory, {{is concerned with}} how homophobia and homohysteria stratifies men’s gender. Its central concept is homohysteria, which describes the context where men avoid certain behaviors {{in order to avoid}} <b>being</b> publicly <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> gay. Inclusive masculinity theory focuses on the impact of gender policing by homophobia, and the stratification of masculinity types that occur under different cultural configurations of homohysteria. It is argued that as homohysteria decreases, men no longer need to position themselves as hypermasculine in order to be thought heterosexual. When this occurs, men can engage in a variety of previously feminine practices without the fear of <b>being</b> <b>perceived</b> gay.|$|R
50|$|In general, the {{entrepreneurial}} discourse {{has opened up}} to move beyond a strictly economic phenomenon, rather than <b>being</b> <b>perceived</b> primarily <b>as</b> a social process at large. Preceding the conceptual formation were two traces of social entrepreneurship and eco-preneurship, dealing primarily with the social and ecological dimensions of sustainability. Primary associations with social entrepreneurship have also been establishing not-for-profit venturing and charities to innovatively address and solve social problems, whereas ecopreneurship has been primarily focused on solving environmental problems.

25|$|The {{campaign}} received official endorsement by the Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, but {{it found}} that <b>being</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> government-endorsed was double-edged.

25|$|At {{the same}} time, Agathocles issued an {{intriguing}} range of bilingual coinage, displaying {{what seems to}} be Buddhist as well as Hindu symbolism. The coins, manufactured according to the Indian standard, using either Brahmi, Greek or Kharoshthi (a first in the Greek world), and displaying symbols of the various faiths in India, tend to indicate a considerable willingness to accommodate local languages and beliefs, to an extent unseen in subsequent Indo-Greek kings. They may be indicative of the considerable efforts of the first Indo-Greek kings to secure support from Indian populations and avoid <b>being</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> invaders, efforts which may have subsided once the Indo-Greek kingdoms were more securely in place.|$|E
25|$|To avoid <b>being</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> radical, {{organizers}} rejected {{support from}} Communist groups.

In the days before August 28, the FBI called celebrity backers to inform them of the organizers' communist connections and advising them to withdraw their support. When William C. Sullivan produced a lengthy report on August 23 suggesting that Communists had failed to appreciably infiltrate the civil rights movement, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover rejected its contents. Strom Thurmond launched a prominent public attack on the March as Communist, and singled out Rustin in particular as a Communist and a gay man.|$|E

After McKinley's assassination, President Theodore Roosevelt instead sent Mosby west as a special agent of the Department of the Interior. There, Mosby dealt with illegal fencing of range land by cattle barons in Colorado and Nebraska, who often used fake homestead claims by military widows as well as violated the Van Wyck Fence Law of 1885. When witnesses refused to come forward to testify about illegal fencing for fear of retaliation, Mosby upheld the law by first sending notices to the affected landowner. The Pawnee Cattle Company capitulated in Colorado, so Mosby moved on to western Nebraska, where he learned the land agent actually lived in Iowa and failed to supervise the range.|$|E
