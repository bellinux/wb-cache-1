50|$|The <b>bridle</b> <b>shiner</b> mainly {{feeds on}} {{zooplankton}} and aquatic insect larvae such as chironomids. Plant materials {{make up a}} small portion of its diet.|$|E
50|$|The sand shiner (Notropis stramineus) and mimic shiner (Notropis volucellus) are similar, {{but lack}} a {{prominent}} lateral band. The <b>bridle</b> <b>shiner</b> {{is very similar}} to other black-lined shiners, including the pugnose shiner (Notropis anogenus), blackchin shiner (Notropis heterodon) and blacknose shiner (Notropis heterolepis). The <b>bridle</b> <b>shiner</b> can be distinguished from pugnose and blackchin shiners by the lack of pigment on the lower jaw. Blacknose shiners also lack this pigment, but have a more subterminal mouth as well as eight anal rays: bridles typically have seven.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bridle</b> <b>shiner</b> (Notropis bifrenatus) is {{a member}} of the minnow family (Cyprinidae). This species has been {{identified}} as being of Special Concern by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC).|$|E
50|$|According to a 1980 survey, {{the pond}} {{contains}} largemouth bass, chain pickerel, yellow perch, white perch, bluegill, pumpkinseed, brown bullhead, white suckers, and golden and <b>bridled</b> <b>shiners.</b> It {{is a popular}} place for ice fishing.|$|R
50|$|A bypass of the {{southern}} terminus of PA 402 was proposed in 1991 to deter traffic off the congested intersection with US 209 and US 209 Bus. {{in the village of}} Marshalls Creek. The same year, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) got involved in the feasibility study, and preliminary engineering work was finished in 1995. The project, notorious for delays, first hit a barrier in 1997, when a pair of species of endangered fish (<b>Bridle</b> <b>shiners</b> and Iron-colored shiners) were found in Marshalls Creek. In 2000, after a Final Environmental Impact Statement had been completed, the route was approved by the Federal Highway Administration. In 2004, a delay was created again, when pyrite was found in the area, which led to engineers finding a way to not harm the fish in Marshalls Creek.|$|R
40|$|A century-old dam across Black Brook {{created an}} {{impoundment}} called Maxwell Pond, {{which was a}} site for ice harvesting, fishing, swimming and other recreation. Over time, sediment from poorly managed industrial sites accumulated in the pond, which became stagnant and shallow. As a result, the NH Dept. of Environmental Services (DES) added Maxwell Pond to the 2002 Clean Water Act (CWA) section 303 (d) list of impaired waters. Stakeholders collaborated for seven years to restore water quality by reducing upstream sediment sources and removal of the dam in 2009. Once Black Brook returned to its free-flowing condition, the dissolved oxygen level rebounded and the brook could once again support its aquatic life designated use. As {{a result of the}} improvements, in 2010 DES removed the former Maxwell Pond portion of Black Brook from the state 2 ̆ 7 s CWA section 303 (d) list of impaired waters for dissolved oxygen. Funds for this 685, 000 restoration project were derived from a diverse portfolio of stakeholders that included the City of Manchester, EPA, DES, NH Fish 2 ̆ 6 Game, NH State Conservation Committee, NH Corporate Wetlands Restoration Partnership, American Rivers/NOAA, Gulf of Maine Council/NOAA, Fairpoint Communications, National Grid, Aggregate Industries, Amoskeag Fishways, Dubois 2 ̆ 6 King, Inc., and Trout Unlimited. Thanks to the incredible collaboration and innovative funding strategies employed to restore Black Brook, this project was accepted as a Section 319 Nonpoint Source Program Success Story by the EPA in 2011. In addition to the local community accolades for flood relief, elimination of a public safety hazard, and the state and federal acknowledgement of successful restoration of impaired surface waters in NH, the Black Brook Restoration Project also garnered national attention in 2010. American Rivers selected this project as one of three in the United States to be featured in their Restoring America 2 ̆ 7 s Rivers: Preparing for the Future DVD that focused upon flooding, community decision makers, and restoration of vital habitats for fish and wildlife. This presentation will provide attendees with an overview of the dam removal process on Black Brook, the project management and funding collaborations that lead to success, data gathered pre and post-dam removal that demonstrate the return of state and federally listed fish species (<b>Bridle</b> <b>shiners,</b> Sea lamprey, American eel, Tesselated darters, Atlantic salmon) to Black Brook, and geomorphic indicators that demonstrate ongoing channel evolution and a return to the reference condition within the former impoundment...|$|R
50|$|The <b>bridle</b> <b>shiner</b> {{is found}} in eastern North America, from eastern Lake Ontario, east to Maine, and south to South Carolina. In Ontario, it {{is found in}} lowland areas in the eastern Lake Ontario {{drainage}} and the Saint Lawrence River. The most stable population is found around the Thousand Islands.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bridle</b> <b>shiner</b> {{is found}} in quiet areas of streams and {{occasionally}} in lakes. It is usually associated with abundant submersed aquatic vegetation and a river bottom composed of silt and sometimes sand. It uses the vegetation for protection, feeding, and spawning. It {{has been found in}} moderately turbid water, but prefers clear water.|$|E
50|$|Now a {{management}} prospect that is running in Canada {{for the management}} of the <b>Bridle</b> <b>Shiner</b> is at first a five year program to watch and collect data on the species. This includes collecting data on its migration movements and looking at the impacts on the regions that the species uses as its habitat. This would be a good start to see what is exactly affecting the species sense there is no record for the average population size of the spaces in many regions. The model that was mentioned above would also help with pinpointing areas where to locate and collect efficient data on the Lythrurus lirus species. Then with the added information on the species, effective management can be planned to ensure that the species does flourish like it is now or even at a greater rate in the future, rather than deteriorating without any means of information of why it could possibly be declining.|$|E
40|$|<b>Bridle</b> <b>Shiner</b> (Notropis bifrenatus) is {{apparently}} declining {{over most of}} its range and is currently listed as a species of concern in Connecticut. Using an occupancy modeling framework in program PRESENCE, my study compared seining and electrofishing backpack unit detection probabilities of <b>Bridle</b> <b>Shiner.</b> This research indicated the apparent decline of <b>Bridle</b> <b>Shiner</b> in the state was {{in part due to}} changes in sampling gear used for statewide surveys. Seining used 50 years ago was demonstrably more effective at capturing <b>Bridle</b> <b>Shiner</b> than the currently favored and more frequently used electrofishing gear. In light of this recent finding, I seined at known historic sites in Connecticut and found that some populations once thought to be extirpated are in fact extant. Nonetheless, <b>Bridle</b> <b>Shiner</b> has a sharply reduced range in Connecticut, in that the number of site occurrences has declined 60 % over 50 years. Using geospatial tools I identified landscape-scale habitat measures that were potential correlates of extirpation. Using logistic regression, I investigated metrics associated with land cover change, such as impervious surfaces and those indicative of habitat fragmentation and patch isolation. I found that the current <b>Bridle</b> <b>Shiner</b> distribution in Connecticut can be explained by areas of high forest cover and low impervious cover. My results provide needed context on declines in this species and potential avenues for conservation actions...|$|E
40|$|The <b>bridle</b> <b>shiner</b> (Notropis bifrenatus) is {{believed}} to have once been an important prey item throughout its native range; however, recent reports suggest populations have declined significantly and the species is now widely considered as imperiled. Habitats that are associated with this species are typically difficult to sample using traditional methods, making it unclear how much of the observed range reduction could be actual or perceived. My objectives were to estimate detection probability of <b>bridle</b> <b>shiner,</b> evaluate the importance of habitat on their distribution, and determine patterns of movement among habitat patches. I employed a repeated surveys design to estimate detection probability based on capture history and to draw inferences about sites where the species was never encountered. <b>Bridle</b> <b>shiner</b> were batch marked to evaluate among-patch movement distances and frequencies. Movement was infrequent and overall detection probability was high. Detectability was negatively associated with mean water velocity and positively associated with abundance. Occupied habitats tended to have higher springtime macrophyte cover, stable flows over time, and were connected by short distances to similar areas. Among occupied patches, those with shallower mean depths supported <b>bridle</b> <b>shiner</b> in high abundance later in the year, which may be an indication of habitat that is important for recruitment and survival. My findings suggest that false absences are not likely the cause of reported declines in Connecticut and that habitat degradation may be a leading cause of extirpations throughout the state...|$|E
