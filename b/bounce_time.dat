40|$|AbstractContact bounce of relay, {{which is}} {{the main cause of}} {{electric}} abrasion and material erosion, is inevitable. By using the mode expansion form, the dynamic behavior of two different reed systems for aerospace relays is analyzed. The dynamic model uses Euler-Bernoulli beam theory for cantilever beam, in which the driving force (or driving moment) of the electromagnetic system is taken into account, and the contact force between moving contact and stationary contact is simulated by the Kelvin-Voigt viscoelastic contact model. Analytical results have been complemented by the finite difference calculation of the nonlinear partial differential equations of reed system. The calculation results indicate that with the driving force (or driving moment) being increased, the closing time of contact is decreased, but the maximum bouncing displacement and <b>bouncing</b> <b>time</b> tend to be decreased first and then increased, which means that there are minimum values of maximum bouncing displacement and <b>bouncing</b> <b>time.</b> The closing time of contact, the maximum bouncing displacement, and <b>bouncing</b> <b>time</b> all tend to be decreasing with the pushrod being approaching the contact. The model can be used as design tool to improve relay performance and reduce contact bounce...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Electronic {{components}} {{are the basis}} of electronic equipment, and their reliability and lifetime have {{a direct impact on}} the work efficiency of the whole electric system. In fact, the test data on life characteristic parameters (LCP) of electronic components present random fluctuations because of the existence of some disturbing factors in the process of life test. This will bring great obstacles to the study on the rules of LCP, the reliability and life forecasting of electronic components. In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes a method of the determination of weight coefficients and an improved weighted average algorithm to reveal the rules of LCP. In the improved weighted average algorithm, the latest data is constantly introduced while the oldest data is removed.

This author examined the motion of droplets with the application to the raindrop problem. The study was restricted to the collision of equal-sized drops along their line of centers. Numerical solutions were developed to study the rebound of water droplets in air. It is found that except for a small viscous effect, the Weber number of the drops determines {{the dynamics of the}} collision and the <b>bounce</b> <b>time.</b> Decent et al. [4] studied the formation of a liquid bridge during the coalescence of droplets. In this paper, the authors considered a mathematical model where the pressure singularity is removed at the instant of the impact for the coalescence of two viscous liquid volumes in an inviscid gas or in a vacuum environment. The formation of the liquid bridge is examined for two cases: (a) two infinitely long liquid cylinders, and (b) two coalescing spheres. In both cases the numerical solutions are calculated for the velocity and pressure fields, and the removal of the pressure singularity is confirmed.|$|E
40|$|By {{considering}} a simplified but exact model for realizing the ekpyrotic scenario, we clarify various assumptions {{that have been}} used in the literature. In particular, we discuss the new ekpyrotic prescription for passing the perturbations through the singularity which we show to provide a spectrum depending on a non physical normalization function. We also show that this prescription does not reproduce the exact result for a sharp transition. Then, more generally, we demonstrate that, in the only case where a bounce can be obtained in Einstein General Relativity without facing singularities and/or violation of the standard energy conditions, the bounce cannot be made arbitrarily short. This contrasts with the standard (inflationary) situation where the transition between two eras with different values of the equation of state can be considered as instantaneous. We then argue that the usually conserved quantities are not constant on a typical <b>bounce</b> <b>time</b> scale. Finally, we also examine the case of a test scalar field (or gravitational waves) where similar results are obtained. We conclude that the full dynamical equations of the underlying theory should be solved in a non singular case before any conclusion can be drawn.

40|$|Dynamic {{information}} in acoustical signals produced by bouncing objects {{is often used}} by listeners to predict the objects’ future behavior (e. g., hitting a ball). This study examined factors that affect the accuracy of motor responses to sounds of real-world dynamic events. In experiment 1, listeners heard 2 – 5 bounces from a tennis ball, ping-pong, basketball, or wiffle ball, and would tap to indicate {{the time of the}} next bounce in a series. Across ball types and number of bounces, listeners were extremely accurate in predicting the correct <b>bounce</b> <b>time</b> (CT) with a mean prediction error of only 2. 58 % of the CT. Prediction based on a physical model of bouncing events indicated that listeners relied primarily on temporal cues when estimating the timing of the next bounce, {{and to a lesser extent}} on the loudness and spectral cues. In experiment 2, the timing of each bounce pattern was altered to correspond to the bounce timing pattern of another ball, producing stimuli with contradictory acoustic cues. Nevertheless, listeners remained highly accurate in their estimates of bounce timing. This suggests that listeners can adopt their estimates of bouncing-object timing based on acoustic cues that provide most veridical information about dynamic aspects of object behavior...|$|E

40|$|Experimental and {{theoretical}} studies {{are made of}} a typical snap-action rocker switch, to establish the wear mechanisms in the pivoting contact. The rocker switch, used extensively in consumer goods, operates in the medium duty current range, (1 - 30 Amps). Highspeed photographic {{studies have shown that}} the main cause of wear is arcing, occurring during separation and bounce at the pivot contacts. To reduce the bounce a computer-based mathematical model of the system dynamics is developed and optimised; this results in recommended design changes. These changes are tested under full current endurance conditions, and show significant improvements in wear. The model of the switch dynamics relates the mathematics of motion to the bounce occuring at the pivot contact, without the influence of current. To show the effect of current and arcing, an automatic test system is developed for the controlled testing of electrical contacts. The system has the ability to evaluate arc energy, bounce times, and contact resistance. The results presented detail the influence of d. c current on contact <b>bounce</b> <b>time,</b> and identify the importance of the subsequent bounce time; which is defined for a single make operation, as the total duration of the bounces occurring after the first bounce. To compare the erosion profiles of the switch and test system, the system is operated under full load current endurance conditions, to evaluate wear. This comparison shows that the wear in the real switch contacts is greater, as result of the additional contact movement of slip and rolling. Arrow-Hart (Europe) Ltd, Plymouth, Devo...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{background}} {{conditions for a}} bounce uniquely driven by a single scalar field model with a generalized kinetic term $K(X) $, without any additional matter field. At the background level we impose the existence of two turning points where the derivative of the Hubble parameter $H$ changes sign and of a bounce point where the Hubble parameter vanishes. We find the conditions for $K(X) $ and the potential which ensure the above requirements. We then give the examples of two models constructed according to these conditions. One {{is based on a}} quadratic $K(X) $, and the other a $K(X) $ which is avoiding divergences of the second time derivative of the scalar field, which may otherwise occur. An appropriate choice of the initial conditions can lead to a sequence of consecutive bounces, or oscillations of $H$. In the region where these models have a constant potential they are adiabatic on any scale and because of this they may not conserve curvature perturbations on super-horizon scales. While at the perturbation level one class of models is free from ghosts and singularities of the classical equations of motion, in general gradient instabilities are present around the <b>bounce</b> <b>time,</b> because the sign of the squared speed of sound is opposite to the sign of the time derivative of $H$. We discuss how this kind of instabilities could be avoided by modifying the Lagrangian by introducing Galileion terms in order to prevent a negative squared speed of sound around the bounce.

40|$|The {{magnetic}} energy of nonlinear Alfven waves in compressible plasmas may be ponderomotively coupled only to ion-acoustic quasi-modes which modulate the wave phase velocity and cause wave-front steepening. In the collisionless plasma with β= 0, {{the dynamics of}} nonlinear Alfven wave is also affected by the resonant particle-wave interactions. Upon relatively rapid evolution (compared to the particle <b>bounce</b> <b>time),</b> the quasi-stationary wave structures, identical to the so called (Alfvenic) Rotational Discontinuities, form, the emergence and dynamics of {{which has not been}} previously understood. Collisionless (Landau) dissipation of nonlinear Alfven waves is also a plausible and natural mechanism of the solar wind heating. Considering a strong, compressible, Alfvenic turbulence as an ensemble of randomly interacting Alfvenic discontinuities and nonlinear waves, it is shown that there exist two distinct phases of turbulence. What phase realizes depends on whether this collisionless damping is strong enough to provide adequate energy sink at all scales and, thus, to support a steady-state cascade of the wave energy. In long-time asymptotics, however, the particle distribution function is affected by the wave magnetic fields. In this regime of nonlinear Landau damping, resonant particles are trapped in the quasi-stationary Alfvenic discontinuities, giving rise to a formation of a plateau on the distribution function and quenching collisionless damping. Using the virial theorem for trapped particles, it is analytically demonstrated that their effect on the nonlinear dynamics of such discontinuities is non-trivial and forces a significant departure of the theory from the conventional paradigm.

Forty‐two dipolarization events from 2008 and 2009 observed by Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms probes covering the inner plasma sheet from 8 RE to 12 RE during geomagnetic activity identified by the AL index are analyzed. The number of observed events with cigar‐type distributions (peaks at 0 ° and 180 °) decreases sharply below 1 [*]keV after dipolarization because in many of these events, electron distributions became more isotropized. From above 1 [*]keV to a few tens of keV, however, the observed number of cigar‐type events increases after dipolarization and the number of isotropic events decreases. These changes can be related to the ineffectiveness of Fermi acceleration below 1 [*]keV (at those energies, dipolarization time becomes comparable to electron <b>bounce</b> <b>time).</b> Model‐calculated pitch angle distributions after dipolarization with the effect of betatron and Fermi acceleration tested indicate that these adiabatic acceleration mechanisms can explain the observed patterns of event number changes over a large range of energies for cigar events and isotropic events.

40|$|Extensive {{three-dimensional}} {{computer simulations}} of the magnetosphere-ionosphere (M-I) coupling are performed to study self-excitation of auroral arcs with {{special emphasis on}} 1) nonlinear evolution of the feedback instability in the M-I coupling system, 2) controlling mechanisms of the auroral arc structure, 3) formation of a field-aligned electric potential structure {{in association with the}} development of the feedback instability, and 4) effects of the parallel potential generation on auroral arc development. As was already shown by Sato [1978] and Watanabe and Sato [1988], it is reconfirmed that the feedback instability produces a longitudinally elongated, latitudinally striated structure where the upward field-aligned current and the ionospheric density are locally enhanced. On top of this the present extended study reveals the following important new features : 1) The global distribution of the striation structure is primarily governed by the magnetospheric convection pattern and the ionospheric density distribution. 2) There appears a significant dawn-dusk asymmetry in the auroral arc formation, even though the apparent geometrical relationship is symmetric. This dawn-dusk asymmetry reflects the geometrical fact that the ionospheric Pedersen current closing the magnetospheric current is anti-symmetric with respect to the noon-midnight plane, while the self-closed Hall current is symmetric. 3) The recombination effect plays {{a significant role in the}} global, as well as local, development of the auroral arc structure. The nonlinearlty of recombination, in conjunction with the closure of an arc-associated local field-aligned current system, acts to destroy an old arc and creates a new arc in a different but adjacent position. This results in a peculiar behavior of auroral arc formation and deformation. 4) A V-shaped field aligned potential structure is created in association with an auroral arc. Rapid increase in the electron density and the local upward field-aligned current of an arc arises as a result of enhanced ionization by precipitating electrons accelerated by the parallel potential. 5) A drastic oscillatory behavior of appearance and disappearance of auroral arcs is obtained when the ionization effect is strong.

40|$|For a realistic, highly stretched, {{two-dimensional}} tail configuration, {{in which}} the pressure gradient force is balanced with the curved field line tension force at the equator, the growth rates and the real frequencies of the ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and two component fluid (nonideal MHD) ballooning modes, {{in which the}} phrase “two component fluid” means that the Hall and the electron pressure gradient terms {{are included in the}} generalized Ohm's law, the ion bounce frequency ω bi, the ion magnetic drift frequency ω di, the ion diamagnetic drift frequency ω*i, and the ion cyclotron frequency ω ci are calculated numerically at the equator as a function of X from the near-Earth tail (X = − 15 R E) to the midtail (X = − 30 R E). Contrary to the well-known dipole field case, in which the bounce frequency decreases with increasing ∣X∣, the ion bounce frequency increases with ∣X∣ for the tail configuration. The ion magnetic drift frequency dominated by the curvature drift frequency also increases with increasing ∣X∣. The exact growth rates of the ideal and nonideal ballooning modes, γ e and γ ne, which are nearly equal, are given by 1. 22 V A /R c, where V A is the Alfvén velocity and R c is the field line curvature radius at the equator, and satisfy ω bi, ω di, ω*i < γ e < ω ci on average in the near-Earth tail at X ∼ − 15 R E. Also, the ion motion remains adiabatic in the near-Earth tail at X ∼ − 15 R E. Therefore it is a posteriori verified that the fluid or MHD description of the linear stability of the ballooning instability is valid, and the critical β and the Alfvén time scale τ A ∼ R c /V A of the ballooning instability onset obtained by the fluid theory are validated in the near-Earth tail as close as 15 R E from the Earth. Despite the plasma being collisionless and high-β in the near-Earth tail, the subtle collisionless kinetic effects due to the field line curvature in high-β collisionless plasma are not significant enough to invalidate the fluid description in the near-Earth tail.
