25|$|Dennett {{claims that}} {{conventional}} {{explanations of the}} colour change <b>boil</b> <b>down</b> to either Orwellian or Stalinesque hypotheses, which he says {{are the result of}} Descartes' continued influence on our vision of the mind. In an Orwellian hypothesis, the subject comes to one conclusion, then goes back and changes that memory in light of subsequent events. This is akin to George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, where records of the past are routinely altered. In a Stalinesque hypothesis, the two events would be reconciled prior to entering the subject's consciousness, with the final result presented as fully resolved. This is akin to Joseph Stalin's show trials, where the verdict has been decided in advance and the trial is just a rote presentation.|$|E

25|$|Counterplans: The {{negative}} {{can present}} a counter {{solution to the}} affirmative case's problem {{which may or may}} not go against the resolution. This is generally accompanied by on-case arguments that the counterplan does not solve, as well as disadvantages that link to the affirmative case but not the counterplan. Counterplans narrow down the on-case arguments to: advantages the counterplan can not borrow, the inherency, and the solvency. Upon the negative running a counterplan, most debates <b>boil</b> <b>down</b> to the solvency of the affirmative case, and the disadvantages. Counterplans must be competitive with the plan. This means that the counterplan must either be mutually exclusive with the affirmative (for example, one cannot both increase oil production (a hypothetical plan) and decrease oil production (a hypothetical counterplan) or be undesirable in conjunction with the plan (the negative must win that the inclusion of the plan would cause some form of harm that the counterplan alone would avoid).|$|E

Ryan said she would love the prospect of returning to The Office in future episodes, but that there are currently no plans for such a return: [...] "I think that door [...] will always be open, just because it's such a nice party to go to.

Fogel asserted that part of the problem was Chang's [...] "lack of training as a historian" [...] and another part was [...] "the book's dual aim as passionate polemic and dispassionate history". Fogel also writes: [...] "Dozens of Japanese scholars are now actively engaged in research on every aspect of the war.... Indeed, we know many details of the Nanjing massacre, Japanese sexual exploitation of 'comfort women,' and biological and chemical warfare used in China because of the trailblazing research" [...] of Japanese scholars.|$|E

He defended secretly baptizing the dying as [...] "a generous mark of sincere concern and affection". He concluded by comparing journalists' treatment of Mother Teresa to Christ being spat upon.|$|E

50|$|By the mid-1860s, {{drought and}} {{recession}} {{had led to}} a collapse in the pastoral industry in north Queensland. In order to salvage some profit, squatters turned to the <b>boiling</b> <b>down</b> of sheep and cattle for tallow (for candles and soap). Hoofs and horns were utilised for oil, and hides for leather. In 1864 a number of small-scale <b>boiling</b> <b>down</b> works were established on pastoral properties in the Kennedy and gulf districts, but the <b>boiling</b> <b>down</b> industry became more professional in 1866, when Towns & Co. opened a <b>boiling</b> <b>down</b> plant at Cleveland Bay, and Morehead & Young, partners in the Scottish Australian Pastoral Company, opened a similar operation on the Albert River where the settlement of Burketown had been established in 1865. Neither of these establishments survived {{for any length of}} time. At Cleveland Bay, the Queensland Meat Export Company established a meatworks south of Townsville on Alligator Creek in 1879, using some of the equipment from Towns' factory.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Boiling</b> <b>down</b> {{works have}} been an {{important}} industry throughout Queensland during a number of periods. The establishment of such works usually coincided with drought and low prices for wool and beef. Boiling-down factories were started in Brisbane in 1843 by John [...] "Tinker" [...] Campbell and in Ipswich in 1847. By 1851, two works were located in Ipswich. Other <b>boiling</b> <b>down</b> works being established on the Darling Downs during the 1860s, included Campbell's operation on Westbrook Homestead, the depression of the time being the predominant reason behind the establishment of such industries. Consequently, reasons behind {{the establishment of the}} <b>boiling</b> <b>down</b> works at St Lawrence may also have been due to the effects of the depression.|$|R

2500|$|US forces {{sometimes}} employed sophisticated airmobile tactics, using integrated helicopter landings, artillery support, and troop insertions {{to surround}} enemy contacts and close off escape routes. The outstanding mobility {{of the helicopter}} made this possible, and these versatile machines could be sent into action in several configurations (troop transport, gunship, med-evac, heavy lift and supply). Helicopters allowed transport and deployment of infantry, artillery, medical, and supply elements to almost any location, presenting a formidable instrument that enhanced American and ARVN operations. When combined with other aerial elements such as fixed wing air support this combat power was multiplied, and {{opened up a whole}} new dimension of operational maneuver. But helicopters also had several vulnerabilities. They required a vast and expensive [...] "logistical tail" [...] of maintenance, fuel, munitions and bases. No nation except the US could afford such expense- fielding some 12,000 machines in Vietnam, almost half of which were shot down or lost due to accidents. The ability of helicopters to move men and material anywhere was impressive but also meant US and ARVN troops in some instances were heavily dependent on them. Destruction of the helicopter lifeline could derail an operation or maneuver, and the need to air-transport men and material to remote locations meant every new arrival of medevac, supply, transport or troop flights gave the VC/NVA yet another opportunity to cripple missions and machines. Helicopters were also very vulnerable to heavy machine guns, light AA artillery, portable SAMs like the Soviet Strela, and even concentrated small arms fire. According to some historians of airpower (Van Creveld 2011), costs were sometimes not commensurate with gains, and US airmobile operations might <b>boil</b> <b>down</b> to hugely expensive machines and their support systems chasing a handful of teenagers or second-string militiamen armed with cheap rifles.|$|E
