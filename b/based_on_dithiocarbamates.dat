40|$|The {{catalytic}} activity {{of a series}} of neutral and cationic, homo- and heteroleptic, mono- and bimetallic palladium(II) compounds <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>dithiocarbamate</b> and dithiooxamide S,S-donor ligands is described. High activity was observed in the regio- and chemo-selective C–H functionalization of benzo[h]quinoline to 10 -alkoxybenzo[h]quinoline and 8 -methylquinoline to 8 -(methoxymethyl) quinoline {{in the presence of the}} oxidant PhI(OAc) 2. The best performance was found for [Pd(Me 2 dazdt) 2]I 6 (Me 2 dazdt = N,N′-dimethyl-perhydrodiazepine- 2, 3 -dithione), [PdI 2 (Me 2 dazdt) ] and [Pd(Cy 2 DTO) 2]I 8 (Cy 2 DTO = N,N′-dicyclohexyl-dithiooxamide) which are all obtained directly as products of sustainable Pd-metal leaching processes used to recover palladium from scrap metal. These compounds provided almost quantitative yields under milder conditions (50 °C, 1 – 3 mol% Pd loading) and much shorter reaction times (1 – 3 h) than reported previously. These results illustrate how the complexes obtained from the selective and sustainable recovery of Pd from automotive heterogeneous Three Way Catalysts (TWC) can be employed directly in homogeneous catalysis, avoiding further metal recovery steps and valorising the metal complex itself in a ‘circular economy’ model...|$|R
40|$|The {{success of}} spin {{trapping}} techniques in vivo hinges on whether spin traps with high trapping efficiency and biocom-patibility can be developed. Currently, two iron chelates <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the <b>dithiocarbamate</b> structure (hydrophilic ferro-di(N-meth-yl-D-glucamine-dithiocarbamate, or Fe(II) -MGD, and lipophilic ferro-di(diethyldithiocarbamate), or Fe(II) -DETC), {{are used for}} spin trapping of nitric oxide (NO) in biologic systems. However, detection efficiency is hampered by a complex redox chemistry for Fe(II) -MGD and by the insolubility of Fe(II) -DETC in water. To circumvent these problems, two new spin trap formulations <b>based</b> <b>on</b> Fe(II) -DETC were developed: a lipid-based carrier system stabilized by lecithin and inclusion complexes in hy-droxypropyl [...] cyclodextrin. The capability of these two sys-tems to trap NO was determined and compared to the standard spin traps in vitro (in {{the presence of an}} NO donor) and in vivo (after induction of septic shock in mice). The sensitivity of the detection of NO was significantly increased (by a factor of 4) using the lipid-based carrier systems or inclusion complexes compared to the standard spin trap agents.

40|$|Contribution {{analysis}} of <b>dithiocarbamates</b> pesticides used <b>on</b> tomatoes treatment has been reported. The study {{is focused on}} analysis and determination of some dithiocarbamates like, Maneb, Mancozeb, Zineb and Propineb, {{in order to achieve}} accurate impact of theses pesticides on water and soil. Analysis method is <b>based</b> <b>on</b> decomposition of <b>dithiocarbamate</b> by heating under acidic attack to give carbon disulfide complexed with copper acetate solution in presence of diethanolamine. Complex formed is dosed spectrophotometrically at 435 nm. Degradation kinetic of dithiocarbamate in aqueous media have been realized and proved that dithiocarbamate are degraded by simple air exposition. In the other hand, pH affects also dithiocarbamate degradation by increasing hydroxyl ions to participate for dithiocarbamate instability. <b>Dithiocarbamate</b> mobility <b>on</b> Moroccan soils samples have been realised and don’t have the same degradation mode...|$|R
40|$|Pesticide misuse {{by farmers}} poses health risks to consumers. This study {{assessed}} {{the level of}} dithiocarbamate residues in tomatoes acquired from 20 farmers and 25 market vendors in Wakiso District, how simple washing affects these residues, and the potential chronic health risk for Ugandans eating such tomatoes. Results revealed that mancozeb was the only reported dithiocarbamate, and 47. 4 % and 14 % of farm and market samples, respectively, had dithiocarbamate residues exceeding the Codex alimentarius maximum residue limit of 2 [*]mgCS 2 /kg. Mixing concentration had a positive significant effect <b>on</b> <b>dithiocarbamate</b> residue levels (P [*]=[*] 0. 004). Washing reduced dithiocarbamate residues {{by a factor of}} 0. 3. Dietary risk assessment revealed no chronic health risk to both children and general population when a national daily per capita consumption of 1. 0 [*]g is considered. This study recommends comprehensive research into Uganda’s food production and consumption patterns and establishment of a national pesticide residue surveillance program...|$|R
