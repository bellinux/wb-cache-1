5|$|In their 2004 {{study of}} lynching, Peter Ehrenhaus and A. Susan Owen compare the lynching to a blood sacrifice, arguing Waco {{residents}} {{felt a sense}} of collective righteousness after Washington's death, as they saw him as the presence of evil in the community. Bernstein compares the public <b>brutality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lynch mob to the medieval English practice of hanging, drawing, and quartering people convicted of high treason.|$|E
5|$|The <b>brutality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spanish American {{dictatorship}} is omnipresent in The Kingdom of This World {{through the}} images of torture, fire, suppression, and hungry dogs for example. Carpentier's characters often find consolation in sexuality (which {{is closely related to}} the sadism of the violence theme) after experiencing violence.|$|E
5|$|In The Disasters of War, Goya {{does not}} excuse any purpose to the random slaughter—the plates are devoid of the {{consolation}} of divine order or the dispensation of human justice. This {{in part a}} result of the absence of melodrama or consciously artful presentation that would distance the viewer from the <b>brutality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subjects, as found in Baroque martyrdom. In addition, Goya refuses to offer the stability of traditional narrative. Instead, his composition tends to highlight the most disturbing aspects of each work.|$|E

This puts pressure on MPI to urgently address abuses such as <b>the</b> maltreatment <b>of</b> bobby calves at the abattoir and to redress regulations. Indeed MPI responded to public concern about <b>the</b> treatment <b>of</b> bobby calves following <b>the</b> release <b>of</b> <b>the</b> footage through prosecuting cases of cruelty where they could and by creating stronger regulations.

5|$|Before {{the end of}} the year, Gaveston had {{returned}} to England, and civil war appeared imminent. In May 1312, Gaveston was taken captive by the Earl of Pembroke, but Warwick and Lancaster had him abducted and executed after a mock trial. This affront to Pembroke’s honour drove him irrevocably into the camp of the king, and thereby split the opposition. The <b>brutality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> act initially drove Lancaster and his adherents away from the centre of power, but the Battle of Bannockburn, in June 1314, returned the initiative. Edward was humiliated by his disastrous defeat, while Lancaster and Warwick had not taken part in the campaign, claiming that it was carried out without the consent of the baronage, and as such in defiance of the Ordinances.|$|E
5|$|Hunting {{dolphins}} (at {{the time}} still often incorrectly {{referred to as}} fish or porpoises), primarily using harpoons and firearms, was considered a form of recreational hunting along {{the shores of the}} Gulf of Mexico in Texas in the late 19th and early 20th century. Pleasure dolphin hunting cruises could be booked in Corpus Christi in the 1920s, with a promise to tourists that if no successful dolphin kill was made, the excursion would be free of charge. The <b>brutality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> practice started to spark animal welfare concerns and there is no reference of this practice still occurring in Texas after the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Jacobite defeat, on 13 February 1692, in an incident known as the Massacre of Glencoe, 38 members of the Clan MacDonald of Glencoe were killed by members of the Earl of Argyll's Regiment of Foot, who had accepted their hospitality, {{on the grounds that they}} had not been prompt in pledging allegiance to the new monarchs. Another forty women and children died of exposure after their homes were burned. The <b>brutality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> incident was embarrassing for the new government and after a subsequent inquiry Dalrymple, who had ordered the massacre, was forced to resign. The massacre helped create greater sympathy for the Stuart cause and may have contributed to later support for Jacobite risings.|$|E
50|$|From his {{beginnings}} in the fin de siècle to {{the period}} after World War II, Beckmann reflected an era of radical changes in both art and history in his work. Many of Beckmann‘s paintings express <b>the</b> agonies <b>of</b> Europe in <b>the</b> first half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20th century. Some of his imagery refers to <b>the</b> decadent glamor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Weimar Republic's cabaret culture, but from the 1930s on, his works often contain mythologized references to <b>the</b> <b>brutalities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nazis. Beyond these immediate concerns, his subjects and symbols assume a larger meaning, voicing universal themes of terror, redemption, and <b>the</b> mysteries <b>of</b> eternity and fate.|$|R

50|$|Father Belo was <b>the</b> choice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Vatican's Pro Nuncio in Jakarta and the Indonesian leaders {{because of}} his {{supposed}} submissiveness, {{but he was not}} <b>the</b> choice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Timorese priests who did not attend his inauguration. However within only five months of his assuming office, he protested vehemently, in a sermon in the cathedral, against <b>the</b> <b>brutalities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kraras massacre (1983) and condemned the many Indonesian arrests. The church was the only institution capable <b>of</b> communicating with <b>the</b> outside world, so with this in mind the new Apostolic Administrator started writing letters and building up overseas contacts, in spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> isolation arising from <b>the</b> opposition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Indonesians and <b>the</b> disinterest <b>of</b> most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world.|$|R
5|$|The Indian Princess is {{one example}} of an attempt by an artist of the early 19th Century to define an American {{national}} identity. Pocahontas, representing the spirit of America, literally shields Smith from injury and serves as foster mother, protecting colonists from famine and attack, achieving mythic status as a heroic mother, and preserving, nurturing and legitimizing America as a country. The play allows for an acknowledgement of the troubling aspects of the nation’s history of conquest, violence, and greed, by couching the negative implications in a romantic plot. In other words, the romantic conquest helps to soften the harshness and <b>brutality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colonial conquest. The success of the play reflects a larger cultural desire to express its sense of self through the Pocahontas myth.|$|E
5|$|The Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company {{was one of}} {{the largest}} users of prison laborers, mostly Blacks convicted of petty crimes, as a method for paying fines. This {{practice}} was common for obtaining coal mining labor in Alabama {{at the close of the}} Reconstruction era. The number of convicts employed increased after U.S. Steel acquired TCI in 1907, as did the <b>brutality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conditions in which they labored. In 1908, the first full year of U. S. Steel's ownership of TCI, almost 60 prison workers died from workplace-related accidents. That same year, the new owners of the company discovered a 400% annual turnover in the workforce.|$|E
5|$|The heavy {{sentence}} aroused strong {{reactions in}} Italy {{and in the}} United States. In Palermo {{a group of students}} went to the Teatro Bellini and asked the orchestra to perform the hymn of Garibaldi. And the theatre applauded. In March 1896, after Crispi had to resign due to the humiliating defeat of the Italian army at Battle of Adwa in Ethiopia during First Italo-Ethiopian War, the new government under Prime minister Antonio Di Rudinì recognized the excessive <b>brutality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> repression. Many Fasci members were pardoned and released from jail. Di Rudinì made it clear though that a reorganization of the Fasci would not be tolerated. After their release, De Felice, Barbato and Bosco were met by a large crowd of supporters in Rome, who released the horses form their carriage and dragged them to the hotel, cheering for socialism and denouncing Crispi.|$|E
5|$|In April 1746, {{the ships}} Mars and Bellona arrived in Scotland with 1,200,000livres (another Spanish instalment, plus a large French supplement). However, on {{learning}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jacobite defeat at <b>the</b> Battle <b>of</b> Culloden on 16 April, the ships left, unloading only the Spanish money at Loch nan Uamh, Arisaig on 30 April (the same place {{from where the}} prince had disembarked the year before, and would later embark for France). Thus, seven caskets of Spanish gold arrived in Scotland. As the Jacobite cause was by then lost, with the army scattered and the prince and his lieutenants in hiding, the money was {{to be used to}} assist the Jacobite clansmen (then being subjected to <b>the</b> <b>brutalities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> government forces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Duke <b>of</b> Cumberland) and to facilitate <b>the</b> escape <b>of</b> leading Jacobites to the continent.|$|R
25|$|In 1938, the {{unemployed}} Oskar Schindler joined the Nazi Party {{and moved to}} Kraków, leaving his wife in Zwittau. There he gained ownership of an enamelware factory that had lain idle and in bankruptcy {{for many years and}} that he renamed Deutsche Emaillewaren-Fabrik, where he principally employed Jewish workers because they were the cheapest. However, he soon realized <b>the</b> true <b>brutalities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nazis, and the Schindlers started protecting his Jewish laborers. Initially, they saved the workers by bribing the SS guards; later, they listed their employees as essential factory workers, manufacturing munitions for the Reich. When conditions worsened and they started running out of money, she sold her jewels to buy food, clothes, and medicine. She looked after sick workers in a secret sanatorium in the factory in Brünnlitz with medical equipment purchased on the black market.|$|R

5|$|Wesley trains under Fox's leadership, {{learning}} endurance, knife {{fighting and}} {{hand to hand}} combat.He also learns to control and use his abilities for firearm marksmanship, including curving bullets around targets. Frustrated by his lack of progress and the <b>brutality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> training, Wesley insists he is ready, but Sloan disagrees. Wesley refocuses on his training and starts to excel. Sloan then shows him the Loom of Fate, which has served for 1,000 years in giving coded names of Fraternity targets through errors in the fabric. The Loom identifies those who will create evil and chaos in the future, with Sloan responsible for interpreting the code.|$|E
5|$|Nefarious {{asserts that}} there is a link between the {{international}} sex industry and legal prostitution in the Western world, and that those who create the demand for forced prostitution around the world are {{of a wide variety of}} ages and are often considered respectable. The film contrasts the secretiveness and <b>brutality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sex industry in Eastern Europe with the openness of public prostitution in the Netherlands. Nefarious suggests that sex trafficking in Southeast Asia is fuelled largely by the complicity of the victims' parents, with many in Cambodia grooming and then knowingly selling their daughters into prostitution to pay for luxury goods. The film asserts that 10% of the population of Moldova has been sexually trafficked. Nefarious contrasts Las Vegas prostitutes with victims of sex trafficking in Europe, depicting the former as drawn into the sex industry by dreams of a glamorous lifestyle, and the latter as made vulnerable by child abandonment and orphanages.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese forces {{landed in}} Labuan on 3 January 1942, during the Second World War, and later invaded {{the rest of}} {{northern}} Borneo. From 1942 to 1945, Japanese forces occupied North Borneo, along {{with most of the}} rest of the island, as part of the Empire of Japan. The British saw Japanese advances in the area as motivated by political and territorial ambitions rather than economic factors. The residing British and native Sabahans reluctantly obeyed and gave in to the <b>brutality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Japanese. The occupation drove many people from coastal towns to the interior, fleeing the Japanese and seeking food. The Malays generally appeared to be favoured by the Japanese, although some of them faced repression, whilst other races such as the Chinese and indigenous peoples were severely repressed. The Chinese were already resisting the Japanese occupation, especially with the Sino-Japanese War in Mainland China. Local Chinese formed a resistance, known as the Kinabalu Guerillas, led by Albert Kwok, with broad support from various ethnic groups in northern Borneo such as Dusun, Murut, Suluk and Illanun peoples. The movement was also supported by Mustapha Harun. Kwok along with many other sympathisers were, however, executed after the Japanese foiled their movement.|$|E
50|$|During her youth, Marjane was {{constantly}} exposed to <b>the</b> growing <b>brutalities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> various regimes. She witnessed many family friends being persecuted, arrested, and even murdered. She found {{a hero in}} her paternal uncle, Anoosh, {{who had been a}} political prisoner and lived in exile in the Soviet Union for a time. Young Marjane adored her uncle and greatly admired him, and he in turn doted on her, treating her as if she was his own daughter. Tragically, as detailed in Satrapi's autobiography, Anoosh was arrested again and executed; his body was buried in an unmarked grave in the prison. Anoosh was only allowed one visitor before his execution, and he requested Marjane. <b>The</b> loss <b>of</b> her uncle left her deeply upset. As a young teen, Marjane began to act out, getting into trouble with the police for breaking modesty codes and buying music banned by the regime.|$|R

5|$|The exiled prisoners from Earth {{form the}} Confederacy of Man in the Koprulu Sector. A de facto plutocracy, the Confederacy's inner {{workings}} are elaborated {{on in the}} novels Liberty's Crusade, Speed of Darkness and Nova. Taking {{the role of the}} primary antagonistic faction in StarCrafts Episode I, the Confederacy is shown as the most powerful faction in the sector at the beginning of StarCraft; in the novels, it is depicted as being brutal towards the public and corrupt at the highest levels on its capital Tarsonis. The player gets to control a division of the Confederate Security Forces in the prequel shareware campaign for StarCraft. Due to the <b>brutality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regime, it is opposed by a variety of rebel groups and is eventually overthrown by the Sons of Korhal. The Sons of Korhal, a rebel group led by Arcturus Mengsk that the player controls during Episode I of StarCraft, form the Terran Dominion to replace the destroyed Confederacy, with the planet Korhal IV as the capital. The Dominion is an autocracy with Mengsk as its emperor. The Dominion's operations are built on in The Dark Templar Saga series of novels. Although Mengsk sees himself as a benevolent dictator, he is shown to be just as harsh as his predecessors.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} steel cage match could be won only by {{climbing}} {{over the top}} of the cage all the way to the floor to win the match. Pinfalls and submission did not count, neither opponent could be disqualified, and the door to the cage would be locked for the entire match. As the cage lowered, Mike Tenay introduced the match and then handed the microphone over to AAA announcer Arturo Rivera to give the introductions in Spanish. Konnan came to the ring with both the IWC World Heavyweight Championship and the UWA Double Power Cup Championship that he had won from Perro Aguayo, although neither was on the line in the match. Once the door was locked, the two wrestlers began to brawl, with Aguayo trying to use Konnan as a ladder to climb out of the cage on more than one occasion. After a few minutes of fighting, Konnan dropped Aguayo face-first on the wire mesh cage, causing Aguayo to bleed (either by sheer impact or Aguayo secretly cutting himself to sell the <b>brutality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> match). Once Aguayo started to bleed, Konnan began to focus on attacking Aguayo's forehead, including rubbing Aguayo's face across the cage. Moments later, both wrestlers found themselves on the top rope, fighting each other as they held on to the cage until Aguayo knocked Konnan off the top rope. Moments later, Aguayo attempted a pinfall even though the rules stated a pinfall did not matter. As the match progressed, sweat began to mix with his blood, causing his face to turn red. As Aguayo tried to climb out of the ring, Konnan leapt up with a low blow to keep his opponent in the cage. At that point, the cameras showed Eddie Guerrero and Madonna's Boyfriend watching the show from backstage, then moments later leaving the backstage area. As Aguayo climbed the cage, Los Gringos came to ringside and threw a cup of liquid in Aguayo's face. He then passed a set of brass knuckles to Konnan to use in the match. While at ringside, Guerrero got into a fistfight with several fans who were upset over his actions, forcing the security guards to step in and stop the fight. Following the assist by Los Gringos Locos, Konnan continued to attack Aguayo, with Aguayo ending up with his face and chest covered in blood from his head wound. At one point, Guerrero attacked the ringside referee, Pepe Casas, preventing him from stepping into the cage to check on Aguayo. When Konnan tried to escape, Los Hermanas Dinamita (Cien Caras, Máscara Año 2000, and Universo 2000) ran to ringside, attacking Guerrero and Madonna's Boyfriend at ringside. As Konnan straddled the cage, Cien Caras climbed up and knocked Konnan off the top and back inside the cage, allowing Aguayo to attack his opponent. Moments later, Aguayo dove off the top rope with a double stomp on Konnan and then climbed out of the cage to victory.|$|E

40|$|In this splendidly edited collection, Helen Winter Stauffer {{presents}} {{more than}} four hundred <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nearly thirty thousand letters that Mari Sandoz wrote between 1926 and 1966, focusing on Sandoz 2 ̆ 7 2 ̆ 2 writing, researching, and publishing 2 ̆ 2 (p. xv). Sandoz 2 ̆ 7 sense {{of herself as a}} western historian dominates the Letters. Her western view embodied a traditional emphasis on <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West, on the masculine and, often, on the heroic; it was overlaid with a Populist 2 ̆ 7 s undying distrust of eastern oppression. But Sandoz also foreshadowed the 2 ̆ 2 new 2 ̆ 2 western history, emphasizing the land itself, its original inhabitants, <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> newcomers, and <b>the</b> tragedies and <b>brutalities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West. The Letters reveal her preoccupation with <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Plains Indians and her concern both with details and with broader issues of interpretation, particularly <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sioux Wars. Sandoz viewed the Plains Indians as dignified and heroic and blamed white settlers for debasing them, partly to justify broken treaties and broken promises.
