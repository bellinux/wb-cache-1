50|$|He {{took part}} in all five Denmark matches at the World Cup, and scored his first goal for Denmark in the game against Nigeria, his own most treasured goal for the {{national}} team. Entering as a substitute, he ran into the blind spot of the defense, had the ball lobbed to him {{over the heads of}} the defenders by Michael Laudrup, before he headed the ball to his right, past the Nigerian Taribo West, and slotted the ball home in the lower left corner. It only took 16 seconds from his substitution to his goal, a World Cup record that still stands. Following his break through on the international stage, he was named Danish Player of the Year. In 1998, Sand was diagnosed with testicular cancer. He had the cancer removed and <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> action <b>just</b> a few weeks after the operation.|$|R
50|$|Sunderland were Stoke's next opponents at the Britannia Stadium for {{an early}} {{kick-off}} at 12.30am. Stoke made an awful start to the match as Kieran Richardson put the Black Cats into the lead after just two minutes. Stoke responded {{half an hour later}} as Carew scored his first goal for the club after Craig Gordon miss timed his punch from a Delap throw. Sunderland <b>were</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> front <b>just</b> after half time after a long ball was not dealt with by the City defence and Gyan put the ball in the net. Stoke pressed for the equaliser as Sunderland defended stubbornly. With seven minutes remaining a free-kick from Pennant found Huth who poked the ball past Gordon and in the final minute of the game another Pennant set piece was converted by Huth to give Stoke a 3-2 victory.|$|R
50|$|Bajrami transitioned from {{full contact}} karate to kickboxing {{under the tutelage}} of fellow karateka-turned-kickboxers Andy Hug and Michael Thompson, and amassed an undefeated record {{fighting}} domestically before being recruited by the world's premier kickboxing promotion, K-1 in 1998. In his promotional debut, Bajrami entered into a one night, eight-man tournament held on May 6, 1998 at K-1 Fight Night '98 in Zurich. He needed an extension round to get past Matteo Minonzie in the quarter-finals, and was then eliminated from the tournament in the semis when his bout with Rob van Esdonk was stopped by the doctor in the first round. The stoppage was controversial as Bajrami claimed to have been hit by an illegal elbow from van Esdonk and refused to return to his feet, prompting the doctor to deem him unable to fight. He <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> action <b>just</b> over a month later when he fought to a five-round draw with Kirkwood Walker at K-1 Dream '98 in Nagoya, Japan on July 17, 1998.|$|R
50|$|Southampton <b>were</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> action <b>just</b> {{three days}} later, {{returning}} to St Mary's {{to try and}} regain their winning ways against Aston Villa. The Saints began {{the game in the}} driving seat as captain Adam Lallana enjoyed numerous goal-scoring chances early on, one of which struck the crossbar; Jay Rodriguez also had a few chances, hitting the post with a long-range effort around 15 minutes. In the 16th minute though, against the run of play, Fabian Delph played a through ball to Gabriel Agbonlahor who beat defenders Maya Yoshida and Dejan Lovren before converting past Paulo Gazzaniga to put Villa one up. The goal saw the momentum switch over to the visitors briefly, but the hosts responded with headed efforts from Jay Rodriguez and Dejan Lovren, and later shots on goal from Luke Shaw and Steven Davis, before Dani Osvaldo was brought on as a tactical attacking replacement for James Ward-Prowse just before half-time.|$|R
50|$|Thomas was not {{selected}} for the next Wales international game, and the Welsh selectors went through three different wings {{in the next four}} games before reselecting Thomas in the final game of the 1890 Home Nations Championship. Played against Ireland at Lansdowne Road, Wales were led by Arthur 'Monkey' Gould in a 3-3 draw. Thomas was replaced for the next game when Percy Lloyd returned, but <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the squad <b>just</b> a game later when Wales faced Scotland as part of the 1891 Championship. Wales suffered an extremely heavy defeat by the Scots, and Thomas was not selected to represent his country again.|$|R

Hatcher was sentenced to two years in the Missouri State Penitentiary. On June 8, 1949, Hatcher was released from prison after serving a little more than half of his time; however, he <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> prison <b>in</b> <b>just</b> a few months, after being convicted of forging a $10 check at a gas station in Maryville, Missouri.

25|$|After {{hitting the}} wall on countless {{occasions}} {{over the previous}} two days, Chen was withdrawn from the race due to a cracked monocoque. Thus, this left the grid at 29 for the 10-lap race, and Vernay got the jump on Ericsson away from the start-finish line, and took the lead into the first corner, {{but by the time}} the drivers had reached Lisboa, Ericsson <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> front <b>just</b> as the safety car came out. Further back, Bianchi rode over the rear wheel of Mortara at San Francisco, causing enough damage for the Frenchman to pit. Rosenzweig collided with the barriers at the Mandarin, which brought the safety car out for three laps. Arundel's Carlin car encountered mechanical troubles under the safety car, after some debris punctured a hole in the radiator of his Volkswagen engine. This left the order as Ericsson, Vernay, Mortara (who moved up despite his collision), Bottas, Ricciardo, Vanthoor, Bird, Coletti, Mäki and Hartley. Boyd moved up five positions at the start, as he was the biggest winner off the line.|$|R
40|$|Differing {{from those}} {{traditional}} vehicle exhaust heat recovery systems which just provided thermal energy directly for cabin warming, integrated Exhaust Energy Recovery (EER) which is researched and developed mainly {{in recent years}} aims to convert exhaust thermal energy to mechanical or electric energy for increasing the total thermal efficiency and the total power of powertrain. In the study presented in this paper, an analytic model was built for examining the environmental and economic benefits of integrated EER systems. Then the improvement on the total powertrain efficiency and net reduction of CO emissions were investigated, {{in terms of the}} average vehicle used in the UK. Results show that, for light duty vehicles fitted with thermal cycle EER system, the cost increase could <b>be</b> paid <b>back</b> <b>in</b> 10. 1 years and CO emission could <b>be</b> paid <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>just</b> 1. 9 years, compared to Hybrid Electric Vehicle's (HEV's) 11. 9 years and 1. 4 years for cost and CO emission, respectively. When the annual fuel price increase is considered, the cost pay-back is reduced to 8. 1 years for EER vehicles and 8. 9 years for HEVs. Higher mileage vehicles will have more obvious advantage for fitting EER system. When doubled annual mileage is considered, EER system can reduce the cost and CO emission pay-back times to 2. 7 years and 0. 6 years, compared to HEV's 8. 5 and 2. 7 years, respectively. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

I won that race - and now he said, if I don't want to come back next year, I have to win on Sunday! So, I have to win tomorrow. For sure, I was not expecting to do a new lap record and a qualifying like that. You need a bit of experience to be fast on this track, but the car was just fantastic. It has a good engine and a good car for the city. I like this track. I push a lot but I also don't take a lot of risks. I really like the city tracks - like Pau and Monaco for example, and I knew that this track would be for me. My Signature team has had good results here, with Edoardo Mortara last year and Nicolas Lapierre in the past. We have a good car, a good engine - in fact a perfect engine for the straights. I was catching Marcus Ericsson, not easily, but I was catching him. I had a good feeling with the car straight away too. I can attack with it - and take no risks. A lot of drivers in qualifying were in the wall because they were at 200 per cent, and me I was just improving my driving lap after lap to take not so many risks. And finally I won. But I don't care if it is the main race or the qualifying race. I was fast today and for sure the aim is to win tomorrow, but we will see what happens. I just take pleasure from it, and we will see."

All this sounds wonderful nothing to it but don 2 ̆ 7 t forget you 2 ̆ 7 ve got a target to hit that is about twenty to forty feet across such as a gun position. Sometimes your [sic] on your target 2 ̆ 6 sometimes your not but you do your damndest for its either you or him.
