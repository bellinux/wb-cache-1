25|$|The Exchange of Princesses {{celebrates the}} double {{marriage}} of the Anna of Austria to Louis XIII of France and Louis XIII's sister, Princess Elisabeth, to future king of Spain, Philip IV on 9 November 1615. France and Spain present the young princesses, {{aided by a}} youth who is probably Hymen. Above them, two putti brandish hymeneal torches, a small zephyr blows a warm breeze of spring and scatter roses, and a circle of joyous butterfly-winged putti surround Felicitas Publica with the caduceus, who showers the couple with gold from her cornucopia. Below, the river Andaye is filled with sea deities come {{to pay homage to}} the brides: the river-god Andaye rests on his urn, a nereid crowned with pearls offers a strand of pearls and coral as wedding gifts, while a triton blows the conch to herald the event. The wedding, which was thought to secure peace between France and Spain, took place on a float midway across the Bidassoa River, along the French-Spanish border. In Ruben's depiction, the princesses stand with their right hands joined between personifications of France and Spain. Spain with a recognizable symbol of a lion on her helmet is on the left, whereas France, with fleur-de-lis decorating her drapery, is on the right. Anna, at age fourteen the older of the two, turns <b>back</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> to take leave of Spain, while France gently pulls her by the left arm. In turn, Spain can be seen taking the thirteen-year-old Elisabeth by her left arm.|$|E
500|$|No tales {{describe}} what form the nuckelavee takes {{when in the}} sea, but its appearance on land has been recounted in graphic detail. An islander, Tammas, claimed to have survived a confrontation with the beast and, after much cajoling from Dennison, reluctantly gave {{his description of the}} monster, the only known first-hand account. According to Tammas, the nuckelavee has a man's torso attached to a horse's <b>back</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it were a rider. The male torso has no legs, but its arms can reach the ground from its position on top of the equine body, the legs of which have fin like appendages. The torso has a large head– possibly as much as [...] in diameter– that rolls back and forth. The monster described by Tammas has two heads; the equine head has an enormous gaping mouth that exudes a smelly toxic vapour, and a single giant eye like a burning red flame. A particularly gruesome detail is that the nuckelavee has no skin; black blood courses through yellow veins, and the pale sinews and powerful muscles are visible as a pulsating mass. Other reports state that the creature resembles a centaur; narratives are inconsistent in the finer details of the demon's description however. Traill Dennison only describes a man's head with a [...] "mouth projected like that of a pig". Marwick also only mentions one head with a single red eye, and he borrows some of Tammas's characterisation by recording the creature's mouth as [...] "like a whale's".|$|E

60|$|In another {{building}} {{they showed}} us a fresco representing some lions and other beasts drawing chariots; {{and they seemed}} to project so far from the wall that we took them to be sculptures. The artist had shrewdly heightened the delusion by painting dust on the creatures' <b>backs,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it had fallen there naturally and properly. Smart fellow--if it be smart to deceive strangers.|$|R
2500|$|If {{this threat}} display fails to deter a would-be predator, Heterodon species often roll onto {{their backs and}} play dead, {{going so far as}} to emit a foul musk and fecal matter from their cloaca and let their tongues hang out of their mouth, {{sometimes}} accompanied by small droplets of blood. If they are rolled upright while in this state, they will often roll <b>back</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> insisting they really are dead. [...] It has been observed that the snake, while appearing to be dead, will still watch the threat that caused the death pose. The snake will 'resurrect' sooner if the threat is looking away from it than if the threat is looking at the snake.|$|E
2500|$|On {{commission}} from Catherine, Germain Pilon carved {{the marble}} sculpture that contains Henry II's heart. The Florentine Domenico del Barbiere, {{who had worked}} at Fontainebleau, carved the base. Pilon's fluid style echoes Primaticcio's stucco work at Fontainebleau. The piece {{may also have been}} influenced by Pierre Bontemps's monument for the heart of Francis I. Pilon set the bronze urn on the heads of the Three Graces, who are poised back to <b>back,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> to dance. He may have based the design on that for an incense burner for Francis I, engraved by Marcantonio. Pilon's figures, however, with their long necks and small heads, are more like nymphs. A poem by Ronsard is engraved {{at the foot of the}} sculpture. It asks the reader not to wonder that so small a vase can hold so large a heart, since Henry's real heart resides in Catherine's breast. Henri Zerner has called the monument, which can be seen at the Louvre, [...] "one of the summits of our sculpture".|$|E
2500|$|Plot outline: Sinister has {{allegedly}} awakened in (and escaped from) the morgue, {{and enters}} the Morlock tunnels to finish what he started: to release Apocalypse by killing more innocent mutants. [...] The X-Men and Morlocks attempt to stop him, but Bishop manipulates his efforts, helping him succeed. [...] Angel is the last mutant to be killed, and Wolverine kills Bishop for aiding Sinister. [...] Sinister transforms into Apocalypse and launches {{an attack on the}} city, inciting mutants in the area to fight each other. [...] Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four arrive, but they do not manage to resolve the situation, which is further compounded when Professor X and Cable arrive from the future wearing armor (resembling Onslaught and Stryfe) and attempt to override Apocalypse's mind control. [...] They are outmatched until Jean Grey unleashes the Phoenix, who makes easy work of Apocalypse. [...] At the conclusion, the Phoenix and Jean have merged into one being and proclaim that there are [...] "many things I must do." [...] Then, in a flash, the world is changed <b>back,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the battle never happened.|$|E

6000|$|To {{describe}} the indignation of Captain Dunning {{and his men}} on witnessing this act is impossible. The former roared rather than shouted, [...] "Give way, lads!" [...] and the latter bent their <b>backs</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they meant to pull the boat bodily out of the water, and up into the atmosphere. Meanwhile all the other boats were in hot pursuit of the second whale, which had led them a considerable distance away from the first.|$|R
2500|$|During the band's early years, {{despite being}} the singer, bassist and chief songwriter, Lynott was still fairly {{reserved}} and introverted on stage, and would stand {{to one side}} while the spotlight concentrated on Bell, who was initially regarded as the group's leader. During the recording of the band's second album, Shades of a Blue Orphanage (1972), Lynott very nearly left Thin Lizzy {{to form a new}} band with Deep Purple's Ritchie Blackmore and Ian Paice, called Baby Face. [...] "Ritchie turned up in the studio one day to jam," [...] recalled Brian Downey. [...] "I was asked to play drums to Phil and Ritchie jamming… Me and Eric looked at each other like, 'Well, that's the end of the band then.' It lasted a week, then Phil came <b>back</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> nothing had happened. He wanted to be the leader of his own band, not the singer in someone else's." [...] Due to being in dire financial straits, Lizzy did, however, soon record an album of Deep Purple covers under the name Funky Junction. Lynott did not sing on the album as he felt his voice was not in the same style as Ian Gillan.|$|E
2500|$|After {{rounding}} {{the tip of}} South America in early February, Moitessier had made a dramatic decision in March {{to drop out of}} the race and to sail on towards Tahiti. On 22 April 1969, Robin Knox-Johnston was the first to complete the race, leaving Crowhurst supposedly in the running against Tetley for second to finish, and possibly still able to beat Knox-Johnston's time, due to his later starting date. In reality, Tetley was far in the lead, having long ago passed within [...] of Crowhurst's hiding place; but believing himself to be running neck-and neck with Crowhurst, Tetley pushed his failing boat, also a [...] Piver trimaran, to the breaking point, and had to abandon ship on 30 May. [...] The pressure on Crowhurst had therefore increased, since he now looked certain to win the [...] "elapsed time" [...] race. If he appeared to have completed the fastest circumnavigation, his log books would be closely examined by experienced sailors, including the experienced and sceptical Chichester, and the deception would probably be exposed. It is also likely that he felt guilty about undermining Tetley's genuine circumnavigation so near its completion. He had by this time begun to make his way <b>back</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he had rounded Cape Horn.|$|E
2500|$|A {{standing}} back handspring {{begins with}} a three phase sequence known as [...] "up, sit, jump". In the up phase, the gymnast stands up straight on flat feet, with arms in front at an angle slightly above horizontal. In the sit phase, the gymnast swings the arms down by {{the sides of the}} torso, bends knees, and sits <b>back</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> sitting in a chair; while in this position, the gymnast is unbalanced. Together, the sit and jump phases impart angular momentum to the body, causing it to rotate. In the jump phase, the gymnast swings both arms up by the ears and jumps into the air while transitioning to an arch position, with the head in a neutral position, arms and legs straight, and feet together; this body shape is maintained until the hands contact the floor. With hands on the floor, the body's angular momentum is used to transform the gymnast's body shape from an arch, through a linear shape, to a [...] "hollow" [...] shape. The hands are then pushed against the floor, causing the body to lift off from the floor while the body continues its feet-first rotation. Finally, the feet land on the floor, behind the body's center of gravity, and the remaining angular momentum is depleted as it carries the gymnast to a stationary standing position.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a series}} of unusual loyalty tests over the next months, Sting would confront a WCW wrestler in the ring and shove the wrestler several times with his bat until the wrestler was {{provoked}} enough to advance on him. Then Sting would draw the weapon <b>back</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{he were going to}} assault him, causing the wrestler to stop. Sting would hand the bat to the offended wrestler and turn his back, offering the wrestler a chance at retaliation. When the wrestler hesitated or declined, Sting would nod, retrieve the bat and leave the ring. In January 1997, a [...] "blackballed" [...] Randy Savage returned to WCW {{for the first time since}} Halloween Havoc and aligned himself with Sting as a [...] "free agent" [...] as he refused to join the nWo although WCW Vice President Eric Bischoff, also one of the leaders of the nWo, declared he would not be allowed back in WCW if he didn't. For the next few weeks the two were seen in the rafters together and coming to the ring together. This story, however, petered out at SuperBrawl in February; Sting and Savage had come to the ring together to watch Roddy Piper face Hogan in a match for the WCW world title. As Sting left, Savage went to the ring and helped Hogan win the match, thus going back on his word and joining the nWo. Over the next couple weeks, Sting would accompany the nWo, indicating that he too joined the group. However, at WCW Uncensored in March 1997, as the nWo celebrated a victory in the main event battle royal which guaranteed them title shots whenever they desired with their newest recruit, Chicago Bulls NBA star Dennis Rodman, Sting rappelled from the roof of the arena on a vertical zip-line. When Hall and Nash went to approach him, Sting attacked them and Randy Savage when he tried to intervene, revealing his allegiance to WCW.|$|E
