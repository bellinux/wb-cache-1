5|$|Scully accompanies Skinner as he {{is being}} transported in an ambulance. When Cardinal {{attempts}} to break in, she tracks him down and arrests him. Cardinal tells her that Krycek is headed to an abandoned missile silo in Black Crow, North Dakota. There, the agents are captured by the Smoking Man's men and are escorted away. Deep inside, Krycek sits atop the UFO and coughs out the black oil, which seeps into the ship. Skinner recovers and returns to work. Mulder sees Scully at Melissa's grave, explaining that Cardinal {{was found dead in}} his cell. Meanwhile, Krycek is trapped within the silo, <b>banging</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> door in an attempt to be let out.|$|E

25|$|Boro's defense {{remained}} solid when Wigan {{came to the}} Riverside Stadium, {{but continued}} to struggle in attack. A line-up unchanged from the midweek FA Cup draw with West Ham was forced into a change midway through the first half. Summer departure Lee Cattermole's strong-but-fair challenge on Didier Digard forced the midfielder off with injuries to both legs that would likely rule him out {{for the remainder of}} the season. Neither side could muster enough chances for a goal and the game ended 0–0. Middlesbrough's dire run stretched to fourteen games without a win, with only one goal in nine games. A letter from the club's Safety Officer, Sue Watson, was handed out to supporters in block 53A. It was intended to ask supporters to refrain from constantly standing and to stop <b>banging</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> plastic sheeting on the back of the stand, but its bad wording caused much anger among fans who interpreted it as asking them to sit down and be quiet. The club was forced to apologise to the fans and clarify the confusion.|$|E

500|$|At 11:30am on 18October1968, {{the flat}} was raided by Sgt. Norman Pilcher, of Scotland Yard's Drugs Squad. In 1974, Lennon remembered that Ono {{answered}} {{the front door}} as a female voice had said (over the intercom), {{that there was a}} message from the Apple office. Ono opened the door and saw the female with five men, who were all dressed in plain-clothes. She panicked and closed the door, thinking they were Beatles' fans. Meanwhile, at the back window, another person was <b>banging</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> window and holding up a search warrant for Lennon to read. As Lennon was also panicking—not knowing at that point that they were all police officers—the raid consisted of seven police officers and two police dogs—he played for time and refused to open the window. Because of this, Pilcher later accused Lennon of obstruction of justice, which was a crime. Inside the flat, the police searched every room thoroughly, even though Lennon was supposed to accompany them whilst they did so, according to the law. Pilcher then summoned Lennon and pointed to a binocular case on a mantelpiece, asking him, [...] "Is this yours?" [...] Lennon replied in the affirmative, and was then shown 219grams of hashish, which was in the case.|$|E
500|$|... "Love Machine" [...] {{was written}} by Miranda Cooper, Brian Higgins, Tim Powell, Nick Coler, Lisa Cowling, Myra Boyle, Shawn Lee. They came up {{with some of the}} song's lyrics by singing [...] "nonsense lyrics" [...] over a backing track, which {{eventually}} evolved into real songwords. The instrumentation track was inspired by The Smiths, and created by Powell and Coler. It is a pop rock and teen pop written in C major with a time signature in common time and a tempo of 88 beats per minute. The vocal range from the band members spans from F3 to B4. An early demo of [...] "Love Machine" [...] was included on the compilation album , and later on an official Girls Aloud singles boxset; this version was sung by band members Cheryl Cole, Nadine Coyle and Sarah Harding only, and featured radically different lyrics from the released version, even excluding the phrase [...] "Love Machine". One of the song's lyrics, [...] "What will the neighbours say / This time?" [...] inspired the album's title, and it is a reference to Girls Aloud's debut single, where Cole sings, [...] "Neighbours <b>banging</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bathroom wall". MusicOMH contributor John Murphy noted the track uses [...] "a guitar line that sounds like it's been nicked from an old rockabilly tune", and compared its composition to other [...] "'80s synth pop songs." ...|$|E
500|$|Gates {{maintained}} a {{suite at the}} Waldorf-Astoria of New City from 1894 onwards. Though he paid US$30,000 yearly for it, his visits pained the hotel's manager, George Boldt, at times. [...] Gates and his guests were often loud and boisterous. [...] He had a private entrance and elevator, but Gates {{had a habit of}} <b>banging</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> elevator doors and shouting for service. Boldt instructed his elevator operators to take their time when serving his floor, as it allowed Gates to make as much noise as he wished for a few minutes. Gates' suite was often home to high-stakes poker parties and Baccarat games. Many poker games began on the train from Chicago to New York and were continued at the Waldorf. One poker game lasted for five days and nights; when it was done at least US$2 million had changed hands. Dellora Gates had long since resigned herself to her husband's all-night poker games, but many times became upset about them. [...] Gates made it a practice to keep some unset diamonds in his vest pocket for the times when Dellora became angry about the late hours at cards. He would then present a gem to his wife, who would suddenly forget her anger with him. [...] Dellora would take the diamond to Tiffany & Co. to be set in a piece of jewelry of her choice.|$|E

500|$|Concerning the {{recording}} of the album's opening song [...] "N.Y. State of Mind", producer DJ Premier later stated [...] "Nas — he's one of our saviors now. When we did ‘N.Y. State of Mind,’ at the beginning when he says, ‘Straight out the dungeons of rap / Where fake niggas don’t make it back,’ then you hear him say, ‘I don’t know how to start this shit,’ ’cause he had just written it. He's got the beat running in the studio, but he doesn’t know how he's going to format how he's going to convey it. So he's going, ‘I don’t know how to start this shit,’ and I’m counting him in [...] One, two, three. And then you can hear him go, ‘Yo,’ and then he goes right into it." [...] DJ Premier later discussed the unexpectedness of Nas's delivery during {{the recording}}, stating [...] "He didn’t know how he was gonna come in, but he just started going because we were recording. I’m actually yelling, ‘We’re recording!’ and <b>banging</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> [...] window. ‘Come on, get ready!’ You hear him start the shit: Rappers…. And then everyone in the studio was like, ‘Oh, my God’, ’cause it was so unexpected. He was not ready. So we used that first verse. And {{that was when he}} was up and coming, his first album. So we was like, 'Yo, this guy is gonna be big.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The episode's {{title is}} {{a play on}} the 1928 D. H. Lawrence novel Lady Chatterley's Lover. Grampa is hassled twice by lawyers {{representing}} the estates of deceased entertainers: the first time representing Charlie Chaplin, for his [...] "unauthorized imitation" [...] of the bread roll dancing scene from the 1925 silent film The Gold Rush, and {{the second time he}} is approached by them is after imitating Jimmy Durante. Grampa <b>banging</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> church window while shouting [...] "Mrs. Bouvier!", and the subsequent getaway on the bus, are references to the film The Graduate, as is the closing song, a parody of [...] "The Sound of Silence" [...] by Simon and Garfunkel. Mrs. Bouvier says her friends, Zelda Fitzgerald, Frances Farmer and Sylvia Plath, were jealous of her good looks and it drove them crazy. All three women were known for having been institutionalized, Fitzgerald and Farmer for schizophrenia and Plath for a breakdown that resulted in suicide. Mrs. Bouvier's favorite tune—played during the dance at the Springfield Community Center and later by Grampa at the wedding—is Glenn Miller's song [...] "Moonlight Serenade". The swing tune played during Mrs. Bouvier and Mr. Burns's dance is the 1936 song [...] "Sing, Sing, Sing", written by Louis Prima and performed by Benny Goodman. Bart and Lisa sing the 1980s advertising jingle used for Armour and Company's brand of hot dogs. Everyone then sings the advertising jingle for Chicken Tonight, complete with chicken dance moves.|$|E
500|$|When {{the filmmakers}} were {{dissatisfied}} with the initial drafts of episodes, specifically with the evolution of characters, they would rewrite events, or add scenes to re-establish the original vision. The character of Earl Jenkins (Tony Todd), {{intended to be a}} sympathetic villain, came across as [...] "completely unlikable" [...] in the original draft of [...] "Jitters". The character suffers from over-exposure to kryptonite, causing massive seizures; if Jenkins happened to grab someone, they could be shaken to death. Originally, the character is first seen <b>banging</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> door of LuthorCorp and killing a security guard during one of his seizures. To present a more favorable aspect to the audience, a scene in which Earl visits his infant child was added to show that he was not a [...] "raving maniac". Similar rewrites occurred with the characters Ryan James (Ryan Kelley) in [...] "Stray" [...] and Tyler Randall (Reynaldo Rosales) in [...] "Reaper". In the original draft of [...] "Stray", Ryan developed his telepathic abilities from exposure to kryptonite.; to emphasize the show was not always about kryptonite-infected villains, the story was revised so that Ryan had his ability from birth. The network also expressed dissatisfaction with Ryan as a murderer, so the character was rewritten to be the [...] "nice kid". The character of Tyler Randall shared Earl Jenkins's issue: he was not sympathetic enough in the filmmakers' eyes; intended to be an escaped prisoner, he was rewritten to be [...] "the world's deadliest nice guy".|$|E
