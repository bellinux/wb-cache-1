5|$|As {{early as}} the 18th century, some {{scientists}} had made correct hypotheses as to comets' physical composition. In 1755, Immanuel Kant hypothesized that comets are composed of some volatile substance, whose vaporization gives rise to their brilliant displays near perihelion. In 1836, the German mathematician Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel, after observing streams of vapor during the appearance of Halley's Comet in 1835, proposed that the jet forces of evaporating material could <b>be</b> <b>great</b> enough to significantly alter a comet's orbit, and {{he argued that the}} non-gravitational movements of Encke's Comet resulted from this phenomenon.|$|E

5|$|Halley's {{periodic}} returns {{have been}} subject to scientific investigation since the 16th century. The three apparitions from 1531 to 1682 were noted by Edmond Halley, enabling him to predict its 1759 return. Streams of vapour observed during the comet's 1835 apparition prompted astronomer Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel to propose that the jet forces of evaporating material could <b>be</b> <b>great</b> enough to significantly alter a comet's orbit.|$|E

5|$|By now the Ottomans had {{essentially}} won the war; Byzantium {{was reduced}} to a few settlements other than Constantinople and was forced to recognize its vassal status to the Ottoman Sultan. This vassalage continued until 1394. However, whilst Constantinople had been neutralized, the surrounding Christian powers were still a threat to the Ottomans and Asia Minor was not under complete Ottoman control. The Ottomans continued their thrust into the Balkans, proving to <b>be</b> <b>great</b> conquerors in Europe as they were in Anatolia; in 1385 Sofia was captured from the Bulgarians and Niš was taken the following year. Other smaller states were subjugated as vassals, including the Serbs. Serbian resistance was crushed at the Battle of Kosovo in 1389, much of Bulgaria was taken in 1393 by Bayezid I (the Thunderbolt) and in 1396 the last bastion of Bulgarian independence was wiped out when Vdiin fell.|$|E

5|$|Helicoverpa zea {{has a wide}} host range, attacking {{vegetables}} that include corn, tomato, artichoke, asparagus, cabbage, cantaloupe, collards, cowpea, cucumber, eggplant, lettuce, lima bean, melon, okra, pea, pepper, potato, pumpkin, snap bean, spinach, squash, sweet potato, and watermelon. However, {{not all of these}} are good hosts. While corn and lettuce are shown to <b>be</b> <b>great</b> hosts, tomatoes are less beneficial, and broccoli and cantaloupe are poor hosts. Corn and sorghum are most favored by corn earworms. Various signs reveal the presence of these moths. Young maize crops have holes in their leaves, following whorl-feeding on the apical leaf. Eggs can be found on silks on larger plants, and silks display grazing evidence. The soft, milky grains in the top few centimeters of corn cobs are eaten as the corn ears develop. One larva per cob can be observed. Bore holes are observed in cabbage and lettuce hearts, flower heads, cotton bolls, and tomato fruits. Sorghum heads are grazed, and legume pod seeds are eaten.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare {{kinematics}} and muscle activity between chin-ups and lat-pull down exercises and between muscle groups during the two exercises. Normalized electromyography (EMG) of biceps brachii (BB), triceps brachii (TB), pectoralis major (PM), latissimus dorsi (LD), rectus abdominus (RA), and erector spinae (ES) and kinematics of back, shoulder, and seventh cervical vertebrae (C 7) was analysed during chin-ups and lat-pull down exercises. Normalized EMG of BB and ES and kinematics of shoulder and C 7 for chin-ups <b>were</b> <b>greater</b> than lat-pull down exercises during the concentric phase (p < 0. 05). For the eccentric phase, RA during lat-pull down exercises <b>was</b> <b>greater</b> than chin-ups and the kinematics of C 7 during chin-ups <b>was</b> <b>greater</b> than lat-pull down exercises (p < 0. 05). For chin-ups, BB, LD, and ES <b>were</b> <b>greater</b> than PM during the concentric phase, whereas BB and LD <b>were</b> <b>greater</b> than TB, and LD <b>was</b> <b>greater</b> than RA during the eccentric phase (p < 0. 05). For lat-pull down exercise, BB and LD <b>were</b> <b>greater</b> than PM, TB, and ES during the concentric phase, whereas LD <b>was</b> <b>greater</b> than PM, TB, and BB during the eccentric phase (p < 0. 05).
