Meanwhile, Sharon left Tasa and headed for Suez City, leaving a single reconnaissance company to hold vital ridges such as Hamadia and Kishuf, but not the hills to the north, such as Hamutal. Instead, Keren's brigade gained responsibility for these areas, but Sharon's action further endangered Adan's position.|$|E

In contrast, a priestess-type companion might support the player character by casting beneficial spells, while a paladin-type would give support <b>by</b> <b>attacking</b> the player character's target, and then healing the protagonist after the battle or if he or she came close to dying.|$|E
