5|$|By {{the time}} Channon reached the two platoons, they were {{crossing}} over two small hills {{just north of}} Kantongyon. As they crossed {{over one of the}} hills, Channon and his radio operator were wounded by Chinese mortar rounds. Channon took the radio from Walker, who was now incapacitated, and joined the two platoons {{at the bottom of the}} hill. Channon then called Jess Tidwell for instructions, who responded, “move out when the tanks move out.” Two tanks had passed through a gap in the hills and were in front of them. Soon, the two tanks moved out at high speed to join their company in the center of the valley. As the Rangers started to move forward, toward the nose of a ridge from which the fire was coming about 700-800 yards ahead, they began taking casualties from machine gun and rifle fire. About 100 yards out from the ridge, they received a heavy mortar barrage, resulting in a number of them being wounded. Channon also received a couple of burp gun rounds to his lower left leg. Shortly after, a couple of light tanks arrived. Pete Hamilton (1st Plt Ldr) and Channon crawled up on the tanks, <b>bore-sighted</b> the guns on the machine guns and blew them away. About 30 yards out from a Chinese trench at the base of the ridge nose, they received a heavy volley of grenades. Abandoning protocol (once you start a charge, you are not supposed to hit the ground), Channon, knowing that he’d have no trouble getting his Rangers up again, had them hit the ground. When they got up, the Rangers took the ridge nose in a bayonet and grenade fight. When their position was secure, Platoon Sergeant Barber reported that they only had eight Rangers capable of continuing on. Pete Hamilton had been too seriously wounded to continue.|$|E
2500|$|Because the gun's recoil {{forces could}} push the entire plane off target during firing, the weapon itself is mounted {{laterally}} off-center, {{slightly to the}} port side of the fuselage centerline, with the actively [...] "firing" [...] barrel in the nine o'clock position (when viewed {{from the front of}} the aircraft), so that the firing barrel lies directly on the aircraft's centerline. The firing barrel also lies just below the aircraft's center of gravity, being <b>bore-sighted</b> along a line 2 degrees below the aircraft's line of flight. This arrangement accurately centers the recoil forces, preventing changes in aircraft pitch or yaw when fired. This configuration also leaves space for the front landing gear, which is mounted slightly off-center on the starboard side of the nose.|$|E
50|$|No {{matter which}} method of bore {{sighting}} is used, {{the result is}} to align the cross-hairs of the scope {{to the spot where}} the barrel is pointing at a particular distance. Because of variations in the trajectory of ammunition and other factors the <b>bore-sighted</b> rifle will probably not shoot to the exact spot that the cross-hairs indicate, and live ammunition will need to be fired to fine-tune the sighting process.|$|E
5000|$|The wing guns in {{fighters were}} {{typically}} not <b>bore-sighted</b> to point straight ahead; instead they were aimed slightly inward {{so that the}} projectiles met at one or more areas several hundred yards or metres {{in front of the}} fighter's nose. The intent was either to spread the fire of multiple weapons to increase the chance of a hit, called [...] "pattern harmonisation", or to concentrate the fire to deliver greater damage at one point, called [...] "point harmonisation".|$|E
50|$|TAUVEX {{consists}} of three <b>bore-sighted</b> 20 cm diameter telescopes on a single bezel, called telescopes A, B, and C. Each telescope images the same sky area of 0.9 degree, with an angular resolution of 7-11 arcseconds. The imaging is onto position-sensitive detectors (CsTe cathodes on calcium fluoride windows) equipped with multi-channel plate electron intensifiers. The detectors oversample the point-spread-function {{by a factor of}} approximately three. The output is detected by position-sensitive anodes (wedge-and-strip) and is digitized to 12 bits. The full image of each telescope has about 300 resolution elements across its diameter.|$|E
50|$|The Tel Aviv University Ultraviolet Explorer (TAUVEX) is a space {{telescope}} array conceived by Noah Brosch of Tel Aviv University. It was eventually designed and constructed for the University by El-Op. TAUVEX is {{a cluster of}} three <b>bore-sighted</b> 20-cm telescopes for observation in the ultra-violet funded by the Israel Space Agency. It was due to be launched by India on board the ISRO satellite GSAT-4 satellite but due to a mis-match between {{the capabilities of the}} launched and the mass of the satellite, ISRO decided unilaterally to remove TAUVEX from GSAT-4. The telescope ended up in a limbo of constant delays. In 2012 ISA decided to terminate the TAUVEX project.|$|E
5000|$|Based on {{the same}} {{principles}} as the Remington 700 series, the Model 710 uses a centerfire bolt action cartridge, a 3 lug bolt system {{as opposed to the}} Remington 700's dual opposed locking lugs, with a 4 round detachable magazine (or a 3 round for the 7 mm Remington Magnum and the [...]300 Winchester Magnum). All can be equipped with a bipod and sling, and comes equipped with a gray or olive drab rugged all-weather synthetic stock, and a mounted Bushnell Sharpshooter, 3-9 × 40 scope which is <b>bore-sighted</b> from the factory. The Remington 710 is a moderately priced rifle. With the synthetic stock and the already mounted scope, it makes an adequate rifle for the novice shooter or hunter.|$|E

50|$|In {{its basic}} {{infantry}} form, the system comprises a missile {{in a sealed}} tube which is inserted into a launch tube prior to use. When the target is sighted and the missile is fired, the launch motor fires through the rear nozzle propelling the missile from the tube. As the missile exits the launch tube first four wings just forward of the flight motor spring open forwards followed by four tail control surfaces which flip open rearwards as the missile completely exits the launch tube. At approximately 50-65 meters downrange the flight motor ignites and boosts the missile's speed to approximately 600 miles per hour (or 1000 kilometers per hour). IR sensors <b>bore-sighted</b> to the optical sight continuously monitor {{the position of a}} IR source on the missile relative to the line-of-sight, and generates error signals which are sent via the command link to the missile's integral guidance unit. The missile's guidance unit then corrects the trajectory of the missile via the control surface actuators.|$|E
50|$|The Mariner 8 {{spacecraft}} {{was built}} on an octagonal magnesium frame, 45.7 cm deep and 138.4 cm across a diagonal. Four solar panels, each 215 x 90 cm, extended out {{from the top of}} the frame. Each set of two solar panels spanned 6.89 meters from tip to tip. Also mounted on the top of the frame were two propulsion tanks, the maneuver engine, a 1.44 m long low gain antenna mast and a parabolic high gain antenna. A scan platform was mounted on the bottom of the frame, on which were attached the mutually <b>bore-sighted</b> science instruments (wide- and narrow-angle TV cameras, infrared radiometer, ultraviolet spectrometer, and infrared interferometer spectrometer). The overall height of the spacecraft was 2.28 m. The launch mass was 997.9 kg, of which 439.1 kg were expendables. The science instrumentation had a total mass of 63.1 kg. The electronics for communications and command and control were housed within the frame.|$|E
5000|$|A {{very close}} {{convergence}} point proved devastatingly effective for some pilots. The highest scoring fighter {{pilot in the}} world, German Major Erich Hartmann, set the wing guns (later cannon) of his Bf 109 to converge at 50 m because of his preference for waiting to attack until very near his opponent. In the Pacific War in mid-1943, American Marine Fighting Squadron 213 harmonised the six [...]50 inch wing guns of their Mk I Vought F4U Corsairs to converge to a point 300 ft ahead. The squadron's usual tactic was to dive upon an enemy from the front and slightly to one side (a high-side attack using full deflection) and fire when at the convergence distance. American ace Major Bill Chick of the 317th Fighter Squadron based in North Africa in January 1944 <b>bore-sighted</b> the guns of his Thunderbolt to converge at 300 ft {{because he did not}} care for deflection shots and instead attacked his targets from the rear at that distance.|$|E
5000|$|The {{science of}} TAUVEX {{is based on}} its unique characteristics: three <b>bore-sighted</b> and {{independent}} telescopes able to operate independently, with different filters but measuring the same sources, and reasonably fine time resolution as every detected photon is time-tagged. A unique possibility allows {{the study of the}} interstellar dust band at 217.4 nm; the two TAUVEX filters SF2 and NBF3 are centered on this wavelength but have different widths. As the filters are located on different telescopes, it is possible to measure the same sky region with both filters simultaneously, deriving the equivalent width of the band for every star in the field of view. The use of TAUVEX as a scientific instrument is the result of calibration on the ground [...] This calibration was very difficult and produced unreliable results possibly indicating a significantly reduced performance. Given the uncertain results, the Principal Investigators planned to repeat and improve the calibration in space, in the months following the launch.|$|E
5000|$|The {{successful}} {{invasion of}} Luzon by the Japanese Imperial Army in late December 1941 quickly brought land forces {{within range of}} Fort Drum and the other Manila Bay forts. Just before the outbreak {{of war in the}} Pacific on December 7, 1941, Fort Drum had been restaffed with men and officers of the 59th Coast Artillery Regiment (E Battery). The wooden barracks located on the fort's deck were dismantled to provide an unobstructed field of fire for Battery Wilson. On January 2, 1942, Fort Drum withstood heavy Japanese air bombardment. On January 12, 1942, a Model 1906 3 in seacoast gun with a pedestal mount was installed at Fort Drum to help protect the fort's vulnerable [...] "stern" [...] section from attack, and it was dubbed as Battery Hoyle. The very next day on January 13, before the concrete emplacement was fully dry and the gun had been <b>bore-sighted</b> or checked for assurance level, it became the first American battery of seacoast artillery to open fire on the enemy in World War II when it drove off a Japanese-commandeered inter-island steamer apparently bent on a close inspection of Fort Drum's vulnerable rear approach. Until that time, the cage mast control tower masked the fire of the rear main turret, while the height of the gun above water created a dead space even had the field of fire been clear.|$|E
50|$|The 3rd Ranger Company entered {{action on}} 11 April, {{part of a}} tank-infantry task force {{conducting}} aggressive reconnaissance in a wide valley near the river. Encountering a village, the 3rd Platoon cleared the village and killed two Chinese stragglers. After the lead elements of the tank company and the 3rd Platoon had taken the Kantongyon village, the tank company commander wanted to move his company west {{into the center of}} the valley before continuing north. Captain and now Executive Officer, Bob Channon was near the rear of the company column. CO, Jess Tidwell, riding with the tank Co, called Channon on the radio and instructed him to come up and take control of the 1st and 2nd Platoons.By the time Channon reached the two platoons, they were crossing over two small hills just north of Kantongyon. As they crossed over one of the hills, Channon and his radio operator were wounded by Chinese mortar rounds. Channon took the radio from Walker, who was now incapacitated, and joined the two platoons at the bottom of the hill. Channon then called Jess Tidwell for instructions, who responded, “move out when the tanks move out.” Two tanks had passed through a gap in the hills and were in front of them.

When their position was secure, Platoon Sergeant Barber reported that they only had eight Rangers capable of continuing on. Pete Hamilton had been too seriously wounded to continue.Channon called Tidwell for instructions and was instructed to join the tanks and the 3rd Platoon in the center of the valley. The 2nd Platoon had been supporting the 1st Platoon with enfilade fire on the hill from their left flank. Channon put the 2nd Platoon in the lead, followed by the remnant of the 1st Platoon. The tanks and the 3rd Platoon had moved up the center of the wide valley and were more than a thousand yards to the northwest. Fortunately, after about 300 yards of sniper fire from higher on the ridge to their right, they were able to gain cover from a 3-4 foot field dyke, and then joined the 3rd Platoon in the center of the valley. Channon moved the company up around the tanks on a small hill ahead. The tank company commander then moved the tanks up to the final objective for the day about 300-400 yards ahead. Jess Tildwell was with him, so Channon brought the company up to that small hill and got it organized. Bob Scully, Channon's third radio operator for the day, was wounded when a mortar round hit. Jess Tildwell had Channon get on a tank with other wounded for the trip back to clearing station.On the way back Channon noticed that there was more than a two thousand yard gap before they saw any fighting elements. So before continuing on, he had a jeep take him to the tank battalion CP. He strongly suggested the gap be closed before dark, which was done and 3rd Company was replaced on line. In addition to those wounded who were able to continue on, four Rangers were killed along with 25 wounded and evacuated in this first engagement.|$|E

The current rover is capable of semi-autonomously navigating to, and gathering multi-modal science data from widely dispersed rock-soil targets of interest. Commands are input to FIDO through a high-level "web" interface enabling geographically distributed and collaborative science planning, sequencing and data analysis. The rover carries a diverse instrument suite: a mastmounted panoramic science camera, navigational camera, and <b>bore-sighted</b> infrared point spectrometer, also, a front-mounted robot arm with multiple affixed smaller instruments, one being a color micro-imager.

40|$|The {{nighttime}} {{lunar surface}} has been scanned {{at a variety}} of phases both before and after new Moon. A differential chopping technique was used which records the flux difference between adjacent resolution elements along a scan. In principle the differential scan can be integrated to provide the flux distribution, but slow drifts in the sensor null level frustrated this procedure. However, some cold limb temperatures have been calculated using the planet Jupiter for calibration. The measurements were made with a resolution element of 27 arc seconds on the 28 -inch telescope at the University of Arizona. Scan positions were determined by noting features on the illuminated portion of the Moon through a <b>bore-sighted</b> guide telescope. Positional accuracies are within two resolution elements. The technique is particularly sensitive to the detection of nighttime anomalies, and more than 150 of these have been identified. Prior to new Moon is seen large scale thermal structure, corresponding to a previously unknown nonlinear cooling property of the lunar highlands. The nonlinear behavior consistently disappears 3. 5 to 4 days after sunset.

40|$|There are {{significant}} international efforts underway to place mobile robots (“rovers”) {{on the surface}} of Mars. This follows on the recent successful NASA Mars Pathfinder flight of summer 1997. In that mission, the 11 + Kg Sojo~rrrwr rover explored a small 50 meter locale about its lander over a several week period. Future planned science missions of the Mars Surveyor Program are more aggressive, seeking to autonomously survey planetary climate, life and resources over multiple kilometers and many months duration. These missions will also retrieve collected sample materials back to a Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAW for more detailed analysis on Earth. In support of these future missions we are developing and field testing new rover technology concepts. We first overview the design and initial operations of SRR- 1 (Sample Return Rover), a novel 10 kg-class four wheel, hybrid compositemetal vehicle for rapid (10 - 30 cdsec) autonomous location, rendezvous, and retrieval of collected samples under integrated visual and beacon guidance. SRR is a light 88 x 55 ~ 36 (LWH) cm 3 vehicle collapsing to less than one third its deployed field volume, and carrying a powerful, visually-servoed all-composite manipulator.

40|$|The Optical, Spectroscopic, and Infrared Remote Imaging System (OSIRIS) {{on board}} Rosetta {{consists}} of two <b>bore-sighted</b> cameras (Keller et al. 2007). Its Wide Angle Camera includes narrow-band filters to image gaseous emission by CS, OH, NH, CN, NH 2, Na, and [O I]. OSIRIS monitored gas about once every two weeks for heliocentric distances greater than 2 AU and weekly afterward. Images were calibrated using the OSIRIS pipeline (Tubiana et al. 2015), and further processed to remove the continuum flux and the emission from other molecules with lines that fall within the narrowband filters’ passbands. Many collimated jets are visible in the continuum images (Lara et al. 2015; Lin et al. 2015). Those jets are not present in the gas images. The morphology of the gas images is either focused in a projected cone (OI, CN) or diffuse and roughly isotropic (OH, NH, CS, NH 2). We interpret the first as the signature of prompt emission (where fragmentation of a molecule released from the nucleus directly produces a radical in an excited state), and the second as that of excitation of fragments species after they were formed. Surprisingly, up to the spring of 2015 all measured surface brightnesses are more than 10 x higher than can {{be accounted for by}} formation and excitation processes as understood from remote sensing of comets. This changed in the summer of 2015 and current measurements are consistent with photodissociation and fluorescence rates.

40|$|The {{goal of the}} Global Space-Based Inter-Calibration System (GSICS) and {{the future}} Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory (CLARREO) {{missions}} are to provide consistent calibration coefficients across satellite platforms {{in order to provide}} reliable, climate-quality retrievals. A calibration transfer that ties hyper-spectral radiances to an absolute, or traceable, calibration reference is preferred. Hyper-spectral data can be used to easily account for the varying spectral bands of operational sensors. Currently, GSICS uses the well-calibrated Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASA) hyper-spectral radiances to calibrate geostationary satellite (GEO) IR radiances. To date, no such hyper-spectral instrument {{has been used as a}} direct GEO visible calibration reference. The ENVISAT Scanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CartograpHY (SCIAMACHY) hyper-spectral data have the potential to function as a transfer medium for the absolute calibration reference of the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and GEO imagers. Additionally, SCIAMACHY can be used to adjust for imager spectral response function (SRF) differences. The SCIAMACHY absolute calibration and stability are evaluated by cross-calibrating SCIAMACHY with Aqua-MODIS at the ground track intersects near the poles, thereby serving as a calibration transfer standard. Preliminary results indicate excellent calibration transfer given that direct comparisons of Aqua-MODIS and SCIAMACHY-convolved-with-Aqua-MODIS-SRF radiances have a monthly temporal uncertainty of 0. 44 %, and a relative trend of - 0. 2 % per decade. The number of ray-matched, or <b>bore-sighted,</b> SCIAMACHY and GEO radiance pairs is limited by the size of the SCIAMACHY footprint, the number of footprints along the cross-track, and the nadir/limb view duty cycle. Relaxing the ray-matching criteria allows sufficient sampling for seasonal inter-calibration without detriment to the calibration transfer. This calibration approach reveals that the SCIAMACHY-to-Meteosat- 9 0. 65 -µm calibration transfer is within 1 % of other Meteosat- 9 calibration techniques. Furthermore, this method yields one of the lowest temporal uncertainties of all approaches, most likely because no SRF adjustment is required...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a machine vision system for relative spacecraft navigation during the terminal phase of approach to docking that: 1) matches high contrast image {{features of the}} target vehicle, as seen by a camera that is <b>bore-sighted</b> to the docking adapter on the chase vehicle, to the corresponding features in a 3 d model of the docking adapter on the target vehicle and 2) is robust to on-orbit lighting. An implementation is provided for {{the case of the}} Space Shuttle Orbiter docking to the International Space Station (ISS) with quantitative test results using a full scale, medium fidelity mock-up of the ISS docking adapter mounted on a 6 -DOF motion platform at the NASA Marshall Spaceflight Center Flight Robotics Laboratory and qualitative test results using recorded video from the Orbiter Docking System Camera (ODSC) during multiple orbiter to ISS docking missions. The Natural Feature Image Registration (NFIR) system consists of two modules: 1) Tracking which tracks the target object from image to image and estimates the position and orientation (pose) of the docking camera relative to the target object and 2) Acquisition which recognizes the target object if it is in the docking camera Field-of-View and provides an approximate pose that is used to initialize tracking. Detected image edges are matched to the 3 d model edges whose predicted location, based on the pose estimate and its first time derivative from the previous frame, is closest to the detected edge 1. Mismatches are eliminated using a rigid motion constraint. The remaining 2 d image to 3 d model matches are used to make a least squares estimate of the change in relative pose from the previous image to the current image. The changes in position and in attitude are used as data for two Kalman filters whose outputs are smoothed estimate of position and velocity plus attitude and attitude rate that are then used to predict the location of the 3 d model features in the next image...|$|E
40|$|NASA's {{long term}} plan for Mars sample {{collection}} and return requires a highly streamlined approach for spectrally characterizing a landing site, documenting the mineralogical make-up {{of the site}} and guiding the collections of samples which represent {{the diversity of the}} site. Ideally, image data should be acquired at hundreds of VIS and IR wavelengths, in order to separately distinguish numerous anticipated species, using principal component analysis and linear unmixing. Cameras with <b>bore-sighted</b> point spectrometers can acquire spectra of isolated scene elements, but it requires 10 (exp 2) to 10 (exp 2) successive motions and precise relative pointing knowledge {{in order to create a}} single data cube which qualifies as a spectral map. These and other competing science objectives have to be accomplished within very short lander/rover operational lifetime (a few sols). True, 2 -D imaging spectroscopy greatly speeds up the data acquisition process, since the spectra of all pixels in the scene are collected at once. This task can be accomplished with cameras that use electronically tunable acousto-optic tunable filters (AOTFs) as the optical tuning element. AOTFs made from TeO 2 are now a mature technology, and operate at wavelengths from near-UV to about 5 microns. Because of incremental improvements in the last few years, present generation devices are rugged, radiation-hard and operate at temperatures down to at least 150 K so they can be safely integrated into the ambient temperature optics of in-situ instruments such as planetary or small-body landers. They have been used for ground-based astronomy, and were also baselined for the ST- 4 Champollion IR comet lander experiment (CIRCLE), prior to cancellation of the ST- 4 mission last year. AIMS (for Acousto-optic Imaging spectrometer), is a prototype lander instrument which is being built at GSFC with support by the NASA OSS Advanced Technologies and Mission Studies, Mars Instrument Definition and Development Program (MIDP). AIMS is capable of tunable spectroscopic imaging of surface mineralogy, ices and dust between 0. 5 and 2. 4 microns, at a resolving power (lambda/delta lambda) which is typically several hundred. The design spatial resolution, similar to IMP and SSI, will allow mapping at scales down to about 1 cm...|$|E
