5|$|Wooten {{initially}} {{wanted a}} night landing, {{which would give}} tactical surprise and maximise the time for unloading the landing ships before Japanese aircraft put in an appearance; <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> be no moon on 4 September, so Barbey was uncertain {{that he would be}} able to correctly locate the beaches. H-Hour was therefore set at 06:30, which was twenty minutes after sunrise. Because the air force had commitments to support the 7th Division's landing at Nadzab the following day, air cover would not be available in the afternoon. Barbey therefore wanted the ships to depart at 11:00. This raised the question of whether the ships could be unloaded in just 4½ hours. Barbey gave assurances that unloading would continue even under Japanese air attack. For Australian officers with memories of the Tobruk Ferry Service, where the Royal Navy and Royal Australian Navy had lost 25 ships keeping the port's garrison supplied, the US Navy's attitude was not good enough.|$|E

This may discover new Sudokus, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> be no immediate guarantee that they are essentially different from already known Sudokus. If searching for truly new (undiscovered) Sudokus, a further confirmation would be required to ensure each find is not a transformation of an already known Sudoku.|$|E
25|$|Hoping to {{accomplish}} this, Martin Schenck devised a scheme {{through which he}} would take Nijmegen and enhance his own treasury. On the evening of 10nbsp&August 1589, Schenck and 20nbsp&barges of men—approximately 200nbsp&soldiers—made {{their way down the}} Waal to Nijmegen. Schenck's plan was simple: they would find a house with open windows. Using scaling hooks and ropes, they would climb into the house and overpower the inhabitants, who should be sleeping at that hour. Once the house was secured, they would quietly find the city gate, and open it {{to the rest of the}} force, which would be waiting on the river landing. They could then overpower the small local garrison and any citizens who felt resistance was necessary. Not only would they reinforce the city, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> be opportunity for plunder as well.|$|E

25|$|The {{preliminary}} draft plan of 1992 envisaged speeds of 250km/h with a journey time between Nuremberg and Erfurt of 75minutes. The planned costs were DM 8 billion (about €4 billion). Already in 1993, {{before the beginning}} of construction, the route handled 80passenger trains during the day and 200freight trains at night. In 1992, five options were developed that would have passed through a 20kilometre-wide corridor, one of which was immediately rejected. A route through Coburg that would have required the demolition of existing buildings was also considered. At first the use of the existing line south of Coburg with a new line commencing on its southern approach had been considered as the favoured option. The Thuringian Forest would have been crossed at its narrowest point, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> have been no stop in Coburg. In a citizens’ initiative, Coburg citizens collected 13,000 signatures against the route.|$|E
25|$|There {{remained}} the struggle in Catalonia. At no {{stage in the}} war had there been a unanimous or even majority support for Archduke Charles (Charles III) in the principality, but {{the existence of a}} rebel group inside the province, together with a superior Allied military and naval presence in Barcelona, forced many towns to decide – often reluctantly – for the Archduke's cause. Nevertheless, those who wished to continue fighting could point {{to the fact that the}} Kingdoms of Aragon and Valencia, as well as those in Castile, were subject to a regime that had forced them to change their laws and historic constitutions, and at no stage since his victory at Almansa and the subsequent abolition of the fueros in Aragon and Valencia in 1707, had Philip V shown any intention of respecting Catalonia's privileges. In consequence, Barcelona decided to resist, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> be no Allied help. After the peace agreements between the major powers neither Austria nor Great Britain could return to a war footing. To compound the issue, Tory diplomatic efforts with Philip V to secure Catalan liberties were half-hearted, and Bolingbroke made no protest when, in early July 1714 – after a year of guerilla warfare in the region – Berwick returned to Catalonia to formally besiege Barcelona. Antoni de Villarroel put up a stout defence of the city, but with little hope of relief the Catalan capital surrendered on 11 September. Cardona soon followed. Majorca held out for nine months until its surrender in July 1715.|$|E

Newark would allow New Mexico and two other battleships, [...] and , to be scrapped at Newark, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> be no permanent ship dismantling facility. Lipsett had nine months {{to dispose of the}} three ships, or would be subjected to a fine of $1,000 per day after the deadline.|$|E

500|$|Several {{biographies of}} Hans-Joachim Marseille {{have written about}} his disdain for {{authority}} and for the National Socialist movement in general. Some biographers describe him as [...] "openly anti-Nazi." [...] When Marseille first met Hitler in 1942 he did not form a positive impression. After returning to Africa, Eduard Neumman recalled, [...] "After his first visit with Hitler, Marseille returned {{and said that he}} thought 'the Führer was a rather odd sort'." [...] On the visit, Marseille also said some unflattering things about Hitler and the Nazi Party. Several senior officers, which included Adolf Galland and Nicolaus von Below, overheard his remarks during one of the award ceremonies. Von Below asked Marseille if he would join the Nazi Party and within earshot of others, Marseille responded, [...] "that if he saw a party worth joining, he would consider it, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> have to plenty of attractive women in it." [...] The remarks visibly upset Hitler who was left [...] "puzzled" [...] by his behaviour.|$|E
500|$|Sauropelta was {{a heavily}} built quadrupedal {{herbivore}} {{with a body}} length of approximately [...] The skull was triangular when viewed from above, with the rear end wider than the tapering snout. One skull measured 35centimeters (13.75in) in width at its widest point, behind the eyes. Unlike some other nodosaurids, {{the roof of the}} skull was characteristically flat, not domed. The roof of the skull was very thick and covered in flat, bony plates that are so tightly fused that there appear to be no sutures (boundaries) like the ones seen in Panoplosaurus, Pawpawsaurus, Silvisaurus, and many other ankylosaurs. This could also be an artifact of preservation or preparation. As in other ankylosaurs, thick triangular scutes projected from the postorbital bone, above and behind the eyes, as well as the jugal bone, below and behind the eyes. More typically for nodosaurids, leaf-shaped teeth lined both upper and lower jaws, used for cutting plant material. The front end of the skull is unknown, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> have been a sharp bony ridge (tomium) at the end of both upper and lower jaws, as seen in other ankylosaurs. This ridge probably would have supported a keratinous beak.|$|E
500|$|In June 1817 Metternich was {{required}} to escort the emperor's newly wed daughter Maria Leopoldina to a ship at Livorno. There was delay upon their arrival, and Metternich spent the time travelling around Italy again; he visited Venice, Padua, Ferrara, Pisa, Florence and Lucca. Though alarmed by developments (he noted that many of Francis' concessions were still not in practice), he was optimistic and made another plea for decentralisation on 29 August. After this failed, Metternich decided to broaden his efforts into general administrative reform to avoid the appearance of favouring the Italians {{over the rest of}} the Empire. While working on this, he returned to Vienna on 12 September 1817 to be immediately caught up in the organisation of his daughter Maria's marriage to Count Joseph Esterházy just three days later. It proved too much, and Metternich was taken ill. After a delay for recovery, [...] Metternich condensed his proposals for Italy into three documents he submitted to Francis, all dated 27 October 1817. The administration would remain undemocratic, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> be a new Ministry of Justice and four new chancellors—each with local remits, including one for [...] "Italy". Importantly, the divisions would be regional, not national. In the end, Francis accepted the revised proposals, albeit with several alterations and restrictions.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{after the}} crisis eased in 1974, the upper {{house of the}} German parliament, which was {{controlled}} by conservative parties, successfully resisted {{the imposition of a}} permanent mandatory limit supported by Chancellor Brandt. The upper house insisted on a [...] recommended limit until a thorough study of the effects of a mandatory limit could be conducted. Accordingly, the Federal Highway Research Institute conducted a multiple-year experiment, switching between mandatory and recommended limits on two test stretches of autobahn. In the final report issued in 1977, the Institute stated the mandatory speed limit could reduce the autobahn death toll <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> be economic impacts, so a political decision had to be made due to the trade-offs involved. At that time, the Federal Government declined to impose a mandatory limit. The fatality rate trend on the German autobahn mirrored those of other nations' motorways that imposed a general speed limit.|$|E
2500|$|... 2006 {{had seen}} the Tories make gains in local elections, as well as enjoying their first {{consistent}} lead of the opinion polls in 14 years. 2007 had seen both the Tories and Labour lead the opinion polls, but 2008 saw the Tories build up a wide lead as the Labour government's support slumped {{in the face of}} the economic crisis. Labour also suffered huge losses in local elections, as well as suffering by-election defeats, with the Tories, Liberal Democrats and Scottish National Party all enjoying success at Labour's expense. This trend continued throughout 2009 as the recession deepened and unemployment continued to soar. The expenses scandal also had an adverse effect on the Labour government's dwindling popularity, although MPs from other parties were also shamed in the scandal. Labour also performed dismally in the European parliament elections of 2009, and opinion polls pointed towards a heavy defeat in the event of a general election. The previous two general elections had both been held at four-year intervals, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> be no general election in 2009.|$|E

2500|$|Vinod Mehta (writer of Meena Kumari - The Classic Biography) {{was told}} by a director: [...] "Even Dilip Kumar (the tragedy king) found it {{difficult}} to keep his calm in front of her". Raaj Kumar would often forget his dialogues while working with Meena Kumari on set. Madhubala was also a fan of Meena Kumari and said: [...] "She has the most unique voice. No other heroine has it." [...] Satyajit Ray described Kumari as [...] "undoubtedly an actress of the highest calibre". Amitabh Bachchan said [...] " [...] No one, not any one, ever spoke dialogues the way Meena Kumari did [...]. no one [...]. not anyone to date.. and perhaps never will [...] " [...] Legendary Music Director Naushad said on the record [...] " [...] Hindi film industry may produce great actresses <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> never be another Meena Kumari". Meena Kumari empathized greatly with Marilyn Monroe, the fact that Marilyn's husband, Arthur Miller, had some passing similarities to Meena's husband Kamal Amrohi, made the identification closer. It is said that throughout her life, Meena Kumari had a love–hate relationship with the movies.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the second}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Judah told Joseph that if Judah {{were to come}} to his father without the lad, then his father would die in sorrow.

Joseph could no longer control his {{emotions}} and ordered everyone but his brothers to leave the room. He wept aloud, and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard. Joseph told his brothers that he was Joseph, and asked them whether his father was still alive, but his brothers were too frightened to answer him.

2500|$|In Keynes' reordering, Series a {{comprises}} eight plates, one {{of which}} is missing (Plate a2 (title page); this is because the title page from the 1794 print is actually a version of the title page from the 1795 print, and as the title is thought to suit Series b better than Series a, it tends to be designated Plate b2 and assigned to Series b). Keynes also assigned the three plates from 1794 which were reprinted in 1795 to Series b, designating them b3, b4 and b12. As such, Series b comprises eleven plates, with at least one plate missing (Plate b5; III). In 1978, David Bindman suggested that there are more plates missing from Series b than just Plate 5, as he argued that the last three plates (Application, Conclusion and 'Therefore') are thematically isolated, suggesting more missing plates which should come after Plate b8 (VII). Bindman also saw the missing title page from Series a as important, arguing that although Series a was printed with the same title plate as Series b, there is no direct evidence that There is No Natural Religion is actually the correct title of Series a; [...] "There is No Natural Religion would seem to be the title of Series b, and its content would be compatible with such a title; <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> then be no reason why Series a should have the same title." ...|$|E
