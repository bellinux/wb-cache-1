25|$|External <b>beam</b> <b>radiation</b> therapy uses {{a linear}} {{accelerator}} to produce high-energy x-rays that are directed in a beam towards the prostate. A technique called Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) {{may be used}} to adjust the radiation beam to conform with the shape of the tumor, allowing higher doses to be given to the prostate and seminal vesicles with less damage to the bladder and rectum. External <b>beam</b> <b>radiation</b> therapy is generally given over several weeks, with daily visits to a radiation therapy center. New types of radiation therapy such as IMRT have fewer side effects than traditional treatment. Eleven centers in the United States are now using proton therapy for prostate cancer, which uses protons rather than X-rays to kill the cancer cells. Researchers are also studying types of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) to treat prostate cancer.|$|E

The spectra of the scattered radiation exhibit a cut off at gamma-ray energies due to electron recoil. The cut off energy depends on the observer's viewing angle and the bulk Lorentz factor of the scattering medium. We fit the OSSE data from Centaurus A with this model and find that if the scatterers are not moving relativistically, then the angle the jet makes with respect to our line-of-sight is 61 ffi Σ 5 ffi.

25|$|Historically, {{the three}} main {{divisions}} of radiation therapy are external <b>beam</b> <b>radiation</b> therapy (EBRT or XRT) or teletherapy, brachytherapy or sealed source radiation therapy, and systemic radioisotope therapy or unsealed source radiotherapy. The differences relate {{to the position of}} the radiation source; external is outside the body, brachytherapy uses sealed radioactive sources placed precisely in the area under treatment, and systemic radioisotopes are given by infusion or oral ingestion. Brachytherapy can use temporary or permanent placement of radioactive sources. The temporary sources are usually placed by a technique called afterloading. In afterloading a hollow tube or applicator is placed surgically in the organ to be treated, and the sources are loaded into the applicator after the applicator is implanted. This minimizes radiation exposure to health care personnel. Particle therapy is a special case of external <b>beam</b> <b>radiation</b> therapy where the particles are protons or heavier ions. Intraoperative radiation therapy or IORT is a special type of radiation therapy that is delivered immediately after surgical removal of the cancer. This method has been employed in breast cancer (TARGeted Introperative radiation therapy or TARGIT), brain tumors and rectal cancers.|$|E
25|$|Treatment for {{prostate}} cancer may involve active surveillance, surgery, radiation therapy including brachytherapy (prostate brachytherapy) and external <b>beam</b> <b>radiation</b> therapy, high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), cryosurgery, hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, or some combination. Which option is best depends {{on the stage of}} the disease, the Gleason score, and the PSA level. Other important factors are the man's age, his general health, and his feelings about potential treatments and their possible side effects. Because all treatments can have significant side effects, such as erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence, treatment discussions often focus on balancing the goals of therapy with the risks of lifestyle alterations.|$|E
25|$|In brachytherapy, {{radiation}} {{sources are}} precisely placed {{directly at the}} site of the cancerous tumour. This means that the irradiation only affects a very localized area – exposure to radiation of healthy tissues further away from the sources is reduced. These characteristics of brachytherapy provide advantages over external <b>beam</b> <b>radiation</b> therapy – the tumour can be treated with very high doses of localized radiation, whilst reducing the probability of unnecessary damage to surrounding healthy tissues. A course of brachytherapy can often be completed in less time than other radiation therapy techniques. This can help reduce the chance of surviving cancer cells dividing and growing in the intervals between each radiation therapy dose.|$|E

We apply our model to the well studied jet of M 87 and the surrounding diffuse gas and find that the observational limits of the surface brightness measured {{in the region of}} the putative counterjet provide the tightest constraints on the jet parameters consistent with constraints derived by other methods.

25|$|If {{the cancer}} has spread beyond the prostate, {{treatment}} options significantly change, so most doctors that treat prostate cancer {{use a variety}} of nomograms to predict the probability of spread. Treatment by watchful waiting/active surveillance, HIFU, external <b>beam</b> <b>radiation</b> therapy, brachytherapy, cryosurgery, and surgery are, in general, offered to men whose cancer remains within the prostate. Hormonal therapy and chemotherapy are often reserved for disease that has spread beyond the prostate. However, there are exceptions: Radiation therapy may be used for some advanced tumors, and hormonal therapy is used for some early stage tumors. Cryotherapy (the process of freezing the tumor), hormonal therapy, and chemotherapy may also be offered if initial treatment fails and the cancer progresses.|$|E
25|$|More recently, Cherenkov {{light has}} been used to image {{substances}} in the body. These discoveries have led to intense interest around the idea of using this light signal to quantify and/or detect radiation in the body, either from internal sources such as injected radiopharmaceuticals or from external beam radiotherapy in oncology. Radioisotopes such as the Beta emitters 18-F and 13-N or positron emitters 32-P or 90-Y have measurable Cherenkov emission and isotopes 18-F and 131-I have been imaged in humans for diagnostic value demonstration. External <b>beam</b> <b>radiation</b> therapy has been shown to induce a substantial amount of Cherenkov light in the tissue being treated, due to the photon beam energy levels used in the 6 MV to 18 MV ranges. The secondary electrons induced by these high energy x-rays result in the Cherenkov light emission, where the detected signal can be imaged at the entry and exit surfaces of the tissue.|$|E
25|$|The breast implant has no {{clinical}} bearing upon lumpectomy breast-conservation {{surgery for}} women who developed breast cancer after the implantation procedure, nor does the breast implant interfere with external <b>beam</b> <b>radiation</b> treatments (XRT); moreover, the post-treatment incidence of breast-tissue fibrosis is common, and thus a consequent increased rate of capsular contracture. The study Breast Cancer Detection and Survival among Women with Cosmetic Breast Implants: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Observational Studies, reported a significant delay in the diagnoses of women who developed breast cancer after undergoing breast augmentation, when compared to breast cancer patients who had not undergone breast augmentation. The metadata study Breast Implants following Mastectomy in Women with Early-stage Breast Cancer: Prevalence and Impact on Survival (2005) reported that breast augmentation patients were statistically likelier to die from breast cancer. Although the use of implants for breast reconstruction after breast cancer mastectomy appears to have no negative effect upon the incidence of cancer-related death, women who underwent a mastectomy procedure tend to die earlier than women who underwent a lumpectomy procedure, with like diagnoses.|$|E

25|$|Conventional {{external}} <b>beam</b> <b>radiation</b> therapy (2DXRT) {{is delivered}} via two-dimensional beams using kilovoltage therapy x-ray units or medical linear accelerators which generate high energy x-rays. 2DXRT mainly {{consists of a}} single beam of radiation delivered to the patient from several directions: often front or back, and both sides. Conventional refers {{to the way the}} treatment is planned or simulated on a specially calibrated diagnostic x-ray machine known as a simulator because it recreates the linear accelerator actions (or sometimes by eye), and to the usually well-established arrangements of the radiation beams to achieve a desired plan. The aim of simulation is to accurately target or localize the volume which is to be treated. This technique is well established and is generally quick and reliable. The worry is that some high-dose treatments may be limited by the radiation toxicity capacity of healthy tissues which lie close to the target tumor volume. An example of this problem is seen in radiation of the prostate gland, where the sensitivity of the adjacent rectum limited the dose which could be safely prescribed using 2DXRT planning {{to such an extent that}} tumor control may not be easily achievable. Prior to the invention of the CT, physicians and physicists had limited knowledge about the true radiation dosage delivered to both cancerous and healthy tissue. For this reason, 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy is becoming the standard treatment for a number of tumor sites. More recently other forms of imaging are used including MRI, PET, SPECT and Ultrasound.|$|E
