25|$|On {{the basis}} of {{morphology}} and physical characteristics, tektites have traditionally been divided into four groups. The tektites which have been found on land have traditionally been subdivided into three groups: (1) splash-form (normal) tektites, (2) aerodynamically shaped tektites, and (3) Muong Nong-type (layered) tektites. Splash-form and aerodynamically shaped tektites are only differentiated on {{the basis of}} their appearance and some of their physical characteristics. Splash-form tektites are centimeter-sized tektites that are shaped like spheres, ellipsoids, teardrops, dumbbells, and other forms characteristic of isolated molten bodies. They are regarded as having formed from the solidification of rotating liquids, and not atmospheric ablation. Aerodynamically shaped tektites, which are mainly part of the Australasian strewn field, are splash-form tektites (buttons) which display a secondary ring or flange. The secondary ring or flange is argued as having been produced during the high-speed reentry and ablation of a solidified splash-form tektite into the atmosphere. Muong Nong tektites are typically larger, greater than 10nbsp&cm in size and 24nbsp&kg in weight, irregular, and layered tektites. They have a chunky, blocky appearance, exhibit a layered structure with abundant vesicles, and contain mineral inclusions, such as zircon, <b>baddeleyite,</b> chromite, rutile, corundum, cristobalite and coesite.|$|E
500|$|Zirconium has a {{concentration}} of about 130mg/kg within the Earth's crust and about 0.026μg/L in sea water. [...] It is not found in nature as a native metal, reflecting its intrinsic instability with respect to water. The principal commercial source of zirconium is zircon (ZrSiO4), a silicate mineral, which is found primarily in Australia, Brazil, India, Russia, South Africa and the United States, {{as well as in}} smaller deposits around the world. As of 2013, two-thirds of zircon mining occurs in Australia and South Africa. Zircon resources exceed 60 million tonnes worldwide and annual worldwide zirconium production is approximately 900,000 tonnes. Zirconium also occurs in more than 140 other minerals, including the commercially useful ores <b>baddeleyite</b> and kosnarite.|$|E

It has a distinct cleavage along {001} and tends to twin along (100). It belongs to the monoclinic system and {{is part of the}} P21/c group.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Baddeleyite</b> {{belongs to}} the oxide group, having a {{composition}} of ZrO2. Similar minerals belonging to the same group are the rutile group: rutile (TiO2), pyrolusite (MnO2), cassiterite (SnO2), uraninite (UO2) and thorianite (ThO2). <b>Baddeleyite</b> is chemically homogeneous, but it may contain impurities such as Ti, Hf, and Fe. [...] Higher concentrations of Ti and Fe are restricted to mafic-ultramafic rocks.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Baddeleyite</b> {{was first}} found in Sri Lanka in 1892. It {{can be found}} in {{numerous}} terrestrial and lunar rocks. Some of these terrestrial rocks are carbonatite, kimberlite, alkaline syenite, some rocks of layered mafic intrusions, diabase dikes, gabbroid sills and anorthosite. [...] Some examples of lunar rocks are tektites, meteorites and lunar basalt. Studies have shown that zircon and <b>baddeleyite</b> can be recovered from some anorthositic rocks in Proterozoic anorthosite complexes. [...] Places where these Proterozoic anorthosite complexes can be found are: the Laramie Anorthosite Complex in Wyoming, the Nain and Grenville provinces of Canada, the Vico Volcanic Complex in Italy, and Minas Gerais and Jacupiranga, São Paulo, Brazil. <b>Baddeleyite</b> forms in igneous rocks low in silica, it {{can be found in}} rocks containing potassium feldspar and plagioclase.

50|$|It can {{be found}} in igneous rocks {{containing}} potassium feldspar and plagioclase. <b>Baddeleyite</b> is commonly found with zircon (ZrSiO4), yet it forms in places with lower silica content, such as mafic rocks. This is because <b>baddeleyite</b> tends to become zircon where there is higher silica content, hence why both minerals {{can be found}} together. It belongs to the monoclinic-prismatic class, of the P21/c crystal system. It has been used for geochronology.|$|E
50|$|Although zircon (ZrSiO4) is most {{commonly}} used, other minerals such as monazite (see: monazite geochronology), titanite, and <b>baddeleyite</b> {{can also be}} used.|$|E
50|$|Because {{of their}} {{refractory}} nature and stability under diverse conditions, <b>baddeleyite</b> grains, along with zircon, {{are used for}} uranium-lead radiometric age determinations.|$|E
50|$|It {{occurs in}} pegmatites in a {{pyroxenite}} intrusion as crystals in miarolitic cavities. It occurs associated with ilmenite, titaniferous magnetite, titanite, anatase, perovskite, <b>baddeleyite,</b> phlogopite, clinochlore and kassite.|$|E
50|$|Uranium-lead dating {{is often}} {{performed}} on the mineral zircon (ZrSiO4), though {{it can be used}} on other materials, such as <b>baddeleyite,</b> as well as monazite (see: monazite geochronology). Zircon and <b>baddeleyite</b> incorporate uranium atoms into their crystalline structure as substitutes for zirconium, but strongly reject lead. Zircon has a very high closure temperature, is resistant to mechanical weathering and is very chemically inert. Zircon also forms multiple crystal layers during metamorphic events, which each may record an isotopic age of the event. In situ micro-beam analysis can be achieved via laser ICP-MS or SIMS techniques.|$|E
50|$|The {{coordination}} {{number for}} ZrO2 {{has been found}} to be 7. The mineral has two types of separations. The first being the seven shortest Zr-O, ranging from 2.04 to 2.26 Å, and the second Zr-O separation is 3.77 Å. Because of this, the coordination of <b>baddeleyite</b> was determined to be sevenfold. Baddeleyite's structure is a combination of tetrahedrally coordinated oxide ions parallel to (100) with triangular coordinated oxide ions. This explains baddeleyite's tendency to twin along the (100) planes. It has been observed that <b>baddeleyite</b> without twinning is extremely rare.|$|E

50|$|It {{was named}} for Joseph Baddeley. The mineral was {{discovered}} in Rakwana, Ceylon, now known as Sri Lanka. Baddeley was a superintendent of a railroad project in Rakwana. As redacted by J. J. H. Teall, Director of the British Geological Survey in the early 1900s, <b>Baddeleyite</b> was discovered thanks {{to the discovery of}} Geikielite. Baddeley happened to send specimens of several pebbles to the Museum of Practical Geology in London, where Mr. Pringle examined them and attempted to classify them. According to Teall, the specimens were submitted to him by Pringle after he failed to assign them and compare them to other species, such as spinel, ilmenite, and so on. After analyzing the specimens, Teall concluded that the mineral was mainly composed of titanic acid and magnesia, with {{a very small percentage of}} protoxide of iron. Geikielite has the composition of MgTiO3. Concluding the various analyses, Teall and Pringle decided to name the new mineral Geikielite, taking the name after the Director General of the Geological Survey, Sir Archibald Geikie. Baddeley then decided to send more specimens to Teall in order to determine a proper specimen to be put in display at the Museum of Practical Geology. While trying to find the best specimen for display, as Teall relates, he noticed that one of the specimens was different from the rest. This new mineral as described was black in color, with a submetallic lustre and a hardness of 6.5. After analyzing the mineral, it was determined that its composition was not MgTiO3, as geikielite's, but it was ZrO2. Teall proposed that the new mineral should be named <b>baddeleyite,</b> after Joseph Baddeley to honor the man who brought two new minerals to notice.|$|E
50|$|On {{completing}} his degree at age 21, {{he worked as}} an assayer in London and at the Royal Mines of Elba. During the period of 1900/1901 to 1909 he was on staff at the Scientific and Technical Department of the Imperial Institute engaged in mineralogical studies of Crown colonies. Here, with Dunstan, thorianite from Ceylon {{was described as a}} new mineral and he published papers on <b>baddeleyite</b> and zirkelite from Ceylon and carnotite from South Australia. After this, he spent time in Matto Grosso, Brazil exploring for minerals, looking for gold at Timmins around Porcupine Lake, Ontario, and prospecting for petroleum in Newfoundland and Canada. On returning to England in 1915, he worked at Warrington as a mineral analyst and then at Sheffield as deputy chief analyst, both roles for the Ministry of Munitions. Between 1920 and 1922 he worked as a tutor at the Imperial College of Science and Technology.|$|E

40|$|<b>Baddeleyite</b> is a {{frequently}} found accessory mineral in silica-undersaturated lavas. Because it {{is typically}} enriched in uranium, while having low initial lead, <b>baddeleyite</b> {{has long been}} a prime target for U-Pb geochronology for mafic rocks. The difficulties in retrieving small <b>baddeleyite</b> grains from volcanic samples and the lack of a detailed understanding of <b>baddeleyite</b> occurrence, however, have limited <b>baddeleyite</b> chronology largely to coarse-grained mafic intrusive rocks. In this thesis, the development of U-Th in-situ <b>baddeleyite</b> analysis using Secondary Ionization Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) is presented together with an assessment of <b>baddeleyite</b> occurrence in Quaternary silica-undersaturated lavas. Samples studied include the Cathedral Crag and Burroughs Mountain lava flows of Cascade arc volcanoes Mt. Baker and Mt. Rainier (Washington, USA), respectively, and Accademia, Punta Marmolite and Cuma lava domes of the Campi Flegrei caldera (Naples, Italy). <b>Baddeleyite</b> crystals were initially identified in cut and polished rock billets using scanning electron microscope (SEM) backscatter imaging and energy dispersive x-ray analysis, before they were separated by diamond-drilling for SIMS analysis. A total of 62 and 52 <b>baddeleyite</b> crystals were documented from Cathedral and Burroughs Mountain lava flows; 205, 42 and 15 <b>baddeleyite</b> crystals were documented from Accademia, Punta Marmolite and Cuma lava domes, respectively. U-Th <b>baddeleyite</b> isochron ages range between near secular equilibrium for Cathedral Crag lava flow: 404. 5 - 197. 8 + ∞ ka (MSWD = 0. 88; n = 3); and 4. 36 - 1. 12 + 1. 13 ka (MSWD = 2. 9; n = 24) for the Accademia lava dome. The ages for Punta Marmolite (62. 4 - 3. 9 + 3. 8 ka; MSWD = 1. 2; n = 11) and Cuma (45. 9 - 3. 5 + 3. 6 ka; MSWD = 2. 2; n = 11) fall in between, and are in a favorable age range for U-Th dating approximately near one half-life of 230 Th (~ 75. 69 ka). Burroughs Mountain lava was not dated because it is expected to be in secular equilibrium, but it was used to monitor the abundance of <b>baddeleyite</b> in basaltic andesite from an arc volcano. The U-Th <b>baddeleyite</b> ages generally agree with previously reported K-Ar ages, except for the Punta Marmolite lava flow, which has a significantly older U-Th <b>baddeleyite</b> age compared to the K-Ar age. The age comparisons suggest that <b>baddeleyite</b> overwhelmingly crystallized near the time of eruption, in contrast to the frequently observed protracted pre-eruptive residence of zircon in silicic volcanic rocks. Near-eruption crystallization is supported by observations that ~ 50 % of <b>baddeleyite</b> crystals occur at the walls of vesicles in most lavas studied here, including Punta Marmolite lava flow. The apparent hiatus between <b>baddeleyite</b> crystallization and eruption in Punta Marmolite thus could reflect a bias in the K-Ar age. U-Th <b>baddeleyite</b> dating is demonstrated to be a reliable chronometer for Quaternary silica-undersaturated volcanic rocks, and thus can be the primary dating technique for rocks that lack other datable minerals...|$|E
