Binary logarithms allow for a convenient comparison of expression rates: a doubled expression rate can be described by a log ratio of , a halved expression rate can be described by a log ratio of , and an unchanged expression rate can be described by a log ratio of zero, for instance.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{suggest a}} model of {{informed}} consent for the collection, storage and use of <b>biological</b> <b>materials</b> in local biobanks for health research purposes. METHODS: Review of the major ethical issues related to collection, storage and use of human <b>biological</b> <b>materials</b> for research purposes. RESULTS: An informed consent form for the collection and use of <b>biological</b> <b>materials</b> in a specific research project, and an informed consent form for the collection, storage and use of <b>biological</b> <b>materials</b> in a biobank were separately developed. Two main rules govern the proposed model, as follows: the informed consent {{for the use of}} <b>biological</b> <b>materials</b> shall (i) give donors sufficient information to take informed decisions about possible present and future uses of their <b>biological</b> <b>materials</b> and (ii) consider the specific biological and genetic aims of the research being performed. CONCLUSION: Even if informed consent for the collection, storage and use of <b>biological</b> <b>materials</b> is a hard process, donors can actually be provided with sufficient information and choices to give a 'really informed consent'. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The proposed model can be a useful guideline for the development of specific informed consent forms to be used by researchers. It can also be a good tool to let the donors know which information and guarantees they can request from researchers. status: publishe...|$|R

Amid the wealth of <b>biological</b> <b>materials</b> of archaeological interest, a special attention is paid to carbonate-based materials such as corals and shells and phosphate-based ones, including bone, teeth, ivory and antler. The structural features of these archaeobiominerals at different length scales down to the nanoscopic scale are highlighted in this chapter as they allow drawing conclusions on ancient working techniques, the provision and circulation of raw materials, anthropological heat processes, and, last but not least, on diagenetic changes and authentication purposes. The informative potential of observations of archaeological <b>biological</b> <b>materials</b> at different length scales is finally illustrated by some study cases...|$|R
25|$|Cryobiology is {{the branch}} of biology that studies the effects of low {{temperatures}} on living things within Earth's cryosphere or in science. The word cryobiology {{is derived from the}} Greek words κρῧος , « cold », βίος , « life », and λόγος , « word » (hence science). In practice, cryobiology is the study of <b>biological</b> <b>material</b> or systems at temperatures below normal.

25|$|A neutron bomb, {{technically}} {{referred to}} as an enhanced radiation weapon (ERW), {{is a type of}} tactical nuclear weapon designed specifically to release a large portion of its energy as energetic neutron radiation.

In terms of yield, ERWs typically produce about one-tenth that of a fission-type atomic weapon. Even with their significantly lower explosive power, ERWs are still capable of much greater destruction than any conventional bomb.
