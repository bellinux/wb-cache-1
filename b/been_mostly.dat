5|$|Mother Gothel has <b>been</b> <b>mostly</b> well {{received}} by film critics, who enjoyed the character's humor, complexity, charisma and showmanship, dubbing her a scene stealer, while praising Murphy's performance enthusiastically. However, some critics felt that Gothel {{was simply too}} passive – a weaker, less intimidating Disney villainess than Maleficent from Sleeping Beauty (1959) and Cruella de Vil from One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961).|$|E
5|$|Schubert's piano sonatas {{seem to have}} <b>been</b> <b>mostly</b> {{neglected}} {{during the}} entire nineteenth century, often dismissed for being too long, lacking in formal coherence, being un-pianistic, etc. However, references to the last sonatas can be found among two nineteenth-century Romantic composers who took serious interest in Schubert's music and were influenced by it: Schumann and Brahms.|$|E

Later reviews, both contemporary and retrospective, for the 32X have <b>been</b> <b>mostly</b> negative because of its shallow game library, poor market timing and the resulting market fragmentation for the Genesis.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the weather}} had <b>been</b> <b>mostly</b> rainy {{up to this point}} in the campaign, a snow storm arrived the night of February 13, with strong winds that brought {{temperatures}} down to 10–12°F (−12°C) and deposited 3inches (8cm) of snow by morning. Guns and wagons were frozen to the earth. Because of the proximity of the enemy lines and the active sharpshooters, the soldiers could not light campfires for warmth or cooking, and both sides were miserable that night, many having arrived without blankets or overcoats.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} for Outlaw Star has <b>been</b> <b>mostly</b> positive. Many reviewers praised the anime series, particularly its animation style and its balance of dramatic and comedic elements.

5|$|Hippopotamus lemerlei bones have <b>been</b> <b>mostly</b> {{discovered}} in the rivers and lakes of western Madagascar, suggesting a riparian lifestyle, {{very similar to that}} of the modern hippopotamus of modern Africa. H. lemerlei also shared the high-orbits that make it easier for the hippopotamus to see while in the water. The skull of H. lemerlei also resembled that of the modern hippopotamus, but with consistent size differences, indicating that H. lemerlei was a sexually dimorphic species.|$|E
5|$|Pennsylvania Rep. William C. Kortz {{and retired}} {{manufacturer}} Joseph Vodvarka also {{ran in the}} Democratic primary, but neither remained {{for the duration of}} the race.

Applications in electronics, once important, have <b>been</b> <b>mostly</b> supplanted by silicon semiconductor devices. Selenium is still used in a few types of DC power surge protectors and one type of fluorescent quantum dot.|$|E
