50|$|He {{published}} many papers, {{a notable}} one being “The Hazard Warning Structure of Major Hazards” which showed how risks could be assessed and reduced. However, {{he will be}} most remembered for his <b>book</b> <b>Loss</b> Prevention in the Process Industries of more than 1000 pages published in two volumes in 1980. This was {{a comprehensive review of}} the literature on accidents - how they happen and how they might be prevented. He took early retirement in 1990 to work on the second edition, which was published in 1996 in three volumes, indicating the growth in the field. Most books of this type would have been the result of efforts by a large team, but he was a single author. He had just finished the revision when he was affected by cancer, which led to his death.|$|E
50|$|Sampling is a {{compromise}} measure, {{which can be}} an important management tool. Random sampling of library collections can give a quick and clear assessment measure of a collection — whether the books are present, and whether those books present are in good physical condition. In 1982, the California State University libraries, suggested inventory procedures to insure that the 19 campus collections were secure and intact. They recognized that a complete regular inventory was too expensive, and decided that the best method of assessing <b>book</b> <b>loss</b> would be to use sampling. Every three years, a sample was to be taken of an identified number of items in each Library of Congress letter classification. If loss rates were more than 1% for two years in a row, this would indicate that a full inventory was needed.|$|E

40|$|Under the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB) {{capital charges}} for the trading book {{are based on}} the {{coherent}} expected shortfall (ES) risk measure, which show greater sensitivity to tail risk. In this paper it is argued that backtesting of expected shortfall - or the trading book model from which it is calculated - can be based on a simultaneous multinomial test of value-at-risk (VaR) exceptions at different levels, an idea supported by an approximation of ES in terms of multiple quantiles of a distribution proposed in Emmer et al. (2015). By comparing Pearson, Nass and likelihood-ratio tests (LRTs) for different numbers of VaR levels N it is shown in a series of simulation experiments that multinomial tests with N≥ 4 are much more powerful at detecting misspecifications of trading <b>book</b> <b>loss</b> models than standard binomial exception tests corresponding to the case N= 1. Each test has its merits: Pearson offers simplicity; Nass is robust in its size properties to the choice of N; the LRT is very powerful though slightly over-sized in small samples and more computationally burdensome. A traffic-light system for trading book models based on the multinomial test is proposed and the recommended procedure is applied to a real-data example spanning the 2008 financial crisis.

40|$|Objective: During {{the summer}} of 2014, Laupus Library at East Carolina University began {{investigating}} {{an increase in the}} number of items that were being reported as being “not on shelf” by staff and patrons. Due to a previous incident of organized theft, we decided to act quickly and determine the cause of these reports. Our project objectives were to assess the extent of loss, to look for correlations between areas of high loss and specific topics or disciplines, to implement measures to reduce the amount of loss, to uncover library book collection control practices at other libraries, and to conduct a follow-up assessment to measure the success of our efforts. Methods: An inventory was conducted of the entire library circulating collection in 2014 with an analysis of the percentage of books lost and the percentage of loss of the book collection value. A survey of the AAHSL libraries will be conducted on their collection control practices. After creating a case with campus police and increasing theft-prevention measures, a follow up inventory is presently being conducted to assess the success of the steps we took to mitigate loss. We also continue to monitor reports from patrons and staff who were unsuccessful in locating a book that should be located on the shelf per the library catalog. Results/Conclusion: By analyzing the loss-rate percentages of the first inventory and through analyzing both the statistical data and anecdotal patron and staff reports on the now current collection, we see a reduction already in <b>book</b> <b>loss.</b> Reviewing the data from other AAHSL libraries illustrated common practices among other health sciences libraries to help determine successful loss prevention measures...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to find out about the activities done by the DPK Gunugkidul as the strategy to develop the library service based on the SWOT Analysis and to know about the obstacles that were faced during the service developing process based on the SWOT analysis. This research was a qualitative research which took place in DPK Gunungkidul. Data collecting was done using observation method, interview method and documentation method. Data analysis used descriptive qualitative that was begun with data collecting, data reducing, data serving and elaborating. Data validity test used triangulation and member check techniques. Based on the interview result and the research that was done could be concluded that the service developing strategies of DPK Gunungkidul were (a) DPK Gunungkidul did such approach to attract the users to come to the library. (b) DPK Gunungkidul assisted the users in knowing the facilities and the collections of the library. (c) DPK Gunungkidul increased the facilities including computer units and faster internet connections, ordering book box, music instruments and reading area in the library. (d) DPK Gunungkidul made communications with the third-party institution to hold the mobile library activity. (e) DPK Gunungkidul made training programs such as batik printing, traditional puppet making and traditional cap making. Whereas, the obstacles faced by the DPK Gunungkidul were (a) the minimum number of SDM (Human Resource) that worked in DPK Gunungkidul. (b) lack of user monitoring in internet service area. (c) the minimum number of the transportations owned by the DPK Gunungkidul to support mobile library activity. (e) high number of <b>book</b> <b>loss</b> in DPK Gunungkidul’s collective borrowing, it was about 50 books. The researcher’s suggestion was DPK Gunungkidul should maximize the librarian role in giving service to the users by developing the disciplines and responsibilities in doing the job desk, giving the attractive activities to the people in Gunungkidul, improving the infrastructures and facilities such as increasing the number of tables and chairs at the reading area, computer units as the electronic catalogues, room lighting and expanding the library room. And also, it would be much better if DPK Gunungkidul rearranging the library room, so that the visitors would get fresh atmosphere and it would be more attractive...|$|E
