Komatsuna (Brassica rapa var. perviridis) was used as the vegetable. <b>Bark</b> <b>compost</b> (a soil conditioner) and/or phosphate (P) fertilizer were mixed to WTRs for improving its physicochemical properties. These mixture mediums were called cultivation soils. As a result, pH, and P absorption coefficient were not different between the WTRs and the cultivation soils. The pH, electric conductivity and effective cation exchange capacity of the cultivation soils were favorable, but the P absorption coefficient of the soils was too high for plant growth. Water–soluble and exchangeable manganese (Mn) concentrations of WTRs and cultivation soils differed largely between the two water purification plants. These Mn concentrations of the cultivation soils were high enough to cause Mn toxicity in plants. In the <b>bark</b> <b>compost</b> mixture soils, the water–soluble and exchangeable Mn concentrations were lower than those in the WTRs; the same characteristic of the Mn concentrations was also observed in the P fertilizer mixture soils. Concerning the vegetable growth experiment, almost no vegetables grew by using only the WTRs, and a positive effect of <b>bark</b> <b>compost</b> and P fertilizer mixtures on the vegetable growth was recognized.

The chemical, physical and microbial properties, as well as the economical impact of 11 organic and inorganic packing materials potentially suitable for biofiltration, have been investigated in order to select the most relevant for the treatment of rendering gaseous emissions. Fibrous materials such as peat and coconut fibres are predisposed to compaction.

40|$|Thermophilic {{composting}} (TC) and vermicomposting (V) are the {{two most}} common methods used for biological stabilization of solid organic wastes. Both have their advantages and disadvantages but the proposed method of combining composting and vermicomposting (CV) borrows pertinent attributes from each of the two methods and combines them to enhance overall process and product qualities. Dairy manure and waste paper are two wastes produced in large quantities at the University of Fort Hare. The study was carried out to address the following specific objectives, to determine (i) the effectiveness of combined thermophilic composting and vermicomposting on the biodegradation and sanitization of mixtures of dairy manure and paper waste, (ii) an optimum precomposting period for dairy manure paper waste mixtures that results in vermicomposts of good nutritional quality and whose use will not jeopardize human health, (iii) the effectiveness of phosphate rock (PR) in increasing available P and degradation and nutrient content of dairy manure-paper vermicomposts, (iv) the physicochemical properties of vermicompost substituted pine <b>bark</b> <b>compost</b> and performance of resultant growing medium on plant growth and nutrient uptake. Results of this study revealed that wastes with a C: N ratio of 30 were more suitable for both V and CV as their composts were more stabilized and with higher nutrient contents than composts made from wastes with a C: N ratio of 45. Both V and CV were effective methods for the biodegradation of dairy manure and paper waste mixtures with C: N ratio of 30 but the latter was more effective in the biodegradation of waste mixtures with a C: N ratio of 45. The combinination of composting and vermicomposting eliminated the indicator pathogen E. coli 0157 from the final composts whereas V only managed to reduce the pathogen population. iv A follow up study was done {{to determine the effects of}} precomposting on pathogen numbers so as to come up with a suitable precomposting period to use when combine composting dairy manure-waste paper mixtures. Results of this study showed that over 95 % of fecal coliforms, E. coli and of E. coli 0157 were eliminated from the wastes within one week of precomposting and total elimination of these and protozoan (oo) cysts achieved after 3 weeks of precomposting. The vermicomposts pathogen content was related to the waste’s precomposting period. Final vermicomposts pathogen content was reduced and varied according to precomposting period. Vermicomposts from wastes precomposted for over two weeks were less stabilized, less humified and had less nutrient contents compared to vermicomposts from wastes that were precomposted for one week or less. The findings suggest that a precomposting period of one week is ideal for the effective vermicomposting of dairy manure-waste paper mixtures. Results of the P enrichment study indicated an increase in the inorganic phosphate and a reduction in the organic phosphate fractions of dairy manure-waste paper vermicompost that were enriched with PR. This implied an increase in mineralization of organic matter and or solubilization of PR with vermicomposting time. Applying PR to dairy manure-waste paper mixtures also enhanced degradation and had increased N and P contents of dairy manure-waste paper vermicomposts. Earthworms accumulated heavy metals in their bodies and reduced heavy metal contents of vermicomposts. A study to determine the physicochemical properties of vermicompost substituted pine <b>bark</b> <b>compost</b> and performance of resultant growing medium on plant growth and nutrient uptake was done. Results obtained revealed that increasing proportions of dairy manure vermicomposts in pine <b>bark</b> <b>compost</b> improved tomato plant height, stem girth, shoot and root dry weights. v Tomatoes grew best in the 40 to 60 % CV substituted pine bark and application of Horticote (7 : 2 : 1 (22)) fertilizer significantly increased plant growth in all media. Progressive substitution pine bark with dairy manure vermicomposts resulted in a decrease in the percentage total porosity, percentage air space whilst bulk density, water holding capacity, particle density, pH, electrical conductivity and N and P levels increased. Precomposting wastes not only reduced and or eliminated pathogens but also improved the stabilisation and nutrient content of dairy manure waste paper mixtures. The application of PR to dairy manure waste paper mixtures improved the chemical and physical properties of vermicomposts. Earthworms bio-accumulated the heavy metals Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn whilst the contents of these in the vermicomposts declined. It is, therefore, recommended that dairy manure waste paper mixtures be precomposted for one week for sanitization followed by PR application and vermicomposting for stabilization and improved nutrients contents of resultant vermicomposts. Substitution of pine <b>bark</b> <b>compost</b> with 40 to 60 % PR-enriched vermicompost produced a growing medium with superior physical and chemical properties which supported good seedling growth.

In the present study, we focus on determining the effective properties of heterogeneous porous media at the Darcy scale with an analysis of their uncertainties. Preliminary, experimental measurements of the hydraulic properties of each component of the heterogeneous medium are obtained. The properties of the effective medium, representing an equivalent homogeneous material, are determined numerically by simulating a water flow in a three-dimensional representation of the heterogeneous medium, under steady-state scenarios and using its component properties. One of the major aspects {{of this study is}} to take into account the uncertainties of these properties in the computation and evaluation of the effective properties. This is done using a bootstrap method. Numerical evaporation experiments are conducted both on the heterogeneous and on the effective homogeneous materials to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. First, the impact of the uncertainties of the component properties on the simulated water matric potential is found to be high for the heterogeneous material configuration. Second, it is shown that the strategy developed herein leads to a reduction of this impact.

We used a heating wire and a thermostat for the root-zone heating. Four heating treatments were set after transplanting: 24 h constant heating; CH, early morning (03 : 00 - 09 : 00) heating; MH, daytime (09 : 00 - 15 : 00) heating; DH, and non-heating; NH. The treatments were continued after transplanting through harvesting. The thermostat for root-zone heating was set at 15 °C during the heating time. In CH and MH, the fresh weights of plants and the marketable part weights were larger than NH significantly. There were no significant difference in marketable part weights in CH and MH. We thought that MH was more effective in celery growth than other treatments, because the ratio of the difference in marketable part weights (dW) from NH to the diifference in root-zone temperature (dT) from NH was significantly larger than CH and DH. We also thought that maintaining favourable root-zone temperature from the morning to the evening was effective, and that at night was a little effective, in celery growth. The electricity consumption for the root-zone heating in DH was the lowest. However, the electricity cost was the lowest in MH, thanks to the dual fee system for electricity.

Soil samples collected from two abandoned mining areas near Madrid (Spain) were mixed with 0, 30 and 60 t ha? 1 of the organic amendments. The concentrations of metals among the different mineral and organic fractions of soil were determined by several extraction procedures to study the metal distribution in the solid phase of the soil affected by the organic amendments. The results showed that the manure amendment increased the soil pH and the cation exchange capacity and enhanced the nutrient levels of these soils. The pine bark amendment decreased the soil pH and did not significantly change the nutrient status of soil. Soil pH, organic matter content and its degree of humification, which were altered by the amendments, were the main factors affecting Cu fractionation. Zn fractionation was mainly affected by soil pH. The addition of manure not only improved soil fertility, but also decreased metal bioavailability resulting in a reduction of metal toxicity.

Cucumber roots from the suppressive medium had higher proportions of cis-vaccenic acid (18 : 1 ω 7 c) and the iso-branched monoenoic fatty acid i 17 : 1 ω 8 but lower proportions of several iso- and anteiso-branched fatty acids compared with roots from the conducive medium. The concentrations of the bacterial fatty acids were significantly lower in the surrounding media. However, the suppressive and conducive growth substrates had differences {{in the composition of}} the bacterial fatty acids similar to those found between the cucumber roots proper. These results suggest major differences in bacterial community composition between suppressive and conducive systems. Fatty acid analyses were also utilized to examine the effects on bacterial community composition of root colonization by Flavobacterium balustinum 299, a biocontrol agent. The concentration of the most prominent fatty acid in this bacterium, i 17 : 1 ω 8, was increased on roots produced from inoculated seeds in a medium rendered suppressive by the treatment. This change was concomitant with {{a significant increase in the}} concentration of 18 : 1 ω 7 c, not present in the lipids of the antagonist, indicating a shift in the microflora from a conducive to a suppressive bacterial community...|$|E
50|$|Akadama (red ball earth) is a {{naturally}} occurring, granular clay-like mineral used as soil for bonsai trees and other container-grown plants. It is surface-mined, immediately sifted and bagged, and supplied in various grades: the deeper-mined grade being somewhat harder and more useful in horticulture {{than the more}} shallow-mined grades. Akadama may also act as one component of growing medium when combined with other elements such as sand, <b>composted</b> <b>bark,</b> peat, or crushed lava. Akadama’s colour darkens when moist which can help the grower determine when to water a tree.|$|R

They were: Fibraflor® (commercial substrate), Turfa Fértil FG 2 ® (commercial substrate), vermiculite, coconut fiber from the pericarp, decomposed pine <b>bark,</b> organic <b>compost,</b> sphagnum and shredded xaxim, {{in the establishment}} of seedlings of Phalaenopsis amabilis L., in combination, with and without immersion of the seedlings, after they were removed from the growth flasks, in Manzate 800 at a dosage of 1 g L 1. The evaluated parameters were: the sum of the lengths of the two largest leaves, the sum of the lengths of the three largest roots and the percentage of surviving seedlings, evaluated at 190 days after planting. It was observed that there were significant differences between substrates, and sphagnum and shredded xaxim were the best in performance. The application of Manzate 800 showed interaction with substrates, but the isolated effect was not significant. Sphagnum is also an extractive product, but when it is impossible to obtain, an organic compost such as Turfa Fértil FG 2 ® or Fibraflor® can be used, with the necessary application of Manzate 800. Eight substrates were evaluated for ex-vitro establishment of Phalaenopsis amabilis seedlings.

40|$|The water {{potential}} at soil-root interface (Ψ_), indicates soil water availability {{at the point}} of contact between the root and the soil. It is important in the pathway of water flow from the soil through the plant to the air. In this study, relations of Ψ_ with bulk soil {{water potential}} (Ψ_), xylem water potential (Ψ_), and stomatal conductance (g_s) were established to estimate the value of Ψ_ and elucidate its response to soil texture. Three soil mixes made of <b>composted</b> <b>bark,</b> peat and sand (Mix- 1), peat, <b>bark,</b> sand and <b>compost</b> (Mix- 2), and peat, sawdust and sand (Mix- 3), were used with Prunus×cistena, an ornamental shrub. After soil water was depleted to different levels, Ψ_, Ψ_, g_s as well as transpiration rate (Tr) were measured. Ψ_ was calculated from these measured data. Plants grown in Mix- 2 maintained higher Ψ_ until Ψ_ decreased to - 24 kPa, while Ψ_ in the plants grown in Mix- 1 began to decrease at - 5 kPa of Ψ_. Mix- 3 showed a medium critical Ψ_ for Ψ_ to decrease. Since there was a better soil water availability, plants in Mix- 2 also showed a higher Ψ_ as well as higher gs and Tr as consequences. Plants in Mix- 2 maintained better plant wacer status mainly by avoiding water stress. Plants in Mix- 3 also avoided water stress, but it was, at least in part, attributed to less leaf area...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} surface area, micro-porosity, and surface {{chemical}} structure on the sorption of toluene vapor onto three model natural organic materials (NOMs), including two peats (CH and HS) and one tree <b>bark</b> <b>compost</b> (TB) were examined. The BET surface area, pore size distribution, element composition, sorption kinetics and isotherms, and carbon functionality (CP/MAS C- 13 -NMR spectra) were measured {{for the model}} organic matters. All the three NOMs have small BET-surface areas (below 5 m(2) g(- 1)), and small porosity (ranging from 0. 6 to 3. 4 cm(3) g(- 1)). Sorption of toluene vapor on NOMs was found to reach equilibrium in about one hour. A weak interaction (van der Waals' forces) was found between toluene and the three NOMs, with sorption uptake {{in the order of}} peat CH > compost TB > peat HS. This toluene uptake order is similar to that for pore volume. Compared to the pore size distribution data measured by liquid nitrogen, sorption of toluene vapor onto the model NOMs may be attributed to the mechanisms similar to that for nitrogen adsorption, suggesting that nitrogen may be used as a probe for determining the sorption of toluene on the three NOMs. For peat HS and compost TB, the sorption processes may be regarded as 'pore-filling' in a glassy phase SOM. In addition, based on the functional group composition analysis with CP/MAS-C- 13 -NMR, it was not aromatic carbon group but the alkyl carbon group that probably supplied a more flexible space (rubbery phase SOM) for toluene to penetrate. This flexible space may contribute somewhat to the sorption capacity so that the uptake of toluene by peat CH is higher than that of nitrogen...|$|E
