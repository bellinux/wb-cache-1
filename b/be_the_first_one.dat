Captain Bonser was having none of it and he rammed Mount Royal several times. Johnson lost control and the current carried her back downstream, bow first. Bonser wagged Hazelton’s stern at Mount Royal, tooted the whistle and continued triumphantly upstream. Furious, Johnson left the pilothouse unattended to retrieve a rifle and shot at the departing Hazelton. Afterwards, Johnson laid charges on Bonser claiming he deliberately rammed Mount Royal.

If Kevin says {{something}} I disagree with, he'll <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>one</b> to say, 'Hey, it's your song,' but it's healthy for me and Chris to have him come in and be as excited about our songs as we are and say, 'Okay, that's cool, but what if we tried this?'" [...] At his first meeting with the band, Shirley described the songs played for him as having [...] "the same old jammy, shuffle feel of the last two records. [...] I stopped them then and I said to them... 'You've got to feel like you're teenagers again. You need a song like that.'" [...] Shirley's prompting led the band to write [...] "Kickin' My Heart Around" [...] on the spot, before he had signed on to produce.

2500|$|On January 7, 2007, Tebow was {{featured}} prominently in an ESPN Outside The Lines feature on home-schooled athletes seeking {{equal access to}} high school athletics in other states. Because a home-schooler's access to public and private school athletic functions vary by state, Tebow and former defensive end Jason Taylor (who was allowed to play at his local high school in Pennsylvania) argued in favor of extending the right to play for local teams to more states. Upon becoming the first home-schooled athlete to be nominated for the Heisman Trophy, he remarked, [...] "That's really cool. A lot of times people have this stereotype of home-schoolers as not very athletic – it's like, go win a spelling bee {{or something like that}} – it's an honor for me to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>one</b> to do that."

2500|$|On 29 July 1966, {{production}} concluded on {{the final}} episode of The Smugglers, the last serial recorded in the third production block. During production, Hartnell and producer Innes Lloyd had reached an agreement that he should leave the role, having starred in one more serial that would see a handover to a new actor, which would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>one</b> produced as part of Season 4. Script editor Gerry Davis proposed that, since the Doctor had already been established as an alien, the character could die and return in a new body. Lloyd took this further by suggesting that the Doctor could do this [...] "renewal" [...] regularly, transforming from an older man to a younger one; {{this would allow for}} the convenient recasting of the role when necessary.

Some United States naval officers have pointed out that [...] "Naval Telecommunications Procedures: Flags, Pennants and Customs" [...] states that the [...] "Navy allows American ships to lower their flags if returning a salute, but not to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>one</b> to dip their colors."

As a matter of fact, you're the one who's picking a fight. Secondly, the country where you are elected as President by 16 million out of 100+ million is Third World. You talk as if the Philippines is a superpower. Excuse me, we don't want to go hungry. If you want, you do it yourself. Leave us out of it. So many people have nothing to eat, and yet you'll starve us even further". Her sentiments were echoed by Senator Panfilo Lacson adding that [...] "if the economy worsen, the entire Filipino people will be affected, they will go hungry as well".|$|E
