Genetic counseling benefits these individuals by updating their knowledge, seeking to dispel any unfounded <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> they may have, and helping them consider their future options and plans.

5|$|Christian doctrines {{include the}} <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> Jesus was {{conceived}} by the Holy Spirit, {{was born of}} a virgin named Mary, performed miracles, founded the Church, died by crucifixion as a sacrifice to achieve atonement, rose from the dead, and ascended into Heaven, from where he will return. Most Christians believe Jesus enables humans to be reconciled to God. The Nicene Creed asserts that Jesus will judge {{the living and the}} dead either before or after their bodily resurrection, an event tied to the Second Coming of Jesus in Christian eschatology. The great majority of Christians worship Jesus as the incarnation of God the Son, the second of three persons of a Divine Trinity. A minority of Christian denominations reject Trinitarianism, wholly or partly, as non-scriptural.|$|E
5|$|In such studies, and {{in general}} Latter Day Saint parlance, the -suffixed terms Josephite and Brighamite {{have been used for}} the Missouri-based Community of Christ and the Utah-based LDS Church respectively; these terms have {{sometimes}} been used to distinguish groups of denominations as well. Those denominations within each group share a common ancestry and basic <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> are different from groups sharing other provenances. The present article, in a similar fashion, distinguishes among groups of denominations by use of commonly understood names such as Mormon fundamentalist or else by short descriptions that often reference a founder of the first church within a factional group–for example, Joseph Smith III in reference to Community of Christ as well as various churches and factions that trace their origin to it.|$|E

5|$|Various {{evolutionary}} ideas {{had already}} been proposed to explain new findings in biology. There was growing support for such ideas among dissident anatomists and the general public, but {{during the first half}} of the 19th century the English scientific establishment was closely tied to the Church of England, while science was part of natural theology. Ideas about the transmutation of species were controversial as they conflicted with the <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> species were unchanging parts of a designed hierarchy and that humans were unique, unrelated to other animals. The political and theological implications were intensely debated, but transmutation was not accepted by the scientific mainstream.|$|E

Grimley comments that they had much in common, both spending years as isolated figures speaking out for <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> were dismissed {{at the time and}} later vindicated. As prime minister, Churchill persuaded Henson out of retirement in 1940 to resume his old duties as a Canon of Westminster Abbey. After overcoming the momentary strangeness of being back in his old post after nearly thirty years he preached with vigour until cataracts made his eyesight too poor to continue. He retired from the Abbey in 1941.|$|E

5|$|Durkheim's {{period in}} Germany {{resulted}} in the publication of numerous articles on German social science and philosophy; Durkheim was particularly impressed {{by the work of}} Wilhelm Wundt. Durkheim's articles gained recognition in France, and he received a teaching appointment in the University of Bordeaux in 1887, where he was to teach the university's first social science course. His official title was Chargé d'un Cours de Science Sociale et de Pédagogie and thus he taught both pedagogy and sociology (the latter had never been taught in France before). The appointment of the social scientist to the mostly humanistic faculty was an important sign of the change of times, and also the growing importance and recognition of the social sciences. From this position Durkheim helped reform the French school system and introduced the study of social science in its curriculum. However, his controversial <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> religion and morality could be explained in terms purely of social interaction earned him many critics.|$|E
5|$|The aye-aye {{is almost}} universally viewed unfavorably across Madagascar, though the tales vary from village to village and region to region. If people see an aye-aye, they may kill it and hang the corpse on a pole near a road {{outside of town}} (so others can carry the bad {{fortunes}} away) or burn their village and move. The superstitions behind aye-aye fady include <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> they kill and eat chickens or people, that they kill people in their sleep by cutting their aortic vein, that they embody ancestral spirits, or that they warn of illness, death, or bad luck in the family. As of 1970, {{the people of the}} Marolambo District in the Toamasina Province feared the aye-aye because they believed it had supernatural powers. Because of this, no one was allowed to mock, kill, or eat one.|$|E
5|$|Various esoteric {{organizations}} {{that emerged in}} the late 19th and early 20th centuries, such as the Theosophical Society and the Ancient and Mystical Order Rosae Crucis, repeated the <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> had originated with Sethos: that Egyptians underwent initiation within the pyramids and that Greek philosophers were initiates who learned Egypt's secret wisdom. Esoteric writers influenced by Theosophy, such as Reuben Swinburne Clymer in his 1909 book The Mystery of Osiris and Manly Palmer Hall in Freemasonry of the Ancient Egyptians in 1937, also wrote of an age-old Egyptian mystery tradition. An elaborate example of these beliefs is the 1954 book Stolen Legacy by George James, which claims that Greek philosophy was built on knowledge stolen from the Egyptian school of initiates. James imagined this mystery school as a grandiose organization with branches on many continents, so that the purported system of Egyptian mysteries shaped cultures all over the world.|$|E

All knowledge that we have is evidence. A piece of evidence supports a proposition p just in case it raises p's probability. A justified belief is a <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> complies with the fundamental norm of belief. The fundamental norm of belief is: one ought to believe that p if and only if one knows that p. It is not the case <b>that</b> one's <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> p is epistemically justified if and only if one's total evidence supports p and one's <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> p is appropriately based on one's evidence. Nevertheless, if one's <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> p is epistemically justified then one's total evidence supports p and one's <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> p is appropriately based on one's evidence.
