50|$|The <b>built-in</b> <b>joinery</b> work, notably {{around the}} {{sanctuary}} {{end of the}} church and the gallery balustrading, is well-detailed. The earlier work is constructed in cedar and pine while later work around the front entry porch including a panelled dado and screen is of silky oak. The most recent work such as hymn directory boards are in Queensland maple. The pews are of traditional design in pine.|$|E
50|$|These details include early <b>built-in</b> <b>joinery</b> {{cabinets}} {{that can}} be found throughout the house. A linen press extends to the ceiling in the hallway, a former servery, cupboards and a pantry/broom cupboard extends to the ceiling in the kitchen, a wardrobe with storage cupboards extends to the ceiling in the main bedroom and a cupboard in the parlor. All rooms in Monkton have walls lined with v-jointed boards and ceilings of fiber-cement with cover strips.|$|E
50|$|Lighting and {{ventilating}} {{the inner}} {{rooms of the}} second floor (nursery, bath and commode) may have challenged Wright, because they don't adjoin exterior walls or the roof. A 6-foot-square (2m-square) central light well reaches from the roof skylight through the third floor to light and ventilate the bath. The nursery's wall with the master bedroom aligns with the upper penthouse wall, and has clerestory windows to the roof terrace. Inhabitants report that the commode, closets {{and other parts of}} the inner rooms are lit and ventilated by clerestories to the light well or roof terrace, concealed in <b>built-in</b> <b>joinery.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1952 the Oslo Lunch Room was {{converted}} for domestic science lessons. The verandah was enclosed with vertical timber boards and glass louvre windows {{to form a}} teacher's room and fitting room and a laundry. Casement windows with operable fanlights {{were added to the}} eastern gable end wall and high-level glass louvres were added to the west gable end wall. New doors and <b>built-in</b> sinks and <b>joinery</b> were added. In 1964 the Oslo Lunch Room {{was converted}} for use as a tuckshop.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} features of Chadwick House is the two verandas facing east and south-east overlooking the garden. The verandas have an unusual double ox-bow balustrading. The tiled roof is a collection of gabled and hip roofs. The lower part of the house is clad with double beveled weatherboards while the upper part comprises rough cast panels separated by vertical timbers and this pattern is extended to the gables. The house exhibits many technological innovations including wall recessed, sliding window sashes, modular wall-framing and convection heating vents to the fireplaces. The large timber door which slides to conceal the front dining room is further evidence of the technical innovation employed in the house. The house has a balloon frame construction which was introduced to Australia from California in the mid-nineteenth century. The weatherboards and timber are charcoal grey, the veranda balustrades are yellow and the panels of rough cast are orange/ochre in colour. The interior is an open plan design which at the time was a radical departure from contemporary designs. There is no extended hallway but rather a small entrance hall from which the main living areas are accessed. From these rooms there is access to the kitchen and bedrooms. The sloping site allowed two rooms to be built under the main house. Their initial use was as office space for Desbrowe-Annear. Much of the interior comprises dark stained timber with a raked timber lined ceiling and <b>built-in</b> <b>joinery.</b> Until 1988 much of the original timber work was lost under layers of paint and plaster or had been removed. The renovations took place over a ten-year period and endeavoured to restore the building to its original condition. In some cases appropriate timber had to be sourced to replace and repair the initial ‘improvements’.|$|E
