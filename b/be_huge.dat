They were also divided about the reasons behind the absence of mass protests in Manama, some blaming it on the security forces, others on protest organizers.|$|E

Any resources, such as fossil oil, minerals and metals, within this area can be freely dug up by anyone and sold without needing to pay any commission to the (now dissolved) island state.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} year, 400 beer houses opened and within eight years there were 46,000 across the country, far outnumbering the {{combined}} total of long-established taverns, pubs, inns and hotels. Because {{it was so}} easy to obtain permission and the profits could <b>be</b> <b>huge</b> compared to the low cost of gaining permission, the number of beer houses was continuing to rise and in some towns nearly every other house in a street could be a beer house. Finally in 1869 the growth had to be checked by magisterial control and new licensing laws were introduced. Only then was it made harder to get a licence, and the licensing laws which operate today were formulated.|$|E
25|$|Birmingham {{has been}} a centre for the {{printing}} of books {{at least as far}} back as the 1650s, and the area's earliest notable contribution to design was in the field of typography, where it achieved international importance in the 18th Century and played a prominent role in the rise of English influence in a field previously dominated by German, Italian, French and Dutch designers. William Caslon – the designer of the Caslon typefaces and the first significant English typographer – came from nearby Cradley, and almost certainly trained as an engraver in Birmingham in the years before 1716. Most notable however was the Birmingham printer John Baskerville, who designed the Baskerville typeface in 1754. The influence of this type design across Europe would <b>be</b> <b>huge</b> as one of the key milestones in the transition from the old-style typefaces of Fournier to the modern-style type of Bodoni and Didot, and it is a font still widely used today in applications from the logo of New York's Metropolitan Opera to the branding of the Federal Government of Canada. Several of Baskerville's employees went on to become type designers themselves, most notably William Martin, whose Bulmer typeface is also still widely used.|$|E

I am proud of that album because I hear it now and it still feels current. It doesn't feel dated." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1982, Madonna {{was working}} with {{producer}} Reggie Lucas on her debut album. She had already composed three songs, when Lucas brought {{one of his own}} compositions to the project, calling it [...] "Borderline". However, after recording the song, Madonna was unhappy with the final version. According to her, Lucas used too many instruments and did not consider her ideas for the song. This led to a dispute between the two. After finishing the album, Lucas left the project without altering the songs to Madonna's specifications. Hence, Madonna brought her then boyfriend John [...] "Jellybean" [...] Benitez to remix [...] "Borderline" [...] and two other recorded tracks. On hearing the final version, Seymour Stein, head of Sire Records declared, [...] "I dared to believe this was going to <b>be</b> <b>huge</b> beyond belief, the biggest thing I'd ever had, after I heard 'Borderline'...

500|$|The {{decoding}} of the extraterrestrial message, {{with its}} architectural {{drawings of the}} machine, was created by Ken Ralston and Sony Pictures Imageworks. This is the sixth film collaboration between director Zemeckis and VFX supervisor Ralston.

On designing the Machine, Zemeckis explained that [...] "The Machine in Sagan's novel was somewhat vague, which is fine for a book.

[...] He continued that [...] "it had to <b>be</b> <b>huge,</b> so that the audience would feel like it was bigger than man should be tinkering with. It had to look absolutely real."

These were at times altered weekly due to the reactions of test audiences in screenings. CIS Visual Effects Group assisted with the Scorcher VI faux trailer and twenty additional shots for the home media release. To expand on the comedy in the film, some of the explosions and crashes were embellished to look more destructive. The visual effects supervisor Michael Fink reflected on the exaggerated explosions: [...] "We worked really {{hard to make the}} CG crashing helicopter in the hot landing sequence look real. Ben was adamant about that, {{but at the same time}} he wanted the explosion to <b>be</b> <b>huge.</b> When you see it hit the ground, it was like it was filled with gasoline! It was the same thing with Ben's sergeant character, who almost intercepts a hand grenade... Now, I was in the Army for three years and no hand grenade would make an explosion like that... But it was a big dramatic moment and it looks really cool... and feels kind of real." ...|$|E

Despite significant shifts in mainstream {{music at the}} beginning of the 1990s, 1993's Get a Grip was just as successful commercially, becoming their first album to debut at number 1 and racking up sales of 7 million copies in a two-and-a-half-year timespan. The first singles were the hard rocking [...] "Livin' on the Edge" [...] and [...] "Eat the Rich".
