5|$|Animals such as {{horses and}} deer {{are among the}} {{earliest}} subjects of art, <b>being</b> <b>found</b> in the Upper Paleolithic cave paintings such as at Lascaux.

5|$|C.mutica {{were also}} {{discovered}} in Ketchikan, Sitka, Juneau, Cordova, Kodiak, Kachemak Bay, Prince William Sound, and Unalaska in Alaska between 2000 and 2003. This {{was the first}} instance of a non-native marine species <b>being</b> <b>found</b> in the Aleutian Islands. In 2009, they were discovered to have spread into British Columbia, Canada. This indicates that C.mutica have completely expanded up the entire west coast of North America.|$|E
5|$|Concentrations {{of heavy}} metals below the crust are {{generally}} higher, with most <b>being</b> <b>found</b> in the largely iron-silicon-nickel core. Platinum, for example, comprises approximately 1 part per {{billion of the}} crust whereas its concentration in the core {{is thought to be}} nearly 6,000 times higher. Recent speculation suggests that uranium (and thorium) in the core may generate a substantial amount of the heat that drives plate tectonics and (ultimately) sustains the Earth's magnetic field.|$|E

5|$|Food-borne {{pathogens}} {{that can}} survive on lettuce include Listeria monocytogenes, the causative agent of listeriosis, which multiplies in storage. However, despite {{high levels of}} bacteria <b>being</b> <b>found</b> on ready-to-eat lettuce products, a 2008 study found no incidences of food-borne illness related to listeriosis, possibly due to the product's short shelf life, indigenous microflora competing with the Listeria bacteria or inhibition of bacteria to cause listeriosis.|$|E
5|$|Harper's Cabinet was {{defeated}} in a no-confidence vote on March 25, 2011, after <b>being</b> <b>found</b> in contempt of parliament. Harper thus, in accordance with constitutional convention, advised the Governor General to call a general election. This was the first occurrence in Commonwealth history of a government in the Westminster parliamentary tradition losing {{the confidence of the}} lower house on the grounds of contempt of parliament. The no-confidence motion was carried with a vote of 156 in favour of the motion and 145 against.|$|E

5|$|In {{both their}} native and {{introduced}} ranges, C.mutica are also synanthropic, <b>being</b> <b>found</b> abundantly in fouling communities in artificial structures like submerged ropes, fishing nets, pilings, docks, buoys, aquaculture equipment, oil rig platforms, ship hulls, and even offshore wind farms. In their introduced ranges (particularly in Europe), they are primarily and even exclusively found inhabiting artificial structures.|$|E
5|$|In other instances, {{managers}} deliberately {{used the}} reforms {{as an opportunity}} to cut wages, exaggerating wage cuts made by the ministries so that {{they would be able to}} cut back on overall expenditure. In one case, a manager of a concrete factory was sentenced to eight months corrective labour after <b>being</b> <b>found</b> guilty of using the reforms as a pretext to extract unpaid overtime from workers.|$|E

In Israel it grows in the Judean desert, the Dead Sea Valley, the Negev hills and Eilat.|$|E
5|$|Mary Celeste was not {{the first}} {{reported}} case of a ship <b>being</b> <b>found</b> strangely deserted on the high seas. Rupert Gould, a naval officer and investigator of maritime mysteries, lists several such occurrences between 1840 and 1855. Whatever the truth of these stories, it is the Mary Celeste that is remembered; the ship's name, or the misspelt Marie Celeste, has become fixed in people's minds as synonymous with inexplicable desertion.|$|E

5|$|The {{distribution}} of the antbirds is entirely Neotropical, with {{the vast majority of}} the species <b>being</b> <b>found</b> in the tropics. A few species reach southern Mexico and northern Argentina.
