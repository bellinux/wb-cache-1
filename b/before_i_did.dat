It's {{a way for}} me to remain blessedly free of conscience. But for me the beauty of that scene was that we really dared to get into it. Typically in TV shows we skim over the edges of issues like water spiders, spouting platitudes and spouting unearned 'clarifying' emotions. But there were no violins strumming in 'Black and Blue'." ...|$|E

The second time I went it was Barry Weiss, Jay, Beyoncé, Kanye, couple other people, it was a pretty heavy room." ...|$|E

Two pilots were taped on February 13, 2002: one with original Press Your Luck host Peter Tomarken and the other hosted by Todd Newton. Newton was ultimately chosen to host the show. Tomarken explained that he was asked to change his style of hosting, saying, [...] "It was terribly hurtful and I think I was doomed <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> [...] I remember being told, 'No, no. Be nice. Be sure everybody likes you.' I took that advice with the pilot. I made the same mistake." [...] Tomarken also acknowledged that GSN wanted to employ a younger host in an effort to attract a younger audience.|$|E

2500|$|In a 1984 {{interview}} Kirby said [...] "I did {{a version}} of Thor for D.C. in the fifties <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> him for Marvel. I created Thor at Marvel because I was forever enamored of legends, which is why I knew about Balder, Heimdall, and Odin. I tried to update Thor and put him into a superhero costume, {{but he was still}} Thor." [...] The story was included in Tales of the Unexpected #16, from 1957; and although the character had a different design, some details would be reused by Kirby when he created the Marvel Comics version. And in a 1992 interview, Kirby said [...] " [...] knew the Thor legends very well, but I wanted to modernize them. I felt that might be a new thing for comics, taking the old legends and modernizing them." ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{the fourth}} round, Ali coasted, keeping his distance. However, when he {{returned}} to his corner, he started complaining that there was something burning in his eyes and he could not see. [...] "I didn't know what the heck was going on", Angelo Dundee, Ali's trainer, recalled on an NBC special 25 years later. [...] "He said, 'cut the gloves off. I want to prove to the world there's dirty work afoot.' And I said, 'whoa, whoa, back up baby. C'mon now, this is for the title, this is the big apple. What are you doing? Sit down!' So I get him down, I get the sponge and I pour the water into his eyes trying to cleanse whatever's there, but <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> that I put my pinkie in his eye and I put it into my eye. It burned like hell. There was something caustic in both eyes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Aguilera {{made many}} {{appearances}} {{on talk shows}} {{in order to promote}} her self-titled debut album. Aguilera appeared on shows such as The Rosie O'Donnell Show and TRL. Aguilera also began traveling to New Zealand while [...] "What a Girl Wants" [...] was topping the charts overseas. In 1999, Aguilera performed [...] "Genie in a Bottle" [...] at the 1999 Teen Choice Awards. Aguilera also attended the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, where she and Fred Durst performed together. Aguilera performed [...] "Come on Over Baby", wearing a tight ruby red outfit with black and red streaks in her hair, and near the end, Durst walked onstage and performed part of his band's song [...] "Livin' It Up" [...] with Aguilera. After eliciting charged reactions from his fans, Durst stated: [...] "I already told you guys <b>before,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it all for the nookie, man." [...] The feud died weeks later, when Aguilera denied Durst's statement, saying Durst [...] "got no nookie." [...] Later on, in 2000, Aguilera performed at the Super Bowl XXXIV as a halftime performer.|$|E
2500|$|King Hrothgar {{is portrayed}} by Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins noted in an {{interview}} that since Zemeckis is an American, he wasn't certain what accent Hopkins should use for the role of Hrothgar. Hopkins told him, [...] "Well, Welsh would be my closest because that's where I come from." [...] It was also his first time working with motion capture technology. Hopkins noted, [...] "I didn't know what was expected. It was explained to me, I'm not stupid, but I still don't get the idea of how it works. I have no idea [...] you don't have sets, so it is like being in a Brecht play, you know, with just bare bones and you have nothing else." [...] When asked if he had to read the original poem of Beowulf in school, Hopkins replied: [...] "No, I was hopeless at school. I couldn't read anything. I mean I could read, but I was so inattentive. I was one of those poor kids, you know, who was just very slow, didn't know what they were talking about... So I tried to get around to reading Beowulf just <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> this movie, and it was a good modern translation. It was Trevor Griffiths, I’m not sure, but I couldn't hack it, and I tend to like to just go with the script if it's a good script." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although Page {{recorded}} with many notable musicians, {{many of these}} early tracks are only available as bootleg recordings, several of which were released by the Led Zeppelin fan club in the late 1970s. One of the rarest {{of these is the}} early jam session featuring Jimmy Page and Stones guitarist Keith Richards covering Robert Johnson's [...] "Little Queen of Spades". Several early tracks with Page were compiled on the twin album release, [...] Page also {{recorded with}} Richards on guitar and vocals in Olympic Sound Studios on 15 October 1974. Along with Ric Grech on bass and Bruce Rowland on drums, a track called [...] "Scarlet" [...] was cut. Page reflected later in an interview with Rolling Stones Cameron Crowe: [...] "I did what could possibly be the next Stones B side. It was Ric Grech, Keith and me doing a number called [...] "Scarlet." [...] I can't remember the drummer. It sounded very similar in style and mood to those Blonde on Blonde tracks. It was great, really good. We stayed up all night and went down to Island Studios where Keith put some reggae guitars over one section. I just put some solos on it, but it was eight in the morning of the next day <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> that. He took the tapes to Switzerland and someone found out about them. Keith told people that it was a track from my album".|$|E
2500|$|Mireille {{was invited}} to Paris by the {{impresario}} Régis Durcourt to sing on the [...] "Song Parade" [...] television program, on 19 November 1965. Stark promised to write to her, but after months of waiting she gave up on him, and accepted Durcourt's offer. The truth has never been revealed how, but Mireille was suddenly moved-up to compete live on the Sunday 21 November 1965 episode of [...] "Jeu de la Chance," [...] a talent segment of the popular French program [...] "Télé-Dimanche." [...] Stark's ex-wife Nanou Taddéi worked at Studio 102, and probably recognized Mireille, as she participated in her earlier pre-audition. Mathieu explained that [...] "Song Parade" [...] offered only one chance to sing, while [...] "Jeu de la Chance" [...] offered many chances to sing, but only if she won, and she intended to win. Both the studio audience and telephone voters gave her a slight lead over five-time winner , so the producers called it a tie. Johnny Stark officially became her manager that night, and with his longtime assistant Nadine Joubert, helped prepare Mireille to win the contest the following week and bury Georgette. Stark and Lemaire had a mutual dislike for each other. In a short film called La guerre des Piaf (War of the Sparrows) Georgette and Mireille are interviewed separately, both are small and the same height. Mireille is surrounded by her sisters Monique and Christiane, with Johnny hovering in the background as she is interviewed {{for the first time}} on camera. She appears to be uncomfortable, staring at the floor during many of the questions, even looking dumbfounded once, like a deer in the headlights. Johnny finally comes to her rescue. In a later interview, she underscored the importance of the event, stating, [...] "For me, Paris was the end of the world. I never took a train or saw a camera <b>before.</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not know what the outcome of the adventure would be." ...|$|E
