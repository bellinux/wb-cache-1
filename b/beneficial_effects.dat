Similarly, pediatric clinical trials have reported <b>beneficial</b> <b>effects</b> on cognitive and immune outcomes.

5|$|The drug {{strontium}} ranelate aids bone growth, increases bone density, and {{lessen the}} incidence of vertebral, peripheral, and hip fractures. However, strontium ranelate also {{increases the risk of}} venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism and serious cardiovascular disorders, including myocardial infarction. Its use is therefore now restricted. Its <b>beneficial</b> <b>effects</b> are also questionable, since the increased bone density is partially caused by the increased density of strontium over the calcium which it replaces. Strontium also bioaccumulates in the body.|$|E
5|$|With {{erythromycin}} {{therapy in}} DPB, great reduction in bronchiolar inflammation and damage is achieved through suppression {{of not only}} neutrophil proliferation, but also lymphocyte activity and obstructive mucus and water secretions in airways. The antibiotic effects of macrolides {{are not involved in}} their <b>beneficial</b> <b>effects</b> toward reducing inflammation in DPB. This is evident because the treatment dosage is much too low to fight infection, and in DPB cases with the occurrence of macrolide-resistant P.aeruginosa, erythromycin therapy still reduces inflammation.|$|E

5|$|Among {{professional}} economists {{the revival}} of Keynesian economics has been even more divisive. Although many economists, such as George Akerlof, Paul Krugman, Robert Shiller, and Joseph Stiglitz, supported Keynesian stimulus, others did not believe higher government spending would help the United States economy recover from the Great Recession. Some economists, such as Robert Lucas, questioned the theoretical basis for stimulus packages. Others, like Robert Barro and Gary Becker, say that empirical evidence for <b>beneficial</b> <b>effects</b> from Keynesian stimulus does not exist. However, {{there is a growing}} academic literature that shows that fiscal expansion helps an economy grow in the near term, and that certain types of fiscal stimulus are particularly effective.|$|E
5|$|If {{the patient}} {{presents}} {{less than eight}} hours after paracetamol overdose, then acetylcysteine significantly {{reduces the risk of}} serious hepatotoxicity and guarantees survival. If acetylcysteine is started more than 8hours after ingestion, there is a sharp decline in its effectiveness because the cascade of toxic events in the liver has already begun, and the risk of acute liver necrosis and death increases dramatically. Although acetylcysteine is most effective if given early, it still has <b>beneficial</b> <b>effects</b> if given as late as 48hours after ingestion. In clinical practice, if the patient presents more than eight hours after the paracetamol overdose, then activated charcoal is not useful, and acetylcysteine is started immediately. In earlier presentations, charcoal can be given when the patient arrives and acetylcysteine is initiated while waiting for the paracetamol level results to return from the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Several anti-angiogenesis drugs {{approved}} for other conditions, such as cancer, {{have been investigated}} in small clinical trials. The anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab, for instance, has been used off-label in several studies.

Thalidomide, another anti-angiogenesis drug, was also reported to have <b>beneficial</b> <b>effects</b> in HHT patients. Thalidomide treatment was found to induce vessel maturation in an experimental mouse model of HHT and to reduce the severity and frequency of nosebleeds in the majority {{of a small group of}} HHT patients.

5|$|Festivals often {{involved}} a ceremonial procession {{in which a}} cult image was carried out of the temple in a barque-shaped shrine. These processions served various purposes. In Roman times, when local deities of all kinds were believed to have power over the Nile inundation, processions in many communities carried temple images to the riverbanks so the gods could invoke a large and fruitful flood. Processions also traveled between temples, as when the image of Hathor from Dendera Temple visited her consort Horus at the Temple of Edfu. Rituals for a god were often based in that deity's mythology. Such rituals {{were meant to be}} repetitions of the events of the mythic past, renewing the <b>beneficial</b> <b>effects</b> of the original events. In the Khoiak festival in honor of Osiris, his death and resurrection were ritually reenacted at a time when crops were beginning to sprout. The returning greenery symbolized the renewal of the god's own life.|$|E
5|$|Following summer floods of 1997 and the {{prolonged}} flooding of 1999-2000 the Parrett Catchment Project was formed, partly {{funded by the}} European Union Regional Development Fund, by 30 organisations, including British Waterways, Campaign to Protect Rural England, Countryside Agency, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Environment Agency, Kings Sedgemoor and Cary Vale Internal Drainage Board (now part of Parrett Internal Drainage Board), Levels and Moors Partnership, National Farmers Union, Sedgemoor, Somerset County Council, South Somerset District Council, Taunton Deane and Wessex Water. They aim to tackle twelve areas, which, when combined, will make {{a significant contribution to}} reducing the adverse effects of flooding. These include the conversion of arable land, adoption of the Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) approach to controlling rainwater runoff from developed areas, dredging, raising riverbanks and improving pumping facilities. Further studies of the possible <b>beneficial</b> <b>effects</b> of woodland in reducing flooding have also been undertaken.|$|E
5|$|While the {{detection}} of Mups excreted by other animals has been well studied, the functional role in the producing animal is less clear. However, in 2009, Mups were shown {{to be associated with}} the regulation of energy expenditure in mice. Scientists found that genetically induced obese, diabetic mice produce thirty times less Mup RNA than their lean siblings. When they delivered Mup protein directly into the bloodstream of these mice, they observed an increase in energy expenditure, physical activity and body temperature and a corresponding decrease in glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. They propose that Mups' <b>beneficial</b> <b>effects</b> on energy metabolism occurs by enhancing mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle. Another study found Mups were reduced in diet-induced obese mice. In this case, the presence of Mups in the bloodstream of mice restricted glucose production by directly inhibiting the expression of genes in the liver.|$|E

Topical estrogen {{has been found to}} have similar <b>beneficial</b> <b>effects</b> on the skin. In addition, a study has found that topical 2% progesterone cream significantly increases skin elasticity and firmness and observably decreases wrinkles in peri- and postmenopausal women.
