60|$|But {{they all}} felt that {{everything}} would at last be ruled by what the Solicitor-General might say. The Solicitor-General was going {{out of town for}} a week or ten days,--having the management of a great case at the Spring Assizes. He would think over Lady Anna's proposition, and say {{what he had to say}} when he returned. Lord Lovel, however, had been his client, and he had said from first to last that more was to be done for his client <b>by</b> <b>amicable</b> <b>arrangement</b> than by hostile opposition. If the Earl could get £10,000 a year <b>by</b> <b>amicable</b> <b>arrangement,</b> the Solicitor-General would be shown to have been right in the eyes of all men, and it was probable,--as both Mr. Goffe and Mr. Flick felt,--that he would not repudiate a settlement of the family affairs by which he would be proved to have been a discreet counsellor.|$|E
6000|$|But {{the great}} Master Dramatist had {{secretly}} another intention for the piece; {{by the most}} violent and complicated solution, in which death and birth and sudden fame all play a part as interposing deities, the act-drop fell upon a scene of transformation. Jean was brought to bed of twins, and, <b>by</b> an <b>amicable</b> <b>arrangement,</b> the Burnses took the boy to bring up by hand, while the girl remained with her mother. The success of the book was immediate and emphatic; it put £20 at once into the author's purse; and he was encouraged upon all hands to go to Edinburgh and push his success in a second and larger edition. Third and last in these series of interpositions, a letter came one day to Mossgiel Farm for Robert. He {{went to the window}} to read it; a sudden change came over his face, and he left the room without a word. Years afterwards, when the story began to leak out, his family understood that he had then learned the death of Highland Mary. Except in a few poems and a few dry indications purposely misleading as to date, Burns himself made no reference to this passage of his life; it was an adventure of which, for I think sufficient reasons, he desired to bury the details. Of one thing we may be glad: in after years he visited the poor girl's mother, and left her with the impression that he was [...] "a real warm-hearted chield." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "From your {{somewhat}} dishevelled appearance," [...] Bellamy continued, [...] "I think I may {{conclude that}} you were not able to come to any <b>amicable</b> <b>arrangement</b> with Mademoiselle's visitor. He declined to accept you as her proxy, I imagine. Still, one must make sure." ...|$|R
60|$|Nevertheless, in the morning, {{when the}} two armies were arrayed {{in the order of}} battle, the king sent the Abbot of Shrewsbury to propose an <b>amicable</b> <b>arrangement.</b> Hotspur and Douglas, however, {{rejected}} the offer. The trumpets then blew on either side, and the armies joined battle.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are {{not quite}} abreast of the {{progress}} of events, sir. Since the original drawing of names, there 'as been a trifling hadjustment. The boy Albert now 'as Mr. Byng and I 'ave you, sir. A little <b>amicable</b> <b>arrangement</b> informally conducted in the scullery {{on the night of}} the ball." ...|$|R
500|$|In 1818 he was {{appointed}} Political Agent for various states of western Rajputana, in the northwest of India, where the British East India Company had come to <b>amicable</b> <b>arrangements</b> with the Rajput rulers in order to exert indirect control over the area.

6000|$|... "No: that's {{not what}} I mean; but it'll come to {{much the same}} thing in the end. In the first place, you must {{withdraw}} all opposition to Miss Lynch's marriage; indeed, you must give it your direct sanction; and, in the next place, you must make an <b>amicable</b> <b>arrangement</b> with Martin about the division of the property." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "--Or at least," [...] said Lesley, proceeding, [...] "that {{it is not}} {{the name}} by which Mr. Lovel has been at all times distinguished--if Mr. Lovel will have the {{goodness}} to explain this circumstance, which, in my opinion, he should do in justice to his own character, I will answer for the <b>amicable</b> <b>arrangement</b> of this unpleasant business." ...|$|R
60|$|But in {{the morning}} some of this {{bitterness}} had worn away. His last resolve overnight had been {{to go to the}} brewery before breakfast, at which period of the day Mr. Tappitt was always to be found for half an hour in his counting-house, and curtly tell the brewer that all further negotiations between them must be made by their respective lawyers; but as he was dressing, he reflected that Mr. Tappitt's position was certainly one of difficulty, that <b>amicable</b> <b>arrangements</b> would still be best if <b>amicable</b> <b>arrangements</b> were possible, and that something was due to the man who had for so many years been his uncle's partner. Mr. Tappitt, moreover, was not responsible for any of those evil things which had been said about Rachel by Mrs. Tappitt. Therefore, priding himself somewhat on his charity, he entered Mr. Tappitt's office without the display of any anger on his face.|$|R
50|$|He {{was educated}} at Oxford and became {{secretary}} to Sir John Fastolf. When the knight died in 1459 Worcester, found that {{nothing had been}} bequeathed to him although {{he was one of}} his executors and, with one of his colleagues Sir William Yelverton, he disputed the validity of the will. However, an <b>amicable</b> <b>arrangement</b> was made and Worcester obtained some lands near Norwich and in Southwark. He died about 1482.|$|R
60|$|Ghak and Dacor {{reached a}} very <b>amicable</b> <b>arrangement,</b> {{and it was}} at a council of the head men of the various tribes of the Sari that the {{eventual}} form of government was tentatively agreed upon. Roughly, the various kingdoms were to remain virtually independent, but there was to be one great overlord, or emperor. It was decided that I should be the first of the dynasty of the emperors of Pellucidar.|$|R
6000|$|But Aby {{had not yet}} done: he had {{hitherto}} omitted {{to mention}} one not inconsiderable portion of the <b>amicable</b> <b>arrangement</b> which, according to him, would {{have the effect of}} once more placing the two families comfortably on their feet. [...] "There's one other pint, Sir Thomas," [...] he continued, [...] "and hif I can bring you and your good lady to my way of thinking on that, why, we may all be comfortable for all that is come and gone. You've a daughter Hemmeline." ...|$|R
50|$|Her third {{husband was}} a Latvian-German Baron Alf-Paul Oscar Wulffius (Vulffius/ Vulfius) of Salnavas, Latvia. He was killed by the Communists during the Second World War (1941). At this time Wulffius was living in Daugavpils and {{according}} to her son Paul his father was living with a pianist who was his father's mistress. It {{seemed to be an}} <b>amicable</b> <b>arrangement</b> with Wulffius staying with them both when she was in Riga. This may be the Galina Vulfius (b.1912) mentioned as being taken by the communists with Alf-Paul in 1941.|$|R
50|$|The North Church was in use {{until about}} 1718. Local {{accounts}} {{say that at}} one time there was an <b>amicable</b> <b>arrangement</b> for the church to be used for both Protestant and Roman Catholic worship, but that a dispute rose one wet Sunday, when Roman Catholics were unwilling to leave the church due to the rain, and free the church up for the Protestants. This displeased the Forde family so much that they dismantled the old church and built a new one in Seaforde which was roofed with the timbers of the old building.|$|R
50|$|In 2000, TVT {{became the}} first label to put its entire catalog online {{available}} for downloading and free streaming by fans. In 2001, the label reached an <b>amicable</b> <b>arrangement</b> with Napster for use of TVT's artist copyrights, and TVT's CEO joined the Napster advisory board. Gottlieb appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2001 on a panel that included Richard Parsons, then head of Time Warner and Ken Berry, head of EMI, and artists Alanis Morissette and Don Henley. CEO Gottlieb served on the Board of Directors of Musicmatch (sold to Yahoo!).|$|R
5000|$|On {{arrival in}} these new lands he {{encountered}} the KhoiKhoi (whom the Dutch named the Hottentots) and against whom fierce battles were fought over cattle and land. In {{the end and}} after killing the KhoKhoi leader Hinsati, Rharhabe reached an <b>amicable</b> <b>arrangement</b> and negotiated with Hinsati's widow, Queen Hoho for sale of land between the Keiskamma and Buffalo rivers. The Amathole Forests and Hoho Hills between Middle Drift and King William's Town were also sold to Rharhabe. Thus the Xhosa monarchy was, and still is, divided into the AmaGcaleka and the AmaRharhabe kingdoms.|$|R
5000|$|In 1818 he was {{appointed}} Political Agent for various states of western Rajputana, in the northwest of India, where the British East India Company had come to <b>amicable</b> <b>arrangements</b> with the Rajput rulers in order to exert indirect control over the area. The anonymous author of the introduction to Tod's posthumously published book, Travels in Western India, says that [...] Clothed with this ample authority, he applied himself to the arduous task of endeavouring to repair the ravages of foreign invaders who still lingered {{in some of the}} fortresses, to heal the deeper wounds inflicted by intestine feuds, and to reconstruct the framework of society in the disorganised states of Rajas'han.|$|R
50|$|Meidias endeavoured in all {{possible}} {{ways to prevent}} Demosthenes from discharging his office in its proper form. Their mutual relations soured even more when Demosthenes attempted to oppose the proposal for sending aid against Callias and Taurosthenes of Chalcis to Plutarch, the tyrant of Eretria, and the friend of Meidias. The breaking point arrived when Meidias violently attacked Demosthenes during {{the celebration of the}} great Dionysia. Such an act gave Demosthenes a good opportunity for moving a public incrimination against his enemy (353 BC), and on this occasion wrote Against Meidias, still extant, which was never pronounced as the two adversaries found an <b>amicable</b> <b>arrangement</b> under which Demosthenes retired his accusation for thirty minae.|$|R
5000|$|William Purvis {{was the son}} of John Purvis, a waterman, and Margaret Purvis (who died in All Saints Poorhouse aged over 100). William {{was born}} early in the year of 1752 in Newcastle, and baptised at All Saints' Church on 16 February 1752. He was either blind from birth, or very shortly after, {{although}} he often made comments from which the onlooker would think he could see. Very rarely did he perform in the street, preferring to perform in ale houses, in which he would depend on the charity of the public, but as he seemed to bring trade and the public appeared to like his ditties this seemed an <b>amicable</b> <b>arrangement.</b> He was apparently hatless in all weathers and to most of the locals and to his clientele he was just [...] "Blind Willie".|$|R
5000|$|A Special Survey of 20,000 {{acres of}} August 1845 on the Burra Creek was drawn up, {{and which was}} {{expected}} to encompass any potential mine sites. Two parties tendered for the mineral rights: the Association and the Princess Royal Company (dubbed the [...] "Nobs", these were much wealthier individuals), whose members were George F. Aston, John Grainger; Charles H. Bagot, Francis S. Dutton and other proprietors of the Kapunda mine; two (unnamed) English investors; Thomas Shepherd, Joseph Johnson, and George Tinline. George Morphett acted as Chairman, E. A. Wright as Secretary. An <b>amicable</b> <b>arrangement</b> was made between these two groups: that each should pay half the ₤20,000 in specie demanded by Governor Grey, that the surveyed area should be divided in two, which was done on 20 September 1845, and by some means it was resolved that the Association should have the northern moiety and the Princess Royal Company the southern.|$|R
60|$|His {{example was}} {{followed}} by a dozen others, who, being larger, outran him, and, performing a war-dance round the men, possessed themselves, <b>by</b> <b>amicable</b> theft, of pieces of raw meat with which they hastened back to the village. The original discoverer of the party, however, had other ends in view. He toddled straight up to Kambira with the outstretched arms of a child who knows he will be welcomed.|$|R
6000|$|Ojeda, when {{he heard}} of the {{approach}} of Roldan and Escobar, retired on board of his ships. Though of a daring spirit, he had no inclination, in the present instance, to come to blows, {{where there was a}} certainty of desperate fighting, and no gain; and where he must raise his arm against government. Roldan now issued such remonstrances as had often been ineffectually addressed to himself. He wrote to Ojeda, reasoning with him on his conduct, and the confusion he was producing in the island, and inviting him on shore to an <b>amicable</b> <b>arrangement</b> of all alleged grievances. Ojeda, knowing the crafty, violent character of Roldan, disregarded his repeated messages, and refused to venture within his power. He even seized one of his messengers, Diego de Truxillo, and landing suddenly at Xaragua, carried off another of his followers, named Toribio de Lenares; both of whom he detained in irons, on board of his vessel, as hostages for a certain Juan Pintor, a one-armed sailor, who had deserted, threatening to hang them if the deserter was not given up. [60] ...|$|R
60|$|Thus, <b>by</b> <b>amicable</b> and sagacious management, one of {{the most}} {{extensive}} provinces of the island was brought into cheerful subjection, and had not the wise policy of the Adelantado been defeated by the excesses of worthless and turbulent men, a large revenue might have been collected, without any recourse to violence or oppression. In all instances, these simple people appear to have been extremely tractable, and meekly and even cheerfully to have resigned their rights to the white men, when treated with gentleness and humanity.|$|R
50|$|Most of his papacy was {{characterized}} <b>by</b> <b>amicable</b> {{relations with the}} imperial government, and Fabian could thus bring back to Rome the bodies of Pope Pontian and the antipope Hippolytus, both of whom had died in exile in the Sardinian mines, for Christian burial. It was also probably during his reign that the schism between the two corresponding Roman congregations of these leaders was ended. He was highly esteemed by Cyprian; Novatian refers to his nobilissima memoriae, and he corresponded with Origen. One authority refers to him as Flavian.|$|R
60|$|Late in November {{yet another}} gentleman {{came to see}} her, but when he came she was {{unfortunately}} out. She had gone {{up to the house}} in Gower Street, and had there been so cross-questioned by the indefatigable Miss Colza that she had felt herself compelled to tell her sister-in-law that she could not again come there as long as Miss Colza was one of the family. It was manifest to her that these questions had been put on behalf of Mr Maguire, and she had therefore felt more indignant than she would have been had they originated in the impertinent curiosity of the woman herself. She also informed Mrs Mackenzie that, in obedience to instructions from Mr Slow, she intended to postpone her purpose with reference to the hospital till some time early in the next year. Mr Slow had sent a clerk to her to explain that till that time such <b>amicable</b> <b>arrangement</b> as that to which he looked forward to make could not be completed. On her return from this visit to Gower Street she found the card,--simply the card,--of her cousin, John Ball.|$|R
50|$|The {{incident}} meant {{everybody in}} the village knew what {{had been going on}} and, in disgust, Dawn ordered them to end the relationship and went on holiday to get away from them. However, Jean and Terry were in love and defied Dawn. When she returned, she announced she and T.J. were going to live in Cornwall, breaking Terry’s heart. He decided to fight for custody but Jean implored him not to hurt her daughter and between them, they came to an <b>amicable</b> <b>arrangement.</b> However, tragedy struck when Dawn died after being injured in the Kings River Showhome. Jean and Terry continued their relationship after Dawn's death but Jean soon tired of the relationship, life in the village and was sick of the controversy that had ensued over Dawn's death. Jean emigrated to Morocco in December 2006, taking T.J. with her as she felt Bob and Terry were ignoring him, after receiving £300,000 compensation for Dawn's death. Terry followed her to the airport {{but it was too late}} and Jean's flight was just leaving. However, Terry followed them and returned with T.J. several weeks later.|$|R
60|$|This {{was written}} and sent on a Wednesday, and nothing further was said either by Lucy herself, or by her aunt, {{as to the}} lover, till Sir Thomas came down to Merle Park on the Saturday evening. On his arrival he seemed {{inclined}} to be gracious to the whole household, even including Mr. Traffick, who received any attention of that kind exactly as though the most <b>amicable</b> <b>arrangements</b> were always existing {{between him and his}} father-in-law. Aunt Emmeline, when it seemed that she was to encounter no further anger on account of the revelation which Hamel had made in Lombard Street, also recovered her temper, and the evening was spent as though there were no causes for serious family discord. In this spirit, on the following morning, they all went to church, and it was delightful to hear the flattering words with which Mr. Traffick praised Merle Park, and everything belonging to it, during the hour of lunch. He {{went so far as to}} make some delicately laudatory hints in praise of hospitality in general, and especially as to that so nobly exercised by London merchant-princes. Sir Thomas smiled as he heard him, and, as he smiled, he resolved that, as soon as the Christmas festivities should be over, the Honourable Septimus Traffick should certainly be turned out of that house.|$|R
40|$|The {{resolution}} of conflicts {{in a society}} {{can be seen as}} a complex network of interactions between various relatively autonomous official control systems. The place occupied by the criminal law as well as its role within this network are larg e -ly determined by the nature of its relations with the other control systems. Based on these theoretical premises, developed in recent socio-juridical studies, this article advances a number of conceptual proposals aimed at clarifying a question that has been the subject of theoretical and political controversy in the field of criminology for about half a century. It is the question of the exclusion, total or partial, of certain particular forms of illegalities from penal intervention. The principal characteristic of these illegalities lies in the fact that they have a broad range of forms of control (civil, administrative proceedings and particularly <b>amicable</b> <b>arrangements).</b> The control of illicit activities in five areas of social life examined in the second part of the study (the business world, public administration, public health, the environment and health and safety in the workplace) show this characteristic very clearly. In conclusion, the author advances a number of arguments that tend to illustrate the profoundly illusory nature of any attempt at control of the above-mentioned illicit activities by intervention of the criminal law...|$|R
50|$|In later years, Continental Express, a {{regional}} airline and {{a regional}} airline brand; {{and at that}} time survivor of the post-deregulation and highly controversial Houston based Texas Air Corporation Continental Airlines and Eastern Air Lines acquisition years, operated scheduled passenger air service from Ellington Field (EFD) near the former site of the Clear Lake City STOLport. Much like the original Houston Metro, and subsequent Eastern Express short hop operations <b>by</b> <b>amicable</b> partner Metro Airlines; short hop Continental Express flights commenced during the 1980s, utilizing ATR-42 and Embraer EMB-120 Brasilia turboprops and then Embraer ERJ-135 regional jets to transport connecting passengers across the city to Houston George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH). However, this service was finally discontinued as well.|$|R
50|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1696 at Tom's Coffee House in St. Martin's Lane in London. It {{was one of three}} fire {{insurance}} companies started after the Great Fire of London, and it was initially called the Contributors for Insuring Houses, Chambers or Rooms from Loss <b>by</b> Fire, <b>by</b> <b>Amicable</b> Contribution. Less than thirty years later the other two insurers had failed, and the Hand in Hand was left as the oldest fire insurance company in the world. It was structured as a mutual society, and for 135 years it operated its own fire brigade and played an important part in shaping fire fighting and prevention.In 1905, the Hand in Hand was acquired by the Commercial Union Group.|$|R
60|$|Moritz Schleiermacher {{assisted}} at Sir Friedmund's first solemn requiem, {{and then}} made a journey to Ulm, whence he returned to find the Baron's danger so much abated that he ventured on begging {{for an interview with}} the lady, in which he explained his purpose of repairing at once to the imperial camp, taking with him a letter from the guilds concerned in the bridge, and using his personal influence with Maximilian to obtain not only pardon for the combat, but authoritative sanction to the erection. Dankwart of Schlangenwald, the Teutonic knight, and only heir of old Wolfgang, was supposed to be with the Emperor, and {{it might be possible to}} come to terms with him, since his breeding in the Prussian commanderies had kept him aloof from the feuds of his father and brother. This mournful fight had to a certain extent equalized the injuries on either side, since the man whom Friedel had cut down was Hierom, one of the few remaining scions of Schlangenwald, and there was thus no dishonour in trying to close the deadly feud, and coming to an <b>amicable</b> <b>arrangement</b> about the Debateable Strand, the cause of so much bloodshed. What was now wanted was Freiherr Eberhard's signature to the letter to the Emperor, and his authority for making terms with the new count; and haste was needed, lest the Markgraf of Wurtemburg should represent the affray in the light of an outrage against a member of the League.|$|R
5000|$|Pope Pius IX {{tried in}} vain <b>by</b> <b>amicable</b> {{adjustments}} {{to enforce the}} essential rights of the Holy See in Sicily. Giuseppe Garibaldi, as [...] "Dictator" [...] of Sicily, claimed {{the rights of the}} Papal legate, and, during the ceremony in Palermo Cathedral, caused legatine honours to be given him. In the bull Suprema of 28 January 1864, which was not published with the prescriptions for its execution until 10 October 1867, Pope Pius IX permanently revoked the monarchia Sicula. The government of Victor Emmanuel II of Italy protested, and the Judex Monarchiae Siculae, Rinaldi, refused to submit, for which he was excommunicated in 1868. Article 15 of the Italian law of guarantees of 13 May 1871 explicitly revoked the monarchia Sicula and the question was thus finally disposed of.|$|R
5000|$|She {{remained}} there from 1921-1925, and in 1922 married Frederic Warde, printer to Princeton University, a gifted typographic designer, and fully {{familiar with the}} possibilities of mechanical typesetting.

60|$|The {{preference}} {{should be}} given to such laborers, and there are many of them, as had saved enough to maintain them until their first crop was got in, or whose character was such as to induce some responsible person to advance to them the requisite amount on their personal security. The tools, the manure, and in some cases the subsistence also, might be supplied by the parish, or by the state; interest for the advance, at the rate yielded by the public funds, being laid on as a perpetual quitrent, with power to the peasant to redeem it at any time for a moderate number of years’ purchase. These little landed estates might, if it were thought necessary, be indivisible by law; though, if the plan worked in the manner designed, I should not apprehend any objectionable degree of subdivision. In case of intestacy, and in default of <b>amicable</b> <b>arrangement</b> among the heirs, they might be bought by government at their value, and re-granted to some other laborer who could give security for the price. The desire to possess one of these small properties would probably become, as on the Continent, an inducement to prudence and economy pervading the whole laboring population; and that great desideratum among a people of hired laborers would be provided, an intermediate class between them and their employers; affording them the double advantage of an object for their hopes, and, as there would be good reason to anticipate, an example for their imitation.|$|R
6000|$|... [59] One of {{the most}} {{pleasing}} characteristics of manners in secluded and thinly-peopled districts, {{is a sense of}} the degree in which human happiness and comfort are dependent on the contingency of neighbourhood. This is implied by a rhyming adage common here, 'Friends are far, when neighbours are nar' (near). This mutual helpfulness is not confined to out-of-doors work; but is ready upon all occasions. Formerly, if a person became sick, especially the mistress of a family, it was usual for those of the neighbours who were more particularly connected with the party <b>by</b> <b>amicable</b> offices, to visit the house, carrying a present; this practice, which is by no means obsolete, is called owning the family, and is regarded as a pledge of a disposition to be otherwise serviceable in a time of disability and distress.|$|R
6000|$|But {{there is}} a time when men will not suffer bad things because their {{ancestors}} have suffered worse. There is a time when the hoary head of inveterate abuse will neither draw reverence nor obtain protection. If the noble lord in the blue riband pleads [...] "not guilty" [...] to the charges brought against the present system of public economy, {{it is not possible to}} give a fair verdict by which he will not stand acquitted. But pleading is not our present business. His plea or his traverse may be allowed as an answer to a charge, when a charge is made. But if he puts himself in the way to obstruct reformation, then the faults of his office instantly become his own. Instead of a public officer in an abusive department, whose province is an object to be regulated, he becomes a criminal who is to be punished. I do most seriously put it to administration, to consider the wisdom of a timely reform. Early reformations are <b>amicable</b> <b>arrangements</b> with a friend in power; late reformations are terms imposed upon a conquered enemy: early reformations are made in cool blood; late reformations are made under a state of inflammation. In that state of things people behold in government nothing that is respectable. They see the abuse, and they will see nothing else: they fall into the temper of a furious populace provoked at the disorder of a house of ill-fame; they never attempt to correct or regulate; they go to work by the shortest way--they abate the nuisance, they pull down the house.|$|R
