5|$|Highway {{engineers}} evaluated {{factors such}} as grading, curve radius and the narrow median used along the Middle Road (which was inaugurated on August 23, 1940, as the Queen Elizabeth Way), and began to plan {{the course of a}} new dual highway mostly parallel to Highway2, with precedence given to areas most hampered by congestion. Unlike the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW), this highway would not be built along an existing road, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>on</b> a new right-of-way, avoiding the need to provide access to properties.|$|E
5|$|It {{keeps its}} {{distance}} from mass media and avoids publishing details about its activities and membership. The group also exercises complete abstinence from expressing opinions on political and controversial issues mainly {{to avoid the}} disputes which would accompany these endorsements. As an organisation, Tabligh Jamaat does not seek donations and is not funded by anyone, in fact members have to bear their own expenditures. Since there is no formal registration process and no official membership count has ever been taken, the exact membership statistics remain unknown. The movement discourages interviews with its elders and has never officially released texts, although there are publications associated with the movement (usually referred as TablighiNisaab (Tablighi Curriculum). The emphasis has never been on book learning, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>on</b> first-hand personal communication.|$|E

5|$|JC's Girls (short for Jesus Christ's Girls, {{also called}} the JC's Girls Girls Girls Ministry) is an Evangelical Christian women's {{organization}} in the United States whose members evangelize to female workers in the sex industry. The organization supports women wishing to leave the industry, but does not try to persuade them to do so. The group does not focus upon conversion <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>on</b> communicating its message that Christians exist who are not judging female sex workers {{and are willing to}} accept them. The organization also helps both women and men seeking to overcome pornography addiction.|$|E
5|$|Emphasis {{is placed}} not on actual {{arithmetic}} computation, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>on</b> conceptual understanding and interpretation. The course curriculum is organized around four basic themes; the first involves exploring data and covers 20–30% of the exam. Students {{are expected to}} use graphical and numerical techniques to analyze distributions of data, including univariate, bivariate, and categorical data. The second theme involves planning and conducting a study and covers 10–15% of the exam. Students {{must be aware of}} the various methods of data collection through sampling or experimentation and the sorts of conclusions that can be drawn from the results. The third theme involves probability and its role in anticipating patterns in distributions of data. This theme covers 20–30% of the exam. The fourth theme, which covers 30–40% of the exam, involves statistical inference using point estimation, confidence intervals, and significance tests.|$|E
5|$|Some {{of those}} who have {{attempted}} to find an escape from the impulse to power have resorted to forms of quietism or pacifism. One major proponent of such approaches was the philosopher Laozi. From Russell's perspective, such views are incoherent, since they only deny themselves coercive power, but retain an interest in persuading others to their cause; and persuasion is a form of power, for Russell. Moreover, he argues that the love of power can actually be a good thing. For instance, if one feels a certain duty towards their neighbours, they may attempt to attain power to help those neighbours (Russell 1938:215–216). In sum, the focus of any policy should not be on a ban on kinds of power, <b>but</b> <b>rather,</b> <b>on</b> certain kinds of use of power (Russell 1938:221).|$|E

25|$|Some {{have argued}} that Christianity is not founded on a {{historical}} Jesus, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>on</b> a mythical creation. This view proposes {{that the idea of}} Jesus was the Jewish manifestation of Hellenistic mystery cults that acknowledged the non-historic nature of their deity using it instead as a teaching device.However, the position that Jesus was not a historical figure is essentially without support among biblical scholars and classical historians, most of whom regard its arguments as examples of pseudo-scholarship.|$|E

25|$|The {{state is}} divided into counties, cities, towns, and villages, which are all {{municipal}} corporations with their own governments that provide most local government services. Whether a municipality {{is defined as a}} city, town, or village is dependent not on population or land area, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>on</b> the form of government selected by the residents and approved by the state legislature. Each such government is granted varying home rule powers as provided by the New York Constitution. New York has various corporate entities that serve single purposes that are also local governments, such as school and fire districts.|$|E
25|$|In October 2000, in {{violation}} of an order not to leave Moscow, Litvinenko and his family travelled to Turkey, possibly via Ukraine. While in Turkey, Litvinenko applied for asylum at the United States Embassy in Ankara, but his application was denied. With the help of Alexander Goldfarb, Litvinenko bought air tickets for the Istanbul-London-Moscow flight, and asked for political asylum at Heathrow Airport during the transit stop on 1 November 2000. Political asylum was granted on 14 May 2001, not because of his knowledge on intelligence matters, according to Litvinenko, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>on</b> humanitarian grounds. While in London he became a journalist for Chechenpress and an author. He also joined Berezovsky in campaigning against Putin's government. In October 2006 he became a naturalised British citizen with residence in Whitehaven.|$|E

25|$|Seungsahn {{first arrived}} in the United States in 1972, where he lived in Providence, Rhode Island and worked at a Korean-owned laundromat. Not long after, {{students}} from nearby Brown University began coming to him for instruction. This resulted in {{the opening of the}} Providence Zen Center in 1972. At the time of his arrival in America, Seungsahn's teachings were different from many of his Japanese predecessors who had taught Zen to Americans. During the early days he did not place a strong emphasis on zazen, which is the core of most Japanese traditions of Zen, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>on</b> Koans. It was through the urging of some of his first students, some of whom had practiced in Japanese schools previously, that Seungsahn came to place a stronger emphasis on sitting meditation.|$|E
25|$|Feeling of Knowing (FOK) {{judgments}} {{refer to}} the predictions {{of being able to}} retrieve specific information an individual makes, regarding his or her knowledge for a specific subject, more specifically whether that knowledge exists within memory. These judgments are made either prior to the memory target being found or following a failed attempt to locate the target. Consequently, FOK judgments focus not on the actual answer to a question, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>on</b> whether an individual predicts that he or she does or does not know the answer (high and low FOK ratings respectively). FOK judgments can also be made regarding the likelihood of remembering information later on and have proven to give fairly accurate indications of future memory. An example of FOK is if you can't remember the answer when someone asks you what city you're traveling to, but you feel that you would recognize the name if you saw it on a map of the country.|$|E
25|$|The {{adaptation}} of echolocation occurred when toothed whales split apart from baleen whales, and distinguishes modern toothed whales from fully aquatic archaeocetes. This happened around 34 mya. Modern toothed whales do {{not rely on}} their sense of sight, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>on</b> their sonar to hunt prey. Echolocation also allowed toothed whales to dive deeper in search of food, with light no longer necessary for navigation, which opened up new food sources. Toothed whales (Odontocetes) echolocate by creating a series of clicks emitted at various frequencies. Sound pulses are emitted through their melon-shaped foreheads, reflected off objects, and retrieved through the lower jaw. Skulls of Squalodon show evidence for the first hypothesized appearance of echolocation. Squalodon lived from the early to middle Oligocene to the middle Miocene, around 33-14 mya. Squalodon featured several commonalities with modern Odontocetes. The cranium was well compressed, the rostrum telescoped outward (a characteristic of the modern parvorder Odontoceti), giving Squalodon an appearance {{similar to that of}} modern toothed whales. However, it is thought unlikely that squalodontids are direct ancestors of living dolphins.|$|E

25|$|The dissent {{also took}} issue {{with most of the}} majority's conclusions. Federal {{immunity}} from taxation stemmed not from the common law but from the federal nature of the American system of government, he said. He admitted that Dravo Contracting was not an instrumentality of the federal government, but concluded that the tax did burden the government. Citing Telegraph Company v. Texas, 105 U.S. 460 (1881); Western Union Tel. Co. v. Attorney General, 125 U.S. 530 (1888); and Massachusetts v. Western Union Tel. Co., 141 U.S. 40 (1891), McReynolds noted that none of these cases turned on the unique contractual relationship between the private company and the government (as the majority had distinguished them) <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>on</b> the mere fact that a tax was laid on a corporation engaged in carrying out the duties assigned to it by the federal government under its constitutional mandates. The Court had long held, he claimed, that taxes (such as an estate tax on an estate that held government bonds) which only indirectly impinged on the relationship between the federal government and a private entity were valid. But if a tax on the contract itself were permitted, there would be no end to unlimited taxation on the federal government, he warned.|$|E
25|$|Education writer Richard Wright {{considers}} that Hume's position rejects a famous moral puzzle attributed to French philosopher Jean Buridan. The Buridan's ass puzzle describes a donkey that is hungry. This donkey has {{on both sides}} of him separate bales of hay, which are of equal distances from him. The problem concerns which bale the donkey chooses. Buridan was said to believe that the donkey would die, because he has no autonomy. The donkey is incapable of forming a rational decision as there is no motive to choose one bale of hay over the other. However, human beings are different, because a human who is placed in a position where he is forced to choose one loaf of bread over another will make a decision to take one in lieu of the other. For Buridan, humans have the capacity of autonomy, and he recognises the choice that is ultimately made will be based on chance, as both loaves of bread are exactly the same. However, Wright says that Hume completely rejects this notion, arguing that a human will spontaneously act in such a situation because he is faced with impending death if he fails to do so. Such a decision is not {{made on the basis of}} chance, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>on</b> necessity and spontaneity, given the prior predetermined events leading up to the predicament.|$|E
25|$|PSPs do {{not depend}} on {{targeting}} active proteases with tagged compounds <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>on</b> quantitative proteomics using stable isotope labeled standard peptides. Standard peptides synthesized from amino acids labeled with stable isotope atoms serve as internal standards for serial dilutions of a sample. These allow for later absolute quantification of a proteins and post-translational modifications by mass spectrometry. This technique has been adapted to absolute quantification of proteases, deciphering both activity states and total amounts in biological samples. This is thanks to trypsin treatment for mass spectrometry generating peptides specific to inactive zymogen precursors, active proteases, or common to both forms. PSPs is one form of standard peptide for absolute quantification and Standard of the Expressed Protease (STEP) is the other. The major {{difference between the two}} is PSP sequences are designed to mimic tryptic peptides that contain sequences spanning the zymogen’s pro-domain and the protease’s final form, whereas STEP sequences match tryptic peptide sequences found in both forms of the protease. This capitalizes on protease activation, where the zymogen’s pro-domain is cleaved off and the final form lacks that domain. Experiments using iTRAQ labeling and LC-MS/MS with STEP and PSP peptide internal standards have successfully quantified total and active protease levels in biological samples. One major drawback for this approach is the inability to account for inhibitor bound enzymes. It is also difficult to ensure standard peptides can be generated for this method for each and every protease for study.|$|E
