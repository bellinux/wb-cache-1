40|$|Our {{knowledge}} about oak epicormics has considerably increased in recent years, particularly {{thanks to the}} external recording of all epicormic types (suppressed buds, bud clusters, sprouts, picots and burls) and to internal observations made using X-ray computed tomography (CT). Several stages of epicormic ontogeny have been identified. The aims {{of this study were}} to provide the quantification of oak epicormic ontogeny and to identify the relationships between epicormics present near the trunk pith and epicormics present at the surface of the bark, based on data recovered from X-ray CT scanning. One to three 1 -m-long logs per tree were recovered from crop trees felled in five experimental stands located in four forests in northern France. The manual interpretation of the images provided by X-ray CT makes it possible to identify the origin and fate of every rameal trace, i. e., <b>branch</b> <b>knot,</b> epicormic shoot or trace of suppressed buds. The fate of branches and the origin and the fate of suppressed buds and sprouts were quantified. A strong relationship between the number of epicormics at the surface of the bark and the number of epicormics near the pith was highlighted. This could result in important silvicultural recommendations in terms of the necessary early selection of crop trees with the lowest number of epicormics possible, especially suppressed buds. From a broader ecological point of view, this paves the way {{to a better understanding of}} the variability of the sprouting response induced by disturbances, which is assumed to develop at an early stage in the tree life.

40|$|<b>Branch</b> <b>knots</b> {{and other}} traces of lateral axes, known as rameal traces, have {{generally}} been disregarded within architectural studies based on external observations and their analysis limited to tedious manual dissection methods. Based on non-destructive methods including X-ray CT scanning (XRCTS) and on the ontogenic knowledge progressively accumulated on Quercus petraea, this paper presents (1) the tracking methodology of all rameal traces with XRCTS and the "Gourmands" plugin, and software created downstream, notably the 3 D visualisation software "Bil 3 D"; (2) preliminary results obtained on two Quercus petraea 50 cm-long logs; and (3) potential applications {{in the fields of}} biology and ecology. Of approximately 45 sequences of linked rameal traces (composing rameal sequences) per metre, half were directly connected to the pith as horizontal traces of primary epicormic buds, while the other half were connected to a branch by an oblique knot. Horizontal epicormic knots essentially emerged within the tree from the most intensive thinning treatment and led to additional knots in the clear wood. Secondary epicormic shoots may emerge from <b>branch</b> and epicormic <b>knots,</b> leading to a vertical spread of epicormic sites for the former and to more bud clusters for the latter. Engulfment of lateral axes can be quantified. Assumptions on the origin of between-tree variability are proposed. Our methodology opens the way to an exhaustive description of rameal traces. It is relevant for ontogenic and wood quality assessment at the trunk level. It may also be very useful for characterising the potentiality of reiteration and for repairing shoot damage and vegetative regeneration at the crown, collar and even root system level...|$|R

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to find out if changes in chemistry could be used to quantify Pinus radiata compression wood severity or degree of compression wood development. Basic chemical composition and the lignin structure was assessed for a range of different compression wood samples sourced from juvenile wood, mature wood, earlywood, latewood, <b>branches,</b> <b>knots,</b> 2 -year and 1 -year old Pinus radiata. Fluorescence microscopy was used as the reference method to assess the degree of compression wood development. Lignin structure of compression wood was studied by thioacidolysis, size exclusion chromatography, and thioacidolysis/ 31 P NMR spectroscopy. Variation in the basic chemical composition and lignin structure with compression wood severity was ascertained. Results showed that, as the severity of compression wood changed, progressively from normal through mild to severe, all chemical parameters commonly associated with compression wood changed concurrently. With increasing severity lignin and galactose levels increased while glucose and mannose levels decreased. Lignin structural changes were also associated with changing severity of compression wood. Levels of p-hydroxyphenyl (H) releasable β-ethers increased and guaiacyl (G) releasable β-ethers decreased. Similarly, levels of uncondensed p-hydroxyphenyl units increased, while uncondensed guaiacyl units decreased. Similar proportions of condensed guaiacyl units were present in compression wood and normal wood. Similar trends in chemical composition were observed between the compression wood and related opposite wood in <b>branches,</b> <b>knots</b> and young wood of Pinus radiata. A number of chemical parameters changed linearly with compression wood severity. They were: the amount of lignin and galactose, the galactose/glucose ratio and p-hydroxyphenyl content in lignin. Parameters based on the p-hydroxyphenyl unit content in lignin, the H/G releasable β-ether ratio, releasable p-hydroxyphenyl β-ether units and uncondensed p-hydroxyphenyl C 9 units are most suitable indicators of compression wood severity as they spanned a larger range relative to the normal wood levels and were not influenced by the morphological origin of wood samples. Chemical methods for quantifying compression wood severity should focus on the detection and measurement of these parameters. Galactan present in Pinus radiata compression wood was isolated and characterised. Structural investigation by methylation analysis and NMR spectroscopy revealed that this galactan was largely composed of (1 → 4) -linked β-D-galactopyranose residues. No evidence was found to indicate the presence of any branches. Characterisation of lignin in cell wall fractions of Pinus radiata normal wood revealed that middle lamella lignin has a higher lignin content, a lower amount of releasable β-ethers and a more condensed lignin than the secondary wall lignin. Levels of releasable p-hydroxyphenyl units were not higher in middle lamella lignin. A new method based on thioacidolysis and 31 P quantitative NMR spectroscopy for estimation of the degree of lignin condensation of the phenolic and etherified C 9 units in in situ wood lignin is described. Using this method it was found that phenolic C 9 units in in situ lignin were considerably less condensed than etherified C 9 units in both compression wood and normal wood...|$|R

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the HERM 33 ES key project, we are studying the star forming interstellar medium in the nearby, metal-poor spiral galaxy M 33, exploiting the high resolution and sensitivity of Herschel. We use PACS and SPIRE maps at 100, 160, 250, 350, and 500 micron wavelength, to study the variation of the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with galacto-centric distance. Detailed SED modeling is performed using azimuthally averaged fluxes in elliptical rings of 2 kpc width, out to 8 kpc galacto-centric distance. Simple isothermal and two-component grey body models, with fixed dust emissivity index, are fitted to the SEDs between 24 and 500 micron using also MIPS/Spitzer data, to derive first estimates of the dust physical conditions. The far-infrared and submillimeter maps reveal the <b>branched,</b> <b>knotted</b> spiral structure of M 33. An underlying diffuse disk is seen in all SPIRE maps (250 - 500 micron). Two component fits to the SEDs agree better than isothermal models with the observed, total and radially averaged flux densities. The two component model, with beta fixed at 1. 5, best fits the global and the radial SEDs. The cold dust component clearly dominates; the relative mass of the warm component is less than 0. 3 % for all the fits. The temperature of the warm component is not well constrained and is found to be about 60 K plus/minus 10 K. The temperature of the cold component drops significantly from about 24 K in the inner 2 kpc radius to 13 K beyond 6 kpc radial distance, for the best fitting model. The gas-to-dust ratio for beta= 1. 5, averaged over the galaxy, is higher than the solar value by a factor of 1. 5 and is roughly in agreement with the subsolar metallicity of M 33.
