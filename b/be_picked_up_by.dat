Wind-aided dispersal of species has been recorded over 1600km of sea between Australia and South Island of New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|So many South Vietnamese {{helicopters}} {{landed on}} the TF76 ships that some 45 UH-1 Hueys {{and at least one}} CH-47 Chinook were pushed overboard to make room for more helicopters to land.

Atrus drops the Myst linking book into a massive disturbance on Riven known as the Star Fissure; the book falls through the fissure to <b>be</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> the Stranger in Myst.

5|$|The {{telescope}} became operational in {{the summer}} of 1957, {{just in time for the}} launch of Sputnik 1, the world's first artificial satellite. While the transmissions from Sputnik itself could easily <b>be</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> a household radio, the Lovell Telescope was the only telescope capable of tracking Sputnik's booster rocket by radar; it first located it just before midnight on 12 October 1957. It also located Sputnik 2's carrier rocket at just after midnight on 16 November 1957.|$|E
5|$|For BABS, {{the only}} change was {{to change the}} broadcast's {{transmissions}} {{to a series of}} short pulses rather than a continuous signal. These pulses were sent out when triggered by the AI radar's signals and were powerful enough that they could <b>be</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> the Mk. IV receiver within a few miles. On reception, the Mk. IV would receive either the dots or dashes, and the operator would see an alternating series of blips centred in the display, popping out and then disappearing as the BABS antennas switched. The duration of the blip indicated whether the aircraft was to the left or right, and became a continuous blip on the centreline. This technique was known as AI beam approach (AIBA).|$|E
5|$|For use in {{a binary}} digital computer, the tube had {{to be capable of}} storing either one of two states at each of its memory locations, {{corresponding}} to the binary digits (bits) 0 and1. It exploited the positive or negative electrostatic charge generated by displaying either a dash or a dot at any position on the CRT screen, a phenomenon known as secondary emission. A dash generated a positive charge, and a dot a negative charge, either of which could <b>be</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> a detector plate in front of the screen; a negative charge represented 0, and a positive charge1. The charge dissipated in about 0.2seconds, but it could be automatically refreshed from the data picked up by the detector.|$|E

Eight of their children graduated from Emory, seven with Phi Beta Kappa honors, a fact newsworthy enough to <b>be</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> the Associated Press wire service when youngest daughter Antoinette graduated from Emory the year following Sledd's death. Two of their sons followed in their father's footsteps, earning doctorates and becoming university professors: James H.

5|$|In {{the world}} of Chocobo Racing, Magic Stones are {{scattered}} throughout each course, and can <b>be</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> the player by driving through them. Magic Stones can also be stolen from opponent players by bumping into another player. The player can then activate the Magic Stone for some special effect. Activating a Haste Stone, for example, gives the character a short speed boost. In some Magic Stones, {{the power of the}} stone increases if more than one of the same stone is picked up by the player. Each stone is represented by a corresponding symbol on the racetrack, while stones marked with question marks represent random Magic Stones, which grant the player either a Haste Stone, Fire Stone, Ice Stone, Thunder Stone, Minimize Stone, Reflect Stone, Doom Stone, or Ultima Stone.|$|E
5|$|The {{common cold}} virus is {{typically}} transmitted via airborne droplets (aerosols), {{direct contact with}} infected nasal secretions, or fomites (contaminated objects). Which of these routes is of primary importance has not been determined; however, hand-to-hand and hand-to-surface-to-hand contact seems of more importance than transmission via aerosols. The viruses may survive for prolonged periods in the environment (over 18 hours for rhinoviruses) and can <b>be</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> people's hands and subsequently carried to their eyes or nose where infection occurs. Transmission is common in daycare and at school due to the proximity of many children with little immunity and frequently poor hygiene. These infections are then brought home to {{other members of the}} family. There is no evidence that recirculated air during commercial flight is a method of transmission. People sitting in close proximity appear to be at greater risk of infection.|$|E

5|$|The {{plan was}} for four troops (A, B, C and F), {{headquarters}} and attached specialists, {{to be divided}} into two groups. Group one under the command of Major Mills-Roberts would land at Orange One and consisted of C Troop, a section from ATroop, the mortar detachment and some of the specialists. They would scale the cliffs and form a fire base in the woods in front of the battery to support the assault. Group two commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Lovat would land at Orange Two and take out the beach defences. B and F Troops would then advance move along the river and assault the battery from the rear. The rest of ATroop would be the reserve, positioned between the two beaches. After the attack Group two would withdraw through Group one and <b>be</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> the waiting LCAs on Orange One beach.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{growing to}} certain heights, the Star Plant grows through larger {{floating}} islands. These islands, {{along with the}} smaller ones surrounding the Star Plant, contain power-up crystals which can be collected to provide B.U.D. with extra abilities. Creatures and other plant life {{can also be found}} throughout the game's islands, as well as environmental features, such as caves and water currents. Some parts of the environment, such as leaves growing off of both the Star Plant and Star Shoots that allow the player to jump to greater heights than normally possible, can affect how the player moves throughout the world. Teleportation pads allow the player to move around the world quickly and act as save points. The player also respawns at their last activated teleportation pad if they die, which can be caused by falling long distances, being in too much water for too long, or by the player making B.U.D. self-destruct. Additionally, players can scan various flora and fauna into the teleporters to retrieve data from them. Items can <b>be</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> the player and stored in B.U.D.'s backpack one at a time, such as flower parachutes that make the player fall more slowly towards the ground, and leaf gliders that allow the player to travel further through the air.|$|E
