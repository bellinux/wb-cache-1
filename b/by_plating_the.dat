50|$|The {{methods for}} {{scientists}} and researchers wanting to study genomic diversity and all possible associated phenotypes were very slow, expensive, and inefficient. Prior {{to this new}} revolution, researchers {{would have to do}} single-gene manipulations and tweak the genome one little section at a time, observe the phenotype, and start the process over with a different single-gene manipulation. Therefore, researchers at the Wyss Institute at Harvard University designed the MAGE, a powerful technology that improves the process of in vivo genome editing. It allows for quick and efficient manipulations of a genome, all happening in a machine small enough to put on top of a small kitchen table. Those mutations combine with the variation that naturally occurs during cell mitosis creating billions of cellular mutations.Chemically combined, synthetic single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and a pool of oligionucleotides are introduced at targeted areas of the cell thereby creating genetic modifications. The cyclical process involves transformation of ssDNA (by electroporation) followed by outgrowth, during which bacteriophage homologous recombination proteins mediate annealing of ssDNAs to their genomic targets. Experiments targeting selective phenotypic markers are screened and identified <b>by</b> <b>plating</b> <b>the</b> cells on differential medias. Each cycle ultimately takes 2.5 hours to process, with additional time required to grow isogenic cultures and characterize mutations. By iteratively introducing libraries of mutagenic ssDNAs targeting multiple sites, MAGE can generate combinatorial genetic diversity in a cell population. There can be up to 50 genome edits, from single nucleotide base pairs to whole genome or gene networks simultaneously with results in a matter of days.|$|E

40|$|In {{the study}} of the {{production}} of antibiotics by microorganisms, especially when a given substance receives recognition as a chemotherapeutic agent, it becomes necessary, {{in order to maintain the}} potency of the culture cr to obtain more active cultures, to isolate fresh strains of the organism producing the particular antibiotic.

Only very low levels of endocytosis of 125 I-alpha 2 M trypsin were measured, compared to the levels observed in normal human fibroblast cell layers. The absence of alpha 2 M receptors on endothelial cells, as measured in binding experiments at 4 degrees C, points to the nonconcentrative character of this process.
