5|$|Both Warren and Brown stated {{early in}} the race {{that they would not}} accept {{television}} advertisement assistance from Super PACs and interest groups. On January 23, 2012, <b>both</b> <b>candidates</b> signed the agreement, or People's Pledge. While no outside groups were obligated by the agreement, <b>both</b> <b>candidates</b> agreed to donate a sum equal to 50% of an advertisement run by any groups to a charity of the other candidate's choice. The pledge was broken twice, by Brown supporters. In March the American Petroleum Institute and Coalition of Americans for Political Equality launched ads supporting Brown, and as a result, the Brown campaign agreed to make donations of $1,000 and $34,545, respectively, to the charity of Warren's choice: the Autism Consortium.|$|E
5|$|In 2009 provincial {{election}} <b>both</b> <b>candidates</b> only reported $250 {{worth of}} expenditures to Elections BC. In that same election the party claimed $318 in general election expenditures.|$|E
5|$|<b>Both</b> <b>candidates</b> {{agreed to}} four {{televised}} debates, {{three of which}} were held. The candidates agreed to a fourth debate {{which was to be}} held on October 30 in WGBH-TV's studio, hosted by a Boston media consortium, and moderated by John King, but the day before both pulled out due to Hurricane Sandy. Victoria Kennedy, widow of Ted Kennedy, had proposed an additional debate with Tom Brokaw as moderator, however Brown would only accept the invitation if she pledged not to endorse Brown's opponent; which she refused.|$|E

30|$|SPAM [3] {{is another}} method that {{maintains}} the information of a pattern. It uses a vertical bitmap {{representation of the}} database for <b>both</b> <b>candidate</b> representation and support counting.

30|$|Differences between <b>both</b> <b>candidate</b> SC {{options and}} impacts from {{uncertainties}} and dynamics on SC performance are evaluated in detail for each performance criterion: cost and investments, service level, capital lockup resulting from inventory, and flexibility measured by RLT. Furthermore, the value impacts and potential risks of each SC options are compared.|$|R
5|$|<b>Both</b> <b>candidates</b> {{received}} {{financial support}} from outside the district, some of which was used to buy votes or bribe voters to stay home. Breckinridge received several thousand dollars, with a substantial amount coming from Washington, D.C. banker William Wilson Corcoran; estimates of Letcher's support ranged from $30,000 to $100,000. Breckinridge won the canvass by 526 votes and received 71% {{of the vote in}} Owen County, which recorded 123 more votes than registered voters.|$|E
5|$|Concerned about a {{divide in}} the party costing the party McConnell's seat in the general election, the Republican Party of Kentucky asked <b>both</b> <b>candidates</b> to sign a pledge to support the party's {{eventual}} nominee in the general election. McConnell signed the pledge, but Bevin did not. All Republican members of Kentucky's congressional caucus joined McConnell in signing the pledge except 4th District congressman Thomas Massie, a legislator aligned with the Tea Party.|$|E
5|$|In the primary, Tydings faced {{a strong}} {{challenge}} from Congressman Paul Sarbanes, who {{had entered the}} race several months earlier. This head start gave Sarbanes a considerable organizational and monetary advantage, and he had already secured influential endorsements. To fend off Sarbanes, Tydings hoped his name recognition and charisma on television would compensate for Sarbanes' other advantages. He also worked to relabel himself as more fiscally conservative than Sarbanes, since <b>both</b> <b>candidates</b> were seen as liberal.|$|E

50|$|The statewide {{syndicated}} TV program, NC Spin, held debates for <b>both</b> parties' <b>candidates</b> in April.|$|R
5|$|In {{the electoral}} college, {{the vote was}} more decisive. As expected, Hancock carried the South and border states, but Garfield swept {{all but one of}} the Northern states (the {{exception}} was New Jersey, which he lost by just two thousand votes). <b>Both</b> <b>candidates</b> carried nineteen states, but Garfield’s triumphs in the more populous North translated into a 214–155 electoral college victory. The sectional divide of the vote more deeply enforced the Republicans' retreat from the South after Reconstruction, and demonstrated that they could win without competing there. Weaver's resistance to fusion had no effect on the result; the combined Democratic and Greenback vote would have carried Indiana, but not any other of the states Garfield won, and the result would still have been a Republican majority in the electoral college. Hancock was convinced that the Republicans won New York by fraud. Lacking evidence, and mindful of the turmoil caused by the disputed election four years earlier, the Democrats did not pursue the matter.|$|E
5|$|After the {{surprise}} gains of the flamboyant Jelinčič {{in the first}} round, the campaigns of <b>both</b> <b>candidates</b> opted for more concrete political statements in public campaigning and debates. Peterle replaced {{the head of his}} campaign, and concentrated on questioning Türk's role in the 1991 secession from Yugoslavia. Peterle alleged that at the time when he, as Prime Minister, struggled for Slovenia's independence, Türk continued to act as an official representative of Yugoslavia in international institutions. The campaign was backed by the Prime Minister Janša and the Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel who {{went so far as to}} confirm Peterle's claims on the Foreign Ministry's official website. Türk denied the allegations, pointing to his opinion piece in the International Herald Tribune advocating international recognition of Slovenia, and the fact that it was Rupel himself who in 1992 appointed Türk as the Ambassador to the UN and praised him for his service to the country. Peterle's new strategy appeared to backfire, and the polls before the runoff predicted that Türk would win between 63% and over 70% of the vote.|$|E
5|$|<b>Both</b> <b>candidates</b> {{believed}} that the states of New York, New Jersey, Indiana, and Connecticut would determine the election. In New York, Blaine received less support than he anticipated when Arthur and Conkling, still powerful in the New York Republican party, failed to actively campaign for him. Blaine hoped {{that he would have}} more support from Irish Americans than Republicans typically did; while the Irish were mainly a Democratic constituency in the 19th century, Blaine’s mother was Irish Catholic, and he believed his career-long opposition to the British government would resonate with the Irish. Blaine’s hope for Irish defections to the Republican standard were dashed late in the campaign when one of his supporters, Samuel D. Burchard, gave a speech denouncing the Democrats as the party of “Rum, Romanism, and Rebellion.” The Democrats spread the word of this insult {{in the days before the}} election, and Cleveland narrowly won all four of the swing states, including New York by just over one thousand votes. While the popular vote total was close, with Cleveland winning by just one-quarter of a percent, the electoral votes gave Cleveland a majority of 219–182.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – In this paper, {{we propose}} a buffer query {{technique}} to calculate sub-segment road statistics in ArcGIS environment. The technique captures {{the advantage of}} SQL-based query predicates in <b>both</b> <b>candidate</b> filtering and refinement steps. In the refinement step, coordinate transformation is applied so that a simple predicate can be used. After calculation of the statistics, a bar-chart symbolism technique is used to visualize global picture of the accidents...|$|R
5|$|The Democratic nominee was Samuel J. Tilden, the Governor of New York. Tilden was {{considered}} a formidable adversary who, like Hayes, {{had a reputation for}} honesty. Also like Hayes, Tilden was a hard-money man and supported civil service reform. In accordance with the custom of the time, the campaign was conducted by surrogates, with Hayes and Tilden remaining in their respective home towns. The poor economic conditions made the party in power unpopular and made Hayes suspect that he might lose the election. <b>Both</b> <b>candidates</b> focused their attention on the swing states of New York and Indiana, as well as the three southern states—Louisiana, South Carolina, and Florida—where Reconstruction governments still barely ruled, amid recurring political violence. The Republicans emphasized the danger of letting Democrats run the nation so soon after southern Democrats provoked the Civil War and, to a lesser extent, the danger a Democratic administration would pose to the recently won civil rights of southern blacks. Democrats, for their part, trumpeted Tilden's record of reform and contrasted it with the corruption of the incumbent Grant administration.|$|E

50|$|On {{the issue}} on the petitioners’ locus standi, {{while it is true}} that the petitioners were not yet {{candidates}} at the time the petition was filed, they still have the legal standing to assail the Resolution because they are qualified voters. The Court held that any restriction on candidacy affects the rights of the voters to choose their public officials; therefore, <b>both</b> <b>candidate</b> and voter may question the validity of such restriction.|$|R
5000|$|... 1944 was, until 2016, {{the most}} recent {{election}} in which <b>both</b> major party <b>candidates</b> hailed from the same state, as Roosevelt and Dewey were from New York.

25|$|During {{his presidential}} campaign, Ma participated {{in one of}} the debates that {{discussed}} many topics, including environmental protection. The Taiwan Academy of Ecology evaluated the policies of <b>both</b> <b>candidates</b> Hsieh and Ma, and the secretary of its workstation in Taipei said that <b>both</b> <b>candidates</b> failed their expectations, but they had more hope for Hsieh than Ma because Ma's environmental concepts lack considerations of reality. In February 2008, several environmental groups created a list of commitments for the two candidates to sign. DPP candidate Frank Hsieh agreed to all the items on the list and signed it in March. Ma did not and emailed the group instead. The Taiwan Environmental Protection Union (TEPU) criticized Ma for ignoring important issues and not having the guts to sign the commitments.|$|E

25|$|Opinion polls {{previous}} to {{the result}} suggested that Scioli would win {{by a wide}} margin, and might {{even be able to}} avoid a ballotage. However, the final results showed only a narrow lead for Scioli, with his 37.08% just ahead of Macri's 34.15%, leading to new elections on 22 November. Massa got the third place, with 21% of the vote, and <b>both</b> <b>candidates</b> sought to secure the voters that had voted for him. <b>Both</b> <b>candidates</b> were polarized on the opinion about the presidency of Cristina Kirchner: Scioli proposes to keep most of the Kirchnerite policies, and Macri to change them. In the legislative elections, the FPV lost the majority of the chamber of deputies, but keeps the majority of the senate.|$|E
25|$|The IFE {{called on}} the {{candidates}} to abstain from pronouncing themselves as winner, president-elect, or president. <b>Both</b> <b>candidates</b> disobeyed this call.
