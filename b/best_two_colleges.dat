2500|$|Both {{before and}} after the game, many {{believed}} there would be a rematch between Ohio State and Michigan in the BCS National Championship Game, with some suggesting that regardless of the outcome, both team were still the <b>best</b> <b>two</b> in <b>college</b> football.

[...] Following the game, Ohio State remained No. 1 with a BCS average of 1.000, while Michigan remained in the No. 2 position.

5000|$|To {{return the}} Leopards to the spotlight, Lafayette called on Ernie Nevers, an {{assistant}} coach at Stanford University who helped lead the Indians to three straight Rose Bowl games. Nevers, along with Jim Thorpe, {{was considered one of}} the <b>two</b> <b>best</b> <b>college</b> football players ever and had a legendary career in the early NFL. Hope was high on College Hill as the 1935 freshman team went undefeated against the leading freshmen teams of the East, including Princeton. [...] However, with a young team plagued by injuries, the Leopards went 1-8, their worst record since their first season of football in 1882, and were blown out in their last five games. Despite stating he would stay for the 1937 season, Nevers resigned to become {{an assistant coach}} at the University of Iowa.|$|R
50|$|The {{committee}} that {{put together the}} bracket in 1996 was criticized for placing {{what seemed to be}} the <b>best</b> <b>two</b> teams in <b>college</b> basketball - Massachusetts and Kentucky - {{on the same side of}} the bracket so that they faced each other in the national semifinal - not the final game itself. Note that there are guidelines that the selection committee follows. In 2004 the procedure would be changed so that the regional sites would first be assigned their #1 seeds, then would be placed in the bracket so that the #1 overall seed would face the fourth #1 seed while the second #1 seed would face the third #1 seed, barring any upsets. However, it must also be noted that Connecticut was the presumed #1 overall seed that season, after compiling a 30-2 record during the season in a strong Big East Conference, including a conference tournament victory. Meanwhile, Kentucky was apparently dropped to the #3 overall seed following their defeat to Mississippi State in the SEC conference tournament final. Kentucky also could not be placed in the Southeast region since the Sweet 16 and Elite 8 games were being played in Kentucky's home arena, Rupp Arena.|$|R
