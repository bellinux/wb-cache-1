5|$|McBride {{continued}} to direct his taxi {{and real estate}} businesses after he sold the Browns, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> {{out of the public}} eye. He {{died of a heart attack}} at the Cleveland Clinic and was buried in Cleveland's Holy Cross Cemetery. He was married to the former Mary Jane Kane. They had three children: Arthur B., Jr., Edward and Jane.|$|E
5|$|At {{the third}} barrel, Scamper spit the {{bit out of}} his mouth, causing the bridle to drop to his chest, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> running full speed ahead. While running down the home stretch after the third barrel, James had nothing but a single rein around Scamper's neck with which to control him. Despite these occurrences, the pair crossed the finish line {{with a time of}} 14.4 seconds to win both the round and the 1985 World Barrel Racing Championship.|$|E
5|$|Bobby Robson's {{appointment}} {{followed a}} chance encounter with Ipswich director Murray Sangster while scouting at Portman Road for Chelsea manager Dave Sexton. Robson {{had some experience}} of management from his time at Fulham, although he had been sacked after failing to avoid relegation from Division Two. Robson's sides finished 18th and 19th {{in his first two}} seasons at Ipswich, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> the team in the top division, before finding greater success. Robson led the club to fourth place in the First Division and success in the Texaco Cup, beating local rivals Norwich City 4–2, in the 1972–73 season.|$|E
60|$|COKESON. He's {{had one or}} two places, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> hasn't <b>kept</b> them. <b>He's</b> sensitive--quite natural. Seems to fancy everybody's down on him.|$|R
60|$|Dick {{was almost}} as fresh as at the start and slowly <b>but</b> surely <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> gaining upon Jackson until the two were not over two yards apart.|$|R
50|$|In 1809, {{when the}} French army {{occupied}} Rome, {{he went back}} home <b>but</b> <b>he</b> was <b>kept</b> out into the margins of public life by the Imperial administration.|$|R
5|$|Reagan {{never left}} the United States during the war, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> a film reel that he {{obtained}} {{while he was in}} the service. The reel depicted the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp; he believed that doubts would someday arise as to whether the Holocaust had occurred. It has been alleged that he was overheard telling Israeli foreign minister Yitzhak Shamir in 1983 that he had filmed that footage himself and helped liberate Auschwitz, though this purported conversation was disputed by Secretary of State George P. Shultz.|$|E
5|$|Sarraj and Bizri wielded {{substantial}} {{influence in}} Syrian politics, checking {{the power of}} the political factions and purging Nasser's opponents from the officer corps. This was a source of concern for Quwatli, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> both men in their posts, partially due to pressure from Nasser. Quwatli further solidified his ties with the latter by appointing Akram al-Hawrani, the prominent Arab socialist leader, as speaker of parliament, and Salah al-Din Bitar, the co-founder of the pan-Arabist Ba'ath Party, as foreign affairs minister.|$|E
5|$|Ashworth left Liverpool {{midway through}} the {{following}} season, to manage Oldham Athletic – he wished {{to be closer to}} his wife and daughter, who lived in nearby Stockport. His replacement was the former Liverpool player Matt McQueen, a club director. McQueen was intended as a temporary appointment, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> the job as Liverpool retained the League championship. This success owed much to the form of their goalkeeper Elisha Scott, who conceded only 31 goals during the season, a league record at the time. Liverpool's total of 60 points in the season equalled the record set by West Bromwich Albion three seasons earlier. Harry Chambers top scored in the first four post World War 1 seasons including the two title wins.|$|E
50|$|Laaksonen's father, Sandro della Piana, is {{a former}} Swiss tennis player. His mother is from Finland. His parents {{separated}} very early in his life, <b>but</b> nonetheless <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> contact with his father.|$|R
60|$|Then he bade {{them put}} a seat for Theseus, and set before {{him the best}} of the feast; and Theseus sat and ate so much, that all the company {{wondered}} at him: <b>but</b> always <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> his club by his side.|$|R
50|$|Spirou's {{design was}} changed {{through the years}} by the various writers and artists who created his adventures <b>but</b> <b>he</b> has <b>kept</b> his spiky red-hair and clothes of the same colour even after {{ditching}} his hotel uniform.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{irregularities}} in {{the approval of}} the Lecompton Constitution by Kansas voters, Breckinridge agreed with Buchanan that it was legitimate, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> his position secret, and some believed he agreed with his friend, Stephen Douglas, that Lecompton was invalid. Breckinridge's absence from the Senate during debate on admitting Kansas to the Union under Lecompton seemed to confirm this, but his leave—to take his wife from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where she was recovering from an illness, to Washington, D.C.—had been planned for months. The death of his grandmother, Polly Breckinridge, prompted him to leave earlier than planned. During his absence, both houses of Congress voted to re-submit the Lecompton Constitution to Kansas voters for approval. On resubmission, it was overwhelmingly rejected.|$|E
5|$|Jane Pierce died of {{tuberculosis}} in Andover, Massachusetts in December 1863; she was buried at Old North Cemetery in Concord, New Hampshire. Pierce was further grieved by his close friend Nathaniel Hawthorne's death in May 1864; {{he was with}} Hawthorne when the author died unexpectedly. Hawthorne had controversially dedicated his final book to Pierce. Some Democrats tried again to put Pierce's name up for consideration as the 1864 presidential election unfolded, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> his distance; Lincoln easily won a second term. When news spread of Lincoln's assassination in April 1865, a mob gathered outside Pierce's home in Concord, demanding to know why he had not raised a flag as a public mourning gesture. Pierce grew angry, expressing sadness over Lincoln's death but denying any need for a public gesture. He told them that his history of military and public service proved his patriotism, which was enough to quiet the crowd.|$|E
5|$|This {{was not an}} {{encouraging}} start for the operation but despite this, the LCS decided {{to continue with the}} deception. Colonel Thornton's trip was approved and he travelled to Stockholm toward the end of April. Thornton spent two weeks in Sweden, meeting {{with the head of the}} Royal Swedish Air Force, General Bengt Nordenskiöld. The conferences were treated with a high degree of secrecy in the hope this would emphasise their importance. It had the required effect; Thornton's conversations were recorded by a pro-German chief of police and forwarded to Germany. Despite siding with the Allies, Nordenskiöld communicated very little sensitive information to Thornton. Nordenskiöld was convinced that the Allies intended to invade Norway, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> this conviction to himself, contrary to Allied hopes. Thornton returned to England on 30 April.|$|E
6000|$|The {{seats were}} {{emptying}} fast, <b>but</b> still <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> her there, silent and pale, {{as though to}} work out a secret punishment. Once or twice he made some comment, and she bent her head, or answered [...] "Yes" [...] with a tired smile.|$|R
60|$|Savonarola was silent; <b>but</b> while <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> {{his mouth}} firm, a slight glow rose {{in his face}} with the {{suppressed}} excitement that was growing within him. It would be a critical moment--that in which he delivered the letter {{out of his own}} hands.|$|R
60|$|Braile {{had already}} heard her {{explaining}} {{all this to}} his wife, <b>but</b> now <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> her for the full personal detail of the last night's event at the Temple. She ended an unsparing report of the wonders seen with a prophecy of wonders to come.|$|R
5|$|The West Coast offices {{had wanted}} {{a test case}} to take to court, but had a {{difficult}} time finding a Japanese American who was both willing to violate the internment orders and able to meet the ACLU's desired criteria of a sympathetic, Americanized plaintiff. Of the 120,000 Japanese Americans affected by the order, only 12 disobeyed, and Korematsu, Hirabayashi, and two others were the only resisters whose cases eventually made it to the Supreme Court. Hirabayashi v. United States came before the Court in May 1943, and the justices upheld the government's right to exclude Japanese Americans from the West Coast; although it had earlier forced its local office in L.A. to stop aiding Hirabayashi, the ACLU donated $1,000 to the case (over a third of the legal team's total budget) and submitted an amicus brief. Besig, dissatisfied with Osmond Fraenkel's tamer defense, filed an additional amicus brief that directly addressed Hirabayashi's constitutional rights. In the meantime, A.L. Wirin served as one of the attorneys in Yasui v. United States (decided the same day as the Hirabayashi case, and with the same results), <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> his arguments within the perimeters established by the national office. The only case to receive a favorable ruling, ex parte Endo, was also aided by two amicus briefs from the ACLU, one from the more conservative Fraenkel and another from the more putative Wayne Collins.|$|E
25|$|From December 2, 1922, to January 31, 1925, Ypi was {{a member}} of the High Council (the collegial Head of State, {{formally}} for William of Wied). In June 1924 he left Albania because of Noli's revolt, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> holding the post formally.|$|E
25|$|In the Second Test at the WACA England made 592/7 {{declared}} and Matthews batted for 190 {{minutes for}} his 45 and 14 {{not out to}} see out the draw. There was some talk Matthews would become 12th man for the third test <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> his place.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don Caesar Alvarado {{has found}} the letter you wrote your wife on the day you made your strike in the tunnel that is now my shaft. He gave the letter to Mrs. Mulrady; <b>but</b> <b>he</b> has <b>kept</b> a copy." ...|$|R
60|$|Years passed on. Rumour had {{bestowed}} Mr. Charlecote of Hiltonbury {{on every}} lady within twenty miles, but still in vain. His mother was dead, his sister {{married to an}} old college fellow, who had waited half a lifetime for a living, <b>but</b> still <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> house alone.|$|R
6000|$|... "I must do it!" [...] he muttered, {{and thrust}} one hand {{through to a}} cross brace. He ascended with difficulty, and once slipped and ran a {{splinter}} into his wrist. <b>But</b> undaunted <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> on until the top was gained, then dropped to the planking of the wharf beyond.|$|R
25|$|Famous ex-communist former Soviet agent Whittaker Chambers notably {{spent his}} time in the left-wing {{underground}} pursuing both homosexual and heterosexual affairs, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> his liaisons quiet since his communist associates despised homosexuality. Chambers later monogamously married the pacifist painter Esther Shemitz, working as a journalist and editor.|$|E
25|$|In 1901 he {{published}} a book Physical Culture and Self-Defense (Philadelphia: D. Biddle). In 1902, he and Jeffries had a rematch, once again with the World Heavyweight Champion at stake. Fitzsimmons battered Jeffries, who suffered horrible punishment. With his nose and cheek bones broken, most would have sympathized with Jeffries had he quit, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> going until his enormous strength and youth wore down Bob and he knocked him out cold in round eight.|$|E
25|$|When {{hostilities}} {{started with}} El Salvador in June of 1844, Rivera Paz closed the borders {{to prevent an}} invasion using inmates of the state border for these the watch over. His term of office was {{in a time of}} great political turmoil for Guatemala, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> general Rafael Carrera by his side to help him. In December 1844, Rivera Paz presented his irrevocable resignation to the Assembly due to the pressure and demands from Rafael Carrera.|$|E
5000|$|Unsworth's {{injuries}} required surgery, and he {{was afraid}} to return to school following the assault. Unsworth's grandmother has reported that [...] "We tried to force him return to school <b>but</b> <b>he</b> just <b>kept</b> saying, 'No, I don't {{want to go back to}} school.'" ...|$|R
60|$|Sentiment succeeded whimsicality. His {{old friends}} of the office--those were the men to benefit. What good fellows they had been! Some were dead, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> still <b>kept</b> {{intermittently}} in touch with {{half a dozen of}} them. And--an important point--he knew their present addresses.|$|R
50|$|His {{poems are}} written in {{political}} verse, and are the first certain instance of rhyme used in Greek. He spent his money and did time in jail, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> always <b>kept</b> writing poems, in very explicit language, satirizing the ethics of his time, having first hand experience.|$|R
25|$|The {{conflict}} lasted {{some five}} years, until 1223 when Geoffrey I decided {{to negotiate and}} sent one of his knights to Rome. Finally on September 4, 1223 Pope Honorius III confirmed the accord that had been drawn up between the prince and the church of Achaea. According to the treaty, Geoffrey I restored the church lands, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> the treasures and furnishings of the churches in exchange for an annual indemnity {{and the number of}} Greek priests enjoying liberty and immunity was also to be limited in proportion {{to the size of the}} community.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the event}} went live on pay-per-view, Carlito {{defeated}} Rob Conway {{in a dark}} match following a Backcracker. The first match was Chavo Guerrero versus Rey Mysterio. Both men took control during the match. Vickie Guerrero interrupted the match and tried to stop both men from fighting. She pulled Chavo {{out of the ring}} and tried to stop him, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> on fighting. Vickie then tried to plead with Mysterio but accidentally shoved him off the ropes. Chavo took advantage by performing a frog splash on Mysterio for the victory.|$|E
25|$|The Anglo-Saxon rulers paid large sums, Danegelds, to Vikings, who mostly {{came from}} Denmark (but many also from Sweden) and who arrived to the English shores during the 990s {{and the first}} decades of the 11th century. Some runestones relate of these Danegelds, such as the Yttergärde runestone, U 344, which tells of Ulf of Borresta who {{received}} the danegeld three times, and the last one he received from Canute the Great. Canute sent home most of the Vikings who had helped him conquer England, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> a strong bodyguard, the Þingalið, and its members are also mentioned on several runestones.|$|E
50|$|While in Bohai, Yuan Shao was not appeased by Dong Zhuo's {{proposal}} to appoint him as Grand Administrator. He planned {{to start a}} coup d'etat to remove Dong from power by rising in revolt <b>but</b> <b>he</b> was <b>kept</b> in check by Han Fu, the Governor of Ji Province (冀州).|$|R
