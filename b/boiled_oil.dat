6000|$|In {{a quarter}} of an hour the Captain of the robbers awoke, got up, and opened the window. As all seemed quiet, he threw down some little pebbles which hit the jars. He listened, and as none of his men seemed to stir he grew uneasy, and went down into the yard. On going to the first jar and saying, [...] "Are you asleep?" [...] he smelt the hot <b>boiled</b> <b>oil,</b> and knew at once that his plot to murder Ali Baba and his {{household}} had been discovered. He found all the gang was dead, and, missing the oil out of the last jar, became aware of the manner of their death. He then forced the lock of a door leading into a garden, and climbing over several walls made his escape. Morgiana heard and saw all this, and, rejoicing at her success, went to bed and fell asleep.|$|E

In some cases, the elderly might slip as they walked over the puddles, while children might get hurt by the <b>boiled</b> <b>oil</b> from the stalls. The safety concern and disturbance to the public aroused their discontent towards street hawkers.|$|E
50|$|The {{historical}} {{preparation is}} not clear, but is generally {{assumed to be}} thick leather, boiled in water. According to some sources, <b>boiled</b> <b>oil</b> and wax were used as well, while others posit the use of ammonia from fermented animal urine. The boiling causes the leather to become harder but also more brittle. The leather remains flexible {{for a short time}} after boiling, allowing it to be molded into larger plates.|$|E

50|$|Petroleum coke {{was first}} {{made in the}} 1860s in the early oil {{refineries}} in Pennsylvania which <b>boiled</b> <b>oil</b> in small, iron distillation stills to recover kerosene, a much needed lamp oil. The stills were heated by wood or coal fires built underneath them, which over-heated and coked the oil near the bottom. After the distillation was completed, the still was allowed to cool and workmen could then dig out the coke and tar.|$|E
5000|$|Raw {{linseed oil}} is the base oil, {{unprocessed}} and without driers or thinners. It is mostly {{used as a}} feedstock for making a <b>boiled</b> <b>oil.</b> It does not cure sufficiently well or quickly {{to be regarded as}} a drying oil. [...] Raw linseed is sometimes used, such as for oiling cricket bats, when it is wished to increase surface friction, so as to give better ball control. In the past it was also used to treat leather flat belt drives to reduce slipping.|$|E
50|$|Linseed oil is {{extracted}} from {{the seeds of the}} flax plant, already extensively grown for the production of linen. The raw oil may be used, but it cures poorly and leaves a sticky surface. Normally boiled linseed oil is used. This has been prepared beforehand by boiling with lead, in the form of lead oxide, or with manganese salts. Modern boiled oils use a lead-free metallic drier added cold, such as cobalt resinate. Old linseed oil finishes yellow with age, owing to oxidation with the air. Linseed oil was also widely used for the production of oilcloth, a waterproof covering and rainwear material, formed by coating linen or cotton fabrics with the <b>boiled</b> <b>oil.</b>|$|E

After cooking, the gordita is allowed to stand to drain excess oil, then a small slit is cut into one side to allow vapor and excessive heat to release and pour lime juice and salsa inside, which gives the gordita its characteristic flavor. In some regions of Mexico, the slit {{is also used to}} stuff additional ingredients, mostly dressings such as fresh cheese, nopal salad, tomatoes, guacamole, potatoes, beans or rajas (sautéed strips of chile). By tradition, gorditas are filled with chicharron, but there are local variations which substitute it by chicken stew, shredded beef, carne al pastor, eggs with chorizo sausage, carnitas or picadillo.|$|E
50|$|Graining is {{understood}} among painters to be a faux finish imitating several {{different species of}} ornamental woods, as satinwood, rosewood, mahogany, oak and others. After the necessary coats of paint {{have been put on}} to the wood a ground is then laid of the required tint and left to dry. The painter then prepares small quantities of the same color with a little brown, and <b>boiled</b> <b>oil</b> and turpentine, and, having mixed this, spreads it over some small part of his work. The flat hogs' hairbrushes being dipped in the liquid and drawn down the newly laid color, the shades and grainings are produced. To obtain the mottled appearance the camels' hair pencils are applied, and when completed the work is left to dry, and after-wards covered by a coat or two of good copal varnish. Imitation wainscot requires the use of combs of various degrees of fineness to obtain the grain (whence the process is called combing by some persons), and the flower is got by wiping off the color with a piece of rag. When dry it is over-grained to obtain a more complete representation of the natural wood, and then varnished.|$|E
50|$|<b>Boiled</b> <b>oil</b> is the raw {{oil heated}} with driers, such as {{litharge}} or red lead, to a temperature from 350° to 500 °F, {{at which it}} is maintained {{for three or four}} hours. It is thick and much darker in color than the raw oil, drying much more quickly, with a coat hard and glossy but less elastic than that produced by raw oil. Poppy-seed oil is expressed from the seeds of the poppy plant. It does not possess the tenacity and quick-drying powers of boiled linseed oil, but being of a very light color it is used for delicate colors. Turpentine is used as a solvent, diluent, or thinner, to bring the paint to a proper consistency so as to allow it to be spread in a thin even coat. When a flat dull surface is desired, turpentine alone is used with the base and the oil is omitted. The best turpentine comes from the pine forests of America. French turpentine is next in quality. Russian turpentine is the cheapest, and has usually a strong and unpleasant odor that renders it objectionable to work with. In consequence of the high price of turpentine of good quality, and the increasing difficulty of obtaining it, substitutes are coming into general use. Driers are substances usually added to paint to hasten the process of oxidation, i.e. the drying, of the oil. Some pigments possess this quality, as red lead and white lead.|$|E

30|$|Both methods also {{assume that}} the overall {{oxidation}} reaction is first order {{with respect to the}} fuel; i.e., the effect of oxygen concentration is incorporated in the pre-exponential factor A. This assumption is much more severe. As demonstrated in this review, the oxidation mechanism constitutes a complex set of radical reactions, which, in the case of <b>boiled</b> <b>oil,</b> are accelerated by a metal catalyst. The initiation reactions involve singlet oxygen and the propagation reactions entail triplet oxygen. From this perspective, the kinetic parameters (A and E) obtained by either Jones’ or Chen’s method can only be considered as global in nature; i.e., they represent the effect of the entire chemical mechanism condensed into one global chemical reaction.|$|E
30|$|There {{are four}} {{varieties}} of linseed oil {{sold in the}} market, including raw, boiled, stand and refined linseed oils. Raw linseed oil refers to pure oil with no additional treatment and with no additives, while boiled linseed oil is produced by adding a mixture of hydrocarbon solvents and metallic dryers to speed its drying time. <b>Boiled</b> <b>oil</b> is a well known trade name, even though the process does not involve boiling of raw oil, whereas the stand linseed oil is processed by heating the oil to about 300 °C, over {{a few days in}} the absence of oxygen. During this process, polymerisation reaction occurs, increasing the oil’s viscosity. It means that stand or polymerised oil has been boiled to make it unreactive and more viscous. The production of refined linseed oil involves the alkali treatment following the pressing process, improving the colour of this oil (paler and clearer). It is utilised as a medium to increase gloss and transparency of paint colours.|$|E
30|$|Basket heating {{apparatus}} {{consists of a}} container (basket) shaped as a cube, a cylinder or a sphere, made of wire mesh to hold the sample, an oven to maintain the temperature and a thermocouple to measure the temperature inside the sample. Measuring the runaway temperature involves the following steps: charging the basket with a sample, inserting the thermocouple {{in the middle of}} the basket, then placing this basket inside a preheated oven and finally recording the temperature with a data logger (Wang et al. 2006). The objective of this method is to determine the critical oven temperature that gives rise to self-heating. This approach assumes a single Arrhenius reaction rate, constant and isotropic material properties, and no water evaporation (Wang et al. 2006; Drysdale 1985). The measurements are normally analysed using the Frank-Kamenetskii theory as explained later in this review. Bowes et al. implemented this method to measure the self-heating and ignition temperature of sawdust for different concentrations of oxygen (Bowes & Thomas 1966). This method is time and material consuming since a great number of tests must be performed to obtain the critical temperature. Moreover, locating the critical temperature is not straightforward. Worden attempted to implement this method to study the spontaneous ignition of cotton soaked with linseed oil, however, the critical temperature could not be determined due to difficulties in ascertaining the sub-critical conditions (Worden 2011). In other words, using <b>boiled</b> <b>oil</b> (oil with cobalt accelerant), Worden could not find conditions that did not ignite. This leads one to conclude that there is no safe quantity of rags soaked with boiled linseed oil, and that even a single oil soaked rag at room temperature can self-heat. In practical terms, these findings question the classical theory of self-heating that stipulates the existence of a sub-critical condition for which a material does not self-ignite. The classical theory of self-heating does not cover self-ignition reaction involving radical and catalytic reactions. New theoretical and numerical treatments remain to be developed for spontaneous ignition induced by radical and catalytic reactions.|$|E
