40|$|In view {{of recent}} mass {{stranding}} of Ziiphids in the Bahamas (March, 2000) and the rrecovery of three Ziphiids between the 14 th and 25 th March {{on the west}} coast of Ireland I have provided a brief review of Ziphiidae in Ireland for the ECS Workshop on Beaked whales. Data on strandings were obtained from O'Riordan (1972) and Berrow and Rogan (1997), trends in sightings from Evans (1991) and recent strandings from the Irish Naturalists ' Journal and the IWDG database. There are confirmed records of five species of Ziphiid, the northern <b>bottlenosed</b> <b>whale</b> Hyperoodon ampullatus and four members of the genus Ziphius. Northern <b>Bottlenosed</b> <b>Whale</b> Hyperoodon ampullatus (Forster) There have been 26 stranded bottlenosed whales reported occurring all around the Irish coast. Ten of these (38 %) occurred between Counties Louth and Dublin on the east coast and it is the only Ziphiid regularly reported from the Irish Sea. Stendall (1926) reported a Bottlenose Whale in Belfast Lough with a smashed jaw possibly due to a ship's propeller and two strandings (one in 1998 and one in 1999) were live strandings. In addition the carcass found on Wexford in 1985 was reported as fresh. The live stranding on Bere Island in 1998 was {{one of a group of}} three, the other two were refloated...|$|E

50|$|Norway stopped {{hunting the}} whale in 1973 but {{northern}} <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whales</b> are still {{killed in the}} Faroe Islands. Faroese regulations only allow the killing of <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whales</b> which have beached themselves and cannot be driven out again. Long term statistics indicate that the most frequent beachings are in the villages of Hvalba and Sandvík on Suðuroy.|$|R
50|$|The {{northern}} <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whale</b> (Hyperoodon ampullatus) is {{a species}} of <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whale</b> in the ziphiid family, and being one of {{two members of the}} genus Hyperoodon. The northern bottlenose was hunted heavily by Norway and Britain in the 19th and early 20th centuries. It is one of the deepest diving mammals known, reaching depths of 1453 m (4767 ft).|$|R
50|$|The {{southern}} <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whale</b> is {{not believed}} to be threatened by human actions. The species has seldom been hunted. Forty-two {{were caught in the}} Antarctic by Soviet whalers between 1970 and 1982. In addition, the Southern <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whale</b> is covered by the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region.

50|$|The {{southern}} <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whale</b> (Hyperoodon planifrons) is {{a species}} of whale, in the ziphiid family, one of {{two members of the}} genus Hyperoodon. Seldom observed and rarely hunted, the southern <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whale</b> is probably the most abundant whale in Antarctic waters. The species was first described by English zoologist William Henry Flower in 1882, based on a water-worn skull from Lewis Island, in the Dampier Archipelago, Western Australia.|$|R

50|$|The {{southern}} <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whale</b> {{is fairly}} rotund and measures 7.5 m in length when physically mature, considerably {{smaller than the}} northern <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whale.</b> The melon is extremely bluff. The beak is long and white on males but grey in females. The dorsal fin is relatively small at 30 - 38 cm, set behind {{the middle of the}} back, falcate (sickle-shaped), and usually pointed. The back is light-to-mid grey. It has a lighter underside.|$|R

5000|$|Not much {{information}} is available about group composition of beaked whales. Only three species have been studied in any detail: northern <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whales,</b> Blainville's beaked whales, and Baird's beaked <b>whales.</b> Female northern <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whales</b> appear to form a loose network of social partners with no obvious long-term associations. In contrast to females, some male northern <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whales</b> have been repeatedly recorded together over several years, and possibly form long-term associations. Studies of Blainville's beaked whales have revealed groups usually consist {{of a number of}} females, calves, and/or juvenile animals. These whales are assumed to live in [...] "harem-like" [...] groups, where several females and young are accompanied by a single male. [...] Baird's beaked whales are known to occur in multiple male groups, and in large groups consisting of adult animals of both sexes.|$|R

50|$|Tropical <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whale</b> {{observations}} indicate {{they travel}} in larger groups {{than any other}} local species of beaked whales. The size of the pods range from the tens up to 100, with 15 to 20 being fairly typical, and the groups appear very cohesive. Their pods are sometimes associated with other species, such as short-finned pilot <b>whales,</b> <b>bottlenose</b> dolphins, spinner dolphins, and humpback <b>whales.</b> Tropical <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whales</b> {{have been known to}} breach the surface, and they normally have visible, but short, blows. Their dives last between 11 and 33 minutes, with one individual diving for least 45 minutes.|$|R

5|$|On the Faroe Islands mainly Pilot Whales {{are killed}} by drive hunts for their meat and blubber. Other species are also killed on rare {{occasion}} such as the Northern <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whale</b> and Atlantic White-sided Dolphin. The Northern <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whale</b> is mainly killed when it accidentally swims {{too close to the}} beach and cannot return to the water. When the locals find them stranded or nearly stranded on the beach, they kill them and share the meat to all the villagers.|$|R

50|$|Small boat whalers also hunted <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whales</b> {{in large}} numbers. By 1890, up to seventy vessels claimed about 3,000 of the 30 ft long whales annually.|$|R
25|$|In 2014, at {{total of}} 53 {{cetaceans}} were killed: 48 pilot whales and 5 Northern <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whales</b> which stranded by themselves {{and after that}} were butchered for food.|$|R
5|$|The {{stranding}} of the Northern <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whale</b> mainly {{happens in}} two {{villages in the}} northern part of Suðuroy: Hvalba and Sandvík. It is believed that it happens because of a navigation problem of the whale, because there are isthmuses on these places, where the distance between the east and west coasts are short, around one kilometer or so. And for some reason it seems like the <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whale</b> want to take a short cut through what it thinks is a sound, and too late it discovers, that is on shallow ground and is unable to turn around again. It happened on 30 August 2012, when two Northern <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whales</b> swam ashore to the gorge Sigmundsgjógv in Sandvík. Two men who were working on the harbour noticed these whales, and some time later they had either died by themselves or were killed by the locals and then cut up for food for the people of Sandvík and Hvalba (Hvalba municipality).|$|R
40|$|Using suction-cup {{attached}} time^depth recorder/VHF radio tags, we {{have obtained}} the ¢rst diving data on northern <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whales</b> (Hyperoodon ampullatus), the ¢rst such data on any species {{within the family}} Ziphiidae. Two deployments in 1997 on northern <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whales</b> in a submarine canyon o ¡ Nova Scotia demonstrated their exceptional diving ability, with dives approximately every 80 min to over 800 m (maximum 1453 m), and up to 70 min in duration. Sonar traces of non-tagged, diving <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whales</b> in 1996 and 1997 suggest that such deep dives are not unusual. This combined evidence leads us to hypothesize that these whales may make greater use of deep portions of the water column than any other mammal so far studied. Many of the recorded dives of the tagged animals were to, or close to, the sea £oor, consistent with benthic or bathypelagic foraging. A lack of correlation between dive times and surface intervals suggests that the dives were predominately aerobic...|$|R

50|$|Very {{little is}} known about the life {{histories}} of beaked whales. The oldest one ever recorded was 84 years for a male Baird's beaked whale, and the oldest recorded female Baird's beaked whale is 54 years. For all other beaked whale species studied, the highest recorded age is between 27 and 39 years. Sexual maturity is reached between seven and 15 years of age in Baird's beaked <b>whales</b> and northern <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whales.</b> Gestation varies greatly between species, lasting 17 months for Baird's beaked whales and 12 months for the northern <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whale.</b> No data are available on their reproductive rates.|$|R

50|$|The Longman's {{beaked whales}} look rather similar to both mesoplodont beaked <b>whales</b> and <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whales,</b> {{which led to}} a great deal of taxonomic confusion. The Maldives female had a robust body like the bottlenoses, {{although}} this may be a distortion, since the less-decomposed female specimen from Japan had a laterally compressed body typical of Mesoplodon. The juvenile specimens have a very short beak similar to a <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whale,</b> but the adult females seen so far have had rather long beaks sloping gently into a barely noticeable melon organ. Additionally, the dorsal fins of adult specimens seem unusually large and triangular for beaked whales, whereas in juveniles they are rather small and swept back.|$|R
5000|$|In 2009, {{the first}} {{confirmed}} sighting {{was made of}} tropical <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whales</b> in the southern Bay of Bengal. In {{the summer and fall}} of 2010, researchers aboard the NOAA ship McArthur II made two sightings of groups of tropical <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whales</b> off Hawaii. The first sighting consisted of a [...] "large, active group" [...] of over 70 individuals surfacing rapidly and breaching on occasion; the second sighting, late in October, did not last as long, as the group [...] "ran away". Increasingly more sightings and strandings have been recorded in Taiwan and surrounding small islands such as at Yilanthe Green Island, and Orchid Island. An entangled individual was saved by local fishermen off Pakistan in 2015.|$|R
50|$|Longman's {{beaked whale}} (Indopacetus pacificus, {{also known as}} the Indo-Pacific beaked whale or the {{tropical}} <b>bottlenose</b> <b>whale)</b> was originally assigned to Mesoplodon, but Joseph Curtis Moore placed it in its own genus, Indopacetus, a taxonomic assignment which has been followed by all researchers.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bottlenose</b> <b>whales</b> have a {{very strict}} {{migrating}} route, which goes south over {{the northern part of}} Suðuroy in August-September, and there are few years where no whales beach themselves on either of the two beaches at the northernmost villages of Hvalba and Sandvík.|$|R
