5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. During the first part of qualifying (Q1), Kimi Räikkönen was able to compete, after the Ferrari crew was able to change his gearbox in time for the session. Not running was Jenson Button, after his team decided not to go out, since a 55-place grid penalty would have placed him {{at the back of the}} grid at any case. Marcus Ericsson was more than half a second quicker than teammate Felipe Nasr, who failed to proceed into Q2, as did both Manor Marussia drivers. With <b>Button</b> <b>out</b> of the running, just one more driver was eliminated, and that proved to be his McLaren teammate Alonso, who barely missed out on making the cut. At the front, Rosberg set the fastest time ahead of Vettel, while Hamilton was the only driver not to use the soft compound tyre.|$|E
25|$|With Barrichello {{in seventh}} and <b>Button</b> <b>out</b> {{of the points}} scoring {{positions}} in 10th, Vettel looked to capitalise and try to close Button's 26 point lead in the Championship. By lap 13 he was 2.1 seconds behind Rosberg, who was in turn 2.5 seconds behind Hamilton. Vettel {{was the first of}} the leaders to stop, on lap 17. A lap later Rosberg pitted but he misjudged the level of grip on the pit exit, causing his car to cross the white line that distinguishes the pit lane from the race track, an offence that is punished by a drive-through penalty. Rosberg was issued with the penalty on lap 20 and would have to serve penalty within three racing laps. Hamilton also pitted on lap 20.|$|E
25|$|During {{the course}} of the 2004 and 2005 F1 seasons, BMW Motorsport and {{director}} Mario Theissen increasingly became publicly critical of the Williams F1 team's inability to create a package capable of winning the Constructors' Championship, or even multiple victories within a single season. Williams, on the other hand, blamed BMW for not producing a good enough engine. Williams's failed attempt to prise Jenson <b>Button</b> <b>out</b> of his BAR contract may also have been an issue with Theissen. Despite Frank Williams's rare decision to capitulate to commercial demands by employing German driver Nick Heidfeld when he allegedly preferred Antônio Pizzonia, the fallout between BMW and Williams continued through the 2005 Formula One season. Despite BMW's contract with Williams to supply engines until 2009, this public deterioration of the relationship between BMW and Williams was a factor in the decision by BMW Motorsport to buy Sauber and rebrand that team to feature the BMW name.|$|E

25|$|Webber – who {{brushed the}} armco with the {{right-hand}} side of his car three laps previously – pitted after struggling for grip on the super-soft, option tyres. He rejoined the circuit 16th, and behind the early-stopping trio of Rosberg, Petrov and Alguersuari. Four laps later, Alonso also brushed the Turn 19 barrier before pitting. He rejoined just in front of Webber, who had moved up the field steadily, and was running 13th – and set the race's fastest lap at the time – by the time Alonso pitted. Vettel and Hamilton continued to set quicker lap times than their championship rivals, despite being on heavily worn option tyres compared to the fresher, hard tyres of Alonso and Webber. That pairing caught up with Petrov towards the end of lap18, a battle that would go on until the race's conclusion, with the Renault driver having already stopped for tyres. Five laps later, Alonso tried to overtake Petrov under braking for Turn 11 but had to back out of the manoeuvre, narrowly avoiding the back of the Renault. On the same lap, Hamilton pitted from second place. Vettel pitted from the lead on the next lap, and rejoined the circuit comfortably ahead of Hamilton, but in second place behind Button, who had still to stop on track. Hamilton had filtered back into the race in fifth position, behind Kubica and Kobayashi who were running similar strategies to <b>Button</b> <b>out</b> front. After passing Kobayashi, Hamilton closed in behind Kubica but found it hard to pass the Renault, akin to what Alonso had been suffering behind Petrov. Despite having nearly 40laps on the harder tyre, Kubica's pace was still of a substantial level to hold off the advances of Hamilton.|$|E

5000|$|Chromatic harmonicas {{are often}} {{described}} as either [...] "straight tuned" [...] or [...] "cross tuned". This refers {{to the way the}} slider is shaped to isolate the reed set being played at a given position (button [...] "in" [...] or button [...] "out"). Traditionally the chromatic was [...] "straight tuned" [...] and the slider selected either the upper reed-plate (<b>button</b> <b>out)</b> or the lower reed-plate (button in). In the later half of the 20th century a new system came into use in which the slider played the upper and lower reed-plates at the same time, staggered by which hole (thus with the <b>button</b> <b>out</b> the player might play the upper reed-plate in hole 1, the lower reed-plate in hole 2, and then the upper again in hole 3 and so forth; pressing the button reversed this). This allows for a larger hole in the slider, and thus presumably more air gets through, allowing a louder volume. The two methods co-exist with some companies and players preferring one style and others another.|$|E

50|$|At Monaco, he {{received}} a ten-place grid penalty for causing an avoidable collision with Sergio Pérez during a practice session (which subsequently {{may have led to}} Pérez's crash in qualifying, which caused the session to be red-flagged) and an additional five-place penalty for a gearbox change, meaning he started 24th and last on the grid. He retired due to an accident {{at the start of the}} race, when he ran into the back of Pedro de la Rosa's HRT who also retired with rear wing damage. At the end of second qualifying session in Canada, Maldonado crashed into the infamous Wall of Champions at the end of the lap in which he a set the quickest sector 1 time and was on course to bump Jenson <b>Button</b> <b>out</b> of Q3. Maldonado finished the qualifying session 17th and started the race from 22nd position after a five-place grid penalty after he was forced to change his gearbox due to damage suffered in the crash. Maldonado made good progress in the first stint, running as high as tenth mid-race, however after his pitstop he dropped back to seventeenth and finished the race in thirteenth place.|$|E
50|$|Räikkönen {{was told}} on lap 46 {{that they expect}} to catch Vettel at the end because of Vettel's {{predicted}} higher tyre degradation. Kobayshi was in 11th on a two-stop strategy but was lapping nearly two-seconds slower than his rivals and thus pitted {{for a third time}} on lap 50. Räikkönen briefly fought back to trail the leader by less than three seconds, but then slipped back to the previous three-second plus margin. Rosberg caught di Resta in 5th as the Scotsman started to lose tyre performance. A desperate di Resta was told via team radio to use a double KERS boost on the start/finish straight, meaning to use his remaining KERS out of the final corner and also to use his new KERS that gets reset when crossing the start/finish line. Finally, the Mercedes of Rosberg managed to pass the Force India and quickly pushed ahead. Di Resta, now in 6th, now found himself under pressure from Button after losing four seconds in three laps. Amazingly lucky for di Resta, just as Button was in the DRS zone and would most likely pass the Scotsman, Button developed a left rear puncture and pitted immediately leaving di Resta in 6th place and <b>Button</b> <b>out</b> of points contention in 12th.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In animal {{behavioral}} biology, {{there are}} several cases in which an autonomous observing/training system would be useful. 1) Observation of certain species continuously, or for documenting specific events, which hap-pen irregularly; 2) Longterm intensive training of animals in preparation for behavioral experiments; and 3) Training and testing of animals without human interference, to eliminate potential cues and biases induced by humans. The primary goal {{of this study is}} to build a system named CATOS (Computer Aided Training/Observing System) that could be used in the above situations. As a proof of concept, the system was built and tested in a pilot experiment, in which cats were trained to press three buttons differently in response to three different sounds (human speech) to receive food rewards. The system was built in use for about 6 months, successfully training two cats. One cat learned to press a particular <b>button,</b> <b>out</b> of three buttons, to obtain the food reward with over 70 percent correctness.

40|$|Building on the {{previous}} work of Carl Wellington ' 99, Roger Bock ' 99, and Brandon Rutter ' 00, a robot was modified and programmed to autonomously operate an elevator. The robot is equipped with the following: (1) a vertically retractable arm with a maximum height of 52 inches, powered by a 24 V servo motor; (2) 360 degree sonar detection; (3) a horizontally retractable finger, controlled by a 12 V stepper motor, and located atop the arm; (4) two cameras, one grayscale and located atop the arm (next to the finger), and one color (situated {{on top of the}} robot itself); (5) full two-dimensional motion control. The current project entailed reinstallation and repair of the control boards for both motors; implementation of a navigation program to locate an elevator in a generalized but suitably constructed environment; execution of search algorithms in the vision module to locate relevant environmental features (e. g. the elevator button); implementation of a control algorithm to servo the robot arm to the appropriate position to depress the button; and integration of each of these programs into an overall master program for operating elevators. Elevator locating was achieved using a combination of free-space and landmark navigation; and button locating and depressing, starting with the <b>button</b> <b>out</b> of view, was implemented with visual servoing; but a single, unified, elevator-operating robot was not achieved...|$|E
