To genetically dissect this process, we performed an in vivo screen for genes required for efficient phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by Drosophila macrophages and identified pallbearer (pall), which encodes an <b>F</b> <b>box</b> protein. <b>F</b> <b>box</b> proteins generally provide substrate specificity to Skp Cullin <b>F</b> <b>box</b> (SCF) complexes, acting as E 3 ligases that target phosphorylated proteins to ubiquitylation and degradation via the 26 S proteasome.

40|$|SummaryThe Atf 1 {{transcription}} factor {{is critical for}} directing stress-induced gene expression in fission yeast [1]. Upon exposure to stress, Atf 1 is hyperphosphorylated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) Sty 1 [2, 3], which results in its stabilization [4]. The resulting increase in Atf 1 is vital for a robust response to certain stresses [4]. Here we investigated the mechanism by which phosphorylation stabilizes Atf 1. We show that Atf 1 is a target for the ubiquitin-proteasome system and that its degradation is dependent upon an SCF E 3 ligase containing the <b>F</b> <b>box</b> protein Fbh 1. Turnover of Atf 1 requires an intact <b>F</b> <b>box,</b> but not DNA helicase activity of Fbh 1. Accordingly, disruption of Fbh 1 <b>F</b> <b>box</b> function suppresses phenotypes associated with loss of Atf 1 phosphorylation. Atf 1 and Fbh 1 interact under basal conditions, but this binding is lost upon stress. In contrast, a version of Atf 1 lacking all intact MAPK sites still interacts with Fbh 1 upon stress, indicating that the association between the <b>F</b> <b>box</b> protein and substrate is disrupted by stress-induced phosphorylation. Most <b>F</b> <b>box</b> protein-substrate interactions described to date are mediated positively by phosphorylation [5]. Thus, our findings represent a novel means of regulating the interaction between an <b>F</b> <b>box</b> protein and its substrate. Moreover, Atf 1 is the first target described in any organism for the Fbh 1 <b>F</b> <b>box</b> protein...|$|R

40|$|Cancer-associated {{fibroblasts}} (CAF) attract increasing {{attention as}} potential cancer drug targets {{due to their}} ability to stimulate, for example, tumor growth, invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis. However, the molecular mechanisms causing the tumor-promoting properties of CAFs remain poorly understood. Forkhead <b>box</b> <b>F</b> 1 (FoxF 1) is a mesenchymal target of hedgehog signaling, known to regulate mesenchymal-epithelial interactions during lung development. Studies with FoxF 1 gain- and loss-of-function fibroblasts revealed that FoxF 1 regulates the contractility of fibroblasts, their production of hepatocyte growth factor and fibroblast growth factor- 2, and their stimulation of lung cancer cell migration. FoxF 1 status of fibroblasts was also shown to control the ability of fibroblasts to stimulate xenografted tumor growth. FoxF 1 was expressed in CAFs of human lung cancer and associated with activation of hedgehog signaling. These observations suggest that hedgehog-dependent FoxF 1 is a clinically relevant lung CAF-inducing factor, and support experimentally the general concept that CAF properties can be induced by activation of developmentally important transcription factors...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDecreased {{pulmonary}} {{expression of}} Forkhead <b>Box</b> <b>f</b> 1 (Foxf 1) transcription factor {{was associated with}} lethal alveolar hemorrhage in 55 % of the Foxf 1 +/− newborn mice. The severity of the pulmonary abnormalities correlates with the levels of Foxf 1 mRNA. Defects in alveolarization and vasculogenesis were observed in subsets of the Foxf 1 +/− mice with relatively low levels of expression from the normal Foxf 1 allele. Lung hemorrhage was coincident with disruption of the mesenchymal–epithelial cell interfaces in the alveolar and bronchiolar regions of the lung parenchyma and was associated with increased apoptosis and reduced surfactant protein B (SP-B) expression. Finally, the lung defect associated with the Foxf 1 +/− mutation was accompanied by reduced expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the VEGF receptor 2 (Flk- 1), bone morphogenetic protein 4 (Bmp- 4), and the transcription factors of the Brachyury T-Box family (Tbx 2 –Tbx 5) and Lung Kruppel-like Factor.

To assess effects of Foxf 1 during lung injury, we used CCl 4 and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) injury models. Foxf 1 +/− mice developed severe airway obstruction and bronchial edema, associated with increased numbers of pulmonary mast cells and increased mast cell degranulation after injury. Pulmonary inflammation in Foxf 1 +/− mice was associated with diminished expression of Foxf 1, increased mast cell tryptase, and increased expression of CXCL 12, the latter being essential for mast cell migration and chemotaxis. After ovalbumin (OVA) sensitization and OVA challenge, increased lung inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine, and elevated expression of CXCL 12 were observed in Foxf 1 +/− mice. During lung development, Foxf 1 +/− embryos displayed a marked increase in pulmonary mast cells before birth, and this was associated with increased CXCL 12 levels in the lung. Expression of a doxycycline-inducible Foxf 1 dominant-negative transgene in primary cultures of lung endothelial cells increased CXCL 12 expression in vitro.

In this study, Foxf 2 requirements in murine smooth muscle cells were examined using a conditional knock-out approach. We generated novel Foxf 2 -floxed mice, which we bred to smMHC-Cre-eGFP mice to generate a mouse line with Foxf 2 deleted specifically from smooth muscle. These mice exhibited growth retardation due to reduced intestinal length as well as inflammation and remodeling of the small intestine. Colons of Tg(smMHC-Cre-eGFP+/−);Foxf 2 −/− mice had expansion of the myenteric nerve plexus and increased proliferation of smooth muscle cells leading to thickening of the longitudinal smooth muscle layer. Foxf 2 deficiency in colonic smooth muscle was associated with increased expression of Foxf 1, PDGFa, PDGFb, PDGF receptor α, and myocardin. FOXF 2 bound to promoter regions of these genes indicating direct transcriptional regulation. Foxf 2 repressed Foxf 1 promoter activity in co-transfection experiments. We also show that knockdown of Foxf 2 in colonic smooth muscle cells in vitro and in transgenic mice increased myocardin/serum response factor signaling and increased expression of contractile proteins. Foxf 2 attenuated myocardin/serum response factor signaling in smooth muscle cells through direct binding to the N-terminal region of myocardin.

40|$|The Forkhead <b>box</b> <b>f</b> 1 (Foxf 1) {{transcription}} factor {{is expressed in}} mesenchymal cells of the lung, liver, and gallbladder. Although Foxf 1 deficiency causes severe abnormalities {{in the development of}} these organs, the molecular mechanisms underlying Foxf 1 function remain uncharacterized. In this study we inactivated Foxf 1 function in lung mesenchymal cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) by use of either short interfering RNA duplexes or a membrane-transducing Foxf 1 dominant negative (DN) mutant protein (Foxf 1 DN), the latter of which is fused to the human immunodeficiency virus TAT protein transduction domain. Although Foxf 1 did not influence DNA replication or cell survival, Foxf 1 depletion severely diminished mesenchyme migration. Foxf 1 deficiency in mesenchymal cells was associated with reduced expression of the integrin-beta 3 (Itgβ 3) subunit. Furthermore, we generated transgenic mice containing a tetracycline-inducible Foxf 1 DN transgene. Adenovirus-mediated activation of Foxf 1 DN in transgenic MEFs caused diminished cell migration and reduced Itgβ 3 expression. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that Foxf 1 protein binds to the bp − 871 to − 815 region of the mouse Itgβ 3 promoter. Deletion of the − 871 to − 815 Itgβ 3 promoter region completely abolished the ability of Foxf 1 to activate transcription of the Itgβ 3 promoter in cotransfection experiments, indicating that the mouse Itgβ 3 is a direct transcriptional target of Foxf 1 protein.

However, the expression and function of FOXF 1 in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are still unclear. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry detected the relatively lower expression status of FOXF 1 in HCC cases. Soft agar and transwell assays clearly demonstrated that FOXF 1 -knockdown cells showed significantly increased in vitro cell tumorigenesis and invasion, and FOXF 1 -overexpressing cells had significantly reduced growth and invasion potential. Our study also examined the role of FOXF 1 in HCC cell stemness by sphere formation, aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH 1) activity, and CD 44 / 133 -positive cell analysis. Enforced FOXF 1 expression decreased HCC cell stemness, and the downregulation of FOXF 1 promoted cancer cell stemness. The in vivo study showed that overexpressed FOXF 1 inhibits nude mouse tumorigenicity with downregulation of CD 44 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen.

Furthermore, blockade of ERN 1 ({{endoplasmic reticulum}} to nucleus 1) suppresses cell proliferation and tumor growth. We studied the effect of hypoxia on the expression of genes encoding the transcription factors such as E 2 F 8 (E 2 F transcription factor 8), EPAS 1 (endothelial PAS domain protein 1), TBX 3 (T-box 3), ATF 3 (activating transcription factor 3), FOXF 1 (forkhead <b>box</b> <b>F</b> 1), and HOXC 6 (homeobox C 6) in U 87 glioma cells with and without ERN 1 signaling enzyme function. We have established that hypoxia enhances the expression of HOXC 6, E 2 F 8, ATF 3, and EPAS 1 genes but does not change TBX 3 and FOXF 1 gene expression in glioma cells with ERN 1 function. At the same time, the expression level of all studied genes is strongly decreased, except for TBX 3 gene, in glioma cells without ERN 1 function. Moreover, the inhibition of ERN 1 signaling enzyme function significantly modifies the effect of hypoxia on the expression of these transcription factor genes: removes or introduces this regulation as well as changes a direction or magnitude of hypoxic regulation.

The efficacy of molecules recently discovered as possible nucleus pulposus (NP) markers to differentiate between chondrogenic and IVD-like differentiation was evaluated. MSCs were isolated from human bone marrow and encapsulated in alginate beads. Beads were cultured in DMEM (control) supplemented with TGFß or GDF 5 or under indirect coculture with bNPC. All groups were incubated at low (2 %) or normal (20 %) oxygen tension for 28 days. Hypoxia increased aggrecan and collagen II gene expression in all groups. The hypoxic GDF 5 and TGFß groups demonstrated most increased aggrecan and collagen II mRNA levels and glycosaminoglycan accumulation. Collagen I and X were most up-regulated in the TGFß groups.

The increased level of miR- 519 a expression was significantly correlated with adverse clinical features of HCC including hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, large tumor size, cirrhosis and advanced tumor-node-metastasis tumor stage. Furthermore, high expression of miR- 519 a was prominently associated with a poorer 5 -year overall survival and recurrence-free survival of HCC patients. Gain- and loss-of function experiments showed that miR- 519 a overexpression enhanced proliferation and reduced apoptosis of Huh 7 cells. By contrast, miR- 519 a knockdown inhibited SMMC- 7721 cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. Importantly, up-regulation of miR- 519 a reduced the expression of FOXF 2 mRNA and protein in Huh 7 cells, while down-regulation of miR- 519 a resulted in increased expression of FOXF 2 in SMMC- 7721 cells. An inverse correlation between mRNA levels of miR- 519 a and FOXF 2 was observed in HCC tissues. Thus, Forkhead <b>box</b> <b>F</b> 2 (FOXF 2) {{was identified as a}} downstream target of miR- 519 a in HCC. Mechanistically, the effects of miR- 519 a knockdown on SMMC- 7721 cells were abrogated by FOXF 2 repression. In conclusion, miR- 519 a is a novel prognostic predictor for HCC patients and it may potentiate proliferation and inhibits apoptosis of HCC cells by targeting FOXF 2...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{introduction}} of monoclonal antibodies in Crohn's disease (CD) management {{has been associated}} with the development of serious complications, such as the progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), caused by JC polyomavirus (JCV) reactivation. Therefore, the aims of our study have been the investigation of the possible JCV reactivation in pediatric CD patients treated or not with infliximab, performing quantitative PCR in urine, plasma, and intestinal biopsies at the time of recruitment (t 0) and every 4 months in 1 year of follow-up (t 1, t 2, and t 3), and the analysis of the JCV noncoding control region (NCCR) to detect cellular transcription factors binding site mutations. Results obtained showed that, in urine and ileal specimens, JCV load significantly increased in infliximabtreated patients after 1 year of treatment (t 3), while viremia was significantly higher at t 1. JCV NCCR sequence analysis showed a structure similar to CY archetype in 65 / 80 analyzed sequences, but the remaining 15 / 80, obtained exclusively from plasma and biopsies, evidenced a CY NCCR organization with two recurrent nucleotide changes, the 37 -T to G transversion in box A Spi-B binding site and the 217 -G to A transition in <b>box</b> <b>F,</b> and a box D deletion. These rearrangements were always found at t 3 within seven infliximab-treated CD patients, who presented a very severe disease at t 0. We can conclude that our rearranged NCCR sequences could be considered a marker of JCV virulence during mAb treatment, although none of our examined patients developed PML, and further studies on a larger cohort of patients should be performed. © Journal of NeuroVirology, Inc. 2011...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{the issue}} of {{computing}} a good estimate of the value set of a characteristic polynomial f(s; q) is addressed, where q denotes a vector of uncertain parameters belonging to a <b>box</b> and <b>f</b> is a multi-linear function of q. If f(s; p) is a totally decomposed expression, then a good estimate of the value set can be computed very fast by using Non-convex Polygon Interval Arithmetic. In this paper, an efficient method to compute good estimate of the value set is proposed when f is not a totally decomposed expression. I...|$|R
