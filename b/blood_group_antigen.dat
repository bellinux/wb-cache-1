The removal of A and B antigens still {{does not address the}} problem of the Rh <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> <b>antigen</b> on the blood cells of Rh positive individuals, and so blood from Rh negative donors must be used.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{storage of}} blood induces the {{formation}} of erythrocytes-derived microparticles. Their pathogenic role in blood transfusion is not known so far, especially the risk to trigger alloantibody production in the recipient. This work aims to study the expression of clinically significant <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> <b>antigens</b> {{on the surface of}} red blood cells microparticles. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Red blood cells contained in erythrocyte concentrates were stained with specific antibodies directed against <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> <b>antigens</b> and routinely used in immunohematology practice. After inducing erythrocytes vesiculation with calcium ionophore, the presence of <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> <b>antigens</b> was analysed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The expression of several <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> <b>antigens</b> from the RH, KEL, JK, FY, MNS, LE and LU systems was detected on erythrocyte microparticles. The presence of M (MNS 1), N (MNS 2) and s (MNS 4) antigens could not be demonstrated by flow cytometry, despite that glycophorin A and B were identified on microparticles using anti-CD 235 a and anti-MNS 3. DISCUSSION: We conclude that <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> <b>antigens</b> are localized on erythrocytes-derived microparticles and probably keep their immunogenicity because of their capacity to bind specific antibody. Selective segregation process during vesiculation or their ability to elicit an immune response in vivo has to be tested by further studies...|$|R

RECENT FINDINGS: Studies of the interaction between Plasmodium vivax and the Duffy antigen provide the clearest example of the potential for basic research on <b>blood</b> <b>groups</b> and malaria to be translated into a vaccine that could {{have a major impact on}} global health. Progress is also being made in understanding the effects of other <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> <b>antigens</b> on malaria. After years of controversy, the effect of ABO <b>blood</b> <b>groups</b> on falciparum malaria has been clarified, with the non-O <b>blood</b> <b>groups</b> emerging as significant risk factors for life-threatening malaria, through the mechanism of enhanced rosette formation. The Knops <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> system may also influence malaria susceptibility, although conflicting results from different countries mean that further research is required. Unanswered questions remain about the interactions between malaria parasites and other <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> <b>antigens,</b> including the Gerbich, MNS and Rhesus systems.

50|$|The {{severity}} of clinical signs and their speed of onset {{is determined by}} the dose of alloantibodies taken in by the foal and their potency. Alloantibodies against the Aa blood group are especially potent, and usually produce more severe signs than other alloantibodies when an equivalent dose is absorbed.

The material included tissue from persons with <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> A, B, and O, 9 from each group. Six patients {{in each group}} were secretors of <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> <b>antigens</b> in the saliva and 3 were nonsecretors. The <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> <b>antigens</b> and the precursors of these were studied by an immunofluorescence staining technique. Murine monoclonal antibodies were used to identify H-antigen (type 2 chain) and for N-acetyl-lactosamine whereas polyclonal rabbit antibodies were used for lacto-N-triosyl-group. In all groups lacto-N-triosyl and N-acetyl-lactosamine {{were found on the}} cell membranes of basal and deeper spinous cells. The H-antigen was mainly present on cell membranes of the lower spinous cells. Only the basal cells above the connective tissue papilli showed cell membrane staining. Cytoplasmic staining in the upper two thirds of the epithelium was found with all antibodies when they were used in high concentrations. The A and B <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> <b>antigens</b> were detected by human <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> test sera and were found exclusively on the cell membranes of the spinous cells.
