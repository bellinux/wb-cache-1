5|$|Yet {{the band}} members' drug {{problems}} still stood in their way. In 1986, Tyler completed a successful drug rehabilitation program, after an intervention by his fellow <b>band</b> <b>members,</b> a doctor, and manager Tim Collins, {{who believed that}} the band's future would not be bright if Tyler did not get treated. The rest of the <b>band</b> <b>members</b> also completed drug rehab programs {{over the course of}} the next couple of years. According to the band's tell-all autobiography, Collins pledged in September 1986 he could make Aerosmith the biggest band in the world by 1990 if they all completed drug rehab. Their next album was crucial because of the commercial disappointment of Done With Mirrors, and as the <b>band</b> <b>members</b> became clean, they worked hard to make their next album a success.|$|E

5|$|In late 1969, Zappa {{broke up}} the band. He often cited the {{financial}} strain as the main reason, but also commented on the band members' lack of sufficient effort. Many <b>band</b> <b>members</b> were bitter about Zappa's decision, and some {{took it as a}} sign of Zappa's concern for perfection at the expense of human feeling. Others were irritated by 'his autocratic ways', exemplified by Zappa's never staying at the same hotel as the <b>band</b> <b>members.</b> Several members played for Zappa in years to come. Remaining recordings with the band from this period were collected on Weasels Ripped My Flesh and Burnt Weeny Sandwich (both released in 1970).|$|E

5|$|Subterranean Jungle is {{the seventh}} studio album by the American punk rock band the Ramones, {{released}} by Sire Records in February 1983. The album appealed to a hardcore punk rock style rather than featuring several pop oriented pieces; {{this is because}} guitarist Johnny Ramone received more leeway with steering the overall genre with his hard rock influenced riffs. The recording sessions saw disputes between <b>band</b> <b>members,</b> mainly {{because many of the}} <b>band</b> <b>members</b> were dealing with alcohol addiction, or in bassist Dee Dee Ramone's case, cocaine.|$|E

5|$|The <b>band</b> <b>members</b> {{subsequently}} {{focused on}} solo projects, and Ray and Dave released their own studio albums. Talk of a Kinks reunion circulated (including an aborted studio reunion {{of the original}} <b>band</b> <b>members</b> in 1999), but neither Ray nor Dave Davies showed much interest in playing together again. Meanwhile, former members John Gosling, John Dalton and Mick Avory had regrouped in 1994 and started performing on the oldies circuit along with guitar-player/singer Dave Clarke as the Kast Off Kinks. Gosling and Dalton retired in 2008 and were replaced in the band by former Kinks members Jim Rodford and Ian Gibbons. Ray Davies, Pete Quaife and Bob Henrit have occasionally made guest appearances with the group at Kinks fan club conventions.|$|E

5|$|Adam LaClave formed two bands, Macrosick and Club of the Sons.
