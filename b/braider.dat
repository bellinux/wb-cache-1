30|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a simple {{technique}} to replicate the braiding process for the manufacture of virtual braids. The technique allows {{for the creation of}} circular Maypole <b>braiders</b> with an arbitrary number of horn gears, carriers and dimensions. It will also be emphasised that the use of a single cylinder to model a multifilament yarn cannot accurately represent the yarns once braided. A parametric study on the effect of the number of virtual cylinders used to model a real yarn is presented. Comparison of the shape of the virtual braids with experimental results are also shown.|$|R

The ratios of extensional to flexural effective Young's moduli vary from 0. 30 to 0. 52 in the longitudinal direction and 0. 90 to 0. 95 in the transverse direction. Measurements on a 2 -ply 0 {sup o}/{+-} 30 {sup o} braid support these numerical trends. The onset of macro yield in uniaxial extension coincides with the experimental values in the longitudinal direction while it is nearly twice the experimental values in the transverse direction. In simple shear, matrix plasticity around the undulations facilitates local rotation of the <b>braiders</b> {{at the onset of}} macro yield. Under uniaxial flexure, modest stiffening occurs prior to strain softening in both the principal directions...|$|R

50|$|Maypole <b>braiders</b> work by a {{circular}} braiding process. They were {{well suited to}} be driven by the steam engines of the industrial revolution and were common {{by the beginning of the}} 20th century being easily powered by electric motors. Common types of braiding machines work in much the same way as the process of decorating a maypole. At the start of decorating a maypole an even number of ribbons tied to the top of the pole. A group of people form a ring about the base of the pole and take a ribbon in hand. Half the people then travel clockwise and the other half counter clockwise. When the people pass one another they pass alternately to the right and to the left. This results in a downward forming braid on the pole. As the braid works its way down the pole, the ribbons become shorter and the angle of forming changes as the braid works lower on the pole. On a standard braiding machine, the supply lines are a constant angle and at a constant tension and hence the output braided product is uniform.|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{over a hundred years}} since George Bernard Shaw wrote that 2 ̆ 2 [a]ll professions are a {{conspiracy}} against the laity. 2 ̆ 2 Since then, the number of occupations and the percentage of workers subject to occupational licensing have exploded; nearly one-third of the U. S. workforce is now licensed, up from five percent in the 1950 s. Through occupational licensing boards, states endow cosmetologists, veterinary doctors, medical doctors, and florists with the authority to decide who may practice their art. It cannot surprise when licensing boards comprised of competitors regulate in ways designed to raise their profits. The result for consumers is higher prices and less choice, as licensing raises wages by eighteen percent and bars competition from unlicensed workers. For African-style hair <b>braiders,</b> the result is either an illicit business or thousands of hours of irrelevant training imposed by a cosmetology board. For lawyers, the result is less competition from tax accountants, paralegals, and out-of-state lawyers. The Sherman Act 2 ̆ 7 s great accomplishment has been to make cartels per se illegal and relatively scarce-unless the cartel is managed by a professional licensing board. Most jurisdictions consider such boards, as state creations, exempt from antitrust scrutiny by the state action doctrine, leaving would-be competitors and consumers no recourse against their cartel-like activity. We contend that the state action doctrine should not prevent antitrust suits against state licensing boards that are comprised of private competitors deputized to regulate and to outright exclude their own competition, often with the threat of criminal sanction. At most, state action should immunize licensing boards from the per se rule and require plaintiffs to prove their cases under the rule of reason. We argue that the Fourth Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s recent decision, soon to be reviewed by the Supreme Court, to uphold a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) antitrust suit against a licensing board-denying state action immunity to a licensing board and thereby creating a circuit split-was {{a step in the right}} direction but did not go far enough. The Supreme Court should take the split as an opportunity to clarify that when competitors hold the reins to their own competition, they must answer to Senator Sherman...|$|R
50|$|The {{second major}} way of {{manufacturing}} fibre preforms is Braiding. Braiding is {{suited to the}} manufacture of narrow width flat or tubular fabric and is not as capable as weaving {{in the production of}} large volumes of wide fabrics. Braiding is done over top of mandrels that vary in cross-sectional shape or dimension along their length. Braiding is limited to objects about a brick in size. Unlike standard weaving, braiding can produce fabric that contains fibres at 45-degree angles to one another. Braiding three-dimensional fibres can be done using four step, two-step or Multilayer Interlock Braiding.Four step or row and column braiding utilizes a flat bed containing rows and columns of yarn carriers that form the shape of the desired preform. Additional carriers are added to the outside of the array, the precise location and quantity of which depends upon the exact preform shape and structure required. There are four separate sequences of row and column motion, which act to interlock the yarns and produce the braided preform. The yarns are mechanically forced into the structure between each step to consolidate the structure in a similar process to the use of a reed in weaving. Two-step braiding is unlike the four-step process because the two-step includes a large number of yarns fixed in the axial direction and a fewer number of braiding yarns. The process consists of two steps in which the braiding carriers move completely through the structure between the axial carriers. This relatively simple sequence of motions is capable of forming preforms of essentially any shape, including circular and hollow shapes. Unlike the four-step process, the two-step process does not require mechanical compaction the motions involved in the process allows the braid to be pulled tight by yarn tension alone. The last type of braiding is multi-layer interlocking braiding that consists of a number of standard circular <b>braiders</b> being joined together to form a cylindrical braiding frame. This frame has a number of parallel braiding tracks around the circumference of the cylinder but the mechanism allows the transfer of yarn carriers between adjacent tracks forming a multilayer braided fabric with yarns interlocking to adjacent layers. The multilayer interlock braid differs from both the four step and two-step braids in that the interlocking yarns are primarily in the plane of the structure and thus do not significantly reduce the in-plane properties of the preform. The four-step and two-step processes produce a greater degree of interlinking as the braiding yarns travel through the thickness of the preform, but therefore contribute less to the in-plane performance of the preform. A disadvantage of the multilayer interlock equipment is that due to the conventional sinusoidal movement of the yarn carriers to form the preform, the equipment is not able to have the density of yarn carriers that is possible with the two step and four step machines.|$|R
5000|$|A marudai (marudai) meaning [...] "round stand" [...] is {{the most}} common of the {{traditional}} frames used for making kumihimo, a type of Japanese braid.

Louise resolves to drive each girl away and end the party. She tells Jodi that her mother suffers from numerous non existent infections, scares Harley into believing that Gene's secret, deformed, violent twin is about to be let out from the Belcher's basement, and refuses to allow Abby to braid her hair. Each girl demands to be driven home, leaving only Jessica, who went to bed early. However, Jessica finds an embarrassing possession of hers missing and believes Louise stole it to mess with her and drive her away. She skillfully evades Louise and searches the apartment, telling her she refuses to leave until her possession is returned to her. In the course of tracking down Jessica in the apartment, Louise finds her to be much more mysterious, resourceful, and cunning than she initially thought. A pillow fight ensues between the girls, but ends when Jessica's missing item is located and revealed: a pair of urine-soiled pajama bottoms. Now that her bedwetting secret is exposed, Jessica is humiliated and waits to be taken home. However, having learned of Jessica's cunning, Louise assures her that she's [...] "no narc" [...] and they're not in the 90s, that she won't tell anyone at school, and they bond over their mutual cunning, pillow fighting skills, and overbearing mothers.

40|$|The {{unnotched}} and notched (open hole) {{tensile strength}} and failure mechanisms of two-dimensional (2 D) triaxial braided composites were examined. The effect of notch size and notch position were investigated. Damage initiation and propagation in notched and unnotched coupons were also examined. Theory developed {{to predict the}} normal stress distribution near an open hole and failure for tape laminated composites was evaluated for its applicability to 2 D triaxial braided textile composite materials. Four different fiber architectures were considered; braid angle, yarn and <b>braider</b> size, percentage of longitudinal yarns and <b>braider</b> angle varied. Tape laminates equivalent to textile composites were also constructed for comparison. Unnotched tape equivalents were stronger than braided textiles but exhibited greater notch sensitivity. Notched textiles and tape equivalents have roughly the same strength at large notch sizes. Two common damage mechanisms were found: <b>braider</b> yarn cracking and near notch longitudinal yarn splitting. Cracking was found to initiate in <b>braider</b> yarns in unnotched and notched coupons, and propagate {{in the direction of}} the <b>braider</b> yarns until failure. Damage initiation stress decreased with increasing braid angle. No significant differences in prediction of near notch strain between textile and tape equivalents could be detected for small braid angle, but the correlations were weak for textiles with large braid angle. Notch strength could not be predicted using existing anisotropic theory for braided textiles due to their insensitivity to notch...|$|E
40|$|Typically, {{continuous}} filament composite components are fabricated using a filament winding technique. In this operation, fibers {{are introduced to}} a rotating mandrel while a guide holding the material traverses {{back and forth to}} place the material in a helical pattern over the surface of the mandrel. This procedure is continued until complete coverage is obtained. An alternative method for fabricating {{continuous filament}} composite components is braiding. In the braiding operation a mandrel is traversed {{through the center of the}} <b>braider</b> while 144 strands of material traverse around a carrier ring. As the fibers are applied to a mandrel surface, 72 carriers holding the fibers travel clockwise, while another 72 carriers travel counterclockwise to interlock fibers. An additional 72 carriers located on the back of the <b>braider</b> introduce longitudinal fibers to the composite giving the composite lateral strength. The goal of using the <b>braider</b> is to reduce production time by simultaneously applying 144 strands of material onto a mandrel as opposed to the four-strand wrapping most filament winding techniques offer. Benefits to braiding include the ability to (1) introduce longitudinal fibers to the composite structure; (2) fabricate non-symmetric components without using complex functions to produce full coverage; and (3) produce a component with a higher degree of damage tolerance due to the interlocking of fibers. The fabrication of bore evacuator chambers for a tank cannon system is investigated by utilizing a 144 carrier braiding machine, an industrial robot, and a resin applicator system...|$|E
