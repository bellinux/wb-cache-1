5|$|<b>Birds</b> <b>have</b> two sexes: either female or male. The sex {{of birds}} is {{determined}} by the Z and W sex chromosomes, rather than by the X and Y chromosomes present in mammals.

5|$|At {{least two}} species of bird lice, Colpocephalum cooki and Ciconiphilus temporalis have been found as ectoparasites. Healthy adult <b>birds</b> <b>have</b> no natural predators, and the only {{recorded}} causes of premature mortality are due to the direct or indirect actions of humans; such as, poisoning, shooting, or electrocution when the birds accidentally fly into overhead electricity wires. Captive <b>birds</b> <b>have</b> {{been found to be}} susceptible to avian influenza (H5N1) and high mortality was noted at a facility in Cambodia, with two-thirds of infected birds dying. The longest recorded life span in captivity was 43 years.|$|E

5|$|<b>Birds</b> <b>have</b> a very {{efficient}} system for diffusing oxygen into the blood; <b>birds</b> <b>have</b> a ten times greater surface area to gas exchange volume than mammals. As a result, <b>birds</b> <b>have</b> more blood in their capillaries {{per unit of}} volume of lung than a mammal. The arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand {{the pressure of the}} ventricular constriction, and become more rigid as they move away from the heart. Blood moves through the arteries, which undergo vasoconstriction, and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body. As the arterioles move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow. Blood travels through the arterioles and moves into the capillaries where gas exchange can occur.|$|E

5|$|<b>Birds</b> <b>have</b> {{been seen}} as symbols, and used as such, though {{perceptions}} of bird species vary widely across cultures: some <b>birds</b> <b>have</b> a positive image in some regions, a negative image in others. Owls are associated with bad luck, witchcraft, and death in parts of Africa, but are regarded as wise across much of Europe. Hoopoes were considered sacred in Ancient Egypt and symbols of virtue in Persia, but were thought of as thieves across much of Europe, and harbingers of war in Scandinavia.|$|E
50|$|It {{has also}} been speculated that <b>Bird</b> <b>had</b> been {{involved}} with a family dispute over his father's will.

5|$|<b>Birds</b> <b>have</b> {{featured}} in culture and art since prehistoric times, {{when they were}} represented in early cave paintings. Some <b>birds</b> <b>have</b> been perceived as monsters, including the mythological Roc and the Māori's legendary Pouākai, a giant bird capable of snatching humans. Birds were later used as symbols of power, as in the magnificent Peacock Throne of the Mughal and Persian emperors. With the advent of scientific interest in birds, many paintings of birds were commissioned for books.|$|E

5|$|The dusky woodswallow is {{medium-sized}} and swallow-like, with a {{dark brown}} hue, {{but there have been}} instances where the bird has appeared grey. The <b>birds</b> <b>have</b> a black patch in front of the eyes, and grey (sometimes also black) wings with white streaks on them. The dusky woodswallow has a black, white-tipped tail with a silver underwing. The <b>birds</b> <b>have</b> a blue-grey bill capped with black.|$|E
40|$|Outside the {{breeding}} season, densities of raptors (in autumn and in winter), seed-eating birds (in autumn) and insect-eating birds (in autumn) {{were significantly higher}} on organic than on conventional plots. Organic fields more often held stubbles and/or green vegetation in the non-breeding season. On organic farms, carnivorous <b>birds</b> <b>had</b> significantly higher densities both on fields with stubbles and green vegetation. Granivorous <b>birds</b> <b>had</b> significantly higher densities on stubble fields and insectivorous <b>birds</b> <b>had</b> higher densities on fields covered by green vegetation.

5|$|The {{nervous system}} is large {{relative}} to the bird's size. The most developed {{part of the brain}} is the one that controls the flight-related functions, while the cerebellum coordinates movement and the cerebrum controls behaviour patterns, navigation, mating and nest building. Most <b>birds</b> <b>have</b> a poor sense of smell with notable exceptions including kiwis, New World vultures and tubenoses. The avian visual system is usually highly developed. Water <b>birds</b> <b>have</b> special flexible lenses, allowing accommodation for vision in air and water. Some species also have dual fovea. Birds are tetrachromatic, possessing ultraviolet (UV) sensitive cone cells in the eye as well as green, red and blue ones.|$|E
