A 1k byte memory board was $176 and the 4k byte was $264. The serial {{interface}} board was $124 and the parallel interface was $119. There was a special price for an 8k byte system with BASIC for $995. The Teletype Model 33 ASR was $1500.|$|E

25|$|ATK {{worked with}} Northrop Grumman {{to produce the}} <b>backplane</b> support frame (BSF) for the James Webb Space Telescope. The BSF, center section, and wings form {{what is called the}} primary mirror <b>backplane</b> support system (PMBSS). The BSF is the primary {{load-bearing}} structure during launch and the PMBSS holds the telescope's main instruments, including its mirrors. The BSF was designed and manufactured at ATK's facilities in Magna, Utah. ATK designed and fabricated more than 10,000 parts for the PMBSS. PMBSS is made primarily of lightweight graphite, but numerous other materials including invar, titanium, and other composite materials were used.|$|E
50|$|On <b>backplanes,</b> vendors use {{typically}} 2 or 3 LEDs per slot - in both implementations a green LED indicates presence and/or activity - for <b>backplanes</b> with 2 LEDs per slot, {{the second}} LED indicates Status whereas in <b>backplanes</b> with 3 LEDs {{the second and}} third indicate Locate and Fail.|$|R

50|$|The {{smallest}} {{building block}} of QPACE is the node card, which hosts the PowerXCell 8i and the FPGA. Node cards are mounted on <b>backplanes,</b> {{each of which}} can host up to 32 node cards. One QPACE rack houses up to eight <b>backplanes,</b> with four <b>backplanes</b> each mounted {{to the front and}} back side. The maximum number of node cards per rack is 256. QPACE relies on a water-cooling solution to achieve this packaging density.|$|R

25|$|For a high {{resolution}} display like a TV, a TFT <b>backplane</b> {{is necessary to}} drive the pixels correctly. Currently, low temperature polycrystalline silicon (LTPS)– thin-film transistor (TFT) is used for commercial AMOLED displays. LTPS-TFT has variation of the performance in a display, so various compensation circuits have been reported.|$|E

In this paper we will first discuss recent developments in the enabling technologies for flexible displays- flexible substrates, TFT <b>backplanes,</b> display media, and thin film encapsulation. We will then discuss our current development efforts in low-temperature (150 oC) a-Si TFT <b>backplanes</b> fabricated on PEN plastic substrates. Finally, we will describe our efforts on the design, fabrication and successful demonstration of flexible AM OLED displays fabricated using a-Si TFT <b>backplanes</b> on PEN plastic substrates using thin film encapsulation...|$|R

25|$|When {{the board}} has no {{embedded}} components it is more correctly called a printed wiring board (PWB) or etched wiring board. However, the term printed wiring board has fallen into disuse. A PCB populated with electronic components is called a printed circuit assembly (PCA), {{printed circuit board assembly}} or PCB assembly (PCBA). The IPC preferred term for assembled boards is circuit card assembly (CCA), and for assembled backplanes it is <b>backplane</b> assemblies. The term PCB is used informally both for bare and assembled boards.|$|E
25|$|The {{microphone}} {{features a}} high membrane compliance {{with a large}} backchamber volume, a prepolarized <b>backplane</b> and a high impedance preamplifier located inside the backchamber. The windscreen, based on the high transmission coefficient of infrasound through matter, is made of a material having a low acoustic impedance and has a sufficiently thick wall to ensure structural stability. Close-cell polyurethane foam {{has been found to}} serve the purpose well. In the proposed test, test parameters will be sensitivity, background noise, signal fidelity (harmonic distortion), and temporal stability.|$|E
25|$|Most 32-bit PCI cards will {{function}} {{properly in}} 64-bit PCI-X slots, but the bus clock rate {{will be limited}} to the clock frequency of the slowest card, an inherent limitation of PCI's shared bus topology. For example, when a PCI 2.3, 66-MHz peripheral is installed into a PCI-X bus capable of 133MHz, the entire bus <b>backplane</b> {{will be limited to}} 66MHz. To get around this limitation, many motherboards have multiple PCI/PCI-X buses, with one bus intended for use with high-speed PCI-X peripherals, and the other bus intended for general-purpose peripherals.|$|E

50|$|<b>Backplanes</b> {{have grown}} in {{complexity}} from the simple Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) (used in the original IBM PC) or S-100 style where all the connectors were connected to a common bus. Due to limitations inherent in the Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) specification for driving slots, <b>backplanes</b> are now offered as passive and active.|$|R

25|$|The Altair bus {{consists}} of the pins of the Intel 8080 run out onto the <b>backplane.</b> No particular level of thought went into the design, which led to such disasters as shorting from various power lines of differing voltages being located next to each other. Another oddity was that the system included two unidirectional 8-bit data buses, but only a single bidirectional 16-bit address bus. A deal on power supplies led {{to the use of}} +8V and +18V, which had to be locally regulated on the cards to TTL (+5V) or RS-232 (+12V) standard voltage levels.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} {{design of the}} Altair, the parts {{needed to make a}} {{complete}} machine would not fit on a single motherboard, and the machine consisted of four boards stacked {{on top of each other}} with stand-offs. Another problem facing Roberts was that the parts needed to make a truly useful computer weren't available, or wouldn't be designed in time for the January launch date. So during the construction of the second model, he decided to build most of the machine on removable cards, reducing the motherboard to nothing more than an interconnect between the cards, a <b>backplane.</b> The basic machine consisted of five cards, including the CPU on one and memory on another. He then looked for a cheap source of connectors, and came across a supply of 100-pin edge connectors. The S-100 bus was eventually acknowledged by the professional computer community and adopted as the IEEE-696 computer bus standard.|$|E
500|$|ArtRave was an [...] "extravagant spectacle" [...] {{according}} to Billboards Andrew Hampp. However, {{he also noted}} that though the event did not have any sponsors, Gaga [...] "was part of a select group of artists who have firmly thrown their branding lot in with the tech–music innovation space". Projects like Creators with Vice and Intel, as well as artists like will.i.am, Jay Z and Bjork were cited as precedents for crafting events and merging music and technology with art. Gaga, who had been named a creative director of Polaroid Corporation in 2010, had been involved in technical projects like <b>Backplane</b> with her former manager Troy Carter; Gaga separated from Carter {{a few days before the}} ArtRave. But Hampp believed that the explicit nature of the art works and the videos being shown had deprived Gaga of the opportunity of any [...] "overt" [...] sponsorship for the event. He explained that Billboard had reached out to three executives from American Express (AmEx), the company which was supposed to sponsor ArtRave but had [...] "backed out" [...] due to creative differences. Speaking off the record, the executives confirmed that AmEx had been slated to bear the expenses of the event as well as the live streaming. They later issued an apology statement: ...|$|E
