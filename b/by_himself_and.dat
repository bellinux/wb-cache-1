5|$|Taft {{maintained}} a cordial relationship with Wilson. The former president privately criticized his successor {{on a number}} of issues, but made his views known publicly only on Philippine policy.

When hearings led to nothing discreditable about Brandeis, Taft intervened with a letter signed <b>by</b> <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> other former ABA presidents, stating that Brandeis was not fit to serve on the Supreme Court. Nevertheless, the Democratic-controlled Senate confirmed Brandeis. Taft and Roosevelt remained embittered; they met only once in the first three years of the Wilson presidency, at a funeral at Yale. They spoke only for a moment, politely but formally.|$|E

5|$|Alexios {{deployed}} his smaller army {{in waiting}} near Bryennios's camp, and divided {{it in two}} commands. The left, which confronted Bryennios's strongest division, was commanded <b>by</b> <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> contained the Frankish knights {{to the right and}} the Immortals to the Franks' left. The right command was under Constantine Katakalon, and comprised the Chomatenoi and the Turks. The latter, according to the Alexiad, were given the role of flank guard (plagiophylakes) and tasked with observing and countering the Pechenegs. Conversely, on the extreme left Alexios formed his own flanking detachment (apparently drawn from among the Immortals), concealed from enemy view inside a hollow. Given his inferiority, Alexios was forced to remain on the defensive. His only chance at success was that his out-flankers, concealed by the broken terrain, would surprise and create enough confusion among Bryennios's men for him and his strong left wing to break through their lines.|$|E
