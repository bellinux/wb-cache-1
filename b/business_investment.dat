5|$|The Oxford Olympics Study 2016 {{estimates}} the outturn {{cost of the}} Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics at USD 6.8 billion in 2015-dollars and cost overrun at 2% in real terms. This includes sports-related costs only, that is, (i) operational costs incurred by the organizing committee {{for the purpose of}} staging the Games, e.g., expenditures for technology, transportation, workforce, administration, security, catering, ceremonies, and medical services, and (ii) direct capital costs incurred by the host city and country or private investors to build the competition venues, the Olympic village, international broadcast center, and media and press center, which are required to host the Games. Indirect capital costs are not included, such as for road, rail, or airport infrastructure, or for hotel upgrades or other <b>business</b> <b>investment</b> incurred in preparation for the Games but not directly related to staging the Games. The Beijing Olympics' cost of USD 6.8 billion compares with costs of USD 4.6 billion for Rio 2016 and USD 15 billion for London 2012. Average cost for the Summer Games since 1960 is USD 5.2 billion.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} {{direct impact on}} the UK economy, air {{transport}} is an £11.4billion industry, a figure which represents 1.1 per cent of the country’s economy. It employs 186,000 people (full-time equivalents), and indirectly supports an additional 334,000 jobs, although the inclusion of indirect employment as an economic benefit of air transport is disputed. In terms of productivity the aviation industry in 2004 was the third most productive, after the oil/gas extraction and utilities sectors, exceeding the national average {{by a factor of}} two and a half. The industry is also very capital intensive, accounting for up to 3.5 per cent of total UK <b>business</b> <b>investment</b> in the period 2000 to 2004. Air transport was directly responsible for £3.6billion in tax and national insurance contributions in 2004/5, which includes £0.9billion raised in Air Passenger Duty (APD), a figure set to double after APD rates were doubled in February 2007. Because of the global nature of the industry, article 15 of the Chicago Convention effectively prevents the imposition of fuel duty on aviation, and the industry does not pay Value Added Tax (VAT). Environmental groups argue that these, along with duty-free sales, are iniquitous tax concessions valued at £9billion annually. Despite generating £6.9billion in exports in 2004, representing 3 per cent of all UK exports and 7 per cent of the total export of services, the patronage in the UK of air transport services provided by overseas airlines resulted in a £3.3billion balance of payments deficit attributable to the industry.|$|E

25|$|One {{narrative}} {{for explaining}} {{the economic and}} budgetary performance during President Obama's tenure uses sectoral balances. By definition, a country running a trade deficit (capital surplus) and where private savings exceeds <b>business</b> <b>investment</b> (private sector surplus) must run a government budget deficit, as the three must net to zero. Both Martin Wolf and Paul Krugman explained that as the Great Recession hit, the saving (deleveraging) {{of the private sector}} significantly increased, while <b>business</b> <b>investment</b> declined in the face of reduced consumer spending. This created an enormous private sector surplus. Since the trade deficit did not change significantly, the offset was a large increase in the government budget deficit. The record drop in tax revenue and large increases in automatic stabilizer expenditures (such as unemployment compensation, food stamps, and disability payments) were the mechanism for much of the additional deficit and debt increases, even before new economic policies were implemented. The significant reduction in demand implied by the increase in the private sector surplus (i.e., consumers and businesses saving rather than spending or investing) created a severe recession.|$|E
40|$|Objectives of {{the study}} The general {{aim of this study}} is to apply issue selling theory into a new {{research}} area, namely capital investments. Issue selling activities especially arise when organizations face considerable changes. Hence, a more particular objective is to outline the issue selling strategies used to further new <b>business</b> <b>investments</b> supporting the redirection of an organization. Influence strategies in the capital budgeting setting have not been analyzed with issue selling theory before. As such this study adds importantly to the existing research in both fields. As a result, an issue selling framework is refined to better demonstrate the reality of attaining attention and acceptance for new <b>business</b> <b>investments.</b> Methodology The study was performed as a case study, with a case company from the forest industry. Data gathering focused especially on new <b>business</b> <b>investments,</b> one investment project being the core case. In practice, material was collected through thematic interviews with key organizational actors. Using the case study method and interviews was the key to accumulating concentrated but deep data, which was essential for gaining enough insights into the sensitive subject. Key results The key findings of this study relate to demonstrating the applicability of issue selling in relation to capital budgeting, discovering the increased importance issue selling for new <b>business</b> <b>investments</b> and gathering further evidence on the specialized nature of such <b>investments.</b> Furthermore, new <b>business</b> <b>investments</b> were found to require different issue selling actions than <b>investments</b> into existing <b>businesses.</b> These differences related to the importance of demonstrating a long-term vision, the central role of skilled issue sellers and a widened need for issue selling preparations. Moreover, expert use of information was found to form the basis for all issue selling efforts, especially since reliable information related to new <b>business</b> <b>investments</b> is often in short supply. Overall, this study contributes to existing theory by adapting an issue selling framework to the capital budgeting context, particularly answering to the specific needs of new <b>business</b> <b>investments.</b> In addition to creating a good basis for further research, the revised framework can be adapted into practice to enhance investment issue selling successfulness...|$|R

50|$|In {{spite of}} their differences, however, both a {{cash-flow}} consumption tax and an SHS tax require that dollars paid out as <b>business</b> or <b>investment</b> expenses be eliminated from the base. This is necessary under a cash-flow consumption tax because <b>business</b> and <b>investment</b> expenses are not consumption and it is necessary under an SHS tax because these expenditures are neither consumption nor additions to savings. Since <b>business</b> and <b>investment</b> outlays {{have no place in}} the base of either tax, intuition suggests that <b>business</b> and <b>investment</b> interest expenses would be treated identically under a cash-flow consumption tax and an SHS tax. But they are not. The SHS tax and the cash-flow consumption tax take different structural approaches to the treatment of <b>business</b> and <b>investment</b> interest outlays although both systems share the general objective of removing current <b>business</b> and <b>investment</b> costs from the tax base.|$|R

25|$|Albert Marsh of Mobile, Alabama {{established}} the commercial hamster {{industry in the}} United States in the 1940s. Marsh first got a hamster when he was gambling and won it in a wager. Somehow he got more hamsters after this one, perhaps from the breeding stock managed by Guy Henry Faget in Carville, Louisiana. At the time, Marsh was a highway engineer but unemployed. After getting his hamsters, he learned to breed them and founded Marsh Enterprises and the Gulf Hamstery, which promoted Syrian hamsters as pets, for laboratory use, and in business schemes. Marsh took advertisements in magazines, comics, and livestock trade journals which praised hamsters as pets and presented the idea that breeding hamsters was a good <b>business</b> <b>investment.</b> In his business, he shipped hamsters to {{people who would be}} breeders, then he coordinated the shipment of various breeders' hamsters to other breeders or to laboratories.|$|E
