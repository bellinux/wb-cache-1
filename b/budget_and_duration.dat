40|$|Estimation of {{drilling}} <b>budget</b> <b>and</b> <b>duration</b> is a high-level challenge {{for oil and}} gas industry. This is due to the many uncertain activities in the drilling procedure such as material prices, overhead cost, inflation, oil prices, well type, and depth {{of drilling}}. Therefore, it is essential to consider all these uncertain variables and the nature of relationships between them. This eventually leads into the minimization of the level of uncertainty and yet makes a "good" estimation points for <b>budget</b> <b>and</b> <b>duration</b> given the well type. In this paper, the copula probability theory is used in order to model the dependencies between cost/duration and MRI (mechanical risk index). The MRI is a mathematical computation, which relates various drilling factors such as: water depth, measured depth, true vertical depth in addition to mud weight and horizontal displacement. In general, the value of MRI is utilized as an input for the drilling cost and duration estimations. Therefore, modeling the uncertain dependencies between MRI and both cost and duration using copulas is important. The cost and duration estimates for each well were extracted from the copula dependency model where research study simulate over 10, 000 scenarios. These new estimates were later compared to the actual data in order to validate the performance of the procedure. Most of the wells show moderate - weak relationship of MRI dependence, which means that the variation in these wells can be related to MRI but {{to the extent that it}} is not the primary source...|$|E

Rotation {{construction}} method includes {{building the}} bridge {{parallel to the}} obstacle being spanned (a river, a highway or a railway) and then rotating the superstructure into place. The method can optimize bridge construction in terms of reducing impacts on traffic, safety, and overall project <b>budget</b> <b>and</b> <b>duration.</b> Therefore, the method became so popular {{that it has been}} used successfully in about one-hundred bridges in China. In this paper, taking the Suifenhe cable-stayed Bridge as project background, the design idea (single point with flat hinge) of bearing system has been brought forward. The successful rotation construction of Suifenhe cable-stayed Bridge proved the feasibility and technical advancement of the horizontal rotation construction method with flat hinge in similar engineering construction, especially the bridges with symmetry structure...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{ultimate}} goal of any construction company is to make profit and thereby earn money {{at the end of}} each undertaken project. In order to achieve this goal, construction companies should complete the projects within their anticipated <b>budgets</b> <b>and</b> <b>durations,</b> <b>and</b> expected quality targets. However in most construction projects severe cost overruns occur due to various factors. Experiencing cost overruns is a very important problem for construction companies, but especially for micro-scaled construction companies. Severe cost overruns may even cause micro-scaled construction companies’ bankruptcies. Therefore, micro-scaled construction companies should thoroughly analyze the factors that prevail in the project in question. The main objective of this study is to investigate the importance levels of factors that may bring about cost overruns in construction projects undertaken by micro-scaled construction companies. For this purpose, an extensive literature review was conducted and 38 factors were identified. These factors were categorized into 7 major groups, which are: 1) Contract-related factors, 2) Time-related factors, 3) Cost-related factors, 4) Quality-related factors, 5) Human resource-related factors, 6) Communications-related factors, and 7) Risk-related factors. A questionnaire, which consists of 10 questions, was designed based on information gathered from the literature review. The questionnaire mainly comprises 3 sections. These questionnaires were delivered to 136 micro-scaled construction companies. Out of these 136 companies, 78 returned completed questionnaires. This accounts for a response rate of 57 %. Reliability and ranking analyses were carried out on the collected data. The survey results indicated that design problems (i. e., design changes, constructability problems, delays in design approvals) is the most critical factor...|$|R

Storage system used to store most of the organization’s data needs to be accessed frequently. Thus, storage has become a vital part of an organization and needs to be available almost anytime. In order to maximize reliability and the availability of their data, many of organization converts their storage into a cloud storage platform. To set up a cloud server, a lot of consideration is needed. One of the main considerations is cost. Setting up a cloud storage without proper strategies will involve very high cost in future. In order to make sure the cloud storage server operates at maximum reliability in a certain amount of time, a high budget for servers is required. High server cost is required in order to obtain maximum reliability. Thus, setting up target duration will help organizations to control the cost without having to compromise the storage reliability. This research will focus on finding maximum server reliability based on target duration and cost constraint. In this thesis, maximum reliability is defined by using two main objectives which are <b>budget</b> <b>and</b> <b>duration.</b> The multi objective optimization technique is used in order to find the optimum point from the constraint. The optimal result will be the minimum number of servers required to achieve maximum reliability according to target duration...|$|E

Presented at the 12 th Annual Capitol Graduate Research Summit, Topeka, KS, February 12, 2015. In this paper, {{a mathematical model}} is developed to address two problems. The first problem is on healthcare delivery planning in which {{the objective is to}} diagnose and treat as many patients as possible by determining the locations to be visited assuming that patients have the ability to travel a predetermined distance, e. g., to clinics in different locations. For example, a doctor may plan to visit many locations with Ebola patients in a country in Africa. In the case of a natural disaster, where there may be significant damage to the existing infrastructure, a similar scenario may happen. The second problem considers a politician who would like to visit as many locations as possible while attracting voters who would consider travelling to the campaign centers from other locations. In both applications, it is assumed that there is a limited <b>budget</b> <b>and</b> <b>duration</b> to achieve these objectives. These problems are modeled as a mixed integer mathematical model-a variation of travelling salesman problem with covering, budget and time constraints which is known to be an NP-Hard problem. In order to solve this problem efficiently in a reasonable amount of time, a hybrid genetic algorithm is developed. Extensive computational results are presented. It is observed that where there is very limited budget and time, or very extensive resources, solving the resulting problem takes significantly less computational resources compared with other problems.

This study {{is the first to}} investigate the effect of marine traffic on the behaviour of bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus in the Istanbul Strait, Turkey. The Istanbul Strait (also known as the Bosphorus) is one of the busiest international waterways in the world and is exposed to dense marine traffic. The effect of marine traffic, location and season on the behavioural transitions was investigated through general log-linear analysis. Further, the changes on the behavioural <b>budget</b> <b>and</b> bout <b>duration</b> were assessed using Markov chains. Results showed that marine vessels were the main driving force for the behavioural transitions. These changes in transitions between behaviours led to significant changes in behavioural <b>budget</b> <b>and</b> bout <b>durations</b> (average time in each behavioural state). Surface-feeding, resting and socialising behaviour significantly de creased in the control budget, while diving showed an increase in the presence of vessels. Moreover, dolphins spent less time surface-feeding, resting, socialising and diving once disrupted. Furthermore, the current level of vessel-dolphin interaction (51 %) in the Istanbul Strait was sufficiently high to alter the dolphins' cumulative behavioural budget significantly. Finally, speed and distance of vessels played a considerable role in the directional responses of dolphins. These results raise concerns on the potential biological consequences of the observed behavioural changes, considering that the population is already classified 'at risk' and is still lacking species-specific conservation plans. The results of the study must be considered immediately to create protected zones in order to mitigate the vessel-dolphin interactions...|$|R

Many governments and other agencies have had great difficulty in promoting and financing infrastructure development using public private partnerships (PPPs). Therefore, {{it is essential that}} supporting agencies and financiers conduct effective pre-design and pre-construction analysis and evaluation of the proposed projects. Traditional approaches have tended to focus on the meeting <b>budget</b> <b>and</b> project <b>duration</b> targets, but these single dimension evaluations may not take account of the more complex legal, organisational and financial interfaces created by multiple stakeholder interactions. More effective approaches, mechanisms and frameworks are essential in this early stage volatile environment and this paper attempts to address some of the vital issues involved in the inception stages of major infrastructure projects using PPPs. Stakeholders must have an effective performance measurement framework to evaluate PPPs before they make crucial decisions on major infrastructure projects. Fundamental to creating a new approach is to gain an understanding what evaluation methods are used at present by reviewing the important literature on PPPs. The paper concentrates on PPP characteristics and performance measurement. Analysis of the literature indicates that a more feasible framework based on the performance prism can capture more of the distinct characteristics of PPPs and is a more suitable framework for conducting these early project evaluations, providing more efficient performance measurement...|$|R

The {{purpose of}} this research is {{to examine the relationship between}} strategic planning and corporate results in volatile environments such as the Middle East and in particular the broadcasting industry. Broadcasting is known for being affected by many exogenous factors such as political and economical. We analyzed the major components of the strategic planning: <b>Budget,</b> Resources <b>and</b> <b>Duration.</b> We noticed a tight relationship between the strategic planning components and corporate results. The efficiency of the strategic planning would vary with the modification of these components. In addition to that we noticed a clear relationship between corporate results and channels typologies whereas major general entertainment channels are capturing the biggest share of the total advertising revenues. The budget allocated to the strategic plan represents a share of the total revenues dedicated to the expenditrrres of the planning team. We divided the budget into sections to identify the part that would be more sensitive to the channels output. Resources allocated represent the number of employee working in the strategy unit. The total number will vary from one company to another. The duration of the strategic plan represent the period covered by this plan. It could vary from one to five years according to the main objectives of the company. On the other hand, channels typologies represent the programming strategy of the channel. The focus was on channels with general entertainment as main programs versus channels with education as mam content. We analyzed the effect of each of these components on the channels results that would include: share of audience, share of advertising revenues and reach. Share of audience (SOA) would represent the number of Arabic Viewers that are watching this channel. It is computed as a percentage from the total population. Share of advertising revenues represents the shares that the channel is capturing from the total advertising spend in the broadcast industry. Finally, reach represents the transmission coverage of the channel. 1 bound copy: ii, 78 leaves; ill. (some col.); 30 cm. available at RNL...|$|R

Choosing a cloud provider and service option (e.g., a database-as-a-service or a manually configured set of virtual machines) typically requires the estimation of the cost <b>and</b> migration <b>duration</b> for each considered option. Many organisations also require this information for <b>budgeting</b> <b>and</b> planning purposes. Existing cloud migration research focuses on the software components, and therefore does not address this need. We introduce a two-stage approach which accurately estimates the migration cost, migration <b>duration</b> <b>and</b> cloud running costs of relational databases. The first stage of our approach obtains workload and structure models of the database to be migrated from database logs and the database schema. The second stage performs a discrete-event simulation using these models to obtain the cost <b>and</b> <b>duration</b> estimates. We implemented software tools that automate both stages of our approach. An extensive evaluation compares the estimates from our approach against results from real-world cloud database migrations.|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to review the {{normative}} literature in regard to public-private partnerships (PPPs) and their evaluations, and attempts to investigate whether the Performance Prism is a feasible framework for effective PPP performance measurement. Design/methodology/approach - An in-depth and critical literature review is conducted in this study. Discussion concentrates on PPP features, performance measurement in PPPs, performance measurement in construction, and characteristics of the Performance Prism. Findings - The Performance Prism exhibits a strong ability to capture the distinct features of PPP infrastructure projects and can be considered as a framework suitable for effective and efficient performance measurement. Practical implications - It is essential that stakeholders have a feasible performance measurement framework to effectively measure performance as they embark on PPP infrastructure projects. This paper can be used as a theoretical base and conceptual framework capable of assisting in the design and selection of effective performance measures for PPPs. Originality/value - Many governments across the world use PPPs to procure public assets owing to the scarce funds available for infrastructure development. Effective performance measurement is critical to the successful delivery of a PPP project. Conventional ex post evaluation that solely focuses on meeting <b>budget</b> <b>and</b> predetermined project <b>duration</b> is being widely used to measure PPPs in practice. PPPs are more complicated than traditional procurement due to their multiple stakeholder integrations and long-term processes. However, the research on effective PPP performance measurement is limited for addressing such vital issues, and this paper attempts to bridge this knowledge gap...|$|R
