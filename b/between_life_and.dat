5|$|Up {{through the}} 19th century, {{the scope of}} biology was largely divided between medicine, which {{investigated}} questions of form and function (i.e., physiology), and natural history, which was concerned with the diversity of life and interactions among different forms of life and <b>between</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> non-life. By 1900, much of these domains overlapped, while natural history (and its counterpart natural philosophy) had largely given way to more specialized scientific disciplines—cytology, bacteriology, morphology, embryology, geography, and geology.|$|E
5|$|Amonkhet has The Gatewatch set out {{to destroy}} the evil dragon planeswalker Nicol Bolas after {{learning}} of his dominion over the titular desert plane Amonkhet. In the desert, they find a city (Naktamun) teeming with food, water, and life, ruled by five gods, with Bolas seemingly absent altogether. The people of Naktamun train their entire lives to die in ritual combat, hoping to experience pure bliss in the afterlife when the God-Pharaoh (Bolas) returns to Amonkhet. In Hour of Devastation, Bolas returns as prophesied, only to raze Naktamun and reveal the true purpose of the training and combat: to create an army of physically-perfect and combat-adept mummies {{to serve as an}} unquestionably loyal army. The block's setting is based ancient Egypt, with themes of social hierarchy and contrast <b>between</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> death.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} two episodes, it is {{revealed}} that Wirt and Greg are actually two boys from the modern era.

Wirt, attempting to take back an embarrassing poetry tape he made for a girl he likes, had followed her to a graveyard scary story gathering before a police officer scared him and Greg into jumping over the cemetery's garden wall. On the other side of the wall, they landed on train tracks where Greg was almost hit by a train. Wirt pushed them both off a hill into a lake/river in an attempt to save him, knocking them both unconscious in the process and sending them to a Limbo-like realm <b>between</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> death.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to look at the {{relationship}} <b>between</b> <b>life</b> satisfaction <b>and</b> farm involvement among dairy farm men and women in Utah. Farm involvement is defined as farm tasks, decision making, and participation in farm organizations. A sample of 116 couples were drawn from five counties in Utah. The husbands and wives were each interviewed separately. The sample is representative of the dairy farms in these five counties. However, the results of this study cannot be generalized to other types of farms in Utah or dairy farms from other locations. The correlation <b>between</b> <b>life</b> satisfaction <b>and</b> farm tasks, decision-making patterns, and participation in farm organizations was computed separately for the men and the women. Next, a correlation <b>between</b> <b>life</b> satisfaction <b>and</b> farm tasks, decision-making patterns, and participation in farm organizations was computed for men and women separately based on three farm sizes: small with 50 or fewer milk cows, medium with 51 to 150 milk cows, and large with over 150 milk cows. The independent variable, farm tasks, was divided into four catagories: farm work, running errands, bookkeeping, and supervising farm workers. The independent variable, decision - making patterns, was divided into two catagories: farm decisions and home decisions. The correlation <b>between</b> <b>life</b> satisfaction <b>and</b> participation in farm organizations was statistically significant for dairy farm men overall (r=-. 24, p=. 008) and also for men from small farms (r=-. 37 p=. 006). A negative correlation on this variable is interpreted as more participation. The correlation <b>between</b> <b>life</b> satisfaction <b>and</b> bookkeeping for women from small farms was statistically significant (r=-. 28, p=. 043). The correlation <b>between</b> <b>life</b> satisfaction <b>and</b> farm decisions for women from small farms was statistically significant (r=. 31, p=. 024). The correlation <b>between</b> <b>life</b> satisfaction <b>and</b> home decisions for women from small farms was statistically significant (r=-. 41, p=. OO 1). Future research should explore in more detail the relationship <b>between</b> <b>life</b> satisfaction <b>and</b> membership in farm organizations and the use of these organizations...|$|R
5|$|La tragedia del silencio {{does not}} address political, social, or {{economic}} topics, nor different cultural aspects such as the lifestyle of the Colombian population. Acevedo did not intend for the film to create controversy, so it does not mention the situation in Colombia, {{the plot of the}} film instead focusing narrowly on one man's struggle <b>between</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> death. Although leprosy is the main theme of the film, there are other storylines that follow different protagonists and their motivations, such as the husband learning he must face his destiny when he learns about his disease, which requires him to separate from his family. After learning he does not have leprosy, he most confront a rival (the student) to regain the love of his wife.|$|E
5|$|Time {{is viewed}} as unredeemable and problematic, whereas eternity is {{beautiful}} and true. Living under time's influence is a problem. Within Burnt Norton section 3, people trapped in time {{are similar to those}} stuck in <b>between</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> death in Inferno Canto Three. When Eliot deals with the past in The Dry Salvages, he emphasises its importance to combat the influence of evolution as encouraging people to forget the past and care only about the present and the future. The present is capable of always reminding one of the past. These moments also rely on the idea of Krishna in the Bhagavad-Gita that death can come at any moment, and that the divine will is more important than considering the future.|$|E

25|$|According to Hindu belief, death {{happens on}} two levels: a {{physical}} death and a ritual death.

25|$|Traditional Acoma {{religion}} stresses harmony <b>between</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> nature. The sun is {{a representative}} of the Creator deity. Mountains surrounding the community, the sun above, and the earth below help to balance and define the Acoma world. Traditional religious ceremonies may revolve around the weather, including seeking to ensure healthy rainfall. The Acoma also use kachinas in rituals. The Pueblos also had one or more kivas, which served as religious chambers. The leader of each Pueblo would serve as the community religious leader, or cacique. The cacique would observe the sun {{and use it as a}} guide for scheduling ceremonies, some which were kept secret.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{challenges}} in defining death is in distinguishing it from life. Death would seem to refer to either the moment life ends, or when the state that follows life begins. However, determining when death has occurred is difficult, as cessation of life functions is often not simultaneous across organ systems. Such determination therefore requires drawing conceptual lines <b>between</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> death. This is problematic, however, because there is little consensus over how to define life. The nature of death has for millennia been a central concern of the world's religious traditions and of philosophical inquiry. Many religions maintain faith in either a kind of afterlife or reincarnation for the soul, or resurrection of the body at a later date.|$|E
