25|$|Eighteen wickets fell on {{the frantic}} first day at St Lawrence Ground, and {{nineteen}} on the second, as two teams clashed in an interesting, low scoring match that lasted for only 173.4 overs. The Bangladesh A tourists had won the coin toss and chosen to bat, but immediately lost Nafees Iqbal for a duck. However, Tushar Imran made 86, and with some help from Shahriar Nafees (with 30) and Nazimuddin (27), he took the score to 185. That total did not look challenging, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>before</b> Syed Rasel's medium pace came to the scene. After Niall O'Brien and Neil Dexter put on 13 for the first wicket for Kent, Rasel and Shahadat Hossain dug out two wickets each, as Kent lost four wickets for two runs. Rasel took three more wickets before stumps on day one, and two more on the second morning, to end with seven for 50 - the only five-wicket-haul of Bangladesh A on the tour. However, only Shahriar Nafees passed 20 in the second innings, Tushar lost his golden touch (before this innings, he had made 455 runs at a batting average of 65) to only scamper 12 runs, while Antiguan-born Robbie Joseph took five for 19 with his pace bowling. Kent were set 188 to win, and lost wickets at regular intervals, but 54 from the first-class debutant Dexter {{turned out to be}} crucial as Kent made it with three wickets to spare.|$|E

Prior to the CSB-UPHSD game, San Beda and Letran faced off with the Red Lions winning by five points, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>before</b> Letran's Kris Alas pushed Sudan Daniel, that started a free-for-all; Letran's Jaypee Belencion confronted fans at the stands, and Kevin's father Louie Alas, Letran's head coach, had to shield his wife from debris being pelted on the court.|$|R
