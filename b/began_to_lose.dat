5|$|However, under Barroso, the Commission <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> {{ground to}} the larger member states as {{countries}} such as France, the UK and Germany sought to sideline its role.

5|$|On August 23, {{the storm}} began a {{weakening}} trend {{and it turned}} towards the north. The next day, the storm—having weakened to Category 1 status—skirted the southeastern tip of Newfoundland. Debbie <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> its tropical characteristics as it accelerated towards the northeast, and it weakened into a tropical storm early on August 25. As it moved over increasingly cold waters, it dissipated east of Greenland.|$|E
5|$|Although most {{tropical}} cyclones {{that become}} extratropical quickly dissipate or are absorbed by another weather system, {{they can still}} retain winds of hurricane or gale force. In 1954, Hurricane Hazel became extratropical over North Carolina as a strong Category 3 storm. The Columbus Day Storm of 1962, which evolved from the remains of Typhoon Freda, caused heavy damage in Oregon and Washington, with widespread damage equivalent to at least a Category 3. In 2005, Hurricane Wilma <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> tropical characteristics while still sporting Category 3-force winds (and became fully extratropical as a Category 1 storm).|$|E

With Matt Kemp and Justin Upton added to the Padres' lineup, Black hoped to reduce the pressure on Gyorko to perform.

5|$|In the mid-1820s, when Manuel José García was Minister of Finance, the {{government}} borrowed heavily to finance new projects {{and to pay}} off war debts. These loans were tendered at usurious rates: in one notorious loan, {{the government}} received credit for £570,000 from the Baring Brothers {{in exchange for a}} debt of £1,000,000. In the 1820s, the peso papel <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> value rapidly with respect to the peso fuerte, which was linked to the price of gold. In 1827 the peso papel was devalued by 33%, and was devalued again by 68% in 1829.|$|E
5|$|Located {{just east}} of a strong cold front, the minimal {{hurricane}} continued to speed over progressively cooler waters. Shary gradually <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> its convective symmetry, though the small eye remained distinguishable in microwave images. Within hours, rapid interaction with the front had begun to occur, suggesting the storm was entering an extratropical transition. Data from cyclone phase space diagrams indicated Shary had become post-tropical about 530miles (885km) south-southeast of Cape Race, and the NHC discontinued advisories. Later on that day, the extratropical remnants of Hurricane Shary were completely absorbed by the same neighboring system.|$|E

In addition, drug use was starting to affect Richards' productivity, and Taylor felt {{some of his own}} creative contributions were going unrecognised. At the end of 1974, with a recording session already booked in Munich to record another album, Taylor quit the Rolling Stones.|$|E
5|$|The {{fall of the}} {{communist}} regime marked {{a new chapter in}} the history of Poland and in the history of Solidarity. Having defeated {{the communist}} government, Solidarity found itself in a role it was much less prepared for — that of a political party — and soon <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> popularity. Conflicts among Solidarity factions intensified. Wałęsa was elected Solidarity chairman, but support for him could be seen to be crumbling. One of his main opponents, Władysław Frasyniuk, withdrew from elections altogether. In September 1990, Wałęsa declared that Gazeta Wyborcza had no right to use the Solidarity logo.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} act {{of civil disobedience}} during the Pittston strike was Moss 3.

Thousands of people had already been arrested and a lot of money had been spent on a cause that seemed to be never ending. Union members knew that something had to be done to regain the spirit of the strike and make it clear to Pittston that they would not give up.|$|E

He defeated Cielo, who then decided not swim backstroke anymore. At age 15, Cielo attended a series of trainings in Florida, USA, and returned home, willing to defeat Guido. When Cielo and Guido were reunited in a 100m freestyle contest, Guido fell behind and lost. From then on, Guido focused on backstroke, reversing positions with Cielo.|$|E
5|$|Early on September 24, Karl {{continued}} its north-northeast track over the open north-central Atlantic {{and continued to}} gradually weaken. It started to {{come in contact with}} the baroclinic zone and <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> tropical characteristics, while still a Category1 hurricane. Karl became extratropical shortly afterward over the northern Atlantic at about 47°N, with its winds dropping below hurricane strength shortly thereafter. The extratropical storm made landfall on the Faroe Islands with hurricane-force wind gusts. As an extratropical low, the cyclone moved northeastward and eastward across the North Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea, eventually reaching Norway before it was absorbed into another extratropical low late on September 28.|$|E
5|$|In 1185 John {{made his}} first visit to Ireland, {{accompanied}} by 300 knights and a team of administrators. Henry had tried to have John officially proclaimed King of Ireland, but Pope Lucius III would not agree. John's first period of rule in Ireland was not a success. Ireland had only recently been conquered by Anglo-Norman forces, and tensions were still rife between Henry II, the new settlers and the existing inhabitants. John infamously offended the local Irish rulers by making fun of their unfashionable long beards, failed to make allies amongst the Anglo-Norman settlers, <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> ground militarily against the Irish and finally returned to England later in the year, blaming the viceroy, Hugh de Lacy, for the fiasco.|$|E

5|$|In 1963, the Diệm regime <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> its {{tight control}} over the country as civil unrest spread {{as a result of}} the Buddhist crisis. Large scale demonstrations by the Buddhist {{majority}} erupted in response to the government shootings of nine Buddhists in Huế who were protesting against a ban on the flying of the Buddhist flag during Vesak, the birthday of Gautama Buddha. With Diệm remaining intransigent in the face of Buddhist demands for religious equality, sections of society began calling for his removal from power. Thảo was part of the many plots that engulfed Saigon, destabilising the regime. Aiming for a 15 July coup, Tuyến consulted with Thảo regarding his plans, but Tuyến was too closely associated with Nhu to recruit the necessary military aid and he was subsequently exiled by Nhu.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of the few centuries up until the current version of 1957, the coat of arms has {{undergone}} some distinctly visible changes. While some 15th-century portrayals already show a child figure instead of the monk, the monk in representations onwards <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> its serious disposition, with curly hair and a more youthful-looking face. By the 18th century and especially the 19th century, the monk had been minimised into the Münchner Kindl, Bavarian for Munich Child, a reference to the figure first documented in 1727, although it is not clear when it appeared on the coat of arms for the first time or who coined the term. The transformation was brought about by artists such as sculptors and painters as well as copper and seal engravers, as opposed to a legal order.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} few decades of the 20th century, Minneapolis <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> its {{dominant}} position in the flour milling industry, after reaching its peak in 1915–1916. The rise of steam power, and later electric power, eroded the advantage that St. Anthony Falls provided in water power. The wheat fields of the Dakotas and Minnesota's Red River Valley began suffering from soil exhaustion due to consecutive wheat crops, leading {{to an increase in}} wheat leaf rust and related crop diseases. The farmers of the southern plains developed a variety of hardy red winter wheat suitable for bread flour, and the Kansas City area gained prominence in milling. Also, due to changes in rail shipping rates, millers in Buffalo, New York were able to ship their flour more competitively.|$|E

5|$|Inga {{accelerated}} somewhat as {{it passed}} to the southeast of Bermuda. By the morning hours of October 5, {{it was determined that}} the hurricane posed no significant threat to the island. At 1200 UTC, the storm's lowest known barometric pressure of 964 millibars was recorded. Shortly thereafter, it briefly strengthened to Category 3 status; the cyclone peaked with maximum sustained winds of 115mph (185km/h). As it moved towards the open waters of the Atlantic and entered a cooler environment, it deteriorated to Category 1 intensity on October 6. The hurricane slowed again, and as cold air became entrained into its circulation, it <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> tropical characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, John {{undertook}} {{an expedition}} to Ireland in 1185, which was not a success. Ireland had only recently been conquered by Anglo-Norman forces, and tensions were still rife between Henry's representatives, the new settlers and the existing inhabitants. John offended the local Irish rulers, failed to make allies amongst the Anglo-Norman settlers, <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> ground militarily against the Irish, and finally returned to England within the year. In 1186 Henry was about to return John to Ireland once again, when news came that Geoffrey {{had died in a}} tournament at Paris, leaving two young children; this event once again changed the balance of power between Henry and his remaining sons.|$|E
5|$|Mikoyan {{became an}} early convert to the Bolshevik cause. He {{was a strong}} {{supporter}} of Stalin during the immediate post-Lenin years. During Stalin's rule, Mikoyan held several high governmental posts, including that of Minister of Foreign Trade. By the end of Stalin's rule, Mikoyan <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> favour with him, and in 1949, Mikoyan lost his long-standing post of minister of foreign trade. In October 1952 at the 19th Party Congress Stalin even attacked Mikoyan viciously. When Stalin died in 1953, Mikoyan again took a leading role in policy-making. He backed Khrushchev and his de-Stalinization policy, and became First Deputy Premier under Khrushchev. Mikoyan's position under Khrushchev made him the second most powerful figure in the Soviet Union at the time.|$|E
