This distinction was abolished by the Larceny Act 1861, which enacted that whoever, being a bailee of any chattel, money or valuable security, should fraudulently take or convert the same to his own use, or the use of any person other than the owner, although he should not break bulk or otherwise determine the bailment, should be guilty of larceny (s. 3).|$|E

While this is a popular set-up for searching de Sitter vacua, we propose a new method to include supersymmetry breaking sources.

For sources <b>breaking</b> <b>bulk</b> supersymmetry, we propose to replace the DBI action by the pullback of a more general polyform, which is no longer pure. This generalization provides corrections to the energy-momentum tensor which give a positive contribution to the cosmological constant.

40|$|We {{examine a}} model in which an {{upstream}} firm can sell directly online and through heterogeneous intermediaries to heterogeneous consumers engaging in time-consuming search. Direct online sales may {{be more or less}} convenient and involve costly returns if the good fits consumers poorly. Direct selling appeals to higher-value consumers and increases the upstream firm’s profits by allowing price discrimination. Competition and segmentation due to direct sales results in lower intermediary prices, making all consumers better off. Thus, entry by an upstream firm increases consumer surplus at the expense of intermediaries with the net result being an increase in social welfare. Traditionally, services provided by intermediaries, such as managing inventory, <b>breaking</b> <b>bulk</b> shipments, supplying information, market-ing, and coordinating transactions, have been sufficiently difficult for producers that a substantial part of the economy has utilized intermedi-aries. 1 Advances in technology now allow producers to cost-effectively perform many tasks that previously required intermediaries.

40|$|ABSTRACT: With the {{advancement}} of information technology and increased market competition, construction companies are driven to employ supply chain management strategies to seek competitive advantage. Managing logistics is one component {{at the core of}} such strategies. An effective logistics system ensures delivery of the right products and services to the right customers at the right time while minimizing costs and rewarding all participants based on value added to the supply chain. As a component of a logistics system, logistics centres can serve the construction industry by offering services such as: storage, transport, distribution, assembly, kitting, consolidation, sorting, <b>breaking</b> <b>bulk,</b> cross-docking, and e-commerce. This paper focuses on the role logistics centres may play and the impact they may have on construction supply chains. Construction companies may configure their logistics centres in different ways to match their global and local supply chain strategy, while addressing challenges posed by variation in demand and supply for material, equipment, and services. A hypothesis is that logistics centres are underused in this industry, yet may offer considerable advantage. The ultimate aim of the research that is reported on here is developing a logistics system to support project-based production needs. The authors present a simulation model of a logistic centre that supports multiple site stores on different construction projects facing variations in supply lead times. The objective of the simulation is to find an approach to reduce material management costs while avoiding resource shortages, and enhancing both reliability and responsiveness of the supply chain...|$|E
