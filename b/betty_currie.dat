50|$|Socks, the cat of President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, {{lived in}} Hollywood after the Clintons left the White House in 2001.

50|$|<b>Betty</b> <b>Currie</b> (born Betty Grace Williams; November 10, 1939) is {{the former}} {{personal}} secretary for Bill Clinton (during his tenure as President of the United States). She became well known as a figure in the Lewinsky scandal for her alleged handling of gifts given to Monica Lewinsky by President Clinton.|$|E
5000|$|The 1993 Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography {{recognized}} the AP [...] "portfolio of images {{drawn from the}} 1992 presidential campaign". The same Prize in 1999 recognized its [...] "striking collection of photographs of the key players and events stemming from President Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky and the ensuing impeachment hearings." [...] Savoia snapped Clinton's personal secretary <b>Betty</b> <b>Currie</b> and her attorney Lawrence Wechsler outside a courthouse.|$|E
5000|$|Socks Clinton (Spring 1989 - February 20, 2009) was the pet cat of U.S. President Bill Clinton's family {{during his}} presidency. As an adopted stray cat, {{he was the}} only pet of the Clintons {{during the early years of}} the administration, and his {{likeness}} hosted the children's version of the White House website. [...] After Clinton left office, Socks resided with former Clinton secretary <b>Betty</b> <b>Currie</b> and her husband, owing to continuing conflicts with Clinton's dog Buddy.|$|E
5000|$|Socks found Buddy's {{intrusion}} intolerable: {{according to}} Hillary Clinton, Socks [...] "despised Buddy from first sight, instantly and forever." [...] Bill Clinton said, [...] "I did better with ... the Palestinians and the Israelis than I've done with Socks and Buddy." [...] When the Clintons left the White House in 2001 they took Buddy {{to their new}} home, but left Socks {{under the care of}} Bill Clinton's secretary, <b>Betty</b> <b>Currie.</b> Buddy would die within a year, being hit by a car in 2002.|$|E
5000|$|Clinton {{acquired}} Buddy as a three-month-old puppy from Caroline County, Maryland in December 1997. He {{named him}} after his late great-uncle, Henry Oren [...] "Buddy" [...] Grisham, {{who had died}} the previous June and whom Clinton often cited as {{a major influence on}} his life.Socks did not get along with the frisky Buddy, so the White House had to keep the two in separate quarters. Since this arrangement would be no longer possible in the Clintons' smaller home in New York, Socks was left under the care of Bill Clinton's secretary, <b>Betty</b> <b>Currie.</b>|$|E
5000|$|After the House Judiciary Committee and the United States House of Representatives impeached Clinton on December 19, {{the matter}} then {{passed to the}} United States Senate. Blumenthal {{was one of four}} {{witnesses}} called to testify before the Senate. No live witnesses were called; the four were interviewed on videotape. His testimony addressed the key [...] "lie": that Clinton was allegedly pressuring <b>Betty</b> <b>Currie</b> and Blumenthal himself to attest that it was Lewinsky who initially pursued Clinton, not vice versa. Lewinsky stated {{she was the one who}} instigated the relationship. The Senate acquitted Clinton of perjury and impeachment proceedings ended.|$|E
5000|$|On February 6, 1999, while Bill Clinton's Senate {{trial was}} winding {{down at the}} time, Darrell Hammond (playing Clinton) gives an Oval Office address assuring the American public {{that he will not}} gloat over his certain victory. However, the events {{occurring}} behind and around him suggest otherwise. Streamers are put up on the windows; Hillary Clinton, Al Gore, Vernon Jordan and Monica Lewinsky drink beer; Clinton holds up a picture of a horse's posterior instead of a picture of House impeachment manager Henry Hyde (thanks to an [...] "honest mistake" [...] during a tribute); and <b>Betty</b> <b>Currie</b> dances to [...] "Chain of Fools". At the end, Clinton drops the facade and opens the show with [...] "Live, from New York, it's Gloatin' Time!" ...|$|E
5000|$|While {{living in}} the White House the Clintons had two pets: a cat named Socks and a dog named Buddy. Socks, born about 1989, {{was adopted by the}} Clintons in 1991. The cat was left under the care of Bill Clinton's {{secretary}} <b>Betty</b> <b>Currie,</b> residing with her until Socks' death on February 20, 2009, euthanized due to cancer of the jaw. Buddy, a Labrador Retriever born on August 7, 1997, was acquired by the Clintons on December 5, 1997. Buddy was named after Clinton's late great uncle Henry Oren Grisham, nicknamed [...] "Buddy". The Clintons kept Buddy after they left the White House in January 2001 however the dog was hit by a car on January 2, 2002, and died. The two pets were reported to not get along. Clinton adopted a new dog in 2005, whom he named Seamus.|$|E
