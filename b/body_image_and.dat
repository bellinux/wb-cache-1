Media outlets had varying opinions of the song's genre, describing it as having soul, blues, gospel, and show tune influences.

5|$|Once {{patients}} {{reach their}} teens, {{they need more}} specific information about pregnancy, birth control, self-esteem, and dating. Teenagers with lost or reduced genital sensation benefit from education about alternative ways to experience pleasure and satisfaction from sexual acts. The teen years are often particularly difficult for those with SCI, in terms of <b>body</b> <b>image</b> <b>and</b> relationships. Given the importance they place on sexuality and privacy, adolescents may experience humiliation when parents or caregivers bathe them or take care of bowel and bladder needs. They can benefit from sexuality counseling, support groups, and mentoring by adults with SCI who can share experiences and lead discussions with peers. With the right care and education from family and professionals, injured children and adolescents can develop into sexually healthy adults.|$|E
5|$|Drugs, devices, surgery, {{and other}} {{interventions}} exist to help men achieve erection and ejaculation. Although male fertility is reduced, many men with SCI can still father children, particularly with medical interventions. Women's fertility {{is not usually}} affected, although precautions must be taken for safe pregnancy and delivery. People with SCI need to take measures during sexual activity to deal with SCI effects such as weakness and movement limitations, and to avoid injuries such as skin damage in areas of reduced sensation. Education and counseling about sexuality {{is an important part}} of SCI rehabilitation but is often missing or insufficient. Rehabilitation for children and adolescents aims to promote healthy development of sexuality and includes education for them and their families. Culturally inherited biases and stereotypes negatively affect people with SCI, particularly when held by professional caregivers. <b>Body</b> <b>image</b> <b>and</b> other insecurities affect sexual function, and have profound repercussions on self-esteem and self-concept. SCI causes difficulties in romantic partnerships, due to problems with sexual function and to other stresses introduced by the injury and disability, but many of those with SCI have fulfilling relationships and marriages. Relationships, self-esteem, and reproductive ability are all aspects of sexuality, which encompasses not just sexual practices but a complex array of factors: cultural, social, psychological, and emotional influences.|$|E
40|$|Objective: The current {{analysed}} {{the prospective}} effect of bullying on <b>body</b> <b>image</b> shame <b>and</b> disordered eating symptomatology in adolescent girls. Method: The {{study was conducted}} with 290 adolescent girls, and involved three waves of data collection assessing over time victimization experiences, <b>body</b> <b>image</b> shame <b>and</b> disordered eating symptomatology. At the beginning of the study, the participants average age was 13. 73 years (SD = 0. 78). Latent growth models were used to fit the data to identify the effect of bullying on the outcomes. Path analysis examined the mediator effect of <b>body</b> <b>image</b> shame on the association between bullying and disordered eating. Results: Bullying had a significant effect on the initial status of both <b>body</b> <b>image</b> shame <b>and</b> disordered eating. <b>Body</b> <b>image</b> shame <b>and</b> disordered eating growth was stable over time. <b>Body</b> <b>image</b> shame significantly mediated the relationship between bullying and disordered eating symptomatology.

40|$|Purpose: The {{present study}} {{examined}} the relationships between <b>body</b> <b>image</b> flexibility, <b>body</b> <b>image</b> dissatisfaction, <b>body</b> <b>image</b> evaluation, <b>and</b> specific coping factors based on the WEIGHTCOPE measure. <b>Body</b> <b>image</b> flexibility was also examined as a mediator {{of the relationship between}} <b>body</b> <b>image</b> dissatisfaction <b>and</b> weight-related coping factors in women. Methods: An online link of the survey (Qualtrics Research Software Program) was distributed through social media and word of mouth to women of all body shapes and sizes (N= 267). The survey included the BICS as a measure of <b>body</b> <b>image</b> dissatisfaction, the MBSR (AE) as a measure of <b>body</b> <b>image</b> evaluation, the BI-AAQ as a measure of <b>body</b> <b>image</b> flexibility, <b>and</b> the WEIGHTCOPE as a measure of weight-related coping. Findings: Results supported that <b>body</b> <b>image</b> dissatisfaction had significant relationships with particular coping factors as well as <b>body</b> <b>image</b> flexibility. Once determining these relationships, the mediation analysis supported the idea that <b>body</b> <b>image</b> flexibility had a role in the relationships between <b>body</b> <b>image</b> dissatisfaction <b>and</b> suggested negative weight related coping responses. Conclusions: The findings suggest the need to integrate interventions based on <b>body</b> <b>image</b> flexibility. Mindfulness based techniques address <b>body</b> <b>image</b> flexibility <b>and</b> can be utilized in treating <b>body</b> <b>image</b> dissatisfaction in women to help decrease negative coping behaviors...|$|R

40|$|Background: Vast {{changing}} environment and culture including mass media which commonly shows models {{with a very}} slim body may cause teenage girls feel fatty and not confident despite their normal body weight. This misperception may influence eating behavior {{and encourage them to}} lose weight by involving in some instant diets, for example, fad diets. Objective: To identify relationships between <b>body</b> <b>image</b> distortion, eating behavior, and fad diets among female adolescents in Yogyakarta. Method: This study was a cross-sectional study on 123 school girls at SMAN 8 Yogyakarta who have normal body mass index (BMI) according to WHO category. <b>Body</b> <b>image</b> distortion <b>and</b> eating behavior were evaluated using the <b>Body</b> <b>Image</b> Assesment-Body Dimension (BIAS-BD), and the Eating Attitude Test (EAT) - 26, respectively. Fad diets were assessed using a questionnaire adapted from Hana (10) and Rafiqa (11). The hypotheses were tested using chi-square test and Spearman’s correlations. Results: As many as 105 girls (85. 4 %) showed <b>body</b> <b>image</b> distortion <b>and</b> 15 girls (12. 2 %) were at risks for having disordered eating behavior. Among 51 girls (42. 5 %) who experienced or tried to lose weight, 47 girls (92. 2 %) were practicing fad diets. There was no significant association between <b>body</b> <b>image</b> distortion <b>and</b> disordered eating behavior, nor between <b>body</b> <b>image</b> distortion <b>and</b> fad diets. However, disordered eating behavior was significantly associated with fad diets with OR = 7, 077 (p< 0. 05).

The present study investigates the role of friendship cliques and school gender composition in impacting upon adolescent girls’ <b>body</b> <b>image</b> concern <b>and</b> disordered eating behaviours, using hierarchical linear modelling (HLM), a statistical procedure employed in the analysis of nested data. A sample of 156 girls was drawn from four private schools located in the capital city of Western Australia (one single-sex school and three mixed-sex schools). Eighty students from the single-sex school and 76 female students from the mixed-sex schools, comprising 35 friendship cliques, completed questionnaires assessing <b>body</b> <b>image,</b> disordered eating, <b>and</b> a range of variables that have previously been associated with <b>body</b> <b>image</b> concern <b>and</b> disordered eating, including appearance-based social comparison, frequency of appearance-based conversation, appearance-based criticism, friends’ concern with thinness, media influence and media pressure. Hierarchical linear modelling analyses found that friendship cliques in all-girls schools exhibited similar levels of <b>body</b> <b>image</b> concern <b>and</b> dieting behaviours, with various peer and other media influence variables accounting for these similarities. Friendship cliques in mixed-sex schools were not found to be similar with regard to <b>body</b> <b>image</b> concern or disordered eating. These findings support the notion that friendship groups can be an important source of influence on the <b>body</b> <b>image</b> concerns of adolescent girls in single-sex schools, and show that both individual and friendship clique level measures of attitudes and behaviours make independent contributions to the prediction of these <b>body</b> <b>image</b> concerns...|$|R

40|$|Background: Previous {{research}} has shown that lymphoedema impacts negatively on an individual, including psychological distress <b>and</b> <b>body</b> <b>image</b> disturbance, particularly for younger women. This study identified psychological factors associated with distress in women with breast cancer-related lymphoedema and determined whether age moderated the specific relationship between <b>body</b> <b>image</b> disturbance <b>and</b> distress. Methods: Australian women (n[*]=[*] 166) diagnosed with breast cancer-related lymphoedema were recruited through a community-based breast cancer organisation and lymphoedema treatment clinics. Participants completed an online survey assessing lymphoedema-related cognitions (personal control, perceived treatment effectiveness, and consequences of lymphoedema), perceived ability to self-regulate lymphoedema-related negative affect, <b>body</b> <b>image</b> disturbance, psychological distress (depression, anxiety and stress), and demographic/medical information. Results: Beliefs about the consequences, perceived effectiveness of treatment and controllability of lymphoedema, perceived ability to self-regulate negative affect, <b>body</b> <b>image</b> disturbance, <b>and</b> number of lymphoedema symptoms were correlated with depression, anxiety, and stress scores. Multivariate regression analyses indicated that <b>body</b> <b>image</b> disturbance was significantly associated with depression, anxiety, and stress, and perceived treatment effectiveness was associated with stress. Age was a significant moderator of the relationship between <b>body</b> <b>image</b> disturbance <b>and</b> depression and anxiety, with older women with greater <b>body</b> <b>image</b> disturbance more distressed. Conclusions: Health professionals need to be aware that women diagnosed with lymphoedema are at risk of experiencing psychological distress, particularly arising from <b>body</b> <b>image</b> disturbance <b>and</b> beliefs that treatment cannot control lymphoedema.

40|$|Backgrounds: The {{prevalence}} of disordered eating behaviors {{has been reported}} to increase in recent decades; therefore, scientific studies should perform for specifying psychological variables that may contribute to the etiology of this disorder. In this study, we examined the role of <b>body</b> <b>image</b> disturbance <b>and</b> perfectionism variables in predicting disordered eating behaviors among female students. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed in 2014 upon a sample consisting of 464 female students in Allame Tabatabaie University were selected based on a Morgan formula and multi-stage cluster random sampling. Then, participants responded to the questionnaires of <b>body</b> <b>image</b> disturbance of Reas and et al. (2002), perfectionism scale of Besharat (2004) and eating attitudes test of Garner and Garfinkel (1979). The data were analyzed by correlation techniques and stepwise regression. Results: The results showed that these were internal correlation among <b>body</b> <b>image</b> disturbance <b>and</b> perfectionism and disordered eating behavior. Also, the results of stepwise regression analysis revealed that <b>body</b> <b>image</b> disturbance <b>and</b> perfectionism significantly predicted, respectively, almost 16 % and 14 % of variances of disordered eating behaviors among female students.
