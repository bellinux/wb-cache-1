5|$|In 1981, Yamaha {{introduced}} a new square-four cylinder bike, similar to Suzuki's RG500. Roberts raced to a second-place finish behind Marco Luchinelli at the non-championship Imola 200 race. Roberts' bike had a suspension failure in the Grand Prix season opener at Austria, but he rebounded to win the next two races in Germany and Italy. Roberts' title hopes suffered a setback at the Dutch TT at Assen when his Yamaha's front brake pads were installed incorrectly causing his front wheel to lock up on the starting line, ending his race before it had started. He came back to score a second place behind Lucchinelli in Belgium, but was once again struck by misfortune when a <b>bad</b> <b>case</b> of food poisoning forced him to miss the San Marino Grand Prix. He then narrowly lost the British Grand Prix to Jack Middelburg by three-tenths of a second before ending his season with a seventh place in Finland and a retirement in Sweden. Suzuki team riders Mamola and Lucchinelli battled to the final race of the season before the Italian claimed the championship {{with a total of}} five Grand Prix victories, with Mamola finishing in second and Roberts in third place.|$|E

500|$|Cushing {{stood for}} {{election}} as lieutenant {{governor in the}} 1780 election. [...] The vote was indecisive (no candidate received {{a majority of the}} votes cast), and the choice was given to the General Court to decide. [...] Its first candidate, James Bowdoin, refused the post, as did the second choice, James Warren, and the choice went to Cushing on the third ballot. [...] He then served in the post, most of the time serving under his friend John Hancock, until his death in 1788. [...] In early 1785 Hancock offered his resignation to the legislature, partly as a political maneuver (although he claimed to be suffering a particularly <b>bad</b> <b>case</b> of gout at the time). [...] The legislature did not insist that Hancock remain in office, resulting in Hancock actually resigning. [...] Cushing became Acting Governor and served out the last few months of the term. [...] The 1785 election for governor was highly political and divisive; Cushing was portrayed by his opponents (principally Bowdoin and his supporters) {{as little more than a}} creature of Hancock who would do Hancock's bidding. [...] The election was again undecided by the electorate; Bowdoin prevailed in the General Court's decision-making, and Cushing again won the lieutenant governor's office. [...] Bowdoin served two terms, which were dominated by Shays' Rebellion, an uprising caused in part by Bowdoin's harsh fiscal policies and poor economic conditions in the rural parts of the state. [...] In 1787 Hancock returned to politics, trouncing Bowdoin. [...] In each of these elections Cushing was reelected as lieutenant governor.|$|E

500|$|Although he {{may have}} been {{expected}} to retire following the controversy and in view of his age, Mold continued to play for Lancashire, who were short of quality bowlers, {{at the start of the}} 1901 season. At least one umpire was asked by the MCC to report specifically on Mold's bowling, but decided it was fair, and no umpire initially called him for throwing. He missed two Lancashire matches in which Phillips was an umpire, wishing to avoid a confrontation, but Lancashire were criticised by the public for omitting Mold from these matches. Consequently, he played in the game against Somerset umpired by Phillips, which started on 11 July at Old Trafford Cricket Ground. Under the captaincy of MacLaren, Mold opened the attack and bowled with Phillips at square leg. In Mold's second over of the game, Phillips no-balled him for throwing. Acting at the request of the Lancashire committee, MacLaren then switched Mold to bowl from the opposite end so that Phillips would be at the bowler's end. Even so, Phillips continued to no-ball him, and after 10 overs, Mold had been called 16 times by Phillips. MacLaren removed Mold from the attack, although he returned to bowl later without further action from either umpire. For the remainder of the match, Mold bowled from Phillips' end without censure; Phillips believed he had made his point. The other umpire took no action at any point in the match. The crowd at the game protested noisily against Phillips, for a time shouting [...] "no-ball" [...] as every ball was bowled, and making comments about him. According to Wisden, Phillips' actions caused [...] "a great sensation... The incident naturally gave rise to much excitement, and for the next few days nothing else was talked about in the cricket world." [...] At the conclusion of the match, Mitchell and Kenyon, a film-making company based in Blackburn, filmed the players leaving the field and took footage of Mold bowling in the nets. Phillips received criticism for his actions and Mold had some support in the press. Mold's Times obituary noted: [...] "Mold did not lack defenders, but those who argued that he was, and always had been, a perfectly fair bowler, had a very <b>bad</b> <b>case.</b> The weight of expert evidence was overwhelmingly against them." ...|$|E

The curious thing is that on many, if not most of the points, Austria has a good and Serbia a very <b>bad</b> <b>case.</b> But the Austrians are quite the stupidest people in Europe (as the Italians are the most perfidious), and there is a brutality about their mode of procedure, which will make most people think that is a case of a big Power wantonly bullying a little one.

5000|$|Polyradiculoneuritis is {{inflammation}} of the nerve roots. The most common type is Coonhound paralysis. This is similar to Guillain-Barré syndrome in humans. Coonhound paralysis seems to be secondary to a raccoon bite, probably due to some factor in the saliva. However, it can also occur without any interaction with a raccoon. It can happen in any breed of dog. When associated with a raccoon bite, the symptoms start 7 to 11 days after the bite, and include rear leg weakness progressing rapidly to paresis, and decreased reflexes. When not associated with a raccoon bite, the same symptoms occur, with the paresis taking about 3-4 days to reach its maximum effect. Severe cases have a loss of bark, trouble breathing, and an inability to lift the head. Typically, {{the duration of the}} paralysis is 2 to 3 months, but can last up to 6 months. Treatment is proper nursing care, and the prognosis is good in mild <b>cases.</b> In <b>bad</b> <b>cases,</b> the dog does not completely recover the initial muscular capability but still is able to live for years. In very <b>bad</b> <b>cases,</b> breathing can be impaired, and unless the dog is placed on a ventilator, suffocation will occur. Polyradiculoneuritis has also been seen 1-2o weeks after vaccination in dogs and cats. [...] It can also be caused by toxoplasmosis.|$|R
