5|$|In Lillesand, the {{right-of-way}} has <b>been</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> a road {{around the}} city center, although parts have <b>been</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> a pedestrian path. Other parts have been reverted to agricultural land. From Storemyr, the route went through a forest, and has become an overgrown forestry road. From Eikeland to Tveite, the line has <b>been</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> a hiking trail. At Birkleland, there are few remains of the line, although when leaving the village, part of the line {{is used as a}} pathway. Further along, the route is disused, but fenced in. The station buildings at Tveite and Flaksvand have been kept, the building at Lillesand has been preserved, while the station at Birkeland was dismounted because it was {{in the way of a}} new road.|$|E

5|$|First, Second and Third Creeks {{have been}} {{particularly}} heavily modified. Some sections have <b>been</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> concrete channels; others run through landscaped private gardens and some run in underground pipes. Much of the original vegetation has disappeared from the creeks, particularly those closest to the city. Introduced species including Olives, bamboo, boxthorn, watsonia and blackberries have displaced native flora.|$|E
50|$|GAs {{are usually}} {{produced}} from the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway in higher plants. In this pathway, bioactive GA is produced from trans-geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGDP). In the MEP pathway, three classes of enzymes {{are used to}} yield GA from GGDP: 1) terpene synthases (TPSs), 2) cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s), and 3) 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (2ODDs). There are 8 steps in the methylerythritol phosphate pathway: - 1) GGDP <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> ent-copalyl diphosphate (ent-CPD) by ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase - 2) etn-CDP <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> ent-kaurene by ent-kaurene synthase - 3) ent-kaurene <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> ent-kaurenol by ent-kaurene oxidase (KO) - 4) ent-kaurenol <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> ent-kaurenal by KO - 5) ent-kaurenal <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> ent-kaurenoic acid by KO - 6) ent-kaurenoic acid <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> ent-7a-hydroxykaurenoic acid by ent-kaurene acid oxidase (KAO) - 7) ent-7a-hydroxykaurenoic acid <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> GA12-aldehyde by KAO- 8) GA12-aldehyde <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> GA12 by KAO. GA12 is processed to the bioactive GA4 by oxidations on C-20 and C-3, which is accomplished by 2 soluble ODDs: GA 20-oxidase and GA 3-oxidase.|$|R

5|$|In 1993, The Schools at Somerhill {{moved to}} Somerhill House, having {{previously}} been at Tunbridge Wells. The Schools at Somerhill comprise three schools in one location. Somerhill Pre-Prep is {{for boys and}} girls aged 3 – 6. Derwent Lodge is for girls aged 6 – 11 and Yardley Court is for boys aged 6 – 13. In 1998, the attic rooms were converted to provide classrooms and art room. A former granary has also <b>been</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> classrooms, whilst some stables have <b>been</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> workshops. Also in that year, a bridge over the lake in the grounds of Somerhill was added to the Buildings at Risk Register by Tunbridge Wells Borough Council, in whose area Somerhill falls. In 2000, the central span between the old stable courtyard and the stable courtyard was reinstated at a cost of £720,000 to provide accommodation for Somerhill Pre-Prep School and administrative offices. Also in that year, planning permission was granted for the building of a sports hall on the top sports terrace.|$|E
5|$|Many {{people put}} up bat houses to attract bats. The 1991 University of Florida bat {{house is the}} largest {{occupied}} artificial roost in the world, with around 300,000 residents. In Britain, thickwalled and partly underground World War II pillboxes have <b>been</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> make roosts for bats, and purpose-built bat houses are occasionally built to mitigate damage to habitat from road or other developments.|$|E

5|$|The North East line {{originated}} from a suburban line to Essendon in 1860, being extended to Wodonga by 1873, connecting with the New South Wales Government Railways at Albury at a break-of-gauge in 1883.

The broad gauge track has <b>been</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> standard gauge between Seymour and Albury.|$|E
5|$|The cost of Nevada Solar One is in {{the range}} of $220–250million. The power {{produced}} is slightly more expensive than wind power, but was less than photovoltaic (PV) power.

5|$|The only track {{left after}} the {{demolishing}} {{was a short}} section at Lier Station, which remained until the station closed in 1973. The old Lier Station has been preserved. The section between Reenskaug, located a few hundred meters (yards) from Lier Station, to Landfald has become the suburban street Lijevegen. From Landfall to Egge, the right-of-way is an overgrown path. From Egge to Muggerud, the right-of-way is used as the street Banevegen. In 1993, the right-of-way from Muggerud to Rønningen was rebuilt as a hiking and riding path. The branch towards Tronstad Bruk has <b>been</b> <b>converted</b> <b>to</b> a street, {{although most of the}} right-of-way north of Rønning has disappeared, as it has been reclaimed as agricultural land, particularly north of Sylling.
