500|$|The {{armoured}} recovery vehicle, {{known as}} the AMX-30D (AMX-30 Dépanneur-Niveleur), was designed to recuperate or help maintain vehicles in the field. Work on the AMX-30D began in 1966, as the French Army researched developing a recovery vehicle to be issued to units receiving the AMX-30 tank. A prototype was produced and delivered for experimentation in 1971, and in February 1973 {{the first of a}} pre-series of five vehicles was delivered. That same year, another 100 AMX-30Ds were ordered, and these began production in 1975.

The vehicle also has a [...] heavy towing cable, while an auxiliary winch has another [...] towing cable, able to tow up to [...] when working over the front of the AMX-30D.

2500|$|Prior to {{the launch}} of Operation Cobra (an American {{offensive}} during the Normandy campaign), solutions were developed for how tanks could effectively support the offensive within this terrain. Bulldozers or tanks modified to carry a <b>bulldozer</b> <b>blade</b> were used to open gaps in hedgerows. Some hedgerows were so thick that engineers first had to blow {{a hole in the}} bank, which a bulldozer would later clear and widen. This time-consuming process slowed down the progress of the Allied offensive. Throughout July [...] "innumerable" [...] inventions were created by various American units to get tanks through the hedges quickly without exposing their weak underside armor. A hedgecutter developed by the 79th Infantry Division was in operation by 5 July, and a few days later, XIX Corps demonstrated a set of prongs that had been initially developed to create holes for the placement of explosives. These prongs were able to lift and remove a portion of the vegetation, enough so that the tank would be able to crash through to the other side. Units within V Corps also invented devices, which were dubbed 'brush cutters' and 'greendozers'.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (PhD (Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2004. Granular flow {{occurs in}} a broad {{spectrum}} of industrial applications that range from separation and mixing in the pharmaceutical industry, to grinding and crushing, blasting, stockpile construction, flow in and from hoppers, silos, bins, and conveyer belts, agriculture, mining and earthmoving. Two totally different approaches of modelling granular flow are the Discrete Element Method (DEM) and continuum methods such as Finite Element Methods (FEM). Continuum methods can be divided into nonpolar or classic continuum methods and polar continuum methods. Large displacements are usually present during granular flow which, without remeshing, cannot be solved with standard finite element methods due to severe mesh distortion. The Particle-in-Cell (PIC) method, which is a so-called meshless method, eliminates this problem since all the state variables are traced by material points moving through a fixed mesh. The main goal of this research was to model the flow of noncohesive granular material in front of flat <b>bulldozer</b> <b>blades</b> and into excavator buckets using a continuum method. A PIC code was developed to model these processes under plane strain conditions. A contact model was used to model Coulomb friction between the material and the bucket/blade. Analytical solutions, published numerical and experimental results were used to validate the contact model and to demonstrate the code’s ability to model large displacements and deformations. The ability of both DEM and PIC to predict the forces acting on the blade and bucket and the material flow patterns were demonstrated. Shear bands that develop during the flow of material were investigated. As part of the PIC analyses, a comparison between classic continuum and polar continuum (Cosserat) results were made. This includes mesh size and orientation dependency, flow patterns and the forces acting on the blade and the bucket. It is concluded that the interaction of buckets and blades with granular materials can successfully be modelled with PIC. In the cases conducted here, the nonpolar continuum was more accurate than the polar continuum, but the polar continuum results were less dependent on the mesh size. The next step would be to apply this technology to solve industrial problems...|$|R
