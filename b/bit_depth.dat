5|$|Both HDMI and DVI use TMDS to send 10-bit {{characters}} that are encoded using 8b/10b encoding that {{differs from the}} original IBM form for the Video Data Period and 2b/10b encoding for the Control Period. HDMI adds the ability to send audio and auxiliary data using 4b/10b encoding for the Data Island Period. Each Data Island Period is 32 pixels in size and contains a 32-bit Packet Header, which includes 8 bits of BCH ECC parity data for error correction and describes {{the contents of the}} packet. Each packet contains four subpackets, and each subpacket is 64 bits in size, including 8 bits of BCH ECC parity data, allowing for each packet to carry up to 224 bits of audio data. Each Data Island Period can contain up to 18 packets. Seven of the 15 packet types described in the HDMI 1.3a specifications deal with audio data, while the other 8 types deal with auxiliary data. Among these are the General Control Packet and the Gamut Metadata Packet. The General Control Packet carries information on AVMUTE (which mutes the audio during changes that may cause audio noise) and Color Depth (which sends the <b>bit</b> <b>depth</b> of the current video stream and is required for deep color). The Gamut Metadata Packet carries information on the color space being used for the current video stream and is required for xvYCC.|$|E
25|$|IHDR must be {{the first}} chunk; it {{contains}} (in this order) the image's width, height, <b>bit</b> <b>depth,</b> color type, compression method, filter method, and interlace method (13 data bytes total).|$|E
25|$|Fixed <b>bit</b> <b>depth</b> (also called color depth). Many cheaper LCDs {{are only}} able to display 262,000 colors. 8-bit S-IPS panels can display 16million colors and have {{significantly}} better black level, but are expensive and have slower response time.|$|E
50|$|Profiles {{supporting}} <b>bit</b> <b>depths</b> beyond 10 <b>bits</b> per sample. Profiles {{that support}} {{a range of}} <b>bit</b> <b>depths</b> can use different <b>bit</b> <b>depths</b> for luma and chroma with YCbCr color spaces.|$|R
5000|$|JPEG {{supports}} <b>bit</b> <b>depths</b> of 8 and 12 bits; JPEG XR supports <b>bit</b> <b>depths</b> {{of up to}} 32 bits. JPEG XR {{also supports}} lossless and lossy compression of floating-point image data (by representing the floating-point values in an IEEE 754-like format, and encoding them {{as though they were}} integers) and RGBE imagery.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{definition of}} the PGM and the PPM binary formats (the P5 and P6 formats) did not allow <b>bit</b> <b>depths</b> greater than 8 bits. One can of course use the ASCII format, but this format both slows down reading and makes the files much larger. Accordingly, many programmers extended the format to allow higher <b>bit</b> <b>depths.</b> Using higher <b>bit</b> <b>depths</b> encounters the problem of having {{to decide on the}} endianness of the file. The various implementations could not agree on which byte order to use, and some connected the 16-bit endianness to the pixel packing order. In Netpbm, the de facto standard implementation of the PNM formats, the most significant byte is first.|$|R
25|$|The Generic Graphics Library (GEGL) {{was first}} {{introduced}} as part of GIMP on the 2.6 release of GIMP. This initial introduction does not yet exploit all of the capabilities of GEGL; as of the 2.6 release, GIMP can use GEGL to perform high bit-depth color operations; because of this less information is lost when performing color operations. When GEGL is fully integrated, GIMP will have a higher color <b>bit</b> <b>depth</b> and better non-destructive work-flow. Current distribution versions of GIMP only support 8-bit of color, which is much less than what e.g. digital cameras produce (12-bit or more). Full support for high <b>bit</b> <b>depth</b> is included with actual Gimp 2.9 Development version. For accelerations OpenCL is available for some operations.|$|E
25|$|The {{higher level}} APIs {{such as the}} Waveform-Audio Interface (waveXxx functions) and DirectSound use shared mode, which results in {{pre-mixed}} PCM audio that {{is sent to the}} driver in a single format (in terms of sample rate, <b>bit</b> <b>depth</b> and channel count). This format is configurable by the end user through Control Panel.|$|E
25|$|CD-DA, the {{standard}} audio CD, {{is said to}} have a data rate of 44.1kHz/16, meaning that the audio data was sampled 44,100 times per second and with a <b>bit</b> <b>depth</b> of 16. CD-DA is also stereo, using a left and right channel, so the amount of audio data per second is double that of mono, where only a single channel is used.|$|E

5000|$|Color: 16-bit RGB (16-bit {{color space}} using 5 <b>bits</b> <b>depth</b> per channel), capable of {{displaying}} 512 simultaneous colors in [...] "character mode" [...] and 32,768 (215) simultaneous colors in [...] "bitmap mode".|$|R
25|$|The {{standard}} allows indexed color PNGs to have 1, 2, 4 or 8 bits per pixel; grayscale {{images with}} no alpha channel may have 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16 bits per pixel. Everything else uses a <b>bit</b> <b>depth</b> per channel of either 8 or 16. The combinations this allows {{are given in}} the table above. The standard requires that decoders can read all supported color formats, but many image editors can only produce a small subset of them.|$|E
25|$|Compression {{efficiency}} of encoders is typically {{defined by the}} bit rate, because compression ratio depends on the <b>bit</b> <b>depth</b> and sampling rate of the input signal. Nevertheless, compression ratios are often published. They may use the Compact Disc (CD) parameters as references (44.1 kHz, 2 channels at 16 bits per channel or 2×16 bit), or sometimes the Digital Audio Tape (DAT) SP parameters (48kHz, 2×16 bit). Compression ratios with this latter reference are higher, which demonstrates the problem with {{use of the term}} compression ratio for lossy encoders.|$|E
25|$|Early web browsers did {{not support}} PNG images; JPEG and GIF were the main image formats. JPEG was {{commonly}} used when exporting images containing gradients for web pages, because of GIF's limited color depth. However, JPEG compression causes a gradient to blur slightly. A PNG format reproduces a gradient as accurately as possible for a given <b>bit</b> <b>depth,</b> while keeping the file size small. PNG became the optimal choice for small gradient images as web browser support for the format improved. No images at all are needed to display gradients in modern browsers, as gradients can be created using CSS.|$|E
50|$|CinePaint is an {{open source}} {{computer}} program for painting and retouching bitmap frames of films. It is a fork of version 1.0.4 of the GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP). It enjoyed some success {{as one of the}} earliest open source tools developed for feature motion picture visual effects and animation work. The main reason for this adoption over mainline gimp was its support for high <b>bit</b> <b>depths</b> (greater than 8-bits per channel) which can be required for film work. The mainline GIMP project later added high <b>bit</b> <b>depths</b> in GIMP 2.9.2, released November 2015. It is free software under the GNU General Public License.|$|R
50|$|HEVC {{already has}} several {{profiles}} defined for still-picture coding using HEVC's intra-frame encoding for various <b>bit</b> <b>depths</b> and color formats, including the progressively more capable Main Still Picture, Main 4:4:4 Still Picture, and Main 4:4:4 16 Still Picture profiles.|$|R
50|$|The Color Cell Compression {{algorithm}} processes {{an image}} in 8 steps, although {{one of the}} steps (step #6) is optional. It is assumed here that the input is a 24 bits/pixel image, as assumed in the original journal article, although other <b>bit</b> <b>depths</b> could be used.|$|R
2500|$|A: [...] F7 [...] - GCT follows for 256 {{colors with}} {{resolution}} 3 x 8 bits/primary; the lowest 3 bits represent the <b>bit</b> <b>depth</b> minus 1, the highest true bit {{means that the}} GCT is present ...|$|E
2500|$|This is the decompressed subimage. In general, the {{decompression}} {{process may}} produce values outside the original input range of [...] If this occurs, the decoder needs to clip the output values keep them within that range to prevent overflow when storing the decompressed image {{with the original}} <b>bit</b> <b>depth.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{permitted}} formats encode each {{number as}} an unsigned integral value using a fixed number of bits, {{referred to in}} the PNG specification as the <b>bit</b> <b>depth.</b> [...] Notice {{that this is not the}} same as color depth, which is commonly used to refer to the total number of bits in each pixel, not each channel. [...] The permitted bit depths are summarized in the table along with the total number of bits used for each pixel.|$|E
50|$|Cubes may be {{of various}} sizes and <b>bit</b> <b>depths.</b> Often 17×17×17 cubes are used as 3D LUTs. The most common {{practice}} is to use RGB 10-bit/component log images as the input to the 3D LUT. Output is usually RGB values {{that are to be}} placed unchanged into a display device's buffer.|$|R
50|$|While 30 = (3 × 10) {{could fit}} into 32 bits, {{this is not}} {{supported}} by the binary PNM and PAM formats. All PPM <b>bit</b> <b>depths</b> with more than 8 bits are encoded in 48 bits. More than 8 gray bits end up as 16 bits without transparency (FFmpeg PGM or PAM pix_fmt gray16be).|$|R
30|$|As the box-based {{approach}} {{was identified as}} future-proof, a method was developed to add boxes {{not only to the}} newer standards in the JPEG family but also to the JPEG- 1 standard, for example to allow for extensions for High Dynamic Range (HDR), extended <b>bit</b> <b>depths,</b> privacy and security features, universal metadata or 360 ° images.|$|R
2500|$|OptiPNG was {{inspired}} by pngcrush, but iterates over {{a wider range of}} compression parameters and performs trials in-memory for faster execution. The main purpose of OptiPNG is {{to reduce the size of}} the PNG IDAT data stream by trying various filtering and compression methods. It also performs automatic <b>bit</b> <b>depth,</b> color type and color palette reduction where possible, and can correct some data integrity errors in input files. (pngcrush has the ability to do color reduction in a later version.) ...|$|E
2500|$|With indexed color images, {{the palette}} always stores {{trichromatic}} colors {{at a depth}} of 8 bits per channel (24 bits per palette entry). Additionally, an optional list of 8-bit alpha values for the palette entries may be included; if not included, or if shorter than the palette, the remaining palette entries are assumed to be opaque. The palette must not have more entries than the image <b>bit</b> <b>depth</b> allows for, but it may have fewer (for example, if an image with 8-bit pixels only uses 90 colors then it does not need palette entries for all 256 colors). [...] The palette must contain entries for all the pixel values present in the image.|$|E
2500|$|Windows Media Audio Professional (WMA Pro) is an {{improved}} lossy codec {{closely related to}} WMA standard. [...] It retains most of the same general coding features, but also features improved entropy coding and quantization strategies {{as well as more}} efficient stereo coding. [...] Notably, many of the WMA standard's low bitrate features have been removed, as the core codec is designed for efficient coding at most bitrates. [...] Its main competitors include AAC, HE-AAC, Vorbis, Dolby Digital, and DTS. It supports 16-bit and 24-bit sample <b>bit</b> <b>depth,</b> sampling rates up to 96kHz and up to eight discrete channels (7.1 channel surround). WMA Pro also supports dynamic range compression, which reduces the volume difference between the loudest and quietest sounds in the audio track. According to Microsoft's Amir Majidimehr, WMA Pro can technically go beyond 7.1 surround sound and support [...] "an unlimited number of channels." ...|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} and incompatible protocols for audio over Ethernet. For example, using category 5 cable and 100BASE-TX signaling at 100 Mbits/second, each link can generally transmit between 32 and 64 channels at a 48 kHz sampling rate. Some can handle other rates and audio <b>bit</b> <b>depths,</b> with a corresponding reduction {{in number of}} channels.|$|R
50|$|Consumer soundcards {{are also}} limited in the {{effective}} sampling rates and <b>bit</b> <b>depths</b> {{they can actually}} manage (compare analog versus digital sound) and have lower numbers of less flexible input channels: professional studio recording use typically requires more than the two channels that consumer soundcards provide, and more accessible connectors, unlike the variable mixture of internal—and sometimes virtual—and external connectors found in consumer-grade soundcards.|$|R

5000|$|A scaled {{version of}} the transformation, {{sometimes}} called YCoCg-R (where the [...] "-R" [...] refers to reversibility), can be implemented efficiently with a reduced <b>bit</b> <b>depth.</b> The scaled version uses a lifting scheme to make it exactly invertible while minimizing the <b>bit</b> <b>depth</b> of the three color components.
