However, such a desirability bias should not occur in the absence of prior dispositions toward those outcomes. This assumption is tested in an experiment designed to track the evaluation of information during an emerging evaluation of risk. Results confirm the presence of a substantial desirability bias even when there is no prior disposition toward any outcome.

Each Gaussian blob was seen only by the amblyopic eye.

40|$|Meta-analyses are {{increasingly}} used for synthesis of evidence from biomedical research, and often include {{an assessment of}} publication bias based on visual or analytical detection of asymmetry in funnel plots. We studied the influence of different normalisation approaches, sample size and intervention effects on funnel plot asymmetry, using empirical datasets and illustrative simulations. We found that funnel plots of the Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) plotted against the standard error (SE) are susceptible to distortion, leading to overestimation of the existence and extent of publication <b>bias.</b> <b>Distortion</b> was more severe when the primary studies had a small sample size and when an intervention effect was present. We show that using the Normalised Mean Difference measure as effect size (when possible), or plotting the SMD against a sample size-based precision estimate, are more reliable alternatives.

From the mid-eighties Phillips (1987 a, 1987 b), through his fundamental papers, opened the path of asymptotic (large-sample) theory for the unit root type non-stationary models. This has certainly created a large literature of important papers, including many of Phillipsown papers. However, not much is known about the analytical 8 ̆ 5 nite-sample properties of estimators under the unit root, although see Kiviet and Phillips (2005) for the case when the errors are normally distributed.

40|$|Acoustic {{feedback}} {{is a well-known}} phenomenon in hearing aids and public address systems. Under certain conditions it causes the so-called howling effect, which is highly annoying for the hearing aid user and limits the maximum amplification of the hearing aid. The most common choice to prevent howling is the adaptive feedback cancellation algorithm, which is able to completely eliminate the feedback signal. However, standard adaptive feedback cancellation algorithms suffer from a biased adaptation if the input signal is spectrally colored, {{as it is for}} speech and music signals. Due to this <b>bias</b> <b>distortion</b> artifacts (entrainment) are generated and consequently, the sound quality is significantly reduced. Most of the known methods to reduce the bias have focused on speech signals. However, those methods do not cope with music, since the tonality and correlation are much stronger for such signals. This leads to a higher bias and consequently, to stronger entrainment for music than for speech. Other methods, which deal with music signals, work only satisfactorily when using a very slow adaptation speed. This reduces the ability to react fast to feedback path changes. Hence, howling occurs for a longer time when the feedback path is changing. In this thesis, a new sub-band adaptive feedback cancellation system for hearing aid applications is proposed. It combines decorrelation methods with a new realization of a non-parametric variable step size. The adaptation is realized in sub-bands which decreases the computational complexity and increases the adaptation performance of the system simultaneously. The applied decorrelation methods, prediction error filter and frequency shift, are well known approaches to reduce the bias. However, the combination of both is first proposed in this thesis. To apply the proposed step size in the context of adaptive feedback cancellation, a method to estimate the signal power of the desired input signal, i. e., without feedback, also referred to as source signal power is necessary. This estimate is theoretically derived and it is demonstrated that it is a reliabe estimate if the decorrelation methods are additionally applied. In order to further improve the performance of the system three additional control methods are derived: The first one is an impulse detection to detect wideband impulses, which could lead to misadaptation. Secondly, a modified estimate of the source signal power to stabilize the system in case of jarring voices is proposed. Lastly, a correlation detection, which is applied to improve the trade-off between adaptation stability and tracking behavior, is developed. The complete system is optimized and evaluated for several speech and music signals as well as for different feedback scenarios in simulations with feedback paths measured under realistic situations. Additionally, the system is tested by real-time simulations with hearing aid dummies and a torso and head simulator. For both simulation setups hearing loss compensation methods as applied in realistic hearing aids are used. The performance is measured in terms of being able to prevent entrainment (adaptation stability) and reacting to feedback path changes (tracking behavior). The complete adaptive feedback cancellation system shows an excellent performance. Furthermore, the system relies only on few parameters, shows a low computational complexity, and therefore has a strong practical relevance...|$|E

We find that the galaxy correlation function shows an excess close to the maximum of the BAO peak (r∼ 110 Mpc/h) and a deficit at r∼ 90 Mpc/h.

40|$|In the block-based {{image coding}} systems, the pixels at the block {{boundaries}} usually have larger distortions than the pixels at other positions. This <b>biased</b> <b>distortion</b> distribution not only generates unpleasant blocking artifact, but potentially decreases the intra-prediction performance and eventually diminishes the coding efficiency. Motivated by this observation, a novel distortion redistribution approach is proposed {{in this paper}} which aims to achieve the best rate-distortion performance. Our contributions are summarized in the following aspects: First, the inter-block dependency model (IBDM) is introduced as a quantitative measure of the inter-block dependency. Then, based on the proposed IBDM, the distortion redistribution problem is formulated as a rate minimization problem under a certain distortion constraint. In the end, successive convex optimization method is employed to tackle the optimization problem, and the final optimal distortion can be achieved efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that compared with the original distortion distribution, significant gain can be obtained with the proposed approach...|$|R
