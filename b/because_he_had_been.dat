5|$|In August 2007, a U.S. {{federal judge}} {{approved}} the French government's request to extradite Noriega to France after his release. Noriega appealed his extradition because he claimed France would not honor his legal {{status as a}} prisoner of war. In 1999, the Panamanian government sought the extradition of Noriega to face murder charges in Panama <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> found guilty in absentia in 1995 and sentenced to 20 years in prison.|$|E
5|$|Keltset Mallicos, Panamon's mute companion. He is mute as {{a result}} of the Warlock Lord. He was able to save Panamon and Shea after they were {{captured}} by Trolls <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> awarded the Black Irix, the highest honor any Troll can receive, and therefore is considered incapable of treachery. The Trolls then helped them get to Skull Mountain so that Shea could confront the Warlock Lord.|$|E
5|$|On 28 December 2009, Dhondup Wangchen {{was sentenced}} to six year's {{imprisonment}} for subversion, following a secret trial in Xining. On 7 January 2010, Filming for Tibet {{reported that he had}} been unable to appeal his sentence <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> denied access to his lawyer until his right to appeal expired.|$|E

5|$|Thanks to bonus seconds, Nordhaug led {{the race}} by four seconds ahead of Voeckler. He also led the points classification. The {{mountains}} classification {{was led by}} Quéméneur. Quéméneur was also awarded the combativity prize after the online vote: Dunbar won the vote, {{but was unable to}} receive the prize <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> hospitalised due to his crash.|$|E
5|$|After the Japanese {{occupied}} the Dutch East Indies in 1942, Soeman {{was made a}} school supervisor by occupying forces. He soon became involved in politics, being elected to the Shūsangikai, a Japanese-sponsored regional representatives' council, for Riau. He later recalled that, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> elected rather than selected by the Japanese forces—and thus had strong backing among the community, {{which could be used}} for revolution—he had felt as though he was under constant surveillance. This situation continued until after the Japanese withdrew from Indonesia and Sukarno proclaimed an independent Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|At Dunder Mifflin, Charles Miner (Idris Elba) {{announces that}} the Scranton branch, {{previously}} the company's most profitable office, has lost ten major clients to Michael's company. Chief Financial Officer David Wallace (Andy Buckley) visits Scranton {{to see what}} can be done to stem the losses. In a blatant about-face from his no-nonsense persona, Charles blatantly sucks up to David, which Jim notices. David calls a meeting with Charles and Jim (John Krasinski), but Charles insists Dwight (Rainn Wilson) also be present <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> Charles's right-hand man. However, during the meeting Dwight embarrasses Charles with outlandish suggestions, such as unleashing a hive of bees.|$|E

5|$|Ottman {{said the}} {{challenge}} on Valkyrie {{was to create}} tension from dialogue scenes, and he often reshaped scenes to do this: moments rather than whole scenes were cut from the film. Being historically accurate meant Ottman was more restricted in reorganizing scenes, but {{he was able to}} choose what lines and close-ups he could focus on. Ottman said the scene he was most saddened to delete was a scene where von Stauffenberg dances with his wife <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> looking forward to scoring it.|$|E
5|$|Wulfhelm {{also went}} to Rome to receive his pallium in person from Pope John X. Why he chose to go to Rome in person for his pallium rather than having it sent to him like most of his {{predecessors}} is unknown. One suggestion has been that <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> translated from another see, Wulfhelm {{felt the need to}} have papal approval of his translation made explicit. Given the low status of the papacy at the time, {{it is unlikely that the}} impetus for the change in tradition came from the pope.|$|E
5|$|Edward had {{a normal}} {{upbringing}} for {{a member of}} a royal family. The prince was interested in horses and horsebreeding, and became a good rider; he also liked dogs, in particular greyhounds. In his letters, he shows a quirky sense of humour, joking about sending unsatisfactory animals to his friends, such as horses who disliked carrying their riders, or lazy hunting dogs too slow to catch rabbits. He was not particularly interested in hunting or falconry, both popular activities in the 14th century. He enjoyed music, including Welsh music and the newly invented crwth instrument, as well as musical organs. He did not take part in jousting, either because he lacked the aptitude or <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> banned from participating for his personal safety, but he was certainly supportive of the sport.|$|E

5|$|Henry became King of England {{following}} the death of William Rufus, who had been shot while hunting. On the afternoon of 2 August 1100, the King had gone hunting in the New Forest, accompanied by a team of huntsmen and a number of the Norman nobility, including Henry. An arrow was fired, possibly by the baron Walter Tirel, which hit and killed William Rufus. Numerous conspiracy theories have been put forward suggesting that the King was killed deliberately; most modern historians reject these, as hunting was a risky activity, and such accidents were common. Chaos broke out, and Tirel fled the scene for France, either because he had fired the fatal shot, or <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> incorrectly accused and feared that he would be made a scapegoat for the King's death.|$|E
5|$|Sellers's {{career on}} radio, film, {{television}} and record spanned from 1948 until his death. He made his radio debut on ShowTime in 1948, followed by appearances in Ray's a Laugh, Starlight Hour, The Gang Show, Henry Hall's Guest Night and It's Fine To Be Young. Along with Spike Milligan, Harry Secombe and Michael Bentine, he {{took part in}} the radio series The Goon Show (1951–60). Throughout his career, Sellers made a number of television appearances, in character roles and for interviews and advertisements. His stage appearances were few, largely <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> unhappy with the touring he had done as a child with his family. During his career he also released a number of albums containing sketches and comic songs; the songs were undertaken in a variety of comic characters.|$|E
5|$|Verdugo, {{having been}} {{forced by the}} Union of Arras – formed by the Dutch provinces loyal to Spanish King Philip II, who wanted the foreign troops out the Netherlands – to hand over his {{regiment}} to his brother-in-law Charles von Mansfeld, recruited a regiment of 2,000 Walloon arquebusiers {{and made his way}} to Friesland. While mustering his infantry in the village of Kerpen, Verdugo learned that the Dutch rebels were leving a company of German reiters – a type of armoured cavalry armed with pistols – in Cologne under a rittmeister called Adam von Langen. As he lacked cavalry or pikemen and it was reported by Spanish agents that von Langen was angry <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> paid by the Dutch with false coins, Verdugo managed to convince the rittmeister to escort his arquebusiers to Groningen. Passing through Bredevoort and Coevorden, Verdugo and his regiment reached Groningen. There, Verdugo was met with a mutiny, which he ended by distributing 40,000 escudos amongst the mutineers, disbanding an undisciplined German regiment and giving license to two companies of men-at-arms to join Farnese's army in Hainault. With the loyal troops, meanwhile, he took two Dutch forts, one {{at the mouth of the}} Emden and another near Groningen.|$|E

25|$|Nor was Lyell's {{eventual}} {{conversion to}} evolution a strictly empirical affair. When he finally took this step publicly, in 1868, {{it was not}} <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> persuaded by Darwin's theory of natural selection. In fact, Lyell rejected that theory, accepting only a general evolutionary process without its celebrated Darwinian mechanism.|$|E
25|$|After {{completing}} his studies in Munich in 1849, Höckert returned to Sweden in 1850. During {{the summer of}} that year, he traveled extensively throughout Lapland in the northern parts of Sweden.
