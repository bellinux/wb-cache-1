50|$|The PCD {{project was}} {{designed}} and implemented by Hai Shalom, senior software engineer at Texas Instruments Israel at the time, {{as part of his}} M.Sc. degree in Computer Science. The project was initiated due to a true need in one of Texas Instruments’ <b>broadband</b> <b>solutions</b> (ARM1176 Running MV-Linux Pro-5.00). The system was originally started with shell scripts, where the init process started the rcS script, and it started some other scripts. Due to the rapid development process of the system’s software, more processes and tasks were added, and the scripts became too long, unreadable and hard to maintain. There was no efficient way to control the startup process of the system. Synchronizing inter-process dependency was difficult and determining the order of initialization required a lot of effort.|$|E
