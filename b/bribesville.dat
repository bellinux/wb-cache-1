His reporting coincided with the infamous years of bribery scandals, known as Tangentopoli (Italian for <b>Bribesville),</b> and the ascent of the Lega Nord separatist political movement - Lerner successfully portrayed in his shows the deep changes the country was experiencing.|$|E
5000|$|Notwithstanding {{the prestigious}} backing and {{successful}} initial promotion, {{the publication of}} the Korovkin’s writings in Italy in the early 1990s proved untimely. This was the period when the nation underwent the clamorous fall of the First Republic as government corruption surfaced through the institutionalized graft scandal known as [...] (<b>bribesville).</b> Thus, {{in the wake of the}} nation’s moral upheaval further promotion of the “forged” novels was judiciously halted. Subsequently however, he published other three novels in Russia under his own name: Once a Good Man and Short Stories (2001), Terms of Estrangement: Diaries of A Paratrooper (2002) and Excursion: Adventures of Modigliani the Ghost (2005).|$|E

The Regional Question and {{the issue}} of Federalism in Italy - This article deals with Italy’s {{regional}} crisis arising from the petitions – filed in the country over the last years – in favour of a transformation from the Italian centralized unitary system into a Federal form of government. 	This work reconstructs the origins of the regional question and its political-administrative decentralization since the Unity of Italy. It focuses mainly on the territorial responses and the high points of the debate developing during the XIX century between “Unitarians” and “Federalists”. In particular, we discuss Carlo Cattaneo’s argument over the creation of an actual autonomy of territorial communities generating the construction of the United Kingdoms of Italy. 	Outlining the genesis and the evolution of the Italian regions as space of government, this paper aims at identifying the practices of distribution, largely spread by cartographic representations. Moreover, it takes into consideration the persistence of such regional designs in Italians’ collective imagination. Finally, it reconstructs the basic events of Italian regions – a process delayed for several years – from the Union to Fascism, to the second post-war period, until their actual institution in the Seventies. 	At the turn of the 20 th and 21 st centuries, following the crisis caused by “Tangentopoli” (aka <b>bribesville),</b> Northern League movements and Berlusconi ‘personal party’ began to gain ground powerfully. In 2001, the changing political scene led to the approval of a constitutional amendment, introducing a concurrent legislation between State and Regions. The new legal frameworks resulting from a partial institutional revision in Italy can also be seen as the consequence of a controversial regionalization, opposing the historical “Southern question” to the merging of a new “Northern question”. Finally, the work questions some fundamental issues emerging from the difficult transition from a Regional State to a Federal one, in this contemporary late-capitalist critical age...|$|E
40|$|This project evolves {{around the}} {{problematic}} {{of corruption in}} Italy. The problem formulation “How can corruption be understood through a study of contemporary Italy with parallels to 1992 - 1994 ?” Marks the question of concern, which is explored through the theoretical concepts of social networks, corruption, clientelism, kleptocratic interdependence and trust. The theoretical concepts are combined with both primary and secondary empirical data describing the nature of corruption in both a past and present societal context. The project takes its point of departure {{in the period of}} political instability between 1992 - 1994. The corruption scandals of Tangentopoli (<b>Bribesville)</b> and the following judiciary investigation of Mani Pulite (Operation Clean Hands), form the foundation for drawing parallels between the period of 1992 - 1994 and the present day situation, of a technocratic government and the uncovering of multiple corruption scandals. The two separate time periods are compared and contrasted by their origin, nature and effect on the Italian society, in order to identify patterns of corruption in Italy. Applying historical accounts and first hand qualitative interviews outlines the course of action of respectively, Tangentopoli and Mani Pulite. The present day context is outlined by the use of news source and first hand qualitative interviews that describe multiple cases of corruption as well as anti-corruption initiatives. In order to understand the possible development of corruption in an Italian setting, different statistical empirical data are used in order to trace patterns between 1992 and 2012, and to identify public opinions regarding corruption in Italy. The project seeks to explain how corruption functions in Italy, and what impact this has on the Italian society. Parallels are drawn between social networks and clientelistic relationships in order to determine which societal functions corruption may carry out. It is concluded that there exists similar patterns between the periods of Tangentopoli and the present day, such as similar corruption scandals and distrust between political and non-political actors. These patterns are affected by international influences for example the Global Financial Crisis. This has reinforced the claim that corruption breeds during political instability...|$|E
