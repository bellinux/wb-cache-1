500|$|The genus {{is known}} {{only from the}} holotype specimen, a single fruit body (mushroom) {{currently}} residing in the private collection owned by Ettore Morone of Turin, Italy. The specimen was collected {{in one of the}} amber mines in the Cordillera Septentrional area of the island of Hispaniola, in the Dominican Republic. The amber is believed to date from the Miocene <b>Burdigalian</b> <b>stage,</b> about 20 to 16 million years before the present. It was first studied by a group of researchers consisting of David Hibbett and Michael Donoghue from Harvard University, with David Grimaldi of the American Museum of Natural History. [...] Hibbett and colleagues published their 1997 type description in the American Journal of Botany. [...] The generic name Protomycena is derived from a combination of the Latin proto meaning [...] "first", and [...] "Mycena", a modern genus that it resembles. [...] The specific epithet electra was coined by the authors from the Latin for [...] "amber", in reference to the mode of preservation.|$|E

The Oligocene-Miocene Kahak {{section of the}} Qom Formation in the Urumiehh–Dokhtar magmatic arc has been studied, in order to biostratigraphic data of the large benthic foraminifera. In the Kahak section, the foraminifera assemblages of the Qom Formation consist of Nummulites fichteli, Nummulites vascus, Eulepidina dilitata, Nephrolepidina sp., Neprolepidina tournoueri, Eulepidina sp., Pseudolituonella reicheli, Miogypsina sp., Miogypsina irregularis, Amphistegina sp., Operculina sp., Bozorginella qumiensis, Triloculina trigonula, Triloculina tricarinata, Peneroplis sp., Peneroplis thomasi, Dendritina ranji, Triloculina trigonula, Rotalia sp., Pyrgo sp., Elphidium sp., Borelis melo and Borelis curdica.  In the Kahak section of the Qom Formation, four assemblage biozones of the large benthic foraminifera have been recognized from Rupelian, Chattian, Aquitanian and <b>Burdigalian</b> <b>stages.</b> These biozones are similar to assemblage biozones of the Oligocene-Miocene Asmari Formation in the Zagros Basin in southwest of Iran. Distribution type of the Oligocene-Miocene foraminifera in the Kahak depositions of the Qom Formation indicates to depositional settings of the  lagoon, open lagoon and shallow open marine paleoenvironments.

40|$|In {{order to}} better {{understand}} the orogenic evolution of the Rif chain in the Eocene-Miocene interval, we provide new structural and kinematic data for the Jebha area, a key-sector of the Central Rif. Here the thrust sheet superposition occurs along the well-known Jebha-Chrafate lineament, widely considered as a major left-lateral transfer fault that enabled the Miocene westward migration of the internal thrust front. Our structural analysis was mainly focused on (i) the internal deformation of stacked nappes and (ii) the kinematics of the main thrust faults. Five main deformation stages were recognized for the Eocene-Miocene tectonic evolution of this area. The first orogenic pulse (D 1), which occurred in the Eocene-Oligocene interval, was responsible for the tectonic stacking of the Ghomaride Nappes. Subsequently between the late Aquitanian and the late <b>Burdigalian,</b> imbrication (<b>stage</b> D 2) occurred for some Internal Dorsale Calcaire thrust sheets within a dominant regional ENE-WSW shortening. At the Rif scale, different displacements of the WSW-migrating thrust front were accommodated by transfer structures including the Jebha-Chrafate fault. The following late Burdigalian-Langhian stage (D 3) was defined, on the contrary, by a prevalence of the radial thrust front migration. In the Jebha area the early thrusting (stage D 3 a) was characterized by a main SE-vergence. In this phase the External Dorsale Calcaire and the Maghrebian Flysch Basin Units were included in the accretionary wedge. Two late D 3 regional deformation phases were probably related to the buttressing effect that followed the collision of the thrust sheet pile against the crustal ramp of the External Rif domain. The first stage (D 3 b) consisted of an out-of-sequence thrusting recorded in the western sector of the Jebha area with the superposition of the Ghomaride Unit onto the External Dorsale Calcaire Unit, and in the eastern sector with the stacking of the Internal Dorsale Calcaire Unit directly onto the Predorsalian Unit. The second stage (D 3 c) included a late back-thrusting affecting the whole orogenic chain and deforming all the tectonic contacts. The fourth stage (D 4) was characterized by strike-slip faulting and SW-verging folding. This latter mostly affected the successions located to the East of the Jebha village and was partially synchronous with the D 3 stage. It was most probably related to the SW-migration of the internal thrust-front of the Bokkoya Dorsale Calcaire Complex and a renewed activity of the Jebha-Chrafate fault zone. The last tectonic stage (D 5) included a radial extension expressed by high and low-angle normal faults...|$|R
40|$|During {{the years}} 1959 - 1963 stratigraphical {{investigations}} {{were carried out}} in Southern Piemont (Northern Italy) along five traverses, taken {{at right angles to}} the strike of the strata, which range in age from Eocene to Pliocene. These sections are important in that they include the rype sections of some Neogene stages (Langhian, Serravallian and Tortonian) and some classical localities, such as Moliere and Costa Lupara. The sequences of these sections (numbered I-V) show large discrepancies in lithology {{as well as in the}} thickness between the corresponding units. To avoid confusion a number of formations and members are introduced for each of the sections. Parts of the sections are barren but in most portions numerous planktonic foraminifera were found. They could be used to establish ten biozones, successively I: the semi-involuta Zone, II: the cerro-azulensis Zone, III: the Globigerina Zone, IV: the Globigerinoides-Globoquadrina Zone, V: the Globorotalia Zone, VI: the bisphericus Zone, VII: the Orbulina Zone, VIII: the menardii Zone, IX: the nepenthes Zone, and X: the obliquus Zone. In addition some of the larger Foraminifera were investigated in more detail, in particular the Nephrolepidina and Miogypsina species. The embryonic-nepionic apparatus of Lepidocyclina praemarginata and Lepidocyclina morgani were compared on a biometric basis. Only a part of the phylogenetic series of the Miogypsinidae was encountered, namely from M. gunteri to M. intermedia. Correlation by means of the zonation with these larger and planktonic Foraminifera leads to interesting stratigraphic results. 1. In the correlation of the sections II, III and IV only slight differences with the Italian Geological Map have been met with, but in the sections I and V there are large deviations from this map. 2. The type Langhian appears to begin closely above the Orbulina surface. For the assumed chronological interval between Helvetian and Tortonian the author suggests to use the term Serravallian rather than Langhian, because the latter has commonly been erroneously considered to be the equivalent of the Burdigalian. The limits between the successive <b>stages</b> <b>Burdigalian,</b> Helvetian, Serravallian and Tortonian can be correlated with biozones of planktonic Foraminifera. 3. Furthermore it was found that the beginnings of the genera Globigerinoides and Globoquadrina do not coincide with the Oligocene-Miocene boundary. Both genera start their range in the Late Oligocene already. 4. Among the general conclusions of a paleogeographic nature we may note, that the transgression over the metamorphic basement of the Massif of Voltri and Ligurian Alps advanced in westward direction during Rupelian and probably Chattian times. 5. In the most eastern section (Tortona-Garbagna area) the Miocene sequence is not complete, as sediments, corresponding to at least two of the biozones are lacking here...|$|R
