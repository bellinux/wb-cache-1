5|$|Tuatara {{have been}} {{referred}} to as living fossils, which means they retain many <b>basal</b> <b>characteristics</b> from {{around the time of the}} squamate – rhynchocephalian split (220 MYA). However, taxonomic work on Sphenodontia has shown this group has undergone a variety of changes throughout the Mesozoic, and a March 2008 molecular study showed their rate of molecular evolution has been the fastest of any animal yet examined. Many of the niches occupied by lizards today were then held by sphenodontians. There was even a successful group of aquatic sphenodontians known as pleurosaurs, which differed markedly from living tuatara. Tuatara show cold weather adaptations that allow them to thrive on the islands of New Zealand; these adaptations may be unique to tuatara since their sphenodontian ancestors lived in the much warmer climates of the Mesozoic. For instance, Palaeopleurosaurus appears to have had a much shorter lifespan compared to the modern tuatara.|$|E

50|$|Iberomesornis romerali {{was more}} derived {{physically}} than Archaeopteryx. The <b>basal</b> <b>characteristic</b> {{of a long}} tail had been lost and the coracoid was longer. The vertebrate column of Iberomesornis ended in a pygostyle: a splint of bone made of fused tail vertebrae that supports the tail feathers. The shorter tail and the higher position of the shoulder indicated by the strut-like coracoid — allowing for a greater wing amplitude — improved manoeuvrability, turning and swooping at speed. Low speed flying might have been impaired {{by the lack of}} a bony keel on the sternum as attachment for the flight muscles; it is uncertain whether a true foramen triosseum was present, through which a tendon could elevate and supinate the wing.|$|R

5000|$|The {{conjunction}} of basal and derived features as distinct {{regions of the}} body in Jianianhualong and Sinosonasus represent a possible case of mosaic evolution, in which evolutionary selection acts upon distinct [...] "modules" [...] of the body. Indeed, the pattern in which basal and derived features are present seems to follow the domains of the body that are regulated by Hox genes, which have previously been discussed in the context of pterosaurs such as Darwinopterus. However, this hypothesis is weakened by the presence of characteristics in both troodontids that do not follow the pattern. In Jianianhualong, for instance, the large antorbital fenestra, long tooth row of the maxilla, and finely-serrated teeth represent <b>basal</b> <b>characteristics</b> in an otherwise derived skull. Similarly, digit II of the foot in Sinusonasus is not as specialized as those of derived troodontids, despite the hindlimb being overall derived. Conversely, the forelimb of Jianianhualong is short overall as in derived troodontids, despite the presence of basal traits.|$|E
50|$|The most {{striking}} {{feature of the}} mandible is the extreme height, especially {{when compared with the}} relatively short teeth. This seems to indicate that the jaw is also very short, with a build even more extreme than seen in the related genus Carnotaurus. The jaw flexes forwardly downwards to terminate in a deep blunt point. At the back there is a deep high furrow above it with a row of foramina that open towards the top in a series of vertical grooves. The high position is a <b>basal</b> <b>characteristic.</b> The outer lower side shows an ornamentation of pits and interweaved ridges. The front interdental plates are very high but they quickly lower towards the rear of the jaw. The tooth sockets are rectangular in upper view. The jaw carries at least ten teeth. These are relatively slender, but the front teeth have a D-shaped cross section with the convexity facing outward; the rear teeth are dagger-shaped and more flattened. The cutting edges are convex and show up to thirteen denticles per five millimetres at the crown base, and up to eight denticles near the apex. They have small blood grooves. The enamel has an irregular structure without clear ornamentation.|$|R

40|$|Summary. Among a {{group of}} 116 {{clinically}} significant isolates of Bacteroides spp., 24 exhibited P-lactamase activity greater than the <b>basal</b> level <b>characteristic</b> of most Bacteroides strains. Investigation of specific enzyme activity, iso-electric point and enzyme inhibition profiles revealed that the p-lactamases involved could be divided into four groups, some showing similarity to those described in previous studies. Seven of the enzymes were able to hydrolyse cefoxitin, latamoxef or imipenem, and eight enzymes degraded penicillin {{in the presence of}} clavulanic acid. Five strains showed reduced susceptibility to cefoxitin, latamoxef or imipenem which was not associated with P-lactamase activity...|$|R
50|$|Discovered by a Chinese farmer {{prior to}} 1992, the fossil of Sinornis {{sheds light on}} the {{evolutionary}} steps that transitioned birds into strong, specialized flyers. Paul Sereno of the University of Chicago and his colleague Rao Chenggang of the Beijing Natural History Museum {{were the first to}} name and describe the skeleton of Sinornis. Before this find much of what scientists knew about the origin of birds came from Archaeopteryx, a Jurassic species with a confusing mix of reptilian and bird-like traits. Sinornis shared many traits with modern birds while retaining certain <b>basal</b> <b>characteristics</b> of Archaeopteryx, so that in 1992 it could be presented as the missing link in avian evolution. There were other fossils discovered before Sinornis that were younger than Archaeopteryx, but Sinornis skeleton was the most complete. The fossil of Sinornis was originally dated to about 135 million years, which seemed to show that about 15 million years after Archaeopteryx the transition to the modern wing was well underway. However, later research showed that the layers in which the fossil was found were in fact about 120 to 110 million years old, reducing the importance of Sinornis. After the discovery of Sinornis, older fossils were discovered that shared even more basal features with Archaeopteryx.|$|E

50|$|Sinornis, {{the most}} {{complete}} known enantiornithean at the time, provides a detailed view of <b>basal</b> avian <b>characteristics.</b> Based on features present on the preserved skeleton of Sinornis, it shared similarity in flight performance and perching capabilities to sparrow-sized birds living today in arboreal habitats. Its thorax is strengthened to resist forces generated {{by an increase in}} pectoral muscle mass. Its coracoid expands distally to form broad, lengthened struts attached to the sternum. It also had a robust cranial rib and ossified sternal ribs. It has a V-shaped ulnare in the wrist for articulation with the metacarpus which allowed greater flexion during upstroke, important in small-bodied fliers for decreasing drag. The presence of a fully opposable hallux with a particularly large ungual and the pedal claws being strongly recurved are indicators of an advanced perching function and shows that the bird lived primarily in an arboreal habitat.|$|R

The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between QT interval and subclinical atherosclerosis, measured by carotid-femoral pulse-wave velocity. 93 patients with SLE and 109 healthy women with similar <b>basal</b> <b>characteristics</b> were studied. All patients underwent a 12 - lead electrocardiogram, and corrected QT interval (QTc) was measured using the Bazett's formula. The presence of atherosclerosis was evaluated by carotid-femoral pulse-wave velocity. Clinical <b>basal</b> <b>characteristics</b> were similar in both groups. QTc interval was 415 ± 21. 4 milliseconds in all patients, and 407 ± 19. 1 milliseconds in the control group (p = 0. 007). There was a positive correlation between QTc interval and carotid-femoral pulse-wave velocity (r = 0. 235; p = 0. 02) in patients with SLE. This association was independent of hypertension and age in a multivariate analysis. QTc interval measured by electrocardiogram is prolonged in SLE patients; it is related to subclinical atherosclerosis, measured by carotid-femoral pulse-wave velocity. This measure may help stratify risk in routine clinical practice and select the patients that might benefit from a more aggressive therapy in the prevention of cardiovascular events...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn the mammary gland, PTEN loss in luminal and basal {{epithelial}} cells results in differentiation defects and enhanced proliferation, {{leading to the}} formation of tumors with <b>basal</b> epithelial <b>characteristics.</b> In breast cancer, PTEN loss is associated with a hormone receptor-negative, basal-like subtype that is thought to originate in a luminal epithelial cell. Here, we show that luminal-specific PTEN loss results in distinct effects on epithelial homeostasis and mammary tumor formation. Luminal PTEN loss increased proliferation of hormone receptor-negative cells, thereby decreasing the percentage of hormone receptor-positive cells. Moreover, luminal PTEN loss led to misoriented cell divisions and mislocalization of cells to the intraluminal space of mammary ducts. Despite their elevated levels of activated AKT, Pten-null intraluminal cells showed increased levels of apoptosis. One year after Pten deletion, the ducts had cleared and no palpable mammary tumors were detected. These data establish PTEN as a critical regulator of luminal epithelial homeostasis and integrity in the adult mammary gland, and further show that luminal PTEN loss alone is not sufficient to promote the progression of mammary tumorigenesis...|$|R
