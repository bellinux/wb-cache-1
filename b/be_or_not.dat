25|$|In {{the first}} test call on August 3, 1876, Alexander Graham's uncle, Professor David Charles Bell, spoke {{to him from the}} Brantford {{telegraph}} office, reciting lines from Shakespeare's Hamlet ("To <b>be</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> to be...."). The young inventor, positioned at the A. Wallis Ellis store in the neighboring community of Mount Pleasant, received and may possibly have transferred his uncle's voice onto a phonautogram, a drawing made on a pen-like recording device that could produce the shapes of sound waves as waveforms onto smoked glass or other media by tracing their vibrations.|$|E
25|$|She {{also became}} {{interested}} in film {{at that time and}} after graduation appeared as an actress in a film directed by one of the group's members which won the audience award at the Pia Film Festival. When the director left the group, Matsunashi decided to make her own films though she had no formal training in cinema. Her first film, the 1995 short, To <b>Be</b> <b>or</b> <b>Not</b> to Be, which she wrote, directed and acted in, won an Encouragement Prize in the Off Theater Competition at the 1996 Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival.|$|E
25|$|Hamlet's soliloquies have {{captured}} the attention of scholars as well. Early critics viewed such speeches as To <b>be,</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> to be as Shakespeare's expressions of his own personal beliefs. Later scholars, such as Charney, have rejected this theory saying the soliloquies are expressions of Hamlet's thought process. During his speeches, Hamlet interrupts himself, expressing disgust in agreement with himself, and embellishing his own words. He has difficulty expressing himself directly, and instead skirts around the basic idea of his thought. Not until late in the play, after his experience with the pirates, is Hamlet really able to be direct and sure in his speech.|$|E
40|$|The {{content of}} school {{textbooks}} of Greek religion used {{these last few}} years has been examined. The article seeks if the discourses of scientific and religious truth -particularly those {{about the origin of}} living species - are presented as competitors <b>or</b> <b>not.</b> Representations which seem to be related in competitions are studied: the discourse <b>is</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> shown as a truth, the nature of this truth <b>is</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> considered; the discourses <b>are</b> compared <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> the nature of this comparison <b>is</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> considered, and finally, one of the two discourses is prominent over the other one. By taking support on a theoretical model developed by Wolfs, content analysis shows that, even if the discourses of the truth are explicitly presented as immense and non-competitors, some representations promote the need for indivisibility between the two. The primacy of the religious discourse on the scientific one is transmitted in a vague manner during the last years of secondary education. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

In an interview {{given in the}} 1980s, he bemoaned the lack of good character parts for aging stars, and admitted that he now took on roles mostly for the money, such as his roles in the horror potboilers The Swarm, in which he played a doctor, and Dracula's Dog, in which he played a police inspector.|$|E
25|$|Benny also {{acted in}} films, {{including}} the Academy Award-winning The Hollywood Revue of 1929, Broadway Melody of 1936 (as a benign nemesis for Eleanor Powell and Robert Taylor), George Washington Slept Here (1942), and notably, Charley's Aunt (1941) and To <b>Be</b> <b>or</b> <b>Not</b> to Be (1942). He and Livingstone {{also appeared in}} Ed Sullivan's Mr. Broadway (1933) as themselves. Benny often parodied contemporary movies and movie genres on the radio program, and the 1940 film Buck Benny Rides Again features all the main radio characters in a funny Western parody adapted from program skits. The failure of one Benny vehicle, The Horn Blows at Midnight, became a running gag on his radio and television programs, although contemporary viewers may not find the film as disappointing as the jokes suggest.|$|E

25|$|Avicenna's {{consideration}} of the essence-attributes question may be elucidated {{in terms of his}} ontological analysis of the modalities of being; namely impossibility, contingency, and necessity. Avicenna argued that the impossible being is that which cannot exist, while the contingent in itself (mumkin bi-dhatihi) has the potentiality to <b>be</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> to be without entailing a contradiction. When actualized, the contingent becomes a 'necessary existent due to what is other than itself' (wajib al-wujud bi-ghayrihi). Thus, contingency-in-itself is potential beingness that could eventually be actualized by an external cause other than itself. The metaphysical structures of necessity and contingency are different. Necessary being due to itself (wajib al-wujud bi-dhatihi) is true in itself, while the contingent being is 'false in itself' and 'true due to something else other than itself'. The necessary is the source of its own being without borrowed existence. It is what always exists.|$|E
25|$|On January 16, 1942, Lombard was a {{passenger}} on Transcontinental and Western Air Flight 3 {{with her mother}} and press agent Otto Winkler. She had just finished her 57th movie, To <b>Be</b> <b>or</b> <b>Not</b> to Be, and was on her way home from a successful war bond selling tour when the flight's DC-3 airliner crashed into a mountain near Las Vegas, Nevada, killing all 22 passengers aboard, including 15 servicemen en route to training in California. Gable flew to the crash site to claim the bodies of his wife, mother-in-law, and Winkler, who had been the best man at Gable and Lombard's wedding. Lombard was declared to be the first war-related American female casualty of World War II, and Gable received a personal note of condolence from President Roosevelt. The Civil Aeronautics Board investigation into the crash concluded that pilot error was its cause.|$|E
25|$|Oxenham is {{best known}} for her Abbey Series of 38 titles which chart the lives of the main {{characters}} from their mid-teens until their daughters reach a similar age. The Hamlet Club, formed in the first book in the series Girls of the Hamlet Club, was set up to combat snobbery in the school. Underlying the club’s overt activities of folk-dancing and rambles was its motto 'To <b>be</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> to be', and its badge, the Whiteleaf Cross. These were both symbols of deeper meanings. The motto, deliberately using a quote from the Shakespeare play Hamlet, is taken to mean to make the right choice, usually duty above self-interest, when it arises. Throughout the Abbey Series the various main characters come up against this choice and its consequences, and are shown growing and maturing through making difficult decisions. The badge, taken from a landmark local to the area in which the series is set, is also symbolic—as is any cross—of sacrifice.|$|E

500|$|The final lines {{spoken by}} Chang {{before he is}} obliterated by torpedo fire are lifted from Hamlet's famous soliloquy: [...] "to <b>be,</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> to be..." [...] Flinn was {{initially}} unsure about the numerous classical quotations, but when Plummer was cast, Meyer enthusiastically added more. He said, [...] "Whether it's pretentious or not, I {{think it depends on}} how it's used. [...] I don't quite agree with using too much of that sort of thing, but once you get Plummer, suddenly it's working." ...|$|E

In Angela Carter's Wise Children, To <b>be</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> {{to be is}} reworked as a song and dance routine, and Iris Murdoch's The Black Prince has Oedipal themes and murder intertwined with a love affair between a Hamlet-obsessed writer, Bradley Pearson, and the daughter of his rival.|$|E

500|$|Facundo is {{not only}} a {{critique}} of Rosas's dictatorship, but a broader investigation into Argentine history and culture, which Sarmiento charts through the rise, controversial rule, and downfall of Juan Facundo Quiroga, an archetypical Argentine caudillo. Sarmiento summarizes the book's message in the phrase [...] "That is the point: to <b>be</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> to be savages". The dichotomy between civilization and barbarism is the book's central idea; Facundo Quiroga is portrayed as wild, untamed, and standing opposed to true progress through his rejection of European cultural idealsfound at that time in the metropolitan society of Buenos Aires.|$|E
500|$|Lombard's final film, To <b>Be</b> <b>or</b> <b>Not</b> to Be (1942), {{directed}} by Ernst Lubitsch and co-starring Jack Benny, a satire about Nazism and World War II, was in post-production {{at the time}} of her death. The film's producers decided to cut part of the film in which Lombard's character asks, [...] "What can happen on a plane?" [...] out of respect for the circumstances surrounding her death. When the film was released, it received mixed reviews, particularly about its controversial content, but Lombard's performance was hailed as the perfect send-off to one of 1930s Hollywood's most important stars.|$|E
500|$|The {{discovery}} in 1823 of Q1—whose existence {{had been quite}} unsuspected—caused considerable interest and excitement, raising many questions of editorial practice and interpretation. Scholars immediately identified apparent deficiencies in Q1, which {{was instrumental in the}} development of the concept of a Shakespearean [...] "bad quarto". Yet Q1 has value: it contains stage directions (such as Ophelia entering with a lute and her hair down) that reveal actual stage practices in a way that Q2 and F1 do not; it contains an entire scene (usually labelled 4.6) that does not appear in either Q2 or F1; and it is useful for comparison with the later editions. The major deficiency of Q1 is in the language: particularly noticeable in the opening lines of the famous [...] "To <b>be,</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> to be" [...] soliloquy: [...] "To <b>be,</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> to be, aye there's the point. / To die, to sleep, is that all? Aye all: / No, to sleep, to dream, aye marry there it goes." [...] However, the scene order is more coherent, without the problems of Q2 and F1 of Hamlet seeming to resolve something in one scene and enter the next drowning in indecision. New Cambridge editor Kathleen Irace has noted that [...] "Q1's more linear plot design is certainly easier [...] to follow [...] but the simplicity of the Q1 plot arrangement eliminates the alternating plot elements that correspond to Hamlet's shifts in mood." ...|$|E
