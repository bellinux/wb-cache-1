40|$|<b>Bryophytes</b> (mosses, liverworts and hornworts) are {{the most}} basal {{lineages}} among extant land plants.

In order to resolve these issues we conducted a bioinformatics analysis on available chloroplast genomes of 1 green alga, 5 <b>bryophytes,</b> 4 pteridophytes, and 6 gymnosperms. Our study is based on multiple genome analysis through whole proteome comparison. The higher number of orthologous identified in Anthoceros (a hornwort), in comparison to other <b>bryophytes</b> considered, against all pteridophytes strongly support hornworts as transition link between <b>bryophytes</b> and pteridophytes...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} to summarize recent knowledge about Species Distribution Modelling in botany, focusing on <b>bryophytes.</b> Species Distribution Modelling is used to explain the relationship between species occurrences and environmental conditions of their habitats. This method has unused potential in <b>bryophytes</b> compared to vascular plants. The distribution of <b>bryophytes</b> is influenced by their dispersal and ecological characteristics. The most important factor is a close association between <b>bryophytes</b> and microclimatic conditions of their habitats. This association is studied, but is not yet incorporated in the modelling process along with using data in an appropriate scale. Currently there is an increased interest in <b>bryophytes</b> distribution modelling. In Europe, there are some studies using this method for <b>bryophytes</b> mainly in Iberian Peninsula, Italy and northern Europe. There are approximately 25 articles focused on <b>bryophytes</b> distribution modelling worldwide.

5|$|Species {{boundaries}} in plants may be weaker than in animals, and cross species hybrids are often possible. A familiar example is peppermint, Mentha × piperita, a sterile hybrid between Mentha aquatica and spearmint, Mentha spicata. The many cultivated varieties of wheat {{are the result}} of multiple inter- and intra-specific crosses between wild species and their hybrids. Angiosperms with monoecious flowers often have self-incompatibility mechanisms that operate between the pollen and stigma so that the pollen either fails to reach the stigma or fails to germinate and produce male gametes. This is one of several methods used by plants to promote outcrossing. In many land plants the male and female gametes are produced by separate individuals. These species are said to be dioecious when referring to vascular plant sporophytes and dioicous when referring to <b>bryophyte</b> gametophytes.|$|E
5|$|The flora of {{the country}} is varied {{incorporating}} both deciduous and coniferous woodland and moorland and tundra species. However, large scale commercial tree planting and the management of upland moorland habitat for the grazing of sheep and commercial field sport activities impacts upon the distribution of indigenous plants and animals. The UK's tallest tree is a grand fir planted beside Loch Fyne, Argyll in the 1870s, and the Fortingall Yew may be 5,000 years old and is probably the oldest living thing in Europe. Although the number of native vascular plants is low by world standards, Scotland's substantial <b>bryophyte</b> flora is of global importance.|$|E

5|$|Between Kintbury Lock and Newbury, passing to {{the north}} of Hamstead Marshall, the canal is very close to the River Kennet, which flows into the canal via several channels. The canal passes through an area known as the Kennet Valley Alderwoods, the largest {{remaining}} fragments of damp, ash-alder woodland in the River Kennet floodplain. The SSSI includes two woods– the Wilderness and part of Ryott's Plantation– which are important because they support a very great diversity of plants associated with this woodland type, dominated by alder (Alnus glutinosa); though ash (Fraxinus excelsior) is abundant in places and there is occasional oak (Quercus robur) and wych elm (Ulmus glabra). In addition to the wide range of higher plants the woods support a diverse <b>bryophyte</b> flora including the uncommon epiphytes Radula complanata, Zygodon viridissimus and Orthotrichum affine. Nearby is Irish Hill Copse. This site of coppiced ancient woodland includes an extensive area of calcareous ash/wych elm coppice on the hill sides, merging into wet ash/maple and acid oak/ash/hazel woodland with aspen, on the higher parts of the site. The lower slopes are dominated by dog's mercury (Mercurialis perennis), with abundant herb paris (Paris quadrifolia), toothwort (Lathraea squamaria), Solomon's seal (Polygonatum multiflorum), twayblade and early purple orchids (Listera ovata) and Orchis mascula and, locally, wild daffodil (Narcissus pseudonarcissus).|$|E

The earliest diverging polysporangiophytes in the cladogram are the Horneophytopsida, a clade at the 'protracheophyte' grade that is sister to all other polysporangiophytes. They had essentially an isomorphic alternation of generations (meaning that the sporophytes and gametophytes were equally free living), which might suggest that both the gametophyte-dominant life style of bryophytes and the sporophyte-dominant life style of vascular plants evolved from this isomorphic condition. They were leafless and did not have true vascular tissues. In particular, they did not have tracheids: elongated cells that help transport water and mineral salts, and that develop a thick lignified wall at maturity that provides mechanical strength. Unlike plants at the <b>bryophyte</b> grade, their sporophytes were branched.|$|E

40|$|Global {{change is}} {{predicted}} to have large and rapid impact on polar and alpine regions. <b>Bryophytes</b> and lichens increase their importance in terms of biomass, carbon/nutrient cycling, cover and ecosystem functioning at higher latitudes/altitudes. Here we report from a seven year factorial experiment with nutrient addition and warming on the abundance of <b>bryophytes</b> and lichens in an alpine meadow and heath community. Treatments had significant negative effect on relative change of total abundance <b>bryophytes</b> and lichens, the largest decline to the nutrient addition and the combined nutrient addition and warming treatments, <b>bryophytes</b> decreasing most in the meadow, lichens most in the heath.

40|$|Due {{to their}} {{particular}} physiology and life history traits, <b>bryophytes</b> are critical in regulating biogeochemical cycles and functions in alpine ecosystem. Hence, {{it is crucial}} to investigate their nutrient utilization strategies in comparison with vascular plants and understand their responses to the variation of growing season caused by climate change. Firstly, this study testified whether or not <b>bryophytes</b> can absorb nitrogen (N) directly from soil through spiking three chemical forms of 15 N stable isotope tracer. Secondly, with stronger ability of carbohydrates assimilation and photosynthesis, it is supposed that N utilization efficiency of vascular plants is significantly higher than that of <b>bryophytes.</b> However, the recovery of soil N by <b>bryophytes</b> can still compete with vascular plants due to their greater phytomass. Thirdly, resource acquisition may be varied from the change of growing season, during which N pulse can be manipulated with 15 N tracer addition at different time. Both of <b>bryophytes</b> and vascular plants contain more N in a longer growing season, and prefer inorganic over organic N. <b>Bryophytes</b> assimilate more NH 4 + than NO 3 - and amino acid, which can be indicated from the greater shoot excess 15 N of <b>bryophytes.</b> However, vascular plants prefer to absorb NO 3 - for their developed root systems and vascular tissue. Concerning the uptake of three forms N by <b>bryophytes,</b> there is significant difference between two manipulated lengths of growing season. Furthermore, the capacity of <b>bryophytes</b> to tolerate N-pollution may be lower than currently appreciated, which indicates the effect of climate change on asynchronous variation of soil N pools with plant requirements...|$|R

40|$|Whilst {{light is}} {{essential}} for photosynthesis and development of plants, both excess photosynthetically active radiation and certain wavelengths (e. g. high energy ultraviolet-B) radiation can be damaging. Plants in general possess a suite of mechanisms that act to either prevent absorption of damaging and excess radiation or to mitigate against the damage that such radiation can cause once it is absorbed. Whilst <b>bryophytes</b> share many of these photoprotective mechanisms with the vascular plants, there are key differences in the photoprotection available to <b>bryophytes.</b> Some of these differences pertain to structural features, such as protective epidermal layers, {{that are available to}} vascular plants but not generally to <b>bryophytes.</b> <b>Bryophytes</b> thus have to invest more in cellular level photoprotection than vascular plants. In other respects <b>bryophytes</b> may retain mechanisms found in algal ancestors (e. g. thermal energy dissipation associated with the LHCSR protein) that have been lost during the evolution of vascular plants. Many <b>bryophytes</b> are able to manage light absorption during desiccation and rehydration and freezing and thawing, resulting in potentially novel mechanisms of energy dissipation.
