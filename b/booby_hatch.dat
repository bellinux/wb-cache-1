60|$|And {{then came}} Mr. Mellaire. He had slipped down the <b>booby</b> <b>hatch</b> {{into the big}} after-room and thence through the hallway to my room. He entered noiselessly, on clumsy tiptoes, and pressed his finger warningly to his lips. Not until he was beside my bunk did he speak, {{and then it was}} in a whisper.|$|E

So engrossed had they been {{that they had not}} seen Miss Bishop come from the door of the passage leading to the cabin. And there was something else that those three men on the poop, and Pitt immediately below them, had failed to observe. Some moments ago Ogle, followed by the main body of his gun-deck crew, had emerged from the <b>booby</b> <b>hatch,</b> to fall into muttered, angrily vehement talk with those who, abandoning the gun-tackles upon which they were labouring, had come to crowd about him.|$|E

A light east wind blew behind them, the water sparkled {{as the moon}} rose, and shadowy woods and dark hills opened out and faded on their port side. The night was warm, the sea ran in long undulations, wrinkled by the breeze. In the distance one heard surf break upon the reefs, and {{now and then a}} steamer with throbbing engines went by. Wyndham lounged at the tiller, Marston and Mabel sat under the <b>booby</b> <b>hatch</b> and talked quietly, while Flora, in the cockpit sang a song. Red Rose, lurching gently with all sail set, headed for the west.|$|E

The Arangi's two masts were of Oregon cedar, so scraped and hot-paraffined that they shone like tan opals {{in the glare of}} sun.

She was sixty feet over all, and the cross beams of her crown deck had not been weakened by deck-houses. The only breaks--and no beams had been cut for them--were the main cabin skylight and companionway, the <b>booby</b> <b>hatch</b> for'ard over the tiny forecastle, and the small hatch aft that let down into the store-room.|$|E

40|$|Background: Exposure to androgens {{early in}} development, while {{activating}} adaptive aggressive behavior, may also exert long-lasting effects on non-target components of phenotype. Here we compare these organizational effects of perinatal androgens in closely related Nazca (Sula granti) and blue-footed (S. nebouxii) boobies that differ in neonatal social system. The older of two Nazca booby hatchlings unconditionally attacks and ejects the younger from the nest {{within days of}} <b>hatching,</b> while blue-footed <b>booby</b> neonates lack lethal aggression. Both Nazca booby chicks facultatively upregulate testosterone (T) during fights, motivating the prediction that baseline androgen levels differ between obligately siblicidal and other species. Methodology/Principal Findings: We show that obligately siblicidal Nazca <b>boobies</b> <b>hatch</b> with higher circulating androgen levels than do facultatively siblicidal blue-footed boobies, providing comparative evidence {{of the role of}} androgens in sociality. Although androgens confer a short-term benefit of increased aggression to Nazca booby neonates, exposure to elevated androgen levels during this sensitive period in development can also induce long-term organizational effects on behavior or morphology. Adult Nazca boobies show evidence of organizational effects of early androgen exposure in aberrant adult behavior: they visit unattended non-familial chicks in the colony and direct mixtures of aggression, affiliative, and sexual behavior toward them. In a longitudinal analysis, we found that the most active Non-parental Adult Visitor...|$|R
60|$|They greeted our {{approach}} {{with the most}} discordant din it had ever been my fortune to hear. A mingling of honk and cackle, it manifested not excitement so much as curiosity. I walked among the boobies, and they never moved except to pick at me with long, sharp bills. Many were sitting on nests, and all around in the sand were nests with eggs, and little <b>boobies</b> just <b>hatched,</b> and others in every stage of growth, up to big babies of birds like huge balls of pure white wool. I wondered where the thousands of mothers were. The young ones showed no concern when I picked them up, save to dig into me with curious bills.|$|R
50|$|In {{these three}} <b>booby</b> species, <b>hatching</b> order {{indicates}} chick hierarchy in the nest. The A-chick is dominant to the B-chick, {{which in turn}} is dominant to the C chick, etc. (when there are more than two chicks per brood) Masked booby and Nazca booby dominant A-chicks always begin pecking their younger sibling(s) as soon as they hatch; moreover, assuming it is healthy, the A-chick usually pecks its younger sibling to death or pushes it out of the nest scrape within the first two days that the junior chick is alive. Blue-footed booby A-chicks also express their dominance by pecking their younger sibling. However, unlike the obligately siblicidal masked and Nazca booby chicks, their behavior is not always lethal. A study by Lougheed and Anderson (1999) reveals that blue-footed booby senior chicks only kill their siblings in times of food shortage. Furthermore, even when junior chicks are killed, it does not happen immediately. According to Anderson, the average age of death of the junior chick in a masked booby brood is 1.8 days, while the average age of death of the junior chick in a blue-footed booby brood may be as high as 18 days. The difference in age of death in the junior chick in each booby species is indicative of the type of siblicide that the species practices. Facultatively siblicidal blue-footed booby A-chicks only kill their nest mate(s) when necessary. Obligately siblicidal masked and Nazca booby A-chicks kill their sibling no matter if resources are plentiful or not; in other words, siblicidal behavior occurs independently of environmental factors.|$|R
