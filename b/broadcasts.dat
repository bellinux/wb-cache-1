40|$|Abstract—Broadcast routing is a {{critical}} component in the routing design. While {{there are plenty of}} routing metrics and <b>broadcast</b> routing schemes in current literature, it remains an unsolved problem as to which metrics are compatible to a specific <b>broadcast</b> routing scheme. In particular, in the wireless <b>broadcast</b> routing context where transmission has an inherent <b>broadcast</b> property, there is a potential danger of incompatible combination of <b>broadcast</b> routing algorithms and metrics. This paper shows that different <b>broadcast</b> routing algorithms have different requirements on the properties of <b>broadcast</b> routing metrics. The metric properties for <b>broadcast</b> routing algorithms in both undirected network topologies and directed network topologies are developed and proved. They are successfully used to verify the compatibility between <b>broadcast</b> routing metrics and <b>broadcast</b> routing algorithms. This work provides important criteria in <b>broadcast</b> routing metric design. Index Terms—Broadcast routing, Routing protocols, Routing metric design. ...|$|R
