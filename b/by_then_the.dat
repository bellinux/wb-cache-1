5|$|At 15:30, Egyptian forces {{captured}} Fort Lahtzanit, {{the first}} fortification of the Bar Lev Line to fall, and <b>by</b> <b>then</b> <b>the</b> infantry had been reinforced with 82mm B-10 and 107mm B-11 rifles. At the same time, engineers began operating their water pumps against the sand wall, opening the first passage {{in less than}} an hour, and the Egyptians moved up their bridging units to the canal. By 16:30 eight waves had brought across the canal ten infantry brigades in all five bridgeheads, totaling 23,500 men (around 4,700 at each bridgehead). Each bridgehead was on average six kilometers (3¾ mi) wide and around two kilometers deep. The Egyptians had high-velocity 85mm and 100mm rifled anti-tank guns in action on the east bank by that time.|$|E
5|$|Auxiliary regiments {{were often}} {{stationed}} in provinces {{other than that}} {{in which they were}} originally raised, for reasons of security and to foster the process of Romanisation in the provinces. The regimental names of many auxiliary units persisted into the 4th century, but <b>by</b> <b>then</b> <b>the</b> units in question were different in size, structure, and quality from their predecessors.|$|E

5|$|By 1942, {{there were}} {{proposals}} for completely buried flame fougasses {{to be used}} as oil mines but <b>by</b> <b>then</b> <b>the</b> emergency was over. Almost all flame fougasses were removed {{before the end of the}} war and in most instances even the slightest traces of their original locations have disappeared. A few instances were missed, and their remains have been found. For example, the rusty remnants of a four-barrel battery, one of which still contained an oily residue, were discovered in 2010 in West Sussex.|$|E
5|$|By 1971, both Egypt and Saudi Arabia had {{disengaged}} from Yemen. South Yemen {{formed a}} connection with the Soviet Union. In September 1971, Amri resigned after murdering a photographer in San'a, and more power was given to Iryani, the effective President. <b>By</b> <b>then,</b> <b>the</b> royalists were integrated into the new republic, except for al-Badr's family, and a consultative Council was established. Clashes along {{the border between the}} states rose, and in 1972 a small war broke.|$|E
5|$|By 1972, Diefenbaker {{had grown}} disillusioned with Trudeau, and campaigned wholeheartedly for the Tories in that year's election. Diefenbaker was reelected comfortably {{in his home}} riding, and the Progressive Conservatives came within two seats of {{matching}} the Liberal total. Diefenbaker was relieved both that Trudeau had been humbled and that Stanfield had been denied power. Trudeau regained his majority two years later in an election that saw Diefenbaker, <b>by</b> <b>then</b> <b>the</b> only living former Prime Minister, have his personal majority grow to 11,000 votes.|$|E

5|$|<b>By</b> <b>then,</b> <b>the</b> Pagan Empire, despite outward {{appearances}} of calmness, {{had been in}} long and slow decline since the early 13th century. The continuous growth of tax-free religious wealth had greatly reduced the tax base of the kingdom. The crown had lost resources needed to retain the loyalty of courtiers and military servicemen, inviting a vicious circle of internal disorders and external challenges. Although {{it was able to}} put down the first batch of serious rebellions in 1258–60 in South Arakan and Martaban (Mottama), the decline continued. On the eve of the Mongol invasions, between one and two-thirds of Upper Burma's cultivable land had been donated to religion. The crown's ability to mobilize defenses was in serious jeopardy.|$|E
5|$|Detractors of {{the flag}} movement, {{including}} Motilal Nehru, soon hailed the Swaraj flag {{as a symbol of}} national unity. Thus, the flag became a significant structural component of the institution of India. In contrast to the subdued responses of the past, the British Indian government took greater cognisance of the new flag, and began to define a policy of response. The British parliament discussed public use {{of the flag}}, and based on directives from England, the British Indian government threatened to withdraw funds from municipalities and local governments that did not prevent the display of the Swaraj flag. The Swaraj flag became the official flag of Congress at the 1931 meeting. However, <b>by</b> <b>then,</b> <b>the</b> flag had already become the symbol of the independence movement.|$|E
5|$|During {{this period}} Pixar {{continued}} its successful relationship with Walt Disney Feature Animation, a studio whose corporate parent would ultimately become {{its most important}} partner. As 1991 began, however, the layoff of 30 employees in the company's computer hardware department—including the company's president, Chuck Kolstad, reduced {{the total number of}} employees to just 42, essentially its original number. Yet Pixar made a historic $26million deal with Disney to produce three computer-animated feature films, the first of which was Toy Story. <b>By</b> <b>then</b> <b>the</b> software programmers, who were doing RenderMan and IceMan, and Lasseter's animation department, which made television commercials (and four Luxo Jr. shorts for Sesame Street the same year), were all that remained of Pixar.|$|E

5|$|Heraclius's {{defeat of}} the Persians ended a war that {{had been going on}} {{intermittently}} for almost 400 years and led to instability in the Persian Empire. Kavadh II died only months after assuming the throne, plunging Persia into several years of dynastic turmoil and civil war. Ardashir III, Heraclius's ally Shahrbaraz, and Khosrau's daughters Purandokht and Azarmidokht all succeeded to the throne within months of each other. Only when Yazdgerd III, a grandson of Khosrau II, succeeded to the throne in 632 was there stability. But <b>by</b> <b>then</b> <b>the</b> Sasanid Empire was severely disorganised and had been severely weakened by years of war and civil strife over the succession to the throne.|$|E
5|$|Iles {{remained}} as superintendent until 1957, and {{proved to be}} a good publicist for the zoo, taking part in radio and television programmes such as Children's Hour.

The zoo's last superintendent, Peter Grayson, took over in 1971, but <b>by</b> <b>then</b> <b>the</b> owners of Belle Vue had lost interest in the zoo, and closure seemed imminent.|$|E

5|$|In 1139 Foliot {{was elected}} Abbot of Gloucester, blessed by the diocesan bishop on 11June 1139. The {{appointment}} {{had been pushed}} through by Foliot's relative, Miles of Gloucester, who was <b>by</b> <b>then</b> <b>the</b> Earl of Hereford. Foliot was well connected at court in other respects, for his probable father had been steward to David I, before David became King of Scotland. David was the uncle of both the Empress and Stephen's wife. Following his elevation to abbot Foliot recognised Stephen as king, although he seems until then to have supported Matilda.|$|E
5|$|In 1898 the Westbury and Hagley Water Act was passed, {{providing}} {{for construction of}} a reticulated water scheme using water from the Meander River and other streams. Hagley was connected to mains water via the Westbury-Hagley water scheme in 1902. By 1923 residents of Hagley were asking for an upgrade of the system, as it was seen as inadequate <b>by</b> <b>then.</b> <b>The</b> Westbury Council took out loans in 1952 to extend the system, and work on this extension continued into 1954, still connected to Westbury although with larger diameter pipes.|$|E
