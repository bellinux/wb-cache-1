5|$|Destruction Derby is a {{vehicular}} combat racing {{video game}} {{based on the}} sport of demolition derby. The game contains three vehicles. Collisions in the game affect the controls of each car, limiting their steering and maximum speed. Frontal collisions risk damage to the car's radiator, which causes the car to overheat and stop running. Four game modes are available: Destruction Derby, Wreckin' Racing, Stock Car Racing and Time Trial. In Destruction Derby, the player earns points <b>by</b> <b>destroying</b> other cars in a large, trackless arena called The Bowl; in Stock Car Racing, the player must finish in first place, and no points are awarded for destroying cars. Wreckin' Racing is a hybrid of the two, in which the player earns points both by winning the race and <b>by</b> <b>destroying</b> other cars. Time Trial is a solo time attack mode. The PlayStation version features system link play for two players, while the MS-DOS version has an online multiplayer mode.|$|E

5|$|In April, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto {{used the}} {{additional}} air resources allocated to Rabaul in Operation I-Go, an air offensive designed to redress the situation <b>by</b> <b>destroying</b> Allied ships and aircraft in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands.

5|$|The Mongols sought {{alliances with}} other nations and {{societies}} to ensure the flow of trade through the empire. The Mongol army was also used to reshape and streamline the flow of trade through the continent <b>by</b> <b>destroying</b> cities on the less-important or more inaccessible routes. The Mongol military was mostly made up of cavalrymen. This allowed the military to move swiftly and easily over large distances.|$|E
5|$|The {{objective}} of the bombardment of Ancona was to delay the Italian Army from deploying its forces {{along the border with}} Austria-Hungary <b>by</b> <b>destroying</b> critical transportation systems. The surprise attack on Ancona succeeded in delaying the Italian deployment to the Alps for two weeks. This delay gave Austria-Hungary valuable time to strengthen its Italian border and re-deploy some of its troops from the Eastern and Balkan fronts.|$|E

5|$|Dracula's Daughter {{tells the}} story of Countess Marya Zaleska, the {{daughter}} of Count Dracula and herself a vampire. Following Dracula's death, she believes that <b>by</b> <b>destroying</b> his body she will be free of his influence and can live as a human. When this fails, she turns to psychiatry and Dr. Jeffrey Garth. When his efforts fail, she kidnaps Janet, the woman Jeffrey loves, and flees with her to Transylvania in an attempt to bind Jeffrey to her. She is foiled and destroyed when her jealous manservant shoots her with an arrow.|$|E
5|$|Heraclius' {{accession}} as Emperor {{did little}} to reduce the Persian threat. Heraclius began his reign by attempting {{to make peace with}} the Persians, since Phocas, whose actions were the original casus belli, had been overthrown. The Persians rejected these overtures, however, since their armies were widely victorious. According to historian Walter Kaegi, it is conceivable that the Persians' goal was to restore or even surpass the boundaries of the Achaemenid Empire <b>by</b> <b>destroying</b> the Byzantine empire, though because of the loss of Persian archives, no document survives to conclusively prove this.|$|E

5|$|In August 1916, a {{combined}} Ottoman and German Empire army {{had been forced}} to retreat to Bir el Abd, after the British victory in the Battle of Romani. During the following three months the defeated force retired further eastwards to El Arish, while the captured territory stretching from the Suez Canal was consolidated and garrisoned by the EEF. Patrols and reconnaissances were carried out by British forces, to protect the continuing construction of the railway and water pipeline and to deny passage across the Sinai desert to the Ottoman forces <b>by</b> <b>destroying</b> water cisterns and wells.|$|E
5|$|In March 1904 Neild {{attacked}} the government's military {{policy and the}} commander of the military forces, Major-General Sir Edward Hutton, who had long wished to dismiss Neild from the citizen army. Neild had incited a near mutiny <b>by</b> <b>destroying</b> a well-known sergeant's military career, and was suspended from duty; Neild responded by accusing Hutton of intimidation and infringing a Senator's right of freedom of expression. In April 1904 the Senate formed a committee to investigate alleged contempt of Parliament by Hutton, which found that Neild had not been intimidated. In 1905 Neild retired from the militia.|$|E
5|$|In pre-Islamic Arabia, a time {{known as}} jahiliyyah, the Kaaba became {{surrounded}} by pagan idols. In 630 CE, Muhammad led his followers from Medina to Mecca, cleansed the Kaaba <b>by</b> <b>destroying</b> all the pagan idols, and then reconsecrated {{the building to}} Allah. In 632 CE, Muhammad performed his only and last pilgrimage {{with a large number}} of followers, and instructed them on the rites of Hajj.

5|$|Irreversible {{inhibition}} {{is different}} from irreversible enzyme inactivation. Irreversible inhibitors are generally specific for one class of enzyme and do not inactivate all proteins; they do not function <b>by</b> <b>destroying</b> protein structure but by specifically altering the active site of their target. For example, extremes of pH or temperature usually cause denaturation of all protein structure, {{but this is a}} non-specific effect. Similarly, some non-specific chemical treatments destroy protein structure: for example, heating in concentrated hydrochloric acid will hydrolyse the peptide bonds holding proteins together, releasing free amino acids.|$|E
5|$|It {{served with}} only a few units in Sicily and Italy. On one {{occasion}} in Sicily, a T19 company (part of the 16th Infantry Regiment) halted a German tank attack <b>by</b> <b>destroying</b> six tanks, for the loss of one T19. That unit was later awarded the Presidential Unit Citation. A few served as late as 1945 in southern France. It was finally declared obsolete in July 1945. That month, the contractor Brown & McLaughlin converted 90 T19s into M3A1 Half-tracks.|$|E
5|$|Some historians {{emphasize}} that the leagues were engaged in class struggle against a coalition of landowners and mafiosi and ignore evidence of strategic alliances between the Fasci and the Mafia. The leagues were not only led by socialists and anarchists; some were run by local gentry and mafiosi. The Mafia bosses Vito Cascioferro and Nunzio Giaimo led the Fasci in Bisacquino in alliance with Verro. The Mafia was sometimes needed to enforce flying pickets with credible threats of violence {{and to make the}} strike costly to landowners <b>by</b> <b>destroying</b> their property.|$|E

5|$|Approximately 19 {{percent of}} all paralytic polio cases have both bulbar and spinal symptoms; this subtype is called {{respiratory}} or bulbospinal polio. Here, the virus affects {{the upper part of}} the cervical spinal cord (cervical vertebrae C3 through C5), and paralysis of the diaphragm occurs. The critical nerves affected are the phrenic nerve (which drives the diaphragm to inflate the lungs) and those that drive the muscles needed for swallowing. <b>By</b> <b>destroying</b> these nerves, this form of polio affects breathing, making it difficult or impossible for the patient to breathe without the support of a ventilator. It can lead to paralysis of the arms and legs and may also affect swallowing and heart functions.|$|E
