40|$|Humic {{substances}} {{are able}} to reduce the surface tension of their solutions and thus can act as surface-active substances in the natural environment, which may have industrial application. The ability to influence the surface tension of humic acid solutions depends {{on the origin of}} the humic acids. The objective of this study was comparison of the ability of humic acids of different origin (soil, water, peat, lignite etc.) to influence the surface tension of their solutions, and identification of the structural characteristics of peat humic acids that determine their surfactant properties. Industrially produced humic materials demonstrated no or insignificant impact on the surface tension of their solutions. However, humic acids isolated from peat had significant impact of the surface tension of their solutions, acting as weak surfactants. The surface tension of humic acid solutions decreased with increasing concentration, and depended on solution pH. Using a well-characterised <b>bog</b> <b>profile,</b> the ability to influence the surface tension of peat humic acids was shown to depend on age and humification degree. With increase of the humification degree and age, molecular complexity of humic acids and their ability to influence surface tension decreased; but nevertheless, the impact of the biological precursor (peat-forming bryophytes and plants) could be identified...|$|E

The 'Siedlungskammer' consists of an isolated pleistocene sand ground (Geest-island) surroundet by bogs. Starting {{from the edge of the}} Geest, near which large-scale archaeological excavations are carried out, three raised <b>bog</b> <b>profiles</b> were taken at 300, 500 and 4000 m off the prehistoric settlement. They were investigated by means of pollen analysis, and reflect in a decreasing way the activities of man on the Geestisland. Another pollen diagram from the nearby fen peat was worked out for comparison. At the same time it helped to date back a prehistoric sand path to the Roman period. The pollen diagrams cover the vegetational history without gaps from the early Atlantic period to modern times. The vegetation was decisively determined by the poor soils of this area. T'he pollen diagrams give evidence of the activity of settlers since the Neolithic age, with some gaps in the beginning, but later continuously from the middle of the Bronze age until the early migration period. The influence of the nearby settlement, which existed from the Birth of Christ to the 4 / 5 th century, comes out distinctly. Among the cereals which were then cultivated here, there also was rye, at least in the 4 / 5 th century, but most probably already during the Roman period. Besides that people cultivated barley, oats, and flax. The settlement break during the so-called dark ages between the 4 / 5 th century and the time about 800 A. D. was confirmed by pollen analysis. During this time the area was once more covered by forests. The fluctuations of man's activities during the late Middle Ages and modern times, as they are made visible by pollen analysis, correspond to historically wellknown developments...|$|R
40|$|Peatlands are {{archives}} of extreme {{importance for the}} assessment of past ecological, environmental and climatic changes. The importance as natural archives is even greater in the case of ombrotrophic peat bogs, where the only inputs are atmospheric in origin. Here we integrated previously published physical and chemical results regarding the solid and liquid phase of peat with a biomolecular microbiological approach to assess the relationships between chemistry and microbial biodiversity along a Swiss <b>bog</b> <b>profile</b> corresponding to approximately 2, 000 years of peat formation. The structure of bacterial and archaeal communities was assessed through a polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) approach followed by sequencing of PCR-DGGE bands of interest. Both chemical and microbiological data showed a differentiation of properties along the peat profile, with three major zones identified. Both bacterial and archaeal profiles clustered according to the depth (i. e., age) of samples. Among bacteria, Acidobacteria were recovered primarily in the first layers of the profile, whereas methanogenic archaea were more commonly recovered in the deepest part of the core, corresponding to the occurring anoxic conditions. Finally, a number of sequences had low homologies with known species, especially in bacteria: this points to an almost unknown microbial community adapted to the extreme conditions of peat bogs, which are acidic, rich in dissolved organic C, and predominantly anoxic. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|E
40|$|Ombrotrophic peat bogs are not {{directly}} in contact with groundwater: since their genesis is related only to wet and dry deposition they are considered natural archives of extreme importance {{for the assessment of}} past ecological, environmental and climatic events. Etang de la Gruère is an ombrotrophic Swiss bog representing the longest continuous record of atmospheric deposition in continental Europe (corresponding to ca. 15, 000 years of peat formation). Aim of the present study is to assess, in ca 20 samples along the peat <b>bog</b> <b>profile,</b> the presence and distribution of two very important classes of biomolecules: DNA and lipids. PCR-DGGE analysis of DNA targeting total bacteria and archaea allowed the identification of biodiversity patterns that clustered according to the profile depth and chemical analyses. It was found that the microbial communities changed significantly below ca 45 cm, where conditions are anoxic and molecules with higher molecular mass and degree of condensation are observed. Acidobacteria dominated the most superficial samples, while methanomicrobia were more common in the deepest samples. It was also found that the homologies scores decreased with depth, thus pointing to a less known microbial community composition in the oldest samples. Lipid analyses are now being carried out to integrate and extend the findings at DNA level. Specifically the analyses are focusing on phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) and tetraether lipids, which are respectively indicators of bacterial and archaeal microbial communities. In the case of tetraether lipids, their possible application as “paleo-thermometers” is also being tested...|$|E
40|$|Peatlands are {{widespread}} and important natural archives of environmental change. Here we explore {{the potential of}} the recently introduced MBT-CBT proxy (methylation index and cyclisation ratio of branched tetraethers) to estimate past annual mean air temperature (MAT) based on the distribution of bacterially-derived branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether (GDGT) membrane lipids in peat and coal. To this end, branched GDGTs in an ombrotrophic peat bog from Switzerland and three coal deposits of increasing maturity were analysed. For the surface of the bog, reconstructed annual MAT is higher than both measured annual MAT and measured in situ pore water temperature. Changes in the CBT ratio, considered a proxy for pH, with depth in the bog do not match with present day in situ pore water pH, but coincide with a peat stratigraphic boundary. This indicates that GDGTs down the <b>bog</b> <b>profile</b> are predominantly fossil and not derived from extant biomass. The MBT-CBT derived annual MAT record also shows a large drop at this stratigraphic boundary, which likely relates to past change in trophic status of the bog. Branched GDGTs are abundant in an immature lignite (vitrinite reflectance, R-o 0. 25 %), but occur in low amount in a slightly more mature coal (R-o 0. 32 %). Annual MAT could be reconstructed for the lignite alone and is higher than other proxy-based estimates from approximately the same time and location. Our results indicate potential for the application of the MBT-CBT proxy in peat and immature coals, but improved constraints on the effects of different types of peat on branched GDGT distributions as well as improved calibration of MAT estimates are needed before the method can be confidently applied...|$|E
40|$|Peat {{molecular}} chemistry {{reflects a}} combination of plant input and decomposition. Both vegetation community {{and the degree of}} decomposition of plant remains are highly dependent on depth and fluctuation of the water table and thus peat organic matter (OM) chemistry reflects past hydrological conditions. Changes in hydrology according to the OM composition (by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, pyrolysis-GC/MS) in a high-resolution sampled monolith of an 8000 years old peat deposit are presented. Analysis of 18 modern vegetation species resulted in molecular markers for Erica spp., Deschampsia flexuosa, Juncus bulbosus and Carex binervis, in addition to more general markers which enabled differentiation between woody, grass and moss vegetation. Factor analysis of 106 pyrolysis products quantified for all peat samples enabled identification of mineral (Factor 1) and hydrological (Factor 2) conditions of the <b>bog.</b> Depth <b>profiles</b> of vegetation markers showed good agreement with those of the scores of both factors and enabled the identification of 14 relatively wet periods, dating to 1430 - 1865 AD, 930 - 1045 AD, 640 AD, 270 - 385 AD, 190 - 215 AD, 135 AD, 45 BC- 15 AD, 260 - 140 BC, 640 - 440 BC, 1055 - 960 BC, 1505 - 1260 BC, 2300 BC, 41902945 BC and 5700 - 5205 BC, which show excellent agreement with other palaeoclimatic studies in Europe.

Historical records of atmospheric anthropogenic As, Sb, and Pb deposition during the industrial and postindustrial periods were derived, site-specific maxima (up to 1. 55, 1. 33, and 45 mg m− 2 y− 1, respectively) occurring between the late 1890 s and 1960 s, reflecting emissions from diverse sources such as mining and smelting, coal combustion, and also, in the case of Pb, exhaust emissions from the use of leaded gasoline. Since the mid- 1980 s, fluxes of Pb decreased (4 − 7 fold) more rapidly than those of As and Sb (2 − 3 fold), attributable to both the gradual elimination of leaded gasoline and recent new sources of the latter elements. Relative trends in derived anthropogenic As, Sb, and Pb deposition largely agreed with other Scottish peat and moss archive records, direct measurements of deposition, and UK emissions, i. e., four different types of data source...|$|R
40|$|To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that long-term peat accumulation is related to contemporary carbon flux dynamics, we present the Peat Decomposition Model (PDM), {{a new model of}} long-term peat accumulation. Decomposition rates of the deeper peat are directly related to observable decomposition rates of fresh vegetation litter. Plant root effects (subsurface oxygenation and fresh litter inputs) are included. PDM considers two vegetation types, vascular and nonvascular, with different decomposition rates and aboveground and belowground litter input rates. We used PDM to investigate the sensitivities of peat accumulation in bogs and fens to productivity, root:shoot ratio, tissue decomposability, root and water table depths, and climate. Warmer and wetter conditions are more conducive to peat accumulation. Bogs are more sensitive than fens to climate conditions. Cooler and drier conditions lead to the lowest peat accumulation when productivity is more temperature sensitive than decomposition rates. We also compare peat age–depth profiles to field data. With a very general parameterization, PDM fen and <b>bog</b> age–depth <b>profiles</b> were similar to data from the the most recent 5000 years at three bog cores and a fen core in eastern Canada, but they overestimated accumulation at three other bog cores in that region. The model cannot reliably predict the amount of fen peat remaining from the first few millennia of a peatland 2 ̆ 7 s development. This discrepancy may relate to nonanalogue, early postglacial climatic and nutrient conditions for rich-fen peat accumulation and to the fate of this fen peat material, which is overlain by a bog as the peatland evolves, a common hydroseral succession in northern peatlands. Because PDM sensitivity tests point to these possible factors, we conclude that the static model represents a framework that shows a consistent relationship between contemporary productivity and fresh-tissue decomposition rates and observed long-term peat accumulation...|$|R

With the onset of the Holocene the PNPP increases strongly up to 150 g C m- 2 yr- 1 around ca. 10, 000 Cal. yr BP. This is followed by a decline to minimum values (30 to 40 g C m- 2 yr- 1) between 6500 and 4000 Cal. yr BP. Thereafter, the PNPP starts to increase again to reach its highest value (175 g C m- 2 yr- 1) around 1000 Cal. yr BP. The PNPP curve correlates well with the evolution of the atmospheric methane concentrations as derived from Greenland icecores. For example, minima in atmospheric methane reported during the Younger Dryas and around 5200 Cal. yr BP are coinciding with the lowest values of PNPP and the negative atmospheric methane peak at 8200 Cal. yr BP corresponds to a marked decrease in PNPP. Our PNPP curve suggests that the methane emissions from northern peatlands evolved similar to those of low latitude wetlands and together they largely determined the evolution of atmospheric methane throughout the Late-glacial and the Holocene.

40|$|Although {{several studies}} have used bogs in order to {{reconstruct}} paleoclimatic conditions and the historical trends of pollutants, scientific literature is still rather controversial {{about the role of}} ombrotrophic bogs as reliable record of past environmental changes. Consequently, understanding whether all vegetational and climatic “information” are effectively preserved in peat deposits during humification becomes an essential aspect to be tested before using bogs as natural archives. The present work focuses on stable isotopic ratios, i. e., 13 C/ 12 C (δ 13 C), 15 N/ 14 N (δ 15 N) and 18 O/ 16 O (δ 18 O), and {{is based on the assumption}} that, if bogs are consistent archives of environmental changes, these types of “information” should be recorded also into humic acids (HA), i. e. the fraction of peat more recalcitrant and refractory to degradation. Thus, an 81 -cm long peat core, covering the last 2000 years, was collected from the Etang de la Gruère bog (Jura Mountains, Switzerland), cut into 3 cm slices, and HA were isolated from each age dated layer. Stable isotopic ratios (δ 13 C, δ 15 N and δ 18 O) were then determined in bulk peat and corresponding HA samples. An increase in the humification degree and a decrease of the C/N ratio were observed along the profile. The δ 13 C of both peat and HA showed a significantly similar trend with depth (p= 0. 0001), and the same significant correlation was observed for the δ 15 N. Also the ratio between δ 13 C and δ 15 N closely resembled the C/N ratio observed in the peat and in HA (pb 0. 0001), thus underlining that the trend of these isotopic ratios is preserved along the studied <b>bog</b> <b>profile.</b> Consequently, our data seem to support both the role of HA as recalcitrant, stable molecules with a long-term residence time, and the potential of ombrotrophic bogs to be used as “archives” of vegetational changes occurring (at least) in the last 2000 years. Although a certain relationship between peat and corresponding HA was found also for δ 18 O, our data did not allow the solving of the issue of its reliability as paleoenvironmental proxy...|$|E
40|$|The peat and pore-water {{biogeochemistry}} of an Irish oceanic {{raised bog}} are reported {{with a view}} to understanding the origin and development of a minerotrophic soak contained within an ombrotrophic <b>bog.</b> Depth <b>profiles</b> of electrical conductivity, pore-water chemistry and peat chemistry were recorded from the mire surface down to a maximum depth of 10 m (approximately 1 m into the underlying mineral soil) from the centre of Lough Roe, a minerotrophic soak on Clara Bog in the Irish midlands, and from a location in the surrounding bog. Distinct differences in the hydrochemistry and peat chemistry between both sites are evident in the upper 5 m of the profile, indicating that conditions differed during the latter development of the mire, despite both sites being located on the apex of the raised bog dome. As expected, the profiles recorded from the ombrotrophic bog are characterised by low ionic concentrations in the upper bog peat with an increase in the concentration of calcium and other ions in the lower fen peat (from 5. 5 m depth). At the Lough Roe site, the profile shows relatively high concentrations of calcium and other ions in {{the upper part of the}} profile. To our knowledge, this is the first report of such detailed minerotrophic chemical profiles from the central area of a raised bog dome. We hypothesize that the relevant minerals originate from the underlying clay layer and fen peat within the basin of the bog and the minerals prevailed within the soak because of (1) the generation of a flow of water from the developing bog through the minerotrophic fen peat towards the soak during its early development, and (2) increased rates of decomposition within the soak throughout its existence.

40|$|Palynological data {{collected}} {{over a period}} of 60 years have been compiled and re-interpreted in order to reveal the deforestation patterns and heath establishment in the southwestern Norwegian coastal heathland.

The palynological sites represent different sizes of catchments reflecting both local, extra-local and regional pollen source areas. They are represented by ancient monuments, soil <b>profiles,</b> <b>bogs</b> and lakes. The palynological signals of deforestation and heathland establishment can be described by different models indicating an abrupt, gradual or stepwise deforestation.

The deforestation seems to have been metachronous, leading to a regional mosaic pattern of different vegetation types. The process spanned more than 3600 years, from 4000 cal BC to 400 cal BC, with three pronounced clearance periods: 4000 – 3600 cal BC (Mesolithic/ Early Neolithic transition), 2500 – 2200 cal BC (Middle Neolithic II/ Early Late Neolithic transition), and 1900 – 1400 cal BC (Late Neolithic to Bronze Age period II). The development of heathland in the outer coastal area that followed deforestation has also been metachronous and took place {{over a period of}} approximately 4000 years from 4000 cal BC to 200 cal BC, but was mainly completed during the Bronze Age. Regional differences in the deforestation pattern and heathland establishment are discussed with respect to chronology. The progression of the deforestation can best be explained by the interaction of human manipulation, topography and edaphic conditions. Climatic variations seem to be of less importance...|$|R
40|$|Human {{activity}} has affected metal emissions {{to the atmosphere}} {{on a global scale}} for several thousand years, resulting in widespread contamination of the environment with toxic heavy metals such as Pb and Hg, thereby threatening both human and environmental health. In recent years ombrotrophic peat bogs have been used to study the changing rates and sources of atmospheric metal deposition, as they receive all their water and nutrients from the atmosphere by dry and wet deposition alone. Cores from such bogs have proved especially useful as archives of atmospheric Pb deposition as Pb is essentially immobile in ombrotrophic peat. The work described in this thesis is primarily concerned with the use of ombrotrophic peat bogs to investigate environmental contamination in Scotland during pre-industrial, industrial and post-industrial (i. e. ca. post- 1970 A. D.) times. Cores were collected from ombrotrophic peat bogs at four different geographical locations (Carsegowan Moss, SW; Flanders Moss, W Central; The Red Moss of Balerno, E Central; Turclossie Moss, NE) in Scotland. Air-dried peat samples were dry-ashed and dissolved using microwave-assisted HF IHN 03 digestion. Elemental concentrations (e. g. AI, As, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Ni, P, Pb, S, Sb, Sc, Se, Ti, V, Y, Zn and Zr) and Pb isotope ratios (e. g. 206 PbP 07 Pb) were determined using ICP-OES and ICP-MS as appropriate. For Hg determination, samples were digested with HN 03 /H 2 S 04 and then analysed by CV AAS. Certified reference materials (e. g. Ombrotrophic Peat (NIMT/UOE/FM 001), Canadian Peat (1878 P), Bush Branches and Leaves (DC 73349), Peach Leaves (GBW 08501) and Coal (BCR CRM No. 40 and NBS SRM 1635) were used for quality control purposes. The distribution and behaviour of the potentially toxic trace elements (As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Sb, Se, V and Zn) and of major elements (Ca, Fe, Mg, Mn, P and S) within the four ombrotrophic peat bogs was investigated and there was strong evidence that Ca, Fe, Mg, Mn, P, S, Se and Zn were mobile in ombrotrophic peat, while As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg (at least during industrial and post-industrial periods), Ni, Sb and V, like Pb, were essentially immobile in ombrotrophic peat. Deposition records of conservative lithogenic elements (e. g. concentrations of AI, Sc, Ti, Y and Zr) that occur predominantly in soil dust were also investigated and the chosen conservative elements Sc, Ti and Zr were used in calculations to estimate anthropogenic enrichments of As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Sb and V in peat <b>bog</b> <b>profiles.</b> 210 Pb- and 14 C- dated peat cores were used to reconstruct historical records of atmospheric anthropogenic As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Sb and V deposition (since the pre-Roman (i. e. to ca. 380 B. C.) /Roman period) and atmospheric Hg deposition (since the onset of the industrial period) across Scotland. For Pb, on the basis of Pb isotopic composition (e. g. 206 PbP Pb), clear indications of contamination during the preRoman/Roman and Mediaeval periods were attributed to the mining and smelting of Pb ores (from Britain and elsewhere in Europe). During the industrial and post-industrial periods, variations in the relative importance of contributions of anthropogenic Pb from different sources were apparent. From ca. the early 17 th century A. D. at three of the peat bog sites, the mining and smelting of indigenous Scottish Pb ores, until the early 20 th century A. D., were found {{to be the most important}} sources of anthropogenic Pb deposition. In contrast, at the most southerly site (Carsegowan Moss), influences from the use of both British Ph ores and imported Australian Ph ores (in more southern parts of Britain) since the late 19 th century A. D. were evident. At each of the sites, the increasing importance of Australian-Ph-influenced car-exhaust emissions from the 1930 s to late 1990 s A. D., along with significant contributions from coal combustion (until the late 1960 s A. D.) was evident. For Sb, in general, similarities between the major trends in the concentration profiles of anthropogenic Sb and Ph suggested common sources of these two elements. Perturbations in the anthropogenic Sb/Pb ratios since ca. 1800 A. D., however, were attributed to temporal variations in the relative importance of atmospheric emissions from different sources such as Ph ore mining/smelting, coal combustion and, in recent decades, automobile-related use of compounds of Ph (in leaded petrol) and of Sb (in brake linings). For Hg, in general, during the industrial and post-industrial periods, coal combustion and waste incineration, respectively, were likely to be the most important sources of Hg. For As, clear indications of contamination during the Mediaeval period were probably attributable to the mining and smelting of Ph and Cu ores, and for As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni and V, during the industrial and post-industrial periods, a variety of sources (e. g. metallurgical activities, coal and oil combustion, use of phosphate fertilisers and waste incineration) were important to varying extents. Also, in recent years, atmospheric Cu emissions from automobile-related use of compounds of Cu (in motor oil, brake linings and tyres) may have been important. Inter-site and inter-elemental comparison of records of atmospheric metal deposition across Scotland indicated that, in general, atmospheric As, Cr, Hg, Ph and Sb deposition was greatest during the industrial period (between the late 1880 s and late 1960 s A. D.) and atmospheric Cd, Co, Cu, Ni and V deposition was greatest during the industrial and post-industrial periods (between ca. 1900 and the early 2000 s A. D.), although increases in As, Co, Cr, Hg, Ph and Sb deposition were earliest (during the late 19 th and early 20 th century A. D.) at the most southerly site (Carsegowan Moss). During the industrial and post-industrial periods, levels of As, Ph and Cd contamination were generally highest in the south of Scotland, Cu, Co and Sb in south and central Scotland, and Cr, Ni and V in central Scotland. Overall, the existence of a south to north As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Ph, Sb and V pollution gradient in Scotland was evident...|$|R
40|$|Lead has a {{more than}} three-millennia-long {{pollution}} history in Europe. Metal production, burning of coal and use of leaded petrol resulted in a significant pollution of the atmosphere. As a consequence of atmospheric fallout, the Swedish boreal forest is strongly contaminated by airborne lead pollution. High levels of lead in the soil and soil pore water are of concern because the soil fauna, plants and aquatic biota may respond negatively to this toxic element. The fate of the accumulated pool of pollution in the soil is not well known. In this thesis, I determine four variables of importance for increasing our knowledge about the past, present and future lead levels in the boreal forest soil: 1) the pre-pollution atmospheric deposition rate of lead; 2) the upward flux of lead from deeper soil layers to near-surface horizons {{as a result of}} plant uptake; 3) the mean residence time of lead in the mor layer (the organic horizon at the surface of forest soils); and 4) the vertical and lateral transport of pollution lead within the mineral soil and to streams. Lead concentration measurements and stable lead isotope analyses were used for distinguishing pollution lead from natural lead in cores from ombrotrophic <b>bogs,</b> forest soil <b>profiles,</b> forest mosses, soil-water and stream-water samples. The results clearly stress that the boreal forest ecosystem is totally dominated by pollution lead. This is proved by low 206 Pb/ 207 Pb ratios (mainly between 1. 14 and 1. 20) in the mor layer, forest plants and stream water, while the local geogenic lead of the mineral soil (C-horizon) has high ratios (> 1. 30). The dominance of pollution in the mor layer is caused by high deposition rates of airborne lead pollution, minute transport rates of lead from the mineral soil by forest plants (about 0. 02 mg lead m- 2 year- 1) and a long mean residence time of the deposited lead (~ 250 years for mature forest). In the pristine pre-pollution environment, lead was a rare element due to low atmospheric deposition rates (0. 001 to 0. 01 mg m- 2 year- 1). It is estimated that the present lead inventory in the mor layer is up to 100 times higher than in the pristine environment where ≤ 8 mg m- 2 was present in the mor. The levels in this biologically important horizon will decrease at a very slow rate and it will take centuries for the deeper part of the mor layer to fully respond to decreasing atmospheric inputs. In a hypothetic scenario with a ceased atmospheric lead deposition, the pool of pollution lead will ultimately be redistributed to deeper water-saturated soil layers from where a lateral transport to surface waters occurs. In the studied catchment, the export of pollution lead from the soil to the stream is estimated to peak slightly about one thousand years from now...|$|R
