25|$|<b>Bottle</b> <b>caps,</b> or closures, {{are used}} to seal the {{openings}} of bottles of many types.

500|$|The {{black vulture}} lays its eggs {{on the ground}} in a wooded area, a hollow log, or some other cavity, seldom more than [...] above the ground. While it {{generally}} does not use any nesting materials, it may decorate the area around the nest with bits of brightly colored plastic, shards of glass, or metal items such as <b>bottle</b> <b>caps.</b> Clutch size is generally two eggs, though this can vary from one to three. The egg is oval and on average measures [...] The smooth, gray-green, bluish, or white shell is variably blotched or spotted with lavender or pale brown around the larger end. Both parents incubate the eggs, which hatch after 28 to 41 days. Upon hatching, the young are covered with white down. Both parents feed the nestlings, regurgitating food at the nest site. The young remain in the nest for two months, and after 75 to 80 days they are able to fly skillfully. Predation of black vultures is relatively unlikely, though eggs and nestlings are readily eaten if found by mammalian predators such as raccoons, coatis and foxes. Due to its aggressiveness and size, few predators can threaten the fully-grown vulture. However, various eagles may kill vultures in conflicts and even the ornate hawk-eagle, a slightly smaller bird than the vulture, have preyed on adult black vultures.|$|E
