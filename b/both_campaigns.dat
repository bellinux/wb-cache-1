5|$|In 1973, Beshear {{began his}} {{political}} career by being elected to represent the 76th District (Fayette County) in the Kentucky House of Representatives. During his first term, his colleagues named him the most outstanding freshman legislator. He was re-elected in 1975 and 1977; <b>both</b> <b>campaigns</b> featured close Democratic primaries between Beshear and Jerry Lundergan.|$|E
5|$|During the war 334 {{men from}} the {{regiment}} died from all causes. In the seven months of the Gallipoli Campaign they had 127 dead; fourteen of those died of illness and 113 were killed in action. Another forty-six, not included in that total, were reported missing believed dead. The {{two years of the}} Sinai and Palestine Campaign accounted for another 127 dead. At the same time 466 men were debilitated or wounded in action at Gallipoli, and another 254 were wounded during the later campaign, a total of 720 wounded for <b>both</b> <b>campaigns.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 280 BC, Pyrrhus {{embarked}} on a campaign in Magna Graecia (i.e. southern Italy) against the Roman Republic known as the Pyrrhic War, followed by his invasion of Sicily. Ptolemy Keraunos secured {{his position on the}} Macedonian throne by giving Pyrrhus five thousand soldiers and twenty war elephants for this endeavor. Pyrrhus returned to Epirus in 275BC after the ultimate failure of <b>both</b> <b>campaigns,</b> which contributed to the rise of Rome because Greek cities in southern Italy such as Tarentum now became Roman allies. Pyrrhus invaded Macedonia in 274BC, defeating the largely mercenary army of AntigonusII at the 274BC Battle of Aous and driving him out of Macedonia, forcing him to seek refuge with his naval fleet in the Aegean.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 280 BC, Pyrrhus {{embarked}} on a campaign in Magna Graecia (i.e. southern Italy) against the Roman Republic known as the Pyrrhic War, followed by his invasion of Sicily. Ptolemy Keraunos had secured {{his position on the}} Macedonian throne by gifting Pyrrhus five-thousand soldiers and twenty war elephants for this endeavor. Pyrrhus returned to Epirus in 275 BC after the stalemate and ultimate failure of <b>both</b> <b>campaigns,</b> which contributed to the rise of Rome now that Greek cities in southern Italy such as Tarentum became Roman allies. Despite having a depleted treasury, Pyrrhus decided to invade Macedonia in 274 BC, due to the perceived political instability of Antigonus II's regime. After defeating the largely mercenary army of Antigonus II at the 274 BC Battle of Aous, Pyrrhus was able to drive him out of Macedonia and force him to take refuge with his naval fleet.|$|E
5|$|Conquering {{the peoples}} of the Alps in 16BC was another {{important}} victory for Rome, since it provided a large territorial buffer between the Roman citizens of Italy and Rome's enemies in Germania to the north. Horace dedicated an ode to the victory, while the monument Trophy of Augustus near Monaco was built to honor the occasion. The capture of the Alpine region also served the next offensive in 12BC, when Tiberius began the offensive against the Pannonian tribes of Illyricum, and his brother Nero Claudius Drusus moved against the Germanic tribes of the eastern Rhineland. <b>Both</b> <b>campaigns</b> were successful, as Drusus' forces reached the Elbe River by 9BC—though he died shortly after by falling off his horse. It was recorded that the pious Tiberius walked in front of his brother's body {{all the way back to}} Rome.|$|E
5|$|Portal 2 is a first-person {{perspective}} puzzle game. The Player {{takes the}} role of Chell in the single-player campaign, as one of two robotsAtlas and P-Bodyin the cooperative campaign, or as a simplistic humanoid icon in community-developed puzzles. These four characters can explore and interact with the environment. Characters can withstand limited damage but will die after sustained injury. There is no penalty for falling onto a solid surface, but falling into bottomless pits or toxic pools kills the player character immediately. When Chell dies in the single-player game, the game restarts from a recent checkpoint; in the cooperative game, the robot respawns shortly afterwards without restarting the puzzle. The goal of <b>both</b> <b>campaigns</b> is to explore the Aperture Science Laboratory—a complicated, malleable mechanized maze. While most of the game takes place in modular test chambers with clearly defined entrances and exits, other parts occur in behind-the-scenes areas where the objective is less clear.|$|E
50|$|Dil Na'od is {{recorded}} as <b>both</b> <b>campaigning</b> in the Ethiopian highlands south of Axum, and sending missionaries into that region. With Abuna Salama I, {{he helped to}} build the church of Debre Igziabher overlooking Lake Hayq.|$|R
50|$|At the {{parliamentary}} election in 1993 {{it was impossible}} to present a credible non-socialist government alternative because Høyres former coalition parties, The Christian Democrats and the Centre Party <b>both</b> <b>campaigned</b> strongly against Norwegian membership in the EU.|$|R
25|$|Signalling the {{closeness}} of the race, both candidates received late-season campaign support from national political figures. In early November, former President Bill Clinton stumped for McNerney; President George W. Bush and First Lady Laura Bush <b>both</b> <b>campaigned</b> for Pombo in the last month before the election.|$|R
5|$|Set in {{the regions}} of {{northern}} Middle-earth, the game focuses on {{the events of the}} War in the North. For the sake of gameplay, the game takes several liberties with Tolkien's works and the film trilogy. Some characters were altered in their appearances, abilities, and roles; for instance, a combat role in the game is given to Tom Bombadil, a merry and mysterious hermit who appears in The Lord of the Rings but does not take part in the war. In addition, Tolkien's earlier novel The Hobbit lends several elements to the game, including characters such as the Giant Spiders from Mirkwood. The story for The Battle for Middle-earth II is divided into Good and Evil Campaigns. <b>Both</b> <b>campaigns</b> focus on the battles fought by the newly introduced factions: the Elves, Dwarves, and Goblins. The player goes through nine fixed missions in either easy, medium, or hard difficulty mode. Narrated cut scenes provide plot exposition between missions.|$|E
5|$|Sonic Adventure 2 is a 3D {{game with}} six playable {{character}}s, {{divided into two}} campaigns: Hero (with Sonic, Tails and Knuckles the Echidna, where the player battles to save the world) and Dark (with Shadow the Hedgehog, Doctor Eggman and Rouge the Bat, where they battle to conquer it). Each character on each side has a playing style similar to the other characters on the side. The player moves through the Hero and Dark campaigns, switching between them at will. Each campaign cycles through levels of its three characters, telling different sides of the story. Levels {{have a variety of}} themes (such as cities, jungles, desert pyramids and outer space), with some followed by boss fights. The two campaigns' stories occur in parallel; completing <b>both</b> <b>campaigns</b> unlocks a Last Story with all six characters, culminating in a final boss fight.|$|E
25|$|Jackson ran for {{president}} twice, and <b>both</b> <b>campaigns</b> were noted for the hostile reception they received from the left wing of the Democratic Party. Jackson's one-on-one campaigning skills, which were so successful in Washington State, did not translate as well on the national stage. Even his supporters admitted that he suffered from a certain lack of charisma.|$|E
50|$|The National Anti-Sweating League is {{the name}} adopted by two groups of social reformers in Australia and Britain {{at the turn of}} the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. <b>Both</b> <b>campaigned</b> against the poor {{conditions}} endured by many workers in so-called sweatshops and called for a minimum wage.|$|R

50|$|In 2013, in France, he {{documented}} {{the presidency of}} François Hollande for Le Monde. For Elle, he provided coverage of the political campaign race to conquer the Paris city hall {{for the first time}} between two women: Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet and Anne Hidalgo who <b>both</b> <b>campaigned</b> to become Mayor of Paris.|$|R
25|$|Congress {{appointed}} an investigating committee {{during its}} 1877 session. This panel, chaired by Democratic Congressman Clarkson Nott Potter of New York, investigated allegations {{of fraud and}} corruption in the three contested states. Rather than produce conclusive evidence of Republican malfeasance, as Tilden's supporters hoped, the committee exonerated Tilden of wrongdoing, but uncovered conflicting evidence that showed state election officials of both parties and members of <b>both</b> <b>campaigns</b> in an unfavorable light.|$|E
25|$|The {{forceful}} {{expulsion of}} Christians of western Anatolia, especially Ottoman Greeks, has many similarities with policy towards the Armenians, as observed by US ambassador Henry Morgenthau and historian Arnold Toynbee. Certain Ottoman officials, such as Şükrü Kaya, Nazım Bey and Mehmed Reshid, {{played a role}} in both, Special Organization units and labour battalions were involved in <b>both</b> <b>campaigns</b> and a dual plan combining unofficial violence and the cover of state population policy was in implementation in both cases.|$|E
25|$|Polling {{throughout}} the primary campaign consistently showed Dean either in first place, or second behind Dick Gephardt. However, last minute surges by rivals John Kerry and John Edwards {{as well as}} negative campaigning between the Dean and Gephardt campaigns resulted in an 11th hour slump for <b>both</b> <b>campaigns.</b> In a poll released by the Des Moines Register just before Caucus Day, Dean registered in third place with 20%, behind Kerry with 26%, and Edwards with 23%, but ahead of Dick Gephardt with 18%.|$|E
50|$|Hugh Carey, who was {{to become}} governor, and Ed Koch, {{who was to}} become mayor, <b>both</b> <b>campaigned</b> against the plan saying {{that it would be}} a waste of {{government}} funds and would be a windfall for private developers. After the two were elected, they both reversed their position and supported the plan.|$|R
50|$|Boundary changes which {{reduced the}} number of seats by 1, meant both the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats needed 1 less seat {{to take control of the}} council. With the {{election}} important to both parties, the Conservative party chairman and local MP Theresa May and the Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy <b>both</b> <b>campaigned</b> in the area.|$|R
25|$|Kennedy, {{like his}} brother before him, planned {{to win the}} {{nomination}} through popular support in the primaries. McCarthy and Kennedy squared off in California, each knowing that the state would make or break them. They <b>both</b> <b>campaigned</b> vigorously up and down the state, with many polls showing them neck-and-neck, and a few even predicting a McCarthy victory.|$|R
25|$|In 2004, Bowles {{campaign}}ed {{again for}} the Senate, seeking to fill the seat being vacated by fellow Democrat John Edwards. He faced Republican Richard Burr and Libertarian Tom Bailey in a hotly contested race. The final month of the Senate campaign saw both Bowles's and Burr's campaigns turn strongly negative, with Burr's campaign attacking Bowles's associations with the Clinton administration, while Bowles's campaign attacked Burr on his support of trade legislation and special interest donations. <b>Both</b> <b>campaigns</b> {{spent a great deal}} of money, making it one of the most expensive statewide races in North Carolina history.|$|E
25|$|Toungoo went on {{to conquer}} all of Lower Burma by 1541, gaining {{complete}} control of Lower Burma's manpower, access to Portuguese firearms and maritime wealth to pay for them. And Tabinshwehti would quickly exploit these new found assets for further expansions. By incorporating Portuguese mercenaries, firearms and military tactics as well as experienced former Hanthawaddy military commanders to the Toungoo armed forces, the upstart kingdom seized up to Pagan (Bagan) from the Confederation by 1545. The campaigns against Arakan (1545–47) and Siam (1547–49), however, fell short. In <b>both</b> <b>campaigns,</b> Toungoo forces won all major open battles but could not overcome the heavily fortified defences of Mrauk-U and Ayutthaya.|$|E
25|$|In the War of the Ring campaign, {{containing}} eight levels, {{the player}} loosely follows the major {{battles of the}} films with some additions such as the Mines of Moria and Minas Morgul. In the Rise of Sauron campaign, the player controls the forces of Sauron in a reworking of the storyline set over seven levels of a film called The final war for Middle Earth. In this story, the Dark Lord reclaims the ring when Frodo Baggins was corrupted by and failed to destroy the One Ring. The hobbit is then killed by the Witchking of Angmar, leading to Sauron subsequently conquering Middle Earth. <b>Both</b> <b>campaigns</b> are narrated by Hugo Weaving, who played Elrond in Peter Jackson's film trilogy.|$|E

50|$|Results {{indicated}} that PPP and PML(N) secured the largest popularity {{votes in the}} elections- <b>both</b> <b>campaigned</b> on targeting Musharraf and had been politically active against Musharraf since 2003. The PML(Q) of Musharraf eminently faced the defeat, including 22 higher officials of the PML(Q) who were the cabinet ministers which constituted a bulk of the previous federal cabinet.|$|R
50|$|In 2003, Grimes ran as a {{municipal}} councillor in Ward 6 Etobicoke-Lakeshore to replace Irene Jones {{who left the}} seat {{to run in the}} provincial election. He was one of nine candidates to run for the seat. During the campaign he and his closest rival Berardo Mascioli, accused each other of dirty tricks during the election <b>campaign.</b> <b>Both</b> camps complained that the other one was removing or vandalizing election signs. On election night phone lines to <b>both</b> <b>campaign</b> offices were cut. Grimes won the election by 1,352 votes.|$|R
25|$|Virginia was won by Democratic nominee Barack Obama by a 6.3% {{margin of}} victory. Prior to the election, all 17 news {{organizations}} considered this a state Obama would win, or otherwise {{considered as a}} blue state, {{despite the fact that}} initially Virginia was a swing state that <b>both</b> <b>campaigns</b> targeted heavily in 2008 and that Virginia {{had been one of the}} most reliable red states in the nation since 1952. The financial meltdown, the changing demographics, and the population increases in voter rich Northern Virginia gave Obama the edge as he was projected the winner in the Old Dominion State. It was the first time in over 40 years that Virginia voted for a Democratic presidential nominee since Lyndon B. Johnson's victory in 1964.|$|E
25|$|The duo's later {{campaigns against}} Arakan (1545–1547) and Siam (1547–1549) however fell short. In <b>both</b> <b>campaigns,</b> Toungoo forces won all major open battles, {{and went on}} to lay siege to the capitals, Mrauk-U and Ayutthaya respectively. But they still had no answer to heavily {{fortified}} defenses equipped with Portuguese firearms, and had to retreat both times. Toungoo's own Portuguese supplied cannon had little impact on the walls of both capitals. Nor did they have enough manpower (19,000 and 12,000 troops respectively in Arakanese and Siamese campaigns) for long-term sieges. Nonetheless, despite the setbacks, Tabinshwehti and Bayinnaung by 1549 had built up the largest polity in Burma since the fall of Pagan Empire in 1287, stretching from Pagan in the north to Tavoy in the south.|$|E
25|$|Paul Wild {{became one}} of the young radar {{officers}} who ensured the Royal Navy used its new technology to maximum effect. In July 1943, commissioned as a Probationary Temporary Acting Sub-lieutenant (Special Branch, Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve), he started an intensive, six-month radar officer training course at the Royal Navy base, Portsmouth. His seagoing appointment for the following two and a half years, with 60 subordinates and 24 radar sets, was the battleship , which eventually became flagship of the British Pacific Fleet. The ship took part in the Okinawa campaign, followed by the assault on the Japanese mainland. In <b>both</b> <b>campaigns</b> the fleet was frequently attacked by Japanese suicide bombers, but because they tended to concentrate on aircraft carriers, his ship was not hit. The battleship entered Tokyo Bay just after the surrender of Japan and he was present when the peace treaty was signed.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{support among}} Independents {{and even some}} Democrats, Shays faced a {{significant}} obstacles in the primary trailing in <b>both</b> <b>campaign</b> funds and poll results. Vastly outspent by more than $60 million, McMahon defeated Shays by a three-to-one margin in the primary. She faced Democratic Representative Chris Murphy {{in the general election}} and lost, marking her second consecutive defeat in two years.|$|R
50|$|Amongst the {{national}} newspapers, The Herald, Daily Record, The Times and Scottish Daily Mail reckoned that Darling won, while The Scotsman and The Scottish Sun considered the debate a draw. A readers' poll for the Edinburgh Evening News found 37% {{in favour of}} Salmond, 38% thought Darling had won and 24% considered it a tie. <b>Both</b> <b>campaign</b> groups claimed victory.|$|R
50|$|Polk and Richard Mentor Johnson had <b>both</b> <b>campaigned</b> for {{the vice}} {{presidency}} prior to the convention, but with Polk's nomination, the party looked elsewhere for a running mate. The anti-annexationist Silas Wright, US Senator from New York, was offered the nomination for Polk's vice-presidential running mate. Wright declined on principle, and the convention settled on George M. Dallas, a conservative from Pennsylvania.|$|R
