5|$|The Safdarjung tomb, {{the last}} monumental tomb {{garden of the}} Mughals, was planned and <b>built</b> <b>like</b> an {{enclosed}} garden tomb {{in line with the}} style of the Humayun tomb. It was completed in 1754. The slabs from the tomb of Abdul Rahim Khankhana were used {{in the construction of the}} tomb.|$|E
5|$|The monastery, <b>built</b> <b>like</b> a large mansion, is triple storied {{with a large}} {{assembly}} hall, ten other functional {{structures and}} with 65 residential quarters for students, Lamas and monks. The monastery has a school and its own water supply facility, and a centre for Buddhist cultural studies.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{dominance}} of the Gelug sect of Buddhism in Tawang, the Nyingmapa or the Black Hat sect of Buddhism was dominant and this resulted in their hegemony and even hostile approach towards the founder, Merek Lama. This problem was compounded by the Drukpas of Bhutan, who also belonged to the Nyingmapa sect, who even tried to invade and take control of Tawang. Hence, when the Tawang monastery was <b>built</b> <b>like</b> a fort structure, a strategic location was chosen from the defense point of view.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time Japan's 10th Army was {{storming}} Yuhuatai, a rugged plateau situated {{directly in front of}} Zhonghua Gate on Nanking's southern side. The 10th Army's progress was slow and casualties were heavy as Yuhuatai was <b>built</b> <b>like</b> a fortress of interlocking pillboxes and trenches manned by three Chinese divisions, including the German-trained 88th Division, though the Chinese were also apt to counterattack and some Japanese units were forced to spend more time defending than attacking. Close to every single man that the 88th Division had deployed on Yuhuatai was killed in action, including three of its four regimental commanders and both of its brigade commanders, but in the process the Japanese were made to suffer 2,240 casualties including 566 dead. Yuhuatai was finally overrun at noon on December 12.|$|E
5|$|El Toro {{has several}} {{similarities}} to Viper, the coaster that it replaced. The most obvious similarity is that El Toro uses Viper's station, {{the only part}} of Viper that was not torn down. The station previously held two Viper trains at once, with a loading platform in the front and an unloading platform in the rear. The ramp that was previously Viper's main exit is now used only for wheelchair access, as El Toro has a new exit {{on the other side of}} the station. During El Toro's construction, the station was gutted and an entirely new platform <b>built.</b> <b>Like</b> El Toro, Viper turned left out of the station before the lift hill and turned left at the top of the lift before the first drop.|$|E
5|$|Valuable {{clues about}} Han {{architecture}} {{can be found}} in Han artwork of ceramic models, paintings, and carved or stamped bricks discovered in tombs and other sites. The layout of Han tombs were also <b>built</b> <b>like</b> underground houses, comparable to the scenes of courtyard houses found on tomb bricks and in three-dimensional models. Han homes had a courtyard area (and some had multiple courtyards) with halls that were slightly elevated above it and connected by stairways. Multi-story buildings included the main colonnaded residence halls built around the courtyards as well as watchtowers. The halls were built with intersecting crossbeams and rafters that were usually carved with decorations; stairways and walls were usually plastered over to produce a smooth surface and then painted.|$|E

25|$|Another {{approach}} was {{the addition of}} two sets of slides for {{different parts of the}} range. Some euphoniums and tubas were <b>built</b> <b>like</b> this, but today, this approach has become highly exotic for all instruments except horns, where it is the norm, usually in a double, sometimes even triple configuration.|$|E
25|$|Kankanaey {{houses are}} <b>built</b> <b>like</b> the other Igorot houses, which reflect their social status.

25|$|Years later, Mantell had {{acquired}} enough fossil {{evidence to show}} that the dinosaur's forelimbs were much shorter than its hind legs, therefore proving they were not <b>built</b> <b>like</b> a mammal as claimed by Sir Richard Owen. Mantell went on to demonstrate that fossil vertebrae, which Owen had attributed to a variety of different species, all belonged to Iguanodon. He also named a new genus of dinosaur called Hylaeosaurus and as a result became an authority on prehistoric reptiles.|$|E

25|$|The most {{frequent}} dam types were earth- or rock-filled embankment dams and masonry gravity dams. These served {{a wide array}} of purposes, such as irrigation, flood control, river diversion, soil-retention, or a combination of these functions. The impermeability of Roman dams was increased by the introduction of waterproof hydraulic mortar and especially opus caementicium in the Concrete Revolution. These materials also allowed for bigger structures to be <b>built,</b> <b>like</b> the Lake Homs Dam, possibly the largest water barrier today, and the sturdy Harbaqa Dam, both of which consist of a concrete core.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{compensated}} instruments {{tended to}} sound stuffy and blow less freely {{due to the}} air being doubled back through the main valves. In early designs, this led to sharp bends in the tubing and other obstructions of the air-flow. Some manufacturers therefore preferred adding more ‘straight’ valves instead, which for example could be pitched a little lower than the 2nd and 1st valves and were intended to be used instead of these in the respective valve combinations. While no longer featured in euphoniums for decades, many professional tubas are still <b>built</b> <b>like</b> this, with five valves being common on CC- and BB-tubas and five or six valves on F-tubas.|$|E
25|$|Schweitzer's wife, Helene Schweitzer, was an {{anaesthetist}} for surgical operations. After briefly {{occupying a}} shed formerly {{used as a}} chicken hut, in autumn 1913 they built their first hospital of corrugated iron, with two 13-foot rooms (consulting room and operating theatre) and with a dispensary and sterilising room in spaces below the broad eaves. The waiting room and dormitory (42 by 20 feet) were <b>built,</b> <b>like</b> native huts, of unhewn logs along a 30-yard path leading from the hospital to the landing-place. The Schweitzers had their own bungalow and employed as their assistant Joseph, a French-speaking Galoa (Mpongwe) who first came as a patient.|$|E

25|$|Like most early tanks, the Schneider was <b>built</b> <b>like</b> {{a simple}} {{armoured}} box, without compartmentalisation {{of the inner}} space. It lacked a turret, with the main armament, a short 75mm cannon, in a sponson on the right side. By later standards it would therefore have been an assault gun instead of a tank. The vehicle was considered a very imperfect design, because of a poor layout, insufficient fire-power, a cramped interior and inferior mobility due to an overhanging nose section, which had been designed to crush through the belts of barbed wire but in practice caused the tank to get stuck. Improved designs were almost immediately initiated but the production of these, the Schneider CA 2, CA 3 and CA 4, was eventually cancelled.|$|E
25|$|The urban {{expansion}} {{has seen a}} structured development plan for 2027. The buildings {{will continue to be}} built to retain ancient Bhutanese culture and architectural styles but with a measured and modulated blend of modern development, meeting requirements of national and civic administration and all basic civic amenities such as roads, water supply and drainage, hospitals, schools and colleges, electricity, media centres and so forth. The monuments or buildings of note are the sprawling Tashichho Dzong, <b>built</b> <b>like</b> a fortress, which is the centre of Bhutanese administration as well as monastic centre, the Memorial Chorten, Thimphu and the National Assembly of the newly formed parliamentary democracy within the Monarchic rule. The Palace of the King located {{to the north of the}} city, called the Dechencholing Palace, the official residence of the King, is an impressive structure that provides a grand aerial view of the city.|$|E
25|$|It {{required}} 6 {{years to}} complete the first post-war metro line (a 6.4km section of the Ring Line). These stations were dedicated to Victory. No more Comintern (Comintern metro station was renamed Kalininskaya in December 1946), no more World revolution, but a statement of victorious, nationalist Stalinism. Oktyabrskaya station by Leonid Polyakov was <b>built</b> <b>like</b> a Classicist temple, with a shiny white-blue altar behind iron gates – a complete departure from prewar atheism. To see this altar, a rider had to pass a long row of plaster banners, bronze candlesticks and assorted military imagery. Park Kultury (2) featured true Gothic chandelliers, another departure. Metrostroy operated its own marble and carpentry factories, producing 150 solid, whole block marble columns for this short section. The second section of Ring line was a tribute to Heroic Labor (with the exception of Shchusev's Komsomolskaya, set up as a retelling of Stalin's speech of November 7, 1941).|$|E
