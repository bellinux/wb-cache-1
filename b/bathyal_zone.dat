The phylogenetic relationship of octacnemids is open to argument because of its extraordinary morphological features due to habitat adaptation, e. g., a pharynx lacking ciliated stigmata. Aggregations of M. hians were discovered by the manned submersible Shinkai 2000 in the bathyal seafloor of Toyama Bay, Japan Sea, in 2000; this was the first in situ observation of M. hians in the Japanese coastal waters. In 2001, a total of 36 M. hians specimens were collected from the bay (592 〜 978 m deep). In situ observation indicated that M. hians usually opens its large oral apertures to engulf the drifting food particles in the water current. Microscopical observation of the gut contents also showed that M. hians is a non selective macrophagous feeding on small crustaceans, diatoms, detritus, and so on. Along with the position of the intestinal loop and gonad, the morphological characteristics of the tunic (integument of ascidians) suggest that M. hians is closely related to Cionidae and/or Corellidae.

40|$|Measuring and {{understanding}} patterns of ?-diversity remain major challenges in community ecology. Recently, ?-diversity {{has been shown}} to consist of 2 distinct components: (1) spatial turnover and (2) species loss leading to nestedness. Both components structure deep-sea macrofaunal assemblages but vary in importance among taxa and ocean basins and with energy availability. Here, we present the first evidence for turnover and nestedness along a bathymetric gradient in 2 major megafaunal taxa, holothurians and asteroids. Turnover is the dominant component of ?-diversity throughout <b>bathyal</b> and abyssal <b>zones</b> in both taxa, despite major differences in ?-diversity and trophic composition. High spatial turnover suggests a role for evolutionary adaptation to environmental circumstances within depth bands.

40|$|Abstract: The deep-water fauna of the Mediterranean is {{characterized}} by an absence of distinctive characteristics and by a relative impoverishment. Both {{are a result of}} events after the Messinian salinity crisis (Late Miocene). The three main classes of phenomena involved in producing or recording these effects are analysed and discussed:- Historical: Sequential faunal changes during the Pliocene and thereafter in particular those during the Quaternary glaciations and still in progress. - Bathymetric: Changes in the vertical aspects of the <b>Bathyal</b> and Abyssal <b>zones</b> that took place under peculiar conditions, i. e. homothermy, a relative oligotrophy, the barrier of the Gibraltar sill, and water mass movement. The deeper the habitat of a species in the Mediterranean, the more extensive is its distribution elsewhere. - Geographical: There are strong affinities and relationships between Mediterranean and Atlantic faunas. Endemic species remain a biogeographical problem. Species always become smaller in size eastward where they occupy a progressively deeper habitat. Thus, the existing deep Mediterranean Sea appears to be younger than any other deep-sea constituent of the World Ocean...|$|R

40|$|Quantitative {{analyses}} of benthic foraminiferal assemblages {{were carried out}} on a Burdigalian - Langhian succession cropping out along the Adriatic coast (Cònero Riviera, Marche region, Italy). This succession, about 56 m thick, mainly consists of cyclically bedded mostly brown marls and more indurated marls, and subordinately of limestones. The {{lower part of the}} succession (0 - 23 m) is characterized by the occurrence of 4 composite but apparently massive layers (“megabeds”). By integrating the calcareous plankton events with the magnetostratigraphic record the section results to range from C 5 Cn. 1 n to C 5 Bn. 2 n Subchrons (Gennari et al., 2009). The most abundant and/or paleoecologically significant benthic taxa are: Bolivina reticulata, B. spathulata, Bulimina costata, Cibicidoides dutemplei/subhaidingerii, C. incrassatus and C. pachyderma, Gyroidina spp., Hanzawaia boueana, Lenticulina spp., Melonis barleeanum, Siphonina reticulata and Uvigerina semiornata. The co-occurrence and the relative abundance of B. reticulata, C. dutemplei/subhaidingerii and H. boueana suggest a paleobathymetry ranging from the upper to the middle <b>bathyal</b> <b>zones.</b> The most remarkable changes recorded in the benthic foraminiferal assemblages are shown by the pattern of the Benthic Number and the abundance curves of B. reticulata, B. spathulata, B. costata, C. dutemplei/subhaidingerii, C. incrassatus, Gyroidina spp., Lenticulina spp., S. reticulata and U. semiornata. In particular significant variations are recorded around 30 m, about 7 m above the disappearance of the “megabeds”. These variations allow the distinction of the following two intervals: 0 – 30 m interval: general high values of BN; assemblage composition characterized by the predominance of B. spathulata and Lenticulina spp., dysoxic and suboxic species respectively (Kaiho, 1994), and the occurrence of B. costata, a high productivity typical species (Van der Zwaan, 1982; Russo et al., 2007), and of the suboxic species Gyroidina spp. (Kaiho, 1994) and U. semiornata (Borsetti et al., 1986); 30 – 56 m interval: decrease in the BN; disappearance of B. spathulata and B. costata, decrease of Gyroidina spp., Lenticulina spp. and U. semiornata; increase and appearance of the oxic species B. reticulata, and C. dutemplei/subhaidingerii, C. incrassatus and S. reticulata respectively (Van der Zwaan, 1982; Kaiho, 1994; Russo et al., 2007). In conclusion changes in the BN pattern and assemblages composition are indicative of bottom water masses characterized by dysoxic/suboxic conditions, maybe due to a relatively higher productivity during the deposition of the “megabeds” (0 - 30 m interval) and an increase of the bottom water oxygen content together with a relatively decrease of productivity in {{the upper part of the}} succession (30 - 56 m).

Crustaceans of the order Isopoda were one of the dominant macrobenthic taxa, and the family Munnopsidae was the most abundant and diverse among 17 collected asellotan families, comprising about 48 % of all isopods. During the KuramBio expedition no less than 80 species of 28 genera and eight subfamilies of Munnopsidae were collected with 21 EBS hauls at 12 stations. About 80 % species are new to science and half of the genera and the subfamily Lipomerinae are recorded {{for the first time}} in the Northwest Pacific. The most abundant and speciose subfamily was Eurycopinae (58 % of all specimens and 29 % of species), followed by Ilyarachninae (12 % and 16 %). Most species are rare and occur with low abundance at one or few stations. Ten most numerous species belonging to the genera Eurycope (5 species), Microcope (2), Disconectes (1), Ilyarachna (1) and Aspidarachna (1) comprised 68 % of all munnopsids. The species Eurycope sp. 1 and Microcope ovata (Birstein, 1970) were the most abundant and frequent species, occurring at all stations. The highest abundance of Munnopsidae and high diversity, with 32 species, occurred at station 3 – 9 on the western slope of the KKT. The cluster analysis of the Bray–Curtis similarity shows a low similarity between stations. The least similar was station 1 - 10, with only 26 % similarity with other stations.

40|$|The Mediterranean Sea can be {{considered}} an excellent natural laboratory for benthic ecologists, due to its peculiar environmental conditions, its broad-scale gradients, and its deep-sea fauna. Primary production levels in the Mediterranean follow a longitudinal gradient, decreasing from west to east. The present thesis focused on the fine-mud benthos habitat of the Mediterranean Sea, on its <b>bathyal</b> and abyssal <b>zones,</b> and the compartment considered was demersal megafauna. The main objective of the present thesis was to describe and characterize the deep habitats of the Mediterranean Sea, relating their biodiversity and ecosystem functioning with the varying environmental conditions along the geographic, bathymetric, and temporal axes. The work was divided into four parts. In the first part, the patterns of distribution, biomass and abundance of bathyal and abyssal megafauna were studied, in relation with environmental variables, along longitudinal and bathymetric gradients. This was a large geographic scale study, across the three basins of the Mediterranean at depths of 1200 - 3000 m. Benthic biomass strongly decreased with depth and longitude (west-to-east). Results showed a significant correlation between the dynamics of surface layers, {{the amount of food}} available on the bottom, and the composition of benthos. In the second part, the seasonal fluctuations of benthic communities in the Catalan continental margin were observed. A highly replicated, multi-period study was conducted at depths of 900 - 1500 m. Total biomass followed an inverted U-shaped pattern, peaking at depths of 1050 - 1350 m. Range-related ecological forcings between shallower and deeper species may have caused this biomass accumulation at intermediate slope depths. The arrival of a new water mass from the deep basin to the slope in spring may have also driven an accumulation of biomass at 900 - 1050 m depth over the same period. An adjacent submarine canyon was also studied, comparing communities between the canyon and the open slope area. Analyses revealed higher diversity, but not biomass, inside the canyon than in the adjacent open slope, and a significantly different assemblage between the habitats. These results strengthen the concept of submarine canyons as hotspots of biodiversity and underline the importance of their conservation as diversity repositories. The third part is a study on trophic relations of deep-sea fauna, over the same large spatial transects considered in the first part, by means of natural-abundances stable isotopes analyses and the use of novel statistical methods to analyse heavy datasets all in once. Bulk-tissue d 13 C and d 15 N isotope ratios were analysed for benthic megafauna and associated surface and mesopelagic components from the 3 basins of the Mediterranean Sea. The trophic niche width and the amplitude of primary carbon sources were positively correlated with both primary and secondary surface production indicators. Moreover, mesopelagic organic matter utilization processes showed an intermediate position between surface and deep benthic components. Thus, both primary and secondary production processes taking place at surface layers are key drivers of deep-sea food web structuring. Finally, the fourth part integrates the whole collected dataset into the first ecotrophic model of a deep-water ecosystem in the Mediterranean Sea, evaluating the general ecosystem functioning as well as the degree of vulnerability of these ecosystems. The Ecopath with Ecosim approach was used to model the flows and biomasses of the Catalan Sea continental slope ecosystem at depths of 1000 - 1400 m. Network analysis identified low levels of consumer biomass cycling and low system omnivory index when compared with expected values of marine ecosystems, and higher cycling and omnivory when compared with available models of shallower areas of the Mediterranean. A simulation of the possible expansion of the red-shrimp benthic trawl fishery that currently operates at shallower depths, showed reductions in fish biomass and that the state of the deep continental slope ecosystem seems to be result of a long-term succession process, which has reached ecological stability, and is particularly vulnerable to human impact and, specifically, to fisheries exploitation. En la presente tesis se han estudiado los patrones de biodiversidad, funcionamiento trófico y ecosistémico de los sistemas bentónicos de gran profundidad en el Mar Mediterráneo. El objetivo principal fue de describir y caracterizar los hábitats profundos, relacionando su biodiversidad y sus procesos de funcionamiento con los gradientes ambientales a lo largo de los ejes longitudinal, batimétrico y estacional. El estudio de la composición de comunidades y la respectiva recogida de muestras para los análisis tróficos se han realizado a través de arrastres profundos. Los resultados de análisis de composición de comunidades hallaron una correlación significativa entre las dinámicas de las capas oceánicas de superficie, la cantidad de alimento disponible en el fondo marino, y la composición de la megafauna estudiada. A escala reducida y considerando las variaciones estacionales, la biomasa bentónica mostró un patrón a U-invertida, con un pico a profundidades de 1000 - 1400 m. Una posible explicación de este fenómeno podría ser la combinación de forzajes ecológicos ligados a las diferentes distribuciones batimétricas de las especies. Para estudiar las relaciones tróficas en los ejes batimétricos y geográficos de gran escala, se utilizó el análisis de isotopos estables de las componentes bentónicas, de superficie, y de capas pelágicas intermedias. El amplitud de los nichos tróficos de las comunidades bentónicas se encontraron relacionados con indicadores de productividad de superficie, tanto primaria como secundaria. Asimismo, los procesos de utilización mesopelágica del carbono orgánico se hallaron en posición intermedia entre los de superficie y los del bentos profundo. Finalmente, un análisis ecosistémico a través de “Ecopath with Ecosim”, reveló que los ecosistemas de los taludes continentales del Mediterráneo son el resultado de un largo proceso de sucesión ecológica, han alcanzado un estado de estabilidad, y son particularmente vulnerables a factores de impacto humano, entre ellos, la explotación pesquera...|$|R
