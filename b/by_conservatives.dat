5|$|During the Reagan years, Kemp and his {{followers}} ignored budget balancing while promoting tax cuts and economic growth. These tax cuts have been credited <b>by</b> <b>conservatives</b> for the economic growth from 1983 to 1990, which by 1996 {{had become one of}} the longest expansions in American history. Kemp notes that Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker's success at stemming inflation and the favorable regulatory environment were also major factors. Detractors note that the expansion was fueled by undesirable sectors like gaming, prisons, medical treatment, and credit card use.|$|E
5|$|Matters {{came to a}} head in 1766. During the Sejm in October of that year, Poniatowski {{attempted}} to push a radical reform, restricting the disastrous liberum veto policy. He was opposed <b>by</b> <b>conservatives</b> such as Michał Wielhorski, who were supported by the Prussian and Russian ambassadors, who threatened war if the reform was passed. The dissidents, supported by the Russians, formed a confederation, the Radom Confederation. Abandoned by the Familia, Poniatowski's reforms failed to pass at the Repnin Sejm, named after Russian ambassador Nicholas Repnin, who promised to guarantee the Golden Liberties of the Polish nobility, enshrined in the Cardinal Laws, with all the might of the Russian Empire.|$|E
5|$|The ACLU {{has been}} criticized by liberals, such as when it {{excluded}} Communists from its leadership ranks, when it defended Neo-Nazis, when it declined to defend Paul Robeson, or when it opposed {{the passage of the}} National Labor Relations Act. Conversely, it {{has been criticized}} <b>by</b> <b>conservatives,</b> such as when it argued against official prayer in public schools, or when it opposed the Patriot Act. The ACLU has supported conservative figures such as Rush Limbaugh, George Wallace, Henry Ford, and Oliver North; and it has supported liberal figures such as Dick Gregory, Rockwell Kent, and Dr. Benjamin Spock.|$|E

5|$|During the 1992 campaign, it was {{revealed}} that Clinton's uncle had attempted to secure him a position in the Navy Reserve, which would have prevented him from being deployed to Vietnam. This effort was unsuccessful and Clinton said in 1992 that he had been unaware of it until then. Although legal, Clinton's actions with respect to the draft and deciding whether to serve in the military were criticized during his first presidential campaign <b>by</b> <b>conservatives</b> and some Vietnam veterans, some of whom charged that he had used Fulbright's influence to avoid military service. Clinton's 1992 campaign manager, James Carville, successfully argued that Clinton's letter in which he declined to join the ROTC should be made public, insisting that voters, many of whom had also opposed the Vietnam War, would understand and appreciate his position.|$|E

25|$|In 1829, {{the name}} Ciudad Real {{was changed to}} San Cristóbal. In the 19th century, the state {{government}} would shift {{back and forth between}} San Cristóbal, in the highlands dominated <b>by</b> <b>Conservatives,</b> and Tuxtla, dominated by Liberals. Independent tendencies arose again in 1853, when the Plan of Yalmús was announced declaring the then Mexican Constitution null. Conservative forces attacked the city in 1857 but were dislodged shortly thereafter by Liberal Angel Albino Corzo. The last of French forces were expelled from the city in 1864. The state government was moved from San Cristóbal to Tuxtla for good in 1892 by the Liberal government. There was a failed attempt in 1911 <b>by</b> <b>Conservatives</b> in San Cristóbal and neighboring San Juan Chamula to force the return of the capital.|$|E
25|$|The {{criticism}} that the government received <b>by</b> <b>conservatives</b> proved unfounded: the public opinion followed almost fondly the events relating, as the conversion immediately took on the symbolic value of a real and lasting fiscal consolidation and a stable national unification. The resources were used to complete the nationalization of the railways.|$|E
25|$|Kirkpatrick's foreign policy, while applauded <b>by</b> <b>conservatives,</b> {{has been}} criticized by some historians and intellectuals, chiefly {{on the grounds that}} she worked solely for the {{interest}} of American corporations in Central America and so actually worked to undermine democratic government in Nicaragua and to suppress democratic movements in El Salvador and Guatemala.|$|E

It considered U.S. foreign policy and militarism historically and recently, centering on the Iran–Contra affair. It was harshly rebuked <b>by</b> <b>conservatives</b> and continuing into the 1990s was used by Republicans {{as a reason to}} threaten the funding of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and PBS.|$|E
25|$|Leo Power, {{a veteran}} of federal {{politics}} and the Conservative Party of Canada's campaign co-chair for Newfoundland and Labrador, said raising money and recruiting volunteers has proved difficult, and blames Williams's ABC campaign, saying it has cut deep into the federal election machine that is struggling to compete. Power has also said his party's best hope of winning {{a seat in the}} province is in the riding of Avalon with incumbent candidate Fabian Manning. Manning was defeated by Liberal Scott Andrews, while St. John's East and St. John's South—Mount Pearl, which were represented <b>by</b> <b>Conservatives</b> not running for re-election, were won by the NDP and Liberals, respectively, leaving the Conservatives with no representatives in Newfoundland and Labrador.|$|E
25|$|A {{subset of}} the Old Lights was the liberal party, which not only opposed revivalism but many {{traditional}} Calvinist beliefs as well. Accused <b>by</b> <b>conservatives</b> of having drifted into Arminianism, liberals such as Experience Mayhew, Lemuel Briant and Samuel Webster rejected the doctrines of original sin and total depravity and held that good works and virtuous living could lead to salvation. As {{a reaction to the}} emotional religion of the Great Awakening, the liberals embraced Enlightenment rationalism, which can be seen in their rejection of traditional doctrines. Charles Chauncy, for example, questioned the existence of an eternal hell and mounted a biblical defense of universal salvation. Jonathan Mayhew of Boston's West Church rejected traditional views on the divinity of Christ and embraced Arianism. In the 19th century, the liberals would evolve into the Unitarians.|$|E
