40|$|AbstractRationaleBest {{practice}} is an abstract word open to different interpretations. The definition of <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> {{depends on the}} context. PurposeThe purpose is to explore {{the meaning of the}} concept of <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> within the context of intrapartum care. MethodThe concept of <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> was analysed using Wilson's method of concept analysis. Dictionaries, a thesaurus, and an internet search were employed. References of journals were used to identify extra sources. Data saturation was reached at 117 definitions and uses of the concept of <b>best</b> <b>practice.</b> The definitions and uses of the concept of <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> listed in column one were read repeatedly. Common and similar patterns of words were highlighted. Grouping of common attributes and connotations occurred in column two and further deductive analysis and synthesis occurred in column three where derived essential attributes of the concept of <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> were categorised. ResultsThree broad categories emerged, namely (1) Values as antecedents of best practice; (2) A three-phased interactive integrative cyclic process of best practice; (phase one: awareness; phase two: need analysis and interactive process; phase three: consolidation); and (3) Desired outcomes of <b>best</b> <b>practice,</b> with resultant theoretical definition of the concept <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> during intra-partum care. Theoretical validity was attained through 117 sources used. RecommendationThe results of the concept analysis of <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> should be used to develop a model to facilitate <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> during intra-partum care...|$|R
40|$|Much {{is made of}} {{the concept}} <b>best</b> <b>practice.</b> It is {{repeatedly}} drawn upon by policy makers, academics and industry practitioners as a quasi-solution to construction industry ills. As an expression, {{it is often difficult}} to contest. Indeed, <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> implies identifying policy, process and procedure that offer the most optimum and efficient outcome. In short, <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> is all about improving performance. However, for the majority of commercial organizations, best strategy is also about improving performance. Despite the apparently congruent ambitions, <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> is not equal to best strategy. This misapprehension only serves to propagate the myth of <b>best</b> <b>practice.</b> This is a polemic paper, exploring the utility of <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> through the lens of construction supply chain management. Drawing inspiration from economic theory, construction management literature and previous supply chain management studies, the myth of <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> in construction supply chain management is exposed. Regardless of Government sponsorship and considerable academic investment, adoption of <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> in UK construction supply chain management remains slow and routinely symbolic. Yet, supply chain members do not behave irrationally. If <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> was truly in their best strategic interests it is highly probable that supply chain members would adjust their rules of economic engagement accordingly. It may be strongly argued that in contrast to the hype and repeated suggestion of supply chain win-win scenarios, UK Government endorsed <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> does not adequately serve the commercial interests of the majority. The very limited achievements of 'Rethinking Construction', serves as a case in point. Disappointingly, few lessons appear to have been learned. The myth of construction supply chain management and by extension <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> in UK construction continues unabated albeit under a shiny new banner, Construction 2025...|$|R

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This body of {{research}} explores the barriers that exist {{to the introduction of}} <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> models for dietetics services in rural areas of Australia. Best practice in this thesis refers to workforce staffing and organisational <b>best</b> <b>practice,</b> rather than clinical <b>best</b> <b>practice.</b> For the purpose of this thesis a <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> dietetic service has been defined as a timely, accessible, up-to-date nutrition and dietetic service that is effective in meeting the identified needs of the community based on a quality health service definition (Halton 2005). There is no known previous research that has investigated the elements of a <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> dietetics staffing model and the factors that support or inhibit the development of a <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> dietetic service model in rural areas. A review of the literature was conducted to determine the potential features of a <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> dietetic service for rural areas and the factors that are known to affect the development of a <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> service. A theoretical model of <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> dietetic services for rural areas was tested using a series of case studies. An exploratory sequential mixed methods approach has been used in six case study sites to investigate the barriers to <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> using rural sites in northern New South Wales (NSW), Australia as the setting. The mixed method multiple case study investigated the dietetics workforce characteristics and development in the study sites. Best practice dietetic service delivery was tested with cancer patients using the implementation and evaluation of <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> dietetic clinical guidelines in a rural setting. Key findings from this research include: retention issues related to a lack of management support, limited career pathways and professional isolation. Key drivers for the creation of dietetics positions included the actions of champions and the support of management. The main barriers to the creation of positions included a general lack of funds and competing priorities. The outcomes of this research are important for future workforce planning for dietitians in rural areas...|$|R

An engagement is usually managed by a generalist that covers the region the client's headquarters are located in and specialists that have either an industry or functional expertise.

This has sometimes led to accusations of sharing confidential information or re-packaging a competitor's tactics as <b>best</b> <b>practices.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the thought}} that {{increasing}} availability to emergency medicine will improve patient outcomes, little empirical evidence exists to directly support that claim, even in developed countries. Between 1985 and 1998 only 54 randomized controlled trials related to emergency medical services were published, implying {{that much of the}} current standard of care rests upon meager support. A similar lack of direct proof exists for the effectiveness of international assistance in promoting emergency medicine in other countries. Although it may seem that such efforts must improve health, the failure to quantify international emergency medicine's impact renders it more difficult to identify the <b>best</b> <b>practices</b> and target areas in which the most benefit may be achieved.|$|E

These exercises aimed to increase naval inter-operability, enabling the two navies to function with enhanced coordination during possible HADR operations. In addition, during the port visits, the Fleet Commander along with the Commanding Officers of the ships met high-ranking officials of the navy, state administration, port management, coastal security organisation, police, and other stakeholders of maritime security in the countries visited, to share professional experiences and exchange <b>best</b> <b>practices</b> in areas of mutual interest.|$|E

5|$|Operations aboard oil tankers {{are governed}} by an {{established}} body of <b>best</b> <b>practices</b> and {{a large body of}} international law. Cargo can be moved on or off of an oil tanker in several ways. One method is for the ship to moor alongside a pier, connect with cargo hoses or marine loading arms. Another method involves mooring to offshore buoys, such as a single point mooring, and making a cargo connection via underwater cargo hoses. A third method is by ship-to-ship transfer, also known as lightering. In this method, two ships come alongside in open sea and oil is transferred manifold to manifold via flexible hoses. Lightering is sometimes used where a loaded tanker is too large to enter a specific port.|$|E

5|$|American {{economist}} and former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Paul Volcker {{has argued that}} the lack of global consensus on key issues threatens efforts to reform the global financial system.

Volcker has expressed an array of potential coordinated measures: increased policy surveillance by the IMF and commitment from nations to adopt agreed-upon <b>best</b> <b>practices,</b> mandatory consultation from multilateral bodies leading to more direct policy recommendations, stricter controls on national qualification for emergency financing facilities (such as those offered by the IMF or by central banks), and improved incentive structures with financial penalties.|$|E

40|$|Summary: The {{importance}} of Information Security cannot be emphasised enough. It is therefore {{necessary to ensure}} that organisations comply with Information Security guidelines. This compliance ensures {{a high level of}} maturity. An amalgamation of a number of industry <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> documents relevant to Information Security and Information Security Governance forms a <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> driven Information Security Governance model. Theoretically, the implementation of the <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> driven model should lead to excellent Information Security within an organisation. A Security Maturity Model (SMM) provides an organisation with a distinct Information Security framework. Organisations that conform to these models are likely to pursue satisfactory Information Security. Additionally, the use of Security Maturity Models promotes the use of <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> standards that generally lead to proper Information Security Governance. Based on these two assertions, the hypothesis of this article is that the <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> driven Information Security Governance model is analogous to a Security Maturity Model. Accordingly, organisations can implement the <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> model as a sole tool to ensure Information Security Maturity. This article proves the hypothesis by extracting characteristics from various industry Security Maturity Models and developing a generic Security Maturity Model. The <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> driven model then maps onto the generic Security Maturity Model to prove the analogy. The premise {{of this study is that}} the <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> driven Information Security Governance model conforms to all the requirements of the generic Security Maturity Model. The conclusion is that the proper implementation of this model leads to a high Information Security Maturity level. 1...|$|R

40|$|It is broadly {{accepted}} that projects are temporary endeavours that create some unique ‘products’. That is, projects are also unique. Yet the <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> approach postulates that projects are basically same, {{and that one}} project management tool is better than another.

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to enhance debate focused on an {{established}} academic controversy, this study re-investigated selected data from the 1994 AMC survey of Australian and New Zealand manufacturing practices {{to test the hypothesis}} that <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> and product innovation may be incompatible generic business strategies. A modification of Robert G. Cooper’s Stage-Gate product development model was used as a theoretical framework to create a measurable construct of ‘product innovation’ as a strategy and compare two groups: firms committed to a <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> strategy (BPs) and firms not utilising <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> (Non-BPs). Eight variables were scrutinised. After logical critique was added to statistical data analysis, four major insights emerged. (1) Tests yielded several statistically significant but substantively inconclusive results because both studied groups had nearly identical profiles in rating innovation as the factor of lowest importance to commercial success and because the definitional framework which guided construction of the survey instrument treated innovation as a second-order issue. (2) Currently, <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> and product innovation are logically incompatible by definition. (3) Even if the definition of <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> were changed, {{it is likely that the}} additional key process of innovation would remain incompatible with the existing key process of benchmarking. (4) However, until the definition of <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> does make {{an attempt to}} include innovation as a key process rather than an outcome, testing any hypothesis of strategic compatibility between a <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> focus and an innovation focus will be both empirically difficult and logically unnecessary. <br /...|$|R
