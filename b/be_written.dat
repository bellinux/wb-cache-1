5|$|In {{a perfect}} scenario, this would enable every block to <b>be</b> <b>written</b> to its maximum life so they all fail {{at the same}} time. Unfortunately, the process to evenly {{distribute}} writes requires data previously written and not changing (cold data) to be moved, so that data which are changing more frequently (hot data) can <b>be</b> <b>written</b> into those blocks. Each time data are relocated without being changed by the host system, this increases the write amplification and thus reduces {{the life of the}} flash memory. The key is to find an optimum algorithm which maximizes them both.|$|E

50|$|The {{progressive}} (or continuous) {{aspect is}} expressed with {{a form of}} be together with the present participle of the verb. Thus present progressive (present continuous) constructions take forms like <b>am</b> <b>writing,</b> <b>is</b> <b>writing,</b> <b>are</b> <b>writing,</b> while the past progressive (past continuous, also called imperfect) <b>is</b> <b>was</b> <b>writing,</b> <b>were</b> <b>writing.</b> There <b>is</b> a progressive infinitive (to) <b>be</b> <b>writing</b> and a progressive subjunctive <b>be</b> <b>writing.</b> Other progressive forms, made with compound forms of be, are described below.|$|R

5|$|Almost all the {{necessary}} corrections of misspellings have been made. Sometimes a stroke of the pen indicates an error, perhaps to be corrected later. Some corrections seem to <b>be</b> <b>written</b> by prima manu (e.g. Matthew 4:10; 5:19) others plainly secondary manu (Matthew 6; Luke 3; 10:35). The apostrophe is used even when not required, especially in εξ', and ουκ'.|$|E
5|$|Because Perl is an {{interpreted}} language, it {{can give}} problems when efficiency is critical; in such situations, {{the most critical}} routines can <b>be</b> <b>written</b> in other languages (such as C), which can be connected to Perl via simple Inline modules or the more complex but flexible XS mechanism.|$|E
5|$|Because of this {{equivalence}} {{between these}} {{different types of}} operation, a 2-satisfiability instance may also <b>be</b> <b>written</b> in implicative normal form, in which we replace each or operation in the conjunctive normal form by both of the two implications {{to which it is}} equivalent.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] vowel <b>is</b> {{usually not}} <b>written.</b> For example, [...] ("thought") <b>is</b> <b>written</b> մտածում (not մըտածում), and [...] ("marvelous") <b>is</b> <b>written</b> սքանչելի (not ըսքանչելի).<ը> <b>is</b> <b>written</b> in the {{following}} cases: ...|$|R

5|$|C# {{provides}} properties as syntactic sugar for {{a common}} pattern in which a pair of methods, accessor (getter) and mutator (setter) encapsulate operations on a single attribute of a class. No redundant method signatures for the getter/setter implementations need <b>be</b> <b>written,</b> and the property may be accessed using attribute syntax rather than more verbose method calls.|$|E

5|$|From the 9th century, Nuskhuri script {{starting}} becoming dominant, and {{the role}} of Asomtavruli was reduced. However, epigraphic monuments of the 10th to 18th centuries continued to <b>be</b> <b>written</b> in Asomtavruli script. Asomtavruli in this later period became more decorative. In the majority of 9th-century Georgian manuscripts which were written in Nuskhuri script, Asomtavruli was used for titles and the first letters of chapters. Although, some manuscripts written completely in Asomtavruli can be found until the 11th century.|$|E
5|$|Hieratic is a simplified, cursive form of Egyptian hieroglyphs. Like hieroglyphs, hieratic {{was used}} in sacred and {{religious}} texts. By the 1st millennium BC, calligraphic hieratic became the script predominantly used in funerary papyri and temple rolls. Whereas the writing of hieroglyphs required the utmost precision and care, cursive hieratic could <b>be</b> <b>written</b> much more quickly and was therefore more practical for scribal record-keeping. Its primary purpose was {{to serve as a}} shorthand script for non-royal, non-monumental, and less formal writings such as private letters, legal documents, poems, tax records, medical texts, mathematical treatises, and instructional guides. Hieratic could <b>be</b> <b>written</b> in two different styles; one was more calligraphic and usually reserved for government records and literary manuscripts, the other was used for informal accounts and letters.|$|E

5|$|In {{colonial times}} Mayan {{languages}} came to <b>be</b> <b>written</b> in a script {{derived from the}} Latin alphabet; orthographies were developed mostly by missionary grammarians. Not all modern Mayan languages have standardized orthographies, but the Mayan languages of Guatemala use a standardized, Latin-based phonemic spelling system developed by the Academia de Lenguas Mayas de Guatemala (ALMG). Orthographies for the languages of Mexico are currently being developed by the Instituto Nacional de Lenguas Indígenas (INALI).|$|E
5|$|In the infinite-dimensional case, an {{orthonormal}} basis {{will not}} be a basis in the sense of linear algebra; to distinguish the two, the latter basis is also called a Hamel basis.
