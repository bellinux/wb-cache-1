5|$|By day six, 22 September, {{the battle}} {{had settled into}} a routine of mortaring and small probing attacks at times {{supported}} by armoured vehicles and sniper fire. The Poles, dug in south of the river, relieved part of {{the pressure on the}} division, as some German forces were diverted to confront them. The following day began in a similar way to previous days with a mortar and artillery bombardment, followed by infantry and armour trying to find a gap in the perimeter. The KOSB, Glider Pilots and the 21st Independent Company who were all defending the brigade area were repeatedly attacked. Furthermore, food and water shortages also took their toll on the men, with foraging parties subjected to sniper fire. On day eight, 24 September, although German attacks continued, the enemy were engaged by artillery of the XXX Corps south of the river and aircraft from the Royal Air Force. This broke up most assaults <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> started.|$|E
5|$|Homer, {{attempting}} {{to prove to}} himself he can {{have a good time}} without Marge, leaves Bart, Lisa and Maggie under the supervision of Lionel Hutz and goes out by himself. Finding Moe's Tavern more depressing than usual, Homer visits the hilltop where he and Marge used to come to on dates <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> married. Ironically, Marge has also taken Ruth there to finish the night, but they leave just before Homer arrives. Chief Wiggum finds Homer depressed and offers him a ride home, which Homer accepts. As Ruth and Marge are driving home, Chief Wiggum, with Homer as a passenger in his patrol car, spots Ruth's car and claims that one tail light is slightly smaller than the other. He decides to pull them over. Reluctant to stop, Ruth reveals to Marge that the car she's driving actually belongs to her ex-husband, and that she had stolen it as revenge for stiffing her on child support (although Marge points out that Ruth could've just reported him to child services). Ruth leads the police on a high-speed chase rather than turning herself in. Homer realizes it is Marge in the car, and believes she is leaving him after discovering that she can have a better time without him. Ruth successfully evades Wiggum by turning off her headlights, which leads him to believe her car is a ghost car.|$|E
25|$|On April 29, 2016 Tarkan {{married his}} long-time girlfriend, Pınar Dilek. The couple met in 2011 after {{a concert in}} Germany. Dilek has {{been a fan of}} Tarkan long <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> acquainted.|$|E

25|$|Alan Ford was {{translated}} into French, Croatian, Danish, Portuguese and in the 1990s subsequent Croatian, Bosnian, Serbian, Macedonian and Slovenian editions appeared.

It was also translated into Albanian in Republic of Kosovo which saw only five issues before getting dropped, also due to poor sales.|$|E
25|$|Allied {{forces were}} {{fighting}} {{their way across}} France, and fresh units were badly needed in autumn 1944 to continue to press the offensive. The breakout from Saint-Lô, France was accomplished far more rapidly than Allied planners had dared hope, and American units plunged through the French countryside with undreamed of rapidity, far in advance of operational plans. American press reports from the European theater foretold the imminent fall of the Third Reich, and many men in Lt. Col. Butler's battalion thought that the war just might be over <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> there. This did not {{turn out to be}} true.|$|E
25|$|The Greed Killing EP was {{the next}} release from the band, through Earache. After the preview with the EP, Diatribes, a {{full-length}} album was released. Although things {{seemed to be going}} smoothly from outside, they were going through problems. Misunderstanding arose between the members and singer Greenway was expelled from the band in late/mid 1996. Greenway went to record with Extreme Noise Terror (the ENT release Damage 381 features Barney on lead vocals) and ENT's main singer Phil Vane went to fill vocals slot in Napalm Death. Things did not go as well as they were supposed to, and Vane was kicked out of the band just <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> into the studio to record the new album. And so Greenway returned to Napalm Death.|$|E

25|$|That was <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> in to bat, however. England {{survived the}} first three overs, bowled by McGrath and Lee, without loss. From then on, however, the English lost wickets by the bucketful. England went from 11 for 0 to 19 for 4 {{in the space of}} four overs, as the bowlers put the {{pressure}} on immediately, and their entire top-order came and went for single-figure scores. Paul Collingwood and Andrew Flintoff survived for a couple more overs, before Flintoff edged McGrath to slip – the score 33 for 5, and England should see themselves lucky to bat out 50 overs – or even score 100 runs. Collingwood and Geraint Jones decided to wait, giving McGrath maiden overs (as he finished his first bowling spell with figures of 7–4–9–3), and despite the batsmen being rapped on the pads, they survived, even taking the occasional six off Jason Gillespie.|$|E
25|$|Another {{foil for}} Ralph is Alice's mother, who is even sharper-tongued than her daughter. She despises Ralph {{as a bad}} provider. Alice's father is {{occasionally}} mentioned but never seen. Alice's sister, Agnes, appeared in one episode (Ralph jeopardizes his newlywed sister-in-law's marriage after giving some bad advice to the groom, but all works out in the end). Ralph and Alice lived with her mother for six years after getting married <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> their own apartment. Ralph's mother rarely is mentioned, although she does appear in one episode. Ralph's father is only mentioned in one episode ("Young Man with a Horn") as having given Ralph a cornet he learned to play as a boy, and insists on keeping when Alice suggests it be thrown away. In a 1967 revival, Ralph refers to Alice (played by Sheila MacRae 1966–70 and once more in 1973) as being one of 12 children with her father never working.|$|E
25|$|The Black Family {{made their}} first major show {{appearance}} at Verano de Escandalo (2001) where they lost an elimination match to Los Vatos Locos (Espiritu, Nygma, Silver Cat and Picudo), {{also in the}} match were Los Vipers (Psicosis II, Histeria, Maniaco and Mosco de la Merced) and Los Exoticos. the team did not make another major show appearance until a year later when they unsuccessfully challenged Los Vatos Locos for the Mexican National Atómicos Championship at Verano de Escandalo (2002). that challenge {{was the first of}} many as the Black Family began chasing the Atómicos title and feuding with Los Vatos Locos. On April 19, 2002 Chessman teamed up with fellow LLL stable mate Electroshock to defeat the team of La Parka, Jr. and Mascara Sagrada to win the Mexican National Tag Team Championship. when Los Vatos Locos lost the titles to someone else in late 2002 the Black Family started to target the new champions Oscar Sevilla and Los Barrio Boys (Alan, Billy Boy and Decnnis). When Charly Manson returned to action he sided with Los Vipers instead of the Black Family leading to a match at Guerra de Titanes 2002 where the Black Family defeated Manson, Histeria, Mosco de la Merced, and Psicosis II. On July 18, 2003 the Black Family won their first championship as a unit when they defeated Oscar Sevilla and Los Barrio Boys for the Atómicos title, but their run only lasted 31 days before Sevilla and Los Barrio Boys regained the titles. Chessman's run of bad luck continued as Octagón and La Parka won the Mexican National Tag Team titles from Chessman and Electroshock. the Black Family would wait over a year <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> another opportunity to hold the titles as they won them on August 20, 2004.|$|E

500|$|Twenty Vickers quick-firing (QF) 3-pounder {{guns were}} fitted for defence against torpedo boats, six on turret roofs and {{fourteen}} in the superstructure, all on pivot mounts.

500|$|After a {{month to}} recover from his wounds, Kizirian rejoined his unit, which was {{assigned}} to Sugar Loaf Hill. The Marines battled over one ridge after another toward NaHa, the capital city. On three separate occasions Kizirian was tossed in the air by Japanese artillery and mortar fire while he provided covering fire for {{other members of his}} unit, who were retreating down a slope. Kizirian's company moved to a burial ground where Japanese soldiers were hiding in holes dug in the nearby hillsides. During the operation, someone yelled, [...] "Two over your head!" [...] Kizirian responded by killing both of the enemy combatants with his carbine. [...] Kizirian would later recall, [...] "I must have shot four clips into those guys, I got them <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> me."

According to Cook, she was driven to downtown Clearwater by another staff member, along with her husband, to eat at the Church's dining hall. The couple took the opportunity to escape Scientology when the staff member went inside to get breakfast; Cook jumped into the driver's seat, drove with her husband to the nearest car rental outlet and hired a car to drive up to her father's house in North Carolina. <b>Before</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> there, they were intercepted by Church officials and ordered to return to Clearwater. She spent three weeks under guard, at one point writing in a letter to her mother that if she was not released she [...] "would take whatever steps necessary, like slitting my wrists", before finally signing a severance agreement. She later said that by that point, [...] "I would have signed that I stabbed babies over and over again and loved it".|$|E
500|$|The rivalry, {{which is}} the oldest in the sport, is fueled by history, competitiveness, and {{cultural}} implication. Both schools {{are located in the}} state of Maryland, a historical hotbed for lacrosse, and have traditionally been two of the sport's powerhouses. Many of the opposing players have had past associations in grade school, high school, or youth club sports. Hopkins' current coach and former player Dave Pietramala said, [...] "Everybody knew each other; we had all played together at some point or another. It was a fierce, intense game and there was no love lost on the field." [...] Additionally, Johns Hopkins is a private university, while Maryland is a public institution. Former Terrapins coach Dick Edell said:"To get the juices flowing before the game, [...] kids that it was the blue-collar guys against the future executives—that this was their only chance to get them <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> into the real world.
