40|$|We {{investigate}} {{a wide range}} of possible evolutionary histories for the recently discovered <b>Bootes</b> dwarf spheroidal galaxy, a Milky Way satellite. By means of N-body simulations we follow the evolution of possible progenitor galaxies of <b>Bootes</b> for a variety of orbits in the gravitational potential of the Milky Way. The progenitors considered cover the range from dark-matter-free star clusters to massive, dark-matter dominated outcomes of cosmological simulations. For each type of progenitor and orbit we compare the observable properties of the remnant after 10 Gyr with those of <b>Bootes</b> observed today. Our study suggests that the progenitor of <b>Bootes</b> must have been, and remains now, dark matter dominated. In general our models are unable to reproduce the observed high velocity dispersion in <b>Bootes</b> without dark matter. Our models do not support time-dependent tidal effects as a mechanism able to inflate significantly the internal velocity dispersion. As none of our initially spherical models is able to reproduce the elongation of <b>Bootes,</b> our results suggest that the progenitor of <b>Bootes</b> may have had some intrinsic flattening. Although the focus of the present paper is the <b>Bootes</b> dwarf spheroidal, these models may be of general relevance to understanding the structure, stability and dark matter content of all dwarf spheroidal galaxies.

40|$|We present MMT/Megacam imaging in Sloan g and r of the {{extremely}} low luminosity <b>Boötes</b> II Milky Way companion. We use a bootstrap approach to perform robust measurements of, and uncertainties on, <b>Boötes</b> II’s distance, luminosity, size, and morphology. Comparisons with theoretical isochrones and empirical globular cluster fiducials show that <b>Boötes</b> II’s stellar population is old and metal-poor ([Fe/H] ∼ <- 2). Assuming a stellar population {{like that of}} M 92, <b>Boötes</b> II is {{at a distance of}} 42 ± 2 kpc, closer than the initial published estimate of 60 ± 10 kpc. This distance revision, combined with a more robust measurement of <b>Boötes</b> II’s structure with a Plummer model (exponential model) results in a more compact inferred physical half-light size of rh ≃ 36 (33) ± 9 (10) pc and lower inferred luminosity of MV ≃ − 2. 4 (− 2. 2) ± 0. 7 (0. 7) mag. The revised size and luminosity we calculate move <b>Boötes</b> II into a region of size-luminosity space not previously known to be occupied by old stellar populations, but also occupied by the recently discovered Milky Way satellites Willman 1 and SEGUE 1. We show that the apparently distorted morphology of <b>Boötes</b> II is not statistically significant given the present data. We use a tidal argument to support a scenario where <b>Boötes</b> II is a dwarf galaxy (dark matter dominated) rather than a globular cluster (not dark matter dominated), although the uncertainty on the M/L we infer for <b>Boötes</b> II is substantial. Moreover, we can not rule out that <b>Boötes</b> II is a star cluster on the verge of disruption, such as Palomar 5. Subject headings: galaxies: dwarf — Local Grou...|$|R

My tuo brigads lay in a village within halfe a mile of Applebie; my own quarter was in a gentleman's house, ho was a Ritmaster, and at that time with Sir Marmaduke; his wife keepd her chamber readie to be brought to bed. The castle being over, and Lambert farre enough, I resolved to goe to bed everie night, haveing had fatigue enough before. 'The first night I sleepd well enough; and riseing nixt morning, I misd one linnen stockine, one halfe silke one, and one boothose, the accoustrement under a <b>boote</b> for one leg; neither could they be found for any search. Being provided of more of the same kind, I made myselfe reddie, and rode to the head-quarters. At my returne, I could heare no news of my stockins. That night I went to bed, and nixt morning found myselfe just so used; missing the three stockins for one leg onlie, the other three being left intire as they were the day before. A narrower search then the first was made, bot without successe. I had yet in reserve one paire of whole stockings, and a paire of boothose, greater then the former. These I put on my legs. The third morning I found the same usage, the stockins for one leg onlie left me. It was time for me then, and my servants too, to imagine it must be rats that had shard my stockins so inequallie with me; and this the mistress of the house knew well enough, but would not tell it me. The roome, which was a low parlour, being well searched with candles, the top of my great boothose was found at a hole, in which they had drawne all the rest. I went abroad and ordered the boards to be raised, to see how the rats had disposed of my moveables. The mistress sent a servant of her oune to be present at this action, which she knew concerned her. One board being bot a litle opend, a litle boy of mine thrust in his hand, and fetchd with him foure and tuentie old peeces of gold, and one angell. The servant of the house affirmed it appertained to his mistres. The boy bringing the gold to me, I went immediatlie to the gentlewomans chamber, and told her, it was probable Lambert haveing quarterd in that house, as indeed he had, some of his servants might have hid that gold; and if so, it was lawfullie mine; bot if she could make it appeare it belongd to her, I should immediatlie give it her. The poore gentlewoman told me with many teares, that her husband being none of the frugallest men (and indeed he was a spendthrift), she had hid that gold without his, knowledge, to make use of it as she had occasion, especiallie when she lay in; and conjured me, as I lovd the King (for whom her husband and she had suffered much), not to detaine her gold. She said, if there was either more or lesse then foure and tuentie whole peeces, and two halfe ones, it sould be none of hers; and that they were put by her in a red velvet purse. After I had given her assureance of her gold, a new search is made, the other angell is found, the velvet purse all gnawd in bits, as my stockins were, and the gold instantlie restord to the gentlewoman. I have often heard that the eating or gnawing of cloths by rats is ominous, and portends some mischance to fall on those to whom the cloths belong. I thank God I was never addicted to such divinations, or heeded them. It is true, that more misfortunes then one fell on me shortlie after; bot I am sure I could have better forseene them myselfe then rats or any such vermine, and yet did it not. I have heard indeed many fine stories told of rats, how they abandon houses and ships, when the first are to be burnt and the second dround. Naturalists say they are very sagacious creatures, and I beleeve they are so; bot I shall never be of the opinion they can forsee future contingencies, which I suppose the divell himselfe can neither forknow nor fortell; these being things which the Almightie hath keepd hidden in the bosome of his divine prescience. And whither the great God hath preordained or predestinated these things, which to us are contingent, to fall out by ane uncontrollable and unavoidable necessitie, is a question not yet decided."

40|$|We present {{moderately}} deep V IC photometry of <b>Boötes</b> II, obtained {{using the}} SOAR Telescope.

A radial profile of the <b>Boötes</b> I stellar distribution shows a break radius indicating the presence of extra-tidal stars. These observations strongly suggest that <b>Boötes</b> I is experiencing tidal disruption, although not as extreme as that exhibited by the Hercules dwarf spheroidal. Combined with revised velocity dispersion measurements from the literature, we see evidence suggesting the need to review previous theoretical models of the <b>Boötes</b> I dwarf spheroidal galaxy.
