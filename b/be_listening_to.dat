5|$|The {{heightened}} vigilance of the German garrison {{as the war}} entered {{its final}} phase made these operations especially hazardous, particularly as they were often attempted at extremely close quarters. On several occasions Rhodesian patrols only narrowly escaped discovery. During one action, two Rhodesian patrols catered {{for the possibility that}} Germans might <b>be</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> their transmissions by communicating in Shona, an African language. The LRDG's last actions of the war, in April and May 1945, were to help Tito's partisans capture German-held islands off Dalmatia.|$|E
25|$|Interpretations abound. Perhaps this {{particular}} formation represents a council of some sort—the fifteen other figurines seem to <b>be</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> the red granite one, with the celts forming a backdrop. One {{of the most}} striking offerings found at La Venta, the celts in Offering Number 4, depict a person with a ceremonial headdress “flying” and also the maize deity. There appears to be a definite symbolic link here, but it is unclear whether it is tied to the Olmec rudimentary writing system. To the red granite figurine's right, there seems be a line of three figurines filing past him. Another researcher has suggested that the granite figure is an initiate.|$|E

25|$|The {{band had}} {{originally}} planned to self-title their previous album, Documentaly (2011), {{due to the}} album's documentary theme. However, as {{the events of the}} 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami affecting the album's recording so much, as this did not reflect their attempt to express everything that was happening in 2011, as opposed to just what happened to the band. For their next album, they decided to revisit this idea. This was due to the band's greater exposure in Japan through their commercial tie-ups, which would mean a great number of people would <b>be</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> Sakanaction for the first time for this album. Yamaguchi described making music for this new audience as feeling like the band were releasing their first album again, which strengthened their desire to self-title this release.|$|E
500|$|A mixed {{review was}} given by Andy Gill of The Independent who said that [...] "the vocal editing on 'Start Over' is far too sloppy, {{confirming}} again that a series of individual flourishes doesn't pass muster as a performance." [...] David Amidon of PopMatters also gave a mixed review for [...] "Start Over" [...] and [...] "Countdown" [...] saying that they [...] "just don't seem to <b>be</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> themselves, and will get by on listenability more than lyrical wizardry if they get by at all." [...] Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone also gave a mixed review for the song, saying: [...] "While the other songs on 4 all have a distinct flavor and give Beyoncé an opportunity {{to try something new}} in some way or another, 'Start Over' just kind of sits there at the middle of the disc not doing much of anything." [...] He also noted that [...] "Start Over" [...] was an [...] "inoffensive ballad that doesn't do much for the record aside from break its momentum at the halfway point." ...|$|E

2500|$|Another long-standing {{tradition}} is the playing of Wagner's [...] "Ride of the Valkyries" [...] at 7:00 each morning during finals {{week with the}} largest, loudest speakers available. The playing of that piece is not allowed {{at any other time}} (except if one happens to <b>be</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> the entire 14 hours and 5 minutes of The Ring Cycle), and any offender is dragged into the showers to be drenched in cold water fully dressed. The playing of the Ride is such a strong tradition that the music was used during Apollo 17 to awaken Astronaut Harrison Schmitt, a Caltech alumnus. Unfortunately, the tradition arose at different times in different Houses, so Schmitt did not react as expected. Instead, he just became confused.|$|E
2500|$|Tatum was not {{inclined}} toward understatement or expansive use of space. [...] He seldom {{played in a}} simplified way, preferring interpretations that displayed his great technique and clever harmonizations. [...] When jazz pianist Stanley Cowell {{was growing up in}} Toledo, his father prevailed upon Tatum to play piano at the Cowell home. [...] Stanley described the scene as, [...] "Tatum played so brilliantly and so much ... that I thought the piano was gonna break. [...] My mother left the room ... so I said 'What's wrong, Mama?' [...] And she said 'Oh, that man plays too much piano. [...] A handful of critics, notably Keith Jarrett, have complained that Tatum played too many notes or was too ornamental or was even 'unjazzlike'. [...] Jazz critic Gary Giddins opined, [...] "That is the essence of Tatum. If you don't like his ornament, you should <b>be</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> someone else. That's where his genius is." ...|$|E

In January the following year, at the 35th Country Music Awards of Australia, she received three Golden Guitar trophies for Female Artist of the Year, Single of the Year, and Song of the Year for [...] "Poster Girl (Wrong Side of the World)".

2500|$|The United States {{initially}} voiced {{opposition to}} his election {{to a third}} four-year term in 2005. In a May 2005 interview with {{the staff of the}} U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Lawrence Wilkerson, the chief of staff to former U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell, charged former Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security John Bolton with an underhanded campaign to unseat ElBaradei. [...] "Mr. Bolton overstepped his bounds in his moves and gyrations to try to keep [...] from being reappointed as [...] head," [...] Wilkerson said. The Washington Post reported in December 2004 that the Bush administration had intercepted dozens of ElBaradei’s phone calls with Iranian diplomats and was scrutinizing them for evidence [...] they could use to force him out. IAEA spokesman Mark Gwozdecky said the agency worked on [...] "the assumption that one or more entities may <b>be</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> our conversations." [...] "It's not how we would prefer to work, but it is the reality. At the end of the day, we have nothing to hide," [...] he said. [...] Iran responded to the Washington Post reports by accusing the U.S. of violating international law in intercepting the communications.|$|E
2500|$|The {{greatest}} challenge is {{the sheer size}} of the radio search needed to look for signals (effectively spanning the entire visible universe), the limited amount of resources committed to SETI, and the sensitivity of modern instruments. SETI estimates, for instance, that with a radio telescope as sensitive as the Arecibo Observatory, Earth's television and radio broadcasts would only be detectable at distances up to 0.3 light-years, less than 1/10 the distance to the nearest star. [...] A signal is much easier to detect if the signal energy is limited to either a narrow range of frequencies, or directed at a specific part of the sky. Such signals could be detected at ranges of hundreds {{to tens of thousands of}} light-years distance.. Indeed, at that unique time, the Sun will appear to the receptors to be by far the brightest star of the Milky Way." [...] However, this means that detectors must <b>be</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> an appropriate range of frequencies, and be in that region of space to which the beam is being sent. Many SETI searches assume that extraterrestrial civilizations will be broadcasting a deliberate signal, like the Arecibo message, in order to be found.|$|E
2500|$|Brown {{began the}} 2011–12 season {{on a line}} with newly {{acquired}} center Mike Richards, but was shuffled throughout the lineup {{for most of the}} season. He maintained his consistent production, topping 20 goals and 50 points for the fifth-straight year. Along {{with the rest of the}} Kings, however, he struggled to score in the first half of the season. Head Coach Terry Murray was fired midway through the season, and as the Kings fell further out of the playoff picture, they were rumored to <b>be</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> trade offers for Brown. New coach Darryl Sutter called the Brown-Kopitar tandem [...] "stale" [...] and said Brown was not playing the [...] "straight-line, up-and-down, go-to-the-net, shoot-the-puck, run-over-people" [...] style Brown needed to be effective. Brown's scoring pace picked up amidst the trade rumors, and he scored three goals and an assist in the last game before the NHL trade deadline, a 4–0 win over the Chicago Blackhawks. The Kings held on to Brown, who responded with 11 points in the nine games following the trade deadline. Brown later said that he was playing with [...] "a chip on his shoulder" [...] and [...] "whether those rumors are true or not, they're still out there, it gives you maybe a bit more motivation." [...] With Brown producing and the trade-deadline acquisition of Jeff Carter, the Kings were one of the highest-scoring NHL teams down the stretch and made the playoffs as an eighth seed. After moving up-and-down the lineup for most of the year, Brown found stability playing on the first line with Anže Kopitar and Justin Williams. That line would remain intact throughout the entire 2012 Stanley Cup playoffs.|$|E

2500|$|The Nacirema Dream was {{met with}} {{generally}} positive reviews from music critics. Reed Jackson of XXL praised his storytelling, colorful metaphors and overtly complex word play. He also said, [...] "The production is so outdated you can’t help but think that these songs have literally just been sitting around this whole time. But ultimately, The Nacirema Dream should be celebrated – not only for it’s long overdue release, but because Papoose actually made the album he had always planned on making." [...] Logan Smithson of PopMatters gave the album a seven out of ten, saying [...] "The Nacirema Dream {{is a prime example}} of how hip-hop can serve as a platform for storytelling. Papoose confirms that the hype around his lyrical prowess was real. However, the album isn’t without its faults. Coming out seven years behind schedule, the production is noticeably a little dated. [...] While the beats are solid, The Nacirema Dream isn’t an album that you’ll <b>be</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> because you want to hear great production. It also could have benefited from being slightly trimmed. Listeners might feel fatigued while sitting through the 75 minutes that this album has to offer. Regardless, The Nacirema Dream is an admirable achievement. Papoose fought through label issues and made the album that he wanted to make, even if it took him seven years to finally get that album out to the public." [...] Del F. Cowie of Exclaim! gave the album a six out of ten, saying [...] "Papoose gamely battles on, delivering some of his trademark punch lines, and you can tell he genuinely attempted to deliver a well-rounded record. However, there's not enough innovation to interest casual fans in the project." ...|$|E
