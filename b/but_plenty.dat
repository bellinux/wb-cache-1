500|$|A {{few days}} before the battle, Warren and General Artemas Ward, {{commander}} of the besieging forces, inspected Noddle's Island and Hog Island, which lay to the northeast of Boston, and east of Charlestown. [...] They found no British troops there <b>but</b> <b>plenty</b> of livestock. The animals in other coastal areas had been moved inland by their owners. [...] On May 21, the British had sailed troops to Grape Island in the outer harbor near Weymouth to get hay and livestock, and had been driven off by militia mustered from the nearby towns, which then removed the livestock and burned the hay on the island.|$|E
500|$|The {{two major}} {{television}} markets that reach Blackford County are Indianapolis and Fort Wayne. [...] Although a few lower-powered stations are located closer to Blackford County in {{cities such as}} Muncie, Marion, and Kokomo, these stations typically do not have a broadcast range that covers all of Blackford County. [...] There are no AM radio stations based in Blackford County, <b>but</b> <b>plenty</b> of nearby areas have AM stations in broadcast range. [...] This includes Indianapolis, Fort Wayne, Muncie, and Marion among others. [...] Plenty of FM stations are also in broadcast range, and Blackford County has FM radio stations located in Hartford City and Montpelier. [...] Hartford City, Montpelier, and portions of the county's rural areas have internet access available.|$|E
500|$|Pitchfork Media's Jordan Sagent viewed {{that the}} EP [...] "isn't blowing the doors off of anything, <b>but</b> <b>plenty</b> of rappers have trouble {{releasing}} records this tight and thematically consistent, and ultimately, Hodgy makes {{his name and}} money with MellowHype, and that group has shown no signs of slowing down." [...] Exclaim!'s Gregory Drakes praised the track [...] "Lamented", writing that the [...] "strangely interesting production still amazes", and [...] "for those who are still a bit weary about Odd Future, Hodgy Beats' Untitled EP is good appetizer even for the ficklest consumers." [...] Jo Fuertes Knight of NME commented that while the record [...] "probably won’t set the world alight", he called it an [...] "accomplished project, resonating with crackly stoner soul and genuinely thoughtful lyrics – and a reminder that far from the teenage Tumblr caricature, Odd Future are still making {{some of the most}} exciting, accomplished music of our time." [...] Stereogum's Corban Goble described the EP as [...] "probably the best set of tracks the Odd Future camp has squeezed out since, like, Goblin." ...|$|E

500|$|David Browne of Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} album a B+. Browne said, [...] "Few bands since Led Zeppelin have so crisply mixed {{instruments}} both acoustic and electric." [...] He praised several songs as being [...] "as powerful as anything the band has done." [...] Browne criticized the album's production, saying [...] "like many self-produced efforts, it shows." [...] He added, [...] "With arrangements that crest and {{fall to the}} point where a road map would have helped, the overlong (16-song) album is often unwieldy and could have benefited from judicious trimming." [...] Allmusic staff writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album three out of five stars, saying that [...] "it might seem like nothing more than heavy metal, but a closer listen reveals that Soundgarden haven't tempered their ambitions at all." [...] The reviewer for Melody Maker said that [...] "their roots don't matter now. All I care for now is the immediacy of their pop moments." [...] Critic Robert Christgau gave the album an honorable mention of one star, describing it as [...] "brutal depression simplified" [...] and highlighted by the songs [...] "Ty Cobb" [...] and [...] "Applebite", while Jason Josephes from Pitchfork Media called it a [...] "double shot of grunge, no foam <b>but</b> <b>plenty</b> of caffeine." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wyatt sings on [...] "Little Red Riding Hood Hit the Road" [...] {{from his}} solo album, Rock Bottom (1974), and on [...] "We Did It Again", a [...] "surprising and wackily absurdist" [...] {{cover of the}} Soft Machine song from their debut album, The Soft Machine (1968). The version of [...] "We Did It Again" [...] that appears on this CD is a {{combination}} of two different recordings of the same performance, one from an audience cassette recording with [...] "a lot of audience reaction, a lot of guitar, thin-sounding drums and bass, and only a faint echo of the vocals", and one from the mixing desk with [...] "almost no guitar, <b>but</b> <b>plenty</b> of drums, bass, and vocals".|$|E
2500|$|Late in {{the product}} life of the Lisa, there were {{third-party}} hard disk drives, SCSI controllers, and double-sided 3½ inch floppy-disk upgrades. Unlike the original Macintosh, the Lisa features expansion slots. Like the Apple II, it was an [...] "open system". The Lisa 2 motherboard had a very basic backplane with virtually no electronic components, <b>but</b> <b>plenty</b> of edge connector sockets/slots. There were two RAM slots, one CPU slot and one I/O slot all in parallel placement to each other. At the other end, there were three [...] "Lisa" [...] slots, parallel to each other. This flexibility provided {{the potential for a}} developer to create a replacement for the CPU [...] "card" [...] to upgrade the Lisa to run a newer CPU, albeit with potential limitations {{from other parts of the}} system.|$|E

2500|$|The {{game has}} been {{originally}} {{being developed by}} Synthetic Dimensions (then functioning {{under the name of}} DCD, or Dimension Creative Design) as King Arthur: The Quest of The Fair Unknown. The development team boasted of having spent a full year researching for a preparatory work into the production. According to Synthetic Dimensions, they have discovered [...] "that there are few known facts, <b>but</b> <b>plenty</b> of mismatched half-truths, so the game sets out to detail a hitherto unheard part of the story." [...] In a mid-1994 version of the game, as shown to the Edge magazine, the player character was the titular Fair Unknown (Gingalain), sent to a Welsh castle to rescue a queen. Upon reaching the castle, the player had to battle various enemies, including a giant serpent, a pair of mages, and a few undead skeletons (sword fights against an enormous snake and the skeletons are actually featured in the final version, {{towards the end of the}} game in Morgana's castle). This initial mission completed, the player would then return to Camelot, [...] "where the real meat of the game begins" [...] (Chronicles of the Sword begins already in Camelot), and the game would also feature Merlin and Morgana.|$|E
2500|$|On 2 May 1945, Hatsutaka was escorting {{a tanker}} when {{attacked}} by [...] and [...] [...] At 2249, Hatsutaka detected Baya with her Type 22 radar and began closing. 2305, Baya fired two torpedoes at Hatsutaka, with both missing. [...] At 2307, Hatsutaka {{opened fire on}} Baya with [...] "20mm, 40mm, and 2 or 3 4.7 inch guns at range of 1100 yards." [...] and noted at 2308 that [...] "Jap gunnery poor <b>but</b> <b>plenty</b> of it. Tracers passing down {{both sides of the}} periscope shears and overhead. 4.7 inch appeared to be both common and fused, as it was ricochetting alongside and over the stern as well as bursting overhead which was thought at first to be starshells." [...] At 2309, Baya fired another three torpedoes, with Hatsutaka combing the tracks. When Hatsutaka turned on the searchlight at 2320, Baya submerged and fired another torpedo at her, missing again. At 2325, when Baya surfaced, she secured the searchlight and again commenced firing on Baya and dropped six depth charges at 2329, shaking Baya violently. [...] At 2333, the range opened and Baya informed Lagarto that she had been driven off by the escort's gunfire. Baya noted that [...] "It is nothing short of a miracle that we came through so much gunfire without a single hit. [...] His deflection was as consistently on as his range was off." ...|$|E
2500|$|Steve Juon of RapReviews said, [...] "Not every {{track on}} [...] "Lip Lock {{is a home}} run, but she bats for the cycle here and only strikes out a few times ("Keep Me From You" [...] is just too cotton candy for me). That's pretty {{incredible}} given how long she's been away. Who knows? Maybe she'll end up signing DMX to her imprint. She's got her life together, her businesses are successful, and she's still a bad bitch - but no longer afraid that showing her feminine side will make her come across soft or weak to a misogynistic audience. She can be the pitbull when necessary or the poodle when she feels like it and it's her flawless ability to switch it up that commands your attention." [...] Jim Farber of New York Daily News stated, [...] "To be specific, 11 long {{years have passed since}} the one-time Queen MC of Ruff Ryders Records completed a disc — 2002’s Eve-Olution. For the last six years, she’s been tinkering with tracks, leaking some out while experiencing increasing frustration with her label (Interscope). Small wonder the long-aborning Lip Lock appears on her own label. The lag may also explain why we’re hearing a more mature Eve here, less angry, more open to pop." [...] Elias Leight of PopMatters said, [...] "Eve tries to sound current—Lip Lock is consistently dense with electronics that nod to today’s pop-scape. No Neptunes and Dre here, <b>but</b> <b>plenty</b> of low frequency throbbing and high-pitched glitch noises. Eve doesn’t reach for the dance floor often, but this is hip-hop that acknowledges EDM and dub-step. There are a few songs that sound very different from the rest and instantly seem like outliers." ...|$|E
