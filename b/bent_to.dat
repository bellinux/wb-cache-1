5|$|Contrary to {{the flat}} {{appearance}} of the loudspeaker, all three panels are slightly curved along the vertical axis to improve quality. The panels themselves are flat, but obtain their curvature by being slightly <b>bent</b> <b>to</b> a curved backing. With the bipolar nature of the speaker emitting sound from both front and back surfaces as it does, {{the application of a}} felt sheet {{to the rear of the}} panels damps and absorbs high frequencies radiating from the back. A crossover network, set at 500Hz, remains necessary to adjust for back-to-front interference causing loss in output at low frequencies. In addition, the speaker should stand in free space to achieve optimum sound. The instructions book contains advice against placement of the speaker in corners or positions close to or parallel with walls, and further explains that a corner placement will adversely affect bass response and be detrimental to the midrange because of standing waves generated.|$|E
5|$|On 17 January 2011, Bent {{submitted}} a transfer request, amid reports that Aston Villa {{had made a}} club record £18million bid for him, which was rejected. Villa then {{submitted a}}n improved offer of £18million, potentially rising to £24million, which was then accepted. The following day, Bent completed his move to Villa and signed a four-and-a-half-year deal. He scored the winning goal on his debut against Manchester City in a 1–0 victory at Villa Park. Bent scored his second Villa goal in his third appearance for his team when he completed the full 90 minutes against Manchester United at Old Trafford in a 3–1 away defeat. Bent scored both of Villa's goals in their 2–1 away victory over Arsenal in the penultimate match of the season on 15 May. The first was a nicely crafted volley after he chested down a Kyle Walker chipped pass, with the second coming {{a few minutes later}} after a slip from Arsenal's Thomas Vermaelen allowed Ashley Young the time to thread a pass through the Gunners' defence and <b>Bent</b> <b>to</b> sidefoot home for 2–0. He finished the season with 9 goals in 16 Premier League appearances for Villa, becoming the club's joint top-scorer with Ashley Young, despite only joining in January. He was also the top English goalscorer in the Premier League and the fourth highest scorer overall that season with 17 goals, eight of which were scored for Sunderland.|$|E
25|$|The Rowland circle {{geometry}} {{ensures that}} the slits are both in focus, but {{in order for the}} Bragg condition to be met at all points, the crystal must first be <b>bent</b> <b>to</b> a radius of 2R (where R is the radius of the Rowland circle), then ground to a radius of R. This arrangement allows higher intensities (typically 8-fold) with higher resolution (typically 4-fold) and lower background. However, the mechanics of keeping Rowland circle geometry in a variable-angle monochromator is extremely difficult. In the case of fixed-angle monochromators (for use in simultaneous spectrometers), crystals <b>bent</b> <b>to</b> a logarithmic spiral shape give the best focusing performance. The manufacture of curved crystals to acceptable tolerances increases their price considerably.|$|E

50|$|This refusal, {{with other}} {{difficulties}} mounting between Macquarie {{and the two}} <b>Bents,</b> led <b>to</b> Macquarie writing to the British authorities asking for both of the <b>Bents</b> <b>to</b> be removed, to which Lord Bathurst agreed in January 1816. Whilst Bathurst agreed that ex-convicts should not practise, he also took {{the view that the}} absence of the sittings of the court was more serious an issue that admitting ex-convicts, and that the court should actually sit.|$|R

25|$|Staple repair is {{a similar}} {{technique}} used to repair broken ceramic pieces, where small holes are drilled {{on either side of}} a crack and metal staples are <b>bent</b> <b>to</b> hold the pieces together.

25|$|Recommendations {{had been}} made by Ellis <b>Bent</b> <b>to</b> the British {{authorities}} along those lines for reform of the courts in the colony. In 1814, the British sovereign established three new courts to replace the court. These were the Supreme Court of Civil Judicature, the Governors Court and the Lieutenant Governor's Court.

25|$|In the Caesalpinioideae, {{the flowers}} are often zygomorphic, as in Cercis, or nearly {{symmetrical}} with five equal petals in Bauhinia. The upper petal is the innermost one, unlike in the Faboideae. Some species, like some in the genus Senna, have asymmetric flowers, {{with one of the}} lower petals larger than the opposing one, and the style <b>bent</b> <b>to</b> one side.

In other Phidippus species, the female rejects the male by extending the first pair of legs whenever he approaches too closely, and merely fails to ward him off when she is ready to accept him.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{the rails}} used were flat-bottomed, 80lb per yard (90lb {{in areas where}} heavy wear was expected), spiked {{directly}} on to the sleepers of creosoted Baltic pine. Only the sharp curve at Shepherdswell had the rails <b>bent</b> <b>to</b> shape; elsewhere, short straight lengths were used on curves. Colonel Stephens obtained various job lots of rails from the salvage dump at Richborough Port, and these included 60lb rails which {{were used for the}} Wingham extension and the Richborough Port branch. The ballast used was colliery waste and ash. There was a universal speed restriction of 25mph.|$|E

The first Bermudian tour of England took place in 1960 and more tours followed. Bermuda also is the place where the first non-Yorkshireman played for Yorkshire County Cricket Club. Yorkshire traditionally had a rule that no-one born outside the county could play for them, a rule abandoned in the 1990s.

25|$|Fullerenes are stable, but {{not totally}} unreactive. The sp2-hybridized carbon atoms, which {{are at their}} energy minimum in planar graphite, must be <b>bent</b> <b>to</b> form the closed sphere or tube, which {{produces}} angle strain. The characteristic reaction of fullerenes is electrophilic addition at 6,6-double bonds, which reduces angle strain by changing sp2-hybridized carbons into sp3-hybridized ones. The change in hybridized orbitals causes the bond angles to decrease from about 120° in the sp2 orbitals to about 109.5° in the sp3 orbitals. This decrease in bond angles allows for the bonds to bend less when closing the sphere or tube, and thus, the molecule becomes more stable.|$|E
25|$|Life in the Iron Mills {{is set in}} a {{small village}} whose center is {{industrial}} work, especially that of the iron mills. It is described as a polluted and oppressive village, inhabited by laborers, mostly “masses of men, with dull, besotted faces <b>bent</b> <b>to</b> the ground, sharpened here and there by pain or cunning; skin and muscle and flesh begrimed with smoke and ashes”. The novella's protagonist is Hugh Wolfe, an iron mill laborer who possesses artistic talent and a spiritual desire for higher forms of pleasure and fulfillment. Despite the hopefulness of Wolfe’s artistic drive, he becomes the story's tragic hero, as his yearning for a better life leads to his imprisonment and ultimate death.|$|E

25|$|During {{the summer}} of 2004, despite the turmoil {{surrounding}} the club's recent form, Moyes managed to bring in Tim Cahill and Marcus <b>Bent.</b> <b>To</b> this day, Cahill {{is considered to be}} one of Moyes' best signings, scoring 15 goals in his first season playing for Everton. Those who left the club were Tomasz Radzinski, Tobias Linderoth, David Unsworth and, most significantly Wayne Rooney, who joined Manchester United for a reported £25.6million. Later, the Daily Mail published extracts from Rooney's autobiography, claiming that Moyes had forced Rooney out of the club and then leaked the details to the press. Moyes went on to sue for libel before settling out of court when Rooney apologised and agreed to pay for damages. Moyes donated the undisclosed damages from the suit to the Everton Former Players' Foundation.|$|E
25|$|Within Carlism, Araúz {{became a}} new rising figure. In the 1933 {{elections}} he successfully {{ran on the}} Carlist ticket from Granada. In the 1936 elections (also in Granada) he emerged victorious and was even nominated secretary of the Carlist parliamentary minority, but his mandate was cancelled due to alleged irregularities. Araúz conspired against the Republic as member of the La Ferme based Junta Nacional Carlista. Following the outbreak of hostilities he joined the Burgos-based Junta Carlista de Guerra and became head of its Guilds and Corporations section, sort of Carlist “ministry of labor” <b>bent</b> <b>to</b> build a syndical structure competitive to the Falangist scheme. Araúz co-engineered the raid of Aragonese Requetés who captured his native Molina de Aragon early August 1936; he later contributed to forming of the local Requeté battalion, Tercio de María de Molina.|$|E

Even though the TWU, in coalition with the Amalgamated Association, swept the election to determine which union should represent the IND's employees, the Board refused to bargain with it. La Guardia invited the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen to represent the motormen, but had to retreat when Roy Wilkins of the NAACP pointed out that this brotherhood did not allow African-American workers to join, while the TWU did. The union's organizing drive on the IND, however, stalled in the face of official opposition.|$|E
