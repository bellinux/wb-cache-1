500|$|Saadiq's songwriting is {{characterized}} by straightforward romanticism, positive exhortations, pining ballads, and message songs. Christgau interpreted Saadiq's persona on the album to be [...] "a romantic who stays true to the deliberate simplicity" [...] of the song titles, but [...] "never threatens to assume the fetal position if he doesn't get the extreme cuddling he craves." [...] Patrick Varine of the Observer-Dispatch asserted that Saadiq deviates significantly from contemporary R lyrics: [...] "there are no thinly-veiled food-sex metaphors or pimp fantasies". His songwriting also paraphrases classic soul lyrics and, on the album's slower songs, expresses tightly coiled emotions. Saadiq said that some songs were written about his life experiences. He described the album as [...] "basically a series of love songs about music, how falling in love can be easy, but staying true to it can be tricky." [...] He elaborated on this interpretation in an interview for the Chicago Tribune: [...] "You {{have to watch out}} for those curves. [...] music comes out, and how do you stay true to what you love? I’m not saying everything has to sound like a '60s record to stay true, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> never take the relationship lightly." ...|$|E
500|$|John Kricfalusi, {{the creator}} of The Ren & Stimpy Show, claimed the Mr. Hankey concept was stolen from his cartoon short, [...] "Nutty the Friendly Dump", {{which was part of}} a cartoon book series {{viewable}} online. Kricfalusi said after the show aired, [...] "I got nine or 10 messages from friends screaming, 'I can't believe this! They totally stole your story!'... This idea of [...] singing or dancing and being friends, well, that is my idea." [...] Kricfalusi said he felt other elements of South Park were lifted from his work, and he told media outlets his company Spümcø was contemplating taking legal action against Parker and Stone. Comedy Central spokesman Tony Fox said Stone and Parker were not familiar with [...] "Nutty the Friendly Dump" [...] and that the claim was [...] "ludicrous". Parker said he had never seen more than half an episode of Ren & Stimpy, which {{he said he did not}} enjoy because the characters were too over-the-top and the voice acting was too annoying. Parker said Kricfalusi eventually contacted the South Park creators: [...] "He wrote a letter back saying, 'Oh, OK, I see how it could just be a coincidence, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> just admit to the press that you're a big Ren and Stimpy fan.' — I'm not a Ren and Stimpy fan." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{had his own}} {{idiosyncratic}} vocabulary: Although an agnostic atheist, {{he spoke}} of [...] "The Book", a visualization of a book in which God had written down {{the best and most}} elegant proofs for mathematical theorems. Lecturing in 1985 he said, [...] "You don't have to believe in God, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> believe in The Book." [...] He himself doubted the existence of God, whom he called the [...] "Supreme Fascist" [...] (SF). He accused SF of hiding his socks and Hungarian passports, and of keeping the most elegant mathematical proofs to Himself. When he saw a particularly beautiful mathematical proof he would exclaim, [...] "This one's from The Book!" [...] This later inspired a book titled Proofs from the Book.|$|E

2500|$|The next Soviet {{offensive}} {{began in}} February 1940. The heavy artillery support allowed the Soviet forces to breach the Mannerheim Line. Meretskov's 7th Army proceeded to take Viborg which so far had resisted attempts of Soviet conquest. Less {{than two weeks}} after the signing of the Moscow Peace Treaty, on March 21, 1940 Meretskov was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. Afterwards, Meretskov was promoted to rank of army general and made Deputy Commissar of Defense. From August 1940 to January 1941 he was Chief of the General Staff. He was dismissed on 14 January 1941, and on 24 January, Stalin spotted him at the Bolshoi and, in front of witnesses: [...] "You are courageous, capable, but without principles, spineless. You want to be nice, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> have a plan instead and adhere to it strictly, despite the fact that someone or other is going to be resentful." ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 14, 2004, the Iranian {{government}} rejected {{requests for}} Canadian government observers {{to attend the}} trial, despite promises and assurances by the Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi and judiciary officials to the Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs Bill Graham. The same day, Graham recalled the ambassador at Tehran, Philip MacKinnon. MacKinnon, together with the Dutch ambassador (representing the European Union) and diplomats from the British and French embassies, were later allowed to attend the July 17 trial, though not the July 18 one. Judge Farahani was quoted on July 18 as saying that [...] "(he) made a mistake yesterday. The bar is {{to show the world}} that Iran won't bow under pressure." [...] Hamid Reza Assefi, the spokesman for the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said [...] "We hadn't permitted an observer from the beginning. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> ask the reason for the ban from the court, {{there may have been a}} shortage of seats." [...] Assefi also said that since Iran does not recognize dual nationality and Kazemi was an Iranian citizen who entered the country under an Iranian passport, never having requested her citizenship to be removed, that the case was clearly an internal affair.|$|E
