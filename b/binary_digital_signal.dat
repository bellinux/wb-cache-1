If the signal source is in digital form, such as in a digital media player or computer sound card, the digital circuitry can convert the <b>binary</b> <b>digital</b> <b>signal</b> directly to a pulse-width modulation signal that is applied to the amplifier, simplifying the circuitry considerably.|$|E

Since the sound waves propagated from different transducers carry different bit streams and travel different path lengths to the listening position, a nonuniform sound field will be generated in space. Further analysis also showed that there is significant harmonic distortion in the digital array sound field, which is dependent on the bit drive sequence.

The method is applied to a single microring modulator to provide an M-bit digital-toanalog converter (DAC), which may also be viewed as an M-level pulse amplitude modulator (M-PAM). It is shown, by means of simulation, that a 4 -bit DAC can achieve an effective number of bits (ENOB) of 3. 74 bits.

40|$|Abstract—In {{order to}} simplify the device of {{modulation}} and demodulation of 2 FSK, a 2 FSK modem based on the microcontroller AT 89 C 51 was designed. This modem is mainly composed of an AT 89 C 51 microcontroller, a simple two order passive low-pass filter, and a shaping circuit. Modulation is achieved {{on the basis of}} the principle of pulse width modulation (PWM). By executing PWM signal generating program, a digital base band signal is converted into the corresponding PWM signal after it is input into an I/O port of the microcontroller. Then the PWM signal is outputted from another I/O port and sent into the two order passive low-pass filter. On the output side of the filter, the 2 FSK signal can be obtained. For demodulation, the 2 FSK signal shaped by the shaping circuit is input into microcontroller from its I/O port. Then the widths of positive and negative half-waves are measured by the microcontroller internal timer. By comparing the value of each width with the appropriate threshold value, the <b>binary</b> <b>digital</b> <b>signal</b> is gotten and outputted from another I/O port of microcontroller. This modem makes full use of the resources of the microcontroller. As a result, it is simple, easy to use, economical and reliable. Furthermore, it can generate and demodulate the 2 FSK signal with high good accuracy...|$|E

Therefore, two rectilinear projections are added to the system in order to correct this ambiguous image. However, the rectilinear projection only acts as a mask. Thus, converting the analog signals from the rectilinear sensors into <b>binary</b> <b>digital</b> <b>signals</b> is already sufficient...|$|R

Various network technologies find use in the digital television production and transmission of <b>digital</b> television <b>signals.</b> All transmission media are analog channels, but <b>binary</b> <b>digital</b> <b>signals</b> are so tolerant of channel characteristics that they are easily handled. The capability of most communication channels is much greater than what binary transmission requires.

30|$|In this paper, {{in order}} to {{compress}} the image, we have aimed to propose an advanced model-based CS, named K-cluster-valued CS, which utilizes K-means algorithm {{as the model for}} CS. In contrast to conventional CS, the proposed K-cluster-valued CS incorporates the prior knowledge that only K clusters values of intensities are available for all the pixels of an image. In this paper, we also investigated cluster number K as prior knowledge. Such prior knowledge goes beyond the simple sparsity/compressibility of CS and therefore has the advantage in using fewer measurements than conventional CS for accurate image reconstruction. This way, K-cluster-valued CS is applicable to other K-cluster-valued <b>signals</b> (e.g., <b>binary</b> <b>digital</b> <b>signals)</b> besides the images. Also, it is applicable to other model-based CS by considering all the prior knowledge together. Moreover, the experiments were performed and presented to validate the proposed approach.|$|R
40|$|The {{parametric}} phase-locked oscillator (PPLO), {{also known}} as a parametron, is a resonant circuit in which one of the reactances is periodically modulated. It can detect, amplify, and store <b>binary</b> <b>digital</b> <b>signals</b> in the form of two distinct phases of self-oscillation. Indeed, digital computers using PPLOs based on a magnetic ferrite ring or a varactor diode as its fundamental logic element were successfully operated in 1950 s and 1960 s. More recently, basic bit operations have been demonstrated in an electromechanical resonator, and an Ising machine based on optical PPLOs has been proposed. Here, using a PPLO realized with Josephson-junction circuitry, we demonstrate the demodulation of a microwave signal digitally modulated by binary phase-shift keying. Moreover, we apply this demodulation capability to the dispersive readout of a superconducting qubit. This readout scheme enables a fast and latching-type readout, yet requires {{only a small number of}} readout photons in the resonator to which the qubit is coupled, thus featuring the combined advantages of several disparate schemes. We have achieved high-fidelity, single-shot, and non-destructive qubit readout with Rabi-oscillation contrast exceeding 90 %, limited primarily by the qubit's energy relaxation.

40|$|A <b>digital</b> {{communications}} <b>signal</b> is a sinusoidal waveform that is {{modified by}} a <b>binary</b> (<b>digital)</b> information <b>signal.</b> The sinusoidal waveform {{is called the}} carrier. The carrier may be modified in amplitude, frequency, phase, {{or a combination of}} these. In this project a binary phase shift keyed (BPSK) signal is the communication signal. In a BPSK signal the phase of the carrier is set to one of two states, 180 degrees apart, by a binary (i. e., 1 or 0) information <b>signal.</b> A <b>digital</b> <b>signal</b> is a sampled version of a "real world" time continuous <b>signal.</b> The <b>digital</b> <b>signal</b> is generated by sampling the continuous signal at discrete points in time. The rate at which the signal is sampled is called the sampling rate (f(s)). The device that performs this operation is called an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter or a digitizer. The <b>digital</b> <b>signal</b> is composed of the sequence of individual values of the sampled BPSK <b>signal.</b> <b>Digital</b> <b>signal</b> processing (DSP) is the modification of the <b>digital</b> <b>signal</b> by mathematical operations.

Up to 32 line modules are connected to a digital concentrator switch unit using 2 Mbit/s paths, giving each concentrator a capacity of up to 2048 subscriber lines. The digital concentrator switch multiplexes the signals from the line modules using time-division multiplexing and concentrates the signals onto 30 time slots on up to 32-channel high speed paths for connection to the digital local switching unit via the digital line termination units.
