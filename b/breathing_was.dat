5|$|Alive or Just <b>Breathing</b> <b>was</b> {{mixed in}} February 2002 at Backstage Productions in Ripley, Derbyshire, UK by Andy Sneap. Dutkiewicz brought the album to the UK and oversaw the mixing process. The band chose Sneap after hearing {{good things about}} his work.

5|$|Alive or Just Breathing is {{the second}} studio album by American metalcore band Killswitch Engage. It was {{released}} on May 21, 2002, through Roadrunner Records. Alive or Just <b>Breathing</b> <b>was</b> Killswitch Engage's first album on Roadrunner and was recorded from October 2001 to February 2002. Produced by drummer and guitarist Adam Dutkiewicz, this was the band's first album on a major label, which prompted them to write and record the album {{to the best of}} their abilities. Alive or Just Breathing has been viewed as a landmark album in the metalcore genre and was well praised upon its release by fans and critics. The lyrics, which were all written by vocalist Jesse Leach, were intended to bring a positive message through the music.|$|E
5|$|In early March 1704 Beatrix Laing {{approached}} Patrick Morton, a 16-year-old {{working in}} his father's smithy, {{to ask if he}} would make her some nails. Morton refused as he was already assigned an urgent task making nails for a merchant's ship in the harbour. Displeased, Laing left threatening revenge on him. The following day Morton noticed a bucket filled with water and burning coal outside Laing's house; he thought it was there to cast a spell on him. Laing had a reputation as a witch having already appeared before the Kirk session in 1696 for charming. Morton immediately felt weak and had difficulty standing or walking. His health deteriorated; he began to have fits and convulsions, his stomach became distended and his body was rigid and twisted. People claimed they could see marks left on his skin by fingernails where Morton said he had been pinched. He refused food and his <b>breathing</b> <b>was</b> laboured.|$|E
50|$|Respiratory pattern (<b>breathing</b> rhythm) <b>is</b> {{significant}} {{and should be}} noted in a comatose patient. Certain stereotypical patterns of <b>breathing</b> have <b>been</b> identified including Cheyne-Stokes, a form of breathing in which the patient's <b>breathing</b> pattern <b>is</b> described as alternating episodes of hyperventilation and apnea. This is a dangerous pattern and is often seen in pending herniations, extensive cortical lesions, or brainstem damage. Another pattern of <b>breathing</b> <b>is</b> apneustic <b>breathing,</b> which <b>is</b> characterized by sudden pauses of Inhalation and {{is due to a}} lesion of the pons. Ataxic <b>breathing</b> <b>is</b> irregular and is due to a lesion (damage) of the medulla.|$|R
30|$|Peak inspiratory {{pressure}} (PIP) is {{the pressure}} which is delivered by ventilator. Dynamic distending pressure of T-piece <b>breathing</b> <b>is</b> equivalent of Pmus of T-piece breathing, because T-piece <b>breathing</b> <b>is</b> not under pressure support.|$|R
5000|$|Room to Breathe {{received}} generally favourable reviews. JesusfreakHideout gave it 4 {{stars and}} said [...] "Room to <b>Breathe</b> <b>is</b> as relevant and bold as ever". CCM also gave it high ratings saying [...] "Room to <b>Breathe</b> <b>is</b> a solid, wisely produced collection".|$|R
25|$|As {{an initial}} letter in Classical Greek it always carried the rough {{breathing}} (equivalent to h) {{as reflected in}} the many Greek-derived English words, such as those that begin with hyper- and hypo-. This rough <b>breathing</b> <b>was</b> derived from an older pronunciation that used a sibilant instead; this sibilant was not lost in Latin, giving rise to such cognates as super- (for hyper-) and sub- (for hypo-).|$|E
25|$|The {{procedure}} {{has been}} used since the beginnings of recreational diving, and along with the free ascent {{was one of the}} ways a diver could respond to running out of air at depth. At this time twin-hose regulators were the norm. and it was reasonably easy for two divers in a face-to-face position to share the regulator mouthpiece. Buddy <b>breathing</b> <b>was</b> an important skill before reserve valves and submersible pressure gauges were generally available, and running out of air was so common that it was not considered an emergency. By the mid-1960s the availability of submersible pressure gauges made reliable air supply monitoring possible and running out of air became less common.|$|E
25|$|After {{finishing}} his medical {{studies in the}} University of London, he earned his MD in 1844. Snow set up his practice at 54 Frith Street in Soho as a surgeon and general practitioner. John Snow contributed {{to a wide range}} of medical concerns including anaesthesiology. He was a member of the Westminster Medical Society, an organisation dedicated to clinical and scientific demonstrations. Snow gained prestige and recognition all the while being able to experiment and pursue many of his scientific ideas. He was a speaker multiple times at the society’s meetings and he also wrote and published articles. He was especially interested on patients with respiratory diseases and tested his hypothesis through animal studies. In 1841, he wrote, On Asphyxiation, and on the Resuscitation of Still-Born Children, which is an article that discusses his discoveries on the physiology of neonatal respiration, oxygen consumption and the effects of body temperature change. Therefore, his interest in anaesthesia and <b>breathing</b> <b>was</b> evident since 1841 and beginning in 1843, Snow experimented with ether to see its effects on respiration. Only a year after ether was introduced to Britain, in 1847, he published a short work titled, On the Inhalation of the Vapor of Ether, which served as a guide for its use. At the same time, he worked on various papers that reported his clinical experience with anaesthesia, noting reactions, procedures and experiments.|$|E
50|$|Spontaneous <b>breathing</b> <b>is</b> {{defined as}} the {{movement}} of gas {{in and out of}} the lungs that is produced in response to an individual's respiratory muscles. In a nutshell, spontaneous <b>breathing</b> <b>is</b> natural <b>breathing.</b> while at rest, a typical adult will take an average of 18 breaths per minute. Most people are unaware of their breathing patterns unless something interferes with the efficiency of this process. In extreme cases, mechanical ventilation is used when spontaneous <b>breathing</b> <b>is</b> inadequate or ceases entirely.|$|R
50|$|<b>Breathe</b> <b>was</b> {{director}} Nicholas Winter's debut feature film. Winter {{also wrote}} the screenplay, shot and edited the film. As the storyline is based around Bailey's life in London, the film features much of London's picturesque skylines and scenery. <b>Breathe</b> <b>was</b> also filmed in Scotland and Somerset.|$|R
30|$|The {{condition}} of exclusive oral <b>breathing</b> <b>is</b> rare; alternation between OB and NB {{is much more}} common. The boundary between the air passages for OB and NB is small, and sometimes, even though the nasal air passages are of normal size, nasal <b>breathing</b> <b>is</b> replaced by oral [3, 16].|$|R
500|$|As Killswitch Engage {{started writing}} for Alive or Just Breathing, then-guitarist Pete Cortese, who co-wrote [...] "Fixation on the Darkness", left the band {{to spend more}} with his family. The music for Alive or Just <b>Breathing</b> <b>was</b> all written by Dutkiewicz, D'Antonio, and guitarist Joel Stroetzel, while all of the lyrics were written by singer Jesse Leach. [...] After {{completing}} the composition for the album, the band knew {{they would need to}} find a second guitarist to play with Stroetzel, because Alive or Just <b>Breathing</b> <b>was</b> written for two guitarists during live performances.|$|E
500|$|Leale {{entered the}} box to find Lincoln seated with his head leaning to his right as Mary held him and sobbed: [...] "His eyes were closed {{and he was in}} a profoundly {{comatose}} condition, while his <b>breathing</b> <b>was</b> intermittent and exceedingly stertorous." [...] Thinking Lincoln had been stabbed, Leale shifted him to the floor. Meanwhile, another physician, Charles Sabin Taft, was lifted from the stage into the box.|$|E

50|$|Evaluation of an {{unconscious}} patients <b>breathing</b> <b>is</b> often {{performed by the}} look, listen, and feel method. The ear is placed over person's mouth so <b>breathing</b> can <b>be</b> heard and felt while looking for rising chest or abdomen. The procedure should not take longer than 10 seconds. As in conscious patients stridor can be heard {{if there is an}} airway obstruction. Back fall of the tongue however results in snoring. In the unconscious patient agonal <b>breathing</b> <b>is</b> often mistaken for airway obstructions. If there is respiratory arrest or agonal <b>breathing</b> CPR <b>is</b> indicated.|$|R

50|$|Diaphragmatic breathing, or deep <b>breathing</b> <b>is</b> <b>breathing</b> that <b>is</b> done by {{contracting}} the diaphragm, {{a muscle}} located horizontally between the thoracic cavity and abdominal cavity. Air enters the lungs and the chest rises and the belly expands during {{this type of}} breathing.Diaphragmatic <b>breathing</b> <b>is</b> also known scientifically as eupnea, which is a natural and relaxed form of breathing in all mammals. Eupnea occurs in mammals whenever {{they are in a}} state of relaxation, i.e. when there is no clear and present danger in their environment.|$|R
500|$|... "The End of Heartache" [...] {{became the}} main single {{for the movie}} , and in 2005 the song was {{nominated}} for Best Metal Performance for the 47th Grammy Awards. In late 2004, The End of Heartache was re-released as a special edition album, with a second disc featuring various live performances, a Japanese bonus track, and a re-recorded version of [...] "Irreversal". During the summer of 2005, the band returned for Ozzfest, and on November 1, 2005, Alive or Just <b>Breathing</b> <b>was</b> re-released as part of Roadrunner Records' 25th anniversary. On November 22, 2005, the live DVD (Set This) World Ablaze was released, which contained a live concert at the Palladium in Worcester, Massachusetts, an hour-long documentary, and all the band's music videos. The DVD was certified gold in the US on April 8, 2006.|$|E

500|$|Ellen became {{something}} of a tourist attraction for Turville.

Some paid to take cuts of Ellen's hair, until the [...] "supply" [...] began to run out. A Bucks Free Press journalist recounted his visit: Her <b>breathing</b> <b>was</b> regular and natural, the skin soft and the body warm, as in a healthy subject; the pulse rather fast. The hands were small and thin, but the fingers quite flexible; the body somewhat emaciated; the feet and legs like those of a dead child, almost ice cold... the aspect of her features was pleasant, more so than might be expected under the circumstances... her eyes and cheeks were sunken, and the appearance was that of death... but although there was no colour on her cheeks, the paleness was not that heavy hue which betokens death.|$|E

50|$|Body {{language}} {{related to}} breathing {{and patterns of}} <b>breathing</b> can <b>be</b> indicative of a person's mood and state of mind; due to this, the relationship between body language and <b>breathing</b> <b>is</b> often considered in contexts such as business meetings and presentations. Generally, deeper breathing which utilises the diaphragm and abdomen more is interpreted as conveying a relaxed and confident impression; by contrast, shallow, excessively rapid <b>breathing</b> <b>is</b> often interpreted as conveying a more nervous or anxious impression.|$|R

500|$|Alive or Just <b>Breathing</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} on May 21, 2002. Killswitch Engage filmed a music video {{for the song}} [...] "My Last Serenade", which gained heavy rotation on MTV's Headbanger's Ball and propelled the album to number 37 on Billboards Top Heatseekers chart. Alive or Just Breathing also stayed at number one on CMJ's Loud Rock radio chart for over a month. By the time the band's third album, The End of Heartache was released, Alive or Just Breathing sold 114,000 copies in the United States. Music videos were also filmed for [...] "Life to Lifeless" [...] and [...] "Fixation on the Darkness". Upon {{the release of the}} album, Killswitch Engage embarked on their first nationwide tour, supporting Soilwork and Hypocrisy and would tour for the next year in support of Alive or Just Breathing. Other legs of the tour featured the band touring with acts such as Kittie, Poison the Well, Shadows Fall, and Hotwire.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} of Alive or Just <b>Breathing</b> <b>was</b> generally positive. Erik Thomas from Metalreview.com said [...] "while this album certainly {{is responsible for}} the vast amount of saturation, it stands as a pretty trendsetting, stellar must-own example of metalcore." [...] Jason D. Taylor of AllMusic stated [...] "This is a pure metal album that seemingly has ignored any fashionable trend and instead relies solely on skill and expertise to sculpt some of meatiest heavy metal since the glory days of Metallica and Slayer." [...] Taylor also expressed the impressiveness of the band's [...] "do-it-yourself" [...] work ethic as Dutkiewicz handled all production and D'Antonio [...] "took the time to give much thought on the album's packaging and art direction." [...] Dom Lawson of Kerrang! magazine gave the album five [...] "Ks" [...] (or five out of five stars). He praised the album's unique new sound, music, and vocal performances from Leach. Kevin Boyce of CMJ said, [...] "This album is more addictive than crack cocaine that's been smothered in caffeine and nicotine and drenched with chocolate. Starting with the track 'Numbered Days,' this 12-track platter never takes its foot off of the throttle." [...] Boyce also stated his favorite song from the album was [...] "My Last Serenade," [...] and applauded [...] "Just Barely Breathing," [...] comparing parts of it to Metallica's Ride the Lightning.|$|E
2500|$|In general, {{substances}} that burned in air {{were said to}} be rich in phlogiston; the fact that combustion soon ceased in an enclosed space was taken as clear-cut evidence that air had the capacity to absorb only a finite amount of phlogiston. When air had become completely phlogisticated it would no longer serve to support combustion of any material, nor would a metal heated in it yield a calx; nor could phlogisticated air support life. [...] <b>Breathing</b> <b>was</b> thought to take phlogiston out of the body.|$|E

2500|$|Previously, the {{guidelines}} {{indicated that a}} pulse check should be performed after the <b>breathing</b> <b>was</b> assessed, and this made up the 'circulation' part of the initialism, but this pulse check is no longer recommended for lay rescuers. [...] Some trainers continue to use 'circulation' as the label for the third step in the process, since performing chest compressions is effectively artificial circulation, and when assessing patients who are breathing, assessing 'circulation' is still important. [...] However, some trainers now use the C to mean 'Compressions' in their basic first aid training.|$|E
2500|$|The {{difference}} {{was in the}} manner in which the detainees' <b>breathing</b> <b>was</b> obstructed. At the SERE school and in the DoJ opinion, the subject's airflow is disrupted by the firm application of a damp cloth over the air passages; the interrogator applies a small amount of water to the cloth in a controlled manner. By contrast, the Agency interrogator ... applied large volumes of water to a cloth that covered the detainee's mouth and nose. One of the psychiatrist / interrogators acknowledged that the Agency's use of the technique is different from that used in SERE training because it is 'for real' and is more poignant and convincing.|$|E
