50|$|In 1855 the Company made a loss, of £548. This {{was taken}} hard, {{although}} it was {{brought about by the}} considerable expenditure on one-off items (charged to current account) — the locomotives and rolling stock, the work on the Wheal <b>Busy</b> <b>extension,</b> and major repairs to the company's steam tug, kept at Devoran.|$|E

They are all {{children}} of the camel-nosed dhow, who {{is the mother of}} mischief; but it was very good to meet them again in raw sunshine, unchanged in any rope and patch.|$|R
40|$|Bacterial wilt (Ralstonia solanacearum) is {{a serious}} disease of potato. It can be managed with {{cultural}} practices, but only if farmers understand the technologies, and the reasons behind them. Face-to-face extension methods, like farmer field school (FFS), can teach these messages to smallholders, but other methods may also be useful. This paper compares FFS with two less-costly methods: “community workshops ” and radio, and presents follow up surveys of these three extension methods. Community workshops were almost as effective as FFS for teaching most ideas; radio spots were less effective, especially for ideas that require demonstration, but they reach a much larger audience. The three extension methods gave the most different results for time-consuming technologies, where a more compelling demonstration may convince farmers to adopt a task that adds work to an already <b>busy</b> day. <b>Extension</b> methods should be chosen for the particular context. The more complicated, tedious, and counter-intuitive a new technology is, the more important {{it may be to}} use a more intensive intimate extension method and the less likely that a mass media will be successful...|$|R
40|$|In 2016, the International Space Station (ISS) {{partnership}} {{published the}} first-ever compilation of international ISS research publications resulting from research {{performed on the}} ISS through 2011 (Expeditions 0 through 30). International Space Station Research Accomplishments: An Analysis of Results. From 2000 - 2011 {{is a collection of}} over 1, 200 journal publications that describe ISS research in the areas of biology and biotechnology; Earth and space science; educational activities and outreach; human research; physical sciences; technology development and demonstration; and, results from ISS operations. This paper will summarize the ISS results publications obtained through 2011 on behalf of the ISS Program Science Forum that is made up of senior science representatives across the international partnership. NASA's ISS Program Science office maintains an online experiment database (www. nasa. gov/iss- science) that tracks and communicates ISS research activities across the entire ISS partnership, and it is continuously updated by cooperation and linking with the results tracking activities of each partner. It captures ISS experiment summaries and results and includes citations to the journals, conference proceedings, and patents as they become available. This content is obtained through extensive and regular journal and patent database searches, and input provided by the ISS international partners ISS scientists themselves. The International Space Station Research Accomplishments: An Analysis of Results From 2000 - 2011 {{is a testament to the}} research that was underway even as the ISS laboratory was being built. It rejects the scientific knowledge gained from ISS research, and how it impact the fields of science in both space and traditional science disciplines on Earth. Now, during a time when utilization is at its <b>busiest,</b> and with <b>extension</b> of the ISS through at least 2024, the ISS partners work together to track the accomplishments and the new knowledge gained in a way that will impact humanity like no laboratory on Earth. Examples of the highest pro le publications to date from each discipline will also be presented. As ISS research activities and operations continue, scientific data derived from earlier experiments will continuously be re-examined, refined, and assembled with new data and findings, including data from other fields never considered. New results will be produced, allowing breakthroughs in new areas of research and innovative solutions to problems on Earth. The ISS Program Science Forum will continue to capture and report on these results in the form of journal publications, conference proceedings, and patents. We anticipate that successful ISS research will continue to contribute to the science literature in a way that helps to formulate new hypotheses and conclusions that will enable science advancements across a wide range of scientific disciplines both in space and on Earth...|$|R
