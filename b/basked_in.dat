Mercury once said of himself: [...] "When I'm performing I'm an extrovert, yet inside I'm a completely different man." [...] While on stage, Mercury <b>basked</b> <b>in</b> the love from his audience; Kurt Cobain's suicide note mentions how he admired and envied the way Mercury [...] "seemed to love, relish in the love and adoration from the crowd".|$|E

[...] Several days before the indictment was unsealed, Burdge was interviewed by FBI agents who asked her about her brother and informed her Hastert was about to be indicted on federal charges. Neither Reinboldt nor Burdge are [...] "Individual A" [...] named in the indictment, but Burdge believes that [...] "Individual A" [...] is familiar with what happened with her brother.

Matt Kivel of Variety said, [...] "the crowd reacted wildly to all of it: screaming out the chorus to 'I'm a Slave 4 U,' pulsating along to the twitch of 'Gimme More' and going absolutely ballistic for the brief, two-verse rendition of '...Baby One More Time.'" [...] Craig S. Semon of Telegram & Gazette called it the most over the top number of the show, adding, [...] "She delivered the banal, brain-numbing chorus [...] while her dancers (looking like extras from 'Stargate') paraded around in Egyptian garb and <b>basked</b> <b>in</b> the glow of pyrotechnic sparks."

2500|$|By 1912, Stroescu {{was living}} in Lausanne, but still {{appeared}} incognito to celebrate the golden jubilee of Petru Maior Society in Budapest. However, he was expressing his disenchantment with his Transylvanian colleagues. His letters to his fund's beneficiaries often included [...] "drastic reprimands." [...] In early 1913, he published a piece in the newspaper Românul of Arad, attacking Romanian banks for paying dividends higher than 5%, and their clients for accepting them; the difference, he argued, could go toward sponsoring culture. Responding to this [...] "judicious and unusually categorical" [...] critique, the economist Ion Mateiu suggested that the reduction demanded by Stroescu was needlessly abrupt. Stroescu, who donated 50,000 Kronen to settling disputes between ASTRA and the popular banks, {{and then to the}} creation of alternative credit unions, found sympathy with the writing team at Luceafărul, which <b>basked</b> <b>in</b> his critique of [...] "our petty bourgeoisie [...] its plutocratic ideals". Through ASTRA, he also distributed his brochure Statutele și îndrumările pentru băncile poporale ("Statutes and Guiding for the People's Banks"). The Bihar County bankers objected to such initiatives, seeing Stroescu as an unfair competitor to their business.|$|E

2500|$|By far {{the largest}} {{military}} action in which the United States engaged during this era was the War of 1812. With Britain locked in a major war with Napoleon's France, its policy was to block American [...] shipments to France. The United States sought to remain neutral while pursuing overseas trade. Britain cut the trade and impressed seamen on American ships into the Royal Navy, despite intense protests. Britain supported an Indian insurrection in the American Midwest, {{with the goal of}} creating an Indian state there that would block American expansion. The United States finally declared war on the United Kingdom in 1812, the first time the U.S. had officially declared war. Not hopeful of defeating the Royal Navy, the U.S. attacked the British Empire by invading British Canada, hoping to use captured territory as a bargaining chip. The invasion of Canada was a debacle, though concurrent wars with Native Americans on the western front (Tecumseh's War and the Creek War) were more successful. After defeating Napoleon in 1814, Britain sent large veteran armies to invade New York, raid Washington and capture the key control of the Mississippi River at New Orleans. The New York invasion was a fiasco after the much larger British army retreated to Canada. The raiders succeeded in the burning of Washington on 25 August 1814, but were repulsed in their Chesapeake Bay Campaign at the Battle of Baltimore and the British commander killed. The major invasion in Louisiana was stopped by a one-sided military battle that killed the top three British generals and thousands of soldiers. The winners were the commanding general of the Battle of New Orleans, Major General Andrew Jackson, who became president and the Americans who <b>basked</b> <b>in</b> a victory over a much more powerful nation. The peace treaty proved successful, and the U.S. and Britain never again went to war. The losers were the Indians, who never gained the independent territory in the Midwest promised by Britain.|$|E

"Basking in reflected glory" (BIRG) is {{the tendency to}} create, magnify or promote one's association with successful or desirable others. This tendency {{has been linked to}} some of the more prominent motivational drives researched in social psychology over the 20 th century, including the drive to maintain cognitive consistency, the drive to be viewed positively by others (i. e., impression management), and the drive to maintain positive self-esteem. This research represents the first attempt to systematically investigate the effects of <b>basking</b> <b>in</b> reflected glory on self-esteem. In doing so, this research will rely not only on self-report measures of self-esteem, but also on a research paradigm designed to document self-esteem involvement in the absence of self-report assessment. Study 1 is a conceptual replication of prior <b>basking</b> <b>in</b> reflected glory research that includes the self-reported self-esteem. The study replicates the <b>basking</b> <b>in</b> reflected glory effect, but does not document any effect on self-esteem. Studies 2 and 3 are an attempt to demonstrate that BIRG affects self-esteem by showing that other self-esteem palliatives reduce the tendency to <b>bask</b> <b>in</b> reflected glory (Study 2), and that <b>basking</b> <b>in</b> reflected glory reduces the tendency to use other self-esteem palliatives. Studies 2 and 3 did show this substitution of self-esteem palliatives, yet continue to show no self-reported effects on self-esteem. In short, mixed results leave the self-esteem role of BIRG uncertain. The implications of these findings for <b>basking</b> <b>in</b> reflected glory, and more broadly, the self-esteem motive, are discussed...|$|R
