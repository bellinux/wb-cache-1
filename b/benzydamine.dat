Please note there is an error in this section: US3318905 states that the nitroso derivative is reduced with sodium hydrosulfite (sodium dithionite) and not with sodium hyposulfite (sodium thiosulfate), as shown in the above scheme and stated in text. An interesting alternative synthesis of this substance starts by sequential reaction of N-benzylaniline with phosgene, and then with sodium azide to product the corresponding carbonyl azide. On heating, nitrogen is evolved and a separatable mixture of nitrene insertion product and the desired ketoindazole # results. The latter reaction appears to be a Curtius rearrangement type product to produce an N-isocyanate #, which then cyclizes.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Benzydamine,</b> a non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID) in use {{for more}} than four decades, has been reported to cause photosensitivity. OBJECTIVES: To study the results of photopatch testing to <b>benzydamine</b> and the clinical features of the dermatitis during a 3 -year period (2006 - 2008). PATIENTS AND METHODS: During this period, 74 patients with photodermatoses were photopatch tested with an extended baseline series of allergens including <b>benzydamine</b> and in suspicious cases, with drugs that contain it. Test sites were irradiated on D 2 with 5 J/cm(2) and readings were performed on D 2 and D 4. RESULTS: Ten patients (six females/four males), aged 21 - 84 years (mean 64. 9) had a positive photopatch test to <b>benzydamine</b> [1 - 5 % petrolatum (pet.) from Bial-Aristegui] and to drugs that contain it (Tantum verde oral solution and Momen gel). Nine patients had lower lip cheilitis and one lichenified eczema on photo-exposed sites. CONCLUSION: Photosensitivity from both topical and systemic <b>benzydamine</b> has been occasionally described, mainly in southern Spain. Despite its widespread use and its known photosensitizing capacity, photoallergic contact dermatitis from <b>benzydamine</b> is probably underdiagnosed as the clinical presentation of mainly the lip and chin is not typical of photoallergic contact dermatitis and <b>benzydamine</b> is not part of most photoallergen series...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} was aimed to {{investigate}} the effect of <b>benzydamine,</b> an anti-inflammatory drug devoid of activity on arachidonic acid metabolism, on monocyte chemotaxis and to define the possible biochemical correlates of activity. <b>Benzydamine</b> inhibited monocyte chemotaxis in response to three classes of chemoattractants: the prototypic CC-chemokine CCL 2 (MCP- 1), the microbial product fMLP and the complement cascade component C 5 a. The effect was dose-dependent with IC 50 's of 100, 50 and 45 μM for MCP- 1 /CCL 2, fMLP and C 5 a, respectively. At the dose of 100 μM, the effect resulted in a 50 ± 10 % inhibition of MCP- 1 /CCL 2 -induced chemotaxis and 53 ± 6 and 54 ± 5 % inhibitions of chemotaxis in response of fMLP and C 5 a, respectively (n= 3). Receptor expression as well as calcium fluxes in response to chemoattractants were not affected by <b>benzydamine.</b> <b>Benzydamine</b> strongly inhibited chemoattractant-induced activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) ERK 1 / 2, and of its upstream activator kinase MEK 1 / 2.

40|$|ABSTRACT Postoperative {{sore throat}} {{is a common}} {{complication}} after endotracheal intubation. After tracheal intubation, the incidence of sore throat varies from 14. 4 % to 50 %. The aim {{of the study was}} to compare between <b>benzydamine</b> hydrochloride gel, lidocaine 5 % gel and lidocaine 10 % spray on the endotracheal tube cuff as regards postoperative sore throat. The present study was carried out on 124 patients admitted to Alexandria university hospitals for lumbar fixation surgery requiring general anesthesia. Patients were randomly allocated into 4 groups. <b>Benzydamine</b> hydrochloride gel, 5 % lidocaine hydrochloride gel, 10 % lidocaine hydrochloride spray, or normal saline were applied on endotracheal tube cuffs before endotracheal intubation. The patients were examined for sore throat (none, mild, moderate, or severe) at 0, 1, 6, 12, and 24 h after extubation. The results were collected, analyzed and presented in table and figure. The highest incidence of postoperative sore throat occurred at 6 h after extubation in all groups. There was a significantly lower incidence of postoperative sore throat in the <b>benzydamine</b> group than 5 % lidocaine gel, 10 % lidocaine spray, and normal saline groups. The <b>benzydamine</b> group had significantly decreased severity of postoperative sore throat compared with the 10 % lidocaine, 5 % lidocaine, and normal saline groups at observation time point. Compared with the 5 % lidocaine the 10 % lidocaine group had significantly increased incidence and severity of postoperative sore throat after extubation. Compared with normal saline the 10 % lidocaine group had increased incidence of postoperative sore throat. There were no significant differences among groups in local or systemic side effects. So in conclusion, <b>benzydamine</b> hydrochloride gel on the endotracheal tube cuff is a simple and effective method to reduce the incidence and severity of postoperative sore throat. Application of 10 % lidocaine spray should be avoided because of worsening of postoperative sore throat where incidence increased but not the severity in relation to 5 % lidocaine gel. Applying 5 % lidocaine on the endotracheal tube cuff does not prevent postoperative sore throat but its application is better than lidocaine 10 % spray or saline...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the activity of}} <b>benzydamine,</b> lidocaine, and bupivacaine, three drugs with local anesthetic activity, against Candida albicans and non-albicans strains and to clarify their mechanism of activity. Methods: The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined for 20 Candida strains (18 clinical isolates and two American Type Culture Collection strains). The fungistatic activity was studied with the fluorescent probe FUN- 1 and observation under epifluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. The fungicidal activity of the three drugs was assayed by viability counts. Membrane alterations induced in the yeast cells were evaluated by staining with propidium iodide, by quantitation of intracellular K leakage and by transmission electron microscopy of intact yeast cells and prepared spheroplasts. Results: The MIC ranged from 12. 5 - 50. 0 pg/mL, 5. 0 - 40. 0 mg/mL, and 2. 5 - 10. 0 mg/mL for <b>benzydamine,</b> lidocaine, and bupivacaine, respectively.
