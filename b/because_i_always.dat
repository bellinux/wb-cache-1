However, I want to do what is good for the people of Montreal and the team. So that no further harm will be done, I would like to ask everyone to get behind the team and to help the boys win from the New York Rangers and Detroit. I will take my punishment and come back next year to help the club and the younger players to win the Cup.|$|E

"Now {{that that}} show is just humming and doing amazing {{business}} — it’s the #1 bestselling magic {{show in the}} world as far as ticket sales and the perception that people are experiencing and coming back to see it multiple times — I felt it was in a great place and I could think about television again. Obviously, “Believe” will continue to evolve until its last performance <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> want to add new magic, I’m always tweaking and transforming it. I missed being on television, I had something new creatively to say, and Spike became the perfect home to do it."

500|$|Björk {{chose the}} title Post for two reasons. Firstly, {{it refers to}} the fact that all the songs on the album were written after her move to England, while the songs on Debut were songs she had written during the {{previous}} ten years of her life in Iceland. In a 1996 interview, Björk said: [...] "I always knew it would be two albums and that's why I called them Debut and Post. Before and after". Secondly, the title was inspired by the singer's desire to communicate with friends and family back in Iceland, giving Post the additional meaning of [...] "mail". Talking with Raw in 1996, Björk stated: [...] "I called the record Post, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> address my songs back in my head to Iceland in a letter. Because it was such a big jump for me to move away from all my relatives, all my friends, everything I know".|$|E
500|$|Selena {{suggested}} {{the idea of}} writing and recording a track based on a story about her grandparents titled [...] "Amor Prohibido". She explained it to A.B. who began co-writing it with Astudillo and herself. The singer was inspired by love letters written by her grandmother who wrote about her experiences as a maid to a wealthy family and her infatuation with their son. Her grandmother was forbidden to formulate a relationship with him because of her social class and described it as [...] "forbidden love". Pérez wrote that during its recording session: here was a noticeable difference between her voice on [...] and [...] Entre a Mi Mundo, especially. I can't {{say that it was}} an improvement, exactly, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> thought that Selena's voice sounded incredible. It's just that her voice was richer and more mature than before, and her singing was more emotional and powerful as a result. While recording the song, Selena had ad-libbed [...] "oh baby". Her brother believed that the recording would [...] "not have been the same if she had not added the 'oh baby' part." ...|$|E
500|$|Selena {{wanted to}} write and record a song based {{on the story of}} her grandparents, who fell in love despite their {{different}} social classes. The singer was inspired by love letters written by her grandmother who wrote about her experiences as a maid to a wealthy family and her infatuation with their son. Her grandmother was forbidden to formulate a relationship with him because of her social class and described it as a [...] "forbidden love". She suggested the idea to her brother and music producer A.B. Quintanilla, who began co-writing the track with her and Selena y Los Dinos backup vocalist Pete Astudillo. [...] "Amor Prohibido" [...] was recorded at a studio in San Antonio, Texas. Selena's husband, Chris Pérez wrote in his 2012 book about their relationship that during its recording session [...] "there was a noticeable difference between her voice on [...] and [...] Entre a Mi Mundo (1992), especially. I can't say that it was an improvement, exactly, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> thought that Selena's voice sounded incredible.

500|$|Soon, Shakira {{began work}} on her next studio album, titled She Wolf, which was, among other places, {{recorded}} at the Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Shakira said that specifically chose the studio after she learned that it had previously been used for recording sessions by artists like Bob Marley, The Cure, and AC/DC, of whom she is a fan. Unlike most of her previous projects, which are predominantly composed of Latin and pop rock styles, She Wolf is an electropop album with world music influences. When asked why the album had electronic influences, Shakira responded, [...] "I felt very curious and intrigued about the electro-pop world and everything it has to offer. I {{wanted to make sure}} that this album was very bassy and that the kicks hit really hard, and I wanted to concentrate on the beat. But my music, to a certain extent, is very complex– <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> try to experiment with sounds from other parts of the world." [...] Explaining the meaning behind the title, Shakira said that [...] "'She Wolf' is the woman of our time. The woman who knows what she wants and is free of prejudice and preconceived notions. She defends her deepest desires with teeth and claws like a wild animal".|$|E
500|$|The {{songs on}} the album were written {{at the same time}} as the songs on Body Talk Pt. 1. In mid-July 2010, music {{magazine}} Billboard reported that the mixing of the songs had been completed. Robyn worked primary with Swedish producer and songwriter Klas Åhlund, who was heavily involved in the production of Body Talk Pt. 1. Unlike the first installment, Body Talk Pt. 2 saw Robyn working with a few producers apart from Åhlund, such as Diplo, Kleerup, Niggaracci and electronic duo Savage Skulls. She also worked with American rapper Snoop Dogg on the song [...] "U Should Know Better". The two originally met when Robyn was asked to sing vocals on a remix of his single [...] "Sexual Eruption" [...] (2007). Six months later, they met up once again to write and record [...] "U Should Know Better." [...] While being interviewed by Billboard, Robyn spoke of the experience of working with the rapper, stating, [...] "It was really cool to be able to be in the studio with him, first <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> was a fan but also because he was really creative and we had so much of an exchange in being there together, both as vocalists. I had an idea and he really got it and got into it, which was awesome." [...] She also worked with Savage Skulls on two {{songs on the}} album; [...] "Love Kills" [...] and the iTunes exclusive [...] "Bad Gal". Robyn spoke of the duo, saying that [...] "these really young guys who are part of a scene that I probably would've gotten into if I wasn't away so much when I was younger." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tiny Toon Adventures {{was made}} with a higher {{production}} value than standard television animation. It had a cel count {{that was more than}} double that of most television animation. The series had about 25,000 cels per episode instead of the standard 10,000, making it unique in that characters moved more fluidly. Pierre DeCelles, an animation producer, described storyboarding for the series as [...] "fun but a big challenge <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> had a short schedule, and it's not always easy to work full blast nonstop".|$|E

She persuaded the producers to rescind their decision and on April 18, 2005, she made her Broadway debut. [...] Because of her injury, Applegate had to wear special shoes to prevent another incident, and in a 2013 interview said that because of what happened, she [...] "actually can't dance anymore. And that is sad for me <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> wanted to go back. But I probably won't be able to."

2500|$|I {{was with}} her when she died. She left this world {{literally}} screaming {{at the top of her}} lungs. I {{was with her}} constantly, she lived not even 3 miles from my house, we were together practically every day. She was home for the last few weeks when the doctor told us there was nothing they could do any more. Up until the last two days, she was still moving around. The doctor told us she will leave very quickly and her body will just start to shut down. But when she left, she left the world with a bang, she left it how she lived it. She screamed her way out of here, literally. I truly believe her survival instincts were so part of her DNA that she was not going to go quietly or willingly. It was just the two of us hanging out [...] she was very funny. We didn't have to [...] <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> knew how she felt about me.

2500|$|Hilton {{starred in}} an MTV reality series, Paris Hilton's My New BFF, about her {{search for a}} new best friend; the series premiered on September 30, 2008. That day she {{introduced}} her song, [...] "My BFF" [...] (the show's theme song), on KIIS-FM with host Ryan Seacrest. The series was a hit; 1,200,000 viewers watched the premiere episode, and it averaged a 1.6 rating among viewers 12–34 in its Tuesday 10 p.m. slot (topping all other cable shows in the time slot). Hilton's next project was a Gothic rock musical, Repo! The Genetic Opera. She played Amber Sweet, the surgery- and painkiller-addicted daughter of a biotech magnate. Horror.com said: [...] "Not only is this by far Hilton's best role, she's actually got a grain of gravitas in the end". However, Jam! Movies called her a [...] "hopeless twit as an actress". Hilton said, [...] "Just getting a role like this offered to me was new to me <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> get offered a certain role just basically playing myself". She was nominated for the 2009 Razzie Award for Worst Supporting Actress for the role. The film, first screened at the 2008 San Diego Comic-Con International, began a limited release in the United States and Canada on November 7, 2008. Repo! had [...] "solid numbers" [...] for its opening weekend, grossing $51,600 gross in eight theaters.
