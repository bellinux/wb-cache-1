He described the distinguishing characteristics as a straight <b>bill</b> <b>hooked</b> at the tip, linear nostrils, a bare face, and fully webbed feet. The genus Fregata was defined by French naturalist Bernard Germain de Lacépède in 1799. Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot described the genus name Tachypetes in 1816 for the great frigatebird. The genus name Atagen had been coined by German naturalist Paul Möhring in 1752, though this has no validity as it predates the official beginning of Linnaean taxonomy.|$|R

50|$|A {{continuation}} of the series, based on one new story arc and the final two original answer arcs of the franchise, entitled Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai, aired in Japan between July 6 and December 17, 2007, containing twenty-four episodes. Sentai Filmworks has licensed the second anime series. The second season featured slightly different character designs than the first season and better animation. As {{the result of a}} murder case in September 2007 in Japan involving the murder of a police officer by his sixteen-year-old daughter with an axe, as well as the Japanese media relating the case to anime such as Higurashi, the latest episode screenings of both Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai and another anime at the time, School Days, were canceled by a number of Japanese TV stations due to excessive violence; however, AT-X, TV Saitama and Sun TV announced that they would be airing the episodes as planned. Later, TV Saitama announced that they had ceased broadcasting of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai from episode thirteen onwards. Additionally, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai had its opening altered when it re-aired. Originally, a bloody <b>bill</b> <b>hook</b> cleaver (as used by Rena) was shown halfway through (at timestamp 0:55) the opening; it was replaced with an image of a van from the series' fictional junk yard.|$|E
40|$|Preening is the {{principle}} behavioral defense used by birds to combat ectoparasites. Most birds have a small overhang {{at the tip of}} their bills that is used to shear through the tough cuticle of ectoparasitic arthropods, making preening much more efficient. Birds may also scratch with their feet to defend against ectoparasites. This is particularly important for removing ectoparasites on the head, which birds cannot preen. Scratching may be enhanced by the comb-like serrations that are found on the claws of birds in many avian families. We examined the prevalence and intensity of ectoparasites of barn owls (Tyto alba pratincola) in southern Idaho in relation to <b>bill</b> <b>hook</b> length and morphological characteristics of the pectinate claw. The barn owls in our study were infested with 3 species of lice (Phthiraptera: Ischnocera) : Colpocephalum turbinatum, Kurodaia subpachygaster, and Strigiphilus aitkeni. <b>Bill</b> <b>hook</b> length was associated with the prevalence of these lice. Owls with longer hooks {{were more likely to be}} infested with lice. Conventional wisdom suggests that the bill morphology of raptors has been shaped by selection for efficient foraging; our data suggest that hook morphology may also play a role in ectoparasite defense. The number of teeth on the pectinate claw was also associated with the prevalence of lice. Owls that had claws with more teeth were less likely to be infested with lice, which suggests that larger pectinate claws may offer relatively more protection against ectoparasitic lice. Experiments that manipulate the <b>bill</b> <b>hook</b> and pectinate claw are needed to confirm whether these host characters are involved in ectoparasite defense. Finally, we recovered mammalian ectoparasites from 4 barn owls. We recovered species of mammalian lice (Phthiraptera:Anoplura) and fleas (Siphonaptera) that are commonly found on microtine rodents. The owls probably acquired these parasites from recently eaten prey. This represents 1 of the few documented cases of parasites 2 ̆ 2 straggling 2 ̆ 2 from prey to predator...|$|E

40|$|The {{evolution}} of features that enhance an organism’s performance in one activity can adversely affect its performance in another. We used an experimental approach to document a trade-off {{associated with the}} {{evolution of}} the long hook {{at the tip of the}} bill of birds belonging to the genus Diglossa (flowerpiercers). In Diglossa, the more derived flower-robbing nectarivorous species have maxillae (upper jaws) that termin-ate in enlarged curved hooks. The ancestral frugivorous species have maxillae with relatively small hooks. We mimicked bill evolution by clipping the terminal <b>bill</b> <b>hook</b> of nectarivorous Cinnamon-bellied Flower-piercers (Diglossa baritula) to resemble the frugivorous condition. We found that birds with experimentally shortened bills ingested fruit more efficiently, but had a reduced ability to rob flowers. Birds with intact bills, by contrast, were good flower robbers but poor frugivores. The evolution of a hooked bill endowed flowerpiercers with the ability to efficiently pierce flowers and extract nectar, but hindered their efficiency to feed on fruit...|$|E

40|$|A major {{thrust of}} organismal biology {{involves}} understanding how an organism’s phenotype relates to its environment, via its performance capabilities. I investigated this linkage in Loggerhead Shrikes − small North American predatory songbirds that feed on arthropods and vertebrates, whose physical and behavioral attributes differ substantially. My dissertation {{is composed of}} three components, aimed at uncovering how shrikes accommodate the disparate demands of their prey. I examined geographic variation in bill morphology of museum specimens to investigate the relationship between environmental factors and upper bill form, particularly of the hooked tip and tomial teeth, which are thought to {{play a key role}} for processing vertebrate prey. My geometric morphometric analysis revealed significant intra- and interspecific variation, mostly along an axis of increasing hook curvature and length. Whereas as dietary differences mostly explained bill shape variation among species, variance in temperature and longitude explained variation within Loggerhead Shrikes. My field component was aimed at understanding the functional and ecological consequences of morphological variation. I captured shrikes throughout California to measure bill morphology and bite performance. I collected feather and prey samples for stable isotopes analysis, to infer dietary variation. Increased bill and hook lengths and curvatures were associated with lower bite forces, whereas bill shape was unrelated to bite pressure (force/area). Thus, shrikes with different bill shapes may achieve functional equivalence by modulating bite force. Bite force, rather than bill shape, was associated with isotopic variation, and with greater consumption of vertebrates. This suggested the importance of bite performance for handling less tractable prey, and possibly for responding to spatiotemporal variation in resources. Finally, I studied how prey-processing varied with prey type and ontogeny in captive shrikes. I performed high-speed video kinematics of adult and juvenile shrikes attacking crickets and mice. My results suggested that the head-shaking behavior that shrikes use when handling vertebrates may enhance killing efficiency. Although there were few differences between age classes in procuring crickets, juveniles had greater difficulty handling mice, consistent with their reduced <b>bill</b> <b>hook</b> and tomial tooth lengths. Collectively, these results demonstrate how functional performance mediates the relationship between morphology and feeding ecology in shrikes...|$|E

These characteristics also made it effective against heavily armoured infantry, dragging them into the melee or exploiting the weak points in their armour. The small point found on the trailing edge of some bills was useful for puncturing armour as well—concentrating the force of the blow onto the point.|$|R
