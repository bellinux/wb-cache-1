There is still a regular street market in the town, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> company relocated outside Ashford town centre after part of the 19th-century site was demolished {{to make way for the}} Channel Tunnel Rail Link.

25|$|For a period, Cambridge {{continued}} to issue Bibles using the Parris text, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> demand for absolute standardization was now {{such that they}} eventually adapted Blayney's work, but omitted some of the idiosyncratic Oxford spellings. By the mid-19th century, almost all printings of the Authorized Version were derived from the 1769 Oxford text â€“ increasingly without Blayney's variant notes and cross references, and commonly excluding the Apocrypha. One exception to this was a scrupulous original-spelling, page-for-page, and line-for-line reprint of the 1611 edition (including all chapter headings, marginalia, and original italicization, but with Roman type substituted for the black letter of the original), published by Oxford in 1833. Another important exception was the 1873 Cambridge Paragraph Bible, thoroughly revised, modernized and re-edited by F. H. A. Scrivener, who {{for the first time}} consistently identified the source texts underlying the 1611 translation and its marginal notes. Scrivener, like Blayney, opted to revise the translation where he considered the judgement of the 1611 translators had been faulty. In 2005, Cambridge University Press released its New Cambridge Paragraph Bible with Apocrypha, edited by David Norton, which followed in the spirit of Scrivener's work, attempting to bring spelling to present-day standards. Norton also innovated with the introduction of quotation marks, while returning to a hypothetical 1611 text, so far as possible, to the wording used by its translators, especially {{in the light of the}} re-emphasis on some of their draft documents. This text has been issued in paperback by Penguin books.|$|E

500|$|The beef from Highland cattle is very tender, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> for {{high-quality}} meat has declined. To {{address this}} decline, {{it is common}} practice to breed Highland [...] "suckler" [...] cows with a more favourable breed such as a Shorthorn or Limousin bull. This allows the Highland cattle to produce a crossbred beef calf that has the tender beef of its mother on a carcass shape of more commercial value at slaughter. These crossbred beef suckler cows inherit the hardiness, thrift and mothering capabilities of their Highland dams and the improved carcass configuration of their sires. Such crossbred sucklers can be further crossbred with a modern beef bull such as a Limousin or Charolais to produce high quality beef.|$|E

500|$|Neon's {{scarcity}} precluded its prompt {{application for}} lighting {{along the lines}} of Moore tubes, which used nitrogen and which were commercialized in the early 1900s. After 1902, Georges Claude's company, Air Liquide, produced industrial quantities of neon as a byproduct of his air liquefaction business. In December 1910 Claude demonstrated modern neon lighting based on a sealed tube of neon. Claude tried briefly to sell neon tubes for indoor domestic lighting, due to their intensity, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> failed because homeowners objected to the color. In 1912, Claude's associate began selling neon discharge tubes as eye-catching advertising signs and was instantly more successful. Neon tubes were introduced to the U.S. in 1923 with two large neon signs bought by a Los Angeles Packard car dealership. The glow and arresting red color made neon advertising completely different from the competition. The intense color and vibrancy of neon equated with American society at the time, suggesting a [...] "century of progress" [...] and transforming cities into sensational new environments filled with radiating advertisements and [...] "electro-graphic architecture." ...|$|E

[...] The 1968 riots caused only minor damage to the building, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> did not reopen afterward. The closure of the market and many other nearby businesses caused a widespread decline in the neighborhood, and left local residents without easy access to retail establishments. [...] In 1972, the Council of the District of Columbia approved a $30.4 million ($ million in [...] dollars) plan which, in part, provided for the purchase the O Street Market and its demolition. A modern shopping mall was planned for the site. The RLA purchased the property from the NLMC. Although neighborhood residents wanted the market torn down, the RLA declined to order its destruction. In 1974, the RLA proposed renovating the O Street Market and making it the retail centerpiece of a revived Shaw neighborhood.

2500|$|The London Metal Market and Exchange Company (London Metal Exchange) {{was founded}} in 1877, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> traces its origins back to 1571 {{and the opening of}} the Royal Exchange, London. Before the {{exchange}} was created, business was conducted by traders in London coffee houses using a makeshift ring drawn in chalk on the floor. At first only copper was traded. Lead and zinc were soon added but only gained official trading status in 1920. The exchange was closed during World War II and did not re-open until 1952. The range of metals traded was extended to include aluminium (1978), nickel (1979), tin (1989), aluminium alloy (1992), steel (2008), and minor metals cobalt and molybdenum (2010). The exchange ceased trading plastics in 2011. [...] The total value of the trade is around $US 11.6 trillion annually.|$|E
2500|$|The {{market is}} located in the La Lagunilla barrio (informal neighborhood), next to the Santa Catarina Church. The plaza of this church was the site of areaâ€™s main outdoor market or tianguis, through the colonial period to the late 19th century. Other {{landmarks}} nearby include the Guelatao Sports Center, and Plaza Garibaldi just to the west, known for its mariachis. The area is a lower socioeconomic one and most of the marketâ€™s clientele are from this and similar areas. This market is always very crowded and very lively, especially those areas that sell food, clothing and other everyday items. The neighborhood has a dangerous reputation, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> area is considered to be safe enough if visitors take basic precautions. About 2,000 families depend on this market directly or indirectly, but it faces pressure from commercial plazas and pressure from imports from Asia and other mass-produced items. Many of the vendors are third generation at the market, but many have been forced to change the merchandise they sell or complement their traditional wares in order to stay in business.|$|E

2500|$|Despite the new {{recognition}} {{for the theater}} by the City of Orlando, Mr. Juarez saw the building as a liability with many pleasant memories surrounding it, but with little economic potential. [...] Citing maintaining the building and rehabilitation of the area, he first announced plans to raze the building for an unspecified mix-use purpose and later to redevelop the former Beacham Block with a new skyscraper {{that would be used}} as a combination office building and hotel. [...] In 1988 Juarez received two successive approval Certificate of Appropriateness permits from the City of Orlando Board of Historic Preservation to demolish the Beacham Theatre within 180 days. [...] The [...] "Bye-bye Beacham Bash" [...] was promptly organized by Orlando Remembered and attended by former theater doormen, ushers, candy girls, and cashiers on December 9, 1988. [...] However, Mr. Juarez's redevelopment plan and the new construction of a 20-story office building and parking garage fell through at the last moment due to poor timing. [...] Additional parking could have contributed to a revitalized downtown area, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> for office space in Downtown Orlando was nearly saturated in the late 1980s and there was a general lack of interest from prospective future tenants.

60|$|The most {{successful}} {{of these small}} speculations is that of Mr. E. Hollway. Assisted by an able gardener from Saint Michael, Azores, where the pineapple made a little fortune for Ponta Delgada, he has converted Mount Pleasant, his father's house and grounds on the Caminho do Meio, into one huge pinery. The Madeiran sun does all the work of English fires and flues; but the glass must be whitewashed; otherwise, being badly made, with bubbles and flaws, it would burn holes in the plants. The best temperature for the hot-houses is about 90Â° F.: it will rise after midday to 140Â°, and fall at night to 65Â°. The species preferred are, in order of merit, the Cayena, the black Jamaica, and the Brazilian Abacaxi. The largest of Mr. Hollway's produce weighed 20 lbs.--pumpkin size. Those of 12 lbs. and 15 lbs. are common, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> prefers 8 lbs. His highest price was 2l., and he easily obtains from 10s. to 15s. In one greenhouse we saw 2,500 plants potted and bedded; the total numbers more than double that figure. The proprietor has a steam-saw, makes his own boxes, and packs his pines with dry leaves of maize and plantain. He is also cultivating a dwarf banana, too short to be wind-wrung. His ground will grow anything: the wild asparagus, which in Istria rises knee-high, here becomes a tall woody shrub.|$|E
6000|$|In {{going to}} Narbonne I had of course counted upon Roman remains; but when I went forth {{in search of}} them I {{perceived}} that I had hoped too fondly. There is really nothing in the place to speak of; that is, {{on the day of}} my visit there was nothing <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>market,</b> which was in complete possession. [...] "This intricate, curious, but lifeless town," [...] Murray calls it; yet to me it appeared overflowing with life. Its streets are mere crooked, dirty lanes, bordered with perfectly insignificant houses; but they were filled with the same clatter and chatter that I had found at the hotel. The market was held partly in the little square of the hÃ´tel de ville, a structure which a flattering woodcut in the Guide-Joanne had given me a desire to behold. The reality was not impressive, the old colour of the front having been completely restored away. Such interest as it superficially possesses it derives from a fine mediÃ¦val tower which rises beside it with turrets at the angles--always a picturesque thing. The rest of the market was held in another place, still shabbier than the first, which lies beyond the canal. The Canal du Midi flows through the town, and, spanned at this point by a small suspension-bridge, presented a certain sketchability. On the farther side were the vendors and chafferers--old women under awnings and big umbrellas, rickety tables piled high with fruit, white caps and brown faces, blouses, sabots, donkeys. Beneath this picture was another--a long row of washerwomen, on their knees {{on the edge of the}} canal, pounding and wringing the dirty linen of Narbonne--no great quantity, to judge by the costume of the people. Innumerable rusty men, scattered all over the place, were buying and selling wine, straddling about in pairs, in groups, with their hands in their pockets, and packed together at the doors of the cafÃ©s. They were mostly fat and brown and unshaven; they ground their teeth as they talked; they were very mÃ©ridionaux.|$|E
