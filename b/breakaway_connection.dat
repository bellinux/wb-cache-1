40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a new breakaway connection-for use in large roadside sign structures-with improved performance characteristics relative to existing <b>breakaway</b> <b>connection</b> designs. By using a hybrid combination of steel and fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) structural components, a new system was designed to resist statically equivalent hurricane wind loading, but also breakaway under direct vehicle impact loading. By replacing the heavier steel sign posts that have been used in previous designs with lighter FRP posts, and simultaneously introducing the use of innovative steel cutting surfaces that are engaged only during direct vehicle impact loading, occupant risks associated with collisions were reduced in severity, thereby producing improving safety. Since the performance standard for the design of roadside breakaway connections is currently the AASHTO Manual for Assessing Safety Hardware (MASH), the new connection system developed in this study was designed to meet the MASH requirements. However, since MASH is a relatively new standard, existing (i. e., previously-developed) designs of surrogate vehicles-used in impact testing of breakaway hardware-that meet the current MASH requirements were not available in the literature. Therefore, to facilitate physical testing of newly developed prototype connections, a MASH-compliant surrogate vehicle first had to be designed, fabricated, and validated. Hence, a secondary {{objective of this}} study was to develop a new 'small car' (1100 kg) surrogate vehicle for use in conjunction with the FDOT pendulum impact testing facility. In the course of pursuing this objective, several innovative and improved methods for designing surrogate impact vehicles were developed in this study [...] A key improvement was using tapered (trapezoidal) aluminum honeycomb cartridges, rather than the traditionally employed rectangular (constant cross-section) cartridges, to the reproduce the force-deformation behavior of the target production (market) vehicle (a 2006 Kia Rio in this study) [...] Additionally, the behavior of aluminum honeycomb at high levels of compressive stress (and deformation) was investigated using experimental testing and the findings were integrated into the surrogate vehicle design process. Validation crash-testing of the final surrogate vehicle (i. e., a combination of an impact block and a crushable nose constructed from aluminum honeycomb cartridges) demonstrated an acceptable match to the behavior of the target vehicle. Subsequently, the newly developed MASH-compliant surrogate vehicle was used to experimentally evaluate, using pendulum impact testing, multiple prototypes of a new hybrid (FRP and steel) <b>breakaway</b> <b>connection</b> design. The final design was demonstrated to meet the impact risk requirements stipulated in MASH as well as the hurricane wind resistance requirements specified by AASHTO and FDOT...|$|E
