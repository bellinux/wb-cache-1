40|$|The {{management}} and exploitation of <b>biotechnological</b> <b>product</b> innovation {{have proven to}} be more difficult than initially expected because the number of currently marketed biotechnological products is far from sufficient to counter deficits in pharmaceutical innovation. This study provides insight into the role of governance structures in interfirm cooperation and their effects on <b>biotechnological</b> <b>product</b> innovation and company success. Most of the existing literature regarding alliances and mergers and acquisitions (M&A) examines their effects on technology recipients' innovation performance. Here, the effects of alliances and M&A on both the innovation success and financial performance of technology suppliers (i. e., sources) are examined. Drawing from a sample of 220 human therapeutic biotechnology and biopharmaceutical firms over a period of 32 years (1980 - 2011), an analysis of the effects of biotechnology clusters, strategic alliances, and acquisitions is provided. This study reveals the existence of a risk-return trade-off for strategic alliances between biotech companies and larger, more established firms. Increased biotech company involvement in product development alliances decreases risk by increasing the likelihood of future product introductions. The trade-off, however, is that biotech companies earn lower returns when their products are developed through such alliances. A similar risk-return trade-off effect is found for clusters. However, acquisitions generally affect both product introductions and product returns in a negative way. These findings have strategic implications not only for managing the development of <b>biotechnological</b> <b>product</b> innovations and technology platforms but also for commercialization strategies with respect to interfirm cooperation and risk reduction...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the wound healing activity of atranorin cream (Patent requested) on excision wounds. Seventy-two male rats were anesthetized and an excisional wound was performed. Then the rats were randomly assigned into three groups: untreated control group; atranorin 1 (group treated with 1 % AT ointment); and atranorin 5 (group treated with 5 % AT ointment). Six animals of each group were euthanized 3, 7, 14 or 21 days after surgical procedures and the wounded areas were analyzed and removed. Serial histological sections were obtained and stained by histochemical techniques (Hematoxilin-Eosin-HEand Sirius red) and immunohistochemical techniques. Topical application of atranorin reduced wound areas, induced earlier granulation tissue formation, increased cell proliferation, improved collagenization and modulated the myofi broblasts differentiation when compared to control animals. It is suggested that atranorin modulates the wound healing process. These data suggest that this formulation based on atranorin extracted from Cladina kalbii AHTI may be a new <b>biotechnological</b> <b>product</b> for wound healing clinical applications...|$|E
40|$|L-Threonine is an {{important}} <b>biotechnological</b> <b>product</b> and Corynebacterium glutamicum is able to synthesize and accumulate this amino acid to high intracellular levels. We here use four exporters of Escherichia coli and show that three of them operate in C. glutamicum, with RhtA and RhtC being the most effective. Whereas RhtA was unspecific, resulting in L-homoserine together with L-threonine excretion, {{this was not the}} case with RhtC. Expression of rhtC reduced the intracellular L-threonine concentration from 140 to 11 mM and resulted in maximal excretion rates of 11. 2 nmol min(- 1) mg(- 1) as compared to 2. 3 nmol min(- 1) mg(- 1) obtained without rhtC expression. In combination with an ilvA mutation generated and introduced into the chromosome, an accumulation of up to 54 mM L-threonine was achieved as compared to 21 mM obtained with the ancestor strain. This shows that expression of rhtC is the pivotal point for industrial relevant L-threonine production with C. glutamicum, and might encourage in general the use of heterologous exporters in the field of white biotechnology to make full use of biosynthesis pathways...|$|E
40|$|Microbial {{growth is}} an {{exothermic}} process. Biotechnological industries produce {{large amounts of}} heat, usually considered an undesirable by-product. In this work, we report the construction and characterization of the first microbial thermoelectric cell (MTC), in which the metabolic heat produced by a thermally insulated microbial culture is partially converted into electricity through a thermoelectric device optimized for low DT values. A temperature of 41 uC and net electric voltage of around 250 – 600 mV was achieved with 1. 7 L baker’s yeast culture. This {{is the first time}} microbial metabolic energy has been converted into electricity with an ad hoc thermoelectric device. These results might contribute towards developing a novel strategy to harvest excess heat in the biotechnology industry, in processes such as ethanol fermentation, auto thermal aerobic digestion (ATAD) or bioremediation, which could be coupled with MTCs in a single unit to produce electricity as a valuable by-product of the primary <b>biotechnological</b> <b>product.</b> Additionally, we propose that small portable MTCs could be conceived and inoculated with suitable thermophilic of hyperthermophilic starter cultures and used for powering small electric devices...|$|E

40|$|Cyanobacteria are a {{promising}} biological chassis for {{the synthesis of}} renewable fuels and chemical bulk commodities. Significant efforts have been devoted to improve the yields of cyanobacterial products. However, while the introduction and heterologous expression of product-forming pathways is often feasible, the interactions and incompatibilities of product synthesis with the host metabolism are still insufficiently understood. In this work, we investigate the stoichiometric properties and trade-offs that underlie cyanobacterial product formation using a computational reconstruction of cyanobacterial metabolism. First, we evaluate the synthesis requirements of a selection of cyanobacterial products of potential biotechnological interest. Second, the large-scale metabolic reconstruction allows us toperform in-silico experiments that mimic and predict the metabolic changes that must occur in {{the transition from a}} growth-only phenotype to a production-only phenotype. Applied to the synthesis of ethanol, ethylene, and propane, these in-silico transition experiments point to bottlenecks and potential modification targets in cyanobacterial metabolism. Our analysis reveals incompatibilities between <b>biotechnological</b> <b>product</b> synthesis and native host metabolism, such as shifts in ATP/NADPH demand and the requirement to reintegrate metabolic by-products. Similar strategies can be employed for a large class of cyanobacterial products to identify potential stoichiometric bottlenecks...|$|E
40|$|The use of culture-independent approaches, such as metagenomics, {{provides}} complementary {{access to}} environmental microbial diversity. Mangrove environments represent a highly complex system {{with plenty of}} opportunities for finding singular functions. In this study we performed a functional screening of fosmid libraries obtained from an oil contaminated mangrove site, {{with the purpose of}} identifying clones expressing hydrolytic activities. A novel gene coding for a β-N-acetylhexosaminidase with 355 amino acids and 43 KDa was retrieved and characterized. The translated sequence showed only 38 % similarity to a β-N-acetylhexosaminidase gene in the genome of Veillonella sp. CAG: 933, suggesting that it might constitute a novel enzyme. The enzyme was expressed, purified, and characterized for its enzymatic activity on carboxymethyl cellulose, p-Nitrophenyl- 2 acetamide- 2 deoxy-β-d-glucopyranoside, p-Nitrophenyl- 2 acetamide- 2 deoxy-β-d-galactopyranoside, and 4 -Nitrophenyl β-d-glucopyranoside, presenting β-N-acetylglucosaminidase, β-glucosidase, and β- 1, 4 -endoglucanase activities. The enzyme showed optimum activity at 30 °C and pH 5. 5. The characterization of the putative novel β-N-acetylglucosaminidase enzyme reflects similarities to characteristics of the environment explored, which differs from milder conditions environments.

Increasingly, EPN are also finding a place as model organisms for fundamental studies in behavioural ecology and evolutionary biology (Campos-Herrera, Barbercheck, Hoy, & Stock, 2012).

30|$|The {{viability}} {{and activity}} of the population inoculum is often affected by abiotic stress. Since the endophytic compartment represent a more protective niche for plant–bacteria interaction, formulations based on endophytic streptomycete strains had advantages over non-endophytic streptomycetes that would guarantee successful positive plant host response [139]. Representative streptomycetes possess the ability to colonize the rhizosphere or endophytic tissues of plants [6, 87], to produce spores resistant to irradiation, heat, and drought [12], and to have an impressive range of metabolites {{with a variety of}} biological activities [140]. Streptomyces may also convert plant exudates or macromolecules/supramolecules present in the rhizosphere into a form that can be used by other plant growth-promoting microbes. This proposition originated from our research group and represents a technological conversion of the fundamental concept of ecological succession of community members and metabolic cooperation. In this line of research, we combined the non-starch-degrading diazotrophic bacterium H. seropedicae strain HRC 54 with S. bellus strain UENF AC 06, and verified that an increased population of the bacteria was probably sustained by C-sources from a starch degradation by-product. It is noteworthy that Herbaspirillum did not grow when S. bellus was absent in the medium and when starch was the sole C-source (unpublished results). It is another example of a simple idea that can be converted into a <b>biotechnological</b> <b>product</b> with a range of applications for sustainable crop production.|$|E

Results: Bioemulsifier production by a Paenibacillus sp. strain isolated from crude oil was studied. The bioemulsifier was produced using sucrose with and without adding hydrocarbons (paraffin or crude oil) under aerobic and anaerobic conditions at 40 degrees C. It formed stable emulsions with several hydrocarbons and its emulsifying ability was not affected by exposure to high salinities (up to 300 g/l), high temperatures (100 degrees C- 121 degrees C) or a wide range of pH values (2 - 13). In addition, it presented low toxicity and high biodegradability when compared with chemical surfactants. A preliminary chemical characterization by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), proton and carbon nuclear magnetic resonance (H- 1 NMR and C- 13 CP-MAS NMR) and size exclusion chromatography indicated that the bioemulsifier is a low molecular weight oligosaccharide-lipid complex. Conclusion: The production of a low molecular weight bioemulsifier by a novel Paenibacillus strain isolated from crude oil was reported. To the best of our knowledge, bioemulsifier production by Paenibacillus strains has not been previously reported.

We developed a method for the efficient biotechnological production of GA as a target compound for new surplus glycerol applications in the biodiesel and oleochemical industries. We investigated the ability of 162 acetic acid bacterial strains to produce GA from glycerol {{and found that the}} patterns of productivity and enantiomeric GA compositions obtained from several strains differed significantly. The growth parameters of two different strain types, Gluconobacter frateurii NBRC 103465 and Acetobacter tropicalis NBRC 16470, were optimized using a jar fermentor. G. frateurii accumulated 136. 5 g/liter of GA with a 72 % d-GA enantiomeric excess (ee) in the culture broth, whereas A. tropicalis produced 101. 8 g/liter of d-GA with a 99 % ee. The 136. 5 g/liter of glycerate in the culture broth was concentrated to 236. 5 g/liter by desalting electrodialysis during the 140 -min operating time, and then, from 50 ml of the concentrated solution, 9. 35 g of GA calcium salt was obtained by crystallization. Gene disruption analysis using G. oxydans IFO 12528 revealed that the membrane-bound alcohol dehydrogenase (mADH) -encoding gene (adhA) is required for GA production, and purified mADH from G. oxydans IFO 12528 catalyzed the oxidation of glycerol. These results strongly suggest that mADH is involved in GA production by acetic acid bacteria. We propose that GA is potentially mass producible from glycerol feedstock by a biotechnological process...|$|E
