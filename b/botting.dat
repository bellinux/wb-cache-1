40|$|The {{popularity}} of social media platforms such as Twitter {{has led to}} the proliferation of automated <b>bots,</b> creating both opportunities and challenges in information dissemination, user engagements, and quality of services. Past works on profiling <b>bots</b> had been focused largely on malicious <b>bots,</b> with the assumption that these <b>bots</b> should be removed. In this work, however, we find many <b>bots</b> that are benign, and propose a new, broader categorization of <b>bots</b> based on their behaviors. This includes broadcast, consumption, and spam <b>bots.</b> To facilitate comprehensive analyses of <b>bots</b> and how they compare to human accounts, we develop a systematic profiling framework that includes a rich set of features and classifier bank. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performances of different classifiers under varying time windows, identify the key features of <b>bots,</b> and infer about <b>bots</b> in a larger Twitter population. Our analysis encompasses more than 159 K <b>bot</b> and human (non-bot) accounts in Twitter.

This research analyzes active <b>bot</b> processes with emphasis on a newly identified vector of detection based on DNS activities occurring throughout the <b>bot</b> life cycle with a primary focus on the early stage of the cycle (i. e., when <b>bots</b> first join a botnet). Specifically, we propose criteria for detecting <b>bot</b> processes based on their reaction-to-DNS-response behavior (RD behavior). Our experimental results confirm that the newly identified vector of detection can, in most cases, accurately identify <b>bot</b> processes during the early stage in their life cycle and can improve detection results of current commercial <b>bot</b> detection software. ...|$|R

Critics Heather and Gary <b>Botting</b> have claimed that Witnesses accused of an offence warranting expulsion are presumed guilty until found innocent. They say the onus is on the accused to prove their innocence and if they make no attempt to do so—by failing to appear at a hearing set by the judicial committee—they are assumed to be guilty and unrepentant.|$|E
25|$|It {{was in the}} United States and in Australia that new, {{home-grown}} traditions, sometimes {{based upon}} earlier, regional folk-magical traditions and often mixed with {{the basic structure of}} Gardnerian Wicca, began to develop, including Victor Anderson's Feri Tradition, Joseph Wilson's 1734 Tradition, Aidan Kelly's New Reformed Orthodox Order of the Golden Dawn and eventually Zsuzsanna Budapest's Dianic Wicca, each of which emphasised different aspects of the faith. It was also around this time that books teaching people how to become Witches themselves without formal initiation or training began to emerge, among them Paul Huson's Mastering Witchcraft (1970) and Lady Sheba's Book of Shadows (1971). Similar books continued to be published throughout the 1980s and 1990s, fuelled by the writings of such authors as Doreen Valiente, Janet Farrar, Stewart Farrar and Scott Cunningham, who popularised the idea of self-initiation into the Craft. Among witches in Canada, anthropologist Dr. Heather <b>Botting</b> (nee Harden) of the University of Victoria {{has been one of the}} most prominent, having been the first recognized Wiccan chaplain of a public university. Original high priestess of Coven Celeste, she is one of the founders of the Canadian Aquarian Tabernacle Church.|$|E

40|$|<b>Bots</b> are {{malicious}} software entities that unobtrusively infect machines and silently {{engage in activities}} ranging from data stealing to cyber warfare. Most recent <b>bot</b> detection methods rely on regularity of <b>bot</b> command and control (C&C) traffic for <b>bot</b> detection but state-of-the-art <b>bots</b> randomize traffic properties to evade regularity based detection techniques. We propose a <b>bot</b> detection system that aims to detect randomized <b>bot</b> C&C traffic and also aim at early <b>bot</b> detection. To this end, separate strategies are devised for <b>bot</b> detection: (i) over a user session and (ii) time periods larger than a user session. Normal HTTP traffic and <b>bot</b> control traffic are modeled over a user session and a Multi-Layer Perceptron Classifier is trained on the two models and later used to classify unlabeled destinations as benign or malicious. For traffic spanning time intervals larger than a user session, temporal persistence, is used to differentiate between traffic to benign and malicious destinations. Testing with multiple datasets yielded good results...|$|R
30|$|In Table  4, {{we present}} the basic {{directed}} characteristics of each network {{of the game}} <b>bot</b> and human groups from Aion (Son et al. 2012). First, {{we see that the}} average degree of the human group is approximately 18 times larger compared with the game <b>bot</b> group in the party network. The reason is that human users form a party with many and unspecified users, whereas game <b>bots</b> play with several specific other game <b>bots.</b> The average degree of the friendship network of the human group is larger by a factor of approximately four compared with the game <b>bot</b> group. This fact indicates that the friendship of game <b>bots</b> is utterly different from that of human users. Game <b>bot</b> friends simply mean other game <b>bots</b> with which to play. The fact that the average degree of the human group is 2.5 times larger than the game <b>bot</b> group is observed {{in the case of the}} trade network. However, the average clustering coefficient of the game <b>bot</b> group is approximately five times larger compared with the human group. We assume that game <b>bots</b> have roles (Kwon et al. 2013; Ahmad et al. 2009). For instance, some game <b>bots</b> are responsible for gold farming, while other game <b>bots</b> gather game money and items from gold farmers or sell them for real money (Woo et al. 2011).|$|R

Features and intelligence of <b>bots</b> may vary greatly, especially with community created content. Advanced <b>bots</b> feature machine learning for dynamic learning of patterns of the opponent as well as dynamic learning of previously unknown maps - whereas more trivial <b>bots</b> may rely completely on lists of waypoints created for each map by the developer, limiting the <b>bot</b> to play only maps with said waypoints.|$|R

500|$|The film, Boots! Boots!, {{was shot}} {{on a budget}} of £3,000 in a one-room studio in Albany Street, London. Formby played the John Willie character, while Beryl also appeared, and the couple were paid £100 for the two weeks' work, plus 10 per cent of the profits. The film {{followed}} a revue format, and Jo <b>Botting,</b> writing for the British Film Institute, describes it as having a [...] "wafer-thin plot" [...] that is [...] "almost incidental". <b>Botting</b> also considers the film has [...] "poor sound quality, static scene set-ups and [...] lack of sets", and while it did not impress the critics, audience figures were high. Formby followed this up with Off the Dole in 1935, again for Blakeley, who had re-named his company Mancunian Films. The film cost £3,000 to make, and earned £80,000 at the box office. As with Boots! Boots!, the film was in a revue format, and Formby again played John Willie, with Beryl as his co-star. According to Formby's biographer, Jeffrey Richards, the two films for Blakeley [...] "are an invaluable record of the pre-cinematic Formby at work".|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Bot-like malware has posed {{an immense}} threat to {{computer}} security. <b>Bot</b> detection {{is still a}} challenging task since <b>bot</b> developers are continuously adopting advanced techniques to make <b>bots</b> more stealthy. A typical <b>bot</b> exhibits three invariant features along its onset: (1) the startup of a <b>bot</b> is automatic without requiring any user actions; (2) a <b>bot</b> must establish a command and control channel with its botmaster; and (3) a <b>bot</b> will perform local or remote attacks sooner or later. These invariants indicate three indispensable phases (startup, preparation, and attack) for a <b>bot</b> attack. In this paper, we propose BotTracer to detect these three phases {{with the assistance of}} virtual machine techniques. To validate BotTracer, we implement a prototype of BotTracer based on VMware and Windows XP Professional. The results show that BotTracer has successfully detected all the <b>bots</b> in the experiments without any false negatives...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{shows the}} results of {{applying}} Reinforcement Learning (rl) to train combat movement behaviour for a Quake iii Arena [3] <b>bot.</b> Combat movement of a Quake iii <b>bot</b> is the part that steers the <b>bot</b> while in battle with an enemy <b>bot</b> or human player. The aim {{of this research is}} to train a <b>bot</b> to perform better than the standard Quake iii <b>bot</b> it is based on, by only changing its combat movement behaviour. We extended a standard <b>bot</b> with a Q-learning algorithm that trains a Neural Network to map a game state vector to Q-values, one for each possible action. This rl <b>bot</b> (to which we refer as NeurioN) is trained in a reduced Quake iii environment, to decrease noise and to make the training phase more effective. The training consists of one-to-one combat with its non-learning counterpart, in runs up to 100. 000 kills (frags). Reward is given for avoiding damage, thereby letting the <b>bot</b> learn to avoid getting hit. We found it is possible to improve a Quake iii <b>bot</b> by using rl to train combat movement. The trained <b>bot</b> outperforms its non-learning counterparts, but does not appear smarter in combat with human opponents. ...|$|R

2500|$|Heather and Gary <b>Botting</b> {{argue that}} the power of the Watch Tower Society to control members is gained through the {{acceptance}} of the Society [...] "quite literally as the voice of Jehovah—God's 'mouthpiece'."
