5|$|May is 13, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> nothing, {{is unable}} to talk fluently, nor walk with ease due to for her bandy legs. Her father is dead and she has four elder brothers, all mentally retarded... The {{students}} are all disabled, retarded and of different ages. Teaching them is a hard job. They are of the 3rd grade {{but many of them}} find it hard to do the reading. Only a few of them can. Their pronunciation is distorted due to their twisted lips and their memory is quite short. They easily forget what they've learned... In the Village, it is quite hard to tell the kids' exact ages. Some in their twenties have a physical statures as small as the 7- or 8-years-old. They find it difficult to feed themselves, much less have mental ability or physical capacity for work. No one can hold back the tears when seeing the heads turning round unconsciously, the bandy arms managing to push the spoon of food into the mouths with awful difficulty... Yet they still keep smiling, singing in their great innocence, at the presence of some visitors, craving for something beautiful.|$|E
25|$|Count Ayakura is {{strongly}} tempted to punish Tadeshina, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> {{too much about}} his secret resentment of the upstart Matsugaes, and he cannot afford to give her any encouragement to reveal itin particular, the instruction he gave her (in 1905) that Satoko should lose her virginity before any bridegroom chosen by the Marquis should touch her.|$|E
500|$|... "Like a Virgin" [...] {{is one of}} Madonna's {{most famous}} singles, and was met with {{predominantly}} positive critical reception. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic said that [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] was a definitive statement. He added that the song, and [...] "Material Girl" [...] from the same album, made Madonna an icon. He added that both overshadowed {{the rest of the}} record, [...] "because they are a perfect match of theme and sound." [...] Debbie Miller from Rolling Stone commented that Madonna's voice [...] "doesn't have the power or range of, say, Cyndi Lauper, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> what works on the dance floor." [...] In 2014, Ryan Reed, also writing for Rolling Stone, called the song a [...] "classic".|$|E
60|$|It was a guarded {{promise and}} {{by no means}} all that <b>she</b> desired, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> must be content with it.|$|R

500|$|According to Moss, Peggy [...] "has the {{capability}} of being a Don Draper, and there can't be {{two of them in}} the office." [...] The goodbye scene between Don and Peggy was a difficult one to shoot. Moss said, [...] "That scene was a really, really tough scene to do. They didn't tell me {{they were going to do}} this, but they told Jon to hold my hand and not let it go. Then he did, and I lost it. Every single one of those tears were absolutely real. She wants to stay with all of her heart. She does not want to leave, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> she has to." [...] Hamm said there was [...] "respect, understanding, and admiration between those two characters. This is the exact right time for her to leave." ...|$|E
500|$|Before Diana {{made her}} first appearance, {{she was being}} {{described}} as being a [...] "mega bitch", an [...] "Erinsborough villainess" [...] and a [...] "manipulative businesswoman." [...] Diana is a dangerous femme fatale, who is [...] "beautiful, sexy and strong". TV Soap said {{she is a woman}} on a mission. Badler described her character's background saying she had a dysfunctional upbringing, which made her strong and a fighter. Diana has had to fight for everything in her life, so she works hard in order to survive. Badler added in an interview with Network Ten that Diana is highly ambitious and very driven, which makes her kind of like a man. Diana is one of the chiefs of Lassiter's International, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> that she will not get {{to the top of the}} company because Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) is the heir to the Robinson fortune.|$|E
500|$|Cortana {{returns in}} the third {{installment}} in the Halo series, the 2007 Xbox 360 game Halo 3. During gameplay, Cortana appears to the player in broken transmissions, often reciting lines from Fall of Reach and earlier games. Cortana manages {{to send a message}} to the Master Chief on Earth through a [...] Flood-infected ship. In her message, she states that Gravemind is unaware of the portal opened by a Forerunner artifact on Earth. Cortana continues to appear to the Chief, who later recovers her from Flood-controlled High Charity. Surprised that the Chief has against all odds rescued her (as promised) Cortana produces the Index from Installation 04, which she has kept as a souvenir. With it, Cortana activates a new ringworld being constructed. While the Flood are destroyed as planned, the slipspace portal through which Master Chief, the Arbiter, and Cortana attempt to escape collapses, thus stranding the Chief and Cortana. Cortana activates a distress beacon, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> that years could pass before rescue comes. As the Master Chief prepares to go into cryonic sleep to await rescue, Cortana confides to him that she will miss him. He replies to wake him when she needs him.|$|E
6000|$|She {{could not}} tell him, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew.</b> <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> nearly for certain! It was most unlikely; {{circumstances}} had changed! Irene's words still rang in her head: [...] "I have left Soames. Where should I go?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> that {{it would}} not be ladylike to do that: so she was silent.|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> {{very well}} that she must have dropped seven drops of the enchanted water.|$|R
500|$|Cinema Blend Amanda Krill said Stevens' wig {{looked like}} a [...] "Stepford Wives wig", adding: [...] "Everyone {{has a hard time}} not looking at it. She's still a cancer patient, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> that her job is on the line just like {{everyone}} else's. Everyone is working round the clock, showing up at every call, and the Chief is acting like a maniacal overlord." [...] Krill also enjoyed Oh's performance as Yang, writing: [...] "Cristina dealing with children is almost laughable – and actually provides a chuckle or two in this tense episode. Miss C thinks she is striking gold by moving to peds, because she {{will be able to do}} all types of surgery, and on little people, which makes the surgery harder, which is of course, better. Things don't turn out as planned, though, when she realizes kids are a little more resilient than their adult counterparts. And then Callie outs her to Arizona – in the she doesn’t really like kids sense of outing." [...] Krill enjoyed Wilson's performance as Bailey, in addition to Dane's, writing: [...] "He wins the best line of the show with 'That’s how I know my job is safe, Yang – I reattach babies arms.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The ballet {{is about}} a peasant girl named Giselle, who dies of a broken heart after {{discovering}} her lover is betrothed to another. The Wilis, a group of supernatural women who dance men to death, summon Giselle from her grave. They target her lover for death, but Giselle's great love frees him from their grasp. The Wilis [...] are particularly haunting characters. They are the spirits of virgin girls that died before they married. These creatures were very popular in Romantic era ballets. Led by Myrtha, the Queen of the Wilis, they gain their power in numbers as they effortlessly move through dramatic patterns and synchronized movements, and control the stage with their long tulle dresses and stoic expressions. Although still appearing ethereal, watching the Wilis sweep the stage creates an eerie mood that builds as the ballet continues and they enclose on Albrecht. They are ruthless and hateful of men because they have all died of a broken heart. Giselle finds forgiveness in her heart for Albrecht, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> the Wilis will not do the same. Their goal is clear and they are relentless on their quest. The Wilis {{are one of the}} most iconic characters in Giselle. They leave an imprint in the viewers mind as they dominate the second act.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{confirmed}} in April 2014 that Patsy Palmer {{would be leaving}} EastEnders and her final scenes will air in the Autumn. A spokesman for Palmer said: [...] "Patsy is really sad to be leaving the show as she loves playing Bianca and working with executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> it's the right decision {{at this time in}} her life." [...] The soap’s executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins, who has decided not to kill-off Bianca, said: [...] "We are so sad that Patsy has decided to leave us but completely understand it's the right time for her. Bianca won't be leaving Albert Square until the Autumn so there's still a lot more to come from her on screen this year – and the door will be left wide open for her return. We won't be getting rid of Bianca's puffa jacket just yet". It was revealed months later that an upcoming storyline would involve Bianca and Terry departing alongside their children, minus Liam and Whitney. A teaser for the storyline was released on 29 August 2014.|$|E

2500|$|According to her {{background}} story in , Mary is the granddaughter of , the Japanese kobujutsu master who trained Geese Howard, {{and she has}} been trained in martial arts since childhood, with her specialty being Combat Sambo. On her 20th birthday, she was introduced to her father's Secret Service partner Butch, who gave her the leather jacket she wears as a birthday present. Mary and Butch began dating, and Butch began training her in Combat Sambo. However, Butch and Mary's father were one day assigned to guard the President during a parade. After the parade was over, a group of assassins tried to kill the President, and both men, Mary's father and Butch, lost their lives protecting him. After that Mary became a regular customer in a bar to take her mind out of her sorrow. The bartender of the place created an original blue cocktail named after her. Later she begins to travel the world, and, while on a case, meets Terry Bogard, to whom she grows close as they join forces. She has a pet dog named Anton which normally accompanies her to wherever she has a fight. [...] Blue Mary is very friendly towards everyone, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> that her job must come first before anything else. The fighting art she employs, combat sambo, uses striking and grappling techniques.|$|E
2500|$|Baby Emma Henry {{originated}} {{the role}} and played Vicki until 1988, when her parents moved to Scotland. The role was recast to Samantha Leigh Martin, who learned to call Susan Tully [...] "Mummy Shell" [...] and referred to Letitia Dean who played her mum's best friend, [...] "Daddy Sharon". Tully has commented, [...] "What's lovely about working with Samantha is that she's always happy. When it comes to work, she knows it's playing a pretend game, she knows my real name <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> to call me 'Mummy Shell' when the cameras are running. If she isn't involved {{for a couple of}} weeks, I like to visit her at home, so she's always relaxed with me." [...] Tully worried about this when it came to filming scenes in 1989 where Vicki contracted meningitis and was hospitalised and placed in an incubator with tubes attached to her body. Tully said, [...] " [...] has seen me in all kinds of situations but I didn't know how she'd cope if I cried over her". At Tully's suggestion, the BBC built a hospital room with minimal equipment and a consultant was present to make sure the BBC had the details correct and that neither the viewers or Samantha would be too distressed. Tully insisted that the child was not present when she had to film scenes of Michelle sobbing over the incubator.|$|E

He promises Lynsey that if she works out who his next victim is he will confess his crimes to the police, but if she fails another girl will die. Lynsey has {{to go along with}} Silas's mind game after everyone still refuses to believe her claims about him. Hassan explained that Silas does not care if he gets caught or perishes in the process. He reminds Lynsey of his plan by sending her clues and presents, such as a chess queen and a pumpkin containing the message [...] "Tick tock, time is running out". Lynsey confides in Doug and tells him what Silas is doing. Silas picks out four potential victims: Lynsey, Texas, Theresa and Amy Barnes (Ashley Slanina-Davies). He then marks each one of them with chess pieces which are planted in their homes or bags. Silas sends Lynsey a Catwoman outfit with an instruction to wear it at the fancy dress Halloween party at Chez Chez nightclub. Lynsey confides in Doug and tells him what Silas {{is planning}} and Brennan said he was [...] "very, very happy" [...] {{to be involved in the}} storyline again. Doug believes Lynsey, of which Hassan said [...] "On one hand, she feels like she shouldn't be dragging [...] into this mess, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> that she needs someone on her side". The actress added that Lynsey cannot believe her luck as Doug show her kindness and friendship and she wonders why she did not confide in him months ago. Rawle revealed that nobody in the village is safe, saying [...] "Theresa's already in his sights, Lynsey is a possible and so is Mercedes - he really doesn't like the McQueens!" [...] He added that there are [...] "lots of other women" [...] whose morals Silas would find questionable.|$|E
