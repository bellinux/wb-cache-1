The Scanning Electron Microscope investigation confirmed that for wires drawn with high total draft, exceeding 80 %, makes it impossible to clearly assess the impact of drawing technology on structural changes in the drawn wires.

On the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>examination</b> of the wire structure by measuring of electrical resistance, the structure changes in drawn wires has been determined. It has been shown that the increase of drawing speed, especially above 15 m/s, causes an increase in structure defect, with a decline in platelet orientation of cementite in drawn wires...|$|E

First tentative results from the project confirm {{the need for a}} revision and improvement of balancing methods since they did not reflect the actual organic matter dynamic in selected trials sufficiently. Significant differences in soil organic matter reproduction could be observed between conventional and organic farming and in connection to cultivation system, mode of fertilizing, and amount of legumes in crop rotation...|$|E
