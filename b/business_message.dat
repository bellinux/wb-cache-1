50|$|Analyzing, {{which is}} the first step of the prewriting process, focuses on both {{detecting}} the main goals of the <b>business</b> <b>message</b> and choosing {{the most effective way to}} express the information to the audience. Finding out the main goals of business writing requires considering and summarizing the needs of the audience, would all be conveyed by: email, instant message, business letters, memos, reports, etc. Only when the information presented through the writing matches the demands of the audience will it attract the audience's attention. Generally, most business writing can be devoted to informing and persuading the audience. However, it is just as necessary to establish a good relationship with the audience. Choosing the most appropriate way of conveying information is fairly significant for improving efficiency of expression. Delivering a message in the proper way depends on a few factors. It is helpful to note the importance of the message, the feedback needed and the cost of the method of delivery.|$|E

40|$|Summary: With the {{exception}} of firms that have a basic computing culture, such as IBM and Hewlett-Packard, the development of <b>business</b> <b>message</b> systems is not as irresistible as it might seem. Constraints like formatting and entering data make user-friendly models difficult to establish compared with other media like the telephone and fax. On the other hand, electronic data interchange (EDI) is more suitable if a strictly functional model is required. What niche remains for messaging and in what conditions can it grow?

40|$|Transformation of {{business}} messages from one trading partner’s definition to another, or from one <b>business</b> <b>message</b> type to another {{is a common}} requirement for enterprise data integration applications. Transforming these business messages entails resolving issues of structural and semantic heterogeneity between their schemas. In this paper, we propose an automatic schema matching approach called MAXSM, designed specifically for matching schemas {{in the context of}} enterprise data integration. MAXSM is a multi-heuristic schema matcher which employs, amongst other heuristics, a novel heuristic using WordNet for determining natural-language semantic similarity between schemas. MAXSM also introduces “transitive mappings ” that can be discovered from known mappings and used to seed production of candidate mappings. We present a cogent tree spanning approach to search two schemas more effectively for node-level match candidates...|$|E

40|$|Travel Plans {{have been}} {{implemented}} within the United Kingdom since they were first proposed as a local Travel Planning tool within the Transport White Paper, ???A new deal for transport??? in the later part of the 20 th Century. Whilst {{there have been some}} notable modal split reductions seen by larger employers (i. e. Pharmaceutical, Higher Education and Retailers), Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) have typically been overlooked as a sector by transport policy makers. This is due to a variety of reasons, most notably that there is a perception that engaging this sector is challenging, and that there would be less chance of achieving significant modal shift as a result. This view is short sighted, as this sector offers significant opportunities for modal change, {{due to the fact that}} it represents 59 per cent of employment and therefore offers significant potential reductions in Green House Emissions. Fresh Ways to Work was an innovative new Travel Planning behaviour change scheme conducted in Hertfordshire and Suffolk to try and address this shortfall. It was the first of its kind, aiming to provide Travel Plans for SMEs within these two geographic areas. Fresh Ways to Work aimed to provide each SME with free Travel Planning advice and support with the specific aim to reduce carbon emissions and transport costs to the businesses involved. This research framework makes use of an embedded approach and thematic analysis to document and critically analyse the various components of the work. The overall aim was to assess the feasibility of working in partnership with SMEs in order to develop Travel Plans. Data was gathered in two ways, first by formally interviewing professionals (from both Travel Planning and business backgrounds) directly involved with Fresh Ways to Work in a semi-structured interview setting, and second through a questionnaire for businesses that signed up to the project. The views of experts and businesses were sought on how well the scheme was conducted, as well as gaining insights of which aspects of the project were successful and which were less so. Adopting this embedded approached enabled the researcher to immerse them-self in the qualitative data and to become more appreciative of the significant number of variables to be considered. Quantitative data was also used to provide a foundation to the qualitative aspect of this research. This was collected in two forms including the project sign-up questionnaire which sought when businesses engaged with the project, their location and employee numbers. The second form was the business questionnaire which sought rankings on the various components of Fresh Ways to Work. Quantitative data was envisaged to form a greater part ofthis research, but due to Fresh Ways to Work delivery issues did not materialise and therefore was unsuitable. The conclusion summates that Fresh Ways to Work did not achieve all of its original aims or objectives. To begin with, only sixty of the targeted eighty businesses in Hertfordshire signed up, and only a handful developed Travel Plans. This was partly due to a number of varying factors, including the compulsory nature of the Travel Planning, as well as the wider impact of the financial crisis, the period in which this work was delivered. However, Fresh Ways to Work excelled in many aspects such as diversifying its marketing approached throughout the period of the work, and adapting its <b>business</b> <b>message</b> that there is an economic argument to providing a good mix of travel options to a workforce. Therefore the argument of this work is that transport planning can help business efficiency through allowing employees to adapt their travel mode during a difficult economic climate. Overall, it will be argued that the project achieved more than some key experts expected and arguably provided significant results given the amount of time and resource invested...|$|E
