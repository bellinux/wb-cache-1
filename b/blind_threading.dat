40|$|With head {{on each of}} its ends, bolt can be {{disengaged}} {{from its}} blind side. Bolt has conventional hexagonal head on one end and smaller hexagonal head on its threaded end. Since reduced head is smaller than bolt diameter, it does not interfere with insertion of bolt shank in bolthole. However, it can be turned by wrench to release bolt from its <b>blind</b> (<b>threaded)</b> end. Bolt should be tethered on its large-head end {{so that it does}} not drop away from assembly...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Educational {{discussion}} {{boards are}} growing in use as they help students share knowledge and doubts in a working/studying environment. Although these interactive tools are highly effective in learning environments, their usability by blind students is very poor. In this paper we develop techniques to improve accessibility of educational content {{for students who}} are <b>blind.</b> <b>Threads</b> of messages in discussion boards evolve with new postings, thus just by investigating the subject headings or contents of earlier postings in a message thread, students {{may not be able to}} guess the contents of the postings deeper in the hierarchy. In order to overcome the navigation obstacle for users, it is essential to develop techniques that help identify how the content of a discussion board grows. We develop a technique to organise messages in a message board, by automatically classifying and annotating postings to guide users through discussion segments relevant to their navigational goals...|$|R

50|$|The Leptotyphlopidae (commonly called slender <b>blind</b> snakes or <b>thread</b> snakes) are {{a family}} of snakes found in North and South America, Africa, and Asia.

50|$|A cross-bolted bearing is a bearing, {{usually a}} {{crankshaft}} main bearing of a piston engine. Most bearing caps are retained by two bolts, {{one on each}} side of the bearing journal, and parallel to the cylinder axis. A cross-bolted bearing has one or more additional bolts, at right-angles to both the cylinder and crankshaft axes. These bolts may be either a single through bolt passing through the crankcase from one side to the other, or else two <b>blind</b> bolts <b>threaded</b> into the bearing cap from each side.|$|R
50|$|Epictinae (commonly called slender <b>blind</b> snakes or <b>thread</b> snakes) are a {{subfamily}} {{of snakes}} {{found in the}} New World and equatorial Africa. Members of this subfamily tend to have short, thick tails, and the fewest subcaudal scales. It comprises two tribes, three subtribes, eight genera, and 62 species.|$|R

Close range stereophotogrammetric scanning is the most cost- effective solution in this domain but has somedrawbacks. The paper analyses some characteristics of this technique approaching the scanning and 3 Dreconstruction of some peculiar objects with different indentations. There have been observed some difficultiesin reproducing the exact details: some <b>blind</b> holes, <b>threads</b> and other indentations do not appear on the 3 D meshmodels but appear on the textured models...|$|R

For the first ten miles or so, it is a dusty level. The surface is perfect; but 'twas a <b>blinding</b> white <b>thread.</b> As I toiled along it, that broiling June day, I could hear the voice of my backer, who followed on horseback, exhorting me in loud tones, 'Don't scorch, miss; don't scorch; never mind ef you lose sight of 'em. Keep your wind; that's the point. The wind, the wind's everything. Let 'em beat you on the level; you'll catch 'em up fast enough when you get on the Taunus!' ...|$|R
40|$|When {{deprived}} of sight humans adapt and use other senses for navigation. Most rely on touch (long cane), but some use auditory perception. We have observed a blind teenager echolocating using sounds (clicks) he makes with his mouth. More commonly, an ultrasonic sensor {{is used as}} a navigational aid to scan the path and environment. The echoes blind people perceive are interpreted by each individual to form an auditory scene where clear paths and obstacles are identified. With this information, the <b>blind</b> user <b>threads</b> his/her way safely through the space scanned. The work we describe here seeks to mimic a blind person using a sonar navigational aid to traverse a path or corridor. We are using a commercially available ultrasonic mobility aid to isonify and capture echoes from a corridor, we then attempt to correlate these to the geometric features of the corridor, as we perceive them. Our aim is to develop a perception system, which is capable of interpreting, in real time the echoes to discern the geometric features of the environment, so that this data can be used to navigate a robot through it. 1...|$|R
5000|$|A common {{method of}} {{threading}} is cutting with taps and dies. Unlike drill bits, hand taps do not automatically remove the chips they create. A hand tap cannot cut its threads {{in a single}} rotation because it creates long chips which quickly jam the tap (an effect known as [...] "crowding"), possibly breaking it. Therefore, in manual thread cutting, normal wrench usage is to cut the threads 1/2 to 2/3 of a turn (180 to 240 degree rotation), then reverse the tap for about 1/6 of a turn (60 degrees) until the chips are broken by the back edges of the cutters. It {{may be necessary to}} periodically remove the tap from the hole to clear the chips, especially when a <b>blind</b> hole is <b>threaded.</b>|$|R
40|$|A corrosion-inhibiting {{mixture of}} {{compounds}} {{has been developed}} for addition to the water used to rinse metal parts that have been cleaned with aqueous solutions in preparation for adhesive bonding of the metals to rubber and rubber-like materials. Prior {{to the development of}} this corrosion inhibitor, the parts (made, variously, of D 6 AC steel and 7075 -T 73 aluminum) were rinsed by deionized water, which caused corrosion in some places on the steel parts especially in such occluded places as sealing surfaces and <b>threaded</b> <b>blind</b> holes. An integral part of the particular cleaning process is the deposition of a thin layer of silicates and silane primers that increase the strength of the adhesive bond. The corrosion inhibitor is formulated, not only to inhibit corrosion of both D 6 AC steel and 7075 - T 73 aluminum, but also to either increase or at least not reduce the strength of the adhesive bond to be formed subsequently. The corrosion inhibitor is a mixture of sodium silicate and sodium tetraborate. The sodium silicate functions as both a corrosion inhibitor and a bond-strength promoter in association with the silane primers. The sodium tetraborate buffers the rinse solution at the optimum pH and functions as a secondary corrosion inhibitor for the steel. For a given application, the concentrations of sodium silicate and sodium tetraborate must be chosen in a compromise among the needs to inhibit corrosion of steel, inhibit corrosion of aluminum, and minimize cosmetic staining of both steel and aluminum. Concentrations of sodium silicate in excess of 150 parts of silicon per million parts of solution (ppm Si) have been determined to enhance inhibition of corrosion; unfortunately, because of the alkalinity of sodium silicate, even a small concentration can raise the pH of the rinse solution to such a level that aluminum becomes corroded despite the inhibiting effect. The pH of a solution that contains a high concentration of sodium silicate can be decreased by adding sodium tetraborate. On the other hand, the addition of sodium tetraborate increases the concentration of dissolved solids to such a high level that cosmetic staining becomes an issue...|$|R
