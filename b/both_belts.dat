5|$|The feud between Razor Ramon and I.R.S. ended {{shortly after}} the Royal Rumble. On the January 31, 1994 edition of Monday Night Raw, the 1-2-3 Kid stole Ramon's chains back from I.R.S., {{bringing}} the feud to an end. Shawn Michaels’ attack on Razor Ramon increased the hostility between the two. The debate over the true holder of the Intercontinental Championship was settled at WrestleMania X in a ladder match with <b>both</b> <b>belts</b> suspended above the ring. This ended the feud between Michaels and Ramon, although Ramon continued to feud with Michaels’ friend Diesel.|$|E
5|$|For the Ladder match, the Intercontinental belts {{belonging}} to Razor Ramon and Shawn Michaels were both hanging above the ring, {{and the first}} wrestler to use the ladder to reach <b>both</b> <b>belts</b> would be declared the winner. Ramon began the match by chokeslamming Michaels. Michaels recovered, however, and performed a neckbreaker on Ramon. Michaels then threw Ramon out to the ringside, where Michaels' bodyguard Diesel clotheslined Ramon. Referee Earl Hebner responded by ordering Diesel {{to return to the}} dressing rooms. Ramon pulled up the padding from the concrete floor, but he was later thrown onto it after Michaels reversed Ramon's attempt to perform the Razor's Edge. While Ramon was lying on the floor, Michaels brought the ladder to the ring and used it to hit Ramon in the stomach, chest and back. Michaels tried to retrieve the belts, but Ramon stopped him from climbing the ladder. Michaels then set the ladder up {{in the corner of the}} ring and performed a splash onto Ramon. Ramon recovered and Irish whipped Michaels into the ladder. He then hit Michaels with the ladder several times before both men tried to climb up to get the belts. Ramon suplexed Michaels off the ladder and tried to reach the belts. Michaels dropkicked the ladder, which caused Ramon to fall off. Michaels performed a superkick and a piledriver on Ramon and then propped the ladder up in the corner of the ring. Michaels climbed the turnbuckles, jumped onto the ladder, and used his weight to push it down across Ramon's chest. Michaels tried to retrieve the belts again, but Ramon pushed him off. Michaels fell into the ropes and got tangled up, allowing Ramon to get the belts and win the undisputed Intercontinental championship.|$|E

50|$|At {{around the}} same time as the battlecruiser was developed, the {{distinction}} between the armored and the unarmored cruiser finally disappeared. By the British , the first of which was launched in 1909, it was possible for a small, fast cruiser to carry <b>both</b> <b>belt</b> and deck armor, particularly when turbine engines were adopted. These light armored cruisers began to occupy the traditional cruiser role once it became clear that the battlecruiser squadrons were required to operate with the battle fleet.|$|R

25|$|On June 20, 2003, Octagón {{teamed with}} La Parka {{to win the}} Mexican National Tag Championship from the team of Electroshock and Chessman. In 2006 Octagón added another title to his {{collection}} as he won the Mexican National Middleweight title for the fourth time. With the Mexican National titles not being defended very frequently Octagón still remains the holder of <b>both</b> <b>belts</b> to this day. In December 2008 AAA announced that they will no longer recognize or promote any title that {{does not belong to}} AAA ending the long standing practice. It is unclear if the Mexican National titles will be quietly forgotten or if Octagón will, at some later time, be stripped of the titles and then put to work in a different Mexican promotion.|$|E

They defended <b>both</b> <b>belts</b> until they dropped the Canadian Tag Team Championship on July 22. They regained the title two days later but were stripped of all of their belts that August. Juggernaut held the NWA/ECCW Tag Team Championship once more, winning the belts with Dr. Luther on March 31, 2000 but losing them the same night.|$|E
500|$|The New Zealand advance was {{obstructed}} by uncut {{barbed wire}} on the Wallemolen spur; the creeping barrage was very thin, as some guns were bogged {{and others had}} been knocked out by German artillery. The creeping barrage diminished as it moved forward and howitzer shells, plunging into wet ground around the Bellevue pillboxes exploded harmlessly. The German artillery fired {{all the way to}} the rear of the New Zealand divisional area and machine-gun barrages from the German pillboxes raked the advance. The division captured the cemetery at Wallemolen and reached Wolf Copse, the right of the advance stopping on the rise astride the Ravebeek creek. North of the Gravenstafel–Metcheele road, the division gained some ground but was stopped by belts of barbed wire [...] deep and were swept by machine-gun fire. The infantry tried to cut their way through the wire of the German [...] on the Wallemolen spur and small numbers of troops got through <b>both</b> <b>belts</b> but were killed after being stopped by more wire around the German pillboxes. Further south, the New Zealand Division captured two pillboxes, with help from 3rd Australian Division troops in the area. An advance began up the northern slope of the Ravebeek creek but broke down quickly around Laamkeek. At [...] the surviving New Zealand infantry were ordered to dig-in.|$|E

Mercury employed many jazz chords (major and minor 6th, 7th, 9th, 11th and 13th harmonies), and the choruses featured these voiced as 4 and 5-part vocal harmonies. The lead vocal is very demanding and strident (highest point is a C5 <b>both</b> <b>belted</b> and in falsetto), with one of Mercury's most notable performances taking place at the Live Aid concert, at Wembley Stadium, London in 1985.|$|R

2500|$|On January 6, 2008, Jack Meléndez who {{had been}} {{managing}} La Rabia, the stable where he performed abandoned the company citing differences with the company's personnel. Following Meléndez's exit from the company the stable abandoned the company no-showing the a special event scheduled for January 6, 2008. On January 6, Maldonado appeared in the IWA's Histeria Boricua event, with the championship belt still in his possession and challenged Freddie [...] "Blitz" [...] Lozada, who was the IWA World Heavyweight Champion to a unification match. The match took place later in the event with Lozada winning <b>both</b> <b>belts.</b> Following this match WWC's merchandising manager, José Roberto Rodríguez, {{who had been}} allowed entry into the building, demanded that the belt was returned to him, {{but at the moment}} the IWA's personnel had replaced the belt with Revolution X-Treme Wrestling's championship belt (at the moment in Savio Vega's possession) and had transferred the Universal Heavyweight Championship to a secure location, which led to a discussion between personnel from both companies and Rodríguez's expulsion from the event. After the event's conclusion police officers were deployed and the IWA retained physical possession of the championship. Following this the belt was returned to WWC personnel following an ultimatum, which claimed that the company would take legal action if it wasn't returned within forty-eight hours. However, both the International Wrestling Association and the National Wrestling Alliance recognized the unification match, and considered Lozada the first Undisputed World Heavyweight Champion in Puerto Rico.|$|E
60|$|How to get {{him down}} was the next question. The branch was {{not strong enough to}} bear Tommy, though he climbed up and tried to unhook poor Billy. The belt was firmly twisted at the back, and Billy could not reach to undo it, nor could he get his legs round the branch to pull himself up. There seemed no way but to unbuckle the belt and drop. That he was afraid to try; for the ground was hard, and the fall a high one. Fortunately <b>both</b> <b>belt</b> and buckle were strong; so he hung safely, though very uncomfortably, while Tommy racked his boyish brain {{to find a way to}} help him.|$|R

40|$|Results of the swov-accident {{investigation}} {{prove that}} {{if there are any}} differences in the effectiveness of lap belts and three-point belts, these are so small that they cannot form a basis for giving preference to one type over the other. Furthermore, in spite of the results of this investigation which show some disadvantageous effects of diagonal belts (as compared to lap belts and three-point belts), involving a higher injury risk, which leads to the conclusion that general use of this type should not be favoured, a complete comdemnation of diagonal belts seems exaggerated. The effectiveness percentages of <b>both</b> lap <b>belts</b> and three-point belts show independently very high values.

5000|$|In {{traditional}} or formal settings, it {{is considered}} a faux pas to wear <b>both</b> <b>belt</b> and suspenders at the same time, though in the past this {{has not always been}} the case. Further, suspenders were traditionally considered an undergarment and, as such, were considered inappropriate to be seen. From their time of their invention until World War II, the waistcoat, or a jumper or cardigan for coolness in the summer, covered suspenders to prevent indecency. Similarly, jumpers and jackets kept the shirtsleeves hidden. In the inter-war period, however, men began removing jackets in public, and so this sensibility became eroded over time. It is perhaps only in Britain that a few 'die-hards' still consider it [...] "gauche" [...] to wear, for example, brightly colored suspenders without jacket. Generally, it is now considered acceptable fashion, {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic, for men's suspenders to be seen.|$|R
