In deep shadow in the morning, it borrows a warm glow from the setting sun at the end of the day. Its colour runs the gamut from orange to cold blue-grey, with overtones of violet and intervals of green." ...|$|E

40|$|When the CAP was {{established}} back in 1958, {{it was a}} powerful means for the economic or - even more ambitious - for the political integration of the European Community. In more recent years, however, it has been identified by {{a growing number of}} people as both the origin of mismanaged agricultural markets and of political quarrels, both within the Community and with non-member countries. Some of the well-known results of the CAP are the wine lakes and <b>butter</b> <b>mountains,</b> resulting from high guaranteed producer prices. In the summer of 19 87, they surpassed quotations on world markets by the factor of two or three in order of magnitude. Disposing surplusses on either international or national markets through export restitutions or subsidies for an inferior usage (e. g. butter as feed for calves, destination of wine for fuel-alcohol) has proved to be very costly. ...|$|R

To take advantage of these opportunities (and protect their interests) companies trading with the European bloc must be able to deal quickly and accurately with their trading partners. Information systems are already a part of many organisations' corporate strategy, but the effective implementation of Electronic Data Interchange may prove an essential pre-requisite for the greater efficiency required by those hoping to compete against a unified Europe.

40|$|It {{is known}} that simple price {{limiters}} may have unexpected consequences in irregular commodity price fluctuations between bull and bear markets and complicated impacts {{on the size of}} buffer stocks. In particular, imposing a lower price boundary may lead to a huge buffer stock, e. g. to a ?<b>butter</b> <b>mountain?</b> or a ?milk lake? and this is a real problem for regulators since storage costs may become impossible to finance over time. The relation between price limiters and the size of buffer stocks is nontrivial and there may exist some optimal price limiters which require only weak market interventions and thus provide a rather inexpensive option to regulate commodity markets. In this paper, we use a simple commodity market model to explore the relation between price limiters and the average growth rate of the buffer stocks. It is found that these optimal price limiter levels are simply the minimum values of unstable periodic orbits of the underlying deterministic system. commodity markets; price stabilization; limiter control; butter mountains and milk lakes...|$|E

50|$|The Tillamook Valley was {{ideal for}} dairy cattle in the mid-19th century, but {{transporting}} {{the milk and}} <b>butter</b> over the <b>mountains</b> surrounding the valley was a problem. In 1854, several farmers from the county built a schooner named the Morning Star to transport butter to Portland, Oregon; the schooner is now featured {{as part of the}} co-op's logo, and a replica (constructed in 1992 by master shipwright Richard Miles of Aberdeen, WA) is on display at The Tillamook Cheese Factory. Peter McIntosh and T. S. Townsend established the county's first cheese factory in 1894. The association was founded by ten independent dairy farmers in 1909. TCCA hired an ad agency and began campaigning in 1917 in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Portland.|$|R
