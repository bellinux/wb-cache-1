40|$|Electrophysiologic {{effects of}} K(ATP) channel openers (KCOs) are rarely studied for tissue and species specificity, and use-dependent {{investigations}} in human tissues are lacking. We therefore investigated in vitro the concentration-dependent {{effects of the}} KCO <b>bimakalim</b> [from 10 nM to 10 μM, at 1, 000 ms of cycle length (CL) and 37 °C] on human (atrium, n = 4, and ventricle, n = 6) and guinea pig (atrium, n = 7, and ventricle, n = 6) transmembrane action potential (AP). The frequency relation (from CL 1, 600 to 300 ms, 31 °C) of human atrial AP duration 90 % (APD 90) shortening (10 μM vs. baseline, n = 7) also was determined. A parallel study was performed with the KCO nicorandil (from 10 nM to 1 mM, n = 3) in human atrial APs, at 31 °C. Resting membrane potential and maximal upstroke velocity of AP were not modified by <b>bimakalim</b> at maximal concentration, whereas AP amplitude was decreased in both guinea pig preparations (p < 0. 05); APD 90 was shortened in all tissues (p < 0. 01). Median effective concentration (EC 50) for APD 90 shortening at 37 °C was 0. 54 and 2. 74 μM in atrial and ventricular human tissue, respectively, and 8. 55 and 0. 89 μM in atrial and ventricular guinea pig tissue, respectively. In human atrial tissue at 31 °C, EC 50 with <b>bimakalim</b> was 0. 39 μM; a much higher value was seen with nicorandil (210 μM). <b>Bimakalim</b> (10 μM) -induced APD 90 shortening {{as a function of}} stimulation rate was greatest at longest CL. Evidence is provided for (a) species (human vs. guinea pig) and tissue (atrium vs. ventricle) differential AP sensitivity to bimakalim; (b) an ≃ 500 -fold higher efficacy of <b>bimakalim</b> versus nicorandil to shorten human atrial APD 90; and (c) normal use- dependence of human atrial APD 90 shortening with <b>bimakalim</b> at 10 μM...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} three {{potassium}} channel openers, nicorandil, aprikalim, and <b>bimakalim,</b> on experimental myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion injury was examined in barbital-anaesthetizeddogs. In {{a model of}} reversible injury, administration of nicorandil at a hypotensive dose and aprikalim at a non-hypotensive dose resulted in a reduction in contractile dysfunc-tion during reperfusion ('stunning ') following brief coronary artery occlusion (15 min) when the drugs were administered before occlusion. Administration of aprikalim only during reperfusion had no beneficial effect. Pre-treatment with the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) -dependent potassium (KATP) channel antagonist, glibenclamide, blocked completely the beneficial effects of nicorandil and aprikalim, although glibenclamide did not block the haemodynamic effects of nicorandil. In a model of irreversible ischaemia j reperfusion injury (120 min of ischaemia and 30 min of reperfusion) pre-treatment with equihypotensive doses of nicorandil and <b>bimakalim</b> produced marked reductions in myocardial infarct size. Similarly, aprikalim at a non-hypotensive dose reduced myocardial infarct size in dogs subjected to 90 min of ischaemia and 5 h of reperfusion, and the protective effects of aprikalim were antagonized completely by glibenclamide. These results indicate that nicorandil, aprikalim, and <b>bimakalim</b> are protective in two experimental models of ischaemia/reperfusion injury. The mechanism of action of these agents is not completely understood, but {{it appears to be}} a result of myocardial KATP channel activation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectives: Although {{adenosine}} triphosphate–dependent {{potassium channel}} openers {{have been shown}} to enhance cardioplegic protection in animal myocardium, {{there is a lack of}} data on human cardiac tissues. We aimed at determining, on human atrial muscle, whether adenosine triphosphate– dependent potassium channels are involved in protection caused by high-potassium cardioplegia and whether adenosine triphosphate–dependent potassium channel activation might improve cardioplegic protection in an in vitro model of myocardial stunning. Methods: Human atrial trabeculae were obtained from adult patients undergoing cardiac operations. In an organ bath at 37 °C, the preparations were subjected to 60 minutes of hypoxia at a high stimulation rate either in Tyrode solution (control, n = 17) or in St Thomas’ Hospital solution without additives (n = 6) or associated with 100 nmol/L <b>bimakalim</b> (n = 7) or 1 μmol/L glibenclamide (n = 7), followed by 60 minutes of reoxygenation and 15 minutes of positive inotropic stimulation with 1 μmol/L dobutamine. Results: Atrial developed tension was reduced by hypoxia to 27 % ± 5 % of baseline and incompletely recovered after reoxygenation to 38 % ± 7 %, whereas dobutamine restored contractility to 74 % ± 7 % of basal values. St Thomas’ Hospital solution with or without <b>bimakalim</b> improved developed tension after reoxygenation and dobutamine (P <. 0001 vs control), whereas glibenclamide inhibited these protective effects of cardioplegic arrest (P =. 001 vs St Thomas’ Hospital solution). After reoxygenation, the protective effect of <b>bimakalim</b> disappeared at a high pacing rate (400 - and 300 -ms cycle length) but recovered during dobutamine superfusion. Conclusions: Adenosine triphosphate–dependent potassium channels are likely involved in the cardioprotective effects of cardioplegia in human atrial trabeculae and adenosine triphosphate–dependent potassium channel activation with <b>bimakalim</b> used as an additive to cardioplegia enhanced protection.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the role of KATP channel activation and repolarization dispersion on the ‘border zone' arrhythmias induced by ischaemia-reperfusion, the effects of glibenclamide and <b>bimakalim,</b> agents modifying action potential (AP) duration, were studied in an in vitro model of myocardial ‘border zone'. The electrophysiological effects of 10 [*]μM glibenclamide and 1 [*]μM <b>bimakalim</b> (n= 8 each), respectively KATP channel blocker and activator, were investigated on guinea-pig ventricular strips submitted partly to normal conditions (normal zone, NZ) and partly to simulated ischaemic then reperfused conditions (altered zone, AZ). By preventing the ischaemia-induced AP shortening (P< 0. 0001), glibenclamide reduced the dispersion of AP duration 90 % (APD 90) between NZ and AZ (P< 0. 0001), and concomitantly inhibited the ‘border zone' arrhythmias induced by an extrastimulus (ES), their absence being {{significantly related to the}} lessened APD 90 dispersion (χ 2 = 8. 28, P< 0. 01). <b>Bimakalim,</b> which also reduced the APD 90 dispersion (P< 0. 005) due to differential AP shortening in normal and ischaemic tissues, decreased the incidence of myocardial conduction blocks (25 % of preparations versus 83 % in control, n= 12, P< 0. 05) and favoured ‘border zone' spontaneous arrhythmias (75 % of preparations versus 25 % in control, P< 0. 05). During reperfusion, unlike <b>bimakalim,</b> glibenclamide inhibited the ES-induced arrhythmias and reduced the incidence of the spontaneous ones (12 % of preparations versus 92 % in control, P< 0. 05), this latter effect being significantly related (χ 2 = 6. 13, P< 0. 02) to the lessened ischaemia-induced AP shortening in the presence of glibenclamide (P< 0. 0001). These results suggest that KATP blockade may protect the ischaemic-reperfused myocardium from ‘border zone' arrhythmias concomitantly with a reduction of APD 90 dispersion between normal and ischaemic regions. Conversely, KATP channel activation may modify the incidence of conduction blocks and exacerbate the ischaemia-induced ‘border zone' arrhythmias...|$|E
40|$|Potassium channel openers {{are known}} to act on {{potassium}} ATP-dependent channels in cardiac tissue. Such agents may exacerbate acceleration of acute ischemia-induced ventricular repolarization and aggravate arrhythmias. To test whether activation of K-ATP channels during the healing period of myocardial infarction (MI) can still influence the electrophysiologic properties {{and the type of}} inducible arrhythmias, we investigated the effects of <b>bimakalim</b> (BIM) on sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) 4 days after ligation of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery in pigs. Programmed stimulation was performed to elicit VT prior to and after intravenous (IV) BIM. Combination monophasic action potential (MAP) /PACING catheters were used to enable simultaneous ventricular MAP recording and pacing. Ventricular effective refractory period (ERP) and MAP duration determined at 50 % and 90 % repolarization were measured prior to and after BIM. After completion of baseline measurements, BIM was consecutively given at 0. 5, 1, and 3 mu g/kg bolus followed by 0. 025, 0. 05, and 0. 1 mu g/kg per minute maintenance infusion, respectively. From a total of 23 pigs subjected to LAD ligation, 4 animals succumbed to infarction and the remaining 19 animals were studied by programmed stimulation. Only animals that exhibited reproducible and hemodynamically stable monomorphic VTs during control stimulation were selected for evaluation (n = 14). After the first, second, and third dose of BIM, the mean NIT rate was increased by 6 %, 14 % (P <. 01), and 47 % (P <. 001) compared to control values, respectively. Ventricular ERP and repolarization were significantly shortened only by the second and third dose of BIM. Of 14 pigs receiving the highest BIM dosage, 3 revealed polymorphic VTs degenerating into ventricular fibrillation (VF). Our data suggest that high BIM doses may lead to faster and more aggressive pacing-induced reentrant VTs after subacute MI. This is consistent with the drug-induced acceleration of ventricular repolarization with shortening of MAP duration and refractoriness...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we first {{investigated}} the cardiovascular actions of several classes {{of drugs in}} conscious pigs in which heart failure was induced by occluding a coronary artery 3 - 4 weeks before the studies were performed and compared the results to those observed in normal conscious animals. Positive inotropic agents and vasodilators are frequently used to treat heart failure as they may improve the depressed myocardial contractility and lower the elevated systemic vascular resistance. In chapter 2 and 3 {{the effects of the}} 1. 4 - dihydropyridine derivative calcium antagonists nisoldipine and elgodipine are studied because of their capability to unload the heart by reducing systemic vascular resistance in normal anesthetized pigs (Duncker et al., 1986 and Sassen et al [...] 1990) and by increasing cardiac output in normal conscious pigs (Duncker et aL, 1987). To study the potential advantage of vasodilators with positive inotropic properties to vasodilators alone we also investigated the actions of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor pimobendan with nisoldipine in the porcine model for heart failure (Chapter 4). In chapter 5 we describe the effects of a novel class of drugs which causes systemic vasodilation by potassium channel activation. The results of <b>bimakalim</b> are compared to the nicotinamide derivative nicorandil, which in addition to their nitrate-like properties, also possess potassium channel activator properties (Taira, 1989). One of the most prominent drugs in the treatment of ischaemic heart disease is nitroglycerin, despite the frequent occurrence of tolerance. In chapter 6 we first evaluated 5 novel nitrate-esters in normal conscious pigs. In the second part nitroglycerin and one of the novel compounds, CEDO 8956, were selected for further study of distribution of cardiac output in conscious pigs with chronic coronary artery occlusion. Tachycardia is an unwanted situation, especially in patients with coronary artery disease. Selective bradycardic agents, which exert an anti-ischemic effect because of their ability to reduce oxygen demand and improve oxygen supply of the myocardium and especially of the subendocardial layers (Schamhardt et aL, 1981, Krumpl eta!., 1988 and lndolfi et a!., 1989), may thus have some benefit in patients with left ventricular dysfunction, provided that the negative chronotropic properties are not accompanied by negative inotropic properties. We therefore studied the effects of UL-FS 49, a specific bradycardic agent and compared the results to those of the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolo...|$|E
