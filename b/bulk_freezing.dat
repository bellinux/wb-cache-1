2500|$|The {{toxicity}} of snake venom is assessed by a toxicological test called the median lethal dose, LD50, (an abbreviation for [...] "lethal dose, 50%"), which determines {{the concentration of}} a toxin required to kill half {{the members of a}} tested population of animals. [...] The potency of the venom of wild snakes varies considerably, even within any single species. This is because of assorted influences such as biophysical environment, physiological status, ecological variables, genetic variation (either adaptive or incidental) and various other molecular- and ecological evolutionary factors. Such variation necessarily is smaller in captive populations in controlled laboratory settings though it cannot be eliminated altogether. However, studies to determine snake venom lethality or potency need to be designed to minimise variability and several techniques have been designed to this end. One approach that is considered particularly helpful is to use 0.1% bovine serum albumin (also known as [...] "Fraction V" [...] in Cohn process) as a diluent in determining LD50 values for various species. It results in far more accurate and consistent median lethal dose (LD50) determinations than for example using 0.1% saline as a diluent. Fraction V produces about 95% purified albumin, which is the dried crude venom. Saline as a diluent consistently produces widely varying LD50 results for nearly all venomous snakes; it produces unpredictable variation in the purity of the precipitate (range from 35-60%). Fraction V is structurally stable because it has seventeen disulfide bonds; it is unique in that it has the highest solubility and lowest isoelectric point of all the major plasma proteins. This makes it the final fraction to be precipitated from its solution. Bovine serum albumin is located in fraction V. The precipitation of albumin is done by reducing the pH to 4.8, which is near the pI of the proteins, and maintaining the ethanol concentration to be 40%, with a protein concentration of 1%. Thus, only 1% of the original plasma remains in the fifth fraction. When the ultimate goal of plasma processing is a purified plasma component for injection or transfusion, the plasma component must be highly pure. The first practical large-scale method of blood plasma fractionation was developed by Edwin J. Cohn during World War II. It is known as the Cohn process (or Cohn method). This process is also known as cold ethanol fractionation as it involves gradually increasing the concentration of ethanol in the solution at 5oC and 3oC. [...] The Cohn Process exploits differences in properties of the various plasma proteins, specifically, the high solubility and low pI of albumin. As the ethanol concentration is increased in stages from 0% to 40% the [...] is lowered from neutral (pH ~ 7) to about 4.8, which is near the pI of albumin. [...] At each stage certain proteins are precipitated out of the solution and removed. The final precipitate is purified albumin. Several variations to this process exist, including an adapted method by Nitschmann and Kistler that uses less steps, and replaces centrifugation and <b>bulk</b> <b>freezing</b> with filtration and diafiltration. Some newer methods of albumin purification add additional purification steps to the Cohn Process and its variations. Chromatographic albumin processing {{as an alternative to the}} Cohn Process emerged in the early 1980s, however, it was not widely adopted until later due to the inadequate availability of large scale chromatography equipment. Methods incorporating chromatography generally begin with cryo-depleted plasma undergoing buffer exchange via either diafiltration or buffer exchange chromatography, to prepare the plasma for following ion exchange chromatography steps.

40|$|AbstractNumerous {{biopharmaceuticals}} {{are produced}} in recombinant microorganisms in the controlled environment of a bioreactor, {{a process known}} as Upstream Process. To minimize product loss due to physico-chemical and enzymatic degradation, the Upstream Process should be directly followed by product purification, known as Downstream Process. However, the Downstream Process can be technologically complex and time-consuming which is why Upstream and Downstream Process usually have to be decoupled temporally and spatially. Consequently, the product obtained after the Upstream Process, known as intermediate bulk, has to be stored. In those circumstances, a freezing procedure is often performed to prevent product loss. However, the freezing process itself is inseparably linked to physico-chemical changes of the intermediate bulk which may in turn damage the product. The present study analysed the behaviour of a Tris-buffered intermediate bulk containing a biopharmaceutically relevant protein during a bottle freezing process. Major damaging mechanisms, like the spatiotemporal redistribution of ion concentrations and pH, and their influence on product stability were investigated.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that a fluid near a topographically {{patterned}} wall exhibits crystallization below the <b>bulk</b> <b>freezing</b> point (so-called precrystallization). In detail, a periodic array of fixed hard spheres is considered as a wall pattern. The actual type of the pattern corresponds to a face-centred-cubic (fcc) lattice cut along the (111), (100) or (110) orientation, a hexagonal-close-packed (hcp) solid with (110) orientation {{as well as a}} rhombic lattice distorted with respect to the triangular one. The fluid is represented by mobile hard spheres of the same diameter as the fixed wall spheres. By computer simulation we find complete wetting by a crystalline sheet proceeding via a cascade of layering transitions as the <b>bulk</b> <b>freezing</b> point is approached for the fcc (111) and hcp (110) cases, provided that the wall crystal lattice exactly matches that of the coexisting bulk crystal. On the other hand, there is incomplete wetting for the fcc (100) and (110) cases. The freezing of the first layer starts at lower bulk pressures for a lattice with a larger lattice constant as compared to that of the coexisting bulk crystal. A rhombic pattern either results in incomplete wetting by a solid sheet, which is unstable as a bulk phase, or prevents wetting completely. Using a phenomenological theory we derive scaling relations for the thickness of the crystalline layer which are confirmed by the simulation data.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{the present}} work was to {{quantify}} accessible porosities for iodide and for a water tracer (HTO) on water-saturated compacted clay samples (illite, montmorillonite and MX- 80 bentonite) and to relate these macroscopic values to the forms of water in these porosities (surface/bulk water, external/internal water). Low field proton NMR was used to characterize and quantify the forms of water. This enabled the three different populations (structural OH, external surface and internal surface water) to be differentiated on hydrated clays by considering the difference in proton mobility. An accurate description of the water forms within the different populations did not appear possible when water molecules of these populations were in contact because of the occurrence of rapid exchange reactions. For this reason, {{it was not possible}} to use the low resolution NMR method to quantify external surface and bulk water in fully water-saturated compacted clay media at room temperature. This latter information could however be estimated when analyzing the samples at - 25 °C. At this temperature, a distinction based on the difference in mobility could be made since surface water remained in a semi-liquid state whereas <b>bulk</b> water <b>froze.</b> In parallel, accessible porosities for anions and HTO were determined by an isotopic dilution method using capillaries to confine the materials. HTO was shown to probe the whole pore volume (i. e. the space made of surface and bulk water). When the surface water volume was mainly composed of interlayer water (case of montmorillonite and bentonite), iodide was shown to be located in the pore space made of bulk water.

We re-fer to the peak at the lowest temperature as “standard peak...|$|E
40|$|We report {{studies of}} the growth of solid hcp 4 He at {{pressures}} higher than the <b>bulk</b> <b>freezing</b> pressure using a cell design that allows us to inject atoms into the solid. Near the melting curve during injection we observe random events during which the pressure recorded in the cell drops abruptly. These events are accompanied by transient increases in the temperature of the cell. We discuss these transients and conclude that they represent the solidification of meta-stable liquid regions and the associated relief of strain in the local solid. We also observe that further from the melting curve the transients are no longer recorded, but that we can continue to add atoms to the solid, increasing its density at fixed volume. We document these changes in density with respect to changes in the chemical potential as a function of temperature and discuss these in the context of recent theoretical work...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWater is an {{integral}} part of the structure in biological porous materials such as wood and starch. A problem often encountered in the preparation of samples for, e. g., electron microscopy is that removal of water leads to a decreasing distance between supermolecular structural elements and a distortion of the structure. It is, therefore, of interest to find methods to investigate these materials in the native water-swollen state. We present a method to study water-swollen biological porous structures using NMR to determine the amount and self-diffusion of water within the porous objects. The contribution of bulk water to the NMR signal is eliminated by performing experiments below the <b>bulk</b> <b>freezing</b> temperature. Further decrease of the temperature leads to a gradual freezing of water within the porous objects. The contribution of the freezing water fraction to the migration of water through the porous network is, thus, estimated. The results are rationalized in terms of the ultrastructure of the samples studied, namely, wood pulp fibers and potato starch granules...|$|E
40|$|Two {{shortfalls}} in estimating {{current and}} future seasonal budgets of methane efflux in Arctic regions are the paucity of non-summer measurements and an incomplete understanding of the sensitivity of methane emissions to changes in tundra moisture. A recent study in one Arctic region highlighted the former by observing a previously unknown large methane pulse during the onset of autumn soil freeze. This study addresses these research gaps by presenting an analysis of eddy covariance measurements of methane efflux and supporting environmental variables during the autumn season of 2009 and associated soil freeze-in period at our large-scale water manipulation site near Barrow, Alaska (the Biocomplexity Experiment). We found that methane emissions during the autumn were closely tied to liquid soil moisture in the top 30 cm of soil. Declines in soil moisture between manipulated wet, intermediate, and dry conditions {{as well as through}} time during the soil freeze-in period led to corresponding declines in methane efflux. During the period of soil freeze-in (from 23 September to 28 October), we estimate that our wet section emitted 623 mg CH 4 m− 2 while the dry section emitted only 253 mg CH 4 m− 2 , the average of which represents 18 % of net emissions from the typically measured growing season. We did not find evidence for a pulse in methane emissions during soil freeze at this site. Results from this study imply that future changes in tundra moisture will have a large effect on methane emissions in this region, and changes which span the saturation point are likely to have the largest effect. We speculate that changes in autumn soil moisture are also likely to affect winter emissions via the insulative effects of ice on winter soil temperature and liquid soil moisture availability after <b>bulk</b> soil <b>freeze.</b> Further research should expand the use of eddy covariance methane flux measurements to investigate ecosystem-level effects of tundra moisture on autumn and winter methane emissions in this and other Arctic regions...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{a recent}} {{published}} paper Knopf et a 1. (2002) {{have suggested that}} the homogeneous freezing behavior of stratospheric aerosols, under polar winter conditions, can be simulated experimentally in large bulk phase-sized droplet samples (0. 12 - 0. 27 cm in diameter). Their hypothesis is {{based on the fact that}} a nucleus, which freezes the supercooled phase, forms within the bulk volume of a given sample, and therefore, if large <b>bulk</b> volumes don't <b>freeze</b> in the laboratory, then small volumes in particles most certainly remain unfrozen in the stratosphere. The important question to ask here is whether their initial hypothesis, which they have used to analyze their data, is even correct to begin with. For example, does a nucleus, which turns over the phase, forms within the bulk volume or on the surface of the supercooled phase? Some recent studies provide both experimental (Tabazadeh et al., 2002 a, b) and theoretical (Djikaev et al., 2002, 2003) support for the formation of the nucleus at the surface of a supercooled droplet. If the homogeneous nucleation process initiates at the droplet surface, then the approach taken by Knopf. et al. to study this crystallization process may not be directly applicable to the stratospheric situation...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to determin the major stress factors during {{large-scale}} freezing of pharmaceutical protein solutions. The stability of four protein bulk solutions during several freeze-thaw cycles was studied, in order to characterise two different large scale freezing systems and identify the specific stress factors. In the third part of the study, a stable formulation for a bulk protein solution during large scale freezing could be developed. The stability of a monoclonal antibody (Daclizumab) could be obtained by the addition of disaccharides or the replacement of the existing buffer media. Results and Conclusions The KVS-System is a completely new system for freezing and thawing of therapeutic protein solution in industrial scale. The Systems provides the possibility to <b>freeze</b> and thaw <b>bulk</b> solutions very quickly. The results showed, that freezing processes in the KVS-System may be associated with an increased risk of protein loss. With an increasing volume of bulk solution cumulative stress factors were observed: A volume of 15 to 20 % of the <b>bulk</b> solution is <b>freezing</b> at a significantly higher concentration of protein, because of the cryoconcentration phenomena. Additionally, considerable interactions of the solution with the headspace takes place, leading in some cases to interface induced aggregation. Protein loss (precipitation) can be eliminated by optimization of the bulk formulation. The results suggest, that precipitation is a pH-dependent phenomenon. After optimization of the bulk formulation, a high stability of the protein could be demonstrated for all tested bulk substances. The stability of four proteins during freezing in the Integrated Biosystems® CryoWedge was studied. The amount of precipitated protein during freezing in the CryoWedge was significantly lower than in the KVS-System. The dimension of cryoconentration during freezing processes in the CryoWedge was reduced in comparison to the KVS-System. But within a small worste case area (0. 5 %), considerable cryoconcentration could be detected as well. The results from the preformulation study of a monoclonal antibody point out, that detremental effects of the buffer media, e. g. pH-shift, cannot be settled by the use of the CryoWedge. Studies on the stability of the monoclonal antibody Daclizumab showed a significant increase of aggregates after freeze-thaw-cycles in a PBS-buffer media. It could be demonstrated that the reason for the instability was the pH-shift of the freezing buffer. Replacing sodium phosphate with potassium phosphate stabilized the protein. The same effect could be detected by adding sucrose (120 mM) or trehalose (40 mM) to the PBS-buffered antibody solution. The formation of insoluble protein particles could be reduced significantly by the addition of polysorbate 80 (0. 01 % m/V), whereas the amount of soluble aggregates detected by SE-HPLC could not be affected. The results demonstrate, that a prerequisite for high protein stability is an optimized <b>bulk</b> formulation. Modern <b>freezing</b> systems can not stabilize the protein against unfavorable conditions caused by the formulation. Buffer media showing pH-shift can lead to dimerization and precepitation. Disaccharides such as trehalose and sucrose can prevent dimerization in spite of the detected pH-shift, whereas polysorbate reduced the amount of precipitated protein significantly...|$|R
