5|$|Soaring {{demand for}} coffee and rubber brought Brazil an influx of revenue in the early 1900s. Simultaneously, there was a drive {{on the part of}} {{prominent}} Brazilians, most notably the Baron of Rio Branco, to have the country recognized as an international power. A large naval acquisition program was drawn up and passed by the National Congress of Brazil in October 1904 in accordance with their belief that a powerful navy would <b>be</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>to</b> the achievement of this goal, but it was two years before any ships were ordered.|$|E

25|$|News analysts {{questioned}} {{the need for}} a Quebec lieutenant, as Martin was bilingual. In addition, polls showed fading support for the Bloc Québécois and Parti Québécois (who lost the 2003 provincial election), suggesting less need for a lieutenant.

He considered Lapierre to <b>be</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>to</b> winning over part of the nationalist vote.|$|E
25|$|Overproduction of {{collagen}} {{is thought}} to result from an autoimmune dysfunction, in which the immune system starts to attack the kinetochore of the chromosomes. This would lead to genetic malfunction of nearby genes. T cells accumulate in the skin; these are thought to secrete cytokines and other proteins that stimulate collagen deposition. Stimulation of the fibroblast, in particular, seems to <b>be</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>to</b> the disease process, and studies have converged on the potential factors that produce this effect.|$|E

Also, {{in an effort to}} increase the pool of T-28 pilots, the CIA began training several dozen Hmong pilot candidates in Thailand. Seven of them would graduate as T-28 pilots; others would become transport or liaison pilots; a few would become helicopter pilots. Washouts from the program were repurposed as aerial observers, often flying with the Raven FACs.|$|E

25|$|Crocodiles, most {{sea turtles}} and some lizards control {{offspring}} gender by manipulating {{the temperature of}} the developing eggs' environment; i.e. they do not have distinct sex chromosomes. Live-bearing reptiles do not regulate sex through incubation temperature. A study in 2009, which examined 94 living species of reptiles, birds and mammals, found that the genetic control of sex appears to <b>be</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>to</b> live birth. It was concluded that with marine reptiles such control predated viviparity and was an adaptation to the stable sea-climate in coastal regions. Genetics likely controlled sex in ichthyosaurs, mosasaurs and plesiosaurs.|$|E

Since the goal of much education is behavioural change, the understanding of behaviour afforded by behavioural change theories provides insight into the formulation of effective teaching methods that tap into the mechanisms of behavioural change. In an era when education programs strive to reach large audiences with varying socioeconomic statuses, the designers of such programs increasingly strive to understand the reasons behind behavioural change in order to understand universal characteristics that may <b>be</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>to</b> program design.|$|E
25|$|Several Epac-selective cAMP analogs {{have been}} {{developed}} to clarify the functional roles of Epacs as well those of the Epac-dependent signaling pathway distinct from the PKA-dependent signaling pathway. The modifications of 8-position in the purine structure and 2’-position in ribose is considered to <b>be</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>to</b> the specificity for Epacs. So far, 8-pCPT-2’-O-Me-cAMP (8-pCPT) and its membrane permeable form 8-pCPT-AM are used for their great specificity toward Epacs. Sulfonylurea drugs (SUs), widely used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes through stimulation of insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells, have also been shown to specifically activate Epac2.|$|E

25|$|Trauma deaths {{occur in}} immediate, early, or late stages. Immediate deaths usually {{are due to}} apnea, severe brain or high spinal cord injury, or rupture of the heart or of large blood vessels. Early deaths occur within minutes to hours and often are due to hemorrhages in the outer meningeal layer of the brain, torn arteries, blood around the lungs, air around the lungs, {{ruptured}} spleen, liver laceration, or pelvic fracture. Immediate access to care may <b>be</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>to</b> prevent death in persons experiencing major trauma. Late deaths occurs days or weeks after the injury and often are related to infection. Prognosis is better in countries with a dedicated trauma system where injured persons are provided quick and effective access to proper treatment facilities.|$|E
25|$|Hagler's next {{challenger}} was Sugar Ray Leonard, who {{was returning}} to the ring after a three-year retirement (having fought just once in the previous five years.) During the pre-fight negotiations, in return for granting Hagler {{a larger share of}} the purse Leonard obtained several conditions which would <b>be</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>to</b> his strategy; a 22x22ft ring, 12oz gloves and the fight was to be over 12—not 15—rounds. Leonard was 2 years younger, had half as many fights, and unbeknownst to Hagler, had engaged in several 'real' fights behind closed doors (i.e. gloves, rounds, a referee, judges and no head gear) in order to shake off his ring rust. The fight took place at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas on April 6, 1987. Hagler was the betting favorite.|$|E
25|$|In March 2007, in {{the second}} leg of the Champions League round of 16 against Bayern Munich, Roberto Carlos failed to control the backpass when Madrid kicked off, {{allowing}} Bayern's Hasan Salihamidžić to steal the ball and feed to Roy Makaay, who scored the quickest goal in Champions League history at 10.12 seconds. Roberto Carlos bore the brunt of criticism for that mistake {{which led to the}} team's elimination from the Champions League, and, on 9 March 2007, he announced he would leave Real Madrid upon the expiration of his contract {{at the end of the}} 2006–07 season. His final goal for Real Madrid was a stoppage time winner against Recreativo de Huelva with three games remaining in the 2006–07 La Liga season. The goal proved to <b>be</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>to</b> Real Madrid winning its 30th league title as they eventually finished level on points with Barcelona, becoming champions via the head-to-head rule. Madrid clinched La Liga in Roberto Carlos' final match, a 3–1 win over Mallorca at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium.|$|E

25|$|Around 4,000 soldiers, {{from two}} brigades of the U.S.-trained 15th Division of the Iraqi army, {{including}} Sunni tribal fighters (considered by Peshmerga commanders to <b>be</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>to</b> hold the traditionally Sunni areas), met stiff resistance. It {{was reported that}} they were attacked by suicide bombers as well as with mortars and machine guns, which stopped the advance for the time being. Warplanes of the U.S.-led coalition against ISIL launched multiple airstrikes on at least two locations. 200 U.S. Marines had set up a small outpost called Firebase Bell in the previous weeks. From there they provided artillery and targeting support for Iraqi forces. The presence of U.S. Marines became known after one of them was recently killed by the detonation of a roadside bomb. Kurdish Peshmerga forces didn't take an active part, contenting themselves with holding the front line at what they consider the border of their territory. It was announced on 27 March that Abu Furqan al-Misry, an ISIL commander and executioner who was a notorious figure in the region, had been killed.|$|E

500|$|Kenyatta {{sought to}} gain the {{confidence}} of the white settler community. In 1962, the white minority had produced 80% of the country's exports and were a vital part of its economy, yet between 1962 and 1963 they were leaving Kenya at a rate of 700 a month; Kenyatta feared that this white exodus would cause a brain drain and skills shortage that would be detrimental to the economy. He was also aware that {{the confidence of the}} white minority would <b>be</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>to</b> securing Western investment in Kenya's economy. Kenyatta made it clear that when in power, he would not sack any white civil servants unless there were competent black individuals capable of replacing them. He was sufficiently successful that a number of prominent white Kenyans backed KANU in the subsequent election.|$|E

500|$|At {{the same}} time, Gilbert created several [...] "fairy comedies" [...] at the Haymarket Theatre. This series of plays was founded upon {{the idea of}} self-revelation by {{characters}} {{under the influence of}} some magic or some supernatural interference. The first was The Palace of Truth (1870), based partly on a story by Madame de Genlis. [...] In 1871, with Pygmalion and Galatea, one of seven plays that he produced that year, Gilbert scored his greatest hit to date. [...] Together, these plays and their successors such as The Wicked World (1873), Sweethearts (1874), and Broken Hearts (1875), did for Gilbert on the dramatic stage what the German Reed entertainments had done for him on the musical stage: they established that his capabilities extended far beyond burlesque, won him artistic credentials, and demonstrated that he was a writer of wide range, as comfortable with human drama as with farcical humour. The success of these plays, especially Pygmalion and Galatea, gave Gilbert a prestige that would <b>be</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>to</b> his later collaboration with as respected a musician as Sullivan.|$|E

[...] After going on to Mendoza they were returning by a different pass when they found a petrified forest of fossilised trees, crystallised in a sandstone escarpment showing him {{that they had been}} on a Pacific beach when the land sank, burying them in sand which had been compressed into rock, then had gradually been raised with the continent to stand at [...] in the mountains. On returning to Valparaiso with half a mule's load of specimens he wrote to his father that his findings, if accepted, would <b>be</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>to</b> the theory of the formation of the world. After another gruelling expedition in the Andes while the Beagle was refitted he rejoined it and sailed to Lima, but found an armed insurrection in progress and had to stay with the ship. Here he was writing up his notes when he realised that Lyell's idea that coral atolls were on the rims of rising extinct volcanoes made less sense than the volcanoes gradually sinking so that the coral reefs around the island kept building themselves close to sea level and became an atoll as the volcano disappeared below. This was a theory he would examine when they reached such islands.|$|E
