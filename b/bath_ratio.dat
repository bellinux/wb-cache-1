40|$|It is {{impossible}} to deposit aluminum from aqueous solution because hydrogen generation occur before aluminum deposition. A dimethyl sulfone {{is one of the}} most promising candidates for non-aqueous solvent. The plating solution was composed of aluminum chloride and dimethyl sulfone. Since a melting point of dimethyl sulfone is from 107 to 109 ℃, a plating temperature is necessary to be higher than this value. However, the aluminum plating at the plating temperature lower than 130 ℃ was not reproducible. Results of thermal desorption spectrometry(TDS) showed that a desorption peak of H 2 O was 126 ℃. The following plating was performed after dehydration at 150 ℃ and the plating temperature was 150 ℃. The uniform aluminum plating was occurred at current density more than 2. 0 A/dm 2, and the plating at current density more than 8. 0 A/dm 2, delamination was observed. Then the optimum current density is 6. 0 A/dm 2. The edge of substrate masked to improve uniformity of deposition. A ratio of dimethyl sulfone to aluminum chloride is controlled at 10 : 3, 10 : 5, 10 : 7 and 10 : 10. The deposits from the <b>bath</b> from the <b>ratio</b> of 10 : 3 and 10 : 5 showed high uniformity and good adhesion between deposits and substrates.

The reactor {{used in this}} study was also equipped with auxiliaries such as a stirrer, thermocouples, nozzles, and a pressure gauge. The reaction was initiated by immersing the reactor into molten salt <b>bath</b> (mass <b>ratio</b> of salt was adjusted to K 2 NO 3 :NaNO 2 :NaNO 3  =  6 : 5 : 1). After lapse of predefined time, the reactor was taken out of the bath and subsequently quenched to stop the reaction. HPLC high-pressure pump was used for feeding the distilled water to the reactor to adjust the reaction pressure precisely. The reaction temperature was measured by K-type thermocouple and pressure with digital pressure gauge. The reactor was loaded with deionized water and initial sewage sludge (2 wt % of deionized water) for every experiment (250  rpm and particles size 180  μm). The amount of catalyst was 20 wt % of the organic waste. Then, the air in the reactor was replaced with argon gas. The reactor was sealed and put into the sand bath heated at reaction temperature. It took about 3  min for the reactor to reach the setting reaction temperature around 700  °C. It took about 2  min for final setting of the reaction pressure and reaction time will be considered as zero. As the reaction pressure increased by about 1  MPa than the initial reaction pressure for all experiments, the reaction pressure was assumed to be the initial reaction pressure of the experiment.|$|R

Design A cohort study of village residents, a case-control study, and assessment of environmental cultures taken from steam baths. Setting Village in southwestern Alaska. Participants 1 adult member from 77 of the 92 house-holds in the village was interviewed; 115 residents {{with at least one}} boil occurring between January 1 and December 12, 1996 were considered to be cases; 209 residents without a boil acted as the control group. All 459 village residents were included in the cohort study. Main outcome measure Rate of infection among all residents and residents who regularly took steam baths, risk factors for infection, and relative risk of infection. Results 115 people (25 %) had had at least one boil. Men {{were more likely to have}} had a boil than women (relative risk 1. 5; 95 % confidence interval 1. 1 to 2. 2). The highest rate of infection was among people ages 25 - 34 years (32 / 76; 42 %). No children younger than 2 years had had boils. Boils were associated with using a steam <b>bath</b> (odds <b>ratio</b> 8. 1; 3. 3 to 20. 1).

40|$|International audienceMagnetic natural films {{composed}} of alginate and maghemite nanoparticles are studied. A surface treatment by citrate ions {{of the magnetic}} nanoparticles is first required to limit interactions with carboxylate functions of alginate and to stabilize them in neutral pH. Sodium alginate films, with or without nanoparticles, are immersed in a calcium chloride bath to convert them into mixed sodium/calcium alginate films. The ion exchange process is quantified by the degree of substitution (DS) deduced from sodium and calcium content obtained by at. absorption spectroscopy. The magnetic nanoparticle content is also analyzed to correlate {{the release of the}} particles to the amt. of calcium present in the film. Nanoparticles do not significantly change the ion exchange process. Water insol. films, which do not release magnetic nanoparticles, are obtained for a complete conversion of sodium alginate into calcium alginate (DS value is thus close to the stoichiometric ratio equal to 0. 5). Such increase in water resistance of alginate films is caused by the formation of a dense network by crosslinking of the alginate polymer with Ca ions which prevents the alginate from going out of the film. Swelling properties of the mixed films are then investigated as a function of calcium concn. and nanoparticles content. It is found that the swelling ability in water of the films decreases by increasing the immersion time in CaCl 2 <b>bath,</b> the swelling <b>ratio</b> is thus a measure of the extent of crosslinking...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: We {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the efficacy of warm water sitz baths in patients who have undergone transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) owing to lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia. Materials and Methods: We reviewed the records of 1, 783 patients who had undergone TURP between 2001 and 2009. In the warm water sitz bath group, patients were instructed {{to sit in a}} tub containing lukewarm water at 40 - 45 o C for 10 minutes each time. Patients were advised to perform the procedure for at least 5 days immediately after the removal of a Foley urethral catheter. The differences in post-TURP complications between the warm water sitz bath group and the no sitz bath group were compared. Results: After TURP, 359 of the 1, 561 patients performed a warm water sitz bath. Complications after TURP, such as hemorrhage, urinary tract infection, urethral stricture, and acute urinary retention were found in 19 (5. 3 %) and 75 (6. 2 %) patients in the sitz bath and no sitz bath groups, respectively (p= 0. 09). There was a significant difference in postoperative complications such as urethral stricture between the warm sitz bath group and the no sitz bath group (p= 0. 04). The group that did not undergo warm water sitz bath treatment showed a 1. 13 -fold increased risk of rehospitalization within 1 month after TURP due to postoperative complications compared with the warm water sitz <b>bath</b> group (odds <b>ratio</b> [OR]= 1. 134; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 022 to 1. 193; p= 0. 06). Conclusions: Warm water sitz bath treatment reduced postoperative complications such as urethral stricture. These results suggest that large-scale prospective studies are needed to establish an ideal method and optimal duration of sitz baths.

Most of the neonatal deaths are preventable through simple and cost-effective essential newborn care interventions. Studies to document the determinants of unhealthy newborn care practices are scarce. Objective: The objective {{of this study is}} to describe the pattern of neonatal care practices and their determinants in rural Bangladesh. Methodology: This study is based on baseline data of a community-based intervention to assess impact of limited postnatal care services on maternal and neonatal health-seeking behavior. Data from 510 women, who had a live birth at home 1 year prior to survey, of six randomly selected unions of an Upazila (subdistrict) were analyzed. Results: Majority of the respondents were at an age group of 20 – 34 years. Only 6 % had delivery by skilled providers. Immediate drying and wrapping, and giving colostrums to newborns were almost universal. Unhealthy practices, like unclean cord care (42 %), delayed initiation of breastfeeding (60 %), use of prelacteals (36 %), and early bathing (71 %) were very common. Muslims were more likely to give early <b>bath</b> (adjusted odds <b>ratio</b> [OR]: 2. 01; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 13 – 3. 59; P= 0. 018) and delay in initiating breastfeeding (adjusted OR: 1. 45; 95 % CI: 1. 18 – 1. 78; P< 0. 001) to newborns.

Physical properties of finished fabrics were evaluated for total crease recovery (TCRA, AATCC Test 66 - 2003), tensile strength (ISO 13934 - 1 : 1999), tearing strength (ASTM D 1424 - 09), bending length (ASTM D 1388), air permeability (AP, BS 5636) and for assessment of whiteness index, spectrophotometer (Datacolor Check, USA) was used at 400  nm wavelength.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Desizing-scouring-bleaching-dyeing {{of cotton}} fabrics in one-bath was {{discussed}} in this paper. The appropriate reactive dyes, refined enzyme and H 2 O 2 elimination agent and dyeing technology parameters were selected preciously and the optimum conditions were obtained: H 2 O 2 (30 %) 4 g/L, refined enzyme 2 g/L, Na 2 SiO 3 2 g/L, Peregal O 1 g/L, <b>bath</b> <b>ratio</b> 1 : 20, scoring and bleaching at 95 °C for 45 min. Then, adding sulfourea 12 g/L, controlling pH 7, adding reactive red dye 3 BS 3 % in raffinate, dyeing at 35 °C for 30 min and fixing at 70 °C for 30 min. Compared the one-bath process with the traditional one, the former can get similar performance on dyeing. In addition, the former shows such advantages as short time, high efficiency, low energy consumption and reduced sewage emission. “One-bath ” dyeing process is a promising approach to replace the old one...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to provide a green agent for hemp {{degumming}} process. In the study, plasma acid was collected by processing distilled water with dielectric barrier discharge device under atmospheric pressure. Then the plasma acid was used in hemp degumming process. The facilities and instruments required in the whole procedure were easy operation and low cost. In this experiment, <b>bath</b> <b>ratio,</b> temperature and processing time were main factors. The optimal scheme of plasma acid degumming process was proposed through orthogonal experiment. The results of the pectin and lignin removal rate tests revealed that plasma acid was effective in hemp degumming process. After plasma acid treatment, the content of pectin and lignin was decreased by 58. 553 % and 43. 70 %, respectively. After plasma acid treatment, the cellulose structure of hemp fiber has not been changed by the XRD analysis. Lots of single fibrils were clearly seen in the SEM images...|$|E
