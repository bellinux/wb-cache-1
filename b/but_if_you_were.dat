I {{had nothing to do with}} the January article remember, my work begins to appear in February. Mr. McClure is ill from worry and anxiety...|$|E
25|$|Military {{training}} and strategy are two important matters {{on which the}} sources are more than usually silent. There are no references in literature or laws to men training, {{and so it is}} necessary to fall back on inference. For the noble warrior, his childhood was of first importance in learning both individual military skills and the teamwork essential for success in battle. Perhaps the games the youthful Cuthbert played ('wrestling, jumping, running, and every other exercise') had some military significance. Turning to strategy, of the period before Alfred the evidence gives the Impression that Anglo-Saxon armies fought battles frequently. If this is not solely due to the deficiencies of the sources, it would make England a special case. Battle was risky and best avoided unless all the factors were on your side. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> in a position so advantageous that you were willing to take the chance, it is likely that your enemy would be in such a weak position that he would avoid battle and pay tribute. Unless, of course, he was Bede's Oswald and trusted in God. Anyway, battle put the princes' lives at risk, as is demonstrated by the Northumbrian and Mercian overlordships brought to an end by a defeat in the field. Gillingham has shown how few pitched battles successful Charlemagne and Richard I chose to fight.|$|E

Oakwood was a [...] "restricted community"; Jews {{were not allowed}} to reside or own stores there. According to Leonard Spialter, president of the Dayton Jewish Genealogical Society, [...] "if you were dead, you could be buried in Oakwood, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> alive, you couldn’t live there". Relatives began moving those buried at the Rubicon cemetery to the new [...] "Riverview Cemetery", including Lebensburger, who had died by this time. This process was not completed until 1967.|$|E

500|$|Rhodes coached at Harrow School until 1936. Cricket {{was very}} {{important}} to the school, and they were following the lead of Eton College who had appointed George Hirst as their coach. However, Rhodes's personality and generally critical nature did not communicate well with privileged schoolboys who were accustomed to getting their own way, and he was eventually replaced with the more genial and sympathetic Middlesex professional Patsy Hendren. This was in contrast to the success Hirst enjoyed at Eton. According to Bowes, Rhodes had vast technical knowledge, but unlike Hirst {{did not know how to}} get the best out of people. [...] " [...] could not relate to beginners. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> a Test match player looking to get advice, Wilfred was superb." ...|$|E
500|$|Farrell exalted the lyricism of the song, {{stating that}} [...] "Sophie's music has never sounded so lyrically rich" [...] and her [...] "storytelling skills" [...] were visible in it. Considine named the song a [...] "welcome break from lullabies (such as 'The Deer and the Wolf') that risk monotony" [...] on the album. Conversely, AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine {{described}} [...] "Love Is a Camera" [...] as a [...] "bogged down in pretension" [...] moment in Wanderlust; Erlewine {{went on to}} criticize the song's [...] "ceaseless pomp". Kate Bennett of musicOMH wrote that [...] "Love Is a Camera" [...] was [...] "more of the same" [...] "heroine-gazing-forlornly-into-the-distance." [...] She elaborated, [...] "You'd {{have to have a}} heart of cold, igneous rock not to enjoy [...] just a little, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> never a member of your local youth theatre company the sticky-sweetness of it all quickly becomes cloying." [...] The song peaked at number 32 on the UK Airplay Chart, while on the UK Indie chart it reached number 33.|$|E

I think it's fair to say we've become pretty polarized, perhaps because of the political season. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> elected president, or whoever is elected president, will you set a priority in trying to bring the nation back together?

2500|$|In The Life-Giving Church, Haggard {{sets forth}} bylaws he {{initiated}} that {{are meant to}} help other churches with forming their own bylaws. From the Statement of Faith, to the replacement of a new pastor, the entire set of bylaws is listed {{in the back of}} this book. A significant part of the bylaws is the universal pay scale Haggard instituted for all pastoral staff. Including himself, all pastors were paid on the same scale so that the longer one was employed, the better the pay became. There were also provisions for numbers of children in a family and years of pastoral experience. [...] "I was there longer than {{a lot of the other}} people <b>but,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> a youth pastor there, at five years you were making what I was making at five years." ...|$|E
2500|$|Several of Károlyi's {{athletes from}} the [...] "six-pack" [...] era have criticized his {{training}} methods. Some {{of his former}} athletes, including Kristie Phillips, Dominique Moceanu, and Erica Stokes, have stated publicly that Károlyi was verbally and psychologically abusive during workouts. Károlyi's constant critical remarks about weight and body type were said to drive some gymnasts to develop eating disorders and low self-esteem. Some gymnasts, such as Phillips, Moceanu, and 1988 Olympian Chelle Stack, have also said they were compelled to continue training and competing even when coping with serious injuries such as broken bones. In one interview, Moceanu, {{who was one of}} Károlyi's final protégés, said: [...] "I'm sure Bela saw injuries, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> injured, Bela didn't want to see it. ...
