40|$|Four short {{nucleotide}} sequences (boxes I to IV) {{contribute to}} the light responsiveness of the parsley chalcone synthase promoter. The sequence-related <b>boxes</b> <b>II</b> and III resemble several plant, viral, and bacterial promoter elements that share ACGT core sequences and are associated with diversely regulated genes. We have analyzed the binding characteristics and protein-protein interactions of factors from nuclear extracts and of three putative leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors potentially involved in the regulation of this promoter. These common plant regulatory factors (CPRFs) bind specifically to <b>boxes</b> <b>II</b> and III {{as well as other}} ACGT-containing promoter elements (hex 1, Em 1 a, and as- 1), though with markedly different affinities. Intact bZIP domains are crucial for CPRF binding to DNA. Distinct ensembles of nuclear factors bind to <b>boxes</b> <b>II</b> and III, despite their sequence similarity. The parsley CPRFs bind to DNA as dimers, selectively form heterodimeric DNA binding complexes, and interact with nuclear proteins...|$|R

50|$|Before the Second World War, {{there were}} two {{mechanical}} signal boxes in Neu-Ulm of the Bruchsal class, which were called signal boxes II and III. Signal <b>box</b> <b>II</b> was destroyed in World War II in an air raid on 1 March 1945. After the war it was rebuilt and resumed operations in mid-1946. On 31 January 1965, the mechanical interlocking in signal <b>box</b> <b>II</b> {{was replaced by a}} track plan push button interlocking of Siemens class 59 (SP Dr S59), allowing 15 staff positions to be saved. In 2004, signal box III was decommissioned. As part of Neu-Ulm 21, the push button interlocking was decommissioned on 17 March 2007 and demolished shortly thereafter. As a substitute on 18 March 2007, an electronic interlocking in Ulm, built as Lorenz class L90, remotely controls the Neu-Ulm area.|$|E

40|$|The Bacillus subtilis gltAB genes, coding {{for the two}} {{subunits}} of glutamate synthase, are transcribed divergently {{from the}} gltC gene, encoding a LysR-type transcriptional activator of gltAB. The predicted gltA and gltC transcription start sites are separated by 51 to 52 bp. A 15 -bp, consensus binding site (Box I) for LysR-type proteins was found centered at position - 64 {{with respect to the}} gltA transcription start. This site was shown by mutational analysis to be required both for GltC-mediated activation of gltA and for autorepression of gltC. <b>Box</b> <b>II,</b> which is similar to Box I, is centered 22 bp downstream of Box I and overlaps the - 35 region of the gltA promoter. <b>Box</b> <b>II</b> was found to be essential for activation of gltA but not for gltC autoregulation.

40|$|The {{sequence}} {{element of}} <b>box</b> <b>II</b> (GTGTGGTTAATATG) is a regulatory {{component of a}} light-responsive element present within the upstream region of pea rbcS- 3 A. The nuclear protein GT- 1 was defined previously as a DNA binding activity that interacts with <b>box</b> <b>II.</b> Here, we describe the isolation and characterization of cDNA sequences that encode a DNA binding protein with specificity for this element. The recombinant protein, tobacco GT- 1 a, shows similar sequence requirements for DNA binding to nuclear GT- 1, as assayed by its ability to interact with previously defined 2 -bp scanning mutations of <b>box</b> <b>II,</b> and is shown to be immunologically related to nuclear GT- 1. The predicted structure of the 43 -kD protein derived from the cDNA sequence suggests {{the presence of a}} novel helix-helix-turn-helix (HHTH) motif. Comparison between the predicted protein sequence encoded by the tobacco GT- 1 a cDNA and that of another GT binding protein, rice GT- 2 reveals strong amino acid conservation over the HHTH region; this motif appears {{to be involved in the}} interaction between the recombinant protein and <b>box</b> <b>II.</b> Genomic DNA gel blot analysis indicated the presence of a small gene family of related sequences within the tobacco nuclear genome.

40|$|The phloem-specific {{promoter}} of rice tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV) is regulated {{in part by}} sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins that bind to <b>Box</b> <b>II,</b> an essential cis element. Previous studies demonstrated that the bZIP protein RF 2 a is involved in transcriptional regulation of the RTBV promoter. Here we report the identification and functional characterization of a second bZIP protein, RF 2 b. RF 2 b, identified by its interaction with RF 2 a, binds to <b>Box</b> <b>II</b> in in vitro assays as a homodimer and as RF 2 a/RF 2 b heterodimers. Like RF 2 a, RF 2 b activates the RTBV promoter in transient assays and in transgenic tobacco plants. Both RF 2 a and RF 2 b are predominantly expressed in vascular tissues. However, RF 2 a and RF 2 b have different DNA-binding affinities to <b>Box</b> <b>II,</b> show distinctive expression patterns in different rice organs, and exhibit different patterns of subcellular localization. Furthermore, transgenic rice plants with reduced levels of RF 2 b exhibit a disease-like phenotype. We propose that the regulation of phloem-specific expression of the RTBV promoter and potentially the control of RTBV replication are mainly achieved via interactions of the <b>Box</b> <b>II</b> cis element with multiple host factors, including RF 2 a and RF 2 b. We also propose that quenching/titration of these and perhaps other transcription factors by RTBV {{is involved in the}} development of the symptoms of rice tungro disease...|$|E
40|$|The {{site-specific}} recombinase IntI 1 {{found in}} class 1 integrons catalyzes the excision {{and integration of}} mobile gene cassettes, especially antibiotic resistance gene cassettes, with a site-specific recombination system. The integron integrase belongs to the tyrosine recombinase (phage integrase) family. The members of this family, exemplified by the lambda integrase, do not share extensive amino acid identities, but three invariant residues are found within two regions, designated box I and <b>box</b> <b>II.</b> Two conserved residues are arginines, one located in box I and one in <b>box</b> <b>II,</b> while the other conserved residue is a tyrosine located at the C terminus of <b>box</b> <b>II.</b> We have analyzed the properties of IntI 1 variants carrying point mutations at the three conserved residues {{of the family in}} in vivo recombination and in vitro substrate binding. We have made four proteins with mutations of the conserved box I arginine (R 146) and three mutants with changes of the <b>box</b> <b>II</b> arginine (R 280); of these, MBP-IntI 1 (R 146 K) and MBP-IntI 1 (R 280 K) bind to the attI 1 site in vitro, but only MBP-IntI 1 (R 280 K) is able to excise cassettes in vivo. However, the efficiency of recombination and DNA binding for MBP-IntI 1 (R 280 K) is lower than that obtained with the wild-type MBP-IntI 1. We have also made two proteins with mutations of the tyrosine residue (Y 312), and both mutant proteins are similar to the wild-type fusion protein in their DNA-binding capacity but are unable to catalyze in vivo recombination...|$|E

40|$|Characterization of {{regulatory}} sequences and their cognate binding {{factors in the}} bone-specific osteocalcin (OC) gene promoter has provided insight into mechanisms that control expression of the gene under diverse biological conditions. We present evidence for AP- 1 motifs and two multipartite conserved regulatory sequences, the OC Box I (nt- 99 to- 76) and a site designated OC <b>Box</b> <b>II</b> (nt- 136 to- 130) in contributing to developmental and tissue-specific expression of osteocalcin. OC Box I {{is characterized by a}} homeodomain binding site and OC <b>Box</b> <b>II</b> is a recognition sequence for AML- 1 (also called PEBP 2 alpha), a runt homology-related DNA binding protein. Functional activity of the elements was established in osseous and non-osseous cell lines and is in part related to the binding of osteoblast-specific complexes which enhance OC transcription. The contribution of several elements and binding of multiple classes of transcription factors to independent elements in both these domains serve to illustrate the complexity of control required for tissue-specific OC expression...|$|E
40|$|The genetic fine {{structure}} of cis-acting sequences previously {{shown to be}} necessary for light-regulated expression in the promoter of the parsley (Petroselinum crispum) chalcone synthase gene was analyzed. Site-directed mutations and changes in spacing between cis elements were measured in transient expression assays in parsley protoplasts. Clustered point mutations allowed assignment of functional borders. Single-base substitutions within a highly conserved cis element (box II/G box) defined a critical core of seven bases, 5 '-ACGTGGC- 3 '. It is functionally equivalent to a second sequence-related element (box III), which could replace <b>box</b> <b>II</b> in an orientation-dependent manner. The activity of <b>box</b> <b>II</b> required the presence of another juxtaposed element (box I) at a defined distance. No distance requirement was observed between the two large separable promoter regions known to independently confer light-regulated expression. These data support our hypothesis that a cis-acting sequence that is present in {{a limited number of}} diversely regulated plant genes gains its functional capacity and specificity by combinatorial diversity involving flanking partner elements...|$|E
40|$|The Gag protein {{of human}} foamy virus (HFV) lacks Cys-His boxes {{present in the}} nucleocapsid (NC) domains of other retroviruses; instead it {{contains}} three glycine-arginine-rich motifs (GR boxes). We have expressed the carboxyl end of HFV Gag containing the GR boxes (the NC domain equivalent) and analyzed its nucleic acid binding properties. Our {{results show that the}} NC domain of HFV Gag binds with high affinity to both RNA and DNA, in a sequence-independent manner, as determined by filter binding assays. Analysis of a mutant containing a heterologous sequence in place of GR box I indicates that this motif is required for nucleic acid binding and for viral replication. A mutant in GR <b>box</b> <b>II</b> still binds to RNA and DNA in vitro, but virus containing this mutation does not replicate and no nuclear staining of the Gag protein is found in transfected cells. Surprisingly, a revertant from this mutant that completely lacks GR <b>box</b> <b>II</b> and exhibits very little nuclear transport of Gag can readily replicate in tissue culture. This finding thus provides a direct evidence that although the sequences in GR <b>box</b> <b>II</b> can serve as a nuclear transport signal, they are not required for HFV replication and it is unlikely that nuclear localization of Gag protein plays any critical role during viral infection. Taken together, our results suggest that the Gag protein of HFV may be more analogous to the core protein of the hepatitis B virus family than to conventional retroviral Gag protein. All retroviral genomes contain gag, pol, and env genes tha...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A regular paving is {{a finite}} {{succession}} of bisections that partition a root box x in R d into sub-boxes using a binary tree-based data structure. The sequence of splits that generate such a partition {{is given by}} the sub-boxes associated with the nodes of the tree. The leaf boxes, i. e., the sub-boxes associated with the leaf nodes, form a partition of x. We provide algorithms to tightly enclose the range of a function g: x → R using its interval extension g. Our idea is to (i) refine the regular paving partition of the domain x by splitting the leaf <b>boxes,</b> (<b>ii)</b> obtain range enclosures of g over them, (iii) propagate the range enclosures of the leaf boxes up the internal nodes of the tree and finally (iv) prune back the leaves to get a coarser partition with fewer leaf boxes but with tighter range enclosures.
