They contain antioxidants such as falcarinol, falcarindiol, panaxydiol, and methyl-falcarindiol, which may potentially have anticancer, anti-inflammatory and antifungal properties. The dietary fiber in parsnips is partly of the soluble and partly the insoluble type and comprises cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. The high fiber content of parsnips {{may help prevent}} constipation and reduce <b>blood</b> <b>cholesterol</b> levels.|$|E
25|$|Diet has {{an effect}} on <b>blood</b> <b>{{cholesterol}},</b> but the size of this effect varies between individuals. Moreover, when dietary cholesterol intake goes down, production (principally by the liver) typically increases, so that <b>blood</b> <b>cholesterol</b> changes can be modest or even elevated. This compensatory response may explain hypercholesterolemia in anorexia. A 2016 review found tentative evidence that dietary cholesterol is associated with higher <b>blood</b> <b>cholesterol.</b> Trans fats have been shown to reduce levels of HDL while increasing levels of LDL. LDL and total cholesterol also increases by very high fructose intake.|$|E

Much work has been done to indicate the changes in <b>blood</b> plasma <b>cholesterol</b> which might be of significance in clinical diagnosis of human disease. This is referred to below in a brief review of this literature. It is notorious that human disease presents a very complex mixture of abnormal functions, and consequently it is at times extremely difficult to evaluate data derived from study of human material.

25|$|Avoiding {{trans fats}} and {{replacing}} saturated fats in adult diets with polyunsaturated fats are recommended dietary measures to reduce total <b>blood</b> <b>cholesterol</b> and LDL in adults. In people with very high cholesterol (e.g. familial hypercholesterolemia), diet {{is often not}} sufficient to achieve the desired lowering of LDL, and lipid-lowering medications are usually required. If necessary, other treatments such as LDL apheresis or even surgery (for particularly severe subtypes of familial hypercholesterolemia) are performed.

40|$|Hypocholesteremia with {{dissociation}} of {{the normal}} ratio of esterified to total cholesterol is related to chronic liver injury caused by chloroform. Hypercholesteremia may develop after prolonged biliary obstruction. The hypercholesteremia of chronic biliary obstruction may be promptly reduced below normal by chloroform poisoning or bile duct infection. Acute injury of liver due to chloroform anesthesia may cause no change in <b>blood</b> plasma <b>cholesterol.</b> Absence of bile in the intestine with faulty fat absorption does not cause the development of hypocholesteremia with dissociation of the ester ratio. Poor food consumption or short periods of fasting may cause no change in <b>blood</b> plasma <b>cholesterol.</b> Liver cells injured by chloroform may subsequently become resistant to chloroform. After prolonged biliary obstruction, the liver is apparently more sensitive to small doses of chloroform by mouth.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{estimate}} {{the efficacy of}} dietary advice to lower <b>blood</b> total <b>cholesterol</b> concentration in free-living subjects and to investigate the efficacy of different dietary recommendations. DESIGN: Systematic overview of 19 randomised controlled trials including 28 comparisons. SUBJECTS: Free-living subjects. INTERVENTIONS: Individualised dietary advice to modify fat intake. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Percentage difference in <b>blood</b> total <b>cholesterol</b> concentration between the intervention and control groups. RESULTS: The percentage reduction in <b>blood</b> total <b>cholesterol</b> attributable to dietary advice after {{at least six months}} of intervention was 5. 3 % (95 % confidence interval 4. 7 % to 5. 9 %). Including both short and long duration studies, the effect was 8. 5 % at 3 months and 5. 5 % at 12 months. Diets equivalent to the step 2 diet of the American Heart Association were of similar efficacy to diets that aimed to lower total fat intake or to raise the polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acid ratio. These diets were moderately more effective than the step 1 diet of the American Heart Association (6. 1 % v 3. 0 % reduction in <b>blood</b> total <b>cholesterol</b> concentration; P< 0. 0001). On the basis of reported food intake, the targets for dietary change were seldom achieved. The observed reductions in <b>blood</b> total <b>cholesterol</b> concentrations in the individual trials were consistent with those predicted from dietary intake {{on the basis of the}} Keys equation. CONCLUSIONS: Individualised dietary advice for reducing cholesterol concentration is modestly effective in free-living subjects. More intensive diets achieve a greater reduction in serum cholesterol concentration. Failure to comply fully with dietary recommendations is the likely explanation for this limited efficacy...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Racial {{and ethnic}} {{minorities}} are {{at increased risk}} for hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Appropriate <b>blood</b> pressure and <b>cholesterol</b> monitoring is a critical first step in identification, treatment, and control of these conditions and the prevention of coronary artery disease. This study examines <b>blood</b> pressure and <b>cholesterol</b> monitoring among non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic White subjects. Design: Data were drawn from the 1999 Massachusetts Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS) Boston oversample. Monitoring for hypertension and hypercholesterolemia were compared across 2515 respondents to the 1999 Boston BRFSS oversample, including (67. 6 % White non-Hispanic, 18 % Black non-Hispanic, and 14. 4 % Hispanic, any race). Chi square analyses were used to test unadjusted race- and ethnicity-specific differences, and logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of inadequate <b>blood</b> pressure and <b>cholesterol</b> monitoring by race/ ethnicity, adjusting for demographic characteristics, insurance, source of care, psychosocial factors, and neighborhood characteristics. Results: No significant differences were seen in the adequacy of <b>blood</b> pressure and <b>cholesterol</b> monitoring among the racial/ethnic groups of interest, despite significant differences in sociodemographic characteristics and morbidity. Conclusions: In this local dataset, non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics, as compared to non-Hispanic Whites, were not more likely to report inadequate <b>blood</b> pressure or <b>cholesterol</b> monitoring. The data suggest that safety net factors in place in Boston {{may have contributed to the}} observed parity in access to preventive care among the racial/ethnic groups of interest. The data also suggest that factors antecedent/subsequent to <b>blood</b> pressure and <b>cholesterol</b> monitoring may explain the observed disparities in <b>blood</b> pressure and <b>cholesterol</b> morbidity and control reported for racial/ethnic minorities...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Body-mass index (BMI) and {{diabetes}} have increased worldwide, whereas global average <b>blood</b> pressure and <b>cholesterol</b> have decreased or remained unchanged {{in the past}} three decades.

METHODS: We pooled data from 97 prospective cohort studies that collectively enrolled 1 Â· 8 million participants between 1948 and 2005, and that included 57, 161 coronary heart disease and 31, 093 stroke events. For each cohort we excluded participants who were younger than 18 years, had a BMI of lower than 20 kg/m(2), or who had a history of coronary heart disease or stroke. We estimated the hazard ratio (HR) of BMI on coronary heart disease and stroke with and without adjustment for all possible combinations of <b>blood</b> pressure, <b>cholesterol,</b> and glucose.

25|$|LDL {{particles}} {{are the major}} <b>blood</b> <b>cholesterol</b> carriers. Each one contains approximately 1,500 molecules of cholesterol ester. LDL molecule shells contain just one molecule of apolipoprotein B100, recognized by LDL receptors in peripheral tissues. Upon binding of apolipoprotein B100, many LDL receptors concentrate in clathrin-coated pits. Both LDL and its receptor form vesicles within a cell via endocytosis. These vesicles then fuse with a lysosome, where the lysosomal acid lipase enzyme hydrolyzes the cholesterol esters. The cholesterol can then be used for membrane biosynthesis or esterified and stored within the cell, so as to {{not interfere with the}} cell membranes.|$|E

The basic underlying cause may be the insulin resistance that precedes type 2 diabetes, which is a diminished capacity for insulin response in some tissues (e.g., muscle, fat).
