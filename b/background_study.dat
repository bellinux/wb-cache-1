40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed at}} <b>studying</b> the thesisÂ’ <b>background</b> of <b>study</b> written by English department students of University of Muhammadiyah Malang (UMM). This {{study was conducted}} to find out whether the <b>backgrounds</b> of <b>study</b> written by English department students of UMM meet suggested criteria or not. This research was {{based on the fact that}} writing a text or <b>background</b> of <b>study</b> in this case is complex and difficult. It needs skills and knowledge to make a <b>background</b> of <b>study</b> effective. This study focused on two major things, namely: the components of <b>background</b> of <b>study</b> and the writing organization. Component of <b>background</b> of <b>study</b> is a list of things that should be written in <b>background</b> of <b>study.</b> It includes the explanation of theories related to the research, previous research, the explanation of the recent fact related to the research, the explanation of why the statements of problem occurred, the explanation about the problemÂ’s implicationÂ¸ and the statement of why the study should be done. However, the writing organization will determine the arrangement of component in <b>background</b> of <b>study.</b> This study used descriptive qualitative research design. The writer described and interpreted the phenomena that existed in English Department of University of Muhammadiyah Malang regarding to writing thesisÂ’ <b>background</b> of <b>study.</b> The object of this <b>study</b> was thesisÂ’ <b>background</b> of <b>study</b> written by English department students of UMM. The data were taken from year 2010 and 2011 randomly. The writer took 10 (ten) data from year 2010, and 5 (five) from year 2011. After analyzing all objects of the study, the writer found out that not all of the components of <b>backgrounds</b> of <b>study</b> are used by English department students of UMM in writing thesisÂ’ background of study; just some of the thesis writers used all the components in writing <b>background</b> of <b>study</b> completely. Among 15 samples of <b>background</b> of <b>study</b> as the objects, just 4 (four) of them used all components above. The rest only used some of the components. Besides, In terms of writing organization, overall the thesisÂ’ <b>background</b> of <b>study</b> written by English department students of UMM is not well organized. In writing the <b>background</b> of <b>study,</b> there are certain weaknesses made by the writers in terms of the unity and coherence in each paragraph, and the transitions between paragraphs...|$|R

2500|$|When {{the various}} modern {{language}} departments were introduced into American {{universities in the}} 1880s, speakers at {{the first meeting of}} the Modern Language Association in 1883 had been concerned to counter the popular perception that “English literature is a subject for the desultory reader in his leisure hours rather than an intellectual study for serious workers", a mere [...] "accomplishment", whereas when “a boy studies Greek you know he has worked hard”. Philology [...] "met the desire for facts, for accuracy, and for the imitation of the scientific method which had acquired such an overwhelming prestige" [...] in the United States. It had yielded the discoveries of the Grimms and others, tracing the step-by-step relationships of classical and modern European to ancient Indian languages and their evolutionary development. A former Harvard graduate student James H. Hanford, reminisced how under Kittredge, Students were expected to talk in a scholarly way in the classroom and on a final examination about Grimm’s or Verner's laws, the differentiating characteristics of Anglo-Saxon among the Teutonic languages, the changes in English phonology, inflection, and syntax from Anglo-Saxon times to the sixteenth century, the influence of Danish, French and Latin on the English language in its various periods. But these phases of language development were closely associated with the entire cultural history of which they were a part. The philologist is the person who makes his approach to the past through the phenomenon of language. “In the beginning was the word”.The objective was the equipment of a man of real erudition, about whose professional and scientific status there should be no doubt and who could hold up his head in pride among his fellows in the older and more reputable field of classics[...] [...] [...] Source and <b>background</b> <b>study,</b> so decried by [...] critics of the philological regime, was conceived of both as a means of interpretation and as an independent contribution to cultural history.|$|E

50|$|In {{keeping with}} PEN's longstanding Writers at Risk program, its newly founded Artists at Risk Connection (ARC) extends this support to artists of all definitions, {{encompassing}} writers, cartoonists, visual artists, filmmakers, musicians, and performance artists, {{as well as}} other individuals who produce significant creative output. Under the belief that artists {{play a critical role in}} society, the ARC—with funding from the Andrew W.

The program is designed in response to a <b>background</b> <b>study</b> conducted by PEN America in 2015 to explore possible ways to enhance support for individual artists at risk.

5000|$|The {{first stage}} is preparatory {{for both the}} APR Secretariat and the {{national}} authorities. The country in question has to answer a detailed questionnaire, {{on the basis of}} which a self-assessment is completed. The APRM Secretariat for its part will make a <b>background</b> <b>study</b> of the country's governance and development. After this has been shared with the country concerned and other partner institutions and after the self-assessment has been made, the country in question will issue a draft Programme of Action [...] In the development of this Programme that participation of all stakeholders must be ensured, ‘including trade unions, women, youth, civil society, private sector, rural communities and professional associations’ [...] In the Programme it will suggest a time-bound framework for implementing the Declaration on Democracy, Political, Economic and Corporate Governance. After the Programme of Action and questionnaire have been submitted to the APR Secretariat, the Secretariat will draw up an Issues Paper. It is possible that {{on the basis of this}} paper the Secretariat will decide that certain issues need a more in-depth assessment (‘Technical assessments’) before that stage two is initiated. If there are Technical Assessments, these can lead to the update of the Issues Paper and possibly the Programme of Action [...] The APRM Secretariat also makes a suggestion to the APR Panel regarding the composition of the Country Review team.|$|E
