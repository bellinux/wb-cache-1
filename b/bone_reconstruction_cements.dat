40|$|The <b>reconstruction</b> of <b>bone</b> defects {{remains a}} chal-lenge in {{orthopaedic}} oncology. Allogenic and autolo-gous bone grafts, {{as well as}} megaprostheses are well-recognised methods for <b>bone</b> <b>reconstruction.</b> Modular, both <b>cemented</b> and cementless, endopros-thetic systems have become more popular to bridge defects of different sizes. The clinical and radiological results of 50 consecutive patients treated with MUTARS ® endoprostheses between 1995 and 2000 were evaluated in a prospec-tive clinical study. The average follow-up was 46 months (25 - 86 months). Clinical evaluation showed good results with an average Enneking-Score of 72 % (33 - 100 %, SD ± 19). Radiological evaluation showed various patterns of bone remodelling includ-ing extracortical bone bridging. Early symptomatic loosening occurred in 11 cases, necessitating revision surgery.

Methods: Medical records of patients who underwent surgery for chronic otitis media between March 2000 and December 2002 were evaluated retrospectively. Fifty-seven patients who underwent bone cement ossiculoplasty and had appropriate follow-up data {{were included in the}} study. <b>Bone</b> <b>cement</b> <b>reconstruction</b> of the ossicular chain was performed 1) from incus to stapes (I-S) in the absence of long arm or lenticular process of the incus and 2) from malleus to stapes (M-S) {{in the absence of the}} incus. The clinical data of the patients were evaluated by otoscopic examination and audiometry. Results: The graft take rate was 84. 1 %. I-S procedure was performed in 42 and M-S in 8 patients. Pre- and postoperative PTAs of all patients were compared, which showed a significant improvement in air PTA (p, 0. 001) while bone PTA did not change (p. 0. 05). In I-S and M-S groups, successful hearing restoration could be achieved in 78. 6. 1 % and 87. 5 % of the patients, respectively. Hearing results of different aural pathol-ogies (chronic otitis media and conductive hearing loss) and surgeries (tympanotomy and tympanoplasty with or without mas-toidectomy) were not significantly different (p. 0. 05).

30|$|There {{are limited}} {{therapeutic}} options for <b>reconstruction</b> of <b>bone</b> damaged by irradiation due to fibrosis, cell necrosis, and severe impairment of vascular supply. Non-vascularized free bone grafts are less {{effective in the}} irradiated field; therefore, their use is discouraged [8, 9]. Microvascular free tissue transfer has thus been considered {{the gold standard for}} <b>bone</b> <b>reconstruction</b> in the field of irradiation, as it overcomes the limitations of non-vascularized grafts [10 – 12]. However, the disadvantages of microvascular free tissue transfer include donor site morbidity and prolonged duration of surgery and hospitalization time. Additionally, ischemia in recipient site and radiation-induced perivascular thrombosis can decrease the success rate of <b>bone</b> <b>reconstruction</b> following the microvascular free flap technique [13, 14]. Therefore, further investigation of <b>bone</b> <b>reconstruction</b> strategy in irradiated area must be performed.

This study was undertaken to identify the prognostic factors for oncological {{and functional}} outcomes and the significance of adjuvant radiotherapy in achieving local control in patients with foot sarcomas. We reviewed 31 consecutive patients with soft tissue (24), and bone (7) sarcomas arising in the foot and analyzed the impact of patient characteristics on the functional and oncological outcomes. There were seven cases with clear cell or epithelioid sarcomas. Two of the 31 cases experienced local recurrence despite the fact that only two cases received adjuvant radiotherapy. Sixteen out of 18 cases of soft tissue sarcomas with limb salvage surgery underwent reconstructive procedures for soft tissue defects. Amputation required as a surgical treatment (p= 0. 002) was a poor prognostic factor. Larger size (p= 0. 029) and <b>bone</b> <b>reconstruction</b> (p= 0. 018) were poor prognostic factors for local recurrence-free survival, and amputation (p= 0. 001) and <b>bone</b> <b>reconstruction</b> (p= 0. 008) for metastasis-free survival in patients with soft tissue sarcomas. No significant factors were derived in patients with bone sarcomas.

40|$|Mandibular osteoradionecrosis is {{a severe}} {{side effect of}} {{radiotherapy}} after the treatment of squamous cell carcinomas of the upper aerodigestive tract. As an alternative to its treatment by micro-anastomosed free-flaps, preclinical tissular engineering studies have been developed. Total bone marrow (TBM) associated with biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) significantly enhanced bone formation in irradiated bone. One mechanism, explaining how bone marrow cells can help regenerate tissues like this, is the paracrine effect. The bone marrow cell extract (BMCE) makes use of this paracrine mechanism by keeping only the soluble factors such as growth factors and cytokines. It has provided significant results in repairing various tissues, but {{has not yet been}} studied in irradiated <b>bone</b> <b>reconstruction.</b> The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of BMCE via an intraosseous or intravenous delivery, with a calcium phosphate scaffold, in irradiated <b>bone</b> <b>reconstruction.</b> Twenty rats were irradiated on their hind limbs with a single 80 -Gy dose. Three weeks later, surgery was performed to create osseous defects. The intraosseous group (n = 12) studied the effect of BMCE in situ, with six combinations (empty defect, BCP, TBM, BCP-TBM, lysate only, BCP-lysate). After four different combinations of implantation (empty defect, BCP, TBM, BCP-TBM), the intravenous group (n = 8) received four intravenous injections of BMCE for 2 weeks. Five weeks after implantation, samples were explanted for histological and scanning electron microscopy analysis. Lysate immunogenicity was studied with various mixed lymphocyte reactions. Intravenous injections of BMCE led to a significant new bone formation compared to the intraosseous group. The BCP-TBM mixture remained the most effective in the intraosseous group. However, intravenous injections were more effective, with TBM placed in the defect, with or without biomaterials. Histologically, highly cellularized bone marrow was observed in the defects after intravenous injections, and not after an in situ use of the lysate. The mixed lymphocyte reactions did not show any proliferation after 3, 5, or 7 days of lysate incubation with lymphocytes from another species. This study evaluated the role of BMCE in irradiated <b>bone</b> <b>reconstruction.</b> There were significant results arguing in favor of BMCE intravenous injections.

40|$|SummaryIntroductionFemoral stem {{revision}} with {{a locked}} stem after total hip arthroplasties treats severe bone defects by favoring spontaneous <b>bone</b> <b>reconstruction.</b> Initially, once reconstruction was obtained, the temporary implant {{was to be}} replaced by a standard primary component. The use of locked stems has increased, but repeat revision with a short stem which is also called “de-escalation” has not been extensively studied. HypothesisRepeat revision of a locked stem with a short stem is not associated with any specific morbidity and does not affect the quality of reconstruction obtained, or fixation of the subsequent standard length primary design stem. Patients and methodsFifteen patients whose locked femoral stem was exchanged due to thigh pain and/or radiographic images showing failed osteointegration were analyzed. These 15 patients were all followed-up and evaluated by the Postel Merle d’Aubigné score. Progression of bone defects was evaluated using the Hofmann cortical index. ResultsThere were no difficulties extracting the locked stem and a standard length primary stem was inserted with no associated procedures or bone complications in any of the cases. At a mean follow-up of 55 months (36 – 84 months), thigh pain had disappeared and the Postel Merle d’Aubigné score had increased from 12. 6 ± 2. 9 (7 – 16) to 16. 5 ± 0. 9 (15 – 18) (P= 0. 0001). The use of a locked femoral stem resulted in <b>bone</b> <b>reconstruction</b> in all cases, the Hofmann index increased from 30. 5 %± 17. 9 % (12 – 71 %) before insertion of the locked stem to 43. 6 %± 25. 6 % (19 – 90 %) at exchange (P< 0. 05). <b>Bone</b> <b>reconstruction</b> was durable after the exchange with a stable Hofmann index 43. 7 %± 26. 2 % (17 – 92 %) at the final follow-up (P= 0. 9).

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{number of}} {{publications}} {{have reported that}} adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs) {{have the capacity to}} be induced to differentiate into osteoblasts both in vitro and in vivo. However, it has been difficult to use separate ADSCs for cortical bone regeneration and <b>bone</b> <b>reconstruction</b> so far. Inspired by the research around stromal stem cells and cell sheets, we developed a new method to fabricate ADSCs sheets to accelerate and enhance the bone regeneration and <b>bone</b> <b>reconstruction.</b> PURPOSE: To fabricate ADSCs sheets and evaluate their capacity to be induced to differentiate to osteoblasts in vitro. METHODS: Human adipose derived stem cells (hADSCs) were employed in this research. The fabricating medium containing 50 µM ascorbate- 2 -phosphate was used to enhance the secretion of collagen protein by the ADSCs and thus to make the cell sheets of ADSCs. As the separate ADSCs were divided into osteo-induction group and control group, the ADSCs sheets were also divided into two groups depending on induction by osteogenesis medium or no induction. The osteogenic capacity of each group was evaluated by ALP staining, Alizarin Red staining and ALP activity. RESULTS: The ADSCs sheets were fabricated after one-week culture in the fabricating medium. The ALP staining of ADSCs sheets showed positive results after 5 days osteo-induction and the Alizarin Red staining of ADSCs sheets showed positive results after 1 week osteo-induction. The ALP activity showed significant differences between these four groups. The ALP activity of ADSCs sheets groups showed higher value than that of separate ADSCs. CONCLUSION: The experiments demonstrated that ADSCs sheets have better capacity than separate ADSCs to be induced to differentiate into osteoblasts. This indicates {{that it is possible to}} use the ADSCs sheets as a source of mesenchymal stem cells for bone regeneration and <b>bone</b> <b>reconstruction...</b>|$|R
