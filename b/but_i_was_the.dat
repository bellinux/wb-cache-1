500|$|The Workmans' {{exploration}} of the Rose Glacier and the 45-mile-long (72km) Siachen Glacier in Baltistan around Masherbrum in 1911 and 1912 {{was the most important}} achievement of their careers because it was the widest and longest subpolar glacier in the world and at the time, the least explored and accessible glacier as well. For two months, the Workmans explored the 45-mile glacier, climbed several mountains, and mapped the area. They spent the entire time over , [...] the high point being Indira Col, which they summitted and named. On this expedition, one of their Italian guides fell into a crevasse and died; Fanny was lucky to escape. The others were badly shaken but decided to carry on. Fanny led them across the Sia La pass (...) near the head of the Siachen Glacier and through a previously unexplored region to the Kaberi Glacier. This exploration and the resulting book were among her greatest accomplishments. As she wrote in her book about the trip, Two Summers in the Ice-Wilds of Eastern Karakoram, she organized and led this expedition: [...] "Dr. Hunter Workman accompanied me, this time, in charge with me of commissariat and as photographer and glacialist, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> responsible leader of this expedition, and on my efforts, in a large measure, must depend {{the success or failure of}} it". At one 21,000-foot (6,400 m) plateau, Fanny unfurled a [...] "Votes for Women" [...] newspaper and her husband snapped an iconic picture. [...] They took trained Alpine guides and surveyors including Grant Peterkin and Surjan Singh, whose contributions ensured that, unlike numerous other maps the Workmans helped create, their map of the Siachen Glacier remained unchallenged for many years.|$|E

2500|$|Habib {{was raised}} in a female environment, his {{brothers}} being in Tunis and his father being old. Therefore, he spent his days with his mother, grandmother and sisters, Aïsha and Nejia, which permitted him to witness the household chores of women and the gender inequality with men. Bourguiba recounted his childhood in these words: [...] "I was the youngest of all. As such, I was responsible for all chores. I was, in short, a domestic. I was responsible for keeping the jug and pour water on the hands of my elders, after meals. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> elder of nobody, and I had to manage all by own with the hudge container in order to wash my hands". Another fact also marked the childhood of Habib Bourguiba: Being the youngest of the family, he had to address his elders, including his brothers with the word [...] "Sidi" [...] (ser). However, the designation of his sisters was a problem of protocol. Even though they were older, their female gender did not give them a right of presence on young Habib. His father Ali, soon found {{a solution to the problem}} arguing that they had to call themselves with their respective first name, [...] "no other difference hallmark". The young Habib soon noticed the low status of women in the beginning of the century.|$|E
