We consider both a linear wave and a weak shock and analyse their <b>behaviour</b> <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> and warm plasmas.

We calculate the wave amplitude, using the ray approximation {{and the laws of}} solitary shock wave damping. We find that a complex caustic is formed around the null point.

After {{an introduction to}} explain why the dimuon measurements are a useful tool to investigate the formation of a deconﬁned medium and how these measurements can be performed, from an experimental point of view, a review of the status of the ﬁeld is presented, with particular emphasis on the NA 60 results. The NA 60 experimental apparatus, in fact, allows to perform high precision measurements, and therefore to obtain high quality results. Concerning the so called “low mass region” (0. 2 2. 9 GeV) is dominated by the J/ψ whose suppression is usually considered one of the main signatures for the formation of a deconﬁned medium. However also cold nuclear matter eﬀects, not related to the hot matter, may reduce the J/ψ yield. Therefore, the study of p-A collisions allows the determination of the J/ψ <b>behaviour</b> <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> nuclear matter, representing the reference with respect to which the J/ψ yield in A-A collisions must be compared. NA 60 results show that indeed an “anomalous suppression” is present in central In-In collisions. However, it is clear that to correctly quantify the amount of suppression exceeding the one due to cold nuclear matter, a precise determination of this reference must be performed.

To fill this knowledge gap, detailed shallow soil {{moisture and}} thaw depth surveys were conducted along systematic grids from April to July of 2008 at the Baker Creek Basin, Northwest Territories. Multiple hillslopes were studied to determine how the interactions differed along a spectrum of topological, typological and topographic situations across the landscape. Overall results did not show a simple link between soil moisture and ground thaw as was expected. Instead, correlation was a function of wetness. The drier the site was, the more random the interaction between soil moisture and ground thaw.

40|$|Najas marina is {{a summer}} annual of shallow lakes that reaches its {{distributional}} limit in the Norfolk Broads of eastern England. Seeds are shed in autumn and overwinter in lake sediments. We investigated {{the influence of}} growing-season length on seed maturity and germinability and the cumulative effects of winter temperatures on patterns of germinability. Seeds were stratified for up to 1 year and tested for germinability at 4 -week intervals. Data-loggers recorded temperatures simultaneously at the field site and in the cold room. Cumulative temperature below a threshold (thermal time) was used to relate <b>behaviour</b> <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> storage to phenology. Most seeds were dormant at collection. Cold storage of imbibed seed resulted in loss of dormancy. The proportion of non-dormant seeds peaked after a cold treatment equivalent to one winter, i. e. coinciding with favourable temperatures for germination in the field. Continued cold stratification resulted in a cycle of secondary dormancy and its subsequent relief; the thermal time characterizing the second, lower, peak in germinability coincided approximately with that attained {{in the field in}} the second spring after collection. Shortening the growing season of Najas marina, by collecting material before natural senescence was complete, reduced the proportion of mature seeds, lowered average germinability and increased germination times. The thermal capacity of water bodies causes a lag in spring warming, whereas declining light becomes limiting in autumn. Najas marina is crucially dependent on the length of growing season to produce sufficient viable seed. A low-temperature requirement to break seed dormancy prevents inappropriate autumn germination. In a prolonged winter (necessarily followed by a shorter growing season), a significant proportion of seed would go into secondary dormancy and remain in the seed bank until the second spring. In annual plants, such requirements for warm summers and cold winters could contribute to a continental-climate distribution in northern Europe. In the case of Najas marina this might explain its limit at the eastern extremity of England and thus its rarity...|$|E
40|$|Cold gas dynamic {{spraying}} (CDGS) is {{a material}} deposition technique, in which powder particles are accelerated to speeds of between 300 - 1200 m/s and upon impact deform plastically and adhere. The overall aims {{of this research}} project were to understand the bonding <b>behaviour</b> <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> spraying of copper, aluminium and titanium, and to produce corrosion resistance barrier layer of titanium coatings using cold spraying. The mechanism of bonding in cold spraying is still {{a matter of some}} debate. In this thesis, copper has been cold sprayed onto aluminium alloy substrates, the surfaces of which had been prepared in a variety of ways. The coating - substrate bonding was assessed via a novel intermetallic growth method along with adhesive pull-off testing. The bond strength has been rationalised in terms of a modified composite strength model, with two operative bonding mechanisms, namely (i) metallurgical bonding and (ii) mechanical interlocking of substrate material into the coating. In most cases, mechanical interlocking is able to account for {{a large proportion of the}} total bond strength, with metallurgical bonding only contributing significantly when the substrate had been polished and annealed prior to spraying. In addition, grit-blasting has been shown to significantly reduce the bond strength compared to other substrate preparation methods. Aluminium has also been cold sprayed onto copper substrates, the mechanical interlocking of substrate material was not observed and the bond strength was relatively low. Titanium particles have been deposited onto three different steel substrates, namely low carbon steel, an Armco iron, and an austenitic stainless steel. Using the novel intermetallic growth method it was found that a barrier does exist at the interface of the titanium deposited onto the low carbon steel and Armco iron substrates which is not removed in either of the stages of impact or during the heat treatment process. On the other hand, in the case of titanium deposited onto the austenitic stainless steel, the barrier is removed. Cold spraying is believed to have the potential for the deposition of corrosion resistant barrier coatings. However, to be effective, a barrier coating must not have interconnected porosity. Titanium coatings were sprayed using nitrogen as an accelerant gas at two process gas temperatures of 600 and 800 ˚C to reduce porosity. A modified in-situ grit blasting was used to improve the coating-substrate adhesion. The mean bond strength of the titanium deposits was ~ 70 MPa and tensile strength was 250 MPa. Mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) was used to characterize the interconnected porosity over a size range of micrometers to nanometers. The MIP results showed that in cold sprayed deposits a significant proportion of the porosity was sub-micron and so could not be reliably measured by optical microscope based image analysis. A set of free standing deposits was also vacuum heat treated to further decrease porosity levels. The effect of porosity on the corrosion behaviour of titanium coatings onto carbon steels was investigated in 3. 5 wt. % NaCl. The electrochemical measurements of the coatings showed significant substrate influence when the interconnected porosity of the coating was 11. 3 vol. % but a decreased substrate influence with a porosity level of 5. 9 vol. %. Salt spray (fog) tests confirmed these electrochemical findings and showed the formation of corrosion products following 24 -h exposure. Laser surface melting (LSM) was used to seal the top ~ 140 μm of the coating to eliminate any interconnected porosity. The LSM titanium coatings showed no sign of corrosion after 100 -h of salt spray tests, and the open circuit potential and passive current density values were similar to those of the bulk titanium.
