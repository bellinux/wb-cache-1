40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the possibility of}} using water based <b>fluid</b> as a <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> for light loads. Characterization of both standard and water based <b>braked</b> <b>fluids</b> formulated was carried out. The properties of the latter were compared with that of a standard commercial <b>brake</b> <b>fluid.</b> The actual test of the formulated <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> was carried out with a Nissan Sunny vehicle model 1. 5 within the speed range of 20 km/hr to 80 km/hr at the permanent campus of University of Uyo and the braking efficiency obtained attest to its suitability for light loads...|$|R

5000|$|In December 2010, certain 2005-2007 model Acura RLs {{were subject}} to a safety recall for {{potential}} leaking of the brake master cylinder seal. [...] A seal in the brake master cylinder may be susceptible to damage following the use of <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> other than the recommended Acura or (Honda) Genuine DOT3 <b>brake</b> <b>fluid.</b> If the seal is damaged, it {{can result in a}} <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> leak under certain conditions. If a leak should occur, the driver might see a low <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> indicator light or a <b>BRAKE</b> <b>FLUID</b> LOW or CHECK BRAKE SYSTEM message. If the driver continues to drive the vehicle after receiving this message without refilling the <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> reservoir, it could result in a brake pedal that feels soft or spongy, and may eventually affect braking performance, increasing the risk of a crash. Affected vehicles were to be inspected and repaired, as applicable, at no charge. Reportedly, this recall applied to both 2005-2007 Acura RL and 2005-2007 Honda Odyssey models.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike {{polyethylene}} glycol based fluids, Dot 5 is hydrophobic. An advantage over {{other forms of}} <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> is that silicone has a more stable viscosity index over a wider temperature range. Another property {{is that it does}} not damage paint. [...] DOT 5 <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> is not compatible with anti-lock brake systems. DOT 5 <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> absorbs a small amount of air requiring care when bleeding the system of air.|$|R
50|$|The {{hydraulic}} {{braking system}} is designed as a closed system: {{unless there is a}} leak in the system, none of the <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> enters or leaves it, nor does the fluid get consumed through use. Leakage may happen, however, from cracks in the O-rings or from a puncture in the brake line. Cracks can form if two types of <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> are mixed or if the <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> becomes contaminated with water, alcohol, antifreeze, or any number of other liquids.|$|R

5000|$|Excessive {{brake drum}} heating {{can cause the}} <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> to vaporize, which reduces the {{hydraulic}} pressure applied to the brake shoes. Therefore, the brakes provide less deceleration for a given amount {{of pressure on the}} pedal. The effect is worsened by poor maintenance. <b>Brake</b> <b>fluid</b> that is old and has absorbed moisture has a lower boiling point, so brake fade occurs sooner.|$|R

40|$|Abstract‘Turbo Braking Assists’ (TBA) {{employs the}} {{principles}} of turbo machinery and automotive engineering {{in order to achieve}} effective braking assistance for the modern day disc as well as drum brakes. These brakes are intended for the purpose of braking assists during high speed motion. The major components include a turbine or rotor, pump, nozzle, enlarged <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> chamber, DOT 5. 1 <b>braking</b> <b>fluid.</b> The functioning involves directing a jet of high velocity <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> (DOT 5. 1 in this case) at the blades of the rotor which is coupled with the wheel. The braking circuit is used as such with the enlargement of the <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> chamber. A pump is added to the set up to enable increase of mass flow rate of fluid and also to ensure the continuity of fluid flow in the entire circuit. A speed sensor is integrated along with the circuit to activate the pump such that the braking assists are put to use only after a particular velocity is reached as braking assists are not necessary at lower speed...|$|R

5000|$|A small drop in <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> {{level in}} the master {{cylinder}} reservoir can be [...] "topped up" [...] but if the level consistently drops, the cause should be investigated and repaired. <b>Brake</b> <b>fluid</b> {{level in the}} master cylinder will drop as the linings (pads or shoes) wear and the calipers or wheel cylinders extend further to compensate. Overspill from pushing back pistons should be avoided, because glycol based fluid will quickly lift or strip paints and other coatings on contact (it can be removed by quickly washing with water, not wiping). <b>Brake</b> <b>fluid</b> level may also be low because of a leak, which {{could result in a}} loss of hydraulic pressure and consequently a significant loss of braking ability. Modern cars have redundant hydraulic circuits (two separate circuits) to ensure against total hydraulic failure.|$|R

5000|$|In a {{hydraulic}} brake system, the driver applies force by a mechanical link from the {{pedal to the}} master brake cylinder. In turn the master brake cylinder develops hydraulic pressure in the wheels. In contrast, the electro-hydraulic brake SBC provides the brakes with a <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> supply from the hydraulic high-pressure reservoir, which is sufficient for several braking events. A piston pump driven by an electric motor supplies a controlled <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> pressure between 140 and 160 Bar in the gas diaphragm reservoir.|$|R

50|$|Brake {{bleeding}} is {{the procedure}} performed on hydraulic brake systems whereby the brake lines (the {{pipes and hoses}} containing the <b>brake</b> <b>fluid)</b> are purged of any air bubbles. This is necessary because, while the <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> is an incompressible liquid, air bubbles are compressible gas and {{their presence in the}} brake system greatly reduces the hydraulic pressure that can be developed within the system. The same methods used for bleeding are also used for purging, where the old fluid is replaced with new fluid, which is necessary maintenance.|$|R
