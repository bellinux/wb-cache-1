50|$|Isolated in {{a central}} terrain, the simple sports {{pavilion}} consists of a single large nave, for social and sporting events, with annexes for storage, washrooms and change rooms, stage and projection booth. There are five exits through <b>bi-fold</b> <b>doors,</b> with one in the changing area.|$|R
50|$|Brick stairs {{lead up to}} the {{recessed}} entrance. The lawn is {{ramped up}} to the <b>bi-fold</b> <b>doors</b> of the living room. At {{the rear of the}} house a raised semi-enclosed, covered patio area opens onto an informal garden area. The garden is enclosed with pool fencing.|$|R
25|$|Entry {{into the}} cockpit and {{passenger}} cabin were from the upper surface of the wing center section. Access was through <b>bi-fold</b> <b>doors</b> latched at the bottom. Both doors were equipped with a center hinge allowing the doors, when opened, to lay folded onto the upper surface of the fuselage.|$|R
50|$|Beginning with 2011, the Prevost X3-45 is {{available}} in a transit configuration, with <b>bi-fold</b> <b>doors</b> instead of a sedan-type door. The New York City Transit Authority is the launch customer for this configuration. Previously, 20 transit-style buses in the LeMirage predecessor model had been built for GO Transit in the late 1990s.|$|R

50|$|Optional Component Scheme (OCS) - More {{flexibility}} and choices to have floor finishes and internal timber doors installed. The opt-in basic cost are usually about 20~30% cheaper due to bulk purchases and less labour charges. But {{those who want}} variety of timber or <b>bi-fold</b> <b>doors</b> design, and better homogeneous/porcelain tiles or tiles/timber skirting can {{opt out of the}} schemes.|$|R
50|$|The first {{purpose-built}} ambulance {{building for}} Queensland {{was constructed in}} 1897 in Wharf Street, Brisbane. This building established the precedent for subsequent ambulance station designs. The design incorporated a two-storeyed building housing plant and staff facilities at ground level and a residence on the upper level. Large ground floor openings with <b>bi-fold</b> <b>doors</b> allowed ready access directly to the street for quick exit of horse and sulky.|$|R
50|$|The {{conversion}} {{was enacted}} by Grizzly Engineering of Swan Hill during 1996. The modifications included {{the removal of}} the fixed side louvre panels and doors, the fitting of two internal bulkheads, 3 pairs of external <b>bi-folding</b> <b>doors</b> and repainting into V/Line Freight colours. VFBX 1 saw very little use, and by August 2000 the body had been removed and the underframe converted to flat-wagon VFTX 28.|$|R
25|$|Doors: The doors themselves, at first, were {{essentially}} the same. However, Muni's cars had moveable steps, {{which could be}} lowered for street-level boarding or raised for boarding from high-level platforms, {{such as those in}} the subway. The Boston cars did not have this feature and so must be boarded from street-level. These doors proved troublesome and the MBTA eventually replaced them with <b>bi-folding</b> <b>doors,</b> further distinguishing them from Muni's.|$|R
50|$|In 1996, louvre wagon VLEX949 was {{modified}} in Swan Hill by Grizzly Engineering. The sides were removed and two internal bulkheads were added, with the now three compartments made accessible with {{three pairs of}} external <b>bi-folding</b> <b>doors.</b> The new wagon, VBFX1, was painted into V/Line Freight colours. The new van was not used regularly, and by August 2000 the body had been removed and the underframe converted to flat wagon VFTX 28.|$|R
50|$|Internally, {{inside the}} {{entrance}} {{there is a}} centrally placed 3-sided ticket booth. To the south side is a store room, and to the north a staircase {{to the first floor}} bio-box. The auditorium is accessed through 2 pairs of <b>bi-fold</b> <b>doors</b> either side of the ticket booth. There are also 3 single doors in the western wall providing access to the ticket box, a store room and the staircase. The bio-box window has been in-filled.|$|R
2500|$|The LRVs came {{equipped}} with overly complex [...] "plug doors," [...] which were originally {{intended for the}} high-platform operation in the Muni Metro subway. These doors would frequently short circuit and caused a significant nuisance for the MBTA. The transit agency later attempted to correct the issues with the plug doors by adding a wider rubber strip and eliminating the recycling circuit, but the issue was not fully resolved until the mid-1990s, when MBTA retrofitted all Boeings with much more reliable <b>bi-fold</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|R
50|$|To its east is {{the chicken}} house, a two-story frame {{building}} on stone foundation with novelty siding and metal roof. Its north end {{is a large}} roost area with windows facing downhill; the second floor has a loft door. The garage, east the barn along the driveway, is a concrete block structure faced in imitation stonework and topped with a metal hipped roof. It has two <b>bi-fold</b> <b>doors</b> with upper glass panels facing the driveway {{and a pair of}} windows on each end.|$|R

50|$|With a 150 mm higher floor level, the 1901 {{extension}} comprises {{two large}} rooms (7 x 4.2 m each) {{connected by a}} large opening with fanlights above. Cedar <b>bi-fold</b> <b>doors</b> which originally graced this opening have been removed to The World Theatre (the former Australian Bank of Commerce) in Mosman Street. Access to the front room is from the public space of the 1887 structure, and to the rear room from the rear yard and through a short transverse corridor within the former board room.|$|R
50|$|In the {{south-west}} wing, {{the lounge}} opens off the entrance foyer through veneer doors that match the wall panelling and {{is separated from}} the dining room in the western corner by leadlight <b>bi-fold</b> <b>doors.</b> The lounge has an open fireplace and both lounge and dining rooms have polished timber floors and decorative plaster cornice and ceilings. Both the lounge and dining rooms have eight light doors that open onto external and internal verandahs. Adjoining the dining room area is a private dining room and the hotel kitchen which form the north-west wing.|$|R
50|$|Near {{the end of}} the {{production}} of hauled Mark 1 stock came a series of eight experimental carriages known as the XP64 set. Three Corridor Firsts, two Corridor Seconds, and three Tourist Second Opens were built by Derby Carriage Works in 1964. Externally they resembled Mark 1 stock {{with the addition of a}} cosmetic cover over the solebars of the standard Mark 1 underframes, but inside they included many new features, including pressure ventilation, new seating designs and wider <b>bi-fold</b> <b>doors.</b> Many of these features were later incorporated in the Mark 2 stock produced from 1964.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to using perforated metal screens as a façade system, Ban designed the glass façade behind {{them as a}} curtain wall system. The curtain wall incorporates glass <b>bi-fold</b> <b>doors,</b> supporting Ban’s design to open each apartment to the surrounding city context. [...] The windows of the curtain wall do not contain metal panes, as is typical {{for this type of}} system; but rather they incorporate double-glazed sashes and a hinge in the center. This assembly is controlled by a motorized component which forces the glass doors to open {{in a manner similar to}} that of a garage door.|$|R
25|$|A {{bifold door}} is {{a unit that}} has several sections, folding in pairs. Wood {{is the most common}} material, and doors may also be metal or glass. Bifolds are most {{commonly}} made for closets, but may also be used as units between rooms. <b>Bi-fold</b> <b>doors</b> are essentially now doors that let the outside in. They open in concert; where the panels fold up against one another and are pushed together when opened. The main door panel (often known as the traffic door) is accompanied by a stack of panels that fold very neatly against one another when opened fully, which almost look like room dividers.|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of 2004 Disability Act {{has meant that}} all public spaces must provide a comparable experience for all users. These patents resulted from a user-centred research project focusing {{on how to improve}} access to disabled toilets, particularly in hospital situations. Through observational and ethnographic research the study identified a series of issues relating to the loading of <b>bi-folding</b> <b>door</b> systems. My expertise in developing patentable user-centred design solutions resulted {{in the development of a}} new and unique retractable pivot and loading block system. These innovations were identified through observational research and user testing. The loading block’s uniqueness is in its ability to enable the user to guide the retractable pivot into location. The retractable pivot eliminates the need to lift the door by allowing the user to slide the door into position, then to engage the pivot. The inventiveness of these features has been rigorously scrutinised via a thirteen-month patent assessment procedure leading to successful granting of a UK patent (UK Patent GB 2391257 A). During the observational research and user testing process a second significant limitation of existing designs was identified. The investigation established that if a person were to fall onto the floor behind the door they could not call for help or release the door. Consequently an entirely new door release mechanism system was developed to enable the user to release the <b>bi-fold</b> <b>doors</b> from floor level. Again, the inventiveness here was rigorously scrutinised via the patent assessment procedure that led to a second successful UK patent (UK Patent GB 2391248 A) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{remainder}} of the building is timber framed and lined. Exterior walls are single skin with externally exposed stud framing lined internally with boards detailed with double beading. Internal partitions are also single skin with stop-chamfered studs and these, together with the ceiling, are lined with single-beaded tongue and groove boards. The rooms are generally without cornices except the 1901 addition which has a timber cove. Some joinery is painted, including four-panelled doors, French doors to the exterior and double hung windows. That which is clear finished includes cedar windows in the north-west (front) and south-east (rear) walls of the 1901 addition and the architraves, reveals and fanlights of the large <b>bi-folding</b> <b>door</b> opening.|$|R
50|$|The {{northern}} {{section of}} the house is divided into a number of rooms. Two large ones abut the eastern verandah, sit under the main gable, and are divided by a set of 6-panel timber <b>bi-fold</b> <b>doors.</b> Each room has a fireplace with a simple timber mantelpiece and curved back. The walls are lined with fibrous cement sheeting, which have beaded joints. They were originally lined with paper on hessian. The walls of the chimneys are painted stone. The ceilings are lined with wide, single-beaded tongue-and-groove boards, with timber cornices. Under the secondary pitch of the roof, facing west, {{there are a number of}} bedrooms. A corridor, parallel with the stairs, is situated at the southern end of this wing. It allows entry to the larger rooms behind.|$|R
50|$|Compared to its predecessor, the Siemens-Duewag U2, the SD-160's driver's {{cabin is}} {{significantly}} larger, but its total length is still less than 25 m, allowing three vehicles {{to be combined}} and still be under the 75 m maximum length of a German streetcar train assembly. Each vehicle also features an onboard closed-circuit TV security camera system for increased passenger safety. Unlike the Siemens SD-100, the Siemens SD-160 does not use the <b>bi-folded</b> <b>doors,</b> instead using sliding doors similar to designs featured on the Siemens S70. In addition, both can be used together in mixed trains consisting of SD-100s and SD-160s. The new, streetcar-length S70 cars ordered for San Diego {{are designed to be}} compatible with the SD-100, allowing the SD-100 to operate in a mixed consist, sandwiched between two S70 cars.|$|R
50|$|The Dairyliner {{range was}} {{announced}} in September 1970 and showcased at the Royal International Dairy Show held at Olympia in October. It was initially available in two models, with 24 and 36 cell batteries. The smaller battery size gave {{a top speed of}} 14 mph while the bigger battery increased the top speed to 22 mph. The vehicle was designed for a payload of 30 cwt, and much of it was made from reinforced and ABS plastics. The front wheels were at the extreme front of the vehicle, with entrance and exit from the cab through angled openings behind the wheels. Options for <b>bi-fold</b> <b>doors</b> or roller blinds to seal the exits were available, as were produce cupboards, for the storage of other products besides milk.The Dairyliner range expanded to include eight variations of vehicle.|$|R
50|$|The new station {{building}} {{was a simple}} rectangular gable ended timber structure with an office, lecture room and plant room (used to store stretchers and equipment) facing the entrance off Crown Road. The superintendent's residence was located next to the station. Many early ambulance buildings in Queensland followed the station layout first established at the 1897 Wharf Street headquarters of the QATB; a two-storey building incorporating ambulance service facilities at ground level and living quarters at the upper level, and large ground floor openings with <b>bi-fold</b> <b>doors</b> to allow ready access directly to the street for quick exit. While the Gympie building included the ground-floor provisions of a large front entrance, plant and other rooms for staff facilities, its single storey timber construction and detached superintendent's residence differed from other early stations. Early stations in Warwick and Ipswich also shared these characteristics.|$|R
50|$|The main {{entrance}} to the ground floor opens into a large central space which continues through a narrowed corridor to the rear timber <b>bi-fold</b> <b>doors.</b> Discrete rooms to the sides and rear open off the central space. Two large rectangular rooms occupy the northwest and southwest corners and are lit by banks of casement windows to {{each side of the}} room. The south side contains a stairwell and a large meeting room with a small store room. The north side contains a stairwell and two smaller interconnected rooms with a store room and toilet beyond. A tea room and toilet occupy the rear {{to the north of the}} narrow corridor space. The interior walls are painted and plastered masonry and the ceilings are rendered with a textured finish. The side rooms are a step above the central space. Doors to each side of the central space open to the stairwells that rise to the upper level. The rear toilet contains an intact early urinal.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the removal}} of the {{ambulance}} service in 1959, the station building and house have been used for residential purposes and have been home to the Bowen family since 1987. Over this period some alterations have occurred to the former station building. The front entrance <b>bi-fold</b> <b>doors</b> have been reconstructed. To mark the Gympie Ambulance Service centenary celebrations in 2002, the front awning and finial were reconstructed, replacing the originals that had been removed. In the rooms {{at the rear of the}} building, some walls and ceilings have been lined with asbestos cement sheeting. Following a mine capping excavation project in 1992 a besser block understorey was installed beneath the building. On the northern side of the building a window has been replaced by a door and a (temporary) external balcony has been added to the rear. Alterations that have occurred to the former superintendent's residence include room and kitchen reconfiguration and verandah and rear deck extensions. A lean-to has been added to the maintenance shed.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{layout of}} the building is clearly discernible. Approached from the footpath, the centred main entrance opens from the arcade into the spacious banking chamber. The manager's office and accountant's alcove are located to the left along its eastern side and strong room, toilet and stationery room along the rear to the south. A door {{in the rear of}} the western wall leads out to the lane. The dining room is located in the south-east corner. Adjacent, at rear of the bank, is an impressive stair hall which provides separate external access to the first floor manager's apartment together with through access from the service wing to the dining room. There is a storage room under the stair and linen store on the first floor. Opening off the stair hall, the apartment has an L-shaped hall leading to the western verandah where there are bathrooms clad with chamferboards located on the south-western corner. Two large principal rooms across the front (originally the drawing room and principal bedroom) and four smaller rooms (dressing room and three bedrooms) toward the rear open off the hall. The former, connected by <b>bi-folding</b> <b>doors,</b> have substantial joinery and all rooms opening onto the front and side verandahs have French doors.|$|R
5000|$|The double-storeyed {{facade of}} the new Hibernian Hall, with its stepped parapet and curved pediment, oriel window to the {{projection}} room above an ungated opening to the foyer and ticket-box, read more as a picture theatre than a community hall. The building demonstrated many of the principal elements of [...] "tropical" [...] picture theatre design of this era, including: panels of open timber lattice high along each side wall, just under the roofline and sheltered by the eaves, for cross-ventilation purposes; a row of large <b>bi-fold</b> <b>doors</b> along {{each side of the}} hall which could be opened in hot weather, those on the southern side opening to a covered promenade {{along the side of the}} building; pressed metal and fretwork panels in the auditorium ceiling, accommodating ventilation and acoustic requirements with decorative effect; a decorative pressed metal proscenium arch; a stage area which could accommodate live performance as well as film screenings; and the projection booth (or bio-box) located above the foyer and ticket box. Elements more characteristic of a hall than a picture theatre were the flat, sprung timber floor, the lack of a dress circle, the inclusion of a supper room beneath the stage, and the lack of a theatre cafe.|$|R
50|$|The side {{elevations}} are of {{a similar}} design, with the south side having a single-storeyed skillion-roofed awning over a promenade or verandah. The walls comprise 9 bays, which reflect the internal layout of the building, with the bay at the western end for the 2 storey entrance/store/bio-box area, 7 bays to the auditorium, and 1 bay at the eastern end for the stage area. The walls are constructed of timber framing. There are 7 external concrete buttresses along each wall, between which there are 5 pairs of timber <b>bi-fold</b> <b>doors</b> with skylight over. On either side, beneath the roof line, there are 7 high level panels of later metal vertical louvres providing cross-ventilation to the auditorium, with remnant panels of timber lattice above, which have been sheeted {{from the inside of}} the auditorium. Above the doors on the north side there is horizontal boarding (chamfers). On the south side, beneath the verandah awning, there is exposed stud framing above the doors. The verandah has a store at the western end, is open for the length of the auditorium and has toilets at the eastern end. The walls to the stage area are clad in horizontal boarding. The rear (eastern) elevation is of timber framing clad in vertical sheets of corrugated iron. There are 2 windows at the northern end of this rear wall, one {{to the rear of the}} stage and another to a supper room located beneath the stage. There is also a fire-escape door to the sub-floor supper room. There is a modern lean-to extension at the southern end of the rear wall, clad in vertical metal sheeting, containing changing rooms.|$|R
50|$|The {{south-western}} wing {{contains two}} large {{rooms at the}} northern end, with original <b>bi-fold</b> timber <b>doors</b> made of eight panels, approximately 2.7 metres high, dividing the former boarder's study from the refectory. At the southern end is a kitchen, with an adjacent cold room and pantry inserted where the music rooms were. The kitchen is recently fitted out; however an original stove alcove remains. The floor is covered with linoleum. These rooms contain original doors, windows, timber-lined walls and a corridor leading to the western verandah. The amenities area {{on the eastern side}} of the enclosed verandah contains some original fabric, such as doors and board lined walls. The brick enclosed staircase in the north-western corner of this wing has a simple, painted timber balustrade, carpeted stairs and pressed metal on the underside of the upper landing.|$|R
50|$|Built in 1921 the {{building}} originally {{served as a}} Crissy Field airplane hangar, which helped launch De Havilland DH-48 biplanes {{as part of the}} United States Army 91st Observation Squadron. Later it was used as a motor vehicle paint shop and office and storage space for the Army and is a contributing feature to the park's National Historic Landmark status. The hangar was redesigned by San Francisco architect, Mark Horton, and features 42 ft wide by 20 ft tall <b>bi-folding</b> glass hangar <b>door</b> and a second story catwalk overlooking the trampoline structures. Historic photography of {{the building}} and the surrounding Presidio are showcased in a 35 ft display wall at the entrance of the building.|$|R
