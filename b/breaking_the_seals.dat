'That deed, Mr. Pleydell, which you produce and found upon, is dated 1st June 17--; but this (<b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> <b>seals</b> and unfolding the document slowly) is dated the 20th--no, I see it is the 21st--of April of this present year, being ten years posterior.' ...|$|E

60|$|John Effingham {{received}} the package from his young friend, placed the lights conveniently on the table, {{put on his}} spectacles, and invited Paul to be seated. The gentlemen were placed opposite each other, the duty of <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> <b>seals,</b> and first casting an eye at {{the contents of the}} different documents, devolving, as a matter of course, on the senior of the two, who, in truth, had alone been entrusted with it.|$|E
60|$|The {{solicitor}} {{rose and}} explained that though Lord Monmouth {{had been in the}} habit of very frequently adding codicils to his will, the original will, however changed or modified, had never been revoked; it was therefore necessary to commence by reading that instrument. So saying, he sat down, and <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> <b>seals</b> of a large packet, he produced the will of Philip Augustus, Marquess of Monmouth, which had been retained in his custody since its execution.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mum as a mouse,' said he, and {{pressing}} my hand turned {{away into the}} darkness. When I returned to the sitting-room I found {{that my mother had}} hurried into the kitchen, where the crackling of sticks showed that she was busy in building a fire. Decimus Saxon was seated {{at the edge of the}} iron-bound oak chest at the side of my father, and was watching him keenly with his little twinkling eyes, while the old man was fixing his horn glasses and <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> <b>seals</b> of the packet which his strange visitor had just handed to him.|$|E

60|$|When we had {{finished}} eating, slaves appeared bearing a wooden framework from which hung a great pair of scales. Also there appeared {{officers of the}} King's Treasury, carrying leather bags which they opened, <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> <b>seals</b> {{to show that the}} contents were pure gold coin. They set a number of these bags on one of the scales, and then ordered Bes to seat himself in the other. So much heavier did he prove than they expected him to be, that they were obliged to send back to the Treasury to fetch more bags of gold, for although Bes was so short in height, his weight was that of a large man. One of the treasurers grumbled, saying he should have been weighed before he had eaten and drunk. But the officer to whom he spoke grinned and answered that it mattered little, since the King was heir to criminals and that these bags would soon return to the Treasury, only they would need washing first, a remark that made me wonder.|$|E

5000|$|When Moses Harris {{reported}} that the British had recruited him as a courier for their Secret Service, General Washington proposed that General Schuyler [...] "contrive a means of opening them without <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> <b>seals,</b> take copies of the contents, and then let them go on. By these means we should become masters of the whole plot." [...] From that point on, Washington was privy to British intelligence pouches between New York and Canada.|$|E
50|$|Something {{like the}} English probate {{is to be}} found in the rules for <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> <b>seals</b> of a will in {{presence}} of the praetor. Closely connected with the will was the donatio mortis causa, the rules of which have been as a whole adopted in England (see below). An immense space in the Corpus juris is occupied with testamentary law. The whole of part v. of the Digest (books xxviii.-xxxvi.) deals with the subject, and so do a large number of constitutions in the Code and Novels.|$|E
50|$|The diploma {{consisted}} of two bronze tablets hinged together. Inscriptions would be engraved {{on each side of}} both plates. The full text of a diploma was engraved on the outer side of the so-called tabula 1, while the outer side of tabula 2 displayed the names of 7 witnesses, their seals covered and protected by metal strips (such seals have rarely survived, being of organic material). The text of tabula 1 was reproduced exactly on the two inner sides. The plates would then be folded shut and sealed together, so that the external inscription would be legible without <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> <b>seals.</b> The internal inscription was the official notarised copy of the text on the constitutio published in Rome. The double-inscription and seals were presumably to prevent forgery or alteration.|$|E

5000|$|By the 16th century, the English Crown would habitually grant {{letters patent}} for {{monopolies}} to favoured persons (or {{people who were}} prepared to pay for them). [...] Blackstone (same reference) also explains how [...] "letters patent" [...] (Latin literae patentes, [...] "letters that lie open") were so called because <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> hung from <b>the</b> foot of the document: they were addressed [...] "To all to whom these presents shall come" [...] and could be read without <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> <b>seal,</b> as opposed to [...] "letters close", addressed to a particular person who had to <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> to read them.|$|R

5000|$|Throughout {{the fourth}} season, Lilith orchestrates the attacks {{by the forces}} of Hell on the 66 seals. They are opposed by angels, who resurrect Dean to assist them. Lilith {{eventually}} finds out that her death is the final seal that needs to be broken to free Lucifer. Reluctant to sacrifice herself, Lilith (Katherine Boecher) proposes a deal to Sam in [...] "The Monster at the End of This Book": she will stop <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> <b>seals</b> in exchange for his and Dean's lives. He rejects the deal and tries to kill her instead. She quickly overpowers him, but is forced to flee before she can do anymore when Dean tricks an archangel into coming to the location. In the season finale [...] "Lucifer Rising", Sam kills Lilith under the impression that her death will prevent the final seal from breaking, and in doing so inadvertently breaks the final seal, releasing Lucifer.|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{meeting with}} her, Howard remembers {{the events of}} the {{previous}} timeline. Miyako explains to him that the village is currently caught in an unending time loop, and that they must release the [...] "other power" [...] to stop it. They succeed in <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> <b>seals,</b> but Amana appears, knocking Howard unconscious and kidnapping Miyako. Afterward, Saiga arrives and carries Howard to the hospital, and has Bella (who had seen the whole thing) come along. When Howard comes to at the hospital, he meets Bella and discovers Saiga [...] "experimenting" [...] on a shibito. Saiga heads to the Hanuda Mine on his own, where he fights Yukie (now a mutated shibito) and retrieves an artifact called [...] "the Uryen". At the same time, Howard and Bella arrive at the Shibito Nest to find Miyako and Sam. Howard, Bella, and Sam all enter the core of the nest, where they see Amana sacrifice Miyako in the red sea, summoning an otherworldly monster—Kaiko. As the others escape, Amana stays, horrified by Kaiko's form: something has gone wrong again.|$|E
5000|$|On August 13, 1792, {{representatives of}} the National Convention arrested King Louis XVI. He was imprisoned, and later {{executed}} on January 21, 1793. This act of regicide demonstrated that “the Convention had irreversibly ruled out any compromise with the Revolution’s opponents.” [...] With {{the absence of the}} king, the French Republic sought a new national symbol. It was from these tumultuous times that the French symbol of Marianne emerged.The French Revolution not only challenged the political authority of the Old Regime led by the monarchy; it also challenged the traditional symbols that had thus far defined the French people. Anthropologists have argued that every society needs a “center” which includes social and political mapping that gives the people a sense of their place. In the traditional model of authority, “the king was the sacred center and culture was firmly fixed in the longstanding notions of a catholic hierarchical order.” [...] By decentering this frame of traditional authority while overthrowing the monarchy, revolutionaries realized that the cultural framework of the past could not be carried into the future, and that the use of the king as the insignia of the seal had to be replaced with a new seal signifying the Republic. Revolutionaries began iconoclastically destroying tangible reminders of the Old Regime, such as <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> <b>seals</b> of royalty, the scepter and the crown and melting them into republican coins.|$|E
