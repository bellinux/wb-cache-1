5|$|Henry D. Smyth was a {{professor}} of physics {{and chairman of the}} physics department of Princeton University from 1935 to 1949. During World War II, he was involved in the Manhattan Project from early 1941, initially {{as a member of the}} National Defense Research Committee’s Committee on Uranium, and later as an associate director of the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago. In late 1943, the President of Princeton University, Harold W. Dodds, began insisting that Smyth work part-time at Princeton, where there was a shortage of physicists <b>because</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> them were engaged in war work. Princeton had commitments to teach army and navy personnel, and he needed physicists like Smyth to meet those commitments. Smyth therefore became a consultant at Chicago, where he was in charge of designing a nuclear reactor that used heavy water as a neutron moderator, and commuted from Princeton, working in Chicago on alternate weeks.|$|E
5|$|The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., {{was filmed}} {{primarily}} on the Warner Bros. soundstages. Town and street scenes were staged on the Western backlot, known as Laramie Street. It {{was one of the}} last Western shows to use the backlot. Cuse said that logistics were a problem <b>because</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the Hollywood Western sets and towns had been torn down by the 1990s. Outdoor scenes were shot on the Warner Bros. ranch in Valencia, California; Bronson Canyon in Los Angeles; and the Valuze Ranch in Santa Clarita, California. Some of the locomotive scenes from Brisco were filmed on location at Railtown 1897 State Historic Park in Jamestown, California. A painting used in the show as a backdrop to create illusions of greater depth perspectives is exhibited at the park.|$|E
25|$|Proctor's {{nomenclature}} {{has often}} been criticized, mainly <b>because</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> his names honored English astronomers, but also because he used many names more than once. In particular, Dawes appeared no fewer than six times (Dawes Ocean, Dawes Continent, Dawes Sea, Dawes Strait, Dawes Isle, and Dawes Forked Bay). Even so, Proctor's names are not without charm, and for all their shortcomings they were a foundation on which later astronomers would improve.|$|E

25|$|They {{were also}} {{famous for their}} love of nightlife, which {{attracted}} a lot of criticism, especially <b>because</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> them had international duties with France. All this contributed {{to the image of}} Racing Club as an eccentric institution, but these players have also been seen as trail blazers for Stade Français's president Max Guazzini, who a few years later, took up the provocative (such as the use of the pink colour) and imaginative spirit to boost his club's image and shake off the conservative traditionalism of French rugby.|$|E
25|$|On August 8, 1863, General Pemberton, {{wrote to}} Adjutant General and Inspector General of the Confederate Army, Brigadier General Samuel Cooper {{to report that}} the troops from Trans-Mississippi Department (including Arkansas) had {{abandoned}} the Army of Mississippi before permission was obtained to furlough them. The troops were ordered to rendezvous at Camden, Arkansas. General Pemberton also requested to send Arkansas troops paroled at after the surrender of Port Hudson to that Camden as well. <b>Because</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the Vicksburg parolees, especially from Arkansas, simply went home, Major General Pemberton requested Confederate President Davis to grant the men a thirty furlough beginning on July 21.

Those who went directly home were treated {{as if they had been}} home on furlough if they eventually reported into one of these two parole centers. The exchange declaration reports issued by Colonel Robert Ould in Richmond for various units in the Vicksburg and Port Hudson surrenders began in September 1863 based upon men who actually reported into one of the two parole camps.

500|$|The {{consistent}} lack {{of artifacts}} and features in excavated Chacoan rooms suggests {{they were used}} primarily for grain storage, but because their combined areas appear to exceed what would reasonably have been needed for foodstuffs– a large crop of corn from all the arable land near Chaco would fit into two rows of rooms at Chetro Ketl– this interpretation lacks support amongst archeologists. <b>Because</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> these rooms are featureless interior spaces that lie below several stories, the scale of their construction may have been motivated by what architects call [...] "massing"; building structures with the primary intention of impressing onlookers.|$|E
2500|$|The Dust Bowl forced tens of {{thousands}} of families to abandon their farms.
