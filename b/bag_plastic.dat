These processes are the old methods which are used to preserve the seasonal surpluses of fruits and vegetables in Thailand. According to the principles of food preservation, they are divided into four methods, i. e. drying by sun-drying or evaporation to produce high total solid products, addition of sugar, salt, acid, or combination of them at high concentration, fermentation, and canning. Most of the traditional processed foods are produced in the horn?-scale industries. Some products are made day to day and sold directly to consumers. In the past, many products had low quality and short shelflife due to the lack of basic technology and careless of hygienic practice. Recently, basic technology has been transferred to producers by short-course training, personal contact, self-study from newspapers, magazines, text-books and scientific journals.

40|$|O amendoim (Arachis hypogaea L.) Ã uma oleaginosa, com teor de Ãleo de cerca de 50 % em suas sementes, sendo considerada uma cultura energÃtica. O objetivo deste estudo foi {{investigar}} o desempenho agronÃmico de 12 cultivares de amendoim, em 18 ambientes no estado do ParanÃ. Outro objetivo foi estudar as condiÃÃes que podem influenciar na qualidade fisiolÃgica das sementes produzidas e armazenadas pelos prÃprios agricultores, mediante ensaio multifatorial com cinco fatores: cultivares (IAC 886 e IAC Tatu ST) Runner, locais, (Irati, Londrina e Santa Tereza do Oeste), embalagem (saco de papel, saco de plÃstico e garrafa PET), ambientes (cÃmara fria e temperatura ambiente) e perÃodo de armazenamento. Concluiu-se que houve efeito significativo para cultivares, locais e para a interaÃÃo cultivares x locais para as caracterÃsticas rendimento de grÃos sem casca e teor de Ãleo nas sementes. As cultivares que se destacaram em rendimento de grÃos foram IAC TatuÃ, IAC TupÃ e BRS Havana. Para teor de Ãleo foram BRS 151 -L 7, IAC TatuÃ e BRS Havana, portanto em ambos os aspectos sobressaÃram IAC TatuÃ e BRS Havana. A anÃlise de adaptabilidade para rendimento de grÃos apresentou os seguintes resultados: as cultivares Runner IAC 886 e IAC CaiapÃ presentaram adaptaÃÃo especÃfica a ambientes desfavorÃveis, enquanto que IAPAR 25 TiÃÃo e IAC TupÃ aos favorÃveis. Em termos de estabilidade para rendimento de grÃos a cultivar IAC Tatu ST foi a mais previsÃvel. A qualidade fisiolÃgica das sementes de amendoim Ã influenciada pelas cultivares, locais, ambientes e perÃodo de tempo em que foram armazenadas. A cultivar IAC Tatu ST apresentou qualidade fisiolÃgica estatisticamente superior, assim como o local Londrina, o ambiente de cÃmara fria e o segundo mÃs de perÃodo de armazenamento das sementes. As embalagens utilizadas (saco de papel, saco de plÃstico e garrafa PET) nÃo influenciaram na viabilidade das sementes, no entanto as garrafas PET mostraram-se de manuseio mais prÃtico e Ãgil. The peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) is an oilseed. The seed {{of peanut}} butter has about 50 % oil content. This crop has great potential as a feedstock for the biodiesel program implemented by the Brazilian government. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the agronomic performance of 12 peanut cultivars in 18 environments in the ParanÃ State. Another objective was to study the conditions that may influence the physiological quality of seeds produced and stored by the farmers themselves, by multifactor test with five factors: cultivars (IAC 886 and IAC Runner Tatu ST), locations, (Irati, Londrina and Santa Tereza do Oeste), packaging (paper <b>bag,</b> <b>plastic</b> bag and PET bottle), environments (cold chamber and ambient temperature) and time stored period. It was concluded that there were significant effects for cultivars, environments (years, seasons and locations) and the genotype x environment interaction for shelled grain yield and oil content in peanut seeds. The cultivars IAC TatuÃ, IAC TupÃ and BRS Havana showed high yield. High oil content was verified in the cultivars BRS 151 -L 7, IAC TatuÃ and BRS Havana. The adaptability analysis for grain yield showed the following results: the cultivars Runner IAC 886 and IAC CaiapÃ showed specific adaptation to unfavorable environments, while IAPAR 25 TiÃÃo and IAC TupÃ favorable. The cultivar IAC Tatu ST was more stable for grain yield. The physiological quality of peanut seeds is influenced by cultivars, locations, environments and time stored period. Physiological statistically superior quality was observed in the cultivar IAC Tatu ST, seeds produced in Londrina, the environment âcold chamberâ and the second period seeds storage.
