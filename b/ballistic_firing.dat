40|$|The {{interior}} and exterior ballistics of tracer gun ammunition have a significant influence on {{the function of the}} tracer. In this study the burning behaviour in correlation to the tracer composition and the pressure is examined in the ICT optical bomb in air at 15 kPa to 100 kPa and 100 kPa nitrogen. Three tracer compositions with various oxygen balances were investigated using high speed photography and UV/Vis/NIR-spectrometry. The results indicate a strong correlation of sub-atmospheric pressure and the oxygen balance of the tracer composition with respect to ignition behaviour, burning temperature and luminance which is in a well agreement to <b>ballistic</b> <b>firing</b> test...|$|E

40|$|Spin-stabilized {{artillery}} munitions {{were originally}} designed to provide precise <b>ballistic</b> <b>fire</b> on long range targets. Today {{the challenge is to}} utilize these ballistic munitions in Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT) environments where significantly higher levels of precision are required to minimize collateral damage. One strategy is to retrofit these munitions with some level of low cost precision. Unique challenges arise when munitions designed to be ballistically precise are guided. Projectile flight is often stabilized by a high spin rate, which induces complex dynamics. Flight mechanics are further aggravated by the addition of a control mechanism. The goal {{of this study was to}} provide a fundamental understanding of various control mechanism strategies for spin-stabilized projectiles. Flight control systems were developed and executed in a six degree-of-freedom simulation. Formulating a generalized model of a control mechanism allowed investigation of parameters such as control force magnitude, control axial location, control lift-to-drag ratio, and control force duration. Results show that control authority linearly relates to control force magnitude. Maximal control authority was obtained by placing the control mechanism at the rear of the projectile. The variation with axial location was also determined since these results are valuable for instances when the control is unable to be located near the projectile base. A lower lift-to-drag ratio of the control mechanism decreased control authority and maximum range. Lastly, the trade-offs associated with continuous and pulsed flight control systems were quantified. Physical explanations for the simulation results are provided.

The test examines polypropylene DT fibres and hybrid blends of DT and other structural synthetic fibres to evaluate the best performing hybrid mix.
