5000|$|The K1 and K3 series [...] "compact" [...] {{cylinder}} vacuum {{was launched}} in 2002, designed to offer domestic homes with a smaller version of the C series. Using a four layer filtration 3 litre dust bag, (also with the <b>bag</b> <b>door</b> forming part of {{the underside of the}} machine)and similar Hospital grade filter system developed on the C series, the K series was also awarded with the British Allergy Foundation seal of approval and carried on with the AirBelt Clean Air diffuser design. Unlike the C series, the K series has only 3 swivel castors. The K is designed to be space efficient and smaller than the C series. Initially fitted with an 1800 watt motor to compete in the market with rivals and featured a new 500gram lighter tube and hose system earned design awards for this model. Also equipped with a longer domestic market hose and 6 metres of cable length, the K series remains popular.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "basic obscenity" [...] for {{the female}} {{genitalia}} is cunnus, [...] "cunt", though perhaps not as strongly offensive as the English. Martial uses the word more than thirty times, Catullus once, and Horace thrice only in his early work; it also appears in the Priapea and graffiti. One of the slang words women used for their genitals was porcus, [...] "pig", particularly when mature women spoke of girls. Varro connects this usage of the word to the sacrifice of a pig to the goddess Ceres in preliminary wedding rites. Metaphors of fields, gardens, and meadows are common, as {{is the image of}} the masculine [...] "plough" [...] in the feminine [...] "furrow". Other metaphors include cave, ditch, pit, <b>bag,</b> vessel, <b>door,</b> hearth, oven, and altar.|$|R

For here was a great bedroom well lighted and warmed with another log fire, also added to but lately, for the top logs were fresh, which sent a hollow roar up the wide chimney.

40|$|Submitted to Humanoids 2017 International audienceWe {{propose a}} multi-robot {{quadratic}} program (QP) controller for retargeting of a human's multi-contact loco-manipulation motions to a humanoid robot. Using this framework, the robot can track complex motions and automatically adapt to {{objects in the}} environment that have different physical properties from those {{that were used to}} provide the human's reference motion. The whole-body multi-contact manipulation problem is formulated as a multi-robot QP, which optimizes over the combined dynamics of the robot and any manipulated objects. The multi-robot QP maintains a dynamic partition of the robot's tracking links into fixed support contact, manipulation contact, and contact-free tracking links, which are re-partitioned and re-instantiated as constraints in the multi-robot QP every time a contact event occurs in the human motion. We present various experiments (<b>bag</b> retrieval, <b>door</b> opening, box lifting) using human motion data from an Xsens inertial motion capture system. We show in full-body dynamics simulation that the robot is able to perform difficult single-stance motions as well as multi-contact-stance motions (including hand supports), while adapting to objects of varying inertial properties...|$|R
5000|$|The school {{testing program}} {{was funded by}} the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) under a {{directive}} from Congress to find a safe test to detect trace amounts of illegal drugs in and beyond school environments. Report 106-404, p. 61, September 8, 2000 The program is described as emphasizing non-intrusive environmental applications of the technology, such as daily testing of doorknobs to determine what drugs are most prevalent. [...] However, a local news report emphasized that the testing can be done on students' personal items, such as like book <b>bags,</b> pencils, <b>door</b> handles, keys or cell phones, and that when evidence of criminal activity is found the school is legally required to inform police. Nonetheless, initial positive results are not taken seriously, because false positives can result from chemical cross-reactivity, second-hand contact such as a handshake with someone who has handled a drug, or lingering environmental contamination. The threshold for action may involve third or fourth positive test results or positive tests following prior negative tests, as well as the quantity of drug detected.|$|R

50|$|Shortly before Izzy's {{match with}} Rodney, he {{witnesses}} him receiving {{a bag of}} clothes {{from one of the}} teachers; while he was the toughest guy on the street, he was just a poor kid dealing with problems at home. Rodney angrily throws the bag away when he catches Izzy staring. Later, the two meet up at the gym, and Rodney maintains his merciless attitude before and during the match. He proves to be strong, but less skilled than Izzy. Kenneth instructs him to watch his movements and find his rhythm. Armed with this advice, Izzy gains the advantage, and ultimately wins. Later that night, he retrieves the clothes and drops the <b>bag</b> at Rodney's <b>door,</b> fleeing before the latter sees him, but lingering at a safe distance to watch as he takes the clothes inside. Meanwhile, Yolanda quits the Joy Jumpers, informing Mary that she cared most about winning. In a complex way, Izzy helps to cheer her up after seeing her crying from her balcony.|$|R

From the roof, he finds a Diary, an old empty bag on which [...] "Pushkalavathi Jewelers, Peshawar" [...] is printed, a Garuda locket, two magnifying lenses and a small stone with a design. He opens the diary and starts reading which is narrated by his grandfather Satyanarayana Varma (Suman). On the day of India-Pakistan, partition activists were attacking rich men and were looting them. After finding no resort to hiding, Satyanarayana Varma packs all his Jewelry and Diamonds and rushes out to a cave which is rumored to be a king's escape runway. After reaching the spot, he rests at a place keeping his <b>bag</b> on a <b>door</b> of an inlet. A bag with Diamonds falls {{into one of the}} Birds attached thus opening the inlet and the bags entering the inner space. He tried hard to get it back but removes the bird from there and falls in an abyss. But however he survived. Now there was a promissory note that 900 Diamonds of his would be inherited by his Grand Son.

500|$|Following their reunion, Bobby {{explains}} Dick Roman's endgame for humanity; cure {{humanity of}} all its diseases before herding them as livestock for the Leviathans to feed on. In {{the midst of his}} explanation, the brothers receive an email from a dead Frank Devereaux, who informs them that his hard drive, in Roman's possession at his headquarters, is currently being cybernetically attacked and will lead to their new aliases and safe houses being compromised. While Bobby attempts to convince the Winchesters to send in his flask, the brothers are concerned his hatred for Roman will compromise the operation and leave him out. The hacker responsible of cracking Devereaux's hard drive, Charlene Bradbury, witnesses a Leviathan eating and cloning her boss and is quickly able to be recruited to help the brothers against the Leviathans. While the operation is successful—wiping the hard drive, hacking Roman's email account and intercepting an important package—Charlene is unable to escape the building in time. Bobby, having snuck his flask into her <b>bag,</b> cracks the <b>doors</b> and begins to attack the Leviathans, breaking Charlene's arm in the process, leading to a concerned discussion between the brothers as to Bobby's self-control. Bobby later returns after having to recharge for a while and describes himself as [...] "stronger than ever." [...] Bobby becomes increasingly frustrated in [...] "There Will Be Blood", which only feeds his fast-growing rage and turns him more into a vengeful spirit, culminating in his possession of a maid, whom he uses to go seek vengeance on Dick. In the seventh season finale, [...] "Survival of the Fittest," [...] Sam tries to stop him, but Bobby is no longer completely in control of himself and nearly strangles Sam to death. Realizing what he is doing, he regains control and leaves the maid's body. Now knowing the danger of him losing control again, Bobby requests that Sam and Dean burn his flask. They reluctantly do so, causing his ghost to disappear.|$|R
