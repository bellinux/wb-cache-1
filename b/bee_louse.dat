50|$|Braula is a genus {{of flies}} (Diptera) {{in the family}} Braulidae or bee lice. These are very unusual flies, {{wingless}} and flattened, and barely recognizable as Diptera. Braula coeca Nitzsch is a pest of honey bees. The larvae tunnel through the wax honeycomb and the adults are found on the bodies of honey bees. There is some debate {{as to whether the}} <b>bee</b> <b>louse</b> causes damage to the honey bee. These flies sometimes can be found at places where bees congregate such as flowers or salt licks, waiting to grab onto hosts from uninfested nests. Braula is cosmopolitan and about 1.6 mm in length.|$|E
40|$|The <b>bee</b> <b>louse,</b> Braula coeca is {{a highly}} {{specialised}} flattened, wingless fly that spends its entire adult life on adult honeybees. It feeds by stealing food directly from bees during social feeding (trophallaxis). The Braula fly has a preference to infest the honeybee queen. The queen is the most attended individual in the colony but despite this the adult flies remain undetected by the workers. This is due to Braula possessing a cuticular hydrocarbon profile that mirrors that of their host honeybee colony, despite Diptera and Hymenoptera orders having separated over 290 million years ago. This chemical camouflage is most likely through odour acquisition from the honeybee host since even small colony specific differences in the alkene isomer patterns present in the honeybees were also detected in the Braula’s profile. This finding further supports {{the idea that the}} honeybee recognition cues are contained within the alkene part of their hydrocarbon profile and Braula exploit this to remain undetected within an otherwise hostile colony...|$|E

50|$|Braulidae, or <b>bee</b> <b>lice,</b> is {{a family}} of flies (Diptera) with eight species in two genera, Braula and Megabraula. These are most unusual flies, {{wingless}} and small, and barely recognizable as Diptera as they have the superficial appearance of mites or lice. They have reduced eyes and antennae hidden in grooves. Their legs are short and robust, while the claws are equipped with minute teeth. Their life-cycle is intimately connected with that of bees, particularly queens and drones. The adults are nimble and scramble for food being fed to the queen. The larvae feed on wax and pollen.|$|R
2500|$|After {{developing}} {{his method}} for creating powerful lenses and applying {{them to the}} study of the microscopic world, van Leeuwenhoek introduced his work to his friend, the prominent Dutch physician Reinier de Graaf. When the Royal Society in London published the groundbreaking work of an Italian lensmaker in their journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, de Graaf wrote to the editor of the journal, Henry Oldenburg, with a ringing endorsement of van Leeuwenhoek's microscopes which, he claimed, [...] "far surpass those which we have hitherto seen". In response, in 1673 the society published a letter from van Leeuwenhoek that included his microscopic observations on mold, <b>bees,</b> and <b>lice.</b>|$|R
40|$|The loss of Apis mellifera L. {{colonies in}} recent years has, in many regions of the world, been alarmingly high. No single cause has been {{identified}} for these losses, but the interactions between several factors (mostly pathogens and parasites) have been held responsible. Work in the Americas on honeybees originating mainly from South Africa indicates that Africanised honeybees are less affected by the interplay of pathogens and parasites. However, {{little is known about}} the health status of South African honeybees (A. m. scutellata and A. m. capensis) in relation to pathogens and parasites. We therefore compared the seasonal prevalence of honeybee pathogens (viruses, bacteria, fungi) and parasites (mites, <b>bee</b> <b>lice,</b> wax moth, small hive beetles, A. m. capensis social parasites) between sedentary and migratory A. m. scutellata apiaries situated in the Gauteng region of South Africa. No significant differences were found in the prevalence of pathogens and parasites between sedentary and migratory apiaries. Three (Black queen cell virus, Varroa destructor virus 1 and Israeli acute paralysis virus) of the eight viruses screened were detected, a remarkable difference compared to European honeybees. Even though no bacterial pathogens were detected, Nosema apis and Chalkbrood were confirmed. All of the honeybee parasites were found in the majority of the apiaries with the most common parasite being the Varroa mite. In spite of hosting few pathogens, yet most parasites, A. m. scutellata colonies appeared to be healthy.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in Bure district of Amhara region to understand and document the existing beekeeping system of the district, identify major honeybee flora and their flowering calendars, test quality of honey, identify major constraints of beekeeping opportunities and suggest possible solution for existing problems. Data were collected from 120 beekeepers having three types of hives and living in three different agro-ecologies using single-visit-multiple-subject formal survey. The major pests and predators are ants, wax moth (Galleria mellonella), <b>bee</b> <b>lice</b> (Braula coecal), beetles (Aethina tumida), spiders, wasps, prey mantis, lizard, snake, birds and honey badger (Mellivora capensis). Lack of beekeeping equipment, chemical poisoning by pesticide and herbicide application, shortage of bee forage, drought, knowledge and skill gap are the major constraints in beekeeping development in order of their importance. For honey quality test, a total of 21 honey samples were collected from three agro-ecologies in three types of hives. These samples were analyzed for eight honey quality parameters i. e. moisture, ash, acidity, pH, Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), diastase, reducing sugar and apparent sucrose content. The biochemical variation in the composition is significant (P 0. 05). All the samples were well within the limit of Codex Almentarius Commission Standard and Ethiopian Standard Authority i. e. moisture (95. 2 %), ash (100 %), acidity (100 %), pH (95. 2 %), HMF (81 %), diastase 100 %, reducing sugar (80. 9 %), and apparent sucrose (100 %) were within the acceptable range. As concluding remarks, the existing beekeeping practice of Bure district is more or less in a traditional manner and less productive interwoven by many constraints. However, almost all samples of honey examined were within the acceptable range of world and national standard and only few samples failed to meet expected standard mainly due to lack of appropriate handling during harvesting and storage of the product. To sustain the beekeeping activity there should be introducing affordable and appropriate beekeeping technologies with all accessories, strengthening the appropriate beekeeping management practices, and finally mobilizing women and non beekeepers in to sub-sectors through training.

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} in Eastern, South-East and Central zones of Tigray region from September, 2014 up to June, 2015 to determine the occurrence and prevalence of honeybee diseases and pests; investigate the effect of honeybee disease and pests inflicted on honey bee colonies and their products; to find out associated potential risk factors for honeybee disease and pests. Questionnaire survey and laboratory diagnostic methods were used for the study. In the questionnaire survey, 384 beekeepers (350 male and 34 female) were interviewed. Similarly, a total of 384 honey bee colonies in 87 apiary sites were examined for the presence of honeybee external parasites and disease pathogens. Regarding honeybee pests and predators, the rank index confirmed that the most important pests and predators affecting honeybee colonies were ants (24. 8 %), wax moth (24. 7 %), birds (15. 5 %), honey badger (13. 7 %), lizards (9 %), spiders (12 %) and death head’s hawks moth (5. 4 %). The total honeybee colonies absconded due to the major honeybee pests was estimated to be 1019 (38. 8 %). About 13 %, 12. 4 %, 9. 8 % and 3. 6 % of the colonies absconded were due to wax moth, ants, honey badger and death head’s hawks moth respectively. Colony level prevalence of Varroa mite was 61. 2 % and 53. 4 % during honey flow and dearth period seasons respectively. There was statistically significant (p< 0. 05) variation in overall prevalence of Varroa infestation between comb age, colony strength, seasons and among agro ecologies (p< 0. 01). Management affected the observed prevalence of <b>bee</b> <b>lice</b> with the overall colony level prevalence of 27. % and 5. 73 % during honey flow and dearth period seasons, respectively. Nosema and Chalk brood diseases were detected only during honey flow season with overall colony level prevalence of 38. 8 % and 16. 9 %, respectively. Amoeba was observed during the study seasons with highest colony level prevalence of 62. 5 % during the honey flow season. The result indicated that unlike honeybee pests and predators, the impact of honeybee external parasites and disease pathogens did not significantly affected honeybee colony strength. However, long term seasonal colony monitoring would be recommended. Global Affairs Canad...|$|R
