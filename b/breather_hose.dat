50|$|Four {{individual}} small air breathers: Replaces stock setup with altered crankcase <b>breather</b> <b>hose</b> re-routed into {{a single}} air cleaner (different style air cleaners were available over the years). Sprint fastback 904 venttop: Very attractive large fiberglass roof attachment, which gives the late model Corvair coupe a fastback appearance (not available for convertible or sedan). Pair of adjustable Gabriel shocks: Replaces stock rear shocks for better handling.|$|E
5000|$|... 1995 {{model year}} engines had three {{features}} that set {{them apart from}} later engines. The positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) system utilized a plastic oil separator box that was vented directly to the block itself; the <b>breather</b> <b>hose</b> and PCV valve hoses attached to the box, and connected to the induction system. Later engines featured a PCV system that was molded to the cylinder head valve cover. The second feature was internal in nature - the crankshaft main bearings were keyed into the bedplate on the right rear of each transverse web. Later model years featured keys machined on the right front of each web. These considerations are important when considering a rebuild or replacement of this engine. The third feature would be a slightly bigger camshaft that was changed on 1996 and up SOHC vehicles due to a rough idle when the air conditioning was on. This 1995 model year cam is now being sold by dealers as a power upgrade for 1996 and up SOHC engines, {{but it can also}} easily be found at salvage yards for a low price.|$|E
