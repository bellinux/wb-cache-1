5|$|As First Lord, St Vincent also {{determined}} {{to build a}} breakwater in Plymouth. The First Lord commissioned a civil engineer, John Rennie, and Joseph Whidbey, the former Master-Attendant at Woolwich dockyard, to design the breakwater. Work did not begin until 1811 but the earl is widely credited as the force <b>behind</b> <b>its</b> construction.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1990s, the Order {{stated that it}} was {{entering}} {{the second stage of}} its development, in which it would leave <b>behind</b> <b>its</b> prior focus on recruitment and public outreach within the occult community and that it would instead focus on refining its teachings; its resulting quietness led some occultists to erroneously speculate that the ONA had become defunct.|$|E

5|$|The {{discoveries of}} HAT-P-33b and HAT-P-32b were {{reported}} {{together in the}} Astrophysical Journal. The paper was submitted on June 6, 2011.

5|$|Vitalogy is {{the third}} studio album by the American rock band Pearl Jam, {{released}} on November 22, 1994, through Epic Records. Pearl Jam wrote and recorded Vitalogy while touring <b>behind</b> <b>its</b> previous album Vs. (1993). The music on the record was more diverse than previous releases, and consists of aggressive rock songs, ballads and other elements making this Pearl Jam's first experimental album.|$|E

5|$|After {{the stellar}} {{parameters}} were established, the Kepler science team ran models and fits {{to ensure that}} Kepler-5's transit event was not a false positive, such as an eclipsing binary star. Once the planetary nature of Kepler-5b was established, the Kepler team searched for the planet's occultation <b>behind</b> <b>its</b> star, hoping to find the temperature on its day side. They found both, {{and were able to}} set the equilibrium temperature of the planet. The use of speckle imaging using adaptive optics at the WIYN Observatory in Arizona and the Palomar Observatory in California isolated the starlight of Kepler-5 from background stars.|$|E
5|$|At daybreak on September 1, {{a relief}} force of C Company {{headquarters}} troops, led by American tanks, cleared {{the road to}} Sibidang-san and resupplied the 2nd Platoon, B Company, with ammunition {{just in time for}} it to repel another North Korean assault. This failed assault resulted in the killing of 77 and capturing of 21 North Koreans. Although the 35th Infantry held all its original positions, except that of the forward platoon of G Company, 3,000 North Korean soldiers were <b>behind</b> <b>its</b> lines. The farthest eastern penetration reached the high ground just south of Chirwon overlooking the north-south road there.|$|E

5|$|In 1839 Samuel Cunard, a Prince Edward Island shipowner, {{was awarded}} the first British transatlantic {{steamship}} mail contract, {{and the next year}} formed the British and North American Royal Mail Steam-Packet Company together with Robert Napier, the famous Scottish steamship engine designer and builder, to operate the line's four pioneer paddle steamers on the Liverpool–Halifax–Boston route. For most of the next 30 years, Cunard held the Blue Riband for the fastest Atlantic voyage. However, in the 1870s Cunard fell <b>behind</b> <b>its</b> rivals, the White Star Line and the Inman Line. To meet this competition, in 1879 the firm was reorganised as the Cunard Steamship Company, Ltd, to raise capital.|$|E
5|$|In 1904, the Brazilian Navy {{found itself}} well <b>behind</b> <b>its</b> Argentine and Chilean rivals in quality and total tonnage; few ships {{had been ordered}} {{since the fall of}} the Brazilian monarchy in 1889, while Argentina and Chile had just {{concluded}} a fifteen-year naval arms race which filled their navies with modern warships. Rising demand for coffee and rubber was fueling a large increase in the Brazilian government's revenue, and the country's legislature voted to devote some of the proceeds to address this naval imbalance. They believed that building a strong navy would play an essential role in remaking the country into an international power.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, No.86 Wing {{relocated}} to Canberra to help satisfy the Federal government's VIP transport needs. It returned to Richmond four years later, leaving <b>behind</b> <b>its</b> VIP contingent, No.34 Flight, which in July 1959 was re-formed as No.34 Squadron {{and left the}} control of No.86 Wing to become an independent unit directly administered by Home Command and tasked by RAAF Canberra. Having earlier augmented its complement of Dakotas with Convair 440 Metropolitans, in December 1958 the wing began operating Lockheed C-130 Hercules medium transports, when No.36 Squadron took delivery {{of the first of}} twelve C-130As. They remained in service for twenty years, clocking up 147,000 accident-free flying hours.|$|E

5000|$|Against South Melbourne in Round 6, Essendon kicked 17 <b>behinds</b> between <b>its</b> {{first and}} second goals. Only Geelong against St. Kilda in 1919 and St. Kilda against Fitzroy in 1921 have beaten this {{unwanted}} record. Fred Hiskins kicked ten behinds.|$|R
5|$|Italian naturalist Camillo Ranzani {{published}} the first scientific {{description of the}} smalltail shark, in an 1839 volume of Novi Commentarii Academiae Scientiarum Instituti Bononiensis. He named the new shark Carcharias porosus from the Greek porus ("pore"), referring to the prominent pores <b>behind</b> <b>its</b> eyes. The type specimen, a -long male from Brazil, has since been lost. This species {{was moved to the}} genus Carcharhinus by later authors. Its Trinidadian name is puppy shark.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{although}} the Argentine–Chilean agreement had limited their naval expansion, they still retained the numerous vessels {{built in the}} interim, so {{by the turn of}} the 20th century the Brazilian Navy lagged far <b>behind</b> <b>its</b> Argentine and Chilean counterparts in quality and total tonnage. Brazil's huge advantage in population—it had almost three times the population of Argentina, close to five times that of Chile, and nearly double of the two combined—led the Brazilian government to believe that it should assume a leading role in naval affairs on the continent.|$|E
5|$|Situated on an {{isolated}} patch of grass, the right-hand figure's toothed mouth is stretched open as if screaming, although David Sylvester {{has suggested that}} it may be yawning. Its mouth is open to a degree impossible for a human skull. The orange background of this panel is brighter than the hues rendered in the other frames, and the figure's neck opens up into a row of teeth, while a protruding ear juts out from <b>behind</b> <b>its</b> lower jaw. This panel closely resembles an earlier painting by Bacon, Untitled, c. 1943, which was thought destroyed until it re-emerged in 1997.|$|E

50|$|The {{social impact}} of Hennipman's work has lagged <b>behind</b> to <b>its</b> {{theoretical}} quality. On {{the one hand}} he was hampered by his knowledge and perfectionism and published relatively little work. On the other hand, his work was made accessible in English relatively late.|$|R
5|$|The nilgai is {{categorised}} as of Least Concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural resources (IUCN). While it {{is common}} in India, the nilgai occurs sparsely in Nepal and Pakistan. The major reasons <b>behind</b> <b>its</b> decimation in these two countries and extinction in Bangladesh are rampant hunting, deforestation and habitat degradation in the 20th century. As of 2008, the feral population in Texas was nearly 37,000. Wild populations also exist in the US states of Alabama, Florida and Mississippi and the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, where they have escaped from private exotic ranches. The population around the Texas-Mexico border {{is estimated to be}} around 30,000 (as of 2011).|$|E
5|$|The paper, first {{owned by}} the Reid family, {{struggled}} financially {{for most of its}} life and rarely generated enough profit for growth or capital improvements; the Reids subsidized the Herald Tribune through the paper's early years. However, it enjoyed prosperity during World War II {{and by the end of}} the conflict had pulled close to the Times in ad revenue. A series of disastrous business decisions, combined with aggressive competition from the Times and poor leadership from the Reid family, left the Herald Tribune far <b>behind</b> <b>its</b> rival.|$|E
5|$|The {{songs on}} Road to Ruin were {{considered}} by both fans and critics {{as an attempt}} to get the band more airplay. The album incorporated musical elements which were unheard of in punk rock, such as guitar solos and ballads. The difference in style caused for mixed reviews by critics, with many pointing out that the band was trying to sell more records through a change in form. This attempt by the band failed, as Road to Ruin debuted at 103 on the Billboard 200, nearly 50 places <b>behind</b> <b>its</b> predecessor Rocket to Russia.|$|E
