500|$|In 1964, Simone changed record {{distributors}} {{from the}} American Colpix to the Dutch Philips, which also meant {{a change in}} the contents of her recordings. She had always included songs in her repertoire that drew upon her African-American origins (such as [...] "Brown Baby" [...] by Oscar Brown and [...] "Zungo" [...] by Michael Olatunji in her album Nina at the Village Gate in 1962). On her debut album for Philips, Nina Simone in Concert (live recording, 1964), {{for the first time she}} openly addressed the racial inequality that was prevalent in the United States with the song [...] "Mississippi Goddam", her response to the June 12, 1963, murder of Medgar Evers and the September 15, 1963, bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama, that killed four young <b>black</b> <b>girls</b> and partially blinded a fifth girl who survived. She remarked that the title and the song itself was, [...] "like throwing 10 bullets back at them", becoming one of many other protest songs written by Simone. The song was released as a single, and it was boycotted in certain southern states. Specifically, promotional copies were smashed by a Carolina radio station and returned to Simone's record label. Simone later recalled how [...] "Mississippi Goddam" [...] was her [...] "first civil rights song" [...] and that the song came to her [...] "in a rush of fury, hatred and determination". The song was a direct challenge to widely held beliefs that race relations could change gradually and called for more immediate developments, [...] "me and my people are just about due". It was a key moment in her political radicalization. [...] "Old Jim Crow", on the same album, addressed the Jim Crow laws.|$|E

2500|$|Fewer than 10% of U.S. girls {{start to}} menstruate before 11 years of age, and 90% of all US girls are menstruating by 13.75 years of age, {{with a median}} age of 12.43 years.

2500|$|Cheryl Thompson writes, [...] "In 15th-century Africa, hairstyles {{were used}} to {{indicate}} a person's marital status, age, religion, ethnic identity, wealth and rank within the community (see Byrd & Tharps, 2001; Jacobs-Huey, 2006; Mercer, 1994; Patton, 2006; Rooks, 1996). For young <b>black</b> <b>girls,</b> Thompson says, [...] "hair is not just something to play with" [...] – {{it is something that}} sends a message, not only to the outside public but also a message on how they see themselves. [...] "In the 1800s and early 1900s, nappy, kinky, curly hair was deemed inferior, ugly and unkempt in comparison to the flowing, bouncy hair of people from other cultures," [...] says Marcia Wade Talbert in Black Enterprise. Chemical relaxers increased in demand throughout the 1800s and 1900s. These relaxers often contained sodium hydroxide (lye) or guanidine hydroxide which result in hair breakage, thinning of the hair, slowing of hair growth, scalp damage and even hair loss, according to Gheni Platenurg in the article, [...] "Black Women Returning to Their Natural Hair Roots." ...|$|E
2500|$|After Tracy {{eventually}} made {{it on the}} show, there was a song [...] "The New Girl in Town", which was sung first by the Council girls and later by the <b>black</b> <b>Girls.</b> Although later cut early during the Seattle tryout, it {{was included in the}} 2007 film and appears in the show’s instrumental score. [...] "The Mother-Daughter Cha-Cha-Cha" [...] was another cut number that originally followed [...] "Big, Blonde, and Beautiful". [...] Later, the writers absorbed the protest rally and Mother-Daughter Day into the number, thus deleting the song and folding the sequence into a single scene. A song called [...] "Step on Up" [...] was also cut in favor of [...] "I Know Where I’ve Been". Early on in the genesis of the show, the plot involved a [...] "Miss Auto Show" [...] competition, as in the 1988 film, instead of [...] "Miss Teenage Hairspray". For this competition, later revised due to the cost of cars onstage, there was a song called [...] "Take a Spin" [...] sung by Corny in the place where “(It’s) Hairspray” is now. After Amber’s rendition of [...] "Cooties", Tracy had a song before the finale called [...] "It Ain’t Over ’Til the Fat Lady Sings," [...] though, it was cut after the third reading of the show; it was included as a track on the Special Edition of the 2007 motion picture's soundtrack.|$|E
