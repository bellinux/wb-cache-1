5|$|In 1992–93, {{the inaugural}} {{season of the}} English Premier League, Norwich City led the league {{for much of the}} season, having been among the {{pre-season}} favourites for relegation, and were eight points clear of the field shortly before Christmas, before faltering in the final weeks to finish third behind the champions, Manchester United, and Aston Villa. They had shown that they were {{a force to be reckoned}} with from the very first day of the Premier League season, achieving an impressive 4–2 away win over an Arsenal side who were among the pre-season title favourites in a race finally won by Manchester United. This was a <b>big</b> <b>surprise</b> not least to the media and pundits who had tipped Norwich for a season of struggle.|$|E
25|$|Considering its poetic roots (Russian literature, bard music), {{it is not}} a <b>big</b> <b>surprise</b> that lyrics play a {{far larger}} role in Russian rock than Western rock. Vocal melody is {{sometimes}} eschewed in favor of a more impassioned delivery (Viktor Tsoi, the lead singer of Kino, pioneered a characteristically strained, monotonous style of singing that has been imitated by many).|$|E
25|$|The 2005–06 Argentine First Division Clausura saw Boca Juniors {{become the}} first team since River Plate in 1999–2000 to win the Apertura and the Clausura in the same season. This capped an amazing year for Boca, as they won every tournament they were {{eligible}} (they were not eligible for the Copa Libertadores after a dismal Clausura last season). Lanús were the <b>big</b> <b>surprise</b> of the Clausura, as they {{finished second in the}} league. Boca also achieved 80 points in a season {{for the first time since}} 1998/99 when they scored 89 points.|$|E

But the <b>big</b> <b>surprise</b> of the season came from the United States who surprised everyone by taking out the 2015 London Sevens to finish in 6th place from 13th the previous season.

25|$|Hungarian legend Ferenc Puskás was {{appointed}} {{as the head}} coach of the national side in 1993 in order to bring back earlier success. He led the team for only four matches, however, as the former Honvéd and Real Madrid star failed to make an impact. The only remarkable success in the 1990s was the qualification of Hungary to the 1996 Summer Olympics. Antal Dunai's team played its first group match against Nigeria and lost to 1–0 in Orlando. In the second group match, Hungary played Brazil and lost to 3–1. The only Hungarian goal was scored by Csaba Madar. The last group match was played against Japan, a 3–2 loss. The Hungarian goals were scored by Csaba Madar and Tamás Sándor. Although the Olympic qualification of the young team was a <b>big</b> <b>surprise</b> and people thought that Hungary would have a better future in football history, the team never reached any similar success later.|$|E

Anna’s staying at the Bishop house with Walter running around with no clothes on except for a pair of slippers, getting breakfast.
