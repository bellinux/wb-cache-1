5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the hurricane in coastal Florida, it became apparent that well-constructed <b>buildings</b> <b>with</b> shutters had suffered practically no damage from winds that caused serious structural problems to lesser buildings. <b>Buildings</b> <b>with</b> well-constructed frames, and those made of steel, concrete, brick, or stone were largely immune to the winds, and the use of shutters prevented damage to windows and the interior of the buildings. Coming {{on the heels of the}} 1926 Miami hurricane where a similar pattern had been noticed, one lasting result of the 1928 storm was improved building codes.|$|E
