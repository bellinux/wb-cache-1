5|$|The {{sea otter}} is diurnal. It has {{a period of}} {{foraging}} and eating in the morning, starting {{about an hour before}} sunrise, then rests or sleeps in mid-day. Foraging resumes for a few hours in the afternoon and subsides before sunset, and a third foraging period may occur around midnight. Females with pups appear to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>inclined</b> to feed at night. Observations of the amount of time a sea otter must spend each day foraging range from 24 to 60%, apparently depending on the availability of food in the area.|$|E

25|$|Rhodesian ridgebacks are loyal, intelligent, and {{somewhat}} aloof to strangers. This {{is not to}} be confused with aggression; a ridgeback of proper temperament will <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>inclined</b> to ignore, rather than challenge, a stranger. This breed requires positive, reward-based training, good socialization and consistency; it is often not the best choice for inexperienced dog owners. Ridgebacks are strong-willed, intelligent, and many seem to have a penchant for mischief, though loving. They are protective of their owners and families. If trained well, they can be excellent guard dogs. Like any dog, they can become aggressive when they are not socialized properly.|$|E
25|$|Because {{relatedness}} differs in haplodiploid species, {{the effects}} of kin selection are predicted to differ {{from that of a}} diploid species. V. pensylvanica is a haplodiploid species. Thus, female offspring have a 0.75 relatedness to their sisters, but only a 0.25 relatedness to their brothers. As a result, kin selection posits that workers will <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>inclined</b> to show altruistic behavior toward sisters than brothers. Further, this implies that a conflict over sex ratio may result, with workers preferring their mothers to have daughters. Because the mother is related equally to sons and daughters, kin selection predicts the mother will not show a preference toward either sex.|$|E

Therefore, while there was no intention to forbid all ground action above the parallel, there was some question in the mind of Secretary of State Dean Acheson and among many members of the United Nations whether the Eighth Army should make a general advance into North Korea.|$|E
25|$|In November 2009, The Economist {{estimated}} that taxing employer-provided health insurance (which is presently exempt from tax) would add $215 {{billion per year}} to federal tax revenue during the 2013–2014 periods. Peter Singer wrote in the New York Times that the current exclusion of insurance premiums from compensation represents a $200 billion subsidy for the private insurance industry {{and that it would}} likely not exist without it. In other words, taxpayers might <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>inclined</b> to change behavior or the system itself if they were paying $200 billion more in taxes each year related to health insurance. To put this amount in perspective, the federal government collected $1,146 billion in income taxes in 2008, so $200 billion represents a 17.5% increase in the effective tax rate.|$|E
500|$|CBC's The Current held {{a debate}} {{on the merits of}} the ethical oil {{argument}} in Dec 2011. [...] Nobel laureate and chair of the Nobel Women's Initiative Jody Williams, argued that the ethical oil position was disingenuous and suspect of commercial interests rather than genuine concern for women’s rights. [...] She argued that the oil industry with no history of advocating the case of women’s rights, is ill placed to begin the discussion. [...] Ethical Oil spokesperson Kathryn Marshall responded that the ethical nature of oil production needs to be discussed, and she expected human rights activists to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>inclined</b> to promote dialogue. [...] Dr. Andrew Crane a business ethics professor at York University agreed the ethical argument for oil production should be discussed, but also added the narrow focus of the books argument was prioritizing human rights over other ethical evaluating factors. [...] Dr. Crane further stated that Canada was not taking a leadership position by trying to improve ethical extraction practices overseas and not just in Canada. [...] He argued a primary ethical indicator is leadership, and companies operating in Canada, and Canadian companies operating abroad were not being held accountable within the ethical oil argument for their overseas practices. [...] Kathryn Marshall responded the focus should be on the pushing these [...] "unethical" [...] countries for regulatory action, rather than the pushing the companies to improve {{in the absence of a}} regulatory impetus.|$|E

2500|$|To avoid {{significantly}} higher levels of taxation than expected, voters also need to consider local tax proposals that are likely to appear on the ballot in the near future. [...] Local governments frequently coordinate the scheduling of their tax elections to increase the chances of multiple tax measures passing over a short time window. [...] For example, local tax measures may be placed on the ballot during a statewide primary election in coordination with other local governments placing their tax measures on a statewide general election occurring several months later. [...] More patient local governments are also willing to wait another election cycle for a more favorable election date to increase the chances of passing a local tax. [...] This is especially the case for presidential general elections where voters tend to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>inclined</b> to support taxes.|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, the Washington Institute for Near East Policy (a {{think tank}} founded by [...] "a {{small group of}} visionary Americans {{committed}} to advancing U.S. interests in the Middle East") argued that the U.S.-Israel relationship is [...] "A Strategic Asset for the United States." [...] In discussing their report, Walter B. Slocombe said that while in the popular imagination, the U.S.-Israel relationship is only good for Israel, Israel provides enormous assistance to the United States, including military expertise which has saved American lives in Iraq and Afghanistan. [...] Robert D. Blackwill countered {{the claim that the}} U.S.-Israel relationship significantly damages the relationship between the United States and the Arab world. [...] He asked rhetorically: [...] "Would Saudi Arabia's policies toward the United States be markedly different in practice if Washington entered into a sustained crisis with Israel over the Palestine issue during which the bilateral relationship between the United States and Israel went into steep, systemic decline? In that instance, would Riyadh lower the price of oil? Would it stop hedging its regional bets concerning U.S. attempts to coerce Iran into freezing its nuclear weapons program? Would it regard U.S. policy toward Afghanistan any less critically? Would it view American democracy promotion in the Middle East more favorably? Would it <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>inclined</b> to reform its internal governmental processes to be more in line with U.S. preferences? Walt [...] and I judge the answer to all these questions [...] 'No.'" [...] When asked how this report could so flatly contradict the Walt and Mearsheimer thesis, Slocombe responded, [...] "There is so much error in the world," [...] and added, [...] "I think {{it would be interesting to}} ask them whether they make the same contrary argument about the other countries to whom we also provide something like this kind of support. [...] There are obviously differences, but the principle is the same." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ingroup bonding: Oxytocin can {{increase}} positive attitudes, such as bonding, toward individuals with similar characteristics, who then become classified as [...] "in-group" [...] members, whereas {{individuals who are}} dissimilar become classified as [...] "out-group" [...] members. Race {{can be used as}} an example of in-group and out-group tendencies because society often categorizes individuals into groups based on race (Caucasian, African American, Latino, etc.). One study that examined race and empathy found that participants receiving nasally administered oxytocin had stronger reactions to pictures of in-group members making pained faces than to pictures of out-group members with the same expression. This shows that oxytocin may be implicated in our ability to empathize with individuals of different races and could potentially translate into willingness to help individuals in pain or stressful situations. Moreover, individuals of one race may <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>inclined</b> to help individuals of the same race than individuals of another race when they are experiencing pain. Oxytocin has also been implicated in lying when lying would prove beneficial to other in-group members. In a study where such a relationship was examined, it was found that when individuals were administered oxytocin, rates of dishonesty in the participants' responses increased for their in-group members when a beneficial outcome for their group was expected. Both of these examples show the tendency to act in ways that benefit people with which one feels is part of their social group, or in-group. Oxytocin is not only correlated with the preferences of individuals to associate with members of their own group, but it is also evident during conflicts between members of different groups. [...] During conflict, individuals receiving nasally administered oxytocin demonstrate more frequent defense-motivated responses toward in-group members than out-group members. Further, oxytocin was correlated with participant desire to protect vulnerable in-group members, despite that individual's attachment to the conflict. Similarly, it has been demonstrated that when oxytocin is administered, individuals alter their subjective preferences in order to align with in-group ideals over out-group ideals. These studies demonstrate that oxytocin is associated with intergroup dynamics. [...] Further, oxytocin influences the responses of individuals in a particular group to those of another group. The in-group bias is evident in smaller groups; however, it can also be extended to groups as large as one's entire country leading toward a tendency of strong national zeal. A study done in the Netherlands showed that oxytocin increased the in-group favoritism of their nation while decreasing acceptance of members of other ethnicities and foreigners. People also show more affection for their country's flag while remaining indifferent to other cultural objects when exposed to oxytocin. It has thus been hypothesized that this hormone may be a factor in xenophobic tendencies secondary to this effect. [...] Thus, oxytocin appears to affect individuals at an international level where the in-group becomes a specific [...] "home" [...] country and the out-group grows to include all other countries.|$|E

40|$|Past {{research}} on word-of-mouth has presented inconsistent evidence {{as to whether}} consumers <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>inclined</b> to share positive or negative information about products and services. Some findings suggest that consumers <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>inclined</b> to engage in positive word-of-mouth, whereas others suggest that consumers <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>inclined</b> to engage in negative word-of-mouth. The present research offers a theoretical perspective that provides one means to resolve these seemingly contradictory findings. Specifically, the present work compares the generation of word-of-mouth (i. e., consumers sharing information about their own experiences) to the transmission of word-mouth (i. e., consumers passing-on information about experiences they heard occurred to others). The authors suggest that a basic human motive to self-enhance leads consumers to generate positive word-of-mouth (i. e., share information about their own positive consumption experiences), but transmit negative word-of-mouth (i. e., pass-on information they heard about other’s negative consumption experiences). The authors present evidence for self-enhancement motives playing out in opposite ways at word-of-mouth generation compared to word-of-mouth transmission across four experiments...|$|R
