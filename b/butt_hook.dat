50|$|Sliding or folding {{stocks are}} often seen on {{military-grade}} weapons and their civilian-derived arms. A collapsible stock makes the weapon more compact for storage or transport, but is usually deployed before shooting for better control. A <b>butt</b> <b>hook,</b> {{which is an}} attachment to {{the butt of the}} gun that is put under the shooter's arm to prevent the rifle from pivoting forward from the weight of the barrel is sometimes used in competitive rifle shooting. These stocks are also used on combat shotguns like the Franchi SPAS-12 to allow the stock to collapse when not in use.|$|E
50|$|Pre-Charged Pneumatic (PCP) rifles {{are more}} popular than spring guns as the much lower recoil {{provides}} more confidence in aim for most people. There are some FT shooters who compete {{at a very high}} level with a spring gun, and a well-engineered gun, shot with some skill will be no less accurate than a PCP. There are some “dedicated” FT designs available, with the main features being a deep stock or adjustable platform ("Hamster") to rest on the knee while shooting seated, a high or adjustable cheek-piece to suit the large telescopic sights, and often an adjustable butt or <b>butt</b> <b>hook.</b> Many experienced shooters have chosen to use made-to-measure custom stocks for their rifles, and there are a small number of stockers in the UK who compete in FT and have a good understanding of the specific requirements of the sport.|$|E
50|$|The falcata has a single-edged blade that pitches forward {{towards the}} point, the edge being concave near the hilt, but convex near the point. This shape {{distributes}} the weight {{in such a}} way that the falcata is capable of delivering a blow with the momentum of an axe, while maintaining the longer cutting edge of a sword. The grip is typically hook-shaped, the end often stylized in the shape of a horse or a bird. There is often a thin chain connecting the <b>hooked</b> <b>butt</b> of the Iberian with the hilt. Although usually a single-edged weapon, double-edged falcatas have been found.|$|R
5000|$|All pesh-kabz use a hollow-ground, {{tempered}} steel single-edged full-tang blade {{with a thick}} spine bearing a [...] "T" [...] cross-section for strength and rigidity. In most examples, a pair of handle scales are fixed to the full-tang grip, which features a <b>hooked</b> <b>butt.</b> The earliest forms of this knife featured a recurved blade, suggestive of its Persian origins, but later examples may be found with both recurved or straight blades. The straight blade is the more common form in South Asia. In all variants the blade is invariably broad at the hilt, but tapers progressively and radically to a needle-like, triangular tip. Upon striking a coat of mail, this reinforced tip spreads the chain link apart, enabling {{the rest of the}} blade to penetrate the armor. One knife authority concluded that the pesh-kabz [...] "as a piece of engineering design could hardly be improved upon for the purpose".|$|R
