5|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the Civil War, Burnett sought an audience with President Andrew Johnson, an old congressional colleague, but Johnson told him to go home. Burnett was indicted for treason at Louisville, but released on bond and never prosecuted. He partnered with Judge John R. Grace and resumed the practice of law in Cadiz. He died of cholera in Hopkinsville on September 28, 1866. Initially buried in the Old Cadiz Cemetery, he was moved to the East End Cemetery in Cadiz.

5|$|The stone <b>bears</b> <b>no</b> idiomatic Pictish symbols and, under J Romilly Allen and Joseph Anderson's {{classification}} system, it is a class III stone. Intact freestanding crosses of {{this age}} are comparatively rare, perhaps due to their vulnerability to damage, and {{the only ones in}} Eastern Scotland are the Camus Cross and the Dupplin Cross in Strathearn. Fragmentary remains of other crosses include heads found at Forteviot, St Vigeans and Strathmartine and shaft fragments found at Monifieth, Abernethy, Carpow and Invermay, as well as some socketed stones where crosses once stood.|$|E
5|$|According to the 1993 book by Russian {{psychiatrist}} Mikhail Buyanov, {{the harm}} inflicted by Soviet punitive psychiatry {{on the image}} of domestic medicine is, of course, great, but <b>bears</b> <b>no</b> comparison to the crimes of the Nazi doctors. Now, when all the passions have cooled, one {{can say that the}} zeal of Soviet psychiatrists inflicted suffering on up to 100 or 120 people of all 280 million citizens of the former Soviet Union, Buyanov writes. He adds that among the persons were many fanatical nationalists, religious sectarians, and political paranoiacs who after escaping to freedom corrupted the masses, сrammed their heads with nonsense, carried away immature people with their ideas through the connivance of the so-called progressive intelligentsia, and a result of it is wars, blood, and reciprocal hatred.|$|E
5|$|The Sumerian King List (SKL) records a dynasty of six kings from Mari enjoying hegemony {{between the}} dynasty of Adab and the dynasty of Kish. The {{names of the}} Mariote kings were damaged on the early copies of the list, and those kings were {{correlated}} with historical kings {{that belonged to the}} second city. However, an undamaged copy of the list that date to the old Babylonian period was discovered in Shubat-Enlil, and the names <b>bears</b> <b>no</b> resemblance to any of the historically attested monarchs of the second city, indicating that the compilers of the list had an older and probably a legendary dynasty in mind, that predate the second city.|$|E

5|$|The present {{trend in}} dancing among {{the youth of}} the Islands and in Honiara also is {{freestyle}} dancing, which has become integral to the night life and entertainment scene. These dance <b>bears</b> <b>no</b> resemblance to the traditional dance forms of the Solomon Islands, and are copied from the films You Got Served, the Step Up franchise and Stomp the Yard. Panpipe performances are held at the Mendana Hotel in Honiara every week. The famous Panpipe band is the Narasirato from Are'are in south Maleta. The Mao dancers from Kawara'ae, the Wasi Ka Nanara Pan Pipers, Tamure dancing, and Batikama Adventist bamboo band are other well known groups. Gilbertese dancing is also popular along with Panpipe music groups. Most of these dances are performed in many leading hotels of Honiara.|$|E
5|$|Although very {{distinctive}} in appearance, the {{fly agaric}} has been mistaken for other yellow to red mushroom {{species in the}} Americas, such as Armillaria cf. mellea and the edible Amanita basii—a Mexican species similar to A.caesarea of Europe. Poison control centres in the U.S. and Canada have become aware that amarill (Spanish for 'yellow') is a common name for the A.caesarea-like species in Mexico. Amanita caesarea can be distinguished by its entirely orange to red cap which lacks the numerous white warty spots of the fly agaric. Furthermore, the stem, gills and ring of A. caesarea are bright yellow, not white. The volva is a distinct white bag, not broken into scales. In Australia, the introduced fly agaric may {{be confused with the}} native vermilion grisette (Amanita xanthocephala), which grows in association with eucalypts. The latter species generally lacks the white warts of A.muscaria and <b>bears</b> <b>no</b> ring.|$|E
5|$|As Islamic {{regulations}} {{stated in}} the primary sources do not explicitly deal with every conceivable eventuality, jurisprudence must refer to resources and authentic documents to find the correct course of action. According to Sunni schools of law, secondary sources of Islamic law are consensus, {{the exact nature of}} which <b>bears</b> <b>no</b> consensus itself; analogical reason; pure reason; seeking the public interest; juristic discretion; the rulings of the first generation of Muslims; and local customs. Hanafi school frequently relies on analogical deduction and independent reasoning, and Maliki and Hanbali generally use the Hadith instead. Shafi'i school uses Sunnah more than Hanafi and analogy more than two others. Among Shia, Usuli school of Ja'fari jurisprudence uses four sources, which are Qur'an, Sunnah, consensus and the intellect. They use consensus under special conditions and rely on the intellect to find general principles based on the Qur'an and Sunnah, and use the principles of jurisprudence as a methodology to interpret the Qur'an and Sunnah in different circumstances. Akhbari Ja'faris rely more on tradition and reject ijtihad. According to Momen, despite considerable differences in the principles of jurisprudence between Shia and the four Sunni schools of law, there are fewer differences in the practical application of jurisprudence to ritual observances and social transactions.|$|E

5|$|Eleven other {{historical}} {{counties have}} existed in Massachusetts, most becoming defunct when their lands were {{absorbed into the}} colony of New Hampshire or the state of Maine, {{both of which were}} created out of territory originally claimed by Massachusetts colonists. The oldest counties still in Massachusetts are Essex County, Middlesex County, and Suffolk County, created in 1643 with the original Norfolk County which was absorbed by New Hampshire and <b>bears</b> <b>no</b> relation to the modern Norfolk County. When these counties were created, they were a part of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, which would remain separate from the Plymouth Colony and that colony's counties until 1691. Hampden County, created in 1812, is the most recently created county still in Massachusetts, although Penobscot County, Maine bore that distinction until Maine broke off from Massachusetts in 1820. The majority of Massachusetts counties are named in honor of English place names, reflecting Massachusetts' colonial heritage.|$|E
5|$|F.C. United's club colours are red, {{white and}} black—the same colours worn by Manchester United. The shirt <b>bears</b> <b>no</b> {{sponsorship}} logo, {{as it was}} written into the club's constitution that the club should not have a shirt sponsor. The club's first kit was a plain red shirt, white shorts and plain black socks. The club introduced a new home shirt for the 2007–08 season with a striped collar and striped ends on the sleeves which lasted until 2009. This was changed for the 2009–11 seasons to a red shirt with {{a black and white}} stripe down the left side, manufactured by Admiral Sportswear. For seasons 2011–13 the club reverted to a plain red shirt, manufactured by O'Neills. The club's second kit, worn when playing away against a team with a predominantly red kit, is a white shirt with a horizontal red and black wave, white shorts and socks. The club has an alternative plain blue kit for playing against a team with a red and white kit. In past seasons white shirts with diagonal black or red stripes and a white shirt with a red trim, black shorts and white socks have all been used as the second kits.|$|E
5|$|Godwin had {{a lifelong}} {{interest}} {{in language and}} communication (as is evident in Gonsales's various means of communicating with his servant Diego on St Helena), {{and this was the}} topic of his Nuncius inanimatus (1629). The language Gonsales encounters on the Moon <b>bears</b> <b>no</b> relation to any he is familiar with, and it takes him months to acquire sufficient fluency to communicate properly with the inhabitants. While its vocabulary appears limited, its possibilities for meaning are multiplied since the meaning of words and phrases also depends on tone. Invented languages were an important element of earlier fantastical accounts such as Thomas More's Utopia, François Rabelais's Gargantua and Pantagruel and Joseph Hall's Mundus Alter et Idem, all books that Godwin was familiar with. P. Cornelius, in a study of invented languages in imaginary travel accounts from the 17th and 18th centuries, proposes that a perfect, rationally organised language is indicative of the Enlightenment's rationalism. As H. Neville Davies argues, Godwin's imaginary language is more perfect than for instance More's in one aspect: it is spoken on the entire Moon and has not suffered from the Earthly dispersion of languages caused by the fall of the Tower of Babel.|$|E

5|$|When {{plans for}} Runcorn New Town were drawn up, they {{included}} three distinct types of road: local roads, expressways and the Busway. The expressways {{are intended to}} keep all through traffic off the local roads. This system links to the north by the A533 over the Silver Jubilee Bridge to Widnes and Merseyside, to the northeast to Warrington by the A56, to the east to Northwich and north Cheshire by the A533, and to the southeast by the A557 to the M56 and to Frodsham. The M56 links to the M6 and, {{to the north of}} Widnes, the A557 links to the M62. The Busway is a system of roads for use by buses only, and <b>bears</b> <b>no</b> resemblance to guided busways or bus lanes in use elsewhere, as it is a totally separate road system, not running alongside (or down the middle of) existing roads. In addition, there is a network of dedicated cycleways in the town.|$|E
