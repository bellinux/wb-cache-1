50|$|This fish is anadromous, {{living in}} marine systems and {{spawning}} in deep, swift freshwater rivers with hard substrates. It migrates to spawning grounds in the spring. In Connecticut, <b>blueback</b> <b>shad</b> spawn in 14 to 17 C water, usually {{later in the}} spring than the alewife. During spawning, many eggs are deposited over the stream bottom, where they stick to gravel, stones, logs, or other objects. Juveniles spend three to seven months in fresh water, then migrate to the ocean. The <b>blueback</b> <b>shad</b> is a planktivorous forage species.|$|E
50|$|The {{blueback herring}} or <b>blueback</b> <b>shad</b> (Alosa aestivalis) is an {{anadromous}} species of herring {{from the east}} coast of North America, with a range from Nova Scotia to Florida. Blueback herring form schools and are believed to migrate offshore to overwinter near the bottom.|$|E
50|$|<b>Blueback</b> <b>shad</b> {{were first}} {{collected}} in Lake Ontario in 1995, {{and have been}} collected from the Tennessee River in Georgia and Tennessee; Oneida Lake, the Oswego River, and Lake Champlain in New York. In North Carolina, <b>blueback</b> <b>shad</b> were introduced into the Savannah, Broad, and Yadkin River basins, and into non-native areas of the Cape Fear and Roanoke River basins. It has been introduced to an unspecified location in the Chesapeake Bay basin in Pennsylvania. They have been collected in Lake Jocassee, Lake Keowee, Picalet River, Broad River, and Lake Murray in South Carolina. Stock obtained from the Cooper River, South Carolina, was released in Texas by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department in Lake Theo, Briscoe County, and at an unidentified research site in north Texas in 1982 (and in the upper Red River drainage). Bluebacks have been collected from Lake Champlain, Vermont, and have been stocked in several inland reservoirs in Virginia, including Smith Mountain Lake, Occoquan Reservoir, Kerr Reservoir, and Lakes Anna, Brittle, and Chesdin. It is established as a species in Texas, New York, North Carolina, Vermont, and Virginia.|$|E
50|$|According to the Sebasticook Regional Land Trust:The Sebasticook River is {{the largest}} {{tributary}} (985 square miles) to the Kennebec and thus {{plays an important role}} in the restoration of both the anadromous and resident aquatic fisheries of the Kennebec basin and the Gulf of Maine ecosystem. Due to its relatively close proximity to the lower Kennebec, large drainage area, and low gradient, this watershed historically contributed a major percentage of available spawning and nursery habitat for anadromous runs of alewife, <b>blueback</b> herring, American <b>shad,</b> rainbow smelt, and striped bass associated with the Kennebec River watershed and Gulf of Maine ecosystems. To a lesser extent, the river provided habitat for Atlantic salmon.|$|R
40|$|The {{historic}} and present ranges of anadromous alosids and striped bass were determined {{for three of}} Virginia 2 ̆ 7 s rivers. American <b>shad,</b> <b>blueback</b> herring, and alewives migrated to at least Remington (river mile 188) on the Rappahannock River. They ascended {{the entire length of}} the York River, reaching at least Milford on the Mattaponi and {{the entire length of the}} Pamunkey. The alosids traversed the full length of the James River, reaching above Clifton Forge and Covington. Although striped bass were historically caught in the James as far upstream as Balcony Falls (near Glasgow) and probably as far upstream as shad on the other rivers, it is doubtful that they ever spawned above the fall line on any river. Present ranges for all species are Fredericksburg (Embrey Dam) on the Rappahannock, unchanged on the York, and Richmond (Bosher Dam) on the James. One dam on the Rappahannock River and twelve dams on the James River were identified as actual or potential barriers to the upstream spawning migrations of Virginia 2 ̆ 7 s anadromous fishes. Elimination of these barriers by breaching, in the case of unused facilities, or by these construction of fish passage facilities would result in the restoration of 47 miles of mainstem river (a 30...|$|R
5000|$|The {{ability of}} the blue catfish to {{tolerate}} {{a wide range of}} climates and brackish water has allowed it to thrive in Virginia's rivers, lakes, tributaries, and the Chesapeake Bay. Unfortunately, the relatively low mortality rate, large body size, wide range of species preyed upon, and success as a predator has resulted in the blue catfish being considered a problematic invasive species in Virginia. Since their introduction in Virginia waters in the 1970s, blue catfish populations have exploded. Recent electrofishing studies have documented capture rates in excess of 6,000 fish/hr , whereas studies from the native range show peak electrofishing capture rates of 700 fish/hr [...] Clearly, blue catfish are a dominant species within the freshwater and oligohaline portions of Virginia's tidal rivers. The introduction of blue catfish in Virginia's tidal rivers was thought to have negative impacts on anadromous American <b>shad,</b> <b>blueback</b> herrring, and alewife; however, predation of these species by blue catfish has been demonstrated to be minimial. Much of the narrative that has been built around the species as a dangerous apex predator in the Chesapeake Bay is simply not true. Researchers from Virginia Tech have found the species to be mostly herbivorous and omnivorous, with diets comprised largely of hydrilla and Asian clams, both of which are invasive to the Chesapeake Bay [...] Blue catfish do eat blue crabs with some regularity, which is problematic because blue crabs represent the most valuable fishery in the Chesapeake Bay ...|$|R
5000|$|These {{fish are}} silvery in color, {{have a series}} of scutes (modified, spiny and keeled scales) along their bellies, and are {{characterized}} by deep bluish-green backs. They reach a maximum size of approximately 40 cm and are believed to live up to 8 years. The most distinguishing characteristic of this species is the black to dusky in color of its peritoneum (the lining of the abdominal cavity). It is one of the [...] "typical" [...] North American shads. They are often confused with alewifes because <b>blueback</b> <b>shad</b> and alewives are difficult to distinguish from one another, and together these two species are often regarded collectively as [...] "river herring". Alewives have larger eyes, greater body depth, and pearly to white peritoneal linings.|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} species of clupeid fish, {{including}} <b>blueback</b> herring, American <b>shad,</b> and gulf menhaden, can detect and respond to ultrasonic sounds up to at least 180 kHz, whereas other clupeids, including bay anchovies and Spanish sardines, {{do not appear to}} detect sounds above about 4 kHz. Although the location for ultrasound detection has not been proven conclusively, there is a growing body of physiological, developmental, and anatomical evidence suggesting that one end organ of the inner ear, the utricle, {{is likely to be the}} detector. The utricle is a region of the inner ear that is very similar in all vertebrates studied to date, except for clupeid fish, where it is highly specialized. Behavioural studies of the responses of American shad to ultrasound demonstrate that they show a graded series of responses depending on the sound level and, to a lesser degree, on the frequency of the stimulus. Low-intensity stimuli elicit a non-directional movement of the fish, whereas somewhat higher sound levels elicit a directional movement away from the sound source. Still higher level sounds produce a “wild” chaotic movement of the fish. These responses do not occur until shad have developed the adult utricle that has a three-part sensory epithelium. We speculate that the response of the American shad (and, presumably, other clupeids that can detect ultrasound) to ultrasound evolved to help these species detect and avoid a major predator – echolocating cetaceans. As dolphins echolocate, the fish are able to hear the sound at over 100 m. If the dolphins detect the fish and come closer, the nature of the behavioural response of the fish changes in order to exploit different avoidance strategies and lower the chance of being eaten by the predators...|$|R
40|$|EA Engineering, Science, and Technology (EA) and Connecticut Fund for the Environment (CFE), in {{consultation}} with the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, have designed and are permitting modifications of a culvert inlet transition on the Pequonnock River to incorporate a pool and weir fish way. During low-flow periods, water depths down the existing concrete transition, which is near the intersection of Chopsey Hill Road and Glenwood Avenue in Bridgeport, Connecticut, are too shallow to allow upstream fish passage for target species (American <b>shad,</b> <b>blueback</b> herring, and alewife). The pool and weir sections were designed to improve fish passage during the upstream migration season (1 April 31 July) over a 5 - 178 cfs with a maximum velocity of 5 ft/sec and minimum water depth of 8 in. EA designed a multi-tiered weir able to provide different depths at different flow regimes and designed the pools using the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s (USFWS) Energy Dissipation Factor(EDF) formula. The weirs were designed to provide an 8 -in. minimum depth through a low-flow notch at the minimum design flow (5 cfs) and the majority of the normal design flow (45 cfs) over the remaining weir. Depths in the low-flow notch were 14 in. at normal design flow (45 cfs) and 22 in. at maximum design flow (178 cfs). Velocities in the pools and weirs were less than 5 ft/s for all design flows. Water depths in the concrete transition adjacent to the pool and weir channel ranged from 1 in. at normal design flow up to 6 in. at maximum design flow. For the range of design flow, the EDF for the pools was less than 4. 0 ft-lbs/sec per ft 3 of pool volume, less than the USWFS standard of 4. 0 ftlbs/ sec per ft 3 maximum...|$|R
40|$|EA Engineering, Science, and Technology, Inc., the U. S. Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service, and the Woonasquatucket River Watershed Council have {{successfully}} designed, permitted, and constructed Denil fishways and eel ladders at the Rising Sun Mills and Atlantic Mills Dams, {{the first and}} third dams on the Woonasquatucket River, a federally designated American Heritage River. The Woonasquatucket River has a number of low head dams from former industrial uses that prevent passage of diadromous fish. The fish ways at these two dams, combined with the two dam removals at Paragon Mills and Dyerville Dams, thesecond and fourth dams, opened over linear miles and 150 acres of habitat to diadromous fish, including American <b>shad,</b> <b>blueback</b> herring, alewife, and American eel. Providing fish passage at these two urban river settings presented numerous engineering and permitting challenges to address historical and archaeological considerations, contaminated sediment management, and state and federal regulatory requirements. Rising Sun Mills Dam and Atlantic Mills Dam are located adjacent to capped Brownfield sites, and the Denil fishways had to be designed to maintain the integrity of the Brownfield caps. Both fish ways required modifications to the existing dam structures after installation of cofferdams to address unknown conditions. The Rising Sun Mills fish way required modification to the deteriorated timber gate for the fishway exit channel and stabilization of the timber spillwayapron for construction of the fishway entrance. The spillwayabutment at Atlantic Mills Dam was found unstable and had to be replaced with a new concrete abutment between the spillway and the fishway exit channel. Both projects included design and installation of eel fish ways subsequent to completion of the Denil fishways. Solar panels were used to operate the attraction water pumps since there were no nearby power sources...|$|R
40|$|EA Engineering, Science, and Technology, the U. S. Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service, and the Woonasquatucket River Watershed Council have {{successfully}} designed, permitted, and removed Dyerville and Paragon Mills Dams, {{the second and}} fourth dams on the Woonasquatucket River, a federally designated American Heritage River. The Woonasquatucket River {{has a number of}} low head dams from former industrial uses that prevent passage of diadromous fish. Removal of these two dams, combined with the two fishways at Rising Sun Mills and Atlantic Mills Dams, the first and third dams, opened over 6 linear miles and 150 acres of habitat to diadromous fish, including American <b>shad,</b> <b>blueback</b> herring, alewife, and American eel. Providing fish passage at these two urban river settings presented numerous engineering and permitting challenges to address contaminated sediment management and state and federal regulatory requirements. Environmental investigations and engineering assessments were performed at each dam to address impacts on wetlands along the river and construction access issues. The assessments included hydraulic and hydrologic modeling; 30, 60 and 100 percent engineering designs; and local, state, and federal permitting applications. Contaminated sediment was found at Paragon Mills Dam, and the partial dam breach was designed to pass flood flow while maximizing the quantity of material that was stabilized in situ within the head pond. Cofferdam installation and control of water during dam removal and limited construction access between the mill buildings were the major challenges at Paragon Mills Dam. Dyerville Dam was a deteriorated timber crib dam with limited access through the Groden Center parking lot. Simple construction techniques were employed to minimize turbidity in the river and disturbance to the adjacent property and parking lot use during removal...|$|R
40|$|The Santee Cooper Basin in South Carolina has {{historically}} been an important focal point for anadromous fish restoration since the 1970 s. The development of the St Stephens fish lift at the the Corps of Engineers dam re-established potential migration routes to inland waters {{and continues to be}} a primary interest in restoring stocks of American <b>shad,</b> <b>blueback</b> herring and sturgeon species. In 2001 the Santee Cooper Basin Diadromous Fish Restoration Plan (Plan) introduced more detailed resource management objectives to restore species to historical levels. As FERC licensed projects entered into relicensing efforts, various approaches have been undertaken to address the sensitive issue of fish passage at hydropower projects. From a consultant 2 ̆ 7 s perspective, frequently and often rightly so Licensee 2 ̆ 7 s question the need to implement fish passage when the 2 ̆ 2 science 2 ̆ 2 is lacking to support huge capital investments in projects operating on marginal economics. Alternatively, resource agencies responsible for developing Section 18 fish way prescriptions are tasked with developing mandatory conditions during the relicensing proceedings and within the allotted regulatory timelines. These two polarizing views can and typically do lead to significant delays in implementation of fish ways, minimum flows or other enhancements that benefit the project resources. However, in recent cases within the Santee Basin, fish restoration has been dealt with successfully via tow entirely different mechanisms; one through actual fish way construction and one through deferment of passage implementation by in turn supporting a biological program that included the potential for earl implementation at a neighboring project. In both cases, fish restoration remained the primary objectives with significant consideration given to project related concerns expressed by the Licensee. This presentation will explore fish restoration alternatives that can be accomplished through developing solid working relationships, incorporating sound biological data in decision making and giving projects economics due consideration...|$|R
40|$|A {{federal and}} multi-state {{cooperative}} program to restore American shad Alosa sapidissima and Atlantic salmon Salmo salar to the Connecticut River basin was begun in 1967 and has evolved to include many other species. The program {{began in the}} last years of the Connecticut River Ecological Study, but most of its activities have occurred since the study ended. The Connecticut River Atlantic Salmon Commission manages the program. Emphasis has been placed on the provision of fish passage at barrier dams. Early fishways were justified on the basis of existing American shad runs, and later upriver fishways were built to support future salmon runs. Fishways existed at five mainstem dams and eight tributary dams, with facilities for downstream fish passage provided at many additional dams. Salmon restoration has been pursued with stocking of hatchery-reared fry and smolts, catch prohibitions, kelt reconditioning, fish health management, and various genetic management and marking schemes. Annual runs typically have numbered in the hundreds but recently have declined to less than 100 at the same time runs elsewhere through the species 2 ̆ 7 range have also declined. Annual runs of American <b>shad,</b> <b>blueback</b> herring A. aestivalis, and alewife A. pseudoharengus increased but recently experienced declines, for which stock recovery of the striped bass Morone saxatilis is thought to be at least partially responsible. Gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum and hickory shad A. mediocris experienced significant range extensions in the Connecticut River basin since the 1990 s, and the number of nonspawning striped bass that enter the river annually has increased dramatically during the same time period. Brief reviews of the status in the Connecticut River basin of these anadromous species as well as of the shortnose sturgeon Acipenser brevirostrum, Atlantic sturgeon A. oxyrinchus, white perch Morone americana, rainbow smelt Asmerus mordax, sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus, and sea-run brown trout Salmo trutta and the catadromous American eel Anguilla rostrata are provided...|$|R
40|$|This report {{provides}} information about barriers and fish passage {{in relation to}} the range of migratory fishes in the Connecticut River watershed. The data presented are available {{here for the first time}} in a single compilation. Maps are used to graphically display barrier and range data. These data were collected and processed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service 2 ̆ 7 s Connecticut River Coordinator 2 ̆ 7 s Office with support from the Connecticut River Ecosystem Initiative of the National Biological Service (now the Biological Resources Division of the U. S. Geological Survey). Eleven State fisheries biologists responsible for anadromous fish management in the Connecticut River watershed (see Acknowledgements) were interviewed. Biologists reviewed maps (1 : 24, 000 scale) of dams in the National Inventory of Dams (NID) Water Control Infrastructure Database (1993 - 1994, Federal Emergency Management Agency and Army Corps of Engineers) and undocumented barriers previously identified at 1 : 100, 000 scale. The biologists provided locations and physical descriptions of barriers that are not included in the NID database, edited existing data on non-dam barriers, and corrected the locations of dams in the NID database. (The recently published 1995 - 1996 NID update was subsequently incorporated into the database.) Additionally, barriers within the historical range of anadromous fishes were qualitatively assessed for their obstructive impacts on the migration of the following species: Atlantic salmon, American <b>shad,</b> gizzard <b>shad,</b> <b>blueback</b> herring, alewife, sea lamprey, and American eel. The barrier locations and data were entered into a spatial database at 1 : 24, 000 scale. It is important to emphasize that, in cases where quantitative data were unavailable, the data presented are based on the professional opinion of the biologists. Also, additional barriers likely exist that are not included herein due to lack of detailed field surveys. This is especially true for smaller streams. The passage status of some barriers for some species is unknown...|$|R
