25|$|There {{were three}} modules to Jet. One was the Native Jet ISAM Driver, a Jet {{dynamic link library}} (DLL) that could {{directly}} manipulate Microsoft Access database files (MDB), which was a modified form of an Indexed Sequential Access Method (ISAM) database. Another one of the modules were the ISAM Drivers, DLLs that allowed access to ISAM databases, among them being Xbase, Paradox, Btrieve and FoxPro files. The final module was the Data Access Objects (DAO) DLL, DAO allowed programmers access to the Jet engine. It was basically an object-oriented data language used by Access Basic and Visual <b>Basic</b> <b>application</b> developers to access Jet.|$|E
2500|$|In 1996, thirty-nine {{countries}} {{signed the}} Wassenaar Arrangement, an arms control treaty {{that deals with}} the export of arms and [...] "dual-use" [...] technologies such as cryptography. The treaty stipulated {{that the use of}} cryptography with short key-lengths (56-bit for symmetric encryption, 512-bit for RSA) would no longer be export-controlled. Cryptography exports from the US became less strictly regulated as a consequence of a major relaxation in 2000; there are no longer very many restrictions on key sizes in US-exported mass-market software. Since this relaxation in US export restrictions, and because most personal computers connected to the Internet include US-sourced web browsers such as Firefox or Internet Explorer, almost every Internet user worldwide has potential access to quality cryptography via their browsers (e.g., via Transport Layer Security). The Mozilla Thunderbird and Microsoft Outlook E-mail client programs similarly can transmit and receive emails via TLS, and can send and receive email encrypted with S/MIME. Many Internet users don't realize that their <b>basic</b> <b>application</b> software contains such extensive cryptosystems. These browsers and email programs are so ubiquitous that even governments whose intent is to regulate civilian use of cryptography generally don't find it practical to do much to control distribution or use of cryptography of this quality, so even when such laws are in force, actual enforcement is often effectively impossible.|$|E

50|$|One {{disadvantage}} of the Madrid {{system is that}} any refusal, withdrawal or cancellation of the <b>basic</b> <b>application</b> or basic registration within five years of the registration date of the international registration {{will lead to the}} refusal, withdrawal or cancellation of the international registration to the same extent. For example, if a <b>basic</b> <b>application</b> covers 'clothing, headgear and footwear,' and 'headgear' is then deleted from the <b>basic</b> <b>application</b> (for whatever reason), 'headgear' will also be deleted from the international application. Therefore, the protection afforded by the international registration in each designated member jurisdiction will only extend to 'clothing and footwear.' If the <b>basic</b> <b>application</b> is rejected as a whole, the international registration would also be totally refused.|$|E
