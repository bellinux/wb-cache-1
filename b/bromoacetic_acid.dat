50|$|Iodide is a {{naturally}} occurring ion {{that can be}} found in many source waters and it is easily oxidized by wastewater disinfectants. One of the products of iodide oxidation is hypoiodous acid (HOI or OI−) which is capable of reacting with background organic materials to generate iodinated disinfection by-products (DBPs) including iodoacetic acid. In a study performed by Plewa, et al., IAA was determined {{to be one of the}} most cytotoxic of those studied, with a median lethal dose on the order of magnitude of 10−5 M. It was the most genotoxic of more than 60 DBPs studied and is the most genotoxic DBP identified thus far. Iodoacetic acid has exhibited traits indicating it as a potential carcinogen, however, it has not been proven to be carcinogenic. The trend continues in teratogenicity, with iodoacetic acid’s potency surpassing that of its brominated and chlorinated analogs. Its toxicity correlates to its ability as an alkylating agent, which will modify cysteine residues in proteins. Monohaloacetic acids are the most toxic, with toxicity increasing with halogen size.

40|$|Chlorination is used {{to prevent}} the spread of {{waterborne}} infectious diseases from swimming pools. This required disinfection practice also results in the formation of undesirable disinfection by-products (DBPs) from the reactions of chlorine with the organic matter (released by swimmers or present in the filling water of the pool) and bromide.

Unfortunately, DBPs formation and control in swimming pools have not been studied and investigated to the same extent as their formation and control in drinking water.

40|$|Abstract: A simple, {{versatile}} {{method for}} {{the synthesis of}} Peptide Nucleic Acids (PNA) from readily available building blocks has been developed. The approach is based on submonomer solid phase synthesis and allows for the structural variation of both the backbone and the nucleobase idechain. The efficiency of the method was demonstrated by the synthesis of PNA oligomers in high purity and good yields. Peptide Nucleic Acids (PNA), oligonucleotide analogs with an achiral { oligo-N-(2 -aminoethylglycine) } backbone, {{have been shown to}} specifically recognize the complementary sequence of oligonucleotide oligomers. 1 Moreover, PNA/oligonucleotide hybrids are thermally more stable than the corresponding DNA (or RNA) hybrids, 2 and they should possess increased biological stability. 3 Therefore, PNA molecules have potential for the development of gene-targeting pharmaceuticals nd as antagonists for proteins that recognize DNA. 4 In this communication, we describe a simple and highly versatile method for the synthesis of PNA oligomers. Using a "submonomer " approach, 5 PNA molecules were synthesized on polystyrene r sin from inexpensive precursors like <b>bromoacetic</b> <b>acid,</b> a protected ethylenediamine (e. g., 4 -methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl (Moz) - ethylenediamine), and a nucleobase derivative (e. g., 1 -carboxymethyl-thymine; 6 Scheme 1).

CMDs with differing degrees of carboxymethyl substitution were synthesized by the reaction of dextran with <b>bromoacetic</b> <b>acid</b> under different reactant ratios. Substantial amounts of protein adsorption onto these coatings were observed with the majority of the coating/protein combinations. On the most extensively substituted CMD (1 carboxyl group per 2 dextran units), lysozyme and lactoferrin adsorbed to approximately monolayer amounts whereas there was minimal adsorption of HSA, indicating the importance of electrostatic interfacial interactions. CMD 1 : 14 was similar whereas the least substituted, least dense coating, from CMD 1 : 30, adsorbed less lysozyme and lactoferrin but more HSA. Adsorption of the large multidomain protein IgG varied little with the coating. Grazing angle XPS data indicated that for the CMD 1 : 30 coating there occurred significant in-diffusion of the lower molecular weight proteins. The data suggest that elimination of adsorption of a broad spectrum of proteins is not straightforward with negatively charged polysaccharide coatings; elimination of protein accumulation onto/into such coatings may not be achievable solely with a balance of electrostatic and steric-entropic interfacial forces...|$|E

In a previous study, the authors' group has detected the presence of many brominated DBPs and identified five new aromatic brominated DBPs in chlorinated saline sewage effluents. The presence of brominated DBPs in chlorinated saline effluents may pose adverse implications for marine ecology. In this study, besides the detection and identification of another seven new aromatic halogenated DBPs in a chlorinated saline sewage effluent, their developmental toxicity was evaluated using the marine polychaete Platynereis dumerilii. For comparison, the developmental toxicity of some commonly known halogenated DBPs was also examined. The rank order of the developmental toxicity of 20 halogenated DBPs was 2, 5 -dibromohydroquinone > 2, 6 -diiodo- 4 -nitrophenol >= 2, 4, 6 -triiodophenol > 4 -bromo- 2 -chlorophenol >= 4 -bromophenol > 2, 4 -dibromophenol >= 2, 6 -dibromo- 4 -nitrophenol > 2 -bromo- 4 -chlorophenol > 2, 6 -dichloro- 4 -nitrophenol > 2, 4 -dichlorophenol > 2, 4, 6 -tribromophenol > 3, 3 -dibromo- 4 -hydroxybenzaldehyde > bromoform >= 2, 4, 6 -trichlorophenol > 2, 6 -dibromophenol > 2, 6 -dichlorophenol > iodoacetic acid >= tribromoacetic acid > <b>bromoacetic</b> <b>acid</b> > chloroacetic acid.

Some of these are mutagenic, genotoidc, teratogenic, and cytotoxic, as well as potentially carcinogenic both in vivo and in vitro.

We focused particularly on cytotoxidty and induction of two adaptive stress response pathways: the oxidative stress responsive Nrf 2 /ARE and DNA-damage responsive p 53 pathways. All five DBPs were cytotoidc to the Caco- 2 cell line after a 4 h exposure, and all DBPs induced both of the adaptive stress response pathways, Nrf 2 /ARE and p 53, in the micromolar range, as measured by two beta-lactamase-based reporter gene assays. The decreasing order of potency for all three endpoints for the five DBPs was IAA similar to BAA > DCBQ similar to DBBQ > CAA. Induction of oxidative stress was previously proposed to be the molecular initiating event (MIE) for both classes of DBPs. However, comparing the levels of activation of the two pathways uncovered that the Nrf 2 /ARE pathway was the more sensitive endpoint for HAAs, whereas the p 53 pathway was more sensitive in the case of HBQs. Therefore, the DNA damage-responsive p 53 pathway may be an important piece of information to fill in a gap in the adverse outcome pathway framework for the assessment of HBQs. Finally, we cautiously compared the potential risk of the two novel HBQs using a benchmarking approach to that of the well-studied CAA, which suggested that their relative risk may be lower than that of BAA and IAA...|$|E
