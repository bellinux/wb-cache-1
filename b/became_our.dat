[...] "Naturally, he immediately became an example for young national composers and a hero in Armenia," [...] suggests Maya Pritsker. Khachaturian's influence can be traced in nearly all trends of Armenian classical music traditions (symphonic and chamber), including on Arno Babajanian, a significant Armenian composer of the late Soviet period. His unique symphonic interpretation has influenced Edvard Mirzoyan, Konstantin Orbelyan and others. Khachaturian is credited for bringing Armenian music recognized worldwide. Poet Hamo Sahyan said about Khachaturian: [...] "He became the big denial of our myth of smallness, [...] became the symbol of measuring our small people with the great ones... <b>became</b> <b>our</b> certificate of civilization." ...|$|E

500|$|The 1880s were a {{difficult}} time for the remaining Dickinsons. Irreconcilably alienated from his wife, Austin fell in love in 1882 with Mabel Loomis Todd, an Amherst College faculty wife who had recently moved to the area. Todd never met Dickinson but was intrigued by her, referring to her as [...] "a lady whom the people call the Myth". Austin distanced himself from his family as his affair continued and his wife became sick with grief. Dickinson's mother died on November 14, 1882. Five weeks later, Dickinson wrote [...] "We were never intimate ... while she was our Mother– but Mines in the same Ground meet by tunneling and when she <b>became</b> <b>our</b> Child, the Affection came." [...] The next year, Austin and Sue's third and youngest child, Gilbert—Emily's favorite—died of typhoid fever.|$|E
500|$|Roughly a {{year into}} development, the team {{discovered}} that their second producer—the first having quit Origin {{near the beginning of}} development—had left the project. Neurath later said that [...] "neither [...] had much involvement" [...] in the game, and that, following the second's departure, the team spent time without any producer at all. Rumors circulated that Origin planned to cancel the project. Following a proposal by the team around this time, Spector, who had previously worked with Neurath on Space Rogue, assumed the role of producer. Church later described this event as [...] "a big win for everyone". Spector began to interact regularly with the team by phone and to visit the studio in person. Neurath later said, [...] "Warren understood immediately {{what we were trying to}} accomplish with the game, and <b>became</b> <b>our</b> biggest champion within Origin. Had not Warren stepped in this role at that stage, I'm not sure Ultima Underworld would have ever seen the light of day." [...] Church said that Spector helped the team polish the game and [...] "make it real", and that Spector's past experience in the industry enabled him to keep the team focused on completing the game. He explained that Spector [...] "had that ability to help me and the rest of the guys reset, from the big-picture view of someone who has done it before." ...|$|E

A story about Lewis in The Hollywood Reporter in June 2001 included a joint statement by the Weinstein Brothers: [...] "Back in 1982 when we were starting Miramax Films, Martin Lewis was the producer of what <b>became</b> <b>our</b> first hit movie - The Secret Policeman's Other Ball starring the Monty Pythons.

It nearly never got recorded - when the time came to record it, the keyboard player I wanted to use, Peter Jones, was out of town, so we cut the band track with a different keyboard player. It didn't work. A few days later when we tried it again with a different keyboard player, again it didn't work, and the band was losing interest in the song. Just before the album was finished, Peter Jones came back into town, the band and I had an argument because I wanted to give Reminiscing a third chance. Peter played on it, we cut it, and finished it, and sent the album to Capitol. Capitol said that they couldn't hear any singles on the album, and didn't know what to release. Five weeks later, someone at Capitol's New York office said 'You're all crazy, Reminiscing is a smash.' Capitol put it out, and it just immediately caught on fire, and <b>became</b> <b>our</b> highest chart hit." ...|$|E

2500|$|As this {{original}} eschatological fervor {{began to}} die down, and as Christianity became an increasingly Gentile movement, this original eschatological {{orientation of the}} Christian Passover celebration was lost; and {{with the development of}} the practice of baptizing catechumens during the twelve readings so they would share the Eucharist {{for the first time with}} the Christian community at the conclusion of the Paschal Vigil, the baptismal themes came to dominate the celebrations of the Paschal Vigil, as they do again in those churches which have begun again to baptize its adult converts during the Easter Vigil. [...] Major liturgical scholars such as Louis Bouyer and Alexander Schmemann concur with Jeremias' essential position and one has only to examine the Christian liturgical texts for Paschal Vigil to see evidence of this. E.g., the Eucharistic Preface for the Easter Vigil in the Roman, Lutheran and Anglican/Episcopalian traditions, which state: [...] "...on this night when Christ <b>became</b> <b>our</b> Passover sacrifice" [...] or the Eastern Orthodox Troparion for Great and Holy Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, which warns the Christian community [...] "Behold the Bridegroom comes in the middle of the night and blessed are those servants he shall find awake..." [...] In short, no one knows when Christ will appear at the end of time, but given other central events of redemption which occurred during Passover, the earliest Christians assumed that Christ would probably appear during the Paschal Eucharist, just as he first appeared to his original disciples during their meal on the first Easter Sunday.|$|E

"Omichund, his {{confidential}} servant, as he thought, {{told his}} master {{of an agreement}} made between the English and Monsieur Duprée [...] to attack him, and received for that advice a sum of not less than four lacks of rupees. Finding {{this to be the}} man in whom the nawab entirely trusted, it soon <b>became</b> <b>our</b> object to consider him as a most material engine in the intended revolution. We therefore made such an agreement as was necessary for the purpose, and entered into a treaty with him to satisfy his demands. When all things were prepared, and the evening of the event was appointed, Omichund informed Mr. Watts, who was at the court of the nawab, that he insisted upon thirty lacks of rupees, and five per cent. upon all the treasure that should be found; that, unless that was immediately complied with, he would disclose the whole to the nawab; and that Mr. Watts, and the two other English gentlemen then at the court, should be cut off before the morning. Mr. Watts, immediately on this information, dispatched an express to me at the council. I did not hesitate to find out a stratagem to save the lives of these people, and secure success to the intended event. For this purpose we signed another treaty. The one was called the Red, the other the White treaty. This treaty was signed by every one, except admiral Watson; and I should have considered myself sufficiently authorised to put his name to it, by the conversation I had with him. As to the person who signed admiral Watson's name to the treaty, whether he did it in his presence or not, I cannot say; but this I know, that he thought he had sufficient authority for so doing. This treaty was immediately sent to Omichund, who did not suspect the stratagem. The event took place, and success attended it; and the House, I am fully persuaded, will agree with me, that, when the very existence of the Company was at stake, and the lives of these people so precariously situated, and so certain of being destroyed, {{it was a matter of}} true policy and of justice to deceive so great a villain." ...|$|E
