5|$|Logging {{was a large}} {{industry}} in the watershed of Hammersley Fork in the early 1900s, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>have</b> been almost no industrial activities in the area since then. An old railroad grade is located on Hammersley Fork. Fish have been stocked in the stream since the 1930s or 1940s.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{functions}} of the goalie position have changed little over the last century, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>have</b> been changes affecting the style of play. In the 1940s, Hungary introduced a new technique called the eggbeater kick that enables goalkeepers to maintain a stable balance in the water.|$|E
5|$|The {{endangered}} {{green turtle}} (Chelonia mydas) nests {{on the beaches}} of Caroline Island, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>have</b> been reports of poaching by recent homesteaders. The bristle-thighed curlew (Numenius tahitiensis), a migrant visitor from Alaska, is also classified as vulnerable.|$|E

5|$|Wild {{killer whales}} are not {{considered}} a threat to humans, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>have</b> been cases of captive orcas killing or injuring their handlers at marine theme parks. Killer whales feature strongly in the mythologies of indigenous cultures, with their reputation ranging from being the souls of humans to merciless killers.|$|E
5|$|It has {{parallel}} wing bars on {{the half}} of the wings connected near the white patch giving it a distinctive appearance in flight. The black central rectrices and typical white lateral rectrices are also noticeable in flight. The iris is usually a light green-yellow or a yellow, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>have</b> been instances of an orange color. The bill is black with a brownish black appearance at the base. The juvenile appearance is marked by its streaks on its back, distinguished spots and streaks on its chest, and a gray or grayish-green iris.|$|E
5|$|Official scorers {{are only}} {{occasionally}} terminated, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>have</b> been cases when a scorer was replaced after making decisions which displeased the home team. In 1992 the Seattle Mariner players signed {{a petition to}} have their official scorer replaced, and in 2001 {{the management of the}} Boston Red Sox ordered that a rookie scorer not be allowed to score another game after pitcher Hideo Nomo lost a no-hitter on a close play in right field that was ruled a hit rather than an error.|$|E

5|$|The dusky woodswallow is {{medium-sized}} and swallow-like, with a {{dark brown}} hue, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>have</b> been instances where the bird has appeared grey. The birds have a black patch {{in front of the}} eyes, and grey (sometimes also black) wings with white streaks on them. The dusky woodswallow has a black, white-tipped tail with a silver underwing. The birds have a blue-grey bill capped with black.|$|E
5|$|Whales in the Great Salt Lake: Local legend {{maintains}} that in 1875, entrepreneur James Wickham had two whales {{released into the}} Great Salt Lake, {{with the intent of}} using them as a tourist attraction. The whales are said to have disappeared into the lake and subsequently sighted multiple times over a number of months, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>have</b> never been any confirmed sightings of the whales since the time of their supposed release.|$|E
5|$|Amplexus {{between the}} male and female occurs mainly in water, but {{sometimes}} at substantial distances away on dry land. Observations of breeding sites have shown the males linger around the courting area for much longer times, while females mostly stay at other places to find food before meeting the males there. During amplexus, the males grab the females near their armpits after climbing on their backs. In the wild, amplexus usually takes between 10 minutes and five days. Artificially induced amplexus in the laboratory has been observed to last 50 hours, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>have</b> been reports of five days. Sometimes, amplexus will not result in eggs being laid.|$|E

5|$|Puffins {{have been}} hunted by man since time immemorial. Coastal {{communities}} and island dwellers with few natural resources at their disposal, made {{good use of}} the seafoods that they found on their cliffs and shores. Puffins were caught and eaten fresh, salted in brine or smoked and dried. Their feathers were used in bedding and their eggs were eaten, {{but not to the}} same extent as those of some other seabirds, being more difficult to extract from the nest. In most countries, Atlantic puffins are now protected by legislation, and in the countries where hunting is still permitted, strict laws prevent over-exploitation. They are still caught and eaten in Iceland and the Faroe Islands, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>have</b> been calls for an outright ban on hunting them in Iceland because of concern over the dwindling number of birds successfully raising chicks.|$|E
5|$|The Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) {{restricts the}} use of Highway 82 through the pass. Most {{significant}} is the winter closure. The road is typically closed after the first significant winter snowfall, or by November 7 at the latest (<b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>have</b> been exceptions.). CDOT tries to reopen just before Memorial Day weekend in late May, the traditional beginning of summer in the United States, when enough of the accumulated snowpack has melted {{to make it possible}} to clear and repair the road. Some years, after light winters, the pass has reopened as early as May 12. Two gates, just east of Aspen on the west end and west of the remaining buildings of the stage stop of Everett on the east, prevent motor vehicles from passage. When the road is closed, Aspen is isolated from the east and Highway 82 up the valley from Glenwood Springs becomes the only vehicular access to the city during its busy ski season.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{tree sparrow}} is {{widespread}} in the towns and cities of eastern Asia, but in Europe it is a bird of lightly wooded open countryside, with the house sparrow breeding in the more urban areas. The Eurasian tree sparrow's extensive range and large population ensure {{that it is not}} endangered globally, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>have</b> been large declines in western European populations, in part due to changes in farming practices involving increased use of herbicides and loss of winter stubble fields. In eastern Asia and western Australia, this species is sometimes viewed as a pest, although it is also widely celebrated in oriental art.|$|E

5|$|The common {{blackbird}} has {{an extensive}} range, estimated at 10millionsquare kilometres (3.8million square miles), {{and a large}} population, including an estimated 79 to 160 million individuals in Europe alone. The species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and is therefore evaluated as Least Concern. In the western Palaearctic, populations are generally stable or increasing, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>have</b> been local declines, especially on farmland, which {{may be due to}} agricultural policies that encouraged farmers to remove hedgerows (which provide nesting places), and to drain damp grassland and increase the use of pesticides, both of which could have reduced the availability of invertebrate food.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{faith in}} Rwanda is Roman Catholicism, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>have</b> been {{significant}} changes in the nation's religious demographics since the genocide, with many conversions to Protestantism, especially its Evangelical wing, and, to a lesser degree, Islam. According to the 2012 census, Roman Catholics represented 43.7% of the population, Protestants (excluding Seventh-day Adventists) 37.7%, Seventh-day Adventists 11.8%, and Muslims 2.0%; 0.2% claimed no religious beliefs and 1.3% did not state a religion. Traditional religion, despite officially being followed by only 0.1% of the population, retains an influence. Many Rwandans view the Christian God as synonymous with the traditional Rwandan God Imana.|$|E
5|$|Copper toxicosis, {{also known}} as copper storage disease and copper {{overload}} syndrome, is an autosomal recessive disease that is characterized by an accumulation of copper in the liver. It {{is closely related to}} Wilson's disease in humans. Bedlington Terriers are more prone to copper toxicosis than most other dog breeds. West Highland White Terriers, Skye Terriers, and Doberman Pinschers are also prone to copper storage disease. Bedlington Terriers are the only breed of dog in which haemolysis has been reported, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>have</b> been no reports of neurological involvement in any dog breed. Studies have shown that in Bedlingtons, the disease is caused by a defective metallothionein that causes cell lysosomes to become saturated with copper. This causes the cell to store copper in the nucleus. There are three varieties of the disease: the Asymptomatic Form occurs when copper accumulates but there are no clinical symptoms of the disorder; the Fulminating Form which is seen mostly in young dogs, causes death in two to three days, and is thought to be caused by stress; and the Chronic Form, which is characterized by {{an extended period of time}} in which liver disease slowly causes the death of the dog. Bedlingtons also have a tendency to accumulate iron in the liver, but not nearly to the extent that they accumulate copper.|$|E

5|$|In {{the case}} of a gallant and daring act being {{performed}} by a squadron, ship's company or a detached body of men (such as marines) in which all men are deemed equally brave and deserving of the Victoria Cross then a ballot is drawn. The officers select one officer, the NCOs select one individual and the private soldiers or seamen select two individuals. In all 46 awards have been awarded by ballot with 29 of the awards during the Indian Mutiny. Four further awards were granted to Q Battery, Royal Horse Artillery at Korn Spruit on 31 March 1900 during the Second Boer War. The final ballot awards for the army were the six awards to the Lancashire Fusiliers at W Beach during the landing at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915 although three of the awards were not gazetted until 1917. The final seven ballot awards were the only naval ballot awards with three awards to two Q-Ships in 1917 and four awards for the Zeebrugge Raid in 1918. The provision for awards by ballot is still included in the Victoria Cross warrant <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>have</b> been no further such awards since 1918.|$|E
5|$|No major {{alterations}} {{have been}} made since the Reformation in the 1530s and 1540s, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>have</b> been many changes to the interior to accommodate various phases of Church of England worship. Among these are an oven used for baking communion bread in the south east corner of the north chapel. During the Civil War, considerable damage was done including the destruction of {{nearly all of the}} medieval stained glass. William III of England worshipped in the church following his landing in the Glorious Revolution of 1689. By the early 19th century, all the medieval furnishings, except the Norman font had disappeared. New pews were made and the west galleries were added in 1808-11. The latest restoration that has left the church interior visible today, took place in the late 19th century; it was more sympathetic to the church's architectural character than many Victorian restorations. At this time, the central section of the west gallery was removed to reveal the great west window and the organ was relocated to the south transept. The pews date from around 1900 and have attractive carved bench-ends. The church has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building.|$|E
