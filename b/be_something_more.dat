He nominates her, but the Senate rejects her after a rocky hearing. Frank gives her the job anyway in a recess appointment, but her tenure is brief; she ruins a treaty between the U.S. and Russia by publicly confronting Russian President Viktor Petrov (Lars Mikkelsen) about his anti-gay policies and is forced to resign when Petrov uses her as a bargaining chip during a diplomatic crisis.|$|E
500|$|Technologically, the Covenant are {{described}} in [...] and [...] to be imitative rather than innovative—most of the Covenant's sophisticated weaponry and propulsion systems are based on Forerunner artifacts, rather than the Covenant's own research. Covenant weapons are generally based on Forerunner technology and utilize plasma. These weapons are built around a battery that generates plasma and discharges it at a target. Frank O'Connor, Bungie's former public relations head, hinted that there may <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> to the Covenant's weaponry, saying [...] "the actual technology is not plasma as we know it, but something far more dangerous, arcane, and destructive." [...] A few of the Covenant's weapons are not plasma-based, including the Needler, which fires razor-sharp pink needles capable of [...] "homing in" [...] on organic foes and exploding. A weapons expert noted parallels between the Needler and ancient Greek Amazons painting their daggers pink as a psychological weapon in an issue of gaming magazine Electronic Gaming Monthly.|$|E

500|$|O'Hara {{was offered}} roles in The Razor's Edge (1946), which went to Tierney, John Wayne's film Tycoon (1947), which went to Laraine Day, and Bob Hope's The Paleface, which went to Jane Russell. She {{turned down the}} role in The Paleface as she {{was going through a}} {{turbulent}} period in her personal life and [...] "didn't think I would be able to laugh every day and have fun". She later deeply regretted turning it down and confessed that she'd made a [...] "terrible mistake". In 1947, O'Hara starred opposite Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as Shireen in the adventure film Sinbad the Sailor. O'Hara plays a glamorous adventuress who assists Sinbad (Fairbanks) locate the hidden treasure of Alexander the Great. She found the scenario to be [...] "ridiculous", but stated that it made a [...] "pot of money for RKO– action-adventures almost always did". Malone wrote: [...] "O'Hara looks splendid and gets to wear some of the most stunning costumes of her career—a different one in almost every scene—but her dialogue is floridly empty. She exudes potential in early scenes, where her air of sybaritic slyness seems promise she'll <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> than window dressing", but thought the film [...] "totally lacked drama". The critic from The New York Times thought that O'Hara excessive costume changes made watching her an [...] "exhausting" [...] experience".|$|E
500|$|A {{common law}} rule from Great Britain permits {{searches}} incident to an arrest without a warrant. This rule {{has been applied}} in American law, and has a lengthy common law history. The justification for such a search is to prevent the arrested individual 1.) from destroying evidence or 2.) using a weapon against the arresting officer by disarming the suspect. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that [...] "both justifications for the search-incident-to-arrest exception are absent and the rule does not apply", when [...] "there is no possibility" [...] that the suspect could gain access to a weapon or destroy evidence. In Trupiano v. United States (1948), the Supreme Court held that [...] "a search or seizure without a warrant as an incident to a lawful arrest has always been {{considered to be a}} strictly limited right. It grows out of the inherent necessities of the situation {{at the time of the}} arrest. But there must <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> in the way of necessity than merely a lawful arrest." [...] In United States v. Rabinowitz (1950), the Court reversed Trupiano, holding instead that the officers' opportunity to obtain a warrant was not germane to the reasonableness of a search incident to an arrest. Rabinowitz suggested that any area within the [...] "immediate control" [...] of the arrestee could be searched, but it did not define the term. In deciding Chimel v. California (1969), the Supreme Court elucidated its previous decisions. It held that when an arrest is made, it is reasonable for the officer to search the arrestee for weapons and evidence. However, in Riley v. California (2014), the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that police must obtain a warrant to search an arrestee's cellular phone. The Court said that earlier Supreme Court decisions permitting searches incident to an arrest without a warrant do not apply to [...] "modern cellphones, which are now such a pervasive and insistent part of daily life that the proverbial visitor from Mars might conclude they were an important feature of human anatomy," [...] and noted that US citizens' cellphones today typically contain [...] "a digital record of nearly every aspect of their lives — from the mundane to the intimate." ...|$|E

According to Koshiro: [...] "For Bare Knuckle I used the PC88 and an original programming language I developed myself. The original was called MML, Music Macro Language. It {{is based on}} NEC's BASIC program, but I modified it heavily. It was more a BASIC-style language at first, but I modified it to <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> like Assembly.

2500|$|Arfwedson told Allison Jones (Inside Soap) {{that she}} had fun working on the storyline with Anderson and Fraser. She {{explained}} that her character wants to see where her relationship with Seb could go. She views him as [...] "articluate, good-looking and clever". But as she spends more time in his company she finds him controlling and selfish and makes the relationship more about him. Oliver does not seem a good match for Zosia in theory. He is [...] "miserable" [...] and [...] "has a lot of baggage" [...] {{following the death of}} his wife Tara Lo (Jing Lusi). But they share a good working relationship and she [...] "gets a thrill out of their banter". The actress added [...] "they are so harmonious on the wards that eventually, they might start to realise there could <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> to it." [...] Arfwedsen was glad to receive the storyline because she wanted Zosia to find love and move on from her troubles with a [...] "positive figure within the hospital". Ultimately it would help her excel in her medical speciality.|$|E

As an appointee to the committee on Civil and Political Functions, she urged the assemblage to petition their state legislatures for the right of suffrage, the right of married women to hold property, and as many other specific rights as they felt practical to seek in their respective states. Then she gave a brief speech, saying, [...] "We want to <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> than the appendages of Society; we want that Woman should be the coequal and help-meet of Man in all the interest and perils and enjoyments of human life. We want that she should attain {{to the development of}} her nature and womanhood; we want that when she dies, it may not be written on her gravestone that she was the [...] "" [...] of somebody." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kardashian {{appeared}} on the cover, and in a pictorial in Papers winter issue in 2014 photographed by Jean-Paul Goude. On the cover, her nude buttocks are featured above the caption: [...] "Break the Internet", which generated considerable comment in both social and traditional media. The photos show Kardashian with her hair tied up in a bun, wearing only a pearl necklace, a pair of earrings and black satin gloves, and, on the cover, with her bare back facing the camera, holding a sequined gown below her bare, oiled-up buttocks, while smiling broadly at the camera. A Time magazine writer commented that, unlike previous celebrities' nudes that represented the women's rebellion against repressed society and [...] "trying to tear down" [...] barriers, Kardashian's exhibition was [...] "just provocation and bluster, repeated images that seem to offer us some sort of truth or insight but are really just self serving. We want there to <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>more,</b> some reason or context, some great explanation that tells us {{what it is like}} to live in this very day and age, but there is not. Kim Kardashian's ass is nothing but an empty promise." [...] However, the stunt [...] "set a new benchmark" [...] in social media response, and Papers website received 15.9 million views in one day, compared with 25,000 views on an average day.|$|E
2500|$|Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph {{gave the}} film a full five stars and praised the film for its acting, screenplay, choreography, stunts, humor, and {{direction}} calling the film a [...] "spiritual sequel" [...] and an [...] "eruption of craziness." [...] Writing for The Guardian and awarding the film four stars out of five, Peter Bradshaw wrote, [...] "Extravagantly deranged, ear-splittingly cacophonous, and entirely over the top, George Miller has revived his Mad Max punk-western franchise as a bizarre convoy chase action-thriller in the post-apocalyptic desert." [...] The New York Times wrote, [...] "Miller has {{reminded us that}} blockbusters {{have the potential to}} not only be art, but radically visionary – even the fourth in a series. What a lovely day, indeed." [...] Scott Mendelson of Forbes gave the film 10 out of 10 stars and wrote, [...] "Mad Max: Fury Road is a remarkable and glorious motion picture, not just one of the great action movies of our time but also a great and timely film, period." [...] Alonso Duralde of TheWrap wrote, [...] "In {{the same way that the}} original 1979 Mad Max was the Citizen Kane of gut-bucket Australian exploitation cinema, Mad Max: Fury Road may well be the Götterdämmerung of drive-in movies. It has its roots in the Western and the post-apocalyptic road-rage action saga , where Miller dares anyone else to follow in his tire treads." [...] IGN reviewer Scott Collura gave the film 9.2 out of 10, saying: [...] "The over-the-top stunts and eccentric characters and designs are all hugely important to Fury Road, ... but it's the overriding sense of the film's uniqueness, its striving to <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> than just another action movie, that is most impressive." ...|$|E
