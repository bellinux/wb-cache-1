Previous work showed that the hoop stresses resulting from tight interference fits can reduce bearing lives {{by as much as}} 65 percent. Where tight interference fits are required, case-carburized steel such as AISI 9310 or M 50 NiL is often used because the compressive residual stresses inhibit subsurface crack formation and the ductile core inhibits inner-ring fracture. The presence of compressive residual stress and its combination with hoop stress also modifies the Hertz stress-life relation. This paper analyzes the beneficial effect of residual stresses on rolling-element bearing fatigue life in the presence of high hoop stresses for three bearing steels. These additional stresses were superimposed on Hertzian principal stresses to calculate the inner-race maximum shearing stress and the resulting fatigue life of the bearing. The load-life exponent p and Hertz stress-life exponent n increase in the presence of compressive residual stress, which yields increased life, particularly at lower stress levels. The Zaretsky life equation is described and is shown to predict longer bearing lives and greater load- and stress-life exponents, which better predicts observed life of bearings made from vacuum-processed steel...|$|R

40|$|An {{earlier study}} showed that EHD films could be {{accurately}} measured in a running bearing and that the EHD film eventually runs-in to a steady state value [1]. In the present paper, we report on additional tests conducted on bearings with more lubricants, wider speeds, and higher temperatures. The new results consistently show that all lubricants tested, including MAC-based lubricants have EHD film levels that are lower than model predictions in some situations. In addition, the MAC lubricants studied have lower film thickness than traditional hydrocarbons. Figure 1 is taken from [1] and shows room temperature data of MAC oil and Corey 100 oil, illustrating the smaller EHD film results when using this MAC oil. Since higher temperatures produce lower films by changing the viscosity, the concern {{we have is that}} the EHD films may be too small to prevent ball/race metal contact and resulting wear at lower speeds. Best bearing practices would have the EHD film thickness be at least three (3) times the composite surface roughness.

In this study, a relatively simple system, represented by a rigid, unbalanced rotor on two-lobe SFD, is theoretically investigated by means of numerical continuation. Despite being restricted to periodic solutions, this numerical procedure permits an efficient characterization of the system's bifurcating behaviour, suitably {{taking into account the}} shape parameters of the wave profile given to the bore of lobed damper bearing. In particular, the influence of the bearing angular position on the synchronous (1 -S) and order-two subharmonic solutions (1 / 2 -S) has been analyzed, assuming the rotor speed as the bifurcation parameter, under different conditions of bearing operation that are expressed by means of the bearing parameter f. The results are compared to the corresponding behaviour of the rotor on dampers with circular bearing (CB). The bifurcation structure shows to be rather influenced by both the angular position and f. With regard to the 1 -S, the two-lobe geometry emphasizes some effects obtained raising f in the presence of CB. Some other effects show to be distinctive features of the lobed geometry, like the disappearance of the torus bifurcation and the length modification (as increase or decrease) of the segments representing unstable behaviour. A significant simplification in the bifurcation paths of the 1 / 2 -S, as compared to the CB set-up, is achieved at higher f values, especially through suitable angular positions. Contrast with this outcome the relatively involved path-patterns obtained for the sub-harmonic responses at the lowest f value.

Although {{the high}} damping alloy M 2052, {{which has been}} {{developed}} 10 years go, possesses both of very high damping capacity and excellent workability, {{it has been used}} only in the field of an audio/video field. If this alloy will be produced by combining high-quality raw material and optimum manufacturing processes, the damping capacity of 0. 72 in logarithmic decrement that is near to that of rubber can be yielded. In addition, since workability is very excellent, the sizes and shapes of parts required for anti-vibration measures can be easily supplied, thus being able to satisfy to create all sorts of items necessary for the design of the measures. In this paper, we show how to use this alloy and some examples of application: a multi-axis with non-rotating grinding machine, <b>bearing</b> and <b>boring</b> machines, a surface grinder, coiled springs, and an installation mount. Many of excellent effects of damping provided by the applications such as an insert, a carpet, and a variety of new ideas to decrease a spring constant of parts suggest possibility to solve the hard problem which was not solved by rubber. Introduction: Difference between M 2052 Alloy and Rubbers When anti-vibration measures are performed by means of some materials, high-damping alloy is no...|$|R
