40|$|Abstract Background The risk of Plasmodium {{falciparum malaria}} {{increases}} during pregnancy and at early postpartum. Immunological and physiological alterations associated with pregnancy that persist after delivery {{may contribute to}} the susceptibility to P. falciparum during early postpartum period. Methods To determine changes in antibody-mediated responses after pregnancy, levels of Immunoglobulin G (IgGs) specific for P. falciparum were compared in 200 pairs of plasmas collected from Mozambican women at delivery and during the first two months postpartum. IgGs against the surface of erythrocytes infected with a P. falciparum chondroitin sulphate A <b>binding</b> <b>line</b> (CS 2) and a paediatric isolate (MOZ 2) were measured by flow cytometry. Results IgG levels against CS 2 and MOZ 2 were higher at postpartum than at delivery (p[*]=[*] 0. 033 and p[*]=[*] 0. 045, respectively) in women without P. falciparum infection. The analysis stratified by parity and period after delivery showed that this increase was significant in multi-gravid women (p[*]=[*] 0. 023 for CS 2 and p[*]=[*] 0. 054 for MOZ 2) and during the second month after delivery (p[*]=[*] 0. 018 for CS 2 and p[*]=[*] 0. 015 for MOZ 2).

The primary aim of the thesis is to identify and describe in detail the most fundamental aspects that define and influence the participation of members in particular forms of business companies, and, in the final consequence, the very nature of these entities. The main subject of this thesis is a member's relationship, which represents a <b>binding</b> <b>line</b> between a business company and partners as individuals. Through the examination of particular elements of this legal relationship including specific ways leading to its creation or termination within each type of the business company the differences in the legal status of subjects of these entities are determined. The issue of partners' legal status regulation is analysed from the perspective de lege lata, while in suitable cases the positive law is compared with the preceding legislation. The goal of such a comparison is to declare the evolution in the normative solution to a particular question.

40|$|AbstractSynaptotagmin is a {{synaptic}} vesicle {{protein that}} has been proposed to be the calcium sensor responsible for fast neurotransmitter release at synapses. Synaptotagmin's two C 2 domains, C 2 A and C 2 B, each provide a calcium <b>binding</b> pocket <b>lined</b> with negative charges contributed by five conserved aspartates. We find that even when all of C 2 A's conserved aspartates are neutralized by replacement with asparagines, neurotransmitter release still occurs at hippocampal synapses in culture. Because exocytosis continues {{to be dependent on}} extracellular calcium concentration, the C 2 A domain cannot represent the entire calcium sensor. C 2 A does appear {{to be part of the}} calcium sensor, however, because substitution of D 232 alters the calcium dependence of release, perhaps by reducing the number of calcium ions that must bind to trigger exocytosis. We conclude that neutralization of the negative charge at D 232 by coordination of a calcium ion is necessary—but not sufficient—for fast neurotransmission at mammalian CNS synapses...|$|R

Each {{of the four}} pore-forming segments of Ca 2 + channel α 1 subunits contains a glutamate residue that contributes to high-affinity Ca 2 + interactions. Replacement of all four P-region glutamates with glutamine or alanine abolished micromolar Ca 2 + block of monovalent current without revealing any additional independent high-affinity Ca 2 + binding site. Pairwise replacements of the four glutamates excluded the hypothesis that they form two independent high-affinity sites. Systematic alterations of side-chain length, charge, and polarity by glutamate replacement with aspartate, glutamine, or alanine weakened the Ca 2 + interaction, with considerable asymmetry from one repeat to another. The P-region glutamate in repeat I was unusual in its sensitivity to aspartate replacement but not glutamine substitution. While all four glutamates cooperate in supporting high-affinity interactions with single Ca 2 + ions, they also influence the interaction between multiple divalent cations...|$|R

Furthermore, H 3 K 122 ac is catalyzed by the coactivators p 300 /CBP and can be induced by nuclear hormone receptor signaling. Collectively, this suggests that transcriptional regulators elicit their effects not only via signaling to histone tails but also via direct structural perturbation of nucleosomes by directing acetylation to their lateral surface...|$|R

We present a model in which the Glu 167 from the downstream subunit of CooA helps the protein to interact with RNA polymerase, probably through an interaction between activating region 3 and σ subunit.
