60|$|Only {{one year}} elapsed between the {{publication}} of the 'Descent of Man' and that of its next important successor, the 'Expression of the Emotions.' The occasion of this learned and bulky treatise in itself stands as an immortal proof of the conscientious way in which Darwin went to work to anticipate the slightest and most comparatively impertinent possible objections to his main theories. Sir Charles Bell, in one of the quaintly antiquated Bridgwater treatises--those marvellous monuments of sadly misplaced teleological ingenuity--had maintained that man was endowed with sundry small facial muscles solely for the sake of expressing his emotions. This view was so obviously opposed to the belief in the descent of man from some lower form, 'that,' says Darwin, 'it was necessary for me to consider it;' and so he did, in a lengthy work, where the whole subject is exhaustively treated, and Bell's idea is completely pulverised by the apt allegation of analogous expressions in the animal world. In his old age Darwin grew, in fact, only the more ceaselessly and wonderfully industrious. In 1875, after three years of comparative silence, came the 'Insectivorous Plants,' a work full of minute observation on the habits and manners of the sundew, the butterwort, the Venus's fly-catcher, and the various heterogeneous bog-haunting species known by the common name of pitcher plants. The bare mass and weight of the facts which Darwin had collected for the 'Origin of Species' might well-nigh have stifled the very existence of that marvellous book: it was lucky that the premature publication of Wallace's paper compelled him to hurry on his 'brief abstract,' for if he had waited to select and arrange the whole series of observations that he finally published in his various later justificatory volumes, we might have looked in vain for the great systematic and organising work, which would no doubt have been 'surcharged with its own weight, and strangled with its waste fertility.' But the task that he himself best loved was to watch in minute detail the principles whose secret he had penetrated, and whose reserve he had <b>broken,</b> <b>working</b> themselves out before his very eyes, naked and not ashamed--to catch Actæon-like the undraped form of nature herself in the actual process of her inmost being. He could patiently observe the red and slimy hair-glands of the drosera closing slowly and remorselessly round the insect prey, and sucking from their bodies with sensitive tentacles the protoplasmic juices denied to its leaves by the poor and boggy soil, on which alone its scanty rootlets can properly thrive. He could watch the butterwort curving round the edges of its wan green foliage upon the captured limbs of fly or aphis. He could note how the serried mass of finger-like processes in the utricles of the bladderwort slowly absorb organic matter from the larva of a gnat, or the minute water-insects entangled within its living and almost animated lobster-pot. He could track the long line of treacherous honey-glands by which the sarracenia entices flies into the festering manure-wells of its sticky pitchers. The minuteness and skill of all his observations on these lesser problems of natural selection inevitably inspired faith among outsiders in the cautious judgment of the observer and experimenter; and day by day throughout his later years the evidence of the popular acceptance of his doctrine, and of the dying away of the general ridicule with which it was first received by the unlearned public, was very gratifying to the great naturalist.|$|E

Observable levels of chirally-polarized gravitational radiation (r∼ 10 ^- 3) can be produced while the evolution of all background fields is sub-Planckian. The gravitational wave spectrum is amplified via linear mixing with the gauge field fluctuations, and its amplitude is not simply set by the Hubble rate during inflation. This allows observable gravitational waves to be produced for an inflationary energy scale below the GUT scale. The tilt of the resulting gravitational wave spectrum can be either blue or red.

40|$|English matrimonial law {{until the}} mid-nineteenth century was {{administered}} by the ecclesiastical courts. The high legal fees charged by these courts restricted the number of matrimonial disputes which came before them. Moreover they were not empowered to grant divorce a vinculo. This matrimonial relief could be obtained only from Parliament but few husbands could meet the heavy expenses of a Private Act. The transfer of divorce hearings to a civil court in 1857 benefitted the middle class, though {{the mass of the}} people still remained debarred by inability to pay legal and court fees. Wives were additionally handicapped by economic and legal disadvantages. The need to provide working class wives with a quick, cheap and accessible means of protection from cruel husbands led to the establishment of the matrimonial jurisdiction of magistrates' courts in 1878. Study of the resort to divorce before the Second World War shows that it was the de facto non-availability of divorce rather than the lack of acceptable grounds that resulted in the great majority of broken marriages being dealt with in the summary court. Concern over evidence that the inability of working class spouses to obtain divorce resulted in the formation of illicit unions, {{led to the development of}} legal aid provisions culminating in the Legal Aid and Advice Act of 1949. This Act has been of special benefit to wives seeking divorce. Legal Aid, higher real wages and greater acceptance of divorce within the community have allowed an increasing number of <b>broken</b> <b>working</b> class marriages to be dissolved. Findings from a sample of 1961 divorce petitions show that social class and the rate of divorce are inversely associated. However, a broad breakdown into a non-manual/manual dichotomy hides variations within individual class groupings. Thus, white-collar workers have a higher rate of divorce than do manual workers. The social class of petitioners was also found to be associated with such demographic characteristics such as age at marriage and divorce. Although the divorce courts have been opened to all sections of the population, the criminal courts continue to hear the matrimonial disputes of the very poor. Evidence from a survey of maintenance orders held in magistrates' courts in 1966 suggests that some 165, 000 marriages are neither martially united nor legally dissolved. Half of these separated spouses never seek divorce. <p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: It is an {{important}} aspect in urban traffic control to make the arterial traffic operate under good condition. The prevalent method is by coordinating the traffic signal lamps to obtain the progression on a corridor. In China, a majority of loop detectors are <b>broken</b> and not <b>working</b> {{because of the lack}} of maintenance. Time-of–day (TOD) timing plans were developed offline on these arterial nodes. A coordination signal timing plan consists of three parameters, namely cycle length, phase split and offset. Because of the difference of traffic volume, speed, etc., a timing plan implemented in a certain time interval is different to those in other intervals in one day. So it needs to be solved to make timing plan smooth transition from one to the next. In this paper, the practical methods were improved by selecting reasonable offset and cycle length to make signal transitions smooth and speedy. Key Words: urban traffic control, signal timing transition, time of day (TOD), arterial control, offse...|$|R

Criou-se a necessidade de olhares diferentes, olhares que trouxessem alento e esperança. Com isso, começaram a surgir as primeiras organizações chamadas filantrópicas, hoje conhecidas como Organizações Não Governamentais ou Organizações do Terceiro Setor. Quanto mais essa área crescia, tanto maior era o número de voluntários que se abdicavam em prol de seu próximo. Entretanto, esses voluntários, em seu papel de cuidadores, não eram cuidados. Armazenavam dores e desamores, sonhos destruídos e vidas repartidas, pois trabalham com gente, que há muito esqueceu o significado da palavra esperança. Portanto, a dissertação analisa esses cuidadores que começaram a ter a sua identidade perdida, demonstrando - nos atendimentos - a impressão de que precisavam ser lembrados e cuidados. A pesquisa busca criar um embasamento para uma profunda reflexão sobre a necessidade da conscientização, de treinamento e de reconhecimento do outro e do eu, bem como da importância do trabalho de grupo. O cuidador ajuda às pessoas a colocarem em ordem seu caos emocional e vivencial, mas é preciso que seja também ouvido e abraçado.

Luke takes one last stab at freedom when he is ordered to take the turtle to the truck. He steals the dump truck, as well as the keys to the other trucks. [...] In the excitement of the moment, Dragline jumps in the dump truck and joins Luke in his escape. Later, after abandoning the truck, Luke tells Dragline that they should part ways. Dragline agrees and leaves. Luke enters a church, where he talks to God and blames Him for sabotaging him so he cannot win in life. Moments later, police cars arrive. Dragline walks in and tells Luke that the police and bosses have promised not to hurt Luke if he surrenders peacefully. But Luke, feeling that his life is no longer worth living, walks to a window facing the police and mocks the Captain by repeating the first part of his speech ("What we've got here is a failure to communicate."). He is immediately shot in the neck by Boss Godfrey. Dragline carries Luke outside, then charges at Boss Godfrey and attempts to strangle him until he is beaten and subdued by the other guards. In tears, Dragline implores Luke to live. The local police want to take Luke to a nearby hospital, but the Captain tells them {{to take him to the}} prison hospital instead, a long enough distance that Luke's chances of survival are slim.

40|$|The {{application}} of robotic U-shaped line layouts {{is becoming more}} important for manufacturing companies. Compared to straight assembly line layouts, U-shaped assembly lines result in cost savings, easier material handling and higher production rates. The {{reason for this is}} that U-shaped lines improve visibility and skill sharing between operators, increase production quality, reduce work in process inventory and facilitate problem-solving of appearing production failures which is shown in several researches. Key companies such as Toyota and Boeing are using U-shaped assembly lines to benefit from the advantages of U-shaped line layouts. However, few breakdown strategies are designed especially for U-shaped lines even though machine breakdowns are common. Breakdowns reduce the throughput rate and product quality and therefore strategies are needed which can ensure the targeted throughput and product quality of companies during breakdowns. In this thesis a breakdown strategy IS designed for a robotic U-shaped line which uses versatile backup robots on backup stations to cover the failures of workstation robots. Versatile backup robots are only considered in one prior study for a straight line layout and, in that study, the backup robots demonstrated a better performance than other breakdown strategies used for straight lines. The concept of backup stations with versatile robots is adapted to the robotic U-shaped line layout to identify whether backup robots can be an efficient breakdown strategy for robotic U-shaped lines. This adaptation is the placement of the backup stations between the arms of the U-shaped line layout. An automotive body shop assembly line configuration is selected for the U-shaped line layout. Ten workstations are used in the line configuration. Four positions exist for the placement of backup stations. Each combination of workstations and placement positions have been analyzed to find the most efficient backup strategy for line configuration designed. The analysis starts with the one backup station, then considers two backup stations and finally three backup stations on the four possible placement options. The best option of the one, two and three backup stations are compared with four backup stations and the current breakdown strategies which are the usage of manual repair stations only and the workload reallocation of <b>broken</b> robots by <b>working</b> robots downstream the line. The criteria for the performance comparison are the cycle time and product quality which are generated for a 5 %, 10 % and 15 %-line breakdown. For the generation of the criteria, a genetic algorithm is used which is modified from a straight line layout to the robotic U-shaped line backup strategy and current breakdown strategies. The analyses of the best placement options for the one, two, three and four backup stations options identify that the three and four backup stations options have the best cycle time and product quality for breakdowns, because they cover each workstation without the use of manual repair stations. It is shown that the three backup stations option is the best choice for the designed automotive body shop assembly line configuration. The three backup stations option has the same cycle time and product quality as the four backup stations option, but it uses one less backup station. Furthermore, the robotic U-shaped line backup strategy using three backup stations has a much better performance than the current breakdown strategies. Its cycle time for breakdowns is half as much as the cycle time of the current breakdown strategies and the robotic U-shaped line backup strategy does not use manual repair stations that generate a high product quality consciously. Due to these facts, the robotic U-shaped line backup strategy is an efficient breakdown strategy for the robotic U-shaped line, because it ensures production with a smooth line flow, a continuously high product quality and the avoidance of work in process inventories for breakdowns. Nevertheless, the robotic U-shaped line backup strategy has three major disadvantages. The first disadvantage is that the backup robots have to be maintained after each operating period to ensure that they do not break down. The next disadvantage is the requirements of an intelligent conveyor system so that the backup station can be accessed without disrupting the material flow when a breakdown occurs. The last disadvantage is that the backup robots have to been equipped with several possibly costly tools, to cover the workstation robots. The final decision on which backup strategy to use is therefore conditional on the cost of equipment, but this study can easily be extended to include these factors when the data is available. ...|$|R

[...] He said he couldn't make the boy believe [...] He could find water with a hazel prong-- [...] Which showed how much good school had ever done him. [...] He wanted to go over that. But most of all [...] He thinks if he could have another chance [...] To teach him how to build a load of hay----" [...] "I know, that's Silas' one accomplishment. [...] He bundles every forkful in its place, [...] And tags and numbers it for future reference, [...] So he can find and easily dislodge it [...] In the unloading. Silas does that well. [...] He takes it out in bunches like big birds' nests. [...] You never see him standing on the hay [...] He's trying to lift, straining to lift himself." [...] "He thinks if he could teach him that, he'd be [...] Some good perhaps to someone in the world. [...] He hates to see a boy the fool of books. [...] Poor Silas, so concerned for other folk, [...] And nothing to look backward to with pride, [...] And nothing to look forward to with hope, [...] So now and never any different." [...] Part of a moon was falling down the west, [...] Dragging the whole sky with it to the hills. [...] Its light poured softly in her lap. She saw [...] And spread her apron to it. She put out her hand [...] Among the harp-like morning-glory strings, [...] Taut with the dew from garden bed to eaves, [...] As if she played unheard the tenderness [...] That wrought on him beside her in the night. [...] "Warren," [...] she said, [...] "he has come home to die: [...] You needn't be afraid he'll leave you this time." [...] "Home," [...] he mocked gently. [...] "Yes, what else but home? [...] It all depends on what you mean by home. [...] Of course he's nothing to us, any more [...] Than was the hound that came a stranger to us [...] Out of the woods, worn out upon the trail." [...] "Home is the place where, when you have to go there, [...] They have to take you in." [...] "I should have called it [...] Something you somehow haven't to deserve." [...] Warren leaned out and took a step or two, [...] Picked up a little stick, and brought it back [...] And broke it in his hand and tossed it by. [...] "Silas has better claim on us you think [...] Than on his brother? Thirteen little miles [...] As the road winds would bring him to his door. [...] Silas has walked that far no doubt to-day. [...] Why didn't he go there? His brother's rich, [...] A somebody--director in the bank." [...] "He never told us that." [...] "We know it though." [...] "I think his brother ought to help, of course. [...] I'll see to that if there is need. He ought of right [...] To take him in, and might be willing to-- [...] He may be better than appearances. [...] But have some pity on Silas. Do you think [...] If he'd had any pride in claiming kin [...] Or anything he looked for from his brother, [...] He'd keep so still about him all this time?" [...] "I wonder what's between them." [...] "I can tell you. [...] Silas is what he is--we wouldn't mind him-- [...] But just the kind that kinsfolk can't abide. [...] He never did a thing so very bad. [...] He don't know why he isn't quite as good [...] As anyone. He won't be made ashamed [...] To please his brother, worthless though he is." [...] "I can't think Si ever hurt anyone." [...] "No, but he hurt my heart the way he lay [...] And rolled his old head on that sharp-edged chair-back. [...] He wouldn't let me put him on the lounge. [...] You must go in and see what you can do. [...] I made the bed up for him there to-night. [...] You'll be surprised at him--how much he's <b>broken.</b> [...] His <b>working</b> days are done; I'm sure of it." [...] "I'd not be in a hurry to say that." [...] "I haven't been. Go, look, see for yourself. [...] But, Warren, please remember how it is: [...] He's come to help you ditch the meadow. [...] He has a plan. You mustn't laugh at him. [...] He may not speak of it, and then he may. [...] I'll sit and see if that small sailing cloud [...] Will hit or miss the moon." [...] It hit the moon. [...] Then there were three there, making a dim row, [...] The moon, the little silver cloud, and she. [...] Warren returned--too soon, it seemed to her, [...] Slipped to her side, caught up her hand and waited. [...] "Warren," [...] she questioned. [...] "Dead," [...] was all he answered.|$|R
