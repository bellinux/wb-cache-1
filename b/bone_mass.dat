5|$|About {{three-quarters of}} dietary calcium is from dairy {{products}} and grains, the rest being {{accounted for by}} vegetables, protein-rich foods, fruits, sugar, fats, and oil. Calcium supplementation is controversial, as the bioavailability of calcium {{is strongly dependent on}} the solubility of the salt involved: calcium citrate, malate, and lactate are highly bioavailable while the oxalate is much less so. The intestine absorbs about one-third of calcium eaten as the free ion, and plasma calcium level is then regulated by the kidneys. Parathyroid hormone and vitamin D promote the formation of bone by allowing and enhancing the deposition of calcium ions there, allowing rapid bone turnover without affecting <b>bone</b> <b>mass</b> or mineral content. When plasma calcium levels fall, cell surface receptors are activated and the secretion of parathyroid hormone occurs; it then proceeds to stimulate the entry of calcium into the plasma pool by taking it from targeted kidney, gut, and bone cells, with the bone-forming action of parathyroid hormone being antagonised by calcitonin, whose secretion increases with increasing plasma calcium levels.|$|E
25|$|However, if the {{thyrotoxicosis}} {{is treated}} early, bone loss can be minimized. The level of calcium {{in the blood}} can be determined by a simple blood test, and a bone density scan can document the amount of bone loss. There are many medications that can help to rebuild <b>bone</b> <b>mass</b> and to prevent further bone loss. Risedronate treatment has been demonstrated to help restore <b>bone</b> <b>mass</b> in osteopenia/osteoporosis associated with Graves' disease. Nevertheless, weight-bearing exercises, a balanced diet, calcium intake of about 1500mg a day and enough vitamin D, are of course elementary foundations.|$|E
25|$|In {{mice and}} humans, {{alterations}} in serotonin levels and signalling {{have been shown}} to regulate <b>bone</b> <b>mass.</b> Mice that lack brain serotonin have osteopenia, while mice that lack gut serotonin have high bone density. In humans, increased blood serotonin levels {{have been shown to}} be significant negative predictor of low bone density. Serotonin can also be synthesized, albeit at very low levels, in the bone cells. It mediates its actions on bone cells using three different receptors. Through 5-HT1B receptors, it negatively regulates <b>bone</b> <b>mass,</b> while it does so positively through 5-HT2B receptors and 5-HT2C receptors. There is very delicate balance between physiological role of gut serotonin and its pathology. Increase in the extracellular content of serotonin results in a complex relay of signals in the osteoblasts culminating in FoxO1/ Creb and ATF4 dependent transcriptional events. These studies have opened a new area of research in bone metabolism that can be potentially harnessed to treat <b>bone</b> <b>mass</b> disorders.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Loss of <b>bone</b> mineral <b>mass,</b> muscle atrophy, and {{functional}} limitations are predictable consequences of immobilization and subsequent weight-bearing restriction due to leg or ankle fractures.

50|$|Galileo Galilei was {{interested}} in the strength of bones and suggested that bones are hollow because this affords maximum strength with minimum weight. He noted that animals' <b>bone</b> <b>masses</b> increased disproportionately to their size. Consequently, bones must also increase disproportionately in girth rather than mere size. This is because the bending strength of a tubular structure (such as a bone) is much more efficient relative to its weight. Mason suggests that this insight {{was one of the first}} grasps of the principles of biological optimization.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Past studies {{indicate}} postmenopausal women who eat meat may experience greater bone mineral loss than lacto-ovo-vegetarian women. The present study extends those findings by comparing bone mineral in adult lacto-ovo-vegetarian and omnivorous males. <b>Bone</b> mineral <b>mass</b> {{was determined by}} direct photon absorptiometry in 320 lacto-ovo-vegetarian and 320 omnivorous males 20 to 79 yr old. Lacto-ovo-vegetarians were Seventh-day Adventists committed to their diet for at least 20 yr. Measurements were made at a cortical site along the radius. No statistical differences were identified between <b>bone</b> mineral <b>mass</b> in the lacto-ovo-vegetarian and omnivorous males in any decade examined. When contrasted against significant differences between <b>bone</b> mineral <b>mass</b> in postmenopausal omnivores and lacto-ovo-vegetanans, the data presented here may be interpreted as indicating that some factor associated with meat consumption is increasing bone mineral losses in postmenopausal females while having no observable effect in males.

25|$|The {{underlying}} {{mechanism in}} all cases of osteoporosis is an imbalance between bone resorption and bone formation. In normal bone, matrix remodeling of bone is constant; up to 10% of all <b>bone</b> <b>mass</b> may be undergoing remodeling {{at any point in}} time. The process takes place in bone multicellular units (BMUs) as first described by Frost & Thomas in 1963. Osteoclasts are assisted by transcription factor PU.1 to degrade the bone matrix, while osteoblasts rebuild the bone matrix. Low <b>bone</b> <b>mass</b> density can then occur when osteoclasts are degrading the bone matrix faster than the osteoblasts are rebuilding the bone.|$|E
25|$|Underweight/inactive: Bone {{remodeling}} {{occurs in}} response to physical stress, so physical inactivity can lead to significant bone loss. Weight bearing exercise can increase peak <b>bone</b> <b>mass</b> achieved in adolescence, and a highly significant correlation between bone strength and muscle strength has been determined. The incidence of osteoporosis is lower in overweight people.|$|E
25|$|Estradiol has a {{profound}} effect on bone. Individuals without it (or other estrogens) will become tall and eunuchoid, as epiphyseal closure is delayed or may not take place. Bone structure is affected also, resulting in early osteopenia and osteoporosis.

MRI can also be used to look for cartilage on the surface of tumor and can depict any vascular complications caused by the tumor. An MRI can identify tumors of the spinal column and is often used to diagnose low grade osteosarcoma.|$|R
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that increased loading on an animal by chronic centrifugation {{results in an}} increase in skeletal mass was tested, using metabolically mature hamsters, rats, guinea pigs, Dutch rabbits and New Zealand rabbits representing a body mass range from 0. 15 to 3. 8 kg. Groups of 12 male animals of each species were subjeted to 2. 0 g for 6 weeks on a 2. 74 radius centrifuge with one degree of freedom. Subsequently, six of the animals were killed to measure whole body composition, while the rest comprised the control group, recovering for four weeks at 1. 0 g prior to composition analysis. Results show a significant increase in <b>bone</b> mineral <b>mass</b> at 2. 0 g. These centrifuge experiment results were then compared with the results of the USSR Cosmos Biosatellite experiment, whereby five rats experienced osteoporosis after 18. 5 days of weightlessness. The opposing nature of effects that occurred at 0 g and 2. 0 g is indicated schematically of particular interest {{is the fact that the}} <b>bone</b> mineral <b>mass</b> of the Cosmos 1129 flight rats was 17 pct less than that of the 1. 0 g controls; whereas the <b>bone</b> mineral <b>mass</b> of the centrifuge rats was 18 pct greater than that of their 1. 0 g controls.

40|$|It {{is clear}} that, despite their natural tendencies, {{children}} have become less physically active in recent decades, with children today expending approximately 600 kcal. day(- 1) {{less than their}} counterparts 50 years ago. Although the health consequences of a reduced energy expenditure in adults is well documented, there is little direct evidence linking sedentariness with health in children. However, three main benefits arising from adequate childhood physical activity have been postulated. The first is direct improvements in childhood health status; evidence is accumulating that more active children generally display healthier cardiovascular profiles, are leaner and develop higher peak <b>bone</b> <b>masses</b> than their less active counterparts. Secondly, there is a biological carryover effect into adulthood, whereby improved adult health status results from childhood physical activity. In particular, childhood obesity may be a precursor {{for a range of}} adverse health effects in adulthood, while higher <b>bone</b> <b>masses</b> in young people reduce the risk of osteoporosis in old age. Finally, there may be a behavioural carryover into adulthood, whereby active children are more likely to become more active (healthy) adults. However, supporting evidence for this assertion is weak. Given this background, recent health guidelines suggesting that children should accumulate 60 min of moderate-intensity physical activity every day-supplemented by regular activities that promote strength flexibility and bone strength-appear to be justified. Future developments should include the implementation of large-scale, longitudinal studies spanning childhood and young adulthood, the further refinement of tools for measuring physical activity accurately in young people, and research into the relative strength of association between fitness-as well as activity-and health in children...|$|R
25|$|The International Society for Clinical Densitometry {{takes the}} {{position}} that a diagnosis of osteoporosis in men under 50 years of age should not {{be made on the}} basis of densitometric criteria alone.

25|$|Anorexia nervosa causes {{alterations}} {{in the female}} reproductive system; significant weight loss, as well as psychological stress and intense exercise, typically results in a cessation of menstruation in women who are past puberty. In patients with anorexia nervosa, there is a reduction of the secretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone in the central nervous system, preventing ovulation. Anorexia nervosa can also result in pubertal delay or arrest. Both height gain and pubertal development are dependent on the release of growth hormone and gonadotrophins (LH and FSH) from the pituitary gland. Suppression of gonadotrophins in people with anorexia nervosa has been documented. Typically, growth hormone (GH) levels are high, but levels of IGF-1, the downstream hormone that should be released in response to GH are low; this indicates a state of “resistance” to GH due to chronic starvation. IGF-1 is necessary for bone formation, and decreased levels in anorexia nervosa contribute {{to a loss of}} bone density and potentially contribute to osteopenia or osteoporosis. Anorexia nervosa can also result in reduction of peak <b>bone</b> <b>mass.</b> Buildup of bone is greatest during adolescence, and if onset of anorexia nervosa occurs during this time and stalls puberty, low <b>bone</b> <b>mass</b> may be permanent.|$|E

40|$|The direct {{motive for}} this study was the find of exostoses of the {{external}} auditory canal on three skulls from ancient period (2 nd- 3 rd century) which were excavated on site No. 80 in 1996 in Sremska Mitrovica (Sirmium). Among 37 buried individuals, only nine of them had temporal bones preserved. According to archaeological documentation they were probably part of the urban poor, slaves or freedmen manual laborers. In any case they belonged to the lowest social status of ancient Sirmium, which was confirmed by anthropological analysis.

25|$|Osteoporosis {{may be due}} {{to lower}} than normal <b>bone</b> <b>mass</b> and greater than normal bone loss. Bone loss {{increases}} after menopause due to lower levels of estrogen. Osteoporosis may also occur due to a number of diseases or treatments including alcoholism, anorexia, hyperthyroidism, kidney disease, and surgical removal of the ovaries. Certain medications increase the rate of bone loss including some antiseizure medications, chemotherapy, proton pump inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and glucocorticosteroids. Not enough exercise and smoking are also risk factors. Osteoporosis is defined as a bone density of 2.5 standard deviations below that of a young adult. This is typically measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at the hip.|$|E
25|$|Malnutrition: Nutrition has an {{important}} and complex role in maintenance of good bone. Identified risk factors include low dietary calcium and/or phosphorus, magnesium, zinc, boron, iron, fluoride, copper, vitamins A, K, E and C (and D where skin exposure to sunlight provides an inadequate supply). Excess sodium is a risk factor. High blood acidity may be diet-related, and is a known antagonist of bone. Some have identified low protein intake as associated with lower peak <b>bone</b> <b>mass</b> during adolescence and lower bone mineral density in elderly populations. Conversely, some have identified low protein intake as a positive factor, protein is among the causes of dietary acidity. Imbalance of omega-6 to omega-3 polyunsaturated fats is yet another identified risk factor.|$|E
25|$|Osteoblasts {{can also}} be stimulated to {{increase}} <b>bone</b> <b>mass</b> through increased secretion of osteoid and by inhibiting the ability of osteoclasts to break down osseous tissue. Increased secretion of osteoid is stimulated by the secretion of growth hormone by the pituitary, thyroid hormone and the sex hormones (estrogens and androgens). These hormones also promote increased secretion of osteoprotegerin. Osteoblasts {{can also be}} induced to secrete a number of cytokines that promote reabsorbtion of bone by stimulating osteoclast activity and differentiation from progenitor cells. Vitamin D, parathyroid hormone and stimulation from osteocytes induce osteoblasts to increase secretion of RANK-ligand and interleukin 6, which cytokines then stimulate increased reabsorption of bone by osteoclasts. These same compounds also increase secretion of macrophage colony-stimulating factor by osteoblasts, which promotes the differentiation of progenitor cells into osteoclasts, and decrease secretion of osteoprotegerin.|$|E

40|$|Objectives. A {{number of}} {{previous}} studies have reported an inverse relationship between osteoarthritis and osteoporosis. However, the association has remained controversial because osteoarthritis in hand joints seems to associate differently from osteoarthritis in weight-bearing joints with <b>bone</b> mineral <b>mass.</b> We studied osteoarthritis in distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints and osteoarthritis {{in the base of}} the thumb (CMC- 1) for their cross-sectional associations with metacarpal cortical <b>bone</b> mineral <b>mass,</b> and for their prediction of calcaneal broadband ultrasound attenuation. Methods. A population sample of 8000 Finns aged 30 yr and over was invited to a comprehensive health examination in 1978 – 1980; 90 % complied. Hand radiographs were taken from 3568 participants to diagnose osteoarthritis in various hand joints, and to determine two indicators of cortical <b>bone</b> mineral <b>mass,</b> the combined cortical thickness (CCT) and the metacarpal index (MCI). Calcaneal broadband ultrasound attenuation was measured 20 yr later in 340 of these participants with the Sahara sonometer. Results. In the cross-sectional setting, osteoarthritis in the DIP joints and osteoarthritis in the base of the thumb (CMC- 1) were significantly associated with low CCT and low MCI. These associations were proportional to the radiological severity of osteoarthritis. In the follow-up setting, symmetrical DIP osteoarthritis adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, smoking, education, workload and MCI significantly predicted low values of broadband ultrasound attenuation. Conclusions. Our results indicate a direct relation of both radiological DIP osteoarthritis and CMC- 1 osteoarthritis wit...|$|R

25|$|The {{three main}} {{mechanisms}} by which osteoporosis develops are an inadequate peak <b>bone</b> <b>mass</b> (the skeleton develops insufficient mass and strength during growth), excessive bone resorption, and inadequate formation of new bone during remodeling, likely due to MSC biasing away from the osteoblast and toward the marrow adipocyte lineage. An interplay of these three mechanisms underlies the development of fragile bone tissue. Hormonal factors strongly determine the rate of bone resorption; lack of estrogen (e.g. {{as a result of}} menopause) increases bone resorption, as well as decreasing the deposition of new bone that normally takes place in weight-bearing bones. The amount of estrogen needed to suppress this process is lower than that normally needed to stimulate the uterus and breast gland. The α-form of the estrogen receptor appears {{to be the most important}} in regulating bone turnover. In addition to estrogen, calcium metabolism plays a significant role in bone turnover, and deficiency of calcium and vitamin D leads to impaired bone deposition; in addition, the parathyroid glands react to low calcium levels by secreting parathyroid hormone (parathormone, PTH), which increases bone resorption to ensure sufficient calcium in the blood. The role of calcitonin, a hormone generated by the thyroid that increases bone deposition, is less clear and probably not as significant as that of PTH.|$|E
25|$|The {{continued}} use of racial categories has been criticized. Apart from the general controversy regarding race, some argue that the {{continued use}} of racial categories {{in health care and}} as risk factors could result in increased stereotyping and discrimination in society and health services. Some of those who are critical of race as a biological concept see race as socially meaningful group that is important to study epidemiologically in order to reduce disparities. For example, some racial groups are less likely than others to receive adequate treatment for osteoporosis, even after risk factors have been assessed. Since the 19th century, blacks have been thought to have thicker bones than whites have and to lose <b>bone</b> <b>mass</b> more slowly with age. In a recent study, African Americans were shown to be substantially less likely to receive prescription osteoporosis medications than Caucasians. Men were also significantly less likely to be treated compared with women. This discrepancy may be due to physicians' knowledge that, on average, African Americans are at lower risk for osteoporosis than Caucasians. It may be possible that these physicians generalize this data to high-risk African-Americans, leading them to fail to appropriately assess and manage these individuals' osteoporosis. On the other hand, some of those who are critical of race as a biological concept see race as socially meaningful group that is important to study epidemiologically in order to reduce disparities.|$|E

500|$|Osteitis fibrosa cystica ( [...] ), is a {{skeletal}} disorder {{resulting in}} a loss of <b>bone</b> <b>mass,</b> a weakening of the bones as their calcified supporting structures are replaced with fibrous tissue (peritrabecular fibrosis), and the formation of cyst-like brown tumors in and around the bone. Osteitis fibrosis cystica, abbreviated OFC, also known as osteitis fibrosa, osteodystrophia fibrosa, and von Recklinghausen's disease of bone (not to be confused with von Recklinghausen's disease, neurofibromatosis type I), is caused by hyperparathyroidism, which is a surplus of parathyroid hormone from over-active parathyroid glands. This surplus stimulates the activity of osteoclasts, cells that break down bone, in a process known as osteoclastic bone resorption. The hyperparathyroidism can be triggered by a parathyroid adenoma, hereditary factors, parathyroid carcinoma, or renal osteodystrophy. Osteoclastic bone resorption releases minerals, including calcium, from the bone into the bloodstream, causing both elevated blood calcium levels, and the structural changes which weaken the bone. The symptoms of the disease are the consequences of both the general softening of the bones and the excess calcium in the blood, and include bone fractures, kidney stones, nausea, moth-eaten appearance in the bones, appetite loss, and weight loss.|$|E

METHODS: Total body bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD) were determined by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Dietary nutrient intakes were determined from 3 -day food records. Biomarkers of bone turnover, bone metabolites, vitamin D metabolites, hormones, and inflammatory markers were measured by standard clinical laboratory methods. RESULTS: Serum osteocalcin, bone alkaline phosphatase, and C-telopeptide showed significant inverse relations with age in the RTT cohort. Mean osteocalcin concentrations were significantly lower and mean bone alkaline phosphatase concentrations were significantly higher for individual age groups in the RTT cohort than mean values for their respective age ranges in the reference population. Significant inverse associations were identified between urinary calcium losses, expressed as calcium:creatinine ratios, and total body BMC and BMD z scores. Dietary protein, calcium, and phosphorus intakes, expressed as a proportion of Dietary Reference Intakes for age and sex, showed significant positive associations with total body BMD z scores. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests decreased bone formation instead of increased bone resorption may explain in part the deficits in <b>bone</b> mineral <b>mass</b> in RTT and that attention to the adequacy of dietary protein, calcium, and phosphorus intakes may offer an opportunity to improve bone health in RTT. © 2014 by European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition and North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition...|$|R
