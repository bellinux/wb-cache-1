5|$|Both Mulder and Scully stumble {{down the}} stairs in hope of just getting outside to die. They meet up <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> both {{crawling}} on the floor, covered in massive amounts of blood. Scully claims he shot her, while Mulder claims she shot him. Mulder realizes that {{that could not have}} happened and stands up. The illusion is broken, and the two leave the house. Maurice and Lyda sit by the fire, holding hands, saying that they almost had the two agents. Meanwhile, at Mulder's apartment, Mulder and Scully exchange gifts, even though they told each other they would not.|$|E
5|$|June's {{body and}} {{clothing}} were heavily bloodstained; {{she was found}} in her nightdress with bare feet. The police believe she had been sitting up during part of the attack, based on the pattern of blood on her clothing. She was found {{lying on the floor}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of the master bedroom. She had been shot seven times. One shot to her forehead, between her eyes, was fired from under one foot away. That and another shot to the right side of her head would both have caused her death quickly, the court heard. There were also shots to the right side of her lower neck, her right forearm, and two injuries {{on the right side of}} her chest and right knee.|$|E

25|$|Diduryk was {{subsequently}} promoted to Major {{and returned to}} Vietnam in October 1969, as the operations officer of the 2nd Battalion, 12th Cavalry, 1st Cavalry Division. On April 24, 1970, his battalion commander ordered his command helicopter to land and check out a North Vietnamese soldier {{who had been killed}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> gunner. As Major Diduryk emerged from his helicopter, he was struck in the stomach and killed by a bullet in an attack by North Vietnamese soldiers.|$|E

25|$|In central Serbia, {{once the}} {{household}} members {{have gone to}} bed, an elderly woman of the family sticks a knife into the house door from the inside. Alternatively, she puts a hawthorn stake <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> hanging a wreath of garlic on it. This is done as a protection against curses, witches, and demons. For the same reason, children are rubbed with garlic on the palms, armpits, and soles before going to bed. In some regions, the men keep watch in shifts by the fireplace during the night, to keep the fire burning.|$|E
25|$|The {{length and}} {{especially}} width of large SUVs is controversial in urban areas. In areas with limited parking spaces, large SUV drivers {{have been criticized}} for parking in stalls marked for compact cars or that are too narrow for the width of larger vehicles. Critics have stated that this causes problems such as the loss of use of the adjacent space, reduced accessibility into the entry of an adjacent vehicle, blockage of driveway space, and damage inflicted, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> to adjacent vehicles. As a backlash against the alleged space consumption of SUVs, the city of Florence, has restricted access of SUVs to the center, and Paris and Vienna have debated banning them altogether.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, George Street was added, {{and soon}} after Walford East tube station was built, to create further {{locations}} when EastEnders went from two to three episodes per week. The set was constructed by the BBC in-house construction department under construction manager Mike Hagan. The initial build took six months to complete. Most of the buildings on Albert Square have no interior filming space, with a few exceptions, and most do not have rears or gardens. Most areas by the front (and sometimes back) doors are decorated and dressed to match the interior set to allow shots of doors being opened. The grocery shop was originally open fronted, it {{was turned into a}} closed front shop, with removable interior walls to allow for filming inside the shop when the set was expanded in 1987. Some interior shots are filmed in the actual buildings, and the café also has some interior decoration so some limited filming can take place <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> The newer exterior sets including fish and chip shop, video shop and beauty salon had some interior filming space to create a greater sense of realism. As the show is filmed up to six weeks in advance, the trees need to have extra leaves stuck on them during the spring to make them look like they would in summer.|$|E

500|$|In {{the same}} year he tried to free Confederate prisoners of war by {{recruiting}} former members of Morgan's Raiders who had escaped to Canada, including John Hunt Morgan's telegrapher George [...] "Lightning" [...] Ellsworth, who {{was a native of}} Canada. On his last day in Chicago, Hines had to avoid discovery by Union soldiers inspecting the home he was hiding in by crawling into a mattress upon which the homeowner's wife lay ill with delirium. The Union soldiers inspected the house he was in, and even checked to see if Hines was the one lying on the bed, but did not discover Hines in the mattress. The soldiers established a guard <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of the house. As it rained the next day, visitors were encouraged to visit the sick woman. The soldiers never looked at the faces under the umbrellas, and as a result, Hines sneaked {{out of the house and}} left Chicago.|$|E
500|$|Michael Mitz—who portrayed {{one of the}} {{payphone}} occupants—would {{return in}} season five as a photographer in [...] "The Puffy Shirt". The maître d' was portrayed by actor James Hong; {{it is one of}} the actor's most famous roles in the United States. (In fact, he had a small part in a season one episode of The Bob Newhart Show in 1972, portraying a man who is mistaken for a maître d'.) [...] Judy Kain—known for a recurring role on Married... with Children—guest-starred as Lorraine Catalano, the receptionist of Jerry's uncle. David Tress guest-starred as Mr. Cohen, a guest who enters the restaurant and receives a table without reservation, as he is good friends with the maître d'. Larry David's voice can be heard among the group of elderly people Elaine offers money to for one of their egg-rolls. Norman Brenner—who worked as Richards' stand-in on the show for all its nine seasons—appears as an extra; he is sitting <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of the restaurant when George, Jerry, and Elaine enter, and is still at the same spot when they leave.|$|E
