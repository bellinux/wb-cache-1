5|$|Lord Wilberforce, in Quistclose, {{stated that}} the {{contract}} gives the moneylender an equitable interest in the loan. Under Wilberforce's two-stage trust, the interest in the money first goes from the lender to the <b>borrower</b> (the primary trust) and then, when the trust's purpose fails, reverses (the secondary trust). In Twinsectra Lord Millett also explained that a Quistclose trust is a resulting trust, but held that the lender retains the interest throughout the transaction, with no need for this interest to reverse if {{the purpose of the}} loan fails. The problem with Wilberforce's analysis, as explained by Alastair Hudson, Professor of Equity and Finance Law at the University of Exeter, is that because the resulting trust only comes into existence after the misuse of the loan, it may come too late; if the money is not available when the claim is brought, there is no remedy. The <b>borrower</b> may already have spent the money, or already be insolvent and the subject of claims by creditors.|$|E
5|$|Solidarity lending is a {{cornerstone}} of microcredit, and the system is now used in more than 43 countries. Although each <b>borrower</b> must belong to a five-member group, the group {{is not required to}} give any guarantee for a loan to its members. Repayment responsibility rests solely on the individual <b>borrower.</b> The group and the centre oversee that everyone behaves responsibly and none gets into a repayment problem. No formal joint liability exists, i.e. group members are not obliged to pay on behalf of a defaulting member. But, in practice the group members often contribute the defaulted amount with an intention to collect the money from the defaulted member at a later time. Such behaviour is encouraged because Grameen does not extend further credit to a group in which a member defaults.|$|E
5|$|A country's {{external}} {{wealth is}} measured by the value of its foreign assets net of its foreign liabilities. A current account surplus (and corresponding financial account deficit) indicates an increase in external wealth while a deficit indicates a decrease. Aside from current account indications of whether a country is a net buyer or net seller of assets, shifts in a nation's external wealth are influenced by capital gains and capital losses on foreign investments. Having positive external wealth means a country is a net lender (or creditor) in the world economy, while negative external wealth indicates a net <b>borrower</b> (or debtor).|$|E
30|$|Assuming an {{area with}} 10, 000 {{potential}} customers from whom 20 % are low-risk <b>borrowers</b> (“good” <b>borrowers)</b> with collateral assets, 60 % of the customers are low-risk <b>borrowers</b> (“good” <b>borrowers)</b> including the poor (20 %) and the non-poor people (40 %). The remaining 20 % are high-risk <b>borrowers</b> (bad <b>borrowers)</b> with both {{the poor and the}} non-poor people each accounting for half. The entire loan market is thus structured like this: 70 % of the market customers are non-poor people (of which 10 % are high risk <b>borrowers)</b> and 30 % are the poor (of which 10 % are high risk <b>borrowers).</b>|$|R
40|$|Gender {{roles and}} {{business}} type are two important elements that determine {{the success of}} an entrepreneurship activity. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to explore the impact of those two elements on the success of entrepreneurship activities of AIM microcredit <b>borrowers.</b> Data was collected based on a survey with a total of 133 AIM <b>borrowers</b> in Selangor, Malaysia. It consists of 71 men <b>borrowers</b> and 62 women <b>borrowers.</b> The research findings show a significance difference in the impact of gender roles and business type on the success of men and women <b>borrowers.</b> The findings of the survey suggest that impact of gender roles are more significant on the success of women <b>borrowers</b> compared to the men <b>borrowers</b> while the type of business conducted which varies from public transportation business to food and beverage business determines the success of men <b>borrowers</b> as well as the women <b>borrowers.</b> It is argued that gender roles have greater influence on the success of female <b>borrowers</b> compare to men <b>borrowers</b> whereas the choice of type of business differ between male and female <b>borrowers.</b> Female <b>borrowers</b> concentrated more on food and beverages and tailoring business while most male <b>borrowers</b> involved in public transportation business as taxi drivers. This study is expected to highlight the difference in entrepreneurship success determinants between men and women <b>borrowers</b> of AIM...|$|R
40|$|We study a loan market {{equilibrium}} {{in which}} some <b>borrowers</b> are optimistic and banks face imperfect competition.

5|$|In 2003, Grameen Bank {{started a}} new program, {{different}} from its traditional group-based lending, exclusively targeted to the beggars in Bangladesh. This program is focused on distributing small loans to beggars. The loans are completely interest-free, the repayment period can be arbitrarily long, and the <b>borrower</b> is covered under life insurance free of cost. For example, a beggar taking a small loan of around 100 taka (about US$1.50) may pay back only 2.00 taka (about 3.4 US cents) per week.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the balance}} of {{payments}} sums to zero, a current account surplus indicates a deficit in the asset accounts and vice versa. A current account surplus or deficit indicates {{the extent to which}} a country is relying on foreign capital to finance its consumption and investments, and whether it is living beyond its means. For example, assuming a capital account balance of zero (thus no asset transfers available for financing), a current account deficit of £1 billion implies a financial account surplus (or net asset exports) of £1 billion. A net exporter of financial assets is known as a <b>borrower,</b> exchanging future payments for current consumption. Further, a net export of financial assets indicates growth in a country's debt. From this perspective, {{the balance of}} payments links a nation's income to its spending by indicating the degree to which current account imbalances are financed with domestic or foreign financial capital, which illuminates how a nation's wealth is shaped over time. A healthy balance of payments position is important for economic growth. If countries experiencing a growth in demand have trouble sustaining a healthy balance of payments, demand can slow, leading to: unused or excess supply, discouraged foreign investment, and less attractive exports which can further reinforce a negative cycle that intensifies payments imbalances.|$|E
25|$|Adjustable rates {{transfer}} part of {{the interest}} rate risk from the lender to the <b>borrower.</b> They can be used where unpredictable interest rates make fixed rate loans difficult to obtain. The <b>borrower</b> benefits if the interest rate falls but loses if the interest rate increases. The <b>borrower</b> benefits from reduced margins to the underlying cost of borrowing compared to fixed or capped rate mortgages.|$|E

25|$|In the {{traditional}} retail model, borrowers visit a payday lending store and secure a small cash loan, with payment due in full at the borrower's next paycheck. The <b>borrower</b> writes a postdated {{check to the}} lender in the full amount of the loan plus fees. On the maturity date, the <b>borrower</b> is expected {{to return to the}} store to repay the loan in person. If the <b>borrower</b> does not repay the loan in person, the lender may redeem the check. If the account is short on funds to cover the check, the <b>borrower</b> may now face a bounced check fee from their bank in addition to the costs of the loan, and the loan may incur additional fees or an increased interest rate (or both) {{as a result of the}} failure to pay.|$|E

5000|$|Failure {{to present}} the loan price as negotiable. Many lenders will {{negotiate}} the price structure of the loan with <b>borrowers.</b> In some situations, <b>borrowers</b> can even negotiate an outright reduction in the interest rate or other charges on the loan. Consumer advocates argue that <b>borrowers,</b> especially unsophisticated <b>borrowers,</b> {{are not aware of}} their ability to negotiate and might even be under the mistaken impression that the lender is placing the <b>borrower's</b> interests above its own. Thus, many <b>borrowers</b> do not take advantage of their ability to negotiate.|$|R

25|$|Economist Paul McCulley {{described}} how Minsky's hypothesis translates to the subprime mortgage crisis. McCulley illustrated {{the three types}} of borrowing categories using an analogy from the mortgage market: a hedge <b>borrower</b> would have a traditional mortgage loan and is paying back both the principal and interest; the speculative <b>borrower</b> would have an interest-only loan, meaning they are paying back only the interest and must refinance later to pay back the principal; and the ponzi <b>borrower</b> would have a negative amortization loan, meaning the payments do not cover the interest amount and the principal is actually increasing. Lenders only provided funds to ponzi borrowers due to a belief that housing values would continue to increase.|$|E
25|$|In many cases, borrowers write a post-dated check (check with {{a future}} date) to the lender; if the borrowers don't {{have enough money}} in their account by the check's date, their check will bounce. In Texas, payday lenders are {{prohibited}} from suing a <b>borrower</b> for theft if the check is post-dated. One payday lender in the state instead gets their customers to write checks dated for the day the loan is given. Customers borrow money because they don't have any, so the lender accepts the check knowing that it would bounce on the check's date. If the <b>borrower</b> fails to pay on the due date, the lender sues the <b>borrower</b> for writing a hot check.|$|E

50|$|Moral hazard {{can also}} occur with <b>borrowers.</b> <b>Borrowers</b> may not act prudently (in {{the view of}} the lender) when they invest or spend funds recklessly. For example, credit card {{companies}} often limit the amount <b>borrowers</b> can spend with their cards because without such limits <b>borrowers</b> may spend borrowed funds recklessly, leading to default.|$|R
40|$|Assessing {{the impacts}} of bank mergers on small firms {{requires}} separating <b>borrowers</b> with single versus multiple banking relationships and distinguishing the three alternatives of "staying," "dropping," and "switching" of relationship. Single-relationship <b>borrowers</b> who "switch" to another bank following a merger will be less harmed than those whose relationship is "dropped" and not replaced. Using Belgian data, we find that single-relationship <b>borrowers</b> of target banks {{are more likely than}} other <b>borrowers</b> to be dropped. We track post-merger performance and show that many dropped target-bank <b>borrowers</b> are harmed by the merger. Multiple-relationship <b>borrowers</b> are less harmed, as they can better hedge against relationship discontinuation...|$|R

25|$|Since HELOCs are {{intended}} by banks to primarily sit in second lien position, they normally are only capped by the {{maximum interest rate}} allowed by law in the state wherein they are issued. For example, Florida currently has an 18% cap on interest rate charges. They are risky to the <b>borrower</b> {{in the sense that}} they are mostly indexed to the Wall Street Journal prime rate, which is considered a Spot Index, or a financial indicator that is subject to immediate change (as are the loans based upon the Prime Rate). The risk to <b>borrower</b> being that a financial situation causing the Federal Reserve to raise rates dramatically (see 1980, 2006) would effect an immediate rise in obligation to the <b>borrower,</b> up to the capped rate.|$|E
40|$|Both <b>borrowers</b> and lenders can be {{socially}} responsible (SR). Ethical banks commit to financing only ethical projects, which have social profitability but lower expected revenues than standard projects. Instead, no credible commitment exists for SR <b>borrowers.</b> The matching between SR <b>borrowers</b> and ethical banks reduces the frictions caused by moral hazard. However, when {{the type of}} the <b>borrowers</b> is not observable, then standard <b>borrowers</b> have incentives to invest in ethical projects pretending to be SR. We show that the separation of <b>borrowers</b> entails costs that are paid by SR entrepreneurs but are relatively low because standard lenders offer an outside option that relaxes the self-selection constraint of the <b>borrowers.</b> Technically, we solve a Contract Proposal Game where informed principals (<b>borrowers)</b> offer different menus of contracts to heterogeneous agents (banks). We show that market segmentation improves efficiency and solves the problem of multiplicity of equilibria in Contract Proposal Games. ...|$|R
3000|$|With the {{existing}} financial risk evaluation model, financial {{institutions in the}} loan market often cannot distinguish “good” <b>borrowers</b> who are honest and preparing for repayment from “bad” <b>borrowers</b> who has low credit and {{do not intend to}} repay the loan. Therefore, they relate interest rate to the average credit quality of all <b>borrowers</b> and take it as the basis of credit rationing combined with the quality of the assets the <b>borrowers</b> possess. However, in the financial market, raising interest rates does not always lead to credit market clear. If the financial institutions set interest rates in accordance with the average risk, low-risk <b>borrowers</b> (“good” <b>borrowers)</b> would seek other channels of financing. On the other hand, high-risk <b>borrowers</b> (“bad” <b>borrowers)</b> are not interest-sensitive because they have no intention of repayment. High interest rate will thus exclude the low risk <b>borrowers</b> from the market, which in turn leads to greater risk of financial institutions greater. Therefore, financial institutions are reluctant to engage in such business, which would make the market to be a “lemon” one. 4 [...]...|$|R

30|$|In a lending {{market with}} {{multiple}} lenders and multiple <b>borrowers,</b> information asymmetry (Akerlof 1970) {{is a common}} problem. <b>Borrowers</b> typically have more accurate information than lenders about their willingness and ability to repay a loan. Information asymmetry will not only affect lenders’ actions but also the entire market’s efficiency. Since the expected gains from the loan contract are a function of both the pricing and the probability of repayment, when lenders can’t distinguish good <b>borrowers</b> from bad <b>borrowers,</b> all <b>borrowers</b> would be charged the same interest rate that reflects their pooled experience. Such a scenario will cause the adverse selection problem (good <b>borrowers</b> {{drop out of the}} market due to the high interest rate) and the moral hazard problem (<b>borrowers</b> have incentive to default since there is no future consequence) (Stiglitz and Weiss 1981).|$|R
25|$|A bank {{aggregates}} {{the activities}} of many <b>borrowers</b> and lenders. A bank accepts deposits from lenders, on which it pays interest.

40|$|Should the law {{restrict}} {{liability of}} defaulting <b>borrowers?</b> We abstract from possible benefits arising from limited rationality or risk-aversion of <b>borrowers,</b> contractual incompleteness, or lender moral hazard. We focus instead on general equilibrium implications of liability rules with moral hazard among <b>borrowers</b> with varying wealth. If lenders {{are on the}} short side of the market, weakening liability rules lower lender profits, may cause additional exclusion among the poor, but generate additional rents for wealthier <b>borrowers.</b> For certain changes in liability rules (such as a ban on bonded labor, or weakening bankruptcy rules below a wealth threshold) they also raise productivity among <b>borrowers</b> of intermediate wealth. Hence they {{can be interpreted as}} a form of efficiency-enhancing redistribution from lenders and poor <b>borrowers</b> to middle class <b>borrowers.</b> Our model provides a possible rationale for why weaker liability rules are observed in wealthier countries. ...|$|R
