50|$|One such account {{suggests}} that the lamington was first served in Toowoomba, when Lord Lamington took his entourage to Harlaxton House to escape the steamy heat of Brisbane, whereas another claims that it was created by Galland at Queensland's Government House in Brisbane during the busy period leading up to Federation in 1901. A further alternative claim is that Lord Lamington's cook, presumably Galland, accidentally dropped a <b>block</b> <b>of</b> sponge <b>cake</b> into a dish of chocolate.

This begins a montage of shots of white-uniformed cooks moving trolleys of ingredients and performing cake preparation work such as zesting oranges and mechanically mixing cake batter. Several large <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> madeira <b>cake</b> are taken from the oven, starting a time-lapse sequence <b>of</b> the brick-like <b>cakes</b> being arranged into a pile and being mortared with buttercream icing. After a shot of gloved hands kneading orange sugar paste, a woman pours melted chocolate into a pot of Rice Krispies. The sugar paste is pressed between rollers, and the pot of Rice Krispies emptied into a mould. Layers <b>of</b> Battenberg <b>cake</b> are mortared together with raspberry jam. The Rice Krispies are removed from the moulds and arranged as panels around the madeira structure, creating the rough outline of a car. Jelly mixture is poured into a mould while another cook attaches Fox's Glacier Mints to a fondant base to create a headlamp. Long lines of liquorice are wrapped as belts around pieces of a madeira engine. A tin of golden syrup is poured in place of lubricant. The engine is lowered into {{the front of the}} car while pastry chairs are lowered into the interior. The jelly mould is removed to reveal a brake light, and a tyre made of chocolate fondant is wheeled in and various details such as liquorice windscreen wipers and a front grille made of chocolate Flakes are added to the car. The bonnet is lowered and icing sugar is dusted onto the roof before a fondant Škoda logo is attached to the front. The closing shot is of the team lined up around their creation, which now appears to be a <b>cake</b> replica <b>of</b> a Škoda Fabia, with the tagline [...] "The new Fabia. Full of lovely stuff."

The effect of various levels of mushroom powder on the physico-chemical properties and nutritional quality <b>of</b> <b>cakes</b> had been observed.

Compositional analysis <b>of</b> <b>cake</b> showed that cake containing mushroom powder had higher protein and fat content and lower carbohydrate content than the control cake.
