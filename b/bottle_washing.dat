40|$|Issue: Historically, label {{adhesives}} used by bottlers {{were designed}} for easy removal so that bottlers could recover their own bottles through local buy-back programs and wash the containers for re-use. With most bottle-washing programs discontinued, {{and in response to}} marketing and operational considerations, many have converted to more convenient and durable label adhesives. These adhesives, which include press-applied and plastic labels, pose a major barrier to successful <b>bottle</b> <b>washing</b> because they do not readily come off in the caustic baths used in <b>bottle</b> <b>washing</b> machines. Best Practice: Several strategies may help to mitigate the problems associated with more durable label adhesives. The best way is to convince bottlers to use washing-friendly labels. This should be part of an overall marketing plan for the bottle-washing program (see Elements of a Bottle-Washing Program Best Practice). Second, understanding the fundamental technology of label adhesives makes it possible to develop strategies for resolving difficulties with durable label adhesives. There are several primary glue types, including wet glues, high release dry glues, and press-applied adhesives (i. e., self-adhesive labels). Wet glues are water-based, and easily release in hot caustic solutions. Press-applied labels, however, are more durable and may actually strengthen their bonds in response to heat, preventing them from releasing when washed.

40|$|Issue: A {{successful}} {{program for}} re-washing recycled glass containers {{for use in}} applications such as wine bottling depends on overcoming a number of challenges, including developing collection infrastructure, sorting diverse bottle streams, achieving efficient washing, and market penetration. <b>Bottle</b> <b>washing</b> programs may focus {{on a variety of}} bottle types, including beer bottles, wine bottles, or juice bottles. This Best Practice focuses on the key elements of a wine bottle-washing program, although many of the concepts are applicable to other containers. A successful bottle-washing program requires the integration of collection and supply infrastructure, sorting protocols, and equipment selection. Best Practice: Historically, bottles were manufactured to heavy specifications as returnables. Today, most glass containers are manufactured as one-way containers, not intended to withstand the rigors of multiple re-washings. Wine bottles remain an exception. Wine bottles manufactured in the United States generally have the same weight as those manufactured in Europe, where washing wine bottles is a common procedure. Because it contains a non-pressurized liquid, a wine bottle does not have the same potential to break from pressure, as does a defective container of beer or soda. However, the development of coated glass bottles may lead to lighter weight wine bottles as well. In addition, only regions with an adequate wine production industry are potential locations for wine <b>bottle</b> <b>washing</b> facilities. Finally, wine bottles wholesale for 35 ¢- 40 ¢each, while beer bottles cost only about 10 ¢, so washing may be more economically feasible for wine bottles.

30|$|In the {{bottling}} company. In this industry, it {{was observed}} that the electricity supply is 100 % from three 800 -kV A diesel generators, while thermal energy for the boiler is from low pour fuel oil (LPFO). Two out of the three diesel generators are run at a time (24 [*]h/day), and the other stays on standby. To say the least, this scenario is a replicate of most industries in Nigeria which is indeed a sad commentary of the electricity supply situation in the country. In terms of energy efficiency, the compounding wastes along the energy supply line are better imagined. The scenario in the bottling company in relation to energy efficiency is that a 10 -bar, 2 -tonnes/h capacity, LPFO-fired steam boiler produces steam at a pressure of 4 to 5 bars (about 140 °C to 150 °C) used in <b>bottle</b> <b>washing</b> that requires hot water at a temperature of about 80 °C to 90 °C. It was observed that the steam produced at a high temperature of about 140 °C has to be throttled to reduce the temperature to the required level for <b>bottle</b> <b>washing.</b> Ironically, the runoff water from the final washing stage comes out at a temperature of 60 °C to 70 °C and is emptied into the drain. While this practice is considered proper {{from the point of view}} of avoidance of contamination, it is suggested that a low pressure steam boiler operated at 2 bars can meet the steam requirement and thus save thermal energy. Furthermore, in the compressed air unit, the water-cooled single-stage compressor delivers at a temperature of about 80 °C, while the cooling water comes off at 60 °C and is again let off the drain. Opportunity for energy efficiency here is that the heat of the air compression can be recovered to heat the boiler feed water, and this may result to about 5 % energy savings.|$|E

As an example, consider blow-moulding machines which represent the recent technology for bottling of beverages like mineral water or fruit juices. This kind of machinery is set up for a specific shape and size of plastic bottles by mounting the required moulds into the processing head of the machine. The actual plastic bottles are formed on the machine from compact pre-forms through thermal and high-air pressure processes. Depending on {{the configuration of the}} machine, around 20 moulding devices are arranged on a rotary turret thus allowing a respective number of bottles to be produced on the fly.

However two strains of yersinia were isolated from a sample of milk taken immediately after pasteurization but before bottling. The thermograph indicated that the time/temperature conditions applied during pasteurization were adequate. The presence of yersinia strains in the milk at this stage therefore suggests that undetectable levels of raw milk were being allowed to contaminate the pasteurized milk.

40|$|Hygiene {{standards}} in food processing Cue: Farmers are frequently told that {{to earn more}} money from their crops they must add value to them. So for farmers producing fruit or vegetable crops, what options are there for adding value? Some methods, such as grading the produce, require little or no equipment. Processing the crop, for example into a jam, juice or chutney, requires more investment, but can be an excellent business, particularly for women?s groups. However, a successful food processing operation needs to have very strict standards of hygiene and quality {{in order to make}} a consistently good product. These standards must apply not only to the quality of the fruit and vegetables themselves, but also the cleanliness of the building, equipment and staff who work there. In May 2005 a new food processing plant opened in Banjulunding, a small town close to the Gambian capital Banjul. The plant, which produces a wide range of products including watermelon and mango juices, and orange and lemon squash, is staffed by women from the town and the surrounding villages. The women are not only staff, but also trainees, and are taught the skills needed for the various food processing operations. To find out more about how high standards are maintained, Ismaila Senghore visited the plant and spoke to Mr Sidi Fofana, co-ordinator and trainer of the food processing operation. IN:		?Whatever you process if ?? OUT:		??food security is very very important. ? DUR?N		 4 ? 46 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Sidi Fofana of the horticultural processing plant in Banjulunding, The Gambia. Transcript Fofana	Whatever you process if you do not put food hygiene and sanitation as your priority number one, your end product will be poor. So when we want to produce or process any raw material, we have to look at the quality first. The maturity, the ripeness and it is free of chemicals also and also damage. So that is why when we received our raw material we have to check the quality first, to check whether it meets our standard. Then we wash the fruits or vegetables thoroughly with clean water so that we minimise the chemical residue on the produce, at the same time to reduce the microbial load. Studio	But for a food processing operation to produce a safe, clean product, free from harmful bacteria or microbes, it is important not only to select and wash the raw materials. The building and equipment must be clean, and staff must also maintain high levels of hygiene. Fofana	Every day when the trainees come they start cleaning first before processing. So we try to clean all the places, our windows even the store floors, everywhere. So we have to make sure that we put the hygiene in a place number one before we start any processing. That is why you see our floor is very clean even you cannot see any dust here on the floor. And also our utensils, we wash them thoroughly because we use the detergent and disinfectant here. Then we have the machines here which we wash them; every day prior to processing we have to clean them, wash them thoroughly using the detergent and disinfectant. And also all the trainees also are supplied with gloves, uniform and mask also during the processing. Before they start processing they have to wash their hands thoroughly with clean water and soap. Senghore	In other words you ensure there is bodily hygiene because if you are handling food you have to be clean yourself as well as the utensils and the environment. Fofana	Yes because that is personal hygiene. Even if anybody gets an injury so she will not be allowed to participate in processing on that day until she recovers, because we do not want cross-contamination from the food handler to our product. Studio	Another important rule is that any water used in the processing ? for example in the making of juice ? should be boiled first to kill harmful bacteria, also known as pathogenic micro-organisms. Fofana	We have a water supply here but the water we use in food processing also here we boil it thoroughly to destroy pathogenic micro-organisms there because we do not use cold water or we do not use that water directly to our processing plant. We just have to make sure to boil them above even 100 degrees Celsius for 15 minutes to destroy pathogenic micro-organisms. And also pasteurisation: during the processing we pasteurise our juice so that they will be at least free of pathogenic micro-organisms. Senghore	Yes and your bottles are also kept clean I am sure. As I see you have them here nicely labeled with different names and pictures of the contents. Fofana	Yes because the packaging material also we normally wash them thoroughly. We have a <b>bottle</b> <b>washing</b> machine over there, whereby we wash our bottles thoroughly and after washing them we put them in the oven, we leave them for almost half an hour or even more then that, just to heat them a little bit so that is to minimise microbial load there before we fill them with any products. But the lids, we check them thoroughly, to make sure that the lids are not dirty. So we have to make sure. And even the glass bottles you have to check that they are free of cracks or other things, because glass bottles normally they are recycled you can use them at anytime. But the lids you have to look at them critically. This is very very important for us. We do put emphasis on that. Senghore	Now what is the feedback that you get from them and yourself I am sure you must have tasted some of your juice? Fofana	Yes they are very very delicious. I feel before you leave you will taste some of the product here because they are very delicious. So people are very very interested because this is a model in the country. This type of plant will minimise the post-harvest losses in our country. Right now when you go out you see the watermelon abundant and the same thing likewise during the mango season, peak season you see the fruits wasting in the street, and even the producers when they go to the market they sell them at the lowest, at the cheapest price. But when we have this type of plant at least it will minimise post-harvest losses. So producers will bring their raw material here and we buy it from them, we process into different products and then at the end when they are not available then people consume them. Because food security is very very important. End of track. Sidi Fofana, coordinator and trainer at the Banjulunding food processing plant in The Gambia explains the detailed procedures needed to maintain hygiene in the plant...|$|E
