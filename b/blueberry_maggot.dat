50|$|The Lonicera fly, {{a hybrid}} in the genus Rhagoletis, is a North American fruit fly {{of the family}} Tephritidae. Its larvae feed on the berries of species of {{introduced}} honeysuckle (Lonicera) that were brought to America within the last 250 years as ornamental plants. A research team led by Dietmar Schwarz has argued that it most likely developed within that time by hybridization of two other species: R. mendax, the <b>blueberry</b> <b>maggot,</b> and R. zephyria, the snowberry maggot. Few cases of animal species arising from hybridization are known (see pomarine jaeger or Mariana mallard), although with DNA analysis more are being found.|$|E
5000|$|Rhagoletis mendax is {{a species}} of tephritid fruit fly known by the common name <b>{{blueberry}}</b> <b>maggot.</b> It is a major pest of blueberry crops in the eastern and southern United States and eastern Canada. It attacks several species of blueberry and related plants. The larva is 5 to 8 millimeters long and white with tiny black mouthparts. The adult fly is slightly smaller, and mostly black in color with white stripes, orange-red eyes, and black-banded wings. The fly is destructive to fruit when it is a larva. The adult female fly lays a single egg in a blueberry, and when the larva hatches it consumes the fruit, usually finishing the entire berry in under three weeks. The larva then falls into the soil and pupates. Adult flies emerge, mate, and oviposit when blueberry plants are producing fruit. Each female fly lays 25 to 100 eggs.|$|E

40|$|Three {{agricultural}} pests, {{cabbage maggot}} fly Delia radicum (L.), cabbage aphid Brevicoryne brassicae (L.) and the <b>blueberry</b> <b>maggot</b> fly Rhagoletis mendax (Curran) were investigated for potential control through behavioral modification. Synthetic and organic mulches were evaluated in broccoli fields {{for control of}} D. radicum and B. brassicae {{as well as their}} impact on other insects. Soil Guard in its standard yellow color and enhanced with yellow paint were both significantly more attractive to B. brassicae than unmulched control plots. However, when Soil Guard was painted blue, a level of control comparable to that of diazinon was obtained for D. radicum. Weed fabric significantly reduced weed populations, but flea beetle levels in those plots were six times higher than controls. ^ A sensitive trap-lure system was evaluated for monitoring <b>blueberry</b> <b>maggot</b> fly populations. Yellow, green, red, and blue spheres (9 cm diameter) were equal to or better than Pherocon AM yellow boards in attracting <b>blueberry</b> <b>maggot</b> flies. Traps baited with ammonia were significantly more attractive than unbaited traps. More female than male flies were captured on ammonia baited traps which is consistent with findings that Rhagoletis spp. female flies seek a protein source for egg maturation. ^ Varietal trials and blueberry volatiles were evaluated for various blueberry cultivars. Eighteen highbush blueberry, Vaccinium corymbosum L., cultivars were evaluated for larval infestation by R. mendax. Significantly fewer maggots were found in berries of early-ripening cultivars, than in later maturing cultivars. The oviposition period of R. mendax is synchronized with the ripening dates of mid-season cultivars in Rhode Island. ^ In 1997, we evaluated the attraction of <b>blueberry</b> <b>maggot</b> flies to blueberry volatiles at various load-rates. The effect of sphere sizes on the capture of bluebefly maggot flies was also investigated. R. mendax flies were attracted to a volatile blend at load-rates of 0. 1 and 0. 3 mg. Load-rates 3 ̆c 0. 03 mg and 3 ̆e 1. 0 mg were not significantly different from controls. More females than males were attracted to volatile blends and volatiles emanating from ripe blueberries. Among the 3 sphere sizes tested, the baited 9 -cm sphere was the most efficient sphere and should be used for monitoring R. mendax. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Both {{phytophagous}} and parasitic insects deposit oviposition-marking pheromones (OMPs) following ovipo-sition {{that function}} to inform conspecifics of a previously utilized host of reduced suitability. The <b>blueberry</b> <b>maggot</b> fly, Rhagoletis mendax Curran (Diptera: Tephritidae), deposits eggs individually into blueberries and then marks the fruit surface with an OMP which reduces acceptance of fruit for oviposition by conspecifics. Diachasma alloeum (Muesebeck) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) is a parasitic wasp attacking larval R. mendax which also deposits an OMP, signaling conspecifics of a wasp-occupied host. Behavioral studies were conducted testing {{the hypothesis that}} the OMP of the parasitic wasp modifies the oviposition behavior of its host fly. In this study, we show that the OMP of D. alloeum is recognized by R. mendax, and female flies will reject wasp-marked fruit for oviposition. Thus, we present a rare demonstration of pheromonal recognition between animals occupying different taxonomic orders and trophic levels. This chemical eavesdropping may enhance the ability of the fly to avoid fruit unsuitable for larval development...|$|E
40|$|The genus Rhagoletis Loew {{includes}} about 65 known species {{distributed throughout}} Europe, Asia and America. Most species are oligophagous, attacking {{only a few}} closely related host plants. The European cherry fruit fly R. cerasi is the economically most important pest species in Europe. R. batava and R. alternata can also cause economic damage in Europe. In addition to these species, the American cherry fruit fly species R. cingulata, R. indifferens and R. fausta, {{as well as the}} apple maggot R. pomonella, the <b>blueberry</b> <b>maggot</b> R. mendax, and the walnut infesting species R. completa and R. suavis are pest insects of high economic importance. R. cingulata and R. completa were recently introduced to Europe and are currently spreading in Central Europe. A lot of research was conducted on integrated control of the European cherry fruit fly R. cerasi during the past hundred years. For the monitoring of flight period of R. cerasi yellow sticky traps are used. This method was shown to give reliable results for the timing of application. However, an economic threshold cannot be determined with yellow sticky traps, because fruit infestation is also influenced by crop load and weather conditions during oviposition period of flies. Chemical control (Insecticides) of R. cerasi is currently impeded by the withdrawal of “old” organophoshporus compounds (Dimethoate) and the debate on side-effects of neonicotinoids. Attract-and-kill strategies are available or under development: food baits (based on yeast hydrolysate and sugar) are mixed with the organic insecticides Spinosad or Neem. The baits attract the flies, stimulate feeding and thus increase uptake of the insecticide. However, the efficacy of attract-and-kill strategies strongly depends on the attractiveness of the bait which is influenced by climate conditions. Mass trapping by yellow sticky traps combined with baits is used for cherry fruit fly control in home-gardens. However, due to the high number of traps needed to achieve good control, this strategy is too expensive for commercial production. The use of kaolin as mechanical barrier on the fruit surface to prevent oviposition was shown to be effective against R. indifferens and R. mendax. Because kaolin treatments leave white residues on fruit, this method is not used against cherry fruit fly. Recently, it was shown that oil products can also prevent oviposition by creating a slippery layer on the fruit surface. A biocontrol method using the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana has been developed and is currently registered in serveral European countries (product Naturalis-L). This strategy is mainly used in organic production. Another biocontrol strategy could be the use of parasitoids. However, the use of larval parasitoids is hampered by the steadily increasing fruit size of cherries for fresh consumption: parasitoids are no longer able to reach the larvae {{in the center of the}} cherry fruit. The use of crop netting to protect trees is the currently most widely used method of cherry fruit fly control. With the increasing number of dwarf tree cherry orchards covered against rain to avoid fruit splitting, it has become a viable, cost-effective method of cherry fruit fly control. However, for high standard trees this method is not suitable. In this situation, the use of nets for soil covering (to avoid hatching of flies from overwintering pupae in the soil) can be used...|$|E
