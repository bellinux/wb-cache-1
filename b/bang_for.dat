25|$|The game {{opened up}} with a <b>bang</b> <b>for</b> the Hawkeyes, as C.J. Jones took the opening kickoff 100-yards for the touchdown. But as it turns out, {{it would be the}} only time until late in the fourth quarter that the Hawkeyes would see the endzone. Although the game was tied at halftime, USC blocked Iowa's last-second field goal, {{preventing}} a possible Iowa lead at the half. From there, Heisman winner Carson Palmer went to work. The senior quarterback threw for over 300 yards against the Big Ten's worst passing defense and led scoring drives of 79, 80, 99, 85 and 61 yards as the Trojans held a 16-minute advantage in time of possession. The USC defense was suffocating and Iowa's miscues were proof. The Hawkeyes had two turnovers, 13 penalties, and multiple missed opportunities.|$|E

500|$|Offering similar {{equipment}} {{levels to}} the SV6, the Commodore SS uses the 6.0-litre V8 engine and T-56 six-speed manual transmission. The SS is recognisable from its quad exhaust outlets {{in place of}} the SV6 dual outlets. The resulting specification level is much higher than the outgoing minimalist SV8 and only missing a few cosmetic touches of the previous flagship Commodore SS. Since its release, the SS has won two consecutive (2006 and 2007) <b>Bang</b> <b>For</b> Your Bucks awards, a Motor magazine initiative. The judges gave preference to the SS the second-time-round because [...] "the VE Commodore SS really does represent the biggest bang you'll ever get for your bucks like these." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Mass Effect 2: Kasumi - Stolen Memory" [...] {{received}} generally mixed reviews, {{with most}} critics criticizing the pack's short length.

At roughly an hour in length, this is one download that doesn't offer a lot of <b>bang</b> <b>for</b> your buck." [...] Writing for GameSpot, Kevin VanOrd felt that the character of Kasumi is not interesting and that the mission is too short for her character development compared to the squad members of the base game. Similarly, GameCritics reviewer Brad Gallaway criticized the fact that players cannot directly interact with her once the mission is completed.|$|E
500|$|Michael Ordoña of the Los Angeles Times {{gave it a}} {{positive}} review, noting the slower cut of the film and saying [...] "the action is easier to read than in most films of the genre, and therefore more enjoyable.

Phelim O'Neill of The Guardian gave the film two stars out of five praising the use of 3D, while stating that the Resident Evil films [...] "always look good and have well-staged action, but they don't have one iota of originality or imagination". Chicago Readers Andrea Gronvall described the plot as [...] "nearly indiscernible" [...] but did call the film the [...] "sleekest so far, thanks to 3D and star Milla Jovovich's body-hugging catsuit".|$|E

500|$|Some reviewers did {{not like}} the expansion's repetitiveness, and Nic Rowen (Destructoid) was {{disappointed}} with the lack of uniqueness in the release. Chad Sapieha (Post Arcade) said that he was growing weary of the repetitive small tasks like managing loot, and traveling between settlements just to dispose of it; he added that he was done with Fallout 4 and its DLC and was prepared to move onto a further installment. David Soriano (IGN) commended the extensive size of the map but felt it was somewhat wasted. Alice Bell (VideoGamer.com) and the reviewers at GameCentral praised the value for money: Bell said that Far Harbor was the best of the first three expansion packs for getting [...] "the most <b>bang</b> <b>for</b> your buck", even taking into account the design flaws.|$|E
500|$|April 4 {{also saw}} the {{announcement}} of two new downloadable content packs for the coming weeks: an [...] "Orrery" [...] quest that would see gamers setting out to repair a Dwarven Orrery; and a [...] "Wizard's Tower" [...] that would offer a new home for player characters, complete with the capacity to grow herbs, summon atronachs, and make spells. 1UP predicted that, given Bethesda's response to customer criticism, those releases would be somewhat more substantial than the [...] "Horse Armor" [...] release was. On April 7, Bethesda priced the [...] "Orrery". Offering what GameSpot called [...] "more <b>bang</b> <b>for</b> less buck", Bethesda set the PC release price at US$1.89, and the Xbox 360 release price at 150 Marketplace points, equivalent to US$1.88. Joystiq offered their support—"'Big ups'"—to the company for the new price. [...] "Although we passed on the $2.50 horse armor this week, we'll definitely be messin' with that Orrery device when it hits the Marketplace." [...] The pack was eventually released on April 17. Also on April 7, EB Games and GameStop began offering a coupon promising one free download of the [...] "Horse Armor" [...] pack with every purchase of the PC edition of Oblivion.

500|$|Response to Episode One was {{generally}} positive, and reviewers praised {{the game for}} having more intricate, well-paced gameplay than Half-Life 2. The game's interactivity, particularly {{in the form of}} Alyx and her reactions to the player's actions and the events of the game, was also singled out for praise. PC Gamer commented that [...] "while this inaugural episode may not be the essential FPS that Half-Life2 is, I can't imagine any shooter fan who'd want to miss it." [...] In its review, PC Gamer UK directed particular praise to the balance between puzzle-oriented and action-oriented challenges throughout the game. In Australia, the magazine PC PowerPlay awarded the game 10 out of 10. Edge praised the [...] "deftness" [...] with which the game was able to direct the player's eyes, and the strength of Alyx as a companion, concluding, [...] "In an interactive genre bound to the traditions of the pop-up gun and invisible hero, it simply doesn't get more sophisticated than this." [...] Episode One earned a scores of 87/100 and 85.59% on review aggregators Metacritic and GameRankings respectively. IGN awarded Episode One with the title of [...] "Best PC FPS of 2006" [...] and described it as a [...] "great <b>bang</b> <b>for</b> the buck using Valve's new episodic plan", although it did not offer [...] "the complete experience that Half-Life2 was". GameSpy ranked Episode One ninth on its 2006 [...] "Games of the Year" [...] list, and it also noted the implementation of Alyx as a believable and useful companion.|$|E

500|$|The Los Angeles Times said, [...] " [...] overstuffed with plot lines, set {{pieces and}} villains, {{although}} stars Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone {{do their best}} to give the movie heart." [...] Tim Robey of The Telegraph said, [...] "Marc Webb's Spider-Man sequel is overstuffed with high-voltage villains, but the sparks between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone save the day". Simon Reynolds of Digital Spy said, [...] "Peter's past, present and future all intertwine in a sequel that offers <b>bang</b> <b>for</b> your buck. That said you can't help [...] feel the franchise bean counters at work here thanks to all the ominous foreshadowing and unresolved character arcs. Too many cooks and all that...". Kim Newman of Empire scored the film three out of five stars, saying: [...] "A few too-broad gags aside — and even these are in the funky spirit of '60s Marvel — this is a satisfying second issue with thrills, heartbreak, gasps, and a perfectly judged slingshot ending." [...] Leslie Felperin of The Hollywood Reporter said, [...] "The eponymous hero hits his super-heroic stride here, as does Andrew Garfield in the role, especially when Spider-Man's alter ego Peter Parker learns there's always some fine print in a contract with this many benefits. The plot gets itself tangled up in multiple villain strands, but in the main, this installment is emotionally weightier and more satisfying than its predecessor." [...] Guy Lodge of Variety said, [...] "Redundancy remains a problem, but this overlong superhero sequel gets by on sound, fury and star chemistry." [...] Richard Roeper gave the film a B+, stating that [...] "It's about 20 minutes too long and it's overstuffed with too many characters and too many subplots, but there's enough good stuff in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 to warrant optimism about the next chapter of the franchise." [...] A negative review came from Peter Travers of Rolling Stone, giving the film two stars out of four, he said: [...] "Things go wrong quickly with Amazing 2. Am I the only one who hates the word Amazing to describe a movie that isn't? Just asking." [...] IGN reviewer Daniel Krupa gave 6.9/10 and wrote, [...] "Amazing Spider-Man 2 gets a lot right, yet there’s a constant awkwardness to the machinery of its plot; you can almost hear the cogs turning. However, what’s worse is that at times it becomes overtly patronising: there are flashing screens and computer voice-overs constantly telling you what something is or what something is doing, just in case the people in the back rows aren’t paying attention, which feels at odds with the film’s emotional intelligence.|$|E
