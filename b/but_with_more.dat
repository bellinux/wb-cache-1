5|$|T-26K K=Koulutus (Instruction): Finnish variant {{used for}} driver training. Similar to the T-26T {{artillery}} tractor, <b>but</b> <b>with</b> <b>more</b> boxy superstructure. 5 built from captured T-26s from 1947 to 1952.|$|E
5|$|In December 1966, the Army asked Bell {{to prepare}} a {{detailed}} deployment concept combining the light defense of Nth Country with the point defense of Hardsite. On 17 January 1967, this became the I-67 project, which delivered its results on 5 July. I-67 was essentially Nth Country <b>but</b> <b>with</b> <b>more</b> bases near Minuteman fields, armed primarily with Sprint. The wide-area Zeus and short-range Sprint bases would both be supported by the PAR network.|$|E
5|$|In England's second innings, Gooch {{played a}} lone hand. With the {{exception}} of Foster (34), promoted as nightwatchman {{at the end of}} day two, no-one else passed 15. When Gooch was last man out for 84 on the third day, England had compiled 202. The England bowlers managed to restrain the West Indian batsmen, Childs notably bowling 40 overs for just 79 runs, <b>but,</b> <b>with</b> <b>more</b> than two days left to play, there was little pressure on the West Indies, and they strolled to victory in 91 overs, losing just two wickets, with more than a day to spare.|$|E
5000|$|C3+/A3+: Same C3/A3, <b>but</b> <b>with</b> longer, <b>more</b> {{dangerous}} fall potential.|$|R
50|$|Often {{described}} as a raven with a sore throat, it has very similar calls to the common raven, <b>but</b> <b>with</b> a <b>more</b> husky note. It has a croak like the other raven species <b>but</b> <b>with</b> a <b>more</b> whispering note. Like all corvids, the White-necked raven is capable of vocal mimicry. However, this behavior is only ever recorded in captivity.|$|R
50|$|He {{has been}} {{compared}} to Carl Perkins, <b>but</b> <b>with</b> a <b>more</b> modern sensibility.|$|R
5|$|Oslo {{maintains}} a street tram system with six lines, of which two are suburban lines. The street trams operate mostly within {{the borders of}} the Ring Line, providing a frequent service in the city centre, with lower average speeds <b>but</b> <b>with</b> <b>more</b> stops. There are major transfer points to the tramway at Majorstuen, Jernbanetorget, Jar, Storo and Forskningsparken.|$|E
5|$|Owing {{to several}} {{academic}} commitments, work on Theory of Literature {{did not begin}} until 1945, after Wellek and Warren received a stipend from the Rockefeller Foundation {{over a period of}} two summers. Wellek and Warren began dividing their responsibilities, at first evenly, <b>but</b> <b>with</b> <b>more</b> work done by Wellek as Warren dealt with the illness, and later loss, of his wife Eleanor in 1946. During this period of writing Wellek transferred to Yale University (1946) and Warren to the University of Michigan (1948), but collaboration continued.|$|E
5|$|The camas {{pocket gopher}} is, {{by a small}} margin, the largest member of its genus (Thomomys). The fur is a dull brown above and dark, leaden gray beneath. There are often patches of white on the chin, throat and around the anus, and it has blackish ear and nose markings. The {{external}} ear is a thickened rim of tissue. During the summer, the gopher's coat is short and coarse; winter pelage is longer and furrier. The coat of the young {{is similar to the}} adult summer coat, <b>but</b> <b>with</b> <b>more</b> sparsely distributed fur; the abdominal skin may be visible.|$|E
50|$|It has {{the same}} tracks as Greatest Hits, <b>but</b> <b>with</b> two <b>more</b> tracks.|$|R
5000|$|TOML is {{inspired}} by [...]INI file syntax, <b>but</b> <b>with</b> a <b>more</b> formal specification.|$|R
50|$|Fluocortin is a corticosteroid. It {{is similar}} to fluocortolone, <b>but</b> <b>with</b> one <b>more</b> keto group.|$|R
5|$|The {{simplest}} molluscan {{reproductive system}} relies on external fertilization, <b>but</b> <b>with</b> <b>more</b> complex variations. All produce eggs, from which may emerge trochophore larvae, more complex veliger larvae, or miniature adults. Two gonads {{sit next to}} the coelom, a small cavity that surrounds the heart, into which they shed ova or sperm. The nephridia extract the gametes from the coelom and emit them into the mantle cavity. Molluscs that use such a system remain of one sex all their lives and rely on external fertilization. Some molluscs use internal fertilization and/or are hermaphrodites, functioning as both sexes; both of these methods require more complex reproductive systems.|$|E
5|$|While {{the party}} did not {{maintain}} a full slate of policy positions, its candidates advocated {{for increasing the}} number of police in Richmond, especially along the SkyTrain route, protection of green spaces, support for affordable housing, and trade missions with China. They were generally in favour of lower taxes <b>but</b> <b>with</b> <b>more</b> spending on senior services and education. In the 2009 provincial election they campaigned against the carbon tax which the governing BC Liberal Party had implemented the previous year.|$|E
5|$|Space Invaders {{was created}} by Tomohiro Nishikado, who spent a year {{designing}} the game and developing the necessary hardware to produce it. The game's inspiration {{is reported to have}} come from varying sources, including an adaptation of the mechanical game Space Monsters released by Taito in 1972, and a dream about Japanese school children who are waiting for Santa Claus and are attacked by invading aliens. However, Nishikado has cited Atari's arcade game Breakout as his inspiration. He aimed to create a shooting game that featured the same sense of achievement from completing stages and destroying targets, <b>but</b> <b>with</b> <b>more</b> complex graphics. Nishikado used a similar layout to that of Breakout but altered the game mechanics. Rather than bounce a ball to attack static objects, players are given the ability to fire projectiles at their own discretion to attack moving enemies.|$|E

5|$|The Army {{decided that}} an {{individual}} machine gun, lighter than the M60, <b>but</b> <b>with</b> <b>more</b> firepower than the M16, would be advantageous; troops {{would no longer have}} to rely on rifles for automatic fire. Through the 1960s, the introduction of a machine gun into the infantry squad was examined in various studies. While there was a brief flirtation with the concept of a flechette- or dart-firing Universal Machine Gun during one study, most light machine gun experiments concentrated on the Stoner 63 light machine gun, a modular weapon that could be easily modified for different purposes. The Stoner63 LMG saw combat for a brief period in Vietnam with the Marine Corps, and later on a wider scale with the U.S. Navy SEALs.|$|E
5|$|The plumage is {{generally}} light gray-brown and lighter and pinkish below. The wings have black spotting, {{and the outer}} tail feathers are white, contrasting with the black inners. Below the eye is a distinctive crescent-shaped area of dark feathers. The eyes are dark, with light skin surrounding them. The adult male has bright purple-pink patches on the neck sides, with light pink coloring reaching the breast. The crown of the adult male is a distinctly bluish-grey color. Females are similar in appearance, <b>but</b> <b>with</b> <b>more</b> brown coloring overall and a little smaller than the male. The iridescent feather patches on the neck above the shoulders are nearly absent, but can be quite vivid on males. Juvenile birds have a scaly appearance, and are generally darker.|$|E
