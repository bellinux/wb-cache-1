A platoon of the 1st Independent Company left Port Moresby in the schooner Royal Endeavour and traversed the route, joining {{the men of the}} New Guinea Volunteer Rifles holding the Wau area. This was the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> became Kanga Force on 23 April 1942. On 22 May, the 21st Troop Carrier Squadron USAAF flew in commandos of the 2/5th Independent Company to join Kanga Force. The 2/7th Independent Company followed in October 1942.|$|E
5|$|Belgicas voyage {{marked the}} <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> {{became known as}} the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration, and was rapidly {{followed}} by expeditions from the United Kingdom, Sweden, Germany and France. However, on his return to Norway in 1899, Amundsen turned his attention northwards. Confident in his abilities to lead an expedition, he planned a traversal of the Northwest Passage, the then-uncharted sea route from the Atlantic to the Pacific through the labyrinth of north Canadian islands. Having earned his master's ticket, Amundsen acquired a small sloop, Gjøa, which he adapted for Arctic travel. He secured the patronage of King Oscar of Sweden and Norway, the support of Nansen, and sufficient financial backing to set out in June 1903 with a crew of six. The voyage lasted until 1906 and was wholly successful; the Northwest Passage, which defeated mariners for centuries, was finally conquered. At the age of 34 Amundsen became a national hero, in the first rank of polar explorers.|$|E
5|$|The US Navy {{ended the}} Civil War with about fifty monitor-type coastal ironclads; by the 1870s {{most of these}} were laid up in reserve, leaving the USA {{virtually}} without an ironclad fleet. Another five large monitors were ordered in the 1870s. The limitations of the monitor type effectively prevented the USA from projecting power overseas, and until the 1890s the USA would have come off badly in a conflict with even Spain or the Latin American powers. The 1890s saw the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> became the Great White Fleet, {{and it was the}} modern pre-Dreadnoughts and armored cruisers built in the 1890s which defeated the Spanish fleet in the Spanish–American War of 1898. This started a new era of naval warfare.|$|E

25|$|Santa Barbara's {{aviation}} history {{began in}} 1914 when Lincoln J. Beachey flew an airplane across Goleta Valley. Two {{years later the}} Loughead brothers, who later changed their name to Lockheed, established a seaplane factory on State Street (Alco Hydro-Aeroplane Company) and constructed a wooden ramp on West Beach to launch their planes. In 1928, Gordon Sackett and Royce Stetson landed a Hisso-powered airplane in a cow pasture near the corner of Hollister and Fairview Avenues {{and set up a}} flight school on the spot. That first airstrip marked the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was to become the Santa Barbara Municipal Airport.|$|E
25|$|Conscious that Poland lacked {{allies and}} risked war against {{most of its}} {{neighbours}} (a situation similar to the Deluge), by 1683 Sobieski allied himself with Leopold I, of the Holy Roman Empire. Both sides promised to come to one's another aid if their capitals were threatened. The alliance was signed by royal representatives on 31 March 1683, and ratified by the Emperor and Polish parliament within weeks. Although aimed directly against the Ottomans and indirectly against France, it {{had the advantage of}} gaining internal support for the defense of Poland's southern borders. This was a <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> would become the Holy League, championed by Pope Innocent XI to preserve Christendom.|$|E

25|$|The Lombards {{remained}} {{a threat to}} papal power, however, until they were crushed by Charlemagne in 774. Charlemagne added the Kingdom of the Lombards to his vast realm. In recognition of Charlemagne's power, and to cement the church's alliance with him, Charlemagne was crowned emperor of the Romans by Pope Leo III in 800. After Charlemagne's death in 814, his son Louis the Pious succeeded him. Louis divided the empire among his sons, who fought each other for territory. Such battles continued until Otto the Great, the king of Germany, was crowned emperor in 962. This marked the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> later was called the Holy Roman Empire.|$|E
25|$|The {{ratification}} of the 18th amendment to the Constitution in 1919 made the production and sale (including exportation) of alcoholic beverages illegal in the United States. This ushered in the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> {{is known as the}} Gangster Era, a time that roughly spans from 1919 until 1933 when Prohibition was repealed. The 1920s saw gangsters, including Al Capone, Dion O'Banion, Bugs Moran and Tony Accardo battle law enforcement and each other on the streets of Chicago during the Prohibition era. Chicago was the location of the infamous St. Valentine's Day Massacre in 1929, when Al Capone sent men to gun down members of his rival gang, North Side, led by Bugs Moran.|$|E
25|$|The Byzantine Empire {{was one of}} {{the first}} empires to have flourishing medical establishments. Prior to the Byzantine Empire the Roman Empire had {{hospitals}} specifically for soldiers and slaves. However, none of these establishments were for the public. The hospitals in Byzantium were originally started by the church to act as a place for the poor to have access to basic amenities. Hospitals were usually separated between men and women. Although the remains of these hospitals have not been discovered by archaeologists, recordings of hospitals from the Byzantine Empire describe large buildings that had the core feature of an open hearth. The establishments of the Byzantine Empire resembled the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> we now know as modern hospitals.|$|E

However, concerned that the bypassed Germans would flood {{much of the nation}} and cause complete famine among a Dutch population already near starvation, General Eisenhower approved an agreement with the local enemy commanders to allow the Allies to air-drop food into the country in return for a local ceasefire on the battlefield. The ensuing airdrops, which began on 29 April, marked the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was to become a colossal effort to put war-torn Europe back together again.|$|E
25|$|Gikai's return {{marked the}} <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> {{is known as}} the sandai sōron, a schism that would split Dōgen's {{community}} into multiple competing factions. Because Gikai had an interest in architecture and had recorded temple constructions during his time in China, Ejō allowed him {{to take control of the}} ongoing building projects at Eihei-ji. In 1267, Ejō had become ill and decided to retire as abbot. He moved out of Eihei-ji to a nearby location, but continued to be considered the tōdōi, a rank for retired abbots. Two monks, Bussō and Dōson, are even said to have attained enlightenment under him during his stay outside the temple. At any rate, his health had improved within a short time of leaving Eihei-ji.|$|E

He lived at his father's vacant palace {{and then at the}} Beloselsky-Belozersky Palace, which he had {{inherited}} from Grand Duke Sergey and would become his principal residence before the Russian Revolution. He prepared to enter the Nikolaevskoe Cavalry School. Upon graduation, he was commissioned as a cornet in the Horse Guards Regiment, which his father had once commanded and in which he had been enrolled at birth. He is reputed to have been a very good equestrian, and he competed in the 1912 Stockholm Olympics, coming seventh. Before World War I, he instigated the idea of a national Russian sports competition, the very <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> under Soviet rule became the Spartakiad.|$|E

25|$|In 1808 a British {{expeditionary force}} under John Moore arrived in Sweden, but {{after months of}} idleness {{departed}} for the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> {{became known as the}} Peninsular War. Had the king accepted the landing of 10,000 British troops in Skåne, where the expeditionary force had been authorized to disembark, it would have enabled the Swedes to release at least 10,000 trained soldiers for the Finnish War. As it happened, the bulk of the Swedish army, including the best units, were kept out of the Finnish War by the king, who reserved them for his plans for conquering either Sjælland or Norway. Swedish landings were invariably made with poorly equipped and trained forces, often with troops who had very low morale. Landings were further complicated by the Swedish Navy's failure to tightly block the coastal sea route past Hangö.|$|E

In 2005, the Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, announced the government's intention to resume the military parade past the GPO from Easter 2006, and to form a committee to plan centenary celebrations in 2016. The 90th anniversary was celebrated with a military parade in Dublin on Easter Sunday, 2006, attended by the President of Ireland, the Taoiseach and the Lord Mayor of Dublin. There is now an annual ceremony at Easter attended by relatives of those who fought, by the President, the Taoiseach, ministers, senators and TDs, and by usually large and respectful crowds.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, the Syrian army {{intervened in}} the Lebanese civil war {{to ensure that}} the status quo was maintained, and the Maronite Christians {{remained}} in power.

Many crimes in Lebanon, including the accused assassinations of Rafik Hariri, Kamal Jumblat and Bachir Gemayel were attributed to the Syrian forces and intelligence services although were not proven to this day. In 1981 Israel declared its annexation of the Golan Heights. The following year, Israel invaded Lebanon and attacked the Syrian army, forcing it to withdraw from several areas. When Lebanon and Israel announced the end of hostilities in 1983, Syrian forces remained in Lebanon. Through extensive use of proxy militias, Syria attempted to stop Israel from taking over southern Lebanon. Assad sent troops into Lebanon for a second time in 1987 to enforce a ceasefire in Beirut.|$|E
