40|$|Many supply chains {{have grown}} {{increasingly}} complex, {{which has led}} to the development of different facility types. One such facility is known as a post-distribution cross docking system (Post-C). In these facilities, bulk sorted product is received from various suppliers. Each product has its own destination, so the <b>bulk</b> <b>package</b> is broken, sorted by destination, and staged by destination. Typical processing includes: sort received goods by product type; break bulk and sort out goods by destination; move palletized goods to the staging areas of their respective destinations. This paper compares a global staffing policy (in which all workers may perform any task) to a dedicated staffing policy (in which groups of workers are assigned specific tasks). Through comparisons of the two models, it was found the dedicated worker model’s benefits from reduced change-over outweigh the lower worker utilization it experiences...|$|E
40|$|By postponing {{the packing}} of {{consumer}} electronics (CE) products into their final consumer package, until after long-distance transportation, substantial economic savings and environmental improvements can be achieved, due to higher efficiency during transportation. In such a case, long-distance transportation {{is done in}} multiple or <b>bulk</b> <b>packages.</b> Literature presents {{only a limited number}} of examples of <b>bulk</b> <b>packaging</b> for CE goods, all with the goal of economic savings obtained through maintaining flexibility in the supply chain. The logic of environmental improvement by using <b>bulk</b> <b>packaging</b> is based on including transport efficiency as a criterion in the environmental assessment of packaging concepts. This is a new approach as until now literature and practice in eco-design of packaging have focused on resource conservation and recycling. <b>Bulk</b> <b>packaging</b> can be applied in different ways. Which way is most successful depends on the type of product, the mode of distribution, the transportation distance, the size of the production run and the prices of material and labor.

40|$|Background: The {{choice between}} unit-of-use versus {{traditional}} <b>bulk</b> <b>packaging</b> in the US {{has long been}} a continuous debate for drug manufacturers and pharmacies in order to have the most efficient and safest practices. Understanding the benefits of using unit-of-use <b>packaging</b> over <b>bulk</b> <b>packaging</b> by US drug manufacturers in terms of workflow efficiency, economical costs and medication safety in the pharmacy is sometimes challenging. Methods: A time-saving study comparing the time saved using unit-of-use <b>packaging</b> versus <b>bulk</b> <b>packaging,</b> was examined. Prices between unit-of-use versus <b>bulk</b> <b>packages</b> were compared by using the Red Book: Pharmacy’s Fundamental Reference. Other articles were reviewed on the topics of counterfeiting, safe labeling, and implementation of unit-of-use packaging. Lastly, a cost-saving study was reviewed showing how medication adherence, due to improved packaging, could be cost-effective for patients. Results: When examining time, costs, medication adherence, and counterfeiting arguments, unit-of-use packaging proved to be beneficial for patients in all these terms...|$|R

40|$|Broadly defined, {{open access}} makes {{scholarly}} materials accessible to users at no cost. More specifically, {{the term is}} used to describe a model of scholarly communication in which users may freely view, download, copy, and print scholarly articles, books, conference proceedings, squibs, and so forth. Such a model is {{in stark contrast to}} existing models of scholarly communication in that many of the most widely-used peer-reviewed journals are accessible to libraries primarily through expensive <b>bulk</b> <b>package</b> plans, forcing libraries to pay top-dollar for the resources their faculties require. In so doing, libraries add to their collections a number of rarely-used journals of minimal impact and value simply because they were bundled in with the journals they could not do without: a model not unlike those provided by the local cable company – i. e., if one wants the Food Network, one is also saddled with the Golf Channel.

40|$|Forced-air cooling is {{the common}} method for {{precooling}} horticultural produce. Ventilated packaging systems are often used to facilitate cooling efficiency. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling system was developed to simulate airflow and heat transfer processes in the layered and <b>bulk</b> <b>packaging</b> systems during the forced-air cooling of fresh produce. Airflow and heat transfer models were developed using a porous media approach. The areas inside the packaging systems were categorised as solid, plain air, and produce-air regions. The produce-air regions inside the <b>bulk</b> <b>packages</b> or between trays in the layered packages were treated as porous media, in which the volume-average transport equations were employed. This approach avoids dealing with the situation-specific and complex geometries inside the packaging systems, and therefore enables {{the development of a}} general modelling system suitable {{for a wide range of}} packaging designs and produce. The calculation domains were discretised with a block-structured mesh system that was referenced by global and local grid systems. The global grid system specifies the positions of individual packages in a stack, and the local grid system describes the structural details inside individual package. The solution methods for airflow and heat transfer models were based on SIMPLER (Semi-Implicit Method for Pressure-Linked equations Revised) method schemes, and the systems of linear algebraic equations were solved with GMRES (Generalised Minimum Residual) method. A prototype software package CoolSimu was developed to implement the solution methods. The software package hid the core components (airflow and heat solvers) from user, so that the users without any knowledge of CFD and heat transfer can utilise the software to study cooling operations and package designs. The user interaction components in CoolSimu enable users to specify packaging systems and cooling conditions, control the simulation processes, and visualise the predicted airflow patterns and temperature profiles. When the predicted and measured product centre temperatures were compared during the forced-air cooling of fresh fruit in several layered and <b>bulk</b> <b>packaging</b> systems, good agreements between the model predictions and experimental data were obtained. Overall, the developed CFD modelling system predicted airflow patterns and temperature profiles with satisfactory accuracy...|$|R
