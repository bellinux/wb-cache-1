5|$|The {{first three}} {{chapters}} describe {{the various types}} of coral reef, each chapter starting with a section giving {{a detailed description of the}} reef Darwin had most information about, which he presents as a typical example of the type. Subsequent sections in each chapter then describe other reefs in comparison with the typical example. In the first chapter, Darwin describes atolls and lagoon islands, taking as his typical example his own detailed findings and the Beagle survey findings on the Keeling Islands. The second chapter similarly describes a typical <b>barrier</b> <b>reef</b> then compares it to others, and the third chapter gives a similar description of what Darwin called fringing or shore reefs. Having described the principal kinds of reef in detail, his finding was that the actual surface of the reef did not differ much. An atoll differs from an encircling <b>barrier</b> <b>reef</b> only in lacking the central island, and a <b>barrier</b> <b>reef</b> differs from a fringing reef only in its distance from the land and in enclosing a lagoon.|$|E
5|$|Darwin's theory {{followed}} {{from his}} understanding that coral polyps {{thrive in the}} clean seas of the tropics where the water is agitated, but can only live within a limited depth of water, starting just below low tide. Where {{the level of the}} underlying land stays the same, the corals grow around the coast to form what he called fringing reefs, and can eventually grow out from the shore to become a <b>barrier</b> <b>reef.</b> Where the land is rising, fringing reefs can grow around the coast, but coral raised above sea level dies and becomes white limestone. If the land subsides slowly, the fringing reefs keep pace by growing upwards on a base of dead coral, and form a <b>barrier</b> <b>reef</b> enclosing a lagoon between the reef and the land. A <b>barrier</b> <b>reef</b> can encircle an island, and once the island sinks below sea level a roughly circular atoll of growing coral continues {{to keep up with the}} sea level, forming a central lagoon. Should the land subside too quickly or sea level rise too fast, the coral dies as it is below its habitable depth.|$|E
50|$|<b>Barrier</b> <b>reefs,</b> {{over which}} the sea breaks heavily, extend 5 km north, 0.8 km east, and 2.4 km south of the island, making it a pseudo-atoll. Within the <b>barrier</b> <b>reefs,</b> the lagoon is quite smooth, and landing is safe and easy.|$|R
5000|$|Thermal {{subsidence}} {{can have}} an effect on island formation. Isostatic uplift can be balanced with thermal subsidence in response to erosion on islands without <b>barrier</b> <b>reefs,</b> which sink only when subjected to wave erosion. However, volcanic islands and seamounts with <b>barrier</b> <b>reefs</b> are shielded from wave and stream erosion, and thus the countervailing isostatic uplift is eliminated, causing them to subside and create an atoll.|$|R

5|$|Sponges with photosynthesizing endosymbionts produce up {{to three}} times more oxygen than they consume, {{as well as more}} organic matter than they consume. Such {{contributions}} to their habitats' resources are significant along Australia's Great <b>Barrier</b> <b>Reef</b> but relatively minor in the Caribbean.|$|E
5|$|Submarine springs found {{along the}} coast of Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula produce water with a {{naturally}} low pH (relatively high acidity) providing conditions similar to those expected to become widespread as the oceans absorb carbon dioxide. Surveys discovered multiple species of live coral that appeared to tolerate the acidity. The colonies were small and patchily distributed, and had not formed structurally complex reefs such as those that compose the nearby Mesoamerican <b>Barrier</b> <b>Reef</b> System.|$|E
5|$|The {{indigenous}} {{peoples of the}} Arctic such as the Chukchi, Inuit, Inuvialuit, and Yupik hunt marine mammals including seals and whales and the Torres Strait Islanders claim ownership of the Great <b>Barrier</b> <b>Reef.</b> They live a traditional life on the islands involving hunting, fishing, gardening, and trading with neighboring peoples in Papua New Guinea and Australia.|$|E
50|$|Many of the Great <b>Barrier</b> <b>Reef's</b> {{components}} are actually fringing reefs. Of the close to 3400 individual reefs, 760 are actually fringing reefs.|$|R

5|$|Bligh reached England in April 1790, whereupon the Admiralty {{despatched}} HMS Pandora {{to apprehend}} the mutineers. Fourteen were captured in Tahiti and imprisoned on board Pandora, which then searched without success for Christian's party that had hidden on Pitcairn Island. After turning back toward England, Pandora ran aground on the Great <b>Barrier</b> <b>Reef,</b> {{with the loss of}} 31 crew and 4 prisoners from Bounty. The 10 surviving detainees reached England in June 1792 and were court martialled; 4 were acquitted, 3 were pardoned, and 3 were hanged.|$|E
5|$|The roughtail {{stingray}} is broadly but discontinuously {{distributed in the}} coastal waters of the Atlantic Ocean. In the western Atlantic, it occurs from the Georges Bank off New England southward to Florida, the Bahamas, and the northeastern Gulf of Mexico; there are also scattered reports from Venezuela to Argentina and on the <b>Barrier</b> <b>reef</b> in Belize. In the eastern Atlantic, it occurs from the southern Bay of Biscay to Angola, including the Mediterranean Sea, Madeira, and the Canary Islands. A single record from Quilon, India was likely a misidentification.|$|E

5000|$|The Gulf of Honduras {{is marked}} by complex {{dynamics}} of coastal and open waters, and ocean currents, which have produced a very diverse and unique ecosystem {{with a wide variety}} of coastal marine waters, including coastline estuaries, barrier beaches, lagoons, intertidal salt marshes, mangrove forests, seagrass beds, keys and <b>barrier</b> <b>reefs.</b>|$|R
5|$|The sand whiting inhabits a range {{along the}} east coast of Australia from Cape York, Queensland, southward along the coast and the Great <b>Barrier</b> <b>Reef</b> to eastern Victoria and {{the east coast of}} Tasmania down to Southport. The species also inhabits a number of islands; Lord Howe Island, New Caledonia, and Woodlark Island, Papua New Guinea. The species is most {{abundant}} in lower Queensland and New South Wales, where studies show it inhabits every estuary sampled throughout the course of a study, while in north Queensland, the species is very patchily distributed along the coast.|$|E
5|$|According to an {{analysis}} by Tim Flannery, the ecosystem of Lord Howe Island is threatened by climate change and global warming, with the reefs at risk from rises in water temperature. The Great <b>Barrier</b> <b>Reef</b> is specifically identified as being at risk {{to the effects of}} global warming on Australia, and the same analysis applies to the reefs of Lord Howe Island. Cool climate flora and fauna are at risk from rises in temperature, because there is limited scope for migration to higher altitudes.. The first international conference on global artificial photosynthesis as a climate change solution occurred at Lord Howe island in 2011, the papers being published by the Australian Journal of Chemistry.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Hattie moved ashore in British Honduras with a storm tide {{of up to}} 14feet (4.3m) near Belize City, a city of 31,000people {{located at}} sea-level; its only {{defenses}} against the storm tide were a small seawall and a strip of swamp lands. The capital experienced high waves and a 10ft (3m) storm tide along its waterfront that reached the third story of some buildings. A trained observer estimated winds of over 150mph (240km/h), and winds in the territory were unofficially estimated as strong as 200mph (325km/h). When Hattie affected the area, most buildings in Belize City were wooden, and most of this type were destroyed. Offshore, the hurricane heavily damaged 80% of the Belize <b>Barrier</b> <b>Reef,</b> although the reef recovered after the storm.|$|E
50|$|The Great Astrolabe Reef {{is one of}} {{the largest}} <b>barrier</b> <b>reefs</b> in the world and {{encompasses}} Kadavu Island, Ono Island and other small islands within a natural protective lagoon.

40|$|In the {{northern}} part of the South China Sea there is a complete range of modern coral-reef types, including fringing <b>reefs,</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>reefs,</b> table reefs and at 01 Is (Fig. 1 The distribution of these coral reefs is controlled e i ther by terrigenous sedimentation, or by climatic and hydrodynamic conditions. Because of the interference of terrigenous sediments from the Pearl River and other small rivers, fringing and <b>barrier</b> <b>reefs</b> are mainly limited to the Guangdong shelf around Hainan and Weizhou Islands and in some estuaries, such as the estuary Daya near Hong Kong (Wang Guozhong e_t a_l 1979, Lu Bingquan e_t a_l 1983, 1984). Fringing reefs are absent along most of the coastlines of this continental shelf. Table reefs and atolls are developing off the Xisha Islands area, consisting of more than 30 shoals, banks, islets and islands which cap a submarine platform on the continental slope. Over 1251 m of reef-derived carbonate sediments have accumulated in this area since the Miocene epoch (Fig. 2, Wang Congyou 1979).

5|$|In {{addition}} {{to the search for}} the remains of the ship herself, there was considerable Australian interest in locating relics of the ship's south Pacific voyage. In 1886, the Working Men's Progress Association of Cooktown sought to recover the sixcannons thrown overboard when Endeavour grounded on the Great <b>Barrier</b> <b>Reef.</b> A £300 reward was offered for anyone who could locate and recover the guns, but searches that year and the next were fruitless and the money went unclaimed. Remains of equipment left at Endeavour River were discovered in around 1900, and in 1913 the crew of a merchant steamer erroneously claimed to have recovered an Endeavour cannon from shallow water near the Reef.|$|E
5|$|Other Australian {{locations}} mentioned {{and sometimes}} {{seen in the}} series include the fictitious suburbs of West Waratah, Eden Hills, and Anson's Corner. Real-life Australian towns {{in the state of}} Victoria such as Colac, Frankston and Shepparton are sometimes referred to. Oakey in Queensland is also mentioned and sometimes seen. On 27 August 2010, Neighbours filmed scenes in Sydney's Darling Harbour and on board a cruise ship. The episodes marked only the third time that the show has filmed scenes outside of Victoria. In October 2011, Neighbours filmed scenes in Port Douglas, Queensland and around the Great <b>Barrier</b> <b>Reef</b> region. Two storylines were filmed in Geelong and the Gold Coast in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Spawning is {{generally}} driven by environmental {{factors such as}} changes in the water temperature, and their release is triggered by lighting conditions such as sunrise, sunset or the phase of the moon. Many species of Cnidaria may spawn simultaneously in the same location, {{so that there are}} too many ova and sperm for predators to eat more than a tiny percentage— one famous example is the Great <b>Barrier</b> <b>Reef,</b> where at least 110 corals and a few non-cnidarian invertebrates produce enough gametes to turn the water cloudy. These mass spawnings may produce hybrids, some of which can settle and form polyps, but it is not known how long these can survive. In some species the ova release chemicals that attract sperm of the same species.|$|E
25|$|Deforestation, {{with its}} devastating {{environmental}} consequences, {{is a serious}} problem. Deforestation accelerates soil erosion, decreases the amount of recharge to aquifers by increasing surface runoff, damages <b>barrier</b> <b>reefs</b> and ecosystems, increases turbidity which affects mangroves, decreases agricultural production, and causes increased maintenance of water infrastructure. Decades of land abuse and environmental neglect exacerbated the devastation of Hurricane Mitch (1998), where deforestation played a major role.|$|R

50|$|The {{island is}} home to many shallow-water reefs, where snorkelers can observe {{hundreds}} of fish species {{without the use of}} scuba equipment. It is also known for its quick drop in the submerged platform of the island, allowing for numerous dive sites.

5|$|The SS Gothenburg was a {{steamship}} that operated {{along the}} British {{and then later}} the Australian and New Zealand coastlines. In February 1875, she left Darwin, Australia en route to Adelaide when she encountered a cyclone-strength storm off the north Queensland coast. The ship was wrecked on the Great <b>Barrier</b> <b>Reef</b> north-west of Holbourne Island on 24 February 1875. Survivors {{in one of the}} lifeboats were rescued two days later by Leichhardt, while the occupants of two other lifeboats that managed to reach Holbourne Island were rescued several days later. Twenty-two men survived, while between 98 and 112 others died, including a number of high-profile civil servants and dignitaries.|$|E
5|$|The {{plan was}} that the convoy sail north to {{rendezvous}} at Lord Howe Island, then set a course broadly parallel to the Great <b>Barrier</b> <b>Reef</b> {{with the aim of}} reaching the Dutch port of Batavia. From there the convoy would sail west through the Sunda Straits to the Cape of Good Hope, then north through the Atlantic to England. This route was comparatively well mapped – the first part largely mirroring that of James Cook in his first voyage in the Pacific from 1768 to 1771, and the remainder from Batavia being the traditional route of Dutch East Indiamen returning to Europe. Shortland estimated the voyage would take the convoy between six and ten months.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} the {{epaulette}} shark extends from the southern coast of New Guinea to the northern coast of Australia, {{as far south as}} Sydney. The Capricorn-Bunker Group of the Great <b>Barrier</b> <b>Reef</b> contains a particularly large population, with thousands estimated to inhabit the reefs around Heron Island alone. Additionally, there are unsubstantiated reports of this species from Malaysia, Sumatra, and the Solomon Islands. Epaulette sharks are found in shallow water to a maximum depth of 50m (160ft), and are often seen in water barely deep enough to cover their bodies. They prefer tidal pools, coral flats, and stands of staghorn coral.|$|E

40|$|The {{impacts of}} the unusually strong Cyclone Erica (March 2003) on coral reef {{habitats}} at a site located on the northwest coast of New Caledonia (South Pacific) were assessed using a 6 -year data set (2002 - 2007). We examined the interannual variations of key variables describing reef habitats (live hard and soft corals, dead corals in place, coral debris, algae and relative proportion of mechanically vulnerable and resistant live hard corals). The cyclone-induced disturbances of habitats differed according to three reef types: patch <b>reefs,</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>reefs</b> far from passes (more than 3 km from the nearest pass) and <b>barrier</b> <b>reefs</b> near passes (less than 3 km from the nearest pass). Short-term mechanical damage was detected on the three-dimensional structure of reef habitats with a notable shift from a community dominated by mechanically vulnerable corals to one dominated by resistant corals on <b>barrier</b> <b>reefs</b> far from passes. The history of habitats and their pre-disturbance characteristics, in link with local hydrodynamics, was found to influence their short-term susceptibility to extreme events such as cyclones. However, the most significant effects appeared in the midterm (within 2 years after the cyclone) as the cover of live hard corals significantly decreased by approximately 45 % between 2002 and 2004 on all reef types. The short- and midterm disturbances of coral reef habitats are discussed with regard to published temporal variations in reef fish assemblages, underlining the delayed effects of this cyclonic event on fish as well as benthic habitats. Coral reef habitats and live corals had shown significant patterns of recovery 4 years after the cyclone, followed by similar recovery in fish community, suggesting good resilience in a face of this major natural disturbance in an area under moderate anthropogenic pressure...|$|R
