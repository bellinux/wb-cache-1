5|$|Black can try {{the minor}} line 4...Nc6 that delays the {{development}} of its dark-square <b>bishop,</b> to develop it along the a1–h8 diagonal instead of the a3–f8 diagonal, depending on the circumstances. But the main line is 4...Bc5 to attack the f2-pawn, forcing 5.e3, blocking in White's <b>bishop</b> on c1, so that after 5...Nc6 White will not have enough pieces to protect his e5-pawn in the long run. Placing the <b>bishop</b> on the c5-square also has subtler points, as Tseitlin explains:At first sight the <b>bishop</b> on c5 lacks prospects, being held at bay by the pawn on e3, and is insecure {{in view of the}} threat to exchange it by Nc3–a4/e4. In reality, posting the <b>bishop</b> here has a deep strategic significance. It holds up the advance of the e- and the f-pawns (assuming the white <b>bishop</b> will go to b2), and thereby secures e5 as a future knight outpost, which in turn restricts the activity of both White's bishops. As to the exchanging threat, the <b>bishop</b> may conveniently retreat on a7 or f8, or even in some cases remain on c5 with support from a pawn on b6.|$|E

Most <b>bishops</b> oversee a diocese, some are consecrated to assist diocesan <b>bishops</b> in large or busy dioceses, and some are relieved of diocesan responsibilities so they can minister more widely (especially primates who concentrate on leading a member church of the Communion).

5|$|In 1202 the new <b>Bishop</b> of Worcester Mauger {{attempted}} to investigate Norreis's conduct, {{but under the}} leadership of Thomas of Marlborough the monastic community refused to allow the <b>bishop</b> to visit, claiming that Evesham was exempt from episcopal visitation and oversight. According to Thomas, Norreis offered to renounce the abbey's claim to exemption in return for money, but the <b>bishop</b> refused. Norries then fled the monastery, while the monks continued to refuse the <b>bishop</b> and were excommunicated, a sentence that Norreis was spared. Between early September and mid-October the dispute was heard by three ecclesiastical tribunals, Mauger was supported by Eustace, <b>Bishop</b> of Ely, and Giles de Braose, <b>Bishop</b> of Hereford. The monks and Norreis then made common cause, each vowing to stand by the other in resisting Mauger. As well as these two cases, there was a dispute between the monks and the <b>bishop</b> over the ownership of some properties. The monks and Norreis then obtained the right for their case to be heard by papal judge-delegates, but Mauger objected {{to the fact that the}} appointed judges were all Benedictine monks, and travelled to Rome to appeal.|$|E
