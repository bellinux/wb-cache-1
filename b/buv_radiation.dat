40|$|Results of a {{simulation}} {{study on the}} effects of optically thick stratospheric sulfate aerosol layers on the backscattered ultraviolet radiation (buv) in the range 256 - 340 nm are presented. In general, the increased Mie scattering produced by the aerosols results in an enhancement of the <b>buv</b> <b>radiation.</b> The increase is approximately linear with optical depth and strongly depends on solar zenith angle and aerosol layer altitude in relation to the ozone maximum. The effect is greatest at those wavelenghts whose contribution functions peak {{in the vicinity of the}} densest part of the aerosol layer. The aerosol induced perturbation of the buv field affects the ozone profile retrieval from space measurements by the Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet Experiment (SBUV) experiment. In the tropical stratosphere, the retrieved ozone between 25 and 45 km is underestimated as a result of increased Mie scattering. On the other hand, an algorithm related effect causes the retrieved ozone below 25 km to be overestimated by an amount similar to the stratospheric deficit...|$|E
40|$|In this {{presentation}} we {{will discuss}} the techniques to estimate total column ozone and aerosol absorption optical depth from the measurements of back scattered ultraviolet (<b>buv)</b> <b>radiation.</b> The total ozone algorithm {{has been used to}} create a unique record of the ozone layer, spanning more than 3 decades, from a series of instruments (BUV, SBUV, TOMS, SBUV/ 2) flown on NASA, NOAA, Japanese and Russian satellites. We will discuss how this algorithm can be considered a generalization of the well-known Dobson/Brewer technique that has been used to process data from ground-based instruments for many decades, and how it differs from the DOAS techniques that have been used to estimate vertical column densities of a host of trace gases from data collected by GOME and SCIAMACHY instruments. The buv aerosol algorithm is most suitable for the detection of UV absorbing aerosols (smoke, desert dust, volcanic ash) and is the only technique that can detect aerosols embedded in clouds. This algorithm has been used to create a quarter century record of aerosol absorption optical depth using the buv data collected by a series of TOMS instruments. We will also discuss how the data from the OMI instrument launched on July 15, 2004 will be combined with data from MODIS and CALIPSO lidar data to enhance the accuracy and information content of satellite-derived aerosol measurements. The OMI and MODIS instruments are currently flying on EOS Aura and EOS Aqua satellites respectively, part of a constellation of satellites called the "A-train"...|$|E
40|$|A {{technique}} for determining cloud-top height {{by means of}} backscattered ultraviolet (<b>BUV)</b> solar <b>radiation</b> is presented. Cloud-top heights can be inferred using this technique of both the BUV radiance and its degree of polarization are measured by a spacecraft and compared with theoretical values. The cases of satellites with high-inclination orbits and geosynchronous satellites are discussed here. Based on calculations of radiance and polarization, the resolutions of cloud-top height determinations are roughly estimated in both cases. The estimates show that inference is possible {{as long as the}} angle between the direction of the sun and the satellite from the point of interest in the atmosphere is larger than about 10 deg. The estimates also indicate that the cloud-top-height resolution depends on solar zenith angle theta(0) in the case of nadir observation by satellites in nonequatorial orbits: The resolution is about 0. 5 km for theta(0) = 30 and about 0. 3 km for larger theta(0). On the other hand, when observations are made by geosynchronous satellites, the resolution depends strongly on the latitude of the point of interest, alpha(1); a resolution within 0. 4 km can be achieved for alpha(1) {{less than or equal to}} 65 deg (0. 2 km resolution can be obtained for middle latitudes). Resolution becomes rapidly worse with increasing latitude, and alpha(1) = about 70 deg seems to be the limit of observations with this technique...|$|R
