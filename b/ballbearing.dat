5000|$|The ball {{can also}} be {{transformed}} into one of four main forms: rubber ball, <b>ballbearing,</b> bowling ball, and the ball's original crystal form. The rubber form gives {{the greatest amount of}} abilities for the ball. It can easily be bounced, slapped, thrown, and even float on water. The bowling ball form allows the ball to not break easily, sink in deep water, and kill enemies by slapping it. The <b>ballbearing</b> form gives precise control over the ball, and can be used to throw and slap the ball more carefully and is also magnetic. The crystal form floats on water and is very fragile, but gives Glover double points for each obtained Garib. Other forms can be accessed through cheat codes. Throughout the stages, there are also plenty of magic potions that help Glover by giving him power-ups for a certain amount of time.|$|E

40|$|Making workers {{interested}} in {{the results of their}} work through material incentives is very important. This is realized in the USSR through the existing system of wages, the use of profits, various kinds of remuneration and bonuses. Among these forms an important role belongs to the funds of the concern for the improvement of the cultural and living conditions of workers and for the improvement of production. In 1956 the total of these funds amounted to 3, 500 million rubles of which two billion rubles were those of industrial concerns. At the First <b>Ballbearing</b> Plant 3. 5 million rubles were set aside as the fund of the plant. These 3. 5 million rubles and the balance from the preceding years were used as follows: construction of buildings for the kindergarten; 425, 000 rubles for workers' vacations, 325, 000 rubles for individual needs and 1. 1 million rubles for bonuses. With money from such a fund the Moscow Caliber Plant built a pioneer camp, bought equipment for its polyclinics, Club and "Red Corner" (700, 000 rubles); 800, 000 rubles were spent on bonuses. Great possibilities now exist for using this fund for housing construction. (In Gorky such expenses on housing constituted 7 % of the total sum appropriated in the region for this purpose.) ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{main purpose}} of idlers is to provide the correct shaping, support and {{protection}} of a belt conveyor, reduce motion resistance as well as support for transported materials. The durability of idlers depends on numerous construction, engineering and operational factors. In practice, the idler bearings are often damaged due to wear and tear, jamming or seizure and the calculated durability does not comply with the actual lifetime of a bearing (Antoniak 2007). According to laboratory and operational practices, the quality of currently manufactured standard idlers is low and their average durability is approximately one year (Gladysiewicz, OrzeÅ‚, Noga 2012). Idlers {{do not meet the}} requirements specified in the PN-M- 46606 : 2010 standard, even at the stage of their production, which is confirmed by tests carried out in the Department of Mechanical Devices Testing â€“ the Central Mining Institute (GIG). Taking the above into consideration, testing stands which allow the testing of static and dynamic resistance of idlers' movements as well as stands for examing the idlers' water-tightness and dust-tightness in accordance with the PN-M- 46606 : 2010 standard have been designed and constructed in the Department of Mechanical Devices Testing â€“ the Central Mining Institute. The abovementioned testing stands were extended with additional functions, with regard to the above specified standard, facilitating the measurement of the temperature of bearing assemblies and to test the influence of rotational speed and idler loading in regards to durability. The tests were carried out on idlers with diameters of Ï• 133 and Ï• 159 mm, with a bearing assembly equipped with a single-raw <b>ballbearing.</b> A newly developed type of hybrid seal (labyrinth-lip), registered in the Patent Office of the Republic of Poland under the number W. 121582 on 17 December 2012 (Pytlik, Rabsztyn 2012), was used in the idler with the diameter of Ï• 133. A typical labyrinth seal was used in the idler with the diameter of Ï• 159. On the basis of the durability tests carried out on both of these idlers it can be concluded that the applied research methodology describes the test conditions of idlers, in a manner {{as close as possible to}} their actual operational conditions, which were subject to a variety of factors for a total time of 116 hours, they included: dust, water, loads and variable rotational speed. This methodology allowed us to determine, even at the stage of laboratory tests, the suitability of a particular idler to certain operational conditions...|$|E

5|$|RNC is {{the home}} of the first {{football}} academy for visually impaired players. The Football Academy was officially opened in August 2008 by former England footballer Sir Trevor Brooking and offers visually impaired students the opportunity to include football as part of their study programme with a view to playing the game at a national level. The college {{is the home}} of the England blind football team, which is supported by the Football Association and coached by former professional footballer Tony Larkin. The game is played as a five-a-side match using a ball filled with <b>ballbearings</b> to enable players to hear its position. Teams consist of four blind players and a sighted goalkeeper who offers directions along with the coach and a sighted guide behind the opposition goalpost. RNC is helping to develop a national blind football league. In 2010 RNC hosted the World Blind Football Championship at its campus. The tournament got under way on Saturday 14 August with the opening match between England and Spain, and was won by Brazil following a 2â€“0 win against Spain in the final on 22 August. Members of England's blind football team travelled to Los Angeles in November 2011 to promote the sport in the United States, and took part in a day's training with former England captain David Beckham. The trip was organised by supermarket chain Sainsbury's as part of their sponsorship deal with the footballer.|$|R
5000|$|The {{very first}} {{original}} design (before patent) was simple [...] Ã— [...] inch strips of wood which the balls would roll on, {{much like the}} design of railroad tracks. Mayenschein had shown his new invention to friends and they all wished to have one, so as his hobby, he created them. Before he knew it, with a month's time, he had over 300 orders. So my brothers and I began to help him make piece parts on our spare time, and he would then put the clocks together and spray paint them black and sell them for $75.00 each. Within six months we found my father's hobby had grown into a enterprise, so we converted the garage into a workshop, purchased a small table saw, a drill, etc. Soon afterwards {{we had to find}} larger quarters, quit our jobs and hire people to help with creating the clocks to sell. As well as find suppliers for wood, motors, linecords, <b>ballbearings</b> etc. We had moved into an industrial site on Tower Hill Road in Schaumburg.Mayenschein had also occasionally created various sized of the clock just {{for the fun of it}} and specialties for various business/organizations. A ball clock for golf courses which used golf balls. A candy shop with gum balls. Sporting shop with baseballs. I personally own a small watch size clock, I could wear on my wrist made from BBâ€™s. Which I consider simply as a novelty, since...well you understand. The largest ball clock he created stands at Western Lanes 904 S. Tayler Street in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Which they paid $10,000 for. It stands 8 ft high, 16 ft wide and 8 ft deep. It has 6 automobile shock absorbers, six timing devices, 1,446 sets of bolts, nuts and washers and a single one-sixth horse power motor. And took 700 hours to build, yes itâ€™s made for bowling balls.|$|R
