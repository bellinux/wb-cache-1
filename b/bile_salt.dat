40|$|<b>Bile</b> <b>salts</b> are biologically {{produced}} amphiphilic molecules {{capable of}} forming micelles. The physiological importance of <b>bile</b> <b>salts</b> lies {{in their ability}} to solubilise and emulsify cholesterol, dietary lipids and fat-soluble vitamins in the gastrointestinal tract. <b>Bile</b> <b>salts</b> also have got much recognition as delivery systems for medicines, cosmetics and several other chemicals. The prime factor that makes <b>bile</b> <b>salts</b> good vehicles for drug delivery is its ability to solubilise hydrophobic drugs.

40|$|<b>Bile</b> <b>salts</b> are potent {{antimicrobial}} agents and {{are an important}} component of innate defenses in the intestine, giving protection against invasive organisms. They {{play an important role in}} determining microbial ecology of the intestine and alterations in their levels can lead to increased colonization by pathogens. We have previously demonstrated survival of the opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus aureus in the human colonic model. Thus investigating the interaction between S. aureus and <b>bile</b> <b>salts</b> is an important factor in understanding its ability to colonize in the host intestine. Harnessing <b>bile</b> <b>salts</b> may also give a new avenue to explore in the development of therapeutic strategies to control drug resistant bacteria. Despite this importance, the antibacterial activity of <b>bile</b> <b>salts</b> on S. aureus is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the antibacterial effects of the major unconjugated and conjugated <b>bile</b> <b>salts</b> on S. aureus. Several concentration-dependent antibacterial mechanisms were found. Unconjugated <b>bile</b> <b>salts</b> at their minimum inhibitory concentration (cholic and deoxycholic acid at 20 and 1 mM, respectively) killed S. aureus, and this was associated with increased membrane disruption and leakage of cellular contents. Unconjugated <b>bile</b> <b>salts</b> (cholic and deoxycholic acid at 8 and 0. 4 mM, respectively) and conjugated <b>bile</b> <b>salts</b> (glycocholic and taurocholic acid at 20 mM) at their sub inhibitory concentrations were still able to inhibit growth through disruption of the proton motive force and increased membrane permeability.

40|$|<b>Bile</b> <b>salts</b> and {{bacteria}} have intricate relationships. The {{composition of the}} intestinal pool of <b>bile</b> <b>salts</b> is shaped by bacterial metabolism. In turn, <b>bile</b> <b>salts</b> {{play a role in}} intestinal homeostasis by controlling the size and the composition of the intestinal microbiota. As a consequence, alteration of the microbiome–bile salt homeostasis can play a role in hepatic and gastrointestinal pathological conditions. Intestinal bacteria use <b>bile</b> <b>salts</b> as environmental signals and in certain cases as nutrients and electron acceptors. However, <b>bile</b> <b>salts</b> are antibacterial compounds that disrupt bacterial membranes, denature proteins, chelate iron and calcium, cause oxidative damage to DNA, and control the expression of eukaryotic genes involved in host defense and immunity. Bacterial species adapted to the mammalian gut are able to endure the antibacterial activities of <b>bile</b> <b>salts</b> by multiple physiological adjustments that include remodeling of the cell envelope and activation of efflux systems and stress responses. Resistance to <b>bile</b> <b>salts</b> permits that certain bile-resistant pathogens can colonize the hepatobiliary tract, and an outstanding example is the chronic infection of the gall bladder by Salmonella enterica. A better understanding of the interactions between bacteria and <b>bile</b> <b>salts</b> may inspire novel therapeutic strategies for gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary diseases that involve microbiome alteration, as well as novel schemes against bacterial infections...|$|R

Susceptibility to <b>bile</b> <b>salts</b> and tolerance acquisition in the probiotic strain Propionibacterium freudenreichii SI 41 were characterized. We showed that pretreatment with a moderate concentration of <b>bile</b> <b>salts</b> (0. 2 g/liter) greatly increased its survival during a subsequent lethal challenge (1. 0 g/liter, 60 s). <b>Bile</b> <b>salts</b> challenge led to drastic morphological changes, consistent with intracellular material leakage, for nonadapted cells but not for preexposed ones. Moreover, the physiological state of the cells during lethal treatment played an important role in the response to <b>bile</b> <b>salts,</b> as stationary-phase bacteria appeared much less sensitive than exponentially growing cells. Either thermal or detergent pretreatment conferred significantly increased protection toward <b>bile</b> <b>salts</b> challenge. In contrast, some other heterologous pretreatments (hypothermic and hyperosmotic) had no effect on tolerance to <b>bile</b> <b>salts,</b> while acid pretreatment even might have sensitized the cells. Two-dimensional electrophoresis experiments revealed that at least 24 proteins were induced during <b>bile</b> <b>salts</b> adaptation. Identification of these polypeptides suggested that the <b>bile</b> <b>salts</b> stress response involves signal sensing and transduction, a general stress response (also triggered by thermal denaturation, oxidative toxicity, and DNA damage), and an alternative sigma factor.

40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} the in vitro physiological and genetic responses of Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579 to <b>bile,</b> <b>bile</b> <b>salts</b> and mucin, substances which would be encountered in the gastrointestinal tract. B. cereus was grown in media containing bile/bile salts and growth only occurred at low concentrations (no growth observed on LB-agar plates with 0. 02 % <b>bile</b> <b>salts).</b> Preincubation with <b>bile</b> <b>salts</b> at non-lethal concentrations did not increase the levels of <b>bile</b> <b>salts</b> tolerance. Cultures of B. cereus were grown to the mid-exponential growth phase and shifted to media containing bile (0. 03 %), <b>bile</b> <b>salts</b> (0. 005 %) and mucin (0. 25 %). Global expression patterns (shifts to <b>bile</b> and <b>bile</b> <b>salts</b> containing media) were determined by hybridization of total RNA to microarrays. The expression of selected genes, fibronectin binding protein and two internalin genes, in shift experiments to <b>bile,</b> <b>bile</b> <b>salts</b> and mucin containing media were investigated by RT-PCR. The microarray data indicated a general stress response to <b>bile</b> and <b>bile</b> <b>salts.</b> The RT-PCR indicated a down-regulation of a putative virulence factor, internalin, in <b>bile</b> <b>salts</b> cultures. Proteins were extracted from the shift experiments (not mucin) 30 minutes after the shift in a LiCl-buffer and analyzed by 2 -D protein electrophoresis. Protein spots showing differential expression were excised, trypsin digested and analysed by MALDI-TOF. Protein identification by protein mass fingerprinting showed that dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase was up-regulated in both shift experimets. Enolase was up-regulated in bile cultures, but down-regulated in <b>bile</b> <b>salts</b> cultures All off the findings in this study indicate that B. cereus ATCC 14579 vegetative cells would not survive in the intestinal environment. Down-regulation of virulence factors and induction of what seem to be a secondary stress response indicates that B. cereus ATCC 14579 does not use bile as a factor for sensing the intestinal environment...|$|R

50|$|Women {{are almost}} {{twice as likely as}} men to form gallstones {{especially}} during the fertile years; the gap narrows after the menopause. The underlying mechanism is female sex hormones; parity, oral contraceptive use and estrogen replacement therapy are established risk factors for cholesterol gallstone formation.

Estrogens increase cholesterol secretion and diminish <b>bile</b> <b>salt</b> secretion, while progestins act by reducing <b>bile</b> <b>salt</b> secretion and impairing gallbladder emptying leading to stasis. A new 4th generation progestin, drospirenone, used in some oral contraceptives may further heighten the risk of gallstone disease and cholecystectomy; however, the increased risk is quite modest and not likely to be clinically meaningful.|$|E

Human bile contains various <b>bile</b> <b>salts</b> having different hydrophobicity and micelle-forming capacities, but the importance of lipid composition to bile metastability remains unclear. This study investigated the effect of <b>bile</b> <b>salts</b> on cholesterol crystallization in model bile (MB) systems. Supersaturated MB systems were prepared with an identical composition on a molar basis (taurocholate/phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol, 152 mM: 38 mM: 24 mM), except for partial replacement of taurocholate (10, 20, and 30 %) with various taurine-conjugated <b>bile</b> <b>salts.</b> Cholesterol crystallization was quantitatively estimated by spectrophotometrically measuring crystal-related turbidity and morphologically scanned by video-enhanced microscopy. After partial replacement of taurocholate with hydrophobic <b>bile</b> <b>salts,</b> cholesterol crystallization increased dose-dependently without changing the size of vesicles or crystal morphology and the rank order of crystallization was deoxycholate>chenodeoxycholate>cholate (control MB). All of the hydrophilic <b>bile</b> <b>salts</b> (ursodeoxycholate, ursocholate and beta-muricholate) inhibited cholesterol precipitation by forming a stable liquid-crystal phase, {{and there were no}} significant differences among the hydrophilic bile-salt species.
