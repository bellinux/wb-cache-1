5|$|The {{interiors}} were streamlined {{as much as}} possible, without traditional touches such as <b>baseboard</b> moldings. Indirect lighting {{was used}} throughout. Curves were abundant, with rounded fireplaces topped with indirect lighting and a round dining room with floor-to-ceiling windows. Rounded balcony edges were set off by rounded bay windows. The bedrooms included circular dressing rooms with ample closet space. In some of the units, glass brick was used as partition material.|$|E
25|$|The {{illustration}} is {{the interior}} of a common two wire heat-only household thermostat, used to regulate a gas-fired heater via an electric gas valve. Similar mechanisms may also be used to control oil furnaces, boilers, boiler zone valves, electric attic fans, electric furnaces, electric <b>baseboard</b> heaters, and household appliances such as refrigerators, coffee pots and hair dryers. The power through the thermostat is provided by the heating device and may range from millivolts to 240 volts in common North American construction, and is used to control the heating system either directly (electric <b>baseboard</b> heaters and some electric furnaces) or indirectly (all gas, oil and forced hot water systems). Due to the variety of possible voltages and currents available at the thermostat, caution must be taken when selecting a replacement device.|$|E
25|$|Some {{programmable}} thermostats {{are available}} to control line-voltage systems. <b>Baseboard</b> heaters will especially benefit from a programmable thermostat which is capable of continuous control (as are at least some Honeywell models), effectively controlling the heater like a lamp dimmer, and gradually increasing and decreasing heating to ensure an extremely constant room temperature (continuous control {{rather than relying on}} the averaging effects of hysteresis). Systems which include a fan (electric furnaces, wall heaters, etc.) must typically use simple on/off controls.|$|E
50|$|The two-story, second-floor {{courtroom}} also retains some historic features. Details include original oak panel {{doors with}} classical surrounds, wainscot, <b>baseboards,</b> plaster walls with classically inspired panel molding, and ornamental plaster ceilings. Second-floor corridors have plaster walls with marble <b>baseboards</b> and oak chair rails. Square 1940 light fixtures remain.|$|R

50|$|<b>Baseboards</b> / {{skirting}} boards {{generally have}} typical variations {{depending on the}} country. For example, in China the <b>baseboards</b> are usually very low in height, are made of plastic or redwood, and have a very simple or unprofiled design. In contrast, in the UK there are {{a vast number of}} profiles available. These profiles are frequently named after the period when they were developed, such as Victorian or Edwardian.|$|R
25|$|Also {{known as}} the Corsi Span Test, this {{psychological}} test is commonly {{used to determine the}} visual-spatial memory span and the implicit visual-spatial learning abilities of an individual. Participants sit with nine wooden 3x3-cm blocks fastened before them on a 25- x 30-cm <b>baseboard</b> in a standard random order. The experiment taps onto the blocks a sequence pattern which participants must then replicate. The blocks are numbered on the experimenters' side to allow for efficient pattern demonstration. The sequence length increases each trial until the participant is no longer able to replicate the pattern correctly. The test can be used to measure both short-term and long-term spatial memory, depending on the length of time between test and recall.|$|E
25|$|People {{interested}} in staying overnight at R. B. Winter State park have three options. They can stay {{at one of}} the 59 modern camp sites some of which are equipped with electricity. All the sites have access to modern restrooms with showers. Each camp site also has its own fire ring, picnic table and lantern holder. There are three cottages that sleep up to five people. The cottages have electric lights and a small <b>baseboard</b> heater as well as wooden floors, windows, skylights, porches, a picnic table and fire ring. There is one modern cabin that is available to rent year-round. It is two stories with a furnished living area, kitchen, one-and-a-half baths, four bedrooms and two porches.|$|E
25|$|The {{commercialization of}} Huichol art began when a Franciscan priest {{by the name}} of Ernesto Loera Ochoa began a Huichol museum at the Basilica of Our Lady of Zapopan just north of Guadalajara. One of the artists {{exhibited}} here was Ramón Medina Silver, whose work was exhibited and sold at the museum. Medina’s work {{came to the attention of}} American Peter Furst, who suggested that Ramón represent the traditions and beliefs of his people by pressing colored yarn into a wax and resin-covered <b>baseboard.</b> These yarn paintings first appeared in 1962 in Guadalajara and were derived from “nierikas” a small board or disc with a hole or mirror in the center. Nierikas were initially produced by shamans to represent visions they experienced while consuming peyote, then left as offerings to the gods in places such as caves, temples and streams.|$|E

50|$|Offices are on {{the second}} and third floors. Wide {{corridors}} with terrazzo floors and marble <b>baseboards</b> separate perimeter offices from interior light courts.|$|R
5000|$|The door at Sweetwaters {{is located}} inside, {{down on the}} <b>baseboards</b> {{opposite}} the counter. It is a simple white door with small details mimicking the detailing found outside the cafe.|$|R
2500|$|The {{first floor}} {{reception}} hall had white plaster walls and ceiling, carpeted floors, and a [...] high wooden <b>baseboard.</b> A fireplace {{existed in the}} west wall.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{northwest}} corner was the library, accessed by double-panel wood doors with carved wood moldings around it. The flooring {{was similar to that}} of the foyer, and the ceiling of plaster. The walls were plaster, with a [...] wooden <b>baseboard</b> and a dado rail at [...] The room was originally lined with bookcases. A fireplace with marble hearth and mantel, surrounded by exquisite marble and plaster moldings, was in {{the northwest}} wall.|$|E
2500|$|Shipping labels: Often {{found on}} the back of {{millwork}} like <b>baseboard</b> molding or door and window trim, shipping labels associated with Sears may indicate that the home is a Sears Catalog house. Most of the millwork was fulfilled by the Sears-owned [...] "Norwood Sash and Door Company" [...] of Cincinnati, Ohio. However, building materials like millwork could be purchased separately from Sears so millwork with shipping labels is not, by itself, a definitive indicator of a Sears Catalog house.|$|E
50|$|A trim {{carpenter}} {{specializes in}} molding and trim, such as door and window casings, mantels, <b>baseboards,</b> {{and other types}} of ornamental work. Cabinet installers may also be referred to as trim carpenters.|$|R
5000|$|Vacuuming - Since the moths like {{to hide in}} {{carpeting}} and <b>baseboards</b> (skirting), this is {{an important}} step towards full eradication. After thorough vacuuming, the bag should immediately be disposed of outside.|$|R
50|$|With the {{exception}} of the first floor, which was renovated in 1909, original finishes throughout the hotel have been largely retained. They include: grained molded wood trim around doors, windows and <b>baseboards</b> (secondary rooms have only plain <b>baseboards</b> and moldings), six-panelled transomed doors off corridors into most rooms, plaster arches resting on wood brackets dividing sections of the hallway, and the four-story spiral stairway with full decorative wood balustrade. Extant first floor finishes reflecting the 1909 renovations include: plaster walls in some locations, heave decorative wood moldings, and pressed metal ceilings. the black and white (checkered) marble tile floor dates to 1876.|$|R
2500|$|A {{dining room}} {{occupied}} the south {{part of the}} second floor. Its flooring consisted of [...] square flame maple wood parquetry, with a [...] wooden <b>baseboard,</b> and a dado rail at [...] Its walls and ceiling were plaster, with a decorative molding around the ceiling. The doors {{were similar to those}} of the library, and in the east wall was a fireplace with iron firebox and marble mantel in the Georgian style. [...] The room was lit by six mirror-backed cystal wall sconces with three crystal torch-arms. A single 12-light crystal chandelier with two hidden light tiers and an elaborate brass canopy hung from the ceiling.|$|E
2500|$|The owner’s {{apartment}} upstairs {{includes a}} living room, dining room, kitchen, and two bedrooms. [...] The walls and floor were {{finished with the}} same tongue-and-groove paneling and planking as downstairs. [...] However, the walls have been covered by wallpaper in the bedrooms and plasterboard in the other rooms and the floors have been carpeted. [...] The woodwork includes eight-inch <b>baseboard</b> molding and four-inch framing around the doors and windows. [...] The kitchen has built-in cabinets. There are ventilation transoms above some interior doors. [...] Like the ground floor, the light fixtures have glass shades and are suspended from the ceiling by drop-cords and the door hardware is brass.|$|E
2500|$|The ballroom {{occupied}} the entire north wing. It was accessed via the foyer through glass doors. The ballroom ceiling was plaster. Its flooring was oak parquetry in a herringbone pattern with plaster walls, a [...] wooden <b>baseboard,</b> and a dado rail at [...] Flanking the doors, chimney, and windows {{and in the}} corners of the room were marble pilasters on wooden pedestals. The west wall was bowed westward, to accommodate the orchestra balcony as it projected into the room. The room was lit by 10 brass wall sconces with three upward curving torch-arms. Hanging from the ceiling were three, 12-light crystal chandeliers with three hidden tiers. The fireplace in the east wall featured a cast iron firebox, framed by marble pilasters. It had a marble mantel, and a mirror overmantel in an 18th-century English style.|$|E
5000|$|Trim (e.g. <b>baseboards)</b> comes pre-primed, {{but this}} is {{insufficient}} for fine finish painting. Painting with latex paints is difficult due to rapid water absorption. Most finishes appear uneven and nail holes tend to pucker.|$|R
50|$|Dark {{woodwork}} {{is present}} throughout the eight-room {{interior of the}} building. A wooden Craftsman staircase leads to the upper story; the rectory also features a telephone nook, broad <b>baseboards,</b> French doors, and a built-in butler's pantry.|$|R
50|$|Wide plank pine {{floors are}} used {{all over the}} house. All {{original}} finishes are of carved cucumber tree wood. The door and window surrounds are simple molded shouldered architraves and the <b>baseboards</b> are wide molded planks.|$|R
2500|$|Line voltage {{thermostats}} {{are most}} commonly used for electric space heaters such as a <b>baseboard</b> heater or a direct-wired electric furnace. [...] If a line voltage thermostat is used, system power (in the United States, 120 or 240 volts) is directly switched by the thermostat. With switching current often exceeding 40 amperes, using a low voltage thermostat on a line voltage circuit will result {{at least in the}} failure of the thermostat and possibly a fire. [...] Line voltage thermostats are sometimes used in other applications, such as the control of fan-coil (fan powered from line voltage blowing through a coil of tubing which is either heated or cooled by a larger system) [...] units in large systems using centralized boilers and chillers, or to control circulation pumps in hydronic heating applications.|$|E
2500|$|The Ranger Residence is a {{one and a}} half-story T-shaped {{building}} on a concrete foundation with an exposed fieldstone veneer. [...] It is a wood-frame structure with horizontal clapboard exterior to eave line and vertical boards above the eave line on the gable ends. [...] The building has a high gable roof with large gable on east end and projecting center porch gable on south façade. [...] The original wood-shingles roof {{has been replaced by}} textured sheet metal. [...] The front porch is supported by two heavy squared timber posts with curved brackets at the top.

[...] The covered back porch is supported by a single heavy squared timber post with top bracket matching the posts on the front porch. [...] There is an exterior stone chimney on north gable end of the building. [...] The exterior has simple six-over-six double-hung sash windows. Inside the residence the walls are covered in fluted knotty-pine paneling with plain pine <b>baseboard</b> with wood floors. [...] A stone fireplace is a central feature of the home. [...] The ceiling has exposed boxed beams separated by fiberboard paneling.|$|E
2500|$|The {{northwest}} wing was {{angled to}} align with Dupont Circle, {{while the rest}} of the house (south wing, center, northeast wing) was on a north–south axis perpendicular to P Street NW. The vestibule behind the loggia was on a northeast–southwest axis, and flanked on both sides by toilets—one of which was accessible by the billiard room to the northwest and the other by the reception hall to the southeast. The entrance hall was floored with polished terrazzo bordered by white marble. The ceiling was white plaster, and the walls were white plaster with a [...] high wooden <b>baseboard.</b> The billiard room was access by a door in the west wall, and in the north-northwest corner was a door leading to a cloakroom. To the right of the cloakroom door is a fireplace framed by exquisite moldings and a mantelpiece in the 15th-century Italian style. In the south wall, a door gave entry to the reception hall. Two marble steps led to a small landing and then the main staircase in the east wall (northeast corner). [...] Adjacent to the main staircase to the right (south) was the elevator, and then a small door and corridor giving onto the servants' section in the rear of the mansion's first floor. Northwest of the billiard room was an automobile garage, with the garage door giving onto Dupont Circle. Northeast of the garage, and connected to the garage and the cloakroom, was a bicycle storage room. [...] In the rear of the ground floor was the servants' area. Clockwise from the north, this consisted of the laundry and storage closets, servants' entrance, kitchen, pantry, serving room, butler's room, and servants' hall. A set of winder stairs behind the elevator serves as the servants' stairs.|$|E
50|$|The sets {{comprised}} <b>baseboards,</b> terracotta {{bricks and}} lintels, plastic door and window frames, card doors and roofing. The bricks were about 1 inch long in scale proportion to regular house bricks. Building plans were accurate architect's blue prints.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} of La Compañía strongly {{resembles that of}} the Church of San Ignacio in Bogotá. This similarity, particularly evident {{in the design of}} the stuccos, <b>baseboards,</b> molding and vaults, represents an enhancement of the scheme first employed in the older Bogotá church.|$|R
2500|$|Inside, the Blair–Dunning House is {{primarily}} a wooden building; yellow poplar wood is used throughout the building.

60|$|At last Mamma Mouse gnawed a {{hole through}} the <b>baseboard</b> large {{enough for her to}} get through into the pantry, and then her {{disappointment}} was great to find the bread jar covered over with a tin pan.|$|E
6000|$|He {{went out}} and bought dish-towels, soap, washing-powder, and collars of Charley's size, which was an inch larger than his own. He {{finished}} sweeping and dusting and washing the dishes--all of them. He--who had learned to comfort Istra--he really enjoyed it. His sense of order made it a pleasure to see a plate yellow with dried egg glisten iridescently and flash into shining whiteness; or a room corner filled with dust and tobacco flakes become again a [...] "nice square clean corner with the <b>baseboard</b> shining, gee! just like it was new." ...|$|E
60|$|But Mamma Mouse was a brave mouse, {{and knew}} that it was now her duty to find food for her little ones; so she dried her eyes and went bravely to work gnawing through the <b>baseboard</b> that {{separated}} the pantry from the wall. It took her some time to do this, for she could only work at night. Mice like to sleep during the day and work at night, when there are no people around to interrupt them, and even the cat is fast asleep. Some mice run about in the daytime, but they are not very wise mice who do this.|$|E
50|$|Inside, {{the lobby}} has green marble <b>baseboards,</b> white marble wainscoting {{and a white}} marble stair with iron railing. The high plaster ceiling's molded cornice has dentils and modillions, with an eagle on each pilaster. Bronze {{mailboxes}} and oak woodwork round out the interior decoration.|$|R
50|$|The {{house has}} a hall-parlor plan that had only one heated room per floor. Despite its small size, however, it was kitted out with full {{interior}} trim; elements include beaded board partition and <b>baseboards,</b> a two-piece chair rail, refined trim and a mantel on the first floor.|$|R
