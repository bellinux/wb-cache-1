He first competed in the 24 Hours of Le Mans sports car race in 2005, where he drove for the Pescarolo Sport team's No. 17 entry.

500|$|Reviews of Midtown Madness were {{generally}} positive, with video game critics praising its gameplay. IGN {{wrote that the}} game [...] "doesn't rely heavily on driving authenticity; this game's all about fun."

GameSpot wrote that [...] "it's fun to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> like a maniac [...] because you know you can't in real life." [...] Computer and Video Games remarked on the game's humor, provided by other drivers, police, and competitors (described as maniacs), praising the [...] "carnage that unfolds before your windscreen".

500|$|Moreover, Michael {{would not}} <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> {{in the new}} film, unlike his 1978 {{counterpart}} who stole Loomis' car {{so that he could}} drive back to Haddonfield. The Dr. Loomis character was also to be more intertwined with that of Michael; Zombie reasoned that the character's role in the original was [...] "showing up merely to say something dramatic". Although Zombie added more history to the Michael Myers character, hence creating more original content for the film, he chose to keep the character's trademark mask and Carpenter's theme song intact for his version (despite an apparent misinterpretation in an interview suggesting the theme would be ditched). Production officially began on January 29, 2007. Shortly before production began, Zombie reported that he had seen the first production of Michael's signature mask and commented, [...] "It looks perfect, exactly like the original. Not since 1978 has The Shape looked so good". Filming occurred in the same neighborhood that Carpenter used for the original Halloween.|$|E

2500|$|All {{this was}} done, as the Brut y Tywysogion {{explained}} regarding Dafydd [...] "because {{he thought he}} could hold his territory in peace thereby", but it proved insufficient. Before the end of 1175 Rhodri had escaped from captivity and gathered sufficient support to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> Dafydd from Anglesey and across the River Conwy. Faced with this turn of events, Dafydd and Rhodri agreed to divide Gwynedd between each other. Thereafter Dafydd's realm was restricted to Gwynedd Is Conwy, that is the Perfeddwlad, the land between the rivers Conwy and the Dee, whilst Rhodri retained Anglesey and Gwynedd Uwch Conwy. Secure in his now truncated realm, Dafydd now appears to have pushed ambition to one side and resolved to enjoy the quiet life. There is no record of him engaging in any further strife for the twenty years or so after the settlement of 1175. Dafydd may not have inherited the leadership abilities of his father but he had sufficient qualities of diplomacy and tact remaining to ensure he could live at peace with his neighbours. This appears to be the one quality recognised by his contemporaries as he was described by Giraldus Cambrensis as a man who showed [...] "good faith and credit by observing a strict neutrality between the Welsh and English" ...|$|E

2500|$|High-stakes tests {{reveal that}} some examinees {{do not know}} the {{required}} material, or do not have the necessary skills. While failing these people may have many public benefits, the consequences of repeated failure can be very high for the individual. For example, a person who fails a practical driving exam will not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> a car legally, which means they cannot drive to work and may lose their job if alternative transportation options are not available. [...] The person may suffer social embarrassment when his acquaintances discover that his lack of skill resulted in loss of his driver's license. [...] In the context of high school exit exams, poorly performing school districts have formally opposed high-stakes testing after low test results, which accurately and publicly exposed the districts' failures, proved to be politically embarrassing, and criticized high-stakes tests for identifying students who lack the required knowledge. As high-stakes testing moves into the 21st century, many exams are performed using online tools. This puts low income students at a disadvantage as less than 65% have computers in their household. Low-income school districts do not have the funding to provide students with the tools and training to perform the tasks required for the test.
