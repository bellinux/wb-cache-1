40|$|Graduation date: 1968 A field {{experiment}} under irrigation {{was conducted at}} the Hyslop Agronomy Farm, near Corvallis, Oregon, during the 1967 growing season to evaluate the effect of barley row spacing, nitrogen rate and placement, and weed competition {{in the year of}} seeding upon <b>birdsfoot</b> <b>trefoil</b> (Lotus corniculatus L.) seedling establishment. The effect of <b>birdsfoot</b> <b>trefoil</b> on barley grain production was also evaluated. Three herbicides were used to measure the effects of weed competition upon <b>birdsfoot</b> <b>trefoil</b> establishment and barley grain production. These are: Avadex BW 1. 25 lb. ai. per acre, 2, 4 -DB amine 1. 50 Ib. ai. per acre and DNBP amine 1. 50 lb. ai. per acre. The effects of nitrogen in <b>birdsfoot</b> <b>trefoil</b> establishment and on barley grain production were studied using two systems of placement: 80 lb. N per acre broadcast and 20 lb. N per acre applied in rows spaced at 7 inches plus 60 lb. N per acre broadcast. The effects of row spacing on <b>birdsfoot</b> <b>trefoil</b> establishment and barley grain production were determined using five systems of seeding: (1) barley seeded alone in rows spaced at 7 inches, (2) barley seeded alone in rows spaced at 14 inches, (3) barley seeded in rows spaced at 7 inches plus <b>birdsfoot</b> <b>trefoil</b> seeded {{at the same time in}} the same row, (4) barley seeded in rows spaced at 14 inches plus <b>birdsfoot</b> <b>trefoil</b> seeded at the same time in the same row and in row between barley, and (5) <b>birdsfoot</b> <b>trefoil</b> seeded in rows spaced at 7 inches. It was concluded that the use of a barley companion crop to establish <b>birdsfoot</b> <b>trefoil</b> decreases the vigor of the trefoil; however, the number of plants per foot of row was similar to the other treatments. At constant seed rate of barley, an increase in row spacing above 7 inches gave a decrease of grain yield and an increase of dry matter yield of <b>birdsfoot</b> <b>trefoil.</b> <b>Birdsfoot</b> <b>trefoil</b> seeded alone gave the highest dry matter yield in the year of establishment. The trefoil did not affect the yield of barley. Application of nitrogen as urea reduced the number of plants of <b>birdsfoot</b> <b>trefoil,</b> when this species was seeded alone or together with barley, but the yield of the forage species was not reduced. Nitrogen application of 80 pounds per acre increased barley grain yield when it was applied broadcast, but not when it was split into 20 pounds nitrogen per acre in rows at seven inches and 60 pounds nitrogen per acre broadcast. An interaction between 2, 4 -DB application and nitrogen placement was found in barley grain production, but not in <b>birdsfoot</b> <b>trefoil</b> establishment. Also, an interaction between 2, 4 -DB application and system of seeding was found to affect yield of dry matter of <b>birdsfoot</b> <b>trefoil.</b> 2, 4 -DB increased <b>birdsfoot</b> <b>trefoil</b> yield and effectively controlled red root pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.), common lambsquarter (Chenopodium album L.), common groundsel (Senecio vulgaris L.), and shepherdspurse (Capsella bursa-pastoris (L.) Medic.), but it did not influence barley grain yield and the number of plants of <b>birdsfoot</b> <b>trefoil</b> per foot of row. DNBP had a detrimental effect on barley yield and was similar to no herbicide on <b>birdsfoot</b> <b>trefoil</b> dry matter yield.

"During the past twenty-five years <b>birdsfoot</b> <b>trefoil</b> (Lotus corniculatus L.) has played an increasingly important role as a forage legume on livestock farms in the north-eastern and north-central United States. The longevity and adaptation of this crop has warranted its use as a forage legume on soils which for reasons of drainage or fertility are unsuited to alfalfa. <b>Birdsfoot</b> <b>trefoil</b> has done and should do much to improve the field and quality of forage in areas and on soils where other perennial legumes formerly could not be grown.

40|$|Graduation date: 1964 Field, greenhouse, {{growth chamber}} and {{laboratory}} experiments evaluated factors affecting establishment, survival {{and production of}} <b>birdsfoot</b> <b>trefoil</b> (Lotus corniculatus L.) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) Field studies investigated {{the effects of a}} barley companion crop, seedling year harvest management and nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization upon stands, survival and subsequent production of legumes. Seedings were made in each of two years. Stands of legumes were not affected by fertilization or harvest management, but decreased with increasing levels of companion crop competition. Death of seedlings occurred early in the establishment period and the degree of loss was similar for both species. Additional losses of plants did not occur during the establishment year. Losses of <b>birdsfoot</b> <b>trefoil</b> plants established with a companion crop occurred during the first winter following seeding. Stand reduction in the seeding year persisted {{for the duration of the}} experiment. Companion crops inhibited the growth of surviving seedlings. Growth inhibition was less when barley was clipped periodically than when it was matured to grain. In the absence of a companion crop, growth of seedlings was inhibited more by frequent clipping of thin weed stands than by allowing weeds to mature. Yields of weeds were inversely proportional to density of barley plants. Wild oats was more detrimental to seedling growth and was less readily controlled by clipping than redroot pigweed or pigeon grass. The percentage of solar radiation intercepted by barley varied from 89 in early morning or late evening to 22 at noon. Light intensity was reduced more by barley in early season and less by barley in late season than by wild oats. Yields of mixtures in the year after seeding were reduced as a result of establishment with a companion crop and to a greater degree and for a longer period of time when barley had been allowed to mature. Yield reductions of legumes were compensated for by increased grass yields. Grass grown with <b>birdsfoot</b> <b>trefoil</b> yielded significantly more in early season and significantly less in late season than grass grown with alfalfa. Greenhouse studies evaluated the influenee of soil temperature and phosphorus fertilization upon growth and phosphorus uptake of <b>birdsfoot</b> <b>trefoil</b> and alfalfa. Root growth of both species increased with increasing soil temperatures. Weight of alfalfa roots was twice that of <b>birdsfoot</b> <b>trefoil</b> at all temperatures. Top growth of <b>birdsfoot</b> <b>trefoil</b> increaeed to a greater degree than that of alfalfa with increasing temperature. The greater top growth of <b>birdsfoot</b> <b>trefoil</b> resulted in reduced root-shoot ratios. <b>Birdsfoot</b> <b>trefoil</b> produced less dry matter per cm. ² of leaf area than alfalfa. Root growth of both species increased with increasing applications of P fertilizer. Phosphorus appeared to be more important to growth at low than at high temperatures. Phosphorus and nitrogen uptake by both species increased with increasing soil temperature. Growth chamber studies evaluated the influence of low light intensities and seedling age upon growth of seedlings and distribution of accumulated dry matter. Seedlings gained weight at light intensities of 200 to 800 f. c. With decreasing light intensity, stem elongation occurred at the expense of roots. A smaller percentage of accumulated dry matter went into roots of two-week than in older seedlings. Roots of two-week old seedlings of alfalfa lost weight at 200 f. c. Laboratory studies evaluated oxygen uptake of germinating <b>birdsfoot</b> <b>trefoil</b> and alfalfa seeds. Average oxygen uptake by both species on a per unit weight basis was similar. Alfalfa, due to its greater size, had a greater oxygen uptake on a per plant basis than did <b>birdsfoot</b> <b>trefoil...</b>|$|E

The {{effect of}} <b>birdsfoot</b> <b>trefoil</b> (Lotus corniculatus) and chicory (Cichorium intybus) on {{parasite}} intensities {{and performance of}} lambs naturally infected with helminth parasites. ? Veterinary Parasitology, 112 (1 - 2), 147 - 155 Sponsorship: DEFRAConventionally, farmers rely upon the routine use of anthelmintics to control helminth parasites and their use has proved highly cost-effective. However, several factors, including the emergence of helminths resistant to pharmaceutical anthelmintics, are forcing farmers to seek alternative approaches to parasite control. Studies in New Zealand have shown that some alternative forages may reduce parasitic infestation in sheep. In the current study, {{it was found that}} under UK environmental conditions lambs with naturally acquired helminth infections grazing chicory (Cichorium intybus) and <b>birdsfoot</b> <b>trefoil</b> (Lotus corniculatus) had fewer helminth parasites than sheep grazing ryegrass/white clover (Lolium perenne/Trifolium repens). Twelve pure-bred Lleyn male lambs grazed replicated 0. 5 ha plots of <b>birdsfoot</b> <b>trefoil,</b> chicory or ryegrass/white clover for 5 weeks. Liveweight and faecal egg counts (FECs) were determined weekly and eight lambs per forage were slaughtered {{at the end of the}} trial to determine total helminth intensities. Lambs grazing <b>birdsfoot</b> <b>trefoil</b> had a lower FEC on day 7 (PPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Digestibility of undegradable intake protein {{of smooth}} bromegrass, <b>birdsfoot</b> <b>trefoil,</b> and {{heat-treated}} alfalfa was determined using the mobile nylon bag technique. Undegradable intake protein (UIP) was determined using neutral detergent insoluble protein at 75 % {{of the total}} mean retention time; 1. 82 and 1. 71 in June and July for brome and 1. 30 and 1. 94 in June and July for <b>birdsfoot</b> <b>trefoil.</b> Digestibility (%) of the UIP in brome was 38. 6 and 27. 1 in June and July and in <b>birdsfoot</b> <b>trefoil</b> 21. 1 and 25. 1. The UIP (% DM) of alfalfa dried to simulate dehydrated, sun-cured, and fresh alfalfa, was 3. 13, 2. 10, and 1. 84. Digestibility (%) of UIP was highest for dehydrated (46. 4) followed by sun-cured (25. 6) and fresh alfalfa (14. 7).

40|$|A {{method was}} {{developed}} for rapid plant regeneration from protoplasts of <b>birdsfoot</b> <b>trefoil</b> (Lotus corniculatus cv. Leo) using in vitro cotyledons and a new enzyme formula. Protoplasts of a transgenic Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanthi line KCR were isolated from leaves, in vitro shoots, and calli by an enzyme formula consisting of 0. 5 % Cellulase R- 10 and 0. 05 % Pectolyase Y 23 with either 0. 4 M sucrose or 0. 5 M mannitol as the osmoticum. Nine asymmetric fusion experiments were conducted between iodoacetate inactivated <b>birdsfoot</b> <b>trefoil</b> and irradiated transgenic tobacco protoplasts. The fusion products underwent several divisions but no visible colonies were obtained. Resistance analyses revealed the inactivation of the herbicide resistant gene in the transgenic tobacco calli.
