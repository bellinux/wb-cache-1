500|$|While {{recording}} her demo album, Swift {{worked with}} demo producer Nathan Chapman, whom she {{met in a}} little shed behind a publishing company she was at. Swift said, [...] "I'd always {{go in there and}} play him some new songs, and the next week he would have this awesome track, on which he played every instrument, and it sounded like a record. We did this for a period of a year to two years <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> my record deal." ...|$|E
500|$|The miscue was Mantilla's second {{since he}} had {{replaced}} shortstop Johnny Logan, who was shaken up on a double play [...] in the seventh inning. The Chicago Tribune noted the impact of Logan's injury as it was his replacement who made the costly final error. Mantilla was [...] "close to tears" [...] after the game, saying the ball [...] "took a crazy bounce... <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> it." [...] However, Braves' manager Fred Haney insisted Mantilla [...] "didn't make a bad play," [...] that he was [...] "lucky to stop the ball at all," [...] and that the run would have scored even if Mantilla had delivered a perfect throw.|$|E

I {{never did}} my records like that <b>before.</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> to choose the music, but this time around it was, like, I'd sit down and think: 'What {{happened}} to me yesterday? What happened to me today?' and just write. It was very therapeutic, in a way. And easy – I was shocked at {{how easy it was}} to be honest about yourself and things that affect you. It is a dance record, but I wanted it to be serious. I wanted to talk about serious things, but do it in a not-so-serious way, with music that makes you want to get up and dance.|$|E
500|$|On tagging {{first base}} after Cabrera's relay, Galarraga began celebrating his accomplishment. His {{immediate}} reaction to Joyce's on-field ruling was a momentary pause {{followed by a}} wry smile at the umpire {{before returning to the}} mound. Galarraga told reporters after the game that the outing [...] "was my best game, so far", and said that Joyce [...] "probably feels more bad than me. Nobody's perfect. Everybody's human. I understand. I give the guy {{a lot of credit for}} saying, 'I need to talk to you.' You don't see an umpire tell you that after a game. I gave him a hug." [...] He also told reporters, [...] "I know that I pitched a perfect game, I believe I got it. I said <b>before,</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> a perfect game. I'm going to show my son. Maybe it's not in the book, but I'm going to tell my son, 'One time I got a perfect game.' I'll show him the CD," [...] further calling his effort [...] "the first 28-out perfect game". Tigers' manager Jim Leyland added, [...] "It's a crying shame. Jim [...] is a class guy. This sounds crazy, but after looking at the play, nobody is going to feel worse than he does. I yelled a bit after the game because emotions are high. You just want it so bad for the kid. I don't think you're as mad at the umpire as mad the kid didn't get it—and he did deserve it." [...] Leyland also said that Joyce's call was part of the [...] "human element of the game".|$|E
500|$|When Kyril Bonfiglioli {{took over}} in 1964, he complained in his first {{editorial}} that he had [...] "just read through {{a quarter of a}} million words of ms [...] and half of it was so bad it made me blush". He asked Brian Aldiss to help; the only unsold stories Aldiss had were from his early days, [...] "written <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> the hang of things", but Bonfiglioli told Aldiss, [...] "They can't possibly be worse than the rubbish that's being submitted". Aldiss provided four stories for the first two issues, under his own name and two pseudonyms, [...] "Jael Cracken" [...] and [...] "John Runciman". Bonfiglioli's third issue included Keith Roberts' first two stories: [...] "Escapism", a time travel tale, and [...] "Anita", the first in a series about a witch; Roberts became a frequent contributor both under his own name and as [...] "Alistair Bevan", and also provided the artwork for several covers. The Day of the Minotaur, another historical fantasy by Thomas Burnett Swann, began serialisation in the same issue under the title The Blue Monkeys. Swann's novel The Weirwoods was also serialised in the magazine, with no change of title. Other new writers that began to appear under Bonfiglioli's editorship included Josephine Saxton and Brian Stableford. Bonfiglioli's focus on stories that he liked personally, rather than on a specific editorial policy, led author Christopher Priest to describe Science Fantasy under Bonfiglioli's editorship as [...] "a literate and charmingly eccentric magazine, with an atmosphere all its own".|$|E

60|$|It {{is claimed}} that the {{atmosphere}} of the New Hampshire highlands is exceptionally bracing and stimulating, and a fine aid to hard and continuous work. It is a just claim, I think. I came in May, and wrought 35 successive days without a break. It is possible that I could not have done it elsewhere. I do not know; I have not had any disposition to try it, <b>before.</b> <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>got</b> the disposition out of the atmosphere, this time.

2500|$|On April 19, 2007, Thicke {{performed}} on The Oprah Winfrey Show, singing [...] "Lost Without U". He {{returned to the}} show a month later, on May 29, performing [...] "Complicated" [...] and Oprah's favorite song from the album, [...] "Would That Make U Love Me", while also promoting Beyoncé's tour, on which he would be an opening act. Oprah revealed that Thicke's initial appearance garnered a strong reaction, noting that people called the show {{to say that they}} didn't know he would be on. Oprah explained, [...] "So what I {{wanted to do was to}} accommodate all of the people who missed it the first time... In order to do that, I had to do something I've never done <b>before.</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> on the phone and asked this very special guest if he would consider coming back." ...|$|E

She met him twice and later stated, [...] "Three hours went by like 20 minutes, and it was blissful--it was like I was floating." [...] Casey claims she was able to speak with her dead father.

2500|$|Portman was {{a unique}} choice because she was {{unfamiliar}} with Star Wars. [...] "My cousins had always been obsessed with the films, yet I hadn't even seen them <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> the part," [...] she says.

[...] She told a CNN interviewer, [...] "I really wasn't aware of how big a deal Star Wars was ... and when I saw the films, I really liked them, but I still didn't really understand how many ... were passionate fans of this film." [...] Portman was, however, enthusiastic over being cast as the queen of Naboo, a character she expected to become a role model: [...] "It was wonderful playing a young queen with so much power. I {{think it will be}} good for young women to see a strong woman of action who is also smart and a leader." ...|$|E
