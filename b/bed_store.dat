40|$|NEED Concern over {{global climate}} change {{has led to a}} need to reduce CO 2 {{emissions}} from power plants. Unfortunately, current CO 2 capture processes reduce the efficiency with which fuel can be converted to electricity by 9 - 37 %, and CO 2 capture costs can exceed $ 70 per tonne 1 of CO 2 (Herzog, Drake, and Adams 1997). OBJECTIVE To generate electricity with little reduction in conversion efficiency while emitting little or no CO 2 to the atmosphere, TDA Research, Inc. (TDA) is developing a Novel CO 2 Separation System, which we call a Sorbent Energy Transfer System (SETS). APPROACH TDA’s SETS reacts fuel with a metal oxide sorbent in a fluidized <b>bed,</b> <b>storing</b> energy in the sorbent by reducing the metal oxide to a metal while fully oxidizing the fuel (e. g., natural gas, oil, and/or gasified coal) to CO 2 and steam. After condensing the steam, the CO 2 (which is not diluted by nitrogen) is further compressed and sent to sequestration. The chemical energy in the reduced sorbent is then liberated by re-oxidizing (burning) the sorbent with highpressure air in a transport reactor, and the resulting hot, high-pressure air is then used to drive a gas turbine and generate power. To be economically competitive, the process needs low-cost, highly reactive sorbents that absorb and release oxygen in seconds and can be cycled withou...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe aims of {{this study}} were to {{estimate}} the incidence rate of clinical mastitis (IRCM) and identify risk factors for clinical mastitis in suckler ewes to generate hypotheses for future study. A postal questionnaire was sent to 999 randomly selected English sheep farmers in 2010 to gather data on farmer reported IRCM and flock management practices for the calendar year 2009, of which 329 provided usable information. The mean IRCM per flock was 1. 2 / 100 ewes/year (CI: 1. 10 : 1. 35). The IRCM was 2. 0, 0. 9 and 1. 3 / 100 ewes/year for flocks that lambed indoors, outdoors and a combination of both, respectively. Farmers ran a variety of managements before, during and after lambing that were not comparable within one model, therefore six mixed effects over-dispersed Poisson regression models were developed. Factors significantly associated with increased IRCM were increasing percentage of the flock with poor udder conformation, increasing mean number of lambs reared/ewe and when some or all ewes lambed in barns compared with outdoors (Model 1). For ewes housed in barns before lambing (Model 2), concrete, earth and other materials were associated with an increase in IRCM compared with hardcore floors (an aggregate of broken bricks and stones). For ewes in barns during lambing (Model 3), an increase in IRCM was associated with concrete compared with hardcore flooring and where <b>bedding</b> was <b>stored</b> covered outdoors or in a building compared with <b>bedding</b> <b>stored</b> outdoors uncovered. For ewes in barns after lambing (Model 4), increased IRCM was associated with earth compared with hardcore floors, and when fresh bedding was added once per week compared with at a frequency of ≤ 2 days or twice/week. The IRCM was lower for flocks where some or all ewes remained in the same fields before, during and after lambing compared with flocks that did not (Model 5). Where ewes and lambs were turned outdoors after lambing (Model 6), the IRCM increased as the age of the oldest lambs at turnout increased. We conclude that the reported IRCM is low but highly variable and that the complexity of management of sheep around lambing limits the insight into generating hypotheses at flock level for risks for clinical mastitis across the whole industry. Whilst indoor production was generally associated with an increased IRCM, for ewes with large litter size indoor lambing was protective, we hypothesise that this is possibly because of better nutrition or reduced exposure to poor weather and factors associated with hygiene...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} particulate {{organic matter}} (POM) storage and retention in aquatic macrophyte beds (Sparganium americanum Nutt.) from 2, first-order, blackwater tributaries of Tinker Creek, South Carolina, USA. Measurements were made during the autumn (high litter input) and summer (low litter input), in 100 -m study reaches, 1 with low macrophyte density (T-l) and 1 with high macrophyte density (T- 2). Three experiments assessed: 1) POM retention by individual plant beds, 2) short-term retention of leaf analogs in plant beds and by other retention structures, and 3) benthic and transported POM at the reach scale. Upon completion, all above ground macrophyte biomass was removed and the experiments were repeated. At the scale of 1 bed, low plant density effectively trapped and stored POM in summer and autumn. High-density <b>beds</b> <b>stored</b> POM in the summer but during autumn POM output exceeded input. At the reach scale, both tributaries effectively retained coarse POM in summer, but only high-density beds did so in autumn. Likewise, only high-density beds trapped and retained fine POM. Following plant removal, both coarse and fine POM were transported with minimal retention. When plants were present, beds {{played a major role}} in leaf analog retention and increased the retentive capabilities of other channel structures (debris dams, overhanging vegetation). When beds were removed, most analogs were retained by debris dams or settled to the substrate. Macrophyte beds play a major role in POM retention and short-term storage in low-gradient blackwater streams at several spatial scales and are linked to retention by other channel structures. The importance of macrophyte beds varies depending on bed density, total surface coverage, and timing of leaf fall...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{evaluated}} {{the stability of}} cashew apple juice in powder, dehydrated in spouted <b>bed</b> and <b>stored</b> in two vacuum-sealed packages (laminated and plastic) {{for a period of}} 60 days. The parameters evaluated in this study were ascorbic acid, carotenoids, moisture, water activity, hygroscopicity, degree of caking, solubility and rehydration. Decreases in the contents of ascorbic acid and carotenoids were observed after 60 days. Moisture content remained practically unchanged during storage, and water activity showed a rising trend in the plastic package. In both packages, the powder showed low hygroscopicity and high caking formation. The solubility in both packages was higher than 90 % and the time of rehydration of cashew apple juice in powder in the plastic package increased during storage.
