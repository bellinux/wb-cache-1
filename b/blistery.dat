25|$|Galen {{notes that}} the {{exanthem}}a covered the victim's entire body and was usually black. The exanthem became rough and scabby {{where there was no}} ulceration. He states that those that were going to survive developed a black exanthem. According to Galen, it was black because of a remnant of blood putrefied in a fever blister that was pustular. His writings state that raised blisters were present in the Antonine plague, usually {{in the form of a}} <b>blistery</b> rash. Galen states that the skin rash was close to the one Thucydides described. Galen describes symptoms of the alimentary tract via a patient's diarrhea and stools. If the stool was very black, the patient died. He says that the amount of black stools varied. It depended on the severity of the intestinal lesions. He observes that in cases where the stool was not black, the black exanthema appeared. Galen describes the symptoms of fever, vomiting, fetid breath, catarrh, cough, and ulceration of the larynx and trachea.|$|E
6000|$|Well; here {{truly is}} {{no answer to}} the Sphinx-question; not the answer a disconsolate public, inquiring at the College of Health, was in hopes of! A total change of regimen, change of {{constitution}} and existence from the very centre of it; a new body to be got, with resuscitated soul,--not without convulsive travail-throes; as all birth and new-birth presupposes travail! This is sad news to a disconsolate discerning Public, hoping to have got off by some Morrison's Pill, some Saint-John's corrosive mixture and perhaps a little <b>blistery</b> friction on the back!--We were prepared to part with our Corn-Law, with various Laws and Unlaws: but this, what is this? ...|$|E

[...] Sam removes the creature from Naomi's neck and destroys it under the wheels of a passing train.|$|E
50|$|Typical soybean foliage {{symptoms}} of BPMV include leaf mottling (if present), {{which is the}} appearance of yellow and green blotches on the leaf as well as leaf rugosity. Symptoms vary between different host species and virus strains. Mottling can be seen more severely on younger leaves with a distorted or <b>blistery</b> appearance. In stressful conditions such as hot weather and during the reproductive stages there are less symptoms. BPMV {{may also be a}} cause of green stem syndrome resulting in green stems and leaves while the pods and rest of the field has matured. Seed infected with BPMV can be discolored or mottled.|$|E

50|$|The leaf blades are ovate to broadly ovate or ovate-elliptic. They {{typically}} {{range in}} size from 5 to 24 cm long and 2.5 to 12 cm wide. At their tips, leaf blades are acute to acuminate (tapering to a sharp point), while at their base, they are either cordate to abruptly contracted and obtuse or long, slender and wedge shaped. The surface of the leaf blade is puckered with a <b>blistery</b> appearance or is wrinkly and rugged. The leaf blade feels rough to the touch and has hairs that may be soft, weak, thin and clearly separated or coarse, rough, long and densely matted. The edges of the leaf are toothed, and may be crenate (with rounded edges), or serrate (with jagged edges).|$|E

5000|$|Isastrea {{belonged to}} a group known as the hexacorals, so named for the shape of each {{individual}} polyp skeleton (corallite). Each corallite was between 3 mm and 15 mm in diameter. In addition, 30-80 septa (walls dividing body cavities) were present in each animal. Its walls were [...] "weak, discontinuous or absent". In some species, adjacent septa would fuse. Dissepiments ("small <b>blistery</b> plates" [...] serving the purpose of internal support) were plentiful in the animal. Columella (central [...] "rod- or plate-like" [...] structures) were present as well, but were not very strong. The genus {{is believed to have}} lived in colonies (each of which could have been 39 in long) and formed coral reefs. The colonies were [...] "massive", [...] "encrusting, platey, dome-shaped or sometimes ramose". It was a hermatypic coral, which require [...] "warm, clear, shallow water" [...] and live in symbiotic relationships with algae. It is also likely that zooxanthellae (a kind of protozoa) lived on the coral. It has been theorized that Isastrea could endure lower temperatures than most other hermatypic corals because it occurs farther north than them.|$|E
40|$|Context Many {{diseases}} {{caused by}} viral agents {{are associated with}} fever and cutaneous manifestations. Viral exanthema is a widespread nonspecific skin rash, commonly characterized by generalized eruption of erythematous macules and papular lesions. Although these rashes are mostly benign and self-limited, some may be serious and life-threatening. Differentiation between severe and benign types is clinically important and life-saving. Evidence Acquisition In this narrative review, electronic databases, including Google Scholar, Science Direct, PubMed (including Medline), Web of Science, Scientific Information Database, and Scopus, were searched. We conducted a narrative review of papers published on pediatric viral exanthema during 2000 - 2016. The used keywords included “viral exanthema”, “fever”, and “skin rash”. Articles on skin rash, caused by drug reactions or nonviral exanthema, were excluded. Results Different viral agents can cause different types of skin reactions. Cutaneous manifestations and skin rashes can be categorized, based on {{the form of the}} rash (macular, papular, vesicular, <b>blistery,</b> petechial, and purpuric) or the general term, which denotes illnesses such as measles-like morbilliform rash, rubella or rubelliform rash, and scarlatiniform rash, a scarlet-fever like infection. Conclusions Based on the findings, a systematic approach relying on accurate history-taking and analysis of epidemiological cues and rash characteristics is of great significance...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop the lactic acid {{bacterium}} (LAB) Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS 1 as delivery vector for a human mucosal vaccine against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). LAB are known for their wide use in the food industry, especially in food and beverage preservation, and are natural inhabitants of the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract. L. plantarum WCFS 1 has probiotic and immunomodulating effects and can persist in the human tract for up to seven days. L. plantarum and other LAB are regarded as safe for oral consumption and are thus subjects of extensive research regarding their potential as in situ delivery vectors for heterologous proteins. In several previous studies on the ability of recombinant bacteria to activate an immune response through the mucosal immune system, specific immune responses have been detected. In the present study, the HIVp 24 fusion protein consisting of a HIV antigen and a cytokine, was expressed and anchored to the surface of L. plantarum WCFS 1 using different anchors: a lipoanchor, an LPxTG-type anchor and a LysM-type anchor. Expression and surface display of the fusion protein was achieved, but with varying results depending on the anchor type. The variation in results emphasises the need to optimise the combination of signal peptide, anchor type, target protein and host strain for each heterologous protein that one wishes to express and display. A replicon change, presumably leading to higher plasmid copy numbers, was performed to increase production of HIVp 24. Production was increased, but surface display of HIVp 24 decreased. Surface display was analysed using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. The surface structure of the various recombinant strains was closer investigated through scanning electron microscopy, which showed that strains producing HIVp 24 fused to an anchor sequence, and in particular the strain expressing HIVp 24 with the LPxTG-type anchor, had a disrupted, <b>blistery</b> surface. Finally, the recombinant strains were tested in a mouse model. ELISPOT analysis indicated development of tolerance, but final conclusion cannot be made before additional experiments have been done. Our data show that L. plantarum WCFS 1 is able to express and anchor the HIVp 24 fusion protein to the surface using homologous signal peptides and anchors, which is an important achievement in its own right. So far, immune responses in mice have not been detected for any of the recombinant strains, but further analyses are in progress. There is a great need and potential to optimise the secretion efficiency, delivery dosage and route of immunisation in further development of this promising system for preparing an oral vaccine for HIV...|$|E
