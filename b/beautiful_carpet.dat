50|$|The main {{element in}} the Mordvinian costume was a white canvas shirt, {{decorated}} with embroidery. Erzya shirt is made from two cloths, which beaned in two. In the middle, at the central suture there was a seam left to slit for the collar and the slit on the hem for a step. In the side seams on the top at right angle there were sewed sleeves. Traditional chest fastener in the Erzya costume was «fibula syulgamo». It was an oval buckle made of thick wire with a movable pin which was used for chipping the collar. Rich lower part covered a deep chest slit. In the 19th century, the collar was usually fastened by two fibulas, one of which had no decoration.Complex belt elements played a particular importance in Mordovian women`s costumes.Costume was loincloth- pulay, which was worn over a shirt. As a sign of pubescence, girls begin to wear a pulay since 13-14 years old and then it remained the woman`s costume accessory until her death. Mordvinian woman could not appear in men society without a «pulay». Depending on the place of existence, it had a different form: square, trapeziform or as a belt with magnificent fringe.Holiday « pulay» was decorated with shells, chains, copper buttons, badges, colored beads and along the edge with long, black, red, green or blue wool and with tassels on each side. As a result, the weight of such a «pulaya» was up to 6 kilograms. Waist decoration «pulay» was of two types. The {{right side of the}} cloth was decorated with embroidery. Then, almost to knees there was a fringe from the wool, usually of black, but on holidays it could be of red or green wool. Wool decorated with copper chains and on each side attached tassels of beads.Typical thing for Erzya costume was a canvas over clothes- “rutsya”. It was the clothing accessory of married women and had options for different situations in life and ritual. Over the shirt or rutsya they wore an apron - « ikelga patsya». It was tied low on the abdomen to close the hem of her shirt. In the complex adornments, which included several tiers of necklaces, especially distinguished original round collars on a firm basis covered with a canvas embroidered with rows of beads, buttons and chains. All of them perfectly matched with massive embroidery “rutsi”.The quality of clothing was defined by the type of embroidery. Spruce Erzya shirt was embroidered all along longitudinal stripes. Erzya embroidery was characterized by a <b>beautiful</b> <b>carpet</b> texture, borders and planes distinguished high relief. Although the ornament was pretty simple: rhombus, crosses and polylines. Decorating clothes women choose the best patterns - «sermat». In the old days they were the symbols of family belonging. Erzya woman naturally endowed with a sense of proportion. Intuitively, without the knowledge of designing and modeling clothes, she sewed a masterpiece. Red and black vertical stripes on a white canvas looked noble. A wide belt, «pulay» with long black strands emphasized hips and women looked slimmer. Removable adornments -were an obligatory addition to the clothes. This is a necklace with different lengths and materials, beaded collars, fibula-syulgamo, badges and bells.|$|E

50|$|Shah Abbas the Great was an {{inspired}} King of the Safavid dynasty, and in consequence not only moved {{the capital of}} Persia to Isfahan from Qazvin but also started an artistic renaissance within the capital of his court. Under his vision and guidance carpet weaving in Isfahan flourished. However the Afghan invasion dealt a serious blow to this industry which it never recovered from {{until the beginning of}} the 20th century. Some early pieces created in the last century can be found which consist of 500.000 knots-1.000.000 knots/m2, however these are rare and few in number. World war I brought a change in “modern” Isfahan which was the center of weaving for the fashion industry of Iran. The change of fashion in the world also influenced Iran, causing Isfahan to loose its lucrative fabric industry. However, the shrewd businessman of Isfahan decided to utilize the fine quality wool in fabrics and Aba’s into high quality Persian rugs which again reestablished Isfahan as a base for one of the finest and most <b>beautiful</b> <b>carpets</b> of Iran.|$|R

50|$|From Rainbow Falls, {{the trail}} {{continues}} {{as a third}} footbridge over LeConte Creek, which the hiker bids farewell to from this point on. Over the next three miles (5 km), the trail continues its steady climb towards the lodge, cutting switchbacks through sandstone chutes, offering both the trail's first scenic overlooks and a peaceful interlude with nature, {{as most of the}} hiker's companions have been left behind at the falls. Rhododendron, sand myrtle, and mountain laurel blanket the trail during this portion, offering springtime visitors a <b>beautiful</b> <b>carpeting</b> of purples, whites, and blends of pink. At 5.4 mi, the trail comes to Rocky Spur, an outcropping of rocks that offers splendid views of the valleys below via a short side trail which loops back to the main trail. As the hiker continues on, s/he enters into a fragrant spruce fir forest, which signals the looming junction with the Bullhead Trail, at 6.0 mi. From that point, the now very rocky trail ascends for a half mile towards LeConte Lodge. The LeConte Lodge provides the only commercial lodging in the national park, as it operates about ten rustic cabins with no electricity or appliances. The lodge also operates an office which provides T-shirts and other merchandise for hikers and various amenities for guests of the lodge. For many, this signals the end of their journey, but the actual peaks of Le Conte all have separate trails a short distance from the lodge, with Cliff Tops and Myrtle Point each offering expansive panoramas of the mountains and valleys below.|$|R

40|$|Whilst {{there have}} been {{important}} publications on material culture studies in recent years, this literature tends to accept the prior experience of objects as given material facts. This thesis aims at providing {{a contribution to the}} conception of materiality through an ethnography of production grounded in long-term fieldwork. The research took place in the Siroua Mountain, to the South East of Marrakech, Morocco, where the best selling carpets in Morocco are exclusively produced by women, and marketed by men. This thesis develops an ethnography of weaving framed within the francophone anthropology of techniques (Technologie cllltllrelle). Particularly, I use the emphasis ofthe Matiere a Penser group {{on the role of the}} moving body mediated by material culture to examine how particular embodied relationships to specific materialities shape particular gendered subjectivities. Grounded in participant observation, I put myself voluntarily in the situation of a learner, as well as observed the motor and sensory actions ofweavers. This allows me to explore how women construct their female moral self, partially through the disciplinary techniques of immobility and confinement, involved in the process of making <b>beautiful</b> <b>carpets.</b> In producing objects that are exchanged by men, weavers contribute to shaping male agency. This thesis aims at exploring the specificity of making and the social meaning of carpets for those who produce them and their communities. I thus locate the Siroua weavers value in an aesthetic and ethic of doing, in which the physical enjoyment and the mastery of matter, is the place of both the construction of a stable and fulfilled self and the production of others.
