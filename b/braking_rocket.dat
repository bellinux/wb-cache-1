50|$|Other {{instruments}} {{gathering data}} before the mother ship crashed onto the Moon were a {{gamma ray spectrometer}} to measure overall lunar chemical composition and a radar altimeter. The radar altimeter was to give a signal ejecting the landing capsule and its solid-fueled <b>braking</b> <b>rocket</b> overboard from the Block II mother ship. The <b>braking</b> <b>rocket</b> was to slow and the landing sphere to a dead stop at 330 m above the surface and separate, allowing the landing sphere to free fall once more and hit the surface.|$|E

50|$|The Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo {{capsules}} all splashed {{down in the}} sea. These capsules {{were designed}} to land at relatively low speeds {{with the help of}} a parachute.Russian capsules for Soyuz make use of a big parachute and <b>braking</b> <b>rockets</b> to touch down on land.The Space Shuttle glided to a touchdown like a plane.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of Voskhod 2, an {{inflatable}} exterior airlock was also added to the descent module opposite the entry hatch. The airlock was jettisoned after use. This apparatus was needed because the vehicle avionics and environmental systems were air-cooled, and depressurization in orbit would cause overheating. A solid-fueled <b>braking</b> <b>rocket</b> was also added to the parachute lines to provide for a softer landing at touchdown. This was necessary because, unlike the Vostok, the Voskhod descent module landed with the crewmen still inside.|$|E
50|$|As {{the name}} suggests, the capsule parachutes into an ocean or other {{large body of}} water. The {{properties}} of water cushion the spacecraft enough {{that there is no}} need for a <b>braking</b> <b>rocket</b> to slow the final descent as is the case with Russian and Chinese manned space capsules, which return to Earth over land. The American practice came in part because American launch sites are on the coastline and launch primarily over water. Russian launch sites are far inland and most early launch aborts were likely to descend on land.|$|E
50|$|On January 15 after 40 orbits, the <b>braking</b> <b>rocket</b> {{was fired}} at 16 km {{altitude}}, and the craft began to de-orbit. At {{an altitude of}} 750 m (2,460 ft) the main thrusters began firing, slowing the fall until a height of 22 m (72 ft) was reached. At this point the main thrusters shut down and the secondary thrusters ignited, slowing the fall until the lander was 1.5 m (5 ft) above the surface, where the engine was switched off. Landing occurred at 23:35 UT in Le Monnier crater at 25.85 degrees N, 30.45 degrees E.|$|E
50|$|Luna 18 {{was placed}} in an Earth parking orbit after it was {{launched}} and was then sent towards the Moon. On 7 September 1971, it entered lunar orbit. The spacecraft completed 85 communications sessions and 54 lunar orbits before it was sent towards the lunar surface by use of <b>braking</b> <b>rockets.</b> It impacted the Moon on 11 September 1971, at 3 degrees 34 minutes N, 56 degrees 30 minutes E (selenographic coordinates) in a rugged mountainous terrain. Signals ceased {{at the moment of}} impact.|$|R
40|$|The film shows {{experimental}} investigations {{to determine}} the landing-energy-dissipation characteristics for several types of landing gear for manned reentry vehicles. The landing vehicles are considered in two categories: those having essentially vertical-descent paths, the parachute-supported vehicles, and those having essentially horizontal paths, the lifting vehicles. The energy-dissipation devices include crushable materials such as foamed plastics and honeycomb for internal application in couch-support systems, yielding metal elements {{as part of the}} structure of capsules or as alternates for oleos in landing-gear struts, inflatable bags, <b>braking</b> <b>rockets,</b> and shaped surfaces for water impact...|$|R
5000|$|Early manned {{spacecraft}} {{launched by the}} United States were designed to alight on water by the splashdown method. The craft would parachute into the water, which acted as a cushion to bring the craft to a stop; the impacts were violent but survivable. Alighting over water rather than land made <b>braking</b> <b>rockets</b> unnecessary, but its disadvantages included difficult retrieval and the danger of drowning. The NASA Space Shuttle design was intended to land on a runway instead. Some future spacecraft are planning to permit water alightings (SpaceX Dragon, Boeing CST-100, etc.) ...|$|R
50|$|The Voskhod 2 {{spacecraft}} was a Vostok spacecraft with a backup, {{solid fuel}} retrorocket, attached atop the descent module. The ejection seat was removed and two seats were added, (at a 90-degree angle {{relative to the}} Vostok crew seats position). An inflatable exterior airlock was also added to the descent module opposite the entry hatch. After use, the airlock was jettisoned. There was no provision for crew escape {{in the event of}} a launch or landing emergency. A solid fuel <b>braking</b> <b>rocket</b> was also added to the parachute lines to provide for a softer landing at touchdown. This was necessary because, unlike the Vostok, the crew landed with the Voskhod descent module.|$|E
50|$|One system {{available}} from 1977 diverging from the French/Israeli runway piercing bomb development used in 1967 was the Matra Durandal, a single 450 lb bomb with parachute <b>braking,</b> <b>rocket</b> booster, and two warheads. The device worked after being dropped by an aircraft flying at low level braking by parachute, then when at the correct angle firing a rocket to impact the runway, first igniting a large warhead {{to create a}} crater and then subsequently using a smaller charge that had penetrated the crater to displace adjacent concrete slabs. The slabs, once displaced, are far harder to deal with than a simple hole that could be patched with asphalt. The Durandal has been widely exported.The Durandal {{was used by the}} USAF in the initial stages of the 1991 operation Desert Storm against Iraqi airfields, delivered by F-111s.|$|E
50|$|Luna 21 {{carried the}} second {{successful}} Soviet lunar rover, Lunokhod 2, and was launched {{less than a}} month after the last Apollo lunar landing. The Proton-K/D launcher put the spacecraft into Earth parking orbit followed by translunar injection. On 12 January 1973, Luna 21 was braked into a 90 × 100 km orbit about the Moon, at a 60° inclination. On 13 and 14 January, the perilune was lowered to 16 km altitude. On 15 January after 40 orbits, the <b>braking</b> <b>rocket</b> was fired at 16 km altitude, and the craft went into free fall. At an altitude of 750 meters the main thrusters began firing, slowing the fall until a height of 22 meters was reached. At this point the main thrusters shut down and the secondary thrusters ignited, slowing the fall until the lander was 1.5 meters above the surface, where the engine was cut off. Landing occurred at 23:35 UT in Le Monnier crater at 25.85° N, 30.45° E, between Mare Serenitatis ("Sea of Serenity") and the Taurus Mountains. The lander carried a bas relief of Vladimir Lenin and the Soviet coat-of-arms.|$|E
50|$|A second rescue attempt, planned {{but never}} carried out, {{would have used}} highly {{modified}} YMC-130H Hercules aircraft. Three aircraft, outfitted with rocket thrusters to allow an extremely short landing and takeoff in the Shahid Shiroudi football stadium near the embassy, were modified under a rushed, super-secret program known as Operation Credible Sport. One crashed during a demonstration at Eglin Air Force Base on October 29, 1980, when its <b>braking</b> <b>rockets</b> were fired too soon. The misfire caused a hard touchdown that tore off the starboard wing and started a fire, but all on board survived. After Carter lost the presidential election in November, the project was abandoned.|$|R
50|$|After the {{unsuccessful}} {{attempt by}} the Luna 1 {{to land on the}} moon in 1959, the Soviet Union performed the first hard (unpowered) moon landing later that same year with the Luna 2 spacecraft, a feat the U.S. duplicated in 1962 with Ranger 4. Since then, twelve Soviet and U.S. spacecraft have used <b>braking</b> <b>rockets</b> to make soft landings and perform scientific operations on the lunar surface, between 1966 and 1976. In 1966 the USSR accomplished the first soft landings and took the first pictures from the lunar surface during the Luna 9 and Luna 13 missions. The U.S. followed with five unmanned Surveyor soft landings.|$|R
40|$|The current {{applications}} of C-C composites extend to aircraft <b>brakes,</b> <b>rocket</b> nozzles, missile nosetips, and leading {{edges of the}} Space Shuttle. More advanced, secondary and even primary structure applications in cyclic, high-temperature oxidizing environments depend on effective oxidation protection for repeated missions. Accounts are presently given of state-of-the-art methods in substrate fabrication, carbon deposition, and SiC and Si 3 N 4 protective coatings. Attention is given to current levels of high temperature oxidation protection for various mission and vehicle types, {{as well as to}} performance projections for C-C composites used by a representative National Aerospace Plane airframe structure. Future technology requirements in C-C composites are projected...|$|R
50|$|The Voskhod {{spacecraft}} {{were basically}} Vostok spacecraft with a backup, solid-fuel retro-rocket added {{onto the top}} of the descent module. The ejection seat was removed and three crew couches were added to the interior at a 90-degree angle to that of the Vostok cosmonaut's position. Because of the cramped conditions, the cosmonauts also had to go on a diet to fit in their couches. A solid-fuel <b>braking</b> <b>rocket</b> was also added to the space capsule's parachute lines to provide for a softer landing at touchdown. This was necessary because, unlike the Vostok space capsule, no ejection seats were fitted in the Voskhod; the cosmonauts had to land inside the descent module. Aside from that, the Vostok booster had lacked sufficient payload capacity to support the extra weight of a retrorocket package, however the larger upper stage used on the 11A57 launch vehicle meant that this was no longer an issue. As there was no launch escape system, the mission could not be aborted until three minutes after liftoff when the payload shroud was jettisoned and so a low-altitude booster accident would have meant the loss of the crew. As the cosmonauts rode the gantry elevator to {{the top of the}} launch vehicle, they could look across the steppe which was strewn with debris from previous failed R-7 launches, a grim reminder of what could potentially happen on their flight.|$|E
40|$|The Sooner Lunar Schooner {{mission is}} a robotic {{mission to the}} Moon that will {{hopefully}} launch {{in the latter half}} of this decade. The basic mission scenario is as follows: The spacecraft will be launched and inserted into a Lunar transfer orbit; A few minutes before impact on the Moon, a <b>braking</b> <b>rocket</b> (e. g., Star 27) will be fired killing off virtually all of the relative motion between the spacecraft and the Lunar surface; the spacecraft will come to a stop approximately 50 meters above the Lunar surface; it will then freefall to the surface; the landing ellipse will be centered around the Apollo 17 landing site; after landing, the landing capsule will split apart releasing the two rovers; one rover, capable of doing materials studies will head for the Apollo 17 LEM. The other, a high speed rover, will start on a traverse to Lunakhod 2 ’s last known position, approximately 140 km distant. The mission described above has been developed and is being used as a focus for a number of multi-disciplinary engineering and science projects at the University of Oklahoma. During the courses, critical systems for the SLS missions are designe...|$|E
50|$|The concept, called Operation Credible Sport, was {{developed}} but never implemented. It {{called for a}} modified Hercules, the YMC-130H, outfitted with rocket thrusters fore and aft to allow an extremely short landing and take-off in Amjadieh Stadium. Three aircraft were modified under a rushed secret program. The first fully modified aircraft crashed during a demonstration at Duke Field at Eglin Air Force Base on 29 October 1980, when its landing <b>braking</b> <b>rockets</b> were fired too soon. The misfire caused a hard touchdown that tore off the starboard wing and started a fire. All on board survived without injury. The impending change of administration in the White House forced this project's abandonment.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{unsuccessful}} Atlas-Able Pioneer probes, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory embarked upon an {{unmanned spacecraft}} development program whose modular design {{could be used}} to support both lunar and interplanetary exploration missions. The interplanetary versions were known as Mariners; lunar versions were Rangers. JPL envisioned three versions of the Ranger lunar probes: Block I prototypes, which would carry various radiation detectors in test flights to a very high Earth orbit that came nowhere near the Moon; Block II, which would try to accomplish the first Moon landing by hard landing a seismometer package; and Block III, which would crash onto the lunar surface without any <b>braking</b> <b>rockets</b> while taking very high resolution wide-area photographs of the Moon during their descent.|$|R
50|$|In Thuvia, Maid of Mars, John Carter's son, Carthoris, invents {{what appears}} to be a partial {{precursor}} of the autopilot (several decades before it became a reality). The device, built upon existing Martian compass technology, allows the pilot to reach any programmed destination, having only to keep the craft pointed in the set direction. Upon arrival, the device automatically lowers the craft to the surface. He also includes a kind of collision detector, which uses radium rays to detect any obstacle and automatically steer the craft elsewhere until the obstacle is no longer detected. This device works in principle almost identically to the backscatter radiation detector used to fire the <b>braking</b> <b>rockets</b> on the Soyuz space capsule. In Swords of Mars a flier with some kind of mechanical brain is introduced. Controlled by thought, it can be remote-controlled in flight, or instructed to travel to any destination.|$|R
40|$|Analytical and {{experimental}} investigations {{have been made}} to determine the landing-energy-dissipation characteristics for several types of landing gear for manned reentry vehicles. The landing vehicles are considered in two categories: those having essentially vertical-descent paths, the parachute-supported vehicles, and those having essentially horizontal paths, the lifting vehicles. The energy-dissipation devices discussed are crushable materials such as foamed plastics and honeycomb for internal application in couch-support systems, yielding metal elements as part of the structure of capsules or as alternates for oleos in landing-gear struts, inflatable bags, <b>braking</b> <b>rockets,</b> and shaped surfaces for water impact. It appears feasible to readily evaluate landing-gear systems for internal or external application in hard-surface or water landings by using computational procedures and free-body landing techniques with dynamic models. The systems investigated have shown very interesting energy-dissipation characteristics over a considerable range of landing parameters. Acceptable gear can be developed along lines similar to those presented if stroke requirements and human-tolerance limits are considered...|$|R
50|$|China Aerospace Science and Technology, {{the major}} {{manufacturer}} {{of both the}} Shenzhou spacecraft and the Long March rocket have said that although the flight featured a second astronaut and was much longer than Shenzhou 5, the rocket and spacecraft did not weigh much more due to optimisation of its systems. Only 200 kg (about 440 lb) more was needed for the second astronaut. Among the amenities on board for the crew was hot food, sleeping bags and essential sanitary equipment. The sleeping bag was hooked to a wall of the orbital module and the crew had alternating sleep periods. The shock absorbers in the crew seats were redesigned so as to provide more safety to the crew in case the <b>braking</b> <b>rockets</b> fail to fire just before touchdown. The flight telemetry recorder on the spacecraft had its memory increased to about 1 gigabyte, and the read/write speed was now 10 {{times as fast as}} the computers carried on previous flights. It was also about half the size of that carried on Shenzhou 5. Overall, 95% of the Shenzhou 6 space capsule is indigenously designed/produced in China, the highest rate in comparison to the previous ones.|$|R
40|$|Investigations {{were made}} to study the water-landing and certain grounds-surface landing {{characteristics}} of a Gemini spacecraft model. The water landing experiments were made by simulating paraglider and parachute letdowns with two 1 / 6 - scale model configurations. Parameters included various combinations of attitude, horizontal speed, vertical speed, and landing skids extended and retracted. Investigations were made in calm water and in waves. The paraglider landings at horizontal speeds of 63 feet per second (19. 8 m/sec) {{which resulted in a}} noseover or tumbling shortly after initial water contact. The maximum longitudinal acceleration of the model in calm water was about 14 g units, and the maximum angular acceleration was 66 radians per second squared. In the parachute landings with the heat shield forward, the model skidded along the water surface on the heat shield. Parachute landings with the small end forward resulted in behavior {{similar to that of the}} paraglider landings. The ground-surface landings were made with a 1 / 3 -scale model by simulating a parachute letdown with <b>braking</b> <b>rockets,</b> which were fired prior to touchdown to dissipate vertical velocity. In these landings, control of timing and aligning the rockets on the model was very critical, and violent behavior resulted when either rocket alignment or timing was in error. In the landings that were correctly controlled, the model either remained upright or slowly rolled over on its side...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCeramic matrix {{composites}} {{are often}} the basis for components meant to be used under severe conditions: aircraft <b>brakes,</b> <b>rocket</b> engine hot parts, plasma facing elements of the Tokamak [...] . These materials are mainly obtained by Chemical Vapor Infiltration: matrix is formed by heterogeneous reaction of a gas precursor penetrating the fibrous preform. Quality and properties of the densified part is highly dependent of elaboration parameters such as temperature, pressure or even gas concentration [...] . Experimental optimization of the process proves long and costly and triggered {{the need for a}} numerical model. In this perspective, a multi-scale approach of the densification process is considered, based on a 3 D representation of the preform. X-Ray tomography images are used as they render a detailed capture of fiber and tow organization and before actual simulation, this virtual preform is modeled by 3 D image analysis. The numerical densification tool consists of two algorithms: one for pore-scale simulation, the other for macroscopic infiltration. In both cases, gas evolution is recreated by a Pearson's random walk technique whilst chemical reaction is represented by a discrete VOF method. The multi-scale method consists in determining micro scale diffusion and reaction laws that will be used as input for configuration of the macroscopic model. Our overall methodology and the segmentation techniques will be presented. Results of a densification simulation will then be depicted and discussed...|$|R
50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{strategically}} decisive, best known, and first wartime use of specialized cratering anti-runway weapons was by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War. The dibber bombs {{played a major}} part in the near complete destruction of the large Egyptian Air Force, mostly on the ground, in a preemptive strike on the first morning of the war by {{the commitment of the}} whole of the far smaller Israeli Air Force to the strike. The surprising elimination of the Egyptian air force and resulting Israeli air supremacy contributed significantly to the outcome of the war on all fronts. The IMI 'Runway Piercing Bomb' was a prototype Israeli-French anti-runway weapon. It used <b>rocket</b> <b>braking</b> over the target and a second rocket burst to plunge through the runway surface and explode.|$|R
50|$|The {{operational}} success {{was achieved by}} concentrating on the initial destruction of the runways with {{a new kind of}} weapon, a rocket assisted anti-runway warhead. The prototype French/Israeli anti-runway weapon program uses <b>rocket</b> <b>braking</b> over the target to point the warhead directly toward the runway being attacked; at a set altitude, a second accelerator rocket ignites and drives the warhead through the pavement of the runway before it detonates. The explosion creates a small crater over a large new sinkhole, meaning the damaged runway section must be completely removed before the sinkhole can be repaired rather than a normal bomb crater which is simply filled in and patched. Once the runways were disabled, entire air bases' complements of aircraft were effectively grounded and fell victim to subsequent attack waves, resulting in near-total Israeli air supremacy.|$|R
50|$|Conventional {{construction}} was employed throughout {{the majority of}} the P.1121; using a thick lightweight alloy skin placed on top of tightly spaced frames and stringers, while steel was used for some highly stressed components. The fuselage was split into three major sections; the front fuselage contained the radome, cockpit, radio, and equipment bay, the centre section housed the engine, air intake, belly-mounted air <b>brake,</b> nosewheel, 2-inch <b>rocket</b> launching fixtures, and a total of five nylon bag fuel tanks. The rear fuselage section was occupied by the reheat pipe, final nozzle, the main undercarriage a pair of rear air brakes, and two further bag-type fuel tanks. The P.1121 was furnished with a four-spar wing, covered by a 0.3-inch thick alloy skin, which was similarly shaped to the wing of the preceding Hawker Hunter. The spars were attached to steel booms at the inboard end, which were in turn fixed onto the four main frames of the centre fuselage section. The structural box of the wing also contained an integral fuel tank, containing up to 420 gallons of fuel in addition to the 1,055 gallons held within the fuselage fuel tanks. Up to four additional underwing external fuel tanks could also be fitted if required.|$|R
