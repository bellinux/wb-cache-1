5|$|From the Han Dynasty (206 BC-220 CE) {{until the}} modern period (1840–1919), {{scholars}} and rulers developed a male-dominated patriarchal society in China.

These ideologies continued through the Tang dynasty (618-907), and girls were taught from a very young age to be submissive to their fathers, then to their husbands, and later to their sons. During the Song Dynasty (960-1297), Confucian scholars further developed the patriarchal tradition with more restrictions for females, including foot binding for girls at a very young age.|$|E
40|$|CSIRO 2005 This paper {{reports the}} results of the first {{intensive}} grazing trials to study palatability variation <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>sex</b> phenotypes of bladder saltbush (Atriplex vesicaria Hew. ex Benth.). The results show that Merino sheep preferentially graze female shrubs over male and bisexual shrubs in South Australia, which supports earlier paddock-scale observations made in New South Wales. Male shrubs with higher densities of flower spikes were consumed less than those with lower densities. However, when male flowers were small and/or sparse, the removal of male flowers by clipping did not significantly increase the consumption of male shrubs. Female shrubs with very low or very high densities of fruit tended to be consumed significantly more than those with moderate fruit densities. Other physical aspects such as plant growth habit and foliage density did not have a consistent influence on grazing behaviour. Chemical differences <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>sex</b> phenotypes are implicated. The presence of palatability variation <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>sex</b> phenotypes suggests that there is potential to refine the existing use of bladder saltbush as an indicator species in southern Australia...|$|R

5|$|Pairs did not {{cooperate}} in feeding, {{at least not}} in a strict sense. All such reports are based on misunderstanding of an account by ornithologist Walter Buller of a pair kept in captivity obtaining wood-boring beetle larvae. According to this misunderstanding, which has become part of ecological folklore, the male would tear at the wood and open larval tunnels, thus allowing the female to probe deeply into the tunnels with her long, pliant bill. Rather, the divergent bills represent an extreme example of niche differentiation, reducing intraspecific competition <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>sexes.</b> This allowed the species to exploit a wide range of food sources in different microhabitats.|$|E

5|$|The male, {{which plays}} {{no part in}} nesting or chick care, leaves the {{breeding}} grounds in late June or early July, followed later in July by the female and juveniles. Males typically make shorter flights and winter further north than females; for example, virtually all wintering ruffs in Britain are males, whereas in Kenya most are females. Many migratory species use this differential wintering strategy, since it reduces feeding competition <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>sexes</b> and enables territorial males to reach the breeding grounds as early as possible, improving their chances of successful mating. Male ruffs may {{also be able to}} tolerate colder winter conditions because they are larger than females.|$|E

Instead, he could use the gandingan to express his reasons and his friends would be able to pick up the message by translating his song.|$|E
5|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} a major {{contributor}} to female mortality in India. Indians account for 60% of the world's heart disease burden, despite accounting for less than 20% of the world's population. Indian women have a particular high mortality from cardiac disease and NGOs such as the Indian Heart Association have been raising awareness about this issue. Women have higher mortality rates relating to cardiovascular disease than men in India because of differential access to health care <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>sexes.</b> One reason for the differing rates of access stems from social and cultural norms that prevent women from accessing appropriate care. For example, it was found that among patients with congenital heart disease, women {{were less likely to be}} operated on than men because families felt that the scarring from surgery would make the women less marriageable.|$|E
40|$|Theory {{predicts that}} {{selection}} {{should be less}} effective in the nonrecombining genes of Y-chromosomes, relative to the situation for genes on the other chromosomes, and this should lead to the accumulation of deleterious nonsynonymous substitutions. In addition, synonymous substitution rates may differ between X- and Y-linked genes because of the male-driven evolution effect and also because of actual differences in per-replication mutation rates <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>sex</b> chromosomes. Here, we report the first study of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates on plant sex chromosomes. We sequenced two pairs of sex-linked genes, SlX 1 -SlY 1 and SlX 4 -SlY 4, from dioecious Silene latifolia and S. dioica, and their non-sex-linked homologues from nondioecious S. vulgaris and Lychnis flos-jovis, respectively. The rate of nonsynonymous substitutions in the SlY 4 gene is significantly higher than that in the SlX 4 gene. Silent substitution rates are also significantly higher in both Y-linked genes, compared with their X-linked homologues. The higher nonsynonymous substitution rate in the SlY 4 gene is therefore likely {{to be caused by}} a mutation rate difference <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>sex</b> chromosomes. <b>The</b> difference in silent substitution rates <b>between</b> <b>the</b> SlX 4 and SlY 4 genes is too great to be explained solely by a higher per-generation mutation rate in males than females. It is thus probably caused by a difference in per-replication mutation rates <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>sex</b> chromosomes. This suggests that the local mutation rate can change in a relatively short evolutionary time...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> {{offspring}} <b>sex</b> {{ratios of}} parasitoid wasps often {{depend on the}} age of ovipositing females. Physiological constraints such as sperm depletion and senescence are a likely cause. Also, maternal control in response to female age may be an alternative explanation.

Thus, physiological constraints are a likely explanation for the inconsistency in relation to female age for P. nipponica...|$|R
5|$|In most species, {{the sexes}} are {{separate}} {{and there is}} little sexual dimorphism, but a few species are hermaphroditic and some parasitic forms show large differences <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>sexes.</b> Some Cymothoidans are protandrous hermaphrodites, starting life as males and later changing sex, and some Anthuroideans are the reverse, being protogynous hermaphrodites that are born female. Some Gnathiidans males are sessile and live with a group of females. Males have a pair of penises, which may be fused in some species. The sperm is transferred to the female by the modified second pleopod which receives it from the penis and which is then inserted into a female gonopore. The sperm is stored in a special receptacle, a swelling on the oviduct close to the gonopore. Fertilisation only takes place when the eggs are shed soon after a moult, at which time a connection is established between the semen receptacle and the oviduct.|$|E

5|$|The {{white-naped xenopsaris}} was {{described}} in 1869 by the German-Argentine scientist Hermann Burmeister, based on a specimen collected near Buenos Aires.

A 1989 study of anatomy identified Pachyramphus as a sister taxon to Xenopsaris, but the white-naped xenopsaris was kept in its own genus due to several morphological and behavioural differences, namely its smaller size, the shape of its legs, the length of its primary flight feathers, the lack of strong sexual dimorphism (differences <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>sexes)</b> and the construction of the nest.|$|E

Both the European and red-bearded bee-eaters have sex-based differences in their plumage colour, and the female rainbow bee-eater has shorter tail streamers than the male, which terminate in a club-shape that he lacks. There may be instances where bee-eaters are sexually dichromatic at the ultraviolet part of the colour spectrum, which humans cannot see. A study of blue-tailed bee-eater found that males were more colourful than females in UV light. Their overall colour was also affected by body condition, suggesting that there was a signalling component to plumage colour. Juveniles are generally similar to adults, except for the two Nyctyornis species, in which the young have mainly green plumage.|$|E
