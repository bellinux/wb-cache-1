5|$|Most of {{the diverse}} bovid species occur in Africa. The maximum {{concentration}} is in the savannas of eastern Africa. Depending on their feeding habits, several species have radiated over large stretches of land, and hence several variations in dental and limb morphology are observed. Duikers inhabit the equatorial rainforests, sitatunga, and lechwe occur near swamps, eland inhabit grasslands, springbok and oryx occur in deserts, bongo and anoa live in dense forests, and mountain goats and takin live at high altitudes. A few bovid species also occur in Europe, Asia, and North America. Sheep and goats are found primarily in Eurasia, though the <b>Barbary</b> <b>sheep</b> and the ibex form part of the African fauna. The muskox is confined to the arctic tundra. Several bovid species have been domesticated by human beings. The domestication of goats and sheep began 10 thousand years ago, while cattle were domesticated about 7.5 thousand years ago.|$|E
5|$|Most bovids are polygynous. In a few species, {{individuals}} are monogamous, resulting in minimal male-male aggression and reduced selection for large body size in males. Thus, sexual dimorphism is almost absent. Females may be {{slightly larger than}} males, possibly due to competition among females for the acquisition of territories. This {{is the case in}} duikers and other small bovids. The time taken for the attainment of sexual maturity by either sex varies broadly among bovids. Sexual maturity may even precede or follow mating. For instance the impala males, though sexually mature by a year, can mate only after four years of age. On the contrary <b>barbary</b> <b>sheep</b> females may give birth to offspring even before they have gained sexual maturity. The delay in male sexual maturation is more visible in sexually dimorphic species, particularly the reduncines, probably due to competition among males. For instance, the blue wildebeest females become capable of reproduction within a year or two of birth, while the males become mature only when four years old.|$|E
25|$|A {{protected}} {{area in the}} Tibesti range has been proposed to preserve the area's rhim gazelle (Gazella leptoceros) and <b>Barbary</b> <b>sheep</b> (Ammotragus lervia) populations, which are {{the largest in the}} world. The {{protected area}} would be modeled after the Ouadi Rimé-Ouadi Achim Faunal Reserve to the south; however, there is currently insufficient funding available for the project.|$|E
50|$|The Barbaresca or Barbaresca Siciliana is a {{breed of}} large fat-tailed sheep from the Mediterranean island of Sicily, in {{southern}} Italy. It {{derives from the}} cross-breeding between indigenous Sicilian Pinzirita <b>sheep</b> with fat-tailed <b>Barbary</b> (or Barbarin) <b>sheep</b> of Maghrebi origin. These were probably brought to the island after the Muslim conquest of Sicily in the 9th century; Arabic texts preserved at Agrigento document the movement {{of large numbers of}} sheep to the Sicilian interior.|$|R
50|$|The {{origins of}} the Turchessa are unknown. It {{apparently}} originated {{in the foothills of}} Vesuvius, in Campania in southern Italy, in the area of Sarno in the province of Salerno and Avella in the province of Avellino, but is now distributed mainly in the provinces of Avellino and Benevento. Like the Laticauda, distributed in the approximately the same area, and the Barbaresca breed of Sicily, it appears to result from the hybridisation of local breeds with <b>Barbary</b> (or Barbarin) <b>sheep</b> of Maghrebi origin. These may have been brought to the area by the Bourbon king Charles VII of Naples.|$|R
5000|$|The Laticauda is a {{breed of}} {{domestic}} sheep from Campania and Calabria, in southern Italy. It is a fat-tailed breed, which {{gives rise to}} the name Laticauda, [...] "broad-tailed". It is raised mainly in its area of origin in the provinces of Avellino, Benevento and Caserta, but is also found in the provinces of Cosenza, Matera and Naples. Like the Barbaresca breed of Sicily, it appears to result from the hybridisation of local breeds with <b>Barbary</b> (or Barbarin) <b>sheep</b> of Maghrebi origin. It has been suggested that these were first brought to the area by the Bourbon king Charles VII of Naples.|$|R
25|$|The {{following}} year included {{a great number}} of new animal arrivals again. Including Indian antelope, white tailed deer and <b>Barbary</b> <b>sheep</b> from Taronga Zoo, 23 keas from the South Island (two of which went to Dallas Zoo for three armadillos), 20 Australian lizards and two black leopard cubs. In April 1968, Ma Schwe, a female elephant came as a replacement for Jamuna.|$|E
25|$|Mammals of the Western Desert {{have been}} {{depleted}} {{over the years}} and the addax and scimitar oryx are no longer found there, and the Atlas lion has probably gone as well. The remaining mammals include the rhim gazelle, dorcas gazelle, <b>Barbary</b> <b>sheep,</b> Rüppell's fox, lesser Egyptian jerboa and Giza gerbil. Notable birds from this desert include the spotted sandgrouse, greater hoopoe-lark and white-crowned wheatear.|$|E
25|$|The Saharomontane {{flora and}} fauna, {{which include the}} rhim gazelle and <b>Barbary</b> <b>sheep,</b> have adapted to the mountains, yet the climate {{has not always been}} as harsh. Greater {{biodiversity}} existed in the past, as evidenced by scenes portrayed in rock and parietal art found throughout the range, which date back several millennia, even before the arrival of Toubou. The isolation of the Tibesti has sparked the cultural imagination in both art and literature.|$|E
40|$|Since the {{rediscovery of}} the African Wolf, {{a certain level}} of {{uncertainty}} surrounds the ecological status of the golden Jackal in northern Africa. We characterized the trophic spectrum of the 'Golden Jackal' phenotype (distinct from the 'African Wolf' phenotype) and its possible seasonal variations in relation with availability of resources (waste included) in the Djurdjura National Park (DNP), northern Algeria. The analysis of 360 faeces collected over one year shows that 91 % of the items consumed by the Golden Jackal belong to five categories: mammals (27 %), non-energetic plants (20 %), energetic plants (19 %), arthropods (16 %) and waste (10 %). Our results confirm that the Golden Jackal is a generalist and opportunistic predator, with mammals representing the principal energy source. The Golden Jackal in PND shows an original predilection for the mammalian preys of medium size (Wild Boar - the main contributor in terms of biomass - <b>Barbary</b> Macaque and <b>Sheep).</b> This illustrates its potential for maximizing net energy gain (hunting cost vs. biomass supply) thanks to its capacity to reach larger preys. The high indices of trophic diversity observed throughout the year suggest dietary habits following levels of resource availability rather than strict seasonal "specializations". The existence of peaks of consumption of Wild Boars and Barbary Macaques outside 'critical' seasons (spring and winter) together with the weak probability to feed on carcasses (absence of local hunting activities) support the hypothesis of an active hunting of these preys by the Golden Jackal. However, this would imply a behaviour of co-operative hunting seldom observed in Maghreb. The high representation of plants in the trophic spectrum of the Golden Jackal confirms that the diet of the Carnivores from the Mediterranean areas generally includes more vegetable material than in northern latitudes. Waste (as well as livestock and poultry) is a weak contributor to the diet of the Golden Jackal. This is potentially linked {{to the quality of the}} habitat and to the important availability of food items in the DNP...|$|R
25|$|The {{large mammals}} {{present in the}} {{ecoregion}} are the addax (Addax nasomaculatus), <b>Barbary</b> <b>sheep</b> (Ammotragus lervia), dorcas gazelle (Gazella dorcas), and rhim gazelle (Gazella leptoceros). However, rodents are the most represented order of mammals in the Tibesti, and include the Agag gerbil (Gerbillus agag), Balochistan gerbil (Gerbillus nanus), Cairo spiny mouse (Acomys cahirinus), lesser Egyptian jerboa (Jaculus jaculus), Libyan jird (Meriones libycus), Mzab gundi (Massoutiera Mzabi) and the North African gerbil (Gerbillus campestris). Also present are cats such as the African wildcat (Felis silvestris lybica) and, more rarely, the caracal (Caracal caracal) and the Sudan cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus soemmeringii), {{as well as several}} canine species including the Egyptian wolf (Canis anthus lupaster), fennec fox (Vulpes zerda) and Rüppell's fox (Vulpes rueppellii). The striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena) may also occupy the range. There may be as many as 50 endangered painted hunting dogs (Lycaon pictus) in the Tibesti, although some regard these relict populations as extirpated, partially due to the Darfur refugee turmoil and other Sudan generated conflicts. Bats are heavily represented in the Tibesti, including the desert long-eared bat (Otonycteris hemprichii), greater mouse-tailed bat (Rhinopoma microphyllum), Hamilton's tomb bat (Taphozous hamiltoni), Mauritian tomb bat (Taphozous mauritianus) and the trident bat (Asellia tridens). The Cape hare (Lepus capensis), desert hedgehog (Paraechinus aethiopicus), olive baboon (Papio anubis), rock hyrax (Procavia capensis) and the Saharan striped polecat (Ictonyx libyca) also populate the area.|$|E
500|$|Sheep {{entered the}} African {{continent}} {{not long after}} their domestication in western Asia. A minority of historians once posited a contentious African theory of origin for Ovis aries. This theory is based primarily on rock art interpretations, and osteological evidence from <b>Barbary</b> <b>sheep.</b> [...] The first sheep entered North Africa via Sinai, and were present in ancient Egyptian society between eight and seven thousand years ago. Sheep have {{always been part of}} subsistence farming in Africa, but today the only country that keeps significant numbers of commercial sheep is South Africa, with 28.8 million head.|$|E
