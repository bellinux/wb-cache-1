25|$|In 1921 to 1926, William Lyon Mackenzie King's Liberal {{government}} {{pursued a}} conservative domestic policy with {{the object of}} lowering wartime taxes and, especially, cooling wartime ethnic tensions, as well as defusing postwar labour conflicts. The Progressives refused to join the government, but did help the Liberals defeat non-confidence motions. King faced a delicate balancing act of reducing tariffs enough to please the Prairie-based Progressives, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> to alienate his vital support in industrial Ontario and Quebec, which needed tariffs to compete with American imports. King and Conservative leader Arthur Meighen sparred constantly and bitterly in Commons debates. The Progressives gradually weakened. Their effective and passionate leader, Thomas Crerar, resigned {{to return to his}} grain business, and was replaced by the more placid Robert Forke. The socialist reformer J.S. Woodsworth gradually gained influence and power among the Progressives, and he reached an accommodation with King on policy matters.|$|E

[...] Robert Ballantyne of music website Popjournalism described it as [...] "both a peppy pop track and a ballad", and called it Robyn's best single yet, stating, [...] "Producer and long-time Robyn collaborator Klas Åhlund adds {{just the right amount of}} au courant electro-pop into the mix, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> to doom the track to the dance-club ghetto." [...] Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave the song four out of five stars, and wrote that [...] "What began life as a subdued-but-beautiful strings 'n' piano ballad is now a strident electropop tune that percolates as enviably as your next door neighbour's brand new coffee maker." ...|$|E

500|$|Joplin's {{usage of}} Italian tempo {{indications}} in [...] "Magnetic Rag" [...] {{has been interpreted}} as his intention to give the piece a serious aspect {{in a similar manner}} to Treemonisha and [...] "Scott Joplin's New Rag". [...] "Magnetic Rag" [...] begins with the instruction [...] "Allegretto ma non troppo" [...] (moderately fast, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>too</b> <b>much)</b> and continues in the D strain with [...] "Tempo l'istesso" [...] (tempo remains the same), a warning against slowing down for the minor-mode section. As well, Joplin employed in [...] "Magnetic Rag" [...] the classic [...] "common time" [...] 4/4 time signature instead of the more usual 2/4 time of rag tunes. Simultaneously, Joplin doubled all the note values, effectively making the unusual 4/4 time signature have no practical effect on the way the piece sounded or the way it was performed. His publishing it in 4/4 was simply a way to connect the rag with classical and popular piano works of prior fame. Since Joplin published [...] "Magnetic Rag" [...] himself, {{it has been suggested that}} the composition fully reflected his wishes and contained no compromises.|$|E

[...] Stay Alive is heavily considered as Nina's comeback in the recording scene, being described as a mixture of pop, club and R songs which is very different from her previous sound.
