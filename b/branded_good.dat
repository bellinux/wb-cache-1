50|$|Venture brands {{have the}} ability to compete with premium brands as they are {{independent}} brands. Advertising and pricing can create the perception of a premium product for the consumer, therefore encouraging consumers to purchase the venture branded goods. Tesco can also remove existing premium brands that can be viewed as competitors of the venture brand. These actions all encourage consumers to consume the venture <b>branded</b> <b>good,</b> dislodging sales away from existing competitors.|$|E
50|$|The early 2010s were {{a time of}} {{upheaval}} for the WKBW-TV newsroom as Ransom {{and news}} director John Di Sciullo, two key leaders, departed the station (Ransom retired, while Di Sciullo left for WBBZ, where he currently serves as host of that station's game show Bragging Rights!). Ransom's replacement, Nurse, sought to overhaul the relatively undermanned newsroom by increasing the staff and overhauling the morning show. Brought in to host the newly <b>branded</b> <b>Good</b> Morning were out-of-market newcomers Cole Heath and Tiffany Lundberg, with meteorologist and feature reporter Mike Randall held over from the previous staff. However, WIVB-TV strengthened their morning show staff at the same time, undermining any possible gains WKBW-TV may have made with its re-staffing and the morning show lost {{a third of its}} audience in the fall of 2013, even with promos for the morning show during Bills preseason coverage (which may have actually backfired, as the ad campaign had portrayed Heath and Lundberg as unable to pronounce the names of towns in the station's coverage area).|$|E

40|$|Preliminary draft We {{analyze the}} problem faced by {{a firm that}} has to signal qual-ity of its product in a market where it competes against a rival sell-ing a <b>branded</b> <b>good.</b> Firms know qualities perfectly, while {{consumers}} only know {{the quality of the}} <b>branded</b> <b>good.</b> While the literature has stressed the role of prices as signals, absent rivalry and multiple signal senders, we show that in our context advertising can be a more pow-erful signal than price, while price signals may fail. The model we use is just one step away from monopoly and yet it obtains drastically dif-ferent results. Since advertising is typically an oligopoly phenomenon, this suggests that prudence should be exerted in attempting to gener-alize conclusions derived from one-firm models about the role of prices and advertising as signals...|$|E

40|$|In this article, we {{investigate}} private label as goods where quality is known only after consumption by consumers. This particular characteristic {{for the product}} makes the retailer’s reputation a crucial choice especially when he also sells a well-know product as branded goods. We find that for products with low-frequency of purchase, a private label is never introduced because the incentive to milk on quality are higher than the ones to sustain {{the reputation of the}} own-brand good. Besides, the decrease of the production cost is not a sufficient condition to ensure a reputable own-brand. However, taking into account vertical bargaining power of the retailer vis-à-vis the <b>branded</b> <b>good</b> manufacturer reveals that strong retailers are more likely to sustain the reputation of their own-brand, except if the product is characterized with a lowfrequency of purchase. The experience good characteristic seems therefore to be an important element in the explanation of low market share private labels. These unsuccessful products categories are in fact the ones with low-frequency of purchase and/or important national brand loyalty...|$|E

40|$|This Article {{challenges}} the common wisdom about {{the desirability of}} celebrated trademarks. Contrary to the traditional view, it argues that mega-brands are neither economic evils nor is their function limited to imparting information regarding the physical product they flaunt. The Article also rejects the view that famous marks persuade consumers (often referred to as “Snobs”) to “irrationally” pay more for the same physical product they could have purchased for less. Rather, it argues that in purchasing a <b>branded</b> <b>good</b> the consumer is actually purchasing three tied products in one package: a physical product, information about the physical product, and an intangible product such as fame, prestige, peace of mind or a pleasant feeling. Contrary to prior literature, this Article argues that the intangible product benefits both producers and consumers. It explores the demand for the intangible product, its impact on pricing, welfare and consumers’ and producers’ strategies. It argues that under certain conditions one may witness the anomaly {{of an increase in}} both price and output, but that such observation does not mandate the conclusion that consumers are facing an up-sloping demand curve as discussed in the literature of conspicuous goods. Instead, the Article proposes that this phenomenon may occur in the traditional down-sloping demand curves and that it is not limited to goods with conspicuous properties. The Article has normative and descriptive implications with regard to three distinct bodies of law: price discrimination, trademark anti-dilution and trade-name law. A direct result is that mega-brands neither confer a monopoly nor foster price discrimination. On the contrary, they enhance competition in both the physical and intangible spheres. The Article also offers a new rational basis {{for one of the most}} nebulous doctrines in trademark law: anti-dilution. Anti-dilution law provides special protection to famous marks which is not available to regular ones, and has been unanimously enthroned as one which protects only producers but is injurious to consumers. Conversely, this Article argues that anti-dilution law inures to the benefit of both consumers and producers. It attempts to clear the constitutional concerns that have been raised with regard to the doctrine and explains the fame requirement. The article concludes that Snobs are rational and that there are sound economic justifications for the law’s unique protection of famous marks...|$|E
