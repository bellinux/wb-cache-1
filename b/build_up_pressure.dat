A continuous wind tunnel is driven by large fans and typically is only capable of subsonic speeds.

5000|$|Operation {{begins when}} the controller/timer sends {{a signal to}} the pump to start the {{lubrication}} cycle. The pump begins pumping lubricant to <b>build</b> <b>up</b> <b>pressure</b> in the first (the pressure) supply line while simultaneously venting the second (vent) return line.

5000|$|The most {{well known}} {{use of the}} High-Low System was by the U.S. Army with the {{introduction}} of the M79 grenade launcher shortly before the Vietnam War. The M79 fired a 40-mm shell which contained a standard fragmentation grenade with a modified fuze. The cartridge casing contained a heavy cup-shaped [...] "High Pressure Chamber" [...] in the bottom. On firing, the propellant <b>builds</b> <b>up</b> <b>pressure</b> until it breaks through the copper cover, venting out to the [...] "Low Pressure Chamber". The U.S. Army referred to their high-low system as the High-Low Propulsion System.

50|$|Spiral groove {{bearings}} (journal and thrust) are self-acting, or hydrodynamic bearings used {{to reduce}} friction and wear {{without the use of}} pressurized lubricants. They have this ability due to special patterns of grooves. Spiral groove bearings are self-acting because their own rotation <b>builds</b> <b>up</b> the <b>pressure</b> needed to separate the bearing surfaces. For this reason, they are also 'contact-less' bearings.|$|R
50|$|Many {{classical}} cookbooks define duxelles as dehydrated fungi, used as stuffings and pastry fillings. According to Auguste Escoffier, {{the mushrooms}} were dehydrated {{in order to}} enhance flavor and minimize water content. When fresh mushrooms are cooked, they let off enormous amounts of vapor in relation to their size. Fresh mushrooms used as stuffings or pastry fillings could therefore <b>build</b> <b>up</b> <b>pressure</b> inside the dish or pastry, causing it to crack or even explode.|$|E

While the steam brake on a locomotive was very powerful, it took time to <b>build</b> <b>up</b> <b>pressure</b> on the initial application when the metal surfaces were cold; on a second application it was far more rapid, but this would not occur in an emergency.|$|E
50|$|The MIB (Motorcycle {{integral}} Braking system) from Continental Teves and the eCBS (electronic CBS) in {{the enhanced}} Motorcycle ABS from Bosch are results of another approach. These systems {{are based on}} the pump and valve approach. Through additional valves, stronger pumps and a more powerful motor the system can actively <b>build</b> <b>up</b> <b>pressure.</b> The input pressure of the rider is measured with pressure sensors at the lever and pedal. The pump then builds up additional pressure adjusted to riding conditions. A partial integral System is designed for working in one direction only: front→rear or rear→front. A fully integral system works in both directions.|$|E

Lunge-feeding is where a whale rams a bait ball (a swarm of small fish) at high speed. Rorquals generally have streamlined physiques to reduce drag in the water while doing this.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{present a}} concept for autonomous, {{long-term}} and high-pressure fluid transport on disposable microfluidic chips, which are fully bio-compatible and compostable. The actuation principle {{is based on}} ethanol fermentation, a well-known biological process in which yeast cells convert molecules like sucrose into cellular energy and thereby produce ethanol and carbon dioxide (CO 2) as metabolic waste products. A two-chamber fluidic system separated by a flexible membrane is suggested for active fluid transport utilizing a bio-reactor. One chamber, connected to the outside via a pressure-sensitive valve, contains the fluid to be actuated, the other one the culture medium for the yeast cells. Once the yeast cells are injected into the culture medium, ethanol fermentation and thus the production of CO 2 starts, which <b>builds</b> <b>up</b> <b>pressure</b> on the membrane and hence also on the fluid chamber. As soon as the switching point of the pressure sensitive valve is reached, fluid transport at a predefined and constant flow rate starts...|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{anaerobic}} digestion {{is a widely}} applied technology to produce biogas from organic wastes and residues. The biogas calorific value depends on the CH 4 content which generally ranges between 55 and 65 %. Biogas upgrading to so-called ‘green gas’, with natural gas quality, generally proceeds with add-on technologies, applicable only for biogas flows > 100 m 3 /h. In the concept of autogenerative high pressure digestion (AHPD), methanogenic biomass <b>builds</b> <b>up</b> <b>pressure</b> inside the reactor. Since CO 2 has a higher solubility than CH 4, it will proportion more to the liquid phase at higher pressures. Therefore, AHPD biogas is characterised by a high CH 4 content, reaching equilibrium values between 90 and 95 % at a pressure of 3 – 90 bar. In addition, also H 2 S and NH 3 are theoretically more soluble in the bulk liquid than CO 2. Moreover, the water content of the already compressed biogas is calculated to have a dew poin...|$|R
50|$|Turbocharging {{allows for}} more {{efficient}} engine operation {{because it is}} driven by exhaust pressure {{that would otherwise be}} (mostly) wasted, but there is a design limitation known as turbo lag. The increased engine power is not immediately available due to the need to sharply increase engine RPM, to <b>build</b> <b>up</b> <b>pressure</b> and to spin up the turbo, before the turbo starts to do any useful air compression. The increased intake volume causes increased exhaust and spins the turbo faster, and so forth until steady high power operation is reached. Another difficulty is that the higher exhaust pressure causes the exhaust gas to transfer more of its heat to the mechanical parts of the engine.|$|E
50|$|This program aims to <b>build</b> <b>up</b> <b>pressure</b> for {{democratization and}} {{political}} reform by strengthening the active role of citizens and civil society. In working towards this goal, EACPE uses two approaches: First, it attentively observes the political process, thus holding the government accountable. The organization has monitored various elections. For example, it has monitored the parliamentary elections in November-December 2010 {{as part of}} a non-partisan coalition, after the Administrative Court overrode a decision of the Supreme Committee for Elections, which had denied the EACPE permission to observe the elections. The organization also observed the referendum on the constitutional amendments in March 2011 and plans to observe the elections that will take place in 2011 following the resignation of President Hosni Mubarak and the dissolution of parliament.Second, EACPE regularly organizes conferences, workshops and other events for NGOs, politicians and other civil society actors {{as well as for the}} general public, aiming to raise awareness and to build the capacities of the civil society to act towards democratic change.|$|E
5000|$|During the 1950s and 1960s {{there was}} a great burst of {{activity}} by propellant chemists to find high-energy liquid and solid propellants better suited to the military. Large strategic missiles need to sit in land-based or submarine-based silos for many years, able to launch at a moment's notice. Propellants requiring continuous refrigeration, which cause their rockets to grow ever-thicker blankets of ice, were not practical. As the military was willing to handle and use hazardous materials, a great number of dangerous chemicals were brewed up in large batches, most of which wound up being deemed unsuitable for operational systems. In the case of nitric acid, the acid itself (HNO3) was unstable, and corroded most metals, making it difficult to store. The addition of a modest amount of nitrogen tetroxide, N2O4, turned the mixture red and kept it from changing composition, but left the problem that nitric acid corrodes containers it is placed in, releasing gases that can <b>build</b> <b>up</b> <b>pressure</b> in the process. The breakthrough was the addition of a little hydrogen fluoride (HF), which forms a self-sealing metal fluoride on the interior of tank walls that Inhibited Red Fuming Nitric Acid. This made [...] "IRFNA" [...] storeable. Propellant combinations based on IRFNA or pure N2O4 as oxidizer and kerosene or hypergolic (self igniting) aniline, hydrazine or unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) as fuel were then adopted in the United States and the Soviet Union for use in strategic and tactical missiles. The self-igniting storeable liquid bi-propellants have somewhat lower specific impulse than LOX/kerosene but have higher density so a greater mass of propellant can be placed in the same sized tanks.Gasoline was replaced by different hydrocarbon fuels, for example RP-1 - a highly refined grade of kerosene. This combination is quite practical for rockets that need not be stored. , it is used in the first stages of many orbital launchers.|$|E
40|$|The human larynx is a {{versatile}} organ. Main functions are phonation, protection and {{regulation of the}} air ways. Patients suffer severely from the diagnosis of a laryngeal carcinoma of the stages T 3 and T 4. In most cases this diagnosis {{will lead to a}} total laryngectomy, which is usually dissatisfying in the sense of postoperative rehabilitation. The postoperative consequences include the loss of the native voice, the loss of regular air ways via mouth and nose, sense of smell, and the inability to <b>build</b> <b>up</b> an abdominal <b>pressure.</b> In this paper we focus on the feasibility of a modular larynx prosthesis which enables the laryngectomee to talk with his native voice, to breathe via the regular air ways, and to <b>build</b> <b>up</b> abdominal <b>pressure.</b> In particular we will give insights for a postoperative solution - a modular prosthesis based on a biomimetic self-regulating double clack-valve and on a voice reconstruction module, a so called vocoder. The vocoder is a device to reproduce the natural human voice. Most important for the use is an additional device required to analyze, conserve and manage voice characteristics of the patient before surgery. The self-regulating double clack-valve is designed to <b>build</b> <b>up</b> an abdominal <b>pressure</b> e. g. to cough. Therefore, our valve-system is working in both directions - a two-way valve system. By bridging the gap of the regular air ways lost by laryngectomy, the sense of smell and taste are restored.

40|$|Direct current {{operation}} of electroosmotic pumps consumes water and generates electrolysis gas bubbles that can block the working electrode and <b>build</b> <b>up</b> <b>pressure</b> in the pump housing. The {{formation of the}} electrolysis gases can degrade pump performance {{and can lead to}} failure. Although catalysts have been used to recombine the electrolytic gases, current designs are sensitive to orientation relative to gravity making them inappropriate for many portable applications. Here we propose a gas recombination system design that operates independent of pump orientation. The design uses Nafion-sheathed electrodes, a catalyst chamber, and an osmotic membrane to capture and recombine electrolytic gases as well as return the liquid recombination products to the electrolyte reservoir. The pump was tested for 24 h at six major orientations with constant current fluxes. The measured gas chamber pressures and applied pump potentials suggest that the recombination system is functional at all orientations for driving currents of 3 mA and less. © 2007 Elsevier B. V.
