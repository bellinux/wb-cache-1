Circulation processes at the acid waste disposal site are highly event-dominated, {{with the majority}} of the water transport occurring during strong northeasters.

40|$|Computational fluid dynamic {{techniques}} {{have been applied}} to the determination of drag on oceanographic devices (expendable <b>bathythermographs).</b> Such devices, which are used to monitor changes in ocean heat content, provide information that is dependent on their drag coefficient. Inaccuracies in drag calculations can impact the estimation of ocean heating associated with global warming. Traditionally, ocean-heating information was based on experimental correlations which related {{the depth of the}} device to the fall time. The relation of time-depth is provided by a fall-rate equation (FRE). It is known that FRE depths are reasonably accurate for ocean environments that match the experiments from which the correlations were developed. For other situations, use of the FRE may lead to depth errors that preclude XBTs as accurate oceanographic devices. Here, a CFD approach has been taken which provides drag coefficients that are used to predict depths independent of an FRE...|$|R
40|$|Temperature {{profiles}} of the ocean are of interest for weather forecasts, climate studies and oceanography in general. Currently, mostly in situ techniques such as fixed buoys or <b>bathythermographs</b> deliver oceanic temperature profiles. A LIDAR method based on Brillouin scattering is an attractive alternative for remote sensing of such water temperature profiles. It {{makes it possible to}} deliver cost-effective on-line data covering an extended region of the ocean. The temperature measurement is based on spontaneous Brillouin scattering in water. In this contribution, we present the first water temperature measurements using a Yb:doped pulsed fiber amplifier. The fiber amplifier is a custom designed device which can be operated in a vibrational environment while emitting narrow bandwidth laser pulses. The device shows promising performance and demonstrates the feasibility of this approach. Furthermore, the current status of the receiver is briefly discussed; it is based on an excited state Faraday anomalous dispersion optical filter...|$|R
50|$|The <b>bathythermograph,</b> or BT, {{also known}} as the Mechanical <b>Bathythermograph,</b> or MBT; is a small torpedo-shaped device that holds a {{temperature}} sensor and a transducer to detect changes in water temperature versus depth down to a depth of approximately 285 meters (935 feet). Lowered by a small winch on the ship into the water, the BT records pressure and temperature changes on a coated glass slide as it is dropped nearly freely through the water. While the instrument is being dropped, the wire is paid out until it reaches a predetermined depth, then a brake is applied and the BT is drawn back to the surface. Because the pressure is a function of depth (see Pascal's law), temperature measurements can be correlated with the depth at which they are recorded.|$|E

40|$|The {{high cost}} of oceanographic cruises often makes it {{advisable}} to use opportunity vessels for simple measurements, such as determining {{the temperature of the}} water column with expandable <b>bathythermographs</b> (XBT). In this work we examine the goodness and reliability of a method aimed at obtaining the maximum possible information from XBT data, and we apply it to the Canary Islands region. It consists in calculating analytic relations between temperature and salinity from historical conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) data for the region, which are then used to hindcast/forecast the salinity and density distribution, as well as the distribution of other inferred quantities such as velocity. A hindcasting is carried out using direct independent temperature measurements obtained from a hydrographic cruise south of the island of Gran Canaria.

40|$|A new {{technique}} {{for determining the}} depth of expendable <b>bathythermographs</b> (XBTs) is developed. This new method combines a forward-stepping calculation which incorporates all of the forces on the XBT devices during their descent. Of particular note are drag forces which are calculated using a new drag coefficient expression. That expression, obtained entirely from computational fluid dynamic modeling, accounts for local variations in the ocean environment. Consequently, the method allows for accurate determination of depths for any local temperature environment. The results, which are entirely based on numerical simulation, are compared with an experimental descent of an LM-Sippican T- 5 XBT. It is found that the calculated depths differ by less than 3 % from depth estimates using the industry standard FRE. Furthermore, the differences decrease with depth. The computational model allows {{an investigation of the}} fluid patterns along the outer surface of the probe {{as well as in the}} interior channel.

Denner's T-S gradient method, wherein thermal and haline contributions to total geostrophic velocity are distinguishable, expedites calculations and results in velocity fields comparable to those developed by the dynamic method. Thermocline parameters are developed using Boston's objective definition of the thermocline, a statistical curve-fitting technique which develops {{the notion of a}} Gaussian thermocline. Gross features of thermal structure remain fairly consistent during the heating season; however, thermal fronts are observed to vary in time and space.
