40|$|Each chronic {{kidney disease}} may lead to gradual loss of renal {{function}}. Long living with reduced renal function without obvious symptoms and complications is possible. Complications only start occurring clinically at advanced stages of the failure. A disorder of mineral <b>metabolism</b> of <b>bones</b> belongs to the most frequent disorders. The thesis ?The Issues of <b>Bone</b> Mineral <b>Metabolism</b> Disorders in C/Ps with Chronic Kidney Failure? consists of a theoretical part and a practical part. The theoretical part is divided into a medicinal part describing chronic kidney failure and <b>bone</b> mineral <b>metabolism</b> disorders. The second theoretical part deals with nursing care of C/Ps with this disorder. A quantitative method of questionnaire investigation was used for data collection in the practical part. The goal of the thesis was to map and compare knowledge among nurses working at dialysis departments with that of nurses from standard departments and to define the specifics of nursing care of C/Ps with <b>bone</b> mineral <b>metabolism</b> disorders. 5 hypotheses were set to achieve the goal. H 1 : Nurses working at dialysis departments have knowledge {{in the field of}} <b>bone</b> mineral <b>metabolism</b> disorders was confirmed. H 2 : Nurses working at standard departments have knowledge in the field of <b>bone</b> mineral <b>metabolism</b> disorders was confirmed. H 3 : Nurses are interested in education in the field of <b>bone</b> mineral <b>metabolism</b> disorders was also confirmed. H 4 : Nurses working at dialysis departments apply their knowledge to nursing care provided to C/Ps with <b>bone</b> mineral <b>metabolism</b> disorders was confirmed. H 5 : Nurses working at standard departments apply their knowledge to nursing care provided to C/Ps with <b>bone</b> mineral <b>metabolism</b> disorders ? this hypothesis was not confirmed by the research. The results of the bachelor thesis may be provided to the workplaces that participated in the research, they may also serve as input material for a seminar on the same topic.

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{some important}} {{features of the}} normal articular structures and a definition of the degenerative osteo-arthropathy that points the involvement of all the joint structures. The pathogeny of the pathology is tackled by the potential risk factors and by the cartilage-cartilage, synovium-cartilage and bone-cartilage cycles that lay particular emphasis on {{the interaction between the}} different joint structures. The diagnostic tools of the degenerative osteo-arthropathy like the conventional or recent imaging techniques (magnetic resonance imaging, scintigraphy and tomography) and the biomarkers of the cartilage and <b>bone</b> <b>metabolisms</b> are listed. The pathogeny of the degenerative osteo-arthropathy is complex and involves different factors. This disease is characterised by an imbalance between the anabolic and catabolic processes of the cartilage metabolism. Inflammation is also present and lead to the clinical signs. The synovitis, the liberation of degradation mediators, the mechanical stresses and/or the subchondral bone are part of the pathogeny at different degrees. The development of recent imaging techniques and the biomarkers of the cartilage and <b>bone</b> <b>metabolisms</b> allow the precise description of the lesions and give some additional information on the pathogeny of the osteo-arthropathy.

40|$|The elderly chronic {{kidney disease}} (CKD) {{population}} is growing. Both aging and CKD can disrupt calcium (Ca 2 +) homeostasis and cause alterations of multiple Ca 2 +-regulatory mechanisms, including parathyroid hormone, vitamin D, fibroblast growth factor- 23 /Klotho, calcium-sensing receptor and Ca 2 +-phosphate product.

30|$|Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a {{glycoprotein}} {{involved in}} <b>bone</b> <b>metabolisms</b> {{and with a}} regulatory role in immune, skeletal and vascular systems. Recently, circulating OPG levels have emerged as independent biomarkers of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with acute or chronic heart disease, {{as well as in}} the healthy population. Furthermore, OPG has been implicated in various inflammations and linked to diabetes and poor glycaemic control. This review focuses on the relations between circulating OPG levels and cardiovascular complications, with special emphasis on diabetic patients. OPG levels were observed to increase concurrently with the severity of diabetic complications, that is, with the highest circulating OPG levels observed in diabetic patients dying from CVD. Although the clinical prognostic use of OPG may seem far away, OPG does look promising as a biomarker in order to help the cardiologist to a better risk-stratification of the patients.|$|R

25|$|Transgender men {{who have}} been oophorectomized must {{continue}} androgen therapy to avoid premature osteoporosis. Estrogen supplementation is theoretically not usually necessary, as some of the injected testosterone will be aromatized into estrogen sufficient to maintain bone (as it does in cisgender men). However, a single small study of trans men after oophorectomy demonstrated that androgens alone may be insufficient to retard bone loss. (van Kesteren P, et al. “Long-term follow-up of bone mineral density and <b>bone</b> <b>metabolism</b> in transsexuals treated with cross-sex hormones.” Clin Endocrin. 48(3):347-54. 1998.) It is likely the case that pre-oophorectomy, residual estrogen production is protective. However, after oophorectomy, some trans men may have insufficient estrogen to retard bone loss.|$|E
25|$|In {{mice and}} humans, {{alterations}} in serotonin levels and signalling {{have been shown}} to regulate bone mass. Mice that lack brain serotonin have osteopenia, while mice that lack gut serotonin have high bone density. In humans, increased blood serotonin levels {{have been shown to}} be significant negative predictor of low bone density. Serotonin can also be synthesized, albeit at very low levels, in the bone cells. It mediates its actions on bone cells using three different receptors. Through 5-HT1B receptors, it negatively regulates bone mass, while it does so positively through 5-HT2B receptors and 5-HT2C receptors. There is very delicate balance between physiological role of gut serotonin and its pathology. Increase in the extracellular content of serotonin results in a complex relay of signals in the osteoblasts culminating in FoxO1/ Creb and ATF4 dependent transcriptional events. These studies have opened a new area of research in <b>bone</b> <b>metabolism</b> that can be potentially harnessed to treat bone mass disorders.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bone</b> <b>metabolism</b> also changes. Normally, bone is {{laid down}} in the {{direction}} of mechanical stress. However, in a microgravity environment there is very little mechanical stress. This results in a loss of bone tissue approximately 1.5% per month especially from the lower vertebrae, hip and femur. Due to microgravity and the decreased load on the bones, there is a rapid increase in bone loss, from 3% cortical bone loss per decade to about 1% every month the body is exposed to microgravity, for an otherwise healthy adult. The rapid change in bone density is dramatic, making bones frail and resulting in symptoms which resemble those of osteoporosis. On Earth, the bones are constantly being shed and regenerated through a well-balanced system which involves signaling of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. These systems are coupled, so that whenever bone is broken down, newly formed layers take its place—neither should happen without the other, in a healthy adult. In space, however, there is an increase in osteoclast activity due to microgravity. This is a problem, because osteoclasts break down the bones into minerals that are reabsorbed by the body. Osteoblasts are not consecutively active with the osteoclasts, causing the bone to be constantly diminished with no recovery. This increase in osteoclasts activity has been seen particularly in the pelvic region, because this is the region which carries the biggest load with gravity present. A study demonstrated that in healthy mice, osteoclasts appearance increased by 197%, accompanied by a down-regulation of osteoblasts and growth factors that are known to help with the formation of new bone, after only sixteen days of exposure to microgravity. Elevated blood calcium levels from the lost bone result in dangerous calcification of soft tissues and potential kidney stone formation. It is still unknown whether bone recovers completely. Unlike people with osteoporosis, astronauts eventually regain their bone density. After a 3–4 month trip into space, it takes about 2–3 years to regain lost bone density. New techniques are being developed to help astronauts recover faster. Research on diet, exercise and medication may hold the potential to aid the process of growing new bone.|$|E
40|$|Degenerative {{cartilage}} endplate (CEP) shows decreased chondrification {{and increased}} ossification. Cartilage endplate stem cells (CESCs), {{with the capacity}} for chondro-osteogenic differentiation, are responsible for CEP restoration. CEP is avascular and hypoxic, while the physiological hypoxia is disrupted in the degenerated CEP. Hypoxia promoted chondrogenesis but inhibited osteogenesis in CESCs. This tissue-specific differentiation fate of CESCs in response to hypoxia was physiologically significant with regard to CEP maintaining chondrification and refusing ossification. MIF, a downstream target of HIF 1 A, is involved in cartilage and <b>bone</b> <b>metabolisms,</b> although {{little is known about}} its regulatory role in differentiation. In CESCs, MIF was identified as a key point through which HIF 1 A regulated the chondro-osteogenic differentiation.
