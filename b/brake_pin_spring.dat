5000|$|Hammerless and striker-fired, the Steyr M {{features}} a double action only (DAO) pre-set trigger mechanism marketed as a [...] "Reset Action" [...] trigger. When the trigger {{is in the}} forward position, the firing <b>pin</b> <b>spring</b> remains lightly compressed (pre-cocked by the forward motion of the slide as it returns to battery). Pulling the trigger {{all the way to}} the back will compress the firing <b>pin</b> <b>spring</b> completely, draw the firing pin fully to the rear and position the trigger bar to release the firing pin and fire a round. The trigger travel is 4 mm with a pull weight of 25 N.|$|R

5000|$|Many {{users have}} {{reported}} (...) {{problems with the}} quality of the construction of the MagSafe cords, giving the product low marks on the Apple Store's website. Common complaints include plug separating from the cord, transformer shorting, and <b>pin</b> <b>springs</b> losing elasticity.|$|R
2500|$|The slide {{features}} a spring-loaded claw extractor, and the stamped sheet metal ejector is {{pinned to the}} trigger mechanism housing. Pistols after 2002 have a [...] reshaped extractor {{that serves as a}} loaded chamber indicator. When a cartridge is present in the chamber, a tactile [...] metal edge protrudes slightly out immediately behind the ejection port {{on the right side of}} the slide. The striker firing mechanism has a spring-loaded firing pin that is cocked in two stages that the firing <b>pin</b> <b>spring</b> powers. The factory-standard firing <b>pin</b> <b>spring</b> is rated at , but by using a modified firing <b>pin</b> <b>spring,</b> it can be increased to [...] or to [...] When the pistol is charged, the firing pin is in the half-cock position. As the trigger is pulled, the firing pin is then fully cocked. At the end of its travel, the trigger bar is tilted downward by the connector, releasing the firing pin to fire the cartridge. The connector resets the trigger bar so that the firing pin will be captured in half-cock at the end of the firing cycle. This is known as a preset trigger mechanism, referred to as the [...] "Safe Action" [...] trigger by the manufacturer. The connector ensures the pistol can only fire semiautomatically.|$|R
50|$|In {{engineering}} and machine design, a pin is a machine element that secures {{the position of}} two or more parts of a machine relative to each other. A large variety of types has been known for a long time; the most commonly used are solid cylindrical pins, solid tapered pins, groove <b>pins,</b> slotted <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> and spirally coiled <b>spring</b> <b>pins.</b>|$|R
50|$|The first CPX-1 variant, the CPX-2 {{eliminates}} the external manual safety. The CPX-2 {{relies on the}} double action only (DAO) trigger pull, which requires 8.5 to 9 pounds of pressure, to help prevent unintentional discharge. A firing <b>pin</b> <b>spring</b> and low-mass hammer prevent discharge if the handgun is dropped.|$|R
50|$|Seventeen {{parts of}} the M1911 were reduced in size {{for the design of}} the EMP. The slide and frame were both shortened, necessitating changes to the extractor, firing <b>pin,</b> firing <b>pin</b> <b>spring,</b> and trigger bow, as well as the plunger tube. The grip frame {{circumference}} has also been reduced due to the magazine itself being made shorter, front-to-back.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This study firstly {{conducted}} measurement of load history profiles at <b>brake</b> guide <b>pins</b> using strain gages subject to random road load history obtained from vehicle durability tests. Then, this study developed a {{simple mathematical model}} capable of estimating guide pin load history using the principle of energy conservation for a given road load profile. The model took into account the effect of impact that occurs {{from a range of}} acceleration levels and frequency content of the road input. The mathematical model also utilized the measured stiffness of the guide pin specimens and strain versus load relationship to increase the accuracy of the predictions. The estimated loads at a <b>brake</b> guide <b>pin</b> subject to a given random road load history were then computed using the mathematical model and compared to the load history obtained from the measurement. This study also compared cumulative fatigue damages calculated using Smith-Watson-Topper equation with the measured and predicted load profiles at the guide pin. The comparison study showed that the developed simple model is applicable to predict load profiles for fatigue life calculation at <b>brake</b> guide <b>pins...</b>|$|R
50|$|The firing {{mechanism}} {{features a}} two-stage progressive trigger that provides two modes of operation: semi-automatic fire, when the trigger is squeezed momentarily, and fully automatic fire—produced when the trigger is pulled {{all the way}} through and held back. No fire control selector is provided. The Jatimatic features a striker firing mechanism with a fixed firing pin installed inside the bolt (the dual-purpose return spring also serves as the firing <b>pin</b> <b>spring).</b>|$|R

50|$|The Model 1763's {{sturdier}} design {{proved to}} be a bit too heavy, so in 1766 the musket's design was lightened. The barrel wall was thinned, the lock was shortened, the stock was slimmed, and the Model 1763's long iron ramrod cover was replaced by a <b>pinned</b> <b>spring</b> under the breech. The trumpet shaped ramrod of the Model 1763 was also abandoned in favor of a ramrod with a lighter button shaped end.|$|R
5000|$|Slotted <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> are {{cylindrical}} pins rolled from a {{strip of}} material with a slot to allow the pin to have some flexibility during insertion. Slotted <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> are also known as roll pins or [...] "C" [...] pins.|$|R
50|$|A <b>spring</b> <b>pin</b> (also called {{tension pin}} or roll pin) is a {{mechanical}} fastener that secures {{the position of}} two or more parts of a machine relative to each other. <b>Spring</b> <b>pins</b> have a body diameter which is larger than the hole diameter, and a chamfer on either one or both ends to facilitate starting the pin into the hole. The spring action of the pin allows it to compress as it assumes the diameter of the hole. The force exerted by the pin against the hole wall retains it in the hole, therefore a <b>spring</b> <b>pin</b> is considered a self retaining fastener. <b>Spring</b> <b>pins</b> are designed for use in double shear applications.|$|R
50|$|The manual pick gun (or snap gun) {{was invented}} by Ely Epstein. It usually has a trigger that creates a {{movement}} which (like bump keys) transfers sudden energy to the key pins which communicate this to the driver pins causing those pins only to jump, allowing the cylinder to turn freely for a brief moment, until the <b>pin</b> <b>springs</b> return the <b>pins</b> to their locking position. Electric versions are now also common, where by simply pressing a button the pins are vibrated while the normal torsion wrench is being used.|$|R
5000|$|Unusual design {{features}} included {{the safety and}} the magazine. The safety was a lever inset {{into the back of}} the grip and, with the gun cocked, forced backward out of the grip into the [...] "safe" [...] position by spring tension from the firing pin upon depression of a button under the slide. Thus, engaging the safety simultaneously reduced tension on the firing <b>pin</b> <b>spring.</b> To disengage the safety, a shooter simply would squeeze the grip, pressing the lever forward and locking it flush with the back of the frame.|$|R
50|$|The AK-74 was {{designed}} by А.D. Kryakushin's group under the design supervision of Mikhail Kalashnikov and is an adaptation of the 7.62×39mm AKM assault rifle and features several important design improvements. These improvements were primarily the result of converting the rifle to the intermediate-caliber high velocity 5.45×39mm cartridge. In fact, some early models are reported to have been converted AKMs, re-barreled to 5.45×39mm. Compared to the preceding AKM the AK-74 has better effective range, firing accuracy (a main development goal) and reliability. The AK-74 and AKM share an approximate 50% parts commonality (interchangeable most often are <b>pins,</b> <b>springs</b> and screws).|$|R

50|$|When coiled <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> are installed, the {{compression}} {{starts at the}} outer edge and moves through the coils toward the center. Coiled pins continue to flex after insertion when a load {{is applied to the}} pin thus providing excellent performance to counter fatigue in dynamic applications. Coiled <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> were invented by Herman Koehl circa 1948.|$|R

50|$|Like the M1911, the Ruger 1911 {{is single}} action only. It also has {{features}} such as a beavertail grip safety and a manually operated thumb safety. In addition to these two safeties, the Ruger SR1911 also has a sear disconnect, slide stop and half-cock position. Although Colt's 80 series developed a trigger operated firing pin block safety, and Kimber and Smith & Wesson use a Swartz firing-pin safety, which is operated by the grip safety; the Ruger SR1911 pistol features a titanium firing pin and heavy firing <b>pin</b> <b>spring,</b> which negates {{the need for a}} firing pin block, offering an updated safety feature without compromising trigger pull weight.|$|R

50|$|During {{development}} it is {{not practical}} to solder BGAs into place, and sockets are used instead, but tend to be unreliable. There are two common types of socket: the more reliable type has <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> that push up under the balls, although it does not allow using BGAs with the balls removed as the <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> may be too short.|$|R
5000|$|Apart from short level {{sections}} through [...] and [...] stations {{the line}} climbed southwards on a significant gradient, with the steepest stretch at 1 in 45. As a result, all locomotive-hauled trains had to propel their loads uphill {{from the main}} line and all goods trains had to run downhill with <b>brakes</b> <b>pinned</b> down. British railway convention was to designate directions on all lines as [...] "Up" [...] or [...] "Down", when applied to the Dyserth branch this resulted in uphill being Down and downhill being Up. There were many curves, the sharpest having a radius of 11 ch m. These factors combined to necessitate ruling speed limits of 20 mph for trains climbing to Dyserth and 25 mph {{back to the main}} line. These limits were lowered to 15 mph over level crossings and 10 mph approaching the junction with the main line. In practice the heavy loads, curves, visibility and gradients confined speeds to around 10 mph throughout.|$|R
50|$|The bolt {{houses the}} firing pin {{mechanism}} that visually and tactilely protrudes {{from the rear of}} the bolt indicating if the action is cocked or not. A small disassembly button offers the possibility to access the firing <b>pin</b> and <b>spring.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{standard}} {{models have}} an ambidextrous manual safety/decocker {{located on the}} slide; when the safety lever is lowered to the safe position, the firing pin is cammed into the slide away from the hammer, the trigger is disconnected from the sear, and the hammer is decocked. The decocker models have no manual safety; instead, when the lever is lowered, it only cams the firing pin into the slide and drops the hammer. When the lever is released, the firing <b>pin</b> <b>springs</b> back to the normal position. The DAO models have no manual safety or decocker. All models feature an automatic firing pin safety that blocks the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully rearward.|$|R
50|$|Looking {{into the}} {{detailed}} {{design of the}} mechanism, the two sides had further agreed that the capture latches would follow the design developed at MSC and the structural latches and ring would follow the Soviet pattern. These paired sets of hooks had been successfully used on both Soyuz and Salyut. In addition, the group concurred on details regarding the alignment <b>pins,</b> <b>spring</b> thrusters (to assist in {{the separation of the}} spacecraft at undocking), and electrical connector locations. To evaluate the docking system concept and to ensure the establishment of compatibility at an early point in the development, the men planned to build a two-fifths-scale test model, the exact details of which would be decided at the next joint meeting.|$|R

50|$|Applications {{for use in}} this {{industry}} {{take full advantage of}} the many benefits electroless nickel has to offer. Deposit properties such as uniformity, corrosion resistance, lubricity and wear resistance are all reasons why the use of EN for automotive applications continues to grow. Historically, a cost sensitive market segment, auto makers have embraced the use low cost materials plated with a thin film of electroless nickel to meet strict requirements in an economical fashion. Fuel injection systems, aluminum fuel filters, <b>brake</b> <b>pins</b> and bleed valves are just a few applications that take full advantage of the deposit’s corrosion resistance. Differential pinion shafts and a variety of pins and washers are plated in large quantities due to the coatings lubricity, wear resistance and anti-galling properties (Figure 15). Brake pistons are plated in bright, medium phosphorus electroless nickel and heat treated to increase hardness and wear resistance. High deposit luster is desired and actually improves the surface finish of the piston resulting in reduced friction (Figure 16). Cast iron slip yokes are plated with EN to eliminate noise associated with galling.|$|R
