40|$|Pestiviruses are enveloped {{single-chain}} {{ribonucleic acid}} viruses {{with a positive}} polarity. Pestiviruses include the viruses of classical swine fever (hog cholera), <b>Border</b> <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> <b>sheep,</b> mucosal disease of cattle, and isolates obtained from wild animals, such as red deer (Cervus elaphus). Among ruminants, pestiviruses have developed a remarkable strategy for assuring their persistence. Through epigenetic transmission, they lead {{to the birth of}} asymptomatic carrier animals harbouring non-cytopathic variants, which become immunotolerant to the strain of virus present. The presence of a small number of asymptomatic carriers enables the virus to circulate within a herd by horizontal transmission, leading to the birth {{of a new generation of}} asymptomatic carriers.

40|$|The polyprotein of {{classical}} swine fever virus starts with the nonstructural protein p 23, which {{is followed by the}} nucleocapsid protein p 14. Proteolytic cleavage between p 23 and p 14 was demonstrated in a cell-free transcription-translation system. Successive truncation of the cDNA used for the transcription indicated that the proteolytic activity responsible for the cleavage between p 23 and p 14 resides within p 23. In order to determine the cleavage site between these two proteins, the respective genomic regions were expressed in two different expression systems. N-terminal sequencing of the resulting p 14 -related proteins revealed that cleavage occurs between Cys- 168 and Ser- 169. Comparison of the sequence around the cleavage site with sequences of other pestiviruses suggests a conserved processing site between similar proteins. The genus Pestivirus, family Flaviviridae (27), comprises three members which cause economically important animal diseases: {{classical swine fever}} (formerly termed hog cholera), bovine viral diarrhea, and <b>border</b> <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> <b>sheep.</b> The pestivirus genome is represented by a single-stranded RNA of about 12. 5 kb which is of positive polarity and comprises a single large open reading frame (ORF) (5, 7, 12).

40|$|Bovine viral {{diarrhea}} (BVD) is {{a common}} viral infection of cattle worldwide. The viruses responsible for BVD are classified as pestiviruses, a group of viruses that includes BVDV type I and type II, <b>Border</b> <b>disease</b> virus <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> and hog cholera virus. Although BVD was first recognized as a <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> cattle 50 years ago, the genetics and epidemiology of BVD viruses have only been well-described in the last 10 years. These scientific advances have increased the accuracy of diagnostic testing for BVD and clarified the diseases caused by BVD viruses. BVD is a confusing topic because the viruses cause a variety <b>of</b> <b>diseases</b> including diarrhea, hemorrhagic syndrome, peracute death syndrome, mucosal disease, infertility, abortions and weak calves. Producers can use new information about BVD viruses and their transmission to prevent the introduction of BVD into beef herds or eliminate BVD viruses from infected herds...|$|R
40|$|Pestiviruses cause {{economically}} important diseases among domestic ruminants and pigs, {{but they}} may also infect {{a wide spectrum of}} wild species of even-toed ungulates (Artiodactyla). Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) and <b>Border</b> <b>disease</b> virus <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> infect their hosts either transiently or persistently. Cellular and humoral immunotolerance to the infecting strain is a unique feature of persistent infection (PI) by ruminant pestiviruses. Persistence, caused by transplacental infection early in fetal development, depends on virally encoded interferon antagonists that inactivate the host's innate immune response to the virus without globally interfering with its function against other viruses. At epidemiological equilibrium, approximately 1 - 2 % of animals are PI. Successful BVDV control programs show that removal of PI animals results in viral extinction in the host population. The nucleotide sequences of ruminant pestiviruses change little during persistent infection. Nevertheless, they display large heterogeneity, pointing to a long history of virus-host coevolution in which avirulent strains are more successful...|$|R
40|$|Bovine viral diarrhea- and <b>Border</b> <b>disease</b> viruses <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> {{belong to}} the highly diverse genus pestivirus of the Flaviviridae. Ruminant pestiviruses may infect {{a wide range of}} {{domestic}} and wild cloven-hooved mammals (artiodactyla). Due to its economic importance, programs to eradicate bovine viral diarrhea are a high priority in the cattle industry. By contrast, <b>Border</b> <b>disease</b> is not a target of eradication, although the <b>Border</b> <b>disease</b> virus is known to be capable of also infecting cattle. In this work, we compared single dose experimental inoculation <b>of</b> calves with <b>Border</b> <b>disease</b> virus with co-mingling <b>of</b> calves with <b>sheep</b> persistently infected with this virus. As indicated by seroconversion, infection was achieved only in one out of seven calves with a dose <b>of</b> <b>Border</b> <b>disease</b> virus that was previously shown to be successful in calves inoculated with BVD virus. By contrast, all calves kept together with persistently infected sheep readily became infected with <b>Border</b> <b>disease</b> virus. The ease of viral transmission from sheep to cattle and the antigenic similarity of bovine and ovine pestiviruses may become a problem for demonstrating freedom of BVD by serology in the cattle population...|$|R
40|$|Bovine viral {{diarrhea}} virus (BVDV), {{together with}} Classical {{swine fever virus}} (CSFV) and <b>Border</b> <b>disease</b> virus (BDV) <b>of</b> <b>sheep,</b> belongs to the genus Pestivirus of the Flaviviridae. BVDV is either cytopathic (cp) or non-cytopathic (ncp), as defined by its effect on cultured cells. Infection of pregnant animals with the ncp biotype {{may lead to the}} birth of persistently infected calves that are immunotolerant to the infecting viral strain. In addition to evading the adaptive immune system, BVDV evades key mechanisms of innate immunity. Previ-ously, we showed that ncp BVDV inhibits the induction of apoptosis and alpha/beta interferon (IFN-/) synthesis by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Here, we report that (i) both ncp and cp BVDV block the induction by dsRNA of the Mx protein (which can also be induced in the absence of IFN signaling); (ii) neither biotype blocks the activity of IFN; and (iii) once infection is established, BVDV is largely resistant to the activity of IFN-/ but (iv) does not interfere with the establishment of an antiviral state induced by IFN-/ against unrelated viruses. The results of our study suggest that, in persistent infection, BVDV is able to evade a central element of innate immunity directed against itself without generally compromising its activity against unre-lated viruses (“nonself”) that may replicate in cells infected with ncp BVDV. This highly selective “self ” and “nonself ” model of evasion of the interferon defense system may be a key element in the success of persistent infection in addition to immunotolerance initiated by the early time point of fetal infection...|$|R
