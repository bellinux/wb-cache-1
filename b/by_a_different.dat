5|$|A {{number of}} Manchester United players, {{including}} {{some of those who}} lost their lives in the Munich air disaster of February 1958, lived in lodgings at 19 Gorse Avenue. A blue plaque was unveiled at the house by former lodger and Munich survivor Sir Bobby Charlton in recognition of the house's association with Manchester United. The owner of the house during the 1950s was Margaret Watson, although {{by the time of the}} plaque's unveiling more than 50 years later it was occupied <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> family.|$|E
5|$|By May 1786, Raspe {{no longer}} had control over the book, which was taken over <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> publisher, G. Kearsley. Kearsley, {{intending}} the book for a higher-class audience than the original editions had been, commissioned extensive additions and revisions from other hands, including new stories, twelve new engravings, and much rewriting of Raspe's prose. This third edition was sold at two shillings, twice {{the price of the}} original, as Gulliver Revived, or the Singular Travels, Campaigns, Voyages, and Adventures of Baron Munikhouson, commonly pronounced Munchausen.|$|E

5|$|For {{the third}} time in as many serials the title role was played <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> actor, this time by André Morell; the part had {{initially}} been offered to Alec Clunes, but he declined it. Morell had a reputation for playing authority figures, such as Colonel Green in The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957), and had previously worked with Kneale and Cartier when he appeared as O'Brien in their BBC television adaptation of Nineteen Eighty-Four (1954). He had been the first actor offered the part of Quatermass, for the original serial The Quatermass Experiment in 1953; he turned the part down. Morell's portrayal of Quatermass has been described as the definitive interpretation of the character.|$|E

5|$|From 1865 to 1870, Morris {{worked on}} another epic poem, The Earthly Paradise. Designed as a homage to Chaucer, it {{consisted}} of 24 stories, adopted from an array of different cultures, and each <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> narrator; set in the late 14th century, the synopsis revolved around a group of Norsemen who flee the Black Death by sailing away from Europe, on the way discovering an island where the inhabitants continue to venerate the ancient Greek gods. Published in four parts by F. S. Ellis, it soon gained a cult following and established Morris' reputation as a major poet.|$|E

5|$|Historians are {{agreed that}} the {{introduction}} and conclusion were added <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> author {{than that of the}} Libellus. Who that was, however, is open to debate. The historian C. W. David felt that it was {{based on the work of}} the chronicler Symeon of Durham, which thus made a credible date for the creation sometime between 1109 and 1129. David also felt that the Vita was used by a later work of Symeon's, the Historia Regum. Offler, however, felt that although Symeon knew of the Libellus, there was no evidence that he used the Vita, which would leave the author of the Vita unclear.|$|E

5|$|In {{the letter}} column of issue 26, Rucka {{announced}} a six-issue limited series titled Lazarus: X+66 {{would be released}} monthly beginning July 2017. The series is written by Rucka and Troutman, and each issue focuses on an individual supporting character from the main series. Lark is involved as a consultant, and each issue is drawn <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> artist. This {{decision was made to}} give Lark time to work on something unrelated to Lazarus, which had been his only project since the series began. He will return with the main series in 2018. A four-page preview of the first installment, drawn by Steve Lieber, was included with the book's solicitation in Image Plus #16.|$|E
5|$|Metroid Prime Pinball {{uses the}} basic {{mechanics}} of pinball, complete {{with an assortment}} of typical pinball items including flippers, spinners, bumpers, and ramps. In addition, new mechanics are introduced, such as enemies that wander around the table, wall jumping, and the ability to fire weapons. The Nintendo DS's touchscreen can be used to nudge the pinball table and alter the ball's trajectory. The game consists of six pinball tables, each inspired <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> area of Metroid Prime. Each table is shown across both screens of the Nintendo DS. Only two tables are initially available for play: Pirate Frigate and Tallon Overworld. After playing either of the first two tables, the player unlocks two more tables: Phendrana Drifts and Phazon Mines. In either table, the player must battle a boss to complete it.|$|E

5|$|One of Metternich's first tasks was to {{push for}} the {{marriage}} of Napoleon to Archduchess Marie Louise {{rather than to the}} Tsar's youngest sister Anna Pavlovna. Metternich would later seek to distance himself from the marriage by claiming it was Napoleon's own idea, but this is improbable; in any case, he was happy to claim responsibility at the time. By 7 February Napoleon had agreed and the pair were married by proxy on 11 March. Marie Louise left for France soon after and Metternich followed <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> route and unofficially. The trip was designed, Metternich explained, to transport his family (stranded in France by the outbreak of war) home and to report to the Austrian Emperor about Marie Louise's activities.|$|E
5|$|Oneida I and Oneida II were litigated as {{test cases}} by both sides; the Oneidas {{suit against the}} {{counties}} for 200 years of damages was stayed pending its resolution.

The same laches defense defeated the larger Oneida claim. The Oneida and the United States petitioned the Supreme Court for certiorari on May 16, 2011. The Court denied certiorari on October 17, with Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor dissenting from the denial.|$|E
5|$|Released nearly 8 {{months after}} the first two Zelda CD-i games, Zelda's Adventure was created <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> {{third-party}} developer, Viridis. The game again follows a nontraditional Zelda-saves-Link plotline, but it uses a different game engine than Faces of Evil and Wand of Gamelon. Whereas the first two CD-i games were patterned on the side-scrolling Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, Zelda's Adventure took the top-down The Legend of Zelda as its model. Zelda's Adventure featured FMV cutscenes, but rather than using drawn animation, the game used live-action scenes. Reception for the game was poor, and whereas some modern critics have given more nuanced reviews {{of the first two}} games, modern criticism for Zelda's Adventure is unanimously negative.|$|E
