5|$|As it has <b>been</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> {{creation}} of the Auxois stud book, only purebred horses and Ardennes and Trait du Nord crosses are allowed to be registered. This is to ensure selection for the desired breed characteristics, which are now a lighter and more active horse than was seen {{during the time of}} breeding for horse meat. Horses bred through artificial insemination and embryo transfer are allowed to be registered; those potentially bred through cloning are not. The Syndicat du Cheval de Trait Auxois (Auxois Draft Horse Association) is the national registry, managing the stud book, breed standard and promotion of the breed. An annual breed competition is held in September in Semur-en-Auxois.|$|E
5|$|In 1534, the Spanish Crown reorganised {{the area}} of Honduras into the Provincia de Higueras e Cabo de Honduras ("Province of Higueras and Cape of Honduras"). The western portion, from the Golfo Dulce, now in Guatemala, to the Ulúa valley and Naco, was defined as Higueras; the eastern portion was Honduras, {{including}} Trujillo, the Valley of Olancho, and extending as far as Cape Camarón. Although organised as two territories, it effectively comprised one province, {{often referred to as}} Honduras-Higueras. In 1534, Honduras-Higueras was removed from the jurisdiction of New Spain, where it had <b>been</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> late 1520s, and returned to that of the audiencia of Santo Domingo.|$|E
5|$|Racial {{tensions}} increased {{after the}} United States Supreme Court's 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of Education to end segregation in public education, which it ruled as unconstitutional. Many segregationists believed the ruling {{would lead to}} interracial dating and marriage. Whites strongly resisted the court's ruling; one Virginia county closed all its public schools to prevent integration. Other jurisdictions simply ignored the ruling. In other ways, whites used stronger measures to keep blacks politically disenfranchised, which they had <b>been</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> turn of the century. Segregation in the South was used to constrain blacks forcefully from any semblance of social equality.|$|E

5|$|Bath Rugby is a rugby union {{team in the}} Aviva Premiership league. It {{plays in}} black, blue and white kit at the Recreation Ground in the city, where it has <b>been</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> late 19th century, {{following}} its establishment in 1865. The team's first major honour was winning the John Player Cup, now sponsored as the LV Cup and {{also known as the}} Anglo-Welsh Cup, four years consecutively from 1984 until 1987. The team then led the Courage league in six seasons in eight years between 1988–89 and 1995–96, during which time it also won the renamed Pilkington Cup in 1989, 1990, 1992, 1994, 1995 and 1996. It finally won the Heineken Cup in the 1997–98 season, and topped the Zürich Premiership (now Aviva Premiership) in 2003–04. The team's squad includes several members who also play, or have played in the English national team, including Lee Mears, Rob Webber, Dave Attwood, Nick Abendanon and Matt Banahan. Colston's School, Bristol, has had a large input in the team over the past decade, providing several current 1st XV squad members. The former England Rugby Team Manager and former Scotland national coach Andy Robinson used to play for Bath Rugby team and was captain and later coach. Both of Robinson's predecessors, Clive Woodward and Jack Rowell, as well as his successor Brian Ashton, were also former Bath coaches and managers.|$|E
5|$|Hadspen {{has grown}} without any area {{set aside for}} small {{commercial}} operations, a fact {{that has led to}} just a single shopping complex. There was another service station, in the main street, but it closed in 2008 after operating for approximately forty years. Rutherglen is a holiday village, conference and event centre, and retirement village on the town's west. It is the only premises in Hadspen with a general liquor licence. Rutherglen, or a similarly named premises at the same location, has been used for accommodation since at least 1923. The town has access to reticulated water and sewerage. The town's sewerage has <b>been,</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> mid-1970s, processed at a plant near Carrick that also serves that town. Treated waste-water from there is discharged into a tributary of the Liffey River.|$|E
5|$|In the 2011 census, 59.4% of the {{population}} of England specified their religion as Christian, 24.7% answered that they had no religion, 5% specified that they were Muslim, while 3.7% of {{the population}} belongs to other religions and 7.2% did not give an answer. Christianity is the most widely practised religion in England, as it has <b>been</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> Early Middle Ages, although it was first introduced much earlier in Gaelic and Roman times. This Celtic Church was gradually joined to the Catholic hierarchy following the 6th-century Gregorian mission to Kent led by StAugustine. The established church of England is the Church of England, which left communion with Rome in the 1530s when HenryVIII was unable to annul his divorce to the aunt of the king of Spain. The church regards itself as both Catholic and Protestant.|$|E

5|$|The {{expectation}} had <b>been</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> 1920s that undergraduates {{would spend}} {{at least one of}} their years living in College; however, post-war expectations grew and Brasenose began another construction programme to ensure it could house students for longer. Designs were drawn up by Philip Powell and Hidalgo Moya, in a then-modern style. The new buildings cost £76,000 to design, housing 32 rooms, and forming staircases XVI, XVII and XVIII. The architecture, which has since come to be thoroughly disliked, was praised. The rather more popular rooms on the Frewin site were also constructed, at a total cost of £3million, including commercial units. In 1996, the St Cross Building was finished; in 1997 the final extensions to Frewin were completed, allowing the college to house all undergraduates for the duration of their course. Finances had been secured with a late revival, and accounts early in the twenty-first century showed a 6% surplus and a ranking of 13th out of 36th in endowment income.|$|E
5|$|The {{reign of}} Djedkare Isesi heralded a new {{period in the}} history of the Old Kingdom. First, Djedkare Isesi did not build a sun temple, as his {{predecessors}} had done since the time of Userkaf, some 80 years earlier. This may be a result of the increased prominence of Osiris compared with the sun god Ra during the late Fifth Dynasty. The importance of this cult becomes manifest when the Pyramid Texts of the pyramid of Unas are inscribed a few decades later. In this context, it is perhaps noteworthy that the only known statue of Djedkare Isesi was discovered in the ruins of the temple of Osiris, in Abydos. Another manifestation of the winds of change during Djedkare's time on throne is the confirmation of the relocation of the royal necropolis from Abusir, where it had <b>been</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> reign of Sahure, to Saqqara, where Menkauhor Kaiu, Djedkare and his successor, Unas, built their pyramids. Abusir may have become overcrowded by the time of Menkauhor's accession and the capital may have been shifted south to Saqqara along with the royal necropolis around the same time. The abandonment of Abusir as a royal necropolis and the termination of sun temple building are possibly related given the close association between the two since the reign of Userkaf.|$|E
