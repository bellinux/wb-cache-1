40|$|AbstractActive sodium-glucose {{transporters}} {{play a role}} to {{glucose homeostasis}} and represent novels targets {{for the management of}} type 2 diabetes (T 2 D). Sodium-glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT 1) is essential for intestinal glucose absorption from the lumen into enterocytes, whereas glucose reabsorption by the kidney is mainly mediated by sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT 2). SGLT 2 inhibitors were developed to occlude SGLT 2 glucose reabsorption pathway and cause glycosuria, thereby reducing plasma glucose concentrations. This new class of antidiabetic drugs {{has been shown to be}} effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with T 2 D. Initial clinical studies also suggest that SGLT 1 inhibition increases glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP- 1) secretion and decreases postchallenge <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> <b>excursion,</b> resulting in a dose-dependent improvement of glucose control. In parallel, we recently identified a previously unknown effect of bile diversion in gastric bypass on sodium glucose transport and postprandial glucose homeostasis, through the modulation of intestinal trafficking of endogenous sodium. This mechanism is consistent with available clinical evidence, and opens up new perspectives in metabolic surgery. More generally, the modulation of intestinal sodium-glucose cotransport appears to be a promising avenue to prevent or treat T 2 D...|$|E

Materials and methods A total of 30 male Wistar rats weighing 200 - 300 g were allocated into a high-fat diet group (HFD) (55 % fat-enriched chow, ad lib, n = 15) and a standard-diet group (CD) standard chow, ad lib, n = 15), for 19 weeks. ITT was determined at baseline and in the 19 th week. HOMA-IR was determined between the 18 - 19 th week in three different days and the mean was considered for analysis. Area under the curve (AUC-ITT) of the <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> <b>excursion</b> along 120 minutes after intra-peritoneal insulin injection was determined and correlated with the corresponding fasting values for HOMA-IR. Results AUC-ITT and HOMA-IR were significantly greater after 19 th week in HFD compared to CD (p < 0. 001 for both). AUC-OGTT was also higher in HFD rats (p = 0. 003). HOMA-IR was strongly correlated (Pearson&# 8217;s) with AUC-ITT r = 0. 637; p < 0. 0001. ROC curves of HOMA-IR and AUC-ITT showed similar sensitivity and specificity.

40|$|Background:Whey {{proteins}} have insulinotropic {{effects and}} reduce the postprandial glycemia in healthy subjects. The mechanism is not known, but insulinogenic amino acids and the incretin hormones seem to be involved. Objective:The aim was to evaluate whether supplementation of meals with a high glycemic index (GI) with whey proteins may increase insulin secretion and improve blood glucose control in type 2 diabetic subjects. Design:Fourteen diet-treated subjects with type 2 diabetes were served a high-GI breakfast (white bread) and subsequent high-GI lunch (mashed potatoes with meatballs). The breakfast and lunch meals were supplemented with whey on one day; whey was exchanged for lean ham and lactose on another day. Venous blood samples were drawn before and during 4 h after breakfast and 3 h after lunch for the measurement of blood glucose, serum insulin, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP- 1). Results:The insulin responses were higher after both breakfast (31 %) and lunch (57 %) when whey {{was included in the}} meal than when whey was not included. After lunch, the blood glucose response was significantly reduced [– 21 %; 120 min area under the curve (AUC) ] after whey ingestion. Postprandial GIP responses were higher after whey ingestion, whereas no differences were found in GLP- 1 between the reference and test meals. Conclusions:It can be concluded that the addition of whey to meals with rapidly digested and absorbed carbohydrates stimulates insulin release and reduces postprandial <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> <b>excursion</b> after a lunch meal consisting of mashed potatoes and meatballs in type 2 diabetic subjects...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: A {{physiological}} {{adaptation to}} a sugar-rich meal {{is achieved by}} increased sugar uptake to match dietary load, resulting from a rapid transient translocation of the fructose/glucose GLUT 2 transporter to the brush border membrane (BBM) of enterocytes. The {{aim of this study}} was to define the contributors and physiological mechanisms controlling intestinal sugar absorption, focusing on the action of insulin and the contribution of GLUT 2 -mediated transport. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The studies were performed in the human enterocytic colon carcinoma TC 7 subclone (Caco- 2 /TC 7) cells and in vivo during hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp experiments in conscious mice. Chronic high-fructose or high-fat diets were used to induce glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in mice. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: In Caco- 2 /TC 7 cells, insulin action diminished the transepithelial transfer of sugar and reduced BBM and basolateral membrane (BLM) GLUT 2 levels, demonstrating that insulin can target sugar absorption by controlling the membrane localization of GLUT 2 in enterocytes. Similarly, in hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp experiments in sensitive mice, insulin abolished GLUT 2 (i. e., the cytochalasin B-sensitive component of fructose absorption), decreased BBM GLUT 2, and concomitantly increased intracellular GLUT 2. Acute insulin treatment before sugar intake prevented the insertion of GLUT 2 into the BBM. Insulin resistance in mice provoked a loss of GLUT 2 trafficking, and GLUT 2 levels remained permanently high in the BBM and low in the BLM. We propose that, in addition to its peripheral effects, insulin inhibits intestinal sugar absorption to prevent excessive <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> <b>excursion</b> after a sugar meal.

40|$|Abstract Background It {{has been}} {{established}} that careful diabetes self-management is essential in avoiding chronic complications that compromise health. Disciplined diet control and regular exercise are the keys for the type 2 diabetes self-management. An ability to maintain one's blood glucose at a relatively flat level, not fluctuating wildly with meals and hypoglycemic medical intervention, would be the goal for self-management. Hemoglobin A 1 c (HbA 1 c or simply A 1 c) {{is a measure of}} a long-term blood plasma glucose average, a reliable index to reflect one's diabetic condition. A simple regimen that could reduce the elevated A 1 c levels without altering much of type 2 diabetic patients' daily routine denotes a successful self-management strategy. Methods A relatively simple model that relates the food impact on blood glucose excursions for type 2 diabetes was studied. Meal is treated as a bolus injection of glucose. Medical intervention of hypoglycaemic drug or injection, if any, is lumped with secreted insulin as a damping factor. Lunch was used for test meals. The recovery period of a <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> <b>excursion</b> returning to the pre-prandial level, the maximal reach, and the area under the excursion curve were used to characterize one's ability to regulate glucose metabolism. A case study is presented here to illustrate the possibility of devising an individual-based self-management regimen. Results Results of the lunch study for a type 2 diabetic subject indicate that the recovery time of the post-prandial blood glucose level can be adjusted to 4 hours, which is comparable to the typical time interval for non-diabetics: 3 to 4 hours. A moderate lifestyle adjustment of light supper coupled with morning swimming of 20 laps in a 25 m pool for 40 minutes enabled the subject to reduce his A 1 c level from 6. 7 to 6. 0 in six months and to maintain this level for the subsequent six months. Conclusions The preliminary result of this case study is encouraging. An individual life-style adjustment can be structured from the extracted characteristics of the post-prandial blood glucose excursions. Additional studies are certainly required to draw general applicable guidelines for lifestyle adjustments of type 2 diabetic patients. </p...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE — To {{assess the}} effect of a 4 -week {{adjunctive}} therapy of exenatide (EXE) (5 – 10 �g b. i. d.) or sitagliptin (SITA) (100 mg once daily) in response to a standardized breakfast meal challenge in 48 men or women with type 2 diabetes receiving insulin glargine (GLAR) � metformin (MET). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — This was a single-center, randomized, openlabel, active comparator–controlled study with a three-arm parallel group design, consisting of: screening, 4 - to 8 -week run-in period, 4 -week treatment period, and follow-up. In all three groups, the GLAR dose was titrated according to an algorithm (fasting blood glucose � 100 mg/dl). RESULTS — The unadjusted 6 -h postprandial <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> <b>excursion</b> of both GLAR � MET � EXE and GLAR � MET � SITA was statistically significantly smaller than that of GLAR � MET (606 � 104 vs. 612 � 133 vs. 728 � 132 mg/dl/h; P � 0. 0036 and 0. 0008). A 1 C significantly decreased in all three groups (P � 0. 0001), with the greatest reduction of � 1. 9 � 0. 7 under GLAR � MET � EXE (GLAR � MET � SITA � 1. 5 � 0. 7; GLAR � MET � 1. 2 � 0. 5 %-points; GLAR � MET � EXE vs. GLAR � MET P � 0. 0154). The American Diabetes Association A 1 C target of � 7. 0 % was reached by 80. 0, 87. 5, and 62. 5 % of subjects, respectively. GLAR � MET � EXE had the highest number (47) of adverse events, mostly gastrointestinal (56 %) with one dropout. GLAR � MET or GLAR � MET � SITA only had 10 and 12 adverse events, respectively, and no dropouts. Hypoglycemia (blood glucose � 50 mg/dl) rates were low and comparable among groups. Weight decreased with GLAR � MET � EXE (� 0. 9 � 1. 7 kg; P � 0. 0396) and increased slightly with GLAR � MET (0. 4 � 1. 5 kg; NS; GLAR � MET � EXE vs. GLAR � MET P � 0. 0377).

These associations were independent of several factors, including severity of disease and also diabetic status. One salient finding in the present analysis was that the associations between bolus infusions of hydrocortisone and glycemic variability and insulin infusion rate variability were less strong in patients who were more severely ill.

METHODS: Eleven male type 2 diabetes patients (59 +/- 2 yr) performed an acute bout of exercise. One day before the exercise bout, a continuous glucose monitoring system (GlucoDay, A.

We have shown that the dynamics of some postprandial <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> <b>excursions</b> can be described by a reduced (linear) model, previously seen in the literature. A comprehensive analysis demonstrates that deterministic system parameters belong to different ranges for diabetes and controls. Implications for clinical practice are discussed.

Mismatched data triggered 93 false alerts and failed to issue 170 alerts for nurses to notify physicians. Four of six BG variability measures differed between matched and mismatched data. Overall insulin dose was greater for matched than mismatched [matched 3. 8 (1. 6 - 6. 0), median (interquartile range, IQR), versus 3. 6 (1. 6 - 5. 7); p < 0. 001], but recalculated and actual dose were similar. In mismatches preceding hypoglycemia, recalculated insulin dose was significantly lower than actual dose [recalculated 2. 7 (0. 4 - 5. 0), median (IQR), versus 3. 5 (1. 4 - 5. 6) ]. In mismatches preceding hyperglycemia, recalculated insulin dose was significantly greater than actual dose [recalculated 4. 7 (3. 3 - 6. 2), median (IQR), versus 3. 3 (2. 4 - 4. 3); p < 0. 001]. Administration of recalculated doses might have prevented <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> <b>excursions.</b> Mismatched <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> values can influence CDSS IIT protocol performance...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{explore the}} {{characteristics}} of <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> <b>excursions</b> of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with three different Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) syndromes. MethodsOne hundred and nine patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were recruited from the Department of Endocrinology and the Department of TCM of the Sixth People's Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Subjects were divided into three groups according to TCM syndrome: intrinsic Damp (n = 42), Yin deficiency and internal Heat (n = 25), and Qi and Yin deficiency (n = 42). Subcutaneous interstitial glucose was monitored with a continuous glucose monitoring system for 3 consecutive days to investigate the glycemic profile in each group. Plasma C-peptide levels were measured, and an arginine test was taken in 10 patients randomly selected from each group. Glucose data and glycemic variability were analyzed to investigate the differences among the groups. The change in C-peptide levels and the results from arginine trial were used to evaluate β cell function. ResultsIndicators reflecting <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> level were the highest in subjects with Yin deficiency and internal Heat syndrome, and parameters reflecting glycemic variability were the lowest in those with Qi and Yin deficiency syndrome. The change in C-peptide levels showed that subjects with Qi and Yin deficiency syndrome had the best β cell function among the three groups; this was confirmed by the arginine trial. ConclusionPatients with Qi and Yin deficiency syndrome had a more stable <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> profile, as glycemic variability was higher in those with intrinsic Damp syndrome and those with Yin deficiency and internal Heat syndrome...|$|R
40|$|Attenuating <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> <b>excursions</b> in the {{postprandial}} {{state has}} the capacity {{to reduce the risk of}} cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and mortality, even in apparently healthy populations. Almost a century ago it was reported that oral glucose tolerance is improved by prior glucose consumption. This was termed the second-meal phenomenon and is also seen with consumption of mixed-macronutrient containing meals. In this context a number of mechanisms probably contribute to the attenuation of glycemia, including: gastric emptying, early-phase insulin secretion, hepatic glucose output and muscle glucose uptake. More recently, a paradoxical second-meal phenomenon has been observed in the immediate post-exercise period whereby prior meal consumption deteriorated glucose tolerance. The mechanisms regulating the post-exercise second-meal phenomenon are less clear, but are likely to involve an increase in intestinal absorption, greater hepatic glucose output, and under circumstances of muscle-damage, reductions in muscle glucose uptake. Further work is required to confirm these mediating factors and to characterize the time-course of this paradox, which is likely to only exist within the first 4 h following exercise. Critically, this acute post-exercise phenomenon should be maintained in the perspective of the benefits of chronic exercise training, which for the majority of individuals improves glycemic control and reduces many health risks including those associated with exaggerated postprandial glycemia...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} {{challenge to}} the food industry {{is to develop a}} wide range of low GI foods. This thesis investigated the influence of physicochemical structure on glycaemic response, focussing specifically on white bread, an important feature in the typical average human diet in the UK. The studies reported here showed reductions in the glycaemic response of white bread by reduction of bread volume and following different storage and preparation conditions (namely freezing, defrosting and toasting). These studies highlight the need to define and maintain storage conditions of food products in the determination of GI values of foods. Following the glycaemic response studies on white bread, this thesis investigated associations between cue-reactivity (externality), food cravings and 8 MI, as a reflection of overeating. In addition, the influence of <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> dynamics, specifically postprandial <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> decrements below fasting levels, on food craving and on 8 MI was also explored. Craving for high fat foods was an important intervening causal variable on a causal pathway between responsivity to environmental cues (extemafrty) and the deVelopment of obesity. Moreover, overeating was predicted by postprandial <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> decrements below fasting levels. An important interaction effect on 8 Ml was also demonstrated between postprandial <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> decrements and food cravings. To conclude, this thesis makes important contributions to the ongoing focus on the health implications of postprandial hyperglycaemic excursiOns, in relation to loaf volume or compactness of form of white bread {{and the way in which}} white bread is stored or prepared before consumption. Furthermore, this thesis raises the importance of focus on postprandial <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> undershooting below fasting levels as a parallel to <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> <b>excursions</b> of a hyperglycaemic nature. In addition, the findngs from these studies support food choice away from high-GI foods and raise the possibility of the use of low-GI foods as a functional food for individuals showing increased susceptibility to <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> decrements.

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} level of glycemic control by the {{measurement}} of 24 h <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> profiles and standard blood analyses under identical nutritional and physical activity conditions in type 2 diabetes patients and healthy, normoglycemic controls. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 11 male, type 2 diabetes patients and 11 healthy, matched controls participated in a 24 h continuous subcutaneous glucose monitoring (CGMS) assessment trial under strictly standardized dietary and physical activity conditions. In addition, fasting plasma glucose, insulin and HbA 1 c concentrations were measured, and an oral glucose tolerance test was performed to calculate indices of whole-body insulin sensitivity, oral glucose tolerance and/or glycemic control. RESULTS: In the healthy control group, hyperglycemia (<b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> concentration = 10 mmol/l) was hardly present (2 ± 1 % or 0. 4 ± 0. 2 / 24 h). However, in the type 2 diabetes patients hyperglycemia was experienced {{for as much as}} 55 ± 7 % of the time (13 ± 2 h / 24 h) while using the same standardized diet. Breakfast-related hyperglycemia contributed most (46 ± 7 %, ANOVA, P< 0. 01) to the total amount of hyperglycemia and postprandial glycemic instability. In the diabetes patients, blood HbA 1 c contents correlated well with the duration of hyperglycemia and the postprandial glucose responses (P< 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: CGMS measurements show that standard measures for glycemic control underestimate the amount of hyperglycemia prevalent during real-life conditions in type 2 diabetes. Given the macro- and microvascular damage caused by postprandial hyperglycemia, CGMS provides an excellent tool to evaluate alternative therapeutic strategies to reduce hyperglycemic <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> <b>excursions...</b>|$|R

A total of I I male patients with Type 11 diabetes and I I healthy matched controls participated in a 24 h CGMS (continuous subcutaneous glucose-monitoring system) assessment trial under strictly standardized dietary and physical activity conditions. In addition, fasting plasma glucose, insulin and HbA(1 c) (glycated haemoglobin) concentrations were measured, and an OGTT (oral glucose tolerance test) was performed to calculate indices of whole-body insulin sensitivity, oral glucose tolerance and/or glycaemic control. In the healthy control group, hyperglycaemia (<b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> concentration > 10 mmol/l) was hardly present (2 +/- 1 % or 0. 4 +/- 0. 2 / 24 h). However, in the patients with Type 11 diabetes, hyperglycaemia was experienced for as much as 55 +/- 7 % of the time (13 +/- 2 h over 24 h) while using the same standardized diet. Breakfast-related hyperglycaemia contributed most (46 +/- 7 %; P < 0. 01 as determined by ANOVA) to the total amount of hyperglycaemia and postprandial glycaemic instability. In the diabetes patients, blood HbA(1 c) content correlated well with the duration of hyperglycaemia and the postprandial glucose responses (P < 0. 05).

40|$|The incretins are a {{class of}} hormones {{released}} from the small bowel that act on the endocrine pancreas to potentiate insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. Due to the requirement for an elevated glucose concentration for activity, the incretins, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide- 1, have potential {{in the treatment of}} non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. A series of synthetic peptide GIP fragments was generated for the purpose of elucidating the bioactive domain of the molecule. Peptides were screened for stimulation of cyclic AMP (cAMP) accumulation in Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with the rat islet GIP receptor. Of the GIP fragments tested, GIP 1 ÿ 14 and GIP 19 ÿ 30 demonstrated the greatest cAMP-stimulating ability over the range of concentrations tested (up to 20 WM). In contrast, GIP fragments corresponding to amino acids 15 ^ 42, 15 ^ 30, 16 ^ 30 and 17 ^ 30 all demonstrated weak antagonism of GIP 1 ÿ 42 activity. Competitive-binding displacement studies indicated that these peptides were low-affinity ligands for the GIP receptor.

40|$|This study {{examined}} postprandial plasma insulin and glucose responses after co-ingestion of an insulinotropic protein (Pro) hydrolysate {{with and without}} additional free leucine with a single bolus of carbohydrate (Cho). Male patients with long-standing Type 2 diabetes (n = 10) and healthy controls (n = 10) participated in 3 trials in which plasma glucose, insulin, and amino acid responses were determined after the ingestion of beverages of different composition (Cho: 0. 7 g/kg carbohydrate, Cho+Pro: 0. 7 g/kg carbohydrate with 0. 3 g/kg protein hydrolysate, or Cho+Pro+Leu: 0. 7 g/kg carbohydrate, 0. 3 g/kg protein hydrolysate and 0. 1 g/kg free leucine). Plasma insulin responses [expressed as area under the curve (AUC) ] were 141 and 204 % greater in patients with Type 2 diabetes and 66 and 221 % greater in the controls in the Cho+Pro and Cho+Pro+Leu trials, respectively, compared {{with those in the}} Cho trial (P < 0. 05). The concomitant plasma glucose responses were 15 and 12 % lower in the patients with Type 2 diabetes and 92 and 97 % lower in the control group in the Cho+Pro and Cho+Pro+Leu trials, respectively, compared with those in the Cho trial (P < 0. 05). Plasma leucine concentrations correlated with the insulin response in all subjects (r = 0. 43, P < 0. 001). We conclude that co-ingestion of a protein hydrolysate with or without additional free leucine strongly augments the insulin response after ingestion of a single bolus of carbohydrate, thereby significantly reducing postprandial <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> <b>excursions</b> in patients with long-standing Type 2 diabetes. © 2006 American Society for Nutrition...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a diabetes simulator, an educational software tool which can help diabetic patients to better manage their disease, is described. Education of patients with diabetes mellitus is a fundamental part of diabetes care. One {{of the goals of}} diabetes education is to support the patients {{to understand the nature of}} their illness and its treatment. Diabetes patients should be aware of the impact of nutrition, physical activity and insulin injections on <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> <b>excursions.</b> They should be able to identify emerging health problems like severe hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia in early stages. This will enable them to adapt to and prevent these conditions. Personalised ICT services provide several possibilities to improve patient education and therefore diabetic care. In particular the {{development of}} an educational diabetes simulator is considered. Only one diabetes simulator, called AIDA, is currently available. AIDA is designed only for type- 1 diabetes patients (5 - 10 % of the whole diabetic population), and does not use patient-specific data. We are developing the Virtual Diabetic Patient Simulator (VDPS) for both type- 1 and type- 2 diabetes. The VDPS represents the key characteristics and behaviour of the main processes of glucose metabolism involved in diabetes for a period of one day (24 hours). Based on patient-specific information (parameters) and daily life situations the VDPS can be used to train the patient in a virtual environment with realistic scenarios. The core of the simulator is a computational model which calculates temporal glucose and insulin plasma profiles in response to known inputs (food, insulin, etc.). As a first step we have coupled and modified existing literature models. The current model can predict plasma glucose concentrations with acceptable accuracy for education purposes. In conclusion, the model provides a solid background for further developments of the diabetes simulator...|$|R
40|$|MMed, Paediatrics, University of the Witwatersrand, Faculty of Health SciencesBackground: To {{reduce the}} risks and prevent {{progression}} of diabetic complications average <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> and glucose variability need to be kept {{as close to the}} non diabetic range as possible. Post prandial <b>glucose</b> <b>excursions</b> contribute significantly to average <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> and to glycemic variability. Dietary carbohydrate is the primary determinant of meal related <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> <b>excursions.</b> Carbohydrate counting is a method of insulin dosing that matches carbohydrate load to insulin dose using a fixed ratio. Many patients and current insulin pumps, calculate insulin delivery for meals based upon a linear carbohydrate to insulin relationship. Hypothesis: A non-linear relationship exists between the amount of carbohydrate consumed and the insulin required to cover it. Rather, an exponential increase in insulin is needed to cover an increasing load of carbohydrate. Aim: To document <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> exposure, as measured by AUC, in response to increasing carbohydrate loads on fixed carbohydrate to insulin ratios. Sample and Methods: 5 Type- 1 diabetic adolescents and young adults on insulin pump therapy with good control were recruited. Morning basal rates and carbohydrate to insulin ratios were optimized prior to the study start. A Medtronic glucose sensor was worn by each participant for 5 days on which standardized meals of increasing carbohydrate content were consumed. After the 5 days the glucose sensors were downloaded and the glucose area under the curve was analyzed for each carbohydrate load for each participant. Results: Only subjects with 5 days of complete recordings covering the test meals were included for analysis, resulting in 5 complete analyses. Sensor failure and hypoglycaemic v episodes prior to test meals accounted for failures. Increasing carbohydrate loads on a fixed carbohydrate to insulin ratio resulted in increasing glucose area under the curve (AUC). The log (Average AUC) was linear confirming that this relationship is exponential. An Analysis of Covariance performed on the log (AUC) data confirmed a highly significant exponential relationship (p< 0. 0001) although {{no significant differences were found}} between the profiles of the 5 individuals. Late post prandial hypoglycaemia followed carbohydrate loads greater than 60 grams and this was often followed by rebound hyperglycaemia that lasted more than 6 hours. Conclusion: A non linear relationship exists between carbohydrates consumed and the insulin required to cover them when using premeal bolus insulin. This has implications for control of postprandial blood sugars, especially when consuming large carbohydrate loads. Because of the late post prandial hypoglycaemia that follows the larger doses of insulin used with larger amounts of carbohydrate it is not possible to simply increase the amount of the insulin bolus using an exponential formula. Further studies need to be done looking at the optimal ratios of insulin needed for increasing carbohydrate loads, the duration and type of boluses needed to cover these high carbohydrate loads and the possibility of changing the linear equation used in current insulin pumps to one that would better cover the increase in post prandial glucose load with large carbohydrate meals...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Glycemic {{instability}} is {{a severely}} underestimated problem in {{type 2 diabetes}} treatment. Therapeutic targets should aim to reduce postprandial <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> <b>excursions.</b> Exercise prescription can effectively improve glucose homeostasis and {{reduce the risk of}} cardiovascular complications. AIM: To assess the impact of a single, isoenergetic bout of low- (LI) and high-intensity (HI) exercise on the prevalence of hyperglycemia throughout the subsequent 24 -h postexercise period in longstanding type 2 diabetes patients. METHODS: Nine sedentary, male type 2 diabetes patients (age = 57 +/- 2 yr, body mass index = 29. 0 +/- 1. 0 kg x m(- 2), Wmax = 2. 2 +/- 0. 2 W x kg(- 1) body weight) were selected to participate in a randomized crossover study. Subjects performed an isoenergetic bout of endurance-type exercise for 60 min at 35 % Wmax (LI) or 30 min at 70 % Wmax (HI) or no exercise at all (NE). Thereafter, glycemic control was assessed during the subsequent 24 -h postexercise period by continuous glucose monitoring under strict dietary standardization but otherwise free-living conditions. RESULTS: Average 24 -h glucose concentrations were reduced after the LI exercise bout (7. 8 +/- 0. 9 mmol x L(- 1)) when compared with the control experiment (9. 4 +/- 0. 8 mmol x L(- 1); P < 0. 05). The HI exercise bout did not significantly lower mean glucose concentrations (8. 7 +/- 0. 7 mmol x L(- 1); P = 0. 14). Hyperglycemia was prevalent for as much as 35 % +/- 9 % throughout the day (NE). A single bout of exercise reduced the prevalence of hyperglycemia by 50 % +/- 4 % (P < 0. 05) and 19 % +/- 9 % (P = 0. 13) in the LI and HI exercise experiments, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A single bout of LI, as opposed to HI, exercise substantially reduces the prevalence of hyperglycemia throughout the subsequent 24 -h postexercise period in longstanding type 2 diabetes patients...|$|R
40|$|Background and aims: The insulin action {{profiles}} of subcutaneously injected short acting insulin analogues are still slow compared to physiologically released human insulin. Thus, postprandial <b>glucose</b> <b>excursions</b> cannot be avoided. InsuPad {{is a medical}} device designed to accelerate insulin delivery rate by applying local heat at the insulin injection site. Whenever an insulin injection is given, the skin surface temperature is heated up locally to 38. 5 C° for 30 minutes. This pilot-study examines {{the impact of the}} InsuPad use on postprandial <b>glucose</b> <b>excursions</b> after breakfast and dinner in daily life conditions. Materials and methods: Insulin resistant diabetic patients were instructed to use the InsuPad when injecting bolus insulin prior to breakfast and dinner for one month and to measure their <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> at least five times per day (pre- and post-breakfast, pre-lunch and pre- and post-dinner).
