40|$|Exposure to {{whole body}} {{vibration}} (WBV) {{is a major}} concern in mechanized forestry work because its adverse effects may become exacerbated by repetitive hand and arm movements, and nonneutral body postures. Moreover, shock-type vibrations have recently been suggested as a possible agent behind pains in the neck and shoulders of forest machine operators. Shocks have been identified in forwarders during loading, but the effects of crane work in forwarders have, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, not been studied. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess contributions of crane work elements, and potential effects of the use of three grapple and brake-link combinations, to vibration exposure levels in a small forwarder. Repeated measurements of cabin WBV were acquired, and work elements timed, as a single experienced operator forwarded wood piles on a standardized track in northern Sweden, using the same forwarder and work procedures with each grapple and brake-link combination. The studied crane equipment was found to have little or no effect on the daily WBV exposure. Furthermore, exposure to shock-type vibrations while loading appears to be due to driving rather than crane work. However, there were fewer collisions with remaining trees while using the tilt grapple with <b>brake</b> <b>link,</b> suggesting its use provides a more relaxed and comfortable work environment for forwarder operators and financial benefits for the forest owner by reducing damage in the remaining stand...|$|E
50|$|In the mid-1930s, Beech {{undertook}} a major redesign of the aircraft, {{to create the}} Model D17 Staggerwing. The D17 featured a lengthened fuselage that improved the aircraft's handling characteristics by increasing control leverage, and the ailerons were relocated to the upper wings, eliminating interference with the flaps. Braking was improved with a foot-operated <b>brake</b> <b>linked</b> to the rudder pedals.|$|R
5000|$|The 6/1 had 8 in {{drum brakes}} front and rear. The <b>brakes</b> were <b>linked,</b> and {{the rear wheel}} had a {{ratcheted}} [...] "parking brake".|$|R
5000|$|Revised <b>linked</b> <b>brakes</b> with altered {{proportioning}} between {{front and}} rear.|$|R
50|$|A brakeman's job was {{historically}} {{very dangerous}} with numerous reports of brakemen falling from trains, colliding with lineside structures or {{being run over}} or crushed by rolling stock. As rail transport technology has improved, a brakeman's duties have been reduced and altered to match the updated technology, and the brakeman's job has become much safer {{than it was in}} the early days of railroading. Individually operated car brakes were replaced by remotely-operated air brakes, eliminating the need for the brakeman to walk atop a moving train to set the <b>brakes.</b> <b>Link</b> and pin couplings were replaced with automatic couplings, and hand signals are now supplemented by two-way radio communication.|$|R
50|$|The bike {{was fitted}} with an 'anti-squat' rear <b>brake</b> linkage that <b>linked</b> the rear caliper {{to the frame}} via a rose-jointed linkage through the {{swingarm}} (reducing rear suspension displacement under braking).|$|R
5000|$|Optional {{antilock}} brakes (ABS) and {{traction control}} system (TCS). 1996 and later Models equipped with ABS also have front-rear <b>linked</b> <b>brakes</b> (LBS). ABS model years from 1992 through 1995 have traditional separate front and rear braking systems.|$|R
40|$|Electronic Travel Aids (ETAs) {{improve the}} {{mobility}} of visually-impaired persons, {{but it is not}} easy to develop an ETA satisfying all the factors needed for reliable object detection, effective notification, and actual usability. In this study, the authors developed an easy-to-use ETA having the function of reliable object detection and its successful feedback to the user by tactile stimulation. Seven ultrasonic sensors facing in different directions detect obstacles in the walking path, while vibrators in the tactile display stimulate the hand according to the distribution of obstacles. The detection of ground drop-offs activates the electromagnetic <b>brakes</b> <b>linked</b> to the rear wheels. To verify the feasibility of the developed ETA in the outdoor environment, walking tests by blind participants were performed, and the evaluation of safety to ground drop-offs was carried out. From the experiment, the feasibility of the developed ETA was shown to be sufficient if the sensor ranges for hanging obstacle detection is improved and learning time is provided for the ETA. Finally, the light-weight and low cost ETA designed and assembled based on the evaluation of the developed ETA is introduced to show the improvement of portability and usability, and is compared with the previously developed ETAs...|$|R
5000|$|The sixth {{generation}} VFR {{was introduced}} in 2002. It featured dual underseat exhausts, (rather like the Ducati 916), optional ABS, DCBS <b>linked</b> <b>brakes,</b> and optional hard luggage. It featured chain-driven cams rather than the gear-driven cams of earlier VFRs, and VTEC valve actuation.|$|R
50|$|The United States would supply: the engine; radiator; fan; piping; silencer; lighting; dynamo; battery; {{propeller}} shaft; transmission, including gearbox; brakes; roller sprockets; {{gear shift}} and <b>brake</b> control; track <b>links</b> and pins; rear track sprockets, hub and shafts; front idler hub and shafts; track roller, track spindles and bushings.|$|R
50|$|Both the Type 562 and Type 710 sidecars {{share the}} same chassis, with only the {{bodywork}} being different. Both feature either a 16 Inch or 18 Inch wheel with a 160mm. diameter single leading shoe drum <b>brake,</b> which is <b>linked,</b> when fitted to a Jawa motorcycle, to the rear brake mechanism to provide balanced braking.|$|R
50|$|ATTESA E-TS Pro {{differs from}} the {{standard}} ATTESA E-TS in a few ways. Where ATTESA E-TS controls the front to rear torque-split, the Pro system is also capable of left-and-right torque split to the rear wheels. This is done via an active rear LSD. Additionally, ATTESA E-TS Pro was marketed as controlling the ABS system to each wheel independently, while the previous ABS computer could sense the speed of each wheel its ABS pump is only 3-channel (both rear <b>brakes</b> are <b>linked</b> as a pair). Although this {{is not part of}} the AWD system, the computer makes use of the same sensors to determine wheel slip and traction.|$|R
5000|$|The VFR was {{originally}} a 750 cc, but became an 800 cc in due course. New models featured technological innovation, {{such as a}} single-sided swingarm, <b>linked</b> <b>braking,</b> ABS, and VTEC. The VFR1200 became the first motorcycle to feature a dual-clutch transmission. Not all of these [...] "innovations" [...] proved popular with riders, who often preferred the simple robustness of the earlier models.|$|R
50|$|The {{foot brake}} {{operates}} on the transmission and the lever brakes {{on the rear}} wheels. Both sets are of the internal expanding type. The adjustment for wear of the foot brake may be made by hand but adjustment of the rear brakes requires a spanner. Twelve months later front brakes were made available on new cars for a further £55. A year later again they were standardised on the 23-60 in July 1924 along with a redesigned front axle, springs and saddle-plate. Operated by the foot pedal the front brakes and the transmission <b>brake</b> were <b>linked,</b> the latter being given a slight lead. The brakes on the rear wheels were independently controlled by the handbrake lever.|$|R
5000|$|World first PCS Collision {{avoidance}} {{system with}} GPS-navigation <b>linked</b> <b>brake</b> assist function. The system, {{which is designed}} to determine if the driver is late in decelerating at an approaching stop sign, will then sound an alert and can also pre-charge the brakes to provide optimum braking force if deemed necessary. This system works in certain Japanese cities and requires Japan specific road markings that are detected by a CCD camera.|$|R
50|$|The Honda RC30 had a 'Pro Squat Rear <b>Brake</b> Linkage' that <b>linked</b> {{the rear}} caliper {{to the frame}} via a linkage through the swingarm, {{reducing}} rear wheel hop under braking. The NC30 had the swingarm machined to allow a torque arm shaft and featured the cast boss on the frame but the linkage was not fitted and the caliper was instead held in place with a simple torque reaction arm bolted into the swingarm.|$|R
50|$|The narrow {{angle of}} the {{cylinder}} bank's V allowed {{the use of a}} one piece head, a practice used by Lancia in its early V4 automobile engines. The rear suspension was a cantilever design using two springs and friction dampers beneath the saddle, very similar to the 1928 Vincent HRD design. <b>Linked</b> <b>brakes</b> were used, as had appeared on the 1925 Rudge Four. The carburettor was an Amal type 4/014 (bottom petrol feed).|$|R
5000|$|Predecessors of the British company {{included}} Evans O'Donnell Limited and Saxby and Farmer. Saxby and Farmer {{was started}} by John Saxby and John Stinson Farmer in the mid-19th century as pioneers {{in the manufacture of}} railway signalling equipment. In 1875 Saxby and Farmer had developed a mechanical <b>linked</b> <b>braking</b> system, which connected vehicles to brake simultaneously. [...] In 1920, Saxby, Farmer and Evans O'Donnell formed the Westinghouse Brake & Saxby Signal Company Ltd.|$|R
5000|$|The MarkII {{was similar}} to the MarkI, but the small 'bikini" [...] fairing became a larger half-fairing {{incorporating}} indicators. The fairing had been tested in Moto Guzzi's wind tunnel (which had been used to test race bike fairings in the 1950s). The new fairing had a rectangular headlight, rather than the earlier round item. Cylinder bores were coated with Moto Guzzi's patented [...] "Nikasil". Front suspension became air-assisted. The brake calipers on the front wheel, previously mounted on the front, were now mounted behind the forks. A new dualseat could now carry a pillion. Further changes included a revised instrument cluster derived from the 1000cc SP. <b>Brakes</b> were <b>linked,</b> with the handlebar lever operating the front right caliper and the footbrake operating both the front left and rear caliper.|$|R
5000|$|A brake {{proportioning}} valve was fitted to all 4 and 6 cylinder Centuras from factory to compensate for weight transfer during braking [...] When the car [...] "nose-dived" [...] under heavy <b>braking,</b> a mechanical <b>link</b> connected to the {{proportioning valve}} reduced the brake pressure on the rear wheels, {{to prevent them from}} locking up and causing {{the back of the car}} to slide around. This was typical of many European cars of the time but uncommon in Australian cars.|$|R
5000|$|A {{combined}} {{braking system}} (CBS), also called <b>linked</b> <b>braking</b> system (LBS), is a system for linking front and rear brakes on a motorcycle or scooter. [...] In this system, the rider's action of depressing one of the brake levers applies both front and rear brakes. The amount of each brake applied may be determined by a proportional control valve.This is distinct from integrated brakes, where applying pressure to brake pedal only includes application of some front brake.|$|R
50|$|Honda's ABS and <b>linked</b> <b>brake</b> {{package is}} an option for all years on the ST1300 in the United States, but became {{standard}} on the European ST1300 Pan European 2004 (A4 models). Unlike the ST1100, the ST1300 does not include a traction control system. In 2002 and 2003, models with ABS included an electrically adjustable windscreen. The electrically adjustable windscreen became standard equipment on all bikes in 2004. A long list of minor differences improved upon the ST1100's comfort, handling and performance.|$|R

50|$|A 2-6-2T steam locomotive, {{the design}} of Russell is {{more closely related to}} Hunslet No 865 of 1905 {{otherwise}} known as Leeds Number 1, although certain engineering aspects can be more readily associated with design of locomotives supplied to the Sierra Leone Government Railway. One of the driving wheel centres bears the initials SLR, however this has been found to have been a later replacement and not as originally supplied. Originally built with air train brakes, it was converted to vacuum train <b>brakes</b> following the <b>linking</b> of the Welsh Highland and Ffestiniog Railways.|$|R
5000|$|The 748 cc Mk.I VFR750 was {{introduced}} in 1985, and was over-engineered {{in a bid to}} re-establish a reputation for reliability. It had an alloy beam frame, gear driven cams. The Mk.IA changed wheel sizes from 16" [...] front & 18" [...] rear to 17" [...] front and rear, and the fairing was slightly modified. After this was a series of VFR750 models which featured various innovations, including a single-sided swingarm, <b>linked</b> <b>braking,</b> ABS, and VTEC. In due course the geared cam drive was dropped in favour of cheaper chain-drive.|$|R
5000|$|With minor {{modifications}} in 2004, the design remained largely unchanged until its relaunch as the NT700V in 2006. The third generation Deauville featured programmed fuel-injection system, digital transistorized ignition with electronic advance, power delivery via shaft drive, five-speed gearbox, cable-actuated clutch, center and side stands, standard riding posture, 58.1" [...] wheelbase, 31.7" [...] seat height, 5.2-gallon fuel tank, three-spoke 17" [...] alloy wheels, 562-lb curb weight, <b>linked</b> <b>braking</b> system with optional ABS, manually adjustable five-position integral windscreen and integral fairing, twin trip odometers, instant and average MPG readouts and twin dash-mounted storage compartments (one lockable).|$|R
50|$|The VFR800 has a novel DCBS <b>linked</b> <b>braking</b> system. This {{system is}} a {{departure}} from traditional motorcycle braking system where front and rear braking are independent of each other. In this system, the front brake lever applies pressure to four (or later, five) of the six front brake caliper pistons. The rotational movement of the left caliper when engaged actuates a secondary master cylinder and applies pressure {{to one of the}} rear caliper's pistons. The rear brake pedal is directly attached to the remaining pistons (two in the rear, and one (or two) in the front).|$|R
