5|$|Comets can loosely {{be divided}} into two categories: short-period and long-period—the latter being thought to {{originate}} in the Oort cloud. The two major categories of short-period comets are Jupiter-family comets (JFCs) and Halley-type comets. Halley-type comets, which are named after their prototype, Halley's Comet, are thought to have originated in the Oort cloud <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been drawn into the inner Solar System by the gravity of the giant planets, whereas the JFCs are thought to have originated in the scattered disc. The centaurs are thought to be a dynamically intermediate stage between the scattered disc and the Jupiter family.|$|E

5|$|Sometime between 1888 and 1890, McKinley {{decided to}} run for president, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a {{realistic}} chance of attaining that goal, he needed to regain office. Foraker's ambition then was the Senate—he planned to challenge Sherman in the legislative election to be held in January 1892—and he agreed to nominate McKinley for governor at the state convention in Columbus. McKinley was elected, and Sherman narrowly turned back Foraker's challenge with considerable help from Hanna.|$|E
5|$|The {{walls of}} the church were {{completely}} restored in 2003. At {{the same time the}} altar was moved closer to the congregation, making more room for the choir. The baptismal font was relocated from the chapel to the front, opposite the ambo. The tabernacle, which had been where the baptismal font is now, and the crucifixion scene were moved to the chapel, creating a chapel for adoration. The restoration works were directed by Franz Josef Hamm from Limburg. The new cross above the altar was created by a group of young people in preparation for confirmation. During the restoration the organ had to be taken apart. The parish decided not to restore it, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a new organ built.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{movement}} originally began {{in order to}} oppose the increasing burden of debt carried by Romania's peasants during the Great Depression and because the National Peasants' Party's couldn't help the poorest peasants, by 1944 the organization was essentially under Communist control. The Communist Party wished to seize power but {{was too weak to}} seize it alone—in 1944 it had only about a thousand members. Accordingly, the Romanian communist leaders had no choice <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the party join a broad coalition of political organizations.|$|E

Also that year, having lectured for a while at Sabin Manuilă's School of Social Work, Herseni was appointed by Gusti's {{an assistant professor in the}} University of Bucharest department of sociology, ethics and politics. Stahl claims to have been Gusti's first choice, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> declined the position in order to suit Herseni, who, as a married man, needed a steady flow of income.

25|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of war in August 1914, Seely was recalled to active duty as a special-service officer. Seely served for near {{the entirety of the}} First World War, with few breaks, leaving London on 11 August 1914 to take up a post on Sir John French’s staff. On a liaison mission between the French Fifth Army and Haig's I Corps (31 August 1914 – during the period when Sir John French's retreat had opened up a gap in the Allied line), he claimed to have been almost captured in the fog, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> bluffed his way past a German cavalry patrol by calling out (in German) that {{he was a member of}} the Great General Staff.|$|E

Prime Minister H.H. Asquith ordered the Navy to fall in with the Army’s plans to deploy an Expeditionary Force to France.|$|E

25|$|In ancient Greek {{religion}} {{a number}} {{of men and women}} were made physically immortal as they were resurrected from the dead. Asclepius was killed by Zeus, only to be resurrected and transformed into a major deity. Achilles, after being killed, was snatched from his funeral pyre by his divine mother Thetis and resurrected, brought to an immortal existence in either Leuce, Elysian plains or the Islands of the Blessed. Memnon, who was killed by Achilles, seems to have received a similar fate. Alcmene, Castor, Heracles, and Melicertes, were also among the figures sometimes considered to have been resurrected to physical immortality. According to Herodotus's Histories, the seventh century BC sage Aristeas of Proconnesus was first found dead, after which his body disappeared from a locked room. Later he found not only to have been resurrected <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> gained immortality.|$|E
25|$|If the bowler bowls {{without some}} part of the front foot landing either {{grounded}} or in the air behind the popping crease. If the front foot of a bowler lands behind the crease and slides beyond, then it is not a No ball. If the foot lands outside the crease, it is a No ball. It is legal for a spin bowler, for example, to land with his toe spikes grounded wholly in front of the crease <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> his heel in the air behind that line. The bowler must satisfy the umpire that {{some part of}} the foot lands initially behind -or on- the line, and in big games this question is now subject to minute examination by television replay. Recent practice has been to allow the bowler the benefit of any residual doubt in this judgement.|$|E
25|$|When Vangelis {{was twelve}} years he became {{interested}} in jazz music, and with the social movement to rock and roll. At fifteen years old he started to form early school bands, not to cover other musicians, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> fun, resulting in the early 1960s {{being one of the}} founders of pop rock group The Forminx (or the Formynx), which became popular in Greece. Based in Athens, the five-piece band played a mixture of cover versions and their own material, the latter written mostly by Vangelis (with lyrics by DJ and record producer Nico Mastorakis) but still sung in English. The Forminx released nine hit singles and a Christmas EP before disbanding in 1966 at the peak of their success. A film being made about them at the time, which was initially directed by Theo Angelopoulos, was never fully completed, and the songs, composed for the movie, were never released. Vangelis spent the next two years mostly studio-bound, writing and producing for other Greek artists.|$|E
