In 1952, Jack Northrop, broken by the cancellation of the B-35 and B-49 projects, gave up running his company to return to pure engineering, and made Echols president and general manager. Under the direction of Echols, Northrop's work force increased from 8,000 to 24,000 employees, and the company's <b>backlog</b> <b>of</b> <b>orders</b> advanced from $70 million to $557 million {{at the time of his}} sudden death on May 15, 1954.|$|E
25|$|In late 2006, the German Army, {{the first}} {{customer}} to receive production aircraft, accepted delivery {{of its first}} NH90 TTH. In April 2010, the Royal Netherlands Navy was the first customer to receive the navalised NH90 NFH variant. In June 2014, the consortium announced that they had completed delivery of the 200th NH90; at that point, the <b>backlog</b> <b>of</b> <b>orders</b> was reported as reaching out to 2020. In order to alleviate delays and reduce the complexity of manufacturing {{a large number of}} NH90 variants, NH Industries proposed the adoption of a simplified baseline airframe which could be configured to the individual customer's requirements. Between 2004 and 2016, the production lead times for the NH90 had reduced from 18 months to 7.5 months.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 1890s, many British {{builders}} were recovering from an engineers' strike over working hours, leaving <b>backlogs</b> <b>of</b> <b>orders</b> {{yet to be}} fulfilled. This prompted British railways that were in immediate need for additional motive power to turn to Baldwin and other US builders. Examples of engines built in response include the 2501 class of 2-6-0's built for the Midland Railway and the Lyn, a 2-4-2T(tank locomotive) for the 1 ft gauge Lynton and Barnstaple Railway in England in 1898. The Cape Government Railways of South Africa also bought engines from Baldwin {{as a result of}} the strikes. Unfortunately, many of these engines were unpopular with the crews due to their designs being atypical, and many, including all Midland Railway 2501's and the Lynton and Barnstaple's Lyn, were scrapped when no longer needed. A replica of the latter locomotive is currently under construction for the revived Lynton & Barnstaple Railway.|$|R
50|$|Lyn was a 2-4-2 tank steam {{locomotive}} {{built by the}} Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1898 for the Lynton and Barnstaple Railway. Between July 1897 and January 1898, employees of many British engineering companies were striking {{in an attempt to}} win the right to an eight-hour working day, leaving locomotive builders with large <b>backlogs</b> <b>of</b> unfulfilled <b>orders.</b> Thus, the Lynton and Barnstaple instead consulted the US based Baldwin to produce the engine they needed. After construction in Philadelphia, the loco was disassembled, shipped to Barnstaple, and reassembled by L&B staff in their Pilton workshops.|$|R
25|$|After {{taking the}} {{aircraft}} {{to a number}} of fly-ins and other aviation events, Murphy was encouraged by the large number of people who wanted him to build one for them. In 1985 he quit his job and started Murphy Aviation (later renamed Murphy Aircraft Manufacturing), with his brother Bryan and located the company in Chilliwack, British Columbia. The original Renegade design was turned into a two-seater by relocating the fuel tank from the centre fuselage to the upper wing, installing a second seat and designating it Renegade II. Initial sales were disappointing as only one kit was sold in the first six months. Sales improved greatly once the aviation press began reviewing the aircraft. By 1986 the company had a <b>backlog</b> <b>of</b> <b>orders,</b> including many from outside North America. Murphy displayed the Renegade at the EAA Convention, Oshkosh and returned to Chilliwack with a substantial order book. During 1989 sales totalled 129 Renegade IIs.|$|E
500|$|In 1926, Williams {{mandated}} {{the use of}} {{parachutes for}} all RAAF aircrew. He had visited the Irvin Air Chute Company while in the US during 1924 and recommended purchase at the time, but a <b>backlog</b> <b>of</b> <b>orders</b> for the RAF meant that the Australian equipment took almost two years to arrive. Flying Officer Ellis Wackett was assigned to instruct volunteers at RAAF Richmond, and made the country's first freefall descent from a military aircraft, an Airco DH.9, on 26May. Williams himself jumped over Point Cook on 5August, having decided that it would set [...] "a good example if, before issuing an order for the compulsory wearing of parachutes, I showed my own confidence in them..." [...] Though his descent took him perilously close to the base water tank ("I {{thought it would be}} a poor ending to drown there, or even to be pulled out dripping wet") and [...] "too close to be comfortable to a 30,000 volt electric transmission line", he completed the exercise unscathed.|$|E
500|$|The L {{used only}} {{coal-fired}} steam motive power. In 1896, the Hunslet Engine Company submitted two designs (a 2-4-2T and a 4-4-0T), but eventually an order was placed for three 2-6-2Ts from Manning Wardle & Co of Leeds. The locos were named after local rivers: Yeo, Exe, and Taw. These were supplemented by a 2-4-2T, Lyn, {{built by the}} Baldwin Locomotive Works of Philadelphia, USA, as the Company realised that three locos would be insufficient. Baldwin was selected as they could deliver the loco [...] based largely on standard components [...] more quickly than domestic suppliers, [...] who had a <b>backlog</b> <b>of</b> <b>orders,</b> caused by a national engineering dispute over the 8hour working day resulting in a lock-out by employers from July 1897 and January 1898. After construction by Baldwin, the loco was shipped across the Atlantic in parts, and re-assembled at Pilton by railway staff. It first steamed in July 1898. The Manning Wardles were delivered ahead of the lock-out, and Yeo and Taw {{were used in the}} final stages of construction. Exe was stored locally in a stable, where she received the unwelcome attention of thieves who stole various brass fittings and fixtures.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{second to}} the 747 as Boeing's most {{profitable}} jetliner, the 777 became the company's most lucrative model in the 2000s. Program sales accounted for an estimated US$400million of Boeing's pretax earnings in 2000, US$50million more than the 747. By 2004, the airliner comprised the bulk of wide-body revenues for the Boeing Commercial Airplanes division. In 2007, orders for second-generation 777 models approached 350 aircraft, and in November of that year, Boeing announced that all production slots were sold out to 2012. The program <b>backlog</b> <b>of</b> 356 <b>orders</b> was valued at US$95billion at list prices in 2008.|$|R
50|$|The Midland Railway 2501 and 2511 Class {{were two}} classes of American-built 2-6-0 steam locomotives. The Midland's own Derby Works had reached their capacity, and were unable to produce {{additional}} engines at the time, and many British locomotive builders were recovering from an 1897-1898 strike over the eight-hour working day, and thus had large <b>backlogs</b> <b>of</b> unfulfilled <b>orders,</b> so the Midland Railway turned to American builders. Thirty 2501 class locomotives were built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1899, followed by ten 2511 class engines built by the Schenectady Locomotive Works later that same year. Both classes {{were built in the}} United States as kits, shipped to Derby, and assembled.|$|R
50|$|The Imperial Japanese Navy <b>ordered</b> a pair <b>of</b> s {{from the}} British Yarrow Shipbuilders in 1913, and Kawakaze (as {{the ship was}} {{originally}} named) was laid down on 1 October 1913 at their Scotstoun shipyard. Construction was delayed by a <b>backlog</b> <b>of</b> previous <b>orders</b> {{and then by the}} outbreak of World War I in August 1914. The Italians, desperately short of destroyers, began negotiations with the Japanese to acquire Kawakaze and succeeded on 3 July 1916 when they agreed to transfer the ship. The Regia Marina named their new acquisition Intrepido two days later, but renamed her Audace on 25 September. She was launched on 27 September and completed on 1 March 1917.|$|R

2500|$|During World War I, Colt surpassed all {{previous}} production achievements. John Browning worked for Colt for a time, {{and came up}} with a design for a semiautomatic pistol, which debuted as the Colt M1900 pistol and eventually evolved into the M1911. Prior to America's entry into the war, orders from Canada and the United Kingdom swelled the <b>backlog</b> <b>of</b> <b>orders</b> to three years. Colt hired 4,000 more workers, making a total of 10,000 employees—and its stock's price increased by 400%. By 1918, Colt had produced and sold 425,500 of the famous Browning-designed M1911. Because the factory could not keep up with demand for this pistol, the US Military decided to accept Colt New Service revolvers in caliber [...]45 ACP, called the M1917 revolver, as a substitute weapon. Competing manufacturer Smith & Wesson made double-action revolvers in [...]45 ACP, which were accepted and issued by the U.S. military under the same name. Colt produced 151,700 revolvers during the war as well as 13,000 Maxim-Vickers machine guns and 10,000 Browning machine guns with an additional 100,000 under subcontract to other companies.|$|E
2500|$|However, car {{manufacturers}} {{of the time}} were unwilling to undertake such an experimental proposition. Steel was deemed too heavy for any practical applications. Conventional wisdom of the day (since proven to be false) held that an all steel car would vibrate itself to pieces, claiming wood was [...] "necessary" [...] for its damping effects on the car's vibration. It was also widely believed that a steel car would be very loud, and poorly insulated from temperature extremes such as heat and cold. With a large <b>backlog</b> <b>of</b> <b>orders</b> for wooden cars, manufacturers had no incentive to explore the new technology as there was still plenty of demand for wooden railcars. The IRT knew that the October 27, 1904 opening of the new subway route was fast approaching, and that rolling stock had to be designed and built soon or the line would not be ready. With time running short to order rolling stock, a wood-based alternative had been proposed – a protected wooden car {{to be known as}} a Composite.|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} I develop {{a model of}} an {{infinitely}} repeated procurement auction with one buyer and several sellers. The buyer can accumulate a <b>backlog</b> <b>of</b> unfilled <b>orders</b> which, similar to a boom in demand, forces the sellers t o collude on a low price to prevent undercutting. If the buyer's cost of shifting its consumption over time is low enough, then the extent of collusion is bounded away from the joint-profit-maximizing level even for discount factors approaching one. The model is extended to allow for multiple buyers. Large buyers are shown to obtain lower prices from the sellers. Buyer mergers increase profit for all buyers, not just the merging pair, {{at the expense of}} the sellers. In contrast, buyer growth through addition harms buyers that do not grow and benefits sellers. ...|$|R

A long strike by workers throughout the British engineering industry in 1898/1899 had led to a <b>backlog</b> <b>of</b> locomotive <b>orders,</b> leading British companies to place orders with American builders for standard light general-purpose locomotives adapted to British requirements - in the USA the 2-6-0 was already the common design {{for this sort of}} engine and these imports were to be very influential in introducing the wheel arrangement to the UK.|$|R
40|$|Research on the {{planning}} and control of combined make-to-order/make-to-stock or hybrid production systems often takes a typical MTO or MTS perspective. We examine {{the benefits of a}} hybrid planning approach without priority for either MTO or MTS. We develop a Markov Decision Process model for a two-product hybrid system to determine when to manufacture MTS and MTO products. Contrary to earlier studies with this approach, this study includes a positive lead time for MTO products. We characterize optimal policies and show how decisions should be based on both inventory level and <b>backlog</b> state <b>of</b> MTO products. Especially discriminating between states with and states without <b>backlog</b> <b>of</b> MTO <b>orders</b> is shown to be important in determining whether to increase MTS stock. Savings of up to 65 percent are achieved compared to policies that prioritize MTS or MTO. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.
