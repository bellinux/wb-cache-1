We {{looked for}} population substructure among typical open-coastal and atypical estuarine habitats in seven asexual populations of P. umbilicalis from Maine to New Hampshire using eight expressed sequence tag-simple sequence repeats (EST-SSR) or microsatellite loci. Six genotypes were identified, four {{of which may}} represent recombinant genotypes from a recombination event that took place locally, or that took place prior to introduction to the Northwest Atlantic. Genotypic diversity was lowest in a population from Wiscasset, Maine, which inhabits an atypical habitat high in the intertidal zone of a <b>bridge</b> <b>piling</b> in an estuarine tidal rapid. Genotypic diversity was highest in the southernmost populations from New Hampshire; we identified two genotypes that were unique to the southernmost populations, and probably represent the most derived genotypes. We looked at genetic distances among populations in similar habitats, and found that populations were {{more closely related to}} their closest neighboring population than to a population in a similar habitat. We show that genotypic diversity within P. umbilicalis populations in the Gulf of Maine is relatively high and thus fits a model of high steady-state variation within asexual populations...|$|E
40|$|The loading {{response}} {{of a single}} vertical pile was calibrated against strain gage load-history data acquired at a highway bridge abutment located on Steele County Highway 7 in Owatonna, MN. At this site, H-type piles were driven to a weathered bedrock layer and soil surcharging was used to reduce the anticipated settlement of a 15 m (50 ft) thick layer of clayey sand overburden. Evaluating the load in the <b>bridge</b> <b>piling</b> for this case study and subsequent sensitivity modelling provides a comprehensive case study for use as background to the Minnesota Department of Transportation's revised dragload design guidance.

The simulation approximated the construction sequence of backfilling by applying a layer-by-layer backfilling approach and approximated structural loading by applying a direct axial force {{to the top of the}} pile.

Monte Carlo simulation method (MCS) is adopted to determine the probabilities of failure by comparing the responses with defined limit states. The analysis considers the soil structure interaction together with the probabilistic application of the capacity spectrum method for different types of limit states. A cast-in-drilled-hole (CIDH) extended reinforced concrete pile shaft of a bridge is analysed using the proposed strategy.

40|$|This report {{investigates the}} {{importance}} of bending-buckling interaction in seismic design of piles in liquefiable soils. Recent studies have identified a possible mechanism of failure of piles in liquefiable soils; i. e., piles designed for bending and buckling separately may fail due to their combined effect. Fifteen cases of pile performance in past earthquakes have been assessed. In most of these cases bending-buckling interaction {{appears to be the}} cause of pile failure. One of the well documented case histories, i. e., the Showa <b>bridge</b> <b>pile</b> failure in 1964 Niigata earthquake, has been analyzed in detail. A pseudo-static analysis has been performed where the pile is modelled as a Beam on Nonlinear Winkler Foundation (BNWF). Six possible methods of analysis for piles subjected to lateral and axial loads are investigated, three force based and three displacement based. Three out of six analysis cases could not predict the failure of the piles subjected to only bending (i. e., Lateral loads only). Also, the buckling analysis showed that the Showa <b>bridge</b> <b>pile</b> was safe against Euler buckling. Two out of three cases those could not predict failure were reanalyzed for combined bending and buckling (i. e., Lateral and axial loads acting simultaneously). This bending-bucklin...|$|R

40|$|UnrestrictedThe {{earthquake}} {{response of}} various types of pile foundations supporting a variety of bridge structures to liquefaction induced lateral spread displacement demands is analyzed using the concepts of pile ductility and pile pinning. The soil/pile model uses the stress-strain response of reinforced concrete and steel, incorporating both the axial and lateral loads for structural elements, and p-y curves to represent interface elements to assess the pile response during earthquake induced lateral spread displacement demands.; The analysis approach is incorporated in an improved design methodology using concepts documented in the FHWA "Recommended LRFD Guidelines for the Seismic Design of Highway Bridges (2003) ".; Case studies of earthquake events, during which lateral spread displacement has caused damage to the <b>bridge</b> <b>pile</b> foundations are revisited to examine the response of these piles using the methodology developed in the research.; Design examples of several bridges supported by various types of pile foundations are also presented and the pile response in terms of plastic hinge development, pile ductility ratio and pile curvature response are studied. It is shown using the methodology developed in this research that given the subsurface conditions, the liquefaction and lateral spread potential and the structural details of the piles at a given bridge site, one can reasonably assess how close the pile is to acceptable ductility levels in plastic hinge zones. The method also provides a robust approach to screen for the acceptability of existing <b>bridge</b> <b>pile</b> foundations subject to lateral spread during present day design earthquakes...|$|R
