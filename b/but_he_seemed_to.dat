5|$|In March and April 1706, George {{was seriously}} ill. There was {{blood in his}} sputum, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> recover, {{although}} he was too ill to attend a thanksgiving service at St Paul's Cathedral in June for a British victory in the Battle of Ramillies. He missed another thanksgiving service in May 1707, to celebrate the union of England and Scotland, as he was recuperating at Hampton Court.|$|E
25|$|On {{the same}} day, Brigadier General David Hunter gave verbal orders to Lieutenant Charles Henry Tompkins of the 2nd U.S. Cavalry Regiment to gather {{information}} about the numbers and location of Confederate forces in the area. Hunter's instructions about entering Fairfax Court House were vague <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> encourage a probe into town to discover more information. At about 10:30p.m. {{on the night of}} May 31, 1861, Tompkins led a Union force of between 50 and 86 regular army cavalrymen, dragoons and a few volunteers from Camp Union at Falls Church, Virginia, on the ordered reconnaissance mission in the direction of Fairfax Court House.|$|E
25|$|Hopkins studied {{classics}} at Balliol College, Oxford (1863–67). He {{began his}} time in Oxford as a keen socialite and prolific poet, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> have alarmed himself with the changes in his behaviour that resulted. At Oxford he forged a lifelong friendship with Robert Bridges (eventual Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom), which would be of importance in his development as a poet and in establishing his posthumous acclaim. Hopkins was deeply impressed {{with the work of}} Christina Rossetti and she became one of his greatest contemporary influences, meeting him in 1864. During this time he studied with the eminent writer and critic Walter Pater, who tutored him in 1866 and who remained a friend until Hopkins left Oxford in September 1879.|$|E

25|$|It {{is certain}} that John Paul I would not have {{reversed}} Paul VI's teaching, namely on contraception, {{since it was a}} question of sexual ethics and Church doctrine, rather than one of personal opinion. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to assume that John Paul I would not have insisted upon the negative judgment in Humanae vitae as aggressively and publicly as John Paul II did. Luciani had mixed feelings in regards to the traditional stance on contraception. In 1968, as Bishop of Vittorio Veneto, he submitted a report to his predecessor as the Patriarch of Venice, Giovanni Urbani, that argued that the contraceptive pill should be permitted. It was agreed on by fellow Veneto bishops and was later submitted to Pope Paul VI. When Humanae vitae was released, Luciani defended that document. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> contradict that defence in a letter he wrote to his diocese four days after the release of the encyclical. In May 1978, Cardinal Luciani was invited to speak at a Milanese conference to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the encyclical. He refused to speak at the event or even attend it.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the next}} few months {{interest}} in the search waned, but Hindley's clue had directed the police to focus their efforts on a specific area. On the afternoon of 1 July 1987, after more than 100days of searching, they found a body buried [...] below the surface, only [...] from the place where Lesley Ann Downey had been found. Brady had been co-operating with the police for some time, and when news reached him that Reade's body had been discovered he made a formal confession to Topping. He also issued a statement to the press, through his solicitor, saying that he too was prepared to help the police in their search. Brady was taken to the moor on 3 July, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> lose his bearings, blaming changes that had taken place in the intervening years, and the search was called off at 3:00 pm, by which time a large crowd of press and television reporters had gathered on the moor.|$|E
2500|$|Bryant {{went into}} the café and {{purchased}} a meal, which he ate on the deck outside. He attempted to start conversations with people {{about the lack of}} [...] "wasps" [...] in the area and there not being as many Japanese tourists as usual, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be mainly mumbling to himself. He appeared nervous and continually looked back to the car-park and into the café.|$|E
6000|$|... "For {{months he}} is not heard of. Then there is {{slaughter}} among the young lambs. A child going to school, or an old woman carrying home a faggot from the forest is found torn and partly devoured, and the news spreads that the demon wolf {{has returned to the}} neighbourhood. Great hunts have over and over again been got up specially <b>to</b> slay him, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> lead a charmed life. He has been shot at over and over again, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be bullet-proof.|$|R

2500|$|He {{visited the}} {{hospitals}} to comfort the wounded and sick <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> have lost both {{some of his}} liberal tastes and his confidence in the Romans, who had turned against him in 1848. Pius decided to move his residence from the Quirinal Palace inside Rome to the Vatican, where popes have lived ever since. He reformed the governmental structure of the Papal States on 10 September 1850 and its finances on 28 October in the same year.|$|E
2500|$|Michigan scored four {{additional}} {{touchdowns in}} the second half. [...] Reimenschneider fumbled the opening kickoff to start the second half, and Michigan recovered the ball at Case's 20-yard line. [...] After the turnover, Michigan quarterback Harry Workman ran for a touchdown. [...] Michigan's third touchdown {{was set up by}} a poor punt by Case from behind its own goal line. [...] A penalty was tacked on, and Michigan got the ball at the Case 10-yard line. [...] Workman again ran for the touchdown. [...] Clarence Schenk scored Michigan's fourth touchdown on a [...] "cross buck" [...] from the five-yard line. [...] The final touchdown was scored by Arthur [...] "Waukegan" [...] Wright, a substitute right tackle who was described as [...] "the 'pompadour' haired medic from Illinois," [...] on a 35-yard run following an on-side kick. [...] A rule change enacted in 1906 allowed the punting team to recover a punt as a live ball. [...] The Detroit Free Press described Wright's touchdown as follows:"Garrels made an on-side punt to the Case thirty-five yard line. [...] Wright brought the ball to his breast after the bound as if it was his long-lost child, and was saving it from the kidnappers. [...] Three Case men tried to stop him as he was making the run for his fireside home, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> have a through ticket without a [...] punch, and scored the first touchdown of the year on the new rules." ...|$|E
