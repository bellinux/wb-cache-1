Under the leadership of Juan Antonio Samaranch the Games began to shift toward international sponsors who sought to link their products to the Olympic brand.|$|E

5|$|The use of crests {{was once}} {{restricted}} {{to those of}} 'tournament rank', i.e. knights and above, but in modern times nearly all personal arms include crests. They are not generally used by women (with the exception of reigning queens) and clergymen, as they {{did not participate in}} war or tournaments and thus would not have helms on which to wear them. Some heraldists are also of the opinion that crests, as personal devices, are not suited for use <b>by</b> <b>corporate</b> bodies, but this is not widely observed.|$|E

5|$|Where ambitious {{construction}} for the 1976 {{games in}} Montreal and 1980 games in Moscow had saddled organisers with expenses greatly {{in excess of}} revenues, Los Angeles strictly controlled expenses by using existing facilities except a swim stadium and a velodrome that were paid for <b>by</b> <b>corporate</b> sponsors. The Olympic Committee led by Peter Ueberroth used some of the profits to endow the LA84 Foundation to promote youth sports in Southern California, educate coaches and maintain a sports library. The 1984 Summer Olympics are often considered the most financially successful modern Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Avery Brundage, as {{president}} of the IOC from 1952 to 1972, rejected all attempts to link the Olympics with commercial interests as he felt that the Olympic movement should be completely separate from financial influence. The 1960 Winter Olympics marked the beginning of corporate sponsorship of the Games. Despite Brundage's strenuous resistance the commercialisation of the Games continued during the 1960s, and revenue generated <b>by</b> <b>corporate</b> sponsorship swelled the IOC's coffers. By the Grenoble Games, Brundage had become so concerned about the direction of the Winter Olympic Games towards commercialisation that, if it could not be corrected, he felt the Winter Olympics should be abolished. Brundage's resistance to this revenue stream meant that the IOC was unable to gain a share of the financial windfall that was coming to host cities, and had no control over the structuring of sponsorship deals. When Brundage retired the IOC had $2million in assets; eight years later its accounts had swelled to $45million. This was due to a shift in ideology among IOC members, towards expansion of the Games through corporate sponsorship and the sale of television rights.|$|E
5|$|Concourse D was {{constructed}} as a ground level commuter terminal for American Eagle with 15 ground level commuter aircraft parking spots and gate facilities.

For {{a short period of}} time, Concourse D was used <b>by</b> <b>Corporate</b> Airlines to operate its own regional flights until it became a regional affiliate with American Connection and Continental Connection, at which point the concourse was closed by the MNAA. Currently, plans exist to expand Concourse D with additional gates to increase capacity and attract new airlines, as well as provide new retail and dining offerings.|$|E

5|$|During {{his playing}} career, Martin greatly {{influenced}} {{the evolution of}} the sport of curling into a competitive sport. He was an instrumental part of the group that brought about the Grand Slam of Curling. In the early 2000s, he became the spokesperson for the promotion of the financial growth of curling, represented largely by the World Curling Tour, which was growing in popularity due to the benefits afforded <b>by</b> <b>corporate</b> sponsorship opportunities and cash prizes at tournaments. The Martin-led boycott of the Canadian Curling Association for its refusal to allow the developments in the World Curling Tour to be mirrored in the Brier catalyzed not only the transformation of the Brier, but also the growth of the Grand Slam, and in doing so, ultimately allowed the sport of curling to become a legitimate spectator sport. The development of the competitive tier of the sport also marked a change in both the players of the sport and the sport itself, as evidenced by improvements in the development and training of curlers as athletes and improvements in the quality of curling games due to better ice conditions and precision-based gameplay.|$|E
5|$|E.P. Arnold Royalton, {{owner of}} {{conglomerate}} Royalton Industries, offers Speed an astoundingly luxurious lifestyle {{in exchange for}} signing to race with him. Speed is tempted but declines due to his father's distrust of power-hungry corporations. Angered, Royalton reveals that for many years the key races have been fixed <b>by</b> <b>corporate</b> interests, including Royalton himself, to gain profits. Royalton takes out his anger on Speed by having his drivers force Speed into a crash that destroys the Mach 6 and suing Racer Motors for intellectual property infringement. Speed gets an opportunity to retaliate through Inspector Detector, head of a corporate crimes division. Racer Taejo Togokahn {{says that he has}} evidence that could indict Royalton but will only offer it up if Speed and the mysterious masked Racer X agree to race on his team in the Casa Cristo 5000. Taejo says that a win could substantially raise the stock price of his family's racing business, blocking a Royalton-arranged buyout. Speed agrees but keeps his decision secret from his family, and Inspector Detector's team makes several defensive modifications to the Mach 5 to assist Speed in the rally.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{hospital building}} is now largely occupied <b>by</b> <b>corporate</b> offices. The 1966 extension houses the library, art store, and document archives while the 1980s redevelopments created exhibition space over five floors. The first stage created 8,000m2 of gallery space of which 4,600m2 was new, {{and the second}} provided a further 1,600m2. The final phase, the Southwest Infill, was partly funded by a £12.6 million grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund and provided 5,860m2 of gallery space and educational facilities over six floors. Before the 2013-14 redevelopment, the basement was occupied by permanent galleries on the First and Second World Wars, and of conflicts after 1945. The ground floor comprised the atrium, cinema, temporary exhibition spaces, and visitor facilities. The first floor included the atrium mezzanine, education facilities, and a permanent gallery, Secret War, exploring special forces, espionage and covert operations. The second floor included the atrium viewing balcony, two art galleries, a temporary exhibition area and the permanent Crimes against Humanity exhibition. The third floor housed the permanent Holocaust Exhibition, and the fourth floor, a vaulted roof space, accommodated the Lord Ashcroft Gallery. Opened in November 2010 the gallery exhibits the museum's Victoria Cross (VC) and George Cross collection, alongside the private VC collection amassed by Michael Ashcroft, 241 medals in total.|$|E
