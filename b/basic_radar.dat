40|$|This diploma {{thesis is}} devoted to the design and {{analysis}} of a radar signal enabling an object classification capability in surveillance radar systems based on high-resolution radar range profiles. It picks up the research results from Kastinger (2006), who investigated classification algorithms for high-resolution radar range profiles, and Meier (2007), who programmed a MATLAB toolbox for the evaluation of radar signals. A classical, brief, introduction to radar fundamentals is given (Chapter 1) as well as the motivation for this thesis and certain basic parameters used. After high-resolution radar range profiles are discussed with special focus on surveillance radar systems (Chapter 2), the results of Kastinger (2006) are picked up (Chapter 3) as far as necessary for the following chapters of this thesis. Following the chapters on <b>radar</b> <b>basics,</b> high-resolution <b>radar</b> range profiles and classification, <b>basic</b> and advanced <b>radar</b> signals are discussed and analysed, especially their range resolution and sidelobe levels (Chapter 4). This includes linear frequency-modulated pulses and nonlinear frequency-modulated pulses as well as phase-coded pulses, coherent trains of identical pulses, and stepped-frequency waveforms. Their analysis is based on Meier's MATLAB toolbox. In Chapter 5 we will bring up additional points that have to be considered in radar system design for implementing a classification capability, before this thesis ends with an overall conclusion (Chapter 6) ...|$|R

5000|$|To obtain {{reliability}} {{in providing}} accurate trajectory data, the Mercury spacecraft {{was equipped with}} C-band and S-band cooperative beacons.

Although it originally had a range capability of only 250 nmi km, most of the FPS-16 radar units selected for the project had been modified for operation up to 500 nmi km, a NASA requirement, and modification kits were obtained for the remaining systems.

5000|$|<b>Basic</b> <b>radar</b> ECM {{strategies}} are (1) radar interference, (2) target modifications, and (3) changing the electrical properties of air. [...] Interference techniques include jamming and deception. Jamming {{is accomplished by}} a friendly platform transmitting signals on the radar frequency to produce a noise level sufficient to hide echos. [...] The jammer's continuous transmissions will provide a clear direction to the enemy radar, but no range information. [...] Deception may use a transponder to mimic the radar echo with a delay to indicate incorrect range. [...] Transponders may alternatively increase return echo strength {{to make a small}} decoy appear to be a larger target. [...] Target modifications include radar absorbing coatings and modifications of the surface shape to either [...] "stealth" [...] a high-value target or enhance reflections from a decoy. [...] Dispersal of small aluminium strips called chaff is a common method of changing the electromagnetic properties of air to provide confusing radar echos.|$|E
5000|$|As Nazi Germany rearmed, Plendl {{and others}} saw the {{possibilities}} of using radio beams to guide bombers to their target, {{and they began to}} develop a system under the code name “X-System” (X-Verfahren). Using technology previously used for his Lorenz beam landing system, Plendl developed a system that would guide planes to their target, and which improved the accuracy of bombing at night or in poor weather conditions. [...] This work was conducted for the German Airforce (Luftwaffe) at the Airforce Experimental Station (Erprobungstelle der Luftwaffe) at Rechlin, Germany, and also at Peenemunde. At the same time the system code named [...] "Knickebein" [...] was coined by the Telefunken electronics firm. Although it could use the Lorenz landing system for guidance, it was less accurate and more prone to jamming. Both systems employed transmitter towers on the English channel and the North Sea to transmit radar beams over targets in England. German bombers carried <b>basic</b> <b>radar</b> detectors and complex timing devices, also invented by Dr. Plendl, to lead them on the correct path and to guide the timing of the release of their bombs.|$|E
50|$|If {{the rise}} and fall times of the {{modulation}} pulses are zero, (e.g. the pulse edges are infinitely sharp), then the sidebands will be as shown in the spectral diagrams above. The bandwidth consumed by this transmission can be huge and the total power transmitted is distributed over many hundreds of spectral lines. This is a potential source of interference with any other device and frequency-dependent imperfections in the transmit chain mean that some of this power never arrives at the antenna. In reality of course, it is impossible to achieve such sharp edges, so in practical systems the sidebands contain far fewer lines than a perfect system. If the bandwidth can be limited to include relatively few sidebands, by rolling off the pulse edges intentionally, an efficient system can be realised with the minimum of potential for interference with nearby equipment. However, the trade-off of this is that slow edges make range resolution poor. Early radars limited the bandwidth through filtration in the transmit chain, e.g. the waveguide, scanner etc., but performance could be sporadic with unwanted signals breaking through at remote frequencies and the edges of the recovered pulse being indeterminate. Further examination of the <b>basic</b> <b>Radar</b> Spectrum shown above shows that the information in the various lobes of the Coarse Spectrum is identical to that contained in the main lobe, so limiting the transmit and receive bandwidth to that extent provides significant benefits in terms of efficiency and noise reduction.|$|E
