40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{approach}} to the fermion sign problem in systems where there is a coupling U such that when it is infinite the fermions are paired into bosons and there is no fermion permutation sign to worry about. We argue that as U becomes finite fermions are liberated but are naturally confined to regions which we refer to as fermion bags. The fermion sign problem is then confined to these bags and may be solved using the determinantal trick. In the parameter regime where the fermion bags are small and their typical size does not grow with the system size, construction of Monte Carlo methods that are far more efficient than conventional algorithms should be possible. In the region where the fermion <b>bags</b> <b>grow</b> with system size, the fermion bag approach continues to provide an alternative approach to the problem but may lose its main advantage in terms of efficiency. The fermion bag approach also provides new insights and solutions to sign problems. A natural solution to the "silver blaze problem" also emerges. Using the three dimensional massless lattice Thirring model as an example we introduce the fermion bag approach and demonstrate some of these features.

40|$|Background: In {{the end of}} 2009, a {{large number}} of {{patients}} with cancer undergoing chemotherapy at the day care unit of a private hospital in Mumbai, India developed Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) blood stream infection (BSI). Objective: The objectives were to identify the source of the outbreak and terminate the outbreak as rapidly as possible. Materials and Methods: All infection control protocols and processes were reviewed. Intensive training was started for all nursing staff involved in patient care. Cultures were sent from the environment (surfaces, water, air), intravenous fluids, disinfectants and antiseptics and opened/unopened medication. Results: A total of 13 patients with cancer with tunneled catheters were affected with BCC BSI. The isolates were of similar antimicrobial sensitivity. No significant breach of infection control protocols could be identified. Cultures from the prepared intravenous medication <b>bags</b> <b>grew</b> BCC. Subsequently, culture from unused vials of the antiemetic granisetron grew BCC, whereas those from the unopened IV fluid bag and chemotherapy medication were negative. On review, it was discovered that the outbreak started when a new brand of granisetron was introduced. The result was communicated to the manufacturer and the brand was withdrawn. There were no further cases. Conclusions: This outbreak was thus linked to intrinsic contamination of medication vials. We acknowledge a delay in identifying the source as we were concentrating more on human errors in medication preparation and less on intrinsic contamination. We recommend that in an event of an outbreak, unopened vials be cultured at the outset...|$|R

Finally, he undertook to make his horse trot a little. The horse, however, by this time, began to grow somewhat impatient at the unusual sensations which he experienced--the weight of the rider being concentrated upon one single point, directly on his back, and resting very unsteadily and interruptedly there,--and the bridle-reins passing up almost perpendicularly into the air, instead of declining backwards, as they ought to do in any proper position of the horseman. He began to trot forward faster and faster. Jemmy soon found that it would be prudent to restrain him, but in his upright position, he had no control over the horse by pulling the reins. He only pulled the horse's head upwards, and made him more uneasy and impatient than before. He then attempted to get down into a sitting posture again, but in doing so, he fell off upon the hard road and sprained his ankle. The horse trotted rapidly on, until the bags fell off, first one and then the other.

An all-time record of 1.2 million saplings were grown by people in the Sirsi area in 1984-1985. No doubt this was possible due to {{the cooperation of the}} forest department, which supplied the plastic <b>bags</b> for <b>growing</b> saplings. In the process of developing the decentralized nursery, the activists realized that forest department makes extra money in raising a nursery. The cost paid for one sapling grown by a villager was 20 paise (US 2c), whereas the cost of a single sapling raised by the forest department amounted to a minimum of Rs 2 (US 15c). In addition, the forest department used fertilizers and gave tablets to saplings. The Appiko Movement's experience has brought an overuse of chemical fertilizers into the forest nursery, making it a capital-intensive, money-making program. The nursery program propagated by the forest department is really a means for utilizing village labor at cheap rates. Appiko activists have learned lessons from this experience, and they are now growing saplings only to meet their own needs, not to give to the forest department.|$|R

The constituents of the most attractive growing medium tested were determined by gas chroma-tography analysis using a steam-distillation procedure. We found that fungus gnat adults were more attracted to the growing medium, SB 300 Universal Professional Growing Mix, which contains composted bark, than to another growing medium (Sunshine LC 1 Mix) and their components when tested in a series of laboratory experiments using multiple-choice experimental arenas. A higher percentage of fungus gnat adults were attracted to moist SB 300 (92 %) than SB 300 growing medium that had been oven dried (8 %). In addition, fungus gnat adults preferred SB 300 although they had been reared on Sunshine LC 1 Mix. When comparing the SB 300 fresh from the <b>bag</b> to <b>growing</b> medium that had been pasteurized and moistened with water, gas chromatographic-mass spectroscopic data showed there were declines in several terpenoid constituents as well as an increase in fatty acids and cyclosulfur.

Plants would contribute to the proportion of food and reduce the dependency on food from Earth. In addition, plants would provide oxygen production, carbon dioxide removal, and psychological benefits.

40|$|Introduction Facing the {{challenging}} treatment of neurodegenerative diseases {{as well as}} complex craniofacial injuries such as those common after cancer therapy, the field of regenerative medicine increasingly relies on stem cell transplantation strategies. Here, neural crest-derived stem cells (NCSCs) offer many promising applications, although scale up of clinical-grade processes prior to potential transplantations is currently limiting. In this study, we aimed to establish a clinical-grade, cost-reducing cultivation system for NCSCs isolated from the adult human nose using cGMP-grade Afc-FEP bags. Methods We cultivated human neural crest-derived stem cells from inferior turbinate (ITSCs) in a cell culture bag system using Afc-FEP bags in human blood plasma-supplemented medium. Investigations of viability, proliferation and expression profile of bag-cultured ITSCs were followed by DNA-content and telomerase activity determination. Cultivated ITSCs were introduced to directed in vitro differentiation assays to assess their potential for mesodermal and ectodermal differentiation. Mesodermal differentiation was determined using an enzyme activity assay (alkaline phosphatase, ALP), respective stainings (Alizarin Red S, Von Kossa and Oil Red O), and RT-PCR, while immunocytochemistry and synaptic vesicle recycling were applied to assay neuroectodermal differentiation of ITSCs. Results When cultivated within Afc-FEP <b>bags,</b> ITSCs <b>grew</b> three-dimensionally in a human blood plasma-derived matrix, thereby showing unchanged morphology, proliferation capability, viability and expression profile in comparison to three dimensionally-cultured ITSCs growing in standard cell culture plastics. Genetic stability of bag-cultured ITSCs was further accompanied by unchanged telomerase activity. Importantly, ITSCs retained their potential to differentiate into mesodermal cell types, particularly including ALP-active, Alizarin Red S-, and Von Kossa-positive osteogenic cell types, as well as adipocytes positive in Oil Red O assays. Bag culture further {{did not affect the}} potential of ITSCs to undergo differentiation into neuroectodermal cell types coexpressing β-III-tubulin and MAP 2 and exhibiting the capability for synaptic vesicle recycling. Conclusions Here, we report {{for the first time the}} successful cultivation of human NCSCs within cGMP-grade Afc-FEP bags using a human blood plasma-supplemented medium. Our findings particularly demonstrate the unchanged differentiation capability and genetic stability of the cultivated NCSCs, suggesting the great potential of this culture system for future medical applications in the field of regenerative medicine. ...|$|R
40|$|Women of the World War II {{home front}} {{adjusted}} to war related fabric shortages and rationing {{through the use}} of ingenious alternatives. While yard goods were subject to war rationing, and ready to wear garments were redesigned to use less fabric, a segment of the American population took advantage of another option. These families continued to create a number of attractive garments and household items throughout the war from a type of cotton percale which was available for free and classified as an unrestricted industrial good. The cotton commodity bag or cotton feed sack, gained popularity as an alternative to traditional yard goods throughout rural communities. This tradition began {{at the turn of the}} 20 th century and continued to grow with the support of grain manufacturers and the Department of Agriculture, which published a number of pattern booklets designed specifically for commodity bags. Three 100 lbs sacks of grain could make an average sized adult dress and packaging companies hired notable fabric designers from Europe and New York City to create colorful dress prints for their cotton packaging. This tradition continued into the 1960 s, bolstered by the annual industry sponsored Cotton Bag Sewing Queen contest. The contest was held at state fairs nationwide throughout the 1950 s and 1960 s to maintain consumer interest in the cotton bag at a time when the paper commodity <b>bag</b> began to <b>grow</b> in popularity with manufacturers...|$|R
40|$|O objetivo do trabalho foi determinar o crescimento, a produção e a qualidade das frutas do morangueiro cultivado em três sistemas fechados sem solo e com dois substratos. Os sistemas foram testados no {{interior}} de um abrigo telado, no Departamento de Fitotecnia da UFSM, no período entre 27 de abril e 21 de novembro de 2006. Esses sistemas foram constituídos por sacolas fertirrigadas por tubos gotejadores e calhas e leito de cultivo fertirrigados por subirrigação. Foram empregados substrato orgânico Plantmax PXT® e areia. O delineamento experimental utilizado foi um fatorial 3 x 2, com quatro repetições. A fertirrigação foi feita com solução nutritiva completa, sem nenhum descarte durante todo o período experimental, e as frutas foram colhidas maduras. Foram determinados os seguintes parâmetros: a produção, a firmeza, a acidez e o teor de sólidos solúveis totais. Interações significativas entre os sistemas e os substratos foram observadas. Na areia, destacou-se o cultivo nas calhas, com produção de 1017, 4 g planta- 1, sendo 8, 13 % e 8, 33 % superior às sacolas e ao leito de cultivo, respectivamente. A produção mais elevada foi de 1196, 5 g planta- 1, obtida com substrato orgânico no leito de cultivo, superior às sacolas em 10, 9 % e às calhas em 29, 33 %. Concluiu-se que o cultivo sem solo do morangueiro sem descartes de solução nutritiva é possível e que a produção é influenciada pelo sistema de cultivo e pelo substrato, sem efeitos sobre a qualidade das frutas. The {{objective of}} the research was to determine fruit production and quality of strawberry plants grown in three different closed soilless systems and two substrates. The experiment was conducted in a screenhouse at Department of Fitotecnia, UFSM, from April to November, 2006. The soilless growing systems were plastic bags, plastic troughs and growing beds, and the substrates were sand and the organic substrate Plantmax PXT®. A 3 x 2 factorial experimental design was used, with four replications. Drip fertigation {{was used in the}} plastic bags and sub-irrigation in the other two systems. A standard complete nutrient solution was used without any disposal of it during the experiment. Ripe fruits were harvested and production, firmness, acidity and soluble solids were determined. A significant interaction among substrates and systems was observed. In sand, a mean fruit production of 1017, 4 g plants- 1 was obtained in plastic troughs, which was 8. 13 % e 8. 33 % higher than in plastic <b>bags</b> and <b>growing</b> beds, respectively. In the organic substrate, the higher fruit production was 1196, 5 g plants- 1 in growing beds. It was 10. 9 % and 29. 33 % higher than that in plastic bags and plastic troughs, respectively. It was concluded that strawberry soilless production might be done without any disposal of nutrient solution during the cropping period. Fruit production was affected by both the growing system and the substrate, without any effect on fruit quality...|$|R
40|$|During {{upstream}} bioprocess development, a high producing production organism is selected, {{an appropriate}} growth media is formulated, and optimal bioreactor growth conditions and cultivation schemes are established. Hundreds of experiments must {{be carried out}} to accomplish these objectives. The first aspect of my dissertation research was to improve the tools available for carrying out this multitude of development experiments. First, optical sensors for dissolved oxygen (DO) and pH were compared to traditional electrochemical probes during hybridoma cell culture in a 5 L bioreactor. There was a 98. 7 and 99. 7 % correlation between our DO and pH optical sensors and the electrochemical probes, respectively, throughout the duration of the experiment. These optical sensors were also employed in a high throughput bioreactor (HTBR) system capable of simultaneously carrying out twelve 35 ml cell culture experiments. We validated the HTBR for use in process change studies by testing bioreactor reproducibility in terms of sensor and cell culture data. We also showed that sensor instrumentation had no impact on cell physiology at the transcript level. Cell culture comparisons were carried out between the HTBR, a 5 L lab scale stirred-tank bioreactor, and a disposable <b>bag</b> bioreactor. Cells <b>grew</b> similarly in all three systems, but achieved a higher productivity in the bag bioreactor. In addition to during development, changes are made at the cell culture level throughout the biopharmaceutical product lifetime to allow for improvements such as enhanced expression systems, different media components, increased yields, scale-up, and new technologies. The second aspect of my dissertation research was to evaluate the utility of using DNA microarrays to screen cell culture process changes for their potential to adversely affect product quality. We studied the impact of sodium butyrate addition, increased osmolality, and change in bioreactor type. All process changes resulted in significant differences in gene expression and culture behavior. In summary, we have shown that DNA microarrays can be used to profile the transcriptional response of industrially relevant cell culture process changes...|$|R
