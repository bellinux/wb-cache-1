5|$|The {{death of}} Eardwulf is not recorded. Although he had faced {{considerable}} opposition and had <b>been</b> <b>driven</b> into exile, {{he succeeded in}} founding a dynasty. His son Eanred and grandson Æthelred (II) ruled Northumbria {{for most of its}} remaining existence as an independent kingdom.|$|E
5|$|While besieging Potidea, Artabazus {{also decided}} to besiege Olynthus, which was also in revolt. The town was held by the Bottiaean tribe, who had <b>been</b> <b>driven</b> out of Macedon. Having taken the town, he massacred the defenders, and handed over the town to the Chalcidian people.|$|E
5|$|According to a {{mitochondrial}} DNA analysis, {{the black}} wildebeest {{seem to have}} diverged from the main lineage during the Middle Pleistocene and became a distinct species around a million years ago. A divergence rate of approximately 2% has been calculated. The split {{does not seem to}} have <b>been</b> <b>driven</b> by competition for resources but instead by the fact that each species adopted a different ecological niche and occupied a different trophic level.|$|E
50|$|These EMUs <b>are</b> <b>driven</b> by four 185 kW 1500 Volts DC motors. Units {{built before}} 1970 <b>were</b> <b>driven</b> by a Jeumont-Heidmann {{camshaft}} controller. After 1970, Thyristor <b>drive</b> <b>were</b> used instead.|$|R

5|$|By nation, the {{greatest}} number of Auschwitz's Jewish victims were from Hungary, accounting for 438,000 deaths, followed by Polish Jews (300,000 deaths), French (69,000), Dutch (60,000), and Greek (55,000). Fewer than one percent of Soviet Jews murdered in the Holocaust were killed in Auschwitz, as German forces had already <b>been</b> <b>driven</b> from Russia when the killing at Auschwitz reached its peak in 1944. Approximately 1 in 6 Jews killed in the Holocaust died at the camp.|$|E
5|$|That evening, D Company {{loaded into}} trucks {{traveled}} {{north to the}} assembly area through a heavy rain. On the way they met two truckloads of South Korean police going south, some of them wounded. These were the police who, together with the detachment of the I Platoon, had <b>been</b> <b>driven</b> off Ka-san that afternoon. After waiting in the rain awhile for orders, the Engineer company turned around {{and went back to}} camp.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} growth has <b>been</b> <b>driven</b> by {{the expansion of}} services that have been growing consistently faster than other sectors. It is argued that the pattern of Indian development has been a specific one and that the country {{may be able to}} skip the intermediate industrialisation-led phase in the transformation of its economic structure. Serious concerns have been raised about the jobless nature of the {{economic growth}}.|$|E
50|$|While most {{mandrels}} <b>are</b> <b>driven</b> {{by direct}} connection to an electric motor or engine, other mandrels <b>are</b> <b>driven</b> by attachment to a bearing-supported, pulley-driven shaft.|$|R

5|$|The near-absence of {{herbivore}} {{remains and}} the similar {{state of preservation}} common to the many individuals at the Albertosaurus bonebed quarry led Currie {{to conclude that the}} locality was not a predator trap like the La Brea Tar Pits in California, and that all of the preserved animals died at the same time. Currie claims this as evidence of pack behaviour. Other scientists are skeptical, observing that the animals may have <b>been</b> <b>driven</b> together by drought, flood or for other reasons.|$|E
5|$|The prose, while simple at {{the level}} of the {{sentence}} (and we can safely assume that Hofmann's translation is very faithful to the original), is shifty, blurred, to the point where at times we are left unsure as to what exactly is going on – a deliberate flight from causation, quite understandable in a country where everyone (even, we learn, the horses) has <b>been</b> <b>driven</b> mad by fear.|$|E
5|$|A {{reconnaissance}} patrol from the 13th Parachute Battalion reported a large gathering of Germans in Bréville and suspected an attack was imminent. At 08:00 a massive artillery and mortar bombardment fell along the 1st Special Service Brigade lines, while the 857th Grenadier Regiment, which had {{gathered in the}} village, attacked No. 6 Commando. By 10:30, the attack on No. 6 Commando had <b>been</b> <b>driven</b> back, but to their left at Hauger No.4 Commandos had to win a hand-to-hand fight before the Germans withdrew. Twice more during the day the commandos were attacked unsuccessfully, from Sallenelles {{in the north and}} again from Bréville.|$|E

5|$|About 20 North Korean {{soldiers}} approached, undiscovered, {{close enough}} to the 1st Battalion, 24th Infantry, command post west of Haman to throw grenades and fire into it. About 45 soldiers of the battalion command group and 20 South Korean recruits were in position there at the time. The North Koreans were driven off at dawn, but Major Eugene J. Carson, battalion executive officer, then discovered that he had on the position with him only 30 men, 7 of them wounded. Looking back down the hill, Carson saw approximately 40 men get up out of the rice paddies and go over to a tank at a roadblock position. These men reported to the regiment that they had <b>been</b> <b>driven</b> off the hill. Three tanks near the command post helped clear the town of North Koreans.|$|E
5|$|Born in 1541, {{in either}} the village of Fodele or Candia (the Venetian name of Chandax, present day Heraklion) on Crete, El Greco was descended from a prosperous urban family, which had {{probably}} <b>been</b> <b>driven</b> out of Chania to Candia after an uprising against the Catholic Venetians between 1526 and 1528. El Greco's father, Geórgios Theotokópoulos (d. 1556), was a merchant and tax collector. Nothing is known about his mother or his first wife, also Greek. El Greco's older brother, Manoússos Theotokópoulos (1531– 13 December 1604), was a wealthy merchant and spent {{the last years of}} his life (1603–1604) in El Greco's Toledo home.|$|E
5|$|Crysta is a fairy with {{a curious}} nature living in FernGully, a {{pristine}} rainforest free from human intervention. The fairies of FernGully {{once lived in}} harmony with humans, but believe them to have gone extinct after having <b>been</b> <b>driven</b> away by a dark spirit named Hexxus. Crysta is the apprentice of Magi, a motherly-figure fairy who imprisoned Hexxus in a tree. One day Crysta explores a new part of the forest and meets Batty, a bat {{who claims to have}} been experimented on by humans, giving him an obstreperous and unstable personality. However, fairies refuse to believe him, except for Crysta, who volunteers to investigate the situation. She sees Zak, a young lumberjack whom Crysta accidentally shrinks when she tries to save him from being crushed by a falling tree, though does not know how to restore him to normal size.|$|E

50|$|Threaded {{fasteners}} {{either have}} a tapered shank or a non-tapered shank. Fasteners with tapered shanks {{are designed to}} either <b>be</b> <b>driven</b> into a substrate directly or into a pilot hole in a substrate. Mating threads are formed in the substrate as these fasteners <b>are</b> <b>driven</b> in. Fasteners with a non-tapered shank are designed to mate with a nut or to <b>be</b> <b>driven</b> into a tapped hole.|$|R
40|$|A flow {{model of}} labor market {{participation}} {{is used to}} describe how various exogenous variations jointly affect unemployment and participation and provides short-run identification restrictions of a structural VAR. In some countries, fast rising female participation {{may have had a}} moderate short- and medium-run impact on unemployment rates. A variance decomposition exercise indicates that, in Continental Europe, participation <b>is</b> <b>driven</b> in the short run by unemployment shocks, whereas in the USA, it <b>is</b> <b>driven</b> by participation shocks (demography, immigration). Unemployment in Europe <b>is</b> <b>driven</b> by participation shocks, whereas in the USA, it <b>is</b> <b>driven</b> by unemployment shocks...|$|R
5|$|Dumouriez {{thought his}} soldiers' morale was too shaky for a retreat so he {{advanced}} on Coburg's army, seeking battle. In his haste, the French commander failed {{to call up}} Harville's corps or the Army of Holland as reinforcements. Earlier, François Joseph Drouot de Lamarche had <b>been</b> <b>driven</b> out of Tienen (Tirlemont), but on 16 March the French recaptured it after a vigorous combat. The French attacked Tienen with 10,000 troops while Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen defended the town with 6,000 soldiers, six guns and two mortars. French casualties numbered 500 while their opponents sustained losses of 800 killed, wounded and missing. Coburg pulled his army back behind the Little Gete River. Believing that he outnumbered his enemies, Dumouriez was very confident of success. A century before, the French had won the Battle of Landen on the same ground.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 12th century onwards the Normans {{began to build}} new castles in stone and convert {{existing}} timber designs. This was initially a slow process, picking up speed towards {{the second half of}} the century. Traditionally this transition was believed to have <b>been</b> <b>driven</b> by the more crude nature of wooden fortifications, the limited life of timber in wooden castles and its vulnerability to fire; recent archaeological studies have however shown that many wooden castles were as robust and as complex as their stone equivalents. Some wooden castles were not converted into stone for many years and instead expanded in wood, such as at Hen Domen.|$|E
5|$|Hart Bochner as City Councilman Arthur Reeves; {{a corrupt}} city {{official}} {{who was once}} an intern for Carl Beaumont. He later becomes involved with Valestra's gang {{in order to gain}} the influence to enter City Council, and told them where his former boss was hiding in return for campaign funds. Years later, Joker tracks him down and poisons him with his trademark toxin. He last appears in the Gotham City Mental Hospital, having <b>been</b> <b>driven</b> insane by the Joker's chemicals and possibly died as a result. Bochner's father, Lloyd Bochner, voiced of Mayor Hamilton Hill in The Animated Series.|$|E

5|$|Ignoring the batteries, Stopford {{ordered his}} {{squadron}} to attack at 09:00 on 24 February, HMS Defiance leading the line. Shortly after the main batteries of Stopford's ships {{of the line}} came into the battle, the French ships were overwhelmed {{one by one and}} shortly after noon all three had <b>been</b> <b>driven</b> ashore with heavy casualties. British histories recount that all three were destroyed, although French histories report that they were salvaged but found to be damaged beyond repair. The fleet under Willaumez was trapped in the anchorage at Basque Roads on 26 February and defeated at the Battle of Basque Roads in April with heavy losses.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} tenth century, the East Anglian Danes came under {{increasing}} pressure from Edward the Elder, king of Wessex. In 902 Edward's cousin Æthelwold ætheling, who had <b>been</b> <b>driven</b> into exile after an unsuccessful {{bid for the}} throne, arrived in Essex after a stay in Northumbria. He was apparently accepted as king by {{some or all of}} the Danes in England and in 903 he induced the East Anglian Danes to wage war on Edward. This ended in disaster, with the death of Æthelwold and of Eohric of East Anglia in a battle in the Fens.|$|E
5|$|Passing {{through the}} hands of four owners during its troubled 23-year history, Nittany Furnace never {{fulfilled}} the expectations developed when it replaced the antiquated (charcoal) Bellefonte Furnace. It should arguably never have been built: {{by the time it}} went into blast in 1888, the price per ton of iron had already <b>been</b> <b>driven</b> below $22, a historic low, and it would almost never rise above that figure until the onset of World War I. The sprawling steel works of Pittsburgh, fed by Mesabi Range ore, could produce iron more cheaply than the furnaces at Bellefonte ever could. The principal advantage of a Bellefonte location — proximity to local ore deposits — was negated by the availability of easily mined, high-grade Mesabi ore, hauled by rail.|$|E
