5|$|The Jacob is a {{traditional}} British breed of domestic sheep. It combines two characteristics unusual in sheep: it is piebald – dark-coloured with areas of white wool – and it is often polycerate or multi-horned. It most commonly has four horns. The origin of the breed is not known; broken-coloured polycerate sheep were present in England {{by the middle of}} the seventeenth century, and were widespread a century later. A <b>breed</b> <b>society</b> was formed in 1969, and a flock book was published from 1972.|$|E
5|$|Developed from ponies {{taken to}} Iceland by Norse {{settlers}} in the 9th and 10th centuries, the breed is mentioned in literature and historical records throughout Icelandic history; the first reference to a named horse appears in the 12th century. Horses were venerated in Norse mythology, a custom brought to Iceland by the country's earliest settlers. Selective breeding over the centuries has developed the breed into its current form. Natural selection has also played a role, as the harsh Icelandic climate eliminated many horses through cold and starvation. In the 1780s, much of the breed was wiped out {{in the aftermath of}} a volcanic eruption at Laki. The first <b>breed</b> <b>society</b> for the Icelandic horse was created in Iceland in 1904, and today the breed is represented by organizations in 19different nations, organized under a parent association, the International Federation of Icelandic Horse Associations.|$|E

5|$|The Domesday Book records ponies on Exmoor in 1086, and {{descendants}} of ponies {{removed from the}} moor in 1818 form the foundation bloodstock of today's Exmoor breed, although a <b>breed</b> <b>society</b> was not formed until 1921. The breed nearly became extinct after the Second World War, owing to soldiers using them for target practice and thieves killing them for their meat. After the war {{a small group of}} breeders worked to save the Exmoor, and during the 1950s ponies began to be exported to North America. The first stud book was published in 1963, and in 1981 publicity resulted in increased interest in the breed. As of 2010 there were an estimated 800 Exmoor ponies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|The Rathores, {{traditional}} {{rulers of}} the Marwar region of western India, {{were the first to}} breed the Marwari. Beginning in the 12th century, they espoused strict breeding that promoted purity and hardiness. Used throughout history as a cavalry horse by the people of the Marwar region, the Marwari was noted for its loyalty and bravery in battle. The breed deteriorated in the 1930s, when poor management practices resulted in a reduction of the breeding stock, but today has regained some of its popularity. The Marwari is used for light draught and agricultural work, as well as riding and packing. In 1995, a <b>breed</b> <b>society</b> was formed for the Marwari in India. The exportation of Marwaris was banned for decades, but between 2000 and 2006, a small number of exports were allowed. Since 2008, visas allowing temporary travel of Marwaris outside India have been available in small numbers.|$|E
5|$|The Welsh Pony and Cob is a {{group of}} four closelyrelated horse breeds {{including}} both pony and cob types, which originated in Wales in the United Kingdom. The four sections within the <b>breed</b> <b>society</b> for the Welsh breeds are primarily distinguished by height, and also by variations in type: the smallest Welsh Mountain Pony (Section A); the slightly taller but refined Welsh Pony of riding type (Section B) popular as a children's show mount; the small but stocky Welsh Pony of Cob Type (Section C), popular for riding and competitive driving; and the tallest, the Welsh Cob (Section D), which can be ridden by adults. Welsh ponies and cobs in all sections are known for their good temperament, hardiness, and free-moving gaits.|$|E

500|$|The {{government}} of India had originally banned {{the export of}} indigenous horse breeds, although not polo ponies or Thoroughbreds, in 1952. This ban was partially lifted in 1999, when {{a small number of}} indigenous horses could be exported after receiving a special license. Kelly imported the first Marwari horse into the United States in 2000. Over the next seven years, 21 horses were exported, until, in 2006, licenses stopped being granted over concerns that native breeding populations were being threatened. One of the last Marwaris to be exported was the first to be imported to Europe, in 2006, when a stallion was given to the French Living Museum of the Horse. In 2008, the Indian government began granting licenses for [...] "temporary exports" [...] of up to one year, to allow horses to be exhibited in other countries. This was in response to breeders and the <b>breed</b> <b>society,</b> who felt they were not being allowed a fair chance to exhibit their animals.|$|E
500|$|The Suffolk Punch {{registry}} is {{the oldest}} English <b>breed</b> <b>society.</b> [...] The first known mention of the Suffolk Punch is in William Camden's Britannia, published in 1586, in which he describes a working horse of the eastern counties of England that is easily recognisable as the Suffolk Punch. This description makes them the oldest breed of horse that is recognisable in the same form today. A detailed genetic study shows that the Suffolk Punch is closely genetically grouped {{not only with the}} Fell and Dales British ponies, but also with the European Haflinger. They were developed in Norfolk and Suffolk in the east of England, a relatively isolated area. The local farmers developed the Suffolk Punch for farm work, for which they needed a horse with power, stamina, health, longevity, and docility, and they bred the Suffolk to comply with these needs. [...] Because the farmers used these horses on their land, they seldom had any to sell, which helped to keep the bloodlines pure and unchanged.|$|E

500|$|Today the Eriskay is rare. Its {{population}} {{is considered to}} be at critical status by the UK-based Rare Breeds Survival Trust, meaning that there are 300 or fewer breeding females registered in the world today. In 2006, there were believed to have been around 300 mares and 4 purebred stallions, and by 2009 this number had risen to around 420 ponies worldwide. It is possible that the Eriskay is the last surviving Hebrides pony breed. There are two breed registries that represent the breed. The first (the Eriskay Pony (Purebred) Studbook Society or Comann Each nan Eilean, formed in 1971 [...] has the goal of maintaining the purity of the Eriskay breed, and disallows all crossbreeding. The second (the Eriskay Pony Society, formed in 1986 [...] aims to produce ponies with desirable traits, which the registry feels will help promote their survival [...] this registry has considered the possibility of cross-breeding. The Eriskay Pony Society achieved legal recognition as a <b>breed</b> <b>society</b> and passport issuing organisation for the UK in 1995; Comann Each nan Eilean did not receive legal recognition until 2002.|$|E
500|$|All ponies grazing on the New Forest {{are owned}} by New Forest commoners– people who have [...] "rights of common of pasture" [...] over the Forest lands. An annual marking fee is paid for each animal turned out to graze. The {{population}} of ponies on the Forest has fluctuated in response to varying demand for young stock. Numbers fell to fewer than six hundred in 1945, but have since risen steadily, and thousands now run loose in semi-feral conditions. The welfare of ponies grazing on the Forest is monitored by five Agisters, employees of the Verderers of the New Forest. Each Agister takes responsibility for a different area of the Forest. The ponies are gathered annually {{in a series of}} drifts, to be checked for health, wormed, and they are tail-marked; each pony's tail is trimmed to the pattern of the Agister responsible for that pony. Purebred New Forest stallions approved by the <b>Breed</b> <b>Society</b> and by the New Forest Verderers run out on the Forest with the mares for a short period each year. Many of the foals bred on the Forest are sold through the Beaulieu Road pony sales, which are held several times each year.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first attempt}} to define and {{register}} the breed was in 1898, when the ponies were entered into a studbook started by the Polo Pony Society. In 1924, the <b>breed</b> <b>society</b> was founded, and a studbook opened. [...] World War I and World War II were devastating to the breed. Only a handful of ponies were registered during World War II. However, after the war, local people began to inspect and register as many ponies as they could, and by the 1950s, numbers were back up.|$|E

It focuses on a case study of Welsh livestock and, in particular, the historic and contemporary roles that <b>breed</b> <b>societies</b> play in the imagination of farm animals and the creation of capitals in agriculture...|$|R
