5|$|Let's face it: we have {{a problem}} in Chicago. The name-calling and {{politics}} at City Hall are keeping us from tackling the real issues... I {{may not be the best}} speaker in town, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> how to run a government and how to bring people together.|$|E
25|$|E: I {{saw that}} vast sunset {{covering}} the whole sky. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> {{there was also}} a tree there outside the window, but I blocked it out.|$|E
25|$|I {{just want}} to say that when I was 16 or 17 years old, I went to see Buddy Holly play at Duluth National Guard Armory and I was three feet away from him… and he looked at me. And I just have some kind of feeling that he was – I don’t know how or why – <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> he was with us all the time we were making this record in some kind of way.|$|E
6000|$|... "After {{a second}} or so. I saw you {{recognised}} me. I couldn't place you, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> you. Then Archie being there helped me to remember." ...|$|R
6000|$|Agatha smiled gratefully, {{though she}} found it difficult. [...] "I didn't really choose. Sometimes <b>I</b> was afraid; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> had to go." ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Jones stiffened. Her lips moved soundlessly, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> to what syllables.|$|R
25|$|It was a {{long held}} family secret, and its deeply buried shame {{was brought to the}} surface and unraveled. We will never know the destinies and {{legacies}} these men would have chosen for themselves if they had been allowed to make that choice. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> this: their existence, however brief and cruelly interrupted, is forever woven into the fabric of my own life. My son will continue to be raised in an environment of tolerance, understanding and humility, now with even more pertinence than before.|$|E
25|$|We have {{recorded}} {{everything in the}} studio and are just waiting for Gaahl to put vocals on it. So we have only vocals and the final mix to go before it's all done. It's sometimes a nightmare to work with him in the studio because of the pride he puts into the smallest details. If he's not in the right mood or doesn't find the correct words we get nothing done. At times I've spent days in the studio counting seconds with nothing happening. It's the same way now, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> in the end the result will be unique and powerful.|$|E
25|$|I {{suspect that}} I know {{more of the}} English class than any man in Britain. I never kept any reckoning: <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that one year with another? — and less of late years than in earlier time? — I have talked to more than five in each year, giving {{more than a hundred}} and fifty specimens. Of this I am sure, that it is my own fault if they have not been a thousand. Nobody knows how they swarm, except those to whom they {{naturally}} resort. They are in all ranks and occupations, of all ages and characters. They are very earnest people, and their purpose is bona fide, the dissemination of their paradoxes. A great many — the mass, indeed — are illiterate, and a great many waste their means, and are in or approaching penury. These discoverers despise one another.|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> {{could not}} hide {{the change in}} me, and Matteo soon noticed it.|$|R
60|$|I muttered {{something}} about never dancing, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> that that which I said was inaudible.|$|R
60|$|Not to me. They {{wanted to}} hide it from me, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> they were talking.|$|R
25|$|The polite {{thing would}} be to say 'No comment'. But the truth is that... let's put it this way, you've never seen two actors more {{completely}} subservient and prostrate themselves {{at the feet of}} a director. Stanley was absolutely thrilled with the film. He was still working on the film when he died. And he probably died because he finally relaxed. It was one of the happiest weekends of his life, right before he died, after he had shown the first cut to Terry, Tom and Nicole. He would have kept working on it, like he did on all of his films. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that from people around him personally, my partner who was his assistant for thirty years. And I thought about R. Lee Ermey for In the Bedroom. And I talked to Stanley a lot about that film, and all I can say is Stanley was adamant that I shouldn't work with him for all kinds of reasons that I won't get into because {{there is no reason to}} do that to anyone, even if they are saying slanderous things that I know are completely untrue.|$|E
500|$|There {{are also}} many small rocks and skerries (small rock islands) in the seas around Gigha. Asked by a tourist {{if he knew}} where they all were, local {{resident}} Willie McSporran (see below) replied [...] "No, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> where they aren't and that's good enough for me".|$|E
500|$|McMahon made an {{appearance}} {{as a guest}} speaker at the WrestleMania XXVII Press Conference. Several months later, she appeared in a backstage segment at SummerSlam to wish CM Punk luck in his match. Upon offering to shake his hand, Punk declined and insulted her: [...] "I would, <b>but...</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> where that hand's been." [...] The following night on Raw, McMahon appeared backstage with CM Punk and threatened him: [...] "...in the end, people always get what they deserve." ...|$|E
60|$|I had {{hard work}} to keep my temper, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>I</b> must not lose it.|$|R
60|$|Indeed, Mulvaney seemed needlessly anxious; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> that {{he looked}} after Ortheris in a fatherly way.|$|R
60|$|EILEEN (happily). Isn't that wonderful, Stephen! <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> all {{the time}} you would. The story's so good.|$|R
500|$|Starved {{generated}} controversy {{even before}} its premiere. A number of {{specialists in the}} treatment of eating disorders expressed concern that the program would either make light of or glamorize eating disorders. Others, however, felt that Starved might focus attention on eating disorders as a serious medical condition. The National Eating Disorders Association called for a boycott of the show and claimed that Diageo (makers of Tanqueray) and Nautilus agreed to pull their advertising. Schaeffer responded to the controversy, saying [...] "there is some difficult stuff to watch. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> my spirit and intention are good." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{telling her}} love {{interest}} to [...] "sit back and watch", Beyoncé sings the chorus, where she states {{the things she}} will do to show her appreciation to her love interest, [...] "Tonight I'm gonna dance for you / Tonight I'm gonna dance for you / Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body / Boy, I like it when you watch me / Tonight it's going down." [...] In the second verse, she sings: [...] "You'll never need two, because I will be your number one / Them other chicks are superficial / <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> you know I'm the one / That's why I'm all into you / ...|$|E
500|$|Bates's book {{is cited}} in papers for its {{accurate}} early observations, such {{as of the}} urticating hairs of tarantulas, the puddle drinking habits of butterflies, or of the rich insect fauna in the tropics. The book and Bates' Amazon trip are covered in lecture courses on evolution. The warm reception of Bates's Naturalist was not confined to scientists. The novelists D.H. Lawrence and George Orwell both wrote admiringly of the book. Lawrence wrote to his friend S. S. Koteliansky [...] "I should like, from the Everyman Library Bates' – Naturalist on the Amazon... because I intend some day to go to South America – to Peru or Ecuador, not the Amazon. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> Bates is good." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{had heard}} {{something}} of Moissan, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> his artificial diamonds were very small. I shook my head.|$|R
60|$|For {{nearly a}} minute I did not speak, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> she was right, {{and at last}} I {{admitted}} it.|$|R

500|$|Inside the studio, {{the song}} evolved through several musical revisions. Heylin writes, [...] "It is the song's arrangement, and not its lyrics, that {{occupies}} the musicians through the wee small hours." [...] On the fifth take, released in 2005 on the , midtake Dylan stumbles on the formula [...] "Stuck inside of Mobile" [...] {{on the fourth}} verse, and never goes back. The song contains two oft-quoted pieces of Dylan's philosophy: [...] "Your debutante just knows what you need/ <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> what you want" [...] and [...] "here I sit so patiently/ Waiting {{to find out what}} price/ You have to pay to get out of/ Going through all these things twice".|$|E
500|$|... "I Need A Girl" [...] is a mid-tempo R ballad, {{featuring}} guitar riffs. According to Mark Edward Nero of About.com, {{the song}} contains familiar qualities of Songz's breakout hit [...] "Can't Help But Wait", also produced by Stargate. The song is lyrically about finding and pleasing the right woman, through lines such as, [...] "I don't even know your name, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that I'm your man {{and you are}} my girl, if I ever meet you I'm gonna give you the world, Baby please believe me when I tell you that I need a girl." [...] The song has been described to be a mix of Usher and Justin Timberlake, and {{has been compared to}} Chris Brown's [...] "With You." ...|$|E
500|$|Hundreds {{of actors}} sought the main {{roles in the}} film, {{including}} Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman and Richard Gere for Jacob, and Andie MacDowell, Julia Roberts and Madonna for Jezzie. Eventually, Tim Robbins and Elizabeth Peña were cast; both auditioned early and {{neither of them had}} starred in a feature film before. Robbins said the film presented for him [...] "a great opportunity to go in a different direction. I love doing comedy, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> I can do other things as well." [...] The film's military advisor was Vietnam veteran Captain Dale Dye, who provided a five-day boot camp military training for the actors playing soldiers in the Vietnam storyline (including Robbins, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Eriq La Salle and Ving Rhames).|$|E
60|$|All {{the girls}} except me had now got their {{accustomed}} rap, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> {{better than to}} hope I should escape.|$|R
60|$|The {{young man}} smiled faintly. The {{policeman}} answered me civilly, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> {{at once that}} I had made a mistake.|$|R
60|$|There {{was silence}} for a moment, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> already what Fowler was going to say. I could feel it coming.|$|R
500|$|On December 7, 2011, the Red Hot Chili Peppers were {{announced}} as 2012 inductees to the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame. Slovak's brother James accepted the award {{on his behalf}} and gave a speech honoring his brother. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Kiedis expressed his excitement with Slovak's induction, explaining [...] "He's a beautiful person that picked up a guitar in the 1970s and didn't {{make it out of}} the 1980s, and he is getting honored for his beauty". [...] Flea echoed those comments on the same day: [...] "Hillel grew up loving rock and roll so much, he hasn't been here for some time, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> how much it would mean to him. It's a powerful thing." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{conceived}} it in 2001 and NBC ordered 13 episodes {{the following}} year; the show's original pilot used a single-camera setup but NBC executives {{felt it would}} have more appeal as a multiple-camera setup, so it was re-shot. Appel noted of the show: [...] "There's a sense sometimes in Hollywood that writers and producers who come from animated shows maybe have something to prove to justify their credibility as live-action show-runners or writers. My own experience has been fortunate. I haven't felt that. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> it exists." [...] The show was not acclaimed: Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said it was [...] "too cartoonish to work." [...] Appel then wrote {{and worked as a}} co-executive producer on The Bernie Mac Show and Kitchen Confidential, and appeared as Josh in the 2004 film I ♥ Huckabees.|$|E
500|$|In {{preparation}} for the 2010 Winter Olympics, Ohno lost over 9kilograms (20 pounds) of weight from when he appeared at the 2002 Winter Games. [...] He went down to a 65.7kg (145lb) bodyframe and a 2.5% Body fat percentage enduring a 5-month 3-a-day training program combined with a strict nutritional program. [...] As a result, he could lift double the weight he could before the training. [...] With respect to his training regimen, Ohno said: [...] "Come these Games, there's no one who's going to be fitter than me. There's just no way. Whether I can put it together on the ice or not and feel good, that's a different story. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> from a physical training standpoint, nobody's even close... I've never prepared like this in my life — for anything. [...] I want to leave nothing on the table." ...|$|E
6000|$|HESTER. <b>I</b> didn't <b>know</b> you {{had heard}} it. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> {{you would agree}} with me. A woman who has sinned should be punished, shouldn't she? ...|$|R
