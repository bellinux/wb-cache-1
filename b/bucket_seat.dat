25|$|Every spectator has an {{individual}} <b>bucket</b> <b>seat.</b> There are no pillars obstructing {{views of the}} ground. Two giant LED screens – the biggest in India – provide scores, replays and other information.|$|E
25|$|The <b>bucket</b> <b>seat</b> option {{introduced}} on Electra 225 convertibles in 1959 was {{now available}} on Electra coupes and included a center consolette with storage compartment. Standard Electra features included windshield wipers, trip mileage indicator, cigar lighter, dual sunshades, Step-On parking brake, dual horns, a single-key locking system, Twin-Turbine automatic transmission, Foamtex seat cushions, electric clock, trunk light, license plate frames, glovebox light, power steering and power brakes.

5000|$|<b>Bucket</b> <b>seats</b> {{are also}} used in {{passenger}} vans and minivans, although they are not always referred to as such. Unlike those in cars, <b>bucket</b> <b>seats</b> in vans can be configured in different ways or even removed for more cargo storage. In the typical minivan configuration, the front and middle rows have two <b>bucket</b> <b>seats</b> each, while the third-row seat has a three-person bench, {{for a total of}} seven passengers. Honda Odyssey 2005-2010 models (except for the base trim) adds a stowable [...] "PlusOneSeat" [...] between the middle row <b>bucket</b> <b>seats.</b> The Australian Mazda MPV has three seats in the middle and two in the last row.|$|R
50|$|Interior trim was {{relatively}} unchanged from 1971 {{other than the}} availability of all-vinyl upholstery with the standard bench seat {{in addition to the}} optional Strato <b>bucket</b> <b>seats.</b> Cloth interiors were also offered with both bench and <b>bucket</b> <b>seats.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Inside, the four-place {{cabin with}} {{front and rear}} <b>bucket</b> <b>seats</b> and center console was {{replaced}} by a choice of <b>bucket</b> <b>seats</b> or conventional bench seats as standard equipment, making the Riviera a full six-passenger car for the first time. Optionally available was a Strato-bench seat with armrest or Strato <b>bucket</b> <b>seats</b> with either a short consolette or a full-length operating console with a [...] "horseshoe" [...] shaped floor shifter and storage compartment. Both the <b>buckets</b> and Strato-bench <b>seat</b> were available with a reclining seat option for the passenger's side. Sales for 1966 rebounded to 45,308, a new record.|$|R
25|$|The V-1 was {{transformed}} into the Reichenberg by adding a small, cramped cockpit {{at the point of}} the fuselage that was immediately ahead of the pulsejet's intake, where the standard V-1's compressed-air cylinders were fitted. The cockpit had basic flight instruments and a plywood <b>bucket</b> <b>seat.</b> The single-piece canopy incorporated an armoured front panel and opened to the side to allow entry. The two displaced compressed-air cylinders were replaced by a single one, fitted in the rear in the space which normally accommodated the V-1's autopilot. The wings were fitted with hardened edges to cut the cables of barrage balloons. The broader-chord forward support pylon for the Argus pulsejet, by co-incidence, resembles the same airframe component used on the American clone of the unmanned V-1, the Republic-Ford JB-2 Loon.|$|E
25|$|For 2010, {{the last}} year of {{production}} for the PT Cruiser, there was only one trim level available: the PT Cruiser Classic.

500|$|... "Behemoth's three open-air {{steel and}} {{fiberglass}} trains feature a prototype v-shaped staggered seating arrangement to ensure an unobstructed view for every rider." [...] This prototype design {{is a first}} for Bolliger & Mabillard roller coasters which was later reproduced for Diamondback at Kings Island, Intimidator at Carowinds and [...] at PortAventura. The trains are named Red Train, Orange Train, and Yellow Train, after their coloured fronts. Each of the trains comprise eight cars, seating four guests each for a total capacity of 32.

50|$|In 2005, the Cork County Board {{replaced}} all wood bench <b>seats</b> {{with plastic}} <b>bucket</b> <b>seats</b> in the covered and open stands. Due {{to the shape}} of the new <b>bucket</b> <b>seats,</b> overall legroom was reduced, with many complaining of being unable to sit in the seat entirely. In response, the tops were cut off the back of each seat, marginally improving legroom.|$|R
2500|$|... 1974 Valiant {{was also}} {{available}} in a [...] "Scamp Package" [...] which included 318 V8 engine, four door, 3 speed automatic transmission, power steering, power disc brakes, chrome trim, vinyl roof, AC, carpet, split vinyl <b>bucket</b> <b>seat</b> bench, radio, rear window defroster blower, and 120mph speedometer standard. [...] Production was limited and ordered as customers requested the package, a few hundred were produced.|$|E
2500|$|Inside, {{numerous}} [...] "downscalings" [...] were evident. [...] A conventional fixed {{rear seat}} replaced the folding <b>bucket</b> <b>seat</b> design. The conventional trunk area included a vinyl mat, {{rather than the}} previous model's carpeted cargo area. The center console in the front remained, {{but there was no}} center armrest. The tachometer was now optional instead of standard and the electroluminescent gauges disappeared in favor of a conventional design.|$|E
2500|$|The new {{hatchback}} {{was available}} with a Levis <b>bucket</b> <b>seat</b> interior trim option {{that was actually}} made of spun nylon fabric, rather than real cotton denim, to comply with flammability standards as well as offer greater wear and stain resistance.

5000|$|For decades, American {{cars were}} {{typically}} equipped with bench seats, which permitted three-passenger seating. As European cars became {{more accessible to}} Americans following World War II, <b>bucket</b> <b>seats</b> became the symbol of sport and luxury. <b>Bucket</b> <b>seats</b> then spread to American manufacturers, beginning as [...] "sporty trim packages" [...] in the late 1950s and later coming as a standard feature.|$|R
5000|$|The 70th Anniversary Edition, {{offered only}} for 2011, added unique alloy wheels, unique 70th Anniversary Edition emblems on both front doors, unique leather-trimmed seating {{surfaces}} available in two unique color schemes, a touch-screen sound system, a premium eight-speaker sound system with subwoofer from Infinity, heated front <b>bucket</b> <b>seats,</b> and dual power front <b>bucket</b> <b>seats</b> to the [...] "up-level" [...] Limited trim level.|$|R

2500|$|... 1997: An upscale, [...] "fully loaded" [...] {{version of}} the Eighty-Eight was {{introduced}} as the Oldsmobile Regency to satisfy previous Ninety-Eight buyers. All Oldsmobile Eighty Eight and LSS models (except for the Regency) changed badges from the '80s Oldsmobile [...] "Rocket" [...] logo to the 1997–2004 Oldsmobile [...] "Rocket Oval" [...] logo, inspired by the Aurora's logo. The center console on <b>bucket</b> <b>seat</b> cars was also redesigned to fit up against {{the lower part of}} the dash, allowed for rear passenger vents, and 2 cupholders for front the occupants.|$|E
2500|$|Chassis {{preparation}} included heavy-duty {{front and}} rear springs (part of the factory's optional handling package), rear spring traction control arms, heavy-duty shock absorbers and a [...] "panhard" [...] type track bar in the rear to eliminate side sway. Stock wheels and tires were replaced by wide magnesium racing wheels and Goodyear racing tires. The cars were aerodynamically modified: the front ends were lowered, the hoods were slanted down and spoilers were installed below the front bumpers. The car interiors had structure-stiffening roll cages for driver protection, a stock <b>bucket</b> <b>seat</b> modified for additional support, and supplementary engine-monitoring instruments.|$|E
2500|$|TRD Griffon Concept is {{a version}} of GT86 {{designed}} specifically for track driving, created by Toyota Racing Development.

50|$|The client {{can also}} choose to include manual {{adjustable}} race mirrors, racing <b>bucket</b> <b>seats</b> and restraints.|$|R
25|$|The GTO {{option was}} {{available}} in both the base Ventura and Ventura Custom lines as either a two-door sedan or hatchback coupé. The base Ventura interior consisted of bench seats and rubber floor mats, <b>Bucket</b> <b>seats</b> could be added for $132 (Code A51), while the Ventura Custom had upgraded bench seats or optional Strato <b>bucket</b> <b>seats</b> along with carpeting, cushioned steering wheel, and custom pedal trim.|$|R
2500|$|For 1975, the Century GS, or [...] "gran sport" [...] entered {{its third}} and final year on the Colonnade body. It {{was reduced to a}} mere appearance/handling package as the 455/Stage I options were {{discontinued}} and Buick's revived 231 cubic-inch V6 was the standard engine, mated to a standard three-speed manual transmission or optional Turbo Hydra-matic. The only optional engines were two 350 V8s, a two-barrel 155 horsepower version or the four-barrel option rated at 175 horsepower and offered only with the Turbo Hydra-matic. Both engines were also mated to catalytic converters {{for the first time this}} year, which mandated the use of unleaded gasoline and precluded the availability of true dual exhaust systems. Radial tires were now standard equipment and the Strato <b>bucket</b> <b>seat</b> option reverted to the non-reclining version.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{minor changes}} and {{revisions}} marked the 1984 Grand Prix, including {{the return of}} the octagonal Pontiac hood ornament (which originally debuted in 1976), gauges with orange needles and red markings (previous 1978–1983 Grand Prix gauges had white needles), a T-shaped console shifter, an updated <b>bucket</b> <b>seat</b> design, as well as a woodgrain plate above the glove box (previous 1978–1983 Grand Prixs used a black plate). A new optional four spoke steering wheel was also available. The base and Brougham models continued as before but the LJ was replaced by a new LE model. Same engines continued as before including the Buick [...] V6, Chevy [...] V8 and Olds [...] Diesel V8≈. A new option this year was the Turbo Hydra-Matic 200-4R four-speed overdrive automatic available with the 305 V8 for improved highway gas mileage.|$|E

5000|$|Although rear seating in {{automobiles}} largely utilizes bench seats, some 2+2 {{cars have}} <b>bucket</b> <b>seats</b> in the rear. Long-wheelbase variants of full-size luxury cars, {{such as the}} Lexus LS 460L have an [...] "executive seating package" [...] option that reduces the rear to two passengers but provides them with more amenities. The Porsche Panamera offers only <b>bucket</b> <b>seats</b> as the rear configuration despite its large size.|$|R
5000|$|The 60th Anniversary Edition was {{manufactured}} {{to commemorate}} Jeep's 60th anniversary in 2001. It added these features to the luxurious Limited trim level: unique seventeen-inch (17") [...] "Rogue" [...] chrome-plated alloy wheels, '60th Anniversary Edition' emblems on both upper front fenders, heated front <b>bucket</b> <b>seats,</b> a power sunroof, an A/M-F/M stereo with cassette and CD players, a matching spare wheel, and '60th Anniversary Edition'-embroidered front <b>bucket</b> <b>seats.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Kübelwagen is an {{abbreviation}} of Kübelsitzwagen, meaning [...] "bucket-seat car" [...] {{because all}} German light military vehicles {{that had no}} doors were fitted with <b>bucket</b> <b>seats</b> to prevent passengers from falling out. The first VW test vehicles had no doors and were therefore fitted with <b>bucket</b> <b>seats,</b> so acquiring the name VW Kübelsitzwagen that was later shortened to Kübelwagen. Mercedes, Opel and Tatra also built Kübel(sitz)wagens.|$|R

2500|$|The base Model J {{underwent}} {{a number of}} content changes to cut the base price by around $500 to be more competitive with other mid-sized personal luxury cars. Those changes for the [...] "J" [...] included a smaller [...] V8 as the base powerplant and some downgrading of interior trim that included a new notchback bench seat made standard equipment and the Strato bucket seats/console became optional. Features such as a cushioned steering wheel and custom pedal trim plates became optional on Model J, but remained standard on LJ and SJ, both of which also continued to include Strato <b>bucket</b> <b>seats</b> as standard equipment. All models got a new simulated rosewood trim for the dash, door panels and console (with <b>bucket</b> <b>seats)</b> that replaced the African Crossfire Mahogany trim of previous years. Upholstery choices included cloth or Morrokide vinyl bench or <b>bucket</b> <b>seats</b> on the Model J, velour buckets on the LJ or Morrokide buckets on the SJ. Leather interior trim was a new extra-cost option available with the Strato <b>bucket</b> <b>seats</b> and LJ and SJ models.|$|R
