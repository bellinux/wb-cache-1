50|$|A camera {{trapping}} {{survey was}} carried out here in 1999, led by Wan Shaharuddin of the Department of Wildlife and National Parks (as part of the Tiger Research Unit) and discovered a range of species including the marbled cat, leopard cat, asian golden cat, muntjac, malay civet, masked palm civet, common porcupine, brush-tailed porcupine, pangolin, sun bear, wild boar, <b>banded</b> <b>linsang,</b> short-tailed macaque (probably meaning the pig-tailed macaque) and wild dog (probably dhole). Despite being connected to the larger Cameron Highlands forest complex there were no tigers detected, which {{could be due to}} the relatively low sampling effort (just 575 camera trap nights).|$|E
50|$|The {{spotted linsang}} resembles the <b>banded</b> <b>linsang</b> in its long, slender body, short limbs, {{elongated}} neck and head, and long tail. The ground colour ranges from dusky brown to light buff. Two long stripes extend {{from behind the}} ears to the shoulders or beyond, and two shorter stripes run along the neck. Three to four longitudinal rows of spots adorn the back, their size decreasing towards the belly. The fore legs are spotted to the paw, the hind legs to the hock. The cylindrical tail has eight or nine broad dark rings, separated by narrow white rings. The feet have five digits, and the area between the pads is covered with hair. The claws are retractile, claw sheath are present on the fore paws, but the hind-paws have protective lobes of skin.It weighs about 1 lb and measures in length from 14 - 15 in, and the tail 12 - 13 in. Its height is about 5 - 5.5 in, the girth of its chest 5.75 in, and length of head to the occiput about 3 in.|$|E
40|$|Halimun Salak Mount National Park {{has many}} {{ecosystem}} and habitat types that support rare and endemic species including mammals. This study aimed {{to reveal the}} diversity of mammals in the national park using camera trap and direct observation, setting of live trap, mist net, identification of foot print.   A total of 23 mammals’ species (11 species were recorded  using camera trap) in this study. Based on the capture rate, the highest abundance of mammals was muncak deer (Muntiacus munjak) of 31. 25 % with an encounter rate of 34. 37 photos/ 100 day, while the lowest was malaysian wood rat (Rattus tiomanicus), treeshrew (Tupaia javanica), plantain squirrel (Callosciurus notatus), malay badger (Mydaus javanensis), leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis), and <b>banded</b> <b>linsang</b> (Prionodon linsang) each has 3. 12 %.   Keyword: camera trap, encounter rate, mamals’abundance </p...|$|E
