2500|$|Part VI of the {{decision}} discussed whether the statute impermissibly targeted the Communist Party as the sole political party seeking the violent overthrow of the United States government. If the statute had penalized anyone who advocated violent overthrow of the government, Vinson held, there would be new constitutional doubts raised. But it was the Court's long-held tenet that statutes should be construed constitutionally wherever possible. Subsequently, Vinson interpreted Section 9(h) narrowly as barring from union office those who actually advocated overthrow {{of the government and}} not those who (for example) believed it would happen without their assistance. Vinson reiterated that the balancing of interests in Part V had found the infringement on free speech pemissible. <b>But</b> <b>how</b> <b>did</b> this reconcile with Reynolds v. United States? [...] Because, Vinson said, [...] "Insofar as a distinction between beliefs and political affiliations is based upon absence of any 'overt act' ... the act of joining the Party is crucial. ... courts and juries every day pass upon knowledge, belief and intent—the state of men's minds—having before them no more than evidence of their words and conduct, from which, in ordinary human experience, mental condition may be inferred." ...|$|E
