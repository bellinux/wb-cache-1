50|$|Many {{studies on}} {{mindfulness}} meditation, assessed {{in a review}} by Cahn and Polich in 2006, have linked lower frequency alpha waves, as well as theta waves, to meditation.

Alpha blocking is a phenomenon where the active brain, normally presenting <b>beta</b> <b>wave</b> activity, cannot as easily switch to alpha wave activity often involved in memory recall. These findings would suggest that in a meditative state a person is more relaxed but maintains a sharp awareness.

40|$|Previous {{studies in}} {{non-human}} primates (NHPs) {{have shown that}} beta oscillations (15 â€“ 30 Hz) of local field potentials (LFPs) in the arm/hand areas of primary motor cortex (MI) propagate as traveling waves across the cortex. These waves exhibited two stereotypical features across animals and tasks: (1) The waves propagated in two dominant modal directions roughly 180 Â° apart, and (2) their propagation speed ranged from 10 to 35 cm/s. It is, however, unknown if such cortical waves occur in the human motor cortex. This study shows that the two properties of propagating <b>beta</b> <b>waves</b> are present in MI of a tetraplegic human patient while he was instructed to perform an instruction delay center-out task using a cursor controlled by the chin. Moreover, we show that <b>beta</b> <b>waves</b> are sustained and have similar properties whether the subject was engaged in the task or at rest. The directions of the successive sustained waves both in the human subject and a NHP subject tended to switch from one dominant mode to the other, and {{at least in the}} NHP subject the estimated distance traveled between successive waves traveling {{into and out of the}} central sulcus is consistent with the hypothesis of wave reflection between the border of motor and somatosensory cortices. Further, we show that the occurrence of the <b>beta</b> <b>waves</b> is not uniquely tied to periods of increased power in the beta frequency band. These results demonstrate that traveling <b>beta</b> <b>waves</b> in MI are a general phenomenon occurring in human as well as NHPs. Consistent with the NHP data, the dominant directions of the <b>beta</b> LFP <b>waves</b> in human aligned to the proximal to distal gradient of joint representations in MI somatotopy. This consistent finding of wave propagation may imply the existence of a hardwired organization of motor cortex that mediates this spatiotemporal pattern...|$|R
