5|$|The whale ear has {{specific}} {{adaptations to}} the marine environment. In humans, {{the middle ear}} works as an impedance equalizer between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. In whales, and other marine mammals, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, whales receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The whale ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allow for greater directional hearing underwater. Odontocetes send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. The melon size varies between species, the <b>bigger</b> <b>the</b> more dependent they are of it. A beaked whale for example has a small bulge {{sitting on top of}} its skull, whereas a sperm whale's head is filled up mainly with the melon.|$|E

25|$|Dr. David C. Lane {{proposes a}} {{checklist}} consisting of seven points to assess gurus in his book, Exposing Cults: When the Skeptical Mind Confronts the Mystical. One of his points is that spiritual teachers should have {{high standards of}} moral conduct and that followers of gurus should interpret {{the behavior of a}} spiritual teacher by following Ockham's razor and by using common sense, and, should not naively use mystical explanations unnecessarily to explain immoral behavior. Another point Lane makes is that the <b>bigger</b> <b>the</b> claim a guru makes, such as the claim to be God, the <b>bigger</b> <b>the</b> chance is that the guru is unreliable. Dr. Lane's fifth point is that self-proclaimed gurus {{are likely to be more}} unreliable than gurus with a legitimate lineage.|$|E

25|$|As {{the fascination}} with six-day races {{spread across the}} Atlantic from its origins in the United Kingdom, their appeal to base {{instincts}} attracted large crowds.

An estimated crowd of 6,000 spectators attended the final day of the Madison Square Garden races in December 1896.

25|$|Ophthalmopatic {{findings}} {{are more common}} but less severe in children (severe infiltrative exophthalmos is virtually unknown before mid-adolescence), but besides that, many of the typical clinical features of hyperthyroidism {{in children and adolescents}} are similar to those in adults. An important difference between children and adults with Graves' disease, is that children have not yet developed like adults have (psychological and physiological), and that they are a lot more dependent on their environment. The encephalopathy will have profound effects on children's developing personalities and developing relationship with their environment. Disturbments in bodily development further complicates matters. The consequences for the development and the somatic and psychological wellbeing of the child can be very radical and sometimes irreversible. The earlier a person is affected by thyroid disease, the more the development of personality is affected and the <b>bigger</b> <b>the</b> delay from their potential development level. The child gets behind in its cognitive, emotional and sexual growth, which, by itself, also influences its processing abilities of the endocrine disease.|$|E
25|$|The city of Basel and {{the city}} of Zürich have a long-standing rivalry. Therefore, FCB's most {{traditional}} and fiercest rivals are Grasshopper Club Zürich and FC Zürich. In the past few seasons, the rivalry between FC Zürich and Basel has been fueled by Zürich's narrow league championship wins over Basel. Supporters from both sides have caused trouble in the past years, with the worst incident happening in May 2006. Basel had won the league in 2003–04 and 2004–05 and were set to make it three in a row if they won or drew against Zürich at home {{on the last day of}} the 2005–06 season. Zürich took the lead after a late goal from Iulian Filipescu and consequently won the match and the league. After the final whistle, players and fans from both teams started fighting on the pitch and in the stands. This incident has fueled hatred and bitterness between fans from FC Zürich and FC Basel. There is controversy about which rivalry is <b>bigger,</b> <b>the</b> one with Grasshopper or FC Zürich, but it usually depends on the success of these teams.|$|E
