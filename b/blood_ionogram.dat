40|$|Se valoran los resultados del comportamiento endocrino-metabólico en 40 pacientes con fracturas del tercio medio facial: 10 nasales, 20 maxilomalares, 2 Lefort I, 4 Lefort II y 4 Lefort III. Según el sexo, 34 pacientes correspondieron al sexo masculino y 6 al femenino. Cuantificamos en orina (muestras de 24 horas) : cloruro, sodio, potasio, urea y creatinina; en el ionograma en sangre: cloro, sodio, y potasio; en la química sanguínea: glucosa, clacio, fósforo, urea y creatinina y hemograma con diferencial. Estas muestras se cuantificaron al llegar el paciente, a las 72 horas y a las 24 horas del posoperatorio inmediato. En todos los pacientes estudiados se mantuvo la estabilidad endocrino-metabólica, con excepción de aquéllos portadores de Lefort I, II y III, los cuales en la última muestra tomada presentaron alteraciones del sodio y potasio en el ionograma de orina y sangre. The {{results of}} the {{endocrine}} and metabolic behaviour in 40 patient with fractures of the medial facial third: 10 nasal, 20 maxillomalar, 2 Lefort I, 4 Lefort II, and 4 Lefort III, are evaluated. 34 patients were males and 6 females. Chloride, sodium, potassium, urea, and creatinine were cuantified in urine (24 -hour samples); chlorine, sodium, and potassium in blood ionogram; glucose, calcium, phosphorus, urea, creatinine, and differential blood count in blood chemistry. These samples were taken 72 hours and 24 hours after the immediate postoperative. All the patients studied mantained the endocrine and metabolic stability except those with Leford I, II and III, who in the last sample taken presented alterations of sodium and potassium in the urine and <b>blood</b> <b>ionogram...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: {{diabetic}} ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic {{state are}} two of the major metabolic emergencies that may occur. These conditions are not always treated properly. Objective: to describe the metabolic hyperglycemic emergencies in diabetic patients treated in the Intensive Care Unit, and to assess the use of sodium bicarbonate. Methods: a descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted including 52 patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of the Enrique Cabrera Hospital from 2000 through 2007. The following variables were analyzed: type of diabetes mellitus, type of acute complication, use or not of sodium bicarbonate, <b>blood</b> gases, <b>ionogram</b> and progress of patients. Kitabchi criteria were used for the diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis and its severity and for the diagnosis of the hyperglycemic state as well. Criteria proposed by an Expert Committee of the American Diabetes Association and a World Health Organization Expert Committee were adopted for the diagnosis of diabetes and its classification. Results: diabetic ketoacidosis was confirmed in 57, 5 % of type 1 diabetic patients and in 42, 5 % of those with type 2 diabetes. Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic state was observed in 23, 0 % of type 2 diabetics. There was not any death among patients with diabetic ketoacidosis who did not use sodium bicarbonate whereas 80, 0 % of patients with hyperglycemic state who used it died. Conclusions : diabetic ketoacidosis was the most common complication. Mortality due to ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic state was high. Sodium bicarbonate was not properly used. </p...|$|R
40|$|The design {{concept and}} first in vitro and in vivo {{results of a}} {{long-term}} implantable ventricular assist device system based on a microaxial blood pump are presented. The blood-immersed parts of the pump consist of a single-stage impeller and a proximally integrated microelectric motor. Both parts are surrounded by a pump housing currently made of polycarbonate to allow visible access to the blood-exposed parts. A titanium inflow cage attached {{to the tip of}} the housing is directly implanted into the left ventricular apex. The outflow of the pump is connected to the descending aorta by means of an e-PTFE graft. The overall dimensions of the device are 12 mm in outer diameter and about 50 mm in length. The calculated lifetime of the device is up to 2 years. The system underwent long-term durability tests, hydraulic performance tests, dynamic stability tests, and in vitro hemolysis and thrombogenicity tests. Furthermore, animal tests have been performed in adult Dorset sheep. In a first series, the pump has been placed extracorporeally; in a second series, the pump was completely implanted. Mean duration of the animal experiments of the second series was 31 days (range 8 - 110 days, n= 14); no anticoagulation was administered over the whole test period. Blood data revealed no significant changes in <b>blood</b> cell counts, <b>ionogram,</b> or any other value. No end-organ dysfunction induced by long-term support could be observed, nor did the pathology reveal any evidence of thromboembolic complications. status: publishe...|$|R
