5|$|In the 20th century, {{a legendary}} doll maker named Rozen created seven <b>bisque</b> dolls which were powered and given sentience with a gem called Rosa Mystica. Since then, Rozen sent the dolls away to find masters and to battle among {{themselves}} to gather each other's Rosa Mysticas; this competition {{is referred to}} as the Alice Game. When a doll obtains all seven, they are to become a perfect doll dubbed as Alice and will be reunited with Rozen. By order of creation, the seven Rozen Maidens are named Suigintou, Kanaria, Suiseiseki, Souseiseki, Shinku, Hinaichigo, and Kirakisho.|$|E

She exhibited interest in the arts at an early age, and sought a career as an illustrator in New York City at age fifteen. Her Kewpie cartoons, which made their debut in a 1909 issue of Ladies' Home Journal, were later manufactured as <b>bisque</b> dolls in 1912 by J. D. Kestner, a German toy company, followed by composition material and celluloid versions. The dolls were wildly popular {{in the early twentieth}} century, and are considered {{to be one of the}} first mass-marketed toys in the United States.|$|E

25|$|A doll is a {{model of}} a human (often a baby), a {{humanoid}} (like Bert and Ernie), or an animal. Modern dolls are often made of cloth or plastic. Other materials that are, or have been, used in the manufacture of dolls include cornhusks, bone, stone, wood, porcelain (sometimes called china), <b>bisque,</b> celluloid, wax, and even apples. Often people will make dolls out of whatever materials are available to them.|$|E

25|$|Terra sigillata {{is usually}} brushed or sprayed in thin layers onto dry or almost dry unfired ware. The ware is then quickly {{burnished}} {{with a soft}} cloth before {{the water in the}} terra sigillata soaks into the porous body. The burnished ware is allowed to dry again to remove the added moisture and biscuit fired, often fired to a lower than normal <b>bisque</b> temperature of approximately 900°C. Higher firing temperatures tend to remove the burnished effect in the clay surface.|$|E
25|$|A meal often {{consists}} of three courses, hors d'œuvre or entrée (introductory course, sometimes soup), plat principal (main course), fromage (cheese course) and/or dessert, sometimes with a salad offered before the cheese or dessert. Hors d'œuvres include terrine de saumon au basilic, lobster <b>bisque,</b> foie gras, French onion soup or a croque monsieur. The plat principal could include a pot au feu or steak frites. The dessert could be mille-feuille pastry, a macaron, an éclair, crème brûlée, mousse au chocolat, crêpes, or Café liégeois.|$|E
25|$|The {{memorial}} also {{opened its}} grounds to archeological digs in 1994. Estimates of human occupation on Shooter's Hill go {{back as far}} as 3,000 BC. Shooter's Hill had been occupied by Native Americans, a mansion (in the 1830s and 1840s), a log cabin, Fort Ellsworth, a reservoir for the city's fresh water system, a park for outdoor dancing, and the Alexandria Golf Course among many others. Alexandria city archeologists used ground-penetrating radar to help identify sites of interest on Shooter's Hill, including a brick foundation wall. In the dig's first three seasons, a stone ax, pieces of ceramic pots, Civil War ammunition, various kinds of colored glass, a piece of jewelry shaped like a scarab, a Colonial-era mug imported from England, Native American spear points, a silver-plated spoon, a stoneware jar, and the <b>bisque</b> heads of dolls manufactured in Germany were found. In 2002, the memorial opened an exhibit designed to showcase some of the archeological evidence unearthed on the memorial grounds.|$|E

50|$|Traditionally, soups are {{classified}} into two main groups: clear soups and thick soups. The established French classifications of clear soups are bouillon and consommé. Thick soups {{are classified}} {{depending upon the}} type of thickening agent used: <b>bisques</b> are made from puréed shellfish or vegetables thickened with cream; cream soups may be thickened with béchamel sauce; and veloutés are thickened with eggs, butter, and cream. Other ingredients commonly used to thicken soups and broths include rice, lentils, flour, and grains; many popular soups also include carrots and potatoes.|$|R

5000|$|In the US, {{the first}} [...] {{cookbook}} {{was published by}} William Parks in Williamsburg, Virginia, in 1742, based on Eliza Smith's The Compleat Housewife; or Accomplished Gentlewoman's Companion, and it included several recipes for soups and <b>bisques.</b> A 1772 cookbook, The Frugal Housewife, contained an entire chapter on the topic. English cooking dominated early colonial cooking; but as new immigrants arrived from other countries, other national soups gained popularity. In particular, German immigrants living in Pennsylvania were famous for their potato soups. In 1794, Jean Baptiste Gilbert Payplat dis Julien, a refugee from the French Revolution, opened an eating establishment in Boston called [...] "The Restorator", and {{became known as the}} [...] "Prince of Soups". The first American cooking pamphlet dedicated to soup recipes was written in 1882 by Emma Ewing: Soups and Soup Making.|$|R
50|$|Born near Louisville, Kentucky, Fox {{started his}} career as a {{reporter}} and part-time cartoonist for the Louisville Herald. He spent two years in higher education at Indiana University, Bloomington; nevertheless, he continued sketching one cartoon a day for the Louisville Herald. After two years of college, he abandoned his studies in favor of his true calling, writing and illustrating comics. From 1908, Fox started a series of daily cartoons about kids for the Chicago Evening Post. His panel was noted by the Wheeler Syndicate, which started distributing his work nationwide, this eventually led to the creation and distribution of Toonerville Folks. The panel, which expanded its circulation from a few papers to hundreds between 1915 and the mid-1920s, spawned several merchandising efforts, including cartoon books, cracker boxes, magic picture folders, paper masks, gum wrappers, <b>bisques</b> and cutout sheets.|$|R
50|$|Crustaceans and mollusks {{are also}} an {{essential}} {{ingredient in the}} regional cookery. Maine is noted for harvesting peekytoe crab and Jonah crab and making crab <b>bisques,</b> based on cream with 35% milkfat, and crabcakes out of them, and often they appear on the menu {{as far south as}} to be out of region in New York City, where they are sold to four star restaurants. Squid are heavily fished for and eaten as fried calamari, and often are an ingredient in Italian American cooking in this region. Whelks are eaten in salad, and most famous of all is the lobster, which is indigenous to the coastal waters of the region and are a feature of many dishes, baked, boiled, roasted, and steamed, or simply eaten as a sandwich, chilled with mayonnaise and chopped celery in Maine and Massachusetts, or slathered with melted butter on Long Island and in Connecticut.|$|R
2500|$|Typically {{the body}} is first fired in a kiln to convert it into a hard porous <b>bisque.</b> Underglaze {{decoration}} may then be applied, followed by glaze, which is fired so it bonds to the body. The glazed porcelain may then be painted with overglaze decoration and fired again to bond the paint with the glaze. Most pieces use only one of underglaze or overglaze painting, the latter often being referred to as [...] "enamelled". Decorations may be applied by brush or by stenciling, transfer printing, lithography and screen printing.|$|E
2500|$|Gladding, McBean & Co.’s ware {{would be}} {{produced}} in a new patented earthenware clay body known as Malinite. Dr. Andrew Malinovsky developed the high talc one-fire body using an amorphous flux in 1928 for Gladding, McBean & Co. Malinite was developed {{for use in the}} production of one-fire clay tile; however the company made the decision to use Malinite for their dinnerware production. By using the Malinite and adjusting the kiln temperature for a one fire process, the company solved the crazing problem in their own product. Glaze was applied to the unfired body, and the glaze and body matured together in the kiln, saving the company the time and expense of separate <b>bisque</b> firing for the body. [...] For the new line of pottery, Gladding, McBean & Co. decided to use Prouty tunnel kilns. The Prouty tunnel kiln patents were acquired in the purchase of the West Coast holdings of the American Encaustic Tiling Company in 1933. Prouty tunnel kilns allowed for the continuous flow of ware through the kiln to fire pottery. Thus the plant “combined mills, jiggering units, conveyors, dryers and kilns into a model of straight line output.” ...|$|E

50|$|In Ceramics and Print, Paul Scott {{explains}} Lehman's {{contribution to}} saggar-firing:The Swedish ceramist Herman Fogelin {{has referred to}} the kiln {{as a sort of}} washing machine. Gerry Caplan and others use it as a printing press, imparting color and other unique qualities. The kiln, in generating heat, can facilitate either the transfer of color from one body to another, or causes a print by reducing clay and carbonizing matter.... Dick Lehman’s carbon film transfers on sagger-fired porcelain using the same basic chemical principles as Caplan's, but in this case the materials, process and intention are different…The sagger is...closed with a lid. In the firing a receding (or anaerobic - no oxygen) atmosphere is created inside the sagger, and the vegetation turns into activated charcoal, in the process releasing a film of carbon which the <b>bisqued</b> porcelain absorbs, capturing the image released by the vegetation.|$|R
50|$|Pottery {{is made by}} a {{blend of}} clays, fillers and fluxes being fused {{together}} during the firing process. There are high fire clays and glazes which are heated to over 1200 °C (2200 °F) and are extremely resistant to fading, staining, burning, scratching and acid attack. Low fire clays, fired below 1200 °C, most often used by large commercial manufacturers and third world producers, while durable, are susceptible to scratching and wear over time. The clay body is first <b>bisqued</b> to about 1000 °C (1900 °F). In the second firing a white or coloured glaze is applied and is melted by heat which chemically and physically fuses the glass (glaze) to the clay body during the same firing process. Due to the firing process and natural clays used, it is normal for the product to vary in size and shape, and +/- 5mm is normal.|$|R

The show {{became the}} most {{successful}} all-black show ever staged on Broadway {{at that time and}} made Hall and Bojangles into household names. Blackbirds of 1928 was the idea of impresario Lew Leslie, who planned to build the show around Florence Mills in New York after her success in the hit London show Blackbirds but Mills died of pneumonia in 1927 before rehearsals commenced. Hall was chosen to replace her. The revue opened at Les Ambassadeurs Club in New York in January 1928, under the name Blackbird Revue, but it was renamed Blackbirds of 1928 and in May 1928 transferred to Broadway's Liberty Theatre, where it ran for 518 performances.

Her mother was so incensed when she went to see the show by her daughter performing what she termed <b>'risqué</b> dance moves', she tried to stop the show during Adelaide's performance and banned her from appearing in any future performances. The ban only remained for one performance and Adelaide returned triumphantly to her role the following day. It was reported in the press of the day that the show's producer Lew Leslie was so concerned about race violence connected with the controversy surrounding Adelaide's performance that he took out a hefty insurance policy to cover the cast; the most heavily insured were the principals, Adelaide Hall and [...] "Bojangles" [...] Robinson.|$|R
