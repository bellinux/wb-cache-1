500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the controversy, Cotton continued a dialogue with some of those who had gone to Aquidneck Island (called Rhode Island at the time). [...] One of these correspondents was his friend from Lincolnshire William Coddington. [...] Coddington wrote {{that he and his wife}} had heard that Cotton's preaching had changed dramatically since the controversy ended: [...] "if we had not knowne what he had holden forth <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> not how to understand him." [...] Coddington then deflected Cotton's suggestions that he reform some of his own ideas and [...] "errors in judgment". [...] In 1640, the Boston church sent some messengers to Aquidneck, but they were poorly received. [...] Young Francis Hutchinson, a son of Anne, attempted to withdraw his membership from the Boston church, but his request was denied by Cotton.|$|E
500|$|The {{evolution}} of baseball from older bat-and-ball games {{is difficult to}} trace with precision. A French manuscript from 1344 contains an illustration of clerics playing a game, possibly la soule, with similarities to baseball. Other old French games such as thèque, la balle au bâton, and la balle empoisonnée also appear to be related. Consensus once held that today's baseball is a North American development from the older game rounders, popular in Great Britain and Ireland. Baseball <b>Before</b> <b>We</b> <b>Knew</b> It: A Search for the Roots of the Game (2005), by David Block, suggests that the game originated in England; recently uncovered historical evidence supports this position. Block argues that rounders and early baseball were actually regional variants of each other, and that the game's most direct antecedents are the English games of stoolball and [...] "tut-ball". It has long been believed that cricket also descended from such games, though evidence uncovered in early 2009 suggests that cricket may have been imported to England from Flanders.|$|E
500|$|During {{the second}} season, HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall called Ron [...] "easily the show's best {{creation}} so far," [...] {{and during the}} third season he wrote, [...] "Ron being both awesome and hilarious is something Nick Offerman and these writers can do in their sleep by now." [...] Sal Basile of UGO Networks wrote, [...] "How anyone can make Ron Swanson of Parks and Recreation likable is beyond us, but Offerman does it effortlessly. <b>Before</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> it we couldn't wait to see Swanson's reactions to the slightest of problems." [...] Matt Fowler of IGN was critical of Ron {{at the start of}} the show, and called him [...] "a bit of the dud (who) offers little to the show, and almost just stand to sour the whole thing." [...] However, by the second season, Fowler said the character had improved and became [...] "an absolute stand-out in the series." [...] Several reviewers have praised the platonic relationship between Ron and Leslie, which has been compared to that of Mary Richards and Lou Grant in The Mary Tyler Moore Show.|$|E

500|$|After a hiatus, Partridge {{returned}} in 2010 {{in a series}} of YouTube shorts, Mid Morning Matters with Alan Partridge, as the host of a digital radio show with co-presenter Sidekick Simon (Tim Key). Coogan co-wrote the shorts with brothers Neil and Rob Gibbons, who submitted scripts to his company Baby Cow Productions; the Gibbons have co-written every Partridge project since. According to Neil, Coogan [...] "invited us in, our sensibilities chimed, and <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> it, Mid Morning Matters was up and running. We wrote it as if it was our baby, and though {{there was a sense that}} we were standing on the shoulders of giants, I think we were like two pairs of fresh eyes, and Steve seemed to fall in love with the character all over again." [...] Coogan said they chose the web format because [...] "it was a bit underground, a low-key environment in which to test the character out again. And the response was so good, we realised there was more fuel in the tank." [...] The shorts were later broadcast by Sky Atlantic.|$|E
500|$|Development of {{the game}} begun {{after the release of}} Nights into Dreams... in July 1996, after Sonic Team {{received}} a lot of letters from fans asking [...] "who Sonic was". Naka and Naoto Ohshima thought it was important to introduce people to the Sonic character, which was the basis for introducing [...] "Project Sonic" [...] to the public. Until the release of Sonic Jam, the studio themselves had not worked on a Sonic title since Sonic & Knuckles in 1994, in which Naka thought that Sonic Team had a good rest period to [...] "recharge our batteries" [...] and had new ideas regarding a new game. [...] "Sonic World"—Sonic Jams 3D hub world—served as a prototype for the first fully 3D Sonic game—Sonic Adventure—which began development for the Saturn but was moved to its successor, the Dreamcast. In a retrospective interview, Naka stated that the 3D section of Sonic Jam was part of an experiment to see how a Sonic the Hedgehog game would work in full 3D. [...] "Sonic World" [...] uses the same engine as Nights; there is speculation that Naka's refusal to share the Nights engine with the Sega Technical Institute (STI) team developing Sonic X-treme—a factor in the latter's cancellation—was motivated by his preference for Sonic Team's own efforts to create an original 3D Sonic title. Naka later expressed [...] "relief" [...] that X-treme was cancelled. Naka and Ohshima reflected that the most difficult part during the development process was gathering game-specific information in [...] "Sonic World", as [...] "there are so many games we have never even heard of... Sega's a big company and <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> it lots of different game systems had sprung up (including Game Gear, Master System and Pico)." ...|$|E

2500|$|Droste and Bear were {{subsequently}} joined by bass guitarist and producer Chris Taylor, and performed four shows {{together as a}} three-piece. Regarding these shows, Droste noted, [...] "We've never played without the four of us, really. The first couple shows we did <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> Dan , we did with three of us {{and they kind of}} sucked. From the get-go, when we were trying to put together a live show, that's when we discovered our sound and that's why I think {{that was the beginning of}} the band." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sandé {{said that}} the first track on the album, [...] "Heaven" [...] was a huge [...] "epic pop song" [...] which had {{sweeping}} strings. It came about when {{she was having a}} late night conversation with Naughty Boy, the song's producer with whom she worked throughout the whole album. She said that Naughty Boy had a beat running in the background, and then she got the first line of the song and the song began to write itself from there. She said; [...] "I love how songs like that develop: <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> it, we were putting strings on with a synth, Naughty Boy suggested the Funky Drummer loop and it came together really organically." [...] The song was heavily compared to Massive Attack's [...] "Unfinished Sympathy", however Sandé said that she takes it as a compliment as she is a big fan of Massive Attack. However, she said lyrically or melodically the songs are not similar, but the Funky Drummer loop has been used so much and it has strings on people and that is why the connection is made between the two songs. She said she was glad if people get the same vibe from the song, as she loves the song and said the song was [...] "really exciting". Sandé said she also [...] "designed" [...] the song for a night club moment, where everyone can put their hands in the air. The song's genre featured a dubstep pop. Sandé {{said that the}} song was {{based on the fact that}} she believes in God and heaven, although she does not follow a religion. She said that what inspired her the most to write the track was her idea of heaven, which was being surrounded by music and somewhere which is very calm, and she wrote about that in [...] "Heaven".|$|E
