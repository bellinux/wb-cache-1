2500|$|In May 1980, Mazda {{released}} a {{limited production run}} of special North American models known as the Leathersport Models. This package was essentially an uprated GS model with added LS badges on each B-pillar, special striping, and LS-only gold anodized wheels (with polished outer face and wheel rim). All LS editions came equipped with special LS-only full brown leather upholstery, leather wrapped steering wheel, leather wrapped shift knob, removable sunroof, LS-specific four-speaker AM/FM stereo radio with power antenna (though listed as a six speaker stereo, as the two rear dual voice coil speakers were counted as four speakers in total), remote power door side mirrors, and other standard GS equipment. Two primary options were also available; a three-speed JATCO 3N71B automatic transmission and air conditioning. Other GS options such as cassette tape deck, splash guards, padded center console arm rest and others could be added by the dealer. The LS model was only ever available in three different exterior colors: Aurora White, <b>Brilliant</b> <b>Black,</b> and Solar Gold. No official production records are known to exist or to have been released. This series of RX-7 had exposed steel bumpers and a high-mounted indentation-located license plate, called by Werner Buhrer of Road & Track magazine a [...] "Baroque depression." ...|$|E

Invisible fluorescent paints appear transparent or pale under daytime lighting, but will glow under UV light in a limited range of colors. Since these can seem to 'disappear', {{they can be used}} to create a variety of clever effects.|$|R

The prohibition on black series costumes also has a significant meaning in ancient China. By discussing prohibitions related to black series in ancient Chinese costume institution, this paper studied two typical colors used by people of different classes as their clothes which are pure black and dark black. Meanwhile, it also discussed evolution and characteristics of costumes prohibitions in black series at different historical periods of ancient China through the research on the historical records and relics...|$|R
50|$|Adults grow to {{a length}} of 152 - 183 cm. The color pattern {{consists}} {{of a series of}} <b>brilliant</b> orange and <b>black</b> rings in juveniles, but this fades in about a year as the snakes mature. Adults are usually a shade of brown with black rings, or a uniform blackish brown. Usually, there is a light spot behind the eye. Some specimens may have black rings that are irregular, incompletely formed or even absent. The scales are highly iridescent.|$|R

A second inventory in 2000 produced the following list interpreted as a normal amount of species: common hawker, brown hawker, Irish damselfly, variable damselfly, downy emerald, red-eyed damselfly, northern white-faced darter, <b>brilliant</b> emerald, and <b>black</b> darter.|$|R
50|$|In 1902, Gabain {{studied at}} the Slade School of Fine Art before {{returning}} to France in 1903 to study at Raphael Collin's Studio in Paris.

The Central, which was established in 1896 by the London County Council, offered instruction in the trades which {{were thought to be}} more artistic - lithography being one of them. Gabain was determined to produce her own lithographic prints and also enrolled at the Chelsea Polytechnic for a time. Here she learnt how to use a printing press.

60|$|The Unqualified Member from Cherokee Strip {{was in a}} {{state of}} deep dejection. For a good while, now, he had been leading a sort of life which was {{calculated}} to kill; for it had consisted in regularly alternating days of <b>brilliant</b> hope and <b>black</b> disappointment.

50|$|Though very small, and {{surrounded}} by development, roads and a highway, the park is rich with wildlife. In spring it teams with birds, most noticeable being the many species of honeyeaters. Australian fairywrens such as the beautiful blue variegated fairywren and the <b>brilliant</b> red and <b>black</b> red-backed fairywren both occur here. In a very large old gum tree wedge-tailed eagles have made a nest, and the adults are often seen soaring over the park. Calls from white-throated gerygones, spangled drongos and rainbow bee-eaters make a pleasant background sound in the park.|$|R
50|$|The genus Neodrepanis is characterised by a tiny {{body with}} a short tail, a fine, {{strongly}} decurved bill and, during the breeding season, strong sexual dichromatism. Males in breeding plumage are <b>brilliant</b> blue and <b>black</b> above and variably bright yellow below, with extraordinary blue and green facial caruncles. Females, males in non-breeding plumage and immatures are dull blue-green above, lack caruncles and are variably yellowish below; some female-plumaged birds (at least for Common Sunbird Asity) have a half-sized caruncle and may be immature males. In winter, males are often seen with traces of breeding plumage coloration.|$|R
60|$|The female {{was very}} industrious, never {{returning}} to the nest without some contribution, while the male frolicked about the trees in his <b>brilliant</b> orange and <b>black,</b> whistling his warm rich notes, and seeming like a dash of southern sunshine amidst the blossoms. Sometimes he stopped in his frolic to find a bit of string, over which he raised an impromptu jubilate, or to fly with his mate to the nest, uttering that soft rich twitter of his {{in a mixture of}} blarney and congratulation whenever she found some particularly choice material. But his chief part seemed to be to furnish the celebration, while she took care of the nest-making.|$|R

6000|$|Of the {{fur-bearing}} animals, [...] "the precious ermine," [...] {{so called}} {{by way of}} preeminence, is found, of the best quality, only in the cold regions of Europe and Asia. * Its fur is of the most perfect whiteness, except the tip of its tail, which is of a <b>brilliant</b> shining <b>black.</b> With these back tips tacked on the skins, they are beautifully spotted, producing an effect often imitated, but never equalled in other furs. The ermine is of the genus mustela (weasel), and resembles the common weasel in its form, is from fourteen to sixteen inches {{from the tip of}} the nose {{to the end of the}} tail. The body is from ten to twelve inches long. It lives in hollow trees, river banks, and especially in beech forests; preys on small birds, is very shy, sleeping during the day, and employing the night in search of food. The fur of the older animals is preferred to the younger. It is taken by snares and traps, and sometimes shot with blunt arrows. Attempts have been made to domesticate it; but it is extremely wild and has been found untameable.|$|R
40|$|Crosses {{were made}} and cv. and lines {{selected}} to combine the existing resistance to Xanthomonas campestris pv. phaseoli with adaptation to the tropics and to determine new sources of resistance. Crosses were made between adapted lines and sources of resistance, some with Great Northern genes. The greenhouse inoculation method was modified for field use thus allowing large F 2 populations to be inoculated and seed setting, plant architecture, and agronomic value of these selections to be monitored. After 2 yr there are lines with intermediate to resistance reactions, better adapted to CIAT conditions and with a broad color range, including red <b>brilliant</b> and <b>black</b> opaque. In Sept. 1981 some of these lines were planted in Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and several showed a better adaptation to Central American conditions than to those at CIAT. Other possible sources of resistance were evaluated as parent materials {{but most of them}} did not combine well in crosses. Some sources were eliminated {{on the basis of their}} performance in crosses. Other sources with progenies as advanced breeding lines are G 04826, G 05147, G 04399, and ICA Linea 23. (AS...|$|R
60|$|Madame de Bellaise was a fine-looking {{woman of}} forty, {{in a high}} state of preservation, owing to the healthy life she had led. Her eyes were of <b>brilliant,</b> {{beautiful}} <b>black</b> her complexion had a glow, her hair--for she wore it visibly--formed crisp rolls of jetty ringlets on her temples, almost hiding her close white cap. The heavy thick veil was tucked back beneath the furred purple silk hood that fastened under her chin. The white robes of her order were not of serge, but of the finest cloth, and were almost hidden by a short purple cloak with sleeves, likewise lined and edged with fur, and fastened on the bosom with a gold brooch. Her fingers, bearing more rings than the signet of her house, were concealed in embroidered gauntlets of Spanish leather. One of them held an ivory-handled riding-rod, the other the reins of the well-fed jennet, on which the lady, on a fine afternoon, late in the Carnival, was cantering home through the lanes of the Bocage, after a successful morning's hawking among the wheat-ears.

60|$|The Duke's {{companion}} nodded silently. He had {{the air of}} {{a silent}} man. He was short, inclined to be stout, and his dress and bearing were almost bourgeois. His features were large and not particularly intelligent, his cheeks were puffy, and his gray beard ill-humored. He had the double neck of the Frenchman of the lower class who has not denied himself the joys of the cuisine, and his appearance would have been hopelessly commonplace but for the deep-set <b>brilliant</b> <b>black</b> eyes which lit up his whole face and gave it an aspect of power.|$|E

60|$|Following, {{in company}} with Dr. A. Smith, {{the line of}} {{junction}} between the granite and the slate, as it stretched inland, in a S.E. direction, {{we came to a}} place, where the slate was converted into a fine-grained, perfectly characterised gneiss, composed of yellow-brown granular feldspar, of abundant <b>black</b> <b>brilliant</b> mica, and of few and thin laminae of quartz. From the abundance of the mica in this gneiss, compared with the small quantity and excessively minute scales, in which it exists in the glossy clay-slate, we must conclude, that it has been here formed by the metamorphic action--a circumstance doubted, under nearly similar circumstances, by some authors. The laminae of the clay-slate are straight; and it was interesting to observe, that as they assumed the character of gneiss, they became undulatory with some of the smaller flexures angular, like the laminae of many true metamorphic schists.|$|R
50|$|Allomyrina dichotoma shows a {{striking}} sexual dimorphism. The males are much larger, reaching {{a length of}} 40-80 mm, while females can reach a length of about 40-60 mm. The long cephalic horn of this species has a characteristic shape {{in the form of}} the letter Y and it is used by males during the mating period and to maintain territories. By means of their forked horn they lift other males off the ground and throw them into the air. In addition to their impressive and ornate protuberance they also have a smaller thoracic horn, also forked. Their eyes may be white or red and are adapted to low light levels, as this species is nocturnal. The body is dark brown, while the ventral part of the body is <b>black,</b> <b>brilliant</b> and the front legs are unusually long. Like all Dynastinae species, these beetles are strong flyers, although they never cover long distances during the flight. The preferred foods are tree saps, fruits and anything sugary.|$|R
