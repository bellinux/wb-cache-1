50|$|Although a {{plan for}} a {{national}} library was included in the 1961 First National Development Plan, it was not sustained in the following years. In 1973, Mastini Hardjoprakoso, an employee of the National Museum library, developed a concept for the national library, but it was not immediately adopted by the Ministry of Education and Culture. However, the plan caught the attention of the National Development Planning Agency (<b>Bappenas)</b> and other information services. When a new culture director took office in 1978, the ministry finally gave its support for the project. Funding for the library was also provided by Madam Tien Suharto, who was impressed by a 1968 exhibition of colonial and national newspapers at the National Museum.|$|E

50|$|Moojen's {{plan was}} later {{extensively}} modified by F.J. Kubatz {{as part of}} the city's next development plan. In the Kubatz plan, the street pattern was changed and a small pond (Situ Lembang) was added to the east of the central park area, originally named Bisschooplein after G.J. Bishop, mayor of Batavia (1916-1920). Other architects contributed to the character of Menteng Residential Area through landmarks. Architect Ghijsels designed Indies-styled houses, St. Paul's Church and the adjacent Logegebouw, which was the office of the burgemester, centrally positioned and facing the central park (now the Indonesian national development planning board (<b>BAPPENAS)).</b> Ghijsels's colleagues in the AIA, architect J.F.L. Blankenberg, designed some lavish residences in Menteng between 1926 to 1939 (after Ghijsels had returned to the Netherlands) e.g. the home of the owner of Wellenstein & Krausse Company (1926, now the residence of the US Ambassador to Indonesia), home of the Governor of Jakarta (1939), and several lavish residences for local businessmen along Jalan Imam Bonjol (one of them is now the National Proclamation Museum).|$|E
50|$|Under government's support, CDP is {{supported}} by the access of toll roads and railway system. In addition, new access to CDP is currently being developed. The National Development Planning Agency (<b>Bappenas)</b> and Indonesia Port Authority region II (Pelindo II) plans to build an inland waterways. The project is to optimize an existing river namely Cikarang Bekasi Laut (CBL) by widening the river. The route expands from Tanjung Priok Port to CDP and will be utilized as a new transportation alternative. It will be more efficient in terms of time, energy and finance. No trucking activities are needed and the traffic hassle can be reduced especially at Inner Jakarta toll road and Jakarta - Cikampek toll road. Utilizing the river also means the government does not have to make a new toll road. In essence, the development of inland waterway or Cikarang Bekasi Laut (CBL) aims to optimize the potential of the river channel as an alternative transportation logistics that will connect off Tanjung Priok offshore with rural areas.|$|E
50|$|Strategies and policies. Most {{strategies}} for the sector are formulated at the national level. Capacity problems, funding constraints and political factors at the sub-national level often mean national strategies are not well implemented. Furthermore, law enforcement is weak, especially for environmental sanitation. In 2009 the Ministry of Public Works and the National Development Planning Agency, <b>Bappenas,</b> launched a roadmap called “Acceleration of Sanitation Development in Human Settlements” (PPSP) 2010-2014. The roadmap targets 330 cities that have sanitation problems, and aims at abolishing open defecation, improving solid waste management and reducing flooding. It foresees {{the construction of new}} and expanded sewerage networks in 16 cities, covering 5 million people, and of community-based decentralized wastewater management systems in every city, covering 6 millions people. The latter systems, called Sanitasi oleh Masyarakat (Sanitation by Communities), include neighborhood-level sewer systems with small wastewater treatment plants, typically using the Anaerobic Batch Reactor technology. The systems are completely operated by community-based organizations that collect user fees. According to research conducted in 2011, community-based organizations operate the systems fairly well, but are unable to undertake major maintenance such as removal of sludge from the wastewater treatment plants or repairs after natural disasters. In addition to decentralized sewer systems, the government also supports the construction of community toilets, although people prefer to have their individual toilets. Community toilets are a good alternative where individual toilets are not feasible, especially in areas subject to frequent flooding, where most residents are tenants or where there are severe space constraints and very densely populated slum areas.|$|E
