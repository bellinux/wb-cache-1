Privacy, having characteristics opposing {{to the rest}} of the attributes, makes design of a security architecture quite difficult. A commonly used solution is to have a large number of temporary certificates (i. e., pseudonyms) to achieve these security attributes. To guard against their malicious use, these pseudonyms are stored in expensive tamper-proof-devices (TPDs). Further, a large number of valid pseudonyms, at any given time, make non-repudiation and revocation quite complex and difficult to achieve. Another solution is to get pseudonyms blindly signed from a certificate server, thus eliminating the need of TPDs (given the pseudonyms are not generated in bulk). However, blind signatures provide unconditional privacy and thus require complex/multitransaction procedures to ensure non-repudiation/revocation. We present a security architecture by revising the original Blind signature scheme. Our proposed architecture provides “one-waylink-ability” that helps to achieve all the security attributes without introducing complex/multi-transaction procedures. It does not require expensive TPDs or complex pseudonym issuance/revocation procedures and is especially suited to VANET during initial deployment phase which is characterized with intermittent connectivity. Further, nonrepudiation/revocation requires cooperation between multiple entities thus ensuring privacy without a single point of failure.

40|$|Certain {{positions}} may {{be difficult}} to fill because they impose indirect costs that prospective employees are unwilling to bear. These costs could be due to some stigma associated with the position or employer (i. e., taking the job of an accountant in a strip club). Accepting a controversial position, or one opposed by some radical group may place the individual, his/her family and property at risk. It could be that taking the job may jeopardize future hiring and earning potential. The support of anonymity could potentially increase the applicant pool, potentially reducing costs and improving the process outcomes. Unfortunately, traditional contractual mechanisms do not support anonymity. We developed mechanisms that mirror the traditional contractual mechanisms yet allow individuals to remain anonymous. Using <b>blind</b> <b>certificates</b> we show it is possible to verify applicant`s credentials. Additionally, this approach avoids the creation of an alternate, pseudo-identifier that can link individuals across multiple data sources, {{as is the case with}} the social security number today. Using fair blind signatures we also address the case where it may be necessary to revoke credentials. The governmental income reporting requirements must be addressed if anonymous employment is to be possible. Three alternatives are presented, each with a different degree of anonymity. If the government`s goal is to ensure that the appropriate taxes are paid, this could be satisfied by paying the maximum applicable tax on the amount earned. The employer would withhold income taxes at the maximum marginal tax rate before dispersing the net income to the employee, similar to what is currently done with FICA. If the government wants to track money flow, the government could issue the employee an encrypted version of their social security number, the validity (but not the actual contents) of which could be verified by the employer. The employer would then submit the required reports using this encrypted identifier in place of the social security number. The use of multiple versions of this encrypted identifier would prevent it from being used as a pseudo-identifier. This approach blinds the employee`s identity to the employer but not to the government. This approach does impose some administrative overhead for the generation and decryption of the encrypted identifiers. If the government is unwilling to incur this overhead, an outsourcing model could be employed. In this case, a trusted intermediary could shield the individual`s identity while satisfying the reporting and accountability requirements. Employee anonymity is less secure since the intermediary now knows his identity...|$|R

Such a certificate embeds {{increasing number of}} information that leads the certificate provider to adapt existing standards to its requirements. In this paper, we propose {{a new model of}} certification called X 316 to set up an XML certificates with a contextual morph capability. This morph characteristic enables each certificate owner to disclose and to <b>blind</b> some sensitive <b>certificate</b> parts according to surrounding context. The usability of the X 316 is illustrated with the "Chameleon" architecture offering users such a possible access if they appear with trusted certificates. These certificates may be gathered during their roaming in the pervasive environment, and they offer direct or transitive access to foreign sites, based on trust relationships...|$|R
