40|$|Using {{a linear}} factor model, we study the {{behaviour}} of French, Germany, Italian and British sovereign yield curves in the {{run up to}} EMU. This allows us to determine which of these yield curves might best approximate a benchmark yield curve post EMU. We find that the best approximation for the risk free yield is the UK three month T-bill yield, followed by the German three month T-bill yield. As no one sovereign yield curve dominates all others, we find that a composite yield curve, consisting of French, Italian and UK bonds at different maturity points along the yield curve should be the <b>benchmark</b> <b>post</b> EMU. ...|$|E
30|$|Also the {{relevance}} of benchmarking information by Sapienza et al. (2004) was investigated. Shokrollahpour et al. (2016) proposed a new methodology for efficiency benchmarking in DEA by using ANN approach. In another research, Yi et al. (2003) studied the similarity and proximity between two benchmarks using Euclidean distances in two benchmarks. Rödder et al. (2017) proposed an interactive DEA model for measuring the return to scale of DMUs. Bogetoft and Hougaard (1998) believed that the nearest benchmark to the unit under evaluation should {{be used as the}} main example for <b>benchmark.</b> <b>Post</b> and Spronk (1999) developed the interactive model using the expert’s opinions of the system. The improved model was an iterative and integrated model based on data envelopment analysis and goal programming. In this model it is tried to dwindle the distances between suggestions made—this continues until the suggestions reach an optimal level and can satisfy the experts of the systems and can also be feasible. Baek and Lee (2009) continued with the work of Halme et al. (1999) and presented a model in order to have the best and the most disciplined model using the least distance. Unlike previous models (that only presented models), it studies and measures the efficiency of the units. Ziari and Raissi (2016) developed a new model for ranking of strongly efficient DMUs in DEA by solving the infeasibility and unbounded difficulties of existing models. Esmaeilzadeh and Hadi-Vencheh (2015) proposed a procedure for complete ranking of DMUs in DEA. Izadikhah and Saen (2015) also developed a new model for ranking DMUs in DEA.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies two {{different}} monetary policy regimes {{in an economy}} in which private agents are learning, as they cannot directly observe the cen-tral bank’s inflation target and the persistence of inflation. Under the first regime, the policymaker uses a simple linear rule of the type commonly em-ployed in the related literature. This policy rule disregards the non-linearities introduced by adaptive learning of the boundedly rational private sector. Un-der the second regime, the central bank has superior information and con-ducts policy optimally, taking into account private-sector learning. Based on a calibration exercise, I show that not only under the simple policy, but also under the optimal policy, adaptive learning increases the volatility and persistence of inflation {{as compared to the}} rational expectations <b>benchmark.</b> Using <b>post</b> W.

A series of follow-up studies of the same group is planned for future years. Data for the current study were obtained by personal interview from a sample of farm operators who entered farming in 1959 and 1960. The sample of entrants was obtained from a state-wide sample survey involving nearly 7, 000 farm operators. It was based on a self-weighting single-stage sample of area segments drawn at random from a universe defined as the open-country zone of Iowa by the current Master Sample materials. Entrants were classified into two groups: beginning entrants and other entrants. The beginning-entrant group consisted of persons who had never farmed before the year of entry and persons who had farmed before the year of entry but had disposed of their farming assets with the apparent intent of permanent withdrawal. Other entrants consisted of persons who had farmed during an earlier period but had temporarily withdrawn from farming (retained their farming assets) with the apparent intent of re-entering...|$|R
40|$|The current {{investigation}} explored {{the effects of}} the Read Naturally® program on the reading fluency of students with disabilities in an elementary school setting. Participants were eight students with disabilities grades three through six who were screened and found ready to receive a fluency intervention. Reading fluency pre-post measures were collected. Weekly progress monitoring was carried out and data was compared to national norms as described by the 2005 Hasbrouck-Tindal Table of Oral Reading Fluency Norms. All three female participants showed a downward trend in their progress monitoring data. In contrast, all male participants showed an upward trend. All except two participants showed fluency gains between the pre and <b>post</b> <b>benchmark</b> fluency data, however, only one of the participants reached the 50 th percentile norm fluency rate for their grade level. The majority of the students expressed reading satisfaction and the program was implemented with fidelity except for communication with parents. The teachers and aides also expressed satisfaction with the program. The Read Naturally® program was implemented for the minimum recommended time, therefore, sufficient gains were not made to close the gap between students with disabilities using the Read Naturally® program and students remaining in the classroom for core instruction without interventions. Future research should replicate these findings in a larger, normative sample and encourage maximum recommended time for the implementation of the Read Naturally® program...|$|R
40|$|In this master thesis, a {{comparative}} study of the feasibility of fluid-structure interaction (FSI) tools {{has been done in}} light of simulating the problem of obstructive-sleep apnea (OSA). Part of the study has been done by simulating the benchmark; Flow Induced Oscillations of a Flexible Beam, by the different solvers; COMSOL, Abaqus and Abaqus coupled with ANSYS Fluent through third party coupling code MpCCI. By evaluating the results produced a qualifying approach for simulating the case of OSA is done. By assessing through FSI simulations, insight to the problem at hand can be gained. Making a proper problem formulation can be crucial to get a physical meaningful analysis. When setting up FSI simulations, several choices have to be made to make the most suitable approach. For instance if the type of discretization should be described with a Lagrangian, Eulerian or an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation, and how the coupling of the fluid and solid domain should be done. The capturing of the interface and the interaction between the fluid and structure proves to be essential for the simulations. In addition to the choice of dicretization and coupling of the domains, the simulations is sometimes limited by technical problems and the feasibility of tools. The use of computational FSI analysis can be a cumbersome task even if simulations yield decent results. The majority of the benchmark simulations did not produce the results expected. Only two of four simulations reached oscillations resembling the pattern shown in other studies. Thus indicating errors in model description and/or weaknesses of tools. For instance the capability to solve for non-linear behaviour. The main issue for the benchmark simulations were related to the deformation and mesh motion of the fluid domain by the use of the ALE method, which often required a finer mesh tuning increasing the computational cost. The results from the <b>benchmark</b> were <b>post</b> processed in COMSOL and Abaqus, and compared in order to see to what extent they correlated. For additional perspective a comparable study is referred to in context of some of the findings. By formulating a simpler problem description for the case of OSA some of the issues related to large deformations were bypassed. The simulation of the soft palate yielded coarse yet useful results, which can be used to get some insights to the disease. However, due to some of the flow specifics other problems were encountered, mainly regarding the embedded 3 D simulations done with Abaqus. These primarily concerned convergence criteria for the equilibrium equations, where a low Reynolds number and high flow velocity demanded fine tuning of mesh and additional equilibrium convergence iterations...|$|R

40|$|An {{efficient}} {{air transport}} system {{is an important}} part of social and economic development of Southern African Development Community (SADC). Efficient intra-SADC air service connections enhance regional integration, access to the global economy, international tourism and contribute towards the vision to establish the African Economic Community by 2034. SADC, in July 1998, embarked on liberalisation of the regional civil aviation sector in order to enhance the efficiency of air transport services. In the United States of America and European Union, the liberalisation of air transport has transformed civil aviation networks. The fragmentation of air service connections on the intra-SADC network in the midst of the liberalisation process is symptomatic of a poor implementation strategy coupled with air transport market imperfections. The purpose of this thesis is to examine, understand and explain the factors that influence the disintegration of the intra-SADC air transport network. The aim is to identify how regional air transport services can be transformed to meet the social and economic demands of the region. This research adopts network theory, as the conceptual framework of the investigation. Assuming a graph approaching maximal connection as the sought after state of affairs for SADC; this study <b>benchmarked</b> the <b>post</b> liberalisation network structure to the regional economic communities of ASEAN and MERCOSUR. The aim of the benchmarking is to identify the extend of the differences in air transport network in those two regions, resulting from the policies adopted and to establish how the SADC policies may be improved and implemented more efficiently. The findings of the study are that, in comparison to the two developing regions, SADC’s liberalisation measures have failed. The study developed and evaluated an econometric model which analysed demand patterns on the intra-SADC passenger air transport network. Although low levels of passenger demand seem to characterise the majority of SADC city-pairs, the study identified nodes with sufficient demand to justify direct connections which would in turn reduce network fragmentation. This research also establishes that the absence of a realistic detailed roadmap, an ill-defined programme of action and inadequate resources contributed to the failure of SADC’s liberalisation strategy. In its final sections, this study proposes an ideal demand-driven network configuration and offers specific recommendations to SADC member states for that network to be functional. The proposed network improves network connectivity from the current poor levels, where a connectivity measure of 15 % suggests underdevelopment, to levels over 40 %. The study however, acknowledges that air transport liberalisation does not necessarily guarantee equitable distribution of network efficiency in developing regions. There are communities that cannot sustain commercially viable air service connections without economic subvention, probably in the form of the Public Service Obligation (PSO) programme adopted in the EU...|$|R
40|$|Earnings {{management}} {{is an area}} in which managers are able to exercise discretion over financial reporting to achieve various objectives. Researchers have been investigating the pervasiveness of earnings management and incentives that induce earnings management. However, the evidence is mixed and studies of using Australian data are scarce. This thesis is an empirical investigation of earnings management in the Australian context addressing if and why Australian firms engage in earnings management. Based on a sample covering all ASX listed firms during the period of 2000 to 2006, this study examines the overall breadth and scope of earnings management behaviour in a broad context across Australian industry sectors and individual firms’ characteristics. The result suggests that Australian firms engage in earnings management. The level of earnings management practices in some specific industries and the association of these practices with firms’ characteristics may help the assessment and improvement of the overall quality of financial reporting. Based on a sub-sample, this study also examines whether the practices of earnings {{management is}} induced by executive compensation incentives. It extends prior research by using more relevant, recent, and large-scale compensation data to capture the dynamic relations between earnings management and different forms of executive pay. Such dynamic relations may be of interest to compensation committees in designing compensation structures that balance the incentives to improve firms’ performances with the incentive to earnings manipulation. This study also examines whether earnings management is induced by benchmark beating incentives. It extends prior research by examining under what circumstance managers are more likely to beat benchmarks. The results suggest that managers beat two earnings benchmarks: reporting profits and sustaining prior year’s earnings. More importantly, managers are more likely to exercise positive discretionary accruals to inflate earnings to beat ex <b>post</b> <b>benchmarks</b> when the true earnings are below relevant benchmarks. This will be of interest to regulators as an effective way to detect earnings management may be pronounced when the ex ante condition under which firms seek to manipulate earnings is identified...|$|R
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} {{in this case}} {{study was to explore}} the use of {{three-dimensional}} virtual spaces via the use of the game Minecraft as a teaching tool. The case study examined the effectiveness, self-efficacy, and social interaction of students when using such a tool in the teaching and learning process. The research analyzed knowledge acquisition through various deliverables such as <b>benchmark</b> pre and <b>post</b> exams, student discourse, and tangible objects created from the lessons by the students. Students were enrolled and participated in a summer camp offered from Arts and Technology Institute in North Texas. The camp utilized Minecraft to teach architecture types. Students learned about pyramids (Egyptian and Aztec), Roman/Greek architecture, Gothic architecture, and Post-Modern Architecture. Each day students were exposed to a different them of architecture and were tasked with building a world that was in the theme of an assigned type of architecture. Fifty-nine school age students ranging in ages from eight to twelve years old participated fully in the study. The students were not grouped by age, but instead self-selected partners with which to work during the course of their creations. Results show that students who participated in the Minecraft driven course were highly engaged and reported a positive experience during the course of learning. Participants worked cohesively to achieve common goals and problem solve during the course of project completion. Participants freely participated in discourse that was on the topic of the lesson, as well as, offered suggestions for improvement and solicited ideas from other participants. Pre and posttest results yielded an improvement in knowledge acquisition regarding general knowledge of architecture types. Many students frequently used the word “Fun” to describe their learning experience as cited in their daily blog entries. The research strived to show that using Minecraft as a teaching tool can create an environment in which students are highly engaged and are afforded an opportunity to learn material in a way that students can see as an applicable reason for learning. Results of this research evidence Minecraft as a tool in learning yields an atmosphere in which students take ownership of their learning and work in concert {{with other members of the}} classroom to yield positive learning outcomes...|$|R
