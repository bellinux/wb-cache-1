5|$|After {{more than}} 60 years of {{continuous}} operation, the Cacchio family {{decided to sell}} the Theatre.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} <b>buy</b> <b>and</b> hold investors on security price dynamics in a pure-exchange, continuous-time model. Empirical studies suggest that many defined contribution plan participants follow <b>buy</b> <b>and</b> hold strategies by rarely changing asset and flow allocations due to information costs or other frictions. A <b>buy</b> <b>and</b> hold investor effectively faces an incomplete market and differs in her pricing of risk from a dynamic asset allocator. Construction of an equilibrium is achieved through a representative agent with state-dependent utility. The fraction of the stock held by the <b>buy</b> <b>and</b> hold investor emerges as an additional state variable. Characterization of equilibrium quantities is given analytically as function of the state variables. A simple calibration of our model shows that the economy with <b>buy</b> <b>and</b> hold investors can simultaneously produce a low interest rate and a high Sharpe ratio. At the same time, the model can deliver a stock return volatility {{more than twice that}} in the limited participation model while keeping interest rate volatility at reasonably low levels. Intuition for these results is also provided. ...|$|R
5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{contend that}} a risk parity portfolio requires strong management and continuous oversight {{to reduce the}} potential for negative consequences {{as a result of}} leverage and allocation building in the form of <b>buying</b> <b>and</b> selling of assets to keep dollar holdings at predetermined and equalized risk levels. For example, if the price of a security goes up or down and risk levels remain the same, the risk parity portfolio will be adjusted to keep its dollar exposure constant. On the other hand, some consider risk parity to be a passive approach, because it does not require the portfolio manager to buy or sell securities on the basis of judgments about future market behavior.|$|E
