5|$|The Indian Princess {{certainly}} began a long American {{tradition of}} romanticizing and sexualizing Pocahontas, {{who was only}} a child in Smith’s original accounts. Therefore, it deserves recognition for inaugurating a genre, but it can <b>be</b> <b>criticized</b> for diminishing the potential richness of the subject matter.|$|E
5|$|As Michael {{travels to}} Haddonfield, Laurie begins having {{hallucinations}} that mirror Michael's and also begin to include her acting out his murders. Meanwhile, Loomis goes on tour {{to promote his}} new book, only to <b>be</b> <b>criticized</b> by the public, who blame him for Michael's actions and for exploiting the deaths of Michael's victims. When Loomis' book is released, Laurie discovers that she is really Angel Myers, Michael's long-lost sister. She goes to a party with Mya (Brea Grant) and Harley (Angela Trimbur) to escape how she is feeling. Michael appears and kills Harley, then goes to the Brackett house and fatally wounds Annie Brackett (Danielle Harris). When Laurie and Mya arrive, Michael kills Mya and then comes after Laurie, who manages to escape. Laurie flags down a car, but Michael kills the driver and flips the car over with Laurie still inside. Michael then takes the unconscious Laurie to an abandoned shed.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the rapidly}} {{changing}} state, {{the constitution of}} 1816 began to <b>be</b> <b>criticized.</b> Opponents claimed the constitution had too many appointed positions, the terms established were inadequate, {{and some of the}} clauses were too easily manipulated by the political parties that did not exist when then constitution was written. The first constitution had not been put to a vote by the general public, and following the great population growth in the state, it was seen as inadequate. A constitutional convention was called in January 1851 to create a new one. The new constitution was approved by the convention on February 10, 1851, and submitted for a vote to the electorate that year. It was approved and has since been the official constitution.|$|E

5|$|The armies {{stared at}} {{one another in a}} heavy rain across the bloody fields on July 4, the same day that the Vicksburg {{garrison}} surrendered to Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant. Lee had reformed his lines into a defensive position on Seminary Ridge the night of July 3, evacuating the town of Gettysburg. The Confederates remained on the battlefield, hoping that Meade would attack, but the cautious Union commander decided against the risk, a decision for which he would later <b>be</b> <b>criticized.</b> Both armies began to collect their remaining wounded and bury some of the dead. A proposal by Lee for a prisoner exchange was rejected by Meade.|$|E
25|$|No leading Orthodox {{institution}} or halachic arbiter {{is known to}} have publicly endorsed the new prayer groups or Shapiro's article. At the same time, the new practices have yet to be condemned by Modern Orthodoxy's leading institutions. But insiders attributed the institutional silence to the trend being in its early stages, and said the changes were likely to <b>be</b> <b>criticized</b> by leading Orthodox rabbis.|$|E
25|$|Justice Slade in his {{judgment}} said that professional cricketers {{need to make}} a living and the ICC should not stand in their way just because its own interests might be damaged. He said the ICC might have stretched the concept of loyalty too far. Players could not <b>be</b> <b>criticized</b> for entering the contracts in secrecy as the main authorities would deny the players the opportunity to enjoy the advantages offered by WSC.|$|E
5000|$|The nuclear {{programs}} of Iran and North Korea <b>were</b> <b>criticized</b> by leaders, who {{expressed concern that}} they might destabilize their regions.

25|$|This {{announcement}} {{is similar}} in content to the previous Renaissance II package, and once again can <b>be</b> <b>criticized</b> for not including any new equipment or funding for services outside the Corridor. Shortly after this announcement was made, documents obtained by The Canadian Press under the Access to Information Act revealed that delays due to equipment failures had risen by 60% since the previous year. The company attributed this to problems with the aging F40 locomotive fleet.|$|E
25|$|During {{the age of}} Finlandization, the Finnish {{president}} Urho Kekkonen gave {{a speech}} in April 1973 in which he stated that Winter War was unnecessary. This view was received positively in the Kremlin and among the Finnish leftists. Similar opinions were presented by the Swedish prime minister Tage Erlander and Finnish novelist Väinö Linna. Kekkonen's views were objected to as the Winter War was traditionally beyond criticism in Finnish society. However the Continuation War could <b>be</b> <b>criticized</b> openly in the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the race, Lehto's Benetton B194 stalled and was hit by Pedro Lamy's Lotus. Debris from the crash, {{including}} Lamy's right front tyre, flew into the grandstand and injured four spectators and a policeman. Lamy was unhurt but Lehto received a light arm injury. The safety car—a sports variant of an Opel Vectra whose pace would later <b>be</b> <b>criticized</b> as being inadequate to help maintain the competitors' tyres up to temperature—was called out with Senna leading Schumacher, Berger, Hill, Frentzen and Häkkinen.|$|E
50|$|Songs and Ballads from Nova Scotia has <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> for 'selective editing'. Maritime Folk Songs, {{a record}} of {{nineteen}} songs from Creighton's collection, <b>was</b> <b>criticized</b> by some reviewers for its selection of songs.|$|R
50|$|The {{methodology}} of anti-religious propaganda was refined and old methods <b>were</b> <b>criticized,</b> and participants <b>were</b> <b>criticized</b> for laxity. The CPSU Central Committee issued an important resolution in 1979 {{that called for}} stronger anti-religious propaganda.|$|R
5000|$|This 2003 {{report has}} <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> as failing {{to address a}} time-line of {{potential}} radiological hazard from the wreckage during its time in Puerto Rico since 1963 or while lying as wreckage on the bay floor since 1975. It has <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> as missing {{an assessment of the}} potential radiological hazard from the thousands of tons of irradiated steel missing from the wreck site. The sampling has <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> as flawed.|$|R
25|$|Because Lin {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{influential}} figures in promoting Mao's personality cult, he began to <b>be</b> <b>criticized</b> within the Party for its excesses later in 1970. After 1970, some factions within the Army, and those led by Zhou Enlai and Jiang Qing, began to distance themselves from Lin. In order to limit Lin's growing power, Mao approved Zhou's efforts to rehabilitate a number of civilian officials who had been purged during the first years of the Cultural Revolution, and supported Zhou's efforts to improve China's relationship with the United States.|$|E
25|$|On one hand, Enăchiuc's {{proposition}} can <b>be</b> <b>criticized</b> for {{the method}} of transliteration. Symbols that characteristically appear in the same context throughout the codex are regularly transliterated with different letters, so that the patterns in the original code are lost in the transliteration. On the other hand, Enăchiuc is criticized as a linguist and historian. She provided the only linguistic source of a hitherto unknown state of the Romanian language, and her text (even with her glossary) raises so serious doubts both in its linguistic and historic authenticity that they render her work unscientific.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{industries}} (small-scale services, for example) tend to {{have more}} VAT avoidance, particularly where cash transactions predominate, and VAT may <b>be</b> <b>criticized</b> for encouraging this. From the perspective of government, however, VAT may be preferable because it captures {{at least some of the}} value added. For example, a building contractor may offer to provide services for cash (i.e. without a receipt, and without VAT) to a homeowner, who usually cannot claim input VAT back. The homeowner will thus bear lower costs and the building contractor may be able to avoid other taxes (profit or payroll taxes).|$|E
50|$|A CNN instant-poll {{found that}} 48% of viewers {{believed}} Pence had won while 42% thought Kaine won. Pence <b>was</b> <b>criticized</b> after the debate for not defending Donald Trump's comments, while Kaine <b>was</b> <b>criticized</b> {{for being too}} aggressive and interrupting.|$|R
50|$|His {{administration}} has also <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> {{for failing to}} tackle corruption in public proccurement.

50|$|Yandex Launcher has <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> for {{the lack}} of options for {{fine-tuning}} the app. In particular, {{it is not possible to}} hide icon names. Launcher has also <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> for the small variety of wallpapers in the online collection.|$|R
25|$|His legacy {{certainly}} can be credited with {{contributions to the}} constitutional recognition of Muslims (historically revived as Bosniaks in 1993) as a constituent people within Bosnia and Herzegovina, along with the already recognised Croats and Serbs, and his persistent position in protecting those rights. He has also continually worked on protection of the sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina within the Yugoslav federation and while he did begin some processes for which he would <b>be</b> <b>criticized,</b> many consider that without {{his involvement in the}} Yugoslav politics at the time Bosnia may have not had the political nor other potency to pursue the independence in the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|When a name {{is fully}} assimilated, the final vowel is often changed to inflectional o, {{rather than the}} o being added to the full root. As with {{borrowed}} common nouns, this may <b>be</b> <b>criticized</b> if the vowel {{is part of the}} root rather than inflectional in the source language, because the resulting form may not be readily recognized by native speakers of the source language. However, it is a common phenomenon in inflectional languages such as Russian or Latin. If a name is not fully assimilated, the accusative case may be tacked on with a hyphen, as -n if the name ends in a vowel, or as -on if it does not (Zamenhof-on).|$|E
25|$|The breed is {{currently}} threatened with extinction. In the 19th century and early 20th century, this breed {{was still in}} demand for polar expeditions, and approximately 20,000 dogs lived in the Canadian Arctic in the 1920s. However, the breed had declined significantly by the 1960s. The breed had once been accepted for showing by both the American Kennel Club (AKC) and the Canadian Kennel Club (CKC), however in 1959 the AKC dropped the breed from its registry because of extremely low numbers. The Canadian Eskimo Dog and Greenland Greenland Dog are sometimes considered the same breed by authorities, although the Greenland Dog can <b>be</b> <b>criticized</b> for lacking any proper breeding program, questioning its validity as a pure breed.|$|E

50|$|The current Shi`ite {{controlled}} {{government in}} Iraq has <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> for lacking {{a separation of}} religion and state.

25|$|Bakunin {{argues that}} oppressors receive {{authority}} from religion. Religious {{people are in}} many cases obedient to the priests, because many religious people believe that the statements of priests are based on direct divine revelation or scripture. The obedience to divine revelation or scripture is considered as the ethical criteria by many religious people, because God is considered as the omniscient, omnipotent and omnibenevolent being. Therefore, each statement which is considered derived from an infallible God cannot <b>be</b> <b>criticized</b> by humans. According to this religious way of thinking, humans cannot know by themselves what is just, but that only God decides what is good or wrong. People who disobey the “messengers of God” are threatened with punishment in hell.|$|E
25|$|Poitier {{began to}} <b>be</b> <b>criticized</b> for being typecast as over-idealized African American {{characters}} {{who were not}} permitted to have any sexuality or personality faults, such as his character in Guess Who's Coming To Dinner. Poitier was aware of this pattern himself, but was conflicted on the matter. He wanted more varied roles; but he also felt obliged {{to set an example}} with his characters, by challenging old stereotypes as he was the only major actor of African descent being cast in leading roles in the American film industry, at that time. For instance, in 1966, he turned down an opportunity to play the lead in an NBC television production of Othello with that spirit in mind.|$|E
25|$|Bayesian {{inference}} is one proposed {{alternative to}} significance testing. (Nickerson cited 10 sources suggesting it, including Rozeboom (1960)). For example, Bayesian parameter estimation can provide rich {{information about the}} data from which researchers can draw inferences, while using uncertain priors that exert only minimal influence on the results when enough data is available. Psychologist John K. Kruschke has suggested Bayesian estimation as an alternative for the t-test. Alternatively two competing models/hypothesis can be compared using Bayes factors. Bayesian methods could <b>be</b> <b>criticized</b> for requiring information that is seldom available in the cases where significance testing is most heavily used. Neither the prior probabilities nor the probability distribution of the test statistic under the alternative hypothesis are often available in the social sciences.|$|E
50|$|Zerzan's views have <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> {{for being}} anti-anarchist. His {{solution}} - {{a return to}} a hunter-gatherer lifestyle - has <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> as likely to lead to a loss of life. His critics largely reject his claim to be an anarchist.|$|R

25|$|The U.S. has <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> {{for making}} {{statements}} supporting peace and respecting national sovereignty, but while carrying out military actions {{such as in}} Grenada, fomenting a civil war in Colombia to break off Panama, and Iraq. The U.S. has <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> for advocating free trade but while protecting local industries with import tariffs on foreign goods such as lumber and agricultural products. The U.S. has also <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> for advocating concern for human rights while refusing to ratify the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The U.S. has publicly stated that it is opposed to torture, but has <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> for condoning it in the School of the Americas. The U.S. has advocated a respect for national sovereignty but has supported internal guerrilla movements and paramilitary organizations, such as the Contras in Nicaragua. The U.S. has <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> for voicing concern about narcotics production {{in countries such as}} Bolivia and Venezuela but doesn't follow through on cutting certain bilateral aid programs. The U.S. has <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> for not maintaining a consistent policy; it has been accused of denouncing alleged rights violations in China while supporting alleged human rights abuses by Israel.|$|R
