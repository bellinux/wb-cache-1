He occupied Bosnia already in the year of his appointment and forced Tzar Michael Asen I of Bulgaria to cede Belgrade and Barancs (Braničevo, Serbia) in 1255. Béla adopted the title of King of Bulgaria, but he only used it occasionally in the subsequent years.|$|E

In order to deal with the recurring disturbances in that region Zamoyski developed a plan to turn Moldavia into a <b>buffer</b> <b>zone</b> between the Commonwealth and the Ottoman Empire; this would lead to a lengthy campaign.|$|E

This study analyzed the stakeholders’ perceptions towards the potential implementation of <b>buffer</b> <b>zones</b> of the Tasek Bera wetland. The main objectives are, to determine the stakeholders’ understanding about the <b>buffer</b> <b>zones</b> and to identify issues and potentials towards the implementation. The data was based on in-depth interviews on six selected stakeholders of protected areas and <b>buffer</b> <b>zones.</b> This study confirmed that all stakeholders agreed {{on the importance of}} <b>buffer</b> <b>zones,</b> but the potential implementation was unsuccessful due to disagreement on management and implementation between stakeholders...|$|R

After {{the conquest of}} Jazira Abu Ubaidah sent Khalid and Iyad ibn Ghanm (conqueror of Jazira) to invade the Byzantine territory north of Jazira. They marched independently and captured Edessa, Amida (Diyarbakır), Malatya and raided Byzantine Armenia up to Ararat region and also reportedly raided central Anatolia. Heraclius had already abandoned all the forts between Antioch and Tartus to create a <b>buffer</b> <b>zone</b> or no man's land between Muslim controlled areas and main land Anatolia.|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this mini-dissertation {{is the use of}} {{riparian}} <b>buffer</b> <b>zones</b> to manage nitrate pollution of water resources. Riparian <b>buffer</b> <b>zones</b> are vegetated areas adjacent to streams, lakes and rivers, that are managed to enhance and protect aquatic resources from the adverse impacts of agricultural practices. These zon¥s are recognised globally for their function in water quality amelioration. Despite the growing literature, there is little consensus on how to design, assess and manage these riparian <b>buffer</b> <b>zones</b> specifically for nitrate attenuation. For the purpose of this mini-dissertation, a literature review of world-wide research into the nitrate attenuation efficiencies of riparian <b>buffer</b> <b>zones</b> was undertaken. A database was created using the key information from this literature. Two key processes responsible for immobilising and/or removing nitrate from surface and subsurface flows are generally recognised in the available literature, namely: vegetative uptake and the process of denitrification. A comparison of the available riparian studies indicated that there are similar characteristics in riparian <b>buffer</b> <b>zones</b> that may be responsible for enhancing these key mechanisms.

A collection of German states intended {{to serve as}} a <b>buffer</b> <b>zone</b> between France and Central Europe, the creation of the Confederation spelled the end of the Holy Roman Empire and significantly alarmed the Prussians. The brazen reorganization of German territory by the French risked threatening Prussian influence in the region, if not eliminating it outright. War fever in Berlin rose steadily throughout the summer of 1806. At the insistence of his court, especially his wife Queen Louise, Frederick William III decided to challenge the French domination of Central Europe by going to war.|$|E

Named after Sir Mortimer Durand, the foreign secretary of the British Indian government, it was agreed upon by the Emir of Afghanistan (Abdur Rahman Khan) and {{the representatives of the}} British Empire but deeply resented by the Afghans. Its intended purpose was to serve as a <b>buffer</b> <b>zone</b> to inhibit the spread of Russian influence down into British India.|$|E
5|$|Basingstoke's {{expansion}} has absorbed much surrounding farmland {{and scattered}} housing, transforming it into housing estates or local districts. Many {{of these new}} estates are designed as almost self-contained communities, such as Lychpit, Chineham, Popley, Winklebury, Oakridge, Kempshott, Brighton Hill, Viables, South Ham, Black Dam, Buckskin and Hatch Warren. The M3 acts as a <b>buffer</b> <b>zone</b> {{to the south of}} the town, and the South Western Main Line constrains the western expansion, with a green belt to the north and north-east, making Basingstoke shaped almost like a kite. As a result, the villages of Cliddesden, Dummer, Sherborne St John and Oakley, although being very close to the town limits, are considered distinct entities. Popley, Hatch Warren and Beggarwood are seeing rapid growth in housing.|$|E
5|$|Despite the pacts, the Soviet Union's fears continued. In {{a stance}} long held by Russian {{military}} theorists, {{control of the}} Baltic Sea was crucial {{to the defense of}} St. Petersburg, Russia's second-largest city and the Baltic states offered a <b>buffer</b> <b>zone</b> between Russia and Germany. Pursuing this strategy, the Soviet Union initiated the Winter War in Finland after that country rejected a similar Moscow-offered mutual assistance treaty. Stalin was unnerved by German successes in Europe, since they had taken Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg by spring of 1940. According to Nikita Khrushchev, after the fall of France in May, Joseph Stalin expressed the concern that Adolf Hitler would 'beat our brains in'.|$|E

5|$|Heraclius {{abandoned}} Syria {{with the}} holy relic of the True Cross which was, along with other relics held at Jerusalem, secretly boarded on ship by Parthia of Jerusalem, just {{to protect it from}} the invading Arabs. It is said that the emperor had a fear of water. and a pontoon bridge was made for Heraclius to cross the Bosphorus to Constantinople. After abandoning Syria, the Emperor began to concentrate on his remaining forces for the defence of Anatolia and Egypt instead. Byzantine Armenia fell to the Muslims in 638–39, after which Heraclius created a <b>buffer</b> <b>zone</b> in central Anatolia by ordering all the forts east of Tarsus to be evacuated.|$|E

Locus Maponi is possibly the modern Lochmabenstane near Gretna which continued {{to be used as}} a muster point well into the historic period. Two of the others indicate meeting places of the Damnonii and Selgovae, and the fourth, Manavi may be Clackmannan. From the time of Caracalla onwards, no further attempts were made to permanently occupy territory in Scotland.|$|E

Even though the special police units which captured the Plitvice Lakes area did pull out on 2 April, a newly established Croatian police station, staffed by 90 officers, remained in place. The police station was blockaded by the JNA three months later, and captured in late August 1991.|$|E
