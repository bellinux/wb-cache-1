Once the core hydrogen is exhausted in 5.4 billion years, the Sun will expand into a subgiant phase and slowly double in size over {{about half a}} billion years. It will then expand more rapidly over about half a billion years until it is over two hundred times larger than today {{and a couple of}} thousand times more luminous. This then starts the red-giant-branch phase where the Sun will spend around a billion years and lose around a third of its mass.|$|E

The first {{of its kind in the}} region, the Center provides a unique opportunity for individuals to take an active approach to a healthier life. Truyu Aesthetic Center, with locations in Grand Forks, East Grand Forks and across the region, offers surgical and non-surgical procedures, services and products under the support of Altru. Altru Health System is the result of a 1997 merger of United Hospital (formerly Deaconess and St. Michael's Hospitals) and the Grand Forks Clinic.|$|E
5|$|Air {{contains}} water vapor, and {{the amount}} of water in a given mass of dry air, known as the mixing ratio, is measured in grams of water per kilogram of dry air (g/kg). The amount of moisture in air is also commonly reported as relative humidity; which is the percentage of the total water vapor air can hold at a particular air temperature. How much water vapor a parcel of air can contain <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> saturated (100%relative humidity) and forms into a cloud (a group of visible and tiny water and ice particles suspended above the Earth's surface) depends on its temperature. Warmer air can contain more water vapor than cooler air before becoming saturated. Therefore, one way to saturate a parcel of air is to cool it. The dew point is the temperature to which a parcel must be cooled in order to become saturated.|$|E

5|$|The {{flowers of}} B.sessilis {{have a number}} of adaptations that serve to {{encourage}} outcrossing. Firstly, they are protandrous: a flower's pollen is released around 72 hours <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> itself receptive to pollen, by which time around half of its pollen has lost its viability. Secondly, the period of maximum nectar production closely matches the period during which the flower is sexually active, so honeyeaters are enticed to visit at the most opportune time for pollination. This has proven an effective strategy: almost all pollen is removed within two to three hours of presentation. In addition, honeyeaters tend to move between inflorescences on different plants, rather than between inflorescences on the same plant, at least in high density sites. These factors combine to make it fairly unusual for a flower to be fertilised by its own pollen. When self-fertilisation does occur, whether autogamous or geitonogamous, the resulting seed is almost always aborted, and the species ultimately achieves an outcrossing rate of nearly 100%, at least in high density sites. Limited data for low-density sites, where honeyeaters move from plant to plant less frequently, suggest more of a mixed-mating system.|$|E

25|$|To compete internationally on {{the senior}} level, skaters {{must be at}} least 15 before July 1 of the {{preceding}} year. To be eligible for junior-level events, a skater {{must be at least}} 13 but under 19 before that date (or 21 for male pair skaters and ice dancers). A skater must meet the age requirement <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> July 1 in their place of birth.

Many countries have no age requirements for domestic non-ISU competitions, thus, some skaters compete at the senior level nationally while not eligible for international competition.|$|E

At {{the end of the}} concurrency comes the end of the business route. CR49 terminates just north of Salamanca as US219 enters Peth. In Peth, CR67 leaves to the right. In Great Valley, NY98 leaves to the north. US219 enters Ellicottville and intersects with NY242. The two roads become concurrent for a short distance when US219 turns to the north. Several Cattaraugus County roads intersect in the distance from Ellicottville to the Erie County border. The first is CR75, the second is a concurrency between CR53 and CR85, and the third is CR12, which has a brief concurrency with US219 before leaving to the east. After an intersection with CR77, US219 has a brief concurrency with CR85 <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> a limited-access highway and crosses Cattaraugus Creek as it enters Erie County.|$|E
25|$|Wetsuits {{are limited}} {{in their ability to}} {{preserve}} warmth by three factors: the wearer is still exposed to some water, the suit is compressed by the ambient pressure, reducing effectiveness at depth, and the insulating neoprene can only be made to a certain thickness <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> impractical to don and wear. The thickest commercially available wetsuits are usually 10mm thick. Other common thicknesses are 7mm, 5mm, 3mm, and 1mm. A 1mm suit provides very little warmth and is usually considered a dive skin, rather than a wetsuit. Wetsuits can be made using more than one thickness of neoprene, to put the most thickness where it will be most effective in keeping the diver warm. A similar effect can be achieved by layering wetsuits of different coverage. Some makes of neoprene are softer, lighter and more compressible than others for the same thickness, and are more suitable for wetsuits for non-diving purposes as they will compress and lose their insulating value more quickly under pressure, though they are more comfortable for surface sports because they are more flexible and allow more freedom of movement.|$|E
