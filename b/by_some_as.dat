5|$|Bodyline, {{also known}} as fast leg theory bowling, was a cricketing tactic devised by the English cricket team for their 1932–33 Ashes tour of Australia, {{specifically}} to combat the extraordinary batting skill of Australia's Don Bradman. England's use of a tactic perceived <b>by</b> <b>some</b> <b>as</b> overly aggressive or even unfair ultimately threatened diplomatic {{relations between the two}} countries before the situation was calmed.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{controversy}} surrounding his consecration, Bishop Robinson was not invited to the 2008 Lambeth Conferences by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams. A group of conservative bishops (including Akinola and Duncan) who opposed Robinson's consecration gathered in Jerusalem one month prior to Lambeth 2008, at the Global Anglican Future Conference, an event which is perceived <b>by</b> <b>some</b> <b>as</b> schismatic.|$|E
5|$|Early {{comic strips}} also avoided overt {{treatment}} of gay issues, though examples of homosexual subtext have been identified. The 1938–1939 edition of Milton Caniff's Terry and the Pirates features a primary villain, Sanjak, {{who has been}} interpreted <b>by</b> <b>some</b> <b>as</b> a lesbian with designs on the hero's girlfriend.|$|E

5|$|Hemorrhage from a Rathke's cleft cyst, {{a remnant}} of Rathke's pouch that {{normally}} regresses after embryological development, may cause symptoms that are indistinguishable from pituitary apoplexy. Pituitary apoplexy is regarded <b>by</b> <b>some</b> <b>as</b> distinct from Sheehan's syndrome, where the pituitary undergoes infarction {{as a result of}} prolonged very low blood pressure, particularly when caused by bleeding after childbirth. This condition usually occurs {{in the absence of a}} tumor. Others regard Sheehan's syndrome as a form of pituitary apoplexy.|$|E
5|$|In 1904, {{there was}} a {{religious}} revival (known <b>by</b> <b>some</b> <b>as</b> the 1904–1905 Welsh Revival, or simply The 1904 Revival) which started through the evangelism of Evan Roberts and saw {{large numbers of people}} converting to nonconformist and Anglican Christianity, sometimes whole communities. Roberts' style of preaching became the blueprint for new religious bodies such as Pentecostalism and the Apostolic Church. The Apostolic Church holds its annual Apostolic Conference in Swansea each year, usually in August.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{loitering}} munitions {{were not}} {{referred to as}} such but rather as suicide UAVs or loitering missiles. Different sources point at different projects as originating the weapon category. The early 1980s initial Israeli Delilah variants or the failed US AGM-136 Tacit Rainbow program are mentioned by some sources. Alternatively, the late 1980s IAI Harpy which was widely exported is considered <b>by</b> <b>some</b> <b>as</b> the first loitering munition system.|$|E

5|$|President Mutharika {{was seen}} <b>by</b> <b>some</b> <b>as</b> {{increasingly}} autocratic and dismissive of human rights, and in July 2011 protests over {{high costs of}} living, devolving foreign relations, poor governance {{and a lack of}} foreign exchange reserves erupted. The protests left 18 people dead and at least 44 others suffering from gunshot wounds. In April 2012, Mutharika died of a heart attack; the presidential title was taken over by former Vice-President Joyce Banda.|$|E

5|$|Taqiya ("dissimulation") was {{practiced by}} some Bábís. It was {{justified}} <b>by</b> <b>some</b> <b>as</b> {{a response to}} the often violent oppression the community faced.

5|$|The Act 3 ballet is {{regarded}} <b>by</b> <b>some</b> <b>as</b> {{the first of}} the ballets blancs (whereby the principal ballerina and the corps de ballet are all clothed in white) which became a favourite of the nineteenth-century repertoire.

5|$|The King's sudden {{onset of}} {{insanity}} was seen <b>by</b> <b>some</b> <b>as</b> {{a sign of}} divine anger and punishment, and by others {{as the result of}} magic. Modern historians speculate that he may have suffered from the onset of paranoid schizophrenia. The comatose king was returned to Le Mans, where Guillaume de Harsigny—a venerated and well-educated 92-year-old physician—was summoned to treat him. Charles regained consciousness and his fever subsided; he was gradually returned to Paris in September.|$|E
5|$|The whole {{trial was}} seen <b>by</b> <b>some</b> <b>as</b> a {{political}} trial, {{inspired by the}} Belgian establishment.

5|$|Albanian {{intelligence}} groups informed Skanderbeg—the main {{leader of}} the revolt—that a large Ottoman army was preparing to march into Albania, the number of which was reported <b>by</b> <b>some</b> <b>as</b> being as high as 170,000. This army, however, {{is likely to have}} contained no more than 80,000 soldiers. Nevertheless, Murad marched his army into Monastir. Skanderbeg urgently called for material aid Venice. The answer, however, was negative. Instead, the only aid received came from the Neapolitans and the Ragusans. Nonetheless, Murad soon marched into Ohrid and Black Drin valley, traveling near Svetigrad. In response, Skanderbeg strengthened the garrisons of Krujë, Stellushi, Svetigrad, and Berat by ordering the populations around these fortress to take up arms.|$|E
