Brugge were without {{a number of key}} players, such as Raoul Lambert, whose {{inclusion}} in the Brugge squad was rumoured before the final but never materialised. Liverpool were also without a few players. Tommy Smith, who had scored in the previous season's final, was out after dropping a pick-axe on his foot and <b>breaking</b> <b>a</b> toe.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{the use of}} Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to attack the {{classical}} ciphers. We use frequency analysis as our basic tool. First we investigate the MCMC algorithm to <b>break</b> <b>a</b> simple substitution cipher. Then the algorithm is modified to <b>break</b> <b>a</b> simple transposition cipher. Our results on the transposition cipher are better than the existing methods such as simulated annealing, genetic algorithm and tabu search. We also extend the algorithms to <b>break</b> <b>a</b> simple substitution-transposition cipher up to key length 40. ...|$|R

Fingleton started as a sports reporter, and had a narrow escape when he was sacked by Robert Clyde Packer for <b>breaking</b> <b>a</b> pot, but then reinstated.

6000|$|March {{observed}} {{with a degree}} of mortification that the talk was very little of it in the New York press; there the references to the novel enterprise were slight and cold. But Fulkerson said: [...] "Don't mind that, old man. It's the whole country that makes or <b>breaks</b> <b>a</b> thing like this; New York has {{very little to do with}} it. Now if it were a play, it would be different. New York does make or <b>break</b> <b>a</b> play; but it doesn't make or <b>break</b> <b>a</b> book; it doesn't make or <b>break</b> <b>a</b> magazine. The great mass of the readers are outside of New York, and the rural districts are what we have got to go for. They don't read much in New York; they write, and talk about what they've written.

Second half goals from Jack Dyson and Bobby Johnstone gave Manchester City a 3–1 victory.
