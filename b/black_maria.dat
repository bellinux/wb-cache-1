In August 1894, the film premiered at the Kinetoscope Exhibition Company's parlor at 83 Nassau Street in New York. A half-dozen expanded Kinetoscope machines each showed a different round of the fight for a dime, meaning sixty cents to see the complete bout. For a planned series of follow-up fights (of which the outcome of at least the first was fixed), the Lathams signed famous heavyweight James J. Corbett, stipulating that his image could not be recorded by any other Kinetoscope company—the first movie star contract.|$|E

500|$|On April 14, 1894, {{a public}} Kinetoscope parlor was opened by the Holland Bros. in New York City at 1155 Broadway, {{on the corner}} of 27th Street—the first {{commercial}} motion picture house. The venue had ten machines, set up in parallel rows of five, each showing a different movie. For 25 cents a viewer could see all the films in either row; half a dollar gave access to the entire bill. The machines were purchased from the new Kinetoscope Company, which had contracted with Edison for their production; the firm, headed by Norman C. Raff and Frank R. Gammon, included among its investors Andrew M. Holland, one of the entrepreneurial siblings, and Edison's former business chief, Alfred O. Tate. The ten films that comprise the first commercial movie program, all shot at the <b>Black</b> <b>Maria,</b> were descriptively titled: Barber Shop, Bertoldi (mouth support) (Ena Bertoldi, a British vaudeville contortionist), Bertoldi (table contortion), Blacksmiths, Roosters (some manner of cock fight), Highland Dance, Horse Shoeing, Sandow (Eugen Sandow, a German strongman managed by Florenz Ziegfeld), Trapeze, and Wrestling. As historian Charles Musser describes, a [...] "profound transformation of American life and performance culture" [...] had begun.|$|E
500|$|The {{premiere of}} the {{completed}} Kinetoscope was held not at the Chicago World's Fair, as originally scheduled, but at the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences on May 9, 1893. The first film publicly shown on the system was Blacksmith Scene (aka Blacksmiths); directed by Dickson and shot by Heise, it was produced at the new Edison moviemaking studio, known as the <b>Black</b> <b>Maria.</b> Despite extensive promotion, a major display of the Kinetoscope, involving as many as twenty-five machines, never {{took place at the}} Chicago exposition. Kinetoscope production had been delayed in part because of Dickson's absence of more than eleven weeks early in the year with a nervous breakdown. Robinson argues that [...] "peculation that a single Kinetoscope reached the Fair seems to be conclusively dismissed by an 1894 leaflet issued for the launching of the invention in London," [...] which states, [...] "the Kinetoscope was not perfected in time for the great Fair." [...] Hendricks, in contrast, refers to accounts in the Scientific American of July 21 and October 21, 1893, that constitute evidence no less [...] "conclusive" [...] that one Kinetoscope did make it to the fair. The weight of evidence supports Hendricks; as fair historian Stanley Appelbaum states, [...] "Doubt has been cast on the reports of [...] actual presence at the fair, but these reports are numerous and circumstantial" [...] (Appelbaum does err in claiming that the device was [...] "first shown at the Exposition").|$|E

500|$|Just {{three months}} after the {{commercial}} debut of the motion picture came the first recorded instance of motion picture censorship. The film in question showed a performance by the Spanish dancer Carmencita, a New York music hall star {{since the beginning of the}} decade. According to one description of her live act, she [...] "communicated an intense sexuality across the footlights that led male reporters to write long, exuberant columns about her performance"—articles that would later be reproduced in the Edison film catalog. The Kinetoscope movie of her dance, shot at the <b>Black</b> <b>Maria</b> in mid-March 1894, was playing in the New Jersey resort town Asbury Park by summer. The town's founder, James A. Bradley, a real estate developer and leading member of the Methodist community, had recently been elected a state senator: [...] "The Newark Evening News of 17 July 1894 reported that [...] Bradley...was so shocked by the glimpse of Carmencita's ankles and lace that he complained to Mayor Ten Broeck. The showman was thereupon ordered to withdraw the offending film, which he replaced with Boxing Cats." [...] The following month, a San Francisco exhibitor was arrested for a Kinetoscope operation [...] "alleged to be indecent." [...] The group whose disgruntlement occasioned the arrest was the Pacific Society for the Suppression of Vice, whose targets included [...] "illicit literature, obscene pictures and books, the sale of morphine, cocaine, opium, tobacco and liquors to minors, lottery tickets, etc.," [...] and which proudly took credit for having [...] "caused 70 arrests and obtained 48 convictions" [...] in a recent two-month span.|$|E
500|$|The Kinetoscope {{was also}} gaining notice {{on the other}} side of the Atlantic. In the summer of 1894, it was {{demonstrated}} at 20, boulevard Poissonnière in Paris; this was one of the primary inspirations to the Lumière brothers, who would go on to develop the first commercially successful movie projection system. On October 17, 1894, the first Kinetoscope parlor outside the United States opened in London. Dissemination of the system proceeded rapidly in Europe, as Edison had left his patents unprotected overseas. The most likely reason was the technology's reliance on a variety of foreign innovations and a consequent belief that patent applications would have little chance of success. An alternative view, however, used to be popular: The 1971 edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica, for instance, claims that Edison [...] "apparently thought so little of his invention that he failed to pay the $150 that would have granted him an international copyright [...]" [...] As recently as 2004, Andrew Rausch stated that Edison [...] "balked at a $150 fee for overseas patents" [...] and [...] "saw little commercial value in the Kinetoscope." [...] Given that Edison, as much a businessman as an inventor, spent approximately $24,000 on the system's development and went so far as to build a facility expressly for moviemaking before his U.S. patent was awarded, Rausch's interpretation is not widely shared by present-day scholars. Whatever the cause, two Greek entrepreneurs, George Georgiades and George Tragides, took advantage of the opening. Already successfully operating a pair of London movie parlors with Edison Kinetoscopes, they commissioned English inventor and manufacturer Robert W. Paul to make copies of them. After fulfilling the Georgiades–Tragides contract, Paul decided to go into the movie business himself, proceeding to make dozens of additional Kinetoscope reproductions. Paul's work would result in a series of important innovations in both camera and exhibition technology. Meanwhile, plans were advancing at the <b>Black</b> <b>Maria</b> to realize Edison's goal of a motion picture system uniting image with sound.|$|E

2500|$|Balmoral Place {{was about}} two hundred metres from the Police Station in Harrison Road. The police office was quite large. At ground floor level there was the main {{reception}} behind double entrance doors. Further in were various rooms used for storage. At this level were the cells for the prisoners just arrested and for those prisoners attending the magistrates' court in the building. There was no basement in the building and this was why the court was on the first floor. Access from the cells to the court was up a short flight of stairs which had a double doored cage around them and a door at the stairs' base. This was for security and allowed the magistrates or judge to 'send the prisoner down'. There were twelve cells in total and these were for short duration use only. The prisoners travelled to and from Leeds prison. There was a large courtyard between the court building and the police station which was used for police parades. The parade ground was also used for exercising the horses and housed four stables. From reception, going {{up the steps to}} the first floor the first item encountered was the police enquiry desk. Behind the desk were three corridors. One corridor to the left housed the typists' room, a small room for the senior typist and a store room. There was also a sergeants anteroom and the sergeants main room. There was another corridor to the right which housed the chief typist, an inspector, a chief inspector and a superintendent. At the far end was the chief constable's office which had a constable seated at its entrance day and night. The Criminal Investigation Department was in another corridor. There was one more set of stairs at the rear of the police station. Letters from local residents in the Press i.e. [...] "The Halifax Courier", wrote that a measure of much needed discipline continue in the Halifax Force. Richardson was considered to be the man to bring this about and he had acquired the reputation of being a strict disciplinarian which continued throughout his career. He presented his first financial accounts to the Halifax Watch Committee on 28 September 1903 where the cost of the Constabulary per week averaged £164.1s.7d. The Police were paid weekly at this time. Within weeks Richardson persuaded the Watch Committee to purchase a <b>Black</b> <b>Maria,</b> a horse and a secure trailer fitted with lockable cubicles for transporting prisoners to and from the court in Halifax to Leeds prison. He insisted the design was adjusted so that it could rapidly become an ambulance should the need arise. In 1905 he attended a meeting in Bradford of the Chief Constables Association. An official photograph by the CCA shows him, his father and his brother among 40 attendees. A similar meeting of Chief Constables in the Association took place in Brighton, Sussex, in 1906, which he attended.

5000|$|The Tono Maria {{story has}} become {{prominent}} in the topic of black feminist thought as her sexuality and unique features, both cultural attire and physical shape as a woman of color, were used by the white people of London to “uplift” the white English lady.

" Mammy served a double purpose in the sexual and racial iconography of slavery and particularlyin the post-slavery United States. On the one hand, she represented unquestioning loyalty to white supremacist structures of power in the form of the domestic service she performed in the plantation great house for the master and mistress and their children. On the other hand, as feminist scholar Barbara Christian noted in the documentary Ethnic Notions, the mammy stereotype effectively desexualized <b>black</b> women. <b>Maria</b> St. John, in the essay "Cinematic and Fantasmatic Contours of Mammy: A Psychoanalytic Exploration of Race, Fantasy, and Cultural Explo-ration, " presents a psychoanalytic analysis of mammy as a source of fantasy "in the service ofthe construction ofwhiteness " (1991 : 1).
