5|$|A {{coalition}} Government of National Union {{was installed}} {{in the capital of}} Vientiane, but it soon ran into difficulties. By the 2 October 1962 deadline for the removal of foreign troops, the North Vietnamese had pulled out only 40 personnel, leaving approximately 6,000 troops in the eastern half of the country. Meanwhile, rightist elements (in control of the army) opposed the new government. The U.S. played its part by increasing its assistance to the right by covertly supplying the army through Thailand. Despite another international accord, Laos remained ensnared <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> and territorial ambitions of communist neighbors, the security concerns of Thailand and the United States, and geographic fate.|$|E

5|$|After {{a two-month}} stay in Bucharest, Vasil Levski {{returned}} to Bulgaria {{for a second}} tour, lasting from 1 May to 26 August 1869. On this tour he carried proclamations printed in Romania <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> figure Ivan Kasabov. They legitimised Levski as the representative of a Bulgarian provisional government. Vasil Levski travelled to Nikopol, Pleven, Karlovo, Plovdiv, Pazardzhik, Perushtitsa, Stara Zagora, Chirpan, Sliven, Lovech, Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Sevlievo and Tryavna. According to some researchers, Levski established the earliest of his secret committees during this tour, but those assumptions are based on uncertain data.|$|E
5|$|After independence, the Parliament of Singapore {{remained}} fully elected until 1984, when {{amendments to}} the Constitution and the Parliamentary Elections Act were passed to provide for Non-constituency Members of Parliament ("NCMPs"). NCMPs, who are declared elected by the returning officer, consist of the best performing losers in general elections based on the percentage of votes cast. The scheme ensures that opposition representation is accounted for in the Parliament. In 1990, yet another type of unelected Member was introduced – the Nominated Member of Parliament ("NMP"). These non-partisan Members were brought in to provide alternate views on policies that differed from the opinions espoused <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> parties represented in Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Because of the South Vietnamese {{need for}} {{security}} which precluded thorough planning, an inability <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> {{and military leaders}} of the U.S. and South Vietnam to face military realities, and poor execution, Operation Lam Son 719 collapsed when faced by the determined resistance of a skillful foe. The campaign was {{a disaster for the}} ARVN, demonstrating deficiencies in ARVN military leaders and that the best units of the ARVN could be defeated by PAVN and destroying the confidence that had been built up over the previous three years.|$|E

During their 80-day journey across the frozen land to return to Karhide, Ai learns to understand and love Estraven.|$|E

The bicentenary of Waterloo has prompted renewed attention to the geopolitical and economic legacy of the battle and the century of relative transatlantic peace which followed.|$|E

5|$|On 5 September 1882 Shaw {{attended}} {{a meeting at}} the Memorial Hall, Farringdon, addressed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> economist Henry George. Shaw then read George's book Progress and Poverty, which awakened his interest in economics. He began attending meetings of the Social Democratic Federation (SDF), where he discovered the writings of Karl Marx, and thereafter spent much of 1883 reading Das Kapital. He was not impressed by the SDF's founder, H. M. Hyndman, whom he found autocratic, ill-tempered and lacking leadership qualities. Shaw doubted the ability of the SDF to harness the working classes into an effective radical movement and did not join it—he preferred, he said, to work with his intellectual equals.|$|E
5|$|Rivette {{was unhappy}} with La Religieuse and re-evaluated his career, {{developing}} a unique cinematic style with L'Amour fou. Influenced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> turmoil of May 1968, improvisational theater and an in-depth interview with Jean Renoir, Rivette began working with large groups of actors on character development and allowing events to unfold on camera. This technique led to the thirteen-hour Out 1. His films of the 1970s, such as Celine and Julie Go Boating, often incorporated fantasy and were better-regarded. After attempting to make four consecutive films, however, Rivette had a nervous breakdown and his career slowed for several years, with films such as Merry-Go-Round and Le Pont du Nord being difficult productions.|$|E

5|$|The aerial {{rules of}} {{engagement}} applied in Laos (which prescribed the offensive action of pilots and the locations and circumstances under which offensive actions could be taken) were created to protect the civilian population of the country.

The rules were constantly altered and elaborated upon <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> decision makers in Washington and Vientiane and bore little relation to the reality on the ground.

5|$|The {{lack of an}} heir {{who could}} feasibly provide a new {{direction}} for the nation also diminished the long-term prospects of the Brazilian monarchy. The Emperor loved his daughter Isabel, but he considered {{the idea of a}} female successor as antithetical to the role required of Brazil's ruler. He viewed the death of his two sons as being a sign that the Empire was destined to be supplanted. Resistance to accepting a female ruler was also shared <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> establishment. Even though the Constitution allowed female succession to the throne, Brazil was still very traditional, and only a male successor was thought capable as head of state.|$|E
5|$|This {{ambiguity}} of character was further exacerbated by his remoteness, {{and as he}} grew older, he increasingly displayed a preference for solitude, which may have stemmed from his isolated upbringing.
