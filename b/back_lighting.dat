5|$|For the Meteora shoots, a Greek bishop {{was paid}} to allow filming in the monasteries, but the uninformed Eastern Orthodox monks were mostly {{critical}} of production rolling in their installations. After a trial in the Greek Supreme Court, {{it was decided that}} the monks' only property were the interiors – the exteriors and surrounding landscapes were from the local government. In protest, the monks remained shut inside the monasteries during the shooting, and tried to sabotage production as much as possible, hanging their washing out of their windows and covering the principal monastery with plastic bunting and flags to spoil the shots, and placing oil drums to prevent the film crew from landing helicopters. The production team solved the problem with <b>back</b> <b>lighting,</b> matte paintings, and building both a similar scenographic monastery on a nearby unoccupied rock, and a monastery set in Pinewood.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} three-point lighting set-up routinely used in filmmaking {{and television}} production {{is also used}} on daytime soap operas, sometimes with accentuated <b>back</b> <b>lighting</b> to lift actors out of the background. This is useful in programs like soap operas, which are shot on videotape in small interior sets. The backlight is frequently more subtle on filmed productions shot on location and in larger sets.|$|E

The set features a disco ball, vintage stage lights, the set up of the instruments {{in the background and}} other elements present in the disco era. The style of the music video greatly resembles the performance held at the 2013 Billboard Music Awards. Following the 1970s theme, the video is unavailable in high definition, and is rather shown in standard-definition quality and with a 4:3 aspect ratio. For EW, Kyle Anderson, pointed out [...] "It’s all there: The suits, the setting, and the bong-water video effects", while Melinda Newman for HitFix noticed that [...] "to complete the look, the video features special effects, including crude <b>back</b> <b>lighting,</b> wacky dissolves, geometric shapes, [...] and a Space Wars-like background". All of these and the videotape wear were also added to the footage to bring a retro-feel to it.|$|E
5000|$|The PV-100 did {{not have}} a <b>back</b> <b>light.</b> While the <b>back</b> <b>light</b> was {{available}} on PV-200 onwards, Casio by default did not allow the back-light to remain on more than 30 seconds. Casio did not recommend extending the duration of the <b>back</b> <b>light</b> citing damage and battery drain. as A third party application <b>back</b> <b>light</b> extender add in was required to keep the <b>back</b> <b>light</b> on beyond the default duration. The back-light was Casio's trade marked EL-back-light, which is an electro-luminescent panel that causes the entire face to glow.|$|R
40|$|<b>Back</b> <b>Light</b> Unit (BLU) and Color Filter {{are the two}} key {{components}} for the perfect color display of Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) device. LCD can not light actively itself, so a form of illumination, <b>Back</b> <b>Light</b> Unit is needed for its display. The color filter which consists of RGB primary colors, is used to generate three basic colors for LCD display. Traditional CCFL <b>back</b> <b>light</b> source has several disadvantages, while LED <b>back</b> <b>light</b> technology makes LCD obtain quite higher display quality than the CCFL <b>back</b> <b>light.</b> LCD device based on LED <b>back</b> <b>light</b> owns promoted efficiency of display. Moreover it can generate color gamut above 100 % of the NTSC specification. Especially, we put forward an idea of Color Filter-Less technology that we design a film which is patterned of red and green emitting phosphors, then make it be excited by a blue light LED panel we fabricate, for its special emitting mechanism, this film can emit RGB basic color, therefore replace the color filter of LCD device. This frame typically benefits for lighting uniformity and provide pretty high light utilization ratio. Also simplifies <b>back</b> <b>light</b> structure thus cut down the expenses.

50|$|In {{lighting}} design, backlighting is {{the process}} of illuminating the subject from the back. In other words, the lighting instrument and the viewer face each other, with the subject in between. This creates a glowing effect on the edges of the subject, while other areas are darker. The backlight can be a natural or artificial source of light. When artificial, the <b>back</b> <b>light</b> is usually placed directly behind the subject in a 4-point <b>lighting</b> setup. A <b>back</b> <b>light,</b> which lights foreground elements from the rear, is {{not to be confused with}} a background light, which lights background elements (such as scenery).|$|R

50|$|The {{apparatus}} {{consists of}} a substantial table {{with an array of}} menacing metal spikes suspended above it. The basic premise is that the performer will be restrained on the table and must escape before the spikes are released and allowed to fall. A curtain is drawn around the apparatus to obscure the performer from view while he or she attempts the escape. The sequence of events is arranged so that it initially appears the spikes fall before the performer has had time to get out from under them; however, the curtain is then pulled back to reveal the performer free and unharmed. Sometimes a scrim is used instead of a curtain and, with <b>back</b> <b>lighting,</b> it is arranged that the audience see the silhouetted shadow of the performer struggling to escape before the spikes fall.|$|E
