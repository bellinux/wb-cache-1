Because they didn't see the ending, Didi and Stu decide to go out to see the movie again next week, but at a different theater. As Grandpa Lou eats a candy bar in the back seat, Tommy takes notice of a flashing Reptar billboard as they drive by.|$|E
5|$|Van den Berg and {{his colleagues}} {{designed}} the EG Vapor Crystal Growth System experiment apparatus for a Space Shuttle flight. The experiment required an in-flight operator and NASA decided {{that it would be}} easier to train a crystal growth scientist to become an astronaut, than it would be the other way around. NASA asked EG and Van den Berg to compile a list of eight people who would qualify to perform the science experiments in space and to become a Payload Specialist. Van den Berg and his chief, Dr. Harold A. Lamonds could only come up with seven names. Lamonds subsequently proposed adding Van den Berg to the list, joking with Van den Berg that due to his age, huge glasses and little strength, he would probably be dropped during the first selection round; <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>they</b> would have eight names. Van den Berg agreed to be added to the list, but didn't really consider himself being selected to be a realistic scenario.|$|E
25|$|In the Annales of Tacitus, it is {{mentioned}} {{that after the}} defeat of 9 BC Augustus divided the Germans by making a separate peace with the Sugambri and Suebi under their king Maroboduus. This is the first mention of any permanent king of the Suebi. However, Maroboduus' people was in most sources {{referred to as the}} king of the Marcomanni, a tribal name that had already been distinct from the Suebi in Caesar's time. (As discussed above, it is not sure which Suebi were the Suebi of Caesar, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>they</b> were distinguished from the Marcomanni.) However, Maroboduus was also described as Suebian, and his association with the Marcomanni more specifically comes after the Langobards and Semnones were specifically said to have left his kingdom, having previously been under his rule. At some point in this period the Marcomanni had come to be settled in the forested regions once inhabited by the Boii, in and around Bohemia, under his rule.|$|E
60|$|Then, probably, they huddled {{together}} {{and looked into}} one another's faces for the comfort which was not there. Hitherto they had been confined on board of separate vessels, {{so that they could}} not tell whether their relatives and friends were prisoners along with them. <b>But</b> now, <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>they</b> could tell that many had been left behind or transported to other regions.|$|R

500|$|Edward Falco, a playwriting {{professor}} at Virginia Tech, {{has acknowledged that}} Cho wrote both plays in his class. The plays are fewer than 12 pages long and have several grammatical and typographical errors. Falco believed that Cho was drawn to writing because of his speech difficulties. Falco said of the plays, [...] "They're not good writing, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>they</b> are a form of communication." [...] Another professor who taught Cho characterized his work as [...] "very adolescent" [...] and [...] "silly", with attempts at [...] "slapstick comedy" [...] and [...] "elements of violence".|$|E
500|$|Poppy's {{introduction}} to EastEnders in what Jody Thompson of the Daily Mail described as [...] "a bizarre and utterly irrelevant chat" [...] was criticised by Daniella Graham of the Metro, {{who said that}} [...] "viewers were left questioning why on earth anyone thought this pointless sub-plot was necessary". In contrast, The Press and Journal Derek Lord deemed Poppy to have been [...] "a welcome addition to the show"; he wrote that, [...] "as a double act, [...] no Morecambe and Wise, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>they</b> bring an element of something approaching humour to the otherwise soul-destroying drabness of the London soap". Jim Shelley of the Daily Mirror labelled Poppy the [...] "Optimist of the week" [...] for her line [...] "I bet it's really nice here when they ain't having a funeral", and [...] "Delicate flower of the week" [...] for her [...] "That is so well tragic innit?" [...] when commenting on Tommy Moon's death. Stuart Heritage from guardian.co.uk said that Poppy made an impact in her two episodes, branding her as [...] "perhaps the greatest television bit-part character of the modern age". Heritage added that she had [...] "the name of a Bond girl, the hair of a Winkleman {{and the voice of}} a Katie Price robot running low on batteries"; describing her as [...] "electrifying", he hoped that she would return. Katy Moon from Inside Soap discussed Poppy's original two episode stint: ...|$|E

5000|$|According to Ahanyi, K.O.K. Onyioha, “Paganism and heathenism {{were two}} of the most common words used by western colonialists and their Christian missionaries who {{accompanied}} them, when referring to the religious beliefs that existed in Africa. This was because of their ignorance of the principles and the doctrines for which this religion stood. <b>But</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> now, <b>they</b> know and are aware that what they once mischievously labeled as paganism and heathenism were neither pagan nor heathen but a religion and spirituality, which had stimulated the growth of great cultures and civilizations in Africa.” ...|$|R
5000|$|They signed truces in 1882, 1884, and 1887, {{dividing}} {{the country into}} exclusive territories to avoid disputes. <b>But</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> twice, <b>they</b> decided to pool their resources and perform together. In 1880, Forepaugh and Barnum combined their shows for a Philadelphia engagement. In 1887, Forepaugh obtained permission to perform in Madison Square Garden, a venue that Barnum considered to be exclusively his but had forfeited by his neglect to renew his contract. [...] A compromise was negotiated, and once again the two circuses presented a combined performance in the largest circus performance to date.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} not," [...] {{admitted}} Geoffrey, rather grimly. [...] "Neither {{did any of}} them ever do much towards the making of history. All of them were generally too busy protecting their property or seizing that of their neighbors! <b>But,</b> <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> when <b>they</b> fought, {{they seem to have}} fought for the losing side, and, according to tradition, paid for it dearly. However, to change the subject, is it fair to hold any man responsible for his ancestors' shortcomings? They have gone back to the dust long ago, and it is the present that concerns us." ...|$|R
6000|$|The men {{of my own}} stock, [...] Bitter {{bad they}} may be, <b>But,</b> <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>they</b> hear the things I hear, [...] And see the things I see; And {{whatever}} I think of them and their likes [...] They think of the likes of me.|$|E
60|$|That passage comforts me. These, then, are my ideas.

60|$|As I let my eyes roam {{over the}} scene I {{suddenly}} {{became aware of}} figures moving upon the flat top of a far-distant butte.

6000|$|One minor point {{which must}} strike {{the reader of}} Pepys is how musical a nation the English of that day appear to have been. Every one {{seems to have had}} command of some instrument, many of several. Part-singing was common. There is not much of Charles the Second's days which we need envy, <b>but</b> there, <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>they</b> seem to have had the {{advantage}} of us. It was real music, too--music of dignity and tenderness--with words which were worthy of such treatment. This cult may have been the last remains of those mediaeval pre-Reformation days when the English Church choirs were, as I have read somewhere, the most famous in Europe. A strange thing this for a land which in the whole of last century has produced no single master of the first rank! ...|$|R
60|$|Now I {{understood}} it all. In their last despair, maddened {{by the loss}} of fathers, husbands, and children, by their cruel fate, and standing face to face with certain death, the fire of the old faith had burnt up in their savage hearts. There was the temple, there were the stone and implements of sacrifice, and there to their hands were the victims taken in war. They would glut a last revenge, they would sacrifice to their fathers' gods as their fathers had done before them, and the victims should be taken from their own victorious foes. Ay, they must die, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> the <b>least</b> <b>they</b> would seek the Mansions of the Sun made holy by the blood of the accursed Teule.|$|R
5000|$|Matthew E. McCarthy, Pacific's chief {{executive}} and biggest shareholder, explained the campaign: [...] "It's basically honest. We spoof the passengers' concern, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> we admit <b>they</b> have it." [...] Philip H. Dougherty, writing in the Business and Finance section of the May 1 edition of The New York Times, described the advertisements as [...] "rather shocking". Objections to the unorthodox campaign were raised at a May 1967 stockholders meeting, and two Pacific Air Lines executives resigned {{in the wake of}} the controversy.|$|R

50|$|Taj also {{published}} a magazine called the Kahkashan from the publishing firm of Daru Ishat which he owned. Another contemporary writer, Munshi Premchand, contributed stories to this magazine in Urdu. It so happened that an article which Premchand had submitted {{was on the}} same theme on which Taj was also writing a story. Then Taj decided to drop his article in favour of the one written by Premchand, who then expressed his regret <b>but</b> said that <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>they</b> both {{were on the same}} wavelength.|$|R
2500|$|The main Japanese {{position}} was centred on Sanananda and Giruwa. Defensive positions were {{located on the}} coastal flanks at Gona, to the west, and Buna to the east. [...] A further {{position was}} located forward, astride the Sanananda–Soputa track, about [...] from the coast. These were a series of posts which, apart from covering the approach to Sanananda, also denied the use of two branch tracks to Cape Killerton. The three outer defensive positions {{can be considered as}} being located at the corners of a triangle, while the main position was located at the centre of the base. [...] These positions were each separate <b>but,</b> initially <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>they</b> could be readily resupplied and reinforced from the main position. The outer positions covered the likely approaches to Sanananda–Giruwa while the swamp effectively barred any attempt to by-pass these positions.|$|R
6000|$|The tent {{was nearly}} dark, and Richard {{could only see}} {{the outline of the}} tall form laid prostrate, but the voice he had feared never to hear again, spoke, though slowly and wearily, and a hand was held out.

[...] "Poor boy, they must needs have at thee ere the breath was out of my body; <b>but</b> for that, <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>they</b> shall wait, and longer if my word and will can avail after I am gone.

"If you {{are really}} desirous of {{investigating}} {{the ways of the}} female population of the poorer quarters, I shall be happy to escort you whenever you like, but I do not think you will be altogether gratified with the result of your researches, and I think that you would obtain a much closer insight into French lower class life by studying Balzac and some of the modern writers--they are not always savory, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>they</b> are realistic." ...|$|E
60|$|Humor, if {{one looks}} into it, is principally a matter of retrospect. In after years John was wont to look back with {{amusement}} on the revolution which ejected him from the throne of his ancestors. But at the time its mirthfulness did not appeal to him. He was {{in a frenzy of}} restlessness. He wanted Betty. He wanted to see her and explain. Explanations could not restore him to the place he had held in her mind, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>they</b> would show her that he was not the thing he had appeared.|$|E
60|$|Dispositions {{were to be}} {{made without}} delay against that which must follow before they could abandon {{themselves}} fully to the enjoyment of their victory.

Those dispositions occupied some very considerable portion of the night. <b>But,</b> <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>they</b> were complete before the sun peeped over the shoulder of Mount Hilibay to shed his light upon a day of some surprises.|$|E
5000|$|Others at the Chicago Monthly {{detected}} {{that there}} were hints of attraction and likeness between Hannah and Marty, <b>but</b> (early on <b>at</b> <b>least)</b> <b>they</b> were generally more occupied with the sensational and outrageous stories to which the two were assigned. Jules Kramer (Richard Frank), affectionately known as [...] "Julie", was Norman's fawning assistant, and Pamela Peyton-Finch (Sandy Faison), a glamorous, cutthroat writer. The stories equally shifted between the easy-going (but sometimes frenetic) office camaraderie and the personal sides of Marty and Hannah. Also during the first season, Hannah's gun-touting outdoors-man dad, Leo Miller (Bruce Kirby), was present on the show.|$|R
50|$|OA {{is a part}} of the transhuman space opera subgenre. The {{world was}} {{influenced}} by Iain M. Banks' Culture series, Vernor Vinge's A Fire Upon the Deep, and David Brin's Uplift Universe, among others. It takes the concept of the technological singularity directly from the work of Vernor Vinge among others. In Orion's Arm, there is not one singularity <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> six, and <b>they</b> refer not to stages in the technological development of civilizations as a whole, but to different levels of consciousness in individuals. The concept of Toposophics used in this setting is inspired by the work of Stanisław Lem.|$|R
2500|$|In 1834 Tolstoy {{enrolled}} in the Moscow Foreign Ministry State Archive as a [...] "student", where {{he got his first}} taste of working with real historical documents. In December 1835 he completed exams (in English, French and German languages and literature, Latin, World and Russian history, and Russian statistics) at the University of Moscow for the formal 1st Grade State Bureaucrat certificate. He soon embarked on a career in the Economic Affairs and Statistics Department in Saint Petersburg. Before that, in July 1835, he had buried his uncle Aleksey Perovsky (who died in Warsaw of tuberculosis) and had become heir to his Krasny Rog estate. Also in 1835 Aleksey showed some of his new poems to Vasily Zhukovsky, who praised them. There's evidence that Pushkin also approved of the young poet's early works, giving him full moral support. Tolstoy wrote a lot, refining his technique, but wasn't eager to get published. [...] "My first experiments were, no doubt, absurd, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> metrically <b>they</b> were flawless. I went on training thus for many years, before I debuted... as a prose writer, not a poet," [...] he remembered later.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{example of}} a good knight like Sir Eustace taking the field for us with his {{retainers}} might lead others to follow his example; besides, there were several suitors for our lady's hand, and, by giving her to this French baron, there would be less offence and heart-burning than if he had chosen one among her English suitors. And, indeed, I know not that we have suffered much from its being so; {{it is true that}} our lord and lady live much on their estates abroad, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>they</b> are here part of their time, and their castellan does not press us more heavily during their absence than does our lord when at home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There," [...] he said presently, [...] "I thought I {{recalled}} {{this very}} spot." [...] He pointed toward a fragment that had evidently {{fallen from the}} summit of the cliff and which now lay imbedded in the sand {{a few feet from the}} base. It was a jagged fragment of rock which rose some ten feet above the surface of the sand, leaving a narrow aperture between it and the cliff behind. Toward this they directed their steps and when finally they reached their goal they found a space about two feet wide and ten feet long between the rock and the cliff. To be sure it was open at both ends <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>they</b> could not be attacked upon all sides at once.|$|E
6000|$|Such, then, {{as far as}} weak {{words can}} speak of him, is the first and {{greatest}} of poets. This is he whom English boys are to be ignorant of, if Greek be ousted from our schools, or are to know only in the distorting mirror of a versified, or in the pale shadow of a prose translation. Translations are good only as teachers to bring men to Homer. English verse has no measure which even remotely suggests the various flow of the hexameter. Translators who employ verse give us a feeble Homer, dashed with their own conceits, and moulded to their own style. Translators who employ prose [...] "tell the story without the song," [...] <b>but,</b> <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>they</b> add no twopenny [...] "beauties" [...] and cheap conceits of their own.|$|E
6000|$|The man {{interrupted}} {{him with a}} bitter laugh. [...] "No," [...] he says; [...] "they are not his; that's true enough, friends. Its Tom Martin's girl and boy, a precious pair of lazy little scamps. <b>But,</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> he thought <b>they</b> were his children. See how much he knows about them! He hasn't seen his children for years; he would have left them and their mother to starve, and did, but for shame and fear. The old man, his father, pensioned them, and he hasn't the heart to stop their wages now. Men of Newcome, will you have this man to represent you in Parliament?" [...] And the crowd roared [...] "No;" [...] and Barnes and his shamefaced committee slunk out of the place, and no wonder the dissenting clerical gentlemen were shy of voting for him.|$|R
5000|$|Eventually, {{a genuine}} gay culture {{began to take}} root, albeit very discreetly, with its own styles, attitudes and {{behaviors}} and industries began catering to this growing demographic group. For example, publishing houses cranked out pulp novels like The Velvet Underground that were targeted directly at gay people. By the early 1960s, openly gay political {{organizations such as the}} Mattachine Society were formally protesting abusive treatment toward gay people, challenging the entrenched idea that homosexuality was an aberrant condition, and calling for the decriminalization of homosexuality. Despite very limited sympathy, American society began <b>at</b> <b>least</b> to acknowledge the existence of a sizable population of gays. The film The Boys in the Band, for example, featured negative portrayals of gay men, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> recognized that <b>they</b> did in fact fraternize with each other (as opposed to being isolated, solitary predators who [...] "victimized" [...] straight men).|$|R
