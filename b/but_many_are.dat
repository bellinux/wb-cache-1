5|$|Like its {{predecessor}} series, The Legend of Korra has {{a broad and}} active fandom, including on social media and at fan conventions. Most fans are young adults, according to The Escapist, <b>but</b> <b>many</b> <b>are</b> children and younger teenagers.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to archaeological evidence, Zenobia's life {{was recorded in}} different ancient sources <b>but</b> <b>many</b> <b>are</b> flawed or fabricated; the Augustan History, a late-Roman collection of biographies, is the most notable (albeit unreliable) source for the era. The author (or authors) of the Augustan History invented many events and letters attributed to Zenobia {{in the absence of}} contemporary sources. Some Augustan History accounts are corroborated from other sources, and are more credible. Byzantine chronicler Joannes Zonaras is considered an important source for the life of Zenobia.|$|E
5|$|The {{contents}} of the chapters in the first edition are summarized below. All but Chapter 11 have the same titles in the second edition, <b>but</b> <b>many</b> <b>are</b> longer, {{as indicated by the}} page numbering of the start of each chapter. Bonner's abridgment shortened all the chapters, and removed some completely, again as indicated at the start of each chapter's entry below.|$|E
50|$|The {{earthquake}} {{took only}} 18 lives (14 in Senigallia, 4 in Ancona), <b>but</b> <b>many</b> more <b>were</b> injured.

5|$|Ganymede is {{composed}} primarily of silicate rock and water ice, and a salt-water ocean {{is believed to}} exist nearly 200km below Ganymede's surface, sandwiched between layers of ice. The metallic core of Ganymede suggests a greater heat {{at some time in}} its past than had previously been proposed. The surface is a mix of two types of terrain—highly cratered dark regions and younger, but still ancient, regions with a large array of grooves and ridges. Ganymede has a high number of craters, <b>but</b> <b>many</b> <b>are</b> gone or barely visible due to its icy crust forming over them. The satellite has a thin oxygen atmosphere that includes O, O2, and possibly O3 (ozone), and some atomic hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to other Alsatian wines, Rieslings d'Alsace {{are usually not}} meant to be drunk young, <b>but</b> <b>many</b> <b>are</b> still best in the first years. Rieslings d'Alsace tend to be mostly very dry with a cleansing acidity. They are thick-bodied wines that coat the palate. These wines age exceptionally well with a quality vintage aging up to 20 years. This is beneficial since the flavours in an Alsace wine will often open up after three years, developing softer and fruitier flavours. Riesling is very suitable for the late harvest Vendange Tardive and the botrytized Sélection de Grains Nobles, with good acidity keeping up the sweetness of the wine.|$|E
5|$|Michigan, one of {{the fifty}} United States, is home to two types of lizards, {{nineteen}} types of snakes and eleven types of turtles, {{all members of the}} class Reptilia. Reptiles are found throughout Michigan, although the only venomous species, the eastern massasauga rattlesnake, is seen only in the Lower Peninsula. Reptiles are cold-blooded, and so usually pass the cold winters of Michigan in frost-free areas, such as underground burrows (for snakes and land-dwelling turtles) or the bottoms of lakes and streams (for water-dwelling turtles). Most reptiles in Michigan are protected by state law, <b>but</b> <b>many</b> <b>are</b> still at risk due to human encroachment on their habitats, the draining of wetlands and, in the case of snakes, indiscriminate killing by fearful humans. In 1995, the painted turtle was named as Michigan's state reptile.|$|E

5|$|The 100th Congress {{formed a}} joint {{committee}} (Congressional Committees Investigating The Iran-Contra Affair) and held hearings in mid-1987. Transcripts were published as: Iran-Contra Investigation: Joint Hearings Before the Senate Select Committee on Secret Military Assistance to Iran and the Nicaraguan Opposition and the House Select Committee to Investigate Covert Arms Transactions with Iran (U.S. GPO 1987–88). A closed Executive Session heard classified testimony from North and Poindexter; this transcript {{was published in}} a redacted format. The joint committee's final report was Report of the Congressional Committees Investigating the Iran-Contra Affair With Supplemental, Minority, and Additional Views (U.S. GPO November 17, 1987). The records of the committee are at the National Archives, <b>but</b> <b>many</b> <b>are</b> still non-public.|$|E
5|$|The first {{vertebrates}} appeared over 500million {{years ago}} (Mya), during the Cambrian period, {{and may have}} resembled the modern hagfish in form. Sharks appeared about 450Mya, amphibians about 400Mya, reptiles about 350Mya, and mammals about 200Mya. Each species has an equally long evolutionary history, but the brains of modern hagfishes, lampreys, sharks, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals show a gradient of size and complexity that roughly follows the evolutionary sequence. All of these brains contain {{the same set of}} basic anatomical components, <b>but</b> <b>many</b> <b>are</b> rudimentary in the hagfish, whereas in mammals the foremost part (the telencephalon) is greatly elaborated and expanded.|$|E
5|$|Today, 19 skins of the Cuban macaw {{exist in}} 15 {{collections}} worldwide (two each in Natural History Museum at Tring, Muséum national d'histoire naturelle in Paris, the Swedish Museum of Natural History, and the Smithsonian Museum), <b>but</b> <b>many</b> <b>are</b> of unclear provenance. Several {{were provided by}} the Cuban naturalist Juan Gundlach, who collected some of the last individuals that regularly fed near the Zapata Swamp in 1849–50. Some of the preserved specimens {{are known to have}} lived in captivity in zoos (such as Jardin des Plantes de Paris, Berlin Zoo, and Amsterdam Zoo) or as cagebirds. Several more skins are known to have existed, but have been lost. There are no records of its eggs.|$|E

50|$|Before February 2016 <b>many</b> districts <b>were</b> {{named for}} people, places, events, and {{organizations}} associated with {{early years of}} the Soviet Union; <b>but</b> <b>many</b> <b>were</b> renamed since to comply with decommunization laws.|$|R
25|$|Once, {{hundreds}} of cultivars existed, <b>but</b> <b>many</b> <b>are</b> now extinct. In 1910, Árpäd Mühle, from Hungary, published his Canna book, written in German. It contained descriptions of over 500 cultivars.|$|E
25|$|Wheat {{genetics}} is {{more complicated}} than that of most other domesticated species. Some wheat species are diploid, with two sets of chromosomes, <b>but</b> <b>many</b> <b>are</b> stable polyploids, with four sets of chromosomes (tetraploid) or six (hexaploid).|$|E
25|$|Plastics are {{typically}} organic polymers of high molecular mass, {{but they often}} contain other substances.

25|$|Cats with sporotrichosis {{are unique}} in that the exudate from their lesions may contain {{numerous}} organisms. This makes cytological evaluation of exudate a valuable diagnostic tool in this species. Exudate is pyogranulomatous and phagocytic cells may be packed with yeast forms. These are variable in size, <b>but</b> <b>many</b> <b>are</b> cigar-shaped.|$|E
25|$|The Adyar wetland {{reserve is}} a {{significant}} link for birds on their great annual migrations, particularly the wading birds which feed on the coastal mudflats. Historically, approximately 200 species of migratory birds visited the Adyar Creek region <b>but</b> <b>many</b> <b>are</b> now on the endangered IUCN Red List. The restoration of this coastal wetland ecosystem will encourage many of these species to return.|$|E
25|$|A further {{difficulty}} is {{presented by the}} shortage of trained health-care workers for tuberculosis control. CDC facilities are being rebuilt across the country <b>but</b> <b>many</b> <b>are</b> staffed inadequately or by poorly trained and unmotivated health-care workers. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, is the challenge of sustaining and further increasing long-term governmental commitment to the control of tuberculosis, which is essential to tackle the other challenges.|$|E
