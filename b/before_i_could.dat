5|$|I {{should say}} I {{wanted to write}} poetry in the {{beginning}} because I {{had fallen in love}} with words. The first poems I knew were nursery rhymes and <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> read them for myself I had come to love the words of them. The words alone. What the words stood for was of a very secondary importance... I fell in love, that is the only expression I can think of, at once, and am still at the mercy of words, though sometimes now, knowing a little of their behaviour very well, I think I can influence them slightly and have even learned to beat them now and then, which they appear to enjoy. I tumbled for words at once. And, when I began to read the nursery rhymes for myself, and, later, to read other verses and ballads, I knew that I had discovered the most important things, to me, that could be ever.|$|E
500|$|A {{military}} brat, Douglas MacArthur {{was born}} 26 January 1880, at Little Rock Barracks, Little Rock, Arkansas, to Arthur MacArthur, Jr., a U.S. Army captain, and his wife, Mary Pinkney Hardy MacArthur (nicknamed [...] "Pinky"). Arthur, Jr. {{was the son}} of Scottish-born jurist and politician Arthur MacArthur, Sr., Arthur would later receive the Medal of Honor for his actions with the Union Army in the Battle of Missionary Ridge during the American Civil War, and be promoted to the rank of lieutenant general. Pinkney came from a prominent Norfolk, Virginia, family. Two of her brothers had fought for the South in the Civil War, and refused to attend her wedding. Arthur and Pinky had three sons, of whom Douglas was the youngest, following Arthur III, born on 1 August 1876, and Malcolm, born on 17 October 1878. The family lived on a succession of Army posts in the American Old West. Conditions were primitive, and Malcolm died of measles in 1883. In his memoir, Reminiscences, MacArthur wrote [...] "I learned to ride and shoot even <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> read or write—indeed, almost <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> walk and talk." ...|$|E
500|$|Vedder {{added that}} many songs were {{inspired}} {{by the death of}} fellow musician Johnny Ramone, whom he described as [...] "the best friend I ever had on the planet". The lyrics of [...] "Life Wasted" [...] in particular were written after attending Ramone's funeral. Vedder said that [...] "Gone" [...] is about a man [...] "needing to find a new life without his past, without his possessions, and not really looking for more possessions." [...] Damien Echols, one of the three members of the West Memphis 3, co-wrote the lyrics to [...] "Army Reserve". For the first time McCready contributed lyrics to a Pearl Jam album, writing the lyrics to the closing track [...] "Inside Job". McCready said that he wrote the lyrics while touring in São Paulo as he [...] "want this song to happen" [...] despite Vedder not having done the lyrics yet, and added that the lyrical inspiration was the realization that [...] "I had to go inside myself first <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> be open to outside ideas." ...|$|E

500|$|As death succeeded death, Dickinson {{found her}} world upended. In {{the fall of}} 1884, she wrote that [...] "The Dyings have been too deep for me, and <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> raise my Heart from one, another has come." [...] That summer she had seen [...] "a great {{darkness}} coming" [...] and fainted while baking in the kitchen. She remained unconscious {{late into the night}} and weeks of ill health followed. On November 30, 1885, her feebleness and other symptoms were so worrying that Austin canceled a trip to Boston. She was confined to her bed for a few months, but managed to send a final burst of letters in the spring. What is thought to be her last letter was sent to her cousins, Louise and Frances Norcross, and simply read: [...] "Little Cousins, Called Back. Emily". On May 15, 1886, after several days of worsening symptoms, Emily Dickinson {{died at the age of}} 55. Austin wrote in his diary that [...] "the day was awful ... she ceased to breathe that terrible breathing just before the [...] whistle sounded for six." [...] Dickinson's chief physician gave the cause of death as Bright's disease and its duration as two and a half years.|$|E
500|$|Air story {{revolves}} around three girls {{whose lives are}} connected to the same man. In the first story arc, Dream, Yukito Kunisaki is a showman traveling across Japan, continuing his late mother's search for the [...] "girl in the sky".Translated quote: [...] "...at {{the far end of the}} sky, there is a girl who has wings...from the distant past...even now, she is still there. That is what I heard from my mother when I was small. <b>Before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> ask more clearly, my mother died. After that, I continued journeying alone. The myth of the girl in the sky." [...] The story opens on Monday July 17, 2000 when Yukito comes across a small seaside town where the story takes place. On his first day in town, Yukito tries to earn money by putting on a mysterious puppet show where he manipulates a doll magically without strings for a small audience of kids passing by. Yukito is unsuccessful in gaining the children's favor, and the children leave without paying him for his performance. That night, Yukito sleeps on the town's seawall by the beach. Yukito collapses from heat stroke the next day and is taken to a nearby fisherman's guild; after he awakens, they feed him, and give him some very large rice balls to take with him as he is leaving. As he sits on the town's seawall eating one of the rice balls, he notices a young girl beside him who introduces herself as Misuzu Kamio—a sincere yet clumsy girl who is eager to become friends with him. Misuzu persistently attempts to play with him, while Yukito tries to refuse her efforts. He eventually follows her home lured by the chance to eat. After Haruko, Misuzu's aunt and foster mother, is persuaded, it is decided that he will stay with them for the time being.Translated quote: [...] "...I understand. Stay here. Sleep in the garage." ...|$|E

People kept saying {{he would have to}} die <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> be released, and I did not want my release from prison to be {{dependent}} on somebody, on something happening to somebody else, so I wanted him to live to be 100.” (2007) ...|$|E

60|$|I {{was sorry}} I said that last, but it whipped out <b>before</b> <b>I</b> knew. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see {{it took the}} wind out of his sails, and he stood and stared at me with his brow drawn up. Then I suppose he made up his mind he must {{get to the bottom of}} this.|$|R

The first baseman was the tallest in the league, but I threw the ball far over his head.|$|E

2500|$|Blue Horse came to Burbank's studio one hot day, fanning {{himself with}} a big turkey wing. [...] "He sat down on my bed and, not noticing, put his hat down {{on a sheet of}} sticky flypaper I had placed there. To pull it loose, he grabbed {{the other end of the}} flypaper with his other hand, and soon he was tangled up gloriously. <b>Before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> come to his rescue, he had managed to stick the flypaper on his little dog’s back. In no time at all, the pup had dashed around the room, {{attaching}} himself to first one object, then another. The situation was funny to everybody but Blue Horse. 'Bad Medicine,' he said in disgust.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Lake's {{daughter}} Agnes Kirsopp Lake Michels was a noted classical scholar. [...] In {{later years}} she {{reflected on the}} impact he had on her life: [...] "my general interests should be attributed mainly {{to the influence of}} my father who was a New testament scholar with a classical education and a passionate love of beauty. [...] He told me the stories of the classics and, long <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> understand them, read to me a strange assortment of Browning and the Bible; Swinburne, Tennyson, and Josephus. [...] His attitude to his own work made me think of scholarship as the opening to a world of adventure, not as a retirement from reality." [...] His grandson Anthony Lake is a diplomat.|$|E
2500|$|Herbert wrote {{poetry in}} English, Latin and Greek. In 1633 all of Herbert's English poems were {{published}} in The Temple: Sacred Poems and Private Ejaculations, with a preface by Nicholas Ferrar. The book went through eight editions by 1690. According to Isaac Walton, when Herbert sent the manuscript to Ferrar, he said that [...] "he shall find in it {{a picture of the}} many spiritual conflicts that have passed between God and my soul, <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> subject mine to the will of Jesus, my Master". In this Herbert used the format of the poems to reinforce the theme he was trying to portray. Beginning with [...] "The Church Porch", they proceed via [...] "The Altar" [...] to [...] "The Sacrifice", and so onwards through the collection.|$|E
2500|$|On January 7, 1955, Anderson {{became the}} first African-American to perform with the Metropolitan Opera in New York. On that occasion, she sang the part of Ulrica in Giuseppe Verdi's Un ballo in maschera (opposite Zinka Milanov, then Herva Nelli, as Amelia) at the {{invitation}} of director Rudolf Bing. Anderson said later about the evening, [...] "The curtain rose on the second scene and I was there on stage, mixing the witch's brew. I trembled, and when the audience applauded and applauded <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> sing a note, I felt myself tightening into a knot." [...] Although she never appeared with the company again after this production, Anderson was named a permanent member of the Metropolitan Opera company. The following year she published her autobiography, My Lord, What a Morning, which became a bestseller.|$|E
6000|$|... "The room is {{nice and}} airy," [...] said Mrs. Prentice, [...] "but it’s a pity you didn’t {{come to me}} <b>before</b> deciding. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have told you of a better house for the same money." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And yet," [...] cried Clara, [...] "you talk {{of their}} dying also. This is indeed cruel --how <b>could</b> <b>I</b> live, {{if they were}} gone?

2500|$|Novello {{continued}} to write songs while {{serving in the}} RNAS. He had his first stage success with Theodore & Co in 1916, a production by George Grossmith, Jr. and Edward Laurillard with a score composed by Novello and the young Jerome Kern. In the same year, Novello contributed to André Charlot's revue See-Saw. In 1917 he wrote for another Grossmith and Laurillard production, the operette Arlette, for which he contributed additional numbers to an existing French score by Jane Vieu and Guy le Feuvre. In the same year, Marsh {{introduced him to the}} actor Bobbie Andrews, who became Novello's life partner. Andrews introduced Novello to the young Noël Coward. Coward, six years Novello's junior, was deeply envious of Novello's effortless glamour. He wrote, [...] "I just felt suddenly conscious of the long way I had to go <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> break into the magic atmosphere in which he moved and breathed with such nonchalance".|$|E
2500|$|The opera {{historian}} Harold Rosenthal {{wrote of}} the Moody-Manners company: [...] "With the Carl Rosa company, it was the principal training ground for British artists {{in the years before}} World War I." [...] Manners held strong views about the training given by British music academies to young singers. In his view students were not equipped for a professional career because they were trained in the principal operatic roles rather than in the chorus parts, which almost all singers new to the profession would need to sing before being promoted to leading roles. He instanced his own early career: [...] "I studied both at the Royal Academy, Dublin, and the Royal Academy, London, and then in Italy, and when I came back to London, all I could get was an engagement in comic opera where I sang for eighteen months <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> become a principal. It was not till over six years after I left my studies that I found anything I had learnt at the academies of any value to me." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{his return}} to California, London {{was unable to find}} work and relied on odd jobs such as cutting grass. He {{submitted}} a query letter to the San Francisco Bulletin proposing a story about his Alaskan adventure, but the idea was rejected because, as the editor told him, [...] "Interest in Alaska has subsided in an amazing degree." [...] A few years later, London wrote a short story about a dog named Bâtard who, {{at the end of the}} story, kills his master. London sold the piece to Cosmopolitan Magazine, which published it in the June 1902 issue under the title [...] "Diablo— A Dog". London's biographer, Earle Labor, says that London then began work on The Call of the Wild to [...] "redeem the species" [...] from his dark characterization of dogs in [...] "Bâtard". Expecting to write a short story, London explains: [...] "I meant it to be a companion to my other dog story [...] "Bâtard"... but it got away from me, and instead of 4,000 words it ran 32,000 <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> call a halt." ...|$|E

2500|$|Alderman {{was injured}} in the first test of the 1982-83 Ashes. He had taken 1-84 in the first innings {{when there was a}} pitch invasion. Alderman was hit {{in the back of the}} head by a member of the crowd, Gary Donnison. Alderman recalled, [...] "he ran off, and I could see that there were no police in the {{vicinity}} so I attempted to apprehend him." [...] Alderman charged at Donnison and tackled him to the ground but fell on his shoulder and injured himself. [...] "I can't remember a lot of how I fell ... but I was immediately aware I was injured ... it was very painful indeed," [...] Alderman said. [...] "At the time I thought it would just pop back in - little did I know that it would be a year <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> bowl in a competitive match again," [...] he said. [...] "I had to learn to swim a mile a day for eight months. What is tough in sport, is that if you have a physical injury or problem, no one wants to know you. In a way, when I came back, it was like starting another career." ...|$|E
