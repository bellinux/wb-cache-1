40|$|A {{moderately}} intense, broadcast, understory, prescribed burn in 3 previously unburned {{ponderosa pine}} stands in southeastern Arizona felled or consumed 50 % of all ponderosa pine snags ≥ 15 cm dbh. Large moderately decayed snags were most susceptible to burning. Large snags {{in the early}} stages of decay were preferred as nest sites by cavity-nesting birds. Numbers of live woody plants were reduced by 40 %, mortality was greatest among shrubs and small trees. Canopy volume was reduced by 19 %, the greatest impact was below 5 m. No species of cavity-nesting birds, or birds that associated with understory vegetation disappeared in the first season after burning, but 3 species decreased, and 1 species increased in abundance.

30|$|At {{the stand}} level, fuelbreak {{construction}} (and fuels reduction and forest restoration projects in general) should follow a step-wise progression of {{working from the}} ground up rather than the crown down. Moreover, the pathway for making fuels reduction projects serve programmatic long-term forest restoration goals is to slowly raise up the canopy over time through multiple light entries of thinning-from-below, rather than rapidly opening up the canopy in a single intensive overstory treatment. This means that surface and ladder fuels reduction should be the initial treatments (Graham et al 2004). Functionally this may involve reducing ladder fuels by manually pruning lower limbs or mechanically thinning understory shrubs and pole-sized trees before implementing pile-burning or <b>broadcast</b> understory <b>burning.</b> Reducing surface fuels and treating ladder fuels raises the ground-to-crown base height and disrupts the vertical continuity of fuels. This has the combined effect of lowering potential heat output and flame lengths, with the goal of keeping them below a threshold of conditions necessary to initiate crown fires (Agee 1996, Omi and Martinson 2002). In some stands, simply treating the surface and understory layers of the fuels profile could greatly decrease the risk of uncharacteristic crownfire while maximizing the retention of ecologically valuable overstory trees.|$|R

50|$|<b>Broadcast</b> <b>burning</b> is not {{recommended}} {{as a method of}} preparing sites for natural regeneration, as it rarely exposes enough mineral soil to be sufficiently receptive, and the charred organic surfaces are a poor seedbed for spruce. A charred surface may get too hot for good germination and may delay germination until fall, with subsequent overwinter mortality of unhardened seedlings. Piling and burning of logging slash, however, can leave suitable exposures of mineral soil.|$|E
50|$|For {{the burning}} of slash, waste {{materials}} left over from logging, there are several types of controlled burns. <b>Broadcast</b> <b>burning</b> is {{the burning of}} scattered slash over a wide area. Pile burning is gathering up the slash into piles before burning. These burning piles may {{be referred to as}} bonfires. High temperatures can harm the soil, damaging it physically, chemically or sterilizing it. Broadcast burns tend to have lower temperatures and will not harm the soil as much as pile burning, though steps can be taken to treat the soil after a burn. In lop and scatter burning, slash is left to compact over time, or is compacted with machinery. This produces a lower intensity fire, as long as the slash is not packed too tightly. However, soil may be damaged if machinery is used to compress the slash.|$|E

In contrast, significant reductions in soil bulk density and increases in soil nutrient availability persisted for 20 years in hinge position soils relative to undisturbed (control) soil between trenches. These effects on bulk density and nutrient availability are associated with significant differences in pine size by year 6. Burning and planting positions interacted significantly in their effect on pine height, diameter, and stem volume for at least 19 years.

40|$|In British Columbia, <b>broadcast</b> <b>burning</b> {{following}} clearcutting {{has been}} used to meet forest management objectives such as site preparation for restocking timber species. However, effects of <b>broadcast</b> <b>burning</b> on ectomycorrhizae (ECM), which facilitate nutrient and energy cycling within forests, is poorly understood. Difficulties include a complex soil environment and uncertainties in ECM identification. To determine effects of <b>broadcast</b> <b>burning</b> following clearcutting on the diversity and abundance (percent colonization) of ectomycorrhizal fungi, morphological and molecular (PCR-RFLP) methods were used to assess naturally regenerating and outplanted hybrid white spruce seedlings growing in clearcut, clearcut plus burned, and adjacent mature sites in the Interior of British Columbia. Morphological characterization resulted in 24 fungal morphotypes. Significant treatment effects and seedling differences occurred between naturally regenerating seedlings in clearcut and mature sites and between naturally regenerating and planted seedlings in clearcut sites. The abundance of some morphotypes differed on planted seedlings in clearcut compared with clearcut plus burned sites and for planted seedlings in treated (clearcut and clearcut plus burned) compared with regenerating seedlings in untreated (mature) sites. A Russulaceae type and Thelephora were the most abundant morphotypes on regenerating seedlings in the mature and clearcut sites, respectively. Molecular characterization showed no significant differences for treatment effects or seedling type. Amplification of the ITS region for eight commonly occurring morphotypes revealed 12 genotypes (having a shared band pattern for one or none of three restriction endonucleases) with 18 variants (having similar band patterns for two restriction endonucleases). Cenococcum, Tuber, Hebeloma and Thelephora had only one genotype, however, Amphinema, E-strain, MRA, and a Russulaceae type each exhibited two or three genotypes. Morphology showed differences in occurrence and abundance of some ECM fungi following clearcutting, and clearcutting plus burning, suggesting that disturbance may be altering the fungal composition of hybrid white spruce seedlings on these sites towards ECM best able to adapt to changing environmental conditions. Using both characterization techniques provided a comprehensive estimate of diversity, specifically for total species richness when using morphology, and for increased understanding of inter- and intra-specific variation with respect to molecular characterization of ectomycorrhizal associations.

Late successional woodlands are often treated mechanically because fuel deficiencies (shrub and herbaceous layers) make prescribed burning problematic. Late successional woodlands, termed Phase 3 woodlands, are tree dominated, with shrubs largely eliminated and herbaceous productivity reduced (Miller et al. 2005). In the past, mechanically killed trees were left on site; however, downed trees present a significant fire hazard.

The studies were conducted within the Lassen National Forest in northeastern California between 1990 and 1994. In the first study, we found that abundance of northern flying squirrels was significantly less in old-growth fir stands that had been shelterwood-logged 6 to 7 years previously than in nearby, unlogged old-growth and mature fir stands. Truffles were common in the diet of flying squirrels, truffle frequency was low in the shelterwood-logged stands compared to the unlogged old-growth and mature stands, and abundance of flying squirrels was correlated with truffle frequency across the 12 stands in which we estimated both.

30|$|The {{evolving}} fire management {{direction of}} linking cultural and biophysical processes in Canadian protected areas {{is similar to}} parks elsewhere in the world. Kakadu National Park and the surrounding region in northern Australia {{has long been the}} international leader in this approach. Managers there use aboriginal traditional knowledge to ignite fires in select areas during the early and late fire season, and periodically use mid-summer high-intensity fires within this mosaic at a landscape level (Russel-Smith et al. 1997, Bowman et al. 2004). For several decades, Kruger National Park in South Africa prescribed <b>broadcast</b> <b>burning</b> to enhance wildlife populations. After a period of emphasizing lightning fires only, the park has now begun a new era of linking ecological and traditional knowledge to restore biodiversity. Researchers and managers are evaluating the heterogeneous ecological effects of point ignitions lit in various periods of the burning season combined with lightning (Govender 2004). In the western United States, Yosemite National Park uses prescribed burns in low elevation areas heavily used by humans (past and present), and at higher elevation, stresses maintenance of lightning-ignited fires (van Wagtendonk and Lutz 2007). Recently, research has focused on the long-term anthropogenic pattern of burning in Yosemite’s low elevation areas (Gassaway 2009). Williams (2000) discusses the implications of restoring aboriginal fires to American landscapes.|$|E
40|$|Fuel {{accumulation}} {{and climate}} shifts are predicted {{to increase the}} frequency of high-severity fires in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws) forests of central Oregon. The combustion of fuels containing large downed wood can result in intense soil heating, alteration of soil properties, and mortality of microbes. Previous studies show ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) improve ponderosa seedling establishment after fire but did not compare EMF communities {{at different levels of}} soil burn intensity in a field setting. For this study, soil burn intensity effects on nutrients and EMF communities were compared at Pringle Falls Experimental Forest, La Pine, Oregon.

40|$|Recent concern {{regarding}} the potential decline of quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) {{forests in the}} western United States has sparked concern over whether the species can be effectively regenerated. Using a retrospective approach, we quantified the response of regenerating aspen stems to an ordinary set of silvicultural treatments conducted over approximately the past decade in southern Utah, USA. A suite of variables describing stand structure and composition, stand vigor, physiographic factors, herbivore pressure, and treatment types were measured to predict the possible controls, {{as well as their}} relative importance, on aspen regeneration. Results suggested that aspen regeneration was most strongly related to browsing pressure, site preparation technique, and the presence of advance reproduction before treatment, which is a novel finding. Secondary predictors included elevation, site index, and overstory conditions, which are generally characteristics of stand vigor. Management recommendations based on our results should recognize the strong primary control that browsing pressure exerts on regeneration. First, the height of advance reproduction is inherently dependent on antecedent herbivory and also indicative of present browsing and should be assessed before treatment. Second, the most effective site preparation techniques, namely <b>broadcast</b> <b>burning</b> and browsing reduction, will directly reduce browsing pressure, assuming ungulate populations are not too large. Any management targeting timely and effective aspen regeneration should incorporate monitoring and (or) controlling browsing pressure, both before and after treatment...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1970 In 1967 an {{investigation}} seeking {{to understand the}} disturbance effects produced by broadcast slash burning was conducted on Douglas fir clear-cuts in the Harlan area of the Siuslaw National Forest. Specifically, this study was concerned with the effects disturbance has on the growth (spatial) patterns and the replacement (time) patterns of the plant species found in the early successional stages. The study was conducted on two Douglas fir clear-cuts, one logged in 1966 and slash burned in 1967 {{and the other was}} logged in 1965 and slash burned in 1966. All sampling was done in 1968; one and two years after slash burning. The disturbance conditions were defined as being unburned or burned, and five 15 ' x 15 ' plots were placed on unburned soil sites and five 15 ' x 15 ' plots were also placed on burned soil sites on both clear-cuts, creating a two-year successional sequence. Each plot was subdivided into 25 3 ' x 3 ' subplots, 11 of these subplots randomly selected to be sampled. Each subplot was then divided into nine 1 ' x microplots, giving a total of 99 microplots per plot. Frequency data on the occurring species was obtained by counting the number of subdivisions within which a specie occurred and expressing this {{as a percentage of the}} total number of subdivisions (99). Tabular ordination of frequency values for presenting and newly established species according to the two disturbance conditions (burned and unburned) provide a basis for an evaluation of the relative tolerance of these species to microenvironments within the clear-cut. Species preferring burned sites one year after burning include Senecio sylvaticus, Funaria hygrometrica, Montia sibirica, Senecio jacobea, Epilobium adenocaulon, Sonchus asper, and Erechites prenanthoides. Two years after burning Epilobium minutum may be added to the species listed above. There also was a group of species found to prefer the unburned sites which result from the mechanical removal of logs. Species found consistently in this situation on the clear-cut, sampled two years after logging (one year after <b>broadcast</b> <b>burning</b> on the clear-cut) include Agrostis exarata, Rubus parviflorus, Carex festivilla, Crepis setosa, and Hypochoeris radicata. For disturbed but unburned locations within the clear-cut three years after cutting (two years after <b>broadcast</b> <b>burning</b> on the clear-cut), Luzula campestris and Holcus lanatus may be added to the above list. A wide variety of remnant plant assemblages and microsites are characteristic of the aftermath of logging and burning on clear-cuts [...] particularly during the first years following disturbance. A sample ordination of microsites according to frequency of occurrence of plant species provides a basis for comparing the relative compatibility of a species to logging and burning effects. This limited analysis sugests a relatively narrow place and time niche requirement of certain plant species occupying Douglas fir clear-cuts during the first three years following logging and burning...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1985 Stocking {{levels and}} height {{growth rates of}} noble fir and {{associated}} species were measured on 51 clearcut study areas within the Pacific silver fir zone of the Oregon and Washington Cascades. Clearcut study areas were approximately 20 {{years old and had}} either planted noble fir or natural regeneration of noble fir from a seed source adjacent to the clearcut. Study areas occupied a variety of slope aspects, Inclinations and elevations. Clearcut study areas were grouped by ecological types (groups of environmentally similar plant associations) and the regeneration method used to reforest the clearcut. Stocking levels were generally high on 1 / 400 hectare plots (1 / 162 acre). The average percent stocking (the ratio of unstocked versus stocked plots) for naturally regenerated clearcuts ranged from 71. 6 percent on cool-dry sites to 93. 3 percent for the cool-moist ecological types. Planted clearcuts had less variation, with the average percent stocking ranging from 78. 3 to 89. 0 pecent on cool-dry and cool-moist ecological types, respectively. The stocking density on the Pacific silver fir zone clearcuts sampled was very high, ranging from 528 to 13, 696 trees per hectare. The mean density for all the clearcuts surveyed was 3962 trees per hectare (1604 trees per acre). The relative stocking by individual tree species was clearly dominated by noble fir. The relative composition (the proportion of each species sampled on a clearcut) for noble fir was 44. 6 percent on naturally regenerated clearcuts compared with 39. 2 percent for planted clearcuts. Other species ranged from less than 1 to 21 percent relative composition. In comparisons with Douglas-fir, noble fir stocking was significantly greater on naturally regenerated clearcuts at the south and north extremes of its natural range, the Willamette and Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forests, respectively. The difference in composition for noble fir and Douglas-fir was significant on planted clearcuts only on the Gifford Pinchot National Forest. Mean height growth for the trees sampled varied little among tree species and ecological types. Only western hemlock was significantly less than the other species, and then, only at locations north of the Columbia River. Noble fir, Douglas-fir and Pacific silver fir were nearly equal in height growth on all ecological types for all National Forests. There was however a trend for height growth to be more on low elevation, warm ecological types and less on the high elevation, cool-dry ecological types. The use of <b>broadcast</b> <b>burning</b> for site preparation caused Pacific silver fir to have lower densities and relative composition than on clearcuts that had not been broadcast burned. The use of <b>broadcast</b> <b>burning</b> on severe upper-slope clearcuts, where advance regeneration Pacific silver fir is present, should probably be restricted. On clearcuts where adjacent forested stands contain substantial densities of mature noble fir or where noble fir has been planted, noble fir is able to survive and grow well (greater than 23 centimeters per year) on Pacific silver fir zone clearcuts of the Oregon and Washington Cascades. Implications {{based on the results of}} this study are that plant associations may not be good predictors of regeneration stocking and growth of noble fir and other upper-slope species over large areas. Predictions may be possible on a more local basis...|$|E
40|$|The FERA fuel {{consumption}} database {{was created to}} store internal and test consumption datasets on prescribed and wildfire burns. Over the past 30 years, FERA has conducted {{fuel consumption}} research {{in a variety of}} forest and shrubland types and under a range of prescriptions from <b>broadcast</b> <b>burning</b> of clearcut harvest units to prescribed burns in ponderosa pine and southern pine forests to boreal forest floor consumption in Alaska wildfires. The main objectives of creating the FERA database were to (1) house all of our existing datasets in a single repository with common variable names and units of measure, and (2) allow for additional datasets to be added, including test data from published research. As part of a project to expand our understanding of fuel consumption in the eastern United States (this study, JFSP 08 - 1 - 6 - 01), we collected fuel consumption data (including pre- and post-burn fuel characteristics and day-of-burn environmental variables) for 29 burn units in the eastern United States.

30|$|The {{decrease}} in fire activity {{has been recognized}} as a main cause of expansion of North American woodlands. Piñon-juniper habitat in the western United States has expanded in area nearly 10 -fold since the late 1800 s. Woodland control measures using chainsaws, heavy equipment, and prescribed fire are used to restore sagebrush steppe plant communities. We compared vegetation recovery following cutting and prescribed fire on three sites in late Phase 2 (mid succession) and Phase 3 (late succession) western juniper (Juniperus occidentalis Hook.) woodlands in southeast Oregon. Treatments were partial cutting followed by fall <b>broadcast</b> <b>burning</b> (SEP); clear-cut and leave (CUT); and clear-cut and burn in early winter (JAN), late winter (MAR), and spring (APR); and untreated controls. Cover and density of herbaceous, shrub, and tree layers were measured. Five years after treatment, perennial bunchgrasses dominated two sites and co-dominated, with invasive annual grasses, at one site. Except for Sandberg blue-grass (Poa secunda J. Presl), cover and density of bunchgrasses, perennial and annual forbs, and annual grasses increased following treatments at all three sites and were greater than in controls. At each site, shrub, herbaceous, and ground cover response variables equalized or had begun to converge among treatments during {{the fourth or fifth}} year following application. SEP and APR treatments were mostly effective at reducing fuel sizes up to and including 1000 -hr fuels while JAN and MAR treatments only consumed 1 -hr and 10 -hr fuels. Winter burning treatments (JAN, MAR) and the CUT treatments did not kill small junipers and seedlings and require additional tree control for sites to fully recover to functional sagebrush-herbaceous plant communities. The results demonstrate that juniper treatments are needed to recover sagebrush steppe plant communities.|$|E
30|$|For the Bluebunch site, {{we failed}} to reject our {{hypothesis}} that shrub cover would differ among the treatments or from the control. This is because shrubs were largely absent prior to treatment and likely lacked a seed bank or adjacent sources of seed to respond following treatment. The lack of shrub recovery 4 years to 10 years following prescribed burning or cutting of Phase 3 juniper woodlands appears typical on sites where shrubs had been largely absent prior to treatment (Bates et al. 2005, 2006, 2011). On the Fescue and NGBER sites, treatments differed {{in their ability to}} retain or recover shrubs, primarily Artemisia tridentata ssp. vaseyana, thus rejecting our null hypotheses. The SEP treatments at both sites initially lost all shrub cover. On the Fescue site, shrubs on the SEP treatment did not recover and remained less than the other treatments and control. However, A.t. ssp. vaseyana on the SEP treatment NGBER site recovered during the third year after treatment. This response appears to have been from the seed bank as clumps of A.t. ssp. vaseyana established on severely burned patches and on patches lacking competing vegetation around stumps and downed juniper. O’Connor et al. (2013) reported similar increases of A.t. ssp. vaseyana and rubber rabbitbrush (Ericamerica nauseosa [Pall. ex. Pursh] G.L. Nesom & Baird) in severely burned areas after cutting and <b>broadcast</b> <b>burning</b> or pile burning of juniper. These results suggest that severely burned areas might be good locales to seed shrub species. Davies et al. (2014) reported some success reestablishing A.t. ssp. vaseyana in such areas after seeding. A common thread for early recovery of A.t. ssp. vaseyana appears to be linked to plants establishing within 2 years after fire (Ziegenhagen and Miller 2009).|$|E

Previous studies show ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) improve ponderosa seedling establishment after fire but did not compare EMF communities {{at different levels of}} soil burn intensity in a field setting. For this study, soil burn intensity effects on nutrients and EMF communities were compared at Pringle Falls Experimental Forest, La Pine, Oregon. Twelve replicate sites were used, each with three treatments: high intensity soil burn (HB), low intensity soil burn (LB), and unburned control (UB). The combustion of downed logs stacked together, simulating a large downed log, was used to apply HB treatments. <b>Broadcast</b> <b>burning</b> of pre-existing ground fuels was used to apply LB treatments. Temperatures lethal to fungi were recorded at 0 -cm, 5 -cm, and 10 -cm depths in HB soils and 0 -cm depth in LB soils. Ponderosa pine seedlings planted post-burn were harvested after four months for EMF root tip analysis. We found: a) greater differences in soil nutrients in HB soils compared to LB and UB soils; b) no differences in EMF richness and diversity; c) weak differences in community composition based on relative abundance between UB and burn treatments; and d) EMF composition in HB and LB treatments correlated with low carbon and organic matter contents. These results confirm the combustion of large downed wood can alter the soil environment beneath it. However, an EMF community similar to LB soils recolonized HB soils within one growing season. We theorize that quick initiation of EMF communities is possible {{depending on the size of}} high burn patches, proximity of low and unburned soil, and survival of nearby hosts. The importance of incorporating mixed fire effects in fuel management practices will help to provide EMF refugia for ponderosa pine forest recovery and regeneration...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1978 Four brushfield {{reclamation}} {{methods were}} compared on a 28 hectare area supporting a dense overstory of red alder {{and a thick}} understory of deciduous brush species. Tractor scarification, aerial application of 2, 4, 5 -T and picloram followed by <b>broadcast</b> <b>burning</b> or tractor crushing, and aerial application of glyphosate were performed {{during the summer and}} early fall of 1976, after salvage logging. Prior to disturbance, permanent sampling points were established throughout the area, and vegetation characteristics assessed. The season after site preparation, points were revisited and treatment effects on vegetation, brush species response, and operational planting characteristics observed. Additional information on treatment effectiveness, soil disturbance, and animal habitat was also recorded. All methods successfully reduced competitive woody cover. Canopies supporting 50 to 100 percent cover were typically reduced to near-zero levels after site treatment. Few plant species, either woody or herbaceous, were eliminated by any of the treatments. Species found in the original brushfield community were clearly present one season after logging and site preparation, although the relative dominance of those plants appears to have been lowered because of an increase in the abundance of a few invading and residual species. Few woody plants escaped undamaged. Plant response was not equal among treatments. Many of the woody plants in the scarified area were removed completely. Shrubs in the herbicide-burn-crush combinations were generally effectively top-killed, but often produced basal sprouts. Deciduous woody plants not mechanically injured prior to glyphosate application died, or exhibited symptoms interpreted as precursors to mortality, without basal sprouting. Viable woody root systems were still present in all areas, however. Abundant and well distributed planting environments were created by all four treatments. Difficulty of planting was rated least in the scarified area. Coniferous tree seedlings planted in all treatment areas should be subject to environments conducive to survival and growth desired in a commercial plantation. The vegetation following site treatment is important in determining the rate at which competitive effects return to the site. Woody plant development from existing root systems in the herbicide-burn-crush combinations, and moisture demanding herbaceous vegetation appearing after scarification suggests that seedlings planted in those areas may be faced with serious competition within a few seasons. Woody plant development from weakened residual root systems may occur in the glyphosate treated areas also, but because plants injured by this herbicide generally do not sprout, the rate of development should be slower, allowing seedlings a greater time period for unrestricted growth...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1978 Presentation date: 1977 - 09 - 19 Ecological and {{historical}} information are combined {{in examining the}} environmental influence of fire and grazing on rangelands in eastern Oregon through time. Competitive relationships between herbaceous and woody flora in the northern Great Basin are discussed, focusing broadly on the shrubsteppe regions 'of Franklin and Dyrness (1973) but with special reference to the Artemisia/Agropyron association. Impacts of native and domestic grazing animals and of cultural burning are traced from the distant past into recent history. During the Pleistocene Epoch North America supported a wide diversity of large mammals. Toward {{the end of the}} Pleistocene, many of these fauna became extinct, perhaps as a result of post-glacial climatic change, perhaps also under the influence of incoming primitive hunting cultures and their <b>broadcast</b> <b>burning</b> practices. Some question exists about the intensity of native grazing in the northern Great Basin during the last few thousand years. Actual levels of bison populations and the duration of their residence in the study area have not been determined. The character of indigenous vegetations, however, indicates that native grazing was relatively light for an extended period primevally. Twenty-four references to native cultural burning at the time of European contact were found in historical journals. Though the antiquity of these customs is uncertain, an analysis of Native American fire myths demonstrates the depth of native cultural perceptions of the relationship between man and fire, and supports the likelihood that fire was used primevally in the northern Great Basin as it was used by aboriginal peoples elsewhere in North America. With the influx of European culture during the 19 th century, misapprehensions about fire among whites distorted the influence of native cultural burning. Exotic flora and fauna were introduced, and ecosystems began to change. Large herds of livestock depleted native herbaceous populations. Early irresponsible burning by whites became associated with declining rangeland resources, and efforts toward total fire suppression became incorporated in developing conservation policies. Native woody flora and exotics began to invade open rangeland communities. Climatic flux during the period of European settlement in the northern Great Basin may have exacerbated the impacts of intensified grazing and elimination of burning. Early photographs of rangelands in east-central Oregon were gathered; their dates range from 1880 to the early 1930 's. Sites represented in these pictures were re-photographed in 1976. Photo-set comparisons show expansion of western juniper (Juniperus occidentalis) populations into rangeland ecosystems, demonstrating the consequences of cultural disturbances during the last 150 to 200 years...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1976 To obtain {{data on the}} {{decomposition}} of the forest floor, a battery operated electrolytic respirometer was developed {{making it possible to}} measure CO₂ evolution from field moist forest floor samples in situ independent of root respiration. Banks of four respirometers powered by two 12 -volt batteries were installed in three old growth Douglas-fir-hemlock stands, two clearcuts, and one clearcut that had been broadcast burned. All sites were located on or immediately adjacent to the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest located in the western Cascades near Blue River, Oregon. Seasonal and yearly totals of mineralized carbon were similar for the three habitat types. First year totals for the Tsuga heterophylla/Rhododendron macrophyllum/Berberis nervosa associa tion (RS 2), the Tsuga heterophylla/Castanopsis chrysophylla association (RS 6) and the Tsuga heterophylla/Polystichum munitum-Oxalis oregana association (RS 7) were 77. 36, 75. 67, and 78. 86 mg C /g litter. Spring and fall mineralization accounted for approximately 62 % of this total on all three reference stands. The lowest rates occurred during the winter months. Carbon mineralization rates for the second fall of the study were {{similar to those of the}} first year. However, carbon mineralization during the second winter of the study increased unexpectedly by 88 %, 123 % and 142 % for reference stands 2, 6 and 7, respectively, Presumably, this was due to warmer temperatures during the second winter. Clearcutting enhanced the rate of carbon mineralization, the magnitude of the effect being greater on the older clearcut. On the 4 -year-old clearcuts (plots 29 and 36), yearly totals averaged 102. 97 mg C/g litter. On the 3 -year-old clearcut (RS 33), total carbon mineralization was 89. 49 mg C/ g litter. Part of the variation was probably related to elevational effects on temperature, RS 33 being located 330 meters higher than the other clearcut. But it is also possible that the greater reestablishment of vegetation on the older clearcut could have contributed a higher proportion of fresh litter to the residual forest floor. Clearcutting followed by <b>broadcast</b> <b>burning</b> decreased the rate of carbon mineralization. Plots were established on the site one month following a light burn. The yearly totals for carbon mineralization averaged 64. 62 mg C/g litter, or 59 % less than on the older clearcut (29 and 36). Nitrogen levels remained relatively high, and there appeared to be an increase in the lignin fraction of the litter. Decomposition was significantly correlated with litter moisture content or litter temperature on a seasonal basis. In general, litter moisture content was the dominant factor during the summer and fall months. Litter temperature was the dominant factor in the winter and spring months when statistically significant correlations could be obtained. Inadequate means of estimating litter temperature under snowpack may be the reason for fewer significant correlations during these periods...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2013 Quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) {{is known}} to be a widely distributed, shade-intolerant and {{short-lived}} hardwood found in both seral, even-aged and stable, uneven aged stands. There have been reports of extensive aspen mortality, crown thinning, and branch dieback across North America that have been linked to the occurrence of severe droughts since 2001 - 2002. Because of reports of low aspen regeneration across the Intermountain West, as well as predictions of increases in aspen regeneration in the Northeastern US, researchers and land managers have now focused on managing aspen stands under the assumption that there are multiple aspen types. They have focused on improving resilience within quaking aspen stands with changing ecological conditions. For this thesis I focused on a project the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Pocatello Field Office initiated in part to improve aspen restoration and resilience of stands in Soda Springs, ID. The BLM conducted two mechanical removal treatments: cut and pile, and slash/lop and scatter. In addition several sites were broadcast burned to reduce fuel loads and conifer density, to enhance aspen regeneration and improve aspen stand resilience. According to the Soda Springs Hills Fuels Reduction and Ecosystem Restoration Environmental Assessment (EA), the BLM aimed to meet the objective of 2500 quaking aspen suckers per ha (1000 suckers per ac) within the two years following treatment, an index of treatment adequacy. My primary objective for this thesis was to assess the influence of each silvicultural treatment, including the change in overstory and understory vegetation, on regeneration of aspen. Mean aspen regeneration two growing seasons after treatment was 11, 532 suckers/ha on sites that received slash/lop and scatter treatment, followed by <b>broadcast</b> <b>burning.</b> With these high levels of suckering, there were also low densities of residual overstory conifers (≤ 4 trees/ha with a basal area ≤ 2 m²/ha). In comparison, sites that received the cut and pile treatment followed by a broadcast burn had a mean aspen regeneration of 44 suckers/ha, with higher densities of overstory conifers (≥ 32 trees/ha with a basal area ≥ 26 m²/ha). In slash/lop and scatter treatments without burning, sucker densities were as high as 1117 suckers/ha with low densities of conifers (0 trees/ha). In comparison, the site that received the cut and pile treatment without burning had an aspen regeneration of 0 suckers/ha, with a high density of conifers (36 trees/ha with a basal area of 47 m²/ha). Overall, sites with low residual overstory cover of large conifer trees (16 trees/ha (29 suckers/ha, on average). Also, sites that were burned, regardless of the mechanical treatment used, had higher sucker densities (11, 244 suckers/ha) than those seen in sites that were not burned (576 suckers/ha). When comparing aspen sucker densities to competing understory woody cover following mechanical treatment, aspen sucker density was lowest (411 suckers/ha) on the site where both tree and shrub percent cover were highest (10 and 16...|$|E
