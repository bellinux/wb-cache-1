The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the microtensile bond strength of the different composite core materials and bonding systems to a fiber post.   Materials and Methods: To evaluate the bond strength of the composite resins to a fiber post (DT light post) 60 posts were divided into six groups : group A: Heliomolar Flow + Seal <b>Bond,</b> <b>group</b> B: Heliomolar Flow + SE <b>Bond,</b> <b>group</b> C: Valux Plus + Seal <b>Bond,</b> <b>group</b> D: Valux Plus + SE <b>Bond,</b> <b>group</b> E: Corecem + Seal <b>Bond,</b> <b>group</b> F: Corecem + SE Bond. All samples were thermocycled for 5000 cycles (5 - 55 0 C) and cut into four bars for the microtensile bond strength test. Failure modes were identified using a stereomicroscope. Data were analysed using One-way ANOVA and Tukey HSD post hoc test (P< 0. 05).   Results: The interaction between composite resin materials and bonding systems were positive. The conventional hybrid composite (Valux Plus) had significantly higher bond strength compared with the core specific flowable composite (Corecem) when Seal Bond was applied as bonding agent (P< 0. 05). However, when SE Bond was utilized hybrid composite demonstrated significantly lower bond strength than that of other two groups (P< 0. 05).   Conclusion: The performance of a particular composite is affected by the bonding system that is applied.

Teeth were bathed in saliva for 48 hours to form a pellicle. Treatments were assigned as follows: Group 1 was pumiced for 10 seconds and pre-etched for five seconds with 37 % phosphoric acid before bonding with self-etching primer (Transbond Plus). Group 2 was pumiced for ten seconds before <b>bonding.</b> <b>Group</b> 3 was pre-etched for five seconds before <b>bonding.</b> <b>Group</b> 4 had no mechanical or chemical preparation before bonding. All teeth were stored in distilled water for 24 hours at 37 oC before debonding. The SBS values and Adhesive Remnant Index (ARI) score were recorded. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to investigate the enamel changes at each stage of surface preparation and bonding. The SBS values (± 1 SD) for Groups 1 - 4 were 22. 9 ± 6. 1, 16. 1 ± 7. 3, 36. 2 ± 8. 2, and 13. 1 ± 10. 1 MPa, respectively. Two-way ANOVA and subsequent contrasts showed statistically significant differences among treatment groups. ARI scores indicated the majority of adhesive remained on the bracket for all 4 groups.

30|$|More recently, a semi-empirical bond {{constraint}} theory (SE-BCT) {{was proposed}} {{by one of}} the authors (JCP) to correlate the ease of glass formation in SiO 2 and chalcogenide glass with local bonding constraints associated with two-body bond-stretching and three-body bond-bending forces [4, 5]. The criterion for ease of glass formation was a mean-field relation equating the average number of stretching and bending constraints/atom with the network dimensionality of three. When applied to SiO 2, satisfaction of this criterion was met by assuming a broken bond bending constraint for the bridging O-atoms. This was inferred from the large bond angle distribution of the Si–O–Si <b>bonding</b> <b>group,</b> and the weak bonding force constant.

40|$|Session: Dental MaterialsObjectives: This {{laboratory}} study evaluated {{the effect of}} adjunctive application of ethanol-wet bonding and chlorhexidine with hydrophobic adhesive on bonding fiber posts to intraradicular dentine. Methods: After endodontic treatment, thirty-two extracted human teeth with single root and root canal were prepared for post space. The teeth were randomly divided into four groups (n= 8) after etching and rinsing for rewetting: Group 1 : Water-wet <b>bonding,</b> <b>Group</b> 2 : Water-wet bonding with 2 % chlorhexidine, Group 3 : Ethanol-wet <b>bonding,</b> <b>Group</b> 4 : Ethanol-wet bonding with 2 % chlorhexidine. The rewetting agent was applied for 60 seconds. Two coats of primer (50 wt% of 100 % ethanol and 50 wt% of hydrophobic resin) followed by hydrophobic resin application were applied to root dentine and light-cured for 40 seconds. The fiber post was subsequently luted to bonded root dentine using dual cure resin cement. After 24 hr, five bonded roots from each group were subjected to push-out bond strength testing and subsequent failure mode analysis. Bond strength data were evaluated using two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s test (α= 0. 05). Three teeth from each group were sectioned and interfacial nanoleakage was examined using a field-emission scanning electron microscopy and analyzed using chi-square test (α= 0. 05). Results: Groups 3 and 4 showed significantly higher bond strengths and significantly lower interfacial nanoleakage, when compared to Groups 1 and 2. Addition of 2 % CHX to ethanol-wet bonding did not alter the bond strength of hydrophobic adhesive to intraradicular dentine. No significant difference in bond strength was found at different root regions. Conclusions: Ethanol-wet bonding with a hydrophobic adhesive improved bond strength of fiber post luted to radicular dentine.
