40|$|Four {{models for}} the {{component}} dynamics in polymer blends are briefly reviewed, {{with an emphasis on}} their abili-ty to describe anomalous segmental relaxation behavior, secondary relaxations in <b>blends,</b> <b>mixtures</b> which include small molecules, and properties in the concentration limits of probe molecules and neat polymers. While general features of the segmental dynamics of polymer blends can be accounted for by all of these models, only that of the authors address-es all these particular aspects of blend dynamics. Our conclusion is that assessment of blend dynamics models should extend beyond intuitive appeal or general properties, with due attention given to the more subtle and exceptional behaviors...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Polymer <b>blends,</b> <b>mixtures,</b> or block {{copolymers}} can be cross-linked in {{a homogeneous}} state forming a multicomponent network. Upon cooling such network, the repulsion between different components {{may lead to}} a microphase separation into regions rich in each of these components. The main difference of the microphase separation in multicomponent networks from, say, that in block copolymers is that there are quenched random elastic forces acting on the microphase regions from the cross-links of the network. We demonstrate that these forces destroy the long-range order of micro-structures in undeformed or isotropically swollen network. The system is broken into correlation regions significantly larger than the period of microstructures. The long-range orientational order appears upon anisotropic deformation of the network. 1...|$|E

40|$|In flavor perception, both {{experience}} with the components of odor/taste mixtures and the cognitive strategy {{used to examine the}} interactions between the components influence the overall mixture perception. However, the effect of these factors on odor mixtures perception has never been studied. The present study aimed at evaluating whether 1) previous exposure to the odorants included in a mixture or 2) the synthetic or analytic strategy engaged during odorants mixture evaluation determines odor representation. <b>Blending</b> <b>mixtures,</b> in which subjects perceived a unique quality distinct from those of components, were chosen in order to induce a priori synthetic perception. In the first part, we checked whether the chosen <b>mixtures</b> presented <b>blending</b> properties for our subjects. In the second part, 3 groups of participants were either exposed to the odorants contributing to <b>blending</b> <b>mixtures</b> with a "pineapple" or a "red cordial" odor or nonexposed. In a following task, half of each group was assigned to a synthetic or an analytical task. The synthetic task consisted of rating how typical (i. e., representative) of the target odor name (pineapple or red cordial) were the mixtures and each of their components. The analytical task consisted of evaluating these stimuli on several scales labeled with the target odor name and odor descriptors of the components. Previous exposure to mixture components was found to decrease mixture typicality but only for the pineapple <b>blending</b> <b>mixture.</b> Likewise, subjects engaged in an analytical task rated both <b>blending</b> <b>mixtures</b> as less typical than did subjects engaged in a synthetic task. This study supports a conclusion that odor mixtures can be perceived either analytically or synthetically according to the cognitive strategy engaged...|$|R
50|$|Pyrolysis {{gasoline}} or Pygas is a naphtha-range {{product with}} a high aromatics content. It is a by-product of high temperature naphtha cracking during ethylene and propylene production. Also, it is a high octane number mixture which contains aromatics, olefins and paraffins ranging from C5s to C12s. PyGas has high potential {{for use as a}} gasoline <b>blending</b> <b>mixture</b> and/or as a source of aromatics. Currently, PyGas is generally used as a gasoline <b>blending</b> <b>mixture</b> due to its high octane number. Depending on the feedstock used to produce the olefins, steam cracking can produce a benzene-rich liquid by-product called pyrolysis gasoline. Pyrolysis gasoline can be blended with other hydrocarbons as a gasoline additive, or distilled (in BTX process) to separate it into its components, including benzene.|$|R
40|$|Immiscible polymer blends {{are used}} {{increasingly}} {{as an alternative}} for synthesizing totally new polymers. Blend properties in general and their flow behaviour in particular remain largely unknown owing to their complex microstructure. Due {{to the presence of}} an interface, they display a flow behaviour that differs from that of pure polymers. The present study focuses on the steady state shear now of two-phase polymer <b>blends.</b> <b>Mixtures</b> of poly(isobutene) and poly(dimethylsiloxane), that are liquid at room temperature, have been used as model systems. The viscosity and especially the elasticity of blends show a significant increase as compared with a linear mixing rule for the contribution of the pure components. The effect of shear rate, concentration and viscosity ratio on the steady shear characteristics has been studied experimentally and the results have been compared with predictions of suspension and emulsion models.

40|$|The lipids in {{feedstuffs}} commonly {{consumed by}} swine consist mainly of neutral fats, specifically triglycerides. The concentration of fats in feedstuffs varies widely. Fat levels range from 1. 5 to 4. 5 % among cereal grains, 4. 5 to 10 % among high oil corn lines,. 5 to 9 % in fibrous byproducts,. 5 to 20 % in common protein feedstuffs, and 90 to 99 % in supplemental fat sources. Consequently, {{the level of}} fat in a particular diet {{is dependent on the}} type of basic feedstuffs included as well as the level of a supplemental fat source. For example, corn (standard yellow dent) and wheat contain about 3. 9 and 1. 7 % fat, respectively. Inclusion of wheat for corn in a simple corn-soybean meal mix effectively lowers the fat content of the diet by one-half. Similarly, the replacement of half of the dehulled soybean meal (. 8 % fat) with full-fat beans (18 % fat) as the supplemental protein source in a corn-soy mix raises the dietary fat content from 3 to above 5 %. Supplemental fat sources commonly used in swine diets include animal fats (tallows, greases), vegetable oils (corn, soybeans), restaurant greases (spent oils and greases), and commercial <b>blends</b> (<b>mixtures</b> of vegetable oil, animal fats, restaurant grease). The composition of these fats largely differ in the type of fatty acids, the building blocks of fat, that are present.

40|$|For decades, {{hydrazine}} {{has been}} one of the most important and widely used monopropellants for spacecraft applications. The handling of the propellant is complicated by its high toxicity and the related safety issues. In addition, there are political efforts to restrict the usage of hydrazine. Therefore, low-toxic and ecologically friendly “green” monopropellants are currently being investigated internationally. The so-called nitrous oxide fuel <b>blends,</b> <b>mixtures</b> of nitrous oxide and hydrocarbons, are a promising group of propellants with a high specific impulse Isp. At the German Aerospace Center’s (DLR) Institute of Space Propulsion in Lampoldshausen, a mixture of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and ethene (C 2 H 4) is being investigated experimentally using a demonstrator unit. In the future, nitrous oxide and ethene are to be stored together in a single tank and in a liquefied state. At the current state of the test bench both components are stored separately and mixed in gaseous state in the feeding line. For the characterization of the propellant mixture and the combustion processes, new injectors are needed which allow a variation of the massflow and ensure safe test runs. As oxidizer and fuel are already mixed in the feeding line, prevention of a possible flashback is a main concern. Within the scope of this work, various new injectors are designed and tested. Former tests, the new injection systems, and hotgas tests carried out with those systems will be presented. By using porous sintered metals, flashbacks could be prevented. In exchange, a high pressure loss has to be accepted at this point. A first series of tests has been carried out to characterize the performance of the propellant combination and the combustion chamber could be ignited using a spark plug for the first time. However, during the course of this work, many failed tests indicated that the premixed state of the propellant and the related problem of flashbacks into the feeding line has to remain in the center of attention and requires further investigation...|$|E

30|$|Furthermore, the {{viscosity}} of the <b>blended</b> <b>mixture</b> {{is determined}} by the dilution rate as well as the viscosities and densities of the heavy crude oil and bitumen and the used diluents. The resulting blend of heavy crude oil and diluents has lower viscosity and therefore it is easier to pump at reduced cost. The dilution of heavy crude oil and bitumen to enhance transportation by pipelines requires two pipelines, one for the oil and another for the diluents. The use of diluents to enhance the transportability of heavy crude oil and bitumen in pipelines would be cost-effective, if the diluents are relatively cheap and readily available. The amount of diluents required for heavy crude oil, i.e. the ratio of diluents in the <b>blended</b> <b>mixture,</b> ranges from 0 to 20  %, while for bitumen it is in the range of 25 – 50  %.|$|R
40|$|This work {{examined}} {{the performance of}} swirl burners using different injection strategies for various substitute fuels. The research procedure involved various stages; firstly, an assessment study between two liquid fuels, a pure biodiesel and saturated biodiesel, compared to kerosene. Atomization forms were obtained, and a combustion test campaign was initiated using a generic swirl burner. Emissions and power outputs were measured at gas turbine relevant equivalence ratios. Excess oxygen and atomization trends in the biodiesel seem to be playing {{a significant role in}} the creation of emissions and flame stability when compared to kerosene. Secondly, an experimental study on the combustion of methane-carbon dioxide mixtures was achieved. Gas mixtures were examined by using different injection strategies with and without swirl and with and without central injection. A smaller 20 -kW swirl burner was used to analyse stability and emissions performance by using these blends and to study the impact of CO 2 addition. The burner configuration comprised a centre body with an annular, premixed gas/air jet introduced through five, 60 ° swirl vanes. CO 2 dilution reduced flame stability and operability range. The introduction of CO 2 decreases temperatures in the combustion zone thus producing a lessening in emissions of nitrous oxides across all equivalence ratios. Regarding injection regimes, the external purely premixed injection system has lower NOx and CO. Addition of CO 2 increases the lean blowout limit of all blends. In the last section, a new burner was finally employed to carry out trials using multi-phase injection, where, experimental work investigated the performance of a swirl burner using various mixtures of CO 2 /CH 4 blends with either diesel or biodiesel derived from cooking oil. The swirl burner was employed to analyse gas turbine combustion features under atmospheric conditions to quantify flame stability and emissions by using these fuels. The results revealed that the use of biodiesel and CO 2 /CH 4 <b>blends</b> <b>mixtures</b> led to lower CO production. Results showed that a notable reduction of 50...|$|E
