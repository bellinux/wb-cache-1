40|$|The {{subject of}} my {{bachelor}} thesis is {{the elaboration of}} a case study that deals with {{the preparation of the}} revenue side of the budget of the municipality Hodslavice. The main aim of my work is to determine the accuracy of the actual estimates of the municipality and to compare the accuracy of predictions of several statistical methods. I use these statistical methods: simple moving average, exponential smoothing, transformation moving average, regression against time with an exponential trend. Drawn from the analysis, I found that for the prediction of each type of revenue, there is a more accurate method than expert's assessment of the <b>budget</b> <b>administrator</b> in Hodslavice, but there can not be applies a single method of prediction for all types of revenues. The most accurate method for predicting taxes of individual revenues is exponential smoothing. However the differences between the predictions by this method and the expert's estimation of the administrator of the budget are minimal. Regression against time was the best in forecasting tax corporation income and value added tax. For real estate tax and non-tax revenue, which the municipality has at least some competence in influencing the future level of revenue appears to be the most accurate method of simple moving averages...|$|E

It included 104 students enrolled in the introductory business communication course. Half of the students composed a business letter by hand and half did so using WordPerfect word processing software. The students' letters were then graded using a letter evaluation form containing 17 business writing quality categories. T-Tests were conducted to determine if significant differences existed at the. 05 level in the 17 quality categories when: (1) handwritten letters were compared to those composed using word processing; (2) letters composed by students using word processing with previous word processing experience were compared to letters composed by students using word processing with no previous word processing experience; (3) letters composed by students using word processing with previous word processing experience were compared to handwritten letters; and (4) letters composed by students using word processing with no previous word processing experience were compared to handwritten letters.

40|$|This study {{described}} and analyzed {{the experiences of}} administrators in six Indiana school corporations that adopted a school-year budget under authorization provided by Public Law 50 (PL 50 - 1996). The study had the following objectives: (a) to identify reasons why school corporations {{became involved in the}} pilot project, (b) to determine what happened {{as a result of the}} pilot project, (c) to determine if the pilot project was perceived as successful by the school officials in the pilot group, and (d) to identify recommendations of superintendents and business officials about further use of a fiscal year budget in Indiana school corporations. A qualitative research methodology was used in this study. Data collection consisted of interviews with superintendents and business officials in the pilot group during January 2000. The administrators joined the pilot group because they believed all Indiana school corporations would eventually convert to a fiscal year budget and that their experiences would facilitate the conversion. They supported the concept of a fiscal year budget because it was congruous with the school-year. During implementation of the fiscal year <b>budget,</b> the <b>administrators</b> felt abandoned and did not receive the support they expected. Yet, based on their experiences with a fiscal year <b>budget,</b> the <b>administrators</b> supported a conversion to a fiscal year budget for all school corporations. Administrators recommended the state phase-in a fiscal year budget for other non-pilot school corporations. These findings suggest that administrators had valid reasons for joining the pilot group. In addition, administrators viewed the absence of key leaders at the state level as problematic for the pilot project. Based on the evidence, it appears that a fiscal year budget produced the following advantages for the participating corporation administrators: (a) allowed for better tracking of expenditures, (b) required less work to determine the cost of a school-year program, (c) allowed for more freedom in the summer, and (d) provided for a less stressful year-end. The success of the pilot group did not produce support for fiscal year budgets from either non-pilot school corporation officials or from state officials.

40|$|During {{economic}} downturns, {{college students}} can alter their postsecondary education decisions through several channels. This paper focuses on college major choice, one higher education decision that might change after a recession, {{and one that}} few researchers have explored. Due to data limitations, previous research is unable to provide definitive results on if, or how, matriculating freshmen change college majors during recessions. The data {{used for this study}} assuages those limitations and is obtained from the "Freshman Survey," administered by the Cooperative Institutional Research Program (CIRP). Building on what is already known about how students choose college majors and how they respond to information shocks, the theoretical model proposes that during economic downturns, students will switch to fields with higher relative wage and employment opportunities. First, this study finds that freshmen are less likely to have undeclared intended majors after recessions. Then, a multinomial logit empirical technique strongly suggests that after economic downturns, those who declare intended majors are more likely to choose ones that offer higher wages and provide more job security, like Technology, Business, Engineering and Health. University administrators can apply this empirical model to their own institutional-level data. In the presence of substantial <b>budget</b> cuts, <b>administrators</b> can anticipate the majors that will require more resources and those from which they can transfer resources to efficiently meet student demand. More broadly, these conclusions offer better information on labor force composition after recessions, which can enhance forecasting of likely shortages and surpluses in the labor market. ...|$|R

However, most reforms do not involve structural changes. As funding for higher education becomes increasingly squeezed within institutions, understanding how reforms, even those outside typical departmental priorities, can have a sustained impact which is critical to creating meaningful, lasting change. Sustained change often requires more than a change in practice; it involves aligning the culture with the change, ensuring values, beliefs, and rituals help institutionalize the reform amidst changing <b>administrators,</b> <b>budgets,</b> and staff expertise (Schein 1985).

40|$|Using unique data of Football Bowl Subdivision college {{football}} games, {{we examine the}} determinants of coach compensation, football expenses and performance. We find that coach compensation is highly related to the coach’s past success. Additionally, coach pay is higher when the institution has a larger fan base and the program has achieved a higher profit in the previous year. Football expenses are likewise determined by institutional characteristics such as the fan base, past profitability and historical success. Results suggest that coach compensation has no measurable impact on performance. A coach’s past success may impact their salary but their salary has no significant impact on future success. Though, an additional, aspirational increase in spending of $ 1 million on the football program can improve the probability of winning any particular game by 3. 5 % to 7. 0 %.

However, while {{studies have been conducted}} on the need for administrators fostering professional development in schools in the USA, there appears to be limited research on administrator views of professional development in international school environments. The {{purpose of this study was}} to consider views of administrators in international schools regarding professional development activities. Using a mixed methods sequential explanatory design, a questionnaire followed by in-depth interviews, data was collected from a convenience and purposive sample of administrators from international schools in Europe, Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Middle East so as to explore and provide answers to the main research question: “What are the views of administrators on how professional development is planned, implemented, evaluated and resourced in international schools?” Findings from quantitative data indicated strong agreement that administrators should work collaboratively with teachers to determine the professional development needs of the school and that teachers should be involved in assessing professional development effectiveness. Analysis of qualitative data indicated the following themes: teachers are sent to conferences/workshops for professional development or content experts are brought to the school; decisions about professional development should align with school goals; professional development needs should be determined by teachers and administrators collaboratively; there are no significant professional development evaluation processes in place; 2 % of the budget is standard allocation in schools for professional development and school boards approve the <b>budget</b> while <b>administrators</b> decide on allocation.
