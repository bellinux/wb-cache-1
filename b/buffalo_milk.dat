40|$|The {{effects of}} partial {{substitution}} of whole <b>buffalo’s</b> <b>milk</b> with reconstituted skim milk on the chemical, functional and sensory qualities, consumer acceptability, yield and production cost of mozzarella cheese were assessed. Mozzarella cheese from {{different combinations of}} <b>buffalo’s</b> <b>milk</b> and 12 % reconstituted skim milk (RSM) were prepared as follows: 100 % <b>buffalo’s</b> <b>milk</b> (T 1), 80 % <b>buffalo’s</b> <b>milk</b> and 20 % RSM (T 2), 70 % <b>buffalo’s</b> <b>milk</b> and 30 % RSM (T 3) and 60 % <b>buffalo’s</b> <b>milk</b> and 40 % RSM (T 4). The mozzarella cheese produced {{did not differ significantly}} among treatments in moisture, protein, salt and calorie contents. Substitution of <b>buffalo’s</b> <b>milk</b> with RSM did not influence the meltability of mozzarella but significantly decreased its stretchability. Sensory ratings on appearance, aroma, flavor, after-taste, stretchability and general acceptability did not differ among the different groups. Consumer acceptability ratings for T 2, T 3 and T 4 were consistently higher than T 1. Product yields of T 2, T 3 and T 4 were significantly lower than that of T 1. Production cost decreased with increased proportion of RSM but the cost of the finished cheese increased. Results indicate that any of the <b>buffalo’s</b> <b>milk</b> and 12 % RSM combinations can be used in the production of marketable mozzarella cheese...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Whole <b>buffalo's</b> and cow's <b>milk</b> {{as well as}} dairy {{products}} manufactured from them were analyzed for chemical composition and metal contents. <b>Buffalo's</b> <b>milk</b> showed higher levels of fat (4. 9 %), total protein (3. 6 %), total solids (13. 4 %) and ash (0. 76 %) than cow's milk (3. 2, 3. 2, 12. 1 and 0. 65 %, respectively). Also, higher levels were detected in pasteurized and sterilized <b>buffalo's</b> <b>milk.</b> However, lactose content in cow's milk was higher (5. 0 %) than <b>buffalo's</b> <b>milk</b> (4. 8 %). Most of gross composition was found at higher levels in cream, butter, samna (ghee) and yoghurt from <b>buffalo's</b> <b>milk</b> as compared with cow's milk.

40|$|Background Xylene {{is widely}} used in the {{industry}} and medical technology as a solvent, besides occupational exposure. It {{has the potential to}} be toxic in humans and animals. Objectives The present study was carried out to determine the protective effects of buffalo’ milk (BM) against xylene-induced liver and kidney damage. Methods A total 42 male rats were randomly assigned into 7 groups. The rats in group I was the control. Groups II, III and IV were received 1 mL distilled water ten minutes prior to administration of xylene (X) at doses of 0. 81, 0. 162 and 0. 324 mmole/kg. Rats in groups of V,VI and VII were received 1 mL <b>buffalo’s</b> <b>milk</b> 10 minutes prior to administration of X (ip) at doses of 0. 81, 0. 162 and 0. 324 mmole/kg. The experiment repeated for 7 consecutive days. 24 hours after last administrations, all animals were killed with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital. The blood was then collected for determination of biochemical tests including alanine aminotransferase (ALT),aspartate aminotransferase (AST),alkaline phosphatase (ALP),blood urea nitrogen (BUN),creatinine (CR),catalase (CAT),superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH). The liver and kidney tissues were removed, fixed and processed for light microscopy. Results Biochemical analyses indicated a significant decline in the activities of SOD, CAT and GSH level and markedly increased ALT, AST, ALP, BUN, CR when compared to those in non-treated rats (control). Dose-dependent injuries in rat liver and kidneys were also observed in xylene treated rats. <b>Buffalo’s</b> <b>milk</b> protected all biochemical parameters against xylene-induced toxicity. It also protected liver and kidney tissues against xylene produced cell damage. Conclusions The results of this study supports the view that xylene induces liver and kidney injury. <b>Buffalo’s</b> <b>milk</b> has potential to protect liver and kidney against xylene toxicit...|$|R

25|$|Da-hi is a yogurt of the Indian subcontinent, {{known for}} its {{characteristic}} taste and consistency. The word da-hi seems {{to be derived from}} the Sanskrit word dadhi, one of the five elixirs, or panchamrita, often used in Hindu ritual. Dahi also holds cultural symbolism in many homes in the Mithila region of Nepal and Bihar. Yogurt balances the palate across regional cuisines throughout India. In the hot and humid south, yogurt and foods made of yogurt are a staple in order to cool down – yogurt rice is always the last dish of the meal. Also, the vegetarian population of India derives some protein from yogurt (other than lentil and beans). Sweet yogurt (meesti doi or meethi dahi) is common in eastern parts of India, made by fermenting sweetened milk. While cow's milk is considered sacred and is currently the primary ingredient for yogurt, goat and <b>buffalo</b> <b>milk</b> were widely used in the past, and valued for the fat content (see buffalo curd).
