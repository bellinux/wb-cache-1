5|$|Although men {{and money}} had been secured, the markets {{component}} of the Bruce plan was never fully realised. At the 1923 Imperial Economic Conference, Bruce lobbied consistently for the Conservative government of Stanley Baldwin to make changes to Great Britain's trading arrangements to give preference to dominion products over imports from other nations. He argued for Empire-wide economic trading arrangements that filled domestic demands by production from member states before seeking supplemental imports from other countries and empires. Baldwin and the Conservatives attempted to introduce such a scheme in Britain; however, the British public feared higher prices for <b>basic</b> <b>products</b> (particularly food), and this fear {{was a factor in}} the Conservative government's defeat in the election of December 1923. Baldwin's successor Ramsay MacDonald repudiated the plan, much to Bruce's chagrin, and attempts to revive negotiations foundered as economic conditions worsened throughout the decade. World agricultural prices stalled in the mid-1920s as European and American agricultural production recovered to pre-war levels, and Australian exports were crowded out of markets as the decade progressed.|$|E

This involves selling a <b>basic</b> <b>product</b> at a loss (or low profit margin), but receiving very high profit margins on associated products that are necessary for the <b>basic</b> <b>product's</b> continued usage. Examples of this strategy include razors (and their blades), computer printers (and their ink cartridge refills), cell phones (and their usage time), and cameras (and film).|$|R

25|$|Economists {{state that}} the Venezuelan {{government}} began rationing in 2014 due to multiple issues, including an unproductive domestic industry that has been negatively affected by nationalizations and government intervention, and confusing currency controls that made it unable to provide the dollars importers need {{to pay for the}} majority of <b>basic</b> <b>products</b> that enter Venezuela. According to Venezuelan residents, the government also rations public water to those who use water over 108 hours a week due to the nation's poor water delivery systems. Gasoline is also rationed in Venezuela allegedly due to smuggling of the subsidized Venezuelan gasoline to Colombia where it is sold for a higher price.|$|E
25|$|The town of Pinal de Amoles, {{was founded}} as Real de San José de Amoles, {{in the early}} 17th century as a mining camp. Today, much of that mining has disappeared, but the town remains.

[...] As a result, a number of colonists began to boycott imported goods in favor of domestic goods. The boycott was not initially widespread, especially as {{it could not be}} officially enforced, and so lacked luster in a number of regions. Increasing support for this boycott, however, helped generate the revolution against England.|$|E
500|$|Starting in 1922, the {{production}} of Grodziskie was continued by only one company, Zjednoczone Browary Grodziskie (United Grodzisk Breweries). [...] Between 1929 and 1993, this style had a regionally protected designation put {{in place by the}} cabinet of Poland. [...] Production continued under the German occupation of Poland during World War II, and the beer was distributed to German forces fighting in the war. [...] After the Second World War, the breweries were nationalized, and the beer began a period of decline. [...] The communist government in Poland emphasized the large-scale production of <b>basic</b> <b>products</b> like bread, milk, and sugar, and local culinary traditions were neglected. [...] In part, this was due to restrictions on individual businesses and the inability of brewers to profit from {{the production}} of small-scale, high-quality foods, and their inability to advertise local goods and specialties. [...] In the early 1980s, different variations of the style were created with different colors and alcohol strengths. [...] After the Communist period in Poland ended in 1989, production continued under the private ownership of Lech Browary Wielkopolski, but ended in 1993, when the brewery was closed due to lack of profitability, and because of the difficulty in finding workers who had experience producing the style. [...] Commercial production of this style ceased for several years, but since 2010, some breweries have produced seasonal or limited production runs of the style.|$|E
