5|$|The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), a {{component}} of the USDA, provides the funds to the Puerto Rican government's Department of the Family to operate the program through an annual <b>block</b> <b>grant,</b> which covers the full cost of the benefits to participants, as well as fifty percent (50%) of the costs required to administer the program (the remaining 50% must be provided by the Puerto Rican government). Although federal regulations require Puerto Rico to pay the benefits during the year for which the annual <b>block</b> <b>grant</b> was awarded, since 2002 the federal government has allowed Puerto Rico to use 2% of an annual surplus for benefits in future years.|$|E

40|$|Current {{proposals}} would convert many domestic {{assistance programs}} into Federal <b>block</b> <b>grants</b> {{to be administered}} by State governments. <b>Block</b> <b>grants</b> give States broad discretion on how Federal funds are spent.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a theoretical explanation why {{it may be}} optimal for higher-level governments to pay categorical <b>block</b> <b>grants</b> or closed-ended matching grants to local governments. We consider a federation with two types of local governments which differ {{in the cost of}} providing public goods. The federal government redistributes between jurisdictions, but cannot observe the type of a jurisdiction. In this asymmetric information setting it is shown that the second-best optimum can be decentralized with the help of categorical <b>block</b> <b>grants</b> and closed-ended matching grants, but not with unconditional <b>block</b> <b>grants</b> or open-ended matching grants. asymmetric information, categorical <b>block</b> <b>grants,</b> closed-ended matching grants...|$|R
5|$|To {{address these}} issues, the 1981 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) {{eliminated}} Puerto Rico {{from the national}} Food Stamp program and created the Nutrition Assistance Program for Puerto Rico as a <b>block</b> <b>grant</b> to provide more administrative flexibility to the Commonwealth while reducing Federal expenditures. After a year of studies and design, it commenced operations on July 1, 1982 with an annual appropriation of $825 million.|$|E
5|$|Advances {{of funds}} â€“ Advances are federal funds {{provided}} to a recipient {{before the program}} activity is performed. Recipients determine the amount needed for a future expenditure (e.g., through budget process) and request the amount {{to the federal government}} (or in the case of subrecipients to the pass-through entity, see Subrecipient Monitoring below). The federal funds received are then expended to perform the specific activity (e.g., purchase good or service or for payroll). However, laws and regulations require recipients to request funds only when it is immediately needed, and recipients must try to minimize the amount of time between the receipts of funds to the actual disbursement. Examples of programs under these funding techniques are the Section 8 program and the Community Development <b>Block</b> <b>Grant</b> program.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the years}} {{there has been}} a gradual decline in {{participation}} in the nutrition assistance program. Participation in the previous Food Stamp program was estimated at 56%, more than 1.5 million island residents, before the creation of the <b>block</b> <b>grant.</b> By 1994, participation in the NAP program had decreased to 1.3 million, and by 2006 it had decreased to just over 1 million. While the Puerto Rican population has steadily increased throughout those periods, the percentage of the population participating in the nutrition assistance program has significantly declined. With Puerto Rico's current population estimated at 3,944,000 residents and a current estimated NAP participation of 1 million beneficiaries, the program's participation rate is roughly 26%, almost half of the participation under the original Food Stamp program in 1981.|$|E

5|$|According to Congressman Jim Himes' website, the {{demolition}} funding was appropriated in 2009 {{and consisted of}} more than $2 million through federal funding. The money was funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the Comprehensive Appropriations Act of 2009, and a Community Development <b>Block</b> <b>Grant.</b> According to the Connecticut Post, the State of Connecticut funded $1.2 million for {{the demolition}} of the bridge, and {{the first phase of}} the project was expected to cost $500,000. The contract for the demolition of the bridge was given to S Corporation and the first task was to remove the eastern portion of the bridge. The entire process was expected to take six weeks to demolish the bridge. It was estimated that another $450,000 would be needed to remove the bridge's concrete counter-weights and $8 million to remove the approaches. In 2010, the Drawbridge Operation Regulation; Pequonnock River, Bridgeport, CT struck the rule pertaining to the operation of the bridge due to its removal.|$|E
5|$|By 2000, the city's Christmas decorations also {{included}} lighted snowflakes on the utility poles of Easton streets surrounding the Peace Candle. The 32 six-foot snowflake decorations cost just over $10,800, which were funded {{in part by}} a $6,000 Community Development <b>Block</b> <b>Grant</b> secured by the city. The Easton Holiday Committee said it was becoming increasing difficult to raise sufficient funds for the holiday display and sought $10,000 from the city council, but they were rejected. In response, six of the eleven Easton Holiday Committee members resigned in March 2001, prompting fear that the Peace Candle would not be erected during its 50th anniversary that following holiday season. However, the committee was filled with new volunteers who revamped efforts to raise funds through the sale of wax candles and greeting cards. The Peace Candle was lit during a ceremony on November 23, 2001, in dedication to the victims of the September 11 terrorist attacks, as well as rescue workers from New York City, The Pentagon and Somerset County, Pennsylvania who responded the day of the attacks.|$|E
5|$|The new <b>block</b> <b>grant</b> program {{differed}} {{significantly from the}} former Food Stamp program in three major ways. First, the new NAP program was designed to distribute the benefits through physical cheques, ensuring that the benefit would be payable only to the beneficiary {{while at the same}} time reducing administrative costs, since the former physical vouchers (cupones in Spanish) were subject to storage and accountability problems, theft, counterfeiting and even trafficking. Second, the benefits were no longer restricted to vouchers redeemable only for food, but were provided in cash. The beneficiary could then elect to purchase a product or select services other than food. Third, the overall assistance provided to Puerto Rico was limited to an annual block appropriation, requiring the Puerto Rican government to adjust its program management to allocate the funds. Between 1982 and 1986, the U.S. Congress awarded $825 million annually in block grants for NAP program, and since then the appropriations have steadily increased by an estimated 3% to 4% to compensate for inflation. It has surpassed $1 billion annually since the early 1990s, and increased 30% from 1993 to 2002. Since fiscal year 2006, the appropriation has reached over $1.5 billion annually.|$|E
