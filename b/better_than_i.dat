500|$|In 1910, Vanderbilt's only blemish was {{fighting}} defending national champion Yale to a scoreless tie. Team captain Bill Neely, recalling the tie with Yale said: [...] "The score {{tells the story}} a good deal <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> can. All I {{want to say is}} that I never saw a football team fight any harder at every point than Vanderbilt fought today – line, ends, and backfield. We went in to give Yale the best we had and I think we about did it." [...] The team was led by third-team Walter Camp All-American guard Will Metzger, and piloted by Morrison.|$|E

While relegated to a second-string role, Vick said he knew he could still play at a high level. Asked if he wanted the Eagles to pick up the second year of his contract, he said, [...] "I hope so...I feel like I'm {{probably}} <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> ever was in my career, as far as the mental aspect of the game." [...] The Eagles exercised his option for 2010 in March and Vick received a $1.5 million roster bonus.|$|E

500|$|The Cars did not {{add a new}} bassist to {{the lineup}} to replace Orr; instead, the album's bass parts were {{programmed}} or performed by Hawkes and Lee, with Hawkes playing a bass once owned by Orr. While Ocasek and Orr split vocal duties on past albums, Ocasek sings lead on all the tracks from Move Like This. In a Rolling Stone interview, Ocasek said, [...] "I was aware that on half of the new songs, Ben would have done <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> did. But we never wanted anybody from the outside."

500|$|While {{flying a}} Bristol Scout on 16 May 1916, Ball scored his first aerial victory, driving down a German {{reconnaissance}} aircraft. He then switched to Nieuports, bringing down two LVGs on 29 May and a Fokker Eindecker on 1 June. On 25 June {{he became a}} balloon buster and an ace by destroying an observation balloon with phosphor bombs. During the month he had written to his parents admonishing them to try and [...] "take it well" [...] if he was killed, [...] "for men tons <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> go in hundreds every day". He again achieved two victories in one sortie on 2 July, shooting down a Roland C.II and an Aviatik to bring his score to seven.|$|E
500|$|In 1995, Green Day {{released}} Insomniac, {{which did}} not perform as well commercially as the band's breakthrough major-label debut Dookie (1994). Speaking of Insomniac, vocalist/guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong noted, [...] "It did a lot <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> {{thought it was going}} to do...From the sound of it, we knew it wasn't going to sell as much as Dookie." [...] The group embarked on an extensive world tour to promote Insomniac in early 1996, which saw the band performing in sports arenas that contrasted with the small clubs the group was accustomed to playing. [...] The members became increasingly uncomfortable with the level of stardom they had attained; Armstrong recalled, [...] "We were becoming the things we hated, playing those big arenas.

500|$|The {{episode was}} well {{received}} by {{the cast and crew}} of The X-Files. Producer J.P. Finn praised the episode and Carter's directing, saying [...] "We were all pretty nervous doing that one, because Chris Carter was a new director. It turned out that he directed very...It was a great script, a great cast, and he ended up directing a home run. One of the charming things about it was the end, where we had these alien heads placed on young children. It was so endearing to see them on the set between takes, playing with Chris and everyone". Actor David Duchovny said of Carter's directing [...] "Chris came in meticulously prepared, which is his nature. I think his first episode was great". Carter himself described it as one of his favorite episodes because [...] "it was a chance for me to sort of do it all, and it came out in ways <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> imagined it would".|$|E
500|$|Other {{critics were}} more negative. Rolling Stone called it [...] "mundane...with a {{predictable}} script", {{and at one}} point described Simpson's singing as [...] "wailing in lieu of hitting notes". [...] In its review, the BBC said that [...] "half the album ... feels self indulgent and lacks substance", but also said that [...] "in between the formulaic, innocuous songs are a smattering of catchy pop-rock tracks." [...] IGN.com called it [...] "by-the-books, generic (and at times bland) pop/rock", although it did say Simpson's vocals showed maturity and promise. A writer for Stylus magazine commented that [...] "after spending more than forty minutes with Ashlee, I feel like I don’t know her any <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> did beforehand... for a record with the name Autobiography, it seems like no bigger criticism could be leveled." [...] The New York Times said that Autobiography [...] "is a thoroughly calculated package, aiming for the same audience that embraces Avril Lavigne and Pink." ...|$|E

After the release of Icewind Dale II, Sawyer expressed dissatisfaction over the Icewind Dale series, saying that, [...] "I wasn't particularly thrilled with how my work on [...] came out..." [...] and, [...] "... managed to actually be worse than my Icewind Dale stuff." [...] In regards to Icewind Dale II he said, [...] " [...] came out <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> expected, but still, not exactly awe-inspiring." [...] Chris Avellone later said, [...] "Icewind Dale was a fun series, but it didn't try to set the bar for {{anything other than a}} fun romp. People may remember enjoying it, but it wasn’t trying to break any new ground or do anything revolutionary. In some respects, it was almost a step back from other games we'd done and focused more on exploration and dungeon crawls." [...] A Collector's Edition containing bonus material, such as a full-color cloth map and soundtrack CD, was also released. Icewind Dale II was the final game developed using the Infinity Engine.|$|E

500|$|Dan Casey {{writing for}} Nerdist felt the episode was [...] "the most dramatic, tense hour of {{television}} we’ve seen from" [...] the series, stating that [...] "One of the show’s biggest problems {{has been its}} general lack of depth, particularly {{in terms of the}} characters and making them feel like real people rather than glossy superspies with a seemingly endless wellspring of one-liners" [...] and decided that the episode [...] "made significant steps towards fixing this problem, thanks to some wonderful character interactions and an exploration of Fitz/Simmons’ past". James Hunt of Den of Geek said [...] "whether this episode continues the show's upwards trend, that's debatable. It could've been worse, but there wasn't the leap forward that we saw from episode three to four, or four to five. I'll say this for an episode: it was <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> thought a Fitz & Simmons episode would be. That's progress, of a sort." [...] Jim Steranko, known for his work on Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., criticized the scope and scale of the episode, but praised the character development for Coulson, feeling it brought his character closer to the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents of the comics.|$|E
500|$|The album {{features}} the Foo Fighters' first instrumental, [...] "Ballad of the Beaconsfield Miners". [...] It {{was written by}} Grohl after meeting {{with one of the}} miners involved in the Beaconsfield mine collapse who requested an iPod with In Your Honor in it during the incident. As Grohl was moved by this action, he decided to [...] "write something just to dedicate to him that night because he definitely seemed like a hero", and later promised to include the instrumental on the album. The album version features Kaki King, whom Grohl invited to record the song as she was visiting Studio 606. Grohl later said that [...] "I showed it to her once, and she shredded 10 times <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> ever played it". Another guest was guitarist Pat Smear, who had been a bandmember from 1995 to 1998, and a guest musician on the tour for In Your Honor. Smear, who has since been reinstated as a full-on member, described his participation as [...] "the oddest recording experience I had with Foo Fighters" [...] given he had no input in composition and was [...] "going in and playing on a song that was already written".|$|E
500|$|After {{leaving the}} Air Force, Rowland {{continued}} to live in Canberra, consulting part-time for French arms concern Ofema. In late 1980 he was recommended {{by the government of}} Premier Neville Wran to serve as the next Governor of New South Wales, replacing Sir Roden Cutler. Rowland admitted {{that he did not have}} [...] "the faintest idea" [...] why he was chosen, and thought that [...] "there must be a lot of people who could do it a lot <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> could". He saw the role as the monarch's representative in New South Wales as helping to provide [...] "a valuable link with an older part of the world". Wran, for his part, was understood to have chosen Rowland largely on the basis of his engaging personality; it was also said that the Premier preferred military men for vice-regal office because [...] "they knew how to take orders". Rowland was duly appointed by Queen ElizabethII on 20January 1981. Upon taking office, he declared that he wished to be seen as a [...] "man of the people". To this end, he opened Government House to the public on a more frequent basis, and also extended invitations for official functions to a broader range of society than was previously the case.|$|E

500|$|The two Dudley {{brothers}} {{were on the}} closest personal terms and Ambrose said of Robert: [...] "there is no man [...] knoweth his doings <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> myself", while Robert's recurrent phrase about Ambrose was: [...] "him I love as myself". Elizabeth, who liked Warwick, loved to joke that he was neither as graceful nor as handsome as his brotherand stouter as well. Lacking a grand London residence of his own, Warwick had his suite of rooms in the palatial Leicester House: [...] "the Lord of Warwick's bedchamber, the Lord of Warwick's closet, the Lord of Warwick's dining parlour". In the administration of their lands the brothers shared their estate managers and lawyers, while their local affinities consisted of the same gentry families. Privately, they were [...] "almost inseparable", passing time together whenever possible. When Robert Dudley had incurred the Queen's wrath while serving in the Netherlands as Governor-General in 1586, Ambrose wrote to him: [...] "if I were you ... I {{would go to the}} furthest part of Christendom rather than ever come into England again. ... Let me have your best advice what is best for me to do, for that I mean to take such part as you do." ...|$|E
500|$|Shakira {{felt it was}} {{something}} she had not [...] "tapped into {{for the past three}} years," [...] and its inclusion in the album resulted in [...] "very intense, very romantic" [...] songs. [...] "Antes de las Seis" [...] is one such song from the album. The Latin pop ballad was written and produced by Shakira and her frequent collaborator Lester Mendez, who had previously worked with her on songs including [...] "Underneath Your Clothes" [...] (2002) and [...] "La Tortura" [...] (2005). The musical instrumentation of the song is simple and consists of a piano and acoustic guitar. According to Jennifer Schaffer from The Stanford Daily, its [...] "softer" [...] production helps in putting the focus on Shakira's voice, which she opined had been [...] "stripped to its sensitive core." [...] The singer delivers sad and emotional vocals that address issues of [...] "longing, regrets and loneliness." [...] Shakira talked about the deep meaning behind the balladry of the album and expressed difficulty in explaining it, saying: [...] "We all go through hard moments. Whatever happened, it's right there in the songs. I've decided that I'm not going to explain every song this time. It's hard to explain a song. These songs explain me <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> can explain them." ...|$|E
500|$|Rowling {{stated that}} she had Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince [...] "planned for years", but she spent two months going over her plan before she began writing seriously. This was a lesson learned after she did not check the plan for Goblet of Fire and had to rewrite {{a third of the}} book. She started writing the book before her second child, David, was born, but she took a break to care for him. The first chapter, [...] "The Other Minister", which {{features}} the meeting between the Muggle Prime Minister, the Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge, and his successor, Rufus Scrimgeour, was a concept Rowling tried to start in Philosopher's Stone, Prisoner of Azkaban, and Order of the Phoenix, but she found [...] "it finally works" [...] in Half-Blood Prince. She stated that she was [...] "seriously upset" [...] writing the end of the book, although Goblet of Fire was the hardest to write. When asked if she liked the book, she responded, [...] "I like it <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> liked 'Goblet', 'Phoenix' or 'Chamber' when I finished them. Book six does what I wanted it to do and even if nobody else likes it (and some won't), I know it will remain one of my favourites of the series.
