30|$|Using {{the mass}} of {{time-varying}} length <b>balance</b> <b>rope</b> focused on the hoisting conveyance, the coupling longitudinal-transverse model of mine friction hoist was established by using of the Hamilton’s principle. The modified Galerkin’s method was used to discretize partial differential Eqs. The mine hoisting system was used to the example to analysis {{the relation between the}} load, velocity and transverse vibration of rope. The in situ tests were illustrated to evaluate the proposed mathematical model. The results showed that the modeling method can well represent the transverse vibration of rope.|$|E
40|$|The {{conceptual}} design {{is based on}} a Koepe hoist and is intended for transport of the POLLUX casks with a large hoisting cage and counterweight. The hoisting engine is comprised in a winding tower, with a designed rope load of approx. 214. 2 t in the hoistway, and of approx. 171. 7 t in the balance pit. The hoisting equipment is designed as an 8 -rope system with the ropes measuring approx. 50 mm across. The design was {{to take into account the}} {{conceptual design}} of the planned radwaste repository, characterized by the fact that the upcast shaft (shaft hoisting system shaft 2) is to serve as the transport shaft for radwaste containers, as this function requires additional airlocks in order to avoid shortcircuiting of air. The design comprises all in all the port for the hoisting car receiving the containers from a cross-gate, the shaft emplacement equipment, the hoisting tower, control equipment, the shaft furniture, the hoisting engine, the ropes and materials handling device, the counterweight, communicators, <b>balance</b> <b>rope</b> devices, and the electric system. (orig. /HP) Es ist eine Koepe-Schachtfoerderanlage fuer POLLUX-Behaelter mit Grosskorb und Gegengewicht geplant. Fuer die Foerdermaschine wird eine Turmanordnung zugrunde gelegt. Die Seillast im Foerderturm wird ca. 214, 2 t und die Seillast im Gegengewichtsturm ca. 171, 7 t betragen. Die Schachtfoerderanlage ist als 8 -Seil-Anlage konzipiert mit einem Einzelseildurchmesser von ca. 50 mm. Bei der Auslegung war die Konzeption eines Endlagers, bei der der ausziehende Wetterschacht (Schachtfoerderanlage Schacht 2) als Transportschacht fuer radioaktive Endlagergebinde vorgesehen ist, zu beruecksichtigen, da hier zusaetzlich Schachtschleusen vorhanden sein muessen um einen sogenannten Wetterkurzschluss zu vermeiden. Die konzeptionelle Auslegung umfasst, beginnend bei der Bereitstellungsposition des Plateauwagens nach der Uebergabe aus einem Querverschub, die Schachtbeschickungseinrichtung, den Foerderturm, die Schachtsteuerung, die Einrichtungen des Schachtes, die Foerdermaschine, die Seile sowie die Foerdermittel, Gegengewicht, Zwischengeschirre, Unterseilaufhaengungen und die Stromversorgung.

30|$|The {{model was}} {{established}} {{on the following}} assumptions: (1) Young’s modulus E, cross section area A, and mass per unit length were always constants; (2) The bending stiffness of rope and influence of air current were ignored; (3) The hoist ropes were simplified as single rope with the equivalent cross-section area. The rope was modeled as a taut string; (4) The mass of time-varying <b>balance</b> <b>ropes</b> was focused on conveyance.|$|R
30|$|The {{example of}} mine {{hoisting}} system was illustrated {{to evaluate the}} proposed mathematical model. The maximum hoisting height and acceleration were 263  m and 0.6  m/s 2. The mass of container was 46000  kg. There were six hoisting ropes and mass per unit length was 8.52  kg/m. And the mass per unit length of three <b>balance</b> <b>ropes</b> was 16.8  kg/m. The normal load range was 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42 and 49 kN and the speed was 6, 7 and 8  m/s.|$|R

50|$|Bells hung {{for full}} circle ringing are swung through {{just over a}} {{complete}} circle from mouth uppermost.

The bells are controlled by ringers (one to a bell) in a chamber below, who rotate the bell to through a full circle and back, and control the speed of oscillation when the bell is mouth upwards at the balance-point, when little effort is required.|$|R

However automatic imitative tendencies are generally inhibited {{and it remains}} unclear in which conditions mere action observation triggers motor behaviours. In this study, we addressed the question of contagious postural responses when observing human imbalance. Methodology/Principal Findings: We recorded participants' body sway while they observed a fixation cross (control condition), an upright point-light display of a gymnast <b>balancing</b> on a <b>rope,</b> and the same point-light display presented upside down. Our results showed that, when the upright stimulus was displayed prior to the inverted one, centre of pressure area and antero-posterior path length were significantly greater in the upright condition compared to the control and upside down conditions. Conclusions/Significance: These results demonstrate a contagious postural reaction suggesting a partial inefficiency of inhibitory processes. Further, kinematic information was sufficient to trigger this reaction. The difference recorded between the upright and upside down conditions indicates that the contagion effect was dependent on the integration of gravity constraints by body kinematics. Interestingly, the postural response was sensitive to habituation, and seemed to disappear when the observer was previously shown an inverted display. The motor contagion recorded here {{is consistent with previous}} work showing vegetative output during observation of an effortful movement and could indicate that lower level control facilitates contagion effects...|$|R

Training was performed within 6 weeks, 5 times per week for 10 [*]min each day. Balance (static and dynamic stance), countermovement jumps, reverse balancing on beams (3, 4. 5 and 6 [*]cm width), slackline standing (single- and double-limb) and electromyographic activity (soleus, gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior) were examined. INT significantly improved single- and double-limb slackline standing (double limb: 5. 1 (3. 4) s- 17. 2 (14. 4) s; right leg: 8. 2 (5. 8) s- 38. 3 (36. 0) s; left leg: 10. 6 (5. 8) s- 49. 0 (56. 3) s; p< 0. 001; 0. 17 <ηp²< 0. 22).
