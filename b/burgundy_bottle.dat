50|$|The wines of Bodegas Faustino are {{presented}} {{usually in a}} frosted <b>Burgundy</b> style <b>bottle</b> with a label bearing a Rembrandt style portrait of an 18th-century Spanish nobleman. The Gran Reserva bottles also are wrapped with a thin, twisted-gold-wire mesh.|$|R
60|$|These {{abstract}} {{questions are}} inseparably interwoven with my {{memory of a}} shining long white table, and our hock <b>bottles</b> and <b>burgundy</b> <b>bottles,</b> and bottles of Perrier and St. Galmier and the disturbed central trophy of dessert, and scattered glasses and nut-shells and cigarette-ends and menu-cards used for memoranda. I see old Dayton sitting back and cocking his eye to the ceiling {{in a way he}} had while he threw warmth into the ancient platitudes of Liberalism, and Minns leaning forward, and a little like a cockatoo with a taste for confidences, telling us in a hushed voice of his faith in the Destiny of Mankind. Thorns lounges, rolling his round face and round eyes from speaker to speaker and sounding the visible depths of misery whenever Neal begins. Gerbault and Gane were given to conversation in undertones, and Bailey pursued mysterious purposes in lisping whispers. It was Crupp attracted me most. He had, as people say, his eye on me from the beginning. He used to speak at me, and drifted into a custom of coming home with me very regularly for an after-talk.|$|R
50|$|Although the hymnal is {{basically}} common to both variants of Norwegian, {{there are two}} different editions, with covers in <b>burgundy</b> (Bokmål) and <b>bottle</b> green (Nynorsk), in which the introductory texts are in the different language variants.|$|R
40|$|In situ {{absorbance}} {{of visible}} light by white wine in bottles was determined with a modified spectrophotometer. A linear correlation was obtained between absorbance at 420 nm A₄₂₀ measured in a cuvette (10 mm pathlength) and absorbance {{of that same}} wine measured in a 750 mL Flint bottle (colourless transparent glass). In addition, 5 types of coloured bottles, Emerald Green, Classic Green, French Green, Georgia Green and Cobalt Blue, also yielded strong correlations. A₄₂₀ of white wine in bottles of Antique Green or Amber glass could not be measured directly due to a strong absorbance of that wavelength by the glass. However, a strong correlation was established between measurement of A₄₂₀ (cuvette) and A₅₄₀ for white wine in Antique Green bottles and between A₄₂₀ (cuvette) and either A₅₄₀ or A₆₀₀ for white wine in Amber bottles. The method employed a standard UV-Visible spectrophotometer with an inexpensive modified sample port, and proved applicable to bottles with diameters ranging from 62 mm (375 mL capacity half bottles) up to 81 mm (750 mL capacity <b>Burgundy</b> <b>bottles).</b> In situ absorbance measurements plus subsequent chemical analysis and sensory assessment of a Chardonnay wine in Antique Green bottles showed that the method provided an estimate of oxidation in this white wine. Wine absorbance spectra over the full visible range were obtained in the Flint bottle. Measurements of the absorbance of visible light by the glass of empty bottles could also be obtained and used {{as a form of}} quality control for glass bottle manufacture. George K.
