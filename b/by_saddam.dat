5|$|Saddam Hussein {{claimed that}} Aflaq had {{converted}} to Islam {{prior to his}} death – according to nameless Western diplomats. This claim was later disputed by nameless members of Aflaq's own family - although Aflaq's son Iyad confirmed that his father thought about conversion already in 1980. Upon his disputed conversion {{he had taken the}} first name of Ahmad. According to the German orientalists Martin Robbe and Gerhard Höpp the conversion happened before 1988. Even so, Aflaq was given an Islamic funeral. For the Berkley Center, Aflaq's disputed conversion is considered by anonymous members of his family as a tool used <b>by</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein to disassociate Ba'athism from Christianity. The tomb constructed on the orders of Hussein was later used by American soldiers after the 2003 American invasion of Iraq as a military barracks for troops stationed within the Green Zone.|$|E

25|$|The Shias openly revolted against Saddam {{following}} the Gulf War in 1991 and were encouraged <b>by</b> <b>Saddam's</b> defeat in Kuwait and by simultaneous Kurdish uprising in the north. However, Shia {{opposition to the}} government was brutally suppressed, resulting in some 50,000 to 100,000 casualties and successive repression <b>by</b> <b>Saddam's</b> forces. The governing regimes of Iraq were composed mainly of Sunnis {{for nearly a century}} until the 2003 Iraq War.|$|R

50|$|Iraq: Saddam Hussein (de facto 1979-2003) {{designated}} his elder son Uday Hussein {{to succeed}} him as dictator, then changed the succession to his younger son Qusay Hussein after Uday suffered a severe injury in 1996. The U.S. invasion of Iraq {{and the death of}} both his sons, followed <b>by</b> <b>Saddam's</b> trial and subsequent execution made succession a moot point.|$|R
25|$|The area {{underwent}} chaos {{again in}} 1991 following the Persian Gulf War. Encouraged <b>by</b> <b>Saddam's</b> defeat in Kuwait, the Shi'as and the Kurds openly revolted against the Ba'athist regime.

Unlike the failed Shi'a rebellion in the south, the Kurdish uprising {{eventually led to the}} establishment of the Kurdish Autonomous Region.|$|R
25|$|The Iraq War {{began in}} March 2003 as an {{invasion}} of Ba'athist Iraq by a force led by the United States. The Ba'athist government led <b>by</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein was toppled within a month.

During this insurgency, the United States was in the role of an occupying power.|$|E
25|$|Water buffalo {{are also}} present in the {{southern}} region of Iraq in the Mesopotamian Marshes. The draining of the Mesopotamian Marshes <b>by</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein {{was an attempt to}} punish the south for the 1991 uprisings in Iraq. After 2003 and the Firdos Square statue destruction, these lands were reflooded and a 2007 report on Maysan and Dhi Qar shows a steady {{increase in the number of}} water buffalo. The report puts the number at 40,008 head in those two provinces.|$|E
25|$|After the {{oil crisis}} of 1973, France had {{changed to a}} more pro-Arab policy and was {{accordingly}} rewarded <b>by</b> <b>Saddam</b> with closer ties. He made a state visit to France in 1975, cementing close ties with some French business and ruling political circles. In 1975 Saddam negotiated an accord with Iran that contained Iraqi concessions on border disputes. In return, Iran agreed to stop supporting opposition Kurds in Iraq. Saddam led Arab opposition to the Camp David Accords between Egypt and Israel (1979).|$|E

Saddam told her he had assured Mubarak that he would try to settle the dispute, she said. Her cable backs up this version of events; the Iraqi transcript, prepared <b>by</b> <b>Saddam's</b> official English language translator, Sadoun al-Zubaydi, records Saddam saying that Mubarak called before he met with Glaspie.|$|R
25|$|On 18 December 2014, a {{video was}} {{released}} by TTP on their website showing a man named Umar Mansoor revealing {{that he was the}} mastermind behind the Peshawar School attack.

On 26 December 2014 at midnight, Jan was hunted and killed by the special forces in Khyber Agency in a secret hideout alongside six unidentified high-value targets.|$|E
25|$|Two {{days prior}} to the execution, a letter written <b>by</b> <b>Saddam</b> {{appeared}} on the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party website. In the letter, he urged the Iraqi people to unite, and not to hate the people of countries that invaded Iraq, like the United States, but instead the decision-makers. He said {{he was ready to}} die as a martyr and he said that this is his death sentence. In the hours before the execution, Saddam ate his last meal of chicken and rice with a cup of hot water and honey.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, {{following}} the Gulf War, Iraqi–Kuwaiti relations suffered bitterly and consequently Kuwaiti–Iranian relations began to greatly improve and flourish. Bilateral relations were gradually strengthened, partly because Iran and Kuwait were both invaded <b>by</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein and with exchanges of Iranian and Kuwaiti {{political and economic}} delegations leading to the signing of several economic and trade agreements. In February 2006, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad visited Kuwait opening {{a new chapter in}} relations between the two countries. The well reported visit was the first to Kuwait by a high-ranking Iranian official in 27 years.|$|E
50|$|The main two {{participants}} in the violence were the Arab Sunni and Arab Shia factions, but conflicts within a single group also occurred. The Kurds were caught between the two religious groups, but as they were an ethnicity {{as opposed to a}} religious movement, they were often at odds with the Arabs that were settled in Iraqi Kurdistan <b>by</b> <b>Saddam's</b> Arabization policy. Blurring this cohesion, though, were division of social, economic, political and geographic identities.|$|R
25|$|Oil {{reserves}} {{were discovered}} in 1938. From 1946 to 1982, the country underwent large-scale modernization.

In 1990, Kuwait was invaded, and later annexed, <b>by</b> <b>Saddam’s</b> Iraq. The Iraqi occupation {{came to an end}} in 1991 after military intervention by coalition forces. At the end of the war, there were extensive efforts to revive the economy and rebuild national infrastructure.|$|R
50|$|The {{government}} also {{made use of}} stricter punishments for crimes, most notably in the increased usage of amputation as a punishment, which was used for crimes such as desertion and certain forms of corruption and thievery. In {{the last two years}} of Saddam's rule, a campaign of beheadings was carried out <b>by</b> <b>Saddam's</b> Presidential paramilitary force, the Fedayeen Saddam.This campaign targeted women accused of prostitution, and according to contemporary reports by human rights groups killed more than 200 people.|$|R
25|$|Since the {{autonomy}} agreement collapsed in 1974, Kurds {{had been fighting}} an armed insurgency against Saddam's regime. After the Gulf War heavily damaged the Iraqi military and an uprising began in Southern Iraq, Jash (Kurdish militia used <b>by</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein's regime to fight Peshmerga) deserters, seized control {{of the city of}} Raniya with support of the local population. Many of the militia took sides with the Peshmerga. The revolutionary feeling spread to the rest of Kurdistan, where people took to the streets and Peshmerga entered the cities and seized control of Raniya, Chawar Qurna, Koi-Sanjaq, Sulaymaniya, Halabja, Arbat, Arbil, Duhuk, Zahku and Kirkuk.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the devastation}} of the campaigns of the Iraqi army under Saddam Hussein and other former Iraqi regimes, the Kurdistan Region's {{infrastructure}} {{was never able to}} modernize. After the 1991 safe haven was established, the Kurdistan Regional Government began projects to reconstruct the Kurdistan Region. Since then, of all the 4,500 villages that were destroyed <b>by</b> <b>Saddam</b> Husseins' regime, 65% have been reconstructed by the KRG. Furthermore, since the removal of the previous regime in 2003, the KRG has been able to scale up its service delivery and infrastructure, which has changed the economic landscape of the region and facilitated a number of investment projects.|$|E
25|$|During the 1970s, Baghdad {{experienced}} {{a period of}} prosperity and growth because of {{a sharp increase in}} the price of petroleum, Iraq's main export. New infrastructure including modern sewerage, water, and highway facilities were built during this period. The masterplans of the city (1967, 1973) were delivered by the Polish planning office Miastoprojekt-Kraków, mediated by Polservice. However, the Iran–Iraq War of the 1980s was a difficult time for the city, as money was diverted <b>by</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein to the army and thousands of residents were killed. Iran launched a number of missile attacks against Baghdad in retaliation for Saddam Hussein's continuous bombardments of Tehran's residential districts.|$|E
