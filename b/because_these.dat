5|$|After the {{expulsion}} of the Jesuit order from Spanish territories in 1767, most Jesuit reductions in South America were abandoned and fell into ruins.

5|$|In {{a general}} sense, the {{principal}} chemical reaction in bioluminescence involves some light-emitting molecule and an enzyme, generally called the luciferin and the luciferase, respectively. <b>Because</b> <b>these</b> are generic names, the luciferins and luciferases are often distinguished by including the species or group, i.e. Firefly luciferin. In all characterized cases, the enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of the luciferin.|$|E

Only 4 per cent considered using renewable sources as negative since they can be unreliable and expensive.|$|E

5|$|The Chinese {{had been}} a part of Hawaii's culture since the late 18th century, when the islands were first visited by Chinese merchants and tradesmen.

5|$|The Sun's {{distance}} from Earth is about 400 times the Moon's distance, and the Sun's diameter is about 400 times the Moon's diameter. <b>Because</b> <b>these</b> ratios are approximately the same, the Sun and the Moon {{as seen from}} Earth appear to be approximately the same size: about 0.5 degree of arc in angular measure.|$|E

5|$|The first {{complete}} specimen {{was announced}} in 1861, and ten more Archaeopteryx fossils have been found since then. Most of the eleven known fossils include impressions of feathers—among the oldest direct evidence of such structures. Moreover, <b>because</b> <b>these</b> feathers take the advanced form of flight feathers, Archaeopteryx fossils are evidence that feathers began to evolve before the Late Jurassic.|$|E

The D category is required by the law for the members of the municipal police (members of the state police do not need license for on duty firearms) and does not itself permit private gun ownership (unless the person obtains also other license category).|$|E

5|$|Also in October 2012, Jamie McIntosh of IJM Canada {{said that}} his {{organization}} supports the NAP-CHT, and that the plan's promises to participate in international child protection would be best fulfilled by apprehending and prosecuting Canadians who engage in child sex tourism and child trafficking in other countries. McIntosh recommended that this work be focused on Cambodia, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, the Philippines, and Thailand <b>because</b> <b>these</b> countries are particularly vulnerable to Canadian traffickers. He also recommended focusing on these countries because Canadians have been caught participating in child sex tourism there; McIntosh made specific reference to the cases of Kenneth Klassen and Donald Bakker.|$|E
5|$|Although gallium has {{no natural}} {{function}} in biology, gallium ions interact with {{processes in the}} body {{in a manner similar}} to iron(III). <b>Because</b> <b>these</b> processes include inflammation, a marker for many disease states, several gallium salts are used (or are in development) as pharmaceuticals and radiopharmaceuticals in medicine. When gallium ions are mistakenly taken up in place of iron(III) by bacteria such as Pseudomonas, the ions interfere with respiration, and the bacteria die. This happens because iron is redox-active, allowing the transfer of electrons during respiration, while gallium is redox-inactive.|$|E
5|$|Archaeoastronomy uses {{a variety}} of methods to uncover {{evidence}} of past practices including archaeology, anthropology, astronomy, statistics and probability, and history. <b>Because</b> <b>these</b> methods are diverse and use data from such different sources, integrating them into a coherent argument has been a long-term difficulty for archaeoastronomers. Archaeoastronomy fills complementary niches in landscape archaeology and cognitive archaeology. Material evidence and its connection to the sky can reveal how a wider landscape can be integrated into beliefs about the cycles of nature, such as Mayan astronomy and its relationship with agriculture. Other examples which have brought together ideas of cognition and landscape include studies of the cosmic order embedded in the roads of settlements.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the {{planetary}} formation epoch the inner Solar System was populated by 50–100 Moon- to Mars-sized planetary embryos. Further growth was possible only <b>because</b> <b>these</b> bodies collided and merged, which took less than 100million years. These objects would have gravitationally interacted with one another, tugging at each other's orbits until they collided, growing larger until the four terrestrial planets we know today took shape. One such giant collision is thought to have formed the Moon (see Moons below), while another removed the outer envelope of the young Mercury.|$|E
5|$|<b>Because</b> <b>these</b> three surface {{energies}} {{form the}} sides of a triangle, they are constrained by the triangle inequalities, γij < γjk + γik meaning that no one of the surface tensions can exceed {{the sum of the}} other two. If three fluids with surface energies that do not follow these inequalities are brought into contact, no equilibrium configuration consistent with Figure 3 will exist.|$|E
5|$|Brazilian flex {{cars are}} capable of running on just {{hydrated}} ethanol (E100), or just on a blend of gasoline with 20 to 25%anhydrous ethanol, or on any arbitrary combination of both fuels. Pure gasoline is no longer sold in the country <b>because</b> <b>these</b> high ethanol blends are mandatory since 1993. Therefore, all Brazilian automakers have optimized flex vehicles to run with gasoline blends from E20 to E25, so these FFVs are unable to run smoothly with pure gasoline {{with the exception of}} two models are specifically built with a flex-fuel engine optimized to operate also with pure gasoline (E0), the Renault Clio Hi-Flex and the Fiat Siena Tetrafuel.|$|E

5|$|Connected {{protected}} areas {{are important for}} the conservation of slow lorises <b>because</b> <b>these</b> primates are not adapted to travel long distances on the ground. Training for enforcement officials helps improve identification and the awareness of their legal protection. Sanctuaries and rescue facilities are available to provide both temporary and lifelong care for confiscated slow lorises. Zoo populations of some species have not bred much and have grown too old to reproduce, although the pygmy slow loris is doing well at some facilities, such as the San Diego Zoo.|$|E
5|$|During construction, {{the need}} for new water and {{electrical}} supply lines arose. <b>Because</b> <b>these</b> were not factored into the original $65million cost, another $5million was appropriated from existing capital funds. Another $5million was later required to pay for cleaning contaminated soil, increased sub-contractor pricing, additional labor costs incurred by delays caused by snow and ice, and upgrades including the guitar-shaped scoreboard. The Sounds ownership team contributed $2million toward the cost of the scoreboard. These and other additional expenditures, such as a $9.5million greenway, $5.6million for street paving, sidewalks, and electrical work, and $3.6million in flood prevention, brought the total construction cost of the stadium to $56million and the total cost of the project to $91million.|$|E
5|$|Following their {{respective}} breeding seasons, {{several species of}} hummingbirds occur at the same locations in North America, and several hummingbird flowers bloom simultaneously in these habitats. These flowers have converged to a common morphology and color <b>because</b> <b>these</b> are effective at attracting the birds. Different lengths and curvatures of the corolla tubes can affect the efficiency of extraction in hummingbird species in relation to differences in bill morphology. Tubular flowers force a bird to orient its bill {{in a particular way}} when probing the flower, especially when the bill and corolla are both curved. This allows the plant to place pollen on a certain part of the bird's body, permitting a variety of morphological co-adaptations.|$|E
