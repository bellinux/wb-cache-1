5|$|As a captain, Jardine {{inspired}} great loyalty in his players, even if {{they did}} not approve of his tactics. Christopher Douglas judges that Jardine did very well to keep the team united and loyal on the Bodyline tour.

He became close to Herbert Sutcliffe during the Bodyline tour, even though Sutcliffe was sceptical about Jardine on the previous Australian tour in 1928–29. Hedley Verity was impressed by Jardine's tactical understanding and named his younger son Douglas after the captain. Bill Bowes expressed approval of his leadership after initial misgivings, and went on to call him England's greatest captain. Nevertheless, some players such as Arthur Mitchell who played under Jardine <b>believed</b> <b>he</b> was intolerant and unsupportive of players of lesser talent, expecting everyone to perform at world-class standards.|$|E
