5|$|Kapoor {{practices}} vegetarianism, and {{credits the}} author Brian Hines' book Life is Fair for influencing this lifestyle choice. He also supports charitable organisations for various causes. In 2010, he {{took part in}} a charity event named Superstars Ka Jalwa, which helped generate money for the employees of the Cine and Television Artists Association (CINTAA). Also that year, he lent his support to the NGO Swayamsiddh, which helps children with special needs. The following year, he adopted three villages in support of NDTV's Greenathon, an initiative to support environmental consciousness and improve electricity supplies to rural areas. In 2012, Kapoor helped revive the Victory Arts Foundation NGO, founded by Shiamak Davar, which helps underprivileged children through dance therapy programs. Also that year, he appeared alongside other Bollywood celebrities in <b>Because</b> <b>My</b> World Is Not The Same, a short film by Zoya Akhtar, to generate awareness on breast cancer. He supports the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals organisation through advertisement campaigns.|$|E

I wanted to participate in gathering whatever information I could in the time I had, and I wanted to bring it all together, really to see what would happen. I needed time to work by myself.|$|E
25|$|But {{after seven}} months I {{dropped out of}} Dune, by then Rudy Wurlitzer {{had come up with}} a first-draft script which I felt was a decent {{distillation}} of Frank Herbert's. But I also realised Dune was {{going to take a lot}} more work—at least two and a half years' worth. And I didn't have the heart to attack that <b>because</b> <b>my</b> older brother Frank unexpectedly died of cancer while I was prepping the De Laurentiis picture. Frankly, that freaked me out. So I went to Dino and told him the Dune script was his.|$|E
25|$|ASL makes {{heavy use}} of time-sequenced {{ordering}}, meaning that events are signed {{in the order}} in which they occur. For example, for I was late to class last night <b>because</b> <b>my</b> boss handed me a huge stack of work after lunch yesterday, one would sign 'yesterday lunch finish, boss give-me work big-stack, night class late-me'. In stories, however, ordering is malleable, since one can choose to sequence the events either in {{the order in which}} they occurred or in the order in which one found out about them.|$|E

500|$|He prefers {{shooting}} on film to digital video, and opposes {{the use of}} digital intermediates and digital cinematography, which he feels are less reliable and offer inferior image quality to film. In particular, the director advocates {{for the use of}} higher-quality, larger-format film stock such as anamorphic 35mm, VistaVision, 65mm and IMAX. Nolan uses multi-camera for stunts and single-camera for all the dramatic action, from which he will then watch dailies every night; [...] "Shooting single-camera means I've already seen every frame as it's gone through the gate <b>because</b> <b>my</b> attention isn't divided to multi-cameras." ...|$|E
30|$|The overall {{level of}} disincentives is not a focus of this paper or Adam and Browne’s.

5000|$|He {{was one of}} {{the leading}} writers in the Arab world, {{publishing}} in the major newspapers and journals of Beirut, Cairo, and Baghdad. Describing his life in a collection of his poems, he wrote, [...] "In my childhood I was thought of as eccentric <b>because</b> of <b>my</b> unusual gestures; in my youth, as feckless <b>because</b> of <b>my</b> ebullient nature, lack of seriousness, and excessive playfulness; in my middle age as courageous for my resistance to tyranny; and in my old age as an apostate <b>because</b> I propounded <b>my</b> philosophical views". In the 1930s, because of his political views, he was marginalized by the political establishment.|$|R

Production of the song was completed by Dr. Luke, Max Martin, Benny Blanco and Kool Kojak.

500|$|Lutz Tavern, {{established}} in 1947, {{is located at}} 4639 Southeast Woodstock Boulevard in Portland's Woodstock neighborhood. The Lutz family owned the bar until 1954, when it was purchased by the Barisich family. Lilias Barisich, who shared ownership with her brothers after their parents handed it over to them, said of the bar and her mother's operating style: [...] "It's always been a homey place <b>because</b> <b>my</b> mom would kick people out if they acted different. She'd tell them they wouldn't act that way if they were invited to our home for dinner, {{so there was no}} call to act like that at the Lutz." ...|$|E

In a 1998 interview she mentioned that real persons can be recognized in some of her characters, including one in The Land of Green Plums: [...] "That [...] was already the case in my previous book [...] <b>Because</b> <b>my</b> best girlfriend died young, and because she had betrayed me, and because I had to despise her and could not stop loving her." ...|$|E

500|$|I wanted {{somebody}} with a tremendous {{understanding of how to}} make a pop video, <b>because</b> <b>my</b> biggest challenge working with directors is that I am the director and I write the treatments and I get the fashion and I decide what it's about and it's very hard to find directors that will relinquish any sort of input from the artist. ...

Egan said that her mother [...] "told me he was a great character, but an evil one, so I was really excited. And now knowing Michael, it has been so much fun." [...] She said that [...] "everyone seems to think we have good on-screen chemistry" [...] and that [...] "it's an interesting energy between Chelsea and Adam being the [...] "bad guys" [...] in town."

[...] During what she described as an [...] "aggressive" [...] pat-down search, security screening personnel forced her to remove and show her prosthetic breast.
