5|$|A {{new church}} was needed <b>because</b> <b>the</b> old church needed {{significant}} repair and also <b>because</b> <b>the</b> growth of Brynsiencyn meant {{that more people}} lived there than in Llanidan itself. Like its predecessor, it is dedicated to Nidan, a 7th-century Welsh saint who was the confessor of the monastery at Penmon, on the eastern tip of Anglesey.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{the company}} sells beer at the Whopper Bar locations, {{including}} Budweiser, Bud Light, and Miller Lite in aluminum bottles designed to maintain temperature. The move, designed {{to target the}} important 30-and-under demographic, has been called risky by industry analysts <b>because</b> <b>the</b> company {{is known as a}} fast food purveyor and not as an alcoholic beverages seller. Other industry consultants have disagreed with the assessment, believing that the move is timely <b>because</b> <b>the</b> company is growing with its aging customer base.|$|E

5|$|<b>Because</b> <b>the</b> cats were {{registered}} as Abyssinians in the import certificates, and <b>because</b> <b>the</b> Meadows had been breeders of Abyssinian, Burmese, and Siamese, some {{have speculated that}} the Singapura is a Burmese/Abyssinian cross and it has even been described as such by CFA Judges. The resemblance of some Burmese/Abyssinian cross to the Singapura, {{as well as the}} Singapura's small litter size, which is uncommon in natural breeds, added more doubts to the Meadows' story.|$|E
5|$|Despite its drawbacks, {{there are}} several {{advantages}} to using the fair catch kick. <b>Because</b> <b>the</b> defense is required to be ten yards beyond the spot of the kick, the kicker can take a running start before kicking {{as opposed to the}} typical two steps taken on regular field goal attempts. Similarly, the kicker does {{not have to worry about}} a low snap <b>because</b> <b>the</b> ball is not snapped. The defense is not able to block the kick, allowing the kicker to give the ball a lower trajectory than usual. The fair catch kick would also be of a shorter distance than a normal field goal attempt from the same spot, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> fair catch kick is taken from the spot of the catch, while a typical field goal is taken seven yards back from the line of scrimmage.|$|E

5|$|Interestingly, the funerary {{complex of}} the layer pyramid shows {{no trace of}} an {{enclosure}} wall, which is present in both earlier and later pyramid complexes. This could be <b>because</b> <b>the</b> stones constituting the wall were robbed over time, or simply <b>because</b> <b>the</b> wall was never started, being usually the last element of the pyramid complex to be built.|$|E
5|$|Minnie Island State Park offers {{opportunities}} for picnicking and fishing to visitors who reach it by boat. Though the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection lists boating as an activity, which is redundant <b>because</b> <b>the</b> island is accessible by boat. The Oh Ranger website advises visitors {{of the tiny}} island to use a kayak to access the island <b>because</b> <b>the</b> island is heavily wooded {{and it is difficult}} to find a spot to dock.|$|E

Marino and others added concerns that, although game developers had condoned machinima, a controversial film could prompt them to control machinima content by enforcing their copyrights.|$|E
