2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1931, Douglas {{continued}} his studies in sociology at the University of Chicago. He never did complete his PhD thesis, but was deeply disturbed by his field work in the Depression-era [...] "jungles" [...] or hobo camps where about 75,000 transients sheltered in lean-tos venturing out by day to beg or to steal. Douglas interviewed men who once belonged to the American middle class—despondent bank clerks, lawyers and doctors. Douglas said later: [...] "There were little soup kitchens run by the Salvation Army and the churches... In the first half-hour they'd be cleaned out. After that there was nothing... It was impossible to describe the hopelessness." [...] Douglas was equally disturbed {{that members of the}} Socialist Party sat around quoting Marx and Lenin, waiting for a revolution while refusing to help the destitute. Douglas said: [...] "That experience soured me with absolutists...

50|$|Parents Fest All the {{students}} in the school belong to a very humble background and majority of them are the first time learners, parents are not aware of the talent and the kind of learning happening in school. So, the Parents Fest is conducted to showcase the talent of their children. Apart from {{the students}}, alumni group also participate and share their stories to boost the confidence and give a hope to the parents about the future of their children, so that the parents can go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the importance of education.|$|E

The first album, I had written six years, while {{there were only two}} years that passed. And what had I lived apart from a tour, a controversy and having banged three groupies? I do caricature, but there was nothing to tell an interesting story. I wrote Le chant des sirènes by mixing reality and fiction, a little to rid myself of all that. In the end it helped me.

A Red Hat representative stated, [...] "I {{want to talk to}} the folks at Microsoft about our two operating systems and how we can work together to solve real customer problems without attaching any unrelated strings, such as intellectual property." [...] However, Microsoft refused. A Microsoft spokesperson stated, [...] "You can't just sit <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> interoperability for interoperability's sake without fully solving the customer issue. Unless you actually address the issues around IP, you haven't fully solved the customer's interoperability problem." ...|$|E

40|$|At {{the end of}} the {{previous}} lecture we were talking about how to incorporate implicit relevance feedback which {{came in the form of}} preferences, i. e. instead of absolute judgments (this document is relevant and that document is not) we had information from clickthrough data in the form of relative judgments (this document is more relevant than that document). We ended up with some sort of vector space model. We considered “items ” in a vector space, the “items ” were little odd: query-and-document vectors rather than document vectors. So we were back to the vector space model, maybe a bit different than the one we were used to, but given that, this is a good time to go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the term-document matrix. Let’s consider more generalized features than just term counts. We will allow more general attributes and in fact our features can be negative. For example, we can have a feature that represents the number of words in the document relative to the average document length. We can also have some features like the number of English terms minus the number of Finnish terms. We are back to a vector space representation. We are going to refer to the entries in the document vectors as “terms ” for convenience, but we will actually mean more general attributes or features. 2 The Term-Document Matrix The entire corpus can be represented as a term-document matrix D. D consists of document vectors ⃗ di. The document vectors are the columns of this matrix. Document vector ⃗ di contains m generalized term...|$|E

So the fact he's gone behind her <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> her problems with other people makes her absolutely furious." [...] Alicia was hurt that Andy had taken her confidential worries to someone else. Anderson hoped the couple {{would be able to}} work out their issues and get their relationship back on track. Alicia later became involved in the show's saviour sibling storyline, which saw Andy agree to have another baby with Debbie Dingle (Charley Webb) in a bid to save his sick daughter Sarah Sugden Jr. (Sophia Amber Moore). Alicia tried to be supportive, but her feelings surrounding her own infertility made it hard for her to deal with her boyfriend having a baby with someone else. Anderson stated that Alicia was aware of ill Sarah was, but there was a point at which she would have to [...] "a huge decision" [...] about her relationship with Andy.|$|R
50|$|The 11th {{broadcast}} {{was released}} on August 8, 2008 and ran for 41 minutes. Since the previous two broadcasts had guests on the show, not much time was left to answer questions asked by listeners, so the 11th broadcast was a listener submission special. The 12th broadcast, released on September 19, 2008, ran for 59:20 and was recorded in a bar instead of the normal studio. The 13th broadcast {{was released on}} October 15, 2008 and ran for 53:51 minutes. The 13th broadcast focused mainly on information pertaining to Key's then-upcoming visual novel Rewrite, and featured Yūto Tonokawa, a scenario writer for Rewrite, as a guest on the show. The 14th broadcast was released on November 21, 2008 and ran for about 53:06 minutes. The 14th broadcast focused on the impending one-year anniversary of Key Net Radio in December 2008, and answered questions selected out of a lot. The 15th broadcast was released on December 24, 2008 and was released in two parts, the first at 69:04, and the second at 43:21 minutes. The first part focused on looking <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the previous broadcasts, {{and the second part}} regarded the goods Key sold at Comiket 75 held in late December 2008.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the demise}} of Deep Purple, Coverdale {{embarked}} on a solo career. He released his first album in February 1977, titled White Snake. All songs were written by Coverdale and guitarist Micky Moody. As his first solo effort, Coverdale later admitted: [...] "It's very difficult to think <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> sensibly <b>about</b> the first album. White Snake had been a very inward looking, reflective and low-key affair in many ways, written and recorded {{as it was in}} the aftermath of the collapse of Deep Purple." [...] Even though the album was not successful, its title inspired the name of Coverdale's future band.|$|R

40|$|In {{last night}} 2 ̆ 7 s State of the Union message, President Clinton {{challenged}} the United States to sustain our {{role as the}} leader {{in the fight for}} freedom and peace. Three years of American leadership by President Clinton have already produced great benefits for the American people and for the world community. Through determination and the exercise of American leadership, we have repeatedly turned challenges into real gains for Americans. In the Office of Policy Planning, we often are torn between helping to coordinate day-to-day policy and longer-term planning. In our fast-forward world, long-term sometimes means next Monday, and history is what happened last Friday. That said, {{as the director of the}} office responsible for helping frame policy in a larger context, I would like to take a step <b>back</b> tonight, <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the broader principles and strategies that lie behind the President 2 ̆ 7 s remarkable foreign policy accomplishments...|$|R
2500|$|Similar to the Book of Zambasta, the Jatakastava {{chronicles the}} Buddha’s {{previous}} lives as {{both human and}} animal. [...] While reliving these past lives, Siddhartha Gautama looks <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>talks</b> to himself <b>about</b> the lessons and the characteristics he had to learn prior to becoming the Buddha. [...] The concise nature of Khotanese texts could especially be seen here, as multiple tales are quickly told within only 26 pages. The origins of the Jatakastava caused some debate {{within the field of}} Buddhist studies. [...] While some scholars argue that the Jatakastava was written and first published in the Kingdom of Khotan, recent evidence suggests that the Jatakastava is not an original text from Khotan, but rather a translation of an older text, presumably one written in Sanskrit. [...] Regardless, since the Jatakastava written in its original language has been lost, the Khotanese translation is the oldest surviving manuscript.|$|R

Let me try to pull the camera <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> more generally <b>about</b> what these cases that we 2 ̆ 7 re <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> today have in common. To do that, I want to comment on what we might think of as the canon and the anti-canon of Supreme Court cases. Here I build upon thoughtful work by, among others, Professor Richard Primus. In so doing, in <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> canon <b>and</b> anticanon, I would like to preview my new book that 2 ̆ 7 s coming out, America 2 ̆ 7 s Unwritten Constitution, because I 2 ̆ 7 m going to be building on some of these ideas. It is a complement to the last thing that I did, America 2 ̆ 7 s Constitution: A Biography, that tries to take the reader through the written document, the canonical text. The Constitution is very compact. I try to take the reader really from start to finish: from the Preamble through every article, and then through every amendment. The thought of the new book is that the Constitution is not all that we believe it to be. It proclaims itself the supreme law of the land, and yet all of us understand that there is more to it than that. There is also a canon and an anti-canon of decisions...|$|R
5000|$|On October 23, 2007, Kerr gave {{a memorable}} {{speech at the}} annual [...] "GEOINT" [...] conference on Geospatial Intelligence (to an {{audience}} including many people from his prior NRO job). He said,"We really need to realize what a loaded word security really is. When I’m at work, and throughout my day, security is safety, as a barrier against physical or emotional harm. When I go home at night, security is privacy, as an expectation of freedom from unnecessary burdens. In the intelligence community, {{we have an obligation}} to protect both safety and privacy, and over the course of GEOINT 2007, as we <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the hows of new technologies and tradecraft, I’d like to take a step <b>back</b> right now <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the whys."Safety <b>and</b> privacy - it's common thinking that, in order to have more safety, you get less privacy. I don’t agree with that. I work from the assumption that you need to have both. When we try to make it an either/or proposition, we’re bound to fail."Later in the speech, he said,"Too often, privacy has been equated with anonymity; and it's an idea that is deeply rooted in American culture. The Lone Ranger wore a mask but Tonto didn’t seem to need one even though he did the dirty work for free. You’d think he would probably need one even more. But in our interconnected and wireless world, anonymity - or the appearance of anonymity - is quickly becoming a thing of the past."Anonymity results from a lack of identifying features. Nowadays, when so much correlated data is collected and available - <b>and</b> I’m just <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> profiles on MySpace, Facebook, YouTube here - the set of identifiable features has grown beyond where most of us can comprehend. We need to move beyond the construct that equates anonymity with privacy and focus more on how we can protect essential privacy in this interconnected environment."Protecting anonymity isn’t a fight that can be won. Not with me in my current job. Anyone that's typed in their name on Google understands that. Instead, privacy, I would offer, is a system of laws, rules, and customs with an infrastructure of Inspectors General, oversight committees, and privacy boards on which our intelligence community commitment is based and measured. And it is that framework that we need to grow and nourish and adjust as our cultures change."I think people here, at least people close to my age, recognize that those two generations younger than we are have a very different idea of what is essential privacy, what they would wish to protect about their lives and affairs. And so, it's not for us to inflict one size fits all. It's a need to have it be adjustable to the needs of local societies as they evolve in our country. Eventually, we can only hope that people's perceptions - in Hollywood and elsewhere - will catch up."These remarks produced major news coverage that said he'd said that [...] "privacy no longer can mean anonymity...Instead, it should mean that government and businesses properly safeguards sic people's private communications and financial information." ...|$|R
