25|$|Hutchinson and Cederbaum (2011) studied father-daughter {{communication}} {{and found that}} increased father-daughter communication delayed sexual debut and decreased the frequency of engagement in sexual intercourse. They also found that responsible sexual behavior among adolescent females was associated with positive father-daughter communication regarding men, dating, sex, and marriage. On the other hand, fathers who were absent had been linked to higher rates of sexual activity and teen pregnancy among female adolescents. Fathers have {{a greater impact on}} daughters than they think, but fail to recognize it because they don’t believe they should <b>be</b> <b>discussing</b> sex with their daughters or simply leave it to the mothers.|$|E
25|$|Alvarez {{has been}} known for facilitating and {{endorsing}} impeachment efforts against Vice President, Robredo and Supreme Court Chief Justice, Sereno. Alvarez's endorsed impeachment complaint against Robredo came after the Vice President reported to the United Nations the state of the country and the War on Drugs that President Duterte's administration is currently conducting. Alvarez claims that Robredo's act of portraying the country in a bad light is a betrayal of public trust, and thus impeachable. Alvarez has also revealed that the congress will <b>be</b> <b>discussing</b> possible impeachment complaint against Chief Justice Sereno for meddling {{in the case of the}} Congress' detention of Ilocos-6, wherein Sereno granted the right of habeas corpus to the six individuals.|$|E

2500|$|Reggae {{is noted}} for its {{tradition}} of social criticism in its lyrics, although many reggae songs discuss lighter, more personal subjects, such as love and socializing. Many early reggae bands covered Motown or Atlantic soul and funk songs. Some reggae lyrics attempt to raise the political consciousness of the audience, such as by criticizing materialism, or by informing the listener about controversial subjects such as Apartheid. Many reggae songs promote the use of cannabis (also known as herb, ganja, or sinsemilla), considered a sacrament in the Rastafari movement. There are many artists who utilize religious themes in their music — whether it <b>be</b> <b>discussing</b> a specific religious topic, or simply giving praise to God (Jah). Other common socio-political topics in reggae songs include black nationalism, anti-racism, anti-colonialism, anti-capitalism and criticism of political systems and [...] "Babylon".|$|E
