50|$|In most cases, biologically active {{compounds}} in Chinese medicine, Ayurveda, or herbal medicine {{have not been}} determined. Therefore, {{it is important to}} use the phytochemical methods to screen and analyze bioactive components, not only for the quality control of crude drugs, but also for the elucidation of their therapeutic mechanisms. Modern pharmacological studies indicate that binding to receptors or ion channels on cell membranes is the first step of some drug actions. A new method in phytochemistry called <b>biochromatography</b> has been developed. This method combines human red cell membrane extraction and high performance liquid chromatography to screen potential active components in Chinese medicine.|$|E

Identification of their active compounds constitutes a bottleneck in the development of TCMs. Screening and analysis of active compounds is a challenge in TCM research. This review summarizes recent progress in the development of biological fingerprinting strategies for screening and analyzing bioactive compounds in TCMs using molecular recognition, metabolism and omics tools. The evaluated strategies include the following techniques: microdialysis/centrifugal ultrafiltration-HPLC, <b>biochromatography,</b> metabolic fingerprinting analysis, 2 -dimensional <b>biochromatography</b> and omics fingerprinting analysis...|$|E
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} two-dimensional <b>biochromatography</b> method using a silica-bonded human {{serum albumin}} (HSA) column and a RP-HPLC column {{was developed for}} the biological fingerprinting analysis of bioactive components in a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) prescription, Longdan Xiegan Decoction (LXD). The <b>biochromatography</b> with HSA-immobilized stationary phase was applied to study the interaction of multiple components in LXD with HSA in the first dimension, and fractions of HSA column were further separated by a silica monolithic ODS column (on-line) /an ODS column (off-line) coupled with a diode array detector and an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometer (APCI-MS). More than 100 compounds in LXD that interacted with the immobilized HSA were separated and analyzed. Among them 19 compounds were identified based on their retention values, UV spectra, molecular weights and mass spectra. The {{results show that the}} developed comprehensive two-dimensional <b>biochromatography</b> system reported here is capable of being used for biological fingerprinting analysis of natural products in complex matrices such as extracts of TCMs and their prescriptions.

40|$|Searching for {{bioactive}} compounds {{from natural}} {{resources such as}} plant materials has become a focus for study. Several models, such as animal (biofluid, organ and tissue) and cellular (several kinds of cell lines), have traditionally been used for this purpose. As a fast, economic and effective way to identify or predict bioactive com-pounds in complex matrices, <b>biochromatography</b> has developed rapidly during the past years. Combing the properties of traditional chromatography and biomaterials, biochromatographic analysis pos-sesses features of simultaneous screening, separation and struc-tural identification for active compounds in a complex matrix. According to the process, <b>biochromatography</b> {{can be divided into}} offline and online approaches. For offline bioextraction, the bioma-terials are used as the extraction phase and followed by routine chromatographic analysis. For online <b>biochromatography,</b> the bio-materials are directly used as the stationary phase for chromato-graphic analysis. This paper reviews the applications of offline bioextraction followed by chromatographic analysis and online bio-chromatography, including molecular, cell membrane and cell, and artificial biomembrane chromatography in the screening or predict-ing active compounds from natural sources...|$|E
40|$|Screening of {{bioactive}} {{compounds in}} traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) {{is an extremely}} challenge, and it’s also the basic and crucial problem to overcome for the modernization of TCMs. A novel method has been presented to resolve this problem potentially with the proposing of biological fingerprinting analysis. Biological fingerprinting analysis of TCMs {{is defined as the}} fingerprintings and their differences of the extracts of TCMs before and after interaction with the biological system [1]. Furthermore, <b>biochromatography</b> and two-dimensional-liquid chromatography (2 D-LC) related with <b>biochromatography</b> can be regarded as a type of biological fingerprinting of TCMs [2]. The information which responding the interaction of the components from TCMs with the biological system drawing directly from the biological fingerprinting could guide the screening of the bioactive compounds. In the paper, biological fingerprintings of the aqueous extract of Flos Carthami with human serum albumin (HSA) and with various blood plasmas have been studied by the methods of microdialysis coupled with HPLC or centrifugal ultrafiltration coupled with HPLC. In addition, <b>biochromatography</b> with silica-bonded HSA as stationary phase and 2 D-LC using an immobilized HSA column and a RP-HPLC column have also been investigated. LC-MS has been used to determine the structures of the components of the extract as well. According to the results of the biological fingerprinting analysis, some compounds with high contents in the herb and moderate binding rate with HSA or plasma have been selected as our target for further study. Isolation and purification of them were conducted and the structures of them have been determined. Binding constants and binding sites of them with HSA were also studied. 大连化物...|$|E
40|$|Formalin-induced pain {{models were}} used in rats to {{evaluate}} the antinociceptive effect of the total alkaloids of Corydalis yanhusuo (TAC). The results indicated that formalin-evoked spontaneous nociceptive responses (licking behavior) could be inhibited significantly by giving (intragingival) TAC at a single dose of 150 mg/kg. Subsequently, an online comprehensive two-dimensional <b>biochromatography</b> method with a silica-bonded human serum albumin (HSA) column in the first dimension and a monolithic ODS column in the second was developed. The absorbed bioactive components were screened by comparing and contrasting the components detected in the plasma and striatum with those in TAC. More than 100 compounds were separated and detected in the TAC, among which 13 compounds were identified. About 40 compounds (seven compounds identified) were absorbed into the plasma with appropriate concentrations and about 20 compounds (four compounds identified) passed through the blood-brain barrier into the striatum. Of interest, four compounds (protopine, glaucine, tetrahydropalmatine, and corydaline) which were reported to possess profound antinociceptive effects exhibited high concentrations in the striatum. This may result from their synergistic effects in regulating the formalin-induced nociception. The {{results indicated that the}} comprehensive two-dimensional <b>biochromatography</b> method developed is capable of screening the bioactive components in Corydalis yanhusuo and providing valuable information for understanding the mechanisms by which Corydalis yanhusuo alleviates nociception...|$|E
40|$|Identification {{of active}} {{compounds}} from natural products {{is a critical}} and challenging task in drug discovery pipelines. Besides commonly used bio-guided screening approaches, affinity selection strategy coupled with liquid chromatography or mass spectrometry, known as ligand fishing, has been gaining increasing interest from researchers. In this review, we summarized this emerging strategy and categorized those methods as off-line or on-line mode according to their features. The separation principles of ligand fishing were introduced based on distinct analytical techniques, including <b>biochromatography,</b> capillary electrophoresis, ultrafiltration, equilibrium dialysis, microdialysis, and magnetic beads. The applications of ligand fishing approaches in the discovery of lead compounds were reviewed. Most of ligand fishing methods display specificity, high efficiency, and require less sample pretreatment, which makes them especially suitable for screening active compounds from complex mixtures of natural products. We also summarized the applications of ligand fishing in the modernization of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), and propose some perspectives of this remarkable technique...|$|E
40|$|Human {{serum albumin}} (HSA), the most {{abundant}} protein in plasma, is a monomeric multi-domain macromolecule, representing the main determinant of plasma oncotic pressure and the main modulator of fluid distribution between body compartments. HSA displays an extraordinary ligand binding capacity, providing a depot and carrier for many endogenous and exogenous compounds. Indeed, HSA represents the main carrier for fatty acids, affects pharmacokinetics of many drugs, provides the metabolic modification of some ligands, renders potential toxins harmless, accounts {{for most of the}} anti-oxidant capacity of human plasma, and displays (pseudo-) enzymatic properties. HSA is a valuable biomarker of many diseases, including cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, ischemia, post-menopausal obesity, severe acute graft-versus-host disease, and diseases that need monitoring of the glycemic control. Moreover, HSA is widely used clinically to treat several diseases, including hypovolemia, shock, burns, surgical blood loss, trauma, hemorrhage, cardiopulmonary bypass, acute respiratory distress syndrome, hemodialysis, acute liver failure, chronic liver disease, nutrition support, resuscitation, and hypoalbuminemia. Recently, biotechnological applications of HSA, including implantable biomaterials, surgical adhesives and sealants, <b>biochromatography,</b> ligand trapping, and fusion proteins, have been reported. Here, genetic, biochemical, biomedical, and biotechnological aspects of HSA are reviewed...|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) association mechanism withamyloid proteins {{and the effect of}} physiological parameters (pH,…) on this mechanism allowa better understanding of the mechanisms leading to amyloidogenesis. Transthyretin (TTR), which circulates in both plasma and cerebrospinal fluid, is one of theproteins involved in amyloidosis. It leads to TTR amyloidosis and plays a role in Alzheimer’sdisease in sequestrating the beta-amyloid (Aβ) protein. <b>Biochromatography</b> is an effectivetool for the {{analysis of}} the mechanism involved between a ligand and its receptor inadjustable conditions which could be close to biological conditions. Moreover, carbonnanotubes can be used to detect or to carry molecules which bind on its external surface andcould interact with other molecules. In this work, a particulate support was used where the HSPG was immobilized on the silica particles preactivated by amine residues. This support filling a column was used to study andcompare association mechanisms between HSPG and a wild type TTR form and a senile formof the TTR which was was extracted from a patient who died of cardiac failure with a senilesystemic amyloid. This study showed that the association between wild type TTR and HSPGwas independent of the pH and involved weak interactions. For the senile TTR, this association was dependent on pH. At pH 6.

40|$|This work {{proposes a}} new {{capillary}} electrochromatography (CEC) method for determination of drug partition in membrane phospholipids. CEC experiments {{were carried out}} in a 100 µm (ID) fused-silica capillary, partially packed with a chromatographic phospholipid stationary phase, so-called Immobilized Artificial Membrane, IAM. PC. DD 2. The observed retention values were corrected by both the electro-osmotic and electrophoretic mobility values, measured by capillary electrophoresis (CE) experiments, assuming {{the values of the}} logarithms of ???chromatographic??? affinity factors, log kCEC as indexes of affinity for phospholipids. Analogously to <b>biochromatography,</b> all the values were determined with a totally aqueous mobile phase, or extrapolated to 100 % aqueous buffer. The analytes were 16 structurally unrelated compounds, of basic, neutral, and acidic nature. To evaluate the effectiveness of CEC data to describe partition in phospholipids, log kCEC were related to both log P and values. Log P are the lipophilicity values expressed as the logarithms of n-octanol/water partition coefficients and are the retention data measured by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) on an IAM. PC. DD 2 column, assumed as the reference values for phospholipid affinity. Phospholipid affinity scale by CEC related to that achieved by HPLC, but only if two different subclasses were considered separately, i. e. protonated and unprotonated analytes; indeed, all the compounds protonated at the experimental pH value (7. 0) were retained stronger in CEC than in HPLC. This discrepancy {{may be due to the}} use of different buffers in CEC and HPLC since, to avoid the occurrence of a high current, the eluent in CEC experiments was of different composition and lower ionic strength than in HPLC. CEC analyses were faster and required lower amounts of both solvent and stationary phase than HPLC; moreover, with the exception of only three analytes, all analyses were performed with 100 % aqueous eluents avoiding time-consuming and tedious extrapolation procedures...|$|E
40|$|The {{simulated}} {{moving bed}} (SMB) {{technology is a}} proven tool for efficient separation of binary compound mixtures. However, the reliance on isocratic conditions limits {{the applicability of the}} classical SMB approach when considering the emerging field of bioseparations. Here the use of gradients opens up new possibilities. In its basic form a gradient in a SMB process can be established by using different solvent strengths in feed and desorbent, resulting in two plateaus of solvent strength. Typically the lower solvent strength {{can be found at the}} feed inlet. When compared to the conventional process the overall amount of solvent needed can be reduced and more concentrated product streams can be obtained. In this contribution two case studies will be presented. At first as a model system the separation of bovine IgG from lysozyme and/or bovine serumalbumin (BSA) will be analyzed. Antibodies are a common target substance in <b>biochromatography</b> as therapeutic monoclonal antibodies are among the most promising biopharmaceuticals. Using adsorption data obtained from single column experiments the design of an appropriate SMB process was possible. Gradient SMB separations were performed using ion-exchange and hydrophobic interaction matrices. With both interaction mechanisms it was possible to obtain pure fraction of IgG. The second target component is the active dimeric form of the bone morphogenetic protein- 2 (BMP- 2), which is to be separated from its inactive monomeric form as well as from other undefined contaminants [2]. BMP- 2 is one of the most interesting growth factors from the transforming-growth-factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily. Gradient SMB separation was performed using prepacked HiTrap TM Heparin HP columns. The presentation will show the dependence of the equilibrium functions of the two components studied on the ionic strength. This information provides the basis to choose suitable operating conditions for step-gradient-SMB processes using 3 or 4 zones. Experimental results obtained using a lab-scale SMB unit will be presented. [1] Keßler, L.

40|$|The stormy {{development}} of the biotechnology requires new standards with respect to chromatographic supports concerning the purification of biomolecules: good selectivity to the target protein, a sufficient mechanical stability, chemical stability, non denaturating interactions with proteins, high specific bond capacity (dynamic protein bond capacity). The author uses polymer modified epoxy gels and membranes {{for the production of}} biochromatographic materials. The polymeric coating efficiency of glycidyl methacrylate on Fractogel HW 650 (M) is varied systematically. The so obtained polymer modified gels react with diethylamine and bisulfite to anion exchange membrane and cation exchange membrane. Support materials for <b>biochromatography</b> are developed in the search for a protein bond capacity which is accessible fastly on the smallest area. Therefore, the author develops a polymerization procedure which enables the coating of gels and membranes with 2, 3 -epoxy propylmethacrylate. In comparison to support materials with conventional synthesis procedure, polymer coated support materials have two advantages: an improved mechanical stability and an advanced dynamic bond capacity on the small surface. Polymeric support materials are superior by bonded polymer chains having the function of a hydrophile spacer. Therefore, spacers with six carbon atoms in the aliphatic chain are unnecessary. The production of polymer modified support materials requires boundary conditions: (a) existence of a pore filling, ionic hydrogel structure as a precondition to realize a great equilibrium protein bond capacity; (b) the pore diffusion determines the transport mechanism in a hydrogel. The open structure of the hydrogel does not impede the diffusion of proteins with opposite electric charges. It excludes proteins with like electric charges. If polymer modified support materials are used in packed columns, the dynamic bond capacity is deteriorated by the film diffusion of the proteins in the outer polymeric shell. This effect can be reduced by an exact tuning of the coating efficiency and the use of very hydrophile reagents. The adsorption can be transferred into the outer sphere of a particle with the aid of polymeric coating procedures. In this case, the adsorption process is accelerated. But diffusion processes in particles cannot be repressed. The author has developed chemical modified membranes with great equilibrium bond capacities whose dynamic bond capacity is independ from linear flow. Today, these chemical modified membranes cannot be transferred into the industrial practice.
