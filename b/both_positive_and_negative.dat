5|$|Although pranks that {{involved}} public locations, figures, and organisations {{were always a}} feature of the series, the APEC pranks yielded unprecedented local and international publicity, <b>both</b> <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> <b>negative.</b> Some team members faced charges for breaching the APEC zone, but these were dropped because police had allowed their entry into the restricted zone. Other less controversial and less publicised stunts were also shown on The Chaser's War on Everything, with ratings peaking at almost three million Australian viewers for the APEC wrap-up episode.|$|E
5|$|At {{several points}} in the book, Bechdel {{questions}} whether her decision to come out as a lesbian {{was one of the}} triggers for her father's suicide. This question is never answered definitively, but Bechdel closely examines the connection between her father's closeted sexuality and her own open lesbianism, revealing her debt to her father in <b>both</b> <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> <b>negative</b> lights.|$|E
50|$|The {{assumption}} that the OFT is based on conflict has been heavily criticized.

5|$|The film series {{provoked}} <b>both</b> <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> <b>negative</b> {{reaction from}} fans and scholars of the novels, and was sometimes seen as changing parts Tolkien felt thematically necessary {{in terms of}} characters, themes, events and subtlety. Some fans of the book who disagreed with such changes have released fan edits of the films such as The Lord of the Rings: The Purist Edition, which removed many of the changes to bring them closer to the original.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{scientific}} themes mark the play's position {{at a major}} turning-point in Verne's ideology. In Verne's earlier works, knowledgeable heroes aim to use their skills {{to change the world}} for the better; in his later novels, by contrast, scientists and engineers often apply their knowledge toward morally reprehensible projects. The play, by exploring science in <b>both</b> <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> <b>negative</b> lights, shows Verne in transition between the two points of view.|$|E

5|$|Democracy, or {{the rule}} of the many over themselves. The rule of the masses is positive, in that it is less likely to lead to civil war than the alternatives. An {{ambivalent}} feature of democracy is the fact that representatives are forced to compromise their ideologies to stay in power, which can curb <b>both</b> <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> <b>negative</b> tendencies. On the negative side, democracies are not very good at dealing with subjects that demand expert authority or quick decisions. Moreover, a democracy is easily corruptible by politicians with agendas. Also, a democracy may easily slip into popular apathy which allows for corrupt politicians to go unchecked (Russell 1938:154–159).|$|E
5|$|Further {{work was}} {{conducted}} by Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray and C. F. du Fay. In the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research in electricity, selling his possessions to fund his work. In June 1752 he is reputed to have attached a metal key {{to the bottom of}} a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky. A succession of sparks jumping from the key {{to the back of his}} hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature. He also explained the apparently paradoxical behavior of the Leyden jar as a device for storing large amounts of electrical charge in terms of electricity consisting of <b>both</b> <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> <b>negative</b> charges.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure to}} renew the Licensing Act led to {{confusion}} and <b>both</b> <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> <b>negative</b> outcomes; while the government no longer {{played a part in}} censoring publications, and the monopoly of the Company over printing was broken, there was uncertainty {{as to whether or not}} copyright was a binding legal concept without the legislation. Economic chaos also resulted; with the Company now unable to enforce any monopoly, provincial towns began establishing printing presses, producing cheaper books than the London booksellers. The absence of the censorship provisions also opened Britain up as a market for internationally printed books, which were similarly cheaper than those British printers could produce.|$|E

5|$|A {{direct method}} for {{producing}} an MSA uses the dynamic programming technique {{to identify the}} globally optimal alignment solution. For proteins, this method usually involves two sets of parameters: a gap penalty and a substitution matrix assigning scores or probabilities to the alignment of each possible pair of amino acids based on the similarity of the amino acids' chemical properties and the evolutionary probability of the mutation. For nucleotide sequences a similar gap penalty is used, but a much simpler substitution matrix, wherein only identical matches and mismatches are considered, is typical. The scores in the substitution matrix may be either all positive or a mix {{of positive and negative}} {{in the case of a}} global alignment, but must be <b>both</b> <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> <b>negative,</b> in the case of a local alignment.|$|E
5|$|From 14 December 1942 to 28 January 1943, Devers went on an {{inspection}} {{tour of the}} battlefields in North Africa, taking with him Brigadier Generals Edward H. Brooks and Williston B. Palmer from the Armored Force, and Gladeon M. Barnes from the Ordnance Department. He spoke with key British generals including Harold Alexander, Bernard Montgomery and Richard McCreery, and American commanders including Eisenhower, Patton, Thomas B. Larkin and Orlando Ward. Eisenhower was defensive, suspicious that Marshall may have sent Devers to replace him, and nervous when Devers had critical comments about {{the handling of the}} 1st Armored Division. Devers and his party received a great deal of feedback, <b>both</b> <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> <b>negative</b> about American equipment. Devers noted that the M4 Sherman was superior to the M3 Lee that the 1st Armored Division was equipped with, but urged the development of the more powerful 76mm gun.|$|E
5|$|Over time, the {{characterisation}} of Shashthi {{underwent a}} gradual evolution. Aforementioned folk traditions originating between the 10th and 5th centuries BCE associated the goddess with <b>both</b> <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> <b>negative</b> elements of fertility, birth, motherhood and childhood. However, between the 4th century BCE and the 5th century CE, a shift occurred in which Shashthi was increasingly {{depicted as a}} malevolent deity associated with the sufferings of mothers and children. The fifth century text Kashyapa Samhita calls Shashthi by the epithet Jataharini ("one who steals the born") and provides {{a list of the}} malevolent activities in which Shashthi is believed to engage, including her practice of stealing foetuses from the womb and devouring children on the sixth day following birth. For this reason, the text recommends that she be propitiated through worship in her honour on this day in the lying-in room and on the sixth day of every fortnight thereafter.|$|E

5|$|Goebbels {{was first}} offered the {{position}} of party Gauleiter for the Berlin section in August 1926. He travelled to Berlin in mid-September and {{by the middle of}} October accepted the position. Thus Hitler's plan to divide and dissolve the northwestern Gauleiters group that Goebbels had served in under Strasser was successful. Hitler gave Goebbels great authority over the area, allowing him to determine the course for organisation and leadership for the Gau. Goebbels was given control over the local Sturmabteilung (SA) and Schutzstaffel (SS) and answered only to Hitler. The party membership numbered about 1,000 when Goebbels arrived, and he reduced it to a core of 600 of the most active and promising members. To raise money, he instituted membership fees and began charging admission to party meetings. Aware of the value of publicity (<b>both</b> <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> <b>negative),</b> he deliberately provoked beer-hall battles and street brawls, including violent attacks on the Communist Party of Germany. Goebbels adapted recent developments in commercial advertising to the political sphere, including the use of catchy slogans and subliminal cues. His new ideas for poster design included using large type, red ink, and cryptic headers that encouraged the reader to examine the fine print to determine the meaning.|$|E

Director Tobe Hooper decided to focus on its black comedy as he believed this was present in the first film, but was unacknowledged by viewers because of its gritty content. Despite the mixed reception, the film eventually gaineda cult following.|$|R
