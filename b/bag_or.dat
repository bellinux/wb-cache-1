5|$|Some Heathens {{practice}} {{forms of}} divination using runes; {{as part of}} this, items with runic markings on them might be pulled out of a <b>bag</b> <b>or</b> bundle, and read accordingly. In some cases, different runes are associated with different deities, one of the nine realms, or aspects of life. It is common for Heathens to utilize the Common Germanic Futhark as a runic alphabet, although some practitioners instead adopt the Anglo-Saxon Futhorc or the Younger Futhark. Some non-Heathens also use runes for divinatory purposes, with {{books on the subject}} being common in New Age bookstores. Some Heathens practice magic, although this is not regarded as an intrinsic part of Heathenry because it was not a common feature of pre-Christian rituals in Iron Age and Early Medieval Germanic Europe.|$|E
5|$|Not all early roguelikes were readily {{classified}} as Hack or Moria descendants. Larn (1986), developed by Noah Morgan, borrowed concepts from both Hack (in {{that there are}} persistent and fixed levels) and Moria (in {{the availability of a}} shop level and general difficulty increasing with dungeon level), but while these two games have spiraled in size to take multiple play sessions to complete, Larn was aimed to be completed in a single session. Larn also uses a fixed-time feature, in that the player had only so many turns to complete a goal, though there were ways to jump back in time as to extend play. Omega, developed by the Laurence Brothers in the late 1980s, is credited with introducing an overworld concept to the roguelike genre, prior to the feature's appearance in ADOM. Omega was often remembered for its odd inventory approach in which the player would have to pick up an object, considering it being held, and then moving that object to a <b>bag</b> <b>or</b> an equipment slot. Linley's Dungeon Crawl (1995) was created by Linley Henzell and featured a skill-based character progression system, in which experience points could be used to improve specific skills, such as weapon proficiency or trap detection. One fork of this would form the basis for Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup (2006). SSI's Dungeon Hack (1993) offered randomized dungeons and permadeath within AD 2nd Edition rules.|$|E

Bags can either be pre-filled with {{material}} and hoisted up, <b>or</b> <b>bags</b> <b>or</b> tubes are filled in place. The weight of the earthen fill locks the bag in place on the barbed wire below.

5000|$|Security <b>bags</b> <b>or</b> {{envelopes}} may be {{specially designed}} plastic <b>bags,</b> paper <b>bags,</b> <b>or</b> fabric <b>bags.</b> <b>Bags</b> <b>or</b> envelopes {{can be made}} to be tamper resistant (TR); to make it difficult for unauthorized entry. Often it is more important for them to be tamper-evident (TE); to indicate when an unauthorized entry has occurred. No one security feature can be considered as [...] "tamper proof". [...] Layers of TR and TE features, as well as the broader security systems are needed to provide better assurance of security.|$|R

25|$|The VTBI for a {{secondary}} <b>bag</b> <b>or</b> piggybag should usually be programmed for 30 to 50 milliliters {{more than is}} stated {{to be in that}} medication IV bag, to make sure that in addition to the bag being emptied, the entire medication dose is flushed through the IV tubing from the mainline bag. Because of its design, the short, secondary IV line cannot run dry.|$|E
25|$|The choux pastry paste is piped {{through a}} pastry <b>bag</b> <b>or</b> dropped {{with a pair}} of spoons into small balls and baked to form largely hollow puffs. After cooling, the baked profiteroles are {{injected}} with filling using a pastry bag and narrow piping tip, or by slicing off the top, filling them, and reassembling. For sweet profiteroles, additional glazes or decorations may then be added.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} the wine press and of {{pressing}} is nearly {{as old as the}} history of wine itself with the remains of wine presses providing some of the longest-serving evidence of organised viticulture and winemaking in the ancient world. The earliest wine press was probably the human foot or hand, crushing and squeezing grapes into a <b>bag</b> <b>or</b> container where the contents would ferment.|$|E
50|$|Filtered systems use a {{wide variety}} of {{different}} <b>bags</b> <b>or</b> filters that must be cleaned (permanent cloth <b>bags)</b> <b>or</b> replaced (disposable paper bags) on a regular basis. Filters can be made from screening, foam, paper, or cloth, and are usually proprietary designs that may not be widely available. Over time, repeated purchase of filters and bags can become significant ongoing expenses.|$|R
50|$|In {{the second}} method the spat or seed may {{be put in}} racks, <b>bags,</b> <b>or</b> cages (or they may be glued in threes to {{vertical}} ropes) which are held above the bottom. Oysters cultivated in this manner may be harvested by lifting the <b>bags</b> <b>or</b> racks {{to the surface and}} removing mature oysters, or simply retrieving the larger oysters when the enclosure is exposed at low tide. The latter method may avoid losses to some predators, but is more expensive.|$|R

25|$|As part of {{the effort}} to try to fix the problems, MIM {{installed}} some column flotation cells in the zinc concentrate and bulk concentrate sections of the plant. In those days, the air was introduced into flotation columns using air spargers, usually {{in the form of a}} <b>bag</b> <b>or</b> sheath around a pipe. The spargers were high-maintenance items, and their performance was critical to the operation of the column.|$|E
25|$|The carcass or {{body of the}} {{box that}} {{supports}} the door and cap, and may protrude substantially down below ground level. This provides security and stability to the pillar box. There is a wirework cage inside to prevent mail falling out when the door is opened, a hinged letter chute to allow mail {{to fall into the}} collecting <b>bag</b> <b>or</b> sack and a serrated hand-guard to prevent unauthorised tampering with the mail through the aperture.|$|E
25|$|A {{holdback}} line is used {{to prevent}} the lift bag and load from floating away when used for short distance lifts at the bottom. The holdback {{is attached to the}} lifting ring of the <b>bag,</b> <b>or</b> to the load, and should be attached by a strong cable to an anchor point it cannot lift. The SWL of the holdback should be at least equal to the lifting capacity of the bag. A holdback and inverter are often used together.|$|E

Distance from railway station is about two and half km.|$|E
25|$|Sewing <b>Bag</b> <b>or</b> sewing box, sewing case (kakivik in Yup'ik and Cup'ik, kakiwig in Cup'ig) {{which held}} a woman's needles, thimble, sinew thread, small knife, and whetstone. A woman's ability to sew and repair {{clothing}} {{was critical to}} her husband's success {{as well as the}} whole family's survival. A girl could only become a wife after she learned to sew. Men sewed repairs for themselves while out hunting. IÃ±upiaq and Yupâ€™ik sewing kits epitomize the economy and thoughtfulness of Eskimo ingenuity with materials.|$|E
25|$|Muffling {{the bass}} can be {{achieved}} with the same muffling techniques as the snare, but bass drums in a drum kit are more commonly muffled by adding pillows, a sleeping <b>bag</b> <b>or</b> another soft filling inside the drum, between the heads. Cutting a small hole in the resonant head can also produce a more muffled tone, and allows manipulation in internally placed muffling. The Evans EQ pad places a pad against the batterhead and, when struck, the pad moves off the head momentarily, then returns to rest against the head, thus reducing the sustain without choking the tone.|$|E
