5|$|Dynamic braking wastes <b>braking</b> <b>energy</b> by {{transforming}} it to heat. By contrast, regenerative drives recover <b>braking</b> <b>energy</b> by injecting {{this energy}} into the AC line. The capital cost of regenerative drives is, however, relatively high.|$|E
5|$|Regenerative AC drives {{have the}} {{capacity}} to recover the <b>braking</b> <b>energy</b> of a load moving faster than the designated motor speed (an overhauling load) and return it to the power system.|$|E
5|$|Another {{feature that}} {{was ahead of}} its time was the use of dynamic brakes, where some (or most) of the braking effect is created by running the {{traction}} motors in reverse as generators, and then dissipating the generated electrical power in resistors to produce heat. In this case, the heat was generated in the locomotive as opposed to the more typically roof-top open-air coolers seen on most modern locomotives. The resistors were themselves cooled by the water from the steam loop, heating it. This allowed the <b>braking</b> <b>energy</b> to be recuperated, or as it is more typically known, offered regenerative braking.|$|E

5|$|The MX3000 {{introduced}} {{a number of}} technical innovations to the metro. Regenerative brakes allow the dynamic brakes to feed the <b>braking</b> <b>energy</b> back to the power system via the third rail. The passengers also have air conditioning. The driver's cabs are more ergonomic than in the older models, and the mirrors to monitor the platforms have been replaced with cameras and screens. The trains' livery is white with gray detailing, instead of the former models' red with blue detailing. For use in areas without a third rail, such as at depots, the trains are equipped with a 110V battery. This will remove the need for shunting at the depots and cut costs.|$|E
5|$|With a VFD, the {{stopping}} {{sequence is}} just the opposite as the starting sequence. The frequency and voltage applied to the motor are ramped down at a controlled rate. When the frequency approaches zero, the motor is shut off. A small amount of braking torque is available to help decelerate the load a little faster than it would stop if the motor were simply switched off and allowed to coast. Additional braking torque {{can be obtained by}} adding a braking circuit (resistor controlled by a transistor) to dissipate the <b>braking</b> <b>energy.</b> With a four-quadrant rectifier (active front-end), the VFD is able to brake the load by applying a reverse torque and injecting the energy back to the AC line.|$|E
25|$|Supercapacitors {{can be used}} to {{supplement}} batteries in starter systems in diesel railroad locomotives with diesel-electric transmission. The capacitors capture the <b>braking</b> <b>energy</b> of a full stop and deliver the peak current for starting the diesel engine and acceleration of the train and ensures the stabilization of catenary voltage. Depending on the driving mode up to 30% energy saving is possible by recovery of <b>braking</b> <b>energy.</b> Low maintenance and environmentally friendly materials encouraged the choice of supercapacitors.|$|E

40|$|An energy {{recovery}} analysis method {{was developed for}} the F generation articulated haulers {{in the form of}} a MATLAB script. The method is based on the mapping of the peak <b>brake</b> power, <b>brake</b> <b>energy</b> and engine energy. The method was developed using adequate signals collected on haulers at customer sites and test tracks. A conceptual study was also carried out concerning the <b>brake</b> <b>energy</b> that may be stored in the Energy storage systems (ESS) and the results shows the actual amount of <b>brake</b> <b>energy</b> that can be accumulated in the ESS along with the accurate selection of the ESS for a particular work site. The developed method was implemented in a measurement system (M-LOG) and two test runs were made. Results revealed that the {{energy recovery}} analysis method was implemented successfully with minor issues.

25|$|Public {{transportation}} {{vehicles are}} not usually included in the green vehicle category, but Personal rapid transit (PRT) vehicles probably should be. All vehicles that are powered from the track {{have the advantage of}} potentially being able to use any source of electric energy, including sustainable ones, rather than requiring liquid fuels. They can also switch regenerative <b>braking</b> <b>energy</b> between vehicles and the electric grid rather than requiring energy storage on the vehicles. Also, they can potentially use the entire track area for solar collectors, not just the vehicle surface. The potential PRT energy efficiency is much higher than that which traditional automobiles can attain.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} Prius Plug-in has {{a number}} of key changes from the demonstration units that were deployed in the field for testing based on that experience and customer feedback. The production version has two key modifications from the demonstration vehicle to improve efficiency: the ability to select between EV and hybrid mode, and the ability to recharge the battery from regenerative braking. Toyota decided to include a selectable electric driving mode (EV mode), allowing drivers to conserve energy for use in those places where EV mode is more efficient, such as city driving. Production Prius PHVs may direct the regenerative <b>braking</b> <b>energy</b> to the electric-vehicle battery, rather than the regular hybrid system battery, thus providing additional range in EV mode.|$|E
25|$|Still-larger discs {{are used}} for {{railroad}} cars and some airplanes. Passenger rail cars and light rail vehicles often use disc brakes outboard of the wheels, which helps ensure a free flow of cooling air. However, on some modern passenger rail cars, such as the Amfleet II cars, inboard disc brakes are used. This reduces wear from debris, and also provides protection from rain and snow, which would make the discs slippery, and unreliable. However, there is still plenty of cooling for reliable operation. In contrast, some airplanes have the brake mounted with very little cooling and the brake gets quite hot in a stop, but this is acceptable as there is then time for cooling, and where the maximum <b>braking</b> <b>energy</b> is very predictable.|$|E

500|$|Just to the north, the Rockaway Line gains {{two extra}} non-revenue tracks {{straddling}} the two revenue tracks. The western track {{is a test}} track, installed in 2001 and called the Far Rockaway Test Track, while the eastern track is used to relay shuttle trains. The western track extends around [...] or nearly 2 miles, while the eastern track is long enough for one full-length train (...) and ends at a bumper block. The test track was installed in 2001 by New York City Transit's Maintenance of Way Department to ensure that new cars have undergone necessary acceleration and braking tests before being put into revenue service. This was because NYCT needed to recover a greater amount of <b>braking</b> <b>energy</b> and reduce power demand peaks {{with the introduction of}} AC-motored cars with the capability for regenerative braking. A kinetic energy storage system with KESS technology was installed, and as a result, the voltage regulation of the track improved. The system provides voltage support to the revenue tracks as well as reinforcing the voltage of the test track during the testing of new trains.|$|E
