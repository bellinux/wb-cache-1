5|$|In total, 56 {{severe weather}} watches were {{issued by the}} Storm Prediction Center (SPC) over those four days in the {{outbreak}} area, including 41 tornado watches (10 of which were PDS watches) and 15 severe thunderstorm watches. The SPC assigns numbers to each severe weather watch issued starting at the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> year; the organization failed to use two of their allocated watch numbers during the outbreak (numbers 208 and 209).|$|E
5|$|Several {{procedures}} {{enable the}} Scottish Parliament to scrutinise the Government. The First Minister {{or members of}} the cabinet can deliver statements to Parliament upon which MSPs are invited to question. For example, at the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> parliamentary year, the First Minister delivers {{a statement to the}} chamber setting out the Government's legislative programme for the forthcoming year. After the statement has been delivered, the leaders of the opposition parties and other MSPs question the First Minister on issues related to the substance of the statement.|$|E

Typically each committee corresponds with one (or more) of the departments (or ministries) of the Scottish Government. The current Subject Committees in the fourth Session are: Economy, Energy and Tourism; Education and Culture; Health and Sport; Justice; Local Government and Regeneration; Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment; Welfare Reform; and Infrastructure and Capital Investment.|$|E
5|$|The 435 {{members of}} the House of Representatives elect a Speaker by {{majority}} rule at the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> session of the United States Congress, who serves {{until the end of}} the Congress. Typically, the election is a formality, as the majority party's members vote as a bloc for their party's previously-chosen Speaker-designate (such as the speaker, majority leader, or minority leader from the previous term). Open elections are uncommon but have occurred. The last Speaker election to require multiple ballots occurred in 1923.|$|E
5|$|The Bahá'í {{calendar}} {{is based}} upon the calendar established by the Báb. The year consists of 19 months, each having 19 days, with four or five intercalary days, to make a full solar year. The Bahá'í New Year corresponds to the traditional Persian New Year, called Naw Rúz, and occurs on the vernal equinox, near 21 March, {{at the end of the}} month of fasting. Bahá'í communities gather at the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> month at a meeting called a Feast for worship, consultation and socializing.|$|E

It is the first episode to feature a 'Previously on Lost' segment, a clip shown at the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> episode summarizing the recent events of the show. The episode receives {{its name from the}} philosophical idea of tabula rasa, meaning blank slate, a concept which is brought in one of the episode's final lines, when Jack tells Kate that all of the Flight 815 survivors should be allowed to restart with a new life.|$|E
5|$|This list classifies all of {{the works}} by Priestley. It is taken from Ronald E. Crook's A Bibliography of Joseph Priestley 1733-1804 (unless {{otherwise}} noted) and it follows very closely his generic subdivisions. All texts are by Priestley unless otherwise noted and only the first English language editions of the texts are listed below. The dash at the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> entry below is a shorthand for the author's name, Joseph Priestley, consistent with standard bibliographic custom.|$|E

5|$|After each {{election}} to the Scottish Parliament, at the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> parliamentary session, Parliament elects one MSP to serve as Presiding Officer, {{the equivalent of the}} speaker in other legislatures, and two MSPs to serve as deputies. The Presiding Officer (currently Ken Macintosh) and deputies (currently Linda Fabiani and Christine Grahame) are elected by a secret ballot of the 129 MSPs, which is the only secret ballot conducted in the Scottish Parliament. Principally, the role of the Presiding Officer is to chair chamber proceedings and the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body. When chairing meetings of the Parliament, the Presiding Officer and his/her deputies must be politically impartial. During debates, the Presiding Officer (or the deputy) is assisted by the parliamentary clerks, who give advice on how to interpret the standing orders that govern the proceedings of meetings. A vote clerk sits in front of the Presiding Officer and operates the electronic voting equipment and chamber clocks.|$|E
5|$|Because he was {{painting}} fresco, the plaster was laid {{in a new}} section every day, called a giornata. At the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> session, the edges would be scraped away and a new area laid down. The edges between giornate remain slightly visible; thus, they give {{a good idea of}} how the work progressed. It was customary for fresco painters to use a full-sized detailed drawing, a cartoon, to transfer a design onto a plaster surface—many frescoes show little holes made with a stiletto, outlining the figures. Here Michelangelo broke with convention; once confident the intonaco had been well applied, he drew directly onto the ceiling. His energetic sweeping outlines can be seen scraped into some of the surfaces, while on others a grid is evident, indicating that he enlarged directly onto the ceiling from a small drawing.|$|E
5|$|Due to the Famicom's {{restricted}} hardware capabilities, the remake {{is entirely}} two-dimensional. Special compensation {{was made for}} some of the in-battle sprites such as Cloud Strife's, combining two 16x24 pixel sprites side-by-side instead of the usual single sprite to account for weapons such as Cloud's sword or Barret's gun. While most Japanese games use only 8x8-pixel hiragana or katakana fonts, and most Chinese games use 4-color 16x16-pixel tiles stored in dedicated CHR ROM pages, this game uses its own several-hundred 16x16-pixel monochrome font instead. The script itself is strewn in chunks across the code; at the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> piece of text for dialog boxes is a three digit number preceded by an @-symbol, signifying which character portrait to display.|$|E

5|$|In Parenthesis (1937) by David Jones, {{in which}} he {{reflects}} on the carnage he witnessed in the First World War. Jones put a quotation from the Gododdin at the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> of the seven sections of In Parenthesis. Another poet writing in English, Richard Caddel, used Y Gododdin {{as the basis of}} his difficult but much-admired poem For the Fallen (1997), written in memory of his son Tom. Tony Conran's poem Elegy for the Welsh Dead, in the Falklands Islands, 1982 opens with the line 'Men went to Catraeth', using the original poem to comment on a contemporary conflict. The theme and rhythm of Y Gododdin are also the undercurrent for Owen Sheers’s Pink Mist (2012), an epic elegy to dead and wounded soldiers who served in Afghanistan; the poem, which drew on 30 interviews with returned servicemen, was originally commissioned for radio and then produced by the Old Vic theatre company as a stage play.|$|E
5|$|In {{front of}} the Presiding Officers' desk is the {{parliamentary}} mace, which is made from silver and inlaid with gold panned from Scottish rivers and inscribed with the words: Wisdom, Compassion, Justice and Integrity. The words There shall be a Scottish Parliament, which are the first words of the Scotland Act, are inscribed around {{the head of the}} mace, which has a ceremonial role in the meetings of Parliament, representing the authority of the Parliament to make laws. Presented to the Scottish Parliament by the Queen upon Parliament's official opening in July 1999, the mace is displayed in a glass case, suspended from the lid. At the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> sitting in the chamber, the lid of the case is rotated so that the mace is above the glass, to symbolise that a full meeting of the Parliament is taking place.|$|E
5|$|The {{first team}} of writers, {{assembled}} by Sam Simon, consisted of John Swartzwelder, Jon Vitti, George Meyer, Jeff Martin, Al Jean, Mike Reiss, Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky. Newer Simpsons writing teams typically consist of sixteen writers who propose episode ideas at the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> December. The main writer of each episode writes the first draft. Group rewriting sessions develop final scripts by adding or removing jokes, inserting scenes, {{and calling for}} re-readings of lines by the show's vocal performers. Until 2004, George Meyer, who had developed the show since the first season, was active in these sessions. According to long-time writer Jon Vitti, Meyer usually invented the best lines in a given episode, even though other writers may receive script credits. Each episode takes six months to produce so the show rarely comments on current events.|$|E

5|$|The {{magazine}} {{began as}} a bimonthly, but switched to a monthly schedule in January 1940, though this only lasted six issues. June 1940 was followed by August and October 1940 and January and March 1941. The May 1941 issue inaugurated another monthly period that lasted until August 1943, when the schedule switched back to bimonthly until the June 1944 issue. Fantastic then went on a quarterly schedule, beginning with the October 1944 issue; in October 1945 it became bimonthly again, {{though there was a}} gap between February and May 1946. From September 1947 {{to the end of the}} run the magazine was monthly. The volume numeration was regular, with a new volume starting at the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> calendar year; the result was a variable number of issues in each volume, from a low of four in 1944 to a full twelve when the magazine was monthly, as it was for the last few years of its life. The last issue was volume 15 number 3.|$|E

Once this has been returned to the player's trapped father, the next body part location will be revealed. Once all eight body parts have been collected and returned to the refrigerator, the player must find a needle and thread in order to restore the Android Queen.

5|$|While {{eight of}} the Nine Ministers could be of {{commoner}} origin, the post of Minister of the Imperial Clan (Zongzheng 宗正), {{also known as the}} Director of the Imperial Clan, was always occupied {{by a member of the}} imperial family. He oversaw the imperial court's interactions with the empire's nobility and extended imperial family, such as granting fiefs and titles. His ministry was responsible for record-keeping of all nobles, a register being updated at the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> year. When a serious infraction was committed by a member of the imperial family, the Minister of the Imperial Clan was the first high official to be notified before the emperor, who made the ultimate decision about any possible legal action. This minister's subordinates heard grievances of imperial family members and informed them about new ordinances. Unlike kings and marquesses, who were not responsible to any of the Nine Ministers, imperial princesses and their fiefs were kept under surveillance by the Minister of the Imperial Clan.|$|E
