In this study, global rotating mode shapes of flexible <b>shrouded</b> <b>bladed</b> disc-shaft assemblies are calculated.

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{prospects of}} using blisks with <b>shrouded</b> <b>blades.</b> Increasing an engine life and efficiency {{as well as}} mass reduction can also be achieved by increasing blade numbers and decreasing disk diameter. But design engineers {{are faced with the}} problem of blade placement because of the disk size and root dimensions. The problem of increasing life and cyclic durability, vibration strength, and lightweight design of the turbine gas turbine wheels, can be solved by an elimination of blade - disk locks. The technology of manufacturing one-piece blisks by connecting the blades with the disc part using hot isostatic pressing was developed. This technology allows us to use <b>blades</b> with <b>shrouds.</b> It is necessary to increase efficiency and to improve high cycle fatigue performance of rotor blades. One of the pressing problems is to ensure the necessary position of shrouds in relation {{to each other in the}} manufacturing process as well as in the service. Numerical studies of the influence of the shroud mounting position on blade strength during operation allowed us to develop a methodology of choosing a shroud mounting position. Based on the two turbine wheels (LPT and HPT) calculations advantages of blisk design with respect to the lock-based design were shown. Application of bimetallic blisks with <b>shrouded</b> <b>blades</b> resulted in a lifespan increase and weight reduction. In addition, other advantages of blisk design are as follows: possible reduction in the number of parts, elimination of leaks and fretting that take place in the blade - disk locks, exception of expensive broaching operations and disk alloy saving. The shortcoming is elimination of damping in root connection. In addition, there are no widely used repair methods. Despite these disadvantages the usage of bimetallic turbine blisks with <b>shrouded</b> <b>blades</b> is very promising. </p...|$|R

A new {{improved}} multidiscipline feasible (MDF) strategy {{based on}} the updating approximate function constructed by Response Surface Method (RSM) is firstly pointed out and denoted as MDF-update-RSM which involves double cycles.

40|$|An {{investigation}} of the mode localization phenomenon associated with mistuning is presented for <b>shrouded</b> <b>blade</b> assemblies. The calculations {{are based on a}} generic finite element model, which permits modeling of arbitrary mistuning and both slipping and nonslipping shroud interfaces. The results presented indicate that interactions occur between mistuning and slip effects, with maximum mode localization occurring when the shrouds slip freely. Certain modes are found to be very sensitive to shroud slip, and in some cases completely change character when slip occurs. Mode localization is most pronounced in the predominantly bending modes, and varies considerably from mode to mode. As the ratio of interblade coupling strength to mistuning strength is increased, the effect of mistuning is observed to decrease significantly. This result has important implications for the flutter problem, since it suggests that the stabilization effect available from mistuning is significantly less for a shrouded rotor as compared to an unshrouded rotor...|$|R

The blade wake was a combination of profile loss and low momentum air from the outer shroud, and the magnitude of the wake loss is to this extent an indication of {{the presence or absence of}} radial flow. At a high Mach number, shock-boundary-layer thickening on the blade suction surfaces provided an additional radial flow path for low momentum air, which resulted in large inner shroud loss regions accompanied by large deviations from design values of discharge angle.

40|$|Actual {{trend in}} steam turbine design {{is to use}} <b>blades</b> with {{integral}} <b>shrouds,</b> for high pressure and intermediate pressure steam turbine sections, as well as sometimes also for the long blades of the low pressure sections. The blades are either inserted with their root into the seat on the shaft {{in such a way}} that small clearances remain between adjacent <b>blade</b> <b>shrouds,</b> so that the relative vibration amplitude is restricted by the contact between adjacent shrouds. This mechanism is called “snubbing mechanism”. Another technology for mounting blades on the shaft is to do it {{in such a way that}} the blades are slightly forced against each other in correspondence of the shrouds: this should allow the continuity of the contact without clearances also at rated speed and full load. In this case the blades are called “pre-twisted”. Field experience has shown that these kinds of blade rows has a “robust and smooth” behavior. But there is still some lack of theoretical/numerical investigation for defining its dynamical behavior in different operating conditions, both for the blades with clearance and with pre-twist. The aim of this paper is to investigate numerically the non-linear dynamic behavior of a couple of <b>shrouded</b> <b>blades,</b> taking account of contact forces and friction. An equivalent linear model has then been developed for analyzing the behavior of the complete blade row. Also some provisional experimental results on non-rotating blade rows are presented...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{increasing}} interest {{has been given}} to the rotordynamic fluid forces on impellers, from the view point of the shaft vibration analysis. Previous experimental and analytical results have shown that the fluid-induced forces and moments on closed type pump impellers contribute substantially to the potential destabilization of subsynchronous shaft vibrations. However, to date few papers are known of the rotordynamic fluid forces on open-type centrifugal impellers. This paper reports about experimental investigations of the rotordynamic fluid force moments on an open-type centrifugal compressor impeller in precessing motion. For open-type impellers, the variations of the tip clearance and the clearance between the <b>back</b> <b>shroud</b> and casing due to the precessing motion contribute to the rotordynamic fluid force moments. Experiments were conducted to measure the rotordynamic fluid force moments directly using the 4 -axis sensor, and the unsteady pressure on the front and back casing wall. In this paper, following results are obtained: (1) The fluid force moment becomes destabilizing in the region of negative precessing speed ratio (- 0. 3 <Ω/ω< 0), at the design flow rate; (2) At reduced flow rate, the destabilizing fluid force moments occurred at small positive precessing speed ratio (0. 2 <Ω/ω< 0. 4); (3) From the comparison of direct measured fluid force moments with those estimated from the unsteady pressure measured on the front and back casing walls, {{it was found that the}} destabilizing moments in the backward precession are mainly caused by the fluid forces on the front surface of the present impeller, where there is large clearance between the <b>back</b> <b>shroud</b> and casing...|$|R
30|$|Figures  10 and 11 {{indicate}} {{that in the}} same condition, a large difference in the radial distribution exists in the angles of 0 °, 90 °, 180 °, and 270 ° of the dimensionless tangential and radial velocities. The fluid in the flow core zone is in the circumference with the same radius, such that {{a significant change in}} the tangential and radial velocities occurs; however, near the volute, tangential and radial velocities are obviously subject to the constraint function of the main flow in the volute. Accordingly, the obtained value tends to be in agreement with an increase in radius. In the flow rate ranging from 0.6 Qsp to 1.2 Qsp, the larger the flow is, the more nearly equal the magnitude of dimensionless tangential and radial velocities with the four angles tends to become. Above the degree of 0 °, v̅_u increases with an increase in radius. The larger the flow becomes, the larger v̅_u is; however, v̅_r is smaller than zero. That is, the fluid flows from the volute to the sealing ring. Above the degree of 90 °, v̅_u decreases with an increase in radius, and the flow becomes large. v̅_u is small, but v̅_r is always smaller than zero, that is, the fluid flows from the volute to the sealing ring. Above the degree of 180 °, v̅_u is small with the change in the radius and flow rate. Meanwhile, v̅_u is always larger than 0.5, and v̅_r is always larger than zero. At the same radius, v̅_r becomes small with an increase in flow, that is, the fluid flows from the sealing ring to the volute. The larger the flow is, the smaller v̅_r is. Above the degree of 270 °, v̅_u increases in radius. The larger the flow rate is, the larger v̅_u is. However, v̅_r is always close to zero, that is, the fluid is approximately still along the radial direction. The above phenomena are {{due to the fact that}} the high-energy fluid in the impeller outlet flows into the <b>back</b> <b>shroud</b> cavity through the volute. The high-energy fluid in the impeller outlet continues to transfer energy to the low-energy fluid in the <b>back</b> <b>shroud</b> cavity with an inner radius. The cross-sectional area of the volute cross section with 90 ° angle direction is small, and the energy obtained in the inner radius increases rapidly. However, the radial pressure difference increases with increased dynamic energy. The cross-sectional area of the volute cross section with 0 ° angle direction is large, but the radial pressure difference is small. The fluid in the inner radius has less dynamic energy. Hence, the larger the cross-sectional area of the volute cross section is, the smaller the v̅_u of the fluid in the <b>back</b> <b>shroud</b> cavity is. The v̅_r radial distribution condition illustrates that the existence of 0 ° and 90 ° fluid in the core zone of the <b>back</b> <b>shroud</b> cavity signifies a radial flow from the volute to the sealing ring, that is, leakage flow exists. An increase in flow operation and in the main fluid flowing in the volute may exert a significant impact on the fluid flowing in the shroud cavity; therefore, the value of tangential and radial velocities tends to be in agreement. The main flow direction is also agreement with Figure  8.|$|R

This work is focused on coatings applied on the Z-notches of turbine <b>shrouded</b> <b>blades</b> in order to minimize the damage due to fretting wear.

The tribological behavior of coatings is affected by several parameters such as i) the contact conditions - normal load, relative speed, surface morphology - ii) the environmental conditions - temperature, gases, lubrication - and iii) the contact materials, in term of mechanical and chemical properties.

40|$|A {{statistical}} {{investigation of}} the effects of uncertainty in root fixity on the free vibration of turbine blades is made. Emphasis is particularly placed on the statistical properties of the random eigenvalues and essentially on their standard deviations. These are evaluated using the direct product technique between matrices [1] and validated by Monte Carlo SImulations (MCS). The studied system is a simplified model of a <b>shrouded</b> <b>blade</b> assembly under the conditions of weak interblade coupling. It essentially consists of a cyclic chain of continuous beams with identical properties, fixed at one end via rotational springs with random stiffnesses representing the uncertain roots stiffnesses and coupled via linear springs at their tips. Finite Element Method is used as a discretization technique to obtain the equations of motion of the tuned and mistuned systems and the corresponding random eigenvalue problem. Numerical simulations show that small differences between the rotational springs stiffnesses spolit the natural frequencies that were in pairs, increase the width of each frequency-cluster and strongly localizes the vibration around one blade. This strong localization has been shown to occur in a chain of single-degree-of-freedom, nearly identical, coupled oscillators if the coupling frequency between the subsystems is of order of, or smaller than the spread in the natural frequencies [2] However, for the multi-degree-of-freedom and randomly mistuned system considered her, multiple realizations are required to capture the behaviour of the eigenvalues appearing in frequency-clusters. It is found that for each frequency-cluster, when the standard deviations of theeigenvalues are plotted against the mode number, they form a U-shaped curve. For the particular case when the coupling frequency line crosses a curve, this essentially shows that the vibration localization is stronger at the first and last modes than at the mid frequencies, which belong to one passband in the tuned system...|$|R
40|$|The Blade Tip-Timing is a {{well-known}} non-contact measurement technique currently employed for {{the identification of the}} dynamic behaviours of rotating bladed disks. Although the measurement system has become a typical industry equipment for bladed disks vibration surveys, the type of sensors, the positioning of the sensors around the bladed disk and the used algorithm for data post-processing are still not standard techniques, and their reliability has to be proved for different operation conditions by the comparison with other well-established measurement techniques used as reference like strain gauges. This paper aims at evaluating the accuracy of a latest generation Tip-Timing system on two dummy blisks characterized by different geometrical, structural and dynamical properties. Both disks are tested into a spin-rig where a fixed number of permanent magnets excite synchronous vibrations with respect to the rotor speed. A new positioning for the Blade Tip-Timing optical sensors is tested {{in the case of a}} <b>shrouded</b> <b>bladed</b> disk.

Besides the typical Blade Tip-Timing application aimed at identifying the dynamical properties of each blade, an original method is here proposed to identify the operative deflection shape of a bladed disk through the experimental determination of the nodal diameters.

This paper describes a computer simulation to predict the flows, pressures, and temperatures in magnetic drive sealless pumps. The program has been developed using both theoretical and test work. The objective of the program was to provide reliable selection of magnetic drive pumps; this was accomplished by taking into account the effects of viscosity, vapor pressure, and other liquid properties on the local pressures in the pump. The goal of this program was thus to simulate a customer?s desired application of a particular fluid at an operating pressure, temperature, NPSH, and speed. The resulting conclusion would be whether the customer?s fluid and operating conditions were applicable for sealless pumps. Warnings are output through the graphical user interface of the program at the various points, should flashing occur using the particular fluid. The testing involved a wide range of pump sizes. Within each size, an extensive matrix involved running at different speeds, different cut impeller diameters, and from shutoff through runout condition. The units were tested with different shell configurations and different materials. These included polyetheretherketone (known as PEEK), Alloy C- 276, and a dual containment consisting of both materials. The design of the <b>back</b> <b>shroud</b> influences the magnitude of the hub factor. This is because the traditional affinity laws cannot be applied to the calculation of the axial load for semiopen impeller with a scalloped <b>back</b> <b>shroud,</b> pump out vanes, or pump out slots. One of the important findings was that the impeller hub factor, which is required for the computation of the axial load, changed as a function of speed and cut impeller diameter. It was also found that pump out vanes or pump out slots significantly enhanced the lubrication through the bearings and across magnets. Part of the verification involved performing tests with different bushing clearances and grooving configurations. These were analyzed empirically to confirm the coefficients that were obtained from experimental methods. In order to examine the possible operation of the pump when handling the user?s particular fluid, the flow is simulated in the program using a graphical user interface. A graphical output is given of all the pertinent locations in the systems, such as the thrust collar face or the gap between the driven magnets and the shell. The program currently calculates the pressure, flow, and temperature within the flowpath, along with the axial thrust, at five pump operating flow conditions expressed {{as a percentage of the}} best efficiency point...|$|R
60|$|After {{an hour or}} so {{the shower}} passed away. My {{companion}} slept through it all, or at least appeared so to do; and now that it was over I had not the heart to awaken him. As I lay on my <b>back</b> completely <b>shrouded</b> with verdure, the leafy branches drooping over me, and my limbs buried in grass, I could not avoid comparing our situation with that of the interesting babes in the wood. Poor little sufferers!—no wonder their constitutions broke down under the hardships to which they were exposed.|$|R
