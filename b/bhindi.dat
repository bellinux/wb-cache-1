50|$|In Northern India, pakoras {{are added}} to the {{chickpea}} gravy and sour yogurt is added to add flavour to it. They are eaten either with boiled rice or roti. In Rajasthan and Gujarat, it is usually served with khichdi, roti, paratha or rice. It is considered a light food. Rajasthani and Gujarati kadhi differs from the Uttar Pradesh variety. Traditionally, it is sweeter than the other variants, because sugar or jaggery is added to it, but it can be made without sugar for a more sour taste. It is eaten without pakoras and its consistency is slightly thinner. The Gujarati kadhi is made preferably from buttermilk as it gives a more smooth texture compared to yogurt. Variations on this basic dish includes the addition of certain vegetables, notably <b>bhindi</b> (okra) in which case it is known as bhinda ni kadhi. In Punjab Kadhi is a simple, quick winter meal. Made from Besan (also known as chickpea flour or Gram Flour) to thicken the consistency, and adding pakoras, it is eaten with either long grain basmati rice or, (more commonly) with a roti. Unlike the rest of India, sour yoghurt is not added, just full fat buttermilk, or unsweetened yoghurt.|$|E
