25|$|Talks between Nixon and Prime Minister Edward Heath {{may have}} been bugged. Heath did not {{publicly}} display his anger, with aides {{saying that he was}} unconcerned about having been bugged at the White House. According to officials, Heath commonly had notes taken of his public discussions with Nixon so a recording would not have bothered him. However, officials privately said that if private talks with Nixon were bugged, then Heath would <b>be</b> <b>outraged.</b> Even so, Heath was privately outraged over being taped without his prior knowledge.|$|E
25|$|The storyline {{takes place}} at the Kappa Alpha Delta fraternity. Marty is the 18-year-old party girl, while Todd is the 20-year-old quintessential jock. She is his tutor, but he does not pass one of his exams. Because of this, he is kicked off the {{football}} team and will not graduate on time. Additionally, his abusive father will <b>be</b> <b>outraged.</b> Angered by this outcome, Todd initially decides to humiliate Marty at a party (the Spring Fling). She is the one to humiliate him, however, and even notes his inability to satisfy her in bed. As revenge, Todd has his fraternity brothers Powell Lord (the III) and Zach Rosen help him rape her after she is left alone upstairs in Kevin's room.|$|E

25|$|On August 24, 2010, the United Nations {{confirmed}} that rebels from the FDLR {{and from the}} Mai Mai militia raped and assaulted at least 154 civilians from July 30 to August 3, {{in the town of}} Luvungi in North Kivu province. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who had made protecting civilians and combating sexual violence central themes of his presidency, was reported to <b>be</b> <b>outraged</b> by the attack. Atul Khare, deputy head of the U.N.'s peacekeeping department, was dispatched to the region, and Margot Wallström, the organisation's special representative for sexual violence in conflict, was instructed to take charge of the U.N. response and follow up. The United Nations had withdrawn 1,700 peace keepers in recent months, responding to the Congolese government's demand to end the UN peacekeeping mission (recently renamed MONUSCO). Earlier Wallstrom was quoted as saying that this withdrawal would make the struggle against sexual violence in the region significantly more difficult.|$|E
25|$|The {{killing of}} Smaïl-aga {{set in motion}} a series of attacks which left many Montenegrins and Turks dead. Anxious to conceal his role in the murder, Ali Pasha pretended to <b>be</b> <b>outraged</b> and ordered an attack on the Drobnjaci. More than seventy Drobnjaci warriors were killed, dozens of homes were torched, wells were {{poisoned}} and several women were raped. At the same time, Ali Pasha sought to shore up his own position by removing any pretext for intervention by the Porte. He contacted Njegoš and expressed a willingness to engage in peace negotiations. Njegoš was in a quandary; he knew that by failing to avenge the Drobnjaci he risked alienating a sizeable portion of his countrymen. At the same time, Njegoš realized that such negotiations could increase Montenegro's territory and bring about diplomatic recognition by Austria and the Ottomans, who wanted peace and an end to the continuous skirmishing on the Montenegrin–Turkish frontier. In 1841, in an attempt to legitimize his country and under Russian pressure to normalize relations with Austria, Njegoš reached an agreement with the Austrians defining the Austro–Montenegrin border. Despite the agreement, the Austrians failed to officially recognize Montenegro as a sovereign state, and demanded the Montenegrins' complete withdrawal from the coast in exchange for Montenegrin tribesmen being permitted to seek pasturage for their sheep and cattle in Kotor. The withdrawal required the Montenegrins to give up two historic monasteries (Podmaine and Stanjevići), which the Austrians subsequently purchased for a considerable sum. Despite these concessions, the agreement improved trading between the two sides.|$|E

500|$|Dot's second {{significant}} romance {{was built}} upon by scriptwriters in 2000 on {{the behest of}} producer John Yorke. Dot was paired romantically with pensioner Jim Branning, played by John Bardon and a slow courtship was featured, with Dot often shown to <b>be</b> <b>outraged</b> by Jim's advances, resulting in numerous rejections. Dot finally succumbed and accepted his marriage proposal in an episode that aired in November 2001; the scenes were filmed inside one of the carriages of the London Eye on the South Bank of the River Thames. Their wedding aired on 14 February 2002, Valentine's Day. The Guardian critic, Nancy Banks-Smith, described the wedding as [...] "uniquely uneventful [...] For Dot and Jim 'In sickness and health... till death do us part' seemed to carry more resonance than for most." ...|$|E
500|$|The Robert Bolt play A Man For All Seasons {{focuses on}} the {{conscience}} of Catholic lawyer Thomas More in his struggle with King Henry VIII ("the loyal subject is more bounden to be loyal to his conscience than to any other thing"). George Orwell wrote his novel Nineteen Eighty-Four on the isolated island of Jura, Scotland to describe how a man (Winston Smith) attempts to develop critical conscience in a totalitarian state which watches every action {{of the people and}} manipulates their thinking with a mixture of propaganda, endless war and thought control through language control (double think and newspeak) to the point where prisoners look up to and even love their torturers. In the Ministry of Love, Winston's torturer (O'Brien) states: [...] "You are imagining that there is something called human nature which will <b>be</b> <b>outraged</b> by what we do and will turn against us. But we create human nature. Men are infinitely malleable".|$|E

Against all odds, the group's sound starts {{to come together and}} their prospects for success look bright. Will starts losing his [...] "loser-status", but the band {{gets in the way of}} completing a project he was going to do with Sa5m. After spending a day with Sa5m, Charlotte teaches Will how to properly kiss a girl, by demonstrating on him that night, which his mother sees. Will takes Sa5m to the Overlook and, after an awkward start, successfully kisses her, after which Sa5m shyly asks Will to accompany her to a movie screening, which he agrees to. However, Will stands Sa5m up, breaking the date for a concert with Charlotte. [...] After that, Sa5m starts ignoring Will at school; he visits her house, hoping to apologize. Her mom shows him a video of a younger Sa5m performing [...] "Everything I Own", leading Sa5m to <b>be</b> <b>outraged</b> and order Will to leave. As an apology, he makes a touching documentary short about her for his Human Studies project (with the song [...] "Young Folks" [...] included in it) and she eventually forgives him.|$|E

500|$|The second option had European precedents, {{including}} Edward's own great-grandfather, Duke Alexander of Württemberg, {{but it had}} no {{parallel in}} British constitutional history. The prime ministers of the five Dominions (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the Irish Free State) were consulted, and the majority agreed that there was [...] "no alternative to course (3)". William Lyon Mackenzie King (Prime Minister of Canada), Joseph Lyons (Prime Minister of Australia), and J. B. M. Hertzog (Prime Minister of South Africa) opposed options 1 and 2. Mackenzie King told Edward to do [...] "what he believed in his own heart was right" [...] and the Canadian government appealed to the King to put his duty before his feelings for Simpson. Governor General of Canada Lord Tweedsmuir told Buckingham Palace and Baldwin that Canadians held deep affection for the King, but also that Canadian public opinion would <b>be</b> <b>outraged</b> if Edward married a divorcee. Michael Joseph Savage (Prime Minister of New Zealand) rejected option 1 and thought that option 2 [...] "might be possible... if some solution along these lines {{were found to be}} practicable", but [...] "would be guided by the decision of the Home government". In communications with the British government, Éamon de Valera (President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State) remarked that as a Roman Catholic country, the Irish Free State did not recognise divorce. He supposed that if the British people would not accept Wallis Simpson then abdication was the only possible solution. On 24 November, Baldwin consulted the three leading opposition politicians in Britain: Leader of the Opposition Clement Attlee, Liberal leader Sir Archibald Sinclair, and Winston Churchill. Sinclair and Attlee agreed that options 1 and 2 were unacceptable, and Churchill pledged to support the government.|$|E

2500|$|In February 2010, it was {{reported}} that eight Iraqi nationals had been arrested in conjunction with the killings and had been detained by US forces and transferred to Baghdad. In October of the same year, six of the accused were released without charge and the trial of the remaining two suspects collapsed after two hours. The families of the six RMPs who were killed were reported to <b>be</b> <b>outraged</b> as in 2003, Geoff Hoon (the Defence Minister at that time) had told them that the MoD knew who the killers were. On the tenth anniversary of the killings in 2013, fresh calls were made by the families of the dead for an independent public inquiry as they did not believe that the MoD's own internal enquiry was robust enough, with one relative calling it [...] "flawed". This was then followed with {{at least two of the}} families attempting to sue the MoD for negligence in relation to the soldiers' deaths.

2500|$|McQueen was {{informed}} {{of this decision}} and cut his leave short, returning from overseas. At a meeting on 11 December 1929, Council unanimously resolved that Dr McQueen's appointment be terminated. Rev. A. M. Ogilvie, Minister at Beecroft, apologised for his absence and by letter indicated that he opposed the motion. He was McQueen's sole supporter. Subsequently, Messrs R. Vicars and F. Thompson interviewed McQueen to [...] "invite his resignation". McQueen, gentleman to the end, advised Council to take any action that it deemed necessary. McQueen's [...] "resignation" [...] agreement {{was that he would}} be paid £1,209 in lieu of notice and that his two daughters would be accepted at the College at the pleasure of Council, as day scholars free of ordinary school fees.

2500|$|Christopher Hitchens {{criticized the}} film for not {{mentioning}} {{the history of}} repression, aggression, war crimes and the general state {{of human rights in}} Saddam Hussein's Iraq, nor Iraq's noncompliance with numerous United Nations resolutions. Hitchens writes, [...] "in this peaceable kingdom, according to Moore's flabbergasting choice of film shots, children are flying little kites, shoppers are smiling in the sunshine, and the gentle rhythms of life are undisturbed. Then—wham! From the night sky come the terror weapons of American imperialism. Watching the clips Moore uses, and recalling them well, I can recognize various Saddam palaces and military and police centers getting the treatment. But these sites are not identified as such. In fact, I don't think Al Jazeera would, on a bad day, have transmitted anything so utterly propagandistic." [...] While interviewing Hitchens on his show, Scarborough claimed to <b>be</b> <b>outraged</b> at Moore's portrayal of the Iraqi insurgency, claiming Moore's film suggests [...] "those killing Americans in Iraq aren't the enemy, but rather they are the revolution and the Minutemen, who are sure to win their battle against the occupation" [...] and that [...] "Moore says that the enemy is George Bush and Saddam Hussein and Mr. Zarqawi and Mr. Bin Laden are no problem. ... Indeed, they are the Minutemen. They're the staunch American revolutionaries." ...|$|E
2500|$|Biblical {{references}} {{appear in}} several forms. Chapter VI cites the Book of Job, ii. 13); {{there is an}} allusion to the elder brother in the Parable of the Prodigal Son, and Margaret paraphrases the definition of charity ("that spirit which suffereth long and is kind and seeketh not her own") (Gaskell, 1855, chapter 15) from the First Epistle to the Corinthians. However, Gaskell cautions against misuse; Bessy Higgins reads the Apocalypse to cope with her condition and interprets the parable of Dives and Lazarus so simplistically that Margaret counters vigorously: [...] "It won't be division enough, in that awful day, {{that some of us}} have been beggars here, and some of us have been rich—we shall not be judged by that poor accident, but by our faithful following of Christ" [...] (Gaskell, 1855, chapter 19). Margaret and John follow a path of conversion which leads to reconciliation, acknowledging their [...] "unworthiness" [...] (Pollard, 1967). Margaret, who has the longest way to go, is crushed by guilt from her lie and by shame from being debased in Thornton's eyes (Gaskell, 1855, chapter 39). Francis de Sales encourages her to seek [...] "the way of humility" [...] (Gaskell, 1855, chapter 41), despite Mr. Bell's attempts to minimise and rationalise her lie as told in a panic. Thornton, on the brink of ruin like Job, tries not to <b>be</b> <b>outraged</b> while his mother rebels against the injustice of his situation ("Not for you, John!
