40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to develop an experimental facility that is able to characterize the work hardening behaviour of metal sheets up to large deformations greater than 50 percent effective strain. A hydraulic <b>bulge</b> <b>test</b> die was designed with a 120 -mm diameter piston to push the forming fluid against the sheet specimen, a 135 -mm diameter opening and a 3 -mm radius on the fillet of the die. This die was built and installed in a double-action hydraulic press and is capable of reaching a forming pressure of 60 MPa. DP 600 steel sheet specimens were also flat rolled to effective strains of 0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 6, 0. 8 and 1. 0 and tensile tests were conducted on the as-rolled specimens following ASTM E 8 standards. A power law curve was fitted to the data, and yielded ̅= 1026. 851 ̅ 0. 1951 in the rolling direction and ̅= 1022. 456 ̅ 0. 1758 in the transverse direction. Hydraulic bulge tests were successfully run and the experimental data was fitted to ̅= 1104. 6 ̅ 0. 2029. Finite element (FE) models of the hydraulic <b>bulge</b> <b>test</b> and uniaxial tensile test were constructed. FE models were validated using an appropriate validation metric, and the predicted uniaxial tension flow curve showed a validation score of 0. 97 and the flow curve predicted for the hydraulic <b>bulge</b> <b>test</b> achieved a score of 0. 98, compared to the experimental curves. Power law, Ludwik and Voce functions were fitted to the experimental data and hardening parameters were determined for both the tensile test with successive flat rolling and the hydraulic <b>bulge</b> <b>test</b> flow curves. Comparison metrics were established at 0. 94, 0. 87 and 0. 94, respectively.

An indirect method, Digital Image Correlation (DIC), is compared with a direct one, ultrasound pulse-echo method. Findings: The main conclusion is that the DIC system is a valid indirect measurement method to study bi-axial sheet metal forming.

Therefore, this thesis is an attempt to apply the <b>bulge</b> <b>test</b> and the nanoindentation technique for the mechanical characterization of PECVD BC thin films. Mechanical properties such as the Young’s modulus, hardness and residual stress were investigated. The <b>bulge</b> <b>test</b> system using an interferometry technique to measure the deflection of membrane has been designed. Commercially available LPCVD SiNx membrane windows were used as a substrate to deposit BC films for the <b>bulge</b> <b>test.</b> The effect of SiNx membrane configuration on the stability of SiNx/BC bi-layer membranes is also studied. The <b>bulge</b> <b>test</b> was used to investigate the residual stress in annealed BC films with two different thicknesses close to 59 and 74 nm. The nanoindentation technique has been used to investigate the Young’s modulus and the hardness of as-deposited and annealed BC films deposited on silicon substrates. The properties of three film thicknesses close to 100, 200, and 300 nm have been investigated in each category. The compressive stress and the density of films were found to be the two important factors affecting the Young’s modulus and the hardness of BC films.

40|$|The <b>bulge</b> <b>testing</b> {{technique}} {{determines the}} mechanical properties of solid thin films {{by measuring the}} deformation that forms {{in response to the}} application of a controlled differential pressure to a thin film window. By comparing the pressure-displacement relation with a mechanical model, the elastic modulus and residual stress in the film can be measured. While the <b>bulge</b> <b>testing</b> technique can be quite effective, the technique is not routinely used because of difficulties that often arise with using this technique. The difficulties include specimen preparation and mounting, automated bulge height measurement and the correlation of bulge deformation with the mechanical properties of the thin film. This paper describes developments in the <b>bulge</b> <b>testing</b> technique that alleviate many of these difficulties, as well as presenting results from the testing of single and dual layer thin films. Single film tests were conducted on samples of B-doped-Si, SiC, and diamond-like carbon. A total of 135 windows with three different window aspect ratios and two different thicknesses were investigated. In a preliminary study to determine the feasibility of extending the technique to the testing of multilayer films, the mechanics of a dual layer system were measured. The dual layer system was an Al layer on top of B-doped-Si. The results from the single film test were that the elastic moduli of the B-doped-Si were close to nominal bulk values and the diamond-like carbon was about half that of diamond. The SiC elastic moduli measurements were inconclusive because of the large prestress. Elastic moduli measurements from nanoindentation were about 50 % higher. It should be noted that neither the variation of the aspect ratio nor the variation of the film thickness led to different results. The measured prestresses agreed quite well with wafer curvature measurement.
