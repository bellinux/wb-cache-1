As {{the envelope}} necessarily depends on quantity served {{the cost and}} quality implications are investigated for small and large market areas. Where public insurees face no price at all, demand for medical care depends on quality that, under public systems, is typically a combination of care in procedures and the time-price. Whereas in small market areas inducing quality scale economies through monopoly, there is no tension between quality and cost, large areas potentially exhibit a tradeoff between quality and cost. Competition in large areas may induce cost efficiency but its effect on quality is ambiguous because of the conflicting effects of competition and scale. However, the “Centers of Excellence ” (hospitals specializing in particular procedures) that might emerge {{as a result of}} competition or fiat internalize the effect of scale on quality for a given procedure. <b>Budget</b> <b>envelopes</b> appear as poor instruments for this internalization whereas a US-type yardstick competition through the prospective DRG reimbursement provides a strong incentive for such specialization...|$|R

It is now proposing an Open Access publishing model which goes beyond present, sometimes controversial, proposals, with a novel practical approach: the Sponsoring Consortium for Open Access Publishing in Particle Physics (SCOAP 3). In this model, libraries and research institutions federate to explicitly cover the costs of the peer-review and other editorial services, rather than implicitly supporting them via journal subscriptions. Rather than through subscriptions, journals will their costs from SCOAP 3 and make the electronic versions of their journals free to read. Unlike many ?author-pays? Open Access models, authors are not directly charged to publish their articles in the Open Access paradigm. Contributions to the SCOAP 3 consortium are determined on a country-by-country basis, according to the volume of HEP publications originating from each country. They would come from nation-wide re-directions of current subscriptions to HEP journals. SCOAP 3 will negotiate with publishers in the field the price of their peer review services through a tendering process. Journals converted to Open Access will be then decoupled from package licenses. The global yearly <b>budget</b> <b>envelope</b> for this transition is estimated at about 10 Million Euros.

Through an iterative approach, SCS automatically determines which functions to be compressed given a performance constraint and/or a code size constraint in order to guarantee a minimal performance and a maximal code size for an application.

40|$|The {{aging of}} Canada’s {{population}} {{in the coming decades}} will drive up the cost of many government programs, such as public health insurance and elderly benefits. In the area of primary and secondary education, though, the opposite should be true (Robson 2003). With a declining share of youngsters in the population, governments should be able to spend relatively less on their education and redirect resources to other programs. That reallocation of public funds should already be under way because in most provinces, kindergarten-to-grade 12 (K- 12) enrolments have been falling significantly since the mid- 1990 s. With no corresponding decline in spending, however, falling enrolments have not freed up any margin in provincial budgets. One cause of the phenomenon is that there are no mechanism to ensure that overall education budgets respond closely to changes in enrolment.

40|$|Prioritizing {{investments}} across health interventions {{is complicated}} by the nonlinear relationship between intervention coverage and epidemiological outcomes. It can be difficult for countries to know which interventions to prioritize for greatest epidemiological impact, particularly when budgets are uncertain. We examined four case studies of HIV epidemics in diverse settings, each with different characteristics. These case studies were based on public data available for Belarus, Peru, Togo, and Myanmar. The Optima HIV model and software package was used to estimate the optimal distribution of resources across interventions associated with a range of <b>budget</b> <b>envelopes.</b> We constructed "investment staircases", a useful tool for understanding investment priorities. These were used to estimate the best attainable cost-effectiveness of the response at each investment level. We find that when budgets are very limited, the optimal HIV response consists of a smaller number of 'core' interventions. As budgets increase, those core interventions should first be scaled up, and then new interventions introduced. We estimate that the cost-effectiveness of HIV programming decreases as investment levels increase, but that the overall cost-effectiveness remains below GDP per capita. It is important for HIV programming to respond effectively to the overall level of funding availability. The analytic tools presented here can help to guide program planners understand the most cost-effective HIV responses and plan for an uncertain future...|$|R
40|$|Proactive Learning is a {{generalized}} form of active learning where the learner must {{reach out to}} multiple oracles exhibiting different costs and reliabilities (label noise).

Noting that curriculum and instruction issues rank a distant fifth behind frontrunner funding issues in the 1988 American Association of School Administrator's Survey, disapproval about funding priorities and program-based budgeting systems is expressed.

In addition, when expenditures outstrip income based on foundation levels established according to the annual inflation rate, funding emergencies occur. The report concludes that such a reconceptualization will not prevent policymakers from meeting their long-term or short-term budgeting obligations.

40|$|Summary. Common {{envelopes}} form in dynamical {{time scale}} mass exchange, when the envelope of a donor star engulfs a much denser companion, and {{the core of}} the donor plus the dense companion star spiral inward through this dissipative envelope. As conceived by Paczynski and Ostriker, this process must be responsible for the creation of short-period binaries with degenerate components, and, indeed, it has proven capable of accounting for short-period binaries containing one white dwarf component. However, attempts to reconstruct the evolutionary histories of close double white dwarfs have proven more problematic, and point to the need for enhanced systemic mass loss, either during the close of the first, slow episode of mass transfer that produced the first white dwarf, or during the detached phase preceding the final, common envelope episode. The survival of long-period interacting binaries with massive white dwarfs, such as the recurrent novae T CrB and RS Oph, also presents interpretative difficulties for simple energetic treatments of common envelope evolution. Their existence implies that major terms are missing from usual formulations of the energy <b>budget</b> for common <b>envelope</b> evolution.

40|$|The {{emerging}} {{field of}} {{internet of things}} promises mankind an enhanced life quality, produc-tivity and security. One critical technology enabler is ubiquitous and unobtrusive wireless connectivity activated by ambient events and operated with little human intervention for con-figuration and maintenance. Commercial off-the-shelf radio devices cannot achieve the desired performance, reliability and ultra-low power consumption around 100 µW at the same time. In this work, research is carried out on the design and implementation of an ultra-low-power radio for generic wireless event-driven applications including healthcare, information and enter-tainment, industrial and home automation, as well as environment monitoring. To fulfill the stringent power <b>budget,</b> the <b>envelope</b> detection and the direct-modulation are the architectures of choice for receiver and transmitter front-ends, respectively. However, such radios suffer from poor sensitivity and frequency selectivity, and thus are unable to op-erate reliably across the desired link distance or {{in the presence of}} interference. This work investigated the root causes of insufficient sensitivity and selectivity in envelope detection receivers, and proposed design guidelines to optimize their performance. Furthermore, two novel envelope detection schemes have been proposed. The synchronized-switching technique improves the sensitivity by suppressing DC offset and 1 /f noise in the receiver, while the 2 -tone signaling technique enables in-band interference rejection which was not possible in prior arts. Prototype circuits have been built to verify the proposed techniques. On a 90 nm CMOS technology, a transmitter and a receiver front-end are designed to benchmark the performance of 2 -tone envelope detection in practice. The digital-IF, direct-modulation transmitter carries out the 2 -tone IF-PSK modulation with - 6 dBm output power while consuming 893 µW. The 2 -tone envelope detection receiver realized up to 282 times improvement in interference re-jection while dissipating between 63. 5 µW and 121 µW. A link budget of over 80 dB is realized by this transceiver pair, which translates to a link span up to 30 meters in indoor environments and 100 meters outdoors. By following a systematic approach, devising innovative architectures, and optimizing circuit performance, this work has confirmed the feasibility of ultra-low-power, autonomous and robust event-driven radios in low-cost and commercially available CMOS technologies.

A Raman spectroscopy instrument was selected for inclusion on the ExoMars mission because of its ability to assess the habitability and to search for evidence of life on Mars. Indeed Raman spectrometers have the capability to detect geological substances which are inorganic molecules and inorganic molecular ions constituting the rocky surface of Mars. Information on the nature of rocks present on the surface of Mars will provide information about the habitability of the planet. Besides the detection of geomarkers, Raman spectrometers have the ability to detecting potential biological-derivative substances, often referred to as biomarkers. These biomarkers are organic molecules originating from extent or extinct living organisms. In preparation for ExoMars, it is crucial to study the detection capability of miniaturized Raman spectrometers (specifically developed for space missions and therefore compromised by the associated challenging constraints such as minimal power budget, mass budget, data <b>budget</b> and overall <b>envelope)</b> on both lab synthetic samples and natural terrestrial analogues samples. We present here a systematic comparison of the capability of a number of Raman spectrometer designs/configurations to detect biomarkers in geological matrices that are relevant to the Martian surface and subsurface. In particular, we will compare spectral images recorded with benchtop instruments and a Raman Laser Spectrometer prototype developed at the University of Leicester to optimize/characterize the camera system that will be used for the ExoMars mission. Several parameters such as the excitation wavelength, the number of spectra recorded per sample and selection of optimal operating modes will be discussed. As an example, the habitability of desert varnish in the context of planetary exploration will be discussed in detail. Desert varnish are mineral coatings comprising clay, iron oxide and manganese oxide which are associated with living organisms in many stable extreme environment on Earth.

40|$|This {{report on}} the Observance of Standards and Codes on Paraguay {{examines}} the Fiscal Transparency Module. Paraguay has made important progress toward greater fiscal transparency. The fairly comprehensive financial administration law has been complemented by legal reforms that eliminated most tax exemptions, revamped revenue administration procedures, and introduced standardized transparency requirements for public procurement, all of which reduce the scope for corruption. The framework for public employment should be modernized to increase the role of merit-based transparent and objective criteria in the hiring, selection, and promotion procedures.

40|$|The Chilean {{government}} {{has succeeded in}} constructing and disseminating {{a clear view of}} its objectives and targets, both at the macroeconomic level and for individual budget programs. Government accountability to congress and the public is demonstrably being strengthened. A general reform challenge for Chile will be to institutionalize the many recent advances in transparency, so that they become permanent components of fiscal management. The flexibility inherent in such instruments as protocols and time-bound laws may contribute importantly to speedy and effective policy responses.

40|$|Debt {{relief and}} the scaling up {{of aid to}} low-income {{countries}} should allow for greater fiscal space for expenditure programs to create long-term growth and lower poverty rates. But designing a suitable medium-term fiscal framework that fosters a sustainable delivery of better public services and infrastructure while maintaining a credible commitment to fiscal prudence confronts many challenges. This paper discusses what low-income countries can do to shape fiscal policy frameworks that are ambitious in trying to absorb additional aid while still ensuring longer-term sustainability for government expenditure programs and finances. It suggests what approaches {{can be used to}} manage the greater fiscal policy risks associated with a scaled-up aid environment, including coordination with monetary policy. The paper also discusses what institutional changes are needed if donors and countries are to facilitate the implementation of a higher level of aid-financed spending programs.

40|$|Since dark silicon {{and the end}} of {{multicore}} scaling, multi/many-core system-on-a-chip (SoC) platform designs nowadays {{are facing}} some conﬂicting issues regarding product development. One is induced by increasing design complexity and another is induced by decreasing time-to-market. Hence, designers are seeking a more eﬃcient and reliable methodology in order to design complex multimillion gate SoC under such harsh conditions. In particular, the complexity of a generic pin control block in multimedia SoC which implements input/output (I/O) paths for oﬀ-chip communication has increased exponentially in recent years. Accordingly, the possibility of introducing human errors in designing such block has grown. Operation of generic-pin control block needs to be validated with a top-level RTL from the early stages of design, which correctly checks full-chip interface. However, generic-pin control block has inherent several design issues since function registers and multi-I/O paths are usually ﬁxed in the relatively late stages of design. Also, the role of a generic pin control block that shares limited pins causes frequent changes in pin assignment. Therefore, current design approaches of a generic pin control block are no longer adequate {{to meet the challenges of}} design productivity, design reusability, and shorter time-to-market for design. And, this results in many possible human errors when using a traditional RTL description. As a response to this problem, we developed a design automation based approach to reduce the possibility of human errors. In the case study presented, we succeeded in auto-generating a generic pin control block in multimedia SoC platforms which has more than 400 general purpose I/O interfaces including both input and output, as well as 1200 PAD pins. Ultimately, we reduced the amount of manual description for generating a generic pin control block by a whopping 98 %. The Overhead of Data Preparation (ODP) is very concerned in the future design of multi/many-core systems on the same chip. Therefore, we considered this issue under the extended Amdahl’s law and apply it to three “traditional” mult/many-core systems scenarios such as homogeneous symmetric, asymmetric, and dynamic. In addition, we expanded it toward two new scenarios spanning heterogeneous and dynamic CPU-GPU multi/many-core systems. Based on our evaluation, we found that potential innovations in heterogeneous system architecture are indispensable to decrease ODP. Furthermore, providing a solution of low power consumption and the trade oﬀ a small decrease in performance and throughput are the main challenges in designing future heterogeneous multi/many-core architecture on a single chip. Our design incorporates heterogeneous cores representing diﬀerent points in the power-performance design space during an applications execution. Under this circumstance, system software dynamically chooses the most appropriate core to meet speciﬁc performance and power requirements. As a response to this finding, we have presented a power-aware core management scheme through tightly-coupled hardware and software interaction: (1) heuristic thread consolidation scheme in software level, (2) 3 -bit core power control scheme in hardware level. It is based on eﬃcient methods of the core power management on heterogeneous multi/many-core architecture as a mechanism to reduce huge clock cycles as a latency when a core is powered down to up. Operation is based on distinct scenarios by 3 -bit core power control scheme through 5 statuses switching such as active, hot, cold, idle, and powered down. In addition, this kind of status switching is exactly triggered by referencing two information. One is the collected process ID information which is allocated by OS scheduler. Another is the decision information of heuristic thread consolidation scheme to maximize power-performance eﬃciency. Experiments prove that the power-performance efficiency of our model presented reduces power on average by 2. 3 % compared to a system with an efficient power-aware policy and by up to 15 % with respect to the basic policy. At the aspect of energy-eﬃciency on the same chip, we have proposed a performance-energy eﬃciency analytical model for the future integrated heterogeneous parallel multi/many-core systems which is promising to be used for big data applications. The model extends the traditional computing-centric model by considering ODP which can not be neglected in heterogenous multi/many-core systems anymore. The analysis has clearly shown that higher parallelism gained from either computation or data preparation brings greater energy-eﬃciency. Improving the performance-energy eﬃciency of data preparation is another promising approach to aﬀect power consumption. Therefore, more informed tradeoﬀs should be taken when we design a modern heterogeneous multi-many-core systems within limited <b>budget</b> of energy <b>envelope...</b>|$|R

The indices allow for benchmarking against the performance of middle-income countries, across regions, and according to different institutional arrangements that deliver good fiscal performance. Using the constructed indices, the paper provides preliminary empirical support for the hypotheses that strong budget institutions help improve fiscal balances and public external debt outcomes; and countries with stronger fiscal institutions have better scope to conduct countercyclical policies.
