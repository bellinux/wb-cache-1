5|$|A {{successful}} {{test for}} beryllium in air and on surfaces has been recently developed and published {{as an international}} voluntary consensus standard ASTM D7202. The procedure uses dilute ammonium <b>bifluoride</b> for dissolution and fluorescence detection with beryllium bound to sulfonated hydroxybenzoquinoline, allowing up to 100 times more sensitive detection than the recommended limit for beryllium concentration in the workplace. Fluorescence increases with increasing beryllium concentration. The new procedure has been successfully tested {{on a variety of}} surfaces and is effective for the dissolution and ultratrace detection of refractory beryllium oxide and siliceous beryllium (ASTM D7458).|$|E

25|$|French chemist Henri Moissan, {{formerly}} one of Frémy's students, {{continued the}} search. After trying many different approaches, he built on Frémy and Gore's earlier attempts by combining potassium <b>bifluoride</b> and hydrogen fluoride. The resultant solution conducted electricity. Moissan also constructed especially corrosion-resistant equipment: containers crafted from {{a mixture of}} platinum and iridium (more chemically resistant than pure platinum) with fluorite stoppers.|$|E
25|$|Edmond Frémy {{thought that}} passing {{electric}} current through pure hydrofluoric acid (dry HF) might work. Previously, hydrogen fluoride was only {{available in a}} water solution. Frémy therefore devised a method for producing dry hydrogen fluoride by acidifying potassium <b>bifluoride</b> (KHF2). Unfortunately, pure hydrogen fluoride did not pass an electric current. Frémy also tried electrolyzing molten calcium fluoride and probably produced some fluorine (since he made calcium metal at the other electrode), but {{he was unable to}} collect the gas.|$|E
25|$|The {{first attempt}} at {{trying to find the}} {{covalent}} radius of fluorine was in 1938, by Brockway. Brockway prepared a vapour of F2 molecules by means of the electrolysis of potassium <b>bifluoride</b> (KHF2) in a fluorine generator, which was constructed of Monel metal. Then, the product was passed over potassium fluoride so as to remove any hydrogen fluoride (HF) and to condense the product into a liquid. A sample was collected by evaporating the condensed liquid into a Pyrex flask. Finally, using electron diffraction, it was determined that the bond length between the two fluorine atoms was about 145pm. He therefore assumed that the covalent radius of fluorine was half this value, or 73pm. This value, however, is inaccurate due to the large electronegativity and small radius of fluorine atom.|$|E

500|$|Initial {{studies on}} {{fluorine}} were so dangerous that several 19th-century experimenters were deemed [...] "fluorine martyrs" [...] after misfortunes with hydrofluoric acid. Isolation of elemental fluorine was hindered by the extreme corrosiveness of both elemental fluorine itself and hydrogen fluoride, {{as well as}} the lack of a simple and suitable electrolyte. Edmond Frémy postulated that electrolysis of pure hydrogen fluoride to generate fluorine was feasible and devised a method to produce anhydrous samples from acidified potassium bifluoride; instead, he discovered that the resulting (dry) hydrogen fluoride did not conduct electricity. Frémy's former student Henri Moissan persevered, and after much trial and error found that a mixture of potassium <b>bifluoride</b> and dry hydrogen fluoride was a conductor, enabling electrolysis. To prevent rapid corrosion of the platinum in his electrochemical cells, he cooled the reaction to extremely low temperatures in a special bath and forged cells from a more resistant mixture of platinum and iridium, and used fluorite stoppers. In 1886, after 74 years of effort by many chemists, Moissan isolated elemental fluorine.|$|E
40|$|Data are {{presented}} on {{the properties of}} alkali metal and alkaline earth hydrofiuor-ides. Melting, thermal decomposition and interaction of hydrofluorides with various classes of inorganic substances are discussed.

30|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, wood-based {{composites}} have gained broad acceptance for constructional applications, and due to the depletion of the supply of high-quality wood, wood-based composites have been increasingly produced and utilized to replace solid wood. However, since their major component is solid wood, these composites require protection from decay fungi and wood-destroying insects if used in outdoor applications. It {{has been reported that}} these composites are experiencing failure due to the abovementioned biological agents [1 – 4]. Therefore, the durability of wood-based composites remains an important factor for increasing the service life of these composites in challenging environments. Amongst the various pre-treatment or post-treatment techniques, the in-line (or in-process) treatment, which incorporates the biocide during the manufacturing process, has become the method of choice for particleboard and other composites with relatively small particle or fiber size [5, 6]. Compared to the other methods, in-line treatment provides several advantages, including full protection of the composite cross-section and the ability to cut or drill the composite at any time without applying remedial treatments. In recent years, several biocides such as zinc borate, boric acid and permethrin have been utilized for the in-process treatment of particleboards and medium-density fiberboards (MDFs) [7 – 10]. Sodium fluoride (NaF) has been used effectively for many years in Europe and the USA as a registered wood preservative chemical for solid wood applications (e.g., railroad ties and utility poles) against wood decaying fungi and subterranean termites. In Australia and USA fluoride rods (e.g., flurods, 98 % sodium fluoride, Osmose Utilities Services, Inc.) were used as internal remedial treatments in utility poles [11, 12]. It is not very soluble in water but has poor resistance to leaching. The first multi-salt preservative chemical was patented by Dr. Wolman in Germany and consisted of sodium fluoride (85 %), dinitrophenol (10 %) and sodium dichromate (5 %) known as Triolith [13, 14]. Because their high efficacy against decay fungi, fluorides became an important wood preservatives in initial and remedial treatments due to their ability to diffuse via free water through refractory wood species [15]. <b>Bifluorides</b> were also used as wood preservatives in Germany against decay fungi and some insect species especially European House Borer, Hylotrupes bajulus (L.). As the previous literature mostly deals with biological performance of NaF or other fluoride salt treated solid wood, the current study focuses on NaF treatment of wood-based composites via in-line treatment. Additionally, NaF is an incombustible, colorless, odorless, non-corrosive crystalline solid or powder with very high melting (993  °C) and boiling (1704  °C) temperatures, which makes it suitable for high-temperature manufacturing processes such as hot pressing or extrusion. As a medication, it is primarily used to prevent tooth decay and osteoporosis in humans [16]. Thus, as a biocide, it might be considered as having a minimal environmental impact with low mammalian toxicity when compared to others. However, the efficacy of NaF against wood decay fungi and termites in wood-based composite production is poorly documented and requires further investigation. The objectives of this paper were to evaluate the feasibility of sodium fluoride (NaF) as a biocide for in-line treatment during the manufacture of particleboard and to investigate its efficacy, leachability and effects on physical and mechanical properties.|$|R

2500|$|Unlike other hydrohalic acids, such as {{hydrochloric}} acid, {{hydrogen fluoride}} {{is only a}} weak acid in dilute aqueous solution.

At high concentrations, HF molecules undergo homoassociation to form polyatomic ions (such as <b>bifluoride,</b> [...] ) and protons, thus greatly increasing the acidity. This leads to protonation of very strong acids like hydrochloric, sulfuric, or nitric when using concentrated hydrofluoric acid solutions. Although hydrofluoric acid is regarded as a weak acid, it is very corrosive, even attacking glass when hydrated.|$|E
