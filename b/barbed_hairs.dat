2500|$|Urticating hairs or urticating bristles, i.e. irritating hairs, {{are one of}} {{the primary}} defense {{mechanisms}} used by numerous plants, almost all New World tarantulas, and various lepidopteran caterpillars. [...] Urtica is Latin for [...] "nettle" [...] (stinging nettles are in the genus Urtica), and hairs that urticate are characteristic of this type of plant, and many other plants in several families. [...] This term also refers to certain types of <b>barbed</b> <b>hairs</b> that cover the dorsal and posterior surface of a tarantula's or caterpillar's abdomen. [...] Many tarantula species eject hairs from their abdomens, directing them toward potential attackers. [...] These hairs can embed themselves in the other animal's skin or eyes, causing physical irritation, usually to great discomfort.|$|E
60|$|There are {{two ways}} in which animals may be {{employed}} to disperse seeds--voluntarily and involuntarily. They may be compelled to carry them against their wills: {{or they may be}} bribed and cajoled and flattered into doing the plant's work for it in return for some substantial advantage or benefit the plant confers upon them. The first plan is the one adopted by burrs and cleavers. These adhesive fruits are like the man who buttonholes you and won't be shaken off: they are provided with little curved hooks or bent and <b>barbed</b> <b>hairs</b> which catch upon the wool of sheep, the coat of cattle, or the nether integuments of wayfaring humanity, and can't be got rid of without some little difficulty. Most of them, you will find on examination, belonged to confirmed hedgerow or woodside plants: they grow among bushes or low scrub, and thickets of gorse or bramble. Now, to such plants as these, it is obviously useful to have adhesive fruits and seeds: for when sheep or other animals get them caught in their coats, they carry them away to other bushy spots, and there, {{to get rid of the}} annoyance caused by the foreign body, scratch them off at once against some holly-bush or blackthorn. You may often find seeds of this type sticking on thorns as the nucleus of a little matted mass of wool, so left by the sheep in the very spots best adapted for the free growth of their vigorous seedlings.|$|E

40|$|A hair-trapping {{survey was}} carried out in the western River Po plain (NW Italy). We aimed to test whether <b>barbed</b> wire <b>hair</b> snares in {{combination}} with DNA profiling might represent an effective tool to study a low-density badger population. Traps were placed above the entrances of twelve badger setts between 15 February and 30 April 2010. Trapping effort was expressed as the number of trap-nights required to pluck a hair sample and the trend in the number of genotyped individual over time was analysed by regression analysis. Forty-three hair samples were collected, with an overall trapping effort of 54. 8 trap-nights per one hair sample. Twenty-eight samples yielded reliable genotypes, allowing the identification of nine individual badgers. The length of storage period (1 - 3 months) before DNA extraction did not seem to affect genotyping success. According to the regression model, trapping effort allowed to sample 75 % of the overall population. Our results suggest that the efficacy of passive devices is affected by population density...|$|R

40|$|International audienceReliable {{estimation}} of population size remains {{a major challenge}} in wildlife ecology and management. Lately, genotyping of non-invasively obtained tissue samples integrated in a modified capture–recapture approach provides new perspectives. Faeces, moulted feathers, or hairs can be easily sampled in the field. However, an important assumption is homogeneity of sampling across the population. In this pilot study, we tested the suitability of baited <b>barbed</b> wire <b>hair</b> sampling stations (‘hair traps') for homogeneous genetic sampling for population estimation. A video system based on a new network internet protocol was used to observe the behaviour of wild boar visiting baited hair traps for gaining information about potential heterogeneities in the individual sampling probability. Within 92 monitoring nights at two sampling stations, 216 wild boar visits were recorded and 142 hair samples containing 2, 124 single hairs were collected. Video analysis revealed distinct differences in the behaviour of wild boar {{with respect to the}} sampling station which are most likely to result in heterogeneous individual sampling probabilities. Adult and subadult animals differed in their behaviour dependent on their group status. This result indicates that hair sampling with baited hair traps is not suitable for representative non-invasive sampling of free ranging wild boar populations...|$|R

40|$|The {{section of}} the Trans-Canada Highway (TCH) that bisects Banff National Park, Alberta {{supports}} the highest volume of traffic of any road in the North American national park system and is recognized as an important stressor to the ecological integrity of the central Canadian Rockies. Wide-ranging carnivores, such as grizzly (Ursus arctos) and black bears (U. americanus), are particularly vulnerable to road mortality and habitat fragmentation caused by roads. In order to mitigate these negative impacts on wildlife, twenty-four crossing structures have been constructed across the TCH. Over a decade of intensive study of these wildlife crossings has shown they reduce mortality and maintain wildlife movements. Track pads have recorded both bear species crossing the TCH on 1389 occasions, {{but the number of}} different individuals using the crossings, their genders and the demographic and genetic benefits of the crossings for populations remain unknown. In 2004 and 2005, a pilot study was conducted at two of the crossing structures to evaluate the feasibility of using a <b>barbed</b> wire <b>hair</b> sampling system to determine the number of individual male and female grizzly and black bears pass¬ing through the crossings. Based on the results of that pilot study, a three-year research project was initiated in 2006 to evaluate the conservation benefits of wildlife crossing structures for grizzly and black bear populations in the Bow Valley of Banff National Park. The hair sampling system was installed at 22 of 24 of the crossing structures to deter¬mine the total number of male and female bears using the crossings and the populations of grizzly and black bears in the Bow Valley surrounding the TCH were also sampled using a combination of hair snares and rub tree surveys. The genetic information derived from the hair samples will be used to: assess the effectiveness of different types of crossing structures, estimate the population sizes for both bear species in the Bow Valley, calculate the proportion of the population using the crossings and quantify the level of movement and gene flow across the TCH. This poster highlights our research objectives and presents some of the preliminary results from the 2006 field season. 12 grizzly bears (7 males, 5 females) and 11 black bears (7 males, 4 females) were identified from the samples collected at the crossing structures and 40 black bears (16 males, 24 females) and sixty-three grizzlies (37 males, 26 females) were identified from the samples collected from the hair snares and rub trees. These data will be analyzed using a combination of population viability analysis and landscape genetics approaches to assess the demographic and genetic benefits of wildlife crossings for bear populations in the Bow Valley. Wildlife crossings are gaining recognition as an effective method for reducing road-caused mortality and maintaining wildlife movement, but the conservation benefits of crossings for bears at the population-level has yet to be evaluated...|$|R

5000|$|Lychnis flos-cuculi forms a rosette of low growing foliage with {{numerous}} flower stems 20 to 90 cm tall. The stems {{rise above the}} foliage and branch {{near the top of}} the stem and end with the pink flowers which are 3-4 cm across. The flowers have five narrow petals deeply divided into four lobes giving the flower an untidy, ragged appearance, hence its common name. The [...] calyx tube is five-toothed with ten stamens. The leaves are paired, with the lower leaves spoon-shaped and stalked. The middle and upper leaves are linear-lanceolate with pointed apexes. All of the leaves are untoothed. The stems have <b>barbed</b> <b>hairs</b> pointing downward and these hairs make the plant rough to the touch. Ragged Robins bloom from May to August, occasionally later, and butterflies and long-tongued bees feed on the flowers nectar. Nevertheless, the flowers are visited by many types of insects, and can be characterized by a generalized pollination syndrome.

50|$|The flower {{heads are}} set {{individually}} {{at the tip}} of short side-branches and have both marginal and disk florets, which are both fertile and have cream-colored corollas. The involucre surrounding the flower head is initially egg-shaped, but becomes bell-shaped when flowering and during the development of the fruits. The bracts that form the involucre (called phyllaries) stand in three worls. Those on the outside are about 3 mm long and 1¾ mm wide, oval in shape with a pointy or gradually narrowing tip, and softly hairy on the outside. The inner phyllaries are about 8 mm long and 2—2¼ mm wide, and do not reach beyond the top of the cypselas. The corollas of the five to six marginal florets per head are 16-17 mm long. Three of its lobes have merged to a lip (or ligule) of about 1 cm long and 1¼—1½ mm wide, with three teeth at the tip, while the two remaining lobes are only merged at the foot, each ⅓—½ mm wide and about 1 cm long, but measuring is difficult because they are coiled-up. The five or six disc florets have slightly shorter corollas of about 15 mm long, are formed like a tube, have five lobes of about 7½ mm long, which are also coiled, and without hair at their tips. As in all Asteraceae, the anthers are merged over their length to form a tube, through which the style grows, while gathering pollen from the anthers that have opened at the inside of the tube. The cream-colored anthers are pointy at their tip, and carry two, about 3¼ mm long, woolly haired tails at their foot, which are free from the filament. The yellow style is rounded at the tip and is rough on the outside lower than the split and the branches are about ⅓ mm long. The indehiscent, one-seeded fruits (called cypsela) are green when growing and brown when ripe, narrowly inverted cone-shaped, covered in bristles of twin hairs, with on top the calyx that has changed to <b>barbed</b> <b>hairs,</b> plume-like towards the tip, and is called pappus. The pappus is initially wrapped tightly around the corolla, and so allowing access of light to the cypselas, but is later spreading, to create better lift for the ripe fruit. The pollen is approximately globular (50×45 μm), has three very wide furrows and has a pattern of very small spines and ridges.|$|E
