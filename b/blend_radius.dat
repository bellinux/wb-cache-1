Three forms of intersection between the crosshole and main bore are considered: plain, chamfered and blend radiused. The minimum SCF {{was found to}} occur for the plain intersection configuration, with the peak stress at the crotch corner between the main bore and crosshole on the longitudinal plane of symmetry. Incorporating a chamfer or <b>blend</b> <b>radius</b> at the intersection reduces the {{stress concentration}} at the main bore but introduces higher peak stress elsewhere in the chamfer or blend region...|$|E

For the amplitude of THz radiation pulse {{is proportional to the}} local electric field in the gap, the increased max-imum bias electric field by blending tips is able to achieve higher THz radiation power. Both considering the influence to the maximum bias electric field and the emission efficiency, the <b>blend</b> <b>radius</b> of the rect-angular tips is suggest to be larger than 5 µm and the radiation power is largely enhanced. Comparing to the previous work, our method has better THz radiation performance. 1...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} compact {{functions for}} peak stresses and stress decay distributions due to circular arc blend repairs, on circular holes in uniaxially loaded plates. Key geometric parameters are varied, focusing on relatively shallow blends, {{consistent with the}} in-service repair of fatigue cracking in ageing airframes. The highly accurate stress results are obtained using adaptive p–version finite element analyses. In the 2 D cases, both single and double sided repairs are considered, where the blend consists of either a single or multi-arcs. For the 3 D analyses, {{the focus is on}} blends to repair corner cracks at the hole edge. It is found that in all cases, the peak stress can be significantly reduced by maximising the ratio of <b>blend</b> <b>radius</b> to hole radius, thereby lowering the possibility of recracking. The multi-arc case offers the greatest stress reduction. The stress decay functions presented can be used to obtain stress intensity factors for the fatigue analysis of cracks which may re-initiate at the blends...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Aerospace EngineeringAortocoronary bypass (ACB) {{surgery is}} a {{treatment}} to bypass a blocked artery using a graft. Approximately 500, 000 bypass surgeries are {{performed in the}} U. S. each year. Of these, about 15 % to 20 % have an early-phase failure, typically in the proximal region. A natural question which arises is whether fluid dynamic geometry {{plays a role in}} the patency. Since only a few studies have considered proximal region geometry, this motivates the present study. Blood flow in a coronary artery bypass often involves very complex fluid dynamic behavior. Numerical simulation is employed to investigate the flow field environment of the proximal region of a bypass. A series of different branching models with laminar inflow are considered to systematically investigate the geometrical effect under different flow conditions. Model types (with branch diameter to host diameter ratio D 2 /D 1 < 1, with or without blend at the junction) include T-junction and host to branch junction with a radius of curvature with and without helical pitch. Some flow conditions included non-Newtonian blood and non-steady flow. Non-blended T-junction is subjected to flow separation at the inner wall of the branch unless the flow rate ratio (̇ 2 /̇ 1) is high and D 2 is small. By employing a <b>blend</b> <b>radius</b> at the T-junction, there is a critical flow rate ratio where separation near the inner wall of the junction can be diminished under steady state flow condition. This parameter is known as (̇ 2 /̇ 1) crit. Given a blended T-junction, there is a common branch radius rB which corresponds to (̇ 2 /̇ 1) crit,min that gives the minimum separation scale under steady state flow condition or delays the onset of separation under non-steady flow conditions. This parameter was found to be independent of Re. A geometric correlation that corresponds to non-separated flow in blended T-junction was developed and can be expressed as rB = 0. 146 D 21. 74. This correlation is independent to flow rate ratio...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} for {{smoothly}} connecting different patches on triangle meshes with arbitrary connectivity, called mesh blending, is presented. A major feature of mesh blending {{is to move}} vertices of the blending region to a virtual blending surface by choosing an appropriate parameterization of those vertices. Once blending is completed, the parameterization optimization is performed to perfect the final meshes. Combining mesh blending with multiresolution techniques, an effective blending technique for meshes is obtained. Our method has several advantages: (1) the user can intuitively control the blending result using different <b>blending</b> <b>radii,</b> (2) the shape of crosssection curves can be adjusted to flexibly design complex models, and (3) the resulting mesh has the same connectivity as the original mesh.

40|$|Solid models {{may be blended}} through {{filleting}} or rounding {{operations that}} typically replace the vicinity of concave or convex edges by blends that smoothly connect {{to the rest of}} the solid’s boundary. Circular blends, which are popular in manufacturing, are each the subset of a canal surface that bounds the region swept by a ball of constant or varying radius as it rolls on the solid while maintaining two tangential contacts. We propose to use a second solid to control the radius variation. This new formulation supports global blending (simultaneous rounding and filleting) operations and yields a simple set-theoretic formulation of the relative blending RB(A) of a solid A given a control solid B. We propose user-interface options, describe practical implementations, and show results in 2 and 3 dimensions. Key words: <b>blends,</b> variable <b>radius</b> <b>blending</b> 1...|$|R
40|$|Solid models may be rounded through {{filleting}} or blending operations. In 3 D, {{the faces}} created by rounding are {{portions of the}} canal surface bounding the region swept by a ball (of constant or varying radius) as the ball rolls on (i. e., moves while maintaining tangential contact with) the two solids. Procedural or algebraic definitions of how the radius of the ball varies as it rolls may prove challenging, for instance when the two faces do not intersect. We propose to control the radius using a second solid in 3 D or a curve in 2 D. Specifically, we propose a set-theoretic formulation of the relative rounding RB(A) of solid A given a control solid B.

40|$|AbstractDuring airbag production, {{many parts}} are {{obtained}} by plastic deformation {{such as the}} lid of the gas generator. Since the airbag gas generator is a significant vehicle safety part, several pressure tests have been developed in order to prove the reliability of this product. A ductile fracture problem initialized by a localization of the deformation is observed along the <b>blending</b> <b>radius.</b> In order to understand the mechanical processes involved in the forming operation, a numerical and experimental study was developed.  A tensile test specimen extracted from the sheet of study, undergoes elastic deformation that is followed by a transition to plastic deformation. Although during this stage of the test the deformation is stable, the strains begin to localize within a relatively broad zone known as diffuse necking. The stable deformation, with continuously rising load, is followed by the instability whereby a local neck or shear band is produced due to strong localization of deformation. The localization is explainable by the inhomogeneity in macroscopic material properties in the specimen. The necking behavior is a vital precursor to the final failure. A Digital Image Correlation (DIC) method is used in 2 D and 3 D to evaluate the necking and localization of deformation, which shows clearly the two stage of necking phenomena. Moreover, a numerical modeling was developed of tensile test under ABAQUS commercial software. In this model we use Gurson Tvergaard Needleman (GTN) ductile model of damage to predict the necking phenomenon. Furthermore the results from FE simulations are compared with experimental results from uniaxial tensile tests. Finally we develop the numerical model of {{the lid of the}} gas generator obtained by forming process...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} closed access. This paper {{describes}} progress in {{research into the}} development of a computer-aided design (CAD) tool that aids designers in generating the form of a product by the use of evolutionary techniques. Genetic algorithm (GA) software has been developed and combined with a commercial CAD solid modelling system. The system creates objects that initially have the appearance of being random in form, but which can be subjected to a user-directed selective breeding programme which is also guided by pre-set internal, or environmental, factors. User scoring of each object, or an objective function, determines which objects are considered to be the ‘fittest’, and thus likely to become parents of the next generation. Through the co-operation of the user and the pre-set environmental factors, the forms on the screen progressively become more than an abstract collection of geometric primitives. It is believed that this can provide useful inspiration with regard to the aesthetics and functional characteristics of products, and the potential exists for this approach to be the basis of a new design methodology. Early work demonstrated that the software had the ability to evolve interesting shapes in line with a user’s particular criteria for rating objects. However, it was also obvious that the objects generated needed enhancement to convincingly represent some of the geometric complexities of real products. Using the CAD software’s blend function within the evolutionary process has provided that complexity, producing excellent results and greatly widening the field of application. In addition to simply creating secondary geometry through the smoothening of sharp edges or creation of curved fillets between adjoining solids, more significant and complex primary geometric forms have been generated by allowing relatively large <b>blend</b> <b>radii.</b> The current challenge is to combine the existing ability to predictably evolve simple geometric shapes, with the added complexity arising from the use of blends, to make the concept genuinely useful. The outcome of genetic manipulation needs to be predictable, to the extent that desirable features from objects are reproduced in subsequent generations. The key to this is the way the genetic shape defining data is stored and processed, especially the way the blend instructions are integrated into the existing genetic structure, and this is the major focus of continuing research...|$|R

40|$|Blend {{recognition}} and suppression from a tessellated model {{is important in}} applications such as model simplification in analysis and collaborative design where tessellated models are being used. This {{could also be used}} to pre-process the model before attempting to recognize form features in it. A procedure is described for recognizing and subsequently suppressing blends (fillets/rounds) in a tessellated model of a part. Earlier efforts on recognizing secondary features such as blends have used the boundary representation (B-Rep) of the part as input. Blend {{recognition and}} suppression from a tessellated model has not been addressed {{to the best of our}} knowledge. There has been work reported on the related problem of segmentation of tessellated surfaces. Segmentation refers to the decomposition of the object into regions where the underlying surfaces having similar characteristics. The segmented surface may be of any of surface like plane surface. There are two broad approaches to segmentation - vertex-based and edge-based. The vertex-based method clusters triangles consisting of connected vertices having the same attribute. One drawback of this method is that the boundaries of the clustered regions are not clearly defined due to difference in the labels of contiguous vertices. The edge-based method is based upon the dihedral angle at each edge in the tessellated model. The main drawback of this method is that edges in the boundary of the segmented patches are disconnected. This will result in an incomplete bounding loop when used for recognizing features. Smooth transitions at the boundary of features cannot be trapped with this approach. These techniques cannot be therefore used for recognizing blends. There have been efforts to recognize and suppress blends in a B-Rep model. Suppressing blend features in a B-Rep model is easier (compared to suppression from tessellated model) because smooth edges provide a clue to presence of blends. In the case of a tessellated model, the bounding loop of blends will not consist of smooth edges and no explicit signature is available for blends. In B-Rep model, information about the <b>radius</b> of <b>blend</b> is also available while this is not directly available in a tessellated model. Constant <b>radius</b> <b>blends</b> meet the requirements of most blending features encountered in mechanical part design. The surfaces forming a constant <b>radius</b> <b>blend</b> may be classified as cylindrical, spherical and toroidal surfaces. Spherical blend is formed by a blending operation at a vertex at which either three concave linear edges or three convex linear edges are incident. Blending operation on a linear edge forms cylindrical blend. Toroidal blend is formed by a blending operation on a circular edge. This circular edge may be closed (end vertices are identical) or open. Toroidal blend is also formed at a vertex at which at least one convex and one concave edge is incident. So toroidal blend can be classified into closed toroidal blend, open toroidal blend and vertex toroidal blend. In recognition process, for every triangle, cylindrical, spherical and toroidal surface parameters are calculated. In the second step, triangles having same surface parameters are clustered. The cluster of triangles are then classified as a blend or a form feature. Finally, toroidal blends are classified as one of the three types of toroidal blend. Procedures for the suppression of edge cylindrical blend and edge toroidal blend are described. At the present time, vertex blends are not suppressed individually. Rather in the process of suppressing edge blends, vertex blends are also suppressed. The parent surfaces that were blended are identified using the bounding loops of the blends. Triangles in the blend are then deleted and the parent surfaces are extended to suppress the feature. The key issues in suppression are - identification of all the surfaces at the blend, identification of the entities that were blended (edges and vertices) and updating the tessellated model. Results of constant <b>radius</b> <b>blend</b> recognition and suppression, on benchmark parts from NIST design repository are presented. This is followed by a discussion on the correctness of the recognition procedures. The thesis concludes by summarizing the contributions and identifies the following are as recognition of variable <b>radius</b> <b>blends,</b> blends on non-linear surfaces, suppression of all small volumetric feature as areas for further research...|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{is a continuation}} of the experimental and theoretical evaluation of blended wing-body combinations. The basic diamond, delta, and arrow plan forms which had an aspect ratio of 2 with leading-edge sweeps of 45. 00 deg., 59. 04 deg., and 70. 82 deg. and trailing edge of - 45. 00 deg., - 18. 43 deg., and 41. 19 deg., respectively, are used herein as standards for evaluating the effects of camber and warp. The wing thickness distributions were computed by varying the section shape along with the body <b>radii</b> (<b>blending</b> process) to match the prescribed area distribution and wing plan form. The wing camber and warp were computed to try to obtain nearly elliptical spanwise and chordwise load distributions for each plan form and thus to obtain low drag due to lift for a range of Mach numbers for which the velocities normal to the wing leading edge are subsonic. Elliptical chordwise load distributions were not possible for the plan forms and design conditions selected, so these distributions were somewhat different for each plan form. The models were tested with transition fixed at Mach numbers from 0. 60 to 3. 50 and at Reynolds numbers, based on the mean aerodynamic chord of the wing, of roughly 4, 000, 000 to 9, 000, 000. At speeds where the velocities normal to the wing leading edges were supersonic, an increase in the experimental wave-drag coefficients due to camber and twist was evident, but this penalty decreased with increased sweep. Thus the minimum wave-drag coefficients for the cambered arrow model were almost identical with the zero-lift wave- drag coefficients for the uncambered arrow model at all test Mach numbers...|$|R
40|$|A {{diamond wing}} and body {{combination}} {{was designed to}} have an area distribution which would result in near optimum zero-lift wave-drag coefficients at a Mach number of 1. 00, and decreasing wave-drag coefficient with increasing Mach number up to near sonic leading-edge conditions for the wing. The airfoil section were computed by varying their shape along with the body <b>radii</b> (<b>blending</b> process) to match the selected area distribution and the given plan form. The exposed wing section had an average maximum thickness of about 3 percent of the local chords, and the maximum thickness of the center-line chord was 5. 49 percent. The wing had an aspect ratio of 2 and a leading-edge sweep of 45 deg. Test data were obtained throughout the Mach number range from 0. 20 to 3. 50 at Reynolds numbers based on the mean aerodynamic chord of roughly 6, 000, 000 to 9, 000, 000. The zero-lift wave-drag coefficients of the diamond model satisfied the design objectives and were equal to the low values for the Mach number 1. 00 equivalent body up to the limit of the transonic tests. From the peak drag coefficient near M = 1. 00 there was a gradual decrease in wave-drag coefficient up to M = 1. 20. Above sonic leading-edge conditions of the wing there was {{a rise in the}} wave-drag coefficient which was attributed in part to the body contouring {{as well as to the}} wing geometry. The diamond model had good lift characteristics, in spite of the prediction from low-aspect-ratio theory that the rear half of the diamond wing would carry little lift. The experimental lift-curve slope obtained at supersonic speeds were equal to or greater than the values predicted by linear theory. Similarly the other basic aerodynamic parameters, aerodynamic center position, and maximum lift-drag ratios were satisfactorily predicted at supersonic speeds...|$|R
40|$|The models had aspect-ratio- 2 diamond, delta, {{and arrow}} wings with the leading edges swept 45. 00 deg, 59. 04 deg, and 70. 82 deg, respectively. The wing {{sections}} were computed by varying the section shape {{along with the}} body <b>radii</b> (<b>blending</b> process) to match the prescribed area distribution and wing plan form. The wing sections had an average value of maximum thickness ratio of about 4 percent of the local chords in a streamwise direction. The models were tested with transition fixed at Reynolds numbers of about 4, 000, 000 to 9, 000, 0000, based on the mean aerodynamic chord of the wings. The effect of varying Reynolds number was checked at both subsonic and supersonic speeds. The diamond model was superior to the other plan forms at transonic speeds ((L/D) max = 11. 00 to 9. 52) because of its higher lift-curve slope and near optimum wave drag due to the blending process. For the wing thickness tested with the diamond model, the marked body and wing contouring required for transonic conditions resulted in a large wave-drag penalty at the higher supersonic Mach numbers where the {{leading and trailing edges}} of the wing were supersonic. Because of the low sweep of the trailing edge of the delta model, this configuration was less adaptable to the blending process. Removing a body bump prescribed by the Mach number 1. 00 design resulted in a good supersonic design. This delta model with 10 percent less volume was superior to the other plan forms at Mach numbers of 1. 55 to 2. 35 ((L/D) max = 8. 65 to 7. 24), but it and the arrow model were equally good at Mach numbers of 2. 50 to 3. 50 ((L/D) max - 6. 85 to O. 39). At transonic speeds the arrow model was inferior because of the reduced lift-curve slope associated with its increased sweep and also because of the wing base drag. The wing base-drag coefficients of the arrow model based on the wing planform area decreased from a peak value of 0. 0029 at Mach number 1. 55 to 0. 0003 at Mach number 3. 50. Linear supersonic theory was satisfactory for predicting the aerodynamic trends at Mach numbers from 1. 55 to 3. 50 of lift-curve slope, wave drag, drag due to lift, aerodynamic-center location, and maximum lift-drag ratios for each of the models...|$|R
