5000|$|Tone {{letters are}} often transliterated into numerals, {{particularly}} in Asian and Mesoamerican tone languages. Until {{the spread of}} OpenType computer fonts starting in 2000-2001, tone letters were not practical for many applications. A numerical substitute has been commonly used for tone contours, with a numerical value assigned to the <b>beginning,</b> <b>end,</b> and sometimes middle of the contour. For example, the four Mandarin tones are commonly transcribed as [...] "ma55", [...] "ma35", [...] "ma214", [...] "ma51".|$|E

[...] The expression [...] "Alpha and Omega" [...] also used as title of God in Book of Revelation. God's eternity {{may be seen as}} an aspect of his infinity, discussed below.|$|E

50|$|A total {{solar eclipse}} {{occurred}} on October 3, 1986. It was a hybrid event (normally, an eclipse which is annular {{for most of}} its duration, but with totality either at the <b>beginning,</b> <b>end</b> or at sometime during the eclipse) that did not officially satisfy the definition of totality. Totality occurred for a very short time (calculated at 0.2 seconds) in an area in the Atlantic Ocean, just east of the southern tip of Greenland. The path, {{on the surface of the}} Earth, was a narrow, tapered, horse-shoe, and visible only from a thin strip between Iceland and Greenland. At maximum eclipse the solar elevation was about 6°.|$|E
50|$|In March 1944 the {{building}} of the bunker Hornisse (engl. Hornet) was started near the shipyard. It was intended, protected from air attacks, to produce u-boats sections therein. These prefabricated sections then were shipped to the u-boat pen Valentin about 30 km downstream the river Weser. Together with parts from Kriegsmarinewerft Wilhelmshaven and under management of Bremer Vulkan <b>beginning</b> <b>end</b> of 1945 monthly 3 u-boats should be completed there. Both bunkers had never been finished and never u-boats had been built there. The bunker Valentin is still existing today and partly used as a memorial to the many prisoners and forced labourers who worked and died there.|$|E
50|$|During the war about 10 km {{downstream}} from the BV-shipyard between the Bremen suburbs Rekum and Farge the submarine bunker Valentin was under construction. Here under {{management of the}} BV and <b>beginning</b> <b>end</b> of 1945 monthly 15 u-boats should be assembled from prefabricated sections. Those were delivered from the following shipyards Bremer Vulkan AG, Deschimag AG Weser in Bremen, Deschimag Seebeck AG in Bremerhaven and Blohm + Voß in Hamburg. However, the bunker was not finished {{before the end of}} the war and no u-boats were ever built there. The building itself still exists today and is partly used as a memorial to the many forced labourers from nearby concentration camps who worked and died there during construction of the bunker.|$|E
