40|$|According to a Web {{usability}} study [1] by the Georgia Institute of Technology, net use rs rate broken hyperlinks as the second-biggest problem online, {{right behind}} slow-loading pages. The problem of broken hyperlinks (or dead links) {{is a common}} problem within enterprise websites comprising {{hundreds or thousands of}} interconnected web pages that are continuously modified and updated [2]. Broken links can occur due to many reasons such as file rename, delete or path modification, which are likely events within enterprises. Many commercial tools were developed to deal with this problem [3][4]. In this paper, we present a novel architecture for linking web pages following the NaSr style [5] that provides a potential solution for the <b>broken</b> <b>hyperlink</b> problem...|$|E

40|$|We present two magnetometry-based methods {{suitable}} for assessing gradients {{in the critical}} temperature and hence the composition of multifilamentary superconductors: AC magnetometry and Scanning Hall Probe Microscopy. The novelty of the former technique lies in the iterative evaluation procedure we developed, whereas {{the strength of the}} latter is the direct visualization of the temperature dependent penetration of a magnetic field into the superconductor. Using the example of a PIT Nb 3 Sn wire, we demonstrate the application of these techniques, and compare the respective results {{to each other and to}} EDX measurements of the Sn distribution within the sub-elements of the wire.
