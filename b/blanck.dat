500|$|Recognition by the U.S. federal {{government}} was a key goal of the osteopathic medical profession {{in its effort to}} establish equivalency with its M.D. counterparts. Between 1916 and 1966, the profession engaged in a [...] "long and tortuous struggle" [...] for the right to serve as physicians and surgeons in the U.S. Military Medical Corps. On May 3, 1966 Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara authorized the acceptance of osteopathic physicians into all the medical military services on the same basis as MDs. The first osteopathic physician to take the oath of office to serve as a military physician was Harry J. Walter. The acceptance of osteopathic physicians was further solidified in 1996 when Ronald <b>Blanck,</b> DO was appointed to serve as Surgeon General of the Army, the only osteopathic physician to hold the post.|$|E

2500|$|The company's owners, Max <b>Blanck</b> and Isaac Harris, {{who survived}} the fire by fleeing to the building's roof when the fire began, were indicted on charges of first- and second-degree {{manslaughter}} in mid-April; the pair's trial began on December 4, 1911. Max Steuer, counsel for the defendants, managed to destroy the credibility {{of one of the}} survivors, Kate Alterman, by asking her to repeat her testimony a number of times, which she did without altering key phrases. Steuer argued to the jury that Alterman and possibly other witnesses had memorized their statements, and might even have been told what to say by the prosecutors. The prosecution charged that the owners knew the exit doors were locked at the time in question. The investigation found that the locks were intended to be locked during working hours based on the findings from the fire, but the defense stressed that the prosecution failed to prove that the owners knew that. The jury acquitted the two men of first- and second-degree manslaughter, but they were found liable of wrongful death during a subsequent civil suit in 1913 in which plaintiffs were awarded compensation in the amount of $75 per deceased victim. The insurance company paid <b>Blanck</b> and Harris about $60,000 more than the reported losses, or about $400 per casualty.|$|E
2500|$|The Triangle Waist Company factory {{occupied}} the eighth, ninth, and tenth {{floors of the}} 10-story Asch Building on {{the northwest corner of}} Greene Street and Washington Place, just east of Washington Square Park, in the Greenwich Village area of New York City. Under the ownership of Max <b>Blanck</b> and Isaac Harris, the factory produced women's blouses, known as [...] "shirtwaists." [...] The factory normally employed about 500 workers, mostly young immigrant women, who worked nine hours a day on weekdays plus seven hours on Saturdays, earning for their 52 hours of work between $7 and $12 a week, the equivalent of $171 to $293 a week in 2016 currency, or $3.20 to $5.50 per hour.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the workday}} was ending on the {{afternoon}} of Saturday, March 25, 1911, a fire flared up at approximately 4:40 PM in a scrap bin under one of the cutter's tables at the northeast corner of the eighth floor. The first fire alarm was sent at 4:45 PM by a passerby on Washington Place who saw smoke coming from the eighth floor. Both owners of the factory were in attendance and had invited their children to the factory on that afternoon. The Fire Marshal concluded that the likely cause of the fire was the disposal of an unextinguished match or cigarette butt in the scrap bin, which held two months' worth of accumulated cuttings {{by the time of the}} fire. Beneath the table in the wooden bin were hundreds of pounds of scraps which were left over from the several thousand shirtwaists that had been cut at that table. The scraps piled up from the last time the bin was emptied, coupled with the hanging fabrics that surrounded it; the steel trim was the only thing that was not highly flammable. Although smoking was banned in the factory, cutters were known to sneak cigarettes, exhaling the smoke through their lapels to avoid detection. A New York Times article suggested that the fire may have been started by the engines running the sewing machines. A series of articles in Collier's noted a pattern of arson among certain sectors of the garment industry whenever their particular product fell out of fashion or had excess inventory in order to collect insurance. The Insurance Monitor, a leading industry journal, observed that shirtwaists had recently fallen out of fashion, and that insurance for manufacturers of them was [...] "fairly saturated with moral hazard." [...] Although <b>Blanck</b> and Harris were known for having had four previous suspicious fires at their companies, arson was not suspected in this case.|$|E
