5|$|Boron {{is found}} in nature on Earth entirely as various oxides of B(III), often {{associated}} with other elements. More than one hundred <b>borate</b> minerals contain boron in oxidation state +3. These minerals resemble silicates in some respect, although boron is often found not only in a tetrahedral coordination with oxygen, but also in a trigonal planar configuration. Unlike silicates, the boron minerals never contain boron with coordination number greater than four. A typical motif is exemplified by the tetraborate anions of the common mineral borax, shown at left. The formal negative charge of the tetrahedral <b>borate</b> center is balanced by metal cations in the minerals, such as the sodium (Na+) in borax.|$|E

In recent years, <b>borates</b> have become frequently employed by the conservation world, {{not only because the}} chemicals are effective in preventing wood decay, but because <b>borates</b> have a low mammalian toxicity, are odorless and colorless, and do not interfere with finishes or fasteners. From Viking warships to historic pianos, <b>borates</b> have been widely used for the preservation of wooden cultural heritage resources. Virginia City, Montana offers a prime test case to assess the performance of <b>borates</b> in historic wooden buildings.

5|$|Boron is a {{chemical}} element with symbolB and atomic number5. Produced entirely by cosmic ray spallation and supernovae {{and not by}} stellar nucleosynthesis, it is a low-abundance element in the Solar system and in the Earth's crust. Boron is concentrated on Earth by the water-solubility of its more common naturally occurring compounds, the <b>borate</b> minerals. These are mined industrially as evaporites, such as borax and kernite. The largest known boron deposits are in Turkey, the largest producer of boron minerals.|$|E

The trade name 20-Mule Team Borax was established by Francis Marion Smith's Pacific Coast Borax Company after Smith acquired Coleman's borax holdings in 1890. A memorable advertising campaign used the wagon's image to promote the Boraxo brand of granular hand soap and the Death Valley Days radio and television programs. In 1914, the Death Valley Railroad was built to serve mining operations {{on the east side}} of the valley. Mining continued after the collapse of Coleman's empire, and by the late 1920s the area was the world's number one source of borax. Some four to six million years old, the Furnace Creek Formation is the primary source of <b>borate</b> minerals gathered from Death Valley's playas.|$|E
5|$|There was {{an element}} naming {{controversy}} {{as to what}} the elements from 104 to 106 were to be called; the IUPAC adopted unnilseptium (symbol Uns) as a temporary, systematic element name for this element. In 1994 a committee of IUPAC recommended that element 107 be named bohrium, not nielsbohrium, since there was no precedence for using a scientist's complete name in the naming of an element. This was opposed by the discoverers as there was some concern that the name might be confused with boron and in particular the distinguishing of the names of their respective oxyanions, bohrate and <b>borate.</b> The matter was handed to the Danish branch of IUPAC which, despite this, voted in favour of the name bohrium, and thus the name bohrium for element 107 was recognized internationally in 1997. It was subsequently decided that oxyanions of bohrium should be called bohriates to avoid confusion.|$|E

There are several grand challenges that this work addresses. The foremost of these challenges is the development of structure-property relationships in transuranium materials. A deep understanding of the materials chemistry of actinides will likely lead to the development of advanced waste forms for radionuclides present in nuclear waste that prevent their transport in the environment.

5|$|Most of the {{chemistry}} of boron is nonmetallic in nature. Unlike its heavier congeners, {{it is not known}} to form a simple B3+ or hydrated 3+ cation. The small size of the boron atom enables the preparation of many interstitial alloy-type borides. Analogies between boron and transition metals have been noted in the formation of complexes, and adducts (for example, BH3 + CO →BH3CO and, similarly, Fe(CO)4 + CO →Fe(CO)5), {{as well as in the}} geometric and electronic structures of cluster species such as 2− and 2−. The aqueous chemistry of boron is characterised by the formation of many different polyborate anions. Given its high charge-to-size ratio, boron bonds covalently in nearly all of its compounds; the exceptions are the borides as these include, depending on their composition, covalent, ionic and metallic bonding components. Simple binary compounds, such as boron trichloride are Lewis acids as the formation of three covalent bonds leaves a hole in the octet which can be filled by an electron-pair donated by a Lewis base. Boron has a strong affinity for oxygen and a duly extensive <b>borate</b> chemistry. The oxide B2O3 is polymeric in structure, weakly acidic, and a glass former. Organometallic compounds of boron have been known since the 19th century (see organoboron chemistry).|$|E

Materials and Methods: In this study, heavy concretes containing galena (PbS) and several <b>borated</b> minerals are proposed as suitable materials against photons. The shielding properties of 21 galena concretes containing seven <b>borated</b> minerals with three mixing patterns were evaluated using MCNP 4 C Monte Carlo code. The attenuation of the gamma radiation is computed under the conditions of narrow and beam geometries. The x-ray sources with 40, 60, 90, and 120 kVp and gamma rays of 99 mTc, 131 I, 137 Cs, and 511 keV annihilation photons were considered. The photon flux values and the x-ray spectrum after applying all the concretes were compared to the ordinary ones. Regarding the results, more photon attenuations obtained by using high density concretes simulation in comparison to ordinary concrete. Results: The results revealed that the concretes containing orthopinokiolite as the <b>borated</b> material made by the third mixing pattern, had the most photon attenuation. According to the results, the shielding properties of the concretes containing different <b>borated</b> minerals were alike against high photon energies, whereas in low energy photons the attenuation depended on the type of <b>borated</b> mineral used in the concretes. Conclusion: The high-density heavy-weighted concretes could be effectively used as multi-purpose shield for radiotherapy rooms and nuclear reactors due to the <b>borated</b> minerals...|$|R

25|$|These buffers {{have plenty}} of ions in them, which is {{necessary}} for the passage of electricity through them. Something like distilled water or benzene contains few ions, which is not ideal for the use in electrophoresis. There are a number of buffers used for electrophoresis. The most common being, for nucleic acids Tris/Acetate/EDTA (TAE), Tris/Borate/EDTA (TBE). Many other buffers have been proposed, e.g. lithium <b>borate,</b> which is almost never used, based on Pubmed citations (LB), iso electric histidine, pK matched goods buffers, etc.; in most cases the purported rationale is lower current (less heat) and or matched ion mobilities, which leads to longer buffer life. <b>Borate</b> is problematic; <b>Borate</b> can polymerize, and/or interact with cis diols such as those found in RNA. TAE has the lowest buffering capacity but provides the best resolution for larger DNA. This means a lower voltage and more time, but a better product. LB is relatively new and is ineffective in resolving fragments larger than 5 kbp; However, with its low conductivity, a much higher voltage could be used (up to 35 V/cm), which means a shorter analysis time for routine electrophoresis. As low as one base pair size difference could be resolved in 3% agarose gel with an extremely low conductivity medium (1 mM Lithium <b>borate).</b>|$|E

The required complex of properties of piston rings made of cast iron cannot be always reached by applying traditional methods of heat treatment or chemical heat treatment processing. Thus, application of traditional <b>borating</b> methods associated with diffusion of boron into the solid phase leads to the formation of the working layer exhibiting high brittleness. Therefore, the problem of increasing the wear resistance of piston rings without embrittlement is challenging.

25|$|Boric acid in {{equilibrium}} {{with its}} conjugate base the <b>borate</b> ion {{is widely used}} (in the concentration range 50 - 100ppm boron equivalents) as a primary or adjunct pH buffer system in swimming pools. Boric acid is a weak acid, with pKa (the pH at which buffering is strongest because the free acid and <b>borate</b> ion are in equal concentrations) of 9.24 in pure water at 25°C. But apparent pKa is substantially lower in swimming pool or ocean waters because of interactions with various other molecules in solution. It will be around 9.0 in a salt-water pool. No matter which form of soluble boron is added, within the acceptable range of pH and boron concentration for swimming pools, boric acid is the predominant form in aqueous solution, {{as shown in the}} accompanying figure. The boric acid - <b>borate</b> system can be useful as a primary buffer system (substituting for the bicarbonate system with pKa1 = 6.0 and pKa2 = 9.4 under typical salt-water pool conditions) in pools with salt-water chlorine generators that tend to show upward drift in pH from a working range of pH 7.5 - 8.2. Buffer capacity is greater against rising pH (towards the pKa around 9.0), as illustrated in the accompanying graph. The use of boric acid in this concentration range does not allow any reduction in free HOCl concentration needed for pool sanitation, but it may add marginally to the photo-protective effects of cyanuric acid and confer other benefits through anti-corrosive activity or perceived water softness, depending on overall pool solute composition.|$|E

By comparing PAD profiles with FT-IR spectra of both the OH stretching (3900 - 3400 cm- 1) and the skeletal (under 2000 cm- 1) regions, it was possible to assign these new peaks to hydroxyls linked to trigonal and tetrahedral <b>borated</b> species, respectively.
