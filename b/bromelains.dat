O uso da bromelina é baseado em sua atividade proteolítica nas indústrias alimentícias e principalmente na farmacêutica brasileira. A bromelina é muito bem documentada pelos seus efeitos curativos em todas as condições inflamatórias, além de ter sua eficácia provada na cura de vários outros problemas de saúde, tais como: angina, indigestão e problemas respiratórios. Vários métodos de purificação da bromelina estão em estudo, sobretudo da bromelina do talo. A extração líquido-líquido é aplicada há muitos anos como uma valiosa técnica laboratorial de separação. Esta pode ser usada como um passo da pré-purificação usando um sistema de duas fases aquosas. Esses sistemas foram testados com sucesso, são sistemas formados por duas fases aquosas imiscíveis ou parcialmente miscíveis entre si, obtidas pela mistura de polímeros hidrofílicos ou um desses polímeros e um sal, como o sistema PEG (polietileno glicol) e o fosfato de potássio. O presente trabalho estudou a caracterização da enzima e a recuperação da bromelina presente na casca e talo do abacaxi, por extração líquido-líquido em sistemas de duas fases aquosas PEG/ fosfato. Realizou-se ensaios em batelada para a extração e recuperação da enzima, utilizando como indicador o coeficiente de partição. Obtiveram-se diagramas de fases para o sistema fosfato de potássio e polietileno glicol 1500 e 4000 nos pH's de 6 a 11, a 25 °C. Estudou-se três diferentes 'tie-lines'. Analisou-se a influência do pH e do comprimento das 'tie-lines' no coeficiente de partição da enzimaThe <b>bromelains</b> are proteases from vegetable origin, {{obtained from}} {{several species of}} Bromeliaceae family, which are found in pineapple's stem and fruit.

40|$|Pineapple crowns are an {{agricultural}} waste available in large quantity particularly from canned pineapple industry. Alternatives to its efficient utilisation are necessary as the crowns contain high enzyme activity {{which can be}} potentially used as a meat tenderiser. Thus, the aims {{of this study are}} to extract and purify <b>bromelain</b> from the pineapple crowns. The purified <b>bromelain</b> was freeze dried to produce <b>bromelain</b> powder which was later applied to tenderise the toughest Brahman part, round. The action of <b>bromelain</b> in tenderising beef was affected by different pHs of beef, immersion temperatures and times, and <b>bromelain</b> solution concentrations. Thus, response surface methodology (RSM) was used to determine the feasible optimum condition for the beef tenderisation by <b>bromelain.</b> The effect of <b>bromelain</b> treatment on the physico-chemical properties of beef and its nutritional quality was determined. The nutritional quality of beef was determined from the proximate extent between the bromelain-treated beef and the reference pattern protein and compared with the untreated beef. SDS-PAGE revealed that <b>bromelain</b> from pineapple crowns is a monomelic with a molecular weight of 30 kDa. The <b>bromelain</b> powder was less pure compared to that of standard <b>bromelain</b> powder. The <b>bromelain</b> powder stored in the frozen temperature was the most stable since it showed very little loss in <b>bromelain</b> activity and the lowest value in water activity compared to <b>bromelain</b> powder stored in the chilled and room temperatures after four weeks of storage. The beef tenderization treated with <b>bromelain</b> could be optimised by 89. 91 % at the feasible optimum condition whereby the pH of beef was 5. 6, the immersion temperature was 60 °C, the concentration of <b>bromelain</b> solution was 0. 17 % and the immersion time was 10 minutes. <b>Bromelain</b> decreased the hardness, water holding capacity (WHC), moisture content and a* value of beef.

Literature suggests a promising role of <b>bromelain</b> in surgical care. More clinical trials to establish its utility as an anti-inflammatory agent in surgical care are recommended...|$|R
40|$|The {{concentration}} of pineapple juice {{is needed to}} retain the <b>bromelain</b> activity and to standardize the composition and proteolytic activity. Thus, this work aimed to obtain a pure <b>bromelain</b> extract from the Ananas comosus L. Merril juice by membrane separation process. A 2 ² experimental planning was used to study the influence of pH and transmembrane pressure on the activity recovery by micro-filtration using a plain membrane. In second step, this enzyme was purified by the ultra-filtration using a 10 kDa millipore kit. The best operation condition to <b>bromelain</b> concentration using the plain membrane was at pH 7. 5 and transmembrane pressure of 0. 05 bar, while 85 % of <b>bromelain</b> activity was recovered. Ultra-filtration retained 100 % of proteolytic activity and concentrated in 10 fold the <b>bromelain</b> extract. SDS-PAGE electrophoresis showed that the ultra-filtrated had high purity and the <b>bromelain</b> from A. comosus pulp had a molecular weight of 24. 5 kDa...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} of this trial was to assess whether the dietary supplement (<b>bromelain)</b> {{had the potential to}} reduce plasma fibrinogen and other Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) risk factors in patients with diabetes. Methods: This randomized placebo controlled, double blind, parallel design, efficacy study was carried out in China and investigated the effect of 12 weeks of <b>bromelain</b> (1. 05 g/day) on plasma fibrinogen. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) recruited 68 Chinese diabetic patients (32 males and 36 females; Han origin, mean age of 61. 26 years (Standard Deviation, 12. 62 years)) with at least one CVD risk factor. Patients were randomized into either <b>bromelain</b> or placebo group. While <b>bromelain</b> group received <b>bromelain</b> capsule, the placebo group received placebo capsule which consisted inert ingredient and has no treatment effect. Patients and researcher were blinded and did not know whether they received <b>bromelain</b> or placebo capsules. Plasma fibrinogen, CVD risk factors and anthropometric indicators were determined at baseline and at 12 weeks. Results: The change in the fibrinogen level in the placebo group {{at the end of the}} study showed a mean reduction of 0. 36 g/L (Standard Deviation (SD) 0. 96 g/L) compared with the mean reduction of 0. 13 g/L (SD 0. 86 g/L) for the <b>bromelain</b> group. However, there was no significant difference in the mean change in fibrinogen between the placebo and <b>bromelain</b> groups (mean difference= 0. 23 g/L (SD 0. 22 g/L), p= 0. 291). Similarly, the difference in mean change in other CVD risk factors (blood lipids, blood pressure), blood glucose, C - reactive protein (CRP) and anthropometric measures between the <b>bromelain</b> and placebo groups was also not statistically significant. Conclusions: This RCT failed to show a beneficial effect in reducing fibrinogen or influencing other selected CVD risk factors but suggests other avenues for subsEquent research on <b>bromelain...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background—K 88 {{positive}} enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (K 88 + ETEC) is {{an important}} cause of diarrhoea in young piglets. K 88 + ETEC pathogenesis relies on attachment to specific glycoprotein receptors located on the intestinal mucosa. Proteolytic treatment of these receptors in vitro and in vivo prevents attachment of K 88 + ETEC to piglet small intestines and may be of clinical use to prevent K 88 + ETEC pathogenesis.  Aims—To determine whether <b>bromelain,</b> a proteolytic extract obtained from pineapple stems, would protect piglets against K 88 + ETEC diarrhoea and to confirm and extend earlier findings {{on the effects of}} <b>bromelain</b> on K 88 + ETEC receptors in vivo.  Methods—Bromelain (0, 12. 5, or 125 mg) was orally administered to just weaned piglets for 10 days. One day following commencement of <b>bromelain</b> treatment, piglets were challenged with K 88 + ETEC (5 × 1010 K 88 ac: 0149) for seven days. Intestinal contents from unchallenged piglets were obtained via an intestinal fistula, and tested for their ability to bind K 88 + ETEC before and after <b>bromelain</b> treatment.  Results—Both doses of <b>bromelain</b> were successful in reducing the incidence of K 88 + ETEC diarrhoea and protected piglets from life threatening disease. <b>Bromelain</b> treated pigs also had significantly increased weight gain compared with untreated pigs. <b>Bromelain</b> only temporarily inhibited K 88 + ETEC receptor activity, with receptor activity being regenerated 30 hours following treatment, consistent with the regeneration of new enterocytes.  Conclusion—Results show that <b>bromelain</b> can temporarily inactivate ETEC receptors in vivo and protect against ETEC induced diarrhoea. <b>Bromelain</b> may therefore be an effective prophylaxis against ETEC infection. ...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Bromelain</b> is a {{sulfhydryl}} {{proteolytic enzyme}} that can hydrolyze protein, protease or peptide. <b>Bromelain</b> {{can be found}} in pineapple stem, fruit and core. <b>Bromelain</b> is composed of 212 amino acid residues with cysteine- 25 forming a polypeptide chain that can hydrolyze peptide bonds by H 2 O. In medicine, <b>bromelain</b> has been developed as antibiotic, cancer drug, anti-inflammatory agent and immunomodulator. In dentistry, <b>bromelain</b> has potential to reduce plaque formation on the teeth and to irrigate root canal. METHODS: Pineapple core was dried for 3 days to get simplicia. Then simplicia was extracted with water solvent for 24 hours. After that, the macerated-pineapple core crude extract-derived <b>bromelain</b> (PCB) was separated by Sodium Dodecyl Sulphate-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) staining to ensure the presence of <b>bromelain.</b> In cytotoxic test, NIH- 3 T 3 fibroblast cultures were treated with extracts in various concentrations to for 24 or 48 hours. Number of fibroblasts was calculated using 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 - yl) - 2, 5 -Diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. RESULTS: Pineapple core extraction using maceration method produced relative high yield (concentration: 1. 5424 g/mL) of <b>bromelain,</b> which was confirmed by CBB staining results with the molecular weight of 33 kDa. Based on cytotoxic test results of PCB on NIH- 3 T 3 fibroblasts, 24 -hours-incubation LD 50 was 95. 7 g/L, while 48 -hours-incubation LD 50 was 51. 1 g/L. CONCLUSION: PCB has low cytotoxic effect in NIH- 3 T 3 fibroblasts...|$|R
40|$|<b>Bromelain</b> is a {{proteolytic}} enzyme {{extracted from the}} stems and the immature fruits of pineapple that {{was found to be}} antitumorigenic in different in vitro models. <b>Bromelain</b> has been reported to promote apoptosis, particularly in breast cancer cells, with the up-regulation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p 38 kinase. Our study was designed to determine if <b>bromelain</b> could induce apoptosis in GI- 101 A breast cancer cells. GI- 101 A cells were treated with increasing concentrations of <b>bromelain</b> for 24 hours. The effect of <b>bromelain</b> for inducing cell death via activation of the apoptosis mechanism in GI- 101 A cells was further determined by using caspase- 9 and caspase- 3 assays along with the M 30 -Apoptosense assay to measure cytokeratin 18 (CK 18) levels in the cytoplasm of the cultured cancer cells. A dose-dependent increase in the activities of caspase- 9 and caspase- 3 coinciding with elevation of CK 18 levels was found in bromelain-treated cells compared with control cells. Furthermore, the apoptosis induction by <b>bromelain</b> was confirmed by DNA fragmentation analysis and 4, 62 ̆ 7 -diamino- 2 -phenylindole dihydrochloride fluorescence staining of the nucleus. Our results indicate an increase in apoptosis-related cell death in breast cancer cells with increasing concentrations of <b>bromelain...</b>|$|R
