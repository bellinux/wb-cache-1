40|$|Abstract—In media {{transmission}} over packet networks, one of {{the most}} challenging issues is the avoidance of receiver <b>buffer</b> <b>underflows.</b> Among the approaches proposed to solve this problem, the source rate adaptation is promising, due to the availability of multi-rate encoders. In order to succeed, rate-adaptive approaches should take into account not only the network throughput, but also the playout buffer fullness. Using this information, it is possible to determine at which rate the source should encode the stream, in order to avoid underflows. In this paper, we derive and analyze the expression of the underflow probability; we show that it can be written in closed form {{as a function of the}} source rate, the receiver buffer fullness and the channel statistics. In particular, we study the dependency on the media rate, and we show how to achieve infinitesimal underflow probabilities even in presence of a high channel variance. Furthermore, we specialize this formulation for a CBR channel. In case of channel variations during the playout, the buffered data may not suffice to ensure zero underflow probability; based on the previous formulation, we present an algorithm to recompute the source rate that allows continuous media playout. This algorithm can be safely iterated at every channel throughput change, and proved to be effective in avoiding <b>buffer</b> <b>underflows.</b> I...|$|R

We proceed by defining models for the streaming media system and the random, lossy, packet delivery channel. Our streaming system model buffers media at the client, and combats packet losses with deadline-constrained automatic repeat request (ARQ).

40|$|Streaming media {{applications}} are plagued with playback disruptions due to client <b>buffer</b> <b>underflow</b> resulting from fluctuations in network throughput. When some clients are experiencing <b>buffer</b> <b>underflow</b> and disruptions, other clients may have excess buffered data. This suggests that disruptions {{can be reduced}} by the redistribution of resources to provide higher throughput to streaming sessions with less buffered data, that is, to sessions with greater need. This paper proposes a scheme that achieves an effective or endto -end result of the above dynamic resource allocation {{without the use of}} either explicit per-session resource reservation or across-session coordination. Instead, each packet is stamped at the source with the buffer occupancy of the session, and prioritized scheduling is performed at the resource bottleneck to favor packets with smaller buffer occupancy. Due to the actions of end-to-end congestion control, higher throughput can then be maintained for streaming sessions with less buffer. Experimental and simulation results show that the proposed scheme can increase the mean time between playback disruptions by a factor of 4 for fixed initial buffer time, or reduce the required initial buffer by a factor of 2. 5 for fixed probability of hitting a playback disruption. 1...|$|E
