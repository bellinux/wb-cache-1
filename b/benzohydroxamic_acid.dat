Respiration, membrane potential, and oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria from P. brasiliensis spheroplasts were evaluated in situ, {{and the presence}} of a complete (Complex I-V) functional respiratory chain was demonstrated. In succinate-energized mitochondria, ADP induced a transition from resting to phosphorylating respiration. The presence of an alternative NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase was indicated by: (i) the ability to oxidize exogenous NADH and (ii) the lack of sensitivity to rotenone and presence of sensitivity to flavone. Malate/NAD(+) -supported respiration suggested the presence of either a mitochondrial pyridine transporter or a glyoxylate pathway contributing to NADH and/or succinate production. Partial sensitivity of NADH/succinate-supported respiration to antimycin A and cyanide, as well as sensitivity to <b>benzohydroxamic</b> <b>acids,</b> suggested the presence of an alternative oxidase in the yeast form of the fungus.

40|$|We {{performed}} a parametric {{study of the}} properties of desorbed neutral particles following the interaction of energetic, charged projectiles with organic molecules, such as self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). SAMs form {{a new class of}} materials that originate from the spontaneous ordering of organic molecules into a monolayer with maximal density on a substrate [LOV 05]. SAMs offer the unique possibility to combine the properties of three groups (tail, chain and the end group) to a large extent independently of each other. The irradiation of a surface with energetic charged particles induces the emission of secondary particles. Although these are distributed over different charge and excited states, most of them are neutrals. To probe the neutral particles we are using pulsed laser ionization in combination with time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Laser spectroscopic studies of the SAMs molecules allow to optimize the resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization scheme of the chosen chromophore (such as aromatic structures, e. g., phenyl chromophore) and to map the photofragmentation process. Monolayers of ω-(4 ’-methyl-biphenyl- 4 -yl) -alkanethiols (H 3 C-C 6 H 4 -C 6 H 4 -(CH 2) n-SH, BPn, n= 1 - 6) adsorbed on Au(111) demonstrate a strong dependence of their structural configuration in function of the alkane spacer [CYGa 04], as well as the temperature of preparation or of annealing following the assembly [CYGb 04]. For an even number n of methylene groups in the spacer, two stable phases of BPn/Au were found. The α and β/δ phase are respectively characterized by a different bond angle φ of the molecules with the substrate. Mass spectra of desorbed fragments were recorded during the irradiation of BPn/Au (n= 2, 4, 5) corresponding to the different phases. Systematic phase-related variation were observed in the desorption behavior, which can be related unambiguously to structural differences in the monolayers. The second part of our research has focused on the applicability of our methodology to industrial relevant samples. The adsorption characteristics of corrosion retarding agents on metals are being explored. As model systems different para-substituted <b>benzohydroxamic</b> <b>acids</b> (BHA) on copper are selected. We investigated the desorption process of unsubstituted BHA and derivatives (Cl-, CH 3 O-, NO 2 -) dissolved in water and methanol. The deposition protocols (with the nature of the solvent, the concentration of the molecules in solution, the temperature during deposition and the immersion time as important parameters [GAR 05]) are important to optimize. Secondary neutral as well as ion mass spectrometry is used to evaluate the adsorption of the molecules on the surface as function of the coverage. Additionally we investigated the sputtering of copper atoms desorbed from the substrate of samples covered with thin layers of BHA prepared in different solvents. From measured flight time distributions measured, we found that copper atoms from samples prepared in water have on average a lower kinetic energy than the ones prepared using methanol as solvent. The observed solvent-dependent desorption behavior may be related to a solvent-dependent molecule orientation [GAR 05], and these molecule-dependent features may be related to differences in binding energy between the molecules and the copper surface.

Whereas Iron (III) forms a 1 : 1 complex (ML) with BHA, it forms both ML and M(2) L complexes with SHA. The presence of M 2 L in aqueous medium is corroborated by FTIR measurements. The reactive form of Iron(III) is the hydrolyzed species FeOH(2 +), which binds to the 0, 0 site in ML and to the O,O and O(P),N (P = phenolate) sites in M(2) L, inducing full deprotonation of the latter. The reaction pathway is {{discussed in terms of}} a multistep mechanistic scheme in which the metal ligand interaction is coupled to hydrolysis and self-aggregation steps of Iron(III). The observation and characterization of M(2) L as a stable species is important because it contains the -Fe-O-N-Fe- sequence, which constitutes the repetitive motif of the SHA-based metallacrown ring and provides the rationale for 12 -MC- 4 metallacrowns.

40|$|This thesis {{involves}} the design, synthesis {{and testing of}} organic hydrophobic ligands. They would act as co-collectors in froth flotation processes to enhance the recovery of sulfidic minerals which have undergone some oxidation on processing and are not efficiently collected by the commercial reagents used in froth flotation. Strong and selective binding to iron(III) oxide/hydroxide surfaces, e. g. goethite, over unwanted silicaceous material was considered essential criteria for such new cocollectors. A general overview of froth flotation processes is given in Chapter 1 {{as well as a}} description of the analytical techniques used in this thesis and the features that the ligands must have to act as co-collectors. On the basis of the strong binding to iron(III) surfaces of the organic ligand Irgacor 419 ®, used commercially as a corrosion inhibitor for iron, this compound was studied as a potential co-collector. Adsorption isotherms were determined by UV-Vis spectroscopy for two carboxylic acids that may also bind strongly to goethite, the results of which are discussed in Chapter 2. Chapter 3 {{involves the}} measurement of the strength of binding of one the most widely used type of collectors for sulfide ores, potassium ethyl xanthate. Complications in the analysis of materials in solution by both ICP-OES and UV-Vis spectroscopy arose due to the instability of potassium ethyl xanthate in solution, making determination and interpretation of isotherms difficult. The determination of adsorption isotherms for 2 -mercaptobenzothiazole, which showed weak binding to goethite as well as to silica, and the mode of binding of 2 -mercaptobenzothiazole on copper(I) surfaces is reported in Chapter 4. A crystal structure was obtained in which four units of 2 -mercaptobenzothiazole bridge two nickel atoms through the nitrogen atom and the exocyclic sulfur and is considered as a model for binding to sulfidic minerals. Chapter 5 looks at the strength of binding to goethite and silica of various hydroxamic acids. <b>Benzohydroxamic</b> <b>acid</b> was initially selected for study since hydroxamates are known to act as collectors for oxidized materials. Unpredictably, <b>benzohydroxamic</b> <b>acid</b> showed strong binding to a goethite surface and did not release any iron from the surface into solution, which would have been predicted due to its known strong chelating abilities to iron(III). The X-ray structure determination of the first example of a dinuclear Fe(III) hydroxamate complex showed this to have -oxo bridge formed by the hydroxamate unit and supports multisite attachment between this ligand and the surface, as suggested by adsoption isotherms. Simple models based on this dinucleating motif provide plausible modes of multisite attachment to a goethite surface. Competitive binding studies provided a way of ranking the ability to bind to goethite of acetohydroxamic acid, which was not suitable for analyses by either ICP-OES or UV-Vis spectroscopy. Of the ligands studied in this chapter acetohydroxamic acid was found to bind most strongly to goethite followed by <b>benzohydroxamic</b> <b>acid.</b> In Chapter 6, the attachment to goethite and silica of a series of phosphonic acids is investigated. All show a very high binding strength to goethite. Froth flotation experiments at a laboratory scale are described in Chapter 7. The types of ligand that showed strong binding to goethite in adsorption isotherms experiments were tested as co-collectors in different ores and conditions. There is not a simple correlation between adsorption isotherm data and flotation performance as co-collectors because other factors, besides strength of binding, affect the system. <b>Benzohydroxamic</b> <b>acid</b> was the ligand that increased the grade/recovery of the process in all the cases studied.

Ferric {{horseradish peroxidase}} has an absorption band at 640 nm that is attributed to a charge-transfer (CT) transition between the a(2 u) HOMO of T electrons of the porphyrin ring and the d(xy) /d(yz) orbital of the ferric ion. Because the water channel extends to the Fe, {{it seems likely that}} the CT band will be sensitive to the hydration of the protein. To study this premise, the protein was incorporated into trehalose/sucrose glasses and the hydration of the sugar glasses was varied. Absorption spectra of HRP in sugar glasses and in glycerol/water were taken in the range 10 - 300 K. The CT absorption band shows vibronic fine structure. The peak positions are the same in hydrated sugar and glycerol/water but the peak positions change in desiccated sugar glass. The data suggest that in hydrated, but not desiccated, sugar glass, water is retained in the heme pocket. Binding of the competitive inhibitor <b>benzohydroxamic</b> <b>acid</b> to the protein increases the CT absorption and resolution. The effect of <b>benzohydroxamic</b> <b>acid</b> on the Fe as calculated using a combination of density functional theory and molecular mechanics is to stabilize the spin state 3 / 2 with respect to 5 / 2.

40|$|The {{activation}} of scheelite and wolframite by lead nitrate with <b>benzohydroxamic</b> <b>acid</b> (BHA) as collector was investigated {{by means of}} micro flotation test, zeta potential measurement, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses and density functional theory (DFT) calculation. The flotation results confirmed that the addition of lead nitrate can markedly enhance the recovery of scheelite and wolframite. In the zeta potential curves obvious positive shifts were observed {{with the presence of}} lead nitrate. Lead was detected on mineral surface in microscopic analysis and the survey XP spectra. Both the electrokinetic study and XPS analyses indicated that lead ion can be adsorbed onto mineral surface. In DFT calculation, the coordination model of BHA with metal hydroxyl ions (Ca(OH) +, Mn(OH) +, Fe(OH) + and Pb(OH) +) was simulated and their binding energy were also calculated. The calculated results revealed that the binding ability of BHA and Pb(OH) + is the strongest, indicating that BHA can preferentially coordinate with Pb ion compared with Ca, Mn and Fe ions...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} were investigated, the synthesis, {{acetylcholinesterase}} inhibition and antioxidant activity {{of a series of}} hydroxamic acid derivatives (HAD), with different chemical group characteristics, such as aliphatic (acetohydroxamic acid and butyryl hydroxamic acid), aromatic (<b>benzohydroxamic</b> <b>acid</b> and phenylalanine hydroxamic acid) and amino acid (glycine hydroxamic acid and alanine hydroxamic acid). It was observed that these HAD compounds present very promising activity as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors and as antioxidants. The aliphatic HAD demonstrated to have a higher inhibitory activity of AChE than amino acid or aromatic HAD. As for the antioxidant activity, a high antioxidant potential was found for all the compounds with EC 50 values ranging from 0. 19 µM to 1. 65 µM. Aiming these applications, a biocatalysis approach was used to obtain these HADs with optimal reactional conditions. In this study, reverse micelles with immobilized Pseudomonas aeruginosa intact cells containing amidase were used as a biocatalyst to catalyze the acyltransferase reaction of the corresponding substrate amide and hydroxylamine to obtain various HAD and this was achieved {{for the first time with}} yields of approximately 100 %. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|The {{synthesis}} and {{characterization of}} a series of hydroxamic acid namely <b>benzohydroxamic</b> <b>acid</b> (BHA), salicylhydroxamic acid (SHA) and their complexes with Cu(II), Co(II), V(IV), Zn(II), Fe(II), Ni(II) and Cr(III) are described herein. The characterization of the synthesized ligands and complexes were carried out by means of elemental analysis (C,H,N), ¹H and ¹³C NMR and IR spectroscopy, conductivity, magnetic susceptibility and melting point. Through IR and NMR studies, the synthesized ligands were shown to possess the carbonyl (CO) and hydroxylamine (NH₂-OH) groups, characteristics of hydroxamic acid. It was found that the dominant coordination mode in metal-hydroxamic acid complexes was the O, O ’-bidentate chelates in which the ligands were singly deprotonated (hydroxamato). The coordination through the carbonyl oxygen atom and the deprotonated hydroxy group showed a very stable five-membered chelate was formed. Moreover, depending on pH, two (0, 0) bonding modes of the ligands are accessible to a series of metal ions like Cu(II), Cr(III), Zn(II), Fe(II) and VO(IV) where in this case, the synthesis took place in acidic environment which making the O, O-bonding modes were more favorable...|$|E
40|$|Ultrafast, multi-dimensional {{infrared}} spectroscopy, in {{the form}} of 2 D-IR and pump-probe measurements, has been employed to investigate the effect of substrate binding on the structural dynamics of the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) enzyme. Using nitric oxide bound to the ferric haem of HRP as a sensitive probe of local dynamics, we report measurements of the frequency fluctuations (spectral diffusion) and vibrational lifetime of the NO stretching mode with <b>benzohydroxamic</b> <b>acid</b> (BHA) located in the substrate-binding position at the periphery of the haem pocket, in both D 2 O and H 2 O solvents. The results reveal that, with BHA bound to the enzyme, the local structural dynamics are insensitive to H/D exchange. These results are in stark contrast to those found in studies of the substrate-free enzyme, which demonstrated that the local chemical and dynamic environment of the haem ligand is influenced by water molecules. In light of the large changes in solvent accessibility caused by substrate binding, we discuss the potential for varying roles for the solvent in the haem pocket of HRP at different stages along the reaction coordinate of the enzymatic mechanism.

40|$|ABSTRACTThe heme {{structure}} perturbation of poly(ethylene glycol) -modified {{horseradish peroxidase}} (HRP-PEG) dissolved in benzene and toluene has been probed by resonance Raman dispersion spectroscopy. Analysis of the depolarization ratio dispersion of several Raman bands revealed {{an increase of}} rhombic B 1 g distortion with respect to native HRP in water. This finding strongly supports {{the notion that a}} solvent molecule has moved into the heme pocket where it stays in close proximity to one of the heme's pyrrole rings. The interactions between the solvent molecule, the heme, and the heme cavity slightly stabilize the hexacoordinate high spin state without eliminating the pentacoordinate quantum mixed spin state that is dominant in the resting enzyme. On the contrary, the model substrate <b>benzohydroxamic</b> <b>acid</b> strongly favors the hexacoordinate quantum mixed spin state and induces a B 2 g-type distortion owing to its position close to one of the heme methine bridges. These results strongly suggest that substrate binding must have an influence on the heme geometry of HRP and that the heme structure of the enzyme-substrate complex (as opposed to the resting state) must be the key to understanding the chemical reactivity of HRP...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The classic Lossen {{rearrangement}} is {{a well-known}} reaction describing the transformation of an O-activated hydroxamic acid into the corresponding isocyanate. In this study, we found that chlorinated benzoquinones (CnBQ) serve as {{a new class of}} agents for the activation of <b>benzohydroxamic</b> <b>acid</b> (BHA), leading to Lossen rearrange-ment. Compared to the classic one, this new kind of CnBQ-activated Lossen rearrangement has the following unique characteristics: (1) The stability of CnBQ-activated BHA intermediates was found to depend not only on the degree but also on the position of Cl-substitution on CnBQs, which can be divided into two subgroups. (2) It is the relative energy of the anionic CnBQ−BHA intermediates that determine the rate of this CnBQ-activated rearrangement, which is the rate-limiting step, and the Cl or H ortho to the reaction site at CnBQ is crucial for the stability of the anionic intermediates. (3) A pKa−activation energy correlation was observed, which can explain why the correlation exists between the rate of the rearrangement and the acidity of the conjugate acid of the anionic leaving group, the hydroxlated quinones. These findings may have broad implications for future research on halogenated quinoid carcinogens and hydroxamate biomedical agents...|$|E
40|$|Endothelin- 1 (ET- 1), {{a potent}} {{vasoconstrictor}} peptide, exerts its physiological effects by binding and activating specific G protein-coupled receptors, named ET(A) and ET(B). An unique property of ET- 1 {{is its ability}} to bind almost irreversibly to its receptors. Aspirin and salicylic acid (SA) are allosteric inhibitors of ET- 1 binding to ET(A) receptors. Dihalogenated derivatives of SA have been identified as more potent allosteric inhibitors than aspirin. In this study, disubstituted <b>benzohydroxamic</b> <b>acid,</b> benzaldoximes and dihalosalicylic acid dimers were synthesized and tested as inhibitors of [(125) I] ET- 1 binding to ET(A) receptors in rat embryonic cardiomyocyte (H 9 c 2 cell) membranes. Some dihalosalicylic acid dimers 2 h showed good inhibitory activity, the most active compounds are the hydroxamic acids derived from anthranilic acid. Among these compounds, the 3, 5 -diiodo- 2 -aminobenzohydroxamic acid e compound 2 a is three-folds more potent as inhibitor of [(125) I] ET- 1 binding to ET(A) receptors than the 3; 5 -diiodosalicylic acid reported in literature.

40|$|The {{effect of}} propyl-gallate (PG) and <b>benzohydroxamic</b> <b>acid</b> (BHAM), inhibitors of cyanide-resistant, {{alternative}} respiration path (AP), on germination were examined using after-ripened {{upper and lower}} cocklebur {Xanthium pennsyloanicum Wallr.) seeds pre-soaked at 23 °C for various periods. Germination was strongly suppressed by PG or BHAM at concentration above 2 mM. However, germination was enhanced by low concentrations of PG or BHAM (0. 25 or 0. 5 mM) which reduced some portions of AP operation. Similarly, the high temperature-induced germination of pre-soaked upper seeds was promoted by the same low concentration range of PG or BHAM, in which PG and BHAM were effective only when applied {{at the start of}} high temperature incubation. The inhibition of germination by C 2 H 4 at high temperature occurred only when seeds were exposed to C 2 H 4 during the earlier period of high temperature incubation, and delayed application tended to promote their germination, although most of germinated seeds did not exhibit the normal germination behaviour of predominant radicle protrusion. If the upper seeds had been subjected to a short-time pre-soaking, the inhibition of high temperature-induced germination by C 2 H 4 wa...|$|E

40|$|Hydroxamic acids, {{which are}} best-known for their metal-chelating {{properties}} in biomedical research, {{have been found}} to effectively detoxify the carcinogenic polyhalogenated quinoid metabolites of pentachlorophenol and other persistent organic pollutants. However, the chemical mechanism underlying such detoxication is unclear. Here we show that <b>benzohydroxamic</b> <b>acid</b> (BHA) could dramatically accelerate the conversion of the highly toxic tetrachloro- 1, 4 -benzoquinone (p-chloranil) to the much less toxic 2, 5 -dichloro- 3, 6 -dihydroxy- 1, 4 -benzoquonine (chloranilic acid), with rate accelerations of up to 150, 000 -fold. In contrast, no enhancing effect was observed with O-methyl BHA. The major reaction product of BHA was isolated and identified as O-phenylcarbamyl benzohydroxamate. On the basis of these data and oxygen- 18 isotope-labeling studies, we proposed that suicidal nucleophilic attack coupled with an unexpected double Lossen rearrangement reaction was responsible for this remarkable acceleration of the detoxication reaction. This is the first report of an unusually mild and facile Lossen-type rearrangement, which could take place under normal physiological conditions in two consecutive steps. Our findings may have broad biological and environmental implications for future research on hydroxamic acids and polyhalogenated quinoid carcinogens, which are two important classes of compounds of major biomedical and environmental interest...|$|E
40|$|In this study, the {{production}} of the highly toxic oxidant hypochlorous acid (HOCl) by the phagocytic enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO) was quantitated and the concomitant alterations of low density lipoprotein (LDL) were analyzed in view of the potential role of LDL in atherosclerosis. Using the monochlorodimedone assay, it was found that HOCl is produced in micromolar concentrations. The kinetics of the decrease of tryptophan fluorescence appeared to be a sensitive method to monitor LDL alterations under near in vivo conditions. Therefore, this method was used to subsequently compare the effectiveness of MPO inhibitors that block production of HOCl with compounds that act as HOCl traps. The efficiency of MPO inhibitors to prevent LDL damage increased in the series <b>benzohydroxamic</b> <b>acid</b> 6 salicylhydroxamic acid 6 3 -amino- 1, 2, 4 -triazole 6 sodium azide 6 potassium cyanide 6 p-hydroxy-benzoic acid hydrazide, while for the HOCl traps the protective efficiency increased in the series glycine 6 taurine 6 methionine. We conclude that HOCl traps may have high potential therapeutic impact in vivo due to their low toxicity, although high concentrations of them would have to reach sites of inflammation.
