5|$|King Kalākaua trusted Rosenberg's {{skill as}} a fortune teller, perhaps <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> Rosenberg chanted in Hebrew {{reminded}} him of ancient Hawaiian rites. In January 1887, the king—who had become increasingly autocratic and was facing several scandals—granted Rosenberg a private audience at the palace. The king and Rosenberg became close, and routinely visited each other for several {{days at a time}} and held long conversations. During the audiences, Rosenberg told Bible stories and read from the Talmud. He began to teach the king basic Hebrew, and gave him an ornate Torah and yad that he had brought with him to Hawaii. He also claimed to have found references to Hawaii in ancient Hebrew texts, a statement that encouraged the king to restore aspects of Hawaiian religion. The king had previously sought instruction from several people he regarded as prophets and had established a society dedicated to the revival of native Hawaiian traditions. Finally, the king declared Rosenberg his kahuna-kilokilo, a royal soothsayer.|$|E
25|$|In Hinduism, an icon, image, statue or idol {{is called}} Murti or Pratima. Major Hindu traditions such as Vaishnavism, Shaivism, Shaktism and Smartaism favor {{the use of}} Murti (idol). These traditions {{suggest that it is}} easier to {{dedicate}} time and focus on spirituality through anthropomorphic or non-anthropomorphic icons. The Bhagavad Gita – a Hindu scripture, in verse 12.5, states that only a few have the time and mind to ponder and fix on the unmanifested Absolute (abstract formless Brahman), and {{it is much easier to}} focus on qualities, virtues, aspects of a manifested representation of god, through one's senses, emotions and heart, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> human beings naturally are.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogenation {{converts}} liquid {{vegetable oils}} into solid or semi-solid fats, {{such as those}} present in margarine. Changing the degree of saturation of the fat changes some important physical properties, such as the melting range, which is why liquid oils become semi-solid. Solid or semi-solid fats are preferred for baking <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> the fat mixes with flour produces a more desirable texture in the baked product. Because partially hydrogenated vegetable oils are cheaper than animal fats, are available {{in a wide range}} of consistencies, and have other desirable characteristics (such as increased oxidative stability and longer shelf life), they are the predominant fats used as shortening in most commercial baked goods.|$|E

25|$|Sanctions {{have reduced}} Iran's access to {{products}} {{needed for the}} oil and energy sectors, have prompted many oil companies to withdraw from Iran, and have also caused a decline in oil production due to reduced access to technologies needed to improve their efficiency. According to Undersecretary of State William Burns, Iran may be annually losing as much as $60 billion in energy investment. Many international companies have also been reluctant {{to do business with}} Iran for fear of losing access to larger Western markets. As well as restricting export markets, the sanctions have reduced Iran's oil income by increasing the costs of repatriating revenues in complicated ways that sidestep the sanctions; Iranian analysts estimate the budget deficit for the 2011/2012 fiscal year, which in Iran ends in late March, at between $30bn to $50bn. The effects of U.S. sanctions include expensive basic goods for Iranian citizens, and an aging and increasingly unsafe civil aircraft fleet. According to the Arms Control Association, the international arms embargo against Iran is slowly reducing Iran's military capabilities, largely due to its dependence on Russian and Chinese military assistance. The only substitute is to find compensatory measures requiring more time and money, and which are less effective. According to at least one analyst (Fareed Zakaria), the market for imports in Iran is dominated by state enterprises and state-friendly enterprises, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to get around the sanctions is smuggling, and smuggling requires strong connections with the government. This has weakened Iranian civil society and strengthened the state.|$|E

Guy Williams, Weta's visual effects supervisor, said, [...] "We shared assets {{back and forth}} with ILM, but our {{pipelines}} are unique and it's hard for other assets to plug into it.

[...] Meester also expressed fondness for Dan and Blair, however, stating, [...] "I think they're good for each other in a lot of ways, in a way that Chuck and Blair aren't."

500|$|Lego Racers {{gameplay}} {{received a}} mixed reaction from critics. Charla called creating and testing cars {{a lot of}} fun, especially <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> a car is built has [...] "a major effect on how it controls", and IGN's reviewer for the PC version found that unlocking new bricks in the circuit mode for use in car customization is addictive. However, Stahl called the game's construction system unfriendly, stating that the player is [...] "better off just sticking {{with one of the}} default vehicles". Imperio said that handling the cars is [...] "surprisingly tight", calling the N64 control scheme intuitive. Conversely, Charla found that most of the cars feel top-heavy, and stated that the racing is awful. IGN's reviewer for the PC version praised the power up system, calling it pretty cool, as well as stating that the Power Plus bricks add [...] "a new strategy to the game", but Stahl called the system [...] "terribly lame". Reviewers also criticised the game's multiplayer features, with IGN's PC reviewer calling the split screen mode simple, and an Electronic Gaming Monthly reviewer stating that the [...] "lack of multiplayer options" [...] hurts Lego Racers replay value.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the hill}} fort was built, a Neolithic causewayed {{enclosure}} was constructed on the site. Dating from around 4000BC, {{it was an}} oval area enclosed by two ditches, It is called a causewayed enclosure <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> the ditches were dug meant that there would originally have been gaps. These gaps, and the bank being only [...] high, indicate the site {{would not have been}} defensive. Instead the ditches may have been symbolic, separating the interior of the enclosure and its activities from the outside. Archaeologist Niall Sharples, who was involved in excavating the hill fort in the 1980s, has identified the hilltop views of the surrounding landscape as a likely factor for the enclosure's position. Situated {{on the side of the}} hill, it would have been visible from several miles away, and when first cut the ditches would have exposed the underlying white chalk and stood out against the green hillside. The interior of the enclosure has been disturbed by later habitation and farming. The site does not appear to have been inhabited, although a grave containing the remains of two children, aged 6–7, has been discovered. The enclosure is the earliest evidence of human activity on the site.|$|E

For example, Petrescu used to be Petre's son. [...] Similar suffixes such as -asco, -asgo, -esque, -ez, etc. are present in other Latin-derived languages.

2500|$|Boyle also {{considered}} {{the story of}} Sunshine as a counterintuitive approach for the contemporary issue of global warming, {{with the death of}} the Sun being a threat. Originally, Sunshine was scripted to begin with a voiceover talking about how parents tell their children not to look into the Sun, but once told, the children would be compelled to look. Boyle described the Sun as a godlike personality in the film, creating a psychological dimension for the astronauts due to its scale and power. The director also described the film's villain as based on light, explaining: [...] "That's quite a challenge <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> you generate fear in cinema is darkness." [...] The director also sought to have the characters experience a psychological journey in which each person is worn mentally, physically, and existentially and is experiencing doubt in their faiths. To capture the dangers of the voyage that the crew members went through, the director cited Bill Bryson's A Short History of Nearly Everything as influential in [...] "articulating the universe's power".|$|E
