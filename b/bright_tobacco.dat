2500|$|Tobacco is {{cultivated}} annually, and can {{be harvested}} in several ways. In the oldest method still used today, the entire plant is harvested at once by cutting off the stalk at {{the ground with a}} tobacco knife. It is then speared onto sticks, four to six plants a stick and hung in a curing barn. In the 19th century, <b>bright</b> <b>tobacco</b> began to be harvested by pulling individual leaves off the stalk as they ripened. The leaves ripen from the ground upwards, so a field of tobacco harvested in this manner involves the serial harvest of a number of [...] "primings", beginning with the volado leaves near the ground, working to the seco leaves {{in the middle of the}} plant, and finishing with the potent ligero leaves at the top. Before this, the crop must be topped when the pink flowers develop. Topping always refers to the removal of the tobacco flower before the leaves are systematically removed, and eventually, entirely harvested. As the industrial revolution took hold, harvesting wagons used to transport leaves were equipped with man-powered stringers, an apparatus that used twine to attach leaves to a pole. In modern times, large fields are harvested mechanically, although topping the flower and in some cases the plucking of immature leaves is still done by hand. Most tobacco in the U.S. is grown in North Carolina, Kentucky, and Virginia.|$|E
5000|$|Growers {{had noticed}} that sandy, {{highland}} soil produced thinner, weaker plants. Captain Abisha Slade, of Caswell County, North Carolina had considerable infertile, sandy soil, and planted the new [...] "gold-leaf" [...] varieties on it. Slade owned a slave, Stephen, who around 1839 accidentally produced the first true <b>bright</b> <b>tobacco.</b> He used charcoal to restart a fire used to cure the crop. The surge of heat turned the leaves yellow. Using that discovery, Slade developed a system for producing <b>bright</b> <b>tobacco,</b> cultivated on poorer soils and using charcoal for heat-curing.|$|E

50|$|The {{establishment}} of the Rocky Mount tobacco market in the late 1800s {{is one of the}} town's most noteworthy developments.

50|$|<b>Bright</b> <b>tobacco</b> was {{introduced}} in South Carolina in the 1880s and 1890s. This grows well in the sandy, loamy soils of the Pee Dee and is flue-cured. The traditional barns had one or two fireboxes using wood or coal. In the 1950s, many barns were changed to gas or oil heat for better temperature regulation.|$|E
50|$|Flue-cured {{tobacco is}} kept in an {{enclosed}} barn heated by flues (pipes) of hot air, but the tobacco is not directly exposed to smoke. This method produces cigarette tobacco that is high in sugar and has medium {{to high levels of}} nicotine. It is the fastest method of curing, requiring about a week. Virginia tobacco that has been flue cured is also called <b>bright</b> <b>tobacco,</b> because flue curing turns its leaves gold, orange, or yellow.|$|E
50|$|Danville {{was also}} the main railway head for Confederate {{soldiers}} going to the front. These brought <b>bright</b> <b>tobacco</b> with them from Danville to the lines, traded it {{with each other and}} Union soldiers, and developed quite a taste for it. At the end of the war, the soldiers went home and a national market had developed for the local crop. Caswell and Pittsylvania counties were the only two counties in the South that increased in total wealth after the war.|$|E
50|$|News {{spread through}} the area pretty quickly. The {{infertile}} sandy soil of the Appalachian piedmont was suddenly profitable, and people rapidly developed flue-curing techniques, a more efficient way of smoke-free curing. Farmers discovered that <b>Bright</b> leaf <b>tobacco</b> needs thin, starved soil, and {{those who could not}} grow other crops found that they could grow tobacco. Formerly unproductive farms reached 20-35 times their previous worth. By 1855, six Piedmont counties adjoining Virginia ruled the tobacco market.|$|R
50|$|Blooming Grove, {{also known}} as the Mandeville-Rogers House, is a {{historic}} plantation house located near Florence, Florence County, South Carolina. It was originally constructed about 1790, with a two-story addition built between 1800 and 1820. It is an I-house form dwelling, with a Early Classical Revival two-story portico. Also on the property is a contributing brick-lined well. Blooming Grove is associated with Frank Mandeville Rogers (1857-1945), who promoted the growing of <b>Bright</b> Leaf <b>tobacco</b> in South Carolina.|$|R
50|$|A planter, William T. Sutherlin also {{developed}} as an entrepreneur and industrialist. He developed {{ways to improve}} the process of preparing the region's <b>bright</b> leaf <b>tobacco</b> for market, as there was great demand for this commodity. Before the Civil War, Sutherlin was the first Virginian to apply steam power to hydraulic tobacco presses; he owned and operated the second-largest tobacco factory in the state. Sutherlin also founded and served as the first president of the Bank of Danville. In 1855, Sutherlin was elected as Danville's mayor and served for 6 years in this capacity.|$|R
5000|$|After {{tobacco is}} cured, it is {{moved from the}} curing barn into a storage area for processing. If whole plants were cut, the leaves are removed from the tobacco stalks in a process called stripping. For both cut and pulled tobacco, the leaves are then sorted into {{different}} grades. In colonial times, the tobacco was then [...] "prized" [...] into hogsheads for transportation. In <b>bright</b> <b>tobacco</b> regions, prizing was replaced by stacking wrapped [...] "hands" [...] into loose piles to be sold at auction. Today, most cured tobacco is baled before sales are made under pre-sold contracts.|$|E
5000|$|Tobacco can be {{harvested}} in several ways. In the oldest method, the entire plant is harvested at once by {{cutting off the}} stalk at {{the ground with a}} sickle. In the nineteenth century, <b>bright</b> <b>tobacco</b> began to {{be harvested}} by pulling individual leaves off the stalk as they ripened. As the plants grow, they usually require topping and suckering. [...] "Topping" [...] is the removal of the tobacco flowers while [...] "suckering" [...] is the pruning out of leaves that are otherwise unproductive. Both procedures ensure that as much of the plant's energy as possible focuses on producing the large leaves that are harvested and sold. [...] "Cropping", [...] "Pulling", and [...] "Priming" [...] are terms for removing mature leaves from tobacco plants. Leaves are cropped as they ripen, from the bottom {{to the top of the}} stalk.|$|E
50|$|Although the Civil War {{brought an}} end to the {{plantation}} and slave labor economy that had made Granville County prosperous, the agricultural sector continued to thrive in the county due to the presence of free African Americans in Oxford and the discovery of bright leaf tobacco. Many African Americans in Granville County were free {{before the start of the}} Civil War, and they made lasting contributions to the region, particularly through their skilled labor. Several black masons constructed homes for the county’s wealthy landowners. Additionally, the bright leaf tobacco crop proved a successful agricultural product for Granville County. The sandy soil and a new tobacco crop could be “flue-dried” proved a great incentive to farmers and tobacco manufacturers.According to historian William S. Powell, Granville has remained a top tobacco-producing county in North Carolina for several decades. By the late 1800s and early 1900s, Oxford had become a thriving town with new industries, schools, literary institutions, and orphanages forming due to jobs created by the <b>bright</b> <b>tobacco</b> crop.|$|E
50|$|Nancy Witcher Langhorne {{was born}} at the Langhorne House in Danville, Virginia. She was the eighth of eleven {{children}} born to railroad businessman Chiswell Dabney Langhorne and his wife Nancy Witcher Keene. Following the abolition of slavery, Chiswell struggled to make his operations profitable, and with {{the destruction of the}} war, the family lived in near-poverty for several years before Nancy was born. After her birth, her father gained a job as a tobacco auctioneer in Danville, the center of <b>bright</b> leaf <b>tobacco</b> and a major marketing and processing center.|$|R
5000|$|As a young man, Langhorne {{entered the}} Confederate Army {{and served with}} {{distinction}} during the war. Soon after the Civil War, he moved to Danville, Virginia, a major center for <b>bright</b> leaf <b>tobacco.</b> The sale of loose-leaf tobacco by auction on a warehouse floor had originated there just before the Civil War. The practice, which was called the [...] "Danville System", was quickly and widely adopted. It is said that Langhorne originated the auctioneer's fast-talking [...] "chant," [...] which proved very effective at evoking {{a heightened sense of}} bidding, and was also copied everywhere.|$|R
5000|$|A similar failure {{took place}} in the 1920s when the Burley Leaf Tobacco Growers Cooperative Association tried to compete with a monopoly. They also had a deep decline in the price of <b>Bright</b> Leaf <b>Tobacco</b> like the Dark Patch growers. Also similarly, they had a large number of {{voluntary}} membership expressed by a pledge by the growers saying that they would only sell to the Burley Association. [...] The Burley Association would then keep the crop and sell it at an acceptable Price then use the money to pay the producers. This gave successful results, but it was followed by a decline in prices received by the Association and its members.|$|R
50|$|The Australian and Queensland governments, {{together}} with the British-Australian Tobacco Company, jointly funded the Australian Tobacco Investigation Committee to find areas suitable for good quality tobacco growth. As a result, the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Stock tested twenty-five experimental tobacco plots during the 1927-28 season. This occurred in an area from Bowen to Mareeba and west to Pentland and Chillagoe, with one plot tried at Hervey's Range, about 25 miles (40 km) west of Townsville. All of these areas proved successful, producing a <b>bright</b> <b>tobacco</b> with good colour, aroma, texture and aging qualities. Mareeba became the site for a government experimental farm, since its surrounding district contained large areas with the most suitable sandy soils and climactic conditions. During the following two seasons, the Department conducted further trials at this farm, while several areas including Pentland, Charters Towers, Hervey's Range and Chillagoe tried crops on a commercial scale. Despite adverse weather conditions that affected the yield per acre, the leaf obtained good prices, and many people hailed North Queensland as the premier tobacco growing area of Australia.|$|E

2500|$|Brightleaf {{tobacco is}} {{commonly}} known as [...] "Virginia tobacco", often regardless of the state where it is planted. Prior to the American Civil War, most tobacco grown in the US was fire-cured dark-leaf. Sometime after the War of 1812, demand for a milder, lighter, more aromatic tobacco arose. Ohio, Pennsylvania and Maryland all innovated with milder varieties of the tobacco plant. Farmers discovered that <b>Bright</b> leaf <b>tobacco</b> needs thin, starved soil, and those who could not grow other crops found that they could grow tobacco.

25|$|An African slave named Stephan {{changed the}} process of curing the <b>Bright</b> Leaf <b>tobacco</b> variety (a lighter flavored tobacco leaf) by curing it with {{charcoal}} taken from a local blacksmith's fire rather than the usual logwood. This fire burned hotter and faster and accelerated the curing process. The process was refined further to include a furnace in which heat from the charcoal was applied through flues, so that dark soot and off flavors did not {{come in contact with}} the tobacco. This changed the curing process of a lighter leaf and produced a new, lighter tobacco which was able to be inhaled. This, linked together with the British Victorian desire for cigarettes, along with the aforementioned French and other European countries, gave way to an emerging market to minced tobacco. This trend had not yet hit America for its export market.|$|R
40|$|Neonatal California White rabbits were {{sensitized}} with a glycoprotein purified from cured Virginia <b>Bright</b> <b>tobacco</b> leaves.

40|$|The {{globalization}} {{of the tobacco}} production {{has led to a}} drop in competitiveness of the Italian tobacco on the world market. Burley is the main variety of tobacco cropped in Campania region of Southern Italy. Its leaves have to be sewn, in the curing phase. Aim of this work is to show the results of the implementation of a new harvest machine prototype. Basically, the machine used for <b>Bright</b> <b>tobacco,</b> totally mechanical harvested, which doesn’t need to be sewn because it requires an indirect-fire treatment into the curing furnaces. The machine was modified in order to mechanize harvesting of Burley tobacco, and tested on four cultivars of Burley tobacco under three different planting layouts. The Burley tobacco leaves can be harvested mechanically by pulling individual leaves off the stalk; leaves are then sorted and tied in bundles prior to sewing. A mechanical burley tobacco harvesting system was evaluated. This machine consists in realizing a leaves orientation system based on the different weight between the leaf blade and the stalk enhanced by an air flow. The measurements taken were harvest timing, work capacity, and quality standards of the work carried out. The results, in terms of user time, range from 6. 67 h/ha to 7. 80 h/ha while in terms of operational efficiency are between 88 % and 89 %. The average user capacity recorded for the four cultivars is equal to 0. 14 ha/h, a value far from the one recorded for the same harvesting machine used for <b>Bright</b> <b>tobacco</b> (0. 25 ha/h). The harvest timing capacity, range from 0. 51 t/h to 0. 99 t/h. The work productivity goes from 0. 17 t to 0. 33 t per hour of human unit respectively. The average number of detached leaves, depending on the cultivar, has been between 523 and 744. Concerning the leaf orientation, a general percentage of 73 % was achieved...|$|E
40|$|Tobacco {{glycoprotein}} (TGP) ' is a brown, iron-containing {{substance of}} mol wt ca. 18, 000 isolated from saline extracts of flue cured tobacco leaves by ammonium sulfate fractionation, chromatography on Sephadex G- 25, and continuous flow, preparative electrophoresis on alkaline polyacrylamide gel. 12 of 31 volunteers (6 / 15 smokers and 6 / 16 nonsmokers) exhibited immediate cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions characterized by wheal and flare development and local itching when injected intracutaneously with this material. Immunochemically similar material was demonstrated in, and isolated from, cigarette smoke. Antigenically cross-reactive material was also demonstrated in eggplants, green peppers, potatoes, and tomatoes, which like tobacco, {{are members of}} the family Solanaceae (1). The brown color, molecular weight, amino acid analysis, iron content, and presence of carbohydrate moiety in TGP correspond to that of an iron-proteinchlorogenic acid-rutin complex in cured tobacco leaves first reported by Wright et al. (2). Since rutin is chemically similar to quercetin, a substance known to activate factor XII (3), we examined whether TGP isolated from cured Virginia <b>Bright</b> <b>tobacco</b> leaves or from cigarette smoke condensate was capable of activating factor XII in human blood plasma. In experiments described below we demonstrated that TGP derived from cured tobacco leaves or from cigarette smoke condensate contained rutin or a rutin-like substance and activated factor XII in samples of human plasma resulting in the generation of clotting activity, fibrinolytic activity, and kinin activity...|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} if the ATP sulfurylase reaction is a regulatory step for the SO 42 −-assimilation pathway in plants, an Arabidopsis thaliana ATP sulfurylase cDNA, APS 2, was fused to the 35 S promoter of the cauliflower mosaic virus and introduced by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation into isolated <b>Bright</b> Yellow 2 <b>tobacco</b> (Nicotiana tabacum) cells. The ATP sulfurylase activity in transgenic cells was 8 -fold that in control cells, and was correlated with {{the expression of a}} specific polypeptide revealed by western analysis using an anti-ATP sulfurylase antibody. The molecular mass of this polypeptide agreed with that for the overexpressed mature protein. ATP sulfurylase overexpression had no effect on [35 S]SO 42 − influx or ATP sulfurylase activity regulation by S availability, except that ATP sulfurylase activity variations in response to S starvation in transgenic cells were 8 times higher than in the wild type. There were also no differences in cell growth or sensitivity to SeO 42 − (a toxic SO 42 − analog) between transgenic and wild-type cells. We propose that in <b>Bright</b> Yellow 2 <b>tobacco</b> cells, the ATP sulfurylase derepression by S deficiency may involve a posttranscriptional mechanism, and that the ATP sulfurylase abundance is not limiting for cell metabolism...|$|R
40|$|Presently, {{energy costs}} of Virginia <b>Bright</b> <b>tobacco</b> (VBt), {{especially}} for curing, {{are a major}} expense of this crop. To reduce these costs, an anaerobic digestion plant is under construction at Fattoria Autonoma Tabacchi of Città di Castello (PG), {{one of the major}} VBt producers in Central Italy. Digestion is carried out in two digestion tanks where biogas (methane 60 % v/v, carbon dioxide 39 % v/v, and other gases) and digested phase (7 - 10 % w/w DM) are produced. Biogas (470 Nm 3 /h), after purification, is burned in a cogeneration plant to produce electricity (1 MWe) and heat (2. 6 thermal MWh). Some 4 - 500 ha of maize and triticale silages are grown as feedstocks for the plant in nearby growers’ soils. Heat is planned to be used in several ways: (i) to warm up waters of tobacco float system nurseries, also to extend their use in cold season to produce turfgrass sods; (ii) to pre-heat air entering into the curing chambers, in order to contain energy costs; (iii) to dishydrate and stabilize the digested phase to 35 % w/w DM. Both liquid and “solid” digested phases are delivered to soils where silage crops are grown, as organic fertilizers. Some of the water phase (0. 2 % N plus K, and trace elements) is reused in the first step of the digestion or delivered to nurseries, but the largest part is applied in fertigation to crops during Summer droughty season...|$|E
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} interest toward non-chemical inputs for tobacco, and the other major crops, {{in order to minimize}} leaf residues, manpower safety, environmental hazard, and crop footprint. Increasing costs of phosphate fertilizers, and reduced nematicide options under agro-environmental measures regulated cropping practices (so-called PSR 2007 - 2013 plan) in EU have made growers particularly concerned about present and future availability, and permission of use, of ordinary agrochemicals. Natural chestnut tannins (NCT), hot water-extracted from untreated wood, and membrane-concentrated to 17 % DM, were investigated as a natural alternative for their starter effect and nemastat activity (Meloidogyne spp.). Extensive field tests on Virginia <b>Bright</b> <b>tobacco</b> were carried out in 2011 at Fattoria Autonoma Tabacchi of Città di Castello, under different conditions (soils and tobacco cvs.). Tests compared NCT with ordinary treatments, to investigate effect and costs of the different options. Early applications of NCT: in transplant water, or in mixture with the at-planting herbicide, or by other localized application methods, give an interesting starter effect, comparable to an ordinary fertilizer treatment. When conditions were prone to nematode attacks, results indicated that NCT, applied as the previosly indicated treatments and microirrigation, determined a good control at costs comparable or better than ordinary agrochemicals. NCT is presently labeled in Italy as a natural soil and water corrective, with claims on their starter effect and nemastat action as secondary effects.

Chemical analysis of the 2 tobaccos and 2 condensates revealed only small differences in composition and {{it is noteworthy that}} the concentration of reducing sugars was almost as high as in the AC tobacco as in the FC tobacco. The risk of development of skin tumours, particularly malignant skin tumours, was higher in FC-treated mice than in AC-treated mice (p < 0. 01), but the difference may have been due to the use of equal weights of condensates rather than the use of extracts from equal numbers of cigarettes, since the AC cigarettes produced more condensate. The rates of detection of pulmonary tumours also varied between groups (p < 0. 01) but this does not necessarily imply that the incidence rates of pulmonary tumours varied. There was no evidence that the detection or incidence rates of any other neoplasms, including malignant lymphoma, were affected by treatment with either of the condensates...|$|E
