5000|$|... ==Denominate numbers== Denominate {{numbers are}} further {{classified}} as either simple, meaning a single unit is given, or compound, meaning multiple units are given. For example, 6 kg {{is a simple}} denominant number, while 324 yards 1 foot 8 inches is a compound denominate number. The process of converting a denominate numbers to an equivalent form that uses a different unit is called reduction. More specifically, reduction to a lower or higher unit of measurement is called reduction to lower or higher denominations. Reduction to a lower denomination is accomplished by multiplying {{by the number of}} lower units contained in each higher unit. In the case of a compound denominant number, the products are then added together. For example, 1 hour 23 minutes 20 seconds is 1 h × 3600 s/h + 23 min × 60 s/min + 20 s = 5000 seconds. Similarly, a division is used to reduce to a higher denomination, and remainders {{can be applied to the}} next highest unit to form compound denominant numbers. Addition and subtraction of compound numbers can be performed by grouping the amounts associated with each unit and performing the necessary carry and <b>borrow</b> <b>operations.</b> Multiplication and division by a pure number are again similar.|$|R

40|$|Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) is a {{very active}} {{research}} area. One reason being that finite domain CLP systems have been successfully applied to various combinatorial optimization problems such as time tabling, scheduling, frequency allocation, manpower planning, production planning. State of the art finite domain CLP languages offer programming constructs that gives access {{to the state of}} the constraint solver. With these constructs, new constraints can be defined in the CLP language directly, hence the name "glass-box". However, current glass box approaches do not give access to the constraints themselves. This prevents the use of sophisticated constraint solving techniques <b>borrowed</b> from <b>Operations</b> Research. In order to overcome this limitation, we propose to give acces to the constraints as first class citizen of the CLP language.

We make this new class of applications amenable to constraint programming.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a financial statement analysis that distinguishes leverage that arises in financing activities from leverage that arises in operations. The analysis yields two leveraging equations, one for <b>borrowing</b> to finance <b>operations</b> {{and one for}} borrowing {{in the course of}} operations. These leveraging equations describe how the two types of leverage affect book rates of return on equity. An empirical analysis shows that the financial statement analysis explains cross-sectional differences in current and future rates of return as well as price-to-book ratios, which are based on expected rates of return on equity. The paper therefore concludes that balance sheet line items for operating liabilities are priced differently than those dealing with financing liabilities. Accordingly, financial statement analysis that distinguishes the two types of liabilities informs on future profitability and aids in the evaluation of appropriate price-to-book ratios...|$|R

40|$|Energy-economy {{optimization}} models - encoded {{with a set}} of structured, self-consistent {{assumptions and}} decision rules - have emerged as a key tool for the analysis of energy and climate policy at the national and international scale. Given the expansive system boundaries and multi-decadal timescales involved, addressing future uncertainty in these models is a critical challenge. The approach taken by many modelers is to build larger models with greater complexity to deal with structural uncertainty, and run a few highly detailed scenarios under different input assumptions to address parametric uncertainty. The result is often large and inflexible models used to conduct analysis that offers little insight. This paper introduces a technique <b>borrowed</b> from the <b>operations</b> research literature called modeling to generate alternatives (MGA) as a way to flex energy models and systematically explore the feasible, near-optimal solution space in order to develop alternatives that are maximally different in decision space but perform well with regard to the modeled objectives.

40|$|Mass hauling {{operations}} play central {{roles in}} construction projects. They typically use many haulers that consume {{large amounts of}} energy and emit signiﬁcant quantities of CO 2. However, practical methods for estimating the energy consumption and CO 2 emissions of such operations during the project planning stage are scarce, {{while most of the}} previous methods focus on construction stage or after the construction stages which limited the practical adoption of reduction strategy in the early planning phase. This paper presents a detailed model for estimating the energy consumption and CO 2 emissions of mass haulers that integrates the mass hauling plan with a set of predictive equations. The mass hauling plan is generated using a planning program such as DynaRoad in conjunction with data on the productivity of selected haulers and the amount of material to be hauled during cutting, ﬁlling, <b>borrowing,</b> and disposal <b>operations.</b> This plan is then used as input for estimating the energy consumption and CO 2 emissions of the selected hauling ﬂeet. The proposed model will help planners to assess the energy and environmental performance of mass hauling plans, and to select hauler and ﬂeet conﬁgurations that will minimize these quantities.
