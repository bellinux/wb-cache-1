25|$|On August 18, 2009, The Guardian {{reported}} that a forthcoming documentary, Coming <b>Back</b> <b>for</b> <b>More</b> by Dutch director Willem Alkema, claims Stone is homeless and living off welfare while staying in cheap hotels and a campervan. The film alleges that Stone's former manager, Jerry Goldstein, cut off his access to royalty payments following a dispute over a 'debt agreement', forcing Stone to depend on welfare payments. On September 25, 2011, Alkema wrote in the New York Post that Stone was homeless {{and living in a}} van in the Crenshaw neighborhood of Los Angeles, although a subsequent report by Roger Friedman of Showbiz411 stated that Stone is not homeless, and lives in the van by choice.|$|E
25|$|What {{disturbs}} Delano are incidents {{he observes}} among the hatchet polishers, oakum pickers, {{such as when}} a black boy stabs a white one. Apparently Cereno does not care about this behavior, not even when Atufal, a regal-looking slave appears in chains but still refusing to humble himself. The whispering between Cereno and Babo makes Delano feel uncomfortable. Gradually his suspicions increase, as he notes Cereno's sudden waves of dizziness and anxiety, the crew's awkward movements and whisperings, and the unusual interaction of the slaves and the whites. Yet Delano answers Cereno’s questions about the crew, cargo, and arms aboard the Bachelor’s Delight without reserve, reasoning that the innocent are protected by the truth. When The Rover arrives with the supplies, Delano sends her <b>back</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> water while he continues to observe curious incidents.|$|E

25|$|By the 980s {{the kings}} of Wessex had a {{powerful}} grip on the coinage of the realm. It is reckoned there were about 300 moneyers, and 60 mints, around the country. Every {{five or six years}} the coinage in circulation would cease to be legal tender and new coins were issued. The system controlling the currency around the country was extremely sophisticated; this enabled the king to raise large sums of money if needed. The ability to raise large sums of money was needed after the battle of Maldon, as Æthelred decided that, rather than fight, he would pay ransom to the Danes in a system known as Danegeld. As part of the ransom, a peace treaty was drawn up that was intended to stop the raids. However, rather than buying the Vikings off, payment of Danegeld only encouraged them to come <b>back</b> <b>for</b> <b>more.</b>|$|E
25|$|As the Dubois Brothers {{continued}} to make money and become wealthier they realized that the highest profits were {{in the drug trade}} realizing that a drug, especially methamphetamine, were cheap enough to get and highly addictive and once a customer was hooked they could not resist coming <b>back</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> creating a customer base. One of their previous drug pushers stated that the Dubois Brothers could get a pound of marijuana for $30 imported from Mexico and were able to sell it on the streets for up to $750 making a major profit. The Dubois Brothers, more specifically Adrien, Claude and Roland, had branched off logically into drug trafficking in the mid 70s and were controlling, in the west end and city center of Montreal, the sales of marijuana, hashish, LSD, amphetamines, and cocaine. They had a web of dealers set up to distribute the drugs all of which were working in licensed establishments under the control of {{at least one of the}} Brothers. Montreal police were able to seize a drug distribution for the Dubois Brothers that consisted of nearly two million tenure pills in late 1973 to early 1974. The Brothers took it one step further by going continental when they began having roots in Pakistan because Adrien Dubois decided to introduce a Sixth Family associate to his impressive source of hashish through a corrupt government official in Pakistan who had a ministerial position and thrived for foreign currency. The Dubois Brothers were always thirsty for more territory and money and that is what lead them to the McSween Turf War.|$|E

500|$|In December 1940, the War Exchange Conservation Act was passed. [...] It {{restricted}} {{the importation of}} goods from the US that were deemed non-essential to combat the trade deficit Canada had with its neighbours to the south. [...] American comic books were casualties of the Act. [...] In 1941, to fill the void, a number of Canadian comic book publishers sprang up, starting in March with Anglo-American Publishing in Toronto and Maple Leaf Publishing in Vancouver. Adrian Dingle's Hillborough Studios and Bell Features soon joined them. [...] The comics printed by these companies had colour covers, but the innards were in black-and-white, and thus collectors call them Canadian Whites.

She wore a Classical Greece-inspired costume, designed by Italian designer duo Dolce and Gabbana, which consisted of a white corseted dress, golden [...] "gladiator" [...] sandals, and a headpiece with feathers attached to the ears. Her appearance resembled that of a [...] "winged messenger".

500|$|The {{company was}} soon in action. Cherry's section {{captured}} a large fortified farm {{on the edge}} of the village. As they entered the muddy main street, the Australians came under heavy fire from the houses lining the road and from an adjacent stable yard. Cherry [...] "rushed the stable yard" [...] and a fierce firefight developed, before the Germans surrendered. As Cherry and his men moved through Lagnicourt, they found the main resistance coming from a large chalky crater, [...] "spotted with white chalk", at the crossroads in the village centre. The Germans' stout defence was holding up the advance and Cherry sent a messenger <b>back</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> Stokes mortars. Becoming impatient at the delay, Cherry decided to rush the position under the cover of Lewis Gun and rifle grenade fire. Capturing the crater, he found Lieutenant Harold Hereward Bieske at the bottom wounded. Bieske had taken over command of the second section when Lieutenant Hamilton was wounded, and it had now been reduced to six men.|$|E

Rikky Rooksby, author of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna noted the track ended with the line [...] "This is my religion", indicating the spiritual thoughts and themes present in Ray of Light. According to Lucy O'Brien, author of , the lyrics touched upon Madonna's own desire for fame and how it ultimately ruined her personal relationships, thereby [...] " [...] the tone for the album". Madonna explained in an interview with Q in 1998 that the lyrics showed her ambivalence towards fame and love.

500|$|At {{the time}} of its first release, Lemmings {{received}} several high scores from gaming magazines, with only the level of graphics and sound receiving some small amount of criticism. David Sears of Compute!, in his review of Lemmings for the PC, stated that [...] "perhaps Psygnosis has tapped into the human instinct for survival in formulating this perfect blend of puzzle, strategy, and action." [...] Amiga Computing stated that [...] "Lemmings is absolutely brilliant.

500|$|Loutit, Lieutenant J. Haig of the 10th, and thirty-two {{men from}} the 9th, 10th, and 11th Battalions crossed Legge Valley and climbed a spur of Gun Ridge, just {{to the south of}} Scrubby Knoll. As they reached the top, about [...] further inland was Gun Ridge, defended by a large number of Turkish troops. Loutit and two men carried out a {{reconnaissance}} of Scrubby Knoll, from the top of which they could see the Dardanelles, around [...] to the east. When one of the men was wounded they returned to the rest of their group, which was being engaged by Turkish machine-gun and rifle fire. Around 08:00, Loutit sent a man back for reinforcements; he located Captain J. Ryder of the 9th Battalion, with half a company of men at Lone Pine. Ryder had not received the order to dig in, so he advanced and formed a line on Loutit's right. Soon after, they came under fire from Scrubby Knoll and were in danger of being cut off; Ryder sent a message <b>back</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> reinforcements. The messenger located Captain John Peck, the 11th Battalion's adjutant, who collected all the men around him and went forward to reinforce Ryder. It was now 09:30 and the men on the spur, outflanked by the Turks, had started to withdraw. At 10:00 the Turks set up a machine-gun on the spur and opened fire on the withdrawing Australians. Pursued by the Turks, only eleven survivors, including Loutit and Haig, reached Johnston's Jolly and took cover. Further back, two companies of the 9th and the 10th Battalions had started digging a trench line.|$|E
