2500|$|Maimonides {{taught that}} the {{prerogative}} to sanctify the New Moon at its sighting {{and to set}} a leap year to reconcile the calendar applied to the Sanhedrin in the Land of Israel. Maimonides taught that this {{was derived from the}} command given Moses and Aaron in [...] "This month shall <b>be</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> the first of months," [...] which Maimonides reported the Oral Tradition interpreted to mean that this testimony was entrusted to Moses and Aaron and those sages who arose after them who functioned in their position. When the Sanhedrin ended in the Land of Israel, Jews established the monthly calendar and instituted leap years solely according to the fixed calendar that is followed now. So the sighting of the moon is no longer of any consequence.|$|E
