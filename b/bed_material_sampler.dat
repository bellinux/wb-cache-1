40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} key {{observations on}} the role of limestone in preventing bed agglomeration during combustion of a high-phosphorous fuel in CFB boilers. Composition of the <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> <b>samples</b> was analyzed using X-ray fluorescence, and scanning electron microscope combined with an energy dispersive X-ray analyzer (SEM/EDXA). It has been demonstrated that during combustion of the high-phosphorous fuel in CFB conditions, addition of limestone reduces or prevents bed agglomeration and formation of slag by interfering with the ash chemistry, and not by simple dilution of the reacting system. The role of limestone can be summarized as: 1) to provide calcium for the reaction with phosphorous forming high-temperature-melting calcium phosphates instead of low-temperature-melting potassium phosphates, and 2) to coat silica particles preventing the reaction of potassium (calcium) phosphates and silica from fluidizing sand, which can form low-temperature-melting potassium (calcium) silicates, especially relevant for fluidized bed combustion conditions...|$|R

Several two component fuel blends were tested under different combustion conditions to study how primary fuel substitution by MBM affects flue gas emissions as well as fluidised bed (FB) agglomeration tendency. MBM, being a highly volatile fuel, caused significant increase of CO emissions and secondary air {{should be used in}} industrial scale applications to conform to regulations. The high N-content of MBM is moderately reflected on the increase of nitrogen oxides emissions, which are reduced by MBM derived volatiles. The MBM ash, although containing bone material rich in Ca. did not create any noteworthy desulphurisation effect. The observed slight decrease in SO 2 emissions is predominantly attributed to the lower Sulphur content in the coal/MBM fuel mixtures. The experimental work is evaluated with bed agglomeration indices from literature. The SEMYEDS analysis of <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> <b>samples</b> from the coal/MBM tests revealed the formation of conglomerates of <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> debris and ash with sizes that do not greatly exceed the original bed inventory and thus are not problematic. On the contrary, the co-combustion tests of olive bagasse residues with MBM led to a prompt loss of fluidisation, {{as a consequence of the}} high potassium and silicon content of the olive bagasse, the chlorine contents in both MBM and olive bagasse, and the high phosphorus content in the MBM also forming eutectics with potassium.

40|$|The Reno R., as {{many other}} Italian rivers, has been {{significantly}} affected by man activity since Romans time, {{but in the last}} decades significant land use changes in the headwater, extensive <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> mining, dams construction, torrent-control works and large fluids extraction from the underground caused important channel morphology and sediment fluxes changes. To better understand such morphological changes and their causes, the hydraulic geometry data of several cross sections and the longitudinal profile data of the Reno river, surveyed at different times, were analysed emphasizing a dramatic streambed incision that took place between 1950 s and 1980 s, with a volume of sediment lost of about 18 x 106 m 3.

40|$|Besides {{producing}} a carbon-neutral gas suitable for several applications, gasification of biomass in fluidized beds also {{leads to the}} formation of aromatic hydrocarbon compounds (tars). When condensing the gas, tars are plugging pipes and other process equipment which increases the need of high-cost gas cleaning systems. The aim of this thesis was to improve the understanding of how tar compounds can be decomposed by using catalytically active <b>bed</b> <b>materials.</b> Earlier studies concluded a significant increase of reactivity by using <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> with outer layers rich in calcium. In this study, several materials with outer calcium-enriched layers were compared with fresh, non-coated, materials. The materials catalytic performances were investigated in a fluidized bed lab-scale reactor by applying two reactions; water-gas shift and steam reforming of a model tar compound. The materials investigated in the water-gas shift reaction were two fresh samples and five coated samples. The fresh samples were silatherm (aluminosilicate) and k feldspar (potassium aluminum silicate), and the coated <b>materials</b> were three <b>samples</b> of quartz sand and two samples of impurities. The quartz sand samples were gathered from different fluidized bed combustion plants while the impurities samples were gathered from one fluidized bed gasification plant and further separated from olivine particles. 1 H-indene was used as model tar compound in the steam reforming reaction, where four <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> <b>samples</b> with varying calcium-layer thickness were investigated. From the experiments with water-gas shift reaction the catalytic enhancement was proved by using calcium-enriched materials. Similar gas compositions could be measured for two of the three quartz sand samples. The third sample showed a lower catalytic activity due to a thinner outer layer of calcium. The two samples of impurities showed the highest catalytic activity of all investigated materials. At a temperature of 850 °C the maximum carbon conversion was 42 % for one of the impurities samples. At the same temperature the corresponding CO conversion for k-feldspar was 0, 6 %. Silatherm had a slightly increased CO conversion compared to k-feldspar, but the catalytic performances of the fresh materials are significantly lower compared to the coated materials. In the steam reforming reaction, 98, 9 % of 1 H-indene were decomposed in the reaction when a calcium oxide was used as <b>bed</b> <b>material.</b> In contrary, 0 % of 1 H-indene was decomposed when feldspar was used. From the experimental results it can be concluded that the materials coated with outer layers rich in calcium had excellent catalytic performance compared to the fresh materials. Although further investigations must be conducted, it can be confirmed that calcium is a component which significantly increases the decomposition of tars in fluidized bed gasification processes.

40|$|Recently, the use {{of algae}} for CO 2 abatement, {{wastewater}} treatment, and energy production has increasingly gained attention worldwide. In order to explore the potential of using algae as an alternative fuel {{as well as the}} possible challenges related to the algae gasification process, two species of macroalgae, Derbesia tenuissima and Oedogonium sp., and one type of microalgae, Scenedesmus sp. were studied in this research. In this work, Oedogonium sp. was cultivated with two protocols: producing biomass with both high and low levels of nitrogen content. Cogasification of 10 wt % algae with an Australian brown coal was performed in a fluidized bed reactor, and the effects of algae addition on syngas yield, ash composition, and bed agglomeration were investigated. It was found that CO and H 2 yield increased and CO 2 yield decreased after adding three types of macroalgae in the coal, with a slight increase of carbon conversion rate, compared to the coal alone experiment. In the case of coal/Scenedesmus sp, the carbon conversion rate decreased with lower CO/CO 2 /H 2 yield as compared to coal alone. Samples of fly ash, bed ash, and <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> agglomerates were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy combined with an energy dispersive X-ray detector (SEM-EDX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). It was observed that both the fly ash and bed ash samples from all coal/macroalgae tests contained more Na and K as compared to the coal test. High Ca and Fe contents were also found in the fly ash and bed ash from the coal/Scenedesmus sp. test. Significant differences in the characteristics and compositions of the ash layer on the bed particles were observed from the different tests. Agglomerates were found in the <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> <b>samples</b> after the cogasification tests of coal/Oedogonium N+ and coal/Oedogonium N−. The formation of liquid alkali−silicates on the sand particles was considered to be the main reason for agglomeration for the coal/Oedogonium N+ and coal/Oedogonium N− tests. Agglomerates of fused ash and tiny silica sand particles were also found in the coal/Scenedesmus sp. test. In this case, however, the formation of a Fe−Al silicate eutectic mixture was proposed to be the main reason for agglomeration. Debersia was suggested to be a potential alternative fuel, which can be cogasified with brown coal without any significant operating problems under the current experimental conditions. However, for the other algae types, appropriate countermeasures are needed to avoid agglomeration and defluidization in the cogasification process...|$|R

Findings demonstrate that vertical disturbances typically in the form of headcuts frequently extend well beyond the backwater limits of most reservoirs.

Findings show that if the grain size distributions of the underlying alluvial geologic units are close to that of critical velocity thresholds, when headcuts are initiated (with their resulting increase in friction slope), they can result in continued channel degradation upstream of impoundment regions...|$|R
40|$|The Reno River is the {{eleventh}} largest river in Italy. It {{has been extensively}} affected by man activity {{for a very long}} span of time. The first relevant impacts date back to the Romans time and were reiterated with more or less intensity until present. During the last five centuries, the lowland portion of the river was subjected to remarkable channel modifications, diversion, levee construction, reclamation of the this portion of the Po plain. In the recent decades, mainly after World War II, significant changes in land use and management in the mountain portion of the catchment, extensive exploitation of the streambed material, the construction of a sluice gate for irrigation purposes a few kilometres upstream of the river mouth and large withdrawal of fluids from the underground caused important channel and sediment budget changes. Three main effects of such human impacts are evident: a remarkable streambed degradation (as much as 5 m during the last 60 years), the reduction to a hard to detect quantity of bedload flux and, consequently, a worrying beach erosion that is rapidly retreating along a vast portion of the Adriatic coast fed by the Reno R., that is an important tourist resort and economic resource for the region. In order to understand such morphological changes, their causes and, possibly, to envisage some solutions a field campaign of sediment transport measurement was started in 2003 and it is still in progress. To get a clearer picture of the present situation also <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> <b>samples</b> were taken along the alluvial plain, lower reach of the Reno R. and the hydraulic geometry data of hundreds of cross sections, surveyed at different times, were analysed to quantify the streambed degradation and the channel morphology changes.

In this paper, three species of algae, including a fresh water macroalgae, Oedogonium sp., a saltwater macroalgae, Derbersia tenuissima, and a microalgae species, Scenedesmus sp., were studied to explore the potential of using smaller amounts of algae fuels in blends with traditional woody biomasses in the gasification processes. Co-gasification of 10 wt % algae and 90 wt % Swedish wood pellets was performed in a fluidized bed reactor. The effects of algae addition on the syngas yield and carbon conversion rate were investigated. The addition of 10 wt % algae in wood increased the CO, H 2, and CH 4 yields by 3 – 20, 6 – 31, and 9 – 20 %, respectively. At the same time, it decreased the CO 2 yield by 3 – 18 %. The carbon conversion rates were slightly increased with the addition of 10 wt % macroalgae in wood, but the microalgae addition resulted in a decrease of the carbon conversion rate by 8 %. Meanwhile, the collected fly ash and <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> <b>samples</b> were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy combined with an energy-dispersive X-ray detector (SEM–EDX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique. The fly ashes of wood/marcoalgae tests showed a higher Na content with lower Si and Ca contents compared to the wood test. The gasification tests were scheduled to last 4 h; however, only wood and wood/Derbersia gasification experiments were carried out without significant operational problems. The gasification of 10 wt % Oedogonium N+ and Oedogonium N– led to defluidization of the bed in less than 1 h, and the wood/Scenedesmus (WD/SA) test was stopped after 1. 8 h as a result of severe agglomeration. It was found that the algae addition had a remarkable influence on the characteristics and compositions of the coating layer. The coating layer formation and bed agglomeration mechanism of wood/macroalgae was initiated by the reaction of alkali compounds with the bed particles to form low-temperature melting silicates (inner layer). For the WD/SA test, the agglomeration was influenced by both the composition of the original algae fuel as well as the external mineral contaminations. In summary, the operational problems experienced during the co-gasification tests of different algae–wood mixtures were assigned to the specific ash compositions of the different fuel mixtures. This showed the need for countermeasures, specifically to balance the high alkali content, to reach stable operation in a fluidized bed gasifier.

40|$|Graduation date: 1981 A {{descriptive}} {{model of}} <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> routing {{was developed for}} alluvial streams exhibiting sequences of pools and armored riffles. The model assumes that channel geometry, sediment transport competence {{and the availability of}} sediments for transport are all non-uniform in the downstream direction. Bedload transport is described as occurring in two relatively distinct phases. Phase I involves the transport of predominantly sand-sized <b>bed</b> <b>materials</b> over stable riffles. Phase II occurs at flows which are greater than those required to entrain riffle armor and involves the transport of riffle sediments in addition to Phase I sediments. Phase I bedload transport was sampled during three high flow events at Flynn Creek, a 2 km², third order drainage in the Oregon Coast Range and at Huntington Creek in the Wasatch Plateau of central Utah during a controlled release of water from Electric Lake reservoir. A power relationship existed between Phase I bedload transport and discharge at Flynn Creek. The relationship was consistent between storms and between years. At Huntington Creek, Phase I bedload transport correlated with discharge on the rising limb of the hydrograph, but transport rates decreased over time at constant discharge, indicating a sediment supply control over Phase I transport. Phase II bedload transport was sampled at Flynn Creek during a 1. 8 year return period streamflow event in February, 1979. Bedload transport rates were closely correlated with the storage and release of <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> from the riffle at the bedload sampling cross section; transport peaks corresponded to periods of scour and large decreases in transport occurred during periods of deposition. Particle size analysis of the <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> in transport showed as much as a 12 -fold increase in the transport of large (> 12. 5 mm diameter) <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> during periods of riffle scour. Phase II transport, which involves rapid scour and redeposition of riffles, can be described as highly non-uniform in a downstream direction and highly unsteady at any point over time. At Flynn Creek, significant scour and redeposition of riffles can be expected to occur on an average of once every one to two years. Corresponding to the two phases of bedload transport are two processes which result in changes in the particle size composition of riffle sediments. First, the intrusion of fine sediments into the pore spaces of stable riffles dominates during Phase I transport. Second, the deposition of entirely new riffle features occurs during Phase II transport. Deposition is often associated with one or more streambed scour and fill sequences and is the direct result of instantaneous differences in sediment transport rates between different channel locations. The particle size gradation of riffles is determined primarily by <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> deposition. <b>Sampling</b> at Flynn Creek indicated that a riffle contains the range of sediment sizes found in transport at the time of deposition but, over all, is more coarse than the particle size distribution of sediment in transport. In flume studies of the deposition process, riffle composition was shown {{to be sensitive to the}} rate of sediment transport at the time of deposition [...] becoming more coarse at lower transport rates. Small but significant (p = 0. 95) decreases in the median particle diameter of riffle sediments resulted as the sediment mixture in transport increased from a 1 : 1 to a 5 : 1 sand-to-gravel ratio. Flume studies showed the intrusion process to be selective towards finer sediments which cannot be filtered by the riffle sediment matrix. Intrusion may decrease or even cease if filterable sediments block surface pores in riffle substrate. Intrusion, if it occurs, is a function of two factors: (1) the pore size distribution of the stable riffle feature, and (2) the particle size distribution and concentration of suspended and Phase I bedload sediments in transport immediately above the streambed...|$|R
40|$|This review {{highlights}} the importance of the <b>bedding</b> <b>material</b> for dairy cows in cubicle systems. The aim was to examine how different types of <b>bedding</b> <b>materials</b> affects dairy cow health and welfare in cubicle systems. To answer the questions studies have been gathered in a summary. Dairy cows can suffer from production diseases, such as lameness or mastitis. These diseases are consequences of high milk yields and environmental factors. The choice of housing system, and particularly lying surface and <b>bedding</b> <b>material,</b> is important for the comfort, health and welfare of the cow. In cubicle systems, a combination of a thick mattress and plenty of <b>bedding</b> <b>material</b> create optimal conditions. The cow can adapt to the lying surface and/or <b>bedding</b> <b>materials</b> that are offered but longer resting periods and fewer hock lesions are seen if the cubicles are provided with large amounts of <b>bedding</b> <b>material.</b> Even more important is that the bedding is dry; cows do not want to lie down on wet bedding, which contributes to increased stress for the animals. There are various types of <b>bedding</b> <b>material</b> used in cubicle systems. In Sweden these are straw (usually cut or shredded), sawdust, wood shavings, sand and peat. In recent years recycled dried manure has appeared as an alternative <b>bedding</b> <b>material</b> in Europe. <b>Bedding</b> has several functions. However, <b>bedding</b> <b>materials</b> may also have disadvantages. Some may increase the risk of mastitis, either by containing microbes or stimulating bacterial growth. Mastitis disrupts production and reduces welfare. In order to maximise the cow's welfare, materials that increase the risk of disease and injury should, if possible, not be used. The conclusion based on this review is that different types of <b>bedding</b> <b>materials</b> clearly have pros and cons regarding cowcomfort and health. The choice of <b>bedding</b> <b>material,</b> quantity and quality are important to cow's welfare. Additionally, management routines and lying-place hygiene contribute to cow health which is highlighted in several studies...|$|R
40|$|The Waipaoa River, East Cape, New Zealand, drains a {{catchment}} {{from the}} Raukumara Ranges into Poverty Bay, near Gisborne. Conversion of the catchment from indigenous forest to pasture, between 1880 - 1920, initiated {{a phase of}} intense erosion in the hill country. The underlying geology consists of crushed and sheared sandstone, siltstone, argillite, and mudstone of Cretaceous and Tertiary age. Channel aggradation occurred {{in response to the}} influx of <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> load. Suspended sediment yields in headwater catchments are as high as 7 000 – 17 000 t km. For the period 1948 to 1988, aggradation in the upper reaches was > 5 m, while in the lower reaches it was ~ 0. 5 m. The Waipaoa River is a gravel-bed river. Its morphology changes from a braided to a meandering configuration in the downstream direction. A <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> survey of the Waipaoa River in 1995 / 6 investigated the fluvial transfer of coarse <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> through the river system. Bed <b>material</b> <b>samples</b> were collected at 1 km intervals along the mainstem, as well as from major tributaries, near their confluence with the Waipaoa River. Surface and subsurface samples were systematically collected between the coast and 104 km upstream. The results of this survey were compared with earlier <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> surveys undertaken in 1950, 1956, and 1960. Results of the 1996 <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> survey indicate that the <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> in the Waipaoa River is polymodal. The gravel-sand transition occurs approximately 8 km upriver from the coast. Over the remaining 96 km reach, the median particle size declined from 5 mm in the headwaters, to 2 mm near the coast. The coarser particle size fractions exhibited a greater rate of downstream fining, and, over the same distance, the coarsest 10 % declined from 48 mm to 6 mm. The <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> is dominated by fine sediment, which is illustrated by the fine median particle size over the length of the river, as well as the low fining coefficients for the finer particle size fractions. No downstream change in the proportion of each main pebble lithology was observed, and each pebble lithology exhibited a similar rate of downstream fining. No downstream alteration in particle shape was observed, although particle roundness did increase downstream. Close relationships were observed between the bed slope and particle size. The highest degree of correlation was observed between slope and the coarsest particle size fractions, representing the limiting condition of channel competence. Selective transport is the dominant process that produces downstream fining in the Waipaoa River, however, particle fragmentation, sediment supply or abrasion may be important processes within specific reaches. The rate of downstream fining was consistent for the period 1948 to 1996...|$|R

40|$|Sediment {{replenishment}} {{is one of}} {{the effective}} methods to prevent a sediment deficiency and detaching overgrowing algae in downstream reaches of dams. In this study, we examined the effect on a <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> size and algal biomass based on data measured in Futase dam. We assumed that algae detaches from the <b>bed</b> <b>materials</b> when the <b>bed</b> <b>materials</b> are moved by flow. So, threshold <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> size in motion Dcri for a given τ is calculated. The result showed that in winter, algal biomass was very high if flow was constantly low (No. 1). However, other result showed that the algal biomass was not so high if Dcri was temporally high (No. 2). This is probably because the <b>bed</b> <b>materials</b> of No. 2 were finer and easier to move by flow than those of No. 1. Thus, sediment replenishment promotes detachment of algae not only by enhancing sediment transport during major floods but also by covering riverbed with fine <b>materials</b> and reducing <b>bed</b> stability in winter...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Banks of the Illinois River {{have been}} eroding because {{of natural and}} {{man-made}} acts. In many places the erosion is very severe, in other places the banks are stable. The bank erosion of the river was investigated in detail {{and the results are}} presented in this report. Field inspection of the river from Joliet to Grafton was made. Extensive <b>bed</b> and bank <b>material</b> <b>samples</b> were collected and grain size distributions were determined. Plan views of 20 selected reaches were developed and the bank slopes at these reaches were determined. Hydraulic parameters were either computed or estimated, and the stability of the banks at all 20 locations was tested following accepted methods and techniques in hydraulics. The stability analysis was done for discharges with and without ad-ditional Lake Michigan diversions for three typical water years. In general, the silty, sandy, and clayey materials of these severely eroded banks should be stable against the action of tractive force and flow velocity. However, preliminary computations indicated that the banks are unstable as far as the wind-generated wave action is concerned. It is suspected that river traffic-generated wave action also has a similar effect. A monitoring program is outlined, and a future research project related to the wave action on the banks is suggested...|$|R

40|$|Dual Fluidized Bed (DFB) {{gasification}} is one {{alternative for}} the production of biofuels. In a DFB gasification process, the <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> plays a crucial role. Primary role of the <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> is to provide the heat needed for the gasification reaction. If the <b>bed</b> <b>material,</b> used in the system, is catalytically active it can improve the quality of the produced gas. In addition, inorganics originate from the biomass are retained in the system in the form of ash, which interacts with the <b>bed</b> <b>material,</b> thus representing catalytic potential. As a consequence of being circulated between oxidative and reductive environments, the <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> releases some inorganics into the gas phase, thereby influencing the final composition of the produced gas. The goal of the present work is to increase our understanding as to how changes in the <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> related to reactions with ash components can be utilized to improve the performance of the system. In this way, {{it should be possible to}} optimize the gasification step, thereby decreasing the cost of biofuel production. Moreover, by choosing naturally occurring <b>bed</b> <b>materials</b> not only the cost of the process is decreased, but also negative impact on the environment which comes with the disposal of the material. This work deals with the application of catalytic <b>bed</b> <b>materials</b> in dual fluidized bed systems, both as a primary measure in the gasification process itself and as a secondary measure for the reforming of the raw gas. Applied directly in the gasification step, the <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> interacts with the inorganics derived from the fuel. As a result of this interaction, the <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> changes its physical and chemical properties, which has impacts for the gasification process. In the present study, four naturally occurring materials were evaluated. In the Chalmers 2 – 4 -MWth gasifier, the effects on the gasification process of interactions between the ash and the <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> were studied for quartz-sand and olivine. The effects on the process were evaluated with respect to: 1) the composition of the produced gas; 2) tar content; and 3) the physicochemical properties of the <b>bed</b> <b>material.</b> The studies yield information about the transport of inorganics between the reactors and their influences on the gas composition. Whereas the release of alkali during gasification implies a potential for enhancement of the gas quality, the presence of these same species represents a risk for agglomeration during combustion. In the Chalmers 12 –MWth boiler, ilmenite was tested as the <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> and as an alkali getter material. The adsorption of potassium to the ilmenite is shown to be non-reversible, and ilmenite shows great promise as a <b>material</b> for decreasing <b>bed</b> agglomeration in fluidized bed boilers. As a secondary measure, downstream of the gasifier, manganese ore was evaluated for its tar-reforming capability in a dual fluidized bed reactor system, in a process known as chemical looping reforming. This material has the ability to reduce tar levels by as much as 72 %, while having high activity towards hydrogen production...|$|R
40|$|The {{most widely}} used <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> in the {{existing}} fluidized bed systems is silica sand. Upon burning fuels with high alkali content, such as biomass, in a bed of silica sand, alkali silicates are formed as molten glassy phase that easily stick and form agglomerates, defluidization of the reactor and unplanned operational stops. Several materials have been tested as alternative <b>bed</b> <b>materials,</b> often containing aluminate minerals. Due to the relatively high cost of such <b>bed</b> <b>materials</b> the most dominant practice is still the use of silica sand even with high alkali fuels and the bed sintering is controlled by continuous replacement of the <b>bed</b> <b>material.</b> The present study investigates the possibility of mixing <b>bed</b> <b>materials</b> and thereby optimizing the existing process by combining the low cost of silica sand with the sintering inhibiting properties of bauxite. Silica sand and bauxite were mixed in different ratios {{in a series of}} tests and were exposed to alkali compounds in a 12 MW boiler as well as in simplified experiments in a lab-scale furnace. The performance of the mixture of <b>bed</b> <b>materials</b> was then evaluated based on the tendency to chemically interact with the alkali compounds, the formation of agglomerates and the effect on the overall performance of the reactor. Thermodynamic predictions of the expected compounds at the given conditions were also used to compare with the experimentally obtained results. It was observed that mixing <b>bed</b> <b>materials</b> led to change in the observed mechanism of agglomeration and is beneficial for the fluidization. Furthermore, when calcium was present the amount of the formed alkali silicates and thereby the amount of agglomerates was decreased. It could be therewith shown that a significant improvement can be reached with existing <b>bed</b> <b>materials...</b>|$|R

The <b>bedding</b> <b>materials</b> used were sphagnum peat and wood shavings. Six horses had each <b>material</b> as <b>bedding</b> for a three week period in a change–over experiment. The horses’ ration of roughage was distributed directly on top of the bedding.

T-RFLP analysis is a PCR based method were the size of 16 S rRNA fragments are determined in order to study microbial communities. <b>Samples</b> of <b>bedding</b> <b>material</b> were collected at the start up an end of each period and sent for hygienic analysing. Samples of the haylage fed to the horses were collected weekly and sent for analysis as one sample per period. Samples were also taken from both materials in the beginning and end of each period for determination of pH, dry matter and water holding capacity. Registrations of indoor and outdoor temperature and humidity were done on a daily basis. <b>Bedding</b> <b>material</b> did not influence the faecal pH. The T-FRLP analysis did not show any impact from <b>bedding</b> <b>material</b> on the microflora. Peat had significantly higher water holding capacity compared to wood shavings.

The aim of this work was to compare time budgets, growth and food intake of growing, finishing lambs housed on either woodchip or straw <b>bedding</b> <b>materials</b> and also to evaluate the preferences shown by lambs when given a choice of <b>bedding</b> <b>materials.</b> One hundred and twenty-eight spring-born (approximately nine-month-old) Suffolk x Mule (Bluefaced Leicester x Welsh Speckled Face) and Charollais x Mule lambs (mean weight 35. 3 +/- 0. 28 kg) were randomly allocated within breed, sex and weight range to pens of four lambs and housed on either woodchip or straw. They were fed hay and concentrates ad libitum over an eighteen-day period. Lying, standing and eating behaviours were observed at 15 min intervals over 24 h on days 7 and 14 after housing. On day 17 the lambs were moved to the alternative <b>bedding</b> <b>material</b> and were observed for a further 48 h to assess the effects on time budgets of a novel <b>bedding</b> <b>material</b> in a familiar housed environment. Over all days, the proportions of observations when lambs were either lying, standing, eating hay or eating concentrates were 0. 69, 0. 15, 0. 07 and 0. 06 respectively {{and there were no}} significant effects of <b>bedding</b> <b>material</b> (P > 0. 05). On the first day after a change to the novel <b>bedding</b> <b>material,</b> the proportion of observations when lambs were lying fell by 6 % (P 0. 05). The 64 Suffolk x Mule lambs were then used in a preference test in which their use of <b>bedding</b> <b>materials</b> for various activities was observed every 15 min over four consecutive 12 hour days. Lambs used woodchip as a <b>bedding</b> <b>material</b> when lying or standing almost twice as often as straw (P 0. 05). There were no significant effects of either sex of lamb, day of observation or prior experience of the <b>bedding</b> <b>materials</b> on the preference for woodchip (all P > 0. 05). It is concluded that woodchip is a suitable alternative <b>bedding</b> <b>material</b> to straw, that is preferred by lambs over straw and is unlikely to affect lamb performance through changes in the proportion of time spent lying, standing or eating.
