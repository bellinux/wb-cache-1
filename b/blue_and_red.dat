5|$|Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime, {{the leader}} of the Autobots who {{transforms}} into a <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> 1994 Peterbilt 379 semi-trailer truck. Peter Cullen had previously voiced Optimus Prime in the original 1980s cartoon and was chosen to reprise his role, which was warmly welcomed by audiences and considered one of the film's best aspects.|$|E
5|$|The <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> colours of {{the shirt}} were first worn in a match against Hispania in 1900. Several {{competing}} theories {{have been put}} forth for the <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> design of the Barcelona shirt. The son of the first president, Arthur Witty, claimed it {{was the idea of}} his father as the colours were the same as the Merchant Taylor's School team. Another explanation, according to author Toni Strubell, is that the colours are from Robespierre's First Republic. In Catalonia the common perception is that the colours were chosen by Joan Gamper and are those of his home team, FC Basel. The club's most frequently used change colours have been yellow and orange. An away kit featuring the red and yellow stripes of the flag of Catalonia has also been used many times.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the flag of Artsakh, the Armenian flag colors influenced {{the design of the}} Pan-Armenian Games flag. In the center of the light blue flag are six interlocking rings, derived from the Olympic rings. The sixth, orange-colored ring, interlocks with the <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> rings, which symbolize Armenia. Above the rings is a flame in the colors of the Armenian flag.|$|E

However, {{the combination of}} dispersion with extreme hardness, wear and chemical resistivity, as well as clever marketing, determines the exceptional value of diamond as a gemstone.|$|E

In the upper left corner on the blue stripe is a crown in yellow symbolizing the royal charter. The university also has a ceremonial flag, which is reserved for official university uses. The ceremonial flag is a square design of the Queen's coat of arms.|$|E

5|$|The {{national}} flag of Ecuador, {{which consists of}} horizontal bands of yellow (double width), <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>red,</b> was first adopted by law in 1835 and later on 26 September 1860. The design of the current flag was finalized in 1900 {{with the addition of}} the coat of arms {{in the center of the}} flag. Before using the yellow, <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> tricolor, Ecuador used white and blue flags that contained stars for each province of the country. The design of the flag is very similar to those of Colombia and Venezuela, which are also former constituent territories of Gran Colombia. All three are based on a proposal by Venezuelan General Francisco de Miranda, which was adopted by Venezuela in 1811 and later Gran Colombia with some modifications. There is a variant of the flag that does not contain the coat of arms that is used by the merchant marine. This flag matches Colombia's in every aspect, but Colombia uses a different design when her merchant marine ships are at sail.|$|E
5|$|<b>Blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>Red</b> Landers, {{recurring}} {{characters in}} many Compile games, increase the player's maximum life and power chip capacities, respectively. Blue Landers play multiple roles in The Guardian Legend. Some {{of them are}} not items but non-player characters that dispense advice to the player or exchange upgrades for power chips; others provide a password that allows the player to resume the game at a later time with their progress retained. These Blue Landers also serve as checkpoints; players can restart their game in these designated rooms after being defeated provided the system has not been turned off.|$|E

All were initially allocated to Wimbledon depot working services on the Central and South Western divisions. The Central Division 455/8s were transferred to Selhurst in 1986 after modifications to the depot were completed. All were delivered in British Rail blue and white livery, before being repainted in Network SouthEast white, <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> livery from 1986. In May 1991, 455743 was renumbered 455750 and renamed Wimbledon Traincare depot {{in recognition of the}} depot obtaining BS5750 quality services accreditation.|$|E

5|$|Gabriel García Moreno, upon {{assuming}} power {{two days}} after the Battle of Guayaquil in September 1860, the yellow, <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> triband was returned to use; its reinstatement on September 26 is commemorated during Ecuador's national flag day. Previously, a vertical white, blue and white flag was used. In the middle of the blue stripe, there were white stars placed to signify the number of provinces in Ecuador. The highest star total was seven before this flag was abandoned. In 1900, the flag was made the definitive national standard, and was charged with the coat of arms for official national government use while the plain flag was reserved for the merchant marine.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, the {{inhabitants}} of the French-administered Saar Protectorate voted to join West Germany. Since its establishment as a separate French protectorate in 1947, the Saar had a white Nordic cross on a <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> background as its flag. To demonstrate the commitment of the Saar {{to be a part of}} West Germany, a new flag was selected on 9 July 1956: the black-red-gold tricolour defaced with the new coat of arms, also proposed on this day. This flag came into force on 1 January 1957, upon the establishment of the Saarland as a state of West Germany.|$|E
5|$|On 22 October 1899, Joan Gamper {{placed an}} {{advertisement}} in Los Deportes declaring his wish {{to form a}} football club; a positive response resulted in {{a meeting at the}} Gimnasio Solé on 29 November. Eleven players attended: Walter Wild (the first director of the club), Lluís d'Ossó, Bartomeu Terradas, Otto Kunzle, Otto Maier, Enric Ducal, Pere Cabot, Josep Llobet, John Parsons and William Parsons. As a result, Football Club Barcelona was born. The <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> colours of the shirt were first worn in a match against Hispania in 1900; the prevailing Catalonia conception is that the colours were chosen by Joan Gamper and are those of his home team, Crystal Palace.|$|E

5|$|The Bolton Wanderers club badge {{consists}} of the initials of the club {{in the shape of}} a ball, with a red scroll and Lancashire rose underneath. The current badge is a reimagining of one designed in 1975; this was replaced in 2001 by a badge which retained the recognisable initials but controversially exchanged the scroll and rose for <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> ribbons. The re-design has been welcomed by fans who saw the ribbons as a poor choice. The original club badge was the town crest of Bolton, a key feature of which was the Elephant and Castle motif with the town motto – Supera Moras. This feature has been reincorporated into more recent club shirts.|$|E
5|$|Tow Law Town's home colours have {{traditionally}} been vertical black and white stripes with black shorts and socks. This is common amongst clubs in the North East of England; Football League Championship club Newcastle United play in black and white, but locally Spennymoor Town, Darlington, Ponteland United and Ashington also wear black and white kits. Tow Law Town's away strips consist of <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> halves with blue shorts and socks. Between 2006 and 2009, the club were sponsored by McInerney Homes, in a £5,000 a year deal. In August 2010, local company Bodywork Direct took over the club shirt sponsorship deal.|$|E
5|$|Earlier, at the Sibiu Conference of 26 April/8 May 1848, Transylvanian revolutionaries {{had also}} adopted a blue-white-red {{national}} flag (vertical, {{according to the}} memoirs of George Bariţ). It was emblazoned with the words “VIRTUTEA ROMANĂ REÎNVIATĂ” (“ROMAN VIRTUE RESURRECTED”). A number of contemporary sources attests these colors (including the Blaj newspaper Organul naţionale and Alexandru Papiu Ilarian’s Istorie a românilor din Dacia superioară). They had a twofold significance: their importance in Romanian costume and their union of the Transylvanian principality’s old colors (<b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>red)</b> with the white symbolizing peace. It appears that the two specimens with blue-yellow-red stripes preserved today at the National Museum of Romanian History were made later to commemorate the events at Blaj; yellow replaced white {{as a symbol of}} Romanian Transylvanians’ desire to join Romania.|$|E
