25|$|Lisa Rosenberger's 2001 phylogenetic analysis, {{based on}} {{morphological}} characters, {{found that the}} pale-edged stingray is sister to a clade containing the whitespotted whipray (Himantura gerrardi), the pearl stingray (D. margaritella), and the smooth <b>butterfly</b> <b>ray</b> (Gymnura micrura). These results support the growing consensus that neither Dasyatis nor Himantura are monophyletic.|$|E
25|$|Potential predators of spiny {{butterfly}} rays include larger fish {{such as the}} great hammerhead (Sphyrna mokarran), and marine mammals. In the northwest Atlantic, the depletion of seven large shark species by commercial fisheries {{has led to an}} increase in the population of the spiny <b>butterfly</b> <b>ray</b> and other mid-level predators. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Anthobothrium altavelae and Pterobothrioides petterae, and the gill parasite Heteronchocotyle gymnurae.|$|E

25|$|In {{the western}} Atlantic, the spiny <b>butterfly</b> <b>ray</b> feeds on fishes, {{including}} Leiognathus and small sharks, and squids. Off Tunisia, they feed on crustaceans, teleosts, cephalopods, lamellibranchs, and gastropods, {{in descending order}} of importance. Teleost fishes apparently become {{more important in the}} ray's diet with increasing size. An active predator, the ray typically approaches a prey item slowly before rapidly spinning around over it and striking the food with the leading edge of one of their pectoral fins. This behavior likely serves to stun the prey before capture, as the pectoral fins of butterfly rays contain a high proportion of red muscle and can deliver blows of substantial force.|$|E
25|$|The spiny <b>butterfly</b> <b>ray</b> {{has a very}} broad, lozenge-shaped {{pectoral}} fin disk much wider than it is long, with concave front margins and abruptly rounded corners. The snout is short and blunt. The teeth have high, conical cusps, numbering 98–138 rows in the upper jaw and 78–110 rows in the lower jaw. In both jaws there are 10–12 functional tooth rows with each dental band occupying 70% {{the width of the}} jaw. There is a tentacle-like structure on the inner posterior margin of each spiracle. The tail is short and slender, measuring a quarter the disk width, with upper and lower fin folds. There are one or more serrated spines {{at the base of the}} tail.|$|E

25|$|Spiny <b>butterfly</b> <b>rays</b> are {{harmless}} to humans, {{though if}} stepped on its tail spine {{can cause a}} painful wound. It is listed as a game fish in some regions. The meat of this species is highly regarded and it is caught for human consumption, except for in the waters off the United States where it is not targeted by commercial fisheries and is rarely taken as bycatch. It is assessed as a vulnerable species by the World Conservation Union.|$|R
500|$|In 1837, Johannes Peter Müller and Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle {{placed the}} {{porcupine}} ray {{in a new}} genus, Gymnura. As the name Gymnura was already in use, referring to the <b>butterfly</b> <b>rays,</b> later that year Müller and Henle replaced it with Urogymnus. Both names are derived from the Ancient Greek oura ("tail") and gymnos ("naked" [...] or [...] "unarmed"), referring {{to the lack of}} a tail sting. Urogymnus has traditionally been considered monotypic (only containing U. asperrimus), but several other species were moved to this genus from Himantura in 2016 based on morphology and molecular evidence.|$|R

50|$|These are broad {{diamond-shaped}} rays {{with a short}} tail {{that has}} low dorsal and ventral fin folds. The tail has 3 to 4 dark lines that {{are referred to as}} crossbars. The edges of the disc are concave. The caudal fin is never present and a variable number of tubercles can be found on larger specimens. The smooth <b>butterfly</b> <b>rays</b> have disc widths nearly twice the size of their body lengths and are very flat-bodied (compressed). The width of the rays are between 16 and 22 centimeters when they are born and are about 50 cm when mature for a female and about 42 cm for a male. Females are bigger than their male counterparts; this allows them to carry larger embryos and a greater abundance of embryos. They have a maximum size of 120 cm.|$|R
25|$|Elsewhere in the spiny <b>butterfly</b> <b>ray's</b> range, {{it faces}} heavy fishing pressure, {{including}} in its coastal nursery areas, and has experienced marked declines.

50|$|The {{backwater}} <b>butterfly</b> <b>ray,</b> <b>butterfly</b> <b>ray,</b> diamond ray, or short-tailed ray (Gymnura natalensis) is {{a species}} of fish in the Gymnuridae family. It is found in Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, possibly Kenya, and possibly Tanzania. Its natural habitats are open seas, shallow seas, estuarine waters, and coastal saline lagoons. It is threatened by habitat loss. The population is unknown but was considered common from 1940s-1960s but further studies are needed.|$|E
40|$|Standardised {{diets and}} trophic level (T L) {{estimates}} {{were calculated for}} 75 ray species from the suborders Myliobatoidei (67 spp.) and Torpedinoidei (8 spp.). Decapod crustaceans (31. 71 ± 3. 92 %) and teleost fishes (16. 45 ± 3. 43 %) made the largest contribution to the standardised diet of the Myliobatoidei. Teleost fishes (37. 40 ± 16. 09 %) and polychaete worms (31. 96 ± 14. 22 %) were the most prominent prey categories in the standardised diet of the suborder Torpedinoidei. Cluster analysis identified nine major trophic guilds the largest of which were decapod crustaceans (24 species), teleost fishes (11 species) and molluscs (11 species). Trophic level estimates for rays ranged from 3. 10 for Potamotrygon falkneri to 4. 24 for Gymnura australis, Torpedo marmorata and T. nobiliana. Secondary consumers with a T L < 4. 00 represented 84 % of the species examined, with the remaining 12 species (16 %) classified as tertiary consumers (T L ≥ 4. 00). Tertiary consumers included electric rays (Torpedo, 3 spp. and Hypnos, 1 sp.), <b>butterfly</b> <b>rays</b> (Gymnura, 4 spp.), stingrays (2 spp.) and Potamotrygonid stingrays (2 spp.). Feeding strategies were identified as the primary factor of influence with respect to Myliobatoidei and Torpedinoidei T L estimates with inter-family comparisons providing the greatest insight into Myliobatoidei and Torpedinoidei relationships...|$|R

50|$|The disc {{shape of}} the smalleye {{stingray}} suggests that it may swim in a fashion unlike other stingrays and more akin to other rays with very broad pectoral fin discs (such as <b>butterfly</b> or manta <b>rays),</b> i.e., flapping its pectoral fins up and down rather than undulating the pectoral fin margins; this species would thus represent a case of convergent evolution with those ray families. Off Tofo, most individuals are accompanied by multiple cobia (Rachycentron canadum). A known parasite of this species is the tapeworm Oncomegoides celatus, which infests the spiral valve intestine. As with other stingrays, the smalleye stingray is aplacental viviparous with the developing embryos being sustained by yolk and later histotroph ("uterine milk") secreted by the mother. There is a record of a female gestating a single late-term fetus, which exhibited the same spotted color pattern as the adult. Newborn rays likely measure 31 - 33 cm across.|$|R
