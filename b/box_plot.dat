40|$|In this chapter, {{we explore}} the {{challenges}} of learning about <b>box</b> <b>plots</b> and question the rationale for introducing <b>box</b> <b>plots</b> to middle school students (up to 14 years old). <b>Box</b> <b>plots</b> are very valuable tools for data analysis {{and for those who}} know how to interpret them. Research has shown, however, that some of their features make them particularly difficult for young students to use in authentic contexts. These difficulties include: a) <b>box</b> <b>plots</b> generally do not allow perceiving individual cases; b) <b>box</b> <b>plots</b> operate differently than other displays students encounter; c) the median is not as intuitive to students as we once suspected; d) quartiles divide the data into groups in ways that few students (or even teachers) really understand. We recommend that educators consider these features as they determine whether, how, and when to introduce <b>box</b> <b>plots</b> to students...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we studied an {{intervention}} aimed at remediating students’ tendency {{to interpret the}} area of the <b>box</b> in <b>box</b> <b>plots</b> as representing the proportion or number of observations.

A study with expert users of <b>box</b> <b>plots</b> has shown that even people who frequently use <b>box</b> <b>plots</b> are prone to this incorrect interpretation of <b>box</b> <b>plots.</b> Using a bottom-up approach of teaching, we tried to improve students’ interpretation of <b>box</b> <b>plots.</b> We found that most students showed improvement after the intervention, although signs of heuristic reasoning were still found, both in the accuracy rates and reaction times. The intervention was hence not able to alter these participants’ heuristic reasoning concerning <b>box</b> <b>plots,</b> although it did help these participants to give correct answers.

40|$|<b>Box</b> <b>plots</b> and histograms {{are often}} {{thought to be}} easy to {{interpret}} representations of data distributions. In our research, however, we have shown {{that this is not the}} case. First, we studied one common misinterpretation of <b>box</b> <b>plots</b> and one common misinterpretation of histograms in depth using the dual process theory of reasoning. This theory provided us with a theoretical and methodological framework that allowed us to set up a series of studies in which we studied the source of these misinterpretations. We found, for both misinterpretations, that people are inclined to interpret <b>box</b> <b>plots</b> and histograms in an intuitive way, by basing their interpretation of a salient but irrelevant element in the representation. For <b>box</b> <b>plots,</b> people focus on the large area of the box and interpret that a larger part of this box represents more data points than a smaller part of this box, while in fact each part of the box represents the same number of data points. For histograms, people are inclined to take the height of the middle bar into account when comparing the average of two symmetrical histograms, while this is not relevant for this comparison. These results were found with both students and expert users of <b>box</b> <b>plots</b> and histograms. In follow-up studies we tried to improve people’s interpretation of <b>box</b> <b>plots,</b> by using two methods: multiple external representations and refutational text, both separately and in combination. A first study was done in an ecologically valid setting. We found that multiple external representations did not improve students’ interpretation, while refutational text did. In a follow-up experiment, we tested whether refutational text indeed replaced the incorrect intuition by a correct one. Although this was not the case, participants in the refutational text condition interpreted <b>box</b> <b>plots</b> correctly more often and also faster, than participants in the control condition. We conclude that it is very difficult to completely eradicate the misinterpretation of <b>box</b> <b>plots,</b> although refutational text can help students to overcome their incorrect intuitions. status: publishe...|$|R
