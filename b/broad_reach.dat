25|$|A clew-first waterstart is a {{variation}} used {{to start in}} the opposite direction from the one the board is initially pointing. It is very similar to a standard waterstart. The main difference is that once the sail is flying, the board is on the mast side of the sailor and points a bit further downwind, on a <b>broad</b> <b>reach.</b> The sail is flipped once the sailor is up and on the board.|$|E
25|$|Trapeze wires, {{which are}} narrow gauge {{flexible}} stainless steel wire, running from about the cross {{trees on the}} mast to the harness worn by a crew member and sometimes skipper on a high speed racing skiff. The lower section often has a system of small blocks which are used by the crew to alter {{the length of the}} trapeze wire as the crew moves aft on a <b>broad</b> <b>reach.</b> When the boat changes tack the crew unclips the hook, the wire is automatically sprung into the gunwale by an elastic tail.|$|E
500|$|The bill's {{legislative}} history showed that Congress had intended that <b>broad</b> <b>reach.</b> Senator Ernest Hollings had, in opposing the bill, {{worried that it}} might bar American ships from the shark fin trade entirely. The Congressional Budget Office had found that the bill enacted a mandate to that effect in its report to the House of Representatives.

2500|$|Local governments {{may choose}} to provide {{services}} by using their own staff and resources for collection, transportation and treatment services. [...] This {{is often the case}} in smaller cities or municipalities where the water utility may not have a <b>broad</b> <b>reach.</b> In many cases, cooperation between the city government and the water district may be strategically advantageous. Dumaguete City, Philippines is one example where the Water District and Local Government have joint ownership and responsibilities for the FSM program. Organized FSM programs may be able to provide the service cheaper and more hygienically than the private operators working independently. Less expensive services is an important selling point when promoting the program to citizens and encouraging them to participate.|$|E

60|$|The Molly Swash kept {{close on}} a wind, luffing athwar the <b>broad</b> <b>reach</b> she was in, until far enough to weather Blackwell's, when she edged off to her course, {{and went through the}} {{southern}} passage. Although the wind remained light, and a little baffling, the brig was so easily impelled, and was so very handy, that there was no difficulty in keeping her perfectly in command. The tide, too, was fast increasing in strength and volocity, and the movement from this cause alone was getting to be sufficiently rapid.|$|E
6000|$|We {{drove through}} this country some {{three or four}} leagues, until we at length came to an estate of better {{arrangements}} than common. On our left was a wood, and on our right a <b>broad</b> <b>reach</b> of meadow. Passing the wood, we saw a wide, park-like lawn, that was beautifully shaded by copses, and in which there were touches of landscape-gardening, in a taste altogether better than was usual in France. Passing this, another wood met us, and turning it, we entered a private road--you will remember the country has neither fence nor hedge, nor yet scarcely a wall--which wound round its margin, describing an irregular semicircle. Then it ran {{in a straight line}} for a short distance, among a grove of young evergreens, towards two dark picturesque towers covered with ivy, crossed a permanent bridge that spanned a ditch, and dashing through a gateway, in which the grooves of the portcullis are yet visible, we alighted in the court of La Grange! ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was always}} {{mountain}}, but a mountain so gradual of ascent, so vast, {{and yet so}} much like a <b>broad</b> <b>reach</b> of variegated low land, in its ornaments, cultivation, houses, villages, copses, meadows, and vines, {{that it seemed to}} be a huge plain canted into a particular inclination, in order to give the spectator a better opportunity to examine it in detail, and at his leisure, as one would hold a picture to the proper light. Some of the ascents, nevertheless, were sufficiently sharp, and more than once we were glad enough to stop to cool ourselves, and to take breath. At length, after crossing some lovely meadows, by the margin of beautiful woods, we came out at the spot which was the goal we had aimed at from the commencement of the excursion. This was the castle of Blonay, of whose picturesque site and pleasant appearance I have already spoken in my letters, as a venerable hold that stands about a league from the town, on one of the most striking positions of the mountain.|$|E
50|$|If {{the desired}} course {{is within the}} no-go zone, then the sailing craft must follow a zig-zag route into the wind to reach its {{waypoint}} or destination.

60|$|The {{governor}} behaved admirably on this trying occasion. He issued {{his orders}} clearly, calmly, and promptly. Calling on Bigelow and Jones by name, he {{ordered them to}} withdraw the bridge, which could easily be done by hauling over the planks by means of wheels that had long been fitted for that purpose. The bridge withdrawn, the channel, or harbour, answered all the purposes of a ditch; though the South Sea islanders would think but little of swimming across it. Of course, Waally's men knew nothing of this bridge, nor did they know {{of the existence of}} the basin between them and their prey. They rushed directly towards the ship-yard, and loud were their yells of disappointment when they found a <b>broad</b> <b>reach</b> of water still separating them from the whites. Naturally they looked for the point of connection; but, by this time, the planks were wheeled in, and the communication was severed. At this instant, Waally had all his muskets discharged, and the gun fired from the catamaran, on which it was mounted. No one was injured by this volley, but a famous noise was made; and noise passed for a good deal in the warfare of that day and region.|$|E
60|$|At first sight, Mark had a {{good deal}} of {{difficulty}} in understanding the predominant nature of the very many bodies of water that were to be seen on every side of him. On the whole, there still remained almost as much of one element as of the other, in the view; which of itself, however, was a vast change from what had previously been the condition of the shoals. There were large bodies of water, little lakes in extent, which it was obvious enough must disappear under the process of evaporation, no communication existing between them and the open ocean. But, on the other hand, many of these sheets were sounds, or arms of the sea, that must always continue, since they might be traced, far as eye could reach, towards the mighty Pacific. Such, Mark was induced to believe, was the fact with the belt of water that still surrounded, or nearly surrounded the Reef; for, placed where he was, the young man was unable to ascertain whether the latter had, or had not, at a particular point, any land communication with an extensive range of naked rock, sand, mud, and deposit, that stretched away to the westward, for leagues. In obvious connection with this <b>broad</b> <b>reach</b> of what might be termed bare ground, were Guano and Loam Islands; neither of which was an island any longer, except as it {{was a part of the}} whole formation around it. Nevertheless, our young man was not sorry to see that the channel around the Reef still washed the bases of both those important places of deposit, leaving it in his power to transport their valuable manures by means of the raft, or boat.|$|E
6000|$|Forthwith {{a change}} {{came over the}} waters, and the {{serenity}} became less brilliant but more profound. The old river in its <b>broad</b> <b>reach</b> rested unruffled at the decline of day, after ages of good service done to the race that peopled its banks, spread out in the tranquil dignity of a waterway leading to the uttermost ends of the earth. We looked at the venerable stream not in the vivid flush of a short day that comes and departs for ever, but in the august light of abiding memories. And indeed nothing is easier {{for a man who}} has, as the phrase goes, [...] "followed the sea" [...] with reverence and affection, than to evoke the great spirit of the past upon the lower reaches of the Thames. The tidal current runs to and fro in its unceasing service, crowded with memories of men and ships it had borne to the rest of home or to the battles of the sea. It had known and served all the men of whom the nation is proud, from Sir Francis Drake to Sir John Franklin, knights all, titled and untitled--the great knights-errant of the sea. It had borne all the ships whose names are like jewels flashing in the night of time, from the Golden Hind returning with her round flanks full of treasure, to be visited by the Queen's Highness and thus pass out of the gigantic tale, to the Erebus and Terror, bound on other conquests--and that never returned. It had known the ships and the men. They had sailed from Deptford, from Greenwich, from Erith--the adventurers and the settlers; kings' ships and the ships of men on 'Change; captains, admirals, the dark [...] "interlopers" [...] of the Eastern trade, and the commissioned [...] "generals" [...] of East India fleets. Hunters for gold or pursuers of fame, they all had gone out on that stream, bearing the sword, and often the torch, messengers of the might within the land, bearers of a spark from the sacred fire. What greatness had not floated on the ebb of that river into the mystery of an unknown earth! [...] . The dreams of men, the seed of commonwealths, the germs of empires.|$|E
