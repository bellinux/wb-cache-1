5|$|By the {{spectral}} theorem, real symmetric matrices and complex Hermitian matrices have an eigenbasis; that is, every vector is expressible as a linear combination of eigenvectors.

This theorem can <b>be</b> <b>generalized</b> <b>to</b> infinite-dimensional situations related to matrices with infinitely many rows and columns, see below.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{incorporate}} spinning point particles into general relativity, the affine connection needed to <b>be</b> <b>generalized</b> <b>to</b> include an antisymmetric part, called the torsion. This modification {{was made by}} Einstein and Cartan in the 1920s.|$|E

5|$|Although the Euclidean {{algorithm}} {{is used to}} find the greatest common divisor of two natural numbers (positive integers), it may <b>be</b> <b>generalized</b> <b>to</b> the real numbers, and to other mathematical objects, such as polynomials, quadratic integers and Hurwitz quaternions. In the latter cases, the Euclidean {{algorithm is}} used to demonstrate the crucial property of unique factorization, i.e., that such numbers can be factored uniquely into irreducible elements, the counterparts of prime numbers. Unique factorization is essential to many proofs of number theory.|$|E
5|$|If a continuous-time real-valued {{stochastic}} process meets certain moment conditions on its increments, then the Kolmogorov continuity theorem {{says that there}} exists a modification of this process that has continuous sample paths with probability one, so the {{stochastic process}} has a continuous modification or version. The theorem can also <b>be</b> <b>generalized</b> <b>to</b> random fields so the index set is -dimensional Euclidean space {{as well as to}} stochastic processes with metric spaces as their state spaces.|$|E
5|$|The Pythagorean tiling may <b>be</b> <b>generalized</b> <b>to</b> a {{three-dimensional}} tiling of Euclidean space by cubes {{of two different}} sizes, which also is unilateral and equitransitive.
