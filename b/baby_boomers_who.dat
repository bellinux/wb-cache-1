2500|$|Cruisers' comfort, style, and {{affordability}} (compared to {{mountain and}} racing bikes) {{have led to}} renewed popularity in recent years In late 1979, Schwinn produced the [...] "Schwinn Cruiser" [...] model. [...] In the 1980s Huffy built the [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] beach cruiser, and Murray built the [...] "Monterey" [...] beach cruiser, both using product names, like beaches, with an association {{to the west coast}} of California. [...] Then in the early to mid-1990s, Schwinn produced a series of cruiser models, including the [...] "Cruiser Deluxe" [...] (which featured a Phantom-style tank with horn, chrome fenders, white-wall balloon tires, rear rack, a springer fork, and two-tone blue or green frames). [...] The cruiser resurgence continued in 1995, when Schwinn reissued the Black Phantom to celebrate the company's 100th birthday. During that same time frame, similar offerings appeared from Columbia (a limited reissue of the classic 1950's 5-Star was produced in the early 1990s), and Roadmaster. Harley-Davidson even licensed a cruiser bike with their logo and trademark styling. These helped stir up interest in cruisers, which brought them to the attention of aging <b>Baby</b> <b>Boomers,</b> <b>who</b> remembered the originals from their youth and now were reaching an age where a comfortable bike was more exciting than a fast bike, and who also had the money to buy whatever they wanted. The classic [...] "retro" [...] looks, reliable mechanical performance, comfortable ride, and relatively low price of cruisers (compared to mountain bikes or road racers) also appealed to young Gen Xers. Nearly every major bike manufacturer now offers at least one cruiser model, if not an entire line. Some notable contemporary manufactures include Electra Bicycle Company and Felt Bicycles. [...] Cruiser sales have continued to rise over the past decade and today many towns have clubs sponsoring regular cruiser rides as a way to promote the low-tech, high fun aspect of cycling.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} one neglected area of workers' compensation research, the effect of injury and illness on net worth. We track participants in the NLSY 79 : one-third of these <b>baby</b> <b>boomers</b> were hurt at work, but 38 % of them did not file for workers' compensation. We find that the typical young <b>baby</b> <b>boomer</b> <b>who</b> is never injured has both much higher absolute wealth and wealth growth rates than <b>boomers</b> <b>who</b> are ever injured. Regression results that control for unobserved heterogeneity suggest, however, that the injury does not predict lower wealth unless workers have reported wage losses or spells off work because of their accidents. For these employees wealth is dramatically reduced, regardless of {{their participation in the}} workers' compensation system. We also find that injured workers significantly reduce their consumption over time. These results raise new questions about the adequacy of workers' compensation benefits and the quality of jobs injured workers are able to return to. They suggest that sudden health problems caused by occupational injuries may affect more than employers' costs and individuals' incomes; they may have also wider and longer lasting consequences in term of families' wealth and well-being.

The {{purpose of this}} qualitative case {{study was to explore}} strategies local government leaders use to retain tacit knowledge of <b>baby</b> <b>boomer</b> employees. Six government leaders who worked in the Midwest United States participated in the study and shared their experiences and perceptions. Building upon systems theory, transformational leadership theory, and knowledge management theory, research was conducted to identify strategies to retain tacit knowledge from retiring <b>baby</b> <b>boomers.</b> Physical artifacts and participant interview data were collected and analyzed using traditional text analysis. Adjoining terms were highlighted and clusters of repeated and related words were coded into themes. Three themes emerged: (a) mentoring, (b) generational differences, and (c) lack of structured systems. Mentoring was the most critical strategy leaders used to retain tacit knowledge from <b>baby</b> <b>boomer</b> employees. Acquiring collaborative leaders who foster a knowledge-sharing environment, create a structured system for retaining knowledge, and encourage communication between multigenerational teams remained imperative to retain tacit knowledge. Implications for positive social change include taking advantage of the human capital and resources the <b>baby</b> <b>boomer</b> population characterized, and educating other government leaders to improve performance within government agencies. Other social change implications include the potential of leaders to train older workers to share tacit knowledge with new workers, and of managers to incorporate strategies to mentor new workers replacing the older workforce...|$|R

The contrast between parental and youth culture exemplified by rock and roll was a recurring source of concern for older generations, who worried about juvenile delinquency and social rebellion, particularly as to a large extent rock and roll culture was shared by different racial and social groups.|$|R
