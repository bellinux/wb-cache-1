50|$|The {{increased}} mass of {{the added}} armor and protective modifications is offset by a more powerful engine and <b>brakes</b> and stronger <b>shock</b> absorbers.

40|$|Magnetorheological fluids {{have great}} {{potential}} for engineering applications due to their variable rheological behavior. These fluids find applications in dampers, <b>brakes,</b> <b>shock</b> absorbers, and engine mounts [1]. However their relatively high cost (approximately US$ 600 per liter) limits their wide usage. Most commonly used magnetic material "Carbonyl iron" cost more than 90 % of the MR fluid cost [2]. Therefore for commercial viability of these fluids there is need of alternative economical magnetic material. In the present work synthesis of MR fluid has been attempted with objective to produce low cost MR fluid with high sedimentation stability and greater yield stress. In {{order to reduce the}} cost, economical electrolytic Iron powder (US$ 10 per Kg) has been used. Iron powder of relatively larger size (300 Mesh) has been ball milled to reduce their size to few microns (I to 10 microns). Three different compositions have been prepared and compared for MR effect produced and stability. All have same base fluid (Synthetic oil) and same magnetic phase i. e. Iron particles but they have different additives. First preparation involves organic additives Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and Stearic acid. Other two preparations involve use of two environmental friendly low-priced green additives guar gum (US$ 2 per Kg) and xanthan gum (US$ 12 per Kg) respectively. Magnetic properties of Iron particles have been measured by Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM). Morphology of Iron particles and additives guar gum and xanthan gum has been examined by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Particles Size Distribution (PSD) has been determined using Particle size analyzer. Microscopic images of particles, M-H plots and stability of synthesized MR fluids have been reported. The prepared low cost MR fluids showed promising performance and can be effectively used for engineering applications demanding controllability in operations...|$|R

40|$|Chassis is the French {{word was}} used to denote the frame parts or main {{structure}} of vehicle, which is now, denotes the whole vehicle except body in case of heavy vehicles (that is vehicle without body is called chassis). In case of light vehicles of mono construction, it denotes the whole vehicle except additional fittings in the body. Automobile chassis usually refers to the lower body of the vehicle including the tires, engine, frame, driveline and suspension. Out of these, the frame provides necessary support to the vehicle components placed on it. Role of the chassis frame {{is to provide a}} structural platform that can connect the front and rear suspension without excessive deflection. Also, it should be rigid enough to withstand the shock, twist, vibration and other stresses caused due to sudden <b>braking,</b> acceleration, <b>shocking</b> road condition, centrifugal force while cornering and forces induced by its components. So, strength and stiffness are two main criteria for the design of the chassis. The present study has analyzed the various literatures. After a careful analysis of various research studies conducted so for it has been found that there is the scope of optimizing different factors like weight, stress-strain values and deformation etc. by varying cross sections for modeling and analysis. This paper describes the design and Structural analysis of the heavy vehicle chassis with constraints of maximum stress, strain and deflection of chassis under maximum load. In the present work, the dimension of the TATA 2518 TC chassis is used for the structural analysis of the heavy vehicle chassis by considering three different cross-sections, Namely C, I, and Hollow Rectangular (Box) type cross sections subjected to the same conditions.

40|$|An {{increased}} {{environmental awareness}} and higher climate goals increases {{the demands of}} future developed technology. Focus is thereby directed towards energy efficiency where transport vehicles are affected in great extent. This results in an increment in green vehicles and technical solutions to decrease {{the impact on the}} environment, where the engines energy efficiency is not the only system to be considered. One example of a developed technical solution to decrease the environmental impact is a regenerating system that regenerates the braking energy. Research about energy regenerating technical solutions, is thereby considered to be crucial in respect to a high energy goal with green vehicles. With energy regenerating technical solutions in mind, an increased interest is observed where the potential of the schlock absorber is investigated. Several research projects have been performed with varied result depending on the technical solution to regenerate energy. Unlike regenerating <b>brakes,</b> regenerating <b>shock</b> absorbers has not yet been commercialized. The main reason to this is believed to involve a difference in the shock absorbers behaviour which influence the comfort and handling. Other reasons might involve a reduced life span and a low regenerative efficiency. To calculate the power that originates from the work done by the shock absorber, measurements with moving car in different conditions were performed. The measurements was performed at the front axle on the left side and generated the most mean power of 150 W. This power was generated while moving in the city centre where there were several road bumps which were beneficial to the power generation. The power generation indicates that it would be benefited if the power could be regenerated and used in other electrical systems in the vehicle.

40|$|We {{report on}} the first multi-epoch, phase {{referenced}} VLBI observations of the water maser emission in a high-mass protostar associated with a disk-jet system. The source under study, IRAS 20126 + 4104, has been extensively investigated in a large variety of tracers, including water maser VLBA data acquired by us three years before the present observations. The new findings fully confirm the interpretation proposed in our previous study, namely that the maser spots are expanding from a common origin coincident with the protostar. We also demonstrate that the observed 3 -D velocities of the maser spots can be fitted with a model assuming that the spots are moving along {{the surface of a}} conical jet, with speed increasing for increasing distance from the cone vertex. We also present the results of single-dish monitoring of the water maser spectra in IRAS 20126 + 4104. These reveal that the peak velocity of some maser lines decreases linearly with time. We speculate that such a deceleration could be due to <b>braking</b> of the <b>shocks</b> from which the maser emission originates, due to mass loading at the shock front or dissipation of the shock energy.
