50|$|There are 2 {{ski lifts}} in the hall: a <b>button</b> <b>lift</b> with a {{capacity}} of 1,600 passengers/hour and a chair lift with {{a capacity of}} 3,000 passengers/hour. There is also a Magic carpet (ski lift) for the nursery slope.|$|E
50|$|A {{cable grip}} is a device for {{propelling}} a vehicle by attaching {{to a wire}} cable (also called wire rope) running at a (relatively) constant speed. The vehicle may be suspended from the cable, {{as in the case}} of aerial lifts such as a gondola lift (télécabine), may be guided by rails, as in a cable traction railway, or may be self-guiding, as in a <b>button</b> <b>lift.</b> Typically, multiple vehicles will use the same cable; where just one or two vehicles are in use they will tend to be attached to the cable permanently (e.g. funiculars).|$|E
50|$|Mechanical {{access to}} the {{mountain}} {{is limited to a}} closed, two-stage, pulse gondola system. The first lift starts at 1,450 metres, runs through one intermediate station (known as P1 at 1,800 metres) then terminates at Peyrou d'Amont (2,400 metres). The second stage of the gondola runs directly from Peyrou d'Amont to the Col des Ruillans (3,200 metres). The top of the gondola then allows access to <b>button</b> <b>lift</b> (which is the world's only fully suspended surface lift) to reach the top of the Girose Glacier (3550m). The Girose Glacier can also be reached from the resort of Les Deux Alpes on the other side, although this entails a one to two kilometre walk.|$|E
50|$|Isola 2000 {{currently}} has 2 gondola lifts, 9 chairlifts, 10 <b>button</b> <b>lifts</b> and 1 funicular, {{with a total}} capacity of about 20,000 pph.|$|R
50|$|Auron {{currently}} has 3 gondola lifts, 9 chairlifts, 3 <b>button</b> <b>lifts</b> and one rope lift for beginners. The lift capacity is about 21,000 people per hour.|$|R
50|$|It has skiing for all {{abilities}} from pro to amateur. It has 2 T-bar <b>lifts,</b> 4 <b>button</b> <b>lifts,</b> and one belt lift. They have 2 parks, one halfpipe and tre cornes.|$|R
50|$|The {{resort is}} among the newest within the Massif Central, with skiing {{appearing}} {{in the area around}} the beginning of the 20th century, although the area became forgotten during World War II. Afterwards interest in the sport in the area resurfaced, possibly owing to the influence of the British. The first lift to be constructed at the resort was the Téléski Débrayable de Massebœuf, a single place detachable <b>button</b> <b>lift</b> built by one of the residents in 1947. This lift continued to operate until 1984 when it was replaced by a three place fixed chair lift. The next lift to be built was the Téléski Débrayable de la Gare, built in 1965, to provide a link between the railway station in the valley bottom and Prairie de Sagnes further up the mountain, it is still running today.|$|E
50|$|Children's skiing: Les Gets has {{an area of}} the {{mountain}} for children only, le Grande Cry. This has 2 <b>button</b> <b>lifts</b> and several runs, all themed around trappers and Indians. They hold weekly treasure hunts for children.|$|R
50|$|It has {{two main}} slopes, a 20 m nursery slope and a jump slope; the slope {{on the left}} is 320 metres long and the large slope on the right is 450 metres long. Uplift is {{provided}} by a chairlift and two <b>button</b> <b>lifts.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Snow Factor indoor snow slope {{features}} a 168m main slope {{with an additional}} 2,500m2 dedicated beginners' area for ski and snow board lessons. Ideal for beginners who can practice on a quieter slope with others on the same level, fully supervised. On the main slope, two Poma <b>button</b> <b>lifts</b> give a drag tow {{to the top and}} can be exited either at the half way point on the slope or at the top station of the 200m slope. Rope tows are used on the beginners slope.|$|R
50|$|In all {{gameplay}} modes except Puzzle modes, {{the stack}} of blocks lifts (rises) {{up from the bottom}} of the screen. As the match progresses, the stack rises at an accelerating rate. In these modes, players have the ability to manually lift the stack by using a <b>Lift</b> <b>button.</b> For touch control, the <b>Lift</b> <b>button</b> is a touch-screen area located to the side of the playfield. For button control, a shoulder button is used for the <b>Lift</b> <b>button.</b> If a player's stack is in a state of rising while at or beyond the top edge of their playing field, the player loses the match.|$|R
5000|$|The resort covers 790 {{hectares}} and has 40 km of pisted runs graded as 8 Greens, 13 Blues, 13 Reds and 2 Blacks. There {{are three}} chairlifts, three T-bar lifts, {{and the remaining}} sixteen are <b>button</b> <b>lifts,</b> mostly of the Poma type. [...] Planning permission was granted in June 2010 for a chairlift from the ski centre carpark area to the Cairnwell Cafe, this lift was commissioned in January 2012 and named the Baddoch chair, and the resort also replaced the Cairnwell Chairlift with a modern 3 seat Poma Chair. There are also plans for a modern 4 seater chairlift to replace the Cairnwell T-bar.|$|R

5000|$|MVP 06 {{offers a}} brand new method for {{controlling}} the batter called [...] "load and fire" [...] batting. The player takes control of the batter's body by pressing and holding a <b>button</b> to <b>lift</b> the hitter's leg at the correct time so the hitter can use his hips to rip into the ball.|$|R
5000|$|Jenson Button made {{a better}} start {{off the line}} than Sebastian Vettel, who also had a good start {{compared}} to some cars behind him. Button attempted to overtake down the inside, but Vettel covered aggressively and <b>Button</b> <b>lifted</b> off after being half on the grass which allowed Lewis Hamilton to take him down the outside of Turn 1. [...] Button asked his race engineer soon afterwards [...] "He's {{got to get a}} penalty for that, hasn't he?". Martin Brundle thought the move was [...] "harsh but not worth a penalty", while Vettel said that he had not seen Button because Button was behind him. Meanwhile, home favourite Kamui Kobayashi lost his seventh-place qualifying slot, slipping to twelfth when his anti-stall kicked in at the start. Contrastly, Paul di Resta made a good start to take eighth place.|$|R
50|$|In 1920, {{after the}} First World War, the first skiers came to Obertauern - on foot. Their baggage was transported by horse-drawn sleighs. From 1925 to 1927, the {{so-called}} Tauern races for cars and motorcycles took place, attracting many visitors. The people of Obertauern date {{the foundation of}} their village to 8 December 1929, because it was on that day that regular winter traffic over the Tauern Pass began for the first time. In 1948, the first lift was installed at the Seekarhaus. From 1948 to 1960, the slope was pisted by skiers. For one hour of piste preparation, they got 3 free runs. Roads and avalanche protection were extended in 1950 and the first <b>button</b> <b>lifts</b> were built. The creation of the hotel village of Obertauern began in 1952. Between 1952 and 1961, {{a large number of}} modern cable cars, gondola lifts and drag lifts were installed.|$|R
5000|$|As {{advertised in}} The Times, Friday, 2 October 1959: The {{cylinder}} block and heads are cast in aluminum alloy and hydraulic tappets operate the overhead valves. The engine has a compression ratio of 8 to 1 and is fitted with twin carburetors with automatic choke.Other features available include fully automatic transmission, power-assisted steering, electrically operated ride control, redesigned and more flexible air conditioning, electric rear window demisters and press <b>button</b> window <b>lifts.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{care whether}} it's {{friendly}} or unfriendly. I tell you I don't {{know anything about}} him. And," [...] he added, pressing his thumb upon the <b>button</b> for the <b>lift,</b> [...] "I'll wish you two gentlemen good afternoon. I've business to attend to." ...|$|R
50|$|In each episode, {{the three}} of them would descend in the lift from their flat in the tower block. After their adventures they would return home, Midge would press the <b>button</b> for the <b>lift</b> back to the correct floor, by {{standing}} on Mungo's nose.|$|R
50|$|During {{the height}} of the HIV/AIDS {{hysteria}} the number of gay men living in the Sentinels provoked hysteria in the media with the tabloid Daily Star, interviewing one new resident who said that she wore protective gloves when touching the <b>buttons</b> on the <b>lift</b> in fear of contracting the disease.|$|R
50|$|Les Carrières 1 & 2 are a pair {{of green}} <b>button</b> <b>lifts</b> used {{primarily}} by beginners to access the two green runs, Les Carrières and Les Marmottes, that start from their top stations during the winter season. They were built by Gimar Montaz Mautino with a gap of 16 years between their respective constructions, with Les Carrières 1 being built first in 1969 and Les Carrières 2 being built afterwards in 1985. They both follow the same route with their pylons similarly spaced along the lines, and both have the motor placed at the bottom station, at an elevation of 1406m, and the tension applied at the top station, at an elevation of 1466m, with a vertical gain of 60m and a length of 402m. However their differences are that, due to the terrain, Les Carrières 2 has a slightly steeper maximum slope at 22% rather than the 20% of Les Carrières 1. In addition, with Les Carrières 2 being newer, it is faster. Les Carrières 2 has an operating speed of 3.6 m/s and a throughput of 900 people per hour, compared with the slower 3.5 m/s operating speed and 600 people per hour throughput of Les Carrières 1. Both the motors spin so that the passengers travel {{to the right of}} the pylons on their upwards journey.|$|R
50|$|The {{system has}} two {{stations}} and single car built by Gangloff of Switzerland, the car can accommodate 10 (6 seated passengers on two wooden benches and 4 standees) and {{is free of}} charge. The car uses <b>lift</b> <b>buttons</b> operated by the passengers {{in the car and}} intercom to provide communication if there are operating issues.|$|R
50|$|During {{their final}} season in 2001 the drivers, Jenson Button and Giancarlo Fisichella, were {{often on the}} back two rows of the grid. This was in part {{attributed}} to the new 111-degree wide angle engine. But continued development allowed Benetton to leave Formula 1 on something of a high, and the cars' performance <b>lifted.</b> <b>Button</b> and Fisichella scored 10 points for the team, including a podium finish for Fisichella in Belgium.|$|R
50|$|No expense {{was spared}} on the building. The Centre has a snooker room with three full size tables, a fully {{equipped}} boxing gym and separate changing rooms {{for males and}} females. The gym was built {{so that it could}} also be used as a theatre. At the push of a <b>button,</b> a hydraulic <b>lift</b> raised a section of the floor {{at one end of the}} gym to provide a stage (unfortunately this facility no longer works).|$|R
5000|$|Orca, {{trained to}} think for himself, could respond to over 150 commands, {{including}} loading and unloading a washing machine, operating an ATM and VCR, open doors and cupboards, bring things from the fridge, untie shoelaces, remove gloves, socks, hats, scarves, shoes and jackets. He can select items from shelves in the supermarket, {{place them in a}} basket, and then put the items onto the conveyor. He could take an envelope of money into a shop which does not have wheelchair access and return with a newspaper. Orca could recognise around 30 objects by name, such as book, blanket, glove, phone, mobile, post and pole. Orca knew his left from his right and knew the difference between his left and the handler's left. He could press <b>buttons</b> for <b>lifts,</b> light switches and pedestrian crossings. Cheryl gives as an example an anecdote, that: ...|$|R
5000|$|To reach {{a certain}} {{portion of a}} song, a person may fast-forward through a {{cassette}} tape by pressing a button (often labeled [...] "Fast Forward" [...] itself) on the tape deck containing the tape. The tape deck's motor activates at a speed higher than usual—for example, double the standard 1-7/8 ips playing speed of the 1/8" [...] cassette tape—and can be stopped {{by the end of}} the tape, the pressing of a [...] "Stop" [...] button on the deck (or another button mechanism disengaging the <b>button),</b> or simply <b>lifting</b> a finger from the [...] "Fast Forward" [...] button.|$|R
2500|$|In his memoirs, Lee Kuan Yew recounted that {{as early}} as 1983, {{when he was still}} serving as Prime Minister, a {{proposal}} for the ban was brought up to him by the then Minister for National Development. Chewing gum was causing serious maintenance problems in high-rise public housing flats, with vandals disposing of spent gum in mailboxes, inside keyholes and even on <b>lift</b> <b>buttons.</b> Chewing gum left on the ground, stairways and pavements in public areas increased the cost of cleaning and damaged cleaning equipment. Gum stuck on the seats of public buses was also considered a problem. However, Lee thought that a ban would be [...] "too drastic" [...] and did not take action.|$|R
5000|$|Until its dend, Isopress {{produced}} {{a wide range}} of thermoplastic and thermoset components. In particular, components for railway technology (switch controllers, [...] "chimney" [...] lightning arrestors for the SBB-CFF-FFS Re 460 (for the company Société Anonyme of the Atelier de Sécheron), loudspeaker covers for S-Bahn wagons) as well as <b>lift</b> <b>buttons,</b> filters for medical technology, electrical components for the Schurter Holding (e.g. EMF switches) and knurled screws etc. The Isopress trained its own apprentices as plastic technologists, it also enabled plastic technologists apprentices of Lego Produktion AG Switzerland to study the second subject of thermosetting processing and to complete the occupational test in this field at the Isopress AG. In 2001, Isopress entered into a collaboration with Lanker AG in Oberriet. In 2015, Isopress AG was dissolved and integrated into Lanker AG.|$|R
40|$|A {{formalism}} {{is motivated}} and described for representing defaults in specifications. The formalism is called Ordered Theory Presentations. The ability to represent defaults narrows the gap between a customer 's initial requirements and a formal specification, and supports reuse on both a small and a large scale. We illustrate the issues throughout {{with reference to the}} lift example. We also consider the application of the formalism to specification revision. 1 Introduction Imagine specifying a lift system. There is a <b>lift,</b> with n <b>buttons</b> and n indicator lights inside, and there are doors. The <b>buttons</b> inside the <b>lift</b> are for requesting where the lift goes, and the indicator lights register such requests. There are floors, each with two buttons and indicator lights (one for requesting to go up and one for down). The indicator lights switch on in response to button pressings and off when the lift arrives at a floor; and the lift goes from floor to floor depending {{on the state of the}} ligh [...] ...|$|R
50|$|A typical {{barrier-free}} {{route for}} an elevated station would {{start at the}} ramp entrance to the station and following the tactile path, would bring the elderly or the handicapped past the wider Automatic Fare Collection (AFC) gates & into the lift at the concourse level. The lift will feature braille plates on <b>lift</b> <b>buttons,</b> audio announcements and LED displays. Upon exiting from the lift at the platform level, the tactile path will lead them onto a designated waiting area where {{the doors of the}} middle train cars will be (and where the designated wheelchair space will be) to wait for the train. The tactile path may diverge at the concourse level to lead to the handicapped friendly toilet or passenger service centre. At all elevated stations where platform screen doors are not installed, tactile studs are installed along the platform edge to serve as reminder for them that they are getting too close to the edge.|$|R
40|$|Hospitals often {{experience}} lift congestion as {{a result}} of their heavy traffic, complex user types, and relatively slow-moving lifts (due to concerns over safety). Given the increasing number of current and new hospital building blocks that consist of many storeys, a visual simulation-based decision support system (DSS) is recommended. We present the modelling approach and development of a tool capable of being used for lift performance evaluation/prediction of existing/new hospital designs. These are also applicable to other general-purpose lift systems. A new data modelling approach, based on collected empirical traffic data, was developed to estimate the inter-floor passenger traffic. The DSS is flexible enough to allow the input of any zoning policy. The integrated zoning analysis offered here has not been found in existing lift simulators. This paper is the first to model a special feature designed to disable certain <b>lift</b> <b>buttons</b> in order to ensure fair use of the lift service. We carried out field studies of two existing hospitals, and we projected lift demand for a new hospital under construction. Performances at all three hospitals with different design structures under different operational control policies and lift features are given. © 2002 Elsevier Science B. V.

500|$|Selected special {{segments}} of the song will have glowing notes outlined by stars: successfully hitting all notes in this series will fill the [...] "Star Power Meter". The Star Power Meter can also be filled by using the whammy bar during sustained notes within these segments. Once the Star Power Meter is at least half full, the player can activate [...] "Star Power" [...] by pressing the select <b>button</b> or momentarily <b>lifting</b> the guitar into a vertical position. When Star Power is activated, the scoring multiplier is doubled until Star Power is depleted. The Rock Meter also increases more dramatically when Star Power is activated, {{making it easier for}} the player to make the Rock Meter stay at a high level. Thus, Star Power can be used strategically to play difficult sections of a song that otherwise might cause the player to fail. In the earlier entries of the series (up until Guitar Hero: Aerosmith), activating Star Power meant that players could not accrue more Star Power until the Star Power meter was fully drained and the effect ended. Starting with Guitar Hero: World Tour, more Star Power can be collected even if the effect is active by completing more Star Power phrases, extending the Star Power's duration by doing so. When playing in cooperative play (with a bassist/rhythm guitarist in Guitar Hero II through Guitar Hero: Aerosmith or as a band in Guitar Hero: World Tour), Star Power is shared between all the players and activation of Star Power is dependent on all players simultaneously activating it.|$|R
